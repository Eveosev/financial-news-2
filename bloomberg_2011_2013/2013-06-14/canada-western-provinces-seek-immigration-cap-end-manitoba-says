Canada ’s western provinces, from
British Columbia to Nunavut, will call on the government to lift
a cap on immigration that is compounding shortages of skilled
labor, Manitoba Premier Greg Selinger said.  Manitoba can’t reach its goal of bringing 75,000 immigrants
to the province in the next eight years because federal
restrictions limit the number of newcomers who can enter under
the Provincial Nominee Program, Selinger said. Western and
territorial leaders set to meet in Winnipeg on June 17 want
Ottawa to lift the caps so that companies can fill job vacancies
as  baby boomers  retire, he said.  “We’ve seen some changes that have potentially put a crimp
in our ability to grow our economies and have people living in
our communities,” Selinger said today in a telephone interview
from Winnipeg.  Leaders of the western provinces and territories plan to
draft a policy statement on immigration limits and “make their
case known” to the federal government, he said. The Western
Premiers’ Conference includes representatives from Manitoba,
 Alberta , Saskatchewan, British Columbia, Yukon,  Northwest
Territories  and Nunavut.  Officials also will discuss disaster management programs
and the need for more flexibility to help unemployed Canadians
access federal programs to upgrade their skills, Selinger said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
