The U.K. Treasury has reached
settlements with six more departments, including the Home
Office, in its negotiations for the 2015-16 spending round.  Chancellor of the Exchequer  George Osborne  on May 28
announced deals with the first seven departments. His target is
to cut 11.5 billion pounds ($18 billion) off spending in that
year. With the budgets of more than half of government
departments provisionally settled, the Treasury said it remains
on course to meet its goal. There are still 10 departments,
including the Ministry of Defence, that have yet to reach deals.  “None of the spending choices we make are easy, but
ensuring the U.K. can pay its way in the world is vital to our
long terms prosperity,” Chief Secretary to the Treasury Danny
Alexander said in an e-mailed statement. “Settling over half of
departments with two weeks to go shows how committed the whole
of government is to dealing with the deficit.”  The chancellor is scheduled to announce his 2015-16
spending plans in Parliament in  London  on June 26. In today’s
announcement, police counter-terror capabilities, which are
funded by the  Home Office , are protected, the Treasury said.  In total, 3.6 billion pounds of savings have been agreed on
with departments so far.  To contact the reporter on this story:
