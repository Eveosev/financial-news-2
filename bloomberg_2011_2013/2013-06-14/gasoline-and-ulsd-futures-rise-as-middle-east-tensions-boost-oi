Gasoline and ultra-low sulfur diesel
followed crude higher amid concern that President  Barack Obama ’s
decision to arm Syrian rebels will escalate tensions in the
region and disrupt oil supplies. Crack spreads were mixed.  Futures increased weekly gains after reports the U.S. will
provide small arms and ammunition to the Syrian opposition and
that it confirmed that President Bashar al-Assad’s forces used
chemical weapons. Voting in  Iran ’s election to replace President
 Mahmoud Ahmadinejad  began today.  “This is all on the back of the Obama administration
announcing they will begin to arm the Syrian rebels and fears in
the market this will ultimately lead to a wider conflict
throughout the region,” said  Andy Lipow , president of Lipow Oil
Associates LLC in Houston.  Gasoline for July delivery rose 4.62 cents, or 1.6 percent,
