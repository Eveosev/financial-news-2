U.K. stocks climbed , sending the
 FTSE 100 (UKX)  Index higher for a second day, led by gains in banks
and real estate companies after house prices advanced to a
record last month.  LLoyds Banking Group Plc, Britain’s largest mortgage
lender, and  Land Securities Group Plc (LAND) , the U.K.’s largest real
estate investment trust, both rose more than 1 percent.  The FTSE 100 rose 32.83 points, or 0.5 percent, to 6,337.46
at 8:57 a.m. in London, trimming the gauge’s decline this week
to 1.2 percent. The broader FTSE All-Share Index rallied 0.6
percent and Ireland’s ISEQ Index rose 1.1 percent.  Stocks advanced as a report showed house prices in England
and Wales rose to a record in May as government measures to ease
credit strains improved the availability of mortgages.  The average cost of a home rose 0.4 percent from April to
233,061 pounds ($365,000), Acadametrics and LSL Property
Services Plc said in a monthly report published in  London  today.
Prices were up 2.7 percent from a year earlier.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
