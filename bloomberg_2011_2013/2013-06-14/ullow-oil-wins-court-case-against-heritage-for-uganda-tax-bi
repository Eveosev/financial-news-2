Tullow Oil Plc (TLW) , a U.K. oil and gas
explorer, said a London court ruled in its favor and against
 Heritage Oil Plc (HOIL)  in a dispute over a tax bill in Uganda.  Tullow bought interests in two blocks in the Lake Albert
Basin from Heritage in 2010 for about $1.5 billion. In 2011,
London-based Tullow paid the Ugandan government $313 million in
capital gains tax after Heritage refused to pay and the
government threatened to block the deal.  The judge “found in favor of Tullow’s indemnity claim for
$313 million in its entirety and also dismissed Heritage’s
counterclaim,” Tullow said in a statement. “A further hearing
will be scheduled in due course to address matters arising from
the judgment such as the amount of interest Heritage owes.”  Tullow rose 1.5 percent to close at 1,048 pence in London
trading. Heritage fell 2.1 percent to 139.2 pence.  To contact the reporter on this story:
