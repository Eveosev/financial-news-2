The  Oakland Athletics  completed a
three-game series sweep of the visiting Yankees with an 18-inning victory in which New York reliever  Mariano Rivera  failed
to retire any of the three batters he faced.  The Yankees (37-29), who announced yesterday that shortstop
 Derek Jeter  had been cleared to begin “baseball activities and
running” for the first time this season, fell into third place
in the American League East. The Athletics (41-27), who have won
21 of their past 26 games, are atop the AL West.  Rivera, 43, the Major League Baseball career saves leader
with 631, entered the game with one out and a runner on first in
the 18th. He gave up a bloop single to Seth Smith, walked Jed Lowrie intentionally and then allowed a game-winning single by
Nate Freiman.  “A little broken-bat blooper over the third baseman, and
the other one the same place,” Rivera told reporters. “You
can’t do anything about it.”  The five hour, 35 minute game was the third of 18 innings
or more in less than a week. On June 8, the Miami Marlins needed
20 innings to defeat the New York Mets 2-1 and the  Toronto Blue
Jays  went 18 innings to top the Texas Rangers 4-3.  Oakland, which has won 11 straight games at home, became
the first AL team since 1971 to play two 18-inning games in one
season. The A’s defeated the Los Angeles Angels 10-8 in 19
innings in late April.  ‘Very Taxing’  It was the first time since 1988 that the Yankees had
played at least 18 innings.  The Yankees had a runner in scoring position in the 10th,
11th, 12th, 13th and 14th innings. The A’s had a runner thrown
out at home plate in the 15th.  “It was very taxing even winning the game,” Athletics
manager  Bob Melvin  told reporters. “To lose could have been
demoralizing.”  New York got its only runs in the first inning on a two-run
homer by  Robinson Cano , and was then shut out for 17 innings by
seven Oakland pitchers. Cano’s home run was the first for the
Yankees since June 6.  The middle of the Yankees lineup --  Mark Teixeira , Travis Hafner,  Kevin Youkilis  and  Vernon Wells  -- went 0-for-28
yesterday and each of the four struck out three times.  At Citi Field in New York, the Mets’ Matt Harvey lost for
the first time this season as the St. Louis Cardinals won 2-1 as
Adam Wainwright (10-3) pitched seven shutout innings to become
baseball’s first 10-game winner this season.  Harvey, 24, who allowed one run in seven innings, entered
the game 5-0 this season and had not lost in his previous 14
starts dating to September. New York has averaged less than
three runs in Harvey’s last nine starts.  To contact the reporter on this story:
