ArcelorMittal (MT)  said Bill Scotting
will replace Peter Kukielski as chief executive officer of the
steelmaker’s mining business, which has grown to become the
world’s fifth-biggest producer of iron ore.  Scotting, currently head of strategy at the Luxembourg-based company, will take the role on Aug. 3, ArcelorMittal said
in a statement today. Kukielski is leaving the world’s largest
steelmaker for a new opportunity, it said.  Kukielski has headed the division since 2008, leading
ArcelorMittal’s drive to buy and build iron-ore and coal mines
and be more self-sufficient in raw materials. The company
produced 55.9 million metric tons of iron ore last year, ranking
behind Vale SA, Rio Tinto Group, BHP Billiton Ltd. and Fortescue
Metals Group Ltd., according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Lakshmi Mittal , ArcelorMittal’s CEO and 41 percent
shareholder, has added mining assets from  Brazil  to  Russia  since
Mittal Steel Co. bought Arcelor SA in 2006 in the steel
industry’s biggest takeover. He has sought to lessen dependence
on the biggest mining companies by adding raw material supplies
and is seeking to produce 84 million tons of iron ore in 2015.  Mining contributed earnings before interest, taxes,
depreciation and amortization of $1.7 billion last year for
ArcelorMittal on sales of $6.3 billion. As well as iron ore, the
company also mined 8.2 million tons of coking coal used in
steelmaking.  To contact the reporter on this story:
