Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus said
raising minimum wages in Bangladesh’s garment manufacturing
industry wouldn’t push apparel companies to leave the country.  “The average wage is 25 cents an hour, making it 50 cents
an hour won’t cost a leg and an arm,” Yunus, the founder of
microfinance lender Grameen Bank, said today in an interview on
Bloomberg Television.  Labor rights groups are pressuring companies from  Wal-Mart
Stores Inc. (WMT)  to  Fast Retailing Co. (9983)  to improve wages and
conditions in Bangladesh’s multibillion dollar garment industry
since more than 1,000 people died in the April 24 collapse of
the Rana Plaza factory -- the worst industrial incident in the
country’s history. Raising wages for Bangladesh’s 3 million or
so garment workers would spur increases in other countries,
according to Yunus.  “Prices will go up everywhere, Bangladesh will not lose
its competitive edge,” the Nobel Peace Prize winner said.
Executives running global retailers are “decent people,” Yunus
said. Once they understand the issues at stake, they will see
the need to improve wages and conditions, he said.  “The factory inspection systems need to be right,” Yunus
said. The clothing that emerges from  Bangladesh ’s factories has
good quality and the factories themselves should match that, he
said.  “Maybe we were too busy negotiating prices, we didn’t look
beyond,” Yunus said, referring to garment manufacturing
contracts. “Today we all have to be responsible.”  Top Retail Stories {NI TOP}  To contact the reporter on this story:
