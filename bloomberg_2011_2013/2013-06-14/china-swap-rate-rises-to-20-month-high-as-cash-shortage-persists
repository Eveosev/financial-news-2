China’s one-year interest-rate swap
climbed to a 20-month high on speculation banks are hoarding
funds to meet quarter-end  capital requirements , prolonging a
cash shortage.  The People’s Bank of China added a net 92 billion  yuan  ($15
billion) into the financial system this week, down from 160
billion yuan in the five days through June 7, according to  data 
compiled by Bloomberg. The one-year swap rate has increased
every day since May 28, barring the three-day holiday at the
start of the week.  “We are still bearish on the liquidity outlook because
banks need to set aside cash for the mid-year accounting period
and we will head into another tax payment season in July,” said
Pin Ru Tan, an interest-rate strategist at HSBC Securities Asia
Ltd. in Hong Kong.  The one-year contract, the fixed cost needed to receive the
floating seven-day repurchase rate, gained two basis points to
3.67 percent as of 9:18 a.m. in Shanghai, the highest since
October 2011, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The seven-day repo rose 11 basis points, or 0.11 percentage
point, to 6.5 percent.  -- Judy Chen . Editors: Simon Harvey, Robin Ganguly  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
