Most  U.K. stocks  advanced, sending
the benchmark FTSE 100 Index higher for a second day, led by
gains in real estate companies after house prices rose to a
record last month.  Land Securities (LAND)  Group Plc, Britain’s largest real estate
investment trust, and Persimmon Plc both climbed at least 1.5
percent. Glencore Xstrata Plc led a rally in commodity producers
as base metals climbed.  HSBC Holdings Plc (HSBA)  led declining shares,
falling 1.5 percent.  The FTSE 100 Index rose 3.63 points, or 0.1 percent, to
6,308.26 at the close in London as about two stocks rose for
every one that fell. The gauge still lost 1.6 percent this week,
for a fourth weekly drop, its longest stretch of losses in 14
months.  “The recent pullback provides investors with another
buying opportunity,” Citigroup Inc. strategists including Anna
Esposito wrote in a report to clients dated yesterday. “The
macro backdrop is likely to be supportive for equities with
modest global gross domestic product growth, low inflation and
super-low interest rates.”  The broader FTSE All-Share Index gained 0.2 percent today
and Ireland’s ISEQ Index added 1.1 percent. The volume of shares
changing hands in companies listed on the  FTSE 100 (UKX)  was 7.2
percent higher than the average of the past 30 days, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Gains were limited as a U.S. report showed industrial
production in the world’s largest economy was unchanged in May
and followed a revised 0.4 percent decrease in April that was
smaller than previously posted, a Federal Reserve report showed
today in  Washington . The median forecast in a Bloomberg survey
called for a 0.2 percent advance.  Banks Decline  Property companies climbed after a report showed house
prices in England and  Wales  rose to a record in May as
government measures to ease credit strains improved the
availability of mortgages.  The average cost of a home rose 0.4 percent from April to
233,061 pounds ($365,000), Acadametrics and LSL Property
Services Plc said in a monthly report published in London today.
Prices were up 2.7 percent from a year earlier.  Land Securities gained 1.5 percent to 902 pence, British
Land Co., the U.K.’s second largest REIT, advanced 2.1 percent
to 595.5 pence and  Hammerson Plc (HMSO)  rose 2.1 percent to 507 pence.  Persimmon led homebuilders higher, increasing 1.8 percent
to 1,204 pence.  Taylor Wimpey Plc (TW/)  added 2.9 percent 94.85 pence
and Barratt Developments Plc climbed 3.5 percent to 310 pence.  Great Portland Estates Plc (GPOR) , the real estate developer
focused on London’s West End, rallied 3.9 percent to 548 pence.
UBS AG upgraded the company to buy from neutral, following a
recent decline in the shares.  Among commodity producers,  Antofagasta (ANTO)  Plc rose 1.4 percent
to 904 pence as base metals advanced in London. Glencore Xstrata
added 3.2 percent to 315.9 pence and Rio Tinto Group increased 1
percent to 2,786 pence.  HSBC, the heaviest-weighted stock on the FTSE 100, slid 1.5
percent to 680.1 pence for a fifth day of declines.  Severn Trent Plc slid 1.4 percent to 1,760 pence, extending
its decline this week to 15 percent after Borealis
Infrastructure Management Inc. and its partners walked away from
their 5.3 billion-pound ($8.3 billion) offer for the U.K. water
utility.  To contact the reporter on this story:
