Taiwan ’s bonds advanced, pushing the
five-year yield toward the lowest level in three weeks, as
concern about an economic slowdown in China spurred demand for
government debt. The local dollar gained.  Global funds pulled $584 million from Taiwanese stocks
yesterday, the heaviest net sales since September 2011, exchange
data show. China, Taiwan’s biggest export market, reported a
drop in imports for May, while Morgan Stanley, Royal Bank of
Scotland Group Plc and UBS AG all lowered their 2013 growth
forecasts for Asia’s biggest economy this week.  The yield on Taiwan’s 0.875 percent bonds due January 2018
dropped one basis points, or 0.01 percentage point, today to
0.982 percent as of 10:50 a.m. in Taipei, according to Gretai
Securities Market prices. It touched 0.98 percent on June 7, the
lowest since May 28, and was little changed for the week.  “Investors are getting increasingly worried about  China ’s
economy,” said Sam Chang, a fixed-income trader at Yuanta
Securities Co. in Taipei. “Supply of 10-year bonds will trump
five-years for the rest of the year, leading to a further
widening of the spread.”  The extra  yield  investors demand to hold the island’s 10-year notes instead of five-year debt widened to 37 basis points
yesterday, the most in 21 months. The Ministry of Finance plans
to sell NT$35 billion ($1.2 billion) of 10-year securities on
June 25.  The Taiwan dollar rose 1 percent today to NT$29.876 against
its U.S. counterpart, Taipei Forex Inc. prices show. The
currency was trading 0.9 percent stronger one minute before
yesterday’s 4 p.m. close, before finishing little changed on the
day. The central bank has sold the currency in the run-up to the
close on most days in the past year, according to traders who
asked not to be identified.  Forwards, Volatility  One-month non-deliverable forwards rose less than 0.1
percent today to NT$29.850 and were down 0.5 percent from the
end of last week, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. One-month implied volatility, a gauge of expected moves in the
exchange rate used to price options, fell seven basis points
today to 4.81 percent.  The  overnight interbank lending  rate was little changed at
0.386 percent, according to a weighted average compiled by the
Taiwan Interbank Money Center.  To contact the reporter on this story:
