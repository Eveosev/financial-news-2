The eastern U.S. may miss any
sustained bouts of heat through most of the month, said  Matt Rogers , president of Commodity Weather Group LLC.  While areas west of the Mississippi River have mild bursts
of higher-than-normal temperatures, the East is expected to
remain at seasonal levels until June 28, said Rogers, in
Bethesda,  Maryland . The Northeast, including New York, may be
about 3 degrees Fahrenheit (1.7 Celsius) below normal from June
19 to 23.  “This summer continues to be incredibly tough to translate
any sort of sustainable or strong heat to key areas of the
Midwest and East, with no major changes seen again today in that
direction,” Rogers said.  Above-normal temperatures in large population areas of the
East and Midwest can spur natural gas demand as more people turn
to air conditioners to keep cool.  Power plants  will account for
32 percent of U.S. gas consumption this year, Energy Information
Administration data show.  Texas and the central Plains are expected to be about 3
degrees above normal from today until June 28, Rogers said. An
area from western South Dakota to western Texas may reach 5
degrees above the norm from June 19 to 23.  The normal average temperature on June 16 in  New York City 
is about 72 degrees, according to  MDA Weather Services  in
Gaithersburg, Maryland. In Boston, it’s 68; in Chicago, 70; in
Houston, 83; in  St. Louis , 77; and in Burbank, California, 70.  To contact the reporter on this story:
