Absa Group Ltd. (ASA) , the South African
bank controlled by  Barclays Plc (BARC) , said it has restricted lending
and lost market share to avoid increasing bad debt.  “Our personal loan book has remained virtually flat over
the past year and our market share in personal loans has dropped
from around 30 percent to below 10 percent,” David Hodnett,
chief financial officer of Johannesburg-based Absa, said in an
e-mailed response to questions yesterday. “Our average loan
size has been decreasing.”  South African consumers are finding it harder to repay
loans as unemployment rose in the first quarter and higher
electricity and fuel prices boost inflation. Absa has focused on
existing customers, said Hodnett, after setting aside more money
for bad loans last year as credit impairments increased.  “As a bank that has a significant share of the retail
consumer market, we will have exposure if a deteriorating
economic environment impacts the South African consumer,”
Hodnett said.  African Bank Investments Ltd. (ABL) , South Africa’s biggest
provider of unsecured loans, cut its dividend 71 percent on May
20 after saying bad debts rose more than expected.  FirstRand
Ltd. (FSR) ’s retail unit and  Nedbank Group Ltd. (NED)  have said they are
exercising caution in an environment, which may become even
harder for consumers should interest rates go up.  To contact the reporter on this story:
