Canadian  factory sales  fell at the
fastest pace in more than three years in April, a widespread
drop led by slower oil-refinery production and metal output.  Sales dropped 2.4 percent to C$48.2 billion ($47.4
billion),  Statistics Canada  said today in Ottawa, while
inventories rose to the highest in records dating to 1992. The
Canadian dollar declined as the report contradicted economists
who  forecast  a 0.3 percent gain.  The fourth sales decline in five months underscores the
inconsistent global demand that has  stalled  factory orders for
more than a year. The  Bank of Canada  predicts the economic
expansion will rotate to exports and investment from consumer
and government spending even amid what it calls the slowest
export recovery since World War II.  “The month’s factory sector weakness suggests April gross
domestic product could eke out at best an only mild gain,” said
Emanuella Enenajor, an economist at Canadian Imperial Bank of
Commerce in Toronto. Some of the April decline should be made up
when refinery production returns to normal, she said.  Petroleum and coal sales dropped 8.8 percent to C$6.26
billion, the lowest since June 2011, Statistics Canada said.
“Some refineries reported that either maintenance or the switch
to summer fuels required production to be slowed or halted for a
longer than normal period,” according to the agency’s report.  Primary metal sales dropped 8.7 percent to C$3.43 billion
in April, the lowest since May 2010. Receipts fell in 13 of 21
 categories  tracked by Statistics Canada, accounting for 86
percent of production.  Dollar Declines  The Canadian dollar fell 0.2 percent to C$1.0175 per  U.S.
dollar  at 9:26 a.m. in Toronto. It reached C$1.0148 yesterday,
the highest since May 15. One dollar buys 98.28 U.S. cents.
Government bond yields declined, with the five-year security
falling 3 basis points to 1.53 percent.  Sales excluding motor vehicles and parts decreased 2.5
percent to C$41.9 billion, Statistics Canada said.  Excluding price changes, a better indicator of the
industry’s contribution to economic growth, factory sales fell
1.6 percent.  Unfilled orders fell 0.1 percent to C$70.9 billion, still
the fourth highest total on record. New orders fell 0.9 percent
to C$48.1 billion.  Inventories rose 0.6 percent to C$69 billion, the fourth
straight increase. The ratio of factory stockpiles to sales
increased to 1.43 from 1.39, the highest since October 2009.  From a year earlier, factory sales fell 3.3 percent in
April, Statistics Canada said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
