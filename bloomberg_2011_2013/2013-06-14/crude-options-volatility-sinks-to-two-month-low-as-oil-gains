Crude oil options volatility sank to
the lowest level since April 10 as the underlying futures jumped
1.2 percent.  Implied volatility for at-the-money options expiring in
August, a measure of expected price swings in futures and a
gauge of options prices, was 18.88 percent on the  New York 
Mercantile Exchange as of 3:10 p.m., compared with 19.74 percent
yesterday.  “We’ve had a little bit of a bull run here but we’re still
in a big trading range,” said Phil Flynn, senior market analyst
at Price Futures Group in  Chicago . “If the market gets above
$100 or below $87, the vols will go off the map.”  West Texas Intermediate crude for August delivery rose
$1.15, or 1.2 percent, to settle at $98.07 a barrel on the
Nymex. July futures gained $1.16 to $97.85.  The most-active options in electronic trading today were
July $100 calls, which rose 1 cent to 5 cents a barrel on 4,912
lots at 3:47 p.m. on the Nymex. July $98 calls were the second-most active, rising 17 cents to 40 cents a barrel on volume of
3,410 contracts.  Calls and puts were almost evenly split in electronic
trading volume. In the prior session, puts accounted for 60
percent of 109,862 contracts.  August $90 puts were the most-active options traded
yesterday, with 6,766 contracts changing hands. They fell 16
cents to 52 cents a barrel. August $86 puts declined 7 cents to
21 cents on volume of 6,317 lots.  Open interest was highest for September $85 puts with
53,758 contracts. Next were July $110 calls with 36,683 lots and
December $105 calls with 36,137.  The exchange distributes real-time data for electronic
trading and releases information the next business day on open-outcry volume, where the bulk of options activity occurs.  To contact the reporter on this story:
