Ethanol’s discount to gasoline
narrowed on concern stockpiles of the fuel aren’t adequate to
meet demand.  The spread, or price difference, shrank 0.36 cent to 39.67
cents a gallon two days after an Energy Information
Administration report showed  inventories  last week fell 2.6
percent to 16 million barrels, the lowest in records going back
to June 2010 and as  production  lagged 3.9 percent below year-ago
levels.  “We’ve got extremely low inventories and production hasn’t
been all that great,” said Joshua Bailer, managing director of
Next Generation Commodities, the biofuels division of Atlas
Commodities LLC in Miami.  Denatured ethanol for July delivery gained 3.9 cents, or
1.6 percent, to $2.50 a gallon on the Chicago Board of Trade.
Prices are up 14 percent this year.  Gasoline for July delivery advanced 3.54 cents, or 1.2
percent, to $2.8967 a gallon on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange . The contract covers reformulated gasoline, made to be
blended with ethanol before delivery to filling stations.  Ethanol  production  has climbed 15 percent to 884,000
barrels a day last week from a record low 770,000 barrels a day
in January, the Energy Department’s analytical arm said in the
June 12 report.  That’s still down 8.2 percent from the record 963,000
barrels a day in December 2011, EIA data show.  Use Mandate  The U.S. is required to use 13.8 billion gallons of
ethanol, or about 900,000 barrels a day, this year and 14.4
billion next year. Output has averaged 825,000 barrels a day, or
12.6 billion gallons on an annualized basis.  Each gallon of ethanol is assigned a tracking certificate
known as a Renewable Identification Number, or RIN. A refiner
can keep the credit to show compliance with the mandate, or
trade it.  Corn-based ethanol RINs for 2013  climbed 1 cent to 90
cents, data compiled by Bloomberg show. Advanced RINs, which
cover biodiesel and Brazilian sugarcane-based ethanol, were
unchanged at 96 cents.  Ethanol producers had reduced operations after the worst
U.S. drought since the 1930s last summer damaged corn crops and
boosted costs to make the biofuel.  Corn for July delivery climbed 11.5 cents, or 1.8 percent,
to $6.55 a bushel in  Chicago . The corn crush spread, or the cost
difference between a gallon of ethanol and the corn needed to
make it, was 12 cents, unchanged from yesterday.  Brazilian Imports  Bailer said the higher prices this year that are attracting
Brazilian imports of the fuel may not be enough to replace the
depleted inventories. Imports have averaged 17,000 barrels a day
this year through June 7, up from 6,000 barrels a day during the
same period in 2012, EIA data show.  Anhydrous fuel ethanol in  Sao Paulo  cost $2.33 a gallon
last week, according to data compiled by Bloomberg, down from
$2.65 in April.  Ethanol-blended gasoline made up 94 percent of the total
U.S. gasoline pool last week, up from 89 percent the previous
week, EIA said.  In cash market trading, ethanol was unchanged in  New York 
at $2.595 a gallon, down 1.5 cents to $2.51 in Chicago, up 0.5
cent to $2.61 on the  Gulf Coast , and down 0.5 cent to $2.805 on
the West Coast, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  West Coast ethanol’s premium to the U.S. Gulf narrowed 1
cent to 19.5 cents, while Chicago’s discount to New York
expanded 1.5 cents to 8.5 cents.  To contact the reporter on this story:
