South African President Jacob Zuma
yesterday visited  Nelson Mandela  in a Pretoria hospital, where
he’s still in a serious condition for a seventh day.  Zuma was accompanied by Zweli Mkhize, treasurer-general of
the ruling  African National Congress , the president’s office
said in an e-mailed statement.  “Madiba’s health continues to improve, but his condition
remains serious,” Zuma said in the statement, referring to
Mandela by his clan name. “We continue to appeal to people to
keep Madiba in their prayers and wish him a speedy recovery.”  Mandela, 94, was admitted to the intensive care unit on
June 8 for treatment relating to a recurring lung infection,
with visitors limited to family members only. It’s his fourth
stay in the hospital since December, after he was treated for
pneumonia in April and had gall stones removed.  Mandela was elected to office in 1994 and stepped down
after a five-year term as president. He spent 27 years in
prison, mostly on Robben Island, for opposing white-minority
rule under apartheid.  The ANC said in an e-mailed statement it was “encouraged”
by Zuma’s comments.  “We are grateful to the president and the treasurer-general for visiting our beloved statesman on behalf of the
people of  South Africa  and the world,” the party said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
