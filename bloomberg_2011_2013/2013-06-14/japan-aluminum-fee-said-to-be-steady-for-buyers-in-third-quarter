Two aluminum buyers in  Japan ,  Asia â€™s
biggest importer, agreed to keep fees paid to producers steady
in the third quarter, according to three executives with direct
knowledge of the negotiations.  The premium will be $249 a metric ton over the price of
aluminum for immediate delivery on the London Metal Exchange,
compared with $248 to $250 this quarter, the executives said.
They asked not to be identified because the talks are private.
The premium more than doubled last year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
