Police dispersed about 200 people
after protesters burned tires and blocked traffic outside the
venue that will host tomorrow’s opening of soccer’s
Confederations Cup in  Brazil .  The demonstration, organized by a group demanding greater
support for the homeless, had initially been authorized by local
authorities before some protesters started burning tires, Marco
Antonio, head of the central Brasilia police delegation, said in
an interview.  The Mane Garrincha stadium in Brazil’s capital Brasilia has
come under increasing scrutiny from critics who’ve complained
about its cost as well as its future use. At about $750 million,
it’s the most expensive of the 12 stadiums Brazil will use
during next year’s  World Cup .  “They want the government to invest what they did in the
stadium into new housing for the poor,” Antonio said, standing
next to a mound of smoldering tires.  Brazil plays Japan tomorrow in the opening game of the
Confederations Cup, an eight-team warm up event for the World
Cup.  To contact the reporter on this story:
