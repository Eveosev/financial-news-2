A gauge of  Chinese stocks  in  Hong
Kong  posted its longest losing streak on record amid concern
 China ’s economic slowdown will crimp demand for lending, energy
and raw materials. Losses were limited as positive U.S. economic
data boosted exporters.  China Construction Bank Corp., the nation’s No. 2 lender,
lost 1.1 percent as a cash shortage saw the nation fail to sell
all the debt offered at an auction for the first time in 23
months. Aluminum Corp. of China Ltd., the biggest producer of
the lightweight metal in the mainland, declined 7.5 percent.
China Shenhua Energy Co., the country’s largest coal producer,
slipped 2.1 percent.  Techtronic Industries Co. (669) , which gets about
73 percent of sales from  North America , added 2.2 percent.  The  Hang Seng China Enterprises Index (HSCEI) , also known as the H-Share Index, slid 0.2 percent to 9,667.42 at the close, erasing
gains of as much as 1.3 percent and extending losses to a 12th
day, the longest losing streak on record. The measure has fallen
21 percent from its Feb. 1 high, exceeding the 20 percent
threshold that some investors consider as a  bear market . The
 Hang Seng Index  rose 0.4 percent to 20,969.14, after rising as
much as 1.3 percent earlier.  “There’s still a concern that growth in mainland China
will continue to slow down,” said Linus Yip, chief strategist
at First Shanghai Securities in Hong Kong. “Stocks have become
more attractive after such a big drop.”  The H-Share Index tumbled 5.1 percent this week, the
biggest drop in a year, as the  World Bank  cut its 2013 growth
outlook for China after data released on June 9 showed
industrial production trailed estimates in May and exports rose
the least in 10 months. Shares on the gauge traded at 7.1 times
 estimated earnings , compared with the average multiple of 10.8
in the past five years, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Worst Performer  The benchmark  Hang Seng Index (HSI)  slipped 2.8 percent this
week, extending losses for a fifth week, the longest such streak
since June 2012. The gauge has fallen 7.5 percent this year,
making Hong Kong the worst performer among developed equity
markets, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Shares on the measure traded at 9.9 times estimated
earnings, compared with multiples of 14.8 for the Standard &
Poor’s 500 Index and 12.9 for the Stoxx Europe 600 Index.  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index swung between
gains and losses today. The gauge climbed 1.5 percent yesterday
after reports showed retail sales gained the most in three
months and the number of claims for jobless benefits declined
last week. The Wall Street Journal reported that the Fed may
“push back” on market expectations of higher  interest rates .  More than  $2.5 trillion  has been erased from the value of
global equities since May 22, when Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben
S. Bernanke  said stimulus efforts may be scaled back if U.S.
employment shows “sustainable improvement.”  Liquidity Squeeze  Chinese shares extended losses today following a recent
spike in interbank lending rates. China’s  Finance Ministry  today
failed to sell all of the debt offered at an auction for the
first time in 23 months owing to a cash squeeze that threatens
to exacerbate a slowdown in the world’s second-largest economy.  China Construction Bank slipped 1.1 percent. Industrial and
Commercial Bank of China Ltd., the world’s biggest lender by
market value, lost 0.4 percent to HK$5.07. Aluminum Corp. of
China sank 7.5 percent to HK$2.60. China Shenhua fell 2.1
percent to HK$23.35.  Zijin Mining Group Co., China’s largest gold producer,
dropped 3.2 percent to HK$1.81 as bullion headed for a second
day of decline.  Exporters advanced. Techtronic, the maker of Ryobi power
tools, climbed 2.2 percent to HK$18.60.  Man Wah Holdings Ltd. (1999) , a
sofa maker that gets about 51 percent of sales from the U.S.,
increased 3.6 percent to HK$9.58.  To contact the reporter on this story:
