Polish bond yields headed for their
first weekly drop in six as speculation the  Federal Reserve  will
scale back its stimulus receded before the U.S. central bank’s
policy meeting next week, boosting appetite for riskier assets.  The  yield  on 10-year debt fell for a third day, taking the
five-day decline to four basis points, or 0.04 percentage point.
The zloty weakened 0.1 percent to 4.2234 per euro by 4:32 p.m.
in Warsaw, depreciating for the first time in three days.  The 10-year slid 15 basis points to 3.69 percent today,
which is 39 basis points above the level on May 22 when Fed
Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said the central bank could reduce its
monthly debt purchases if the employment outlook shows
sustainable improvement. The U.S. monetary policy makers are
scheduled to meet on June 18-19.  “Bonds are up around the globe as the markets expect the
Fed not to suggest pulling out from quantitative easing just
yet,” Michal Jochymek, senior central and eastern Europe fixed-income trader at BNP Paribas in Warsaw, said in an e-mailed
response to Bloomberg questions today. “Since we’ve seen yields
rise by nearly 100 basis points in the last few weeks, a decline
like this is nothing extraordinary.”  The Wall Street Journal  reported  yesterday the Fed may push
back on expectations of a rate increase.  Other emerging market bonds have also rallied, with the
rate on  Hungary ’s 10-year debt tumbling 40 basis points to 5.689
percent and  Turkey ’s similar-maturity security retreating 33
basis points to 7.02 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
