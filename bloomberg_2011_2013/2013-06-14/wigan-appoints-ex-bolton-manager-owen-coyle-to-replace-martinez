Wigan Athletic appointed former
Bolton manager Owen Coyle to replace Roberto Martinez as coach
of the recently relegated English soccer team.  The length of the 46-year-old’s contract wasn’t disclosed
today on  Wigan’s website . The Latics were relegated from the
Premier League last season, and Martinez, who led the club to
the F.A. Cup, moved to Everton.  Wigan Athletic last month became the first team to win the
Cup and be relegated from the Premier League in the same season.
Coyle started his management career at Falkirk, where he got the
club promoted to the Scottish Premier League. He moved to St
Johnstone and then to Burnley in  England , where his team won
promotion to the Premier League in his second season.  Coyle coached Bolton, where he had played for two seasons
in the 1990s, for two years before being replaced in October.
Bolton was relegated at the end of the 2011-12 season and
finished in seventh in the Championship, one spot out of the
promotion playoff spots last season.  The Latics finished no higher than 15th place during
Martinez’s tenure, but were able to avoid relegation in his
first three seasons after late-season rallies. They weren’t able
to pull another off this year and finished 18th in the 20-team
league, three points from safety behind Sunderland.  Relegation was confirmed with a 4-1 defeat at Arsenal,
three days after Wigan upset Manchester City 1-0 to win the F.A.
Cup, the first major trophy in its 81-year history.  To contact the reporter on this story:
