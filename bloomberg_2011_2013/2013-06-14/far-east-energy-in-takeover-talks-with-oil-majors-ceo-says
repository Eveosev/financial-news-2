Far East Energy Corp. (FEEC) , the explorer
cited by short-seller Carson Block in his criticism of Standard
Chartered Plc’s loan quality, has had talks with several global
 oil companies  for a possible takeover or a stake sale.  Discussions are in the early stages, Chief Executive
Officer Michael McElwrath said, without disclosing financial
details or a timeline. The Houston-based company, which explores
for coal-bed methane in China’s Shanxi province, will drill 70
wells this year, bringing its total to about 135, he said. The
company plans to drill 400 wells next year, he said.  “Our project and the high permeability we found belongs in
the portfolio of a major,” McElwrath said in an interview in
Hong Kong. “If it wasn’t this good, they wouldn’t touch it.”  Large-scale commercial shale gas production in  China  is at
least a decade away and, in the interim, coal-bed methane will
be a bridge fuel that helps China increase gas usage and get
away from coal, McElwrath said. More than 10 percent of domestic
Chinese natural gas could come from coal-bed methane projects,
he said.  Far East Energy used the $30 million it borrowed from
Standard Chartered to drill wells, McElwrath said. Block, who
runs Muddy Waters LLC, said at a May 10 conference in Las Vegas
loans to Far East Energy and to Samin Tan, chairman of  Bumi Plc (BUMI) ,
were “red flags.”  Far East Energy declined to respond to Block’s comments.  To contact the reporter on this story:
