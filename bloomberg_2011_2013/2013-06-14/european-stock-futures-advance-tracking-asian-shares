European stocks rose, with the Stoxx
Europe 600 Index paring its fourth weekly drop, as worse-than-forecast U.S. economic data fueled investor speculation that
central banks won’t immediately pare stimulus measures.  Elan Corp. jumped 8.4 percent in Dublin after authorizing
the process of its sale. Hochtief AG gained the most in four
months after the German builder said it will buy as much as 260
million euros ($346 million) of its own shares. Michelin & Cie,
Europe’s largest tiremaker, added 4.7 percent after data on its
website showed tire demand surged in Brazil last month.  Barry
Callebaut AG (BARN)  lost 3.4 percent after the maker of bulk chocolate
sold about $302 million of new shares.  The Stoxx 600 added 0.2 percent to 291.13 at the close of
trading. The equity benchmark still dropped 1.5 percent this
week, for the longest stretch of weekly losses in 14 months. It
has retreated 6.3 percent since May 22, when Federal Reserve
Chairman Ben S. Bernanke said the central bank could pare
stimulus if the U.S. economy improves sustainably.  “All the known risks have been priced into the market
now,” said Michael Woischneck, who oversees about $534 million
as senior equities manager at Lampe Asset Management in
Dusseldorf,  Germany . “The move has not terrified us and I don’t
think we’ll go much lower. I might be a bit more interested in
what Bernanke may say next week. I’ll be looking to see whether
all options, including more stimulus, are still on the table.”  Fed Meeting  The Fed will hold its two-day policy meeting next week,
with Bernanke scheduled to speak after the central bank’s
decision on June 19. Bernanke will deliver his semi-annual
monetary policy report to Congress on July 17 and 18.  The International Monetary Fund said it sees the Fed
maintaining bond purchases until the end of 2013. Unwinding a
policy of record-low interest rates and $85 billion in monthly
bond-buying will be challenging even though the Fed has “a
range of tools” to withdraw the stimulus, the IMF staff wrote
in an annual assessment of the U.S. economy.  U.S. industrial production was unchanged in May, following
a revised 0.4 decrease in the previous month, Federal Reserve
figures showed. Economists had projected a 0.2 percent gain for
last month, according to the median estimate in a Bloomberg
survey.  The Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan index of
consumer sentiment  dropped to 82.7  this month, from 84.5 that
was the highest level since July 2007, another report showed.  National benchmark indexes climbed in 16 of the 18 western
European markets. The U.K.’s FTSE 100 added less than 0.1
percent,  France ’s CAC 40 rose 0.2 percent, while Germany’s DAX
advanced 0.4 percent.  The VStoxx Index, a measure of volatility in the Euro Stoxx
50 Index, fell 3.8 percent today, after increasing 13 percent in
the past three days.  Elan Sale  Elan Corp. jumped 8.4 percent to 10.07 euros. The drugmaker
said it has authorized a a formal sale process and invited
Royalty Pharma to participate. Royalty has offered to buy Elan
for $6.7 billion, a bid Elan’s board rejected this week.  Hochtief gained 5.9 percent to 51.75 euros, its biggest
increase since Feb. 13. The company  controlled by  Spain’s
Actividades de Construccion & Servicios SA plans to buy as many
as 4.3 million shares over the next six months, representing
about 5.6 percent of its capital.  Michelin and Pirelli & C. SpA advanced 4.7 percent to 69.63
euros and 3.3 percent to 9.27 euros, respectively. Passenger
tire demand in  Brazil  surged 20 percent in May from a year
earlier for original equipment and 15 percent in the replacement
market, Michelin said on its  website . Continental AG increased
1.9 percent to 100.80 euros.  Nokia Venture  Nokia Oyj rallied 4.7 percent to 2.75 euros, its biggest
increase since February. Siemens AG has approached private-equity companies about a possible acquisition of Nokia Siemens
Networks, a joint venture of the two companies, Dow Jones
reported, citing unidentified sources.  Great Portland Estates Plc (GPOR)  rose 3.9 percent to 548 pence,
its biggest increase since January 2012. UBS AG raised its
 rating  on the stock to buy from neutral, citing recent declines.
Today’s gain reversed a weekly drop, which would have been the
fourth consecutive week of losses.  A  gauge  of real estate-linked shares in Europe climbed the
most in more than 11 months as a report showed home prices in
England and  Wales  rose to a record in May. Land Securities Group
Plc advanced 1.5 percent to 902 pence, while British Land Co.
gained 2.1 percent to 595.5 pence today. Barratt Developments
Plc added 3.5 percent to 310 pence.  Barry Callebaut slipped 3.4 percent to 862.5 Swiss francs.
The supplier to Nestle SA said it sold 318,858 new shares at 875
francs a piece to partly finance the acquisition of Petra Foods
Ltd.’s cocoa ingredients unit.  Holcim Ltd. (HOLN)  lost 0.9 percent to 68.15 francs in Zurich.
Bank of America Corp.’s Merrill Lynch unit cut its rating on the
world’s largest cement maker to underperform, similar to a sell
recommendation, from neutral. Merrill Lynch cited the company’s
 exposure  to  emerging markets .  To contact the reporter on this story:
