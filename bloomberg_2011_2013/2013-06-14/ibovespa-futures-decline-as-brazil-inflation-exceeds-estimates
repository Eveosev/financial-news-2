Ibovespa futures fell, a sign the
gauge may extend a weekly drop, after inflation in  Brazil 
exceeded estimates.  State-controlled oil company  Petroleo Brasileiro SA (PETR3)  may be
active after  Folha de S. Paulo  reported that the cancellation of
a debt certificate is preventing the company from importing and
exporting fuel. Insurance company  BB Seguridade Participacoes SA (BBSE3) 
may move after Itau BBA recommended investors buy the stock.  Ibovespa  futures  contracts expiring in August dropped 0.4
percent to 50,405 at 9:19 a.m. in Sao Paulo. The real weakened
0.3 percent to 2.1271 per dollar.  Brazil’s inflation as measured by the IGP-10 index was 0.6
percent in June, Getulio Vargas Foundation said today. That
compares with a median estimate of 0.45 percent among 22
analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. The benchmark Ibovespa index is
poised for its third weekly decline with a retreat of 2.3
percent over the past four days.  The Ibovespa has slumped 20 percent from this year’s peak
in January on speculation accelerating inflation may curb
Brazil’s economic recovery and the government’s interventionist
policies will hurt profits in industries including utilities and
energy.  Brazil’s benchmark equity gauge trades at 12 times
analysts’  earnings estimates  for the next four quarters,
compared with a multiple of 10.2 for the MSCI  Emerging Markets 
Index of 21 developing nations’ equities.  Trading volume for stocks in  Sao Paulo  was 8 billion reais
($3.8 billion) yesterday, compared with a daily average of 7.9
billion reais this year through June 13, according to data
 compiled  by the exchange.  To contact the reporter on this story:
