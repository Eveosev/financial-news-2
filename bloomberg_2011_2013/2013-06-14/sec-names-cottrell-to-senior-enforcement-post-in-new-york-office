Amelia Cottrell, a U.S. Securities
and Exchange Commission investigator who helped build an
insider-trading case against a unit of billionaire Steven A. Cohen’s SAC Capital Advisors LP, was promoted to a top
enforcement position in the agency’s  New York  office.  Cottrell, 39, will help supervise a staff of about 180
attorneys, investigators, accountants and paralegals as
associate director of the office, the SEC said in a statement
today. She has been part of an enforcement unit specializing in
unearthing market abuse that was formed in 2010.  Since joining the SEC in 2005, Cottrell has worked on high-profile cases, including the investigation of SAC Capital unit
CR Intrinsic Investors LLC that resulted in a record $616
million settlement in March, the SEC said. She also helped reach
a $25 million settlement with U.K.-based  ICAP Plc (IAP)  over claims
the brokerage displayed fake trades and misled customers.  “Amelia has been an extraordinary leader in this office
and is widely respected both within and outside of the SEC,”
Andrew Calamari, director of the New York office, said in a
statement.  Before joining the SEC, Cottrell worked for five years at
law firm Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison LLP and two
years at Jones Day, the SEC said. She graduated from Williams
College in 1995 before earning a juris doctor with honors from
the University of Chicago Law School in 1998.  To contact the reporter on this story:
