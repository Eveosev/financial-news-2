Mortgage insurers, a group that
includes  Radian Group Inc. (RDN)  and  MGIC Investment Corp. (MTG) , can expect
profits to reappear as the firms gain capital during an
improving housing market,  Standard & Poor’s  said.  “A sector some had written off seems to be making a
comeback,” Ron Joas, an S&P analyst, said today in a report.
“Mortgage insurers seem poised to return to profitability in
2014.”  Joas said a surge of capital into the mortgage-insurance
sector amid a rebounding economy has eased concerns that
insurers may become insolvent. Private guarantors wrote new
policies on $175 billion in mortgages in 2012, more than double
the year before, according to data from newsletter Inside
Mortgage Finance.  MGIC, based in Milwaukee, hasn’t posted an  annual profit 
since 2006, while Philadelphia-based Radian reported one
profitable year in that span. The U.S. Treasury Department said
in a report this week that mortgage insurers, hobbled by the
financial crisis, are beginning to see a turnaround.  “There are signs of increased capacity,” Treasury’s
Federal Insurance Office said. “The industry has attracted new
capital since 2010.”  MGIC has surged 130 percent this year, the best performance
in the 24-company KBW Insurance Index. It was unchanged $6.13 at
2:44 p.m in New York. Radian, which has also more than doubled
since December, declined  less than 1 percent to $12.78.  To contact the reporter on this story:
