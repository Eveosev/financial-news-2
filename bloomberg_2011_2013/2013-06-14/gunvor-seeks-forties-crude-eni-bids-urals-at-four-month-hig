Gunvor Group failed to buy  North Sea 
Forties crude at a lower differential than yesterday’s trades.
 Eni SpA (ENI)  didn’t manage to buy Russian Urals blend in the
Mediterranean even after raising its bid to the highest level in
more than four months.  North Sea  Gunvor was unable to buy Forties for June 26 to June 30
loading at 30 cents a barrel less than Dated Brent, a Bloomberg
survey of traders and brokers monitoring the Platts pricing
window showed. That compares with trades at discounts of 15 and
20 cents yesterday.  No bids or offers were made for Ekofisk and Oseberg.  Reported crude trading typically occurs during the Platts
window, which ends at 4:30 p.m. London time. Forties loading in
10 to 25 days was at 10 cents less than Dated Brent, compared
with a discount of 40 cents yesterday, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  Brent for August settlement traded at $106.04 a barrel on
the ICE Futures Europe exchange at the close of the window,
compared with $103.90 in the previous session. The September
contract was at $105.68 at the same time today, a discount of 36
cents to August.  Apache Corp. (APA)  will shut its Beryl B oil platform for 48

days is estimated at 30,000 to 45,000 barrels of oil equivalent,
he said. Crude will continue to be exported from the Beryl A
platform during the maintenance.  Mediterranean/Urals  Eni failed to buy 80,000 metric tons of Urals for June 29
to July 3 at 5 cents a barrel less than Dated Brent on a
delivered basis to Augusta in  Italy , 5 cents more than its bid
yesterday, according to the survey. This is the highest bid
since Jan. 22.  Urals in the Mediterranean rose by 23 cents to a discount
of 5 cents a barrel to Dated Brent, the highest since May 22,
data compiled by Bloomberg showed. In northwest  Europe , the
 discount  was 23 cents to the benchmark, versus minus 30 cents in
the previous session.  West Africa  Only three or four benchmark Nigerian Qua Iboe cargoes for
July loading are still available, said three trades who

barrel more than Dated Brent, they said.  Qua Iboe rose by 2 cents to a premium of $2.30 a barrel to
