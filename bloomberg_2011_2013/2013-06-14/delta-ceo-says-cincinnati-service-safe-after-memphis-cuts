Delta Air Lines Inc. (DAL)  said it’s
maintaining the number of flights and jobs in Cincinnati, after
announcing plans 10 days ago to scale back in  Memphis ,
Tennessee.  “The Cincinnati hub is doing quite well,”  Richard Anderson , chief executive officer of Atlanta-based Delta, said
in his weekly recorded message to employees. “We feel really
good about where our service levels are there, and beyond what
we’ve announced in Memphis, we don’t have any significant
network changes planned.”  Delta is retiring inefficient 50-seat jets from the
smallest of its eight hubs. With rising  jet-fuel  prices, these
planes have become too expensive to operate, leading to a June 4
decision to trim flights in Memphis by more than a third and cut
230 jobs, two Delta executives told employees in a memo.  Delta has 112 daily flights from Cincinnati, a 69 percent
decline from June 2008, said  Anthony Black , a spokesman for the
carrier. The regional unit consolidated ground operations in the
Ohio city, Delta’s second-smallest hub after Memphis, about
three years ago to reduce costs, eliminating 840 jobs.  Delta shares fell 0.3 percent to $18.66 at 1:45 p.m. in New
York. The shares have gained 58 percent this year through
yesterday’s close, topping the advance of the Bloomberg U.S.
Airlines Index, which is up 42 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
