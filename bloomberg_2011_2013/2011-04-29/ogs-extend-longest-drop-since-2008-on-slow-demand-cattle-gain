Hog futures dropped, extending the
longest slide since October 2008, on speculation that domestic
demand for U.S. pork is falling. Cattle prices climbed.  Adverse weather has slowed U.S. meat demand for outdoor
grilling, analysts said. Temperatures in the eastern U.S. and
Northeast will remain cooler than normal from May 4 to May 8,
according to Commodity Weather Group LLC. Tornadoes ravaged the
Southeast this week, killing hundreds of people and destroying
millions of dollars in property.  “I just don’t think it’s very favorable domestically” for
pork demand, partly because high gasoline costs are squeezing
consumers, said  Mark Schultz , the chief analyst at Northstar
Commodity Investment Co. in  Minneapolis .  Hog futures for June settlement fell 1.275 cents, or 1.3
percent, to settle at 95.225 cents a pound at 1:05 p.m. on the
Chicago Mercantile Exchange. The price dropped for a seventh
straight session, the longest decline since October 2008.  Consumer spending  rose in March as Americans spent more on
food and fuel, government figures showed today. Yesterday,
wholesale pork fell 0.7 percent to 91.76 cents a pound, the
lowest since March 16, U.S. Department of Agriculture data show.  Spot-market  steer  prices averaged $1.1681 a pound in the
first four days of this week, according to USDA data. That was
more than 3 cents higher than the most-active cattle-futures
contract yesterday, signaling the CME market is “oversold,”
Schultz said.  Cattle futures for June delivery rose 0.175 cent, or 0.2
percent, to settle at $1.1335 a pound. Prices fell 1.6 percent
this week. That marks the fourth straight decline, the longest
losing streak since June. The commodity has gained 21 percent in
the past year.  Feeder-cattle futures for August settlement fell 0.175 cent
to $1.3595 a pound.  To contact the reporter on this story:
