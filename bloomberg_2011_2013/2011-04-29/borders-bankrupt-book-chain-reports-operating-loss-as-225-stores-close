Borders Group Inc., the bookstore
chain operating in bankruptcy, today reported a loss of $24.3
million for the month ended March 26, according to court papers.  Borders, the second-largest book chain after  Barnes & Noble
Inc. (BKS) , filed for bankruptcy in February and is closing about 225
stores, a third of its total. The company’s most recent
financial report filed before today with the bankruptcy court
showed a loss of $479.9 million for the year ended Jan. 29, on
revenue of $1.67 billion.  The current report shows revenue of $165.2 million for the
month ended March 26 and total assets of $942.2 million. Cash
and equivalents are $80.9 million, the company reported.  “The debtors believe they are paying all undisputed
postpetition obligations according to terms,” Borders said in
the filing in  U.S. Bankruptcy Court  in Manhattan.  The financial report comes after The U.S. Trustee, a
bankruptcy watchdog for the Justice Department, today said the
company hasn’t shown that it can pay the costs accrued after its
petition, or bankruptcy date. The Trustee cited the lack of an
operating report to show the company’s financial state, and said
the company should be denied requests to pay lawyers and other
professionals.  The case is In re  Borders Group Inc. (BGP) , 11-10614, U.S.
Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of  New York  (Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
