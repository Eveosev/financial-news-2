German public broadcasters, which
are financed with license fees, plan to offer an online video-
on-demand platform next year, the  Financial Times Deutschland 
reported, citing Markus Schaechter, director of broadcaster ZDF.  ZDF, ARD and German film and television production firms
are discussing the creation of a central archive of German-made
content that will avoid a dependence on other platforms such as
 Google Inc. (GOOG) â€™s YouTube, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story: Ragnhild Kjetland in
