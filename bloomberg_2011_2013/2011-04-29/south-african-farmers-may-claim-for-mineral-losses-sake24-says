South Africa  may face claims from
farmers for the loss of ownership of minerals under their land
following a court judgment yesterday,  Sake24  said, citing
Johannes Moller, president of farmersâ€™ group Agri SA.  The North Gauteng High Court ruled that farmers must be
compensated after the Mineral and Petroleum Resources
Development Act in 2004 ended private ownership of minerals and
transferred it to the state, Sake24, the business section of
Johannesburg-based  Beeld  newspaper, said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
