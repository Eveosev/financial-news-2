German 10-year bund yields
approached the lowest level in more than a month as a report
showed retail sales in the euro regionâ€™s largest economy
unexpectedly declined in March.  The two-year yield was little changed. Sales decreased 2.1
percent from February, when they fell 0.4 percent, the Federal
Statistics Office in Wiesbaden said today. Economists forecast a
0.2 percent gain, according to the median of 18 estimates in a
Bloomberg News survey. From a year earlier, sales declined 3.5
percent.  The 10-year bund yield was little changed at 3.26 percent
as of 7:28 a.m. in  London . The 3.25 percent security due July
2021 traded at 99.92. The yield dropped to 3.20 percent
yesterday, the least since March 24. Yields on two-year notes
were at 1.77 percent.  German  government bonds  have handed investors a loss of 1.7
percent this year, according to indexes compiled by the European
Federation of Financial Analysts Societies and Bloomberg, while
Treasuries have returned 1 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
