Poland’s Economy Minister Waldemar
Pawlak reiterated that an initial public offering of Jastrzebska
Spolka Weglowa SA should take place only after the coking coal
producer’s management and unions reach an agreement on wages,
the ministry said in an e-mailed statement today after Pawlak
met with Prime Minister  Donald Tusk  and Treasury Minister
Aleksander Grad.  Pawlak hopes for a “quick resolution” of the dispute in
the company known as JSW and hasn’t yet set a date for the
shareholders meeting, which is to approve the IPO.  JSW was set to file the prospectus by April 20 and plans to
start trading in Warsaw on June 30.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
