South Korea , the world’s third-
biggest corn buyer, has started a grain-trading venture in the
U.S. in a bid to secure a stable supply amid soaring food
prices.  State-run Korea Agro-Fisheries Trade Corp. set up the
venture, aT Grain Co., in Chicago, with three other South Korean
companies, the Seoul-based company said in an e-mailed statement
today. Korea Agro-Fisheries owns 55 percent of aT Grain, while
 Samsung C&T Corp. (000830) , Hanjin Transportation Co. and STX Corp. each
hold 15 percent.  South Korea, which relies on imports for almost all its
corn and wheat needs, is attempting to boost supplies as surging
global food costs fuel inflation. Prices have climbed as bad
weather ruined crops from  Canada  to Australia and Russia banned
grain exports after its worst drought in a half-century.  “It is a national task to secure a stable supply of grains
at a time when grain prices keep on rising because of  population
growth  and unusual changes in weather,” the statement said.  The venture plans to import 50,000 metric tons of corn and
50,000 tons of soybeans this year and further boost shipments to
Korea to about 2.15 million tons by 2015, the statement said.  Trader Samsung C&T will handle marketing for the venture,
while Hanjin will deal with overland transport of grain and STX
will be responsible for maritime shipping, it said.  Corn futures prices have almost doubled in  Chicago  in the
past year, while wheat jumped 56 percent and soybeans climbed 36
percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
