The U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission will return to work on mutual-fund fees “with full
force” once it gets past the July deadline for many Dodd-Frank
Act rules, SEC Commissioner Elisse Walter said.  “Every dollar collected in 12b-1 fees is a dollar deducted
from a fund’s return,” Walter said today in a Washington
speech, referring to fees mutual funds charge for marketing. The
agency will focus attention on the fees again when it clears the
bulk of its Dodd-Frank work, she said in the comments delivered
at a Mutual Fund Directors Forum conference.  The SEC is writing as many as 100 rules required by Dodd-
Frank, the regulatory overhaul enacted last year. Many of the
rules must be completed by July 21, the one-year anniversary of
the law being signed by President  Barack Obama .  On the day Dodd-Frank was enacted, SEC commissioners voted
unanimously on a proposal to increase disclosure and cap fees
investors pay over time. Under the measure, a company couldn’t
charge more in 12b-1 fees for a class of fund shares that
continue to solicit new investors than they charge for classes
that don’t.  The SEC in 1980 allowed mutual funds to charge clients
distribution fees to pay for advertising as the industry
struggled to attract new investors. Those payments amounted to
$9.5 billion in 2009, and money managers are increasingly using
proceeds to pay brokers who sell funds. That has prompted
regulators to re-examine the purpose and need for 12b-1 fees.  To contact the reporter on this story:
