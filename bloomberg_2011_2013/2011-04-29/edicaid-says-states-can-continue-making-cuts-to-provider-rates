States led by  California  can
continue to cut Medicaid payment rates to hospitals and doctors
with little federal oversight, the U.S. said today in a proposed
rule.  The regulation would let states keep the flexibility they
say they need to balance their budgets. The rule was issued
partly in response to a case filed in federal court by
California doctors, according to court filings. The doctors said
that a 10 percent cut to Medicaid payment rates in California
would violate a U.S. law mandating that Medicaid recipients have
access to hospitals, doctors and other health care services.  To contact the reporter on this story:
