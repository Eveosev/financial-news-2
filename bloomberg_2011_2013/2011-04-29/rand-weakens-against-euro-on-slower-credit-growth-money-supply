The rand surged to its strongest
level against the dollar in four months and is set for the
biggest monthly advance this year as investors added to local
assets after the  Federal Reserve  kept rates near zero.  The South African currency rose as much as 0.8 percent to
6.5696 per dollar, its strongest level since Dec. 31. It traded
0.7 percent stronger at 6.5784 per dollar at 3:35 p.m. in
Johannesburg, bringing its gain versus the dollar this month to
4.4 percent, the biggest since December. The rand rose 0.3
percent to 9.7766 per euro.  Fed Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said this week the central
bank will maintain its record monetary stimulus, prompting
investors to buy higher-yielding assets. The Dollar Index headed
for a fifth monthly drop, and gold rose to a record for a third
day. Foreign investors were net buyers of 2.3 billion of South
African stocks and bonds yesterday, according to data from JSE
Ltd., which operates  Africa ’s largest stock exchange.  “We’re seeing a continuation of the trend where the dollar
has failed to make any meaningful recovery,” Sean McCalgan, an
analyst at Econometrix Treasury Management, which advises
clients on currency and bond transactions, said by phone from
Johannesburg. “The dollar just continues to be bashed.”  Emerging-market equity funds attracted inflows for a fifth
straight week, Citigroup Inc. said. The funds lured $1.8 billion
in the week ended April 27, taking inflows in the past five
weeks to $13.8 billion, analysts led by  Markus Rosgen , wrote in
a report today that cited EPFR Global data.  ‘Long-Term Positive’  The rand extended gains after Africa’s biggest economy
posted a trade surplus of 971 million rand ($147 million) in
March compared with a deficit of 350 million rand in February,
the South African Revenue Service said in an e-mailed statement
today. The median estimate of eight economists surveyed by
Bloomberg was for a 800 million-rand deficit.  “The trade data is going to be a long-term positive for
the rand,” McCalgan said.  South African 10-year bonds gained for a fifth day, driving
yields to the lowest level in three weeks, after the National
Treasury said the  budget deficit  shrank in the year through
March. The country posted a deficit of 136.6 billion rand in the
first quarter, compared with 167.6 billion rand the same period
a year earlier. The deficit was 4.9 billion rand in the month,
down from 11.7 billion rand in March 2010, the Treasury said on
its website today.  The 6.75 percent notes due 2021 added 16 cents to 88.51
rand, sending the yield down 3 basis points, or 0.03 percent, to
8.49 percent, the lowest since April 8.  To contact the reporter on this story:
