India’s rupee gained for a third
day on speculation the central bank will raise  interest rates 
next week for a ninth time since March 2010 to curb inflation,
boosting yields on local assets.  The  Reserve Bank  of India will increase its repurchase rate
by a quarter percentage point to 7 percent on May 3, according
to 17 of 22 economists in a Bloomberg News survey. The rest
forecast a half-point increase. The benchmark may end the year
at 7.50 percent, according to Vishnu Varathan at  Capital
Economics  (Asia) Pte.  “Rupee appreciation will continue this year,” said
Singapore-based economist Varathan. “I am probably looking at
another 25 basis-point hike next week.”  The currency rose 0.1 percent to 44.41 per dollar as of
10:01 a.m. in Mumbai, paring this week’s loss to 0.1 percent,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The rupee gained 0.4
percent this month, the second-worst performance among the 10
most-traded Asian currencies excluding the yen.  Offshore forwards indicate the rupee will trade at 45.10 to
the dollar in three months, compared with expectations of 45.13
yesterday. Forwards are agreements to buy or sell assets at a
set price and date. Non-deliverable contracts are settled in
dollars.  The currency headed for a third weekly decline, the longest
losing streak since November, on speculation oil prices near a
31-month high will boost the nation’s import bill.  Crude oil surged 38 percent in the past six months in  New
York  and yesterday touched $113.97 per barrel, the highest level
since September 2008, data compiled by Bloomberg show. India
buys almost 75 percent of the oil it uses from abroad.  To contact the reporters on this story:
