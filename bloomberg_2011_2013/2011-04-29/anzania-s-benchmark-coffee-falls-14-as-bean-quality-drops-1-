Tanzania ’s benchmark coffee grade
fell 14 percent at an auction yesterday as the quality of beans
declined, the Tanzania Coffee Board said.  The average price for the top arabica AA grade dropped to
$251.89 for a 50-kilogram (110-pound) bag, from $292.79 at the
previous sale on April 8, the board said today by e-mail from
Moshi, in northern Tanzania. Supplies of the grade rose 37
percent to 1,653 bags, it said.  The average price for all coffee sold fell by an average of
$38.59 per bag, the agency said.  Supplies at the 31st auction of the 2010-11 season dropped
11 percent to 6,922 60-kilogram (132-pound) bags because of
dwindling stocks, the agency said. The board costs its beans in
terms of 50-kilogram bags, although offers and sales in are 60-
kilogram bags. Sales fell 19 percent to 4,869 bags, it said.  Tanzania reaps its crop from April through August. Arabica
accounts for 75 percent of the country’s output, while robusta
accounts for the rest.  Output in the 12 months through June may climb 54 percent
to about 55,000 from a year earlier because of improved weather,
Adolph Kumburu, the board’s director general, said last month.  The following are details of yesterday’s auction in U.S.
