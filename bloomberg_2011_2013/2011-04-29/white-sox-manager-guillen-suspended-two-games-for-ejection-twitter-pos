Chicago White Sox manager Ozzie Guillen received a two-game suspension from  Major League
Baseball  following his ejection and Twitter comments during the
team’s 3-1 loss to the  New York Yankees  on April 27.  Guillen will serve the suspension during Chicago’s home
games tonight and tomorrow night against the  Baltimore Orioles ,
Commissioner Bud Selig’s office said in an e-mailed release. The
47-year-old manager was also fined an undisclosed amount,
according to the release.  Guillen was ejected from the game in the top of the first
inning after arguing a called third strike. Shortly after the
ejection, he published, “this one going to cost me a lot money
this is patetic,” on his Twitter account. His comments were in
violation of MLB’s social media policy and other regulations
regarding the use of electronic equipment during games, the
release said.  Guillen, who led  Chicago  to a World Series title in 2005,
has managed the White Sox since 2004, posting a 610-551 record
in eight seasons. The ejection was the 26th of Guillen’s career.  To contact the reporter on this story:
