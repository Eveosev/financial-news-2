Asian stocks fell, with a regional
benchmark index dropping for the first time in three days, as
U.S. economic growth and South Korean industrial production
slowed, sparking concern company earnings may falter.  Billabong International Ltd. (BBG) , a surf-wear maker that gets
almost half its sales from the Americas, dropped 1.8 percent in
Sydney.  China  Cosco Holdings Co., Asia’s largest shipping line,
slumped 3.1 percent in Hong Kong after posting a first-quarter
net loss. Air China Ltd., the world’s No. 1 carrier by market
value, lost 2.7 percent after posting lower earnings.  KB
Financial Group Inc. (105560) , owner of  South Korea ’s largest lender,
jumped 5.1 percent after reporting higher earnings.  “At this stage, people are not prepared to give up on the
U.S., but how much of the current earnings are sustainable is an
open question,” said Melbourne-based  Tim Schroeders  of Pengana
Capital Ltd., which manages about $1 billion. “The news has
been fairly good in terms of companies beating expectations.”  The MSCI  Asia  Pacific Excluding  Japan  Index sank 0.5
percent to 505.70 at 5:15 p.m. in Hong Kong, with about two
stocks dropping for each that rose. The measure is heading for a
0.5 percent decline this week after company earnings from
Acer Inc. to LG Electronics Inc. missed analysts’ estimates and
Chinese shares declined on speculation China will further
tighten monetary policy to tame inflation.  Kospi Falls  South Korea’s Kospi Index fell 0.7 percent after a report
showed the nation’s industrial production expanded at a slower
pace in March.  Australia ’s S&P/ASX 200 Index dropped 1 percent.
Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index slipped 0.4 percent. Japanese
markets are closed for a public holiday.  New Zealand ’s  NZX 50 Index (NZSE50FG)  increased 0.4 percent to its
highest close since June 2008 after the nation’s trade surplus
widened by more than twice economists’ estimates in March as
soaring commodity prices and Asian demand boosted exports of
milk powder, butter and cheese to a record.  China’s Shanghai Composite Index climbed 0.9 percent,
erasing losses of as much as 0.6 percent earlier, after a report
showing the country’s manufacturing expanded.  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index lost 0.1 percent.
The gauge rose 0.4 percent in  New York  yesterday as insurers
Allstate Corp. and Aflac Inc. posted earnings that topped
estimates. Investors in the U.S. shrugged off a report that
showed the world’s biggest economy slowed more than forecast in
the first quarter as  government spending  declined by the most
since 1983 and household purchases cooled.  Billabong, Hynix  Gross domestic product in the U.S. rose at a 1.8 percent
annual rate from January through March after a 3.1 percent pace
in the final three months of 2010, the Commerce Department said
yesterday in  Washington . Economists projected 2 percent growth,
according to the median estimate in a Bloomberg News survey.  Billabong dropped 1.8 percent to A$6.75 in Sydney.  Brambles
Ltd. (BXB) , the No. 1 global supplier of wooden pallets, decreased 2.9
percent A$6.73.  Hynix Semiconductor Inc. (000660) , the world’s second-
largest maker of computer-memory chips, declined 1.6 percent to
33,800 won in  Seoul .  South Korea’s factory output climbed 8.7 percent in March
from a year earlier after gaining a revised 9.2 percent in
February, Statistics Korea said today. The median estimate of 14
economists in a Bloomberg News survey was for an 11 percent
advance.  Best Performance  The MSCI Asia Pacific Excluding Japan Index is heading for
a 6.5 percent increase this month, the best performance since
September, as better-than-estimated earnings from U.S. companies
including Apple Inc. and Johnson & Johnson tempered concerns the
global economic recovery is slowing.  About 41 percent of companies on the gauge excluding Japan
that reported earnings since April 11 have exceeded estimates.
That compares 61 percent for the MSCI World Index of developed
stock markets.  Samsung Electronics Co., the world’s largest maker of
televisions and flat-screen panels, slid 0.8 percent to 893,000
won. The company said first-quarter net income fell 30 percent
from a year earlier to 2.78 trillion won ($2.6 billion) as
slowing sales of televisions and flat-screens led to lower
prices.  China Cosco declined 3.1 percent to HK$7.46 in  Hong Kong 
after reporting a net loss of 503 million yuan ($77 million) in
the first quarter as global overcapacity caused a decline in
rates for sea-borne cargo.  Air China  Air China dropped 2.7 percent to HK$7.86 after posting a 23
percent decline in first-quarter profit because of higher fuel
prices and a slowdown in Japan travel following the March 11
earthquake.  Hui Xian Real Estate Investment Trust, Hong Kong’s first
stock sale denominated in yuan, slumped 9.4 percent to 4.75 yuan
in its trading debut after offering the lowest yield among
property trusts in the city.  Backed by an office and retail development in Beijing,
billionaire  Li Ka-shing ’s trust has a forecast yield of 4.26
percent compared with an average estimated yield of 4.85 percent
for Hong Kong-traded real-estate investment trusts.  Among stocks that advanced, KB Financial Group, owner of
South Korea’s largest lender, jumped 5.1 percent to 57,500 won
in Seoul after saying first-quarter net income rose 23 percent
from a year earlier to 757.6 billion won as lending margins
widened and bad-loan provisions fell.  Macquarie Group Ltd. (MQG) , Australia’s biggest investment bank,
gained 0.7 percent to A$35.16 in Sydney after posting second-
half profit that fell less than it forecast because commodities
and equities trading picked up and deal-making increased.  The MSCI Asia Pacific Excluding Japan Index climbed 6.1
percent this year through yesterday, compared with gains of 8.2
percent by the S&P 500 and 2.6 percent by the Stoxx Europe 600
Index. Stocks in the Asian benchmark are valued at 13.3 times
estimated earnings on average as of the last close, compared
with 13.8 times for the S&P 500 and 11.5 times for the Stoxx 600.  To contact the reporters on this story:
