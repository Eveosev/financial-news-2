CarMax Inc. (KMX) â€™s bullish options
volume jumped to a 17-month high as investors boosted bets that

month.  Almost 12,000 calls to buy the stock changed hands as of 1
p.m. in  New York , 18 times the four-week average and 23 times
the number of puts to sell. May $33 calls accounted for about
four-fifths of all volume as the shares climbed 3.6 percent to
$34.74, the highest intraday since March 9.  To contact the reporter on this story:
