The Australian dollar rose to a
record and gained the most in a month since December after
Treasurer Wayne Swan said the currency’s strength reflects an
improving economy and higher commodity prices.  The Aussie advanced for a sixth week versus the greenback
as slower U.S. growth stoked speculation the  Reserve Bank  of
Australia will raise  interest rates  before the  Federal Reserve .
New Zealand’s dollar had its biggest monthly jump since 2009 as
exports rose to a record.  “Helping the Aussie is the strong economic performance of
Australia, a continuation of the commodities boom,” said  Imre Speizer , a market strategist in Auckland, New Zealand, at
Westpac Banking Corp. “The kiwi has maintained an uptrend that
started in the middle of March.”  The Australian dollar rose 0.4 percent to $1.0971 at 5:19
p.m. in  New York , from $1.0929 yesterday, extending its monthly
gain to 6.2 percent and its weekly rally to 2.2 percent. It
touched $1.0978, highest level since the Aussie began trading
freely in 1983.  New Zealand ’s currency appreciated 0.9 percent to 80.99
U.S. cents. The kiwi appreciated 6.4 percent in April, the
biggest gain since a 13 percent increase in May 2009.  The Aussie’s gain reflects the strength of the Australian
economy, public finances, the job market and commodity prices,
Swan said in a radio interview with Australian Broadcasting
Corp. in Brisbane.  Raw Materials  The Thomson Reuters/Jefferies CRB Index of 19 raw materials
surged 35 percent over the past year. Gold climbed today to a
record $1,569.32 an ounce.  Traders added to bets the RBA will increase interest rates,
according to a Credit Suisse Group AG index based on swaps. The
central bank will boost borrowing costs by 25 basis points, or
0.25 percentage point, over the next 12 months, compared with a
forecast of 19 basis points last week.  Consumer prices in  Australia  increased 1.6 percent last
quarter from the previous three months, the biggest jump since
2006, the Bureau of Statistics said April 27.  To contact the reporter on this story:
