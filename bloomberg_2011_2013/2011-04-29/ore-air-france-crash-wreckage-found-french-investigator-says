More wreckage of the Air France
plane that crashed into the Atlantic Ocean in June 2009 has been
found, French investigators said, adding that they are still
looking for the data unit of the black boxes.  The forward and aft parts of the plane were broken apart,
requiring a “time-consuming systematic search,” they said. The
search for the flight recorders remains the priority for
investigators.  The crash of the flight from  Rio de Janeiro  to Paris killed
all 228 passengers and crew.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
