NextEra Energy Inc. (NEE) , the largest
U.S. generator of wind power, is exploring a sale of five
natural-gas plants with about 2,700 megawatts of capacity in
five states.  The company may sell units including an 879-megawatt
Doswell plant in Ashland, Virginia, a 507-megawatt plant in
Blythe, California, a 550-megawatt facility in Johnston, Rhode
Island, a 668-megawatt plant in Eastaboga, Alabama, and a 98-
megawatt plant in Gaffney,  South Carolina , Chief Financial
Officer Armando Pimentel said today during a conference call
with investors.  The facilities are located in regions where NextEra doesn’t
own other assets and recent transactions of similar facilities
have fetched “attractive” prices, Pimentel said during the
call. “We thought it would be the right time to explore the
opportunity to sell,” he said.  NextEra, based in  Juno Beach , Florida, did not say how much
it expected to get for any potential sale.  To contact the reporter on this story:
