India ’s crude oil output rose for
the 16th straight month in March as non-state companies
including  Cairn India Ltd. (CAIR)  boosted production.  Asia ’s second-biggest energy consumer pumped 3.3 million
metric tons of oil last month, a 12 percent increase from a year
earlier, the  oil ministry  said in a statement today.  Production by non-state explorers climbed 83 percent to
917,865 tons. Output from Rajasthan state, where Cairn India
operates the country’s biggest onshore oil deposit, surged
almost sevenfold to 541,300 tons, according to the data. Cairn
India started output at the field in August 2009.  Output by state-owned Oil & Natural Gas Corp., the nation’s
largest energy explorer, fell 3.5 percent to 2.1 million tons
from a year earlier, according to the ministry.  ONGC’s Mumbai High fields produced 1.4 million tons, a
decline of 5.4 percent. The fields, 100 miles (160 kilometers)
northwest of Mumbai in the  Arabian Sea , account for about 43
percent of India’s oil production.  Oil India Ltd. (OINL) , the second-biggest state-run crude
producer, reported a 4.9 percent increase in output to 323,900
tons, according to the statement.  Natural gas output in India fell for the fourth straight
month, declining 11 percent to 4.3 billion cubic meters,
according to the data.  Reliance Industries Ltd. (RIL) , India’s biggest company by market
value, cut production from the country’s biggest gas field,
located off the east coast, to 50 million cubic meters a day
from a maximum level of 60 million because of reduced pressure
in the reservoir.  To contact the reporter on this story:
