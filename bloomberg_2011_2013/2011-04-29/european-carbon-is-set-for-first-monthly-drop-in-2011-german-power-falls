European Union carbon permits fell
along with German power, resulting in this year’s first monthly
decline for allowances.  EU permits for December closed 0.4 percent lower at 17.14
euros ($25.40) a metric ton today on  London ’s European Climate
Exchange. They fell 0.8 percent in April, paring this year’s
gain to 20 percent.  German baseload power for next year, a European benchmark,
dropped 0.2 percent to 59.20 euros a megawatt-hour today in
Berlin, according to broker prices on Bloomberg. The contract
fell 1 percent this month, slipping from a more than 19-months
high logged on April 5 following Germany’s decision to shut the
oldest nuclear reactors for a safety review after the nuclear
crisis in  Japan .  To contact the reporter on this story:
