Most Canadian stocks rose, led by
banks and insurers, after U.S. forces killed Osama  bin Laden  and
a gauge of U.S. manufacturing dropped less than most economists
had forecast.  Manulife Financial Corp. (MFC) ,  North America ’s fourth-largest
insurer, advanced 3 percent after U.S. President  Barack Obama 
said  Osama bin Laden  is dead.  Silver Wheaton Corp. (SLW) , Canada’s
fourth-biggest precious-metals company, tumbled 6.7 percent
after CME Group Inc. raised the amount of cash that traders must
deposit for speculative positions in silver.  Valeant
Pharmaceuticals International Inc. (VRX) , Canada’s largest drugmaker,
slumped 5.5 percent after Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd.
outbid it for Cephalon Inc.  The Standard & Poor’s/TSX Composite Index slipped 10.28
points, or 0.1 percent, to 13,934.51 as the plunge in precious
metals outweighed gains in other stocks. Among S&P/TSX
companies, 126 advanced, 114 declined and eight were unchanged.  “The whole thing with Osama bin Laden is definitely a
positive,” said Sadiq Adatia, chief investment officer at
Russell Investments  Canada , which manages C$12 billion ($12.6
billion). “People will be able to put this behind them now and
focus on the economy.”  The S&P/TSX lost 1 percent with dividends included last
month, its first negative total return since June.  Energy producers and banks led the retreat last month as
data and forecasts indicated a slowing economic recovery,
especially in the U.S. The Canadian stock benchmark’s price
relative to earnings climbed to an eight-year high in April
versus the price-earnings ratio of the  S&P 500 .  Manufacturing Index  The Institute for Supply Management’s measure of U.S.
manufacturing fell to 60.4 last month from 61.2 in March, the
Temple, Arizona-based organization said. Economists had forecast
a reading of 59.5, according to the median of 78 estimates in a
Bloomberg survey.  The S&P/TSX Financials Index gained the most in seven days.  Manulife increased 3 percent to C$17.50.  Bank of Nova
Scotia (BNS) , Canada’s third-largest lender by assets, climbed 1.2
percent to C$58.40.  National Bank of Canada (NA) , the No. 6 bank in
the country, rose 1.7 percent to C$79.65.  TransCanada Corp. (TRP) , the owner of Canada’s largest pipeline
system, gained 2.2 percent, the most in almost a year, to
C$41.62 as at least six analysts boosted their share-price
estimates. On April 29, the Calgary-based company reported
first-quarter profit and revenue that topped the average analyst
forecast.  Margin Raised  Silver fell more than 10 percent in after-market trading
after the CME, the parent of the Comex exchange, raised initial
margins by 13 percent.  Silver Wheaton Corp., Canada’s fourth-largest precious-
metals producer by market value, decreased 6.7 percent to
C$35.93.  Silver Standard Resources Inc. (SSO) , which mines in  Latin
America , tumbled 9.6 percent, the most in 26 months, to C$29.76.
 Silvercorp Metals Inc. (SVM) , which operates in  China , sank 9.4
percent, the most since July 2009, to C$11.67.  Gold futures declined in after-market trading as the  U.S.
dollar  advanced against a basket of world currencies for the
first time in 10 days.  Goldcorp Inc. (G) , the world’s second-largest
gold producer, lost 5.2 percent, the most since July, to
C$50.12.  Barrick Gold Corp. (ABX) , the world’s biggest producer of the
metal, decreased 2.2 percent to C$47.24.  Centerra Gold Inc. (CG) , which mines in Kyrgyzstan and Mongolia,
increased 6.3 percent to C$18.70 after its first-quarter profit
beat the average of nine analyst estimates by 74 percent,
excluding certain items. The company also raised its annual
dividend by 67 percent to 10 Canadian cents a share and said it
will pay a special dividend of 30 Canadian cents a share.  Outbid  Valeant sank 5.5 percent, the most since June 2009, to
C$47.18 after Cephalon agreed to be bought by Petah Tikvah,
Israel-based Teva for $81.50 a share. Valeant had made an
unsolicited offer of $73 a share in March for Frazer,
Pennsylvania-based Cephalon.  Trucking company  TransForce Inc. (TFI)  surged 6 percent to
C$14.94, the highest close since May 2007. David F. Newman, an
analyst at Cormark Securities Inc., raised his rating on the
shares to “buy” from “market perform” a business day after
the Saint-Laurent, Quebec-based company said it will buy DHL
Express Canada’s domestic business.  In a note to clients, Newman said the deal will provide
“pricing improvement, scale efficiencies and revenue and cost
synergies.”  Extendicare Real Estate Investment Trust (EXE-U) , which owns 265
senior-care centers in the U.S. and Canada, lost 4.7 percent to
C$11.33 to extend its two-day retreat to 14 percent. The shares
tumbled after the U.S. Health & Human Services Department
proposed a rate cut for skilled-nursing facilities on April 29.  To contact the reporter on this story:
