TenneT Holding BV said it is
holding talks with parties that could invest in two of its
electricity cables that will connect wind parks off the German
coast to the grid on the mainland.  The company, which is based in Arnhem, the Netherlands, may
receive expressions of interest in the BorWin 1 and BorWin 2
links next week, Joelle Bouillon, a TenneT spokeswoman, said in
an e-mailed response to questions from Bloomberg News today.  Mel Kroon, TenneTâ€™s chief executive officer, said in
January that the grid operator is considering partnerships on
offshore cables, in which it would keep a majority stake, to
share the necessary investments.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
