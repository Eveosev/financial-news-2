The  Ohio River  Valley and the
northern U.S. will probably receive more rain than normal
through May 13, according to the  U.S. Climate Prediction Center .  Rain this year has pushed the Ohio and Mississippi rivers
toward record flooding, according to the  National Weather
Service .  The Ohio River at Cairo, Illinois, is at 59.03 feet and is
expected to match the 1937 record of 59.5 feet at 7 p.m.
tomorrow, according to the weather service. The  Mississippi
River  at  New Madrid, Missouri , is forecast to reach a record
height of 48 feet next week, also breaking a 1937 mark.  Texas and parts of the southern U.S. are experiencing
severe drought. The centerâ€™s 6- to 10-day and 8- to 14-day
outlooks call for the South to receive less rain than normal
through May 13.  To contact the reporter on this story:
