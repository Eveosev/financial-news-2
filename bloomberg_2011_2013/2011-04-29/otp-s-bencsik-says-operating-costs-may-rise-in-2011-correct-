(Corrects to operating costs, not risk costs, may rise.)  OTP Bank Nyrt.,  Hungary ’s biggest
lender, may see its operating costs rise this year, Chief
Financial Officer Laszlo Bencsik said.  “It’s likely that what we achieved last year, namely that
costs didn’t rise in nominal terms, we won’t be able to achieve
this year,” Bencsik said at the bank’s shareholders meeting in
Budapest today. Costs will be driven higher by inflation and
growing capacity in certain markets where OTP operates, he said.  The outlook for risk costs and portfolio deterioration is
uncertain as these depend on outside factors such as currency
exchange rates and the regulatory environment, Bencsik said.  Risk costs will sooner or later decline, boosting
profitability, he said.  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
