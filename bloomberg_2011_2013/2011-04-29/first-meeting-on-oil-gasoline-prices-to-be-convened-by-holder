Attorney General  Eric Holder  next
week will convene the first meeting of government investigators
examining whether oil and gasoline prices are being driven
higher by illegal manipulation.  The officials will meet on May 2 at the  Justice Department 
in Washington, the department said in a statement today.  The Obama administration announced on April 21 that
representatives of the Justice Department, other federal
agencies and state attorneys general will monitor for fraud,
collusion or misrepresentation at the retail and wholesale
level. The group also will examine the role of speculators and
traders in oil futures markets.  With the 2012 presidential campaign looming, President
Barack Obama faces increasing political pressure over rising
gasoline prices. Previous administrations have conducted similar
inquiries after gasoline price spikes.  Holder told reporters at a news conference this week “at
least a couple of things” are “disturbing” in the energy
markets, and they will be examined. He declined to elaborate.  To contact the reporter on this story:
