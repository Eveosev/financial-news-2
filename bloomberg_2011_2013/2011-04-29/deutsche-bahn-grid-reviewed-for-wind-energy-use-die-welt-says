The German government commissioned
a review Deutsche Bahn AG’s power grid to study whether it can
be used to transport electricity generated at wind farms in
northern  Germany , Die Welt reported.  The move is part of a plan to boost renewable energy
production as support for nuclear power declined in Germany
after the Fukushima Dai-Ichi power plant accident in  Japan , the
newspaper said in a preview of an article for tomorrow’s
edition.  To contact the reporter on this story:
