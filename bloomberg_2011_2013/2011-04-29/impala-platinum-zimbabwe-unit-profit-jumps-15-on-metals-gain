Impala Platinum Holdings Ltd. (IMP) ’s
Zimbabwe unit posted a 15 percent increase in profit in its
fiscal third quarter, helped by metal price gains, even as the
government boosted royalty rates.  Operating profit, the only earnings figure given, increased
to $65.6 million in the three months through March from $57
million a year earlier, Zimbabwe Holdings Ltd. said in a
statement today. Production dropped 10 percent to 85,069 ounces.  Platinum rose 15 percent to an average $1,792.69 an ounce
in the quarter from a year earlier. The company, known as
Zimplats, also produces gold, which rallied 25 percent to $1,388
an ounce. The government’s royalty rates were lifted by an
average 18 percentage points from January, Zimplats said.  Impala, the world’s second-largest producer of the metal,
owns 87 percent of the Zimbabwe unit.  To contact the reporter on this story:
