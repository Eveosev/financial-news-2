China ’s Shanghai Composite Index
erased gains as banks declined on concern growth in net interest
margins will slow. Power producers advanced on speculation the
government will allow them to raise prices.  The benchmark index was little changed at 2,886.46 as of
1:22 p.m. local time, reversing an advance of 0.3 percent. More
than two stocks gained for each that fell on the gauge.  To contact the reporter on this story:
