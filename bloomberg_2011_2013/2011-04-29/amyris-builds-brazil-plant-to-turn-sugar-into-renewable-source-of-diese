Amyris Inc. (AMRS) , a U.S. biotechnology
company, built its first industrial-scale facility to produce
from sugar-cane syrup a compound that can be converted into a
renewable fuel, tapping  Brazil ’s expansive cane industry for
feedstock.  The plant in  Sao Paulo  state on a property owned by Biomin
do Brasil Nutricao Animal Ltda. will go into production next
month, Emeryville, California-based Amyris said today in a
statement. It will make farnesene, a compound that can be
processed further into diesel or lubricants.  Brazil, the world’s largest sugar producer, is expected to
crush 568.5 million tons of sugar cane this harvest, 2.1 percent
more than last year, the Sao Paulo-based cane industry
association Uniao da Industria de Cana-de-Acucar said in a
 statement .  Amyris, which will operate the plant, will spend less than
$20 million for the facility that initially will generate 2.5
million liters a year, Chief Executive Officer John Melo said by
telephone. It will be scaled up to produce 17 million liters in
18 months, he said.  In Brazil, the company is developing farnesene-production
plants with the Pradopolis-based ethanol producer  Sao Martinho
SA (SMTO3)  that may produce 100 million liters a year, he said, and
another with Paraiso Bioenergia SA, according to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
