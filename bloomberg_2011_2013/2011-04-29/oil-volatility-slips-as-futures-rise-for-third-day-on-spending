Oil options volatility slipped as
the underlying futures increased for a third day as better-than-
expected  consumer spending  signaled fuel demand may climb.  Implied volatility for at-the-money options expiring in
June, a measure of expected price swings in futures and a gauge
of options prices, was 26.1 percent as of 4 p.m. in  New York ,
down from 26.4 percent yesterday.  Crude for June delivery increased $1.07, or 1 percent, to
$113.93 a barrel, the highest settlement since Sept. 22, 2008,
on the  New York Mercantile Exchange . Futures gained 6.8 percent
in April for an unprecedented eighth straight monthly advance.
Oil rose 1.5 percent this week and 34 percent in the past year.  Volatility slipped as prices moved an average of 36 cents
per day so far this week, compared with an average daily change
of $1.93 last week.  The most active contracts in electronic trading were June
$105 puts with 2,812 lots changing hands. They fell 12 cents to
28 cents a barrel. June $100 puts, the next-most active option,
dropped 1 cent to 9 cents a barrel with 2,408 contracts trading.
One contract covers 1,000 barrels of oil.  Nymex distributes real-time data for electronic trading and
releases information on floor trading, where the bulk of options
trading occurs, the next business day.  June $105 puts were the most active options traded in the
previous session, with 5,875 lots changing hands. They lost 7
cents to 40 cents a barrel. The next-most active option, August
$120 calls, gained 9 cents to $3.55 a barrel on 5,048 lots.  Open interest was highest for December 2012 $80 puts with
44,509 contracts. Next were June $150 calls with 44,101 and
