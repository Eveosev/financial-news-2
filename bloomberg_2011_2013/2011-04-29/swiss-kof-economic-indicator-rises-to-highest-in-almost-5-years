Switzerland ’s leading economic
indicator unexpectedly increased in April, indicating the
economy is gaining momentum.  The monthly gauge that aims to predict the economy’s
direction about six months ahead climbed to 2.29 compared with a
revised 2.25 in March, the  KOF Swiss Economic Institute  in
Zurich said in an e-mailed statement today. That’s the highest
since August 2006. Economists expected a decline to 2.20,
according to the median of seven in a Bloomberg News survey.  “The growth of the Swiss economy should proceed
dynamically,” the KOF institute said in its statement. Swiss
gross domestic product expansion “should remain positive and
even exhibit some increasing momentum.”  Switzerland’s economy is gathering pace as low unemployment
spurs private consumption and strong demand from  Asia  and the
euro area bolsters exports. The Swiss central bank last month
raised its forecast for 2011 economic growth to about 2 percent
from 1.5 percent previously and  ABB Ltd. (ABBN) , the world’s largest
maker of power-transmission gear, this week said first-quarter
profit rose 41 percent as demand for automation equipment
improved.  To contact the reporter on this story:
