Ethanol futures surged the most in
four weeks in  Chicago  on concern that wet weather in the Midwest
will delay corn planting and raise costs for distilling the
grain into the gasoline additive.  The alternative fuel rose 3.4 percent, following corn
higher amid forecasts for rain in the Midwest that would make it
difficult for farmers to get equipment into fields. Corn is the
primary feedstock for ethanol in the U.S.  “As we get closer to summer this becomes more and more of
a weather market, not even supply and demand,” said Jim Damask,
a manager at BiofuelsConnect, a Heathrow, Florida-based
alternative energy broker.  Denatured ethanol for May delivery advanced 8.6 cents, or
3.4 percent, to $2.649 a gallon on the Chicago Board of Trade,
the steepest one-day gain since March 31 and the highest price
since April 13. Prices have declined 0.3 percent this month.  In cash market trading ethanol on the West Coast slipped 2
cents, or 0.7 percent, to $2.77 a gallon and in Chicago the
additive lost 2 cents, or 0.8 percent, to $2.63, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  Ethanol in  New York  fell 1.5 cents, or 0.6 percent, to
$2.735 a gallon and in the U.S. Gulf the biofuel rose 1 cent, or
0.4 percent, to $2.745.  Corn for July delivery climbed 27.25 cents, or 3.7 percent,
to $7.565 a bushel in Chicago.  Average ethanol mills in  Iowa  are losing 2 cents on every
gallon produced, while plants in  Illinois  are losing 3 cents
spot basis, according to Ag Trader Talk, an online grains
information service in Clive, Iowa.  To contact the reporter on this story:
