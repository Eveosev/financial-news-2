March 2011, the  U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics  reported
today. Wages and salaries (which make up about 70 percent of
compensation costs) increased 0.4 percent, and benefits
(which make up the remaining 30 percent of compensation)
increased 1.1 percent.  Civilian Workers  Compensation costs for civilian workers increased 2.0
percent for the 12-month period ending March 2011. A year
earlier--in March 2010--the increase was 1.7 percent. Wages
and salaries increased 1.6 percent for the current 12-month
period; in March 2010 the increase was 1.5 percent. Benefit
costs accelerated to 3.0 percent, up from a 2.2-percent

increased 2.0 percent over the year, compared to the 1.6-

and salary series increased 1.6 percent for the current 12-
month period.  The change for the 12-month period ending
March 2010 was 1.5 percent. The cost of benefits increased
3.0 percent for the 12-month period ending March 2011,
higher than the March 2010 increase of 2.0 percent. While
the rate of increase in the overall cost of benefits to
employers accelerated over the year, their costs for health
benefits decelerated to a 3.4 percent increase for the 12-
month period ending March 2011. In March 2010, the 12-month
percent change was 4.5 percent.  Among occupational groups, compensation cost increases
for private industry workers for the 12-month period ending
March 2011 were 1.4 percent for natural resources,
construction, and maintenance occupations; 1.9 percent for
service occupations; and 2.1 percent for the remaining three
groups--management, professional, and related; sales and
office; and production, transportation, and material moving
occupations.  Among industry supersectors, compensation cost
increases for private industry workers for the current 12-
month period ranged from 0.6 percent for construction to 2.8
percent for both manufacturing and financial activities.  State and Local Government Workers  Compensation costs for State and local government
workers increased 1.8 percent for the 12-month period ending
March 2011, compared to the 2.0 percent for the 12-month
period ending March 2010. Prior to this quarter, values for
this series--which began in June 1982--ranged from
1.7 percent in June 2010 to 9.6 percent in June 1982. Wages
and salaries increased 1.2 percent for the 12-month period
ending March 2011. A year earlier the increase was 1.6
percent. Prior values for this series, which also began in
June 1982, ranged from 1.2 percent in September and December
2010 to 8.5 percent in June 1982. Benefit costs increased
3.3 percent, up from 2.5 percent in March 2010. Prior values
for this series, which began in June 1990, ranged from 1.2
percent in December 1997 to 8.3 percent in June 1990.  The Employment Cost Index for June 2011 is scheduled to
be released on Friday, July 29, 2011, at 8:30 a.m. (EDT).  This release incorporates annual revisions in
seasonally adjusted Employment Cost Index (ECI) data for
total compensation, wages and salaries, and benefit costs.
Seasonally adjusted data for 2006-2010 were revised to
reflect updated seasonal factors.  Some Employment Cost Index estimates from June 2009
through September 2010 were corrected on January 18, 2011.
(In some of the seasonally adjusted series, corrections were
made to estimates back to June 2005.) For further
information, see:
www.bls.gov/bls/eci_corrections_111910.htm  TECHNICAL NOTE  The Employment Cost Index (ECI) measures the change in
the cost of labor, free from the influence of employment
shifts among occupations and industries. Detailed
information on survey concepts, coverage, and methods can be
found in BLS Handbook of Methods, Chapter 8, "National
Compensation Measures," Bureau of Labor Statistics, on the
Internet at  http://www.bls.gov/opub/hom/pdf/homch8.pdf .  Sample size  Data for the March 2011 reference period were collected
from a probability sample of approximately 62,500
occupational observations selected from a sample of about
12,800 establishments in private industry and approximately
11,500 occupations from a sample of about 1,800
establishments in State and local governments.  Health insurance data  Data from the ECI that provide 12-month percent changes
in employer costs for health insurance in private industry
are available at www.bls.gov/ect/sp/echealth.pdf.  Historical listings  Historical listings that provide all ECI data are
available at www.bls.gov/ect/#tables. Included among these
listings is one that provides continuous occupational and
industry series. This listing uses the Standard Industrial
Classification Manual and Census of Population series
through 2005 and the North American Industry Classification
System and Standard Occupational Classification from 2006 to
the present. It provides the official series from the
beginning of the ECI in 1975 through the current quarter.
For more information on the criteria used in defining
continuous series, see the article published in the Monthly
Labor Review at
 http://www.bls.gov/opub/mlr/2006/04/art2full.pdf .  Employer Costs for Employee Compensation data  The costs per hour worked of compensation components,
based on data from the ECI, are published in a separate news
release titled "Employer Costs for Employee Compensation"
(ECEC). The next ECEC release is scheduled for 10:00 a.m.
(EDT), Wednesday, June 8, 2011. Historical ECEC data are
available in summary documents. Since the ECEC is calculated
with current employment weights rather than the fixed
weights used in computing the ECI, year-to-year changes in
the cost levels usually differ from those in the ECI.  To contact the reporter on this story:
