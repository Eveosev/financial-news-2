Oman crude rose for a ninth month,
reaching the highest since its September 2008 record, as a
doubling in refining profits boosted demand.  The June official selling price for Oman oil will be
$116.51 a barrel, based on the average of daily futures
settlement prices on the Dubai Mercantile Exchange, according to
a statement by the exchange today. That is 6.9 percent above
May’s price of $108.95. Today’s settlement at 12:30 p.m. Dubai
time was $118.58, the exchange said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
