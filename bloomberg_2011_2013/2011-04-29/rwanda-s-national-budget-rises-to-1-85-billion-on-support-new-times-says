Rwanda’s national budget will climb
to 1.116 trillion francs ($1.85 billion) in the 2011-2012 fiscal
year, from 984 billion francs in the previous 12 months, boosted
by international financial support, the  New Times reported .  The increase is largely due to support from the  Global Fund
to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria , which is contributing
74 billion francs to combat the illnesses, the Kigali-based
newspaper said, citing John Rwangombwa, the minister of finance
and economic planning.  To contact the reporter on this story:
