South Africa ’s rand extended gains
against the dollar after  Africa ’s largest economy posted an
unexpected trade surplus in March.  The rand gained as much as 0.5 percent to 6.5915 per
dollar, compared with 6.5975 before the data were released, from
6.6248 yesterday. It was trading at 6.5947 against the U.S.
currency as of 2:12 p.m. in Johannesburg.  South Africa posted a trade surplus of 971 million rand
($147 million) in March compared with a deficit of 350 million
rand in February, the South African Revenue Service said in an
e-mailed statement today. The median estimate of eight
economists surveyed by Bloomberg was for a 800 million-rand
deficit.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
