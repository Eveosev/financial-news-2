China Citic Bank Corp., the lending
unit of the nation’s largest investment firm, said first-quarter
profit climbed 51 percent, beating analysts’ estimates, as
lending and fee income increased.  Net income rose to 6.5 billion yuan ($1 billion), or 0.17
yuan a share, from 4.3 billion yuan, or 0.11 yuan, a year
earlier, the Beijing-based lender said in a statement to the
 Hong Kong  stock exchange today. That exceeded the 6.2 billion
yuan median estimate of nine analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  The lender, controlled by China Citic Group, said customer
deposits grew 4 percent from the end of last year to 1.8
trillion yuan. The bank had 1,322 outlets in the country at the
end of last year, less than a tenth of the 16,232 outlets of
rival  Industrial & Commercial Bank of China (1398)  Ltd., the world’s
largest lender by profit.  Citic Bank said outstanding loans expanded 2.7 percent from
the end of last year to 1.3 trillion yuan. Capital adequacy
ratio, a key measure of financial strength, narrowed from the
end of last year to 11.05 percent, it said.  Shares of Citic Bank fell 1.4 percent to close at HK$5.56.
The stock has advanced 9.7 percent in the past year, compared
with a 14 percent increase in the benchmark  Hang Seng Index. (HSI)   To contact the reporter on this story:
