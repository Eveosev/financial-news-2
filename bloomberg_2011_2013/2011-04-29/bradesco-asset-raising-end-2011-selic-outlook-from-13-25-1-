Bradesco Asset Management Ltd. is
raising its estimate for  Brazil ’s benchmark Selic interest rate
at the end of this year from 13.25 percent after the central
bank said accelerating inflation calls for a “prolonged”
tightening cycle.  BRAM, as Brazil’s third-largest asset manager is known, is
also revising its estimate for the currency from between 1.58 to
1.60 reais per dollar, Superintendent-Director Denise Pavarina
said today in an interview on the sideline of the World Economic
Forum on Latin America in Rio de Janeiro. She didn’t provide the
new estimates.  The asset management unit of  Banco Bradesco SA (BBDC4) , Brazil’s
second-biggest bank by market value, will cut its projection for
the Bovespa index to a level that’s lower than the current
estimate of 85,000 points, Pavarina said.  “There is a natural migration from equities to fixed
income, but we think it’s just a correction,” she said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
