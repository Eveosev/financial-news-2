The  Federal Aviation Administration 
is reassigning three air-traffic managers, including one who
oversees all U.S. takeoffs and departures, after controllers
were caught sleeping and watching a movie on duty.  The head of terminal operations and the chief of en-route
airspace, who is in charge of cruise-altitude and ocean flights,
are being moved to new positions along with a manager at a
Cleveland center where a controller watched a movie, the agency
said in a statement today.  The moves add to the FAA’s actions taken after a string of
reports of controllers caught sleeping on the job, watching a
movie and bringing planes too close together, including one
carrying First Lady Michelle Obama.  “This is just the beginning of the process,”
Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood said in the statement today.  Henry Krakowski, the head of air-traffic control
operations, resigned April 14, the day after the agency said it
would double-staff towers on overnight shifts. The agency has
fired or suspended 10 workers and increased the minimum time off
between controller shifts to nine hours from eight.  The FAA also announced two new panels today -- one of FAA
executives examining operations at its most complex facilities,
including air-route centers in  Cleveland  and  New York , and one
including outside academics that will review training,
qualifications and placement of controllers.  “I am confident our top-to-bottom review is making our air
traffic system even safer,” FAA Administrator  Randy Babbitt 
said in the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
