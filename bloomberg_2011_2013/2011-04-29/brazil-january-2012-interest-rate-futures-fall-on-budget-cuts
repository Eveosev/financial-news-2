Yields on most Brazilian interest-
rate futures contracts maturing in 2012 or later fell after the
 Finance Ministry  said Brazil will cancel spending from previous
budgets, prompting bets the central bank may rely less on
interest-rate increases to tame inflation.  The yield on the interest-rate futures contracts due in
January fell two basis points, or 0.02 percentage point, to
12.31 percent at 5:15 p.m. in New York. The yield on the
contract due in January 2016 fell three basis points to 12.56
percent.  Brazil will cancel planned spending from previous budgets
that may reduce public expenditures by as much as 10 billion
reais ($6.4 billion), the Finance Ministry said in a statement
posted on its website. The central bank announced earlier today
that the country’s budget surplus before interest payments rose
to 13.6 billion reais in March, the highest level for the month
since at least 2001.  The fiscal results and additional cuts “reinforce a
strategy of less interest-rate hikes,” said  Roberto Padovani ,
chief-economist at Banco WestLB do Brasil SA in  Sao Paulo .  The primary surplus, which includes federal and local
governments as well as state companies, rose from 7.9 billion
reais in February, the central bank said in a statement
distributed today in Brasilia. The surplus was more than the
12.1 billion reais median forecast in a Bloomberg survey of 12
analysts.  The  budget deficit  narrowed to 6.9 billion reais, from 11.2
billion reais in February, the central bank said.  “The numbers were reasonably good, but the economy needs
to cool down more,” Eduardo Galasini, head of proprietary
trading at Banco Banif Primus in Sao Paulo, said in a telephone
interview. The March fiscal results and new cuts “show the
government is being pro-active in the fiscal area,” he said.  Reverse Swaps  Brazil ’s real rose 0.2 percent to 1.5754 per dollar,
extending its monthly gain to 4.5 percent, the biggest since
February 2010.  Policy makers said they purchased the U.S. currency in the
 spot market  twice today, first at 1.5737 reais per dollar and
then at 1.5707 reais.  The central bank said it placed 25,800 of 30,000 reverse
currency swap contracts offered at an auction today. The
contracts mature in August 2011. Reverse swaps pay investors the
overnight  interbank rate  in reais in exchange for a fixed
interest rate in dollars.  To contact the reporters on this story:
