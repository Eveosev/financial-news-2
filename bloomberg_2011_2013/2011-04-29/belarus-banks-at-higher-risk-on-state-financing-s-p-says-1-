Belarus banks are facing increased
risks to their financial strength as the government’s ability to
support the economy is shrinking,  Standard & Poor’s  said.  “We have observed the banks’ rapid accumulation of loans,
mainly to state-related entities, which we believe could put a
significant strain on the sector’s internal resources,” Moscow-
based S&P credit analyst Sergey Voronenko said in a statement.
“If the government is unable to refinance its external
liabilities, it could hamper these entities’ ability to service
their debt.”  The former Soviet republic, which is seeking a $3 billion
bailout led by Russia, is working to overcome a currency
shortage that led to the ruble’s plunge after the central bank
lifted some restrictions for interbank trading on April 19.
Lenders including Belarusbank, the nation’s largest, stopped
selling foreign currency to customers.  Belarus has been using the local banking system to help
shore up its economy and unless the government is able to
reverse the downward economic trend, the banking system will
face steadily deteriorating asset quality and earnings erosion,
the report said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
