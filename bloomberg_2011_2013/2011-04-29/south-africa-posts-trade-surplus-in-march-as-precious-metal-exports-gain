South Africa  posted a trade surplus
of 971 million rand ($147 million) in March after exports of
precious metals, such as platinum, climbed.  The surplus compared with a deficit of 350 million rand in
February, the South African Revenue Service said in an e-mailed
statement today. The median estimate of eight economists
surveyed by Bloomberg was for a 800 million-rand deficit.  A rebound in global demand has boosted South African
exports of gold and platinum, helping to narrow the current
account deficit, which slid to a seven-year low in the fourth
quarter. That’s eased pressure on the rand, underpinning the
currency’s 5.7 percent gain against the dollar in the past six
months.  Exports increased 15 percent to 60.2 billion rand in March
from the previous month as shipments of precious metals jumped
by 2.2 billion rand, or 17 percent, the revenue service said.
Imports rose 13 percent to 59 billion rand in the period.  Trade figures are often volatile, reflecting the timing of
shipments of commodities such as oil and diamonds.  To contact the reporter on this story:
