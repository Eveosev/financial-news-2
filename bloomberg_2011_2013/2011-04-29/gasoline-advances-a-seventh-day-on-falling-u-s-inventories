Gasoline rose on speculation that
stockpiles will fall an 11th consecutive week after a power
outage curtailed production at three  Texas  refineries.  Futures recorded a record eighth straight monthly increase
as BP Plc and Valero Energy Corp. worked to restart production
at their refineries in  Texas City , Texas, four days after first
losing power. U.S. inventories are at a 20-month low before the
summer driving season.  “The factors that have boosted gasoline to two-and-a-half
year highs are still in play, falling stockpiles, lower refinery
rates and no significant sign of demand destruction,” said  Gene McGillian , an analyst and broker at Tradition Energy in
 Stamford ,  Connecticut . “But we’re starting to get further and
further overextended.”  Gasoline for May delivery rose 3.5 cents, or 1 percent, to
settle at $3.4648 a gallon on the  New York Mercantile Exchange ,
gaining 4.7 percent this week. The more actively traded June
contract advanced 2.88 cents, or 0.9 percent, to $3.3984.  May contracts for gasoline and heating oil expired at the
close of floor trading today.  Futures were up 11 percent in April, following a 14 percent
gain in March. Gasoline has advanced 41 percent this year and is
the second-best-performing commodity in 2011 after silver,
according to the Standard & Poor’s GSCI Total Return Index.
Heating oil is fifth and crude oil sixth.  Gasoline stockpiles have dropped 35.5 million barrels from
Feb. 11 through April 22, according to Energy Department data.
Power outages in Texas disrupted production this week at four
plants, on top of unit shutdowns at East Coast refineries that
cut supplies earlier this month.  East Coast  Supplies of gasoline in Padd 1, which includes  New York 
Harbor, the delivery point of the Nymex contract, sank 3.2
percent last week to the lowest level since Oct. 31, 2008,
according to department data.  “You’ve still got the supply issue, and you’re going into
gasoline season, so as long as crude is well supported, gasoline
is going to remain strong,” said Fred Rigolini, vice president
of Paramount Options Inc. in New York.  Gasoline gained as June-delivery crude advanced $1.07 to
settle at $113.93 a barrel on the Nymex.  Brent crude  for June
settlement rose 86 cents to $125.88 a barrel at 2:36 p.m. on
 London ’s ICE Futures Europe exchange.  Regular retail gasoline rose 2.3 cents to $3.909 a gallon
yesterday, AAA said on its website. That’s the highest price
since July 29, 2008. The record was $4.114 on July 15 of that
year.  Heating oil for May delivery advanced 2.42 cents, or 0.8
percent, to $3.2558 a gallon on the exchange, and posted a
weekly increase of 1.8 percent. The more actively traded June
contract gained 2.99 cents, or 0.9 percent, to $3.2758.  Prices for the front-month contract are up 5.3 percent this
month, after rising the previous five months, and have gained 28
percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
