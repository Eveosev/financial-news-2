Australia  should avoid imposing a
carbon tax on polluting industries before China and the U.S.
because it could threaten the country’s economy, the Australian
newspaper cited  Rio Tinto  Group’s chairman as saying.  Prime Minister  Julia Gillard  should reassure large
companies that plans to introduce a carbon tax in July 2012
wouldn’t damage Australia’s global competitiveness, Jan du Plessis said in an interview with the  Sydney-based newspaper .
Rio Tinto is the world’s third largest miner.  BHP Billiton Chief Executive Officer Marius Kloppers also
said that Australia shouldn’t move before its global rivals
earlier this week, the newspaper reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
