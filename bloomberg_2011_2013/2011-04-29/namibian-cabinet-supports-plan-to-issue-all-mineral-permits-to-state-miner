Namibia ’s Cabinet said it last
month endorsed plans to issue all mining and mineral exploration
permits to the uranium and diamond-rich African nation’s state-
owned mining company, Epangelo.  At a meeting on March 29, Cabinet supported a proposal that
uranium, gold, copper, coal, diamonds and rare earth metals are
declared “strategic minerals,” it said in a statement received
by e-mail today. “Cabinet endorsed that the right to own
licenses for strategic minerals will only be issued to a state
company.”  Namibia is considering changing mining laws to ensure its
citizens receive more benefit from the nation’s mineral wealth,
Finance Minister Saara Kuugongelwa-Amadhila said on March 9. The
southern African nation is the world’s biggest miner of offshore
diamonds, the fourth-largest uranium producer and also has
deposits of gold, coal and copper.  Shares in minerals companies with operations in Namibia,
including uranium miner  Extract Resources Ltd. (EXT) , have fallen on
concern about government plans for the industry.  “Reports quoting Namibia’s mining minister declaring
uranium, copper, gold, zinc and coal would face legislation
later this year giving the state exclusive exploration and
mining rights have understandably concerned industry
officials,” Glen Chipman, an analyst at Bank of America Corp.
Merrill Lynch in Sydney, wrote in a report. “At this very early
stage, it appears there could be some misconstrued elements.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
