Simon Property Group Inc. (SPG) , the
largest U.S. shopping-mall owner, said funds from operations
rose 75 percent in the first quarter as retail sales climbed and
a cost to pay off debt wasn’t repeated.  Funds from operations, which gauges a property company’s
ability to generate cash, increased to $570.6 million, or $1.61
a share, from $325.6 million, or 94 cents, a year earlier, the
Indianapolis-based real estate investment trust said today in a
statement. Analysts projected Simon would have an FFO of $1.54 a
share, the average of 17 estimates in a Bloomberg survey. The
company raised its FFO per-share forecast for the year to $6.55
to $6.65 from a previous range of $6.45 to $6.60 a share.
Analysts estimate the company’s FFO will be $6.62 a share for
the full year.  “It looks very solid,”  David Harris , an analyst with
Gleacher & Co. in New York, said in a telephone interview. “We
look at Simon as being providers of conservative guidance.”  Retail sales rose in March for a ninth consecutive month,
the Commerce Department said April 13.  General Growth Properties
Inc. (GGP) , the second-largest U.S. mall owner, said this week that
occupancies at its malls increased to 92.4 percent, and tenant
sales climbed 7.3 percent to $457 a square foot.  Simon, the largest U.S. REIT by market value, said revenue
rose 10 percent to $1.02 billion.  Simon owns or has stakes in almost 400 properties in  North
America ,  Europe  and  Asia .  Higher Rents  Occupancy at Simon’s U.S. malls increased to 92.9 percent
from 92.2 percent and its average rent per square foot rose to
$39.26 from $38.72, the statement showed.  The company recorded a $165.6 million loss on debt
extinguishment in the first quarter of 2010 related to tender
offers on debt. Excluding the debt cost, FFO was $491.2 million,
or $1.41 a share in the 2010 first quarter.  The results were announced before the open of U.S.
exchanges. The shares rose $1.49, or 1.3 percent, to $114.95
yesterday in  New York  Stock Exchange composite trading. They
have gained about 16 percent this year, compared with a 12
percent increase in the Bloomberg REIT Index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
