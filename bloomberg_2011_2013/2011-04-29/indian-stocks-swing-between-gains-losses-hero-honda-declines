Indian stocks dropped, with the
benchmark index completing a monthly decline, amid concern the
central’s bank move to raise  interest rates  next week may hurt
economic expansion and company earnings.  HDFC Bank Ltd. (HDFCB) , the third-biggest lender, declined to a
one-month low.  DLF Ltd. (DLFU) , the biggest developer, dropped for the
fifth day. The difference in yields between the nation’s short-
and long-term bonds has shrunk to a 28-month low, suggesting
investors expect policy makers will raise borrowing costs to
curb inflation even at the risk of slowing the economy. The
central bank’s next policy meeting is on May 3.  The Bombay Stock Exchange Sensitive Index, or Sensex, fell
159.73, or 0.8 percent, to 19,132.29, according to preliminary
closing prices at 3:30 p.m. in Mumbai. The measure declined 2.4
percent this week and 1.6 percent in the month. The S&P CNX
Nifty Index on the National Stock Exchange dropped 0.6 percent
to 5,750.95 and its May futures settled at 5,752.35. The BSE 200
Index lost 0.8 percent to 2,363.70.  To contact the reporter on this story:
