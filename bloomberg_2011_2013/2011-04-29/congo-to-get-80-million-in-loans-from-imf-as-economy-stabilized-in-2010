The Democratic Republic of Congo’s
economic growth will slow to 6.5 percent this year from about 7
percent in 2010 amid rising food and fuel costs, the
 International Monetary Fund  said.  “These outside factors have created a challenge for the
government,” IMF country representative Samir Jahjah told
reporters today in Kinshasa, the capital. The country’s central
bank may need to use monetary policy to curb inflationary
forces, he said.  The bank already sold $50 million of foreign exchange in
January and raised its benchmark interest rate to 29.5 percent
to combat increasing inflation. Twelve-month inflation rose to
13.79 percent today after falling to under 10 percent for 2010,
the central bank told reporters in Kinshasa.  Congo, which holds a third of the world’s cobalt reserves
and 4 percent of all copper, will continue to benefit from high
mineral prices and the expansion of its construction and service
sectors, Jahjah said. The country is recovering from more than a
decade and a half of conflict that destroyed most of its
infrastructure and left its economy in disarray.  Continued implementation of economic reforms in the second
half of 2010 prompted the IMF to release $80 million in loans to
the country today, Jahjah said. The money is the third
installment of a three-year, $561 million loan program to reduce
poverty and encourage growth in the Central African nation.  The IMF and Congo expect inflation to stabilize at 13
percent and cash reserves to increase from $1.3 billion to $1.5
billion by the end of the year, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
