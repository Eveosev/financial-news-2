Swiss stocks rose for a second day,
extending the  Swiss Market Index (SMI) ’s weekly gain, as the nation’s
equities caught up with other European markets.  Adecco SA (ADEN) , the world’s largest supplier of temporary
workers, climbed 2.2 percent after UBS AG upgraded its
recommendation on the shares.  Syngenta AG (SYNN)  and drugmaker  Roche
Holding AG (ROG)  added the most to the index.  The benchmark SMI rose 0.4 percent to 6,539.7 at the 5:30
p.m. close in Zurich, as only four stocks in the 20-member index
fell. The broader Swiss Performance Index gained 0.3 percent.  The SMI climbed 1.3 percent this week, bringing its April
gain to 2.9 percent. The measure has risen 1.6 percent in 2011,
trailing the 2.9 percent increase in the Stoxx  Europe  600 Index.
U.K. equity markets were closed for the royal wedding today.  The Swiss market is heavily weighted with defensive shares

“Today’s a very calm market. We’re watching the British
wedding, and I suppose that’s the topic of today,” he said.  Adecco gained 2.2 percent to 61.75 Swiss francs as UBS
upgraded the shares to “buy” from “neutral.”  Syngenta, a maker of crop protection products and seeds,
advanced 1.3 percent to 306.1 francs, rising for a second day.

costs in Europe.  Roche Rises  Roche advanced 1.1 percent to 140.30 francs. Nestle SA,
which makes up 24 percent of the SMI, climbed 0.2 percent to
53.70 francs.  Transocean Ltd. (RIG) , the owner of the Deepwater Horizon oil rig
that blew up a year ago in the Mexican Gulf to cause the biggest
 oil spill  on record in the U.S., rose 1.4 percent to 63.40
