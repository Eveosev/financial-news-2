China ’s benchmark money-market rate
dropped for a third day, set for the biggest weekly decline in
more than a month, after the central bank added funds to the
banking system.  The seven-day repurchase rate, which measures funding
availability between banks, retreated from this week’s two-month
high as the People’s Bank of China pumped a net 241 billion yuan
($37 billion) into the economy, the most since the five days
ended Jan. 21. Markets will close May 2 for the Labor Day
holiday.  “The cash shortage gradually eased because of the huge
cash injection,” said Guo Caomin, a bond analyst at Industrial
Bank Co. in Shanghai. “But the short-term money-market rate may
resume rising next month because the central bank will likely
raise banks’ reserve-ratio requirement.”  The repo rate dropped 11 basis points to 2.93 percent as of
10:25 a.m. in  Shanghai , according to a weighted average rate
compiled by the National Interbank Funding Center. It declined
61 basis points in the week, the biggest drop since the five
days ended March 4. It gained 10 basis points this month.  China ordered commercial banks to set aside more cash as
reserves four times this year and lifted  interest rates  twice to
help contain inflation.  One-year interest-rate swaps, the fixed cost needed to
receive the floating seven-day repo rate, were little changed at
3.41 percent from yesterday, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. It dropped three basis points for the week and was up
seven basis points from March 31.  The yield on the 2.76 percent government bond due July 2017
rose two basis points to 3.72 percent today, according to the
Interbank Funding Center. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  -- Judy Chen . Editors: Simon Harvey, Ven Ram  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
