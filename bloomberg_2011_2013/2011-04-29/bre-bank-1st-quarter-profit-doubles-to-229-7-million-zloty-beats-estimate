BRE Bank SA (BRE) , the  Commerzbank AG (CBK) 
unit that’s  Poland ’s third-biggest lender by assets, said first-
quarter profit doubled as interest income climbed and bad-loan
provisions declined.  Net income rose to 229.7 million zloty ($86.6 million) from
115.4 million zloty a year earlier, the Warsaw-based bank said
in a regulatory statement today. That beat the 222 million-zloty
mean estimate of seven analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  Polish banks benefited from first-quarter economic growth
estimated by the government at about 4 percent. Rival lenders
Bank Millennium SA and Bank Zachodni WBK SA reported profit
gains of 49 percent and 16 percent respectively in the period.  BRE’s net interest income, the difference between what the
bank pays on deposits and charges for loans, climbed 30 percent
to 506.5 million zloty. Fees and commissions advanced 20 percent
to 207.4 million zloty.  Provisions for bad loans fell 36 percent to 114.1 million
zloty as its retail portfolio improved, the bank said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
