Colombia’s congress approved a
four-year economic development plan that involves about 565
trillion pesos ($319 billion) of spending by the government and
private companies on health care, mining and poverty reduction  The  Senate  and lower  house  last night reconciled separate
versions of the plan and then voted after midnight on the final
bill, National Planning Department Director Hernando Jose Gomez
told reporters. The bill next goes to President  Juan Manuel Santos  to be signed into law.  The spending program, 60 percent of which will be funded by
the government and the rest by the private sector, aims to
reduce unemployment to single digits by 2014 from 13.2 percent
at present, boost housing and improve infrastructure.  The plan includes an article that would allow the central
bank to use peso bonds, known as TES, sold directly by the
government, to remove excess liquidity from the market. The bank
said in September it would buy at least $20 million a day in a
bid to ease gains in the peso.  The peso was little changed at 1767.00 per dollar from
1767.13 yesterday.  The plan envisages economic growth of about 5 percent
annually over the next four years. In 2010,  Colombia ’s economy
expanded 4.3 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
