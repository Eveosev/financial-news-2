Kenya ’s shilling headed for the
biggest depreciation in more than a week on importer demand for
dollars at the end of the month.  The currency of East Africa’s largest economy weakened 0.1
percent to 83.50 per dollar at 1:21 p.m. in Nairobi. It closed
at 83.40 yesterday.  “We have seen some dollar buying from importers,
particularly from the energy sector,” mostly due to end-of-
month demand, Julius Kiriinya, a dealer at Nairobi-based African
Banking Corp. said by phone today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
