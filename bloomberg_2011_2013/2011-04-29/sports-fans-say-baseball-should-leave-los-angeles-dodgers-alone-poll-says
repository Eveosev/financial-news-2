More sports fans oppose  Major
League Baseball ’s takeover of the  Los Angeles Dodgers ’ day-to-
day operations than believe the league acted properly, according
to a Seton Hall Sports Poll.  The survey, conducted this week by  Seton Hall University ’s
Sharkey Institute, showed that 45 percent of those fans believe
baseball was wrong last week when Commissioner Bud Selig took
over the Dodgers because of “deep concerns” regarding the
club’s finances.  Of the 495 respondents who identified themselves as sports
fans in the nationwide telephone poll, 34 percent supported the
move and 20 percent said they didn’t know. The poll had a margin
of error of plus or minus 4.5 percent.  “This action still has a number of acts to play out,”
 Rick Gentile , director of the South Orange, New Jersey-based
poll, said today in an e-mailed statement. “But for now, in the
court of public opinion, the team’s ownership seems to be
winning versus MLB’s decision.”  Selig appointed former Texas Rangers president J. Thomas Schieffer on April 25 to monitor the Dodgers’ operations.
Dodgers owner  Frank McCourt  has opposed the takeover, saying
that his team has never violated any of MLB’s financial rules
and that he feels top officials are trying to force him out.  The poll found that female fans were more likely to favor
McCourt’s position, with 49 percent opposed to baseball’s move
and 24 percent in favor. Male fan were almost equally divided,
with 44 percent supporting and 42 percent against.  To contact the reporter on this story:
