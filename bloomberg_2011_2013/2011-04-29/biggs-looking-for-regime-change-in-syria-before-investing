Barton Biggs , the hedge-fund
manager who bought stocks when the market bottomed in 2009, said
there needs to be a change in government in  Syria  before he
invests in the country after popular unrest escalated this year.  “I’m afraid with after what’s happened we’re going to have
to have regime change,” said Biggs, who runs New York-based
Traxis Partners LP, in an interview today on Bloomberg
Television’s “InBusiness” with Pimm Fox. “It’s going to be
hard to put Humpty Dumpty back together.”  Syrians took to the streets across the country today,
defying warnings by the Interior Ministry not to hold
demonstrations as the anti-government challenge to President
Bashar al-Assad’s rule escalates. The protests are part of a
wave of popular movements that have unseated rulers in Egypt and
 Tunisia , sparked violent repression in Libya and Bahrain and
helped push  oil prices  up more than 20 percent this year.  Biggs, a former chairman of Morgan Stanley Asset
Management, traveled to Syria with a group of other U.S.
investors in late 2009 and met with President al-Assad. He said
he was “very impressed” with the Syrian leader at the time and
is disappointed that the potential investments didn’t take
place.  “We talked specifically about a sovereign-debt issue, a
private-equity fund,” Biggs said of his visit two years ago.
“Syria’s financial position is very strong. They have very
little sovereign debt outstanding, at least in 2010. They have a
public-sector surplus. Everything could have happened. There was
a very favorable response from investors.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
