The  Los Angeles Lakers  beat the New
Orleans Hornets 98-80 to advance to the second round of the
National Basketball Association playoffs.  Also today, the Atlanta Hawks beat the Orlando Magic 84-81
to seal a first-round series win. The Hawks will play the
 Chicago Bulls  for a place in the Eastern Conference finals,
while the Lakers will continue their quest for a third straight
NBA championship against the Dallas Mavericks or Portland Trail
Blazers.  Portland needs a home win against Dallas in tonightâ€™s other
playoff game to avoid a 4-2 series defeat.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
