Irish private-sector deposits fell
10.1 percent in March from a year earlier, as companies pulled
money before the central bank laid out the capital needs of the
nation’s lenders.  Private-sector deposits at Irish lenders, including
foreign-owned retail and wholesale banks, fell 1.3 percent to
about 163 billion euros ($242.3 billion) in March from February,
the Dublin-based  central bank  said in an e-mailed statement
today.  “The negative net monthly flow of Irish private sector
deposits in March was once again reflected across all deposit
sectors,” with corporate deposits “recording a particularly
sharp fall,” the central bank said.  Ireland sought an international bailout in November as its
lenders became reliant on emergency lending from central banks
after a flight of deposits. Finance Minister  Michael Noonan  said
on April 6 that deposits at Bank of Ireland Plc and  Allied Irish
Banks Plc (ALBK) , the nation’s two biggest lenders, rebounded after the
central bank said four lenders needed 24 billion euros in
capital, less than the 35 billion euros set aside as part of the
bailout.  The reliance of Irish retail lenders, including foreign-
owned banks, on ECB funding fell 5.9 billion euros in March to
82.8 billion euros. Separately, Irish central bank funding for
the country’s banks may have fallen as much as 3.3 billion euros
to 66.8 billion euros in March, according to figures released on
April 8.  To contact the reporter on this story:  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
