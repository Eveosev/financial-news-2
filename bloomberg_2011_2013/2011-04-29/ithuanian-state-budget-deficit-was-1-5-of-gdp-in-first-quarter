Lithuania’s central-government
budget deficit narrowed to 1.5 percent of estimated gross
domestic product in the first quarter.  The shortfall narrowed from 2.2 percent of GDP in the first
quarter of 2010, the Vilnius-based  Finance Ministry  said in a
 statement  today. The three-month deficit totaled 1.57 billion
litai ($680 million) on a cash basis, it said.  Prime Minister Andrius Kubilius’ government aims to keep
the fiscal deficit, which includes funds from the central
government, local governments and social security, at 5.3
percent of GDP this year, compared with an estimated 7.1 percent
last year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
