Estonian trade unions want a 17
percent increase in the minimum wage from July, raising their
earlier demand because of accelerating inflation.  The Confederation of Estonian Trade Unions wants employers
to agree to a minimum gross wage of 325 euros ($483), compared
with 278 euros now and the 320 euros it sought in September, the
workersâ€™ group said on its  website  today. The average monthly
gross wage was 814 euros in the fourth quarter.  "Almost all European countries raised minimum wage levels
in January," Chairman Harri Taliga said in the statement.
"Estonia, as a nation with one of the fastest growth rates, has
been left in a rather embarrassing position -- only three
European countries, Lithuania, Romania and  Bulgaria , pay lower
minimum wages than we do."  Estonia adopted the euro in January as the third east
European country behind Slovenia and Slovakia after a 10-month
deflation amid its worst recession in two decades. Inflation was
5.1 percent in March, the highest in the 17-member euro area.
The government estimates economic growth at 4 percent this year
and next.  To contact the reporters on this story:
