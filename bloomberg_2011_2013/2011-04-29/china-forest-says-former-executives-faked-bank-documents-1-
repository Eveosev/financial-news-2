China  Forestry Holdings Co., partly
owned by Washington-based private equity firm  Carlyle Group ,
said a probe into irregularities of 2010 financial statements
found the former management team was the source, according to a
statement to the Hong Kong stock exchange today.  The bank statements provided by China Forestry’s previous
executives to auditor KPMG LLP which were falsified, the
statement said. There were also inconsistencies in the company’s
insurance policies and logging permits for about 100,000 cubic
meters of wood were faked.  China Forestry halted trading in its stock in January and
replaced Chief Executive Officer Li Han Chun. Li was detained by
police in China’s Guizhou province in February for allegedly
embezzling 30 million yuan ($4.6 million).  China Forestry owns about 171,780 hectares of forests and
is among the nation’s top three private operators, according to
its website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
