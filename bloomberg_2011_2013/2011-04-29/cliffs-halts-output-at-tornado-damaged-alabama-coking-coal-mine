Cliffs Natural Resources Inc. (CLF) ,
 North America ’s largest iron-ore producer, halted output at its
Oak Grove coking-coal mine in  Alabama  after a tornado damaged
equipment.  Oak Grove, located about 25 miles (40 kilometers) west of
Birmingham, produced about 887,000 tons of coal used in
steelmaking in 2009, according to Cliff’s  website .  Alabama was the hardest-hit among southern states affected
by severe weather that killed at least 280 people and left up to
1 million without electricity. A tornado struck Oak Grove late
April 27, Pat Persico, a spokeswoman for Cleveland-based Cliffs,
said by telephone today.  “Until power is restored in that region we cannot operate
that facility,” Persico said.  About 300 people work at the mine, she said. None was
injured, while “significant damage” to the mine’s above-ground
facilities will affect deliveries, Cliffs said yesterday in a
statement.  Cliffs fell $2.87, or 3 percent, to $93.72 as of 4:15 p.m.
