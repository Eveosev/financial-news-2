Lehman Brothers Treasury Co. BV’s
bankruptcy trustees objected to a U.S. revised plan filed by
 Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. (LEHMQ) , saying it should recognize an
intercompany claim as senior debt.  “The Lehman Brothers Treasury trustees advised Lehman
Brothers Holdings Inc. that they object to the January plan’s
failure to recognize the seniority of Lehman Brothers Treasury’s
intercompany claims,” Rutger J. Schimmelpenninck and Frederic
Verhoeven, lawyers at Amsterdam-based Houthoff Buruma, wrote in
their eighth  report  on the Lehman bankruptcy. The trustees said
they are discussing better treatment of the claim with Lehman
Brothers Holdings and “certain key noteholder groups.”  The Lehman Brothers Treasury unit helped finance the
business activities of affiliates of New York-based Lehman, the
securities firm that filed for bankruptcy in 2008, by selling
financial instruments including structured notes, the trustees
said. The Lehman holding company owed $33.2 billion to Lehman
Brothers Treasury as of Sept. 12, 2008, they said.  While the January plan “does not recognize the
intercompany
claim’s status as senior debt,” it “seems to have acknowledged
the senior status of certain other claims, which was not the
case in its previous plan,” the lawyers said in today’s filing
in Amsterdam district court.  The balance of the unit’s estate accounts was 5.81 million
euros ($8.61 million) at the end of March, the trustees said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
