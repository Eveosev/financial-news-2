Spot metallurgical coal prices
declined this week on the U.S. spot market on speculation that
export demand has weakened, according to Energy Publishing Inc.  Spot prices for low-volatility coking coal fell $11.38, or
3.5 percent, to $315.50 a ton in the week ended today, the
 Knoxville, Tennessee-based  data provider reported. High-
volatility coal lost $10.50, or 3.5 percent, to $292.  “While there is a whisper in the air of some weakening in
pricing and demand for hard coking coal out of  Australia , U.S.
producers are being propped up to some extent by some unexpected
domestic demand,” Energy Publishing said.  The data provider says it surveys buyers and sellers of
coal to determine pricing.  To contact the reporter on this story:
