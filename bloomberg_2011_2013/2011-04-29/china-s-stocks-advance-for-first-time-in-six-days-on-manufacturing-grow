China’s stocks rose for the first
time in six days after a report showed manufacturing expanded,
easing concerns that tightening policies have slowed economic
growth.  The Shanghai Composite Index added 0.2 percent to 2,892.60
at 10:48 a.m. Consumer staples producers and chemical companies
rallied on speculation they will boost product prices as higher
material costs threaten to erode profit margins.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
