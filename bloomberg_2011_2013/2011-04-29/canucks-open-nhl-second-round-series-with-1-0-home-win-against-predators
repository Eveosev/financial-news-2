The  Vancouver Canucks  began their
second-round National Hockey League playoff series with a 1-0
home win against the Nashville Predators.  Christopher Higgins scored the only goal of the game for
the Canucks midway through the second period at Rogers Arena in
Vancouver last night.  The best-of-seven series resumes at the same venue
tomorrow.  Two more second-round series get under way tonight. The
Tampa Bay Lightning visit the top-seeded Washington Capitals as
they vie for a place in the Eastern Conference finals, and the
 San Jose Sharks  host the 11-time Stanley Cup champion Detroit
Red Wings in a Western Conference series opener.  To contact the reporter on this story:
