Evergreen Marine Corp., the listed
unit of  Asia ’s biggest container line, posted a fourth straight
quarterly profit as the global economic recovery boosted
shipping volumes.  Net income was NT$1.31 billion ($46 million), or 41 cents a
share, in the first quarter, compared with a net loss of NT$87
million, or 3 cents, a year earlier, the Taipei-based company
said in a Taiwan Stock Exchange filing today. The figure beat
the NT$734 million average of six analyst estimates compiled by
Bloomberg.  Evergreen, A.P. Moller-Maersk A/S, owner of the world’s
largest container line, and other shipping companies have
boosted volumes this year as economic growth spurs demand for
Asian-made toys, furniture and electronics in the U.S. and
Europe. Asia-U.S. container volumes may climb about 8 percent
this year, according to the  Transpacific Stabilization
Agreement , a shipping-line group.  Evergreen fell 1.5 percent to close at NT$26.50 in Taipei
trading today, before the earnings announcement. The stock has
declined 13 percent this year, compared with the benchmark Taiex
Index’s 0.4 percent gain.  Asia- Europe  rates may gain later this year as trade expands
and shipping lines receive fewer new vessels, Maersk said on
April 12. The world economy will expand 4.4 percent this year
and 4.5 percent in 2012, according to the Washington-based
 International Monetary Fund .  To contact the reporters on this story:
