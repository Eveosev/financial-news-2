Serbia ’s economic growth
accelerated in the first quarter to match the full-year estimate
of the government and the  International Monetary Fund .  Gross domestic product rose 3 percent from the year-earlier
period after expanding an annual 1.7 percent in the previous
quarter, the statistics office in Belgrade said in a statement
today. March exports rose to 771 million euros ($1.14 billion),
from 648.8 million euros in February and 540.5 million euros in
January, it said.  "Industrial production and exports obviously contributed to
the growth," said Sasa Djogovic, an economist at the Belgrade-
based Institute for Market Research. "The signs are good but
it’s probably all commodity-driven, based on demand for raw
materials that Serbia offers. Structural, qualitative changes
that the economy needs are yet to take place."  Serbia is emerging from its first recession since 1999,
when a NATO bombing aimed at forcing the country’s troops out of
 Kosovo  destroyed most of its infrastructure. The nation relied
on a 3 billion-euro bailout loan from the IMF since mid-2009,
when the global financial crisis triggered a flight of capital.  Industrial production rose an annual 7.1 percent in March
after a decline in December and increases of 3.8 percent and 5.8
percent in January and February respectively.  The statistics office didn’t release further details on GDP
today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
