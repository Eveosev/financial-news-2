OAO Polyus Gold,  Russia â€™s largest
producer of the precious metal, surged to its highest in almost
three years as a weakening dollar prompted investors to buy gold
to hedge against inflation.  The stock jumped 4.5 percent to 1,947.8 rubles by the 6:45
p.m. close in Moscow, the highest level since May 2008.  Gold headed for its biggest monthly advance since November
2009 after investors seeking an alternative to the dollar sent
prices to a record 14 times this month. The U.S. currency
slumped to the lowest since December 2009 yesterday versus the
euro.  To contact the reporter on this story:
