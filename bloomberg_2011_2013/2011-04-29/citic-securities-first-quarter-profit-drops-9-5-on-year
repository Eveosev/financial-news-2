Citic Securities Co., China’s
biggest brokerage by market value, said first-quarter profit
fell 9.5 percent from a year ago on declining commissions.  Net income dropped to 1.36 billion yuan ($209 million)
from 1.50 billion yuan a year earlier, according to a statement
to the  Shanghai Stock Exchange  today.  The Beijing-based company, which is preparing for a $2.2
billion sale of shares in  Hong Kong , said income from trading
stocks and mutual funds for clients fell 32 percent to 2.2
billion yuan. Income from investments was 1.1 billion yuan,
advancing from 263 million yuan a year earlier.  The sale of a 45 percent stake in China Securities Co. in
November may cut Citic’s fee income by 42 percent and profit
from underwriting stocks and bonds by 11 percent in 2011, Shao Ziqin, an analyst at Guosen Securities Co., wrote in a report
dated April 12.  “This should be a low point for Citic as it will book more
profit from direct investment later this year,” Wei Tao, an
analyst at  China  Securities, said in a phone interview before
the earnings release.  --Feiwen Rong, Eva Woo. Editor: Chitra Somayaji, Josh Fellman  To contact Bloomberg Staff on this story:
