Two Android phone users sued  Google
Inc. (GOOG)  over claims their phones secretly recorded and stored data
about their movements.  The two residents of Oakland County in  Michigan  said in a
complaint filed April 27 in federal court in Detroit that their
HTC Inspire 4G phones, which use Google’s Android Operating
System, track their whereabouts “just as if by a tracking
device for which a court-ordered warrant would ordinarily be
required.”  The plaintiffs seek to represent other Android phone users
in a class-action lawsuit, as well as at least $50 million in
damages and a court order requiring Google to stop tracking its
products’ users.  Google and  Apple Inc. (AAPL)  are facing scrutiny from consumers
and lawmakers over the collection of data on smart phones. Both
companies have agreed to testify at a May 10 Senate hearing
about consumer privacy on mobile devices.  Chris Gaither, a spokesman for  Mountain View , California-
based Google, declined to comment on the lawsuit yesterday.  “We provide users with notice and control over the
collection, sharing and use of location” on Androids, Gaither
had said in an e-mail on April 27 regarding lawmakers’ concern
over data collection. “Any location data that is sent back to
Google location servers is anonymized and is not tied or
traceable to a specific user.”  The case is Julie Brown v. Google, 11-11867, U.S. District
Court, Eastern District of Michigan (Detroit).  To contact the reporter on this story:
