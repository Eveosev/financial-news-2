Shares of the following companies
had unusual moves in  Thailand  trading. Stock symbols are in
parentheses and prices are as of the 4:30 p.m. close in Bangkok.  The SET Index rose 1.25, or 0.1 percent, to 1,093.56. The
gauge gained 4.4 percent in April, its third monthly advance.  Bangkok Metro Pcl (BMCL)  , Thailand’s only subway
operator, jumped 8.6 percent to 0.76 baht, the largest increase
since July 2. The company offered the lowest bid for a contract
to operate an electric rail project linking outlying suburbs
with central Bangkok. Bangkok Metro bid 93.5 billion baht ($3.1
billion) for the contract to install, run and maintain the 23-
kilometer rail route, called the “purple line”, for 30 years,
said Chaisit Kururat, assistant governor of the Mass Rapid
Transit Authority of Thailand.  Kim Eng Securities (Thailand) Pcl, the country’s largest
stock brokerage, gained 2 percent to 15 baht, the most since
April 4. Net income in the first quarter increased 42 percent to
193.3 million baht, or 0.34 baht a share.  PTT Exploration & Production Pcl (PTTEP)  , Thailand’s
only publicly traded oil explorer, dropped 1.9 percent to 185
baht, the most since March 15. The company’s profit in the first
quarter rose 7.2 percent to 10.98 billion baht, or 3.31 baht a
share. That missed the 11.3 billion-baht median estimate of
seven analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  Total Access Communication Pcl (DTAC)  , the country’s
second-biggest mobile phone company, advanced 5.8 percent to
50.50 baht, the steepest increase since July 28. Net income in
the first quarter rose 36 percent to 3.33 billion baht, or 1.41
baht a share.  Thai Airways International Pcl (THAI)  , the nation’s
largest carrier, fell 3.2 percent to 38.25 baht on concern
higher fuel costs will hurt its earnings. Yesterday, crude oil

 New York Mercantile Exchange , the highest settlement since Sept.
22, 2008.  To contact the reporter on this story:
