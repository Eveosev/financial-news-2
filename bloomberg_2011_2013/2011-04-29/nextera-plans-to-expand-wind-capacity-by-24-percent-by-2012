 NextEra Energy Resources LLC, the
largest U.S. wind-energy producer, said it will expand its
generating capacity by as much as 24 percent by the end of 2012.  The company plans to add up to 2 gigawatts of new wind
power to the 8.3 gigawatts it now has, according to a
presentation released today with the first-quarter results of
its parent,  Juno Beach , Florida-based  NextEra Energy Inc. (NEE)   Most of the added capacity will go online in 2012 rather
than this year, Armando Pimentel, chief financial officer of
NextEra Energy Inc. said in a conference call with investors.  “Meeting the bottom end of our previous 700 megawatt to  1
gigawatt range in 2011 will be a challenge” because of the time
it takes to obtain permits, Pimentel said.  The company also said today that it extended the estimated
useful life of its newer  wind turbines  to 30 years from 25
years. It said the extension will add about 10.5 cents per share
to its full-year 2011 earnings.  Nextera Energy Resources, which also owns solar-energy
facilities, said it secured lines of credit for two solar
thermal projects it’s building in Extremadura,  Spain .  The two projects, each with a capacity of 49.9 megawatts,
will help increase earnings starting in 2013, Lewis Hay, NextEra
Energy Inc.’s chief executive officer, said during the call.  “Solar has the potential to be the next wind industry for
Nextera,” Hay said.  NextEra Energy Resources also plans to focus more on
projects in  North America , Pimentel said.  “We are as interested in purchasing clean generation
assets as we are in developing them ourselves,” he said. “We
are not interested in purchasing or developing additional assets
outside of North America in the foreseeable future.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
