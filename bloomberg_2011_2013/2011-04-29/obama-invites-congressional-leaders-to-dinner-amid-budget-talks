President  Barack Obama  has invited
Democratic and Republican congressional leaders and their
spouses to dinner at the White House May 2, presidential
spokesman Jay Carney said.  The dinner is being held as lawmakers return to Washington
to begin a debate soon on raising the nation’s $14.3 trillion
debt ceiling, a step opposed by some Republicans and Democrats
if it doesn’t include spending cuts. Obama and Treasury
Secretary  Timothy F. Geithner  have said failing to raise the
limit might cause a financial crisis.  Dinner invitations also went to Vice President  Joe Biden 
and his wife, Jill Biden, members of the Cabinet and senior
White House staff officials, Carney said in an e-mail.  The administration also is getting ready for negotiations
with Congress on a plan to reduce the federal deficit. Obama
outlined his plan to reduce the deficit by $4 trillion over 12
years earlier this month through a combination of spending cuts
and tax increases. A Republican alternative aims to trim the
long-term budget shortfall largely through spending cuts of more
than $6 trillion over a decade.  To contact the reporters on this story:
