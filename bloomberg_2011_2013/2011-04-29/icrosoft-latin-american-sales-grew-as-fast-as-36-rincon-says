Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) ´s revenue in Latin
America is growing as fast as 36 percent as rising incomes and
lower computer prices bolster demand, said Hernan Rincon, the
company´s president for the region.  Microsoft’s sales surpassed the growth of the area’s
information technology industry, which is expanding at 12
percent, he said.  “The cost of PCs and technology is declining and the
incomes in Latin America are rising,” Rincon said in an
interview at the  World Economic Forum  on Latin American in Rio
de Janeiro. “The combination of the two makes information
technology more accessible year after year.”  The region, which is the fastest growing market for
Redmond, Washington-based Microsoft, also saw a decline in
software piracy, Rincon said. About 62 percent of software in
 Latin America  is illegally sold, down from 70 percent five years
ago, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
