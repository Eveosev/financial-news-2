Zimbabwe elections scheduled for
this year may be delayed until 2013, the state-controlled  Herald 
said, citing Patrick Chinamasa, the chief negotiator for
President  Robert Mugabe ’s Zimbabwe African National Union-
Patriotic Front party.  The two parties need to agree on constitutional changes,
media reform and sanctions imposed on members of Zanu-PF by most
western governments, the Harare-based Herald said on its
website. Those negotiations, overseen by South African President
 Jacob Zuma , must be concluded before elections can be held, the
Herald cited Chinamasa as saying.  The  Movement for Democratic Change , part of the country’s
unity government, has “stalled” attempts to have sanctions
removed on members of Zanu-PF, Chinamasa said, according to the
state-controlled newspaper.  The two parties have shared power since February 2009 after
the MDC won a parliamentary election, while failing to gain an
outright win in a presidential ballot in March 2008. The
violence marred election wasn’t recognized by  SADC 
parliamentarians or other observers.  To contact the reporter on this story:
