German stocks gained for a seventh
day as the benchmark  DAX Index (DAX)  posted its biggest monthly
increase in more than a year.  Praktiker AG,  Germany ’s third-biggest home-improvement
retailer, climbed 5.7 percent as its quarterly loss narrowed.
 Daimler AG (DAI) , the world’s second-largest maker of luxury cars,
slid 1.7 percent after saying it sees higher raw material costs.  The DAX gained 0.5 percent to 7,514.46 at the 5:30 p.m.
close in  Frankfurt , extending this week’s increase to 3 percent.
The gauge has climbed 6.7 percent in April, the biggest monthly
jump since March 2010. The broader  HDAX Index (HDAX)  also rose 0.5
percent today.  The DAX has soared 15 percent from this year’s low on March
16 as corporate profits spurred speculation the global economic
recovery is on track.  “The market is on an upward path and is very resistant,”
said Arnaud Scarpaci, a  fund manager  at Agilis Gestion SA in
Paris, which oversees about $110 million.  Praktiker surged 5.7 percent to 7.98 euros as its first-
quarter net loss narrowed to 15.5 million euros ($23 million)
from 37.5 million euros in the year-ago period.  Aurubis AG (NDA)  gained 2.1 percent to 39.90 euros.  Europe ’s
biggest copper smelter is looking at other possible acquisitions
after agreeing to buy Luvata Group’s rolled products division,
Bernd Drouven, the company’s chief executive officer said. The
CEO declined to say when the copper refiner will make its next
purchase and didn’t identify potential targets.  Daimler Declines  Daimler lost 1.7 percent to 52.19 euros as the carmaker
said it sees 2011 raw material costs of about 700 million euros.
The company reported a 71 percent gain in first-quarter
operating profit as growing wealth in  China  boosted deliveries
of the Mercedes-Benz S-Class sedan.  Earnings before interest and taxes rose to 2.03 billion
euros from 1.19 billion euros a year earlier, Stuttgart,
Germany-based Daimler said. Profit matched the 2 billion-euro
average estimate of 12 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  MorphoSys AG (MOR)  jumped 5.2 percent to 19.85 euros. The
biotechnology company said first-quarter net income rose to 18.8
million euros from 3.2 million euros in the year-ago quarter.  SMA Solar Technology AG (S92)  climbed 4.9 percent to 80.49 euros,
the first gain this week. Samsung C&T Corp. and SMA have
partnered to build industrial-size solar inverters that convert
power from solar panels to be fed into the electricity grid at
facilities in Toronto, Samsung C&T said today.  Separately, Total SA agreed to buy as much as 60 percent of
SunPower Corp., the second-largest U.S. solar panel maker, for
$1.38 billion, taking advantage of increased global interest in
renewable energy.  Kloeckner & Co. SE advanced 5.5 percent to 24.28 euros, the
