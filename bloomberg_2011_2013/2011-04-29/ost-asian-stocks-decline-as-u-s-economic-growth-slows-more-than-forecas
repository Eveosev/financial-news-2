Most Asian stocks declined, with
the regional benchmark index little changed, as a report showed
the U.S. economy slowed more than forecast in the first quarter.  The MSCI Asia Pacific Excluding Japan Index was little
changed at 508.25 as of 8:27 a.m. in  Hong Kong , with about three
stocks declining for eevery two that rose. Japanese markets are
closed for a holiday.  South Korea ’s Kospi Index added 0.2
percent, while  Australia ’s S&P/ASX 200 Index lost 0.2 percent.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
