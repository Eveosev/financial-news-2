Supporters of  Benin ’s President
Thomas Boni Yayi will seek to win a parliamentary majority in
elections tomorrow, a month after he secured a second term as
the West African state’s leader.  The opposition currently occupies most of the seats in the
National Assembly, holding 49 compared with 34 for the Forces
Couris pour un  Benin  Emergent, which backs Boni Yayi. The
incumbent on March 13 won 53 percent of the presidential vote.  Opposition leader Adrien Houngbedji, who came second in the
vote, alleged widespread voter fraud and rejected Boni Yayi’s
victory, with his supporters protesting against the result in
the capital, Porto Novo.  For the parliamentary vote, the opposition “won’t accept
the masquerade that helped re-elect President Boni Yayi,”
Houngbedji said in remarks broadcast on Cotonou-based Office de
Radiodiffusion et Television yesterday.  Benin, sub-Saharan  Africa ’s sixth-biggest cotton grower,
was hit by heavy rains in September and October. The resultant
floods cut the outlook for growth this year to 3.4 percent from
4.4 percent, Finance Minister Idriss Daouda told the
 International Monetary Fund  in a letter published on the
Washington-based lender’s website on Feb. 25.  Voting will start at 7 a.m. and end at 4 p.m. with results
expected in about 10 days.  To contact the reporter on this story:
