German two-year notes fell after a
report showed euro-region inflation accelerated in April to the
fastest pace in two and a half years, bolstering the case for
the  European Central Bank  to raise  interest rates .  Greek bonds dropped, extending their sixth consecutive
weekly decline, amid speculation the nation will need to
restructure its debt. Inflation in the 17-nation euro region
quickened to 2.8 percent from 2.7 percent in March, the European
Union’s statistics office in Luxembourg said today. Economists
expected inflation to remain unchanged, according to the median
of 34 forecasts in a Bloomberg News survey. Traders added to
bets that policy makers will increase borrowing costs.  “Inflation concerns, and therefore the rate outlook for
the ECB, have become more aggressive, particularly with the rate
we’ve just seen,” said  Kornelius Purps , a strategist at
UniCredit SpA in Munich. “There’s definitely more potential for
higher rates, particularly in the short-end.”  The two-year note yield climbed two basis points to 1.79
percent as of 3:43 p.m. in  London . The 1.5 percent security due
March 2013 fell 0.04, or 40 euro cents per 1,000-euro ($1,484)
face amount, to 99.47. The 10-year bund yield was little changed
at 3.26 percent. It dropped to 3.20 percent yesterday, the least
since March 24.  An index of executive and consumer sentiment in the euro
region slipped to 106.2 from 107.3 in March, the sharpest drop
since May 2010, and unemployment held at 9.9 percent, separate
reports showed.  Greek Bonds Slide  Greek two-year yields rose back above 26 percent, while 10-
year yields reached 16 percent, both approaching euro-era all-
time highs.  Greek two-year yields surged as much as 109 basis points to
26.01 percent before retreating to 25.37 percent, 2.36
percentage points higher in the week. Ten-year yields gained as
much as 31 basis points today to 16.01 percent, before sliding
to 15.70 percent, a weekly gain of 80 basis points. The five-
year security’s yield rose 15 basis points today.  Portuguese 10-year yields jumped 10 basis points to 9.76
percent, the highest since at least 1997, when Bloomberg began
collecting the data, before slipping three basis points to 9.63
percent. Two-year yields were little changed at 11.98 percent.  “There are still concerns over the possibility of a Greek
default or restructuring,” Purps said. “That’s hammering the
periphery, and we see that in spread-widening over the past two
weeks or so.”  Greece ’s two-year note yields have added more than 1,000
basis points, or 10 percentage points, this month, while
 Portugal ’s have gained more than 300 basis points. Ireland’s
have risen more than 200 basis points over the period.  Portugal Bailout  Earlier this month, Portugal became the third euro-region
country to seek an international bailout after Greece sparked a
sovereign-debt crisis that threatened to splinter the currency
bloc a year ago and then engulfed Ireland.  The extra yield, or spread, investors demand to hold Greek
10-year bonds instead of similar-maturity German bunds widened
as much as 31 basis points today to 1,275 basis points. It
reached 1,307 on April 27, the most since at least March 1998,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  German retail sales decreased 2.1 percent from February,
when they fell 0.4 percent, the Federal Statistics Office in
Wiesbaden said today. Economists forecast a 0.2 percent gain,
according to the median of 18 estimates in a Bloomberg News
survey. From a year earlier, sales declined 3.5 percent.  ECB Rates  The ECB increased its benchmark rate by 25 basis points to
1.25 percent at their April 7 meeting to keep a lid on price
pressures. The central bank is balancing the need for higher
borrowing costs in countries such as  Germany  against soaring
bond yields in the region’s most-indebted nations. Policy makers
meet again on May 5.  Euribor futures fell, pushing the implied yield on the
December contract two basis points higher to 2.05 percent as
traders added to bets that the ECB will raise borrowing costs.
The rate has climbed from 1.33 percent on Dec. 31.  Spanish 10-year bonds advanced for a third day, pushing the
yield down by 10 basis points to 5.29 percent, even as reports
showed unemployment, the highest in  Europe , rose more than
forecast, inflation accelerated and retail sales plunged.  Joblessness rose to 21.3 percent in the first quarter, the
National Statistics Institute said today in  Madrid , compared
with 20.3 percent in the previous three months and a median
forecast of 20.7 percent in a Bloomberg News survey.  Consumer prices rose 3.5 percent in April from a year
earlier, based on a European Union measure, after increasing 3.3
percent in March. Retail sales fell 8.6 percent in March from a
year earlier, the steepest decline in two years, INE said.  France  plans to sell as much as 9.5 billion euros of
securities on May 5, according to Agence France Tresor.  German  government bonds  have handed investors a loss of 1.7
percent this year, according to indexes compiled by the European
Federation of Financial Analysts Societies and Bloomberg. U.S.
Treasuries have returned 1 percent. Greek debt lost 12 percent,
with Portuguese securities losing 15 percent, the indexes show.  To contact the reporters on this story:
