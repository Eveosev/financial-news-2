Syrian authorities have arrested more
than 1,000 people in the last two days as a crackdown on
demonstrations intensifies, according to a local activist group.  About half of the detentions took place in the southern
province of Daraa, scene of the most violent clashes between
protesters and security forces, Ammar Qurabi, head of  Syria ’s
 National Organization for Human Rights , said in a phone
interview today.  Syria has sent troops to quell demonstrations, inspired by
popular revolts in Egypt and  Tunisia , that have spread across
the country and posed the most serious challenge to the 11-year
rule of President Bashar Al-Assad. Qurabi estimates that more
than 550 people have died since the uprising began in mid-March.  The crisis in Syria is “quickly going beyond the point of
no return,” the Brussels-based  International Crisis Group  said
in a report today. “The regime’s hope appears to be that a
massive crackdown can bring the protesters to heel,” a policy
that may lead to “loss of life on a massive scale,” sectarian
conflict and the destabilization of Syria’s neighbors, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
