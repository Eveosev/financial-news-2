Weather in  New York  and New England
probably will remain cooler than normal through much of the
first half of May, according to  Matt Rogers , president of
 Commodity Weather Group LLC .  Rogers calls for the eastern U.S. and Northeast to remain
cooler than normal from May 4 to May 8 in his 6- to 10-day
outlook. He then shifts the probability for cooler weather
across the northern U.S., still including the Northeast, in his
11- to 15-day outlook.  Rogers said negative phases of both the North Atlantic
Oscillation and the Arctic Oscillation, Northern Hemispheric
pressure gradients that can cool  North America , will keep warm
weather at bay.  “The result is still a cool-leaning across northern
population centers with better opportunities again for above-
normal overnight heating demand,” Rogers said in a note to
clients.  Natural gas traders monitor  weather forecasts  to determine
whether temperatures boost heating or cooling demand.
Predictions of below-normal or above-normal temperatures may
prompt traders to buy or sell gas futures. Commodity traders
watch precipitation forecasts for potential impact on planting
and yields.  In his 6- to 10-day outlook, Rogers calls for above-normal
warmth to center in the U.S. Southwest and southern Rocky
Mountains. That warm area expands in his 11- to 15-day outlook
to cover the southern half of the U.S.  To contact the reporter on this story:
