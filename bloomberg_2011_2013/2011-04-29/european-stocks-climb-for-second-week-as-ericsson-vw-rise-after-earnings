European stocks posted a second
weekly gain, with the Stoxx  Europe  600 Index completing the
biggest monthly increase this year, as companies from Ericsson
AB to Volkswagen AG reported better-than-estimated earnings.  Ericsson surged 16 percent as the biggest maker of mobile-
phone networks reported first-quarter profit that more than
tripled. Volkswagen, Europe’s largest carmaker, jumped 12
percent.  Parmalat SpA (PLT)  soared the most in two years as Groupe
Lactalis offered to buy the 71 percent of  Italy ’s biggest dairy
company it doesn’t already own.  The Stoxx 600 advanced 1.2 percent to 283.78 this past
week, for a 2.9 percent increase this month. The measure has
surged 8.2 percent from this year’s low on March 16 as companies
from UBS AG to Akzo Nobel NV reported earnings that exceeded
forecasts and the U.S. Federal Reserve maintained its pledge to
keep  interest rates  low for an “extended period.”  “There are enough reasons to be positive on equities,”
Vincent Juvyns, an equity strategist at ING Investment
Management in Brussels, said in an interview on Bloomberg
Television. “We see it in the earnings season. There are a lot
of reasons to be worried about the macroeconomic context, but at
the same time, on the microeconomic level, companies are doing
well.”  A report on April 28 showed the  U.S. economy  grew at a
slower pace than forecast in the first quarter as consumer
purchases cooled,  home construction  decreased and  government
spending  declined. Gross domestic product rose at a 1.8 percent
annual rate from January through March after a 3.1 percent pace
in the last three months of 2010, the Commerce Department said.  Beaten Forecasts  Of the 113 companies in the Stoxx 600 that have reported
earnings since April 11, 66 have beaten analyst forecasts for
per-share profit, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. In
the U.S., 77 percent have exceed estimates in the period.  National benchmark indexes rose in all of Europe’s 18
western markets, except Austria and  Denmark .  France ’s CAC 40
gained 2.1 percent, the U.K.’s FTSE 100 Index climbed 0.9
percent, while  Germany ’s DAX rallied 3 percent.  Ericsson jumped 16 percent, the biggest weekly gain since
2008. The company on April 27 said first-quarter net income
surged to 4.1 billion kronor ($674 million) from 1.26 billion
kronor a year earlier. Profit beat the 3.06 billion-krona
average of 19 analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  A measure of automobile shares rose 5.2 percent, the
biggest weekly increase in almost three months and the largest
gain among the 19 industry groups in the Stoxx 600.  VW Earnings  Volkswagen advanced 12 percent after the automaker on April
27 reported record first-quarter operating profit as the Audi
and VW brands attracted more Chinese customers. Earnings before
interest and tax more than tripled to 2.91 billion euros ($4.27
billion), surpassing analyst estimates.  Porsche SE increased 11 percent, the largest gain since
January. The company’s car-making division reported a first-
quarter profit gain after a revamp of the Cayenne boosted demand
for the sport-utility vehicle. Earnings before interest and
taxes “more than doubled” to 496 million euros, the company
said, without providing a year-earlier figure.  Kesko Oyj rose 9.3 percent, the most since July. Finland’s
biggest retailer reported first-quarter net income of 25 million
euros, beating the 24.7 million-euro mean estimate of eight
analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  Yara, SSAB  Yara International ASA (YAR)  gained 8 percent, the largest weekly
gain in almost nine months. The world’s largest publicly traded
nitrogen-fertilizer maker reported first-quarter net income of
2.89 billion kroner ($550 million), compared with 1.52 billion
kroner a year earlier. That topped the 2.39 billion-krone
average of 13 analyst estimates surveyed by Bloomberg. Sales
rose to 19.8 billion kroner.  SSAB Svenskt Staal AB jumped 10 percent after the world’s
largest supplier of high-tensile steel said first-quarter net
income rose to 390 million kronor ($65 million) from 143 million
kronor a year earlier. Analysts had estimated net income of 154
million kronor, according to a survey compiled by Bloomberg.  Parmalat increased 11 percent, the biggest weekly advance
since February 2009. Lactalis, France’s biggest cheesemaker, on
April 26 offered to pay 3.38 billion euros in an unsolicited bid
for the 71 percent of Parmalat it doesn’t own to create the
world’s largest dairy company.  Micro Focus International Plc rallied 9.9 percent as the
U.K. software provider said it received a preliminary, non-
binding takeover approach.  Barclays Falls  Barclays Plc (BARC) , Britain’s third-largest bank by assets,
dropped 5.5 percent. Pretax profit at its investment banking
unit fell 33 percent in the first quarter to 982 million pounds
($1.6 billion) as revenue declined 15 percent, the lender said
on April 27. The bank posted a 5 percent fall in overall net
income to 1.01 billion pounds which missed the average analyst
estimate of 1.21 billion pounds.  Electrolux AB (ELUXB)  slid 5.5 percent. The world’s second-largest
appliance maker said first-quarter net income fell to 457
million kronor from 911 million kronor a year earlier. Analysts
on average expected net income of 529 million kronor, a survey
by Bloomberg showed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
