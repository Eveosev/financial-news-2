Star Petroleum Refining Co., the
joint venture between  PTT Pcl (PTT)  and  Chevron Corp. (CVX) , said production
at its refinery in Thailand will “slow” in the fourth quarter
as it modifies units to reduce sulfur in fuels.  The company is upgrading the quality of fuel produced at
its 160,000 barrel-a-day plant to meet Euro-4 specifications,
Chief Executive Officer William Stone said in an e-mailed
statement yesterday. He declined to comment on the refinery’s
operating rates during the fourth quarter.  The upgrade will enable Star Petroleum to produce low-
sulfur fuels before Thailand’s switch to Euro-4 standards next
year, which will limit allowable sulfur content in gasoline and
diesel to 50 parts per million.  To contact the reporters on this story:
