     April 29 (Bloomberg) -- U.S. stocks gained, extending a
weekly rally in the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index, as companies
such as  Caterpillar Inc. (CAT)  and  Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co. (GT)  reported
earnings that topped analysts’ estimates.  Caterpillar jumped 2.5 percent after also raising its
forecast amid a surge in sales in developing countries and
Goodyear surged 12 percent after posting record sales.  Microsoft
Corp. (MSFT)  lost 3 percent after sales missed analysts’ predictions.
 Research In Motion Ltd. (RIM) , the maker of the BlackBerry, tumbled 14
percent after cutting its earnings forecast.  The  S&P 500  rose 0.2 percent to 1,363.61 at 4 p.m. in  New
York . The  Dow Jones Industrial Average  climbed 47.23 points, or
0.4 percent, to 12,810.54. Both gauges are trading at their
highest levels in almost three years.  “The earnings reports have been as expected or slightly
better,” said Michael Shinnick, a South Bend, Indiana-based
 money manager  at Wasatch Advisors Inc., which oversees $10.5
billion. “Companies like Caterpillar with exposure to global
growth were very strong. However, there are some pockets of
softness with debate over future strength as we saw with
Microsoft.”  The S&P 500 rose 2 percent this week and gained 2.9 percent
this month. The measure has rallied 8.4 percent in 2011 as
higher-than-estimated profit and economic reports from
manufacturing to housing bolstered investors’ confidence.
Earnings-per-share beat estimates at more than three-quarters of
the 298 companies in the S&P 500 that reported since April 11,
data compiled by Bloomberg show.  S&P 500 Forecast  Thomas J. Lee,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) ’s chief U.S. equity
strategist, raised his 2011 year-end estimate for the S&P 500 to
1,475 from 1,425, citing first-quarter earnings growth. He also
boosted his 2012 earnings-per-share estimate for companies in
the U.S. equity benchmark gauge to $105 from $102.  “First-quarter results have been impressive and are a
reminder that S&P 500 earnings-per-share results can remain
resilient despite weaker U.S. gross domestic product growth,”
Lee wrote in a report dated yesterday. “The most encouraging
aspect of first-quarter earnings has been the strength in top-
line growth.”  Sales have grown 10 percent for S&P 500 companies that have
reported quarterly results since April 11, exceeding analysts’
estimates at 71 percent of the companies. Stocks rallied
yesterday, as higher-than-estimated sales at companies such as
Sprint Nextel Corp. outweighed a report that the  U.S. economy 
grew at a slower pace than forecast in the first quarter.  Economic Data  Lower-than-estimated data on business activity and  consumer
confidence  underscored the Fed’s assessment this week that it
will probably keep  interest rates  near zero for an extended
period to bolster a “moderate” economic expansion.  The Institute for Supply Management-Chicago Inc. said today
its business barometer fell to 67.6 in April from 70.6 the prior
month, trailing the median forecast in a Bloomberg News survey
of economists for a drop to 68.2. The Thomson Reuters/University
of Michigan final index of consumer sentiment rose to 69.8 from
March’s 67.5 reading that was the lowest since November 2009.
The gauge was projected to increase to 70, according to the
median economist estimate.  Government data showed  consumer spending  in the U.S.
climbed in March as Americans spent more on food and fuel,
indicating further income gains are needed to boost the biggest
part of the economy.  Caterpillar  Caterpillar climbed 2.5 percent to $115.41 for the biggest
gain in the Dow. The world’s largest maker of construction
equipment is betting on higher mining-equipment sales with its
$8.6 billion acquisition of Bucyrus as Asian demand drives up
commodity prices. Business outside the U.S. is “booming,”
Chief Executive Officer  Doug Oberhelman  told investors and
analysts at a construction-equipment conference in Las Vegas
last month.  Industrial companies in the S&P 500 climbed 0.3 percent
collectively, the second-most among 10 industries in the
benchmark index.  Goodyear Tire & Rubber rallied 12 percent to $18.15 for the
biggest gain in the S&P 500. The largest U.S. tiremaker reported
first-quarter adjusted earnings of 51 cents a share, more than
quadrupling the 11-cent average estimate made by analysts.  Motorola Mobility Holdings Inc. rose 8.6 percent to $26.06.
The handset maker, spun off in January from parent Motorola
Inc., reported a narrower first-quarter loss than analysts
projected as it sold more Droid and Atrix phones.  SunPower Corp. (SPWRA)  jumped 35 percent to $21.69. Total SA,
 Europe ’s third-biggest oil producer, offered to buy as much as
60 percent of the second-largest U.S. solar module manufacturer
at a price of $23.25 a share.  ‘Inflation Risk’  Energy stocks surged 1.5 percent, the biggest rally out of
10 industries in the S&P 500, as the price of oil climbed
higher, capping an unprecedented eighth straight month of gains.  “Earnings numbers are so far looking pretty strong,” said
Thomas Nyheim, a Greenville, Delaware-based money manager for
Christiana Trust, which oversees $7.5 billion. “But the one
thing that keeps coming up is inflation risk, and we’re
beginning to see some of that cost pressure coming through in
the reports. There’s still a lot of caution in the market.”  Microsoft, RIM   Microsoft declined 3 percent, the most in the Dow, to
$25.92. The world’s biggest software maker reported third-
quarter sales in the Windows division that missed analysts’
predictions as consumers shunned its products in favor of
tablets such as Apple Inc.’s iPad.  RIM sank 14 percent, the most since September 2009, to
$48.65. The Waterloo, Ontario-based company cut its earnings
forecast for the quarter ending May 28 to a range of $1.30 a
share to $1.37 a share. Last month, the company had forecast
profit of $1.47 a share to $1.55 a share. Before today, it had
lost 2.7 percent this year.  Mike Abramsky , an analyst at  RBC Capital Markets  in
Toronto, slashed his price estimate for RIM stock to $55 from
$90 and his rating to “sector perform” from “top pick.” At
least four other analysts -- Jefferies & Co. Inc.’s  Peter Misek ,
Cormark Securities Inc.’s Richard Tse, Gleacher & Co.
Securities’ Stephen Patel and National Bank Financial’s Kris Thompson -- reduced their ratings on the stock.  Bank of America Corp. (BAC)  and JPMorgan paced losses in
financial companies after the two were listed as among 16
investment banks facing the first-ever European Union antitrust
probes into the swaps market. Charlotte, North Carolina-based
Bank of America slid 1.1 percent to $12.28, while New York-based
JPMorgan slumped 0.5 percent to $45.63.  To contact the reporters on this story:
