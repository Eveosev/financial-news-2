Chicago  gasoline strengthened with
inventories low in the region as demand increases with the
summer driving season.  “Demand stayed up and Magellan is at low inventories,”
Lewis Adam, president of ADMO Energy LLC, a supply consultant in
Kansas City, said in a telephone interview. The Magellan
Midstream Partners LP pipeline carries fuel from Gulf Coast
refineries to the Midwest.  The premium for conventional, 87-octane gasoline in Chicago
rose 7.63 cents to 12.75 cents a gallon versus futures traded on
the  New York Mercantile Exchange  at 12:44 p.m., according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. It is the highest level since Sept.
13. Prompt delivery gained 8.42 cents to $3.505 a gallon.  Traders will keep sending the fuel past the Group 3 hub
until the arbitrage closes, Lewis said. “The Group needs to get
their basis up or it’ll keep moving up to Chicago,” he said.  Gasoline in the Gulf Coast region rose for a fourth day
after a series of power outages at refineries in  Texas City ,
Texas, that began on April 25.  BP Plc (BP) ’s Texas City refinery started a crude unit late
yesterday, according to a person familiar with the situation.  Other process units will begin startup within the next few
days, said the person who declined to be identified because the
information isn’t public.  The discount for 87-octane, conventional gasoline in the
Gulf Coast narrowed 2.1 cents to a discount of 7 cents a gallon
versus futures. It’s the strongest level since Feb. 22.  To contact the reporter on this story:
