St. Louis Fed President James Bullard said the  Federal Reserve  often needs better information
to understand community development and issues affecting low-
and moderate-income individuals and communities,  “The appropriate data for a completely convincing analysis
is often not available,” Bullard said today to the Fed-
sponsored Community Affairs Research Conference in Arlington,
Virginia. Researchers need to “be innovative and imaginative in
devising methods of gaining knowledge in these areas despite the
difficulties involved.”  Bullard didn’t comment on the U.S. economic outlook or
monetary policy in his remarks.  Each of the 12 regional Fed banks has a division focused on
issues faced by low-income and moderate-income areas. This
year’s conference is focused on innovative research to improve
the central bank’s understanding of these communities.  Fed Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  will address the conference at
12:30 p.m. New York time. In a press conference this week,
Bernanke said “high unemployment, high gas prices and high
foreclosure rates is a -- is a terrible combination. A lot of
people are having a very tough time.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
