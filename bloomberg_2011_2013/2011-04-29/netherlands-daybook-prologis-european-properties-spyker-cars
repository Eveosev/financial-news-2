was little changed since it made a bid for the fund last week.  Since making the offer for ProLogis European, or PEPR, on
April 22, the company has received for tender or purchased in
the open market 8,818 ordinary units in the Luxembourg-based
company, ProLogis said today in a statement. That would bring

compared with 38.9 percent when the bid was made.  WHAT TO WATCH:
