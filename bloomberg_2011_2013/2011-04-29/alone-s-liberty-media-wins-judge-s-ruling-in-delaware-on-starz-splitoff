John C. Malone, the billionaire
chairman of Liberty Media Corp., won a ruling from Delaware
Chancery Court Judge J. Travis Laster that his splitoff of the
Capital Group and Starz Group won’t violate an agreement
involving Bank of New York Mellon.  Liberty sued the bank as bond trustee in August 2010 asking
the Wilmington court to declare that the splitoff wouldn’t
constitute a disposition of assets upon which bondholders have
claims, Laster said in a 35-page ruling released today.  “Liberty did not engage in an ‘overall scheme’ to sell
substantially all its assets,” and “is entitled to a
declaration that the Capital splitoff does not violate” the
contract provision, Laster wrote.  Englewood, Colorado-based Liberty said last June it planned
to separate the Liberty Capital and Liberty Starz tracking stock
groups from Liberty Interactive tracking stock group, in part as
an efficiency move.  The ruling is subject to appeal, Liberty spokeswoman
Courtnee Ulrich said in a statement.  Kevin Heine, a Bank of New York Mellon spokesman, couldn’t
immediately comment on the ruling.  Class A shares of Liberty Media Corp. - Interactive rose 69
cents, or 4.1 percent, to $17.48 at 4:15 p.m. New York time in
Nasdaq Stock Market trading.  The case is Liberty Media Corp. v. The Bank of New York
Mellon Trust Co., CA5702, Delaware Chancery Court (Wilmington).  To contact the reporter on this story:
