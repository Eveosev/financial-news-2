CRC Credit Bureau Ltd ., one of
three licensed credit bureaus in  Nigeria , signed up 22 of the
country’s 24 banks to examine the credit history of customers
seeking loans, Managing Director Tunde Popoola said.  “All banks have now complied with the directive of the
 Central Bank  to have data exchange agreements with at least two
credit bureaus,” Popoola said yesterday in an interview in
Lagos, Nigeria’s commercial capital. “For instance, 22 of the
24 banks have signed data exchange agreements with us.”  Under new guidelines given to banks following a debt crisis
in  Africa ’s top oil producer in 2009, lenders are required to
“obtain information on customers applying for loans from at
least two credit bureaus,” Mohammed Abdullahi, a spokesman for
the  Central Bank of Nigeria , said yesterday in a telephone
interview. Banks “don’t need the permission of the customer
before they can exchange” data with credit bureaus, he said.  The debt crisis arose from loans to speculators on the
local stock market and operators in the oil and gas industry
that threatened the banking sector with collapse. Policy makers
fired chief executives at eight banks and spent 620 billion
naira ($4 billion) bailing out lenders.  CRC Credit Bureau was formed by a group of 12 Nigerian
financial institutions in association with  Dun & Bradstreet
Corp. (DNB) , a credit information service provider, according to its
 website .  To contact the reporter on this story:
