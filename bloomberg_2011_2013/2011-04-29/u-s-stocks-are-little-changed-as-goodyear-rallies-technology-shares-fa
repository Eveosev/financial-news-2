Caterpillar Inc. (CAT)  and Goodyear Tire
& Rubber Co. were among  U.S. stocks to rally after reporting
higher-than-forecast earnings, while declines in financial and
technology shares left benchmark indexes little changed.    Caterpillar jumped 2.3 percent after also raising its
forecast amid a surge in sales in developing countries, while
Goodyear surged 11 percent. SunPower Corp. jumped 37 percent as
Total SA offered to buy as much as 60 percent of the company.
Research In Motion Ltd., the maker of the BlackBerry, tumbled 14
percent after cutting its earnings forecast.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index slipped less than 0.1
percent to 1,359.63 at 10:05 a.m. in  New York . The  Dow Jones
Industrial Average  climbed 22.63 points, or 0.2 percent, to
12,785.94.  The  S&P 500  has risen 1.7 percent so far this week and is
set to post a 2.5 percent gain this month. The measure has
rallied 8.2 percent in 2011 as higher-than-estimated profit and
economic reports from manufacturing to housing bolstered
investors’ confidence.  Earnings-per-share beat estimates at more than three-
quarters of the 298 companies in the S&P 500 that have reported
results since April 11, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
