KA Finanz AG’s credit-default-swap
portfolio has a “negative market value” of 986 million euros
($1.5 billion), the state-owned “bad bank” that took on toxic
assets of Kommunalkredit Austria AG, said in its annual report
today.  KA Finanz, based in Vienna, said that it reviewed all CDSs
it has sold and sees no need to book provisions for a possible
default event beyond the 139.8 million euros it has set aside
for losses so far, according to the report  posted on its
website .  KA Finanz took on securities, loans and CDSs representing a
total exposure of 27.7 billion euros when it was spun off in
2009 from nationalized lender, Kommunalkredit. The vehicle’s
purpose is to wind down the securities by selling them or
letting them mature or expire. The exposure fell to 24.7 billion
euros by the end of 2010, it said April 13.  CDS are derivatives whose seller must pay the buyer face
value if a borrower defaults. The CDSs KA Finanz has sold
guaranteed 10.5 billion euros by the end of 2010. Most of the
CDSs expire between 2015 and 2017, according to Chief Executive
Officer Alois Steinbichler.  The portfolio includes 189.5 million euros in Greek, 726.3
million euros in Irish and 686.4 million euros in Portuguese
government debt which KA Finanz insured against default with
CDSs, it said in the annual report. Also including bonds and
loans, its exposure to the three euro-area countries receiving
European Union aid adds up to 2.68 billion euros.  To contact the reporter on this story:
