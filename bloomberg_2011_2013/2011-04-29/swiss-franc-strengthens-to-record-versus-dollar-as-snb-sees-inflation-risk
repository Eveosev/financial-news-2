The  Swiss franc  strengthened to a
record against the dollar, appreciating as much as 0.8 percent
to 86.70 centimes, before trading at 86.71 centimes per dollar
as of 10:40 a.m. in London.  Switzerland ’s leading economic indicator unexpectedly
increased in April, signaling the economy is gaining momentum.  The monthly gauge that aims to predict the economy’s
direction about six months ahead climbed to 2.29 compared with a
revised 2.25 in March, the KOF Swiss Economic Institute in
Zurich said in a statement today. That’s the highest since
August 2006. Economists expected a decline to 2.20, according to
the median of seven in a Bloomberg News survey.  To contact the reporter on this story:
