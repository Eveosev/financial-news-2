Ukraine is seeking Azerbaijan’s
support for a long-delayed project to extend an oil pipeline
from the port of Odessa on the  Black Sea  to the Baltic coast,
bypassing Russia.  “We will work to make sure that this oil pipeline reaches
the  Baltic Sea ,” Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych said
yesterday after meeting with his Azeri counterpart Ilham Aliyev
in Baku, according to the Azeri state news agency Azertaj.  Poland, Azerbaijan, Ukraine and Kazakhstan agreed in 2005
to extend the Odessa-Brody pipeline to Poland’s Gdansk terminal
on the Baltic Sea. Ukraine at the time planned to boost its
capacity to ship as much as 40 million metric tons of oil a year
(800,000 barrels a day).  The two countries are also continuing “active” talks with
Kiev on the supply of liquefied natural gas to Ukraine, Aliyev
said after the meeting, Azertaj said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
