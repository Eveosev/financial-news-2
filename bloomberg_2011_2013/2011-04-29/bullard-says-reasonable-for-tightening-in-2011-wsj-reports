Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis
President  James Bullard  said it’s “reasonable” to expect the
central bank will begin tightening by the end of 2011 in order
to get ahead of inflation, the Wall Street Journal reported.  “We’ve got to start taking some steps to start to tighten
monetary policy as we continue on through 2011 to make sure we
don’t allow inflation to get away from us,” he said in an
interview with the newspaper that appeared on the Journal’s Web
site today. He added that rising prices and inflation
expectations are “making me a little bit nervous.”  The  Federal Open Market Committee , which met earlier this
week in  Washington , had a “robust discussion” about what the
first steps to reverse accommodative policy should be, Bullard
said. A majority at the Fed is against sales from the central
bank’s portfolio of more than $900 billion in mortgage-backed
securities and $1.4 trillion of Treasuries, he said. It’s “not
exactly clear which way is optimal,” the regional bank
president said.  Bullard, who favors asset sales, said officials are forming
a general outline of how the tightening process will play out.
The Fed likely will allow its $2.5 trillion portfolio to shrink
gradually by ending the reinvestment of proceeds from maturing
securities, the Journal said.  The interview was published during what is traditionally a
blackout period for Fed officials following a FOMC meeting.  To contact the reporter on this story:
