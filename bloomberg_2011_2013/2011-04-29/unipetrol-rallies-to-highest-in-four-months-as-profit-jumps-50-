Unipetrol AS (UNIP)  rallied to its highest
level in almost four months after the biggest oil refiner in the
 Czech Republic  said its first-quarter profit rose an annual 50
percent as higher prices of oil boosted the value of its
inventories.  The stock surged as much as 4.5 percent to 197.5 koruna,
its strongest intraday level since Jan. 4, and traded up 2.7
percent at 194 koruna as of 12:26 p.m. in Prague.  To contact the reporter on this story:
