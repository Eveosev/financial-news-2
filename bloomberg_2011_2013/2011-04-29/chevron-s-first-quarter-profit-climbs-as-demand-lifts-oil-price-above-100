Chevron Corp. (CVX) , the second-largest
U.S. oil company, said first-quarter profit rose 36 percent as
economic growth and supply disruptions drove crude prices above
$100 a barrel.  Net income rose to $6.21 billion, or $3.09 a share, from
$4.55 billion, or $2.27, a year earlier, San Ramon, California-
based Chevron said in a statement today. The company was
expected to report per-share profit of $2.99, based on the
average of two analysts’ estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Sales
rose 25 percent to $60.3 billion.  Global demand for petroleum-derived fuels rose 2.9 percent
during the first quarter, led by growth in  China ,  Brazil  and
 India , according to the International Energy Agency. Oil futures
traded in  New York  climbed 20 percent to average $94.60 a barrel
amid civil unrest in North Africa and the Middle East that
imperiled crude supplies.  The company beat analysts’ estimates “because of pricing,
so from the standpoint of earnings quality that’s not really a
great reason to beat,” said Pavel Molchanov, an analyst at
Raymond James & Associates Inc. in Houston who owns Chevron
shares and has an “outperform” rating on the company.  Chevron rose 63 cents to $109.44 at 4:15 p.m. in New York
Stock Exchange composite trading. The stock, which has gained 20
percent this year, has 19 buy ratings from analysts and six
holds.  Refinery Profit  Profit from the company’s oil and natural-gas business
increased 27 percent to $5.98 billion as higher commodity prices
offset a less than 1 percent decline in output. Chevron pumped
the equivalent of 2.76 million barrels of crude during the
period, down from 2.78 million a year earlier, according to the
statement.  Chevron’s refineries earned $622 million, more than three
times the profit of the first quarter of 2010.  Chevron plans to spend $26 billion in 2011 to explore for
crude, construct gas-export plants and repair oil refineries.
Chief Executive Officer John Watson has been reducing refining
and retail operations to concentrate on higher-profit ventures
such as deep-water exploration in places such as the U.S. Gulf
of  Mexico  and  Australia .  Chevron announced two U.S. Gulf projects last year with a
combined value of $11.5 billion that will tap deep-water oil
fields, part of Watson’s plan to boost output by 20 percent by
the end of 2017.  Last month, the company received one of the first permits
to resume exploratory drilling in the Gulf since the U.S.
suspended such work in response to the Deepwater Horizon tragedy
that killed 11 rig workers and led to the biggest U.S. offshore
oil spill.  Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) , based in Irving,  Texas , is the largest
U.S. oil company. Exxon yesterday reported a 69 percent rise in
net income for the first quarter, to $10.7 billion.  To contact the reporter on this story:
