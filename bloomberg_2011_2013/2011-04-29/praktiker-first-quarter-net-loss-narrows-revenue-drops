Praktiker AG narrowed its first-
quarter net loss to 15.5 million euros from 37.5 million euros
in the year ago period, the company said in a statement today.
Sales fell 11 percent.  The second quarter will provide “decisive guidance” for the
full year targets, Chief Executive Officer Wolfgang Werner said
in the statement. “During the first quarter, sales and earnings
did not develop in such a way that would make it easier to
achieve these targets,” Werner said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
