A U.K. regulator that supervises
some National Health Service hospitals estimates that hospitals
must cut their costs by 6 percent to 7 percent a year to be sure
of balancing their books, the Financial Times reported.  That compares with annual savings of 4 percent demanded by
the government at the end of 2010 and means the state hospital
service must take 2.9 billion pounds ($4.8 billion) out of its
costs in the 2011-12 financial year alone, the newspaper said.  Nigel Edwards, the acting chief executive officer of the
NHS Confederation, said it’s doubtful whether hospitals can make
the savings demanded by the regulator, called Monitor, without
“fundamental changes in the way services are delivered,” the
FT reported.  Compounded over the five years for which Monitor has
published projections, the hospitals savings target is 37
percent, the newspaper said.  John Appleby, the chief economist at the King’s Fund, a
policy review group, said it’s difficult to see how such a rate
of cost-cutting can be sustained for five years, the FT added.  To contact the reporter on this story:
