to 42,600 won. “Speculation that  China  may increase tightening
of the  property market  and raise  interest rates  in May is
affecting sentiment because such moves could slow steel demand
and pricing,” Jeon Seung Hun, a Seoul-based analyst with Daewoo
Securities Co., said by phone today.  Doosan Infracore Co. (042670 KS), South Korea’s biggest
construction-equipment maker, climbed 3.7 percent to 29,600 won,
the highest close since April 8. The company said first-quarter
operating profit increased 69 percent and that it agreed to sell
its forklift business.  KB Financial Group Inc. (105560)  (105560 KS), the owner of South
Korea’s largest lender, gained 5.1 percent to 57,500 won, the
steepest jump since July 23. First-quarter profit rose 23
percent to 757.6 billion won ($707 million) as lending margins
widened and bad-loan provisions fell, according to a filing from
the company.  Samsung Electronics Co. (005930 KS), the world’s largest
maker of TVs and flat-screen panels, fell 0.8 percent to 893,000
won, falling for a second day. The company said consumer-
electronics sales may stay muted in the second quarter. Samsung
reported a 30 percent drop in first-quarter net income as
competition drove down prices.  Seoul Semiconductor Co. (046890 KS) retreated 6 percent to
32,050 won, the lowest close since Aug. 10, 2009. The company’s
lowered profit guidance prompted Daewoo Securities Co. and LIG
Investment & Securities Co. to cut their share-price estimates.  To contact the reporter on this story:
