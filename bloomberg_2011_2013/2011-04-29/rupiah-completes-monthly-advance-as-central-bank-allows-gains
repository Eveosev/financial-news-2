Indonesia ’s rupiah completed a
third monthly gain as policy makers signaled they will allow
appreciation and the U.S. Federal Reserve renewed a pledge to
keep  interest rates  low.  Bank Indonesia  will provide “more room” for the rupiah to
appreciate as a stronger currency eases pressure from imported
inflation, Deputy Governor Budi Mulya said yesterday. The
currency reached the strongest level in seven years yesterday
after the Fed left its benchmark lending rate in a range of zero
to 0.25 percent, boosting the appeal of higher-yielding assets.  “Bank Indonesia is bullish on the currency, but at the
same time it will try to smooth volatility,” said Lindawati Susanto, head of treasury at PT Bank Resona Perdania in Jakarta.
“The Fed decision is making the  U.S. dollar  weaker.”  The rupiah gained 1.7 percent this month and 0.6 percent
this week to 8,563 per dollar as of 3:10 p.m. in Jakarta,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The currency rose 0.3
percent today and reached the strongest level since April 2004.  Consumer prices rose 6.65 percent last month from a year
earlier, compared with an increase of 6.84 percent in February,
according to official data. The Central Bureau of Statistics
will publish the inflation data for this month on May 2.  Indonesia government’s benchmark bonds gained this week,
with the yield on the 8.25 percent bond due July 2021 dropping
nine basis points this week to 7.74 percent, according to midday
prices from the Inter-Dealer Market Association.  To contact the reporter on this story:
