Angola plans to lower  interest
rates  below 10 percent, President Jose Eduardo  dos Santos  told a
congress of the ruling party in Futungo, south of the capital,
Luanda, today. The overnight lending rate is currently set at
15.75 percent.  Dos Santos also said that Africa has become a “rehearsal
field” for neo-colonialism and that leading powers were
reverting to the methods of the cold war. Their goal is to gain
“easy access” to raw materials, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
