U.S. Trade Representative Ron Kirk
said “serious gaps” separate participants in the Doha round of
World Trade Organization talks and the U.S. is committed to
closing them.  “It is clear that serious gaps remain and the path ahead
is uncertain,” Kirk said in a statement e-mailed today. “The
 United States  is committed to pursuing any option that is
reasonably likely to break the logjam.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
