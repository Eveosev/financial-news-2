Treasuries had their biggest
monthly return since August as cooling economic growth and the
 Federal Reserve ’s commitment to sustain monetary stimulus
spurred demand for the safety of government debt.  Two-year note yields had the biggest monthly drop since
January 2010 as business in the U.S. grew less than forecast and
consumer-spending growth slowed. Ten- and 30-year debt rose
today amid month-end buying. Fed Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said
this week the central bank will finish buying $600 billion of
debt in June, as planned, while holding  interest rates  at almost
zero, where they’ve been since December 2008.  “There were some expectations embedded in the psychology
of the marketplace expecting a little more hawkish of a tone”
from the Fed, said Russ Certo, a managing director and co-head
of rates trading at Gleacher & Co. in  New York . “Bernanke
simply didn’t meet those expectations, and the market has traded
better as a result.”  Yields on two-year notes fell two basis points, or 0.02
percentage point, to 0.61 percent at 5 p.m. in New York,
according to Bloomberg Bond Trader prices. They touched 0.60
percent, the lowest level since March 21, after earlier rising
as much as two basis points. The price of the 0.625 percent
security due in April 2013 increased 1/32, or 31 cents per
$1,000 face amount, to 100 1/32.  Two-year yields dropped 22 basis points this month, the
most since a decrease of 32 basis points in January 2010. The
fell five basis points for the week.  Ten-Year Yields  Ten-year yields declined two basis points to 3.29 percent
and touched 3.28 percent, the least since March 23. They fell 18
basis points in April in the first monthly drop since sliding 44
basis points in August, and slid 10 basis points this week.
Thirty-year yields lost two basis points to 4.40 percent.  Treasuries gained as some investors purchased longer-term
debt to increase the duration of their portfolios to match
benchmarks at the end of the month, such as the Barclays U.S.
Treasury Index. Duration measures how sensitive a bond’s price
is to changes in yield.  “We are seeing some month-end extension buying and the
continuation of the benefits from Bernanke’s dovish tone helping
support the market,” Gleacher’s Certo said.  The Barclays index is expected to extend by 0.08 year at
the end of April, the same as for March, according to the firm,
one of 20 primary dealers that trade with the Fed.  Treasuries have returned 1 percent this month, the most
since August, according to the Bank of America Merrill Lynch
Treasury Master index. The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index has
returned 2.6 percent during the period.  Business Barometer  The Institute for Supply Management-Chicago Inc. said today
its business barometer fell to 67.6 this month, from 70.6 in
March. The median forecast in a Bloomberg News survey of
economists called for a decline to 68.2. Figures greater than 50
signal expansion.  Government bonds  rose yesterday as Commerce Department data
showed U.S. economic growth slowed to a 1.8 percent annual pace
in the first quarter from a 3.1 percent pace in the fourth.  Personal spending rose 0.6 percent after a revised 0.9
percent gain the prior month that was higher than previously
estimated, Commerce Department figures showed today. The data
also showed inflation has picked up from a year ago. The measure
tied to spending patterns increased 1.8 percent from March 2010,
following a 1.6 percent gain in the 12 months ended in February.  Measure of Expectations  A bond market measure of inflation expectations the Fed
uses to help determine monetary policy was at 2.96 percentage
points, compared with a 2011 low of 2.77 percentage points on
Feb. 16 and a three-month high of 3.13 percentage points on
April 15. The five-year forward break-even rate projects what
the pace of consumer price increases may be beginning in 2016.
It averaged 2.78 percentage points over the past five years.  “The market is battling the notion that there are
inflationary risks in the system with the reality that growth
has been slower than even the Fed thought it would be,” said
 Ian Lyngen , a government bond strategist at CRT Capital Group
LLC in  Stamford ,  Connecticut . “It doesn’t mean inflation risks
are off the table, but slower growth is an offset.”  Bernanke indicated during a press conference on April 27
the Fed will maintain record monetary stimulus once large-scale
bond purchases end in June, while the need to cap inflation
means further easing is unlikely. He wouldn’t predict when
stimulus would end.  The central bank said in November it would buy Treasuries
through the middle of 2011 to spur economic growth. It purchased
$6.68 billion of U.S. debt today due from November 2013 to March
2015 as part of the plan. The acquisition amounted to 22.5
percent of the $29.6 billion in securities submitted by dealers.
The average at the Fed’s past 10 purchases was 26.5 percent.  Rate Wagers  The likelihood policy makers will raise the target rate for
overnight lending between banks at their March 2012 meeting
decreased to 44 percent, from 61 percent a month ago, Fed funds
futures showed. The benchmark is zero to 0.25 percent.  President  Barack Obama  has offered the outlines of a
program to reduce the debt by $4 trillion over 12 years through
a combination of spending cuts and tax increases.  The pace of U.S. industrial production may cool temporarily
as some factories work to replace supplies of parts interrupted
after the March 11 earthquake and tsunami in  Japan . Production
rose 0.8 percent in March, according to a Fed report April 15.  To contact the reporter on this story:
