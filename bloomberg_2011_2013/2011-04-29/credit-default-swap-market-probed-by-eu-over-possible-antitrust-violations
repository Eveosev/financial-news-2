The European Union opened two
antitrust investigations into the market for credit default
swaps.  EU antitrust regulators “will examine whether 16
investment banks and Markit, the leading provider of financial
information in the CDS market, have colluded and/or may hold and
abuse a dominant position in order to control the financial
information on CDS,” the European Commission said in an e-
mailed statement today. “In the second case, the commission
opened proceedings against nine of the banks and ICE Clear
 Europe , the leading clearing house for CDS,” it said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
