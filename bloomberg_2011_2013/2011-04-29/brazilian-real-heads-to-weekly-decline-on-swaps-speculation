Yields on most Brazilian interest-
rate futures contracts maturing in 2012 or later fell after the
 Finance Ministry  said Brazil will cancel spending from previous
budgets, prompting bets the central bank may rely less on
interest-rate increases to tame inflation.  The yield on the interest-rate futures contracts due in
January fell two basis point, or 0.02 percentage point, to 12.31
percent at 12:09 p.m. in  New York . The yield on the contract due
in January 2016 fell 5 basis points to 12.56 percent.  Brazil will cancel planned spending from previous budgets
that may reduce public expenditures by as much as 10 billion
reais ($6.4 billion), the Finance Ministry said in a statement
posted on its website. The central bank announced earlier today
that the country’s budget surplus before interest payments rose
to 13.6 billion reais in March, the highest level for the month
since at least 2001.  The fiscal results and additional cuts “reinforce a
strategy of less interest-rate hikes,” said  Roberto Padovani ,
chief-economist at Banco WestLB do Brasil SA in Sao Paulo.  The primary surplus, which includes federal and local
governments as well as state companies, rose from 7.9 billion
reais in February, the central bank said in a statement
distributed today in Brasilia. The surplus was more than the
12.1 billion reais median forecast in a Bloomberg survey of 12
analysts.  The  budget deficit  narrowed to 6.9 billion reais, from 11.2
billion reais in February, the central bank said.  “The numbers were reasonably good, but the economy needs
to cool down more,” Eduardo Galasini, head of proprietary
trading at Banco Banif Primus in Sao Paulo, said in a telephone
interview. The March fiscal results and new cuts “show the
government is being pro-active in the fiscal area,” he said.  Real’s Performance  Brazil ’s real, the worst performer this week among 25
emerging-market currencies tracked by Bloomberg, headed to a
weekly drop as the central bank offered reverse swap contracts
in the futures market to stem the currency’s two-year rally.  The real has slid 0.4 percent this week to 1.5710 per
dollar at 12:49 p.m. in New York. It gained 0.3 percent today
from 1.5780 yesterday.  The central bank is auctioning 30,000 reverse-currency
swaps maturing in August 2011 today, according to a bank
statement.  Brazil is seeking to slow the real’s appreciation to shore
up exporters, who are seeing their profits eroded in local-
currency terms. The real has surged 47 percent since the end of
2008, the most among 25 emerging-market currencies tracked by
Bloomberg.  To contact the reporters on this story:
