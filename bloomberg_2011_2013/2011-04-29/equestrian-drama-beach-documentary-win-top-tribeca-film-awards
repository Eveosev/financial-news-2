“Bombay Beach,” a documentary
about lost souls in a desolate area of  Southern California , and
“She Monkeys,” a drama about a rivalry between young
equestrians, won the top awards at the 10th  Tribeca Film
Festival .  “Bombay Beach,” directed by Israeli Alma Har’el, won the
award for best documentary feature. “She Monkeys,” from
Sweden’s Lisa Aschan, was honored as best narrative feature.
Both are first-time feature directors.  The winners were announced last night at a ceremony in  New
York . The 12-day festival, co-founded by  Robert De Niro , ends
Sunday.  Shami Bizimana was named best actor in a narrative feature
for his performance in “Grey Matter” as a Rwandan traumatized
by civil war. Carice van Houten was voted best actress for
“Black Butterflies,” in which she plays a troubled South
African poet.  Winners of the narrative feature and documentary awards
receive $25,000 apiece. The acting winners each get $2,500.  Jurors for the documentary award included comedian  Whoopi Goldberg , actor Michael Cera and producer/director Amir Bar-Lev.
