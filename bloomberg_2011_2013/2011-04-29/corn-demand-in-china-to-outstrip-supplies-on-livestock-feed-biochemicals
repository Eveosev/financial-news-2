China ’s demand for corn will grow
faster than supply in the next 10 years on rising production of
livestock feed and biochemicals, Grain News reported, citing
Shang Qiangmin, the director of the China National Grain & Oils
Information Center.  The growth of industrial use in the past few years has
“exceeded imagination,” Shang told a grain conference,
according to the newspaper. For the year through Sept. 30, the
volume of corn used to produce starch and other biochemical
products will surge by 5 million metric tons from a year ago to
50 million tons, Shang was cited as saying.  China cannot plug the corn shortage through imports because
global prices are higher and the quantity is limited, so it has
to curb demand, the paper said, citing Shang.  Shang’s center forecast China’s output last year at 172.5
million tons versus consumption of 172 million tons, the
newspaper said. The output is regarded as too high by other
researchers and the figures do not match the reality of surging
prices, the paper said.  --William Bi. Editor: James Poole  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
