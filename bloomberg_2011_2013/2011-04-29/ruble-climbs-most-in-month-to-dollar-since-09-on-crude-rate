The ruble had its biggest monthly
gain since September 2009 versus the dollar as oil traded near a
31-month high and  Russia ’s central bank unexpectedly raised its
benchmark rate to tame inflation.  The Russian currency strengthened for a fifth day,
advancing 0.6 percent against the dollar to 27.3575 by the 5
p.m. close of trading, its strongest level since December 2008.
That extended its weekly gain to 2.4 percent and its monthly
advance to 3.9 percent.  Bank Rossii today raised the refinancing rate to 8.25
percent from 8 percent, its second increase this year. Fifteen
of 20 economists in a Bloomberg survey expected no change. Oil,
Russia’s chief export earner was poised to rise for an
unprecedented eighth straight month as better-than-expected
 consumer spending  signaled fuel demand may increase.  Russia’s inflation rate has been above the central bank’s
target of between 6 percent to 7 percent for this year since
October, driven by rising food and fuel prices.  The ruble was 0.3 percent stronger at 40.63 against the
euro, leaving it up 0.5 percent versus the central bank’s
dollar-euro target basket at 33.3301. Bank Rossii uses the
basket to smooth exchange-rate fluctuations that can hurt
exporters’ competitiveness.  -- Editors: Alexander Nicholson, Linda Shen  To contact the reporters on this story:
