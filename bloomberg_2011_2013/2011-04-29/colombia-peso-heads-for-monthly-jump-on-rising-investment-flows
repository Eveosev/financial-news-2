Colombia ’s peso headed for the
biggest monthly jump in two years amid rising foreign direct
investment flows into the South American country.  The peso has climbed 6.5 percent in the past month to
1770.15 per  U.S. dollar  at 12:09 p.m. New York time. Yesterday
it touched 1,762.71 its strongest level since July 2008. The
currency is down 0.2 percent today and up 0.7 percent this week.  This year, the peso has jumped 7.8 percent, the best
performance among six Latin American currencies tracked by
Bloomberg. Bets policy makers will announce currency measures in
the central bank’s monetary policy meeting today led the peso to
decline 0.5 percent earlier this week.  “Strong FDI flows are coming in,” said Guillermo Puentes,
head trader at Banco de Comercio Exterior de Colombia SA, known
as Bancoldex. “The government will have to do something at some
point to stem gains, especially as you get more and more voices
from exporters complaining about jobs being in jeopardy.”  Puentes forecasts Banco de la Republica will increase the
amount of dollars it purchases daily in the  spot market . The
bank in February extended a plan to buy a minimum of $20 million
daily until “at least” June 17.  The yield on the nation’s 10 percent bonds due July 2024
fell two basis points, or 0.02 percentage point, to 8.42
percent, according to Colombia’s stock exchange. The security’s
price rose 0.169 centavo to 112.254 centavos per peso.  To contact the reporter on this story:
