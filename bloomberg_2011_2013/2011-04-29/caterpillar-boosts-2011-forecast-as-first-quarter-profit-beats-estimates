Caterpillar Inc. (CAT) , the world’s
largest maker of construction equipment, posted first-quarter
profit that topped analysts’ estimates and raised its full-year
earnings forecast as sales surged in  developing countries .  Net income rose more than fivefold to $1.23 billion, or
$1.84 a share, from $233 million, or 36 cents, a year earlier,
the Peoria, Illinois-based company said in a statement today.
The average estimate of 21 analysts in a Bloomberg survey was
$1.31 a share. Sales rose to 57 percent to $12.9 billion from
$8.24 billion.  Full-year earnings will be $6.25 to $6.75 a share on $52
billion to $54 billion of revenue, not including income from the
acquisitions of MWM Holding GmbH and Bucyrus International Inc.
The previous forecast was profit “near” $6 on sales of more
than $50 billion. Earnings will be $6.30 on sales of $51.9
billion, according to average estimates in the Bloomberg survey.  Caterpillar is betting on higher mining-equipment sales
with its $8.6 billion acquisition of Bucyrus as Asian demand
drives up commodity prices. The Bucyrus deal is expected to be
complete in mid-2011. Business outside the U.S. is “booming,”
Chief Executive Officer  Doug Oberhelman  told investors and
analysts at the CONEXPO-CON/AGG construction-equipment
conference in  Las Vegas  last month.  “People are focused on guidance,” Ted Grace, an analyst
for Susquehanna Financial Group, which is a market maker for
Caterpillar, said in an interview before the earnings.  “Margins will be hugely important,” said Grace, who has a
“positive” rating on the stock. “That’s been a key point of
debate on Caterpillar: How efficiently is the company ramping up
profits to volume?”  The company’s earnings were little changed during the last
surge in demand when sales rose 24 percent from 2006 through
2008.  The company aims to deliver earnings of $8 to $10 a share
in 2012 as demand for excavators, trucks and wheel loaders
increases amid greater consumption of commodities and
construction of roads, bridges and buildings in countries such
as China, India and  Brazil .  Caterpillar rose 3 cents to $112.64 in New York Stock
Exchange composite trading yesterday. The shares have climbed 20
percent this year, the best performer after Boeing Co. on the
 Dow Jones Industrial Average .  To contact the reporter on this story:
