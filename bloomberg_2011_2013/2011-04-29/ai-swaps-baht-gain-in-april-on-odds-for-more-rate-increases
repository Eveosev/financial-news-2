Thailand ’s baht and onshore
interest-rate swaps advanced this month on speculation the
central bank will raise borrowing costs further to rein in
consumer-price gains, boosting the nation’s yield appeal.  Rates are inappropriate even after six increases since June
as inflation risks exceed threats to growth, Bank of Thailand
Assistant Governor Paiboon Kittisrikangwan said yesterday. The
 Federal Reserve  kept its target rate between zero and 0.25
percent this week, where it’s been since December 2008.  “The BOT has continuously hiked rates this year and
remains hawkish after every rate hike, boosting speculation
Thailand will increase rates more than previously expected,”
said Kozo Hasegawa, a currency trader at Sumitomo Mitsui Banking
Corp. in Bangkok. “There’s a weak dollar trend as the Fed
pledged to maintain its easy monetary policy.”  The baht climbed 1.1 percent this month to 29.93 per dollar
as of 3:17 p.m. in Bangkok, a third monthly advance, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg. The currency reached 29.81 on
April 27, the strongest level since Nov. 16. It was little
changed today and from a week ago.  The onshore one-year interest-rate swap, the fixed cost
needed to receive a floating payment, climbed 25.5 basis points
in April and 19.5 basis points this week to 3.115 percent. The
rate reached 3.17 percent yesterday, the highest since November
2008. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  The Bank of Thailand lifted the one-day bond repurchase
rate by a quarter of a percentage point to 2.75 percent last
week.  A government report on May 2 may show consumer prices rose
3.2 percent in April from a year earlier, the most since August,
according to the median estimate of economists in a Bloomberg
survey.  Southeast Asia ’s second-largest economy will expand 4.1
percent in 2011, driving inflation to 3.9 percent for the year,
the central bank said yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
