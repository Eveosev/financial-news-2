DoubleLine Capital LP, the Los
Angeles-based firm started by  Jeffrey Gundlach , is joining with
Aston Asset Management LP to open a bond mutual fund.  The Aston/DoubleLine Opportunistic Bond Fund will be
managed by a team led by Gundlach and will be sold by Chicago-
based Aston Funds, the companies said today in a statement. The
fund, which the firms expect to open in July, will invest in
mortgage-backed securities, U.S. and global government and
corporate debt, high-yield and municipal bonds, according to a
regulatory filing today.  Gundlach, 51, was the investment chief of Los Angeles-based
TCW Group Inc. until he was ousted in December 2009 after
clashing with top executives. DoubleLine has gathered $10
billion in assets. Gundlach and President Philip Barach run the
$6.4 billion DoubleLine Total Return Bond Fund, which has gained
17 percent in the past year to beat 99 percent of peers,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  DoubleLine partnered with another firm,  Chicago ’s
RiverNorth Capital Management LLC, to open the
RiverNorth/DoubleLine Strategic Income Fund on Dec. 30.
Excluding the Aston and RiverNorth funds, DoubleLine manages
four mutual funds, including one that buys emerging-market debt
and one that invests across assets such as stocks, bonds and
commodities.  Aston offers two dozen mutual funds managed by investment
firms including  MFS Investment Management  in  Boston  and Lake
Partners Inc. in Greenwich,  Connecticut .  To contact the reporter on this story:
