PKN Orlen SA, Poland’s largest oil
company,  expects to receive bids for its Lithuanian unit within
days, Jacek Krawiec, chief executive officer, said at a news
conference in Warsaw today.  Orlen, which bought AB Mazeikiu Nafta in 2006 and later
renamed it Orlen Lietuva, hired Nomura Holdings Inc. to advise
on the future of the unit after profitability was hurt by the
shutdown of a Russian pipeline that supplied crude, as well as
lack of access to a sea terminal for exports.  Orlen expects to make a decision on the unit in the current
quarter, Chief Financial Officer Slawomir Jedrzejczyk said
today, reiterating that “several” bidders are interested.
Orlen may sell as much as 100 percent of Lietuva, or keep the
subsidiary, he said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
