U.S. nuclear-power output rose from
its lowest level in more than 10 years as  Public Service
Enterprise Group Inc. (PEG)  boosted the Salem 1 reactor in  New Jersey ,
the  Nuclear Regulatory Commission  said.  Power generation nationwide increased 994 megawatts, or 1.4
percent, from yesterday to 71,277 megawatts, or 70 percent of
capacity, according to an NRC report today and data compiled by
Bloomberg. Twenty-nine of the nation’s 104 reactors were
offline.  Public Service raised output from the 1,174-megawatt Salem
1 unit to 75 percent of capacity from 8 percent yesterday. The
reactor was shut April 21 when water intake filters became
clogged. Another unit at the site, 1,130-megawatt Salem 2, is
closed.  The plant is about 18 miles (29 kilometers) south of
Wilmington, Delaware.  Energy Future Holdings Corp. raised output from the 1,150-
megawatt Comanche Peak 2 to 91 percent of capacity from 77
percent yesterday. The 1,200-megawatt Comanche Peak Unit 1 is
producing at full power. The plant is 66 miles southwest of
 Dallas .  The nation’s nuclear output fell to 70,283 megawatts
yesterday, its lowest level since Oct. 22, 2000, after storms
tore across the South, killing hundreds and knocking out all
three reactors at the Browns Ferry plant in  Alabama .  Browns Ferry has a combined capacity of 3,284 megawatts,
enough to power 2.6 million average U.S. homes, according to
U.S. Energy Department statistics. The plant is about 84 miles
north of Birmingham.  Some reactors close for maintenance and refueling during
the spring and fall in the U.S., when demand for heating and
cooling is lower. The outages can increase consumption of
natural gas and coal to generate electricity.  The average U.S. reactor  refueling outage  lasted 41 days in
2009, according to the  Nuclear Energy Institute .  To contact the reporter on this story:
