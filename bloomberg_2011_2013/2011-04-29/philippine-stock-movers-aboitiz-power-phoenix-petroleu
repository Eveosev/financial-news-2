Shares of the following companies
had unusual moves in Philippine trading. Stock symbols are in
parentheses and prices are as of the noon close in  Manila .  The Philippine Stock Exchange Index rose 1 percent to
4,319.51. The measure gained 1.1 percent this week, its sixth
consecutive weekly advance.  Aboitiz Equity Ventures Inc. (AEV)  , which has
investments in power plants and retailers, increased 0.5 percent
to 39.65 pesos, rebounding from a 6.1 percent drop yesterday,
helped by speculation the company will report higher first-
quarter earnings next week.  Aboitiz Power Corp. (AP)  , Aboitiz
Equity’s energy unit, climbed 1.8 percent to 31.55 pesos, the
sharpest gain since April 4.  “The stock’s sharp loss yesterday was overdone considering
Aboitiz Equity remains a good earnings play and its aggressive
expansion in the energy sector,” said Astro del Castillo,
managing director at First Grade Holdings Inc. in Manila.  Phoenix Petroleum Philippines Inc. (PNX)  , a retailer of
petroleum products, surged 6.6 percent to 14.50 pesos, a record
close. The stock gained 17 percent this week after the company
said on April 25 that first-quarter sales more than doubled from
a year earlier.  “The market is pricing in the high growth performance of
the company,” said Peter Lee, senior investment officer at
Manila-based IGC Securities Inc. President Dennis Uy was out of
the office and couldn’t be reached for comment, his assistant
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
