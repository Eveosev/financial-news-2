Russia ’s 30-stock Micex Index
headed for the lowest level in almost two weeks as oil fell from
a 31-month high on bets the global recovery will flag.  The Micex Index of 30 stocks declined by 0.7 percent to
1,738.17 by 10:59 a.m. in Moscow, taking its weekly loss to 3.1
percent. Oil producer OAO Tatneft slipped 1.1 percent, while OAO
Novatek, Russia’s second-largest natural gas producer, retreated
1.3 percent. The dollar-denominated RTS Index decreased 0.4
percent to 2,021.76.  Crude for June delivery fell as much as 50 cents to $112.36
a barrel in  New York  after data showed  South Korea ’s industrial
production and U.S. economic growth missed analysts’ forecasts.
Reports today may show U.S. spending cooled and businesses grew
at a slower pace in the world’s biggest crude-consuming nation.  Asian oil demand growth will slow in the second half of the
year as consumers “feel the pinch” of higher fuel prices,
JPMorgan Chase & Co. said.  OAO Rosneft, Russia’s largest oil producer, fell 1.1
percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
