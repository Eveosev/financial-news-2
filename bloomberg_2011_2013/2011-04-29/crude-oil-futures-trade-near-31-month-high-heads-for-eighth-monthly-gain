Oil rose, capping an unprecedented
eighth straight month of gains, as better-than-expected  consumer
spending  signaled fuel demand may climb.  Futures reached a 31-month high after purchases increased
in March as Americans spent more on food and fuel, according to
a Commerce Department report. Equities advanced and the dollar
weakened against other major currencies, boosting the appeal of
commodities as an alternative investment.  “We’re getting a little liftoff off of the economic
releases and also from the equities market,” said  Jim Ritterbusch , president of Ritterbusch & Associates, a Galena,
Illinois-based consulting company.  Crude for June delivery rose $1.07, or 1 percent, to
$113.93 a barrel, the highest settlement since Sept. 22, 2008,
on the  New York Mercantile Exchange . Futures gained 6.8 percent
in April and have advanced each month since August, the longest
streak of increases since trading began in 1983. Prices climbed
1.5 percent this week and 34 percent in the past year.  Brent for June settlement advanced 87 cents, or 0.7
percent, to $125.89 a barrel on  London ’s ICE Futures Europe
exchange.  Consumer spending in the U.S. rose 0.6 percent in March
after a revised 0.9 percent gain the prior month that was higher
than previously estimated, Commerce Department figures showed
today in  Washington . The increase compared with a 0.5 percent
median estimate of economists surveyed by Bloomberg News.  U.S. Demand  Oil demand in the U.S., the world’s biggest oil-consuming
country, is forecast to climb 1.1 percent this year to 19.4
million barrels a day, according to the latest forecast from the
 Energy Information Administration , the statistical arm of the
U.S. Energy Department.  The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries’ crude
output fell to a 22-month low in April as increases from  Saudi
Arabia  failed to make up for declines in Angola and Libya, a
Bloomberg News survey showed.  Production fell 92,000 barrels, or 0.3 percent, to an
average 28.43 million barrels a day, the lowest level since June
2009, according to the survey of  oil companies , producers and
analysts. Daily output by the 11 members with quotas, all except
 Iraq , decreased 117,000 barrels to 25.82 million, 975,000 above
their target.  Business activity in the U.S. grew less than forecast in
April, at a pace that’s consistent with steady growth in the
world’s largest economy. The Institute for Supply Management-
Chicago Inc.’s business barometer dropped to 67.6 from March’s
70.6 level. Figures greater than 50 signal expansion, and the
median forecast in a Bloomberg News survey of economists called
for a decline to 68.2.  Equities Rise  The  Dow Jones Industrial Average  climbed 48.52 points, or
0.4 percent, to 12,811.83 at 3:07 p.m. in  New York . The Standard
& Poor’s 500 Index rose 0.2 percent to 1,363.03.  The Dollar Index, which tracks the U.S. currency against
six major counterparts including the euro and the yen, had its
biggest monthly drop since September. The index slipped 0.3
percent to 72.92, the ninth straight daily decline.  Gold futures rose to a record for a third straight day on
bets that the dollar will extend its slump, and silver had the
biggest monthly gain in 28 years.  “The things we’ve got driving oil higher are the weak
dollar and the continued run-up in gold and silver,” said  Phil Flynn , vice president of research at PFGBest in  Chicago . Futures
are volatile today because of light volume and the expiration of
the May gasoline and heating oil contracts, he said.  Light Volume  Volume was reduced today because of a public holiday in the
U.K. Electronic trading of oil on the ICE wasn’t affected. The
U.K. and other countries from  Germany  to  China  will be closed
May 2 for May Day.  Oil volume in electronic trading on the Nymex was 322,374
contracts as of 3:09 p.m. in New York. Volume totaled 536,591
contracts yesterday, 29 percent below the average of the past
three months. Open interest was 1.6 million contracts, the
highest level since a record 1.62 million on March 11.  Gasoline futures rose for a seventh day amid speculation
that stockpiles will fall for an 11th consecutive week after a
 power outage  curtailed production from three Texas refineries.
Gasoline supplies dropped to the lowest level since 2009 in the
week ended April 22, according to the Energy Department.  Gasoline for May delivery on the Nymex jumped 3.5 cents, or
1 percent, to $3.4648 a gallon, the highest settlement since
July 14, 2008. The more active June contract increased 2.88
cents, or 0.9 percent, to $3.3984. The spread between the two
contracts was 6.64 cents, more than 3 cents wider than a week
ago.  Crude may rise next week as the dollar weakens after the
 Federal Reserve  said the “moderate” economic recovery still
requires record-low  interest rates , a Bloomberg survey showed.  Twenty-one of 35 analysts, or 60 percent, forecast oil will
increase through May 6. Nine respondents, or 26 percent,
predicted prices will decline and five projected little change.
Last week, 38 percent of respondents said futures would gain.  To contact the reporter on this story:
