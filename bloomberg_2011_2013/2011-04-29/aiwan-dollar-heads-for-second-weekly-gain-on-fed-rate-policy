Taiwan’s dollar completed a second
weekly gain on speculation the  Federal Reserve ’s decision to
keep its interest-rate target at a record low will boost demand
for higher-yielding assets.  The Fed left its benchmark interest rate in a range of zero
to 0.25 percent on April 27, and Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke 
retained a pledge to keep it “exceptionally low” for an
“extended period.” The government reported after the close of
 currency trading  that gross domestic product climbed 6.2 percent
in the first quarter from a year earlier, after a 6.9 percent
gain in the previous three months. The median estimate of
economists surveyed by Bloomberg was for a 5 percent rise.  “Foreign inflows were the main factor driving the
appreciation this week, especially after Bernanke made the
comments,” said Tarsicio Tong, a Taipei-based currency trader
at the Union Bank of  Taiwan .  Taiwan’s dollar strengthened 0.6 percent during the week to
NT$28.762 against its U.S. counterpart as of the 4 p.m. local
time close, according to Taipei Forex Inc. It was little changed
today and touched NT$28.600, the strongest level since October
1997. “The next level to test would be NT$28.50,” Tong said.
Breaking that level would mean another wave of rallies.”  Taiwan’s currency has appreciated 2.3 percent this month as
overseas investors bought $3.5 billion more local shares than
they sold, according to exchange data.  Government bonds  fell this week. The yield on the 1 percent
note due January 2016, the most-active government security,
climbed two basis points to 1.099 percent, according to Gretai
Securities Market. The rate rose one basis point, or 0.01
percentage point, today and this month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
