ITT Corp. (ITT) , which plans to split
itself into three companies, projected $500 million in breakup
costs and reported first-quarter profit that beat analystsâ€™
estimates.  The separation costs will be incurred before the breakup
that is planned to take place before the end of 2011,  White
Plains , New York-based ITT said today in a statement. First-
quarter profit was 98 cents per share, higher than the 93 cents
average estimate from a Bloomberg survey of 14 analysts.  ITT said in January it would split into water, industrial
and defense companies, isolating the effect of planned cuts in
U.S. military spending and allowing each of the businesses to
focus on core strengths. Profit and sales fell at the defense
division in the first quarter, offset by increases in the fluid
and control divisions, according to the statement.  The company today narrowed its full-year profit forecast
range to $4.70 to $4.82 a share, from $4.62 to $4.82. ITT
reduced the 2011 sales forecast to $11.3 billion from $11.4
billion, citing uncertainty in the defense market.  To contact the reporters on this story:
