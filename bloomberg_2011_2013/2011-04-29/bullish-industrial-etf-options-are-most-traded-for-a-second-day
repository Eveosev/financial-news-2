Bullish options on an exchange-
traded fund tracking industrial stocks were the most-active U.S.
contracts for a second day after a transaction tied to 10
million shares.  Almost all volume was concentrated in a purchase of the
 Industrial Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLI) ’s June $40 calls, according
to Trade Alert LLC, a New York-based provider of options-market
data and analytics. The fund tracking 59 stocks climbed 0.5
percent to $38.73, the highest intraday since June 2008, after
 Caterpillar Inc. (CAT)  profit topped analysts’ estimates.  To contact the reporter on this story:
