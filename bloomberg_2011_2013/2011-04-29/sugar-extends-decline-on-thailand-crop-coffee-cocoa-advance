Sugar capped the longest slump in
almost a year on signs that output will surge in  Thailand , the
world’s second-biggest exporter. Coffee and cocoa advanced.  Thailand’s Office of the Cane & Sugar Board said this week
that production will reach a record after rain boosted yields
and the rally in the second half of 2010 spurred farmers to
plant more. Today, the price touched a seven-month low.  Brazil 
is the leading shipper.  “Prices are under pressure as the supply situation is
easing,” said Bruno Zaneti, a risk-management consultant at
FCStone Group in Campinas, Brazil.  Raw sugar for July delivery declined 0.26 cent, or 1.2
percent, to settle at 22.25 cents a pound on ICE Futures U.S. in
 New York , the fifth straight decline and the longest slide since
May. Earlier, the price touched 21.75 cents, the lowest since
Sept. 13.  This month, the commodity retreated 18 percent, a third
straight drop and the biggest since March 2010. In 2011, the
