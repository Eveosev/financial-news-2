Natural gas futures may advance as
a stockpile deficit signals reduced supplies of the power-plant
fuel, a Bloomberg News survey showed.  Nine of 19 analysts, or 47 percent, forecast that gas
futures will rise on the  New York Mercantile Exchange  through
May 6. Five, or 26 percent, said futures will fall and five
predicted that prices will stay the same. Last week, 64 percent
of participants said  gas prices  would decline.  The Energy Department reported yesterday that gas
inventories for the week ended April 22 totaled 1.685 trillion
cubic feet, 0.6 percent below the five-year average. The
stockpile deficit was the first since the week ended Feb. 25.  “The storage deficit is rapidly growing, and it’s going to
widen,” said Peter Linder, investment manager of DeltaOne
Capital Partners in Calgary. “We’ve seen some slowdown in gas
drilling activity. I think prices will go to $4.60 or $4.80 in
the near term.”  Natural gas for June delivery gained 10.5 cents, or 2.4
percent, to $4.571 per million British thermal units in the
first four days of trading this week on the New York exchange.  Gas inventories were 11 percent below levels a year
earlier, the widest year-on-year deficit since Aug. 8, 2008,
yesterday’s report showed.  The number of rigs drilling for gas in the U.S. fell by
seven to 878 last week, the third consecutive decline, according
to data published by Baker Hughes Inc. The rig count is down 4.5
percent this year.  The gas survey has correctly forecast the direction of
prices 48 percent of the time since its June 2004 introduction.  Bloomberg’s survey of natural-gas analysts and traders asks
for an assessment of whether Nymex natural-gas futures will
probably rise, fall or remain neutral in the coming week. This
week’s results were:  RISE   FALL   NEUTRAL  9      5        5  To contact the reporter on this story:
