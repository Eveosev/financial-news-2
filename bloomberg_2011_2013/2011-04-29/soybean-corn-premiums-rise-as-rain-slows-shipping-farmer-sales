Cash premiums for soybeans and corn
shipped in May to terminals near  New Orleans  rose relative to
Chicago futures as shipping delays and reduced farmer sales
tightened supplies.  The spot-basis bid, or premium, for soybeans delivered next
month was at 64 cents to 70 cents a bushel above May futures, up
from 60 cents to 70 cents yesterday, U.S. Department of
Agriculture  data  show. Corn basis bids rose to 55 cents to 61
cents a bushel above May futures, compared with 54 cents to 57
cents yesterday.  “More than 40 percent of the river shipping has been
halted by flooding this week,” said  Dave Marshall , a farm
marketing adviser for Toay Commodity Futures Group LLC in
Nashville,  Illinois . “Farmers and major exporters have a reason
to retain ownership of corn and soybean supplies” with rains
delaying the start of the U.S. planting season, he said.  Soybean futures for May delivery surged 42.5 cents, or 3.1
percent, to close at $13.9275 a bushel on the Chicago Board of
Trade, the biggest gain for the contract since March 17.  Corn futures for May delivery rose 31 cents, or 4.3
percent, to close at $7.54 a bushel on the CBOT.  Corn inventories in the U.S., the world’s largest producer,
will fall to a 15-year low on Aug. 31, the USDA said on April 8.
Soybean reserves as a percentage of consumption will drop to the
lowest since 1965 before this year’s harvest, the government
said.  Major flooding is  reported  at 63 locations, down from 66
yesterday, data from the National Weather Service show. A  record 
crest on the  Ohio River  near Cairo, Illinois, is expected on May
1, according to the  agency .  “For a world that needs a big crop this year to rebuild
inventories, it’s not off to a very good start,” Marshall said.
“Everyone knows supplies are going to be very tight before this
year’s harvest.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
