The total value of investments in
Rwanda declined 30 percent in the first quarter, the Rwanda
Development Board said.  Investments declined to 52 billion Rwandan francs ($86.6
million) in the three months through March, from 75 billion
francs a year earlier, John Gara, the chief executive officer of
the Kigali-based board, told reporters yesterday in the city.
The number of projects more than doubled to 30, he said.  The total doesn’t include a $65 million pharmaceutical-
manufacturing facility planned by CSM GlobalPharma, a
partnership between  India ’s Cadila Pharmaceuticals Ltd. and the
U.S.-based Holtzman Group, Gara said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
