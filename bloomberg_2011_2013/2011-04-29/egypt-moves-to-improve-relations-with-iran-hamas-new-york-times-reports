Egypt  has moved to improve
relations with  Iran  and Hamas as part of a political shift
toward a more independent regional policy that more closely
reflects public opinion, the New York Times reported, citing
Ambassador Menha Bakhoum, spokeswoman for the Foreign Ministry.  The shift in policy likely will allow Iran improved access
to a previously hostile nation, the Times said. It has also
triggered concern in Israel that it may allow Hamas to bolster
its arms, the newspaper said, citing an unidentified Israeli
official.  Click here for web link  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
