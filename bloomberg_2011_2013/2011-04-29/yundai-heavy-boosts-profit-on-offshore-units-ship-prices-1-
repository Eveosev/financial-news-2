Hyundai Heavy Industries Co., the
world’s largest shipyard, increased first-quarter profit 21
percent as it built more offshore-units and worked through ship
orders won at higher prices.  Net income rose to 903 billion won ($845 million) from a
restated 745.3 billion won a year earlier, the Ulsan, South
Korea-based company said today in regulatory filing based on
parent figures. Sales rose 17 percent to 6.31 trillion won.  The shipyard has already achieved 78 percent of its target
for vessel and offshore orders this year as rising oil prices
and rebounding trade spur demand. The company’s on-going work
includes $2.06 billion of liquefied-natural-gas facilities to be
used by  Chevron Corp. (CVX)  off  Australia  and construction of
container vessels for A.P. Moller-Maersk A/S.  “Things are looking good,” said Cho In Karp, head of
research at Heungkuk Securities Co. in  Seoul . “Almost of all
divisions at Hyundai Heavy seem to have reported better
results.”  Operating profit, or sales minus the cost of goods sold and
administrative expenses, rose 11 percent to 991.8 billion won in
the first quarter. Margin to sales fell to 16 percent from 17
percent a year earlier.  The shipyard dropped 0.4 percent to 535,000 won at the 3
p.m. close in Seoul trading. The stock has advanced 21 percent
this year, compared with a 6.9 percent climb for  South Korea ’s
Kospi index.  Consolidated Earnings  The company will release consolidated figures, which
includes earnings at affiliates, at a later date. South Korean
companies have moved to using the Korean International Financial
Reporting Standards from the nation’s system of generally
accepted accounting principles.  Shipyards’ earnings growth may slow from the third quarter
as steelmakers raise prices for steel plate, said Lee Jae Won,
an analyst at Tong Yang Securities Inc. in Seoul.  Posco (005490) , South
Korea’s biggest supplier of steel plate, increased the price of
heavy plate by 160,000 won per metric tons last week.  Hyundai Heavy said in December that it expects overall
orders to jump 54 percent this year to $26.6 billion. That
includes $12.3 billion of contracts for ships and offshore
units. The company also makes marine engines, construction
equipment and power generators.  Full-year sales, which reflect completed work, may rise 20
percent to a record 26.9 trillion won, the shipyard said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
