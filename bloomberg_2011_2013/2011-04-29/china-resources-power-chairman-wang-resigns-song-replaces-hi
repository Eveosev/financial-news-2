China Resources  Power Holdings Co.,

a new position in another state-owned enterprise,” the company
said in a filing to the Hong Kong stock exchange. He is replaced
by 47-year-old Song Lin, according to the statement.  “Wang Shuai Ting has confirmed that he has no disagreement
with the board,” according to the statement. “There are no
other matters that need to be brought to the attention of the
shareholders of the company in relation to his resignation.”  Song was executive director of China Resources from
September 2001 and became chairman in August 2003, before
resigning from both posts in July, according to the statement.
He joined the company in 1985.  To contact the reporter on this story:
