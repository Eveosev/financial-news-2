What follows are opening calls for
U.S. grain and oilseed markets.  -- Corn futures are called to open 3 cents to 7 cents a bushel
higher on the  Chicago  Board of Trade on signs that wet, cold
weather next week may extend planting delays in the southern and
eastern U.S., reducing yield potential, said Chad Henderson, a
market analyst for Prime Agricultural Consultants Inc. in
Brookfield,  Wisconsin .  -- Wheat futures may open steady to up 1 cent a bushel on the
CBOT, the Kansas City Board of Trade and the  Minneapolis Grain
Exchange  on speculation that next weekâ€™s Wheat Quality Council
tour will find smaller crops in Kansas, the biggest U.S.
producer of winter grain, Henderson said.  -- Soybean futures may open 4 cents to 6 cents a bushel higher
in Chicago on speculation that declines in the previous three
sessions will increase demand for cooking oils and  animal feed 
made from the oilseed, Henderson said. Soybean-oil futures are
expected to open 0.4 cent to 0.5 cent a pound higher, and
soybean-meal futures may open up $2 to $3 for 2,000 pounds of
the animal feed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
