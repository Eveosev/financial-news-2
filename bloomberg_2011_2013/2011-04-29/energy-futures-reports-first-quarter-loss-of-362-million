Energy Future Holdings Corp., the
 Texas  power company that was taken private in 2007 in the
largest buyout in history, reported a quarterly loss of $362
million.  The first-quarter loss of $362 million compares with a $355
million profit for the same period a year earlier, the closely
held company said in a filing with the U.S. Securities and
Exchange Commission made public today.  Energy Future, based in  Dallas , reached an agreement with
its lenders this month to extend due dates on about $17.8
billion of loans. One of the company’s lenders, Aurelius Capital
Management LP, had alleged certain intercompany loans violated
Energy Future’s debt agreements.  Energy Future has rejected that as “utterly meritless”
and lenders agreed that the loans did not violate the company’s
credit agreements. As of Dec. 31, the company had $39.6 billion
of long-term debt, according to a regulatory  filing .  Energy Future, formerly known as TXU Corp., was sold to a
group led by KKR & Co. LP and TPG Capital in 2007, in a $43.2
billion transaction.  Energy Future’s units include Oncor, a regulated power-line
business; TXU Energy, a retail electricity seller with more than
2 million customers; and Luminant, which owns more than 15,400
megawatts of generation capacity in Texas.  To contact the reporter on this story:
