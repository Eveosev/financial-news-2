Cia. de Minas Buenaventura SA ,
Peru’s biggest precious-metals producer, seeks to increase
output by 15 percent next year at the Yanacocha gold mine, Chief
Financial Officer Carlos Galvez said.  Buenaventura aims to produce 1.5 million ounces in 2012
from 1.3 million ounces this year, Galvez said today on a
conference call. The company is also exploring new areas at its
Uchucchacua silver mine as rising prices have made additional
exploration work feasible, he said.  “The company has reviewed the mining plan and is
considering getting back to 1.5 million ounces by 2012,” Galvez
said. “There will be a ramp up in production at Yanacocha at
mid-year.”  Buenaventura, which last year saw its gold and silver
production fall 16 percent and 2 percent, respectively, is
seeking to boost output as precious metals prices rose to
records this week. The company also plans to finish a $32.5
million expansion of its La Zanja gold mine in the third quarter
of 2012, Chief Executive Officer Roque Benavides said.  Buenaventura has a 44 percent stake in Yanacocha and
 Newmont Mining Corp. (NEM)  owns 56 percent.  Buenaventura’s American depositary receipts, each
representing one ordinary share, added $1.78, or 4.5 percent, to
$41.70 at 1:25 p.m. in  New York  Stock Exchange composite  trading 
after announcing late yesterday first-quarter profit increased
40 percent to $218.3 million.  Gold futures on the Comex in New York earlier today touched
a record $1,545.90 an ounce. Silver, which touched a 31-year
high of $49.845 on April 23, has climbed 28 percent in April and
is poised for the biggest gain since January 1983.  To contact the reporter on this story:
