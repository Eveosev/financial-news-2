Prime Minister  Vladimir Putin 
dismissed Anatoly Perminov as head of the Russian space agency,
which suffered the loss of satellites last year, because of the
age limit for state officials.  Putin signed the order yesterday, according to a statement
posted on the government’s website. First Deputy Defense
Minister Vladimir Popovkin was named Perminov’s successor,
according to a separate statement.  Russian law sets an age limit of 60 for officials, which
the president and prime minister have the right to waive.
 Perminov , 65, had no plans to retire or resign early, Alexander
Vorobyov, his spokesman, said earlier this month.  Russia’s space industry suffered a blow last year when a
Proton-M rocket failed to deliver three navigation satellites
into orbit for Glonass, a rival to the U.S. Global Positioning
System. President  Dmitry Medvedev  fired Viktor Remishevsky, the
deputy head of the Russian space agency, or Roscosmos, and
Vyacheslav Filin, the deputy chief of rocket maker RKK Energia,
over the loss of the satellites.  To contact the reporter on this story:
