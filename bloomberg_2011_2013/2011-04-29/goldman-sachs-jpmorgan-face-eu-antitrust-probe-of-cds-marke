Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) , JPMorgan
& Co. and other investment banks face a European Union antitrust
probe into credit-default swaps for companies and sovereign
debt, regulators said.  The European Commission said it opened two antitrust
investigations into the CDS market. It will check whether 16
bank dealers colluded by giving market information to Markit, a
financial information provider, the commission said today in a
statement.  The regulator also will examine whether nine of those
dealers struck deals with ICE Clear  Europe , a clearing house for
derivatives, that block other clearing houses from entering the
market and give CDS players “no real choice where to clear
their transactions,” the commission said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
