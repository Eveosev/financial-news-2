Hong Kong  stocks fell for a fourth
day as concern over slowing U.S. economic growth overshadowed
better-than-estimated results from Chinese banks.  Hui Xian Real Estate Investment Trust, the city’s first
stock sale denominated in yuan, lost 9.4 percent in its trading
debut.  Esprit Holdings Ltd. (330) , Asia’s third-largest clothier by
market value, slumped 3.3 percent.  Bank of China Ltd. (3988)  and
Industrial & Commercial Bank of  China  Ltd. dropped even after
reporting quarterly profit that beat estimates.  “In the developed world, growth is still weak and you
don’t have the ability to raise  interest rates ,” said Terrace
Chum, Hong Kong-based managing director of greater China
equities for Manulife Asset Management, which oversees $210
billion. “Inflation concerns are still on the horizon.”  The  Hang Seng Index (HSI)  fell 0.4 percent to 23,720.81 at the
close. The benchmark measure of Hong Kong stocks fell 1.7
percent this week, the most since March. The index is up 0.8
percent in April. The Hang Seng China Enterprises Index of
Chinese companies’ H-shares fell 0.8 percent to 13,208.71.  The  U.S. economy , the world’s largest, grew at a slower
pace than forecast in the first quarter as  government spending 
declined by the most since 1983. Gross domestic product slowed
to a 1.8 percent annual rate last quarter after a 3.1 percent
pace in the final three months of 2010, the Commerce Department
said yesterday in Washington. Economists had projected 2 percent
growth, the median estimate from a Bloomberg News survey.  Esprit Slumps  Esprit slumped 3.3 percent to HK$32.30 for the biggest
decline in the  Hang Seng . The company said yesterday nine-month
turnover dropped 3.1 percent to HK$25.9 billion in the period
ending March 31. The decline was driven mostly by sluggish
demand, analysts at Credit Suisse Group AG wrote in a report.  Hui Xian fell 9.4 percent to HK$4.75. The trust owned by
Hong Kong billionaire Li Ka-shing raised 10.5 billion yuan ($1.6
billion) selling units at 5.24 yuan each, according to a
statement to the Hong Kong stock exchange yesterday.  The Hang Seng has advanced 3 percent this year. Shares in
the gauge traded at an average 12.6 times forecast earnings
yesterday, compared with 14.4 times at the end of last year,
data compiled by Bloomberg shows.  Futures on the Hang Seng Index slipped 0.5 percent to
23,485. The HSI Volatility Index, the benchmark gauge for Hong
Kong stock options, retreated 5.4 percent to 17.16, indicating
options traders expect a swing of 4.9 percent in the Hang Seng
in the next 30 days.  Banks Slip  Bank of China lost 1.2 percent to HK$4.29. The nation’s
third-largest lender by market value said first-quarter net
income rose 28 percent to 33.4 billion yuan ($5.14 billion) from
a year earlier. The result compares with the median 31.7 billion
yuan estimate of eight analysts in a Bloomberg survey.  Industrial & Commercial Bank of China (601398)  slipped 0.2 percent
to HK$6.57. The world’s most profitable lender said net income
climbed to 53.8 billion yuan, exceeding the median 51.1 billion
yuan estimate of analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  Banking stocks trading in Shanghai dropped on concern net
interest margin growth will slow in the second quarter as banks
come under pressure to raise rates on savings accounts to lure
depositors, according to Orient Securities Co. A gauge of
financial companies in the CSI 300 slid 0.5 percent, the only
decline among the 10 industries.  To contact the reporter on this story:
