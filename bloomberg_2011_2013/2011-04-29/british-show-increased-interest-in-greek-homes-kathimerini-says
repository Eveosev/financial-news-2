Internet searches by British
citizens interested in buying summer homes in  Greece  have
increased by 6 percent during the past month,  Kathimerini 
reported, citing research from  Rightmove , a real-estate website.  Interest has been boosted by lower prices resulting from
Greeceâ€™s economic crisis, the newspaper said. Last year, prices
of holiday homes fell 20 percent and those of luxury homes an
estimated 45 percent, Kathimerini said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
