Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA)  plans to shut
a crude unit, a coker, hydrotreaters and a catalytic reformer at
its Puget Sound refinery in Washington starting in late
September, according to a person with knowledge of the plans.  The work is scheduled to last about 40 days, said the
person, who declined to be identified because the information
isn’t public.  Jody Barnett, a spokeswoman for the refinery, didn’t
immediately respond to an e-mail.  The 147,500 barrels a day refinery imported 54,000 barrels
a day of crude from Canada in January, according to the Energy
Department.  To contact the reporter on this story:
