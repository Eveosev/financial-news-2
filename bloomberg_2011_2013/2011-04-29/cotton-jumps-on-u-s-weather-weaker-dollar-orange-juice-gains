(Corrects to show monthly drop in April was the largest
since October 2008 in fourth paragraph of story published April
29.)  Cotton jumped by the exchange limit
on renewed concern that dry weather in U.S., the world’s biggest
exporter, may crimp output and as a weaker dollar boosted demand
for commodities.  Orange juice  also gained.  The heat and dryness in the southern U.S. may “hurt”
cotton plants, said David Streit, a senior lead forecaster for
Commodity Weather Group LLC. Futures in New York slumped as much
as 33 percent from a record $2.197 a pound on March 7 as the
doubling of cotton prices slowed purchases by  China , the largest
user.  “Today, it seemed that cotton has bottomed out, as next
year’s U.S. output may be at a risk because of weather
problems,” said  Mike Stevens , an independent trader in
Mandeville,  Louisiana . “Also, the weaker dollar is providing a
good support to commodities.”  Cotton for July delivery on ICE Futures U.S. jumped by the
exchange limit of 6 cents, or 4 percent, to settle at $1.5802 a
pound at 2:44 p.m. in  New York . For the month, prices slumped 21
percent, the biggest slide since October 2008.  The U.S. Dollar Index was poised for its biggest monthly
decrease since September. A weaker dollar makes raw materials
priced in the U.S. currency more attractive to overseas buyers.
The index was headed for a fifth straight weekly drop.  Orange-juice futures for July delivery gained 2.5 cents, or
1.5 percent, to $1.687 a pound on ICE. The price climbed 3.6
percent this month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
