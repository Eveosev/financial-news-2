PBF Energy Co. LLC has restarted a
fluid catalytic cracker and alkylation unit after maintenance at
its refinery in Paulsboro,  New Jersey , according to a person
familiar with operations at the plant.  The units were shut for work in March, said the person who
declined to be identified because he isn’t authorized to speak
for the company.  The plant can process 185,000 barrels of crude a day,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Michael Gayda, president of PBF, didn’t immediately respond
to a telephone message seeking comment.  PBF, which was formed in 2008 to acquire U.S. refineries,
agreed in September to purchase Valero’s Paulsboro unit for
about $360 million and an estimated $275 million for crude
inventories and other expenses.  To contact the reporter on this story:
