BHP Billiton Ltd., the world’s
largest mining company, and partner  Vale SA (VALE5)  agreed to invest as
much as $3.5 billion to expand the Samarco  iron ore  plant in
 Brazil  as demand for the steelmaking raw material increases.  The two companies will increase iron ore pellet production
capacity at the venture by 8.3 million tons to 30.5 million
tons, according to a statement today from the Melbourne-based
company. Both companies have an equal share in the project,
which is scheduled for start-up in 2014, the companies said.  Iron ore prices are surging as the global economic recovery
prompts steelmakers to boost production.  China , the world’s
largest buyer of iron ore, said imports jumped 22 percent in
March from the previous month on expectations of price rises.
Imports reached a record 68.97 million tons in January.  The project also includes the expansion of the Ponta Ubu
maritime terminal in Espirito Santos state, mining and
processing capacity at the Germano mine in Minas Gerais state
and the construction of a 396 kilometer-pipeline linking the
mining to the plant, the filing said.  BHP said the cost will be $3.5 billion, with its share at
$1.75 billion, while Rio de Janeiro-based Vale said the project
will cost $3 billion. The companies didn´t explain the reason
for the difference in cost estimate.  To contact the reporter on this story:
