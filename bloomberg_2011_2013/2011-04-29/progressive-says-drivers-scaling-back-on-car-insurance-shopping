Progressive Corp. (PGR) , the fourth-
largest U.S. auto insurer, said sales growth is being pressured
as drivers become more likely to stick with their carriers.  “There appears to be a general decline in consumer
interest in shopping for auto insurance, from which we are not
immune,” said Chief Executive Officer Glenn Renwick, in
prepared remarks today for the Mayfield Village, Ohio-based
company’s annual meeting. The trend is noticeable in
measurements of  Internet traffic  to insurance sites, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
