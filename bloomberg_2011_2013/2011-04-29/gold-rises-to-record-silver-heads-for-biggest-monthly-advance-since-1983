Gold approached $1,570 an ounce,
extending a rally to a record, on bets that the dollar will
extend a slump, enhancing the allure of the metal as a store of
value. Silver posted for the biggest monthly gain in 28 years.  The greenback headed for the fifth consecutive monthly
decline against a basket of six major currencies. The  Federal
Reserve  signaled this week that borrowing costs will remain at a
record low for an extended period. Gold capped the biggest
monthly gain since November 2009.  “The dollar will continue to lose ground for the
foreseeable future, so it only makes sense to be invested in
precious metals,” said  Matthew Zeman , a strategist at Kingsview
Financial in  Chicago .  Gold futures for June delivery rose $25.20, or 1.6 percent,
to settle at $1,556.40 at 1:42 p.m. on the Comex in New York,
the biggest gain since Jan. 28. After the settlement, the metal
reached a record $1,569.80. The price surged 8.1 percent in
April and advanced 3.5 percent this week, the most since
February 2010.  Gold for immediate delivery climbed as much as 2.2 percent
to an all-time high of $1,569.32.  Assets in the SPDR Gold Trust, the biggest exchange-traded
fund backed by gold, have expanded 1.5 percent this month,
heading for the biggest gain since August.  “The sinking dollar is driving people to the gold
market,” said Lim Han Jo, a Seoul-based trader at Tongyang
Futures Co.  The Fed has kept its benchmark lending rate at zero percent
to 0.25 percent since December 2008 to stimulate the economy.  ‘Free Money’  “The free-money party is going to continue, and that’s
going to drive gold higher,” Zeman of Kingsview said.  Silver futures for July delivery rose $1.058, or 2.2
percent, to $48.599 an ounce. This month, the metal gained 28
percent, the most since January 1983.  The minimum  amount  of cash that traders must deposit for
speculative positions in silver futures will rise 13 percent to
$14,513 per contract after the close of business today, CME
Group Inc., the Comex parent, said yesterday. Margins were
$4,250 a year ago.  “Silver’s run is related to the rise in gold,” said
 Michael Cuggino , who helps manage about $12 billion at Permanent
Portfolio Funds in  San Francisco . “There’s a lot of speculation
in silver. Anytime you’ve had a run like silver, you’re going to
get a correction.”  Gold has climbed 33 percent in the past year, and silver
has more than doubled.  Palladium futures for June delivery rose $16.85, or 2.2
percent, to $792.15 an ounce on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange . The price has climbed 44 percent in the past year.  Platinum futures for July delivery climbed $25.60, or 1.4
percent, to $1,865.50 an ounce. The metal has gained 7.6 percent
in the past 12 months.  In April, palladium rose 3.2 percent and platinum gained
4.6 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
