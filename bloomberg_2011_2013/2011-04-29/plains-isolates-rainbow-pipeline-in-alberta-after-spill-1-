Plains Midstream Canada LP
depressurized and isolated a pipeline after it leaked 1,000
cubic meters of low-sulfur crude oil about 90 kilometers (56
miles) north of Peace River, Alberta, Jessica Potter, a
spokeswoman for Alberta Environment, said in a telephone
interview.  The spill was on the Rainbow pipeline, said Davis
Sheremata, a spokesman with the Alberta Energy Resources
Conservation Board.  Roy Lamoreaux, a spokesman for  Plains All American Pipeline
LP (PAA) , didnâ€™t immediately respond to a telephone message and e-mail
seeking additional information. Plains Midstream Canada is an
indirect subsidiary of Plains All American.  To contact the reporter on this story:
