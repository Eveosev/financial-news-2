FIFA president Sepp Blatter said
the 24 executives of soccer’s ruling body shouldn’t have the
power to pick  World Cup  hosts on their own after a voting
scandal marred their last decision.  Blatter said he’d like FIFA to follow the International
Olympic Committee, which allocates a vote to all its members in
choosing Games hosts, according to a preview of an interview
with Frankfurter Allgemeine newspaper to be published tomorrow.
Zurich-based FIFA has 208 members.  Blatter is seeking his fourth four-year term, and being
challenged by Qatar’s Mohamed Bin Hammam in the June 1 vote.  Two FIFA executives were suspended before December’s
decision to pick the 2018 and 2022 World Cup hosts after
undercover reporters for the Sunday Times newspaper recorded
them saying votes could be bought.  Russia was selected to host the 2018 World Cup and Qatar
was picked to stage the 2022 tournament.  Bin Hammam, who’s sat on FIFA’s executive since 1996, says
it’s time for “new blood” to head the organization that has
generated $3.7 billion in long-term television and sponsorship
rights from the 2014 World Cup in  Brazil .  To contact the reporters on this story:
