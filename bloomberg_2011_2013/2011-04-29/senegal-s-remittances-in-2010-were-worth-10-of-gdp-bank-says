Senegal  received 600 billion  CFA
francs  ($1.4 billion) last year in remittances from citizens
living outside the West African nation, the regional central
bank said.  The amount accounts for about 10 percent of Senegal’s gross
domestic product, the Dakar-based Central Bank of West African
States said in an e-mailed statement today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
