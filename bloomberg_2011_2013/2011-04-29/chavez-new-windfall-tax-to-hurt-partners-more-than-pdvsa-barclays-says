Venezuela ’s new windfall oil tax
will hurt partners of Petroleos de Venezuela SA more than the
state company itself,  Barclays Capital  said in a report.  Venezuela, South America’s largest OPEC producer, taxes oil
companies more than any other country in the world and it
recovered about 50 percent of the revenue from each barrel of
oil sold over the past five years. On average, more than 90
percent of the gross profit of the oil industry is transferred
to the state, according to the e-mailed Barclays report today.  “In the case of the joint ventures there could be some
additional fiscal pressure,” Barclays analysts led by
Alejandro Grisanti said in the report. “They do have to assume
part of the burden of the tax, lowering profits, which does not
help create incentive for investment.”  Venezuelan President  Hugo Chavez  on April 21 said the
increased windfall tax will get as much as 95 percent of
marginal revenue when oil surpasses $100 a barrel. Venezuela’s
government has been pressuring partners to increase production.  Oil for June delivery rose 31 cents to $113.17 a barrel at
10:32 a.m. on the  New York Mercantile Exchange . Futures are up 6
percent in April and have advanced every month since September.  To contact the reporter on this story:
