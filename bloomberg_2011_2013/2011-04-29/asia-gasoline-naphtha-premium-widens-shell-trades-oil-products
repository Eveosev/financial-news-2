Asia gasoline rose by the most in
nine weeks. The oil product’s premium to naphtha widened as
demand for car fuel rose. Royal Dutch Shell Plc paid a smaller
premium for fuel oil in Singapore, the region’s biggest oil-
trading center.  Light Distillates  Benchmark 92-RON gasoline gained 5.3 percent this week, the
most since Feb. 25, to $136.15 a barrel, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. Prices have climbed 13 percent this
month.  Open-specification naphtha for delivery to  Japan  gained 1.5
percent this week to $1,092.50 a metric ton, Bloomberg data
showed. Prices have gained for a 10th month, the longest rising
streak since Bloomberg began tracking the data in September
1991. The premium of Japan-delivered naphtha to Brent, or the
crack spread, rose this week to $150.07 a ton from $142.16 at
the end of Asian trading April 21.  Gasoline’s premium to naphtha jumped 44 percent this week,
the most since Jan. 7, to $16.80 a barrel. A wider reforming
margin signals that the profit from making gasoline over naphtha
is increasing.  In Singapore, Shell sold 25,000 tons of naphtha for first-
half July delivery to Koch Industries Inc. at $1,089.50 a ton,
traders said. Glencore International AG sold 25,000 tons of
second-half June naphtha to Cargill Inc. at $1,096 a ton.  Total SA sold 50,000 barrels of 97-RON gasoline for loading
May 14 to May 18 to Shell at $141 a barrel. Total sold a second
similar 97-RON cargo to Shell at $141.60 a barrel.  Fuel Oil   Benchmark 180-centistoke fuel oil climbed $26.50, or 4
percent, in April to $683.25 a ton, according to Bloomberg data.
The price of 380-centistoke fuel oil, mainly used as marine
fuel, rose $24.50, or 3.8 percent, from last month to $672. Each
variety gained for an eighth month, the longest rally in records
going back to 1991.  Fuel oil’s discount to Dubai crude widened for a fourth day
to $12.72 a barrel, based on Bloomberg data. This shows refiners
are making the biggest losses from turning oil into residual
products since Nov. 27, 2008.  The premium of 180-centistoke fuel oil to 380-centistoke
grade, or the viscosity spread, rebounded 50 cents to $11.25 a
ton, Bloomberg data showed. This ended a three-day losing
streak.  In  Singapore , Shell bought 20,000 tons of 380-centistoke
fuel oil from Vitol Group at $2.75 a ton over benchmark quotes,
traders said. Shell paid a $4 premium on April 25 and April 26.  Middle Distillates  Gasoil, or diesel, with 0.5 percent sulfur rose $6.30, or
4.8 percent, in April to $138.60 a barrel, according to
Bloomberg data. Jet fuel climbed $7, or 5.3 percent, from last
month to $140.35. Each product increased for an eighth month,
the longest rising streak in records going back to 1991.  In Singapore, Hin Leong Trading Pte bought 150,000 barrels
of 0.5 percent sulfur gasoil from Shell at parity to benchmark
quotes, traders said. That’s down from a premium of 10 cents in
yesterday’s transactions.  Gasoil’s premium to Asian benchmark Dubai crude dropped 31
cents to $19.48 a barrel at 6:08 p.m. Singapore time, based on
data from PVM Oil Associates, a broker. This crack spread, a
measure of refining profit, lost 14 percent in April, the first
monthly decline this year.  Jet fuel’s premium to gasoil gained 10 cents to $1.55 a
barrel, the highest in eight weeks, PVM said. This regrade
widened 72 percent in April, indicating it’s more profitable to
produce  aviation fuel  over diesel.  BP Plc bought its eighth jet-fuel cargo in Singapore this
week, again paying 20 cents a barrel over benchmark quotes,
traders said. Shell was the seller.  To contact the reporters on this story:
