The Vietnamese dong completed its
best week since at least 1997 after the central bank set a cap
on dollar deposit rates, spurring companies and individuals to
shift more money into local currency.  Government bonds  fell.  The  State Bank  of  Vietnam  set a ceiling on dollar deposit
rates on April 13, restricting interest payments for individuals
to 3 percent and those for non-credit institutions to 1 percent.
Holdings of dong can attract returns of as much as 14 percent.  Some small banks have been collecting as much as $15
million daily from customers wanting local currency, the
government said in a  statement  on its website on April 27. The
dong market has “gradually stabilized,” the government in a
separate  statement  today.  The currency gained 1.8 percent this week to 20,550 as of 5
p.m. in Hanoi, according to prices from banks compiled by
Bloomberg. That is the biggest weekly gain since at least March
1997. The currency was little changed today.  The central bank fixed the  reference rate  at 20,698 today,
compared with 20,718 on April 22, according to its website. The
currency is allowed to trade up to 1 percent on either side of
that rate.  Government bonds slid this week, with the yield on the
benchmark five-year bonds advancing 15 basis points to 12.47
percent, according to a daily fixing price from banks compiled
by Bloomberg. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  To contact the Bloomberg News staff on this story:
