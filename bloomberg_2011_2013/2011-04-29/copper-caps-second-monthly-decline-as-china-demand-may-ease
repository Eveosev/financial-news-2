Copper fell in  New York , capping
the second straight monthly drop, on mounting concern that
demand will slow in  China , the world’s largest metals user.  China’s central bank has raised lenders’ reserve
requirements 10 times since the start of 2010 and boosted
 interest rates  four times since October to rein in accelerating
consumer prices and slow growth. Borrowing costs may increase
again by May 2, Dong Tao, an analyst at Credit Suisse Group AG,
said in a report yesterday. Copper dropped 3 percent this month
after losing 4.2 percent in March.  “China is slowing down,” said Phil Streible, a senior
strategist at broker Lind-Waldock in  Chicago . “There’s very
little demand at the moment. Copper will be drifting lower
slowly.”  Copper futures for July delivery fell 8.25 cents, or 1.9
percent, to close at $4.179 a pound at 1:13 p.m. on the Comex in
New York. The metal was down 5.4 percent for the week, the
biggest such drop since mid-March.  Prices extended declines after a private report showed U.S.
business activity fell more than forecast this month.  The metal has dropped 10 percent since reaching a record
$4.6575 on Feb. 15 as the  U.S. economy  grew at a slower pace in
the first quarter and Japan was rattled by a deadly earthquake.  The London Metal Exchange is closed today and May 2.  To contact the reporter on this story:
