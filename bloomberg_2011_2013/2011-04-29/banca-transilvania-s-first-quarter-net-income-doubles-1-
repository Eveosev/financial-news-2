Banca Transilvania SA,  Romania ’s
second-largest publicly traded bank, said first-quarter profit
almost doubled as the bank focused on boosting market share and
profitability.  Net income rose to 31.8 million lei ($12 million) from 16
million lei a year earlier, the Cluj-Napoca, Romania-based bank
said in a preliminary earnings statement sent to the  Bucharest
Stock Exchange  today. Operating income before provisioning
declined 7 percent to 202 million lei from 216 million lei.  Romania’s economy is poised to recover from a two-year
recession and grow 1.5 percent in 2011, according to the
 International Monetary Fund . Government workers recovered part
of a 25 percent pay cut last year and the  unemployment rate  fell
to 5.9 percent at the end of March.  “The first-quarter results are promising,”  Banca
Transilvania (TLV) ’s Chief Executive Officer Robert C. Rekkers said in
the statement. “We will continue to focus on our profitability
and market share increase.”  The bank set aside 161 million lei for bad loans, 16
percent less than a year earlier. Bad loans amounted to 7.8
percent of lending. Net assets rose to 22 billion lei from 21.6
billion a year earlier, the bank said.  Gross profit should grow 33 percent this year to 180
million lei as net provisions decline 10 percent from 2010 to
575 million lei, the bank said in a separate statement today
after a general shareholders meeting. The bank plans to add 296
million lei from previous years’ reserves to its capital.  To contact the reporter on this story:
