Van Gansewinkel Group got more time
from its lenders to repay most of its 1.5 billion euros ($2.2
billion) of debt, Het Financieele Dagblad reported today, citing
people it didnâ€™t identify.  The ratio of debt to earnings before interest, taxes,
depreciation and amortization at the end of 2011 was adjusted to
7 from 6, the newspaper said. Van Gansewinkel will pay a higher
interest in exchange for the new conditions, Het Financieele
Dagblad said.  Click here for web link  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
