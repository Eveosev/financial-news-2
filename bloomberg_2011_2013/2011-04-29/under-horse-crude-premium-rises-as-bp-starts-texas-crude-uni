The premiums for Thunder Horse and
Southern Green Canyon crudes in the U.S. Gulf strengthened as  BP
Plc (BP/)  started a crude unit at its Texas City refinery in Texas
that shut after a power failure April 25.  BP Plc’s 475,000-barrel-a-day Texas City refinery started a
crude unit late yesterday, according to a person familiar with
the situation. Other process units will begin startup within the
next few, said the person, who declined to be identified because
the information isn’t public.  Thunder Horse’s premium gained 15 cents to $10.50 a barrel
over West Texas Intermediate at 12:06 p.m. in  New York ,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Southern Green Canyon’s
premium strengthened 5 cents to $4.75 a barrel.  BP helps produce and sell Thunder Horse and Southern Green
Canyon crude streams from the U.S.  Gulf Coast , according to the
company’s  website .  Heavy Louisiana Sweet’s premium to WTI weakened 15 cents to
$14.10 a barrel. Light Louisiana Sweet’s premium was unchanged
at $15 over the benchmark.  Mars Blend’s premium weakened 5 cents to $6.80 a barrel
over WTI. Poseidon’s premium narrowed 35 cents to $7.  West Texas Sour’s discount gained 5 cents to $3.10 a
barrel. It has tracked more closely to its historical average
discount versus WTI because it’s delivered in Midland, Texas,
away from the Gulf Coast and close to Cushing,  Oklahoma , the
delivery point for oil traded on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange .  The premium for Syncrude gained 50 cents to $10.50 a
barrel. Syncrude is a light, low-sulfur synthetic oil derived
