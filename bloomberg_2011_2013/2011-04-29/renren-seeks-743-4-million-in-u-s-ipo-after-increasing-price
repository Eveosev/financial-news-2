Renren Inc., the operator of
 China â€™s largest social-networking service, will attempt to raise
as much as $743.4 million in its U.S. initial public offering,
27 percent more than previously sought.  The Beijing-based company is offering 53.1 million American
depositary receipts for $12 to $14 each after previously setting
the price range at $9 to $11, it said in a filing with the
Securities and Exchange Commission today. Each ADR represents
three Class A ordinary shares, the filing shows.  Renren will receive estimated proceeds of about $628.8
million from the IPO and a concurrent private placement of
shares to investors and will use the funds for research and
development, expanding sales and marketing, and general
corporate purposes, the filing said.  The shares will list on the New York Stock Exchange next
week under the ticker RENN, according to the company filing and
data compiled by Bloomberg. The offering is being led by  Morgan
Stanley (MS) ,  Deutsche Bank AG (DBK)  and  Credit Suisse Group AG. (CSGN)   To contact the reporter:
