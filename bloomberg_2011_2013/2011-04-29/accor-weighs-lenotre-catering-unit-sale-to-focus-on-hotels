Accor SA (AC) ,  Europe ’s largest hotel
company, is studying a possible sale of its Lenotre catering
business as it seeks to focus on the lodging business.  Accor has received expressions of interest from several
potential buyers, the Evry, France-based company said in a
statement today.  The owner of the Novotel and Motel 6 brands sold its Cie.
des Wagon-Lits onboard rail-catering operations in July after
the spinoff of its Edenred voucher-services division. Accor in
January agreed to sell its 49 percent stake in casino company
Groupe Lucien Barriere to focus on hotels.  Lenotre, which operates 64 outlets in 13 countries, may be
worth between 50 million euros ($74 million) and 60 million
euros, according to Guillaume Rascoussier, an analyst at Oddo &
Cie. A private-equity firm or food company may want to buy
Lenotre, he said.  “This is good news for Accor,” Rascoussier said by phone.
“Lenotre is one of the last assets Accor needs to sell before
it can focus fully on hotels.”  A sale would give Lenotre added resources offered by
partners and help it grow, Accor said in the statement.  “Lenotre has synergies through partnerships with Accor
businesses, but there’s no need for them to have the same owner
for it to work,” said Oddo’s Rascoussier.  Accor shares fell as much as 17 cents, or 0.6 percent, and
traded at 30.15 euros, down 0.3 percent, at 9:56 a.m. in Paris,
giving the company a market value of 6.8 billion euros.  To contact the reporter on this story:
