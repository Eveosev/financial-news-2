Gold rose to a record in  New York 
as a weakening dollar and inflation prompted investors to buy
precious metals.  The dollar fell to the lowest since December 2009 against
the euro yesterday after the  Federal Reserve  kept borrowing
costs at a record low. Assets in the SPDR Gold Trust, the
biggest exchange-traded fund backed by gold, have expanded 1.5
percent this month, heading for the biggest gain since August.  “The sinking dollar is driving people to the gold
market,” said Lim Han Jo, a Seoul-based trader with Tongyang
Futures Co.  Gold for delivery in June rose $9, or 0.6 percent, to the
high of $1,540.20 an ounce by 7:57 a.m. on the Comex in New
York. The metal for immediate delivery earlier today climbed to
a record $1,540.85 an ounce.  Eighteen of 21 traders, investors and analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg, or 86 percent, said bullion will rise next week.
Three predicted lower prices.  Silver for July delivery climbed $1.279, or 2.7 percent, to
$48.82 an ounce and platinum for delivery the same month jumped
$9.60, or 0.5 percent, to $1,849.50 an ounce. Palladium for June
delivery rose $10.75, or 1.4 percent, to $786.05 an ounce.  To contact the reporter on this story;
