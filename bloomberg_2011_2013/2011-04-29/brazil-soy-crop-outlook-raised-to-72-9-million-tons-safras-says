Soybean output in  Brazil , the
world’s largest producer after the U.S., will rise more than
previously forecast this year to 72.9 million metric tons, crop
forecaster  Safras & Mercado  said.  The Porto-Alegre based firm raised its soybean harvest
estimate from the 71.6 million tons estimated in March, the
company said in an e-mailed statement today. The output will be
6 percent higher than last year.  Output in the center-western state of Mato Grosso, the
biggest producing region in the country, may rise 7 percent to
20.2 million tons, Safras said. Parana state will harvest 14.8
million tons and  Rio Grande  do Sul state will produce 11.5
million tons, the report said. Both states are in the country’s
South.  Brazil’s Agriculture Ministry said April 6 the soybean crop
will rise to 72.2 million tons, up from 68.7 million tons last
year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
