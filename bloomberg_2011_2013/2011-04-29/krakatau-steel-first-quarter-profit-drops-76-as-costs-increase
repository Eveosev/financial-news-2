PT Krakatau Steel,  Indonesia ’s
largest maker of the metal, said it posted a 76 percent drop in
first-quarter net income as sales declined and costs increased.
Krakatau shares fell.  Profit in the three months ended March 31 plunged to 113.5
billion rupiah ($13.2 million), or 9 rupiah a share, from 468
billion rupiah, or 30 rupiah a share a year earlier, the
Jakarta-based company said in a filing to the stock exchange
yesterday.  Revenue fell to 4.2 trillion rupiah from 4.4 trillion
rupiah, Krakatau said. Cost of goods sold rose to 3.8 trillion
rupiah from 3.5 trillion rupiah, it said.  Krakatau joined other steelmakers in  Asia  in reporting
lower earnings as rising energy and raw material prices
increased the cost of production. Crude oil rose about 17
percent in the first quarter on concern that tensions in the
Middle East and North Africa may disrupt supplies.  South Korea’s  Posco (005490) , the world’s third-biggest steelmaker
by volume, said net income fell 33 percent in the first quarter
to 927 billion won ($863.5 million), the company said in a
filing April 22.  Krakatau fell 1.7 percent to 1,150 rupiah a share at 11:30
a.m. midday break in Jakarta trading. The stock has declined
more than 4 percent this year, compared with the 2.6 percent
gain on the benchmark  Jakarta Composite index. (JCI)   To contact the reporter on this story:
