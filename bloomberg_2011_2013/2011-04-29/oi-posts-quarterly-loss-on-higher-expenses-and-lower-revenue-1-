Tele Norte Leste Participacoes SA (TNLP4) ,
 Brazil ’s biggest fixed-line phone company, posted a loss in the
first quarter due to lower revenue and higher expenses.  The company, known as Oi, posted a loss of 170 million
reais ($108 million), compared with a profit of 469 million
reais a year earlier, the Rio de Janeiro-based company said in a
regulatory filing yesterday.  Sales fell 7.1 percent to 6.93 billion reais, while net
expenses increased to 1.23 billion reais, from 574 million a
year earlier.  The operator had 19.7 percent of Brazil’s mobile telephone
market in March, the lowest share among the top four companies
in the market, after  Vivo Participacoes SA (VIVO4) , Claro SA and  Tim
Participacoes SA. (TCSL4)  Oi was the leader of new additions in March,
with 1.03 million.  “After a long period of weak sales activity, the company
managed to grow again in a stronger way in the mobile telephony
segment,” Banco Fator Corretora analysts including Jacqueline Lison wrote in an April 26 note. “However, the greater sales
rate has not been reflected in higher revenues as the company
has carried out a number of promotions to support this change in
strategy.”  Oi’s preferred shares fell 1.3 percent to 26.32 reais at
9:37 a.m. New York time in  Sao Paulo  trading. The stock has
risen 7.9 percent this year, compared with a 4.8 percent decline
in Brazil’s benchmark Bovespa index.  To contact the reporter on this story: Felipe Frisch, in Sao
