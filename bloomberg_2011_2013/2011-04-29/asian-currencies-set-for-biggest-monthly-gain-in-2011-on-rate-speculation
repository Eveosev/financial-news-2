Asian currencies had their biggest
monthly advance since December, led by Singapore’s dollar and
 South Korea ’s won, on speculation regional central banks will
boost borrowing costs to tame inflation.  The Bloomberg-JPMorgan  Asia  Dollar Index touched its
highest level since August 1997 yesterday as the world’s fastest
economic growth and interest-rate increases helped attract funds
from abroad. India,  China , South Korea, Taiwan, Thailand,
 Indonesia  and the  Philippines  have raised rates in 2011. China’s
yuan rose beyond 6.5 per dollar for the first time since 1993
yesterday on speculation the central bank will allow quicker
gains to tackle the fastest inflation in more than two years.  “Prospects of strong economic growth in Asia are
attracting fund inflows into the region’s stocks and bonds,”
said Kozo Hasegawa, a currency trader at Sumitomo Mitsui Banking
Corp. in Bangkok. “Some countries in the region also seem to be
more tolerant with currency gains to stem inflation,
accelerating appreciation.”  Singapore ’s dollar climbed 2.9 percent this month to
S$1.2252 against its U.S. counterpart, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. South Korea’s won advanced 2.4 percent to
1,071.53 and Taiwan’s dollar rallied 2.3 percent to NT$28.762.
The Asia Dollar Index gained 1.5 percent this month.  Asia’s developing economies will expand 8.4 percent this
year, outpacing growth of 2.8 percent in the U.S., 1.6 percent
in the euro area and 4.7 percent in Latin America, according to
International Monetary Fund forecasts published this month.
Global funds bought $7.9 billion more Indian, South Korean and
Taiwanese equities than they sold this month, according to the
latest exchange data.  Yuan Appreciation  Benchmark  interest rates  in  India  and Indonesia are at 6.75
percent and China’s is at 6.31 percent, compared with a maximum
0.25 percent in Japan and the U.S.  China’s yuan rose 0.16 percent to 6.4912 per dollar
yesterday, according to China Foreign Exchange Trade System. It
touched 6.4892, the strongest level since the country unified
official and market exchange rates at the end of 1993, after the
 Federal Reserve  signaled plans to maintain its record monetary
stimulus earlier this week. The yuan rallied 0.24 percent this
week and 0.88 percent this month.  Consumer prices in Asia’s biggest economy rose 5.4 percent
in March from a year earlier, the most since July 2008, official
data show. Prices may rise up to 5.6 percent in May and June,
the Xinhua News Agency reported April 28, citing an unidentified
Ministry of Finance official.  “The central bank is tolerating faster currency
appreciation to contain import costs,” David Cohen, a
Singapore-based economist at Action Economics said.  Fed Stance  Taiwan ’s dollar posted a second weekly advance as overseas
investors bought $1.2 billion more local shares than they sold
this week, according to exchange data. Fed Chairman Ben S. Bernanke retained a pledge this week to keep interest rates
“exceptionally low” for an “extended period.”  “Foreign inflows were the main factor driving the
appreciation this week, especially after Bernanke made the
comments,” said Tarsicio Tong, a Taipei-based currency trader
at the Union Bank of Taiwan.  Elsewhere, Malaysia’s ringgit advanced 2.2 percent this
month to 2.9615 per dollar, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. Indonesia’s rupiah gained 1.6 percent to 8,566, the
Philippine peso climbed 1.4 percent to 42.803 and  Thailand ’s
baht rallied 1.3 percent 29.88. India’s rupee rose 0.8 percent
to 44.215.  To contact the reporter on this story:
