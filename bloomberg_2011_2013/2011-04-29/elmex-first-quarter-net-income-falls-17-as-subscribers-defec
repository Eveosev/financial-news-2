Telefonos de  Mexico  SAB, the
nation’s largest land-line telephone company, said first-quarter
profit dropped 17 percent as customers switched to cable rivals
offering phone and Internet plans.  Net income fell to 3.76 billion pesos ($325 million), or 21
centavos a share, from 4.52 billion pesos, or 25 centavos, a
year earlier, Mexico City-based Telmex said yesterday. Sales
slipped 3.6 percent to 27.5 billion pesos, below the 28.2
billion peso average of analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  Telmex, controlled by billionaire  Carlos Slim ’s America
Movil SAB, is offering a package with satellite-TV provider Dish
Mexico to keep clients from switching to  Grupo Televisa SA (TLEVICPO) ’s
cable units. The cable operators can sell TV, phone and Internet
service on a single line, while Telmex is barred by regulators
from directly offering video plans.  Phone lines operated by Telmex fell to 15.6 million, a loss
of 29,000 from the previous quarter. High-speed Internet
subscriptions increased 209,000 to 7.6 million.  Telmex fell 19 centavos to 10.82 pesos yesterday in Mexico
City trading. The shares have gained 8.1 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
