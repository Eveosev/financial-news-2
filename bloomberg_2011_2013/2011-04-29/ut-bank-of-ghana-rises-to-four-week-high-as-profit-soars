UT Bank Ltd. (UTB) , a lender in  Ghana ,
rose to the highest in nearly four weeks as its first-quarter
profit soared more than sevenfold.  The stock gained 2 pesewas, or 7.4 percent, to 29 pesewas
by 1:21 p.m. in Accra, the capital. Thatâ€™s the highest since
April 4.  Net income for the three months through March increased to
1.1 million cedis ($731,139) from 152,000 cedis a year earlier,
the bank said in a statement published in the Accra-based
