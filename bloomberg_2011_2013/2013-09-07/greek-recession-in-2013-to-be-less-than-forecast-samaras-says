Greece ’s economic contraction this
year will be less than forecast as tourism reaches a record and
2014 will see growth, Prime Minister Antonis Samaras said.  “This year the recession will be shallower than forecast
with tourism seeing a record year as visitor numbers are
expected to reach or even surpass 18 million, the first time so
many tourists were seen in Greece,” Samaras said in a speech
today in the northern port city of Thessaloniki.  Tourism is forecast to generate more than 11 billion euros
($14.5 billion) in direct income and over 30 billion euros in
indirect revenue for Greece this year, “levels that weren’t
budgeted for at the beginning of the year,” Samaras said.  Greece’s economy contracted 3.8 percent in the second
quarter, the least in three years, beating an initial estimate
of 4.6 percent on an improved performance in trade and tourism,
the Hellenic Statistical Service said yesterday.  Greece is within reach of achieving a primary budget
surplus in 2013 that will open the way for debt relief in 2014
and that “will allow the country to leave behind the era of
troika agreements,” Samaras said.  The country already had a budget surplus of 1.1 billion
euros in the first seven months and the figures for August
“already seem very promising given increased revenue from
tourism,” he said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
