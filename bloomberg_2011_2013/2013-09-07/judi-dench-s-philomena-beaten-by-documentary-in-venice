“Sacro GRA,” a documentary filmed
by Gianfranco Rosi on Rome’s lengthy ring road, won the Venice
Film Festival’s Golden Lion award last night, defeating Stephen Frears’s “Philomena” starring  Judi Dench .  “Philomena” -- popular with Venice reviewers -- walked
away with the best screenplay award. The script was co-written
by the film’s co-star  Steve Coogan  and by Jeff Pope.  The best director prize went to Greek director Alexandros
Avranas for “Miss Violence,” a story of domestic abuse that
opens with an 11-year-old girl jumping to her death on her
birthday.  It was one of two prizes for the film, whose male lead
Themis Panou won the best-actor trophy.  The best actress prize -- which many critics thought would
go to Dench’s portrayal of an Irish woman in search of her long-lost son -- rewarded  Italy ’s Elena Cotta, for her role in “Via
Castellana Bandiera,” directed by Emma Dante.  The Grand Jury Prize went to Tsai Ming-liang for “Stray
Dogs,” about an impoverished father and his two children who
roam the streets of Taipei and its outskirts in a struggle for
survival.  The Special Jury Prize went to another tale of domestic
violence: “The Police Officer’s Wife,” directed by  Germany ’s
Philip Groening.  The only U.S. contestant to win one of the main Venice
awards this year was 16-year-old Tye Sheridan. He took the
Marcello Mastroianni Prize given to young actors for his role as
Nicolas Cage’s co-star in “Joe’’ (directed by David Gordon
Green).  To contact the writer on the story:
