Citigroup Inc. (C)  is moving employees
on the  Chicago  Board of Trade’s grain and financial floors to
its office in Chicago, according to a person briefed on the
decision who asked not to be named because it isn’t public.  The bank has a sales staff there of about 20 people who
handle transactions in interest-rate products, equities and
commodities, Reuters reported earlier today, citing an
unidentified person familiar with the plan. Most of the workers
will keep their jobs, the publication said.  Firms have moved trading personnel off the floor amid a
shift in transactions to electronic platforms.  “Citi is committed to the futures business and we will
continue to be an active market participant in the sector,”
said Scott Helfman, a spokesman for the New York-based firm, in
an e-mailed statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
