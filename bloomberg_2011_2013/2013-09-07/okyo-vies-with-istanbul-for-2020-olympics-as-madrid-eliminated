Tokyo and Istanbul advanced to the
final vote for the host city for the 2020  Summer Olympics  as
Madrid was eliminated.  The Spanish and Turkish cities were tied in the first round
and went to another vote to eliminate one, a poll won by
Istanbul. The final vote was held and the winner between Tokyo
and Istanbul will be announced later today.  The finalists made presentations to the International
Olympic Committee today in  Buenos Aires  before 94 IOC members
decided on the host. Each city had to face questions this week
about its preparations and ability to hold the summer games,
which winning bidders often use to improve transport and other
infrastructure.  Before the vote, Tokyo was the favorite, according to
oddschecker.com, which gathers odds from Internet betting sites.
The Japanese capital was 11-10, meaning a successful bet of $10
will return $11 plus the original stake.  Madrid  was 11-4 and
Istanbul 5-1.  To contact the reporter on this story:
