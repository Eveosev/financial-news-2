Gilts declined for a seventh week,
the longest streak in more than  six years , as reports showed
U.K. manufacturing and services industries expanded last month,
adding to evidence of accelerating growth.  Sterling rose for the first time in three weeks against the
dollar as a report showed the  U.S. economy  added fewer jobs in
August than economists projected. It also advanced against the
euro. Ten-year yields climbed above 3 percent for the first time
since July 2011 after the Bank of England’s Monetary Policy
Committee left its stimulus program unchanged and kept its
benchmark rate at a record low.  “An increase in yields appears to be justified by the
recent domestic data and events,” said Peter Osler, head of
rates strategy at broker Marex Spectron Group Ltd. in  London .
“The pace of the recovery is ruling out further bond purchases
under the quantitative-easing program for now, but QE might
remain a vocal topic at the MPC just to discourage selling,
regardless of the strength in economic data.”  The 10-year gilt yield climbed 17 basis points from last
week to 2.94 percent at 5 p.m. London time yesterday. It rose to
3.01 percent on Sept. 5, the highest since July 27, 2011. The
2.25 percent security due September 2023 dropped 1.38, or 13.80
pounds per 1,000-pound ($1,563) face amount, to 94.08. The seven
consecutive weeks of decline marked the longest run since
February 2007.  Services, Manufacturing  U.K. services expanded at the fastest pace since 2006 while
manufacturing output rose to the highest level in 2 1/2 years,
gauges based on surveys of  purchasing managers  showed.  The MPC, meeting for the first time since introducing
forward guidance on  interest rates  last month, held its asset-purchase  target  at 375 billion pounds on Sept. 5 and kept its
official  interest rate  at 0.5 percent.  Under the Bank of England’s guidance policy, the MPC plans
to keep its key interest rate on hold as long as unemployment
exceeds 7 percent. The jobless rate was at 7.8 percent,
according to data released on Aug. 14.  Sterling rose 0.8 percent against the dollar in the week to
$1.5631. It appreciated 1.3 percent to 84.23 pence per euro.  The pound strengthened 6.6 percent over the past six
months, the best performer among 10 developed-nation currencies
tracked by Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes. The euro
gained 3.7 percent and the dollar climbed 2 percent.  The U.S. Labor Department reported yesterday that the
economy added 169,000 jobs last month compared with a revised
104,000 rise in July that was smaller than initially estimated.
The median forecast of economists surveyed by Bloomberg called
for an August increase of 180,000.  The U.K. unemployment rate stayed at 7.8 percent in the
three months through July, according to a survey of economists
by  Bloomberg News  before the data is released next week.  U.K. government bonds lost 5.1 percent this year through
Sept. 5, according to Bloomberg World Bond Indexes. German
securities dropped 3.1 percent and Treasuries declined 4.3
percent, the indexes show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
