Nova Scotia Premier Darrell Dexter
called an election for Oct. 8, seeking a second mandate in the
eastern Canadian province for his  New Democratic Party .  Dexter made the announcement today in Port Hawkesbury,
Canadian Press reported. He has pledged to maintain a  balanced
budget  while removing a provincial  sales tax  on some household
items.  The NDP’s support among 31 percent of voters trailed the
 Liberal Party  by 10 percentage points, according to a Corporate
Research Associates  poll  taken last month. Nova Scotia’s
economic growth of 1.2 percent this year will be the third
slowest among the country’s 10 provinces, according to a Bank of
Montreal  forecast .  Dexter led his party to power for the first time in the
last campaign, and held 31 seats in the legislature when the
election was called today. The Liberals had 12 seats, the
Progressive Conservatives held seven, with two vacancies.  To contact the reporter on this story:
