Arsenal manager  Arsene Wenger  is
prepared to look to the Bundesliga in the next transfer period
after his club-record signing of German international Mesut
Ozil, the Telegraph said.  Wenger has requested scouting reports on  Borussia Dortmund 
teammates Marco Reus and Ilkay Gundogan and Bayer Leverkusenâ€™s
Lars Bender, the Telegraph said. Wenger admires the academy
system in Germany which has produced many of the top young
players in Europe, the newspaper said.  Arsenal broke its club record by spending 42.7 million
pounds ($67 million) to sign Ozil from Real Madrid on the final
day of the transfer period Sept. 2. Having missed out on adding
a needed striker, Wenger is also tracking Uruguay and Palermo
forward Abel Hernandez, the Telegraph said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
