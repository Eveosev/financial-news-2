Liverpool striker  Daniel Sturridge 
has been ruled out of England’s World Cup soccer qualifier at
Ukraine with a groin injury.  Sturridge missed last night’s 4-0 qualifying win over
Moldova with the injury and England officials hoped he’d be
available for the Sept. 10 game in Kiev.  “His injury has not progressed as had been hoped and it is
now clear that Sturridge will not be fit for the match,”
England’s Football Association said in a statement.  England is short of strikers with  Wayne Rooney  and Andy
Carroll injured and Danny Welbeck suspended for the match after
scoring two goals against Moldova. Manager Roy Hodgson will not
make any additions to his squad, the F.A. said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
