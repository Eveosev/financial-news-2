Japanese Finance Minister Taro Aso
said that the yen isn’t weak compared with the level before the
collapse of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. in 2008.  The Japanese currency was at 108 per dollar before Lehman
went bankrupt, Aso said at a press briefing yesterday evening in
St. Petersburg,  Russia , after a Group of 20 nations summit. The
yen gained 1 percent to 99.11 per dollar yesterday.  The finance minister reiterated that the Japanese
government will decide by early October on whether to press
ahead in April with increasing a sales tax to 8 percent from 5
percent. That move would shore up the nation’s finances while
dealing a blow to consumption and growth, posing a threat to
Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s campaign to drive an economic
revival after about 15 years of deflation.  Aso has previously made similar comparisons with pre-Lehman
levels for the yen, which strengthened as the global financial
crisis deepened. The currency fell more than 20 percent over the
past year as Abe pledged stronger monetary easing and the Bank
of  Japan  followed through with unprecedented stimulus.  A government report due on Sept. 9 is estimated by
economists surveyed by Bloomberg News to show that gross
domestic product rose at an annualized pace of 3.9 percent in
the second quarter, higher than an initial assessment of 2.6
percent.  Lehman filed for bankruptcy in September 2008, deepening
the financial crisis that triggered a global recession.  To contact the reporters on this story:
