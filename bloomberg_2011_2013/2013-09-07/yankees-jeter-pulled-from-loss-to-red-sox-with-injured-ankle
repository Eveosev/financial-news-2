A scan of  Derek Jeter ’s surgically
repaired left ankle was negative after the  New York Yankees ’
shortstop was pulled today from a 13-9 loss to the Boston Red
Sox.  The results of the scan were sent for a second opinion to
Dr.  Robert Anderson , the surgeon who operated on the fractured
ankle Oct. 20, the team said in an e-mail.  Manager  Joe Girardi  sent in a pinch-runner for Jeter, 39,
in the sixth inning after watching the team captain run to first
base at Yankee Stadium. He may have hurt the ankle when he
fielded a grounder and planted his left foot before throwing
wide to first base.  “Yeah, there’s concern,” Girardi told reporters after the
game yesterday. “Let’s see how he feels tomorrow.”  Jeter missed the first 91 games of the Major League
Baseball season while recovering from the fracture. He strained
a thigh muscle running the bases in his season debut on July 11,
forcing him to miss 12 more games.  The American League East-leading Red Sox (87-57) handed the
fourth-place Yankees their third straight loss. The Yankees
(75-67) are 11 games behind Boston with one game left today in
the current series.  “If these games didn’t count, he could take a few days off
where his bounce-back would be different,” Yankees General
Manager  Brian Cashman  said. “He’s like everyone else. He knows
there’s no days, no time for the weary here.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
