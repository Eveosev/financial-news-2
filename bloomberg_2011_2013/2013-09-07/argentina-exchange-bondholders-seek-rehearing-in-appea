A group of  Argentina  exchange
bondholders are seeking a rehearing by a U.S. appeals court of
an order forcing the country to pay in full holders of $1.5
billion in its defaulted debt when it makes payments to them.  The bondholders allege that the decision conflicts with
other court rulings and will likely trigger default on $65
billion worth of exchange bonds held by innocent third parties.  The appeals court last month, referring to Argentina as “a
uniquely recalcitrant debtor,” rejected the country’s arguments
that ruling for debt-holders led by billionaire hedge fund
manager  Paul Singer ’s Elliott Management Corp. and Aurelius
Capital Management LP would violate its sovereignty and expose
it to a fresh financial crisis by threatening a default of the
new bonds.  Courts are required to consider the possible effects of an
injunction on the rights of third parties, the bondholders said
in today’s filing in the U.S. Court of Appeals in  New York .  “The property rights of the innocent third party exchange
bondholder group are being held as a hostage to pressure the
republic to pay” defaulted debt holders, Sean O’Shea, an
attorney for the exchange bondholder group, said in the filing.  The case is NML Capital Ltd. v. Republic of Argentina,
12-00105,  U.S. Court of Appeals  for the Second Circuit (New
York).  To contact the reporter on this story:
