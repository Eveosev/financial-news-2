Top-seeded Novak Djokovic reached
the men’s championship match of the U.S. Open with a five-set
victory over Stanislas Wawrinka that took more than four hours.  Djokovic, a six-time Grand Slam champion from Serbia, beat
Wawrinka, the No. 9 seed from Switzerland, 2-6, 7-6 (7-4), 3-6,
6-3, 6-4 at the National Tennis Center in New York.  He will play for the title in two days against the winner
of the other semifinal between second-seeded  Rafael Nadal  of
Spain and eighth-seeded  Richard Gasquet  of France.  Wawrinka, in his first Grand Slam semifinal, played the
final 1 1/2 sets after being treated for a strained right thigh.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
