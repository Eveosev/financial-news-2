An investor in a failed bid to build
a 400-foot-high  Ferris wheel  in  Florida  is asking a judge to
appoint an independent monitor to oversee the sale of the
attraction’s proposed site, according to an unsealed court
filing.  Lawyers for Great Wheel Beteliligungs GMBH & Co. KG, formed
to build a giant Ferris wheel in Berlin, contends the developer
of the defunct U.S. attraction wants to improperly withhold more
than $1.2 million from the sale of the site. The German company,
which says it invested $63 million in the Orlando, Florida,
project, wants Delaware Chancery Court Judge Travis Laster to
appoint a receiver to monitor the sale.  The sale of the  Great Orlando Wheel Corp. ’s assets “would
result in a windfall” for the owner of the Florida site and
unfairly hamper the German company’s “ability to recoup its
significant investment,” the lawyers said in the suit, filed
Aug. 2. The case was unsealed yesterday at the request of
 Bloomberg News .  Wil Armstrong, a spokesman for Great Orlando Wheel, didn’t
immediately return a call for comment on the request for a
receiver.  The German company contends Andreas Florian Bollen,
chairman of the Singapore-based  Great Wheel Corp. , controls the
Florida firm created in 2007 to build the “Great Orlando
Wheel,” according to court filings. Bollen’s company has built
giant Ferris wheels in London and Singapore.  Tourist Draw  Financial problems prompted Bollen to put the Orlando
project on hold, Armstrong told the Orlando Sentinel newspaper
in 2009. The wheel was designed as a tourist draw, offering
panoramic views of Orlando attractions such as the  Walt Disney
Co. (DIS) ’s Walt Disney World and  Universal Studios ’ theme parks.  The Florida company defaulted on notes it secured as part
of the project and has sought to sell the wheel’s 20-acre site
for $12 million, lawyers for the Germany company said in court
filings.  Bollen, who invested only $5,000 in the Florida project, is
seeking to withhold more than $1.2 million of the proceeds of
the sale and refusing to go forward with the deal unless that
money is set aside.  A receiver should be appointed to remove the threat of
“further financial harm” to the German investor, the company’s
lawyers said in the filing.  Bollen’s  Singapore  Flyer, which was put into receivership
in May, is the world’s largest Ferris wheel and can hold as many
as 784 passengers. The wheel takes about 30 minutes to complete
a revolution. At 165 meters high, it is 30 meters higher than
the English Ferris wheel, known as the London Eye.  Orlando Eye  Another developer is pushing ahead with construction of a
425-foot tall observation wheel in Orlando as part of an
entertainment complex known as “I-Drive Live,” according to
the Sentinel.  The complex is slated to have a  Madam Tussaud’s Wax Museum 
and a Sea Life Aquarium in addition to the Ferris wheel, which
will be known as the  Orlando  Eye, the newspaper said.  The case is Great Wheel Beteliligungs GMBH & Co. KG v.
Great Orlando Wheel Corporation, 8768, Delaware Chancery Court
(Wilmington).  To contact the reporters on this story:
