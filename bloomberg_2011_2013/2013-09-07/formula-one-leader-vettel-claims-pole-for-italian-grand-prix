Sebastian Vettel won pole position
in tomorrow’s Italian Grand Prix as he looks to extend his lead
in the Formula One standings.  Vettel had a qualifying time of 1 minute, 23.755 seconds at
Monza to beat out Red Bull teammate  Mark Webber  by 0.213
seconds. It’s the fourth pole of the season for the three-time
defending world champion and the 40th of his career.  The Red Bull team hasn’t fared well at Monza recently, with
Vettel’s victory in 2011 its only top-three finish in the past
four years.  “This circuit has been a bit up and down for us, but this
year it’s surely been more up,” Vettel told reporters. “The
car feels great, but let’s see what we can do tomorrow. We don’t
get any points from today.”  Sauber’s  Nico Hulkenberg  was third-fastest, followed by
Ferrari teammates Felipe Massa and  Fernando Alonso . Daniel
Ricciardo of STR, McLaren teammates Sergio Perez and Jenson Button and STR’s Jean-Eric Vergne rounded out the top 10
qualifiers.  Lewis Hamilton  of Mercedes, who started from pole for the
past four races, didn’t make it to the third qualifying round
and will start 12th.  “It’s hugely disappointing, not just for me, but also for
the team and I can only apologize to them as we had a quick car
today,” Hamilton said. “Qualifying has always been a real
strong point for me but it really didn’t come together this
afternoon.”  Vettel has won five of 11 races this season to lead the
standings with 197 points. Alonso is second with 151 points and
Hamilton is third with 139.  To contact the reporter on this story:
