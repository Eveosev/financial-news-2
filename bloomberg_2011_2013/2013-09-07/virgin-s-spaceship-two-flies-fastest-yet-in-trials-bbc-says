Virgin Galactic’s SpaceShip Two
achieved record speeds and altitude in tests before its first
flight with passengers next year, the British Broadcasting Corp.
said on its website.  At 160,000 pounds ($250,128) a ticket, the flight offers
1,000-mile views of the earth, the  BBC  said, citing the latest
trial footage. The spaceship will cruise at an altitude of 70
miles, according to the report.  Richard Branson ’s Virgin Galactic is backed by the Abu
Dhabi government’s Aabar Investments wealth fund.  To contact the reporter on this story:
