Germany’s bonds fell this week,
pushing 10-year yields to a 17-month high, as  European Central
Bank  President  Mario Draghi  failed to convince investors
interest rates will remain low amid global economic growth.  Austrian, French and  Dutch (GNTH10YR)  10-year yields all climbed to
the highest in more than a year as most government bond markets
across the euro region tumbled along with Treasuries. Draghi
said the ECB “expects the key ECB interest rates to remain at
present or lower levels for an extended period of time,” at a
press conference in Frankfurt on Sept. 5. Reports showed
manufacturing in the euro area and China expanded last month.  “We’ve seen the European  Central Bank ’s not willing to
pick a fight with the market,” said  Gianluca Salford , a fixed-income strategist at JPMorgan Chase & Co. in London. “The
selloff in European bonds this week was in part the by-product
of the weakness in the  Treasury (USGG10YR)  market. We expect the strong
economic data in Europe to remain a powerful catalyst, pushing
yields higher in core markets.”  Germany’s  10-year bund  yield climbed nine basis points, or
0.09 percentage point, this week to 1.95 percent as of 5 p.m.
London time yesterday after reaching 2.05 percent, the  highest 
since March 21, 2012. The 1.5 percent security due in May 2023
dropped 0.8, or 8 euros per 1,000-euro ($1,317) face amount, to
96.065. The rate on the nation’s  two-year note  increased three
basis points from Aug. 30 to 0.27 percent.  ECB Decision  The ECB kept its benchmark  interest rate  at a record-low
0.5 percent at its Sept. 5 meeting as Draghi said risks to the
region’s economic outlook remain on the downside.  A euro-area  index  based on a survey of purchasing managers
in the manufacturing industry increased to a 26-month high of
51.4 from 50.3 in July, Markit Economics said on Sept. 2. A
gauge of Chinese manufacturing advanced to 50.1 last month from
47.7 in July. Readings above 50 signal expansion.  Bund yields also climbed as the rate on Treasury 10-year
notes rose above 3 percent yesterday amid speculation the
 Federal Reserve  will slow its bond-buying program when policy
makers meet on Sept. 17-18.  Euro-area  government bonds  pared their declines after a
report yesterday showed U.S. employers added fewer workers in
August than economists forecast.  France’s  10-year yield  increased eight basis points this
week to 2.55 percent, after touching 2.64 percent on Sept. 5,
the highest since July 2, 2012. At an auction of 10-year debt on
Sept. 5, the nation’s borrowing costs rose to the most since
President  Francois Hollande  was elected in May 2012.  The rate on Austria’s 10-year bonds added nine basis points
to 2.39 percent, while similar-maturity Dutch yields increased
nine basis points to 2.38 percent after reaching 2.47 percent
yesterday, the highest since April 2012.  Germany is scheduled to auction 5 billion euros of bunds
maturing in August 2023 on Sept. 11. The Netherlands is due to
offer 10-year securities on Sept. 10, while Italy plans to sell
bonds on Sept. 12.  German bonds lost 3.1 percent this year through Sept. 5,
according to Bloomberg World Bond Indexes. Italian securities
returned 2.9 percent, while Spain’s earned 7.2 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
