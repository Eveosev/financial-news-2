Asian  stocks  rose this week, with
the regional benchmark index posting its biggest weekly advance
since April, as data from China, Europe and the U.S. boosted
optimism the global economy is recovering.  Honda Motor Co., which gets about 83 percent of sales
outside Japan, jumped 6.8 percent in Tokyo.  China Cosco Holdings
Co. (1919)  climbed 9.8 percent in  Hong Kong , pacing gains among the
region’s shipping companies after a gauge of cargo rates
increased to a 21-month high.  Billabong (BBG)  International Ltd. rose
4.7 percent after the Australian surfwear company said Coastal
Capital International Ltd. is seeking a board shakeup.  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index advanced 2.8 percent to 133.76
this week after declining in three of the past four. Shares in
China and Hong Kong led the advance after reports showed a gauge
of Chinese manufacturing increased to a 16-month high and the
nation’s services industry expanded. U.S. service industries
grew in August at the fastest pace in almost eight years.  “The market rebounded as we are getting improving economic
data,” said Nader Naeimi, Sydney-based head of dynamic  asset
allocation  at AMP Capital Investors Ltd., which manages more
than $130 billion. “With that improvement in economic data,
we’ve seen a surge in bond yields and that’s bad for  emerging
markets  with high current account deficits. Given this, the
volatility in the equity market is likely to remain high.”  Yields on  10-year U.S. treasuries  rose to a two-year high
of 3.005 percent before sliding to 2.93 percent in New York
after a report of slower-than-forecast jobs growth eased concern
the  Federal Reserve  will cut stimulus.  Fed Tapering  The Fed has said any reduction in stimulus will be tied to
a sustained recovery in the  U.S. economy . U.S. payrolls rose by
169,000 last month, less than the 180,000 estimate in a
Bloomberg survey of economists and easing concern about the size
of potential cuts to Fed bond purchases when policy makers meet
Sept. 17-18.  Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index climbed 4.1 percent, the most
since September 2012. China’s Shanghai Composite Index rose 2
percent, extending gains for a second week. Taiwan’s Taiex index
advanced 1.8 percent.  Japan’s Topix index jumped 3.8 percent this week as the
Japanese yen weakened. South Korea’s Kospi index gained 1.5
percent. Singapore’s Straits Times Index added 0.6 percent. New
Zealand’s NZX 50 Index rose 1.2 percent.  Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 Index climbed 0.2 percent ahead of
this weekend’s election, which polls indicate will see Prime
Minister  Kevin Rudd ’s minority Labor government lose to  Tony
Abbott ’s Liberal-National coalition.  Exporters Rise  Exporters advanced after reports showed fewer Americans
filed for  unemployment benefits  as U.S. companies boosted
payrolls CHECK and euro-area services and factory output
expanded for a second month in August. Japanese carmakers and
electronics manufacturers also gained as the yen fell.  Honda climbed 6.8 percent to 3,785 yen in Tokyo. Toyota
Motor Corp., Asia’s biggest carmaker, rose 4.6 percent to 6,210
yen. Sony Corp., the maker of Bravia televisions and PlayStation
game consoles, gained 5.8 percent to 2,087 yen.  Shipping companies rallied after the  Baltic Dry Index (BDIY) ,
which measures the cost of shipping commodities from  iron ore  to
corn, jumped 19 percent this week in London, the biggest weekly
advance since August 2010.  China Cosco rose 9.8 percent to HK$3.91 in Hong Kong.  STX
Pan Ocean Co. (028670) , South Korea’s biggest bulk-shipping company,
jumped 23 percent to 2,750 won in Seoul. Kawasaki Kisen Kaisha
Ltd., which transports commodities from grains to iron ore,
added 7.2 percent to 238 yen in Tokyo.  Billabong, Minzhong  Billabong rose 4.7 percent to 44.5 Australian cents. The
surfwear maker, approached with five takeover or refinancing
proposals since February 2012, said 5 percent stakeholder
Coastal Capital is seeking a board shakeup.  China Minzhong Food Corp., the vegetable producer that had
slumped after allegations by a short-seller, more than doubled
to S$1.12 in Singapore after Indonesian billionaire Anthoni
Salim’s PT Indofood Sukses Makmur, its largest shareholder,
offered S$488 million ($381 million) cash for the rest of the
company. Indofood tumbled 8.5 percent to 5,950 rupiah in
Jakarta.  Everbright Securities Co., which was ordered by China’s
securities regulator to pay a record 523 million  yuan  ($85
million) slumped 8.9 percent to 9.17 yuan in Shanghai after
investors in Guangzhou and Shanghai sued the company.  Everbright roiled China’s markets on Aug. 16 with 23.4
billion yuan of erroneous stock purchase orders and later trades
to offset the mistake, leading to it being barred from most
proprietary trading, lifetime bans from the  securities market 
for four executives and the resignation of the brokerage’s
president.  HTC Corp. (2498) , Taiwan’s biggest smartphone maker, tumbled 16
percent to NT$131 after reporting a 45 percent decline in sales
for August.  To contact the reporter on this story:
