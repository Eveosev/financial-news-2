Mike Napoli hit a grand slam to fuel
a five-run seventh inning and Shane Victorino homered in a four-run eighth to give the  Boston  Red Sox a 12-8 come-from-behind
victory against the New York Yankees.  The Red Sox (86-57), who lead the American League East
division, won their fourth consecutive Major League Baseball
game. The Yankees (75-66) are in fourth place, 10 games behind
Boston, which has won the first two games of a four-game series
at Yankee Stadium.  New York has lost consecutive games when scoring at least
eight runs in each for the first time since September 1949,
according to STATS. The last time it happened with both games at
home was in 1911 against  Cleveland .  Alfonso Soriano homered in the first and Brett Gardner hit
a two-run triple in the fourth as the Yankees took an 8-3 lead.
Andy Pettitte pitched six innings for New York, whose injury-decimated bullpen allowed nine runs in three innings.  Brandon Workman (5-2) got the win for the Red Sox.
Preston Claiborne (0-2) took the loss, allowing Victorinoâ€™s
homer and giving up three runs on three hits in two-thirds of an
inning.  To contact the reporter on this story:
