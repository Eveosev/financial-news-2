Telecom Italia Director Gabriele
Galateri, whose company is seeking to recover from financial
losses and a  stock slide , said the European telecommunication
industry is in need of consolidation.  Galateri’s comments to reporters today in Cernobbio,  Italy ,
came amid uncertainty over the future role of Telecom Italia’s
controlling shareholders. Spain’s  Telefonica SA (TEF)  and three
financial investors own almost 22.5 percent of Milan-based
Telecom Italia through holding company Telco SpA. Their
partnership is up for review this month, when members are
allowed to exercise a right to end the collaboration.  Galateri was asked today if a merger of equals between
Telecom Italia and Telefonica was possible.  “You’re putting many things together, a merger with
Telefonica, a merger of equals,” said Galateri, who is also
chairman of  Assicurazioni Generali SpA (G) , a Telco partner. “The
European market needs consolidation. It’s definitely a desirable
goal. Beyond which, whether it is possible or not possible
depends on many factors. We’ll see.”  Telecom Italia’s stock price has  declined  every year since
2005 and is down 11 percent since Dec. 31. The company  reported 
a 1.77 billion-euro ($2.33 billion) loss in the second quarter
and a 3.55 billion-euro loss in the fourth quarter.  To contact the reporter on this story:
