Rafael Nadal beat Richard Gasquet in
straight sets to reach the men’s final at the U.S. Open and set
up a championship rematch with top-ranked Novak Djokovic.  Nadal, the No. 2 seed, beat Gasquet, seeded No. 8, 6-4, 7-6
(7-1), 6-2, at the National Tennis Center in New York today.  Djokovic defeated ninth-seeded Stanislas Wawrinka of
Switzerland 2-6, 7-6 (7-4), 3-6, 6-3, 6-4 in today’s opening
semifinal, a match that lasted more than four hours.  The championship match in two days will be the third time
in four years that Nadal and Djokovic have played for the title
in the final Grand Slam event of the season. Nadal won in 2010
and Djovokic in 2011.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
