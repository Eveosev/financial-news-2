The Canadian dollar snapped three
weeks of losses on jobs gains that tripled the forecast even as
U.S. employment growth faltered, accelerating a rally than began
as the Bank of  Canada  reiterated that policy is appropriate.  The currency touched its strongest level against its U.S.
counterpart since Aug. 20 as Statistics Canada said yesterday
that the economy added 59,200 positions in August, exceeding the
20,000 forecast in a Bloomberg survey of 22 economists. The
central bank kept its  benchmark  rate at 1 percent for the 24th
consecutive meeting and said slack in the economy will start to
disappear in 2014. Canada Mortgage & Housing Corp. may report
Sept. 10 that work began on 190,000 houses in August, according
to a Bloomberg survey.  Canada’s dollar rallied on “the combination of better-than-expected data in Canada and worse-than-expected data from a
revision perspective in the States,”  Jack Spitz , managing
director of foreign exchange at National Bank of Canada, said by
phone from Toronto. “The Bank of Canada, clearly that was
forward guidance that was as-expected.”  The loonie, as the Canadian dollar is known for the image
of the aquatic bird on the C$1 coin, rose 1.3 percent to
C$1.0405 per U.S. dollar this week in Toronto. The currency
reached C$1.0382 yesterday, the strongest intraday level since
Aug. 20. One loonie buys 96.11 U.S. cents.  Canada’s 10-year benchmark government bonds fell for the
first time in three weeks, with yields rising 16 basis points,
or 0.16 percentage point, to 2.77 percent. The 1.5 percent
security maturing in June 2023 fell $1.23 to C$89.25.  Employment Gains  Part-time  employment  in Canada rose by 41,800 in August,
with full-time jobs rising by 17,400, Statistics Canada said.
Service industry employment increased by 40,600 and goods-producing companies hired 18,600.  “You could argue there was a fair degree of part-time job
creation, but nevertheless jobs being created, and the fact the
participation rate was up and unemployment rate was down
obviously contrasts fairly positively with what we saw south of
the border,”  Jeremy Stretch , head of currency strategy at
Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, said by phone from  London .
“That has provided the Canadian dollar with some impetus.”  While Canada’s dollar gained against the majority of its
most-traded peers this week, it fell against fellow commodity-currencies from  Australia , New Zealand and South Africa.  Aussie, Kiwi  The dollars of Australia and New Zealand gained “on the
back of better than expected data from China and the inference
that the movement in emerging-market currencies have been made
more by a deleveraging aspect in conjunction with rising rates
in the U.S,” National Bank of Canada’s Spitz said. “That the
market had trounced Aussie and kiwi, there is more elasticity,
from a volatility standpoint, in both currencies. It’s not
surprising to see short Aussie positions taken back.”  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. researchers on Sept. 3 boosted
their 2013 growth estimate for  China  to 7.6 percent from 7.4
percent, joining Credit Suisse Group AG, Deutsche Bank AG and
JPMorgan Chase & Co. in raising projections.  Spending by Canadian consumers underpinned by a housing
boom has powered the world’s 11th largest economy since the 2008
global financial crisis. BOC Governor Stephen Poloz says the
expansion needs to shift to business spending from indebted
consumers, a process that policy makers said this week is taking
longer than they predicted.  Home Building  The BOC forecasts third-quarter growth at 3.8 percent in
its July monetary policy report. Gross domestic product grew 1.7
percent in the second quarter.  Work began  on 190,000 Canadian homes at a seasonally
adjusted annual pace last month, compared with 192,900 in July,
Ottawa-based Canada Mortgage & Housing Corp. may report next
week, according to the median of 16 responses in a Bloomberg
News survey.  In the U.S., Canada’s biggest trading partner, the addition
of 169,000 workers last month trailed the 180,000 median
forecast in a Bloomberg survey of 96 economists. Unemployment
fell to 7.3 percent, the lowest since December 2008, as workers
left the labor force.  Yesterday’s payrolls report is the last one Federal Reserve
officials will see before their Sept. 17-18 meeting, at which
they will decide whether to reduce an $85 billion monthly pace
of bond purchases that have bolstered global markets.  ‘Maximum Uncertainty’  The unemployment report may boost currency-market
volatility,  Alan Ruskin , the global head of Group of 10 foreign-exchange strategy at Deutsche Bank AG in New York, wrote in a
note.  “The August employment report is weak enough to seriously
throw into doubt the tapering the market widely expected on
Sept. 18,” Ruskin said. “This is the kind of employment report
that throws the cat among the pigeons, generating maximum
uncertainty for markets.”  JPMorgan Chase & Co.’s G-7 Volatility Index fell to 9.6
percent yesterday, the lowest level since July 24 and at almost
the lowest level since Aug. 19. The JPMorgan gauge priced at 8.3
percent a year ago and has averaged 9.6 percent in 2013.  The Canadian dollar has fallen 3.4 percent in the past year
against nine developed nation currencies tracked by the
Bloomberg Correlation Weighted Indexes. The U.S. dollar has
climbed 2.9 percent.  Futures traders increased bets that the Canadian dollar
 will decline  against the U.S. dollar to the most since June 14,
figures from the Washington-based Commodity Futures Trading
Commission show. The difference in the number of wagers by hedge
funds and other large speculators on a decline in the Canadian
dollar compared with those on a gain, known as net shorts, was
34,639 on Sept. 3, compared with net shorts of 24,959 a week
earlier.  To contact the reporter on this story:
