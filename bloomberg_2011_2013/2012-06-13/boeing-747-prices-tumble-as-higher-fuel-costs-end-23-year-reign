Prices for  Boeing (BA)  Co.  747-400s , the
most popular wide-body plane, are tumbling as carriers rush to
replace what were once their flagship aircraft with newer and
more fuel-efficient models.  Ten-year-old passenger 747-400s are worth a record low $36
million, about 10 percent less than similar aged planes last
year, according to  Ascend Worldwide Ltd. , amid high fuel costs
and a cargo slump that has damped interest in converting
aircraft into freighters. Forty-eight of the 404 humpbacked
passenger 747-400s worldwide have also been placed in storage,
according to the London-based aviation consultancy, as the once
“Queen of the Skies” is shunned for 777s and Airbus SAS A380s.  “There’s not a lot of demand for the 747,” said Paul Sheridan, Ascend’s Hong Kong-based head of risk analysis.
“They’re mostly being broken up for parts.”  The decline in prices contributed to  Singapore Airlines
Ltd. (SIA)  having a surprise  loss  in the quarter ended March after the
sale of the carrier’s last 747-400 raised less than it expected.
Japan Airlines Co. has also stopped using the planes, and
operators including  Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd. (293) , Korean Air
Lines Co. and  Malaysian Airline System Bhd. (MAS)  are following suit
to help counter fuel prices that have jumped about 30 percent in
two years.  “When  oil prices  are high, you want your new airplane,”
Cathay Pacific Chief Executive Officer John Slosar said this
week in Beijing. “The last thing you want to do is hold onto
your older planes.”  The Hong Kong-based airline said last month that it’s
speeding up the retirement of its 21 passenger 747-400s. The
carrier plans to shed nine through early 2014 as it adds more
777-300ERs for long-haul flights. Cathay is also retiring three
-400 freighters this year because of the arrival of new 747-8
cargo planes.  1960s Development  The first four-engine  747-400  was delivered to  Northwest
Airlines  in 1989. The standard version can fly as far as 7,260
nautical miles (13,450 kilometers), carrying 416 passengers in
three classes, according to Boeing’s  website . The Chicago-based
planemaker delivered the last of 694 -400s in 2009. The original
747 was developed in the 1960s.  The passenger version of the newest 747, the -8, entered
service this year. It can fly 467 passengers in three classes as
far as 8,000 nautical miles. The twin-engine 777-330ER, first
delivered in 2004, can carry 365 people as far as 7,930 nautical
miles.  “We’re seeing a lot of airlines understanding that they
need more fuel-efficient planes and that bodes very well for
us,”  Jim Albaugh , the head of Boeing’s commercial-plane
business, said in a Bloomberg TV interview.  Newer aircraft use less fuel because of the development of
more efficient engines and of lightweight materials. The 787 has
a fuselage built from reinforced plastics, compared with the
747’s heavier aluminum shell.  Thai Airways  Thai Airways International Pcl (THAI)  is in the process of selling
four 747-400s and it will begin phasing out the model next year,
outgoing-Chief Executive Officer  Piyasvasti Amranand  said May 31
in Bangkok. The carrier will begin receiving six on-order A380s
this year.  Flying 747-400s now “doesn’t make sense,” Amranand said.
“It’s obvious that with this sort of fuel price that it will
cost you.”  Malaysian Airline System Bhd., which received its first
A380 last month, will consume 1,181 barrels of fuel flying the
494-seat aircraft to  London  from  Kuala Lumpur , according to
Maybank Kim Eng Securities analyst Wong Chew Hann. The carrier’s
359-seat 747-400s use about 999 barrels of fuel on the same
route, he said. Fuel accounts for about a third of airlines’
costs, according to the  International Air Transport Association .  A380 Prestige  The A380, which surpassed the 747-400 as the world’s
largest commercial plane on entering service in 2007, has become
the flagship for carriers including Singapore Air and  Qantas
Airways Ltd. (QAN)  Airlines still reliant on 747-400s are at a
disadvantage in terms of costs and prestige, said Maybank’s
Wong.  “It takes an A380 to beat an A380,” he wrote in a June 8
note.  European carriers, operating in slower growth markets than
Asian airlines, are replacing 747-400s less quickly. British
Airways, the biggest operator, will only retire the last of its
fleet in about 10 years. The carrier has 55 747-400s, according
to Ascend.  “It’s a great aircraft, customers love it,” said  Willie Walsh , chief executive officer of BA’s parent  International
Consolidated Airlines Group SA. (IAG)  “We could replace some of them
with 777-300ERs, which we are doing, but we are not looking to
replace all of them.”  ‘Attractive Aircraft’  BA has also ordered 12 A380s, which will start arriving in
about a year.  Deutsche Lufthansa AG (LHA)  has already begun flying
A380s and it has ordered 747-8s. It will still continue using
747-400s, partly because it owns rather than leases them, said
Chief Executive Officer Christoph Franz.  “We still think it’s an attractive aircraft and we will
use it for quite a number of years,” Franz said. “They are
very competitive aircraft in the market for us.”  Newer and smaller long-haul planes are also allowing
carriers to open new routes that wouldn’t be profitable with the
747-400.  All Nippon Airways Co. (9202) , which will retire its last
seven 747s by March 2016, is starting flights from  Tokyo  to San
Jose and  Seattle  using new 787s. Japan Air is using Dreamliners
to open routes to  Boston  and San Diego.  The move away from larger planes has curtailed sales of the
A380 and the 747-8, according to  Richard Aboulafia , vice
president of the Teal Group, a Fairfax, Virginia forecaster.
Airbus has sold 253 A380s. Boeing has orders for 106 747-8s, of
which only 27 are for commercial passenger operations.  “The market for large aircraft in general is disappearing
fast,” Aboulafia said. “Most of the 747-8 planes are cargo.
There’s just a limited market.”  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
