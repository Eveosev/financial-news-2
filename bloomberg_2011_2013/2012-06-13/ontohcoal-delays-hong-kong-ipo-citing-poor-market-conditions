LontohCoal Ltd. (LONTOZ) , the South African
coal miner that had planned to list in  Hong Kong , is putting its
$1 billion initial public offering on hold after market
conditions deteriorated.  The IPO “will only go ahead when market conditions
improve,” Renita Moonsamy, Hong Kong-based managing director of
unit LontohCoal Asia Ltd., said today in an interview.  LontohCoal joins companies including  China Nonferrous
Mining Corp. (1258) , Graff Diamonds Corp., and China Yongda Automobiles
Services Holdings Ltd. in delaying Hong Kong share sales as
Europe’s credit crisis and China’s slowing economy
crimp demand for new equity. The Bloomberg World Mining Index
has lost 22 percent from its 2012 high in February.  The Sandton, South Africa-based company planned to double
the size of its share sale to as much as $1 billion to develop a
coal operation in  Zimbabwe , Chief Executive Officer Tshepo Kgadima said in an interview in January.  The company is “still very committed to Zimbabwe,”
Moonsamy said today.  LontohCoal has agreed to sales agreements worth $320
million a year with two Chinese state-owned companies, it said
in a  statement  on its website last month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
