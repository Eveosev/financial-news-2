Partner Communications Co. (PTNR) , Israel’s
second-largest mobile-phone provider, slid in U.S. trading on
speculation a deal that would make  Hutchison Whampoa Ltd. (13)  its
largest shareholder won’t be approved.  Shares of Partner slumped 4.7 percent to $4.47 in New York.
The company’s  Tel Aviv-traded (PTNR)  stock retreated 4.6 percent to
17.45 shekels, or the equivalent of $4.51, at the close in
Israel today.  Hutchison, the Hong Kong-based company owned by billionaire
Li Ka-Shing, said June 5 it would pay $125 million for 75
percent of Scailex Corp., which owns a 44.5 percent stake in
Partner. Completion of the deal is subject to regulatory and
other approval and Scailex buying back at least 50 percent of
its bonds, according to Hutchison. Partner said today it intends
to participate in a plan to start a multichannel television
operator that would compete with existing players.  “The stock market is pretty sure the deal is not going to
take place and that’s a bit scary for the future of Partner,”
Eran Jacoby, head of research at DS Securities & Investments
Ltd., said by phone from  Tel Aviv  today. “The TV announcement
isn’t positive because investors don’t think the company has
enough capital to invest in that market.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
