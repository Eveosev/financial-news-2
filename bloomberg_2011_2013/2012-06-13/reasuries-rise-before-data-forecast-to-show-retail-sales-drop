Treasuries rose, snapping a decline
from yesterday, on speculation data today will show U.S. retail
sales fell for the first time in a year, supporting the case for
the  Federal Reserve  to expand stimulus measures.  Demand for the perceived safety of U.S. bonds was bolstered
before Italy sells government notes this week and Greece holds
general elections on June 17 amid concern Europe’s debt crisis
is spreading. The U.S. is scheduled to sell $21 billion of 10-
year securities today in the second of three note auctions this
week totaling $66 billion.  “Demand for Treasuries is likely to remain strong as the
European debt crisis continues and the  U.S. economy  softens,”
said  Kiyoshi Ishigane , a senior strategist at Mitsubishi UFJ
Asset Management Co., which oversees about $70 billion in Tokyo.
“There are increasing expectations for some Fed action.”  The yield on the  10-year note  fell two basis points, or
0.02 percentage point, to 1.64 percent at 9:50 a.m. in  Tokyo ,
according to Bloomberg Bond Trader prices. The 1.75 percent note
due in May 2022 gained 6/32, or $1.88 per $1,000 face amount to
100 31/32. The rate yesterday rose eight basis points.  U.S. retail sales probably declined 0.2 percent in May
after rising 0.1 percent the prior month, according to the
median estimate of economists in a Bloomberg News survey taken
before data are released today.  Italy is scheduled to sell 6.5 billion euros ($8.1 billion)
of 364-day bills today and offer debt maturing in 2015, 2019 and
2020 tomorrow. The  yield  on the nation’s benchmark 10-year
government bond rose to as high as 6.3 percent yesterday,
approaching the 7 percent level that led to bailouts in  Greece ,
Ireland and  Portugal .  -- Editors: Naoto Hosoda, Benjamin Purvis  To contact the reporter on this story:
