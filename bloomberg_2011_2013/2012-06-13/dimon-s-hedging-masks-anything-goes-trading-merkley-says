U.S. Senator  Jeff Merkley , the
Oregon Democrat pushing for tighter restrictions on banks’ bets
with their own money through so-called proprietary trading, said
 JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM)  took too much risk through a strategy the
company described as hedging.  “Portfolio hedging is just a name for saying anything
goes, and we’ll continue proprietary trading,” Merkley said in
an interview today on Bloomberg Television.  JPMorgan Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon is scheduled
to testify today before the Senate Banking Committee to discuss
a loss of more than $2 billion on credit derivatives. Dimon has
said the New York-based bank has the financial strength to
withstand the loss and that regulation such as the so-called
Volcker rule, designed to limit banks’ wagers, could limit
economic growth.  “I want to know whether or not he is determined to
continue pressing for loopholes in the Volcker rule so he can
continue proprietary trading or whether he recognizes that
really is a role for  hedge funds  that shouldn’t be subsidized by
American taxpayers,” Merkley said. “Here is a bank that has
this  enormous amount of money  and instead of making loans to
businesses, they are investing it through London in proprietary
trading.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
