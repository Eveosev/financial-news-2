 U.K. Chancellor of the Exchequer
 George Osborne  criticized the decision by European authorities
to channel funds to Spain’s banks via the government, saying the
decision was “depressing,” the Financial Times reported.  “If you do it via the Spanish sovereign then you are not
going to convince the market the Spanish sovereign is entirely
credible,” Osborne said at a business leaders’ event in London
yesterday, the newspaper reported. “And yet they went down this
route.”  Osborne also said Greece may need to drop the the euro as
its currency before  Germany  decides to fully stand behind the
single currency.  “I ultimately don’t know whether Greece needs to leave the
euro in order for the euro zone to do things necessary to make
their currency survive,” Osborne said. “I just don’t know
whether the German government requires Greek exit to explain to
their public why they need to do certain things like banking
union, euro bonds and things in common with that.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
