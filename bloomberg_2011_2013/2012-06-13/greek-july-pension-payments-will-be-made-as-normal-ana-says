Greek pensions for July will be paid
as normal, Athens News Agency reported, citing comments by
caretaker Labor and Social Security Minister Antonis
Roupakiotis.  The minister said he could not give any assurances over
August pensions because that lies beyond the scope of the
caretaker administration appointed to steer  Greece  to repeat
elections on June 17 after an inconclusive vote last month,
according to the state-run newswire.  Greece needs to find another 260 million euros ($326
million) to cover a deficit in the unemployment benefit fund,
and 1.4 billion euros for pensions, ANA cited Roupakiotis as
saying. Each percentage point increase in unemployment costs
social security funds 450 million euros, he said, according to
ANA.  To contact the reporter on this story:
