Azerbaijan , the third-largest oil
producer in the former  Soviet Union , pumped less crude in the
first five months of the year and produced more natural gas.  The Caspian Sea nation produced 18.5 million metric tons of
marketable oil, down 7.5 percent from a year earlier, the State
Statistics Committee said on its website today, without giving a
reason for the decline. Production of marketable gas grew 8.5
percent to 7.4 billion cubic meters, it said.  State Oil Co. of Azerbaijan earlier attributed lower oil
output to increased safety measures at the BP Plc-led Azeri-
Chirag-Guneshli field after the Gulf of Mexico oil spill.  The value of the production from the Azerbaijan oil and gas
industry slid 5.1 percent in the five months, the committee
said. The country produced 45.6 million tons of oil and 25.8
billion cubic meters of gas last year, down from 50.8 million
tons and 26.3 billion cubic meters of gas a year before.  To contact the reporter on this story:
