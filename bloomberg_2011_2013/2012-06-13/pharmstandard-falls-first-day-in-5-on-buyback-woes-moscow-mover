OAO Pharmstandard (PHST)  snapped four days
of gains on concern minority shareholders won’t be able to
participate in a share buyback of  Russia ’s largest drugmaker.  The stock dropped 1.5 percent to 1,401.10 rubles as of
12:09 p.m. in Moscow. Markets were closed June 11-12 for public
holidays.  Pharmstandard approved a possible purchase of as much as
1.1 billion rubles ($33.7 million) of ordinary shares by its
subsidiary OAO Pharmstandard-Leksredstva during the next 12
months, according to an e-mailed statement June 9.  “It’s unclear who will benefit from this buyback,” Tigran Hovhannisyan, an analyst at Uralsib Capital in Moscow, said by
phone. “Most likely, this is a hidden dividend for the majority
shareholder.”  The purchased shares may be used in merger and acquisition
deals, according to the statement. The company’s shareholders
decided not to pay 2011 dividends on May 25. Augment Investments
Ltd. owns 54 percent of the company, Bloomberg data show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
