Alex Rodriguez  hit his 23rd career
grand slam to tie Lou Gehrig’s Major League Baseball record as
the New York Yankees beat the Atlanta Braves 6-4.  With the Yankees trailing 4-0 and one out in the eighth
inning, Rodriguez hit a full-count pitch by Jonny Venters to
left field at Turner Field in Atlanta last night to wipe out the
Braves’ lead. Rodriguez came to the plate after  Derek Jeter  and
 Curtis Granderson  singled and Mark Teixeira walked.  Robinson Cano then singled before  Nick Swisher  hit a two-
run homer off Cory Gearrin to complete a six-run inning for the
Yankees.  It was Rodriguez’s 10th home run this year and his first
grand slam of the season. The Yankees’ fifth straight win and
their 10th in 12 games gives them sole possession of first place
in the American League East division with a 36-25 record, the
best in the AL.  The Yankees fell behind in the first inning on a three-run
double by Matt Diaz off CC Sabathia (8-3), who got the win after
allowing four runs on 10 hits in seven innings. The Braves’
other run came on a run-scoring groundout by Jason Heyward in
the seventh inning.  Rafael Soriano , who pitched in Atlanta from 2007-09, got
three outs in the ninth to record his 10th save in 11 chances
this season.  Granderson leads the Yankees with 18 home runs, while Cano
and Teixeira have 11 each.  Raul Ibanez  also has 10. Rodriguez
now has 639 home runs, 21 behind Willie Mays for fourth on the
career list.  Venters (3-3) took the loss, the third straight defeat for
the Braves (34-28). The New York Mets defeated Tampa Bay 11-2 to
leave the Rays (35-26) tied with Baltimore a game behind the
Yankees in second place in the AL East.  The Mets (33-29) are one game behind the Braves in third
place in the  National League East . The Washington Nationals lead
the division with a 37-23 record after beating the host Toronto
Blue Jays 4-2 last night.  To contact the reporter on this story:
