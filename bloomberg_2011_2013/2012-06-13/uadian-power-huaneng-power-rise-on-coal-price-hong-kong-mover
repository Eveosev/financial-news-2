Huadian Power International Corp. (1071) 
and  Huaneng Power International Inc. (902)  led gains among Chinese
power producers in  Hong Kong  and Shanghai as coal prices fell.  Huadian Power, the listed unit of  China ’s fourth-largest
power producer, rose to HK$2.11, the highest since Sept. 17,
2010, and traded at HK$2.06 as of 1:34 p.m. in Hong Kong.
Huaneng Power, the listed unit of China’s largest power group,
rose as much as 7.4 percent to 6.36 yuan, the highest since May
18, 2011, in Shanghai. Hong Kong’s benchmark Hang Seng Index
gained 0.3 percent; the Shanghai Composite Index rose 1 percent.  Coal prices at Qinhuangdao, which delivers half the
nation’s seaborne coal, fell to a range of 745  yuan  to 760 yuan
a ton as of June 10, the lowest in almost 20 months, according
to data from the China Coal Transport and Distribution
Association. Stockpiles at the port surged to 8.83 million tons,
the highest level since Nov. 25, 2008, according to the
association’s data. Chinese power producers rely on coal to
generate three-quarters of the nation’s electricity.  “Power generators can immediately benefit from lower coal
prices as many of them are stocking up coal stockpiles for the
summer peak season,” said Shi Yan, a Shanghai-based analyst at
UOB-Kay Hian Ltd.  The National Development and Reform Commission, China’s
economic planner, said most public hearings on electricity
pricing reform have supported the proposed three tiers of
pricing mechanism, according to a  statement  posted to its
official website today.  “The news NDRC will adjust the electricity pricing system
has also been taken positively by investors,” Shi said.  Electricity users will be required to pay a higher price
when their consumption crossed thresholds of different tiers,
according to the draft plan, which NDRC calls “fair” to both
power generators and consumers.  To contact the reporter on this story:
