Switzerland ’s upper house of
Parliament has resolved differences with the lower house on tax
agreements with Germany and the U.K., paving the way for final
approval of the deals this week.  Both chambers will vote on June 15, Marie-Jose Portmann, a
spokesman for the Swiss Parliament in Bern, said in a phone
interview today. The upper house agreed to an amendment,
submitted by a member of the lower house, allowing Switzerland
to conclude tax agreements with all countries, according to a
statement published today on Parliament’s  website .  Switzerland signed accords with Germany and the U.K.
earlier last year in a bid to end a dispute over  tax evasion  by
wealthy Germans and Britons holding cross-border accounts with
Swiss private banks. The agreements involve a one-time payment
on previously undeclared funds and a withholding tax on future
 capital gains  and investment income. The identities of British
and German clients with offshore accounts will remain secret.  German’s opposition Social Democratic Party said that it
will reject the  tax treaty  with Switzerland because the accord
still contains too many loopholes for alleged tax evaders.  To contact the reporter on this story:
