Ukraine will increase exports of
grain in the marketing year that starts on July 1 to almost 26
million metric tons, Interfax-Ukraine reported, citing an
 Agriculture Ministry  forecast.  That compares with 23 million tons in the year ending June
30, the Kiev-based newswire reported. The increase in exports
will be helped by 12.6 million tons of carryover stocks,
according to Interfax.  Shipments of wheat from July 1 will be 8.3 million tons,
including 6.54 million tons of milling wheat, according to
Interfax. Corn exports will be 15 million tons from July 1, the
newswire reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
