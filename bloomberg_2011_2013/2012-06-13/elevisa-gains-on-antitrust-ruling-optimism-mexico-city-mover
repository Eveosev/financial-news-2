Grupo Televisa SAB (TLEVICPO) , the world’s
largest Spanish-language broadcaster, advanced for a second day
on speculation the nation’s antitrust commission will overturn a
January decision blocking an acquisition.  The shares gained 1.3 percent to 54.93 pesos at 2:22 p.m.
in Mexico City trading, pushing the two-day advance to 2.9
percent. A close at that level would mark the biggest two-day
rally since the period ended April 30. The benchmark  IPC Index (MEXBOL) 
of 35 Mexican companies fell 0.4 percent today.  Mexico’s antitrust commission voted June 6 on Televisa’s
appeal of a January decision blocking the company’s acquisition
of a 50 percent stake in Grupo Iusacell SA. The decision hasn’t
been made public. Traders are buying the stock again on optimism
the ruling will be reversed, said Manuel Jimenez, an analyst
with Banorte Ixe Casa de Bolsa who recommends buying the shares.  “The Cofeco’s decision is going to be favorable,” Jimenez
said in a telephone interview from  Mexico  City. “They should
approve it with some conditions.”  The botched acquisition has been a drag on the stock
because Televisa had already purchased convertible Iusacell
bonds at the time when the agency, known as Cofeco, rejected the
stake purchase.  The $1.6 billion transaction must be modified to address
“grave risks” to competition, the antitrust agency said in
Feb. 7 a statement explaining its decision to reject the deal.  To contact the reporter on this story:
