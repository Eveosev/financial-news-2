The  International Finance
Corporation  (IFC), the  World Bank ’s private sector lending arm,
will lend 45 million euros ($56.3 million) to  MK Group d.o.o. , a
Serbian foodmaker, to modernize and expand production.  Part of the long-term financing will also be used to
upgrade meat producer and grain trader Carnex AD, which MK Group
acquired in November, the IFC said in an e-mail today.  The loan agreement, to be signed tomorrow in Belgrade,
should help  Serbia , where agriculture accounts for about a fifth
of economic output, increase its food production and exports,
the lender said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
