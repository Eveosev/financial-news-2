Sweden ’s central bank’s  main lending
rate  will be at 1.5 percent in the next year, according to a
survey of labor market organizations, purchasing managers and
money market participants commissioned by the central bank.  Consumer prices  are estimated to rise 1.5 percent in the
next 12 months, down from a 1.7 percent forecast in the previous
survey published in March, the TNS Sifo Prospera said. Inflation
will be 1.9 percent the following year, below the bank’s 2
percent target, the survey showed.  The Riksbank has cut its benchmark repo rate twice since
December, reaching 1.5 percent, to protect the largest economy
from the fallout of  Europe ’s debt crisis.  The central bank’s main rate is estimated to be at 1.8
percent in two years and rise to 2.5 percent in five years,
according to the survey.  The Swedish  economy  will grow 1.4 percent in the next 12
months and 2 percent the following year, according to the survey
published today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
