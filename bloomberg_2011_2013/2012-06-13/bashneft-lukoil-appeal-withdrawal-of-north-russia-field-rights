OAO Bashneft and OAO Lukoil’s
Bashneft-Polyus venture appealed a decision by  Russia ’s subsoil
agency, Rosnedra, to revoke development rights at the Trebs and
Titov  oilfields  in northern Russia.  Moscow’s Arbitration Court will hear the case on June 28,
according to a posting on its  website . Rosnedra had canceled an
order that allowed Bashneft to transfer the field licenses to
its venture with Lukoil, Bashneft said in a May 22 statement.  Bashneft set up Bashneft-Polyus to develop the licenses and
agreed to sell Lukoil 25 percent of the venture for 4.77 billion
rubles ($146 million) last year. Lukoil agreed to sell 29 wells
at the deposits to the venture for $60 million.  To contact the reporter on this story:
