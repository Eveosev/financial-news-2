Deutsche Lufthansa AG (LHA)  unit Swiss may
be split into two companies, one serving long-haul routes and
the other European traffic, Handelszeitung said in an e-mailed
 report , citing an internal strategy document from the airline.  The new short-haul business might be based outside
 Switzerland  in a European Union country, the newspaper added.  “This is an internal concept paper and absolutely no
decisions have been taken,” Susanne Muehlemann, a spokeswoman
for Swiss, said by telephone from Zurich, adding that the story
amounted to a “misinterpretation” of the document.  To contact the reporter on this story:
