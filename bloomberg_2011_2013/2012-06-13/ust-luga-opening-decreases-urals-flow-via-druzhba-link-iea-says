Ust-Luga,  Russia ’s new port on the
Baltic Sea, has shifted Urals crude flows away from the Druzhba
export pipeline as seaborne routes have proved more profitable,
the  International Energy Agency  said.  Exporters reduced supplies to  Poland , the  Czech Republic ,
Slovakia,  Germany  and Hungary after the price of Urals delivered
through Russian pipeline operator OAO Transneft’s Druzhba link
“collapsed” in April to $3 a barrel less than seaborne exports
to northwest  Europe , the Paris-based energy adviser said today
in its monthly oil market report.  “The extra flexibility in the Transneft system which Ust-
Luga affords appears to have been utilized to fulfill
incremental demand and allow producers to orient their exports
toward the most profitable outlets,” the IEA said.  Russian oil producers may continue to favor exports via
tanker given sanctions on  Iran , the agency said.  The Ust-Luga crude terminal opened in March and is the
receiving point of Transneft’s 600,000 barrel-a-day Baltic
Pipeline System-2, which bypasses transit nations Belarus and
Ukraine.  To contact the reporter on this story:
