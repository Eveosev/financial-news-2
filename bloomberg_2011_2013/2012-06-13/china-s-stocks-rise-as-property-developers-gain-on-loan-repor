China’s stocks  rose, driving the
benchmark index to its biggest gain in a month, on speculation
the government will ease monetary policy and increase spending
for infrastructure to stem the slowdown in the economy.  Sany Heavy Industry Co. (600031)  and Zoomlion Heavy Industry Science
& Technology Co. led an advance among machinery makers after the
21st Century Business Herald reported  China  may relax rules on
lending to local government financing vehicles. China Life
Insurance Co. and  Ping An Insurance Group Co. (2318)  gained more than 6
percent on a report that regulators will allow insurers to widen
the scope of their investments.  Huaneng Power International Inc. (600011) 
jumped to a one-month high on prospects falling coal prices will
reduce the cost of generating power.  “Policy easing will go on throughout the year,” said  Li Jun , a strategist at Central China Securities Co. in Shanghai.
“Liquidity is improving, which will help boost valuations.”  The  Shanghai Composite Index (SHCOMP)  gained 29.13 points, or 1.3
percent, to 2,318.92 at the close, the most since May 17. The
30-day  volatility  was at 15.37, compared with this year’s
average of 18.59. The  CSI 300 Index (SHSZ300)  advanced 1.6 percent to
2,580.64. The  Bloomberg China-US 55 Index (CH55BN) , the measure of the
most-traded U.S.-listed Chinese companies, rose 1.4 percent.  Expectations that the government will increase spending on
infrastructure projects and ease monetary policies have pushed
the Shanghai index up 5.4 percent this year. The central bank
cut deposit and lending rates for the first time since 2008 last
week and reduced the reserve-requirement ratio three times
since November. Charlene Chu, Beijing-based senior director of
financial institutions at  Fitch Ratings , said in a Bloomberg
Television interview that she expects more reserve-ratio cuts.  Construction Stocks  Companies in the index posted profit growth of 14 percent
on average last year, compared with an increase of 38 percent in
the previous year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
Stocks in the Shanghai measure are valued at 10.1 times
estimated earnings, compared with the five-year average of 17.8,
Bloomberg weekly  data  showed.  Sany Heavy, the biggest machinery maker, gained 1.4 percent
to 14.92  yuan . Zoomlion, the second-biggest maker of
construction equipment, added 1.3 percent to 11.04 yuan.  XCMG
Construction Machinery Co. (000425) , China’s biggest crane maker, climbed
1.4 percent to 14.91 yuan.  Banks may be allowed to increase the proportion of their
outstanding capital that can be lent to railway and road
construction projects, the 21st Century Business Herald reported
today. Some local government financing vehicles may be allowed
to borrow again “appropriately,” according to the newspaper.  China Life, the nation’s biggest insurer, jumped 7.2
percent to 17.88 yuan, after the China Securities Journal
reported a plan by regulators to ease infrastructure
investments.  Insurers’ Investment Scope  The government may also allow insurance companies to invest
in stock index futures, bond futures and overseas depository
receipts, the Shanghai Securities News reported yesterday,
citing an unidentified person. These changes may boost insurers’
investment returns while meeting their requirements to maintain
long-term asset allocations, said Xie Jiyong, an analyst at
Capital Securities Corp. in Shanghai, in a phone interview
today.  Ping An, the second largest, climbed 6.5 percent to 45.28
yuan.  New China Life Insurance Co. (601336) , the third biggest, surged by
the 10 percent daily limit, to 34.49 yuan. Over the past week,
UBS AG, Credit Suisse Group AG, Deutsche Bank AG and China
International Capital Corp. have recommended investors buy
insurers after the central bank cut  interest rates .  Power Producers  SAIC Motor Co. (600104) , China’s largest carmaker, gained 1.9
percent to 14.93 yuan. Great Wall Motor Co., China’s biggest
pickup truck maker, rose 3.7 percent to 17.73 yuan. The Ministry
of Finance announced trade-in subsidies for the replacement of
some commercial vehicles, with as much as 18,000 yuan offered.  A measure of utility stocks in the CSI 300 advanced 2.9
percent today, the biggest gain among the 10 industry groups.
Huaneng Power, the listed unit of China’s largest power group,
jumped 5.7 percent to 6.26 yuan. Datang International Power
Generation Co., a unit of China’s second-biggest electricity
producer, surged 7.8 percent to 5.78 yuan.  Huadian Power
International Corp. (600027) , the listed unit of China’s fourth-largest
power producer, gained 7.3 percent to 3.82 yuan.  Chinese power producers rely on coal to generate three-
quarters of the nation’s electricity. China’s benchmark price
for power-station coal at the port of Qinhuangdao fell to the
lowest in almost 20 months last week as stockpiles surged to the
highest level since November 2008, according to data from the
China Coal Transport and Distribution Association.  Sanford C. Bernstein cut the 2012 average price forecast
for coal by 2 percent to 735 yuan a metric and the 2013 price
estimate by 1.5 percent to 665 yuan a ton, citing rising coal
production, higher inventories, “weak” power consumption, lack
of fiscal stimulus and cheaper imports.  --Zhang Shidong. With assistance from Billy Chan in  Hong Kong .
