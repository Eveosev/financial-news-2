Taiwan’s 10-year government bond
yields were near a 20-month low ahead of this weekend’s Greek
elections that may determine whether the country will stay in
the euro. The local dollar was little changed.  The yield on the 1.25 percent notes due March 2022 was at
1.186 percent in Taipei, compared with 1.180 percent yesterday,
according to Gretai Securities Market. Benchmark rates reached
1.173 percent on June 8, the lowest level since October 2010,
data compiled by Bloomberg show.  “Traders are trying not to amass large positions as all
eyes are on the Greek election,” said  Albert Lee , a Taipei-
based fixed-income trader at Cathay United Bank Co. “Yields are
going to stay at a relatively low level.”  ING Financial Markets cut its year-end forecast for the
yield to 1.18 percent from 1.28 percent yesterday, citing a
slowing economy and “mildly deflationary” pressure. A
government report on June 20 may show the island’s export orders
fell for a third month in May, according to the median estimate
of economists in a Bloomberg survey.  Global funds sold $457 million more local stocks than they
bought this month, exchange data show.  Greece  will vote June 17 on whether to back the Syriza
party, led by Alexis Tsipras, who wants to renegotiate bailout
terms.  Taiwan ’s dollar traded at NT$29.98 against its U.S.
counterpart, compared with NT$29.991 yesterday, according to
Taipei Forex Inc. One-month implied volatility, a measure of
exchange-rate swings used to price options, rose 10 basis points
to 5.51 percent.  The  overnight interbank lending rate  was steady at 0.511
percent, according to a weighted average compiled by the Taiwan
Interbank Money Center.  To contact the reporter on this story:
