Germany ’s wheat harvest, the
European Union’s second-biggest, may slide 6.2 percent, more
than predicted a month ago on greater-than-expected winter
damage, farm organization Deutscher Raiffeisenverband e.V. said.  Production is forecast to fall to 21.4 million metric tons
from 22.8 million tons after winter kill caused by freezing
weather cut the growing area, the Berlin-based farm group wrote
in an e-mailed  report  today.  Germany, France and  Poland  suffered wheat-area losses in
February as temperatures dropped below -18 degrees Celsius (-0.4
degrees Fahrenheit). That’s pushed the price of Paris-traded
milling wheat above Chicago futures.  “The expected harvest amount will mathematically only just
cover domestic consumption, so import requirements will rise,”
DRV head Henning Ehlers was cited as saying.  The winter wheat area in Germany fell 9.5 percent to 2.87
million hectares (7.1 million acres), more than the 7.3 percent
decline in planting estimated in May, according to the DRV.
 France  is the EU’s largest wheat grower.  German barley production is expected to rise 3.2 percent to
9.01 million tons from 8.73 million tons in 2011. The group had
previously forecast production would advance 6.3 percent.  The rapeseed harvest may increase 18 percent to 4.52
million tons from 3.83 million tons a year earlier, DRV said.
The outlook was raised from a 12 percent gain predicted in May
as the DRV lifted estimates for yields and planted area.  To contact the reporter on this story:
