Sales of shipping fuel rose to the
highest level in at least 17 months in  Singapore , the world’s
biggest market for so-called bunker, as the cost of the fuel
fell, according to the city’s Maritime and  Port Authority .  Bunker sales increased 7 percent from April to 3.99 million
metric tons in May, the highest since at least December 2010,
data released today on the authority website showed.  The 380-centistoke bunker spot cargo price in Singapore has
slumped 20 percent since rising in February to $745 a ton, the
highest in more than three years, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. It was at $596.50 a ton yesterday. Bunker at Fujairah
in the  United Arab Emirates  cost $7 a ton more than Singapore
prices as of yesterday, according to Bloomberg data.  To contact the reporter on this story:
