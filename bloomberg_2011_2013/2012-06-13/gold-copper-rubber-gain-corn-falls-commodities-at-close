The Standard & Poor’s GSCI  gauge  of
24 commodities fell 0.1 percent to 580.33 at 4:47 p.m. Singapore
time. The UBS Bloomberg CMCI  index  of 26 raw materials rose 0.04
percent to 1429.697.  CRUDE OIL  Oil fluctuated in  New York  amid speculation the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries will keep output
quotas unchanged even after a slide in prices.  Futures were little changed after dropping as much as 0.8
percent. OPEC, which meets in Vienna tomorrow, said global oil
markets remain well-supplied even after its output fell in May
for the first time in eight months. A U.S. government report
today will show crude stockpiles shrank last week, according to
a Bloomberg News survey. The industry-funded American Petroleum
Institute yesterday said inventories rose 1.6 million barrels.  NATURAL GAS  Natural gas futures dropped after rising from a six-week
low yesterday as a U.S. government report showed gas supplies
will increase in 2012 from last year.  Gas dropped as much as 1.3 percent after increasing 0.6
percent yesterday. U.S. marketed production will average 68.47
billion cubic feet a day this year, up 3.4 percent from 2011’s
record of 66.22 billion, the Energy Department reported in its
Short-Term Energy Outlook. Inventories will reach a record high
in October of 4.015 trillion cubic feet, 2 percent below last
month’s projection of 4.096 trillion, the agency said.  OIL PRODUCTS  Naphtha swaps for July fell $10.50, or 1.4 percent, to
$739.50 a ton, PVM data showed.  Japan  naphtha’s premium to
London-traded Brent crude futures declined $8.99 to $9.15 a ton.  Gasoil was at $15.63 a barrel more than Dubai crude, a gain
of 42 cents, or 2.8 percent, and the highest since June 8, the
PVM data showed. Singapore gasoil swaps for July fell 10 cents
to $109.95 a barrel.  Jet fuel traded at a premium of 95 cents a barrel to gasoil,
up 10 cents from yesterday. This spread, also known as the
regrade, is 20 cents higher than a week earlier.  PRECIOUS METALS  Gold was seen gaining for a fourth day in London as the  U.S.
dollar  weakened, boosting demand for bullion as an alternative
investment.  Gold for immediate delivery gained 0.2 percent to $1,613.29
an ounce by 9:26 a.m. in  London  after falling as much as 0.2
percent earlier today. August-delivery bullion was little
changed at $1,614.40 an ounce on the Comex in New York.  BASE METALS  Copper gained for the second time in three days on better-
than-expected Japan’s machinery orders and after the  European
Central Bank  endorsed a plan to gird the region against debt
contagion.  GRAINS, OILSEEDS, SOFT COMMODITIES  Wheat advanced on speculation global production may be
smaller than estimated by the U.S. government after  Australia ,
the world’s second-biggest shipper, cut its harvest forecast.
Corn declined.  The July delivery contract gained as much as 0.6 percent to
$6.195 bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade after losing 2.3
percent yesterday. It traded at $6.1825 at 1:47 p.m. in
 Singapore . Futures have tumbled 20 percent in the past year as
global output recovered from a three-year low in 2010-2011.  December-delivery corn fell as much as 0.2 percent to
$5.1825 a bushel before trading at $5.2175. Soybeans for
November delivery were little changed at $13.3575 a bushel,
after falling as much as 0.4 percent.  Rubber rebounded from the biggest loss in a week on
speculation that policy makers will step up measures to combat
the debt crisis and as heavy rains in  Thailand , the largest
producer, cut supplies.  The November-delivery contract rose as much as 1.8 percent
to 243.3 yen a kilogram ($3,055 a metric ton), before settling
at 242.6 yen on the Tokyo Commodity Exchange. Futures fell as
much as 3.7 percent yesterday, the most since June 6.  Palm oil  dropped for a second day as concerns deepened over
 Europe ’s economic crisis ahead of weekend elections in  Greece ,
damping demand for commodities.  To contact the reporter on this story:
