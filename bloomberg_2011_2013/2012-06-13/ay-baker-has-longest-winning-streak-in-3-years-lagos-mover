May & Baker of Nigeria Plc , the
nation’s second-biggest pharmaceuticals maker by market value,
had the longest series of gains in three years as it prepares to
start vaccine production through a government joint venture.  The stock climbed 4.6 percent to 2.04 naira by the close in
Lagos, an 11th day of advances and the longest winning streak
since May 2009.  May & Baker’s Bio Vaccines Nigeria Ltd. joint venture
company, formed with the government in 2007, is set to start
production, and the output “will mean a great fortune for the
company,” Chief Executive Officer Nnamdi Okafor said in a phone
interview today. The company is also applying for a “soft
loan” from its chairman, former army general Theophilus Danjuma, Okafor said, adding that the amount is still being
decided.  “The money will serve as working capital that will help
the company meet its immediate needs for the manufacture of some
specialized drugs for the Nigerian government,” Raheem Mohammed, chief executive officer of Lagos-based Kundila Finance
Ltd., said by phone today. “The company has good prospects and
that’s why investors are buying it.”  May & Baker’s shares have risen 2.5 percent this year,
compared with a 2.3 percent gain in the Nigerian Stock Exchange
All-Share Index in the same period.  To contact the reporter on this story:
