Falling coal consumption in the U.S.
last year failed to stem the pace of growth in the fuel’s use
globally, which was  driven by China , Australia, Ukraine and
 South Korea , according to  BP Plc. (BP/)   Coal represented 30 percent of global energy consumption,
the highest since 1969, the oil producer said today in its
annual Statistical Review of World Energy.  Global use rose 5.4 percent in 2011, similar to the
downgraded 5.5 percent pace in 2010, BP said. U.S. consumption
dropped more than any other nation, declining 24.2 million
metric tons of oil equivalent, or 4.6 percent, to 501.9 million
tons.  China ’s use surged 9.7 percent to 1.84 billion tons.  The 2.5 percent growth in global primary energy consumption
was caused by increases in emerging economies, BP said. China
accounted for 71 percent of growth last year. Use in
Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development nations
declined 2.5 percent, led by a 5 percent drop in  Japan . The data
suggests that growth in global CO2 emissions from energy use
continued in 2011, but at a slower pace than in 2010, BP said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
