German bonds declined, with 30-year
yields posting the biggest two-day increase since 2009, as
 Denmark ’s decision to ease liability rules for pension funds
damped demand for longer-maturity fixed-income assets.  Germany’s borrowing costs increased at an auction amid
speculation the country will have to do more to tackle  Europe ’s
debt crisis after  Spanish securities  slumped yesterday. Italian
notes fell as the nation paid the most this year at a sale of
one-year bills today. Danish and Swedish debt tumbled and
 interest-rate swaps  slid as Denmark joined other  Nordic
countries  and the Netherlands in amending pension rules.  “In the past, when yields went down, the pension funds had
to hedge by buying long-term bonds,” said Allan von Mehren, a
fixed-income strategist at  Danske Bank A/S (DANSKE)  in Copenhagen. “Now
that’s changed, a lot of funds are selling the long-end of the
curve, particularly in  Germany .”  Germany’s  30-year yield  rose 13 basis points, or 0.13
percentage point, to 2.19 percent at 4:53 p.m. London time after
climbing 15 basis points yesterday. The two-day increase is the
biggest since January 2009. The 2.5 percent bond maturing in
July 2044 fell 3.2, or 32 euros per 1,000-euro ($1,260) face
amount, to 107.17.  The 10-year yield advanced seven basis points to 1.49
percent, having risen from a record low 1.127 percent on June 1.  Pension Liabilities  Denmark’s government will allow pension funds and life
insurers to raise the discount rate they use to calculate their
liabilities, the Business and Growth Ministry in Copenhagen said
yesterday. When Sweden’s regulator pushed through a similar
change in pension rules on June 7, Swedish  10-year yields  surged
more than 30 basis points because it reduced the incentive to
buy longer-dated debt to balance liabilities.  Danish pension funds and life insurance companies affected
by the rules hold assets of 2.1 trillion kroner ($356 billion),
according to figures from the Financial Supervisory Authority.  The Finnish parliament voted today to allow pension funds
to take more risk in their investments. The law will be
implemented from the start of 2013. The Dutch government
proposed on May 31 a way to make pension funds less reliant on
daily  interest rates .  Denmark’s  10-year yield  rose two basis points to 1.32
percent. The rate on 30-year swaps in euros climbed 14 basis
points to 2.24 percent, widening the difference in yield, with
10-year swaps by 12 basis points to 30 basis points. The swaps
allow investors to bet on future borrowing costs.  Swedish Bonds  Sweden’s 10-year yield climbed eight basis points to 1.59
percent as the debt office raised its estimate for bond sales
this year. The nation also sold 2.5 billion kronor ($356
million) of debt due June 2022 and March 2039.  Volatility on Swedish bonds was the highest in developed
markets, followed by Germany and  Italy , according to measures of
10-year debt, the spread between two- and 10-year securities and
credit-default swaps.  Bunds fell yesterday and  Spain ’s 10-year bond yield surged
to a  euro-era record  after  Fitch Ratings  said European countries
may face downgrades because policy makers are failing to bring
the sovereign debt crisis under control.  German  Chancellor Angela Merkel  said yesterday that burden
sharing and ceding control over budgets “go hand in hand.”  “There’s the notion in the market that something is going
to happen that moves Europe closer together and Germany will
have to take more responsibility and put money on the table,”
said  Peter Schaffrik , head of European interest-rate strategy at
Royal Bank of  Canada  on London. “I don’t expect this to be the
end of the low-yield environment, but they could climb to 1.75
percent,” he said, referring to the yield on 10-year bunds.  German Sales  Germany sold 4 billion euros of 10-year bunds at an average
yield of 1.52 percent today, up from a record-low 1.47 percent
at the previous auction on May 16. The country also sold
inflation-linked debt.  Spain’s 10-year yield advanced five basis points to 6.75
percent after rising to a euro-era high 6.83 percent yesterday.  Two-year Italian yields rose 19 basis points to 4.72
percent. The nation sold 6.5 billion euros of one-year bills at
3.97 percent, up from 2.34 percent at the previous auction on
May 11. Investors bid for 1.73 times the amount offered, down
from 1.79 times last month.  Ten-year bund futures fell for a second day, dropping 0.2
percent to 141.75.  “The technical situation in the daily chart remains under
pressure, but this should not be enough to prompt any
significant corrections,” analysts Viola Julien and Ralf Umlauf
at Helaba Landesbank Hessen-Thueringen in  Frankfurt  wrote in a
note to investors.  The bund future should return to a range of between 143.03
and 144.97, they wrote.  German debt has returned 3.1 percent this year, according
to indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the European Federation of
Financial Analysts Societies. Spanish securities lost 5.4
percent, and Italian bonds rose 5.9 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
