U.S. Gulf Coast oil premiums
strengthened after the premium for Brent over West Texas
Intermediate widened.  Brent crude’s premium to WTI, based on July futures prices,
widened 53 cents to $14.25 a barrel at 1:33 p.m. in  New York .
When Brent rises versus WTI, it typically strengthens the value
of low-sulfur U.S. grades that compete with West African oil
priced against the European benchmark.  Light Louisiana Sweet’s premium was unchanged at $11.75 a
barrel at 2:07 p.m. in New York, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. Heavy Louisiana Sweet’s premium increased 50 cents to
$12.75.  Poseidon’s premium to West Texas Intermediate added 60
cents to $8 a barrel. Southern Green Canyon’s premium also
increased $1 to $7.50.  Mars Blend’s premium widened 55 cents to $9.30 a barrel.
The premium for  Thunder Horse , a sour crude with lower sulfur
content than Mars, Poseidon and Southern Green Canyon, added 20
cents to $11.15 a barrel.  Western Canada Select’s discount to WTI narrowed 75 cents
to $23.60 a barrel. Syncrude’s discount narrowed 55 cents to
$5.75. Bakken oil’s discount narrowed $1.50 a barrel to $9.  To contact the reporter on this story:
