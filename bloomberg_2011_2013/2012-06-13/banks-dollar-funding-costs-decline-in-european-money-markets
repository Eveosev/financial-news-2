The cost for European banks to
borrow in dollars declined, according to a money-markets
indicator.  The three-month cross-currency  basis swap , the rate banks
pay to convert euro interest payments into dollars, was 54 basis
points below the euro interbank offered rate at 9:20 a.m. in
London, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. That’s from
minus 56 basis points yesterday and compares with minus 59 on
June 4, which was the most expensive in three months.  The one-year basis swap was unchanged at 58 basis points
below Euribor. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  Prices in the forward market for three-month Euribor
relative to overnight indexed swaps -- known as the FRA/OIS
spread -- were little changed at 35.5 basis points.  The Euribor/OIS spread widened to 38 basis points from 37
yesterday. The measure has ranged from 38 basis points to 42
basis points since the end of March.  Lenders cut  overnight deposits  at the Frankfurt-based
European Central Bank yesterday, placing 798 billion euros ($999
billion) from 787 billion euros the day before.  To contact the reporter on this story:
