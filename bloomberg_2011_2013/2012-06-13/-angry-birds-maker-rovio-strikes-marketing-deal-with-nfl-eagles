Rovio Entertainment Oy, creator of
the “Angry Birds” mobile phone game, signed a marketing
partnership with the National Football League’s Philadelphia
Eagles.  It’s the first team sports global partnership for Espoo,
Finland-based Rovio, according to a statement on the team’s
website, where an animated video shows Eagles coach  Andy Reid 
introducing the game’s signature birds at a news conference.  Details of the partnership weren’t disclosed.  Rovio also sells “Angry Birds” merchandise such as
stuffed toys and mugs through its online store and retail
outlets. Rovio said last month that it had reached 1 billion
“Angry Birds” downloads.  To contact the reporter on this story:
