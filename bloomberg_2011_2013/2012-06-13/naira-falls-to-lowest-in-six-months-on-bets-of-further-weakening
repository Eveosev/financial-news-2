The naira retreated as speculation
 Nigeria ’s currency would weaken further offset the biggest sale
of dollars in four months. Ghana’s cedi appreciated.  The currency of Africa’s top oil producer fell as much as
0.9 percent to 164.20 per dollar in the  interbank market , its
weakest since Dec. 27 before trading 0.1 percent lower at
162.915 by 3:50 p.m. in Lagos, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  “The market is witnessing higher dollar demand, including
those from dealers increasing their position in anticipation
that the currency may decline further,” Sewa Wusu, currency
analyst at Lagos-based Sterling Capital Ltd., said by phone.  The naira pared losses after Nigeria sold $400 million at a
foreign-currency auction today, the most since Feb. 8 sales, at
155.90 per dollar, the Abuja-based  Central Bank of Nigeria  said
today in an e-mailed statement. The regulator sells the U.S.
currency at auctions and direct to lenders at interbank trading
to stabilize the naira.  Increased dollar sales by the central bank, “have
certainly helped the naira,”  Leon Myburgh  and Coura Fall,
Africa strategists at Citigroup Inc. in Johannesburg, wrote in
an e-mailed note to clients today. The weakening of the naira
“will be reduced in coming weeks with support from the central
bank.”  The yield on Nigeria’s domestic bonds due 2015 rose one
basis point to 15.71 percent, according to the June 12 data on
the Financial Markets Dealers Association website. Yields on the
nation’s $500 million of Eurobonds due 2021 fell two basis
points to 5.523 percent.  Ghana ’s cedi appreciated 0.2 percent to 1.9225 per dollar,
in Accra, the capital.  To contact the reporter on this story:
