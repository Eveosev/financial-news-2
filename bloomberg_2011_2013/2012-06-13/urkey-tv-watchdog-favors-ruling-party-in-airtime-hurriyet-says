Turkey ’s radio and television
watchdog has failed to ensure fairness in elections by allowing
television broadcasts to favor politicians from Prime Minister
 Recep Tayyip Erdogan ’s ruling party with airtime,  Hurriyet said .  The watchdog, known as RTUK, is obligated to audit
television channels to ensure fairness among channels handing
pre-electoral airtime to politicians and has neglected its
duties to do so, according to a report by RTUK member Hulya Alp
and cited by columnist Yalcin Dogan. Alp has filed a court case
against her organization, according to Hurriyet.  One channel provided six hours and 22 minutes of airtime to
ruling party candidates before last year’s elections, while
providing two minutes of airtime to the opposition, Hurriyet
cited Alp’s report as saying. Another gave eight hours and 41
minutes of coverage to the governing party versus nine minutes
of coverage to the main opposition party, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
