Kazakhstan plans to raise the amount
of gold it holds as part of its international reserves to 20
percent from 15 percent.  The central bank is buying 24.5 metric tons of gold this
year, Bisengaly Tadzhiyakov, deputy chairman of the country’s
central bank, told reporters today in the capital, Astana. Its
98.2 tons held by April made Kazakhstan the 35th largest  official
sector  owner of gold, between Poland and  Australia , according to
the World Gold Council, citing International Monetary Fund data.  Kazakhstan’s gold holdings expanded by 16.2 tons this year
through April, IMF data show. Central banks added 456.4 tons
last year, the most in almost five decades, and will buy as much
as 400 tons this year, the London-based World Gold Council says.  The banks are expanding reserves after the metal climbed
the past 11 years and  holdings  in exchange-traded products are
about 1 percent below March’s all-time high. Investors have
2,386.717 tons in ETPs, exceeding official reserves in all but
the U.S.,  Germany , the IMF, Italy and  France . Gold makes up more
than 70 percent of their reserves, except for the IMF, according
to the World Gold Council.  To contact the reporter on this story:
