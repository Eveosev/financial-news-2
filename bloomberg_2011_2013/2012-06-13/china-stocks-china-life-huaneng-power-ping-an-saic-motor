to ease infrastructure investments. The government may allow
insurers to invest in stock index futures, bond futures and
overseas depository receipts, the  Shanghai  Securities News
reported yesterday, citing an unidentified person. These changes
may boost insurers’ investment returns while meeting their
requirements to maintain long-term asset allocations, said Xie Jiyong, an analyst at Capital Securities Corp. in Shanghai, in a
phone interview today.  --Zhang Shidong. Editor: Allen Wan  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
