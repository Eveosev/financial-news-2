Kenya ’s shilling strengthened for
the first time in four days as the country’s central bank
extended its policy of tighter  money supply .  The currency of  East Africa ’s biggest economy appreciated
as much as 0.5 percent and traded 0.4 percent stronger at 85.10
by 1:29 p.m, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Kenya’s central bank accepted 3.4 billion shillings in bids
for term auction deposits at 18 percent, an official, who
declined to be named in line with policy, said by phone from
Nairobi, the capital. The bank has mopped up a total of 20.6
billion shillings from June 6, when it started selling TADs,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The central bank introduced “longer tenor term auction
deposits as an additional instrument for liquidity management,”
it said in its monetary policy committee statement June 5.  Term-auction deposits in Kenya are different from
 repurchase agreements  as their maturity is longer -- 14, 21 and
28 days -- and are paid back with interest rather than being
sold at a discounted yield, according to a research note e-
mailed yesterday from Nairobi-based Sterling Capital Ltd.  The central bank accepted 100 million shillings of bids at
its auction for seven-day repurchase agreements, carrying a
weighted average yield of 17.5 percent, the central bank
official said.  Tanzania’s shilling strengthened 0.1 percent to 1,585 per
dollar, while the Ugandan shilling weakened 0.2 percent to 2,490
per dollar.  To contact the reporter on this story:
