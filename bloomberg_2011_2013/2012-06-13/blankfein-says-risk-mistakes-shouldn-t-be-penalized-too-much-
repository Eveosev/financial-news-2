Lloyd C. Blankfein, chairman and
chief executive officer of  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) , said
mistakes in risk judgment shouldn’t be penalized “too much.”  “If you put too much penalty on risk judgment, what kind
of world are you going to have?” Blankfein, 57, said at the
Chicago Club, where he was participating in a discussion with
Motorola Solutions Inc. Chairman and CEO Greg Brown. “If you’re
getting pounded and being made to ask questions, what kind of
economic system do we have?”  Goldman Sachs, the fifth-largest U.S. bank by assets,
competes with  JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) , the biggest, in  investment
banking , trading and asset management. Jamie Dimon, the chairman
and CEO of JPMorgan, is scheduled to testify to a Senate
committee today about how his bank lost money on derivatives
trades. In a prepared statement released yesterday, Dimon in
part blames risk-management failures for the loss.  “Risk management isn’t about getting risk right all the
time,” Blankfein said. “It’s about trying to get risk right
all the time.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
