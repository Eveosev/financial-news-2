Sudan  raised public-transport prices
by as much as 35 percent in Khartoum state amid plans by the
government to lift subsidies on gasoline and fuel oil, the Bus
Drivers Association said.  “The new measure entails no further increase will be
applied if the government decides to remove oil subsidies,” Diab
Qesm el-Sayed Awad said by phone from Khartoum, the capital,
today.  Sudan’s  Finance Ministry  is expected to announce this week
steps to increase revenue and help narrow a $2.4 billion  budget
deficit  caused by the loss of oil income since the secession of
South Sudan. The measures may include lifting fuel subsidies,
raising taxes and customs duties for luxury products, and
increasing fees for travellers and air tickets.  Sudan lost three-quarters of the formerly united country’s
oil production when  South Sudan  gained independence in July.
Negotiations since then have failed to yield an agreement on how
much the landlocked south should pay to use a pipeline and
processing facilities in Sudan.  Sudanese inflation accelerated to 30.4 percent in May from
28.6 percent in April, the country’s statistics agency said on
June 6.  To contact the reporter on this story:
