France ’s inflation rate declined for
a third month in May, helped by lower energy prices as economic
growth slowed.  Consumer prices  rose 2.3 percent from a year earlier based
on European Union methodology, compared with a 2.4 percent
increase in April, the Paris-based national statistics office,
Insee, said today. Economists forecast a 2.3 percent gain, the
median of 15 estimates in a Bloomberg News survey showed.  A 26 percent drop in London crude oil prices this year is
combining with slowing growth to ease price pressure on
households. Energy prices fell 1.5 percent in May from April,
with oil products dropping 2.5 percent.  “The price of energy and transport services and
communications is falling,” Insee said. “Food prices are up.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
