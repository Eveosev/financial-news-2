The Consumer Financial Protection
Bureau is asking state attorneys general, schools and advocacy
groups to share information about complaints over private
 student loans .  The federal agency has been collecting information about
private student loans, which don’t have the same protections as
federal loans such as deferment and income-based repayment. It
published almost 2,000 complaints today  on its website  from
borrowers, many telling tales of hardship after amassing
$100,000 in debt.  “One theme clearly rose to the top,” wrote Rohit Chopra,
the CFPB’s student-loan ombudsman. “Many private student-loan
borrowers expressed confusion and frustration when paying back
their loans, especially when trying to get on an affordable
payment plan.”  Unlike the federal student-loan program, which lets
consumers borrow at fixed rates directly from the government,
the loans from at least 30 banks and other private lenders
feature mostly variable rates that can be more than twice what
some people pay in the federal program.  The consumer bureau’s Web posting also included comments
from lenders including  Sallie Mae (SLM)  and  Discover Financial
Services. (DFS)   The CFPB was created by the 2010 Dodd-Frank Act to help
consumers understand financial products including student loans,
mortgages and credit cards. Earlier this year, the agency
estimated that outstanding educational debt is about $1
trillion.  The bureau is expected to issue a private loan report,
mandated by Dodd-Frank, next month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
