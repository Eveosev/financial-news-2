An judge in  Argentina â€™s Neuquen
province ruled that the tax agency, which is in charge of
authorizing foreign currency purchases, must allow a plaintiff
to buy $125,000,  La Manana  said in its online edition.  Federal Judge Carolina Pandolfi today will order the agency
to authorize the purchase by the person whose earlier request
for the dollars to buy a property had been rejected, the
Neuquen-based paper said, without explaining how it obtained the
information.  To contact the reporter on this story:
