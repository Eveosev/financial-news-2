News Corp. (NWSA)  Chairman  Rupert Murdoch 
said the policies put in place by Prime Minister Mario Monti’s
government are “encouraging” for companies willing to invest
in Italy.  “The Italian government is working on building new growth
by balancing austerity and cuts with strategic investments,”
Murdoch said at an event in Rome today, according to the e-
mailed text of his speech. “Those actions, together with strong
political leadership, can send a clear message to international
markets.”  Murdoch also said that Italian lawmakers should swiftly
approve the government’s overhaul of the labor market rules and
other measures aimed at enhancing the country’s growth
potential. He also called on the nation’s authorities to
guarantee “independent and competent regulators working
transparently and professionally.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
