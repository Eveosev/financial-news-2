Phono Solar Technology Co., a
Chinese state-owned solar-panel maker, expects growth in its
home market to speed up in the coming six months.  Phono Solar targets global sales of about 400 megawatts of
solar modules this year after selling about 300 megawatts in
2011, said Eric  Yuan , the company’s marketing director. The
company seeks by the end of the month to determine whether to
increase its production capacity of 450 megawatts.  “The Chinese solar market grew fast in the first and
second quarter,” Yuan said today in an interview on the
sidelines of the Intersolar conference in Munich. “It will even
grow faster in the second half of the year.”  Phono Solar, which has about 500 employees, last month said
it would team with Suntech Power Holdings Co. to jointly develop
projects in  China , plans 50 megawatts of solar farms this year
in China’s eastern provinces of Jiangsu and Shandong and the
northwestern region of Xinjiang.  To contact the reporters on this story:
