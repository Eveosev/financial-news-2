The yuan was little changed as the
 World Bank  warned Europe’s debt crisis is increasing risks for
emerging-market economies, after the Chinese central bank cut
interest rates to shore up growth.  The Washington-based lender predicted China’s gross
domestic product will rise 8.2 percent this year and 8.6 percent
in 2013, compared with January estimates of 8.4 percent and 8.3
percent, respectively. Asian stocks advanced after the  European
Central Bank  said a Spain bailout will help bolster financial
stability in the euro area.  “It’s a bit of a non-event day” with stocks rising
modestly, said  Sacha Tihanyi , a strategist at Scotiabank in Hong
Kong, a unit of  Bank of Nova Scotia. (BNS)  “With the uncertainty in
China and the ongoing grind in the euro zone, I don’t see any
real thrust for  yuan  appreciation at this point.”  The yuan closed at 6.3691 per dollar in Shanghai, compared
with 6.3703 yesterday, according to the China Foreign Exchange
Trade System. It touched this year’s low of 6.3783 on May 31.  China’s central bank reduced its one-year lending and
deposit rates by a quarter of a percentage point to 6.31 percent
and 3.25 percent, respectively, on June 8. The economy expanded
8.1 percent in the first quarter from a year earlier, the
slowest pace in almost three years.  The People’s Bank of China fixed the currency’s  reference
rate  0.03 percent stronger at 6.3271 today. The yuan is allowed
to trade as much as 1 percent on either side of the daily fixing.
In  Hong Kong ’s offshore market, the yuan gained 0.01 percent to
6.3698. Twelve-month non-deliverable forwards were little
changed at 6.4213, a 0.8 percent discount to the onshore spot
rate.  To contact the reporters on this story:
