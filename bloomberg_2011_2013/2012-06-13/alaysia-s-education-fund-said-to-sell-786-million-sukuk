Malaysia’s  National Higher Education
Fund Corp . sold 2.5 billion ringgit ($786 million) of
government-guaranteed Islamic debt, two people with knowledge of
the matter said.  The 10-year sukuk, or securities that pay returns on assets
to comply with Islam’s ban on interest, were privately placed
and yielded 3.83 percent yesterday, said the people who didn’t
want to be named because the information is private. The Kuala
Lumpur-based corporation, known locally as PTPTN, provides
financing for students eligible for higher education.  Issuance by Malaysian companies rose 5 percent this year to
15 billion ringgit from the same period in 2011, when full-year
sales reached a record 75.6 billion ringgit, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. Demand exceeded supply by more than three
times for Johor Corp.’s sukuk sale last week.  Azhar Ahmad, PTPTN’s deputy senior finance manager, couldn’t
be reached for comment by telephone today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
