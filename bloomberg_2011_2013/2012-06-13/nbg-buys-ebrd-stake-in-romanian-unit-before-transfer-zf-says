The  National Bank of Greece SA ,
bought a 26 million-euro ($32.5 million) stake in its unit Banca
Romaneasca SA from the European Bank for Reconstruction and
Development, Ziarul Financiar  reported , without saying where it
got the information.  Greece ’s biggest lender raised its holding in its Romanian
unit by 10.2 percent to 99.3 percent with the transaction, the
Bucharest-based newspaper said.  The National  Bank of Greece (TELL)  plans to transfer its
southeastern European units to a special-purpose vehicle and try
to sell a minority stake in that company to investors, which may
include international lenders, such as the EBRD or the
International Finance Corp., according to the newspaper.  Alpha Bank SA, Greece’s third-biggest lender, is also
working on a similar plan to transfer its southeastern European
units to a holding company, which will be able to attract
capital from strategic investors, Ziarul Financiar said, citing
unidentified banking-industry people.  To contact the reporter on this story:
