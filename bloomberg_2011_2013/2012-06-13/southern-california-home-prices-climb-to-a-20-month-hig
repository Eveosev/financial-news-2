Southern California  home prices rose
in May to their highest level in 20 months as costlier
properties in coastal areas made up a bigger share of sales,
 DataQuick  said.  The median price for houses and condominiums in the six-
county region increased to $295,000, up 1.7 percent from April
and 5.4 percent from May 2011, the San Diego-based data seller
said today in a statement. Sellers who’d been holding out for
higher prices are becoming more willing to make deals so they
can buy more desirable properties, DataQuick said.  “It looks like more move-up buyers are concluding it makes
sense in the long run to sell their homes now, even when it’s
hard to swallow the price,” DataQuick President  John Walsh  said
in the statement. “The upside for many is a good deal on the
next house, and the ability to lock in both a killer mortgage
rate and a relatively low property-tax base.”  A total of 22,192 homes sold last month in Southern
California, up 15 percent from April and 21 percent from May
2011. About 70 percent of those sales were in coastal  San Diego ,
Orange,  Los Angeles  and Ventura counties, up from less than 68
percent a year earlier, the company said.  Homes priced at $500,000 or more made up more than 22
percent of transactions, up from 21 percent both the previous
month and a year earlier, and the highest portion since July
2010, DataQuick said. Distressed deals including foreclosures
accounted for less than 45 percent of the total, the lowest
since March 2008.  To contact the reporter on this story:
