California-blend gasoline in  Los
Angeles  rose after a refinery fire and a state report showing
gasoline stocks dropped last week.  Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) â€™s Torrance refinery in Southern
California is repairing a hydrotreater after a fire was sparked
by a leak in a line June 11, a person familiar with operations
said at the time.  California-blend gasoline supplies fell 5.5 percent last
week from a week earlier, the state Energy Commission said in an
e-mailed report. California-blend diesel supplies rose 24.6
percent and jet fuel inventories declined 0.5 percent.  California-blend, or Carbob, gasoline in Los Angeles rose
1.75 cents to a discount of 3.5 cents a gallon to futures traded
on the  New York Mercantile Exchange  at 4:16 p.m., according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. Carbob in  San Francisco  was
unchanged at a 5-cent discount.  Conventional, 87-octane gasoline in  Portland ,  Oregon , fell
5 cents to a 12-cents-a-gallon discount to  New York  futures.  California-blend, or CARB, diesel in Los Angeles rose 0.13
cent to a premium of 4.38 cents a gallon over Nymex heating oil
futures. The same fuel in San Francisco was unchanged at a 6.5-
cent premium.  Low-sulfur diesel in Portland rose 5 cents to a premium of
10 cents a gallon over futures.  To contact the reporter on this story:
