Cyprus is considering several
options to finance the recapitalization of its banks, including
that of a bilateral loan,  CyBC  radio reported today, citing
Finance Minister Vassos Shiarly.  The conditions under which Cyprus could resort to the
European rescue mechanism before June 30, which is also among
the options, would not be burdensome, CyBC reported, citing
Shiarly.  To contact the reporter on this story:
