Germany ’s Economy Minister Philipp
Roesler wants to shorten legal actions against the expansion of
the nation’s power grid and wants exceptions from environmental
protection,  Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung  reported, citing
Roesler.  The expansion of the power grids in Germany would otherwise
take too long to meet the challenges of the faster exit from
nuclear energy Germany decided last year, FAZ says, citing a
speech by Roesler in Berlin today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
