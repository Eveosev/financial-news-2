Russia  is only repairing helicopters
sold to Syria by the  Soviet Union , two people familiar with the
matter said, after U.S. Secretary of State  Hillary Clinton  said
shipments of Russian attack choppers were escalating 15 months
of violence.  Russia has been fixing about 20 Mi-24 choppers that Syrian 
leader Bashar al-Assad's father Hafez acquired, under a contract 
signed four years ago, said one of the people, who works in Russia's 
defense industry and declined to be identified because the matter is
confidential. Clinton said yesterday that the U.S. is ``concerned 
by the latest information we have that there are attack helicopters 
on the way from Russia to  Syria , which will escalate the conflict 
quite dramatically.''   More than 10,000 people have died in Syria since an uprising 
against Assad’s government started last March. The level of violence 
has increased, including massacres of Sunni civilians blamed on state-
backed shabiha militiamen. They belong to Assad’s Alawite sect, which 
is associated with Shiite Islam. The government is also using attack 
helicopters against the opposition, the UN and U.S. have said.  Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov today accused the
U.S. of arming Syrian rebels and reiterated Russia’s position
that all weapons deliveries to Assad’s government are lawful, in
comments translated into Farsi from Russian at a press
conference in Tehran.  To contact the reporter on this story:
