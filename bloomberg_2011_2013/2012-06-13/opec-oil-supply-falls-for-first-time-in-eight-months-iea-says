OPEC cut crude production last
month, ending a seven-month run of increases, as Saudi Arabia
and  Iraq  reduced supplies, the  International Energy Agency  said.  The 12 members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries pumped 31.86 million barrels a day of crude last
month, compared with 31.89 million in April, the Paris-based IEA
said in its monthly Oil Market Report. That exceeds the group’s
30 million output ceiling set in December and is still
“flirting with four-year highs”, the agency said.  OPEC, which is meeting this week in Vienna, will need to
produce more than its agreed limit in the second half of the
year, the IEA said. The call on OPEC will increase to 30.9
million barrels a day in the period, compared with 29.8 million
from January to June, it said.  OPEC’s estimate of production last month was 31.58 million
barrels a day, according to its monthly report yesterday. That
figure is based on secondary sources.  Saudi Arabia , the world’s largest  crude exporter , cut
production by about 100,000 barrels a day to 10 million barrels
a day last month after reaching a three-decade peak in April.  OPEC’s “effective” spare capacity remained unchanged at
an estimated 2.38 million barrels a day in May, the IEA said.
That excludes Iraq, Nigeria, Libya and Iran.  OPEC’s members are Algeria,  Angola ,  Ecuador , Iran, Iraq,
Kuwait, Libya, Nigeria, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, United Arab
Emirates and Venezuela.  To contact the reporter on this story:
