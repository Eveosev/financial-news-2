Three unidentified employees of  CME
Group Inc. (CME) ’s GreenX unit in London have left the company,  Allan
Schoenberg , a CME spokesman, said today by phone.  “I can confirm that we are fully committed to U.S. and
European emissions markets and are making good progress
migrating the GreenX product slate to the CME Group energy
complex,” Schoenberg said in an e-mailed statement.  After buying out its partners in GreenX in April, CME is
migrating all futures and options contracts and their open
interest to its Nymex market from the GreenX market, the
statement said.   To contact the reporter on this story:
