Ethanol futures snapped a two-day
streak of losses after a government report showed increased
demand and lower stockpiles.  Prices advanced after the Energy Department said
 inventories  slumped 2.5 percent to 20.7 million barrels, the
biggest drop and lowest level since May 11 while  output  jumped
1.8 percent to 920,000 barrels a day, the highest amount since
Feb. 10 and the biggest weekly gain since April 27.  Production of conventional gasoline blended with ethanol , a
measure of consumption beyond what’s mandated by the government,
jumped 4.9 percent to a record 5.51 million barrels a day.
That’s the biggest increase since the week ended June 10, 2011.  Denatured ethanol for July delivery gained 1.4 cents, or
0.7 percent, to settle at $2.05 a gallon on the  Chicago  Board of
Trade. Prices have fallen 6.9 percent this year.  In spot market trading, ethanol in  New York  lost 3.5 cents,
or 1.7 percent, to $2.045 a gallon and in Chicago the additive
declined 2 cents, or 1 percent, to $1.99, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  Ethanol in the U.S. Gulf sank 2 cents, or 1 percent, to
$2.06 a gallon and on the West Coast the biofuel dropped 1.5
cents, or 0.7 percent, to $2.155.  To contact the reporter on this story:
