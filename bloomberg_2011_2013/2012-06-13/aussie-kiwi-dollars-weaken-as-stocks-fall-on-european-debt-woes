The Australian and  New Zealand 
dollars erased earlier gains amid concern Greek elections this
weekend will further roil  Europe ’s debt crisis, reducing demand
for riskier assets.  The Aussie weakened against most of its 16 major peers
after  Reserve Bank  of Australia Governor  Glenn Stevens  said the
nation’s real exchange rate is “pretty high” and data showed
 consumer confidence  was near the lowest level this year. The so-
called kiwi was 0.3 percent from a one-month high against its
Australian counterpart before a Reserve Bank of New Zealand
meeting tomorrow where policy makers are expected to leave rates
unchanged.  “Markets are going to be nervous up until the Greek
election,” said Janu Chan, an economist at St. George Bank Ltd.
in Sydney. “Aussie is keeping just below parity because of
these concerns.”  The Australian dollar lost 0.2 percent to 99.41 U.S. cents
as of 4:01 p.m. in Sydney from yesterday, after earlier gaining
0.1 percent. It was at 79.29 yen from 79.20 yesterday, when it
advanced 1.1 percent.  Australia ’s currency bought NZ$1.2807 from
NZ$1.2812 yesterday, when it touched NZ$1.2773, the least since
May 11.  New Zealand’s currency slid 0.1 percent to 77.62 U.S. cents
after earlier touching 77.89, the highest level since May 15.
The kiwi fetched 61.83 yen from 61.81 yesterday.  Greece Votes  Greece ’s general election looms on June 17 as concerns of
debt contagion drive bonds lower in  Spain  and  Italy , which is
scheduled to sell securities today and tomorrow. The election
may determine whether Greece abides by spending reductions
imposed upon it to receive two international bailouts and stay
in the euro. Spain on June 9 became the fourth of the currency
union’s 17 states to ask for a rescue.  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index futures fell 0.2 percent,
signaling the underling gauge may retreat after climbing 1.2
percent yesterday.  “Europe will remain a key market driver for the
foreseeable future,” a Barclays Capital research team led by
Larry Kantor wrote in a research note today. Barclays prefers to
“fade” rallies in risky currencies.  The RBA’s Stevens said in Brisbane today that the nation’s
real exchange rate is “pretty high here” and is a “test of
adaptability” for the nation’s companies. A consumer sentiment
index for June rose 0.3 percent to 95.6, a  Westpac Banking Corp. (WBC) 
and Melbourne Institute survey taken June 4-10 of 1,200
consumers showed today. The gauge fell to 94.54 in April, the
lowest since August 2011.  Economic Strength  Moody’s Investors Service today said Australia’s top Aaa
rating outlook remains stable, and the country’s economic
strength is “very high.”  Australia’s government bonds declined, pushing the yield on
the 10-year security up by five basis points, or 0.05 percentage
point, to 3.03 percent. Yields on the three-year government note
rose seven basis points to 2.35 percent.  All 16 economists surveyed by Bloomberg News expect New
Zealand’s central bank to keep its key  interest rate  unchanged
at 2.5 percent when policy makers meet tomorrow.  “Should the  exchange rate  remain strong without anything
else changing, the bank would need to reassess the outlook for
monetary policy settings,” RBNZ Governor Alan Bollard said in a
statement in Wellington on April 26 after holding the official
rate.  A  Credit Suisse Group AG index  based on swaps indicates the
RBNZ will lower rates by 16 basis points over the next 12
months, compared to 44 basis points indicated on June 4.  “In previous meetings, RBNZ expressed a lot of concern on
the strength of their currency,” said Greg Gibbs, a senior
currency strategist at Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc in
Sydney. “I think that concern will show up less in the
statement this time. On balance, we could see the statement
being supportive of the kiwi.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
