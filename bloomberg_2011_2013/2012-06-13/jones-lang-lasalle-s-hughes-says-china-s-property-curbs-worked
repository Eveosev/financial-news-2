Alastair Hughes, Asia-Pacific chief
executive officer of Jones Lang LaSalle Inc., comments about
outlook for  China  and the region’s property markets in an
interview with Bloomberg Television.  “The Chinese government policy is to trail rises in
residential property prices and it’s been very successful.
They’ve also tried to increase the supply and to reduce demand.
It’s worked. Prices have fallen across the board due to these
controls.  “They’ve done what they intended to do, which is to take
speculators off the market. At the moment, if you analyze all
buyers of residential properties in China, 93 percent of them
are buying for their own occupation, and only 7 percent are
speculators.  “I’d be a little bit wary of the very high-end of
residential markets in some of the key markets here in  Asia ,
because you are betting against the government policy.”  --Bonnie Cao and Rishaad Salamat. Editor: Linus Chua  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
