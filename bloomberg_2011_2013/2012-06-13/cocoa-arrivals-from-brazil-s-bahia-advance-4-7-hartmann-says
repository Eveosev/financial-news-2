Cocoa arrivals from Bahia,  Brazil ’s
biggest growing region, climbed 4.7 percent from a week earlier,
according to analyst  Thomas Hartmann .  Deliveries to shippers and processors were 97,693 bags in
the week ended June 10, Hartmann said in a report yesterday.
That compares with the 93,267 bags he reported a week earlier.
Total arrivals across Brazil were 145,064 bags from 136,237 bags
a week earlier, he said. A bag weighs 60 kilograms (132 pounds).  Bahia accounted for 74 percent of Brazil’s cocoa output and
94 percent of grindings in the past five years, Hartmann said in
an Oct. 12 e-mail. He’s a board member of the Commercial
Association of Bahia and heads the group’s statistical service
on Brazilian production.  To contact the reporter on this story:
