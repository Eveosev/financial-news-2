Andrew Bellis, who ran the
collateralized loan obligation business at  Credit Suisse Group
AG (CSGN) , is leaving the bank, according to people with knowledge of
the discussions.  Brad Larson, who is based in  New York , will now run the
global CLO origination group, said the people, who asked not to
be identified because the change hasn’t been made public. He was
previously in charge of arranging new-issue CLOs in the U.S.
Michael Kurinets continues to be head of secondary trading of
the securities.  Steven Vames, a Credit Suisse spokesman, declined to
comment. Bellis, who is based in  London , didn’t return an e-mail
and two telephone calls seeking comment.  CLOs are a type of collateralized debt obligation that
pool high-yield, high-risk loans and slice them into securities
of varying risk and return.  Credit Suisse arranged two of the funds backed by widely
syndicated loans in the U.S. this year, including a $514 million
CLO for  Apollo Global Management LLC (APO)  that priced last week,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The bank also arranged
two CLOs last year.  The bank arranged a $361.9 million fund for ING Alternative
Asset Management LLC earlier this year, according to the data.  There have been $13.9 billion of such CLOs raised this year
compared with $11.7 billion for all of 2011, according to
Bloomberg data.  To contact the reporter on this story:
