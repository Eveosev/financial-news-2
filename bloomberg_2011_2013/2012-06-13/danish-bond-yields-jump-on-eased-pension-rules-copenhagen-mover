Danish 30-year bond yields jumped to
the highest in a month in Copenhagen trading after the
government agreed to ease rules for the country’s pension firms
to help reduce liabilities.  The yield on  Denmark ’s 4.5 percent note due 2039 soared 13
basis points to 2.09 percent as of 11:28 a.m. local time, the
highest since May 11. The bond underperformed similar-maturity
debt in  Germany  where yields rose two basis points less.  Danish pension companies and life insurers will be allowed
to raise the discount rate they use to calculate their
liabilities to better reflect long-term growth and inflation
prospects, the government said late yesterday. The change
reduces the industry’s incentive to continue buying up longer-
dated debt as record-low bond yields have inflated the value of
their obligations.  “The demand for duration isn’t as strong as before,” Henrik Henriksen, chief investment strategist at Copenhagen-based PFA
Pension A/S, Denmark’s second-largest pension fund with about
$50 billion in assets, said in an interview. “Looking especially
at the 30-year point, there’s less demand for 30-year bonds due
to the new rate curve.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
