OAO Lukoil’s Litasco sold gasoline
for loading in northwest  Europe  for a fourth day. Gasoil fell as
much as 0.7 percent on the ICE Futures Europe exchange.  Naphtha’s crack, or discount to Brent, widened to the most
in 3 1/2 years as demand slumps.  Light Products  Gasoline barges for immediate loading in Amsterdam-
Rotterdam-Antwerp traded at $925 and $926 a metric ton,
according to a survey of brokers and traders monitoring the
Argus Bulletin Board. That compares with yesterday’s deals from
$910 to $917, the lowest since Dec. 21, data compiled by
Bloomberg show.  Statoil ASA sold the Eurobob grade, to which ethanol is
added to make finished fuel, for a second day. Royal Dutch Shell
Plc bought for a third day on the barge market where lots are
typically of 1,000 tons or 2,000 tons.  Gasoline’s  premium  to Brent was unchanged at $10.82 a
barrel as of 12 p.m. local time, according to data from PVM Oil
Associates Ltd., a broker in London.  Naphtha’s crack, a measure of refining profitability, was
at $15.19 a barrel, PVM data show. That’s the largest discount
since Dec. 19, 2008.  “Activity in the naphtha market remains subdued and shows
no signs of recovery,” Vienna-based JBC Energy GmbH said in an
e-mailed report today. “In Europe, petrochemical requirements
remain poor on the back of weaker manufacturing and industrial
activity, while cheaper alternative feedstock prices such as
propane and butane have also weighed on naphtha demand.”  Middle Distillates  Gasoil for July delivery fell as much as $6.25 to $839.75
on the ICE exchange in  London  and was at $846.75 as of 1:04 p.m.
London time. The August contract was at $842.75 a ton, putting
the spread between the two months at $4.  Gasoil’s  crack , a measure of refining profitability, fell
to $16.23 a barrel. Brent gained 0.5 percent to $97.58 a barrel.  To contact the reporter on this story:
