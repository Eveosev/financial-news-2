Finland  should strive to connect its
natural gas network to Central Europe’s via  Estonia  to create
competition in the industry, the Finnish economy ministry said.  Finland needs to cooperate with Estonia to get European
Union funding to build a port terminal in the Gulf of Finland
and for a  gas pipeline  through Estonia, the government said in a
 statement  today.  A competitive gas market in Finland hasn’t been possible so
far because the country is geographically reliant on Russia,
whose OAO Gazprom has been the sole supplier of Finnish gas for
almost four decades now.  Gasum Oy, operator of Finland’s natural-gas network, has
said it’s considering building a terminal to import liquefied
natural gas and cut dependence on Russian deliveries. A recent
study by Helsinki-based PTT Research Institute also recommended
the country invest in LNG to mitigate the impact of rising oil
prices.  To contact the reporter on this story:
