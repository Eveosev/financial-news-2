Andy Schleck , who became champion of
the 2010 Tour de France after the winner failed a drug test,
will miss this year’s cycle race with a back fracture, his team
said today.  Schleck suffered a fracture in a crash in a June 7 time
trial at the Criterium du Dauphine, a warm up for the Tour,
RadioshackNissanTrek said today in a statement. The rider will
miss four to six weeks. The Tour starts June 30 and finishes
July 22.  Alberto Contador  got a two-year ban for failing a drug test
and stripped of his 2010 Tour win earlier this year, giving
Schleck the title. Last week, Schleck was knocked off his bike
during the time trial, and dropped out two days later because of
the pain.  “This is the biggest disappointment in my life,” said
Schleck, who’s finished in the top three at the Tour de  France 
three times. “The Tour is the most important race. I would
have been ready to perform. I wanted to give an answer to my
critics.”  The Luxembourg rider’s orthopedic surgeon, Dr. Torsten
Gerich, said the injury was a bone bruise. Schleck said he’ll
resume riding in three weeks, and wants to ride in the Olympics.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
