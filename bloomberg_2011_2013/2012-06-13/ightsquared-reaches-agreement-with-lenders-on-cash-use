LightSquared Inc. reached a final
agreement to use lenders’ cash collateral after saying it might
have to liquidate without the deal.  The accord gives the maker of wireless broadband technology
enough money to fund operations until September 2013, Matthew
Barr, a lawyer for LightSquared, told U.S. Bankruptcy Judge
Shelley Chapman today. As part of the deal, LightSquared agreed
to pay the lenders $6.25 million a month and let them return to
court to move to end the use of cash collateral, he said.  “Once I’ve had a chance to review this, we’ll get it on
the docket,” Chapman said at a hearing in  Manhattan .  The lenders, which own $1.1 billion of debt in
LightSquared’s “LP” unit, will allow the company to use as
much as $190 million in collateral, Barr has said. Hearings were
adjourned three times this week as the parties worked to broker
a deal.  The LP lenders’ earlier offers were “untenable,” Barr
told Chapman on June 11. The group includes Capital Research &
Management Co., Appaloosa Management LP and  Fortress Investment
Group LLC. (FIG)   LightSquared, backed by  Philip Falcone , had been in a
dispute with the group since the outset of its Chapter 11 case
last month. Without permission to use cash, LightSquared “would
be forced to terminate its business operations and liquidate its
assets,” the company said in court papers.  LightSquared separately reached an “agreement in
principal” with lenders to its “Inc.” unit on a so-called
debtor-in-possession loan, Barr said June 11. U.S. Bank NA is an
agent to lenders to the Inc. unit, which owes $322.3 million.  The case is In re LightSquared Inc., 12-12080,  U.S.
Bankruptcy Court , Southern District of  New York  (Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
