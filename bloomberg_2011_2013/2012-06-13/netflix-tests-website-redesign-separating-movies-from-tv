Netflix Inc. (NFLX) , the online movie
service, is testing a redesign of its website that separates
movie viewing options from its growing television catalog.  By splitting off films from television shows, and offering
subcategories of each, the new look would improve viewers’
ability to find programs in specific genres. The company hasn’t
decided yet whether to implement the design later this year.  Joris Evers, a Netflix spokesman, declined to comment on
whether Netflix plans to change its recommendation system, which
offers choices of movies and television shows based in part on
what a person previously has watched.  “At Netflix, we always work hard to improve the instant
click-and-watch experience for our members,” Evers said in an
e-mailed statement. “That includes testing new features to see
if it results in increased viewing.”  Netflix Chief Executive Officer  Reed Hastings  has said the
Los Gatos, California-based company will fend off the
competition this year by devoting more time to making the
service appealing to members. The company faces rivals including
online retailer Amazon.com, Hulu LLC, Comcast Corp.’s Streampix
and  Verizon Communications Inc. (VZ) ’s online venture with  Coinstar
Inc. (CSTR) ’s Redbox. In May, Hastings said Netflix will add a service
this year that lets more than two users watch concurrently.  Netflix fell less than 1 percent to $62.83 at the New York
close. The company’s shares have fallen 9.3 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
