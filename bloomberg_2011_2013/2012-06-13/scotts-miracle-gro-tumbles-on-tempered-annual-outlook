Scotts Miracle-Gro Co. (SMG) , the largest
marketer of branded lawn-care products, declined the most in
more than a month after saying it may fall short of the growth
it had forecast for the fiscal year, citing slowing U.S. sales.  Scotts fell 6.6 percent, the most since May 8, to $40.21 at
the close in New York. The Marysville, Ohio-based company has
dropped 14 percent this year.  Scotts, which sells its products through chains such as
 Lowe’s Cos. (LOW)  and Home Depot Inc., said in a statement yesterday
that consumer purchases at its largest U.S. retail partners had
risen 3 percent in the year so far, compared with 8 percent at
the start of May. Sales growth in the year ending Sept. 30 may
miss the company’s earlier  forecast  of 6 percent to 8 percent,
according to the statement.  Earnings excluding certain items may not reach a forecast
of $2.65 to $2.85 a share, the company said. The average
estimate of analysts had been $2.81, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
