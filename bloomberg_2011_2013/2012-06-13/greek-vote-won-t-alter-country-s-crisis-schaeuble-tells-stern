Greece ’s election results won’t
change the reality of the country’s economic crisis and won’t
prevent the nation from carrying out painful reforms, German
Finance Minister  Wolfgang Schaeuble  told  Stern magazine .  Greeks on June 17 “can vote however they want,” Schaeuble
told the German magazine in an interview today. “But whatever
election result we have will change nothing about the actual
situation in the country, which is in a painful crisis brought
on by a decades-long flawed economy.”  The German finance chief was quoted by Stern as saying he
had “really great sympathy with the man on the street in
Greece” suffering under the effects of austerity. “I can’t
spare him that,” he added. “Crises are seldom fair.”  “It’s not easy to cut the minimum wage in Greece if you
think about all the yacht owners,” Schaeuble said. “But the
Greek minimum wage is just dropping to the level of  Spain . If
the country wants to become competitive again, it has to sink.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
