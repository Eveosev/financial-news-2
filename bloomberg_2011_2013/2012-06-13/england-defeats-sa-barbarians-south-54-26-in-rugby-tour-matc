England  defeated SA Barbarians South
54-26 in a midweek rugby tour match to rebound from its series-
opening loss to South Africa.  Christian Wade scored a hat-trick and Thomas Waldrom got
two tries as England touched down eight times against the
Barbarians in Kimberley, four days after losing 22-17 to the
Springboks in Durban. Head coach  Stuart Lancaster  fielded a
completely new starting lineup.  The Test series resumes June 16 in Johannesburg before
concluding a week later in  Port Elizabeth . This year marks a
return to best-of-three contests as rugby administrators seek to
make matches more meaningful in the June international period,
during which touring northern hemisphere teams have typically
sent under strength squads to the southern hemisphere.  England, which is also scheduled to play SA Barbarians
North on June 19 in Potchestroom, will name its team for the
second Test tomorrow.  The third-ranked Springboks, who are on a record eight-
match winning run against England, today made one change to
their starting lineup. Pat Lambie will start at fullback,
replacing injured Zen Kirchner.  To contact the reporters on this story:
