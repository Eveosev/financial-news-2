Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN)  forged a licensing
agreement with Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Studios Inc., letting the
online retailer add “The Silence of the Lambs,” and hundreds
of other movies and TV shows to its Internet video service.  Amazon’s Prime Instant Video catalog now includes more than
18,000 films and TV episodes, the Seattle-based e-commerce
company said today in a statement. Users can watch the programs
on their computers, Kindle Fire tablets or other devices.  The MGM catalog, which includes “Terminator,” “Dances
With Wolves” and “Rain Man,” will help Amazon’s video service
compete with rival offerings from Apple Inc. and  Google Inc. (GOOG) ’s
YouTube. The companies are racing to add more content and
features as more consumers start watching professionally
produced entertainment on their computers.  “MGM offers one of the most distinguished catalogs in all
of Hollywood,” Brad Beale, director of digital video content
acquisition for Amazon, said in the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
