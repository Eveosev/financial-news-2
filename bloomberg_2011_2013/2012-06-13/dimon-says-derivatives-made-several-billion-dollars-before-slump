JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) ’s credit
derivatives portfolio responsible for a $2 billion
trading loss made “several billion dollars” in profit in the
three or so years before the trades turned against the company,
Chief Executive Officer  Jamie Dimon  said.  “The synthetic credit portfolio made several billion
dollars” before the company’s May 10 announcement that a wrong-
way bet in repositioning the book went bad, Dimon said at a
hearing of the Senate Banking Committee today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
