Crude oil declined in  New York  as
the  International Energy Agency  said global markets are better
supplied than earlier this year and U.S. retail sales dropped.  Futures slid as much as 1.2 percent. The Paris-based IEA
said in a monthly report today that global supplies increased by
200,000 barrels to 91.1 million barrels a day in May. U.S. crude
inventories, which rose to the highest since 1990 at the end of
May, may drop this week, according to a Bloomberg News survey
before a government report. U.S. retail sales fell in May for a
second month, a sign the world’s largest economy is cooling.  “There’s still an overhang in crude inventories in the
U.S. and stocks have built globally in the first half of the
year,” Gareth Lewis-Davies, an analyst at BNP Paribas SA in
 London , said by phone. “The market is being affected, as with
other commodities, by swings in trader risk aversion.”  Oil for July delivery fell as much as 99 cents to $82.33 a
barrel in electronic trading on the  New York Mercantile Exchange 
and was at $82.54 as of 1:49 p.m. London time. It traded as high
as $83.82 earlier today. Prices are down 17 percent this year.  Brent crude  for July settlement on the London-based ICE
Futures Europe exchange, which expires tomorrow, rose 5 cents to
$97.19 a barrel. The European benchmark grade was at a premium
of $14.71 to New York crude compared with $13.82 yesterday, the
lowest since May 5. The more-actively traded August contract was
down 5 cents at $96.92.  Better Supplied  The IEA said the oil market is better supplied amid concern
that slowing economic growth will curb crude demand. The agency
cut its forecast for 2012 crude consumption to 89.9 million
barrels a day, down by 100,000 barrels from May and reflects an
increase of 820,000 barrels from last year.  The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, which
meets tomorrow in Vienna, cut production last month, ending
seven months of increases, as  Saudi Arabia  and Iraq lowered
supplies, the IEA said.  Abdalla El-Badri, OPEC’s secretary-general, said today in
Vienna that “there is some oversupply in the market” for oil.  OPEC, responsible for about 40 percent of global oil
supply, pumped 31.58 million barrels a day last month, the
group’s secretariat said in its Monthly Oil Market Report
yesterday, citing secondary sources. That’s down from 31.64
million in April and exceeds its quota of 30 million agreed on
in December.  Output Ceiling  Saudi Arabia,  Kuwait , Qatar and the  United Arab Emirates 
would like to raise the output ceiling by 500,000 barrels a day,
an OPEC delegate said yesterday, declining to be identified
because member countries are still in talks.  Iran , facing a
European Union embargo on its oil exports from July 1, and
 Venezuela  have been joined by  Iraq  and  Angola  in warning that
supplies are excessive.  OPEC will keep the production ceiling at 30 million barrels
a day, according to all 20 traders and analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg News last week.  Retail sales in the U.S. fell as slower employment and
subdued wage gains damped demand. The 0.2 percent decrease
followed a similar decline in April that was previously reported
as a gain, Commerce Department figures showed today in
 Washington . Sales excluding automobiles slumped by the most in
two years.  A U.S. Energy Department report today may show crude
supplies decreased 1.5 million barrels, according to the median
estimate of 12 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg News. Gasoline
inventories are forecast to rise  1.4 million barrels , the survey
showed. The department is scheduled to release its weekly report
at 10:30 a.m. Washington time.  Venezuela holds the largest proven  oil reserves  in the
world, overtaking Saudi Arabia, according to  BP Plc. (BP/)   The South American country’s deposits were at 296.5 billion
barrels at the end of last year, surpassing Saudi Arabia’s 265.4
billion barrels, BP said today in its annual Statistical Review
of World Energy. The 2010 estimate for Venezuela was revised to
the same amount, up from 211.2 billion in the previous report.  Global reserves advanced to 1.65 trillion barrels at the
end of last year, a 1.9% percent increase from a revised 1.62
trillion in 2010, BP said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
