Treasuries advanced after U.S.
retail sales declined in May for a second straight month,
renewing concern consumer spending is weakening as economic
growth slows.  U.S. government securities fell earlier as the U.S.
prepares to sell $21 billion of 10-year notes today and $13
billion of 30-year long bonds tomorrow. They erased losses on
speculation the  Federal Reserve , which meets next week, may move
to spur growth.  “It was a very weak retail-sales number,” said Justin Lederer, an interest-rate strategist in New York at Cantor
Fitzgerald LP, one of 21 primary dealers that trade with the
central bank. “It makes the case for more stimulus. Everything
is on the table.”  The  yield  on the benchmark 10-year  note  slipped one basis
point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 1.65 percent at 11:35 a.m.
in New York, according to Bloomberg Bond Trader data prices.
Earlier it rose three basis points to 1.70 percent and fell as
much as four basis points. The price of the 1.75 percent
securities due in May 2022 rose 3/32, or 94 cents per $1,000
face amount, to 100 7/8.  Thirty-year bond yields were little changed at 2.77 percent
after rising earlier to 2.82 percent.  Treasuries pared gains as U.S. stocks erased losses. The
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index was little changed after losing as
much as 0.7 percent and rising 0.2 percent.  ‘Auction Supply’  “The dominating theme is the auction supply today,” said
Tom Tucci, managing director and head of Treasury trading in  New
York  at CIBC World Markets Corp. “I don’t think there’s real
demand here.”  The 10-year notes to be sold today yielded 1.65 percent in
pre-auction trading, compared with a record low 1.855 percent at
the previous offering on May 9. Investors submitted bids for 2.9
times the amount offered at that offering, versus an average of
3.08 times at the past 10 sales.  An auction yesterday of $32 billion of three-year notes
drew a yield of 0.387 percent, compared with a forecast of 0.383
percent in a Bloomberg News survey of primary dealers, which are
obligated to bid at U.S. debt sales. The bid-to-cover  ratio  fell
to 3.53, from 3.65 at the previous sale on May 8.  Treasuries reversed losses after data showed retail sales
in the U.S. fell as slower employment and subdued wage gains
damped demand. The 0.2 percent decrease followed a similar
decline in April that was previously reported as a gain,
Commerce Department figures showed today in  Washington . Sales
excluding automobiles slumped by the most in two years.  Inflation ‘Downswing’  “We’re clearly in a downswing in inflation,” said Thomas Simons, a government debt economist in New York at the primary
dealer Jefferies Group Inc. “There’s very little sign of
strength.”  The  difference  in yields between 10-year notes and Treasury
Inflation Protected Securities, which represents traders’
expectations for inflation over the life of the securities,
touched 2.11 percentage points, compared with the 2012 high of
2.45 percentage points in March. The average over the past 10
years is 2.15 percentage points.  A measure of price-increase predictions used by the Fed to
set policy, the five-year, five-year forward break-even rate,
which gauges the average inflation rate between 2017 and 2022,
was 2.6 percent on June 8, down from a 2012 high of 2.78 percent
on March 19 and a five-year average of 2.8 percent.  Fed Purchase  The U.S. central bank, which meets June 19-20, purchased
$4.76 billion of Treasuries today due from August 2020 to
February 2022 under its program known as Operation Twist. It is
seeking to replace $400 billion of shorter-term securities in
its holdings with longer-term bonds through this month to keep
borrowing costs down.  The Fed bought $2.3 trillion of bonds from December 2008 to
June 2011 in two rounds of a tactic called quantitative easing,
seeking to cap borrowing costs and stimulate the economy.  Fed Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said June 7 the central bank
remains prepared to take action as needed to protect the U.S.
financial system and economy in the event that financial
stresses escalate. Bernanke told the Joint Economic Committee in
Washington the Fed has the tools that would provide more support
to the economy.  U.S. government securities have lost 0.5 percent in June,
paring their returns for the year to 1.6 percent, according to
according to the Bank of America Merrill Lynch index.  A valuation measure showed 10-year U.S. government notes
are at almost the most expensive levels ever. The term premium,
a model created by economists at the Federal Reserve, was at
negative 0.83 percent after reaching negative 0.94 percent, the
record, on June 1. The average over the past year is negative
0.46 percent. A negative reading indicates investors are willing
to accept yields below what’s considered fair value.  To contact the reporter on this story:
