Hungary’s talks on an International
Monetary Fund-led aid package may start in July or August, once
the government amends a disputed central bank law and after a
European Union decision later this month on the country’s
finances,  Mihaly Varga , the minister in charge of IMF talks,
told TV2 today.  Hungary requested IMF aid in November. Talks haven’t
started because Hungary passed a disputed central bank law in
December that was opposed by the Washington-based lender and the
EU.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
