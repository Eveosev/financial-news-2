Inflation in  Ghana   accelerated  for a
third month in May as the local currency weakened and pushed up
costs in West Africa’s second-biggest economy, increasing the
likelihood that the central bank will raise its key rate today.  The rate advanced to 9.3 percent from 9.1 percent a month
earlier, Philomena Nyarko, acting head of the Ghana Statistical
Service, told reporters in Accra, the capital. Prices rose 2
percent in the month, she said.  The food inflation rate climbed to 5 percent and non-food
prices were up 12 percent, Nyarko said. Inflation for imported
food was 9.4 percent, an increase “attributable to the current
 exchange rate ,” she said.  Ghana’s cedi has dropped 15 percent this year against the
dollar, making it the worst in  Africa  after Malawi’s kwacha and
pushing up prices in the import-dependent country, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  The slumping cedi and its effect on consumer prices
prompted the Bank of Ghana’s Monetary Policy Committee to raise
its key lending rate by 200 basis points since February. The
central bank’s target for inflation this year is 8.5 percent,
according to its website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
