Chicago  gasoline weakened after
Citgo Petroleum Corp. completed maintenance at the Lemont
refinery in Illinois.  The 170,500-barrel-a-day plant was scheduled to shut most
of the main production units by May 1 for repairs expected to
last four or five weeks, a person familiar with the plantâ€™s
operations said April 26. The equipment shut included a crude
unit, coker, fluid catalytic cracker and alkylation unit, the
person said.  The premium for conventional, 87-octane gasoline in Chicago
dropped 19 cents to 14 cents a gallon versus futures trading on
the New York Mercantile Exchange at 2:39 p.m., according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. Prompt delivery fell 18.54 cents to
$2.7948 a gallon.  Citgo said maintenance was completed at the Lemont refinery
in an e-mailed statement yesterday.  Conventional, 87-octane gasoline in the  Gulf Coast  rose
0.88 cent to a discount of 8.75 cents a gallon against futures.  Phillips 66 (PSX)  reported a process upset yesterday at the
Borger refinery in Texas, according to a filing with state
regulators.  The company also released sulfur dioxide to a flare after a
unit upset at its refinery in Westlake, Louisiana, according to
a filing with the National Response Center. The release at 12:34
p.m. local time yesterday was secured and the upset was
corrected, the filing showed.  Rich Johnson , a Phillips 66 spokesman, declined to comment
on the upsets.  Conventional gasoline in New York Harbor weakened 0.12 cent
to a premium of 1.88 cents versus futures.  To contact the reporter on this story:
