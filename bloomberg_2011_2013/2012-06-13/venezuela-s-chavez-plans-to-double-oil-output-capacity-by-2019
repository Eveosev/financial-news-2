Venezuelan President  Hugo Chavez 
will more than double the country’s oil-production capacity to 6
million barrels a day by 2019 if re-elected on Oct. 7, according
to a  government plan  released today on his website.  Chavez wants to increase domestic refining capacity to 1.8
million barrels a day from 1.3 million barrels a day in 2013,
according to the plan. No details on funding were given in the
plan, which stated that the nation would “intensify efforts to
obtain the financing needed.”  The South American country will “further the
diversification of its export markets,” and in 2019 aims to
export 2.2 million barrels a day to  Asia , 1.25 million barrels a
day to  Latin America  and the Caribbean, 1.15 million barrels a
day to  North America  and 550,000 barrels a day to  Europe .  Chavez, who is suffering from an undisclosed type of
cancer, has seen Venezuela’s production stagnate at less than 3
million barrels a day since he came to power in 1999, according
to  data  complied by Bloomberg. The country produced 2.82 million
barrels a day in May, according to a report from the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries.  Opposition candidate Henrique Capriles has pledged to
increase oil output if elected and wants the country to review
deals that provide Caribbean countries with subsidized oil.  Most of the new output will come from the Orinoco oil belt,
which is slated to produce 4 million barrels a day by 2019. The
plan also calls for drilling 10,500 horizontal wells from 2013
to 2019 and the construction of heavy crude upgraders.  To contact the reporter on this story:
