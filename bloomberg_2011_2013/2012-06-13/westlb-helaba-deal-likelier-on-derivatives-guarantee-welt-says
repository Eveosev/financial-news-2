WestLB AG and Helaba, which plans on
buying parts of the German lender, are close to an agreement
that would see Helaba avoid a potential 230 million euros ($288
million) of derivative losses, Die Welt reported.  Helaba would take on the derivative portfolio as part of a
sale, though 150 million euros of potential losses from the
position would be assumed by the German savings banks in North
Rhine-Westphalia that co-own WestLB, the newspaper reported,
without saying where it got the information. The remaining 80
million euros of potential losses will be guaranteed by
Portigon, the entity that will replace WestLB after it is wound
down, the report said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
