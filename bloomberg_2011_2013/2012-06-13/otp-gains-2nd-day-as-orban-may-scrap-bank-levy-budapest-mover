OTP Bank Nyrt. (OTP) , Hungary’s largest
lender, gained for a second day after Prime Minister  Viktor Orban  said the government may scrap a special bank tax from next
year.  The  shares  rose 1.2 percent to close at 3,431 forint in
Budapest. The benchmark BUX stock  index  advanced 0.4 percent to
16,962.98, rising for a second day.  Hungary may completely abandon a special bank tax
introduced in 2010 instead of only halving it beginning next
year, earlier than planned, Orban told executives at the
Austrian Chamber of Commerce in Vienna late yesterday. The bank
tax will be replaced by a transaction tax, which may yield
“huge revenue, probably more than what we are counting on in
the current budget,” he said.  Orban’s government levied special taxes on lenders,
retailers, and telecommunications companies in 2010 to plug
 budget  holes and boost revenue after cutting the personal income
tax rate.  Hungary , which pledged to keep the special taxes in
places for only three years, will introduce permanent levies on
phone calls, insurance services and financial transactions this
year and next as it seeks to push the country’s shortfall below
the European Union’s 3 percent limit.  The abolition of the bank levy is “positive,” Marta Czajkowska, an analyst at KBC Securities, said in an e-mailed
note to clients today. Initial positive market reaction “may be
muted by uncertainties regarding the scope of increase in
expected revenues from the transaction tax,” she wrote.  To contact the reporter on this story:
