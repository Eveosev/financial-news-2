U.S. stocks erased early losses as
energy producers climbed after the government reported a drop in
oil inventories and Johnson & Johnson led health-care shares
higher after accelerating its buyback plans.  The Standard & Poorâ€™s 500 Index was little changed at
1,324.5 at 10:37 a.m. in  New York  after slumping as much as 0.7
percent earlier following a drop in retail sales and an increase
in borrowing costs for Germany and Italy.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
