E-Commerce China Dangdang Inc. (DANG) 
jumped to the highest close in four weeks after a report said
the biggest Internet book retailer in China will operate online
sales channels for  Tencent Holdings Ltd. (700)   American depositary receipts of E-Commerce, known as
Dangdang, soared 10 percent to $5.87 in New York, the highest
level since May 17.  Dangdang  has reached an agreement with Tencent, China’s
biggest Internet company, to operate book and baby products
sales in Tencent’s online store, the Chinese-language National
Business Daily reported today, citing unidentified people at
both companies. Tencent plans to invest $1 billion in its e-
commerce unit, it said in a May 24 statement.  “People think Dangdang’s association with Tencent will be
good as Tencent will spend on e-commerce,” Andy Yeung, a New
York-based analyst for Oppenheimer & Co., said in a phone
interview. “Dangdang has a strategy to use more common online
marketplaces as channels to distribute their books and core
products.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
