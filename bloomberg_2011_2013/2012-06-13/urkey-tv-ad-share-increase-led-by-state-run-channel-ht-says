Turkish television’s share of total
advertising is rising, led by state-run broadcaster TRT,
 Haberturk newspaper  reported.  TRT more than doubled advertising revenue to 114 million
liras ($62.5 million) in 2011, the Istanbul-based newspaper
said, citing figures provided by Deputy Prime Minister Bulent Arinc. Television advertising makes up about 58 percent of
 Turkey ’s 4.2 billion lira advertising market, with 71 percent of
the revenue going to the country’s top five channels.  Kanal D, the channel owned by  Dogan Yayin Holding AS (DYHOL) , had
the largest share of advertising revenue in the first three
months of this year with 137 million liras, Haberturk said
citing figures from RTUK, the broadcasting watchdog. Star TV,
which Dogan sold to billionaire Ferit Sahenk’s Dogus Holding AS
last year, increased its revenue in the period to 78 million
liras from 52 million liras the previous year. Cukurova
Holding’s Show TV made 90 million liras in the same period, up
from 81 million liras the previous year.  ATV, the channel that Calik Holding AS is said to be in
talks with bidders including  Time Warner Inc. (TWX)  and Abraaj Capital
Ltd. to sell, saw its ad revenue fall 37 percent to 62 million
liras in the period, Haberturk said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
