Chaker A. Chahrour, executive vice
president of CFM International, comments on  Commercial Aircraft
Corp. of China Ltd. ’s C919, the nation’s first large passenger
aircraft program. He spoke in Beijing yesterday.  CFM International, a venture between  General Electric Co. (GE) 
and  Safran SA (SAF) , supplies engines for the C919, set for test
flights in 2014. Comac, as the planemaker is known, is also
developing the ARJ21, a 90-seat regional jet that has been
delayed for about five years.  “ARJ is behind schedule for whatever reason, but I really
don’t see too many associations between ARJ and the C919
schedule directly. The teams that run ARJ and C919 are totally
independent teams. We monitor the C919 program very closely; we
haven’t seen any indication that there will be delays that’s
similar to where the ARJ program is. So we have confidence in
Comac. We think they will be on schedule, we ask them about it
just about every day.”  A call to Comac’s press office in Shanghai seeking comment
wasn’t answered today.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
