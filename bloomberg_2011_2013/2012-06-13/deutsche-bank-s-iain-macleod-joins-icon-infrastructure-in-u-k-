Iain Macleod, a  Deutsche Bank AG (DBK) 
mergers banker whose clients included port operator  DP World
Ltd. (DPW) , joined iCon Infrastructure to advise the firm on
investments in energy, utilities and transport projects.  Macleod, 41, will join iCon as a partner in London next
month after 11 years at Deutsche Bank, the fund said in an e-
mailed statement today. The firm, which invests in
infrastructure in Europe and  North America , spun off from the
Frankfurt-based lender in 2011.  “There is considerable investor interest in infrastructure
and that’s growing,” Paul Malan, senior partner at iCon, said
in an interview. Infrastructure funds such as iCon are seeking
acquisitions as banks are pressed by regulators to offload
assets, Malan said.  Infrastructure funds seek to generate predictable returns
even when economic growth slows. The Organization for Economic
Co-operation and Development estimates governments will need to
spend $40 trillion on infrastructure between 2011 and 2030.  Macleod was a senior managing director in Deutsche Bank’s
U.K. corporate finance team until last month. He worked on deals
including the initial public offering of port operator DP World
in 2007 and its purchase of Peninsular & Oriental Steam
Navigation Co., Britain’s largest port operator, in 2006.  A spokeswoman for Deutsche Bank in  London  confirmed
Macleod’s departure and declined to comment further.  To contact the reporters on this story:
