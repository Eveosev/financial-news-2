(Corrects amount tracked in first paragraph.)  MSCI Inc. (MSCI) , whose stock indexes are
tracked by investors with about $7 trillion in assets, will
release the results of its 2012 annual market classification
review on June 20.  The decision will be announced shortly after 11 p.m.
Central European Summer Time, MSCI  said in a statement  on its
website. MSCI is reviewing South Korea and Taiwan for a
potential reclassification to developed markets, and Qatar and
the United Arab Emirates to  emerging markets .  In December, the U.A.E. and Qatar failed for the second
time in a year to secure an upgrade from frontier market status.
South Korea and Taiwan failed to win the developed-market
designation from MSCI in June last year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
