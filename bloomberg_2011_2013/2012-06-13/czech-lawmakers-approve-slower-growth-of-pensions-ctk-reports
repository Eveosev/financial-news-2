Czech lawmakers approved a draft law
cutting growth of pensions for three years as part of government
measures to reduce the  budget deficit , the  CTK  newswire
reported, citing the result of a parliamentary vote.  The opposition Social Democrats will probably veto the bill
in the upper house of parliament, the Senate, and return it to
the lower house for another vote, the newswire said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
