Kevin Durant  scored 17 of his 36
points in the fourth quarter and the host Oklahoma City Thunder
opened the National Basketball Association Finals with a 105-94
win against the Miami Heat.  Russell Westbrook  added 27 points and 11 assists as the
Thunder rallied from a 13-point first-half deficit last night at
Chesapeake Energy Arena.  Oklahoma City used a 9-0 run that began late in the third
quarter to take its first lead of the night, and then outscored
Miami 31-21 in the fourth period.  “We showed a lot of toughness in the second half, battling
and fighting for every possession,” Thunder coach Scott Brooks
said in a news conference. “It was a good win.”  LeBron James  led the Heat with 30 points and nine rebounds,
while  Dwyane Wade  scored 19 points for Miami. James won his
third NBA Most Valuable Player award this season, and Durant
finished second while winning his third consecutive scoring
title.  Game 2 is tomorrow night in Oklahoma City before the best-
of-seven series moves to Miami.  “We were putting ourselves in a position to win and then
they just went away,” Miami coach  Erik Spoelstra  said in a news
conference. “They’re relentless.”  Miami opened an 10-2 lead and went 5-for-6 on 3-pointers en
route to a 29-22 first-quarter advantage. Three of those 3-
pointers were by Shane Battier.  The Heat built their lead to 13 points in the second period
and were up 54-47 at halftime. James had 14 points in the half,
while Battier added 13 for the Heat.  “Early in the game, they got some easy 3s,” Durant said
in a television interview. “The only adjustment we made was
playing harder. Everybody played hard in the second half.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
