Welspun Energy Ltd., an Indian
independent power producer, plans to invest $1 billion to build
two wind farms in the state of Karnataka in the next five years.  The company, a unit of Welspun Group, said it signed
agreements with the government of Karnataka for projects with
100 megawatts and 750 megawatts of capacity, according to a
statement released today. Welspun is also  India â€™s biggest
photovoltaic developer.  The facilities to be developed in the districts of Bijapur,
Chitradurga and Belgaun contribute to the company goal of
installing 1.7 gigawatts of solar and wind parks, or enough to
supply power for as many as 9 million homes in India, according
to the statement.  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
