Philippine bonds rose on speculation
the central bank will leave borrowing costs unchanged tomorrow
after inflation eased in May. The peso advanced to the highest
level in a month.  Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas will keep its benchmark
 interest rate  at a record-low 4 percent, according to 14 of 15
economists surveyed by Bloomberg News. One expects a 25 basis
point cut. Consumer prices increased 2.9 percent in May from a
year earlier, compared with 3 percent in April, according to
official data. Inflation has been at 3 percent or less for the
last four months, compared with 2011 when it stayed above 4
percent all year.  “The favorable inflation outlook means the central bank
will likely keep its rates unchanged for the year,” said
 Jonathan Ravelas , chief market strategist at BDO Unibank Inc. in
Manila. “There is no reason for bond yields to go up.”  The yield on the 5 percent government bonds due April 2019
fell five basis points, or 0.05 percentage point, from June 11
to 5 percent as of the close in  Manila , according to Tradition
Financial Services. Local financial markets were shut yesterday.  The peso climbed 0.7 percent to 42.635 per dollar in
Manila, the strongest level since May 14, prices from Tullett
Prebon Plc show. One-month implied volatility, a measure of
exchange-rate swings used to price options, was unchanged at 6.5
percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
