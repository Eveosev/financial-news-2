Yahoo! Inc., the largest U.S. Web
portal, and CNBC said they reached an agreement to offer finance
news to television subscribers and  Internet users  as the
companies aim to increase advertising sales.  CNBC will offer its content to Sunnyvale, California-based
Yahoo’s websites, and the two companies will work together on
video production, according to a joint statement distributed by
PR Newswire today. The alliance will offer “advertising
solutions for marketers looking for access across multiple
platforms,” they said.  The agreement will allow CNBC and Yahoo to offer news
content to more than 40 million online users in the U.S., the
companies said. Television content from the Englewood Cliffs,
New Jersey-based CNBC is distributed to almost 100 million
households in the U.S., according to the statement.  Bloomberg LP, parent of Bloomberg News, is a competitor to
CNBC and Yahoo! Finance in providing financial news and
information.  CNBC is part of NBC Universal, a venture 51 percent owned
by  Comcast Corp. (CMCSA)  with the remaining 49 percent held by  General
Electric Co. (GE)   To contact the reporter on this story:
