Egyptian prosecutors have asked that
an Islamist lawmaker’s parliamentary immunity be stripped so
they can question him about an “indecent act” he allegedly
committed with a young woman in a car, a prosecutor’s office
said.  Ali Wanis, a lawmaker representing the Salafi Nour Party,
was found by police on June 7 in a parked car with a university
student on a stretch of road near the city of Tokh. Authorities
want to question him about the incident, the prosecutor’s office
in the city of Banha said late yesterday in a faxed statement.
Wanis has denied wrongdoing, saying the woman was a relative who
wasn’t feeling well, the state-run Al-Ahram reported on its
English website on June 8.  The woman who was found with him in the vehicle was ordered
detained for 15 days pending the investigation, according to the
statement.  The Nour party holds the second largest bloc of seats in
parliament’s lower house, after the Muslim Brotherhood’s Freedom
and Justice Party. Salafis adhere to a strict interpretation of
Islam.  To contact the reporter on this story:
