WPP Plc (WPP)  will consult with
shareholders about changing Chief Executive Officer  Martin Sorrell ’s remuneration after investors opposed his pay
deal in a non-binding vote, said one person with knowledge of
the matter.  About 60 percent of investors in WPP, the world’s biggest
advertising agency, voted against the proposed pay, Jeffrey
Rosen, head of the compensation committee, said at a meeting in
Dublin today. The company will now approach shareholders to
discuss options, which may include changes to performance
targets, to reconcile the two sides, the person said, declining
to be named as the plan is not public.  Investor groups including ISS and Glass Lewis urged
shareholders to vote against the plan, including a 56 percent
pay increase for Sorrell, and said the CEO’s remuneration is too
high compared with other U.K. executives, joining a wider debate
about executive pay in  Europe . Sorrell and WPP have argued that
the 67-year-old CEO’s pay, which was 6.3 million pounds ($9.8
million) in salary and bonus in 2011, should be compared to
international rivals such as  Omnicom Group Inc. (OMC)  and Publicis
Groupe SA.  WPP in April reported an increase in first-quarter sales of
7.6 percent to 2.4 billion pounds, ahead of its own budget. The
company has been offsetting a slowdown in markets hit by the
European debt crisis by acquiring digital advertising technology
and companies in faster-growing markets such as China and
Brazil. Sorrell announced more than a dozen deals in the
quarter, scooping up assets in Indonesia, Pakistan and Russia.  To contact the reporter on this story:
