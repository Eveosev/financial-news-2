Russia’s soccer team faces a six-
point penalty in the qualifying tournament for the next European
Championship and its governing body will have to pay a 120,000
euro ($150,000) fine after the behavior of its fans.  The points penalty will be suspended for “a probationary
period running from now until the end of the play-offs of the
next” regional championship, UEFA, European soccer’s ruling
body, said today in an e-mail.  The Russian federation was facing the penalties because
supporters set off fireworks and displayed “illicit banners”
during the team’s opening game June 8 with the  Czech Republic ,
UEFA said.  The Russian federation has three days to appeal the ruling.  Last night, more than 140 people needed medical treatment
and police detained 184 rioters, including 156 Poles and 25
Russians, after clashes in Warsaw before a game between the two
national teams.  Poland and Ukraine are hosting the region’s top 16 teams in
the championship this month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
