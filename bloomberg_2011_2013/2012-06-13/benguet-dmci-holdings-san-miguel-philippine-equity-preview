Shares of the following companies
had  unusual  moves in  Philippine (PASHR)  trading. Stock symbols are in
parentheses and prices are as of the close in  Manila .  The  Philippine Stock Exchange Index (PCOMP)  rose 0.7 percent to
5,109.61, the highest since May 11.  Casino operators:  Alliance Global Group Inc. (AGI)   sank
2.4 percent to 11.42 pesos, the lowest close since Feb. 28.
 Bloomberry Resorts Corp. (BLOOM)   lost 3.8 percent to 8.33
pesos, the lowest close since May 21. Investors are concerned
about a bill filed at the Senate that would change the tax
regime for casinos and require the collection of a 1,000-peso
($23) entrance fee from local players, said Richard Laneda,
analyst at CitisecOnline.com.  “The bill will raise the  tax rate  for casinos and
discourage local players,” Laneda said. Charging locals
entrance fees may hurt the grind market, which accounts for a
large part of the gaming industry, Deutsche Bank AG said in a
June 11 report.  GMA Network Inc. (GMA7)  (GMA7 PM), the nation’s second-largest
broadcaster, increased 1.8 percent to 10.18 pesos, the first
gain this month. Talks between the three main shareholders of
GMA and  Philippine Long Distance Telephone Co. (TEL)   Chairman
 Manuel Pangilinan  are heading for the “negotiation stage,” GMA
Chairman Felipe Gozon said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
