Casey’s General Stores Inc. (CASY)  fell the
most in more than three years after the operator of  convenience
stores  in the U.S. Midwest reported fourth-quarter earnings that
trailed analysts’ estimates, citing a drop in gasoline profits.  The  shares  tumbled 13 percent to $52.18 at the close in New
York, for the largest daily decline since Dec. 4, 2008. Casey’s
had the third-biggest  drop  in the  Russell 2000 Index. (RTY)  The
Ankeny, Iowa-based company’s stock has advanced 1.3 percent
this year.  Casey’s, which operates more than 1,600 locations in 11
states, said yesterday after the close of regular trading that a
decline in its gasoline profit margin during the quarter ended
April 30 reduced basic per-share earnings by about 12 cents. The
quarterly earnings were 60 cents a share, compared to a 67-cent
average of analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  “The gas margin was down nearly 2 cents per gallon from
the same period a year ago,” Chief Executive Officer Robert Myers said in a statement. The company “offset this decline
with strong sales and margin gains inside our stores.”  Revenue for the quarter was $1.75 billion, a 13 percent
increase from a year earlier.  To contact the reporter on this story:
