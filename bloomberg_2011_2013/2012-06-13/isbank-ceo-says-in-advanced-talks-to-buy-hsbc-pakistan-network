Turkiye Is Bankası AS (ISCTR)  is in talks to
buy all of  HSBC Holdings Plc. (HSBA) ’s branches in Pakistan and
negotiations are at an advanced stage, Isbank chief executive
officer Adnan Bali said.  “We consider acquisitions abroad at the right price,”
Bali told reporters at the opening of a branch in Istanbul
dedicated solely to foreign companies yesterday. “When HSBC
announced they were withdrawing from Pakistan, we wanted to be a
part of the process. Pakistan is a market Isbank is interested
in.”  Isbank, Turkey’s biggest bank by assets, told the  Istanbul
Stock Exchange  on June 7 that it’s carrying out due diligence to
buy some of HSBC’s branches in Pakistan.  HSBC, Europe’s largest bank, is in negotiations to sell
operations in Pakistan and  South Korea  as part of plans to exit
businesses that aren’t large or profitable enough, it said on
April 10. HSBC has 10 branches in the country servicing about
33,000 consumers and businesses, it said at the time.  Isbank shares rose 0.5 percent to 4.11 liras at 5:30 p.m.
in Istanbul. The main Istanbul National 100 index increased 0.1
percent.  Isbank has two units in Russia and Germany and branches in
countries including the U.K., France, Iraq and Bahrain,
according to a written statement handed to reporters yesterday.  Isbank’s Istanbul branch for foreigners started with 90
companies in its portfolio, Bali said. About 30,000 foreign
firms operate in Turkey and the branch wants to attract some of
them as well as those interested in  Turkey , he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
