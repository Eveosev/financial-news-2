Equity Bank Ltd. (EQBNK) ,  Kenya ’s biggest
lender by customers, headed for its biggest jump in more than
three years on attractive valuation relative to peers.  The stock advanced 6.2 percent to 21.5 shillings by 3:04
p.m. in Nairobi, the most since May 2009 on a closing basis.
Volume of shares traded was almost six times the stock’s three-
month average, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  “It is actually a foreign investor who has bought the bulk
of the shares,” George Bodo, a Nairobi-based independent equity
strategist, said in a phone interview today. “The current
valuations are very attractive.”  Equity Bank trades at 7.4 times reported earnings, compared
with 8.7 for  Barclays Bank of Kenya Ltd.  and 8.9 for  Standard
Chartered Bank of Kenya Ltd. , according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  “We have been seeing international pension funds and big
global funds which continue to feel they are under allocated to
sub-Saharan Africa increasing their allocation,”  Aly-Khan Satchu , chief executive officer of Nairobi-based Rich Management
Ltd., said in a phone interview today.  Banking stocks were oversold last year and began 2012 from
a low base, Satchu said.  Equity Bank tumbled 39 percent last year, which is higher
than the 30 percent drop in the NSE All Share Index. It has
surged 28 percent this year, outperforming the benchmark gauge,
which jumped 19 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
