Eton Park Capital Management LP, the
hedge fund founded by Eric Mindich, raised more than $400
million for a hedge fund that will invest in trust preferred
securities and collateralized debt obligations.  Credit Opportunities Fund II LP and its offshore affiliate
closed on May 1 with about $401 million in capital commitments,
the New York-based money management firm said in an amended
investment adviser  registration  filed last month with the U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission.  Eton Park at the end of April had about $12.3 billion in
assets under management, including the money committed to the
new credit opportunities fund. The firm also runs global and
emerging market funds that trade stocks and bonds and also make
private-equity investments.  Trust preferred securities have become a popular way for
regulated companies, such as bank holding and insurance
companies, to raise required regulatory capital, according to
the website of the  law firm  Smith, Gambrell & Russell LLP in
Atlanta. They allow banks to raise capital for regulatory
purposes and deduct interest payments for tax purposes.  Mindich was co-head of equities at Goldman Sachs Group Inc.
until 2004, when he left the  New York  based securities firm to
start Eton Park.  Jonathan Gasthalter, a spokesman for Eton Park, declined to
comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
