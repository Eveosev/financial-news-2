Derby County, the 128-year-old
English soccer team owned by a group of U.S. investors, said it
will vary ticket prices for home matches next season according
to demand in a first for  England ’s 92-club professional league.  Starting from the 2012-13 season, prices of single match-
day tickets will fluctuate depending on factors including team
performance, opponent, scheduling and the weather, the club said
in an e-mailed statement.  Derby, which was bought by Rochester, Michigan-based
General Sports & Entertainment LLC in 2008, said it has the
support of England’s Football League to pioneer the initiative
following similar moves by North American sports teams. The move
will improve attendance and revenue next season, Derby Chief
Executive Officer Tom Glick said in the statement.  “We believe we will entice new fans to Pride Park as well
as offering more options to existing supporters,” Glick said.  Derby, which was relegated from the Premier League at the
end of the 2007-08 season, had an average attendance of 26,020
at its 33,597-seat Pride Park Stadium last season, when it
finished 12th in the 24-team Championship.  The Rams have won the English league title twice, in 1972
when coached by Brian Clough and again in 1975 when led by Dave
Mackay. Clough’s son, Nigel, is the current manager.  To contact the reporter on this story:
