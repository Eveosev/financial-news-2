Russia’s OAO Transaero will offer
flights between Moscow and Paris from late July, Vedomosti
reported, citing an unidentified company representative.  Tickets will be available after the Russian and French
foreign ministries sign a final agreement, the newspaper said.
Transaero has received approval for seven flights a week on the
route, which will probably use Moscow’s Vnukovo airport,
Vedomosti reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
