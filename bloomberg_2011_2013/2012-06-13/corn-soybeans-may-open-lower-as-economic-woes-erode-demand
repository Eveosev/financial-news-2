What follows are opening calls for
U.S. grain and oilseed markets. Trading starts at 5 p.m. on the
 Chicago  Board of Trade.  -- Corn futures may open steady to 1 cent lower on the CBOT as
U.S. economic concerns eroded commodity demand, Sterling Smith,
a commodity market analyst at Citigroup Inc.’s institutional
client group, said in an e-mail.  -- Soybean futures may open 2 cents to 3 cents a bushel lower in
Chicago on global-economic concerns, Smith said. Soybean-oil
futures are expected to open 0.1 cent to 0.2 cent a pound lower,
and soybean-meal futures may drop $1 to $2 per 2,000 pounds.  -- Wheat futures may open steady to 1 cent a bushel lower on the
CBOT, the Kansas City Board of Trade and the  Minneapolis Grain
Exchange  as the “weaker stock market looks like a drag” on
prices, Smith said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
