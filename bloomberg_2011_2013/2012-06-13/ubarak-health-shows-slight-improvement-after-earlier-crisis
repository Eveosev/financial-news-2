Ousted Egyptian President  Hosni Mubarak ’s health has improved “slightly,” though he is
refusing to eat any prison food, the prison department spokesman
said today, citing the medical team overseeing Mubarak’s case.  Brigadier General Mohamed Elewa said Mubarak, who is
serving a life sentence for failing to prevent the killing of
protesters in the uprising that removed him from power, drank
some juice and ate yogurt and is only willing to communicate
with his two sons.  Mubarak, 84, is being held in the intensive care unit of
Cairo’s Tora prison. Doctors have said his health has
deteriorated since his transfer to the facility after his June 2
conviction.  The doctors overseeing his treatment said Mubarak’s mental
condition is “poor” and he trusts no one other than his sons,
businessman Alaa and onetime heir-apparent Gamal. Both are being
held nearby in the prison pending the start of a new criminal
trial on charges of illicit gains related to the sale of a bank.  To contact the reporter on this story:
