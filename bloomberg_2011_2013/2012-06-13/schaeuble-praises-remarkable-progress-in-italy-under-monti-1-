German Finance Minister  Wolfgang
Schaeuble  said Italy “has made remarkable progress in the last
six months” under Prime Minister  Mario Monti .  Italy will have the highest primary surplus in the euro
region next year if budget policies are implemented, Schaeuble
said in Berlin today. At the same time, there is scope for more
growth-friendly measures, he said.  He called for “more Europe,” urged “large steps” to be
taken now and noted that the euro region’s debt crisis can only
be solved under current law, which includes the “no-bailout
clause.” Euro bonds are only possible after deeper integration
in the common currency area, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
