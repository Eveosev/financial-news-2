Greece’s Syriza party leader Alexis Tsipras asked Greek ship owners to agree  tax policy  with
government, moderating his pledge to abolish tax breaks for ship
owners given in a speech on June 1.  “We want a national agreement with ship owners,” Tsipras
said in an interview with Bloomberg Television today. “We are
aware of the difficulty of the state to tax ship owners.” To
deal with these issue Tsipras said his party would seek
bilateral agreements with other countries.  Greece’s estimated 762 vessel owners pay no tax on
international earnings brought into Greece under rules
incorporated in the country’s constitution since 1967. The
Syriza party, which opposes Greece’s international bailout and
is shown by polls as vying for first place before a June 17
election, has said it wants to abolish the tax breaks.  Ship owners enjoy “58 different tax exemptions”, Tsipras
said. “We believe that many shipowners are understanding, and
don’t have a complete lack of empathy with Greeks, and they will
want to support  Greece  at what is a difficult moment for our
country.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
