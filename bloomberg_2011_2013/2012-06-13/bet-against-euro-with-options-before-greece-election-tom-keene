Investors should use options rather
than the  spot market  for bets the euro will decline before the
Greek elections, according to Callum Henderson, global head of
currency research for  Standard Chartered  in  Singapore .  Greeks vote again on June 17 for a new government after an
inconclusive election in May.  New Democracy , Greece’s largest
pro-bailout party, is favored by 22.7 percent of voters,
followed by anti-bailout party Syriza with 22 percent and the
socialist Pasok party, which also backs the bailout, with 11.2
percent, according to a May 31 poll of 1,200 people questioned
by Metron Analysis for Athens-based ANT1 TV.  “If you have a Greek election whereby New Democracy and
Pasok have a positive coalition, then you could see $1.30 in a
heartbeat,” Henderson said in a radio interview on “Bloomberg
Surveillance” with  Tom Keene  and Ken Prewitt. “Or you could
have the far left come in and we would have a rather dramatic
selloff next week.”  The use of options would limit losses if parties in favor
of the bailout came to power, he said.  The euro has declined 3.7 percent versus the dollar since
the poll May 6 when Syriza surged to second place in balloting.
It touched $1.2288 on June 1, the weakest since July 2010. It
traded at $1.2589 at 12:37 p.m. in  New York . Futures traders
have increased net-short positions to a record 214,418  contracts 
according Commodity Futures Trading Commission data.  Investors were paying a record 4.4 percentage point premium
to buy one-month puts, the right to sell the euro against the
dollar over calls, the right to buy, in November. That payment
has fallen to 1.81 percentage point.  The yield on the 10-year  German bund  has risen 16 basis
points, or 0.16 percentage point this week, signaling investors
are nervous about the crisis’s effect on German banks.  It “signals people are nervous about Europe period,”
Henderson said. “ Germany  is a safe haven to only some extent,
and the extent is how German banks are affected by this -- and,
of course, they will be affected.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
