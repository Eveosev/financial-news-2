Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev may revise a planned increase in natural-gas extraction
taxes for so-called independent producers of the fuel -- OAO
Novatek and  oil companies , Vedomosti said, citing an
unidentified state official.  The government will consider possible changes at a meeting
today and is favoring a formula to calculate the tax based on
domestic prices, OAO Gazprom’s export prices, inflation and the
type of gas deposit, Vedomosti said.  The government may propose raising the tax for independent
gas producers to the same level as for Gazprom, the gas pipeline
operator and exporter, as discussed in May, only if Gazprom
loses its monopoly right to ship the fuel abroad or if regulated
domestic gas prices are increased to become as profitable as
exports, Vedomosti reported.  The government is reviewing a planned jump in the
extraction tax, Deputy Prime Minister  Arkady Dvorkovich  said May
31. The government planned to raise independent producers’ tax
rate to about the same level as Gazprom’s in 2015, Deputy
Finance Minister  Sergei Shatalov  said on May 2.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
