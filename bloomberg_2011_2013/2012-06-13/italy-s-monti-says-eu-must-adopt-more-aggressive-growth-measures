European Union policy makers must
adopt more aggressive measures to boost economic growth instead
of waiting for austerity measures to run their course, Italian
Prime Minister  Mario Monti  said.  Europe and Italy are in a “particularly intense and
crucial” phase that may culminate at a meeting of EU leaders in
Brussels on June 28-29, he said in a speech to Parliament in
Rome today. Italy’s risk premium over  Germany , currently more
than 4.5 percentage points, will decline if the summit adopts a
“credible package of growth measures” he said.  Only by fostering economic growth that will allow countries
to reduce their debt levels will calm be restored to financial
markets, Monti said. Measures to mutualize debt such as through
euro bonds or infrastructure bonds or by creating a bond
redemption fund should all be part of the debate, though none of
them could be implemented this year, he said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
