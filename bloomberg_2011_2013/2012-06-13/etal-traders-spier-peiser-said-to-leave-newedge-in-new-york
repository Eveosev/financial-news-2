Joel Spier and John Peiser left
Newedge USA LLC, where they worked on the metals desk, according
to a person with direct knowledge of the matter.  Both were based in  New York , said the person, who declined
to be identified because he isn’t authorized to speak to the
media. Michael Frawley, the global head of metals at Newedge in
New York, left to join Jefferies Group Inc., a person with
knowledge of the move said last week.  Nicole Wesch, a spokeswoman for Newedge in  London , declined
to comment. The company is one of the 12 authorized to trade on
the floor of the London Metal Exchange, the world’s biggest
metals bourse. Newedge is a joint venture of Societe Generale SA
and Credit Agricole SA.  To contact the reporter on this story:
