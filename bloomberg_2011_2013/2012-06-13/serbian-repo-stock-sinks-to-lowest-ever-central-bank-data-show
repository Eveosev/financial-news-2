Serbian outstanding repo stock, or
surplus liquidity commercial banks park with the central bank,
has fallen to its lowest level since the Balkan nation adopted
inflation targeting as its monetary policy framework in 2006.  The outstanding repo stock contracted to 26.45 billion
dinars ($283.4 million) from 30.7 billion dinars on June 6 and
compared with 137.2 billion dinars at the start of 2012,
according to the  report  posted by the Belgrade-based Narodna
Banka Srbije on its website today.  The stock, which the  National Bank of Serbia  treated as an
important liquidity buffer in 2008 and 2009, when the country
was affected the most by global financial turmoil, has continued
to decline even after the central bank raised its benchmark
 interest rate , the  two-week repurchase rate  by a half-point to
10 percent on June 7.  The central bank introduced inflation targeting in August
2006 and has mainly used open market operations for reverse repo
transactions to sap excess liquidity from the banking system.  To contact the reporter on this story:
