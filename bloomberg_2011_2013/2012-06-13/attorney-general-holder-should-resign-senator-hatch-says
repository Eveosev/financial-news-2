Utah Republican  Orrin Hatch  became
at least the fifth senator to call for U.S. Attorney General
Eric Holder’s resignation as lawmakers step up criticism of his
handling of probes into a federal gun investigation and leaks of
classified information.  Hatch, who said Holder “ought to retire” during a radio
interview today on the “Mike Huckabee Show,” is the second
Republican on the Senate Judiciary Committee to say Holder
should step aside.  John Cornyn  of Texas did so as Holder
testified before the panel yesterday.  “He’s basically a nice man, but, by gosh, he’s been so
partisan in that job that I’m very concerned about him and tend
to support Senator Cornyn and others who think he ought to
retire,” Hatch said, according to a transcript from the
syndicated radio program provided by his office.  Holder told lawmakers yesterday that he acted appropriately
and doesn’t have “any intention of resigning.”  Dozens of  House Republicans  have called for Holder to quit
and 115 have signed a “no-confidence” resolution.  To contact the reporter on this story:
