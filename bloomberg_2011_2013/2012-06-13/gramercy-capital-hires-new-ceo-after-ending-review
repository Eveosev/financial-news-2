Gramercy Capital Corp. (GKK) , a  New York- 
based company that finances commercial real estate, hired a new
chief executive officer and said it will remain independent
after a review of its management and strategy.  The company will focus on single-tenant lease investments
that will initially be funded from existing finances, according
to a statement today by Gramercy, which said it later may seek
to raise additional debt and equity. The review was started in
response to “changes in market conditions,” Gramercy said.  Gordon F. Dugan will become CEO and a member of the board
on July 1, the company said. Dugan, who has more than 20 years
of senior management experience in the real estate industry, was
CEO for W.P. Carey & Co. LLC for five years. Benjamin P. Harris
will was named president and Nicholas L. Pell will become
managing director. The three worked together at W.P. Carey.  Gramercy fell 6.4 percent to $2.36 as of 10:16 a.m. in  New
York .  The company last year solicited bids for a buyout after
agreeing to settle $549.7 million in mortgage debt with lenders,
people with knowledge of the matter said in November. Gramercy,
which had been in default on its loans, became current on its
debt payments.  “Gramercy is well positioned to capitalize on
opportunities now emerging in the marketplace,” Dugan, who will
replace Roger Cozzi as CEO, said in the statement.  The company said it expects to provide an update on the
investment strategy and review by Aug. 9, in connection with the
release of second-quarter financial results.  To contact the reporter on this story:
