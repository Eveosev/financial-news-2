SolarCity Corp., a U.S. developer of
rooftop solar systems, and  U.S. Bancorp (USB)  created a tax-equity
fund that will finance as much as $250 million in power
projects.  The fund is the sixth and largest created by the companies
since they began working together three years ago, San Mateo,
California-based Solar City said today in a statement. It will
support residential, commercial and government solar projects.  The financial company expects to invest $440 million in
renewable energy this year and about 80 percent of that will be
for solar projects, Darren Van’t Hof, director of renewable-
energy investments for  U.S. Bank , said in an interview.  “It’s really the level of maturity in the industry that
we’re comfortable with,” he said. The Minneapolis-based bank
didn’t say how much it invested in the fund.  Google Inc., the world’s biggest search-engine company,
invested $280 million in June 2011 in a similar SolarCity fund.  To contact the reporter on this story:
