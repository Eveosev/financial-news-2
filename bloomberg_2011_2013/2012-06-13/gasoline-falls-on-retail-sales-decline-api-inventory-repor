Gasoline rose as the Energy
Department reported that demand for the motor fuel surged last
week to the highest level since August.  Futures gained as  deliveries  to wholesalers increased
482,000 barrels, or 5.6 percent, to 9.13 million barrels a day.
Inventories fell unexpectedly even as refiners pushed rates to
the highest level since August 2007.  “Demand is up and you’re coming into gasoline season, you
have utilization up and products drawing,” said  David Pursell ,
a managing director at Tudor Pickering Holt & Co. LLC in
Houston.  Gasoline for July delivery rose 0.52 cent to settle at
$2.6554 a gallon on the  New York Mercantile Exchange .  Prices touched $2.6922 before paring gains, and heating oil
slid to a 16-month low as borrowing costs rose in  Italy  and
Germany and euro-region  industrial production  fell a second
month in April. Greek voters go to the polls June 17 to decide
whether to honor that country’s international bailout.  The  International Energy Agency  reduced its forecast for
2012 crude consumption amid uncertainty whether OPEC would leave
output unchanged as the organization is meeting in Vienna to
decide on production levels for the second half of the year.  “I don’t think the market has confidence OPEC is going to
reduce production,” said  Andrew Lebow , a senior vice president
at Jefferies Bache LLC in  New York . “The Greek elections are a
huge unknown. This market is going to be on the defense. People
want to sell rallies.”  Supplies Drop  Gasoline  supplies  fell 1.72 million barrels last week to
201.8 million, according to department data.  Total product supplied  rose 6.5 percent to 19.4 million
barrels a day, the highest level since November.  “You need a couple of weeks for this to be a real strong
bull run, but it bodes well for summer with reasonably strong
demand numbers,” said  Sander Cohan , a global transportation
fuels analyst and principal with Energy Security Analysis Inc.
in Wakefield,  Massachusetts . “It will keep gasoline prices from
sagging further.”  Refinery utilization rose 1 percentage point to 92 percent.
Gasoline production jumped 5.5 percent to 9.55 million barrels a
day, the highest level since the week ended Aug. 26. Distillate
output increased 1 percent to 4.72 million barrels a day, the
highest level since Jan. 6.  Futures were higher before the report’s 10:30 a.m. release
in  Washington  on speculation that a drop in retail sales
increases the chances that the  Federal Reserve  will act to
stimulate the economy.  Retail Sales  The Commerce Department reported that sales sank 0.2
percent following a similar drop in April that was previously
reported as a gain. The policy-setting  Federal Open Market
Committee  is scheduled to meet June 19-20.  “Weak retail sales and a softening economy increases the
chances of quantitative easing,” said  Phil Flynn , senior market
analyst at Price Futures Group in  Chicago .  Inventories of diesel and heating oil fell 63,000 barrels
to 120 million. Demand rose 306,000 barrels, or 9.1 percent, to
an average 3.69 million barrels a day. Consumption over the past
four weeks was 4.6 percent below a year earlier.  Distillate exports  totaled 1.12 million barrels a day last
week, 30 percent above year-earlier levels.  “Distillate exports is an even more bullish signal,”
Cohan said. “Distillate inventories are so low relative to
where they’ve been and runs so high, and there is this foreign
demand that is sucking fuel out of the country.”  Heating oil for July delivery declined 1.06 cents, or 0.4
percent, to $2.6109 a gallon on the exchange. It was the lowest
settlement since January 2011. Crude oil fell 70 cents to $82.62
a barrel, the lowest close for the front-month contract since
Oct. 6.  Regular gasoline at the pump, averaged nationwide, fell 0.3
cent to $3.539 a gallon yesterday, according to AAA. It was the
lowest price since Feb. 17.  To contact the reporters on this story:
