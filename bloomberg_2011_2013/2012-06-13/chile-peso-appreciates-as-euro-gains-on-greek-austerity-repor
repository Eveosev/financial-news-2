Chile’s peso gained on speculation
that U.S. and European policy makers will seek to stimulate
economic growth and as the euro appreciated on a report that
Greece may seek to adjust its austerity program.  The currency rose 0.4 percent to 502.23 per  U.S. dollar .
The peso has appreciated 4 percent since reaching a five-month
intraday low of 522.79 per U.S. dollar on June 1.  “There is expectation of new stimulus measures,” said
Ronald Volpi, the head of spot currency trading at EuroAmerica
Corredores de Bolsa SA in Santiago.  The price of copper, Chile’s main export, rose as much as 1
percent after machine orders in  Japan  increased at more than
three times the pace estimated by analysts, before paring its
advance to 0.1 percent.  A Greek vote on June 17 may show support for pro-bailout
party  New Democracy  exceeding that of Syriza, which has called
for renegotiating terms of the rescue funds, according to a poll
by Kapa SA. Financial Times Deutschland reported that European
leaders may consider relaxing the terms for  Greece ’s austerity
program after the elections, without citing anyone.  International investors in the Chilean peso forwards market
had a net short peso position of $10.3 billion on June 11, the
second-largest on record. Local investors excluding banks and
brokers had a $17.3 billion long peso position.  Banks and brokers had a net short peso position of
$6.9 billion in the forwards market and a $7.2 billion long peso
position in the  spot market .  To contact the reporter on this story:
