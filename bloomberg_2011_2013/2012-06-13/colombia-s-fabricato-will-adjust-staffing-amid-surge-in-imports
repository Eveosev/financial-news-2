Fabricato SA (FABRI) , a Colombian textile
maker, said it plans to adjust the number of workers it employs
amid an increase in clothing imports.  Fabricato made the announcement in a regulatory  filing  late
yesterday. “Clothing imports into the country are at worrying
levels right now, and that lead us to be much more prudent with
our local production levels,” said the company’s president Juan Carlos Cadavid in a telephone interview. “Production may be
affected by imports.”  Cadavid said he wasn’t sure whether the company would add
or cut workers. He said the decision depends on what impact the
increased imports has on Fabricato’s production. The company
employs about 5,400 workers, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
