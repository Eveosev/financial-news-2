An associate of the al Shabaab
terrorist organization in  Somalia  pleaded guilty in  New York  to
providing material support to the group and receiving military
training in 2009.  Mohamed Ibrahim Ahmed, 38, pleaded guilty to two counts of
conspiracy and faces as long as 10 years in prison, according to
a statement today by U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara in New York.
Ahmed, an Eritrean native who lived in Sweden before going to
Somalia, was arrested in  Nigeria  in 2009 and transferred to the
U.S. the following year.  “Mohamed Ibrahim Ahmed traveled a long way from his home
in Sweden to Somalia, where he took up the cause of al Shabaab,
a deadly terrorist organization and sworn enemy of the  United
States  and its people,” Bharara said in the statement.  While he was in Somalia, Ahmed contributed about 3,000 euro
($3,772.50) to al Shabaab and was trained to make and detonate
bombs, according to prosecutors. Al Shabaab seeks to destabilize
the Somali government and to drive foreign troops out of the
country, according to the statement. The group has recruited
foreign fighters, including from the U.S., prosecutors said.  Sean Maher, a lawyer for Ahmed, didn’t immediately return a
call to his office for comment on the guilty plea.  The case is U.S. v. Ahmed, 10-131, U.S. District Court,
Southern District of New York (Manhattan.)  To contact the reporters on this story:
