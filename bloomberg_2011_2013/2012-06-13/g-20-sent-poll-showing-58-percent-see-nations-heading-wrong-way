A majority of people in thirteen
developed and emerging economies think their nations are heading
in the wrong direction, an  opinion poll  prepared ahead of next
week’s Group of 20 summit for the International Trade Union
Confederation showed.  Fifty-eight percent of respondents to the TNS survey said
their countries need to change course and 66 percent said future
generations will be worse off, the ITUC said in a report. G-20
leaders begin their annual summit on June 18 in the Mexican
resort of Los Cabos.  The leaders meet amid signs the world economy is suffering
its weakest period since the end of the global recession in
2009. Sixty-seven percent of those questioned said international
banks have too much influence on economic policy-making and one
in three said their jobs are less secure than two years ago.  The poll “shows the public are not with their governments,
are not buying the austerity message and are deeply
pessimistic,” said  Sharan Burrow , the ITUC’s general secretary.  To contact the reporter on this story:
