Greece ’s election could be
disruptive for financial markets if the country votes to abandon
the conditions attached to its bailout, Canadian Finance
Minister  Jim Flaherty  said.  Flaherty, speaking to reporters in Ottawa, said he has been
having phone calls with his colleagues from the Group of 20
nations, and officials are concerned about the vote.  “It could result in a disruptive moment if the Greek
election were to result in a disassociation of Greece from the
pact that our European colleagues have developed with respect to
austerity,” Flaherty said. “We’ll deal with it as it comes.”  Greeks vote a second time in six weeks on June 17 after a
May 6 ballot failed to yield a government. The Syriza party, led
by Alexis Tsipras, has promised to abrogate the terms of the 240
billion-euro ($303 billion) bailout from the European
Commission,  European Central Bank  and  International Monetary
Fund , which calls for cuts that risk deepening the country’s
worst recession since World War II.  The vote takes place one day before leaders from the Group
of 20 nations meet in Los Cabos,  Mexico , for a two-day summit.
Finance ministers, including Flaherty, will also attend, with
Flaherty saying he’ll arrive on June 17th.  Flaherty said the major issue will be “global economic
fragility and the European situation.” While he had a “number
of phone calls” with his G-20 counterparts, “particularly non-
European members,” there is no formal meeting of finance
ministers planned separate from the summit, Flaherty said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
