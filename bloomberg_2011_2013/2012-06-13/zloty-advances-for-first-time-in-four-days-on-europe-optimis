The Polish zloty advanced following
its three-day losing streak on speculation a new Greek
government will seek amendments to its bailouts after elections.  The zloty appreciated 0.4 percent to 4.3248 per euro as of
2:33 p.m. in Warsaw. It was the fourth steepest gain among more
than 20 emerging-market currencies tracked by Bloomberg. The
yield on five-year notes fell four basis points, or 0.04
percentage point, to 4.92 percent.  European leaders may consider relaxing  Greece ’s austerity
program after the June 17 election, the Financial Times
Deutschland reported. The zloty is recovering from its worst
decline in eight months in May sparked by concern that Greece
will exit the euro area, which is  Poland ’s biggest export
market. Traders increased their bets for swings against the euro
in the next month to 12.9 percent, the highest since Dec. 6,
based on a gauge of implied volatility used for pricing option
contracts on Bloomberg.  “We are seeing increased volatility on the zloty market,”
Aleksandra Bluj, an analyst at PKO Bank Polski SA wrote in an e-
mailed note to clients. “The restless mood on the global market
continues to be the main drive for the zloty.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
