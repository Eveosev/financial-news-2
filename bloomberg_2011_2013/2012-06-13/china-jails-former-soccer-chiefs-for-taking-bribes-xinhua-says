Two former Chinese soccer chiefs
were each sentenced to 10 1/2 years in prison for taking bribes
and four ex-national team players were given shorter sentences
as part of a crackdown on corruption, the official Xinhua  News
Agency  reported.  Nan Yong and Xie Yalong, who both served as director of the
government-run Chinese Football Administrative Center, were also
fined 200,000 yuan ($31,400), Xinhua reported today, citing
court judgments.  Nan and Xie are the highest-ranking officials to be
sentenced since  China  began a nationwide campaign in March 2009
to root out graft in local soccer. They told the courts they
need to consult with their respective attorneys before deciding
whether to appeal the verdicts, Xinhua said.  Former Chinese national team manager Yu Shaohui received
the same jail term for taking bribes, Xinhua reported. Li
Dongsheng, the administrative center’s former technical
director, was sentenced to nine years for bribery and
embezzlement, according to the news agency.  Shen Si, Qi Hong, Jiang Jin and Li Ming, who all played for
China’s national team, were each sentenced to at least 5 1/2
years in prison for fixing a Chinese league game, Xinhua
reported. Each of the former players was also fined 500,000
 yuan , Xinhua reported.  Dozens of players, coaches, referees and officials have
been detained and sentenced in the campaign, undermining
soccer’s popularity in China. The national team made its only
appearance at the sport’s four-yearly  World Cup  in 2002.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
