Morocco ’s citrus yields may slide 20
percent to 30 percent from the 2011-12 season after a heat wave
in May caused greater-than-usual losses of developing fruit, the
 Agriculture Ministry  said.  Peak temperatures in the first 20 days of May exceeded 40
degrees Celsius (104 degrees Fahrenheit), the ministry wrote in
a  statement  on its website today. The heat coincided with a
growth stage when citrus trees naturally shed fruit, worsening
losses, the ministry said.  Morocco picked 1.82 million metric tons of citrus fruit in
2011-12 that included 976,000 tons of oranges, about 10 percent
of production in the Mediterranean region,  data  from the
European Fresh Produce Association show. A 30 percent drop would
result in the country’s smallest citrus crop since 2007-08.  “It’s very early to determine the exact or definitive
extent of the damages, as the phenomenon of fall continues
through to the end of June,” the ministry wrote. “The
situation could see a positive development because of the
compensation effect, formation of large-sized fruit, that could
mitigate the effect of the excessive fall of fruit.”  Farmers reported citrus-tree fruit losses of 60 percent to
80 percent, compared with a usual rate of 50 percent, according
to the ministry.  To contact the reporter on this story:
