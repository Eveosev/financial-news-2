Polish bonds rose, pushing yields to
the lowest in more than a month, after a report showed the
inflation rate fell more than estimated.  The yield on two-year notes declined four basis points, or
0.04 percentage point, to 4.74 percent, the weakest level since
May 10, as of 3:41 p.m. in Warsaw, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  Polish  consumer-price growth  fell to 3.6 percent in May,
the slowest annual pace in 15 months, the statics office said
today. It was below the 3.8 percent median estimate of 26
economists in a Bloomberg survey, following a report last month
that showed European Union’s largest eastern economy expanded at
its slowest pace in two years in the first quarter.  “Today’s inflation coupled with deteriorating data from
the real economy increase a chance that the central bank will
stick to its wait-and-see strategy and keep rates unchanged till
the end of the year,” Piotr Piekos, an economist at  Bank Pekao
SA (PEO) , wrote in an e-mailed comment to clients.  The Polish central bank unexpectedly raised  interest rates 
last month and warned it may tighten policy further if inflation
fails to slow and the economy avoids a sharp slowdown.  Polish central bank policy maker Jan Winiecki said he is
“concerned” about a decline in economic growth in the first
quarter, adding that the economic slowdown should be taken into
account while setting interest rates in an interview today on
TVN CNBC.  Six-month forward rate agreements fell to seven basis
points below the three-month Warsaw Interbank Offered Rate,
indicating a growing chance of a rate increase by the end of
this year, according to  data  compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
