France  is considering giving
financial support to the car industry, Industry Minister  Arnaud Montebourg  said in response to a call for aid from  Renault SA. (RNO)   “We’re working in that direction,” Montebourg said when
asked about possible assistance for automakers at a press
conference today in Paris.  Renault and rival PSA Peugeot Citroen are struggling with
excess capacity as demand for new vehicles shrinks across
Europe. Renault’s sales have dropped about 21 percent from
January to April, compared with a 14 percent decline at Peugeot,
the European Automobile Manufacturers’ Association estimates.
Renault Chief Operating Officer Carlos Tavares yesterday said he
would welcome “any kind of measure of support.”  “We are completely open and in favour of such a step,”
whether it takes the form of incentives for new car buyers or
tax breaks for more fuel-efficient vehicles, he said at a press
conference at Renault’s logistics center near Paris.  Peugeot  shares  gained as much as 1.72 percent in Paris
trading, erasing earlier losses, after Montebourg’s comment. The
stock hit a 23-year low yesterday amid concern about demand in
 Europe , where Peugeot ranks as the No. 2 carmaker, as well as
overseas. Peugeot traded at 7.57 euros at 1:47 p.m. in Paris.  Renault also regained ground after the remarks. The stock
fell 3.7 percent to 31.14 euros at 1:48 p.m. local time,
compared with a drop of as much as 5.3 percent earlier today.  To contact the reporters on this story:
