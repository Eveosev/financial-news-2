Crude-oil options volatility fell as
underlying futures slid to an eight-month low after reports
signaled economic softening in the U.S. and in the 17-nation
euro group.  Implied volatility for at-the-money options expiring in
August, a measure of expected price swings in futures and a
gauge of options prices, was 35.1 percent at 3:49 p.m. on the
 New York Mercantile Exchange , down from 36.6 yesterday.
Volatility reached 40.6 on June 1, the highest since Oct. 20.  Crude oil for July delivery fell 70 cents to $82.62 a
barrel on the Nymex, the lowest settlement since Oct. 6. Oil for
delivery in August also lost 70 cents to $82.92.  Oil fell as equities declined after a Commerce Department
report showed weakening U.S.  retail sales  and as euro-area
 industrial production  dropped for a second month in April. The
Standard & Poorâ€™s 500 Index was down 0.8 percent at 3:56 p.m. in
 New York .  The most active oil options in electronic trading today
were August $60 puts, which were unchanged at 7 cents a barrel
at 4:14 p.m. with 5,492 lots trading. July $80 puts were the
second-most active options, with 4,273 lots changing hands as
they declined 5 cents to 23 cents.  Puts accounted for 55 percent of electronic trading volume.
One contract covers 1,000 barrels of crude.  The exchange distributes real-time data for electronic
trading and releases information the next business day on floor

previous session. July $75 puts were the most actively traded,
with 6,578 lots changing hands. They fell 3 cents to 2 cents.

to $2.24 on volume of 5,971.  Open interest was highest for December $80 puts with 50,805
contracts. Next were December $100 calls with 39,967 lots and
