Spain â€™s core inflation rate remained
at the lowest since 2010 amid a deepening recession as the
government stepped up austerity measures to try to retain access
to financial markets.  Core consumer prices , which exclude energy and fresh food,
rose 1.1 percent from a year earlier, matching the April rate,
the National Statistics Institute in  Madrid  said today. The
figure was in line with the median forecast of five economists
surveyed by Bloomberg News. Headline inflation, based on
European Union calculations, was 1.9 percent, matching an
initial estimate on May 30.  The fourth  euro-region member  to seek a bailout since June
9, Spain is cutting spending and raising taxes to shrink the
 budget deficit  by 40 percent this year. The unemployment rate
has risen to 24.3 percent, the highest in the euro zone, as the
recession deepened in the second quarter.  To contact the reporter on this story:
