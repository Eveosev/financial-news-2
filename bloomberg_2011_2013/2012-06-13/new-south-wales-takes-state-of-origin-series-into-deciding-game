New South Wales defeated Queensland
16-12 to take rugby league’s State of Origin into a deciding
third game as it seeks to avoid a record-extending seventh
straight series loss.  New South Wales rebounded from last month’s 18-10 loss in
 Melbourne  by outscoring Queensland three tries to two in front
of a crowd of 83,110 at Sydney’s ANZ Stadium. The best-of-three
contest concludes July 4 at Brisbane’s Suncorp Stadium.  Brett Stewart touched down twice and Josh Morris once for
the Blues, who last won a series in 2005. Todd Carney added a
conversion and penalty goal for NSW.  Queensland, which has won 14 of the 20 matches since
beginning its run of series victories in 2006, got tries from
Ben Hannant and Greg Inglis, both converted by Jonathan
Thurston. Inglis’s score extended his record try tally in the
State of Origin to 14.  To contact the reporters on this story:
