Economic growth  in the Group of 20
nations accelerated in the first quarter, led by Germany,
Australia, Japan, Korea and Mexico, according to the
Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development.  Gross domestic product rose 0.8 percent after a 0.7 percent
increase in the final three months of 2011, the Paris-based
organization said in an e-mailed statement today. Growth slowed
to 1.8 percent in  China , while the Italian and U.K. economies
shrank and the European Union stagnated.  “This small pick-up in aggregate G-20 GDP growth still
masks diverging patterns among the world’s largest economies,”
the OECD said.  G-20 leaders are scheduled to meet on June 18 in the
Mexican resort of Los Cabos as the crisis in the euro area
escalates.  Spain  became the fourth member of the 17-nation
currency region to request a bailout last week, intensifying
concerns that the currency zone could break up.  To contact the reporter on this story:
