The board of the  California Public
Employees’ Retirement System , the largest U.S. pension fund,
increased premiums it charges retirees for health-care insurance
by 9.6 percent.  Without discussion, the panel unanimously voted to charge
members an average $30 a month more. The changes are expected to
raise total premiums next year by an average of 9.6 percent for
its 1.3 million members, following a 4.1 percent boost this
year.  Calpers, as the $225 billion fund is known, says it is the
largest employer buyer of health benefits in  California , and the
nation’s second-largest public purchaser after the federal
government. It spent $6.67 billion in 2011 on health benefits.  “We introduced a number of initiatives over the past three
years to help stabilize rates, but today’s rates reflect the
overall continuing upswing of health-care costs,” Priya Mathur,
chairwoman of the committee, said yesterday in a  statement . “We
tried as much as possible to keep the overall increases close to
the national health-care cost inflation rate of more than 7
percent projected for next year.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
