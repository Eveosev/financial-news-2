Capital One Financial Corp. (COF)  will
look to “meaningfully” increase its dividend next year and may
examine other ways of returning capital to shareholders, Chief
Financial Officer Gary Perlin said.  Starting in 2013, the bank will be “looking to really
deliver on this intention to increase our dividend meaningfully
and look at other ways of returning capital,” Perlin said today
at an investor conference in New York. He said the company may
consider repurchasing shares.  Capital One’s current quarterly  dividend  is 5 cents. The
lender expects to have a Tier 1 common ratio of roughly 9.5
percent and will make its case to regulators that it has enough
capital to return some to shareholders, Perlin said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
