South Korea’s won advanced and bonds
fell as unemployment in Asia’s fourth-biggest economy dropped to
a four-month low and global stock markets rallied.  The  jobless rate  slipped to 3.2 percent in May from 3.4
percent a month earlier, statistics office data showed today.
The  Kospi (KOSPI)  Index gained 0.3 percent and shares in the U.S.
climbed after Federal  Reserve Bank  of Chicago President  Charles
Evans  said he would support measures to generate faster job
growth in the world’s largest economy.  “The won was supported by U.S. stocks gaining on
speculation there may be another round of monetary easing,”
said Kim Do Hee, a Seoul-based currency trader at Australia &
New Zealand Banking Group Ltd. “The currency trimmed gains in
the afternoon as some investors covered their short positions on
the dollar due to lingering uncertainties in the financial
market.” A short position is a bet an asset will decline.  The won advanced 0.2 percent to 1,168.35 per dollar at the
close in  Seoul , after gaining as much as 0.4 percent, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg. Its one-month implied volatility,
a measure of exchange-rate swings used to price options, dropped
35 basis points to 10.50 percent.  The  yield  on Spain’s 10-year sovereign debt touched 6.83
percent yesterday, the highest since 1997, raising the specter
of a bailout for the government.  The  International Monetary Fund  cut South Korea’s growth
forecast for this year to 3.25 percent from 3.5 percent, citing
“substantial” uncertainty due to Europe’s deepening debt
turmoil, according to a statement yesterday. South Korea’s
Finance Minister Bahk Jae Wan said today that the government is
enhancing monitoring to prepare for shocks.  The yield on the government’s 3.5 percent bonds due March
2017 rose four basis points, or 0.04 percentage point, to 3.44
percent, Korea Exchange Inc. prices show. Three-year debt
futures fell 0.03 to 104.74 and one-year  interest-rate swaps  was
little changed at 3.31 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
