Indian Prime Minister  Manmohan Singh 
is one of three candidates proposed as the next president by two
of the nation’s most powerful regional parties amid jockeying
for the post before next month’s election.  Leaders of Trinamool Congress Mamata Banerjee and the
Samajwadi Party Mulayam Singh Yadav also proposed former
president A.P.J. Abdul Kalam and former speaker of the lower
house Somnath Chatterjee. The leaders were speaking at a press
conference in New Delhi after meeting with  Sonia Gandhi , the
head of the ruling Congress Party.  The leaders refused to back Congress’ choice of either
Finance Minister Pranab Mukherjee or Vice-President Hamid Ansari.  The winner of the elections on July 19 will hold the
largely ceremonial post as the country’s head of state. The
president oversees the creation of a government in the event of
a hung parliament following elections and has the title of
supreme commander of the armed forces.  To contact the reporter on this story:
