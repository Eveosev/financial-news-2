maker, rose 1.5 percent to NT$350, snapping a four-day slide.
President and Chief Executive Officer Peter Chou told investors
at its annual shareholder meeting yesterday the company hopes to
see better results in the second half as new products boost
momentum. HTC’s direction and strategy is correct, he said.  Sino-American Silicon Products Inc. (5483)  (5483 TT), the provider
of silicon used in solar cells, added 3.5 percent to NT$50.30,
the biggest gain since May 4. The company plans to raise wages

people to meet strong demand, it said.  Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (2330)  (2330 TT), the

percent to NT$13.65, the lowest close since Dec. 4, 2008.
