Total SA (FP) , Europe’s third-largest oil
company, ordered 15,000 gas-monitoring units from a Scottish
company to help clients manage energy use.  Total through its U.K. unit Total Gas & Power Ltd. agreed
to buy the  Smart Meter Systems Plc (SMS)  units over a three-year
period, the Glasgow-based company said today in an statement.  Commercial and industrial customers will be supplied the
units, which will provide 30-minute gas consumption data to
allow clients to monitor use and help lower energy bills.  The U.K. government expects 53 million smart meters to be
installed in homes and businesses across the country by 2019 to
reduce energy waste and cut power bills.  To contact the reporter on this story:
