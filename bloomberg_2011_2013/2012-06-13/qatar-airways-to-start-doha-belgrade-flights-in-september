Qatar Airways  will start flights
between Doha and Belgrade, the capital city of Serbia, as of
September, the Balkan nation’s Civil Aviation Directorate said,
after its officials signed a bilateral air-traffic pact.  The accord “is a very modern act that will lead to traffic
liberalization between Serbia and  Qatar ,” the Civil Aviation
Directorate said in an e-mail today.  The pact is “similar to open skies agreements we have here
in Europe and that means any airlines from Qatar which may want
to fly to Belgrade will be granted a license,” said Katarina
Andric-Milosavljevic, the spokeswoman for the directorate.  To contact the reporter on this story:
