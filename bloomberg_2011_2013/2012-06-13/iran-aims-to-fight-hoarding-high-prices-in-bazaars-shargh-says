Iran , seeking to combat high prices
and the hoarding of goods by shop owners, will increase the
numbers of inspectors at bazaars,  Shargh  reported, citing a top
commerce official.  Some 10,000 inspectors will be sent to monitor the bazaars,
said Javad Taghavi, the deputy minister of Industries, Mines and
Commerce, according to the Tehran-based newspaper. The report
didn’t specify whether the measure was implemented nationwide or
in the capital, Tehran, alone.  The ministry has set up a phone number for Iranians to
report and file complaints, Taghavi said, according to the
newspaper. Offenders will be punished, he added.  International sanctions aimed at curbing  Iran’s nuclear
program  have targeted trade and banking, pushing up the price of
goods inside the country. Iran’s inflation rate accelerated to
22.2 percent in the 12 months through the Iranian month of
Ordibehesht, which ended May 20, from 21.8 percent the previous
month, the central bank said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
