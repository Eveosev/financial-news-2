Arunma Oteh, director-general of
 Nigeria ’s Securities and Exchange Commission, was sent on
“compulsory leave” to enable an independent investigation of
allegations of mismanagement, the market regulator said.  The decision followed an audit of spending to mark 50 years
of the capital market and a recommendation to the board “that
the key actors in the management of the funds should be asked to
step aside to allow an unhindered investigation,” Edosa Kennedy
Aigbekaen, the secretary to the commission, said today in an e-
mailed statement.  Oteh didn’t immediately respond to an e-mailed request for
comment.  A former vice president at the  African Development Bank ,
Oteh took over in January 2010 as head of the market regulator
in sub-Saharan  Africa ’s second-biggest economy following a stock
market crash in the wake of the global financial crisis. Oteh
initiated a reform process she said was aimed at ending abuses
including price manipulation and weak corporate governance.  To contact the reporters on this story:
