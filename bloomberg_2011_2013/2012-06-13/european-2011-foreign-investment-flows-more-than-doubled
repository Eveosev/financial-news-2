The European Union’s foreign direct
investment flows more than doubled last year after a
“significant” drop in 2010 as money between the U.S. and the
27-nation bloc surged, the EU’s statistics office said.  The EU invested more money in all major partners except for
 Russia , where FDI declined by 2 billion euros ($2.5 billion)
Luxembourg-based Eurostat said in a statement today. Outflows
rose to 370 billion euros in 2011 after falling by more than
half to 146 billion euros in 2010, while FDI into the bloc
climbed to 225 billion euros from 104 billion euros.  Half of the investments into the EU came from the U.S.,
which provided 115 billion euros, followed by  Switzerland  at 34
billion euros. The EU invested 111 billion euros in the U.S., 59
billion euros in the “offshore financial centers” such as
Liechtenstein, Gibraltar and Bermuda, 32 billion euros in
Switzerland, 28 billion euros in  Brazil  and 18 billion euros in
 China , according to Eurostat.  Luxembourg was the largest EU investor and the main
recipient last year, with outgoing investments of 110 billion
euros and flows into the country of 86 billion euros. The U.K.
invested 89 billion euros and received 14 billion euros while
 Germany  invested 34 billion euros and got 11 billion euros.  Eurostat didn’t elaborate about the reasons behind the
recovery of FDI.  To contact the reporter on this story:
