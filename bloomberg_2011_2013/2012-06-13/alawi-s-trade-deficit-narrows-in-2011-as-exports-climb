Malawi’s trade deficit narrowed to
107.9 billion kwacha ($400 million) last year as exports
climbed, the Ministry of Economic Planning and Development said.  The shortfall eased from 121.9 billion kwacha in 2010, the
ministry said in a report distributed today in the commercial
capital, Blantyre. Exports surged 38 percent to 223.4 billion
kwacha, while imports increased 16 percent to 330.1 billion
kwacha, according to the report.  Economic growth in Malawi, which earns about 60 percent of
foreign currency from tobacco exports, slowed to 4.3 percent in
2011 from 6.7 percent in the previous year. The economy is
forecast by the government to expand 5.7 percent in 2013 as
farming output expands and a foreign currency shortage eases,
Finance Minister Ken Lipenga said on June 8.  Malawi’s central bank raised its benchmark  interest rate  by
3 percentage points to 16 percent on May 11, days after
devaluing the local currency by a third against the dollar. That
enabled the government to meet conditions set by the
 International Monetary Fund  for a resumption in financial aid.  To contact the reporter on this story:
