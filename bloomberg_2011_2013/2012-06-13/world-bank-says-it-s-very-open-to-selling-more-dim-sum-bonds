The  World Bank  may issue yuan-
denominated bonds in Hong Kong again when borrowing costs become
more favorable, according to Michael Bennett, its head of
derivatives and structured finance.  International Finance Corp., a member of the World Bank
Group, sold 150 million  yuan  ($23.5 million) of five-year Dim
Sum bonds with a 1.8 percent coupon in January 2011, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg. The debt yielded 2.35 percent
yesterday. The  average yield  on yuan bonds in Hong Kong climbed
50 basis points to 5.53 percent this quarter, according to an
index by Bank of China Ltd.  “In principle, we are very open to selling more Dim Sum,”
Bennett, who is based in Washington D.C., said in an interview
in  Hong Kong . “For us, because we are a U.S. dollar-based
institution, our ability to issue in any currency is probably
dependent on after-swap costs in U.S. dollars. The opportunity
comes and goes based on that level.”  The World Bank will start selling an emerging-market bond
fund in Hong Kong tomorrow. Some 85 percent of the fund will be
World Bank notes denominated in the currencies of emerging-
market countries, with the remainder allocated to U.S.
Treasuries, Chinese government debt and short-term  bank deposits .  BOCHK Asset Management Ltd., which was hired to manage the
fund, is looking to market it in Taiwan, Malaysia and  Europe ,
said Au King Lun, chief executive officer of the asset manager.  To contact the reporter on this story:
