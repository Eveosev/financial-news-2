Hector Sants, chief executive
officer of the U.K. Financial Services Authority, said moving
financial regulation powers to the  Bank of England  may make the
job of governor too big for one person.  “We could be concerned that the operational task given to
the governor as an individual -- and of course that will be a
new governor by the time these powers are actually fully in
place -- will be just too great,” Sants said in a  BBC  interview
today. “The risk is more that operationally this is going to be
too great for one person to manage.”  Sants will step down from his post at the end of this month
after leading the regulator through much of the global financial
crisis. He also said the run on Northern Rock Plc in 2007 could
have been prevented if the government and the Bank of England
had taken his advice to provide liquidity support to  Lloyds
Banking Group Plc (LLOY)  to buy the lender.  “I think that would have made a difference, it would have
avoided the queues at  Northern Rock  and would have changed the
general climate in relation to the old building society sector
that had moved into the banking sector,” he told the BBC.  To contact the reporter on this story:
