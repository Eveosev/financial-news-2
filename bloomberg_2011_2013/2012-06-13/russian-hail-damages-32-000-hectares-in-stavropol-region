Hail damaged about 32,000 hectares
(79,074 acres) of fields and gardens on June 8 in  Russia ’s
southern Stavropol region, the country’s second-biggest crop
producer last year, the local agriculture ministry  said .  The damaged area included 300 hectares of gardens in one
district, while the rest was mostly fields of grain and other
plantings, according to a statement on the ministry’s website.
Plantings were destroyed totally on more than 3,200 hectares,
the ministry said.  Stavropol accounted for 8.7 percent of Russia’s total grain
crops in 2011 after farmers there harvested 8.2 million metric
tons of cereals, according to state statistics data. Krasnodar
was the biggest-producing region.  To contact the reporter on this story:
