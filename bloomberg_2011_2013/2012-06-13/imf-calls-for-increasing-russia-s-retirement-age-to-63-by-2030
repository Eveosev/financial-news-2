Russia should overhaul its pension
system and gradually increase the  retirement age  for men and
women to 63 by 2030, said Antonio Spilimbergo, the head of the
International Monetary Fund’s mission to the country.  “Compared to other countries, the pension age is low,”
Spilimbergo told reporters in Moscow today. The retirement age
is now 60 for men and 55 for women.  Changes to the pension system and introducing a budget rule
are the “two pillars” for tighter Russian fiscal policy, he
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
