Juniper Networks Inc. (JNPR) , the world’s
second-largest maker of computer-networking gear, reduced its
gross margin forecast for 2013 to 2015, saying newer products
will need time to become profitable.  Gross margin, or the percentage of revenue left after
subtracting production costs, will be 63 percent to 66 percent
for the three years to 2015, Chief Financial Officer Robyn Denholm said yesterday at a  presentation  to analysts in
Sunnyvale,  California , where the company is based. Juniper, a
seller of routers and switches that direct  Internet traffic ,
previously forecast gross margin of 66 percent to 68 percent.  “The primary drivers are our product mix,” Denholm said
at the meeting, which was broadcast on the company’s website.
“We do think routing will improve, but we also have other
products coming in at or below the Juniper average.”  Juniper, which has encountered order delays and last year
ceded market share to  Cisco Systems Inc. (CSCO) , is facing
“uncertainty” in network spending, especially in Europe, Chief
Executive Officer  Kevin Johnson  said in May.  “We did assume that the macroeconomic environment was
going to improve and it clearly didn’t,” Denholm said.  Revenue will rise 9 percent to 12 percent in 2013 to 2015,
Denholm also said.  It takes about eight quarters for newer products to reach
$100 million in revenue, so Juniper’s five newest additions,
which include routers and tools for mobile phones, won’t
materially contribute to the company’s revenue until the fourth
quarter of 2013, Denholm said.  Juniper’s stock has declined 20 percent this year, compared
with a 9.6 percent gain in the 70-member  Standard and Poor’s 500
Information Technology Index . The shares fell 1.5 percent to
$16.36 at the close in  New York .  To contact the reporter on this story:
