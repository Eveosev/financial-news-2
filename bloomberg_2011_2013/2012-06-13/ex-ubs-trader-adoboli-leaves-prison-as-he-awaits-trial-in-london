Kweku Adoboli, the former  UBS AG (UBSN) 
trader accused of causing a $2.3 billion loss for the bank from
unauthorized trading, left prison yesterday after meeting bail.  Adoboli, 32, was released from Wandsworth prison in
southwest London in a McDonald’s parking lot last night, his  law
firm , Bark & Co., said in a post on  Twitter . He is staying at a
friend’s apartment in the British capital, said his lawyer,  Tim
Harris .  Adoboli had been in custody since his Sept. 15 arrest. He
was granted bail at a hearing last week and will have to wear an
electronic monitoring device and have a curfew as part of the
conditions. He also surrendered his passport. Harris declined to
comment on the bail amount.  Adoboli, who worked for the investment bank’s Delta One
desk, has pleaded not guilty to fraud and false accounting for
allegedly causing the loss, the largest from unauthorized
trading in British history.  A trial is scheduled in September.  To contact the reporter on this story:
