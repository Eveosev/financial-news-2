The  Bovespa (IBOV)  advanced, posting the
only gain among major equity indexes in the Americas, as
homebuilders and consumer stocks jumped on speculation policy
makers will further reduce  interest rates  to shield  Brazil ’s
economy from the global slowdown.  Brookfield Incorporacoes SA, Brazil’s fourth-largest
homebuilder by revenue, advanced the  most  on the benchmark.  PDG
Realty SA Empreendimentos e Participacoes  rose to the highest in
almost three weeks. Online retailer  B2W Cia. Global do Varejo 
gained for a fifth day, the longest winning streak in nine
months.  The Bovespa rose 1.1 percent to 55,650.51 at the close in
Sao Paulo. Fifty-four stocks gained on the gauge while 12 fell.
The real weakened 0.2 percent to 2.0724 per  U.S. dollar  at 5:45
p.m. local time.  “The Brazilian government has been very clear in saying
that, amid the slowdown in the global economy, its number one
priority is to boost growth,” Henrique Kleine, the chief
analyst at Magliano SA brokerage, said by phone from Sao Paulo.
“That’s why you see stocks linked to domestic consumption
performing better than the market’s average.”  Brookfield gained 6.4 percent to 3.65 reais. PDG Realty
rose 4.2 percent to 3.50 reais. The  BM&F Bovespa Real Estate
Index (IMOBBV)  advanced 1.8 percent.  B2W added 3.8 percent to 6 reais. Hypermarcas SA, the maker
of more than 180 consumer products, climbed 4 percent to 12.01
reais. In the Brazilian interest-rate futures market, yields on
most contracts fell. The yield on the contract due in January
slid two basis point, or 0.02 percentage point, to 7.71 percent.  European Debt  The Bovespa earlier  fell  as much as 1 percent after a drop
in U.S. retail sales and rising borrowing costs at debt auctions
in  Europe  rekindled concern about the global recovery.  “The Bovespa index dropped about 20 percent since this
year’s high, so one could argue that there’s not much room for
further declines,” Alexandre Ghirghi, a portfolio manager at
Metodo Investimentos, said by phone from  Sao Paulo . “On the
other hand, the external outlook is still worrisome, which keeps
the index from posting a more solid recovery. It can rise one
day or the other, but I don’t see a long-term trend.”  Italy sold 6.5 billion euros ($8.15 billion) of one-year
bills at 3.972 percent, which compares with a 2.34 percent rate
at the previous auction May 11.  Germany  sold 4.04 billion euros
of 10-year bunds at an average yield of 1.52 percent, up from a
rate of 1.47 percent the last time the nation sold the
securities on May 16. In the U.S., retail sales fell 0.2 percent
in May, the second straight monthly drop, Commerce Department
figures showed today.  Bear Market  The Bovespa entered a  bear market  on May 17 after tumbling
21 percent from this year’s high on March 13 through that day.
The gauge trades at 9.6 times analysts’ earnings estimates for
the next four quarters, which compares with the 9.9 ratio for
MSCI Inc.’s measure of 21 developing nations’ equities, data
compiled by Bloomberg show.  Trading volume was 7.98 billion reais ($3.86 billion) in
stocks in Sao Paulo, data compiled by Bloomberg show. That
compares with a daily average of 7.15 billion reais this year
through June 12, according to data from the  exchange .  To contact the reporter on this story:
