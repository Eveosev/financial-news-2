Ar Tarim Organik Gida AS (ARTOG) , an organic
agriculture company, headed for its highest in almost two weeks
ago after saying it will set up a unit to explore oil in
southeast  Turkey .  The  shares  jumped 7.4 percent to 4.53 liras at 1:13 p.m. in
Istanbul, on course for their strongest level since June 1 on a
closing basis and after its initial public offering on May 31.  The exploration unit, Ar Petrol Arama Uretim Sondaj AS,
will apply for licenses and hold talks with domestic and foreign
companies for oil exploration in the companyâ€™s 1.61 million
square meters (400 acres) of land in Diyarbakir province, Ar
Tarim said in a statement to the  Istanbul Stock Exchange  after
the market closed yesterday.  Turkey imports more than 98 percent of its crude and
natural gas.  To contact the reporter on this story:
