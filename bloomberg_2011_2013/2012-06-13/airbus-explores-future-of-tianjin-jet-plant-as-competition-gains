(Corrects date of first aircraft delivery in second
paragraph.)  Airbus SAS is evaluating the future
of its assembly facility for single-aisle aircraft in  China , as
the country works on its own design of a competing airliner.  Airbus owns 51 percent of a venture that began delivering
A320 jets in 2009, while China’s Avic owns the rest. The team
wants to build 284 single-aisle jets by June 2016. The facility
is churning out more than three planes a month, with the 100th
just beginning assembly. The rate will reach four monthly by
year-end, Airbus China President Laurence Barron said.  The Tianjin plant will deliver the last planes in the same
year that state-controlled Commercial Aircraft Corp. of China
Ltd. aims to have a rival plane with 168 seats in service, aimed
initially at the domestic market. Airbus also intends to start
delivering its A320neo with new engines from late 2015.  “If we extend the final assembly line, then automatically
the Neo comes into the picture,” Barron said in an interview at
the facility, located 100 miles outside Beijing.  Mainland China will need 3,832 new passenger planes over
the next 20 years, including 2,520 single-aisle aircraft, with
the total worth $509 billion, according to Airbus. In 2011,
China was already No. 2 in deliveries worldwide after the U.S  Airbus has 800 planes in service in China today, 670 of
which are A320 series planes. The manufacturer entered the
market in 1994, two decades after  Boeing Co. (BA) , and today the two
have about an equal shares in that country.  Neo Negotiations  The Tianjin plant assembles only A320s, which seat 150
people, and A319s, seating 125. All planes coming off the line
go to Chinese airlines or lessors, though comprising just a
fourth of all single-aisle production going into China.  Most of Airbus’s single-aisle planes are built in Hamburg,
 Germany , and Toulouse,  France , where Airbus’s wide-body A330 and
jumbo A380 are also put together.  No Chinese airline has yet ordered any of Airbus’s
A320neos. The planemaker is negotiating with the Chinese
government for the sale of at least 100 single-aisle planes,
Airbus Chief Operating Officer  John Leahy  said this week.
Negotiations may be completed this year.  Barron gave no timetable for an agreement on the Tianjin
plant and declined to provide any information on issues
involved. Should the two sides not extend the agreement, Airbus
could recuperate tools and jigs used to make the planes.  To contact the reporter on this story:
