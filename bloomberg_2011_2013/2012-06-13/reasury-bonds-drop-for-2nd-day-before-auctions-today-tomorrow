Treasuries dropped for a second day
as the U.S. prepared to sell $21 billion of 10-year notes today
and $13 billion of so-called long bonds tomorrow.  Thirty-year yields  approached the highest level this month
as Barclays Plc Chief Executive Officer  Robert Diamond  said the
euro will survive, reducing demand for the safest securities.
The longest maturities led declines as  Denmark ’s decision to
ease liability rules for pension funds reduced demand for
longer-dated bonds. The decline in Treasuries was tempered
before a government report that economists said will show U.S.
retail sales fell in May.  “The upcoming supply is one of the factors” behind the
drop in Treasuries, said  Orlando Green , a fixed-income
strategist at Credit Agricole Corporate & Investment Bank in
 London . “It’s been a crowded trade for some time.”  The  30-year yield  climbed three basis points, or 0.03
percentage point, to 2.80 percent at 7:36 a.m. New York time,
according to Bloomberg Bond Trader prices. The 3 percent bond
due in May 2042 fell 17/32, or $5.31 per $1,000 face amount, to
104 3/32. The yield rose to 2.85 percent on June 11, the highest
level since May 29.  Benchmark  10-year yields  increased two basis points to 1.68
percent after dropping to a record 1.4387 percent on June 1.  The 10-year notes to be sold today yielded 1.69 percent in
pre-auction trading, compared with 1.855 percent at the previous
offering on May 9. Investors submitted bids for 2.9 times the
amount on offer at that auction, versus 3.08 times on April 11.  ‘Too Expensive’  Yesterday’s $32 billion auction of three-year notes drew a
yield of 0.387 percent, compared with a forecast of 0.383
percent in a Bloomberg News survey of primary dealers, companies
obliged to bid at U.S. debt sales. The bid-to-cover  ratio  fell
to 3.53 from 3.65 at the previous sale on May 8.  “Traders might have found that bonds have become too
expensive as they get new supply,” said  Kiyoshi Ishigane , a
senior strategist at Mitsubishi UFJ Asset Management Co., which
oversees about $70 billion in  Tokyo .  Denmark’s government will allow pension funds and life
insurers to raise the discount rate they use to calculate their
liabilities. When Sweden’s regulator pushed through a similar
change in pension rules on June 7, Swedish 10-year yields surged
30 basis points because the change reduced the industry’s
incentive to keep purchasing longer-maturity debt to balance
their liabilities.  ‘Very Strong’  Speculation the 17-nation euro bloc will contain its debt
crisis also damped demand for the safest assets.  “The underpinnings of the single currency, the
underpinnings of the integrated economy across  Europe  are very,
very strong,” Diamond said in a Bloomberg Television interview
in  Hong Kong . The euro area is more likely to “muddle through”
than break up, said  Andrew Colquhoun , head of Asia-Pacific
sovereign ratings at  Fitch Ratings  in Hong Kong.  U.S. government securities have returned 1.6 percent this
year, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch indexes. They
have fallen 0.5 percent in June.  U.S. retail sales dropped 0.2 percent in May, the first
decline in a year, according to the median estimate of
economists in a Bloomberg survey before the report today.  The central bank will purchase as much as $5.5 billion of
Treasuries due from August 2020 to May 2022 today under its
program known as Operation Twist, as it seeks to replace
holdings of shorter-term securities with longer-term bonds,
according to the Fed Bank of  New York ’s  website .  The Fed, which meets June 19-20, bought $2.3 trillion of
bonds in two rounds of so-called quantitative easing from
December 2008 to June 2011, seeking to cap borrowing costs and
stimulate the economy.  The  difference  in yields between 10-year notes and Treasury
Inflation Protected Securities, which represents expectations
for inflation over the life of the securities, was little
changed today at 2.14 percentage points, down from this year’s
high of 2.45 percentage points in March. The average over the
past 10 years is 2.15 percentage points.  To contact the reporters on this story:
