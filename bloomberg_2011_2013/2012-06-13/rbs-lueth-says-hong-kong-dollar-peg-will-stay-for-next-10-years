Erik Lueth, a Hong Kong-based senior
regional economist at Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc, comments
on the city’s currency peg after former monetary chief  Joseph
Yam  called for a review. Lueth made his comments in a research
note today.  “Yam’s comments are significant given his former role and
the fact that he helped create and defend the peg for the better
part of his professional life.  “I don’t believe that the peg will be abandoned over the
next seven-10 years and Yam’s intervention should be read as the
views of a man who misses the limelight.  “It is true that property prices and transactions are on
the rise again after a short hiatus in the second half of 2011.
But this is largely attributed to mainland buyers who pay cash-
down and wouldn’t be deterred by higher interest rates.  “I also see no indication that the  Hong Kong dollar  is
terribly undervalued.”  “Pegging to the  yuan  isn’t an option, because it isn’t a
convertible currency.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
