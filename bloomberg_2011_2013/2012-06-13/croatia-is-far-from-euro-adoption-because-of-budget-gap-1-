Croatia is “far” from adopting the
euro because it will “take a while” to narrow its  budget
deficit  to less than the European Union’s limit of 3 percent of
gross domestic product, Finance Minister Slavko Linic said.  “Our task in the next four years is to strengthen the
economy and undertake reforms of the health and pension
systems,” he said at a conference in Zagreb today.  Croatia, which is set to join the 27-nation bloc in July
2013, proposed 4 billion kuna ($700 million) in budget cuts in
January to narrow the budget deficit to 3.8 percent of GDP from
5.5 percent in 2011. The government has forecast the economy
will grow 0.8 percent this year, while the  World Bank  predicted
a 1 percent decline.  The government will inject 8 billion kuna from
reconstruction banks and EU funds into infrastructure to revive
investment in energy and tourism, Prime Minister  Zoran Milanovic 
said in January.  To contact the reporter on this story:
