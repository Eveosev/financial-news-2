European stocks erased gains before
Italy and  Germany  sell debt. U.S. index futures also declined
while Asian shares rose.  The Stoxx Europe 600 Index fell 0.1 percent to 243.3 at
9:15 a.m. in  London  after earlier rallying as much as 0.4
percent. Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index expiring in
September slid 0.2 percent, while the MSCI Asia Pacific Index
increased 0.4 percent.  Italy plans to auction at least 9.5 billion euros ($11.9
billion) of debt this week, including 6.5 billion euros of 364-
day bills today and debt maturing in 2015, 2019 and 2020
tomorrow. The yield on the nation’s benchmark 10-year government
bond rose to as high as 6.3 percent yesterday, a level last seen
on Jan. 25.  Germany will seek to sell 5 billion euros of 10-year bonds
and 1 billion euros of inflation-linked bonds maturing in 2018
this morning.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
