China’s demand for scrap aluminum
will continue to outpace domestic supply, keeping the global
market for the metal tight and supporting prices, said Gerardo

North American automotive industry, which is making up for
“sluggishness” in Chinese car production, Solorio said today
at a conference in Chicago hosted by Harbor.  To contact the reporter on this story:
