Germany  may reach a balanced budget
as soon as 2013 as low  interest rates  on German bunds saves the
nation 15 billion euros ($19 billion) in 2011 and 2012,
 Financial Times Deutschland  reported, citing economists
including Jens Boysen-Hogrefe, at the Kieler Institut fuer
Weltwirtschaft.  That only will hold true if the euro crisis doesn’t
escalate and Germany isn’t held liable for an exit of Greece
from the euro, the FTD said, citing the RWI institute.  To contact the reporter on this story:
