U.S. Treasury Secretary  Timothy F. Geithner  said  JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) ’s $2 billion trading loss was
“a pretty significant risk-management failure” that was
manageable because of the bank’s level of capital.  The loss is “a good reminder of the inherent uncertainty
you live with” in financial markets, Geithner said today during
a talk at the Council on Foreign Relations in Washington. He
said JPMorgan was “direct and clear and crisp in admitting the
scale of the error.”  JPMorgan Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon testified
before Congress today, spending much of a Senate Banking
Committee hearing questioning the federal regulatory system.  Dimon described the trading loss as a hedge that “morphed
into something I can’t justify,” and largely blamed
subordinates for a trading strategy gone wrong. The bank is
looking at clawing back some of the compensation earned by those
responsible, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
