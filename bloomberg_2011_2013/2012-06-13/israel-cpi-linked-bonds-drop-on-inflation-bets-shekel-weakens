Israel ’s consumer price-linked
government bonds maturing in 2019 dropped, driving yields higher
for a third time this week, on investor bets inflation will
moderate as energy costs decline and economic growth slows.  The yield on the 3 percent inflation-linked notes due
October rose one basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 1.61
percent, at 11:43 a.m. in Tel Aviv. The two-year break-even
rate, the yield difference between the inflation-linked bond and
fixed-rate government bonds of similar maturity, was little
changed at 244, implying an average annual inflation rate of
about 2.44 percent.  Israel imports almost all of its oil needs and crude prices
are down 16 percent this year as the outlook for oil consumption
was clouded by  Europe ’s debt crisis and faltering growth in
emerging nations. Economic growth in Israel is expected to slow
to 3.1 percent this year from 4.8 percent in 2011, according to
central bank estimates. The trade deficit narrowed in May to its
lowest this year as fuel prices declined, the  Central Bureau of
Statistics  said yesterday.  “Consumer prices are expected to moderate as energy prices
are dropping,” said Ori Greenfeld, head of the macroeconomic
research department at Psagot Investment House Ltd. in Tel Aviv.
“Looking ahead, we are also seeing deflationary pressure coming
from a slowdown in the local economy and an expected rise in
unemployment.”  Swaps Rise  Consumer prices probably advanced 0.4 percent in May from a
gain of 0.9 percent the previous month, Greenfeld said.
Inflation data is scheduled to be released on June 15.  The yield on the 5.5 Mimshal Shiklit notes due January 2022
rose one basis point to 4.44 percent.  One-year interest rate
swaps , an indicator of investor expectations for the benchmark
rate in the period, increased three basis points to 2.28
percent.  The  Tel Aviv  Bond 40 Index, which measures inflation-linked
and fixed-rate corporate bonds, was little changed at 264.42.
The shekel weakened 0.1 percent to 3.8819 a dollar, trimming
this month’s gain to 0.6 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
