Former  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) 
director  Rajat Gupta  rested his defense to federal insider-
trading charges without testifying or being allowed to play
wiretapped recordings that his lawyer called “substantial” to
his case.  Defense attorney  Gary Naftalis , of Kramer Levin Naftalis &
Frankel LLP, told U.S. District Judge Jed Rakoff yesterday that
Gupta, 63, who ran McKinsey & Co. from 1994 to 2003, had
finished offering evidence. The trial began May 21.  “Defense rests, your honor,” Naftalis said. Summations
are set to begin this morning, and Rakoff said the jury may
begin its deliberations today.  Gupta is accused of leaking inside information to Galleon
Group LLC hedge fund co-founder Raj Rajaratnam about Goldman
Sachs and  Procter & Gamble Co. (PG) , where Gupta was also a director.
He’s charged with one count of conspiracy and five counts of
 securities fraud , which carries a maximum term of 20 years in
prison.  The defense, which began June 8, was based in part on a
claim that another Goldman Sachs executive, David Loeb, passed
the tips that prosecutors say came from Gupta. Rakoff barred the
defense from playing wiretapped recordings from August 2008 that
the defense claims show Loeb tipping Rajaratnam.  Lawyers for Gupta said they have “compelling” evidence
Loeb passed information about Intel Corp. and Apple Inc. to
Rajaratnam, according to excerpts of two phone calls tapped by
the  Federal Bureau of Investigation  and submitted by Gupta’s
lawyers. The defense obtained the documents after Rakoff ordered
the government to turn over all evidence of other Goldman Sachs
tippers relied on by Rajaratnam.  David Frankel, an attorney for Gupta, told Rakoff on June
11 that the evidence about Loeb was “crucial” to the defense
and proved “that another person committed an act of which the
defendant stands accused.”  Loeb, a salesman whose job required him to keep in regular
contact with hedge fund managers, hasn’t been accused of
wrongdoing.  Prosecutors have alleged in court that Loeb told
Rajaratnam about  Intel Corp. (INTC) , Apple Inc. and Hewlett-Packard
Co., none of which are involved in Gupta’s case.  “Loeb is still employed by Goldman Sachs,”  Michael DuVally , a spokesman for the New York-based company said
yesterday, declining to comment further on Loeb’s status.  “Mr. Loeb’s conduct was entirely consistent with the
securities laws and regulations,” his lawyer, Frank Wohl of
Lankler Siffert & Wohl LLP, said in an e-mailed statement. “He
did not provide any material inside information to Mr.
Rajaratnam or anyone else. Mr. Loeb had no knowledge of any of
the Goldman Sachs information at issue in the case against Mr.
Gupta.”  Rakoff called the recordings inadmissible “hearsay” June
11 and reiterated that ruling yesterday.  The defense said Gupta had no motive to tip Rajaratnam,
pointing to his loss of a $10 million investment in a Galleon
fund and Gupta’s subsequent claim that Rajaratnam cheated him.
They also point to records showing Gupta in a meeting about
malaria-prevention with a United Nations official around the
time he allegedly tipped Rajaratnam to the Buffett deal.  Defense lawyers concluded their case by playing an Oct. 2,
2008, wiretapped call between Rajaratnam and a Galleon portfolio
manager, Sanjay Santhanam, in which the two men can be heard
discussing the Voyager Fund. During the call, Rajaratnam can be
heard saying “I’m a big boy” and that he isn’t sure Gupta is,
adding “I didn’t tell him I took the liquidity out.”  The case is U.S. v. Gupta, 11-cr-00907, U.S. District
Court, Southern District of  New York  (Manhattan).  For more, click here.  Firm News  Morrison & Foerster Denver Office Names Fons Managing Partner  Morrison & Foerster LLP litigator Randall J. Fons was named
managing partner of the firm’s Denver office.  Fons, co-chairman of the firm’s securities litigation,
enforcement and white-collar defense group, has been a partner
with Morrison & Foerster since 2006, when he left the Securities
and Exchange Commission.  He succeeds Whitney Holmes, whose practice focuses on
corporate finance, securities, and mergers and acquisitions. He
was in charge of the office for the past three years.  Fons said in an interview that he plans to continue the
growth that started under Holmes by further expanding the 15-
lawyer office, particularly in the corporate and private equity
practices.  “We’re a national firm in a smaller market, so our
expansion is really based on niche areas,” Fons said.  He expects that the green and clean tech industries that
are thriving in Colorado will fuel work for the firm, though he
expects the office’s growth to be in “complex high-end issues
that can be spread across industries.”  Under Holmes’s leadership, Hendrik Jordaan, chairman of the
firm’s private equity investments and buyouts practice, was
hired, as was David Strong, a federal tax and mergers and
acquisitions adviser. Both came from Holme Roberts & Owen LLP,
which combined with Bryan Cave LLP in December.  Jordaan was recently involved in the purchase of Health
Care Partners by Davita Inc., for whom Morrison & Foerster acted
as legal adviser. Of counsel Eric Knudsen, a former Kirkland &
Ellis LLP partner who advises companies and investors in private
equity transactions, joined in February.  Fons will continue his practice while overseeing the
office. Before joining the firm, he spent 18 years with the SEC,
where he led investigations and prosecution of market
manipulation,  insider trading , Foreign Corrupt Practices Act
violations and financial fraud, as well as cases against
auditors, broker-dealers, and investment advisers. Fons served
as regional director of the SEC’s Central and Southeast Regional
Offices, overseeing multi-state enforcement activities.  “We’re fortunate to have a number of firm leaders in the
Denver office,” Morrison & Foerster Chairman Keith Wetmore said
in a statement.  The firm has more than 1,000 lawyers with offices in the
U.S., Europe and Asia.  News  Dewey & LeBoeuf Used $43 Million in Failed Recovery Plan  Dewey & LeBoeuf LLP used $43 million of its secured
lenders’ money from April 16 to May 28 in an attempt to save the
 law firm  before it sought bankruptcy,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM)  said
in a court filing.  Dewey failed on May 28 after losing most of its partners
and ousting its chairman. It had drawn $75 million of a $100
million bank credit line when the loan came due on April 16,
according to people familiar with its finances.  Lenders let the firm continue using cash for payroll, rent,
insurance and other expenses, and to allow key groups of Dewey
lawyers to move to new firms when Dewey’s failure was imminent,
JPMorgan said in a filing June 11 in  U.S. Bankruptcy Court  in
Manhattan.  Secured lenders, “at the request of the firm’s management,
continued to fund the firm outside of a court proceeding,
allowing the debtor access to cash to permit key practice groups
to continue to operate effectively and transition to new firms
as opportunities arose,” said the bank, which is the agent for
the secured lenders.  JPMorgan made the statements as part of a request to a
judge to allow Dewey to use enough cash to liquidate in
bankruptcy, while granting protection to secured lenders. At
least six objections to the plan were filed, including by
unsecured creditors.  The firm, formed by combining Dewey Ballantine LLP and
LeBoeuf, Lamb, Greene & McRae LLP in 2007, had after the merger
more than 1,300 attorneys in 12 countries. New York-based Dewey
listed debt of $245 million and assets of $193 million in its
Chapter 11 filing. It is the biggest law firm to ever file for
bankruptcy, based on the number of lawyers.  It entered bankruptcy with 150 U.S. employees to help with
the liquidation, restructuring officer Jonathan A. Mitchell said
in court papers.  “Today, all but two of the partners are gone,” JPMorgan
said. “Gone with them are millions of dollars in compensation,
much of it paid with borrowed money over the past several
months. Left behind, in addition to more than $225 million of
secured debt, are, among other things, unfunded retirement
benefits, uncollected accounts receivable, potential litigation
claims, half a million boxes or more of client files, and  office
space  in midtown that is vast, luxurious and empty.”  The case is In re Dewey & LeBoeuf LLP, 12-12321, U.S.
Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of New York ( Manhattan ).  For more, click here.  Moves  U.S. Attorney’s Office Major Frauds Chief Moves to Jones Day  Jones Day  added Beong-Soo Kim, chief of the major frauds

McDermott for its restructuring and insolvency practice from  DLA
Piper  LLP.  Eisenegger was a partner at DLA Piper since 2002, where he
