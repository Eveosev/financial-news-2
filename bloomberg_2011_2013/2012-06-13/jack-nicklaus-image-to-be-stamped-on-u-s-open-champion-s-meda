The U.S. Golf Association named and
redesigned the championship medal for the annual U.S. Open in
honor of 18-time major tournament winner  Jack Nicklaus .  The gold Jack Nicklaus Medal now features a silhouette of
the four-time U.S. Open champion. The medal, which dates to the
first edition of the tournament in 1895, had been unnamed and
had a design that had changed over time.  Along with the medal, the USGA, which governs the sport of
golf along with the Royal & Ancient Golf Club of  St. Andrews ,
Scotland, also disclosed plans to expand the Jack Nicklaus Room
at its museum in Far Hills,  New Jersey .  “These are honors that truly challenge you to put words
with, because of how humbling and meaningful they are,”
Nicklaus said in a statement. “I have always considered the
U.S. Open the most important major championship to me.”  On June 17, before the final round of this year’s U.S. Open
at the Olympic Club in San Francisco,  Comcast Corp. (CMCSA) ’s NBC
network will air a new documentary film celebrating the 50-year
anniversary of Nicklaus’s 1962 U.S. Open victory at Oakmont, his
first professional major title.  To contact the reporter on this story:
