Sanctions imposed on  Iran  will
damage the world economy and increase oil-price volatility,
Iran’s Oil Minister Rostam Qasemi said today.  “Sanctions ultimately will lead to a sharp swing in the
price of oil,” the minister said. He spoke at the International
OPEC Seminar in Vienna, a day before the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries meets to determine output levels.
Crude exports from the country are the target of sanctions from
the U.S. and a European Union ban on buying the country’s oil
takes full effect on July 1.  Qasemi didn’t comment in his speech on whether Iran seeks
any change in OPEC’s production target and declined to comment
to reporters earlier today in Vienna.  To contact the reporter on this story:
