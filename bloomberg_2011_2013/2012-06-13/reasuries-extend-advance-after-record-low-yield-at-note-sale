U.S. government  securities  climbed
as concern  Europe ’s sovereign-debt crisis is worsening and a
drop in U.S. retail sales sent 10-year note yields to a record
low at a $21 billion sale of the security.  Treasuries also gained as  Spain ’s credit rating was cut by
Moody’s Investors Service and the firm said it may be reduced
further. The 10-year notes sold today  yielded  1.622 percent,
compared with a forecast of 1.647 percent in a Bloomberg News
survey of eight of the  Federal Reserve ’s 21 primary dealers. The
Fed bought $4.76 billion of Treasuries due from August 2020 to
February 2022 as part of its effort to keep borrowing costs low.  “It’s really fear, European fears,”  said  Thomas Roth ,
senior trader in New York at Mitsubishi UFJ Securities USA Inc.
“Asians fear the U.S. will become another  Japan  and the 10-year
will drop to 1 percent. It was a good auction; there was good
customer demand.”  The  yield  on the 10-year note slid seven basis points, or
0.07 percentage point, to 1.59 percent at 5:10 p.m. in New York,
after rising earlier as much as three basis points, according to
Bloomberg Bond Trader data. It reached a record low of 1.4387
percent in trading on June 1. The price of the 1.75 percent
securities due in May 2022 increased 21/32, or $6.56 per $1,000
face amount, to 101 14/32.  Thirty-year bond  yields decreased six basis points to 2.71
percent after rising five basis points earlier.  U.S. 10- and 30-year securities erased early losses after
U.S. retail sales fell for a second straight month, spurring
investor demand for safety.  Foreign Banks  Ten-year  U.S. debt  has returned 3.4 percent this year, more
than double the 1.6 percent gain in the broader Treasury market.
The notes returned 17 percent in 2011, compared with a 9.8
percent gain by Treasuries overall, according to Bank of America
Merrill Lynch indexes.  At today’s auction, the  bid-to-cover  ratio, which gauges
demand by comparing total bids with the amount offered, was
3.06, versus 2.9 percent at the May offering and an average of
3.08 at the past 10 sales.  Indirect bidders , an investor class that includes foreign
central banks, purchased 42 percent of the securities at the
offering, the most since December. That compared with an average
of 41.5 percent for the past 10 sales of 10-year notes.  Direct bidders, non-primary dealer investors that place
their bids directly with the Treasury, purchased 20.8 percent,
compared with an average of 14.7 percent at the past 10 sales.
Their share today was the highest since August.  The previous record low yield at a 10-year note offering
was 1.855 percent last month.  Bond Auction  The U.S. will auction $13 billion of 30-year bonds tomorrow
after a $32 billion three-year note sale yesterday that drew a
yield of 0.387 percent. That compared with a forecast of 0.383
percent in a Bloomberg survey of seven primary dealers.  “The relentless purchasing of Treasuries astounds me,”
said Paul Montaquila, head of fixed-income trading at Bank of
The West in  San Ramon ,  California . “The uncertainty in Europe
is an ever-lingering backdrop.”  Spain and  Italy  appealed to European policy makers to step
up their response to the crisis after a 100 billion-euro ($125
billion) lifeline for Spanish banks failed to calm markets.  Spain’s credit rating was cut to Baa3 from A3 by Moody’s,
which cited the nation’s increased debt burden, weakening
economy and limited access to  capital markets . Egan-Jones
Ratings Co. earlier reduced the country’s rating to CCC+ from B,
the firm said today in an e-mailed statement.  Sales Decline  U.S.  retail sales  fell in May, Commerce Department figures
showed in  Washington , as slower employment and subdued wage
gains damped demand. The report fueled speculation the Fed may
move to spur growth.  Sales decreased 0.2 percent followed a similar decline in
April that was previously reported as a gain,. Sales excluding
automobiles slumped by the most in two years.  “The  Federal Open Market Committee  is certainly going to
have to address that number,” Bank of The West’s Montaquila
said. “The Fed may be enticed to do something. As soon as you
see something crack domestically, it fuels buying.”  The U.S. central bank, which meets June 19-20, purchased
Treasuries today under a program known as Operation Twist. It’s
seeking to replace $400 billion of shorter-term securities in
its holdings with longer-term bonds through this month to keep
borrowing costs down.  Quantitative Easing  The Fed bought $2.3 trillion of bonds from December 2008 to
June 2011 in two rounds of a tactic called quantitative easing,
seeking to cap borrowing costs and stimulate the economy.  The  difference  in yields between 10-year notes and Treasury
Inflation Protected Securities, which represents traders’
expectations for inflation over the life of the securities,
touched 2.10 percentage points, compared with the 2012 high of
2.45 percentage points in March. The average over the past 10
years is 2.15 percentage points.  “We’re clearly in a downswing in inflation,” said Thomas Simons, a government-debt economist in  New York  at Jefferies
Group Inc., which as a primary dealer is obliged to bid at U.S.
debt auctions. “There’s very little sign of strength.”  A  measure  of price-increase predictions used by the Fed to
set policy, the five-year, five-year forward break-even rate,
which gauges the average inflation rate between 2017 and 2022,
was 2.52 percent on June 11, down from a 2012 high of 2.78
percent on March 19 and a five-year average of 2.8 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
