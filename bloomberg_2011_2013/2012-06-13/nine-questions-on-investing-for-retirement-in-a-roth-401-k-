     A recent Bloomberg.com personal finance
story, "The Retirement Savings Move Tax Pros Love," got an
enthusiastic response from readers who are considering
investing for retirement in a Roth 401(k). The story also
generated many questions. We took some of those questions to
retirement expert Barry Picker, a CPA and author of "Barry
Picker's Guide to Retirement Distribution Planning." His
answers below are guidelines and may not apply to everyone and
every situation.  Q: Is there an income limit to be eligible to contribute
to a Roth 401(k)?  A: There is no income limit.  Q: If my employer offers a Roth 401(k) and a traditional
401(k), will I have to choose between contributing to one or
the other?  A: You can contribute to the traditional, the Roth, or
both, as long as your total salary deferral does not exceed
the maximum permitted.  Q: What is the maximum amount I can invest in a Roth
401(k) in 2012?  A: The maximum that can be contributed to 401(k)s in 2012
is $17,000, plus an extra $5,500 for individuals past age 50
as of the end of the year. The maximum ($17,000/$22,500) can
be divided between the traditional 401(k) and Roth 401(k).  Q: Will my employer make a matching contribution to a
Roth 401(k)?  A: If you contribute to a Roth 401(k), your employer can
still match your contribution. However, the employer’s match
will be paid into a traditional 401(k), not the Roth 401(k).  Q: Can I convert money in a traditional 401(k) into a
Roth 401(k)? Is there an income limit on who can do this
conversion? Will I owe tax when I convert?  A: You can convert money in a traditional 401(k) into a
Roth 401(k). There is no income limit to do this
conversion, but it is a taxable transaction.  Q: If I am older than 59 ½ when I start to contribute to
a Roth 401(k), must I wait the five years before I can make
tax-free withdrawals?  A: Yes, you have to meet both the age and
years-of-participation requirements before you can take
tax-free withdrawals. Note that your contributions are always
available to you tax-free, as they came from your after-tax
income. It is only your account earnings that can be taxed.
However, in a Roth 401(k) -- unlike a Roth IRA --
any distribution is deemed to come pro-rata from your
contribution and from earnings. So a withdrawal prior to
meeting both requirements for a tax-free withdrawal will most
likely have some taxable component.  Q: Assuming I wait until age 59 1/2 to make a withdrawal
from a Roth 401(k), and my account is at least five years
old, is there any circumstance where I would owe any tax on
either the principal or earnings withdrawn from the account?   A: No one will ever owe tax on the principal -- it’s
already been taxed. It’s only the income that would be taxed
if one does not meet the requirements for tax-free
withdrawals. Assuming you are over 59 1/2 and have the account
is over 5 years old, there will not be a tax on the
withdrawals.  Q: If I don’t roll over my Roth 401(k) to a Roth IRA and
I take required minimum distributions from the Roth
401(k), will those distributions count as taxable income?  A: The only time a required minimum distribution could
have taxable income is if the individual has not been a
participant in the Roth 401(k) for more than five years.  Q: Does contributing the maximum to a Roth 401(k) impact
whether I can also contribute to a Roth IRA?  A: No. There is an income limit on Roth IRA
contributions. Assuming your income is not over the limit, the
contribution to the Roth 401(k) will not impact the ability to
contribute to a Roth IRA.  (Carla Fried is a freelance writer based in California.)  To contact the editor responsible for this story: Nikhil
