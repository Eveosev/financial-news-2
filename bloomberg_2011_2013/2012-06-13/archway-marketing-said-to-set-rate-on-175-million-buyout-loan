Archway Marketing Services Inc., a
provider of outsourced marketing logistics and fulfillment
services, set the  interest rate  on $175 million of loans to back
the companyâ€™s buyout by Investcorp, according to a person with
knowledge of the transaction.  GE Capital Markets the lending unit of General Electric Co.
and ING Bank are arranging the financing for the Rogers,
Minnesota-based company which consists of a $110 million  term
loan , a $35 million delayed-draw term portion and a $30 million
revolving line of credit, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  All three pieces will pay interest at 5.25 percentage
points more than the London interbank offered rate, said the
person, who declined to be identified because the terms are
private. Libor, a rate banks say they can borrow in dollars from
each other, will have a 1.25 percent floor.  Archway Marketing is proposing to sell the debt at 99 cents
on the dollar, the person said, reducing proceeds for the
company and boosting the yield to investors.  An e-mail sent to Investcorp seeking comment was not
immediately returned.  To contact the reporter on this story:
