The cost of insuring Asia-Pacific
corporate and sovereign bonds from non-payment decreased,
according to traders of credit-default swaps.  The  Markit iTraxx Asia  index of 40 investment-grade
borrowers outside Japan declined 2 basis points to 190 basis
points as of 8:40 a.m. in  Hong Kong , Royal Bank of Scotland
Group Plc prices show. The gauge is poised for its lowest close
since May 15, according to data provider CMA.  The  Markit iTraxx Australia  index fell 3 basis points to
193.5 as of 10:34 a.m. in Sydney,  Westpac Banking Corp. (WBC)  prices
show. The benchmark has ranged between 192 and 211 basis points
this month, according to CMA, which is owned by CME Group Inc.
and compiled prices quoted by dealers in the privately
negotiated market.  The Markit iTraxx Japan index dropped 2 basis points to 183
basis points as of 9:33 a.m. in  Tokyo , Citigroup Inc. prices
show. Thatâ€™s on track for its lowest close since June 11, CMA
prices show.  Credit-default swap indexes are benchmarks for insuring
bonds against default and traders use them to speculate on
 credit quality . A drop signals improving perceptions of
creditworthiness, while an increase suggests the opposite.  The swap contracts pay the buyer face value in exchange for
the underlying securities if a borrower fails to meet its debt
agreements. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  To contact the reporter on this story:
