European stocks declined as
borrowing costs increased at debt auctions in Germany and Italy
and as Sweden’s  SKF (SKFB)  AB reported weakening demand for its
products in the second quarter.  SKF, the world’s largest maker of ball bearings, dropped
7.3 percent.  Renault SA (RNO)  led a selloff by carmakers, sliding 4.2
percent. Etablissements Maurel & Prom SA surged the most since
2003 amid takeover speculation.  The  Stoxx Europe 600 Index (SXXP)  dropped 0.4 percent to 242.56 in
London. The gauge yesterday climbed 0.6 percent as investors
shrugged off a surge in Spanish borrowing costs. The Stoxx 600
has still  fallen 11 percent from its high  this year on March 16.  “The most interesting development for me has been the move
higher in bund yields,” said Ioan Smith, a director at Knight
Capital Europe Ltd. in London. “Investors are clearly becoming
concerned about  Germany ’s growing liabilities associated with
the  euro zone  and suggests there is an element of tail risk
being priced in.”  Germany sold 4.04 billion euros ($5.08 billion) of 10-year
bunds today at an average yield of 1.52 percent, up from a rate
of 1.47 percent at the last auction on May 16. Investors bid for
5.81 billion euros of the bunds, above the 5 billion-euro
maximum sales target for the auction, the Bundesbank said.  Italy Sells Debt  In Italy, borrowing costs surged at the sale of 6.5 billion
euros of bills. The Rome-based Treasury sold the one-year
securities at 3.972 percent, 1.6 percentage points more than the
2.34 percent at the previous auction on May 11. Investors bid
for 1.73 times the amount offered, down from 1.79 times last
month.  National benchmark indexes fell in 11 of the 18 markets in
western Europe. France’s CAC 40 lost 0.6 percent, the U.K.’s
FTSE 100 rose 0.2 percent and Germany’s DAX fell 0.1 percent.
Spain’s IBEX 35 rose 1.4 percent as shares of  Inditex SA (ITX)  surged
to a record.  Stocks also slid today after retail sales in the U.S.
slipped in May for a second month as slower employment and
subdued wage gains damped demand. The 0.2 percent decrease
followed a similar decline in April that was previously reported
as a gain, the Commerce Department release showed.  In the euro area,  industrial production  declined for a
second month in April. Output in the 17-nation currency zone
slipped 0.8 percent from March, when it fell a revised 0.1
percent, according to the the European Union’s statistics
office. Economists had projected a drop of 1.2 percent.  SKF Forecast  SKF tumbled 7.3 percent to 133.20 kronor in Stockholm, its
biggest decline since August, after the company reported
“slightly lower” demand for its products and services in the
second quarter than in the same period a year earlier.  The Swedish engineering company, whose products are used by
customers in the construction, automotive and aviation
businesses globally, also said it has adjusted manufacturing to
respond to weaker demand.  Konecranes Oyj (KCR1V) , the world’s biggest supplier of industrial
cranes, tumbled 7 percent to 18.52 euros.  Schneider Electric SA (SU) 
and  Alstom SA (ALO)  lost 5.1 percent to 41.67 euros and 5 percent to
23.30 euros, respectively in Paris trading.  Renault led a selloff by  carmakers , falling 4.2 percent to
30.98 euros as  Carlos Ghosn , chief executive officer of Renault
and Nissan Motor Co., forecast “three to four more years of
stagnation” in Europe’s auto industry, according to a Reuters
report.  “We are preparing for tough times,” he said at an
industry breakfast in New York yesterday.  European Tire Market  Pirelli & C. (PC)  SpA lost 3.4 percent to 7.72 euros as Morgan
Stanley said tire volumes were “not picking up and mass pricing
is on its way down” after a visit to the Essen tire show,
according to a report. Even so, Morgan Stanley reiterated its
overweight recommendation for the shares.  Michelin & Cie. slid 3.5 percent to 46.40 euros and
 Continental AG (CON)  lost 2.4 percent to 66.20 euros.  Elsewhere,  J Sainsbury Plc (SBRY)  dropped 2.6 percent to 283.5
pence after the company said revenue at stores open at least a
year rose 1.4 percent in the 12 weeks ended June 9, excluding
gasoline sales. That missed the 1.8 percent median estimate of
nine analysts compiled by Bloomberg and was less than the
previous quarter’s 2.6 percent increase.  Maurel & Prom Rallies  Maurel & Prom surged 18 percent to 12.31 euros, its biggest
rally in nine years. The Guardian reported that  Royal Dutch
Shell Plc (RDSA)  may be interested in the French oil explorer without
saying where it got the information.  Spokesmen for Shell and Maurel & Prom declined to comment
when contacted by Bloomberg News.  Last month, Shell’s bid for Cove Energy Plc was topped by
 PTT Exploration & Production Pcl (PTTEP) , Thailand’s biggest oil
producer. Shell rose 1.5 percent to 2,090.5 pence.  Inditex jumped 12 percent to 75.40 euros, its highest price
since it issued shares to the public in 2001. The world’s
largest clothing retailer reported a 30 percent jump in first-
quarter profit to 432 million euros after increasing store
openings in Asia. That beat the average analyst estimate of 381
million euros, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Nautical Petroleum Plc (NPE)  soared 55 percent to 462 pence after
 Cairn Energy Plc (CNE) , the U.K. oil explorer with assets from
Greenland to Nepal, agreed to buy the company for 414 million
pounds ($645 million) to add fields in the  North Sea . Cairn will
pay Nautical shareholders 450 pence a share. Cairn shares slid
1.1 percent to 288.7 pence.  To contact the reporter on this story:
