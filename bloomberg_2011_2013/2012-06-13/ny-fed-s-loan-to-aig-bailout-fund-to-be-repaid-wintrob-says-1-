The Federal Reserve Bank of  New
York ’s loan to a fund created to rescue  American International
Group Inc. (AIG)  will be repaid, AIG SunAmerica Chief Executive
Officer Jay Wintrob said.  Proceeds from asset auctions of the fund, called Maiden
Lane III LLC, will be used to pay off the loan, Wintrob said
today during an investor conference. New York-based AIG will
receive proceeds from future auctions, he said.  Maiden Lane III was created in 2008 to assume
collateralized debt obligations as part of a government bailout
of AIG that grew to $182.3 billion. The New York Fed lent the
entity $24.3 billion and AIG contributed $5 billion in equity.  “With the auctions completed prior to this week, the Fed
loan will be fully repaid,” Wintrob said during the conference
sponsored by Morgan Stanley in New York. “We’re pleased that
the  Federal Reserve  has decided to cash in now and capitalize on
the strong demand for those MLIII assets.”  AIG will receive the next $5.6 billion in proceeds from
auctions of Maiden Lane III assets, Wintrob said. After that,
the New York Fed will receive two thirds of the cash and AIG
will get one third.  Andrea Priest, a spokeswoman for the New York Fed, declined
to comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
