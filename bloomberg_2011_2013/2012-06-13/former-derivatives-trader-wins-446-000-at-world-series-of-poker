Andy Frankenberger, a former equity
derivatives trader turned professional poker player, collected
$446,000 with his second win at a  World Series of Poker  event.  Frankenberger, 39, outlasted a field of 179 players to win
the 17th event on the  World Series  schedule yesterday in Las
Vegas, where he beat Phil Ivey in head-to-head action to take
the top prize in the $10,000 pot-limit hold ‘em tournament.  Frankenberger left the trading desk at  BNP Paribas SA (BNP)  in
New York three years ago to travel and in 2010 started playing
tournament poker, which has now turned into his career. He won
his first World Series of Poker event last year and earned a
second gold bracelet by taking down Ivey, who has won eight WSOP
events.  Frankenberger, who also worked at JPMorgan Chase & Co.
after earning an economics degree from  Duke University , has now
won about $2.5 million in live tournaments.  “I left  Wall Street  having no idea that I was going to
play poker professionally,” Frankenberger told the World Series
of Poker’s website. “With the successes, I decided to do so.
And it was a great decision. I’m really enjoying myself, I’m
traveling, playing poker. I couldn’t be any happier.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
