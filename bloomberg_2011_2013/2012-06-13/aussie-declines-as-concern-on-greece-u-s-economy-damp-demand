Australia’s dollar fell against its
U.S. counterpart as a drop in U.S. retail sales and concern
Greece’s elections will disrupt the euro bloc reduced demand for
assets linked to growth.  New Zealand ’s dollar remained lower as the  Reserve Bank  of
New Zealand left its benchmark  interest rate  at 2.5 percent.
Greek politician Alexis Tsipras said he expects the European
Union will do all it can to keep the nation in the euro even if
he wins elections and carries out his promise to repeal
austerity measures. Greece votes June 17.  The Aussie fell 0.3 percent to 99.34 U.S. cents yesterday

percent to 77.30 U.S. cents and fell 0.7 percent to 61.38 yen.  The median estimate of 16 economists in a Bloomberg News
survey called for the RBNZ to leave rates unchanged.  Stocks weakened, with the  MSCI World Index (MXWO)  of equities
falling as much as 5.3 percent, after the U.S. Commerce
Department reported a 0.2 percent decrease in  retail sales  in

previously reported as a gain.  To contact the reporter on this story:
