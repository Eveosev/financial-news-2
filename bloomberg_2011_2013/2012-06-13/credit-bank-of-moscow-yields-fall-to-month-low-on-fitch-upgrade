The yield on OAO  Credit Bank of
Moscow (MSKB) ’s two-year note dropped to the lowest level in almost a
month after  Fitch Ratings  upgraded the Russian lender’s debt.  The bank’s 5 billion rubles ($153 million) of local bonds
due June 2014 rose, cutting the yield by nine basis points, or
0.09 percentage point, to 11.69 percent, the lowest on a closing
basis since May 17.  The lender’s credit rating was raised one step to BB-, the
third-highest investment grade status, Fitch said in a
statement. The upgrade “reflects the broadening of the bank’s
franchise and expected improvement of the quality of its capital
following the upcoming equity injections from two international
financial institutions,” it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
