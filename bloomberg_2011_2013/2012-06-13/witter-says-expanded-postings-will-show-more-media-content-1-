Twitter Inc. said users of its
microblogging service who post links to other websites will be
able to see an expanded view of content from new partner sites,
such as the Wall Street Journal and  MSNBC .  The company, which lets users share 140-character messages,
said the expanded postings will show video, photos and longer
excerpts of news stories from a broader list of media partners.
The service begins rolling out to website and mobile users
today, Michael Sippey, product team director at San Francisco-
based Twitter, said in a  blog post .  “This is going to cause people to stay on twitter.com,
because all of the sudden you have a little bit more
information,” said Brian Blau, an analyst at Gartner Inc. “You
can read the next tweet and stay on the site, being a more
valuable consumer of the site.”  The service will be available on Twitter for Apple Inc.’s
iPhone and for devices that use Google Inc.’s Android soon,
Sippey said. The company, with more than 140 million users,
expects to generate at least $1 billion in sales in 2014, two
people with knowledge of the matter have said, based on
advertising demand.  To contact the reporter on this story:
