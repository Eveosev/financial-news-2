Philip Morris International Inc. (PM) ,
the world’s largest tobacco company, said it will buy back $18
billion in stock over the next three years.  The maker of Marlboro cigarettes said the new program will
begin in August, following a previous three-year, $12 billion
repurchase plan that began in May 2010 and will end ahead of
schedule. The New York-based company also set a quarterly
 dividend  of 77 cents per share, it said in a statement.  The buyback is the equivalent of a 12 percent stake, based
on a market value of $145 billion dollars, Bloomberg
calculations show.  Philip Morris  reiterated a pledge to
repurchase $6 billion of stock this year.  “It’s good news, better than expected, and underlines how
strong PMI’s cash generating ability is,”  Erik Bloomquist , an
analyst at Bernenberg Bank, said in an e-mail.  Philip Morris, which was created in 2008 when  Altria Group
Inc. (MO)  spun off its businesses outside the U.S., has boosted
profit for 10 straight quarters as Chief Executive Officer Louis Camilleri has raised cigarette prices and boosted Marlboro sales
in Asia and  Latin America .  First-quarter profit rose 13 percent to $2.16 billion,
Philip Morris said in April. The company  raised  1.35 billion
euros ($1.7 billion) of long-term debt with coupons of less than
3 percent last month in the largest offering in the currency
from a U.S.-based company since May 2009, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
