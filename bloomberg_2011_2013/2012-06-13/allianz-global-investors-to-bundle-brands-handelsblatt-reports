Allianz SE (ALV) ’s asset management unit
Allianz Global Investors will bundle all brands under its own
name, Handelsblatt reported, citing James Dilworth, head of
Allianz Global Investors’ European business.  The concentration on one brand is meant to make it easier
to compete against Pimco, another unit of Allianz, the newspaper
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
