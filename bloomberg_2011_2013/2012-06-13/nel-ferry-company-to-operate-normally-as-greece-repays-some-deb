Maritime Company of Lesvos SA  will
continue all trips to public service routes after the Greek
government promised to immediately repay part of the 8.5 million
euros ($10.6 million) it owes the ferry operator.  “We were assured that part of the money owed will be
repaid immediately and subsequently all routes to all remote
islands will continue to be carried out normally,” NEL, as the
company is called, said today in a statement on its  website .  The Greek government subsidizes certain water and air
routes that are the only connections to main ports or airports
because transport to these places is deemed a public service.  The payment has been overdue since October, NEL said,
adding that it hopes the situation will be resolved once a
government is formed.  Greece  is holding a second election on June 17 after a May
6 vote failed to produce a government.  To contact the reporter on this story:
