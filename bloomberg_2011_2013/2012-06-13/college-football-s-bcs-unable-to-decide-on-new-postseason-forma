Executives of the  Bowl Championship
Series , the bowl games that crown a college football champion,
ended their meetings yesterday without reaching a consensus on
the format for a new postseason.  The BCS is managed by the 11 Bowl Subdivision conferences,
and the University of  Notre Dame , which comprise college
football’s top level. Its purpose is to match the two top-ranked
teams in a national championship game and to create competitive
match-ups in the four other BCS bowl games.  “We made progress in our meeting today to discuss the
future of college football’s postseason,” the BCS said
yesterday in a statement. “We are approaching consensus on many
issues, and we recognize there are also several issues that
require additional conversations at both the commissioner and
university president levels.  The group meets again June 20 in  Chicago  and may have a
plan ready to present to its school presidents in Washington on
June 26.  “We have more work to do and more discussions to have with
our presidents, who are the parties that will make the final
decisions,” the group said in the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
