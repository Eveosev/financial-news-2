The  European Central Bank  will start
requiring lenders to provide data on the loans in asset-backed
securities used as collateral for funding by the end of this
year.  The data requirement will initially cover loans in
residential mortgage-backed securities, pending the approval of
the ECB’s governing council, said  Fernando Gonzalez , the bank’s
head of strategy, who was speaking at the 2012 IMN/AFME Global
ABS conference in Brussels.  Loan-level reporting for commercial mortgage-backed
securities and bonds backed by financing to small and medium-
sized businesses will start in 2013, he said. Loan reporting for
other classes of securities such as bonds backed by car loans
will start in 2014.  The Frankfurt-based central bank is seeking to improve the
quality of the assets it takes on as loan security while
improving confidence among investors. Banks create ABS by
pooling the proceeds of consumer and property loans, typically
allowing them to raise money more cheaply than by issuing
unsecured debt.  To contact the reporter on this story:
