The cost of insuring against default
on European sovereign and corporate debt fell, according to BNP
Paribas SA.  The Markit iTraxx SovX Western Europe Index of credit-
default swaps on 15 governments fell three basis points to 321
at 8:08 a.m. in London. A decline signals improvement in
perceptions of  credit quality .  Contracts on the Markit iTraxx Crossover Index of 50
companies with mostly high-yield credit ratings dropped 5.5
basis points to 710.5. The Markit iTraxx Europe Index of 125
companies with investment-grade ratings fell one to 182.  The Markit iTraxx Financial Index linked to senior debt of
25 banks and insurers was three basis points lower at 290.25 and
the subordinated index declined seven to 473.  A basis point on a credit-default swap protecting 10
million euros ($12.5 million) of debt from default for five
years is equivalent to 1,000 euros a year. Swaps pay the buyer
face value in exchange for the underlying securities or the cash
equivalent should a borrower fail to adhere to its debt
agreements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
