(Corrects headline and second paragraph to remove
erroneous description of forecast.)  Nucor Corp. (NUE)  said it expects second-
quarter earnings will be 35 cents to 40 cents a share.  Excluding an impairment charge, the profit is “somewhat
below the qualitative guidance” the company gave when reporting
its first-quarter results, when it said “we currently expect to
see only a modest improvement in earnings,” the Charlotte,
North Carolina-based company said today in a statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
