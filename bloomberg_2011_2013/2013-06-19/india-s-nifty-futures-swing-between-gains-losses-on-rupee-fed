Indian (SENSEX)  stocks headed for a one-week
low as investors await the outcome of the two-day Federal
Reserve meeting in the U.S.  The S&P BSE Sensex dropped 0.4 percent to 19,141.64 at 9:52
a.m. in Mumbai, poised for the lowest level since June 13.
 Infosys Ltd. (INFO)  decreased for the first time in four days, leading
its peers lower. State explorer  Oil & Natural Gas Corp. (ONGC)  headed
for its lowest level in three months.  Fed Chairman Ben S. Bernanke will speak to reporters at the
end of the meeting today. More than $2 trillion has been lost
from global markets since May 22, when Bernanke signaled that
the central bank may trim its asset-buying program that has
boosted foreign inflows into  emerging markets . India’s rupee
dropped the most in a week yesterday, nearing a record low,
while overseas funds sold the nation’s stocks for a fifth
straight day on June 17.  The Sensex has slid 4.4 percent since Bernanke said the
U.S. policy makers could scale back its stimulus program if
employment showed sustainable improvement.  Overseas investors sold a net $18 million of Indian stocks
on June 17, paring this year’s inflows to $14.9 billion. That’s
still a record for the period, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
