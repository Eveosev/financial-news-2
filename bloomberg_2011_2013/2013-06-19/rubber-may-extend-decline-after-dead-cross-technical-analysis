Rubber may extend a  bear market  and
reach the lowest level in more than three years by the end of
December after forming a dead-cross pattern, according to
technical analysis by research company JSC Corp. in  Tokyo .  The 50-day moving average for futures on the Tokyo
Commodity Exchange fell below the 200-day average this month
after breaching the 150-day average at the end of April,
signaling downward momentum is accelerating, said analyst Takaki Shigemoto.  The 50-day average also exited the cloud pattern on
Ichimoku charts last week, signaling futures may stay bearish
for another six months, Shigemoto said. The most-active contract
on the Tokyo bourse may breach last year’s low of 205.6 yen a
kilogram ($2,152 a metric ton) and reach cheapest level since
October 2009, he said.  “Rubber is struggling with triple blows -- negative chart
signals, bearish fundamentals and a stalled rally in the dollar
against the yen,” Shigemoto said in a telephone interview.  Rubber for delivery in November settled at 236.5 yen in
Tokyo yesterday, retreating 30 percent from this year’s peak of
337.8 yen reached Feb. 6. It is 56 percent below the record high
of 535.7 yen set in February 2011, as global production is
forecast to exceed consumption for a third year.  The commodity’s surplus will expand 57 percent to a record
490,000 tons this year, enough to meet U.S. demand for six
months, according to RCMA Commodities Asia Group, the Singapore-based company that has traded rubber for nine decades. The yen
traded at 95.42 per dollar at 9:33 a.m., rebounding from a four-year low of 103.74 reached last month.  In  technical analysis , investors and analysts study charts
of trading patterns and prices to predict changes in a security,
commodity, currency or index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
