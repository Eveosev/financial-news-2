Valeant Pharmaceuticals
International Inc. (VRX) , the drug distributor acquiring Bausch & Lomb
Holdings Inc., issued $3.23 billion of debt in the U.S. to help
fund the purchase.  The company sold $1.6 billion of 6.75 percent, five-year
notes at 150 basis points more than similar-maturity Treasuries
and $1.63 billion of 7.5 percent, eight-year securities paying
531 basis points more, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
The debt is rated B1 by Moody’s Investors Service and B by
Standard & Poor’s, the data show.  Valeant dropped plans to issue 10-year notes, instead
offering the five-year securities, after starting to market the
debt last week, a person with knowledge of the transaction said
June 25.  The Laval, Quebec-based company will use the proceeds from
the bond sale and $4.05 billion in loans to support its $8.7
billion acquisition of Bausch & Lomb and to repay about $4.2
billion of borrowings by the Warburg Pincus LLC-owned eye-care
company, it said in a May 30 regulatory filing.  Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Bank of America Corp., Barclays
Plc, JPMorgan Chase & Co., Morgan Stanley, and Royal Bank of
Canada managed the bond offering, Bloomberg data show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
