Moelis & Co., the advisory firm
founded by  Kenneth Moelis  in 2007, eliminated the jobs of about
20 bankers in New York and  London , people with knowledge of the
matter said.  The cuts, which reduced the firm’s global workforce of 600
by about three percent, were at the vice president and senior
vice president level, said the people, who asked not to be named
because the reductions haven’t been made public.  Moelis reduced its staff as part of its six-month business
review, the people said. Kenneth Moelis declined to comment
through a spokeswoman.  The investment bank ranks 11th among companies advising on
mergers this year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. It
ranked 24th in 2012.  Barclays Plc, UBS AG, and other firms have trimmed
investment banking staff this year to cut costs amid a slump in
mergers and acquisitions. The global volume of deals has dropped
more than 3 percent to about $906 billion in 2013 compared with
the year-earlier period, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
