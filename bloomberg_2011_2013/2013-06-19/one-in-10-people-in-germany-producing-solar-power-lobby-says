About one in 10 people living in
 Germany  are producing solar power, the German Solar Industry
Association said.  A total of 8.5 million people live in buildings that use
solar systems to generate electricity or heat, the group said
today in an e-mailed statement, citing figures it compiled.  The units will prevent the production of about 24 million
metric tons of carbon-dioxide emissions this year, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
