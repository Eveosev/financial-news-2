HollyFrontier Corp. (HFC) ’s Tulsa East
refinery units, undergoing maintenance that began last month,
probably won’t start up until July, said a person familiar with
the matter.  Some workers have begun leaving the site as the maintenance
nears an end, said the person, who asked not to be identified
because the information isn’t public.  The 70,300-barrel-a-day  plant  originally planned repairs on
a crude unit, reformer, naphtha hydrotreaters and panex unit in
March, then delayed the turnaround to start in May, the company
said in a May 7 earnings call with investors.  Julia Heidenreich, a company spokeswoman in Dallas, didn’t
immediately respond to an e-mail seeking comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
