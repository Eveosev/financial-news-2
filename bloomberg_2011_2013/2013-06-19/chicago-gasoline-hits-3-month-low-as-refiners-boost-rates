Chicago  gasoline weakened to the
lowest level in more than three months as area refineries
 processed  more oil last week, signaling more production that may
boost supply.  Conventional, 85-octane gasoline, or CBOB, in Chicago slid
9 cents to a discount of 32 cents a gallon versus futures on the
New York Mercantile Exchange, the biggest gap since March 1,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg at 4:17 p.m.  Refineries in the U.S. Midwest, known as PADD 2, processed
 3.17 million barrels  a day of crude and other feedstocks in the
week ended June 14, the most since May 3, according to U.S.
Energy Information Administration data. Inventories in the
region climbed 507,000 barrels to 49.7 million barrels last
week, a fourth consecutive weekly gain.  Supplies are poised to climb further as  BP Plc (BP) ’s Whiting,
Indiana, refinery is said to be preparing the restart of a
250,000-barrel-a-day crude unit and as  Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) ’s
Joliet,  Illinois , refinery continues its return from a plantwide
turnaround. Phillips 66 also reported emissions because of
startup activities at a hydrocracker at its Wood River,
Illinois, plant.  The three refineries have the ability to process 1.01
million barrels a day, representing 27 percent of Midwest
refining capacity, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The  3-2-1 crack spread  in Chicago, a rough measure of
refining margins based on West Texas Intermediate oil in
Cushing,  Oklahoma , fell $2.15 to $14.91 a barrel, the lowest
level since Jan. 16. Chicago gasoline was 10 cents a gallon
 below  the same fuel on the U.S. Gulf Coast, after reaching a
$1.01 premium June 3.  Gulf Coast CBOB slipped 4 cents to 22 cents below Nymex
futures.  To contact the reporter on this story:
