Southeastern Asset Management Inc.,
the investment firm that said  Dell Inc. (DELL)  is worth $24 a share,
may have locked in a loss of $225 million by selling half of its
stake to fellow dissident  Carl Icahn  at a lower price.  The Memphis, Tennessee-based firm, run by O. Mason Hawkins
and Staley Cates, agreed to sell 71.7 million Dell shares to
Icahn at $13.52 each, according to a Schedule 13D filed
yesterday with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. The
firm had paid $2.4 billion to acquire 146.1 million shares,
according to earlier regulatory filings, indicating its cost was
about $16.66 a share.  The price Icahn paid is 1 percent below the $13.65 a share
that  Michael Dell , the company’s chairman and chief executive
officer, has offered stockholders in a leveraged  buyout . When
the buyout was announced in February, Southeastern sent a letter
to Dell’s board expressing “extreme disappointment” with the
bid, saying it “grossly undervalues” the computer maker.  The investment firm, which held an 8.5 percent stake at the
time, later teamed with Icahn to formulate a rival offer that
would maintain Dell’s status as a publicly traded company. Icahn
issued a letter yesterday urging Dell to repurchase company
stock, in part with financing he would provide, as an
alternative to the CEO’s buyout.  Southeastern, whose mutual funds include the $7.7 billion
 Longleaf Partners Fund (LLPFX) , continues to hold 71.7 million Dell
 shares . Its cost basis in the remaining stake equals about
$14.98 a share, according to yesterday’s filing.  Southeastern started buying Dell stock in the third quarter
of 2005 and built its stake to 130.9 million shares by the
middle of 2007, when the price ranged from $19.91 to $41.54 a
share. Southeastern’s stake varied in size after that, reaching
a high of 168 million shares at the end of the first quarter of
2009, when the stock traded at an average price of $9.59 a
share.  Icahn didn’t immediately return a telephone call seeking
comment, nor did Lee Harper, a Southeastern spokeswoman.  To contact the reporter on this story:
