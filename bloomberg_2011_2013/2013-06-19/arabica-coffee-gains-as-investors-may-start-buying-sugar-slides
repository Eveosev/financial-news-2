Arabica coffee climbed for a second
day in  New York  on speculation investors will start buying
futures just as Brazil, the world’s leading producer, authorized
credit lines to support growers. Sugar fell and cocoa rose.  Large and small speculators excluding  index funds  tripled
bets on lower coffee prices in the four weeks to June 11, U.S.
Commodity Futures Trading Commission data compiled by Bloomberg
showed. Brazil approved 3.16 billion-reais ($1.4 billion) in
credit for coffee growers to fund activities including storage,
purchases, option contracts and plantation recovery, the  Finance
Ministry  said in a statement yesterday.  “With the funds having a large short position at the C, it
is less likely at this moment to see the breaching of the $1.10
per pound,”  Rodrigo Costa , a trading director at Elmsford, New-York-based Caturra Coffee Corp., said in a report e-mailed
yesterday, referring to the arabica futures contract known as C.
“A strong price recovery seems unlikely as well.”  Arabica coffee for September delivery was up 0.3 percent to
$1.239 a pound by 6:10 a.m. on ICE Futures U.S. in New York.
Robusta coffee for September delivery gained 0.1 percent to
$1,765 a metric ton on NYSE Liffe in  London .  Brazil is harvesting its 2013-14 crop and production will
be a record for a year in which trees enter the lower-yielding
half of a two-year cycle, the government estimates. Output will
be 48.6 million bags, crop-forecasting agency known as Conab
said on May 14. A bag of coffee usually weighs 132 pounds.
Speculators’ net-short position, or bets on lower prices,
amounted to 33,569 contracts, CFTC data showed.  Production Costs  Arabica coffee is trading below the cost of production in
 Brazil , government data showed. Growers in Guaxupe, where
Cooxupe, the country’s biggest coffee exporting company is
located, produce beans for 377 reais a bag, data on the Conab
website showed. That would mean costs of about $1.31 a pound, or
5.8 percent above prices now.  “In a scenario of coffee surplus, prices tend to find the
lowest production cost,” Costa said. “I dare to say that we
have seen these levels to be breached and painfully kept below
production costs for some time.”  Raw sugar for October delivery was 0.5 percent lower at
16.98 cents a pound in New York. White, or refined, sugar for
August delivery fell 0.1 percent to $488.90 a ton in London.  Cocoa for September delivery was up 0.4 percent at $2,219 a
ton on ICE. Cocoa for delivery in September gained 0.3 percent
to 1,456 pounds ($2,274) a ton on NYSE Liffe.  To contact the reporter on this story:
