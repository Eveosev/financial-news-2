The global sugar surplus for the
2013-14 season may drop to a four-year low amid rising demand
for ethanol in  Brazil , research firm Datagro Ltd. said.  Sugar output will exceed demand by 430,000 metric tons in
the season starting Oct. 1, compared with a previous estimate
for a surplus of 6.18 million tons, Plinio Nastari, president of
Datagro, told reporters today in Sao Paulo.  “Sugar prices simply don’t pay the bills of mills, and
ethanol is on the verge of becoming extremely attractive to
consumers,” Nastari said.  Ethanol is appealing to drivers in Brazil when the price of
the biofuel is of as much as 65 percent that of gasoline,
Nastari said.  Gas stations in Sao Paulo state, which accounts for 36
percent of the country’s passenger-car fleet, are offering
ethanol for 62 percent of the price of the oil-based fuel, he
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
