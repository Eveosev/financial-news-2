HRT Participacoes em Petroleo SA ,
the oil company exploring in the Amazon and Namibia, rose to the
highest in three weeks after  Grupo BTG Pactual (BBTG11) ’s investments in
the oil industry fueled positive sentiment.  Rio de Janeiro-based HRT gained 8.7 percent to 2.50 reais
at 12:27 p.m. in  Sao Paulo  after rising to as much as 2.68
reais, the highest since May 27. The stock increased 20 percent
yesterday, the most since August. Brazil’s benchmark stock index
was down 0.7 percent.  HRT is benefiting from Sao Paulo-based BTG’s decision to
move more aggressively into the oil industry, Luana Helsinger an
analyst at brokerage GBM Brasil, said by phone from Rio. BTG
said June 17 it agreed to buy 50 percent of  Petroleo Brasileiro
SA (PETR3) ’s assets in Angola, Benin, Gabon, Namibia, Nigeria and
Tanzania for $1.5 billion.  The bank plans to develop a large oil and gas company to
tap other opportunities, O Estado de S. Paulo reported
yesterday, without saying where it got the information. The bank
signed on March 6 a so-called strategic agreement with
billionaire  Eike Batista ’s holding company EBX Group Co., whose
biggest unit is oil producer  OGX Petroleo e Gas Participacoes
SA .  BTG and HRT declined to comment on potential partnerships
when contacted by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
