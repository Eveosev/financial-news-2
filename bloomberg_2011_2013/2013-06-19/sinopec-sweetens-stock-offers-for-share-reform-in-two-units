China Petroleum & Chemical Corp. (600028) ,
also known as Sinopec, plans to offer investors more of its
domestic shares in Sinopec Shanghai Petrochemical Co. in
exchange for the right to make all of the unitâ€™s stock tradable.  Holders of Sinopec Shanghai A shares will receive five
shares for every 10 held, compared with the 4.5 shares proposed
previously, according to a filing by Shanghai-listed in Sinopec
Shanghai yesterday.  Separately, Sinopec and Citic Ltd. will give retail
investors in Sinopec Yizheng Chemical Fibre Co. five shares for
every 10 held, compared with the 4.5 shares proposed previously,
to make all shares tradable, according to an exchange  statement .  The two Sinopec units will also propose stock option
incentive plans within 12 months of their non-tradable shares
becoming tradable, according to the statements. The controlling
holders pledged not to sell the newly unlocked shares for 12
months, the companies said.  Shares of Sinopec  Shanghai  and Yizheng Chemical will both
resume trading in Shanghai tomorrow, according to the filings.
