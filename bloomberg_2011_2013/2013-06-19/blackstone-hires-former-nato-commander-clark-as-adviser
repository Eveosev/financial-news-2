Blackstone Group LP (BX)  hired Wesley Clark, the former NATO Supreme Allied Commander in Europe and a
one-time U.S. presidential candidate, to advise on its
investments in energy companies.  Clark will serve on the board of Blackstone-owned Fisterra
Energy, the New York-based private-equity firm said today in a
statement. Blackstone also hired Lars Thunell, the former chief
executive officer of International Finance Corp., the financing
unit of the World Bank, to join Fisterra’s board and advise
Blackstone on its energy investments.  Private-equity firms hire high-ranking executives and
former officials to expand relationships with corporations and
governments worldwide, as well as to benefit from their industry
experiences.  KKR & Co. (KKR) , the buyout company run by Henry Kravis
and  George Roberts , hired former CIA director David Petraeus
last month to run a new unit for public policy and economic
research at the New York-based firm.  “General Clark’s experience and breadth of knowledge will
be invaluable to both Fisterra and Blackstone, as we continue to
invest in and construct power projects around the world,” Sean Klimczak, a partner in Blackstone’s private-equity business who
focuses on energy, said in the statement.  Clark, a retired four-star general and graduate of West
Point and Oxford University, left the military in 2000. He ran
unsuccessfully as a Democratic candidate for president in the
2004 elections.  To contact the reporter on this story:
