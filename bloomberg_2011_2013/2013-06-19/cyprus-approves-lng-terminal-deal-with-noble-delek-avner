Cyprus approved today a provisional
deal with Texas-based  Noble Energy Inc. (NBL)  and two Israeli
companies for the construction of an onshore liquefied natural
gas terminal, deputy government spokesman Viktoras Papadopoulos
said.  The Cypriot government approved a decision to sign the
memorandum of understanding with Noble, Delek Drilling LP and
 Avner Oil Exploration LLP (AVNRL) , Papadopoulos said in Nicosia today,

government press office website.  Noble, Delek and Avner are already partners in  Israel  where
Noble has a 36 percent stake in the Tamar natural gas field and
the two Israeli companies each has a 15.6 percent stake.  To contact the reporter on this story:
