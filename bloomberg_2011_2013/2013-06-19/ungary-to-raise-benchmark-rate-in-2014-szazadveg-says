Hungary ’s central bank, which has
cut the  main interest rate  in each of the past 10 months, will
probably be forced to raise it next year, according to
Szazadveg, a think tank that advises the government on policy.  The Magyar Nemzeti Bank may reduce the two-week deposit
rate to as low as 3.5 percent in the next three to four months,
from the current record-low 4.5 percent, before being forced to
raise it to about 5 percent in 2014, Budapest-based  Szazadveg 
said yesterday in an e-mailed report.  Speculation that the U.S. Federal Reserve may reduce its
stimulus has prompted declines in emerging-market assets and
narrowed the room of central banks there for monetary easing.
Inflation near a 39-year low and an economy emerging from a
recession last year are “consistent with a lower central  bank
rate ,” Magyar Nemzeti Bank policy makers said, according to the
minutes of their May 28 meeting.  “The era of cheap money may be at an end,” Szazadveg said
in its report, citing rising yields on 10-year U.S. and Japanese
government bonds and Fed Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke ’s May 22
statement that the Fed “could” scale back its debt purchases
if it was confident in “sustainable improvement” in the U.S.
employment outlook. “We consider that as a result yields may be
higher at the end of next year and the benchmark rate may return
to around 5 percent,” Szazadveg said.  The yield on the 10-year Hungarian government forint bond
rose to 5.94 percent today from 5.87 percent yesterday and
compared with a record-low 4.93 percent on May 16.  Investors are scaling back their bets for Hungary’s scope
for further monetary easing. The six-month forward-rate traded
41 basis below the Budapest interbank offered rate level today,
indicating that investors expect at most a half-point cut in the
rest of 2013. That compares with the 1 1/4 percentage-point
reduction priced in on May 15.  The next rate-setting meeting is June 25, with all 14
economists in a  Bloomberg survey  predicting a quarter-point cut
to 4.25 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
