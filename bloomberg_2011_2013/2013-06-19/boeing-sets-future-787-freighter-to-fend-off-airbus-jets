Boeing Co. (BA)  has picked the 787-9
Dreamliner as the variant to be used for a future freighter, a
step toward opening a new market for the plane and extending a
lead over  Airbus SAS (EAD)  in cargo aircraft.  The model will be based on the 787-9, the mid-sized version
of the planes in that  family , and eventually would replace the
767 freighter, Boeing Commercial Airplanes Vice President Mike Bair said in an interview at the  Paris Air Show . He didn’t give
a precise timeline.  “At some point in the far distant future the -9 is the
freighter platform,” Bair said. “It’s the longest-range
version and because of that it ends up being the highest-density
freighter that we could make.”  A freight-only Dreamliner would create more buyers for a
plane that Chicago-based Boeing pitches as having a 20 percent
fuel-economy boost over comparable twin-engine jets. It also
would extend Boeing’s wide-body sales lead, because Airbus’s
largest models, the A350 and A380, don’t have cargo versions to
compete with the U.S. company’s 777 and 747 freighters.  From the beginning of the Dreamliner’s development, Boeing
designed the plane’s fuselage so it could efficiently handle
pallets, Bair said. On the 787-9, which is set for its first
flight this year, systems were cleared in the hull to install a
cargo door, he said.  List Prices  The 787-9 sells for $243.6 million at  list price , while the
767 freighter -- in service since 1995 -- retails for $185.4
million, according to Boeing’s website. Airlines typically get a
discount.  Boeing hasn’t published a list price for a freight-only
787-9, and Bair said it was too early for decisions such as
whether it would come before a cargo version of the 777X, the
upgrade of the twin-engine airliner that is targeted to enter
service by decade’s end. Freight variants are usually the last
plane in an aircraft family to be built.  The 787-9 is a stretched version of the 787-8 Dreamliner,
which made its commercial debut in 2011 after more than three
years of delays. Boeing is lengthening the Dreamliner again for
the 787-10 version that was introduced yesterday in Paris.  To contact the reporter on this story:
