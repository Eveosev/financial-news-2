     June 19 (Bloomberg) --The United Arab Emirates state
security prosecutor referred 30 people, including Emiratis and
Egyptians, to court on charges of setting up a branch of the
Muslim Brotherhood, state-run WAM news agency reported.  “Some of the accused have established, run and managed a
branch of” the Islamist group without a license, WAM reported,
citing the prosecutor. The suspects obtained “financial support
from the secret organization seeking to seize power in the
country,” the prosecutor said, referring to another group
standing trial.  The U.A.E. has cracked down on Islamist groups, which the
government says have been emboldened by popular uprisings that
toppled the leaders of  Egypt , Libya and  Tunisia . Authorities in
January sent 94 citizens to the supreme federal court, charging
them with establishing an underground group to seize power. Most
of the detained belong to a domestic Islamist group known as al-Islah.  After the ousting of  Hosni Mubarak  in Egypt, the Muslim
Brotherhood moved from being the main opposition group to a
driving force in Egypt’s politics, particularly after Mohamed Mursi was elected president in June 2012.  To contact the reporter on this story:
