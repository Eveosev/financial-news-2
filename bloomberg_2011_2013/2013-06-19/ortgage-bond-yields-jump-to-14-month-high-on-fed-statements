Yields on  Fannie Mae  and Freddie Mac
mortgage bonds that guide U.S. home-loan rates rose to the
highest in more than 14 months as the  Federal Reserve  said risks
to the economy have decreased, fueling speculation it will
reduce the pace of its bond buying from $85 billion a month.  Fannie Mae’s 3.5 percent, 30-year securities jumped about
0.2 percentage point to 2.9 percent as of 3:10 p.m. in New York,
the highest since April 2012, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. Yield have climbed from the record-low 1.68 percent
reached in September, when the central bank said it would start 
buying  $40 billion of home-loan debt a month to begin its third
round of bond purchases.  Fed Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said at a press conference
today that the U.S. central bank may “moderate” the pace of
its buying later this year and end the purchases around the
middle of 2014. Members of its Federal Open Market Committee
don’t foresee sales of housing debt following soon after, he
said.  “A strong majority now expects the committee will not sell
agency backed mortgage-backed securities during the process of
normalizing monetary policy, although in the longer run, limited
sales could be used to reduce or eliminate residual MBS
holdings,” Bernanke said in Washington.  Mortgage rates  have soared the most in a decade on
speculation the Fed’s purchases may slow. The interest rate on a
30-year fixed home loan climbed to a 14-month high of 3.98
percent last week, according to data compiled by  Freddie Mac .  To contact the reporter on this story:
