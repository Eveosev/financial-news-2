American International Group Inc. (AIG) 
had its price target raised by Deutsche Bank AG after the bank’s
equity analysts met with Peter Hancock, the chief executive
officer of AIG’s property-casualty unit.  AIG shares will rise to $56, Deutsche Bank’s  Joshua Shanker 
said in a note to investors dated yesterday. His previous share
price estimate was $52.  Shanker is “more confident” that New York-based AIG is
ahead of schedule on a plan to improve margins in its property-casualty business after meeting with Hancock, he said in the
note. The company will probably start paying a  dividend  of 17
cents a share in the third quarter, he said.  “We are more confident about the pace of loss-ratio
improvement offset by less confidence in expense management,”
Shanker wrote. “The engines of this improvement relate to
business mix, improved claims processes, de-emphasis of casualty
business, more scientific approach to modeling loss trends.”  AIG  climbed  less than 1 percent to $45.48 at 12:52 p.m. in
New York and may post its first gain in four trading days. It
has advanced 29 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
