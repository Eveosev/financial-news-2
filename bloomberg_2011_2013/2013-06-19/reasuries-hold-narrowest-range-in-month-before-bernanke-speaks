Treasury 10-year notes fell as
traders speculated whether the  Federal Reserve  will maintain its
$85 billion in monthly bond buying after it ends a two-day
policy meeting today.  Yields on 10- and 30-year securities surged to 14-month
highs over the past month on bets the central bank would slow
the pace of its asset buying.  Long bonds  fluctuated before the
Fed issues a statement and Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  holds a
press conference. A government report yesterday showed that
inflation stayed below the Fed’s 2 percent goal.  “The level of anxiety in the market is extremely high,”
said Thomas di Galoma, head of U.S. rates sales at ED&F Man
Capital Markets in  New York . “Bernanke is very crafty in
getting statements that don’t rattle the markets. We are going
to see a statement that has very little in it, won’t indicate
tapering and will reiterate that inflation is low and that the
economy is still weak in some areas.”  Ten-year yields  rose three basis points, or 0.03 percentage
point, to 2.21 percent at 12:52 p.m. in New York, according to
Bloomberg Bond Trader prices. They dropped two basis points
earlier. The yields reached 2.29 percent, the highest since
April 2012, on June 11. The 1.75 percent notes maturing in May
2023 fell 7/32, or $2.19 per $1,000 face value, to 95 29/32.  Thirty-year bond  yields fell as much as three basis points
and rose two basis points before trading little changed at 3.35
percent. They touched 3.43 percent on June 11, also the highest
since April 2012.  Treasuries lost 1.1 percent this year through yesterday,
according to Bloomberg World Bond Indexes. German bunds fell 1
percent and U.K. gilts declined 1.8 percent.  Press Conference  The  Federal Open Market Committee  will release its
statement and economic forecasts when its meeting ends at 2 p.m.
in  Washington . Bernanke is scheduled to hold a press conference
at 2:30 p.m.  Bernanke said on May 22 that the central bank could reduce
the pace of its monthly bond purchases if there was sustainable
improvement in employment. At the same time, he said a premature
tightening of monetary policy might imperil the economic
recovery.  The central bank will trim its purchases to $65 billion a
month at the Oct. 29-30 FOMC meeting, according to a Bloomberg
survey of economists.  Fed Purchases  The Fed is buying $45 billion in Treasuries and $40 billion
in mortgage securities each month to put downward pressure on
borrowing costs. It has kept the benchmark  target rate  for
overnight loans between banks at zero to 0.25 percent since 2008
to support the economy.  Expectations for the date of the Fed’s first increase to
its benchmark interest-rate target will influence the path of
10-year Treasury yields, said  Jim Vogel , head of agency-debt
research at FTN Financial in  Memphis ,  Tennessee .  “What’s imbedded in the short market about Fed
expectations drives 10-year yields,” Vogel said in a telephone
interview.  “If money-market forward pricing moves the expected date
one meeting from March to April 2015, the fair value on 10s
falls to 2.025 percent,” Vogel wrote in a note to clients
published today. “If it shrinks to December 2014, look for an
increase to 2.35 percent.”  The Labor Department said yesterday consumer prices
increased 1.4 percent in the 12 months ended in May, versus a
1.1 percent annual gain reported in April. The Fed’s inflation
target is 2 percent.  Stimulus Space  Slow inflation gives the Fed room to maintain record
economic stimulus as policy makers seek to lower the jobless
rate from the current 7.6 percent.  Retail sales  rose 0.6 percent in May, the most in three
months, the Commerce Department reported on June 13. A Bloomberg
survey forecast a gain of 0.4 percent.  “People are looking for instant gratification, putting
things in place come next meeting or next month,” said  Sean Murphy , a trader at Societe Generale SA in New York, one of the
21 primary dealers that trade with the Fed. “Tapering is a
natural progression of what we’re seeing in the data. It’s going
to occur, but it’s not now.”  The  spread  between yields on 10-year Treasuries and
Treasury Inflation Protected Securities, a gauge of expectations
for consumer prices over the life of the debt, was at almost the
lowest level in 17 months.  The 10-year  break-even  rate was at 2.12 percentage points
after touching 2 percentage points on June 13, the least since
January 2012. The average over the past 12 months is 2.38
percentage points. The U.S. is scheduled to sell $7 billion in
30-year TIPS tomorrow.  ‘Very Vague’  “The Fed will likely confirm that tapering of the
quantitative-easing program lies ahead but be very vague about
timing,” said Robin Marshall, a fixed-income director in  London 
at Smith & Williamson Investment Management, which oversees the
equivalent of $22 billion. “If inflation falls further, a
reduction would be delayed.”  Treasury trading  volume  at ICAP Plc, the largest inter-dealer broker of  U.S. government debt , has increased to an
average $396 billion a day since the start of May, from $281
billion in the first four months of the year.  To contact the reporters on this story:
