Dominion Resources Inc. introduced a
program to encourage homeowners and businesses to install solar
panels and sell some of the power they generate back to the
company.  Customers of its Dominion Virginia Power unit will be able
to apply for the Solar Purchase Program starting tomorrow, the
company said in a statement today. Richmond, Virginia-based
Dominion will pay 15 cents a kilowatt-hour for the power and
will accept a total of as much as 3 megawatts of systems in the
program.  To contact the reporter on this story:
