China  executed an official in
central Henan province for raping 11 underage girls, the
official Xinhua News Agency said.  Li Xingong, who was the deputy secretary general of the
Communist Party committee for the city of Yongcheng, was put to
death on Tuesday after the Supreme Court gave its approval,
Xinhua said.  China is trying to bring in tougher sentences for crimes
against juveniles, with the countryâ€™s top court promising to
strictly prosecute offenders last month.  In January, a court sentenced a man to death for raping 28
women, five of whom were underage. In southern Hainan province,
a school principal and a local government employee were
prosecuted for rape this month. The principal Chen Zaipeng was
alleged to have taken four primary school girls to a hotel,
according to Xinhua.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
