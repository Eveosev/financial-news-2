Vietnam ’s legislature today voted to
reduce the corporate income tax rate in an attempt to bolster
businesses and encourage investment to revive the economy.  The tax rate will be cut to 22 percent from 25 percent
starting Jan. 1, 2014, and to 20 percent from Jan. 1, 2016, said
National Assembly Vice Chairwoman Nguyen Thi Kim Ngan. The rate
for companies with fewer than 200 employees and total revenue of
less than 20 billion dong ($950,887) will be lowered to 20
percent from July 1, 2013 and to 17 percent from Jan. 1, 2016.  The cuts, while affecting the state’s budget, will “ensure
the competitiveness of Vietnam’s businesses and attract foreign
investment,” Ngan said in a statement. She said 91.6 percent of
lawmakers voted in favor of the reduction in the tax rate.  The government is trying to spur economic  growth  that last
year was the least since 1999 after rising levels of bad debt at
lenders crimped credit to businesses. The  State Bank of Vietnam 
last month cut policy interest rates, the eighth such reduction
since the start of 2012, to support expansion.  Vietnam is aiming for economic growth of 5.5 percent in
2013, in what would be its first period of three straight years
of expansion below 6 percent since 1988, according to
International Monetary Fund data.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
