Saudi Arabia , the biggest crude oil
exporter, shipped 7.44 million barrels a day oil in April, 0.3
percent more than in March, while exports from fellow OPEC
members  Iraq  and Venezuela made steeper gains, data show.  Total Saudi crude production increased to 9.3 million
barrels a day in April from 9.14 million barrels the previous
month, according to official figures published by the Joint
Organisations Data Initiative. The kingdom exported 20,000
barrels a day more than in March, data on the initiative’s
website showed today.  Iraq, the second-largest producer in the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries, shipped 2.62 million barrels a
day in April, up 200,000 barrels a day from the prior month,
while  Venezuela  exported 1.63 million barrels, a gain for the
month of 80,000 a day, the data showed.  Demand for crude from OPEC, which supplies about 40 percent
of the world’s oil, will average 29.8 million barrels a day this
year, the 12-member group estimated in its monthly oil report
published on June 12. The OPEC forecast shows the need for its
crude will be 400,000 barrels a day less this year than in 2012,
taking into account global demand and non-OPEC supply.  Angola’s shipments fell by 10 percent in April to 1.56
million barrels a day, the lowest level since September,
according to the initiative, known as JODI.  Nigeria  raised daily
shipments by 61,000 barrels a day to 2.1 million barrels, the
figures showed.  Iran, Libya,  Kuwait , and the  United Arab Emirates  didn’t
provide data for April.  JODI, supervised by the Riyadh-based International Energy
Forum, uses statistics supplied by national governments to
compile data on imports, exports and output for oil-producing
and consuming nations. The data include crude oil and
condensates and exclude natural-gas liquids.  To contact the reporter on this story:
