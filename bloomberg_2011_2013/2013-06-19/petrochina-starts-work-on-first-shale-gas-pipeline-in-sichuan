PetroChina Co. (857) , the nation’s largest
oil producer, began construction on the country’s first pipeline
dedicated to transporting shale gas.  The pipeline will span 93 kilometers (58 miles) from
Sichuan province’s Changning block and will have a daily
transport volume of 4.5 million cubic meters,  China  National
Petroleum Corp., PetroChina’s parent, said in a  statement  on its
website today. It will link with an existing pipeline that
carries gas to Yunnan province.  PetroChina didn’t provide information on when it will be
completed or on production of the Changning block.  China has the world’s largest shale gas resources,
estimated at 4,746 trillion cubic feet (134.4 trillion cubic
meters), according to data from the Ministry of Land and
Resources and the U.S. Energy Information Administration. Within
China, Sichuan has the largest potential, according to a report
last week by Sanford C. Bernstein & Co.  To contact the reporter on this story:
