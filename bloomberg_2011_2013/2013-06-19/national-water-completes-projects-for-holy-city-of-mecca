National Water Co. completed 840
million riyals ($224 million) of waterworks around Mecca to help
accommodate more pilgrims that visit the holy city.  The projects inaugurated on June 17 are mainly east of
Mecca and include 584 kilometers (364 miles) of sanitation
infrastructure works and pumping stations, according to the
Saudi utilityâ€™s chief executive officer, Loay al-Musallam.  The water network expansion and infrastructure projects
will improve conditions for the religious pilgrims that travel
to Mecca throughout the year, project head Abdullah al-Hagbani
said.  More than 10 million people visit the Grand Mosque in Mecca
every year and about 3 million attend the annual Hajj, a journey
each able-bodied Muslim is obliged to make. The holy city is
undergoing large-scale expansion around the mosque, with 10
hotel towers due to open this year alone.  To contact the reporter on this story:
