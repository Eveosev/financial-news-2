Commerzbank AG (CBK) , Germany’s second-largest lender, said it plans to eliminate about 5,200 jobs by
2016 to bolster profit.  The company’s works council approved the elimination of
3,900 positions, Frankfurt-based Commerzbank said today in an e-mailed statement. That comes on top of 500 job losses planned at
German and non-German subsidiaries and 800 mostly at a unit
that’s selling assets to raise capital and meet requirements for
state aid the bank took in 2008, according to the statement.  Banks are reducing headcount to buoy earnings after the
financial crisis and its aftermath lowered demand for their
products and stricter  capital requirements  made some businesses
unprofitable. Western European financial firms have unveiled
almost 60,000 job cuts so far this year after about 55,000 in
2012, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Commerzbank first
announced a plan to eliminate 4,000 to 6,000 positions in
January.  “We have found a way to achieve considerable cost
reductions, on the one hand, while securing our competitiveness
and earnings power through investment, on the other,” Ulrich Sieber, the management board member responsible for human
resources, said in the statement. “It is our objective to
implement these job cuts without enforced redundancies.”  Commerzbank rose 0.2 percent to 7.55 euros in Frankfurt
trading, and has  declined  28 percent in the past 12 months.  Stemming Losses  The bank, which got an 18.2 billion-euro state bailout
during the financial crisis, completed its fifth capital
increase in four years last month to help repay the government.
The company is eliminating staff and winding down real estate
and shipping assets to try to revive profit after posting  net
losses  in the past two quarters.  Commerzbank employed 54,068 people, including 42,101 in
 Germany , at the end of March, according to its first-quarter
earnings statement.  About 1,800 of the 3,900 jobs approved for elimination are
located at Commerzbank’s retail bank, according to the
statement. The lender said it is also adding 1,000 positions to
reach its strategic goals.  To contact the reporter on this story:
