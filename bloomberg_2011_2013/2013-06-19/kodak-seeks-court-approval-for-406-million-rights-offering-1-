Eastman Kodak Co. (EKDKQ)  said creditors
agreed to invest as much as $406 million through a rights
offering, which will be used to fund distributions under a
revised Chapter 11 reorganization plan.  “Attracting this additional funding is a strong vote of
confidence in both Kodak’s plan of reorganization and in the
actions we have taken during our restructuring to create a solid
future for our company,” Kodak Chairman and Chief Executive
Officer Antonio Perez said yesterday in a statement.  The creditors, GSO Capital Partners, BlueMountain Capital,
George Karfunkel, United Equities Group and Contrarian Capital,
have agreed to backstop the rights offering of 34 million shares
of common stock for $11.94 a share, according to the statement.
The backstop commitment needs to be approved by the U.S.
bankruptcy judge in  Manhattan , Kodak said.  Proceeds of the offering will be used to pay Kodak’s
second-lien creditors, who won’t receive equity under the
revised reorganization plan, the company said. Kodak’s committee
of unsecured creditors is supporting the backstop commitment and
rights offering, according to the statement.  The case is In re Eastman Kodak Co., 12-10202,  U.S.
Bankruptcy Court , Southern District of  New York  (Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
