Russia will spend about 14 billion
rubles ($430 million) to close the Baikal pulp and paper mill in
southern Siberia after the United Nations called for its
shutdown on concern it pollutes water.  The funds include 3 billion rubles from the state budget to
address environmental damage caused by the plant on Lake Baikal,
Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev said yesterday at a meeting in
Irkutsk, according to the government’s  website .  Russia decided to close the mill in February after the UN
threatened to remove the lake’s World Heritage Site designation.
The debt-strapped plant, one of the biggest employers in the
area, was last year fined for discharging toxic effluent into
the lake, the world’s largest source of freshwater.  “It was not easy to make this decision because it’s always
a balance between environmental interests and the future of the
people who work at the industrial site,” Medvedev said.
“Nevertheless, the decision is made and we are preparing
measures to fulfill it.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
