Ayala Land  Inc. said it may sell
bonds due in 25 years, the longest maturity for any Philippine
corporate debt, as the nation’s largest builder seeks to raise
21 billion pesos ($486 million) to help fund expansion.  The bonds, to be sold through a general public offer, will
have tenors of seven, 10 and either 20 or 25 years, Ayala Land
said in a stock exchange filing today. President Antonino Aquino
said the proceeds will be used to partly finance the company’s
65.5 billion peso spending plan this year.  “The high liquidity in the domestic  capital market  looking
for good corporate paper should allow us to place these bonds at
attractive rates,” Aquino said in a mobile-phone message in
response to Bloomberg questions today.  Profit at the developer of  Manila ’s Makati business
district climbed to a record 9.04 billion pesos in 2012, helped
by a 6.8 percent expansion in the $225 billion economy, the
fastest pace of growth in two years. First-quarter net income
rose 30 percent to 2.76 billion pesos, the company said May 8.  Ayala Land expects to expand last year’s record profit as
the builder takes advantage of a housing shortage and develops
business districts outside the capital, Aquino said in a March
interview. The company in February announced plans to start 69
projects worth 129 billion pesos this year, while its Chief
Financial Officer Jaime Ysmael said at the time it will spend 20
billion pesos to boost its  land bank .  The bond sale comes about three weeks after a May 31
explosion at its Two Serendra residential development that
killed three people. Gas that may have been ignited by static
electricity, a light-bulb spark or other sources may have caused
the blast, Interior Secretary Mar Roxas said on June 7.  Market Outlook  “The bond sale will be well-received by the market because
Ayala Land has good credit standing,” Miguel Agarao, an analyst
at brokerage Wealth Securities Inc. in Manila, said by
telephone. “Even if property sales are impaired by the
explosion at Serendra, it won’t affect the company’s ability to
repay the bonds.”  Ayala Land raised 15 billion pesos of 5.625 percent seven-year notes and 6 percent 10-year debt in April last year,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The company’s 10
billion peso offering in January 2011 included 7.5 percent 15-year bonds, the longest maturity for a Philippine corporate
debt.  To contact the reporters on this story:
