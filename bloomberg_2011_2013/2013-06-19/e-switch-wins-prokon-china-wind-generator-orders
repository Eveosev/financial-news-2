The Switch Drive Systems Oy, a
Finnish supplier of generators, won more than 100 million euros
($134 million) of orders from German wind-farm operator Prokon
Group and customers in  China .  Prokon on June 17 agreed to buy 100 3-megawatt direct-drive
permanent magnet generators and full-power converters, The
Switch said in a statement. Combined with “significant” sales
in China, the Vantaa-based company said orders in June totaled
more than 100 million euros, creating a record backlog.  The orders may signal a revival in the wind-power market,
the company said. Global investment in the industry dropped 13
percent to $78.3 billion in 2012, partly as a result of falling
costs, according to Bloomberg New Energy Finance data.  “These orders show growing confidence again in wind power
in all parts of the world,” The Switch Chief Executive Officer
Jukka-Pekka Makinen said in the statement. It’s “a good sign
that  Europe  is regaining its belief in wind and other
renewables.”  Lisa Kettman-Kervinen, a spokeswoman for The Switch,
declined to name the Chinese customers or state the value of the
Prokon order alone, citing client confidentiality.  To contact the reporter on this story:
