Kenya  will receive $155 million in
financing from the World Bank for water and irrigation aid,
including a project on the Lower Nzoia River west of Nairobi to
help address water-supply and food-security concerns.  The Washington-based lender said credit from its
International Development Association unit backs Kenya’s efforts
to improve water infrastructure, boost water-storage and
capacity and assist farmers with crop irrigation.  The financing “will help move forward Kenya’s plans to
manage its water resources and develop a pipeline of water
investments that will help improve the country’s water security
and climate resiliency,” Diarietou Gaye, World Bank country
director for Kenya, said in a statement. “Kenya is a water-scarce nation with over 80 percent of its land considered to be
arid or semi-arid.”  Kenya is “highly vulnerable to erratic climatic patterns
and limited water availability,” Jamal Saghir,  World Bank 
sustainable development director with the Africa region, said in
the statement yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
