The proposed merger between  US
Airways Group Inc. (LCC)  and  AMR Corp. (AAMRQ) â€™s American Airlines would
reduce competition on 11.9 percent of U.S. air routes, a
government review found.  The number of cities that would lose a carrier after the
merger is 47 percent higher than in the 2010 combination that
created United Continental Holdings Inc., Gerald Dillingham, who
heads transportation issues at the U.S. Government
Accountability Office, said in a statement for a Senate hearing
today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
