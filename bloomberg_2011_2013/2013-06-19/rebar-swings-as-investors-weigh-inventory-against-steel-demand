Steel reinforcement-bar futures in
 Shanghai  swung between gains and losses as investors weighed
bullish signs such as reduced inventory and lower output against
concern demand will wane.  Rebar for delivery in October on the Shanghai Futures
Exchange was little changed at 3,483  yuan  ($568) a metric ton at
10:05 a.m. after trading between 3,464 yuan and 3,494 yuan. The
contract touched 3,508 yuan on June 17, the highest since May 28.  Rebar output in May was estimated at 16.8 million tons as
average daily output declined 1 percent from a month earlier, Wu
Zhili, an analyst at Shenhua Futures Co., said in a report today.
 Rebar inventory  tracked by Shanghai Steelhome Information
Technology Co. fell to 7.79 million tons on June 14, the 10th
week of decline.  “Output is coming down a little while inventory is lower -
- both bullish for the rebar market,” Wu said. “But investors
are still worried about demand as the government may curb
investments in the property.”  Iron ore  prices for immediate delivery at Tianjin port in
 China  gained for the fourth day yesterday, by 2.4 percent to
$117.7 a dry ton, according to The Steel Index Ltd. The raw
material is a key ingredient for steel production.  The average spot price for rebar in China gained 0.3
percent to 3,387 yuan a ton yesterday, according to data from
Beijing Antaike Information Development Co.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
