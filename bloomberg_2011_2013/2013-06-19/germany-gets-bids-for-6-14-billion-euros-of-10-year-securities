Germany  got bids for 6.14 billion
euros ($8.22 billion) of 10-year bonds, compared with a 5
billion-euro target, the Bundesbank said in a statement.  The nation sold 4 billion euros of the debt at an average
yield of 1.55 percent, the central bank said. That compares with
a yield of 1.41 percent on May 22 and a record-low 1.28 percent
at a sale on April 17.  To contact the reporter on this story:
