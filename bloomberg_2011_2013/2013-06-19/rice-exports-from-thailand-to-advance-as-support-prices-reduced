Rice shipments from  Thailand , the
second-biggest exporter, are set to increase as the government
reduces the price paid to farmers to rein in spending, according
to the Thai Rice Exporters Association.  Sales may total 7 million metric tons this year and 8
million tons in 2014, said honorary president Chookiat Ophaswongse. His previous forecast was 6 million tons to 6.5
million tons for 2013. The National Rice Policy Committee
approved yesterday a 20 percent reduction to 12,000 baht ($388)
a ton from 15,000 baht in support prices for the unmilled white
variety, said Commerce Minister Boonsong Teriyapirom. The
decision needs final endorsement from the cabinet.  Thailand has paid farmers as much as 50 percent more than
domestic market rates since October 2011 to boost incomes. About
588.7 billion baht have been spent to buy 27 million tons of
milled rice, equivalent to 70 percent of annual global imports.
The program may have lost 136.9 billion baht in 2011-2012, the
government estimates. Moody’s Investors Service Inc. said on
June 3 that losses hamper the goal of achieving a balanced
budget by 2017 and are negative for sovereign ratings.  “The reduction in support will make Thai rice cheaper on
international markets, boost exports and put pressure on world
 prices ,” Chookiat said in a phone interview yesterday. “The
extent of the increase in shipments will depend on the reaction
from  Vietnam  and India, which could lower prices to compete with
Thailand.”  Price Declines  The price of Thailand’s 5 percent white rice dropped 8.9
percent this year to $532 a ton last week, according to data
from the exporters association. That’s the lowest since January
2012. The rate fell on speculation the support price would be
cut and on increased supply from India and Vietnam. Prices in
 Asia  are declining as wheat, corn and soybeans enter bear
markets, curbing global  food costs .  Rice of the same grade was quoted at $445 a ton from  India 
and at $370 from Vietnam, data from the association show.  The cut in support prices announced yesterday will probably
take effect from July 1 for the second harvest of the year which
ends in September, according to Boonsong. Purchases will be
limited to 500,000 baht per family, he said. For rates in
2013-2014, the National Rice Policy Committee will consider
prices in the range of 12,000 baht to 13,000 baht, he said.  The committee may set the support rate for 2013-2014 in one
of three ways, according to a government statement. It could
reduce the price by 15 percent to 20 percent, use the farm
ministry’s assessment of production costs plus 25 percent, or
use market prices with a 10 percent premium, it said. The
committee will finalize the proposal by the end of this month,
Boonsong said.  Fiscal Discipline  “The revision is not because the government doesn’t have
enough money,” Boonsong told reporters yesterday, saying no
date had been set for the cabinet approval. “We want to be
responsible for fiscal discipline and the program shouldn’t
carry losses of more than 100 billion baht a year,” he said.  Thailand has been selling rice from inventories to domestic
users and importers including  China  and  Ivory Coast . The country
sold 76 billion baht of stockpiled rice from October 2011
through March and sales will rise to 149 billion baht by
September, according to the government.  Inventories in Thailand will probably increase to a record
15.2 million tons in 2014, from 12.1 million tons this year,
according to the  U.S. Department of Agriculture .  To contact the reporters on this story:
