France , Europe’s largest energy
market after Germany, may weaken the security of its natural-gas
supply as it ties regulated tariffs more closely to spot prices,
the industry regulator said.  The share of supply indexed to the  spot market  will rise to
45 percent from 36 percent, Philippe de Ladoucette, head of the
Commission de Regulation de l’Energie, told a parliamentary
hearing today.  “This level is relatively high and if it goes any higher
we will have to ask questions about our security of supply,” he
said. “There could be a problem.”  GDF Suez SA (GSZ) , France’s biggest gas utility, has
traditionally acquired the fuel through long-term contracts with
companies such as OAO Gazprom, ensuring deliveries continue to
flow even when a Europe-wide cold snap depletes supply. With a
shift toward lower, spot rates, that security is diminished.  The method of calculating France’s regulated gas tariffs
has changed in recent years, in part to reflect the greater
emphasis on spot markets. The government has also urged GDF Suez
to renegotiate its contracts to keep energy costs as low as
possible for consumers.  Regulated prices have caused friction between GDF Suez, the
government and smaller suppliers seeking to compete. The failure
of successive administrations to allow prices to reflect costs
has led to losses for GDF and difficulties for new entrants.  To contact the reporter on this story:
