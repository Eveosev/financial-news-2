Japanese  shares  advanced, with the
Topix index climbing for a fourth day, amid lower volume before
the conclusion of a U.S. Federal Reserve meeting. Stocks rose as
Japan’s exports increased the most in three years.  Shippers jumped, with Kawasaki Kisen Kaisha Ltd. surging
9.5 percent. SoftBank Corp. climbed 4.2 percent after rival
bidder Dish Network Corp. said it won’t make a new offer for
Sprint Nextel Corp. Astellas Pharma Inc. added 4.3 percent on a
report the drugmaker plans to sell its dermatology assets.  Tokyo 
Electric Power Co. led declines on the Nikkei 225 Stock Average
after finding unsafe levels of radioactivity in groundwater at
its crippled Fukushima Dai-Ichi nuclear plant.  The  Topix (TPX)  gained 1.9 percent to 1,106.57 at the close of
trading in Tokyo, with volume about 37 percent below the 30-day
average. The Nikkei 225 rose 1.8 percent to 13,245.22.  “As there was market turmoil on concern about tapering in
the U.S., I think the Fed is going to try to bring some calm,”
said  Hiroichi Nishi , an equities manager in Tokyo at SMBC Nikko
Securities Inc., a unit of Japan’s second-biggest lender. “If
there is renewed energy in the market, stocks should be able to
rise above any selling pressure from investors waiting to take
profit during market gains.”  About $2 trillion has been wiped from global markets since
May 22, when Fed Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  signaled the central
bank’s asset-buying program could be scaled back if the
employment outlook shows “sustainable improvement.” Investors
are now awaiting his comments after the meeting ends today.  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index climbed 0.1
percent. The measure rose 0.8 percent yesterday in  New York . The
Fed’s easing program has helped drive a 16 percent advance in
the  S&P 500  this year. The gauge has soared 144 percent from its
bear-market low in 2009.  Exports Surprise  Data today showed Japanese exports rose 10 percent in May
from a year earlier, the most since 2010, beating the median
estimate of a 6.4 percent increase. The  trade deficit  stood at
994 billion yen ($10.4 billion), narrower than the 1.2 trillion
yen estimate of 31 economists surveyed by  Bloomberg News .  The Topix has swung an average of about 3.3 percent daily
since May 22. The gauge’s 30-day  historic volatility  was at
41.91 today, its highest closing level since the 2011 earthquake
and tsunami. The Nikkei Stock Average Volatility Index, which is
calculated using options prices, climbed 1.7 percent to 38.99,
indicating traders expect a swing of about 11 percent for the
measure in the next 30 days.  Trading volume on the Topix was 37 percent below the 30-day
average today, with 2.81 billion shares changing hands. This
compares with a high of 7.65 billion shares on May 23, when the
gauge plunged 6.9 percent.  Yen Holds  The yen was little changed at 95.21 per dollar as of 3:25
p.m. in Tokyo, after weakening the previous two days.  Japan ’s
currency dropped as much as 19 percent against the dollar this
year through May 17. While climbing since then, it has still
declined about 10 percent for the year.  The Topix has fallen about 13 percent from an almost five-year high on May 22. Shares have declined amid a strengthening
yen, disappointment about Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s growth
strategy and concern global stimulus will be reduced.  Investors are increasingly concerned Abenomics will fail,
according to a Bank of America Corp. survey of 190 global fund
managers in June. A net 17 percent of them are overweight
Japanese shares, compared with a seven-year high of a net 31
percent in May. It’s the first decline in eight months.  Even after the recent fall, the  Nikkei 225  and Topix are
still up more than 27 percent this year, retaining Japan’s
position as the best-performing major equity market.  Topix Rise  The Topix may rise to 1,300 by the end of the year,
according to the median estimate of 17 strategists surveyed by
Bloomberg. The Nikkei 225 may climb to 14,500 in the same
period, according to a separate survey.  Earnings for Topix companies will jump 53 percent this
fiscal year to 78.85 yen a share, according to analyst  estimates 
compiled by Bloomberg.  Among stocks that rose, the Topix gauge tracking shippers
climbed 4.7 percent. A.P. Moeller-Maersk A/S, the world’s
largest container line, said it will pool vessels with its two
biggest competitors to manage overcapacity and raise
unprofitable freight rates.  The alliance will help to stabilize container rates and is
positive for Japan’s biggest shipping lines -- Kawasaki Kisen,
Nippon Yusen KK and Mitsui O.S.K. Lines Ltd. -- according to a
report today by Mizuho Securities Co. analyst Satoru Kunieda.  Shipping shares also jumped as the Baltic Dry Index, a
measure of cargo rates, climbed to its highest this year. The
gauge has risen in each of the past nine sessions.  SoftBank Advances  SoftBank jumped 4.2 percent to 5,460 yen, the second-biggest support for the Topix. Dish’s decision not to make a new
offer for Sprint smooths SoftBank’s path to acquiring the
wireless company. Still, Dish will consider other options, the
Englewood, Colorado-based company said in a statement.  Astellas gained 4.3 percent to 5,050 yen after Reuters
reported Japan’s second-largest drugmaker by market value may
sell dermatology assets valued at $500 million to $1 billion.  Among stocks that fell, Tokyo Electric, the utility also
known as Tepco, slumped 3.9 percent to 517 yen, the biggest drop
on the Nikkei 225. The stock was the second-most actively traded
on the Tokyo Stock Exchange first section today.  Tepco detected tritium levels of 500,000 becquerels per
liter and strontium levels of 1,000 becquerels per liter at a
monitoring well in its turbine complex at the crippled Fukushima
Dai-Ichi nuclear power station, it said in a statement. Japan’s
nuclear safety guidelines require tritium levels at nuclear
plants to remain below 60,000 becquerels per liter and strontium
levels to be below 30 becquerels per liter.  To contact the reporters on this story:
