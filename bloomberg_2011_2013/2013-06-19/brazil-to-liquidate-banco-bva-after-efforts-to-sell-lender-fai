Banco BVA SA, the lender controlled
by  Brazil ’s central bank since Oct. 19, will be liquidated after
efforts to find a buyer failed.  The bank, with seven branches, accounts for about 0.17
percent of assets in Brazil’s financial system and 0.24 percent
of deposits, the central bank said yesterday in a  statement .
Investors own about $45 million of international bonds issued by
the Rio de Janeiro-based lender that would have matured in
February 2014, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The central bank is investigating who’s responsible for
BVA’s collapse and the findings “could lead to punitive
measures,” according to the statement.  BVA, which specializes in loans to mid-size companies, is
the seventh bank in Brazil to be seized or bailed out since
2010. The nation’s privately owned deposit-insurance fund, Fundo
Garantidor de Creditos, has paid more than 1.2 billion reais
($539 million) to some of BVA’s local bondholders and depositors
since October.  To contact the reporter on this story:
