Activ Solar GmbH , the largest solar
developer in Ukraine, is seeking to tap Islamic financing to
expand into renewable energy markets in the Middle East.  Solar plants’ predictable and steady revenue streams could
be a good fit for the growing Islamic financing market, Activ
Chief Executive Officer Kaveh Ertefai said today in Munich.  In Saudi Arabia, Activ is in the process of setting up a
venture with a local company that has the “ability to support
execution” of solar parks, Ertefai said in an interview on the
sidelines of a solar conference in the German city. The
developer is also looking at markets including Qatar, Jordan and
the United Arab Emirates for growth, he said.  Activ Solar, based in Vienna, has developed the most solar
parks operating in Ukraine, taking advantage of the region’s
highest subsidies. It has built projects with a combined 450
megawatts, of which 150 megawatts were completed this year,
Ertefai said. Activ expects the Ukrainian market to grow “at
least” at the rate of previous years even as financing remains
challenging, he said.  The developer last year invested in a “triple-digit-megawatt” project pipeline in the U.S. and is “actively
looking to expand on that” as it expects the U.S. market to
show “healthy” growth in the short to long-term, Ertefai said.
Activ is also starting to look at projects in  Mexico , he said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
