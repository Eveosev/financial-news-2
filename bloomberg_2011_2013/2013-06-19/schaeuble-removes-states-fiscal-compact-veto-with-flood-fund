German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble overcame resistance in the opposition-controlled upper
house of parliament to legislation limiting the budget deficit
by offering states favorable flood-aid terms.  The federal government will sell as much as 8 billion euros
($10.7 billion) of bonds to establish the recovery fund, with
states repaying their share of about 3.25 billion euros over 20
years, the ministry said today in an e-mailed statement.  “I am delighted that we’ve been able to find a convincing
solution today,” Schaeuble said in the statement. It is
“positive” that the states agreed to approve the fiscal
compact as it “finalizes a major German concern.”  The blocking of the legislation anchoring the fiscal
compact in German law was an embarrassment for  Chancellor Angela Merkel , who pushed for the stricter budget rules at European
level, winning agreement from 25 of the European Union’s 27
members in late 2011.  Schaeuble also agreed that the federal government will bear
1.5 billion euros in costs for rebuilding destroyed federal
infrastructure without asking for state contributions. He agreed
in addition to maintain payments to the states related to the
unbundling of federal-state responsibilities at current levels
until 2019, giving up a previous demand to reduce them.  Swollen rivers including the Elbe and Danube forced tens of
thousands of German residents to leave their homes, causing
about 12 billion euros in damage,  according to  Fitch Ratings.
 Allianz SE (ALV) , Europe’s biggest insurer, said preliminary estimates
show its net losses from the flood claims in  Germany ,  Austria 
and part of Central Europe are 350 million euros.  To contact the reporter on this story:
