Sao Paulo and Rio de Janeiro revoked
increases to bus, train and subway fares that sparked the
biggest street protests in almost two decades.  The announcement was made in Sao Paulo in a joint press
conference by Geraldo Alckmin, governor of the state, and the
cityâ€™s mayor, Fernando Haddad, who said the decision will
restrict the ability to carry out planned investments. In Rio,
Mayor Eduardo Paes said the lower tariffs for buses will cost
the city 200 million reais ($89.9 million) a year.  The fares in Sao Paulo will return to 3 reais, the price
they were before an increase of 20 centavos went into effect
this month. The new prices go into effect June 24.  To contact the reporter on this story:
