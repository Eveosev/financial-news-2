A fund managed by Luxembourg-based
Althelia Climate Fund GP Sarl raised more than 60 million euros
($80 million) from investors to prevent forest loss.  The Althelia Climate Fund will invest in initiatives in
 Africa , Latin America and Asia that conserve forest and prevent
unsustainable land use, according to a statement on the fundâ€™s
website. Althelia plans to raise as much as 200 million euros in
the next year, the statement showed.  Deforestation caused by logging, agricultural expansion and
fires makes up almost one fifth of global greenhouse gas
emissions, according to the United Nations Reducing Emissions
from Deforestation and Forest Degradation program, or  REDD . The
program seeks to create financial value for carbon stored in
forests to encourage developing countries to curb forest-land
emissions. Preserving forest can also boost resilience to
climate change, according to REDD.  The fund will invest in commodities and agricultural
produce as well as emissions reductions created through forest
protection, according to the statement. Althelia won as much as
25 million euros from the European Investment Bank and received
contributions from the Finnish Fund for Industrial Cooperation
Ltd., a development finance company, among others, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
