Eurofighter Jagdflugzeug GmbH’s new
Chief Executive Officer Alberto Gutierrez said he’ll target
spending reductions to make the group’s Typhoon combat jet more
competitive at winning orders abroad.  “There will be hard facts and figures” in the review,
Gutierrez told reporters at the Paris Air Show. Decision making
needs to be streamlined, he said.  Eurofighter, a military-jet partnership of  European
Aeronautic, Defence & Space Co. (EAD) ,  BAE Systems Plc (BA/)  and
 Finmeccanica SpA (FNC) , has lost to U.S. and European rivals in
Indian, Japanese and Swiss orders in the past two years. The
venture, based in the Munich suburb of Hallbergmoos, is awaiting
the outcome of a 60-plane South Korean tender in which the
Typhoon is competing with  Lockheed Martin Corp. (LMT) ’s F-35 and
 Boeing Co. (BA)  F-15.  “We are engaged in several campaigns around the globe,”
Gutierrez, a former head of operations at air-transport
developer Airbus Military who was appointed to the Eurofighter
post on April 22. “We are focusing particularly on the Middle
East,” and “we have a lot of hope of winning some of those
contracts.”  Eurofighter has ambitions to sell the twin-engine jet to
the United Arab Emirates, Qatar and Kuwait. A further purchase
by  Saudi Arabia , already a buyer of 72 Typhoons, is possible,
Gutierrez said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
