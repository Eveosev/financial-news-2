Natural gas futures advanced to a
two-week high in  New York  on forecasts for hotter-than-normal
weather that would increase air conditioner use and boost demand
for the power-plant fuel.  Gas climbed 1.5 percent after MDA Weather Services in
Gaithersburg,  Maryland , predicted higher-than-average
temperatures across most of the lower 48 states from June 24
through July 3. The high in New York on June 28 may be 89
degrees Fahrenheit (32 Celsius), 7 more than usual, according to
 AccuWeather Inc.  in  State College ,  Pennsylvania .  “The forecasts are definitely looking hotter,” said
Victor Zevallos, an energy trader at FCStone Latin America LLC
in Miami. “We’re going to see some air conditioning demand
kicking in and that’s sending prices higher.”  Natural gas for July delivery rose 5.8 cents to settle at
$3.963 per million British thermal units on the  New York
Mercantile Exchange . Prices have climbed 18 percent this year.
Trading was 31 percent below the 100-day average at 2:45 p.m.  The discount of July to October futures narrowed 0.4 cent
to 2.5 cents.  July $4 calls were the most active options in electronic
trading. They were 0.8 cent higher at 3.6 cents per million Btu
on volume of 2,007 at 2:56 p.m. Calls accounted for 51 percent
of trading volume. Implied volatility for at-the-money options
expiring in August was 29.56 percent at 2:45 p.m., compared with
29.9 percent yesterday.  Chicago Heat  The high in  Chicago  on June 27 may be 93 degrees
Fahrenheit, 10 more than average, AccuWeather said. Power
generation accounts for 32 percent of U.S. gas demand, according
to the Energy Information Administration, the Energy
Department’s statistical arm.  “Whether or not the potential cooling-related natural gas
demand will be significant enough to have a strong impact on the
weekly inventory injections is the big question,” Dominick Chirichella, senior partner at the Energy Management Institute
in New York, said in a note to clients today.  A report due tomorrow from the Energy Department’s Energy
Information Administration may show that gas stockpiles rose 88
billion cubic feet in the seven days ended June 14, according to
the median of 21 analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg. The
five-year average change is an increase of 80 billion for the
period. Supplies climbed 63 billion in the same week last year.  Gas Supplies  Inventories of the fuel totaled 2.347 trillion cubic feet
in the week ended June 7, 2.4 percent below the five-year
average and 20 percent less than a year earlier.  Gas  output  in the lower 48 states dropped 0.7 percent to
72.71 billion cubic feet a day in March from a month earlier,
the EIA said May 31 in its monthly EIA-914 production report.
 Louisiana  had the largest decrease at 4.5 percent as operators
reported shut-ins for maintenance.  The number of rigs drilling for gas fell by one to 353 last
week, data from Baker Hughes Inc. in Houston showed on June 14.
The total has dropped 18 percent this year.  Gas prices  at the benchmark  Henry Hub  in Erath, Louisiana,
will average $3.92 per million British thermal units in 2013, up
from $2.75 last year, the EIA said June 11 in its monthly Short-Term Energy Outlook.  To contact the reporter on this story:
