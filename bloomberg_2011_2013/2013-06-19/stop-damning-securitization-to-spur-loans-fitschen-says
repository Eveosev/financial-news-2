Banks should be allowed to repackage
assets such as loans and sell them on to investors to maintain
the flow of credit to the economy, said  Deutsche Bank AG (DBK)  co-Chief Executive Officer  Juergen Fitschen .  “We have to stop damning securitization,” Fitschen, who
spoke in his capacity as head of the BdB Association of German
Banks, told reporters at a briefing in Frankfurt yesterday. “We
need this instrument again to mobilize capital.”  European Central Bank President  Mario Draghi  said last
month that policy makers will consider ways to boost lending to
small and medium-sized companies using asset-backed securities.
The ECB is “right” to weigh that option and European companies
will have to rely more heavily on investors for their funding
needs in future, said Fitschen.  “We’re not going to get around sourcing a higher share of
credit supply from  capital markets  in several European
countries,” Fitschen said. “I’m not saying it’ll be at U.S.
levels, but we have to move in that direction or the danger of
banks not being able to supply the liquidity will be too high.”  Separately, Fitschen, 64, said European leaders must work
on setting up a joint deposit protection mechanism to maintain
stability in the euro area’s banking system. That process may
take several years as other countries need to catch up with some
of the safeguards German banks have in place, he said.  The BdB represents more than 210 commercial lenders in
 Germany  including Deutsche Bank, according to its website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
