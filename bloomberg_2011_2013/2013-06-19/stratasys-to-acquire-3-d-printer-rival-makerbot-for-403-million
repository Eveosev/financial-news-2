Stratasys Ltd. (SSYS) , a maker of printers
that can create three-dimensional objects, agreed to buy
MakerBot Industries LLC for at least $403 million, acquiring a
startup competitor in the nascent industry.  Stratasys will initially issue 4.76 million of its shares
in exchange for MakerBot, according to a  statement  yesterday.
That will be followed by performance-based payments that could
add $201 million to the purchase price, Stratasys said.  MakerBot, a  Brooklyn , New York-based company founded in
2009, has sold more than 22,000 of its 3-D printers -- devices
that are increasingly popular among engineers, designers and
manufacturers. The acquisition gives MakerBot a global channel
to sell them, while providing Stratasys with a fresh source of
growth and lower-priced models that can entice consumers.  “It’s really going to accelerate growth and increase
global adoption of 3-D printing,” MakerBot Chief Executive
Officer Bre Pettis said in an interview. “We’ve just had such a
massive amount of growth in the last four years and have really
brought this industry into the public spotlight. Now we get this
added resource, the deepest expertise in the industry.”  MakerBot will also update its printers with Stratasys
technology, Stratasys CEO David Reis said. MakerBot posted $11.5
million in revenue in the first quarter, compared with $15.7
million for all of 2012, according to the statement.  Desktop Printing  MakerBot’s line of desktop printers lets customers create
objects such as plastic supplies and models -- anything from a
bottle opener to a fly swatter -- in their homes or offices. The
company estimates that 35,000 to 40,000 3-D desktop printers
were sold in 2012, with that number doubling this year.  Stratasys, which focuses more on the professional market
for 3-D printing, was formed last year out of the merger of
Stratasys Inc. and Objet Ltd. Like MakerBot, it sells both the
printers and the plastic materials needed to create the objects.  Shares of Stratasys , which has dual headquarters in
Minneapolis and  Israel , fell 1.8 percent to $84.60 yesterday in
 New York  trading before the merger was announced. The stock has
climbed 5.6 percent this year.  Stratasys will keep MakerBot as a stand-alone company while
providing assistance in areas that can help accelerate its
growth, Reis said.  “It’s kind of pick and choose from the MakerBot side,
whatever they want to bring over,” Reis said. “We’re a much
larger company and we’re growing fast, but MakerBot is growing
even faster.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
