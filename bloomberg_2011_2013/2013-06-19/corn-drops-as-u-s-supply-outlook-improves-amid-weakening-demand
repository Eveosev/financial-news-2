Corn declined for the first time in
three days on a forecast for warmer weather in the Midwest,
aiding crop growth amid signs demand has weakened for supplies
from the U.S., the largest shipper. Soybeans and wheat fell.  The contract for delivery in December, after the U.S.
harvest, lost as much as 0.6 percent to $5.4725 a bushel on the
 Chicago  Board of Trade and was at $5.475 by 10:55 a.m. in
 Singapore . Futures gained 2.2 percent yesterday on concern that
cool and wet weather in parts of the U.S. may slow crop
development.  The Midwest, the largest growing region in the U.S., will
turn drier and warmer through the weekend, favoring development
of late planted crops, DTN said in a report yesterday. About
560.86 million bushels were inspected before shipment at U.S.
ports as of June 13, down 56 percent from a year earlier that
ended Aug. 31, the  U.S. Department of Agriculture  said June 17.  “The grain market is overvalued and out of line with the
fundamentals,” Makiko Tsugata, an analyst at Market Risk
Advisory Co. in  Tokyo , wrote in an e-mail today, referring to
declining U.S. exports. “This summer’s weather in the corn belt
area is expected to be good for growth.”  Soybeans for delivery in November, after the U.S. harvest,
slipped 0.2 percent to $12.8675 a bushel in Chicago, while wheat
for September delivery lost 0.6 percent to $6.905 a bushel.  To contact the reporter on this story:
