International investors sold South
Korean stocks for the ninth day, the longest losing streak in
two months, helping drag the benchmark  Kospi (KOSPI)  index down the most
in a week.  Foreigners sold a net 153 billion won ($135 million) of
Kospi stocks as of 12:06 p.m. in Seoul trading, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. Nine consecutive days of outflows
would be the longest streak since the nine days to April 24.  The Kospi sank 0.7 percent to 1,888.03 today, with  Samsung
Electronics Co. (005930)  accounting for more than 30 percent of the drop.
The stock, which represents 19 percent of the Kospi, has slumped
11 percent since June 4 as brokerages including Morgan Stanley
cut earnings forecasts amid concerns over handset sales.  “Today’s downturn in the South Korean market is most
likely coming from the sell-off by international investors, with
the massive selling of Samsung stocks ever since those reports
were released,” said Im Jeong Jae, a Seoul-based  fund manager 
at Shinhan BNP Paribas Asset Management Co., which oversees
about $28 billion, said by phone today.  Korea Exchange is closely watching stock and derivative
movements amid the slump in Samsung, officials at the bourse
operator said on June 12.  Samsung shares are valued at 6.2 times 12-month projected
profit, compared with the Kospi’s 8.7 times, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. The MSCI  Emerging Markets  Index trades at
a multiple of 9.8.  To contact the reporter on this story:
