Yahoo Japan Corp. (4689) , operator of the
country’s most-visited Web portal, expects economic growth and a
consumer shift to mobile services to spur revenue gains as it
targets advertising growth of at least 10 percent.  “We expect to continue the growth pace a while,” Chief
Financial Officer Toshiki Ohya said in an interview in Tokyo.
Advertising, which account for more than half the company’s
sales, rose 15 percent to 190.5 billion yen ($2 billion) in the
year ended March.  Yahoo  Japan , 42 percent owned by billionaire Masayoshi Son’s  SoftBank Corp. (9984) , is targeting a 77 percent increase in
earnings within six years by expanding in e-commerce and
offering more services for smartphones and tablet computers.
Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s strategy to end deflation, nicknamed
Abenomics, may stoke earnings for the web portal as advertisers
boost their spending to tap economic growth.  “We expect advertising to lead us in the next two to three
years, while it may take a while to double our e-commerce
business,” Ohya, 43, said in the June 18 interview. The company
needs to add more products and improve e-commerce services to
compete against Amazon.com Inc. and  Rakuten Inc. (4755) , he said.  Yahoo Japan rose 1.3 percent to 48,000 yen in Tokyo trading
yesterday, extending this year’s gain to 72 percent. That is
more than double the 29 percent rise in the benchmark Topix
index. The company is 35 percent owned by  Yahoo! Inc. (YHOO) , the
Sunnyvale, California-based operator of the U.S. portal.  Japan’s economy grew an annualized 4.1 percent in the first
quarter, the Cabinet Office said in Tokyo June 10.  Mobile Devices  The shift in consumer use of smartphones and tablets will
see the use of mobile devices to access Yahoo Japan’s services
overtake that of personal computers within two years, Ohya said.  The company almost tripled advertising sales from
smartphones to 8.5 billion yen in the three months ended March
31 from 3 billion yen a year earlier, it said.  Yahoo Japan has been adding customers who pay 399 yen a
month for services such as access to books and coupons, helped
by SoftBank promotions to new customers at its outlets. Yahoo
Japan had 9.19 million subscribers, as of March 31, it said.  Net income jumped 14 percent to 115 billion yen in the 12
months ended March, the fastest annual growth in 4 years, it
said in April. The company, which has posted 16 straight years
of profit growth,  forecast  net income to rise 9 percent to 56.9
billion yen in the first half of this financial year while sales
may jump 15 percent to 180 billion yen.  Increased Acquisitions  Yahoo Japan, which had operating profit of 186 billion yen
last year, is targeting earnings of 330 billion yen in the 12
months ending March 2019, it said.  Since Ohya became CFO in April 2012, as part of Yahoo’s
first major management revamp since 1996, the company has made
at least seven  purchases  worth more than $663 million, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg, compared with none in all of
2011.  The largest deal was the $410 million purchase of a 42
percent stake in  Askul Corp. (2678)  followed by the acquisition of
 CyberAgent Inc. (4751) ’s foreign-exchange unit for $253 million.  “We have embarked on various projects, so now we want to
cast them into shape,” Ohya said.  Ohya led Yahoo Japan to set up a 1 billion yen fund to
invest in startups in September, which was then expanded to 3
billion yen in February, the company said. Among its investments
are Geniee Inc., a developer of advertising technology, and
RareJob Inc., an online English conversation school operator.  “Some companies tap our fund, hoping to find common ground
with us in business,” Ohya said. The size of investment in each
company is between 50 million yen 100 million yen, he said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
