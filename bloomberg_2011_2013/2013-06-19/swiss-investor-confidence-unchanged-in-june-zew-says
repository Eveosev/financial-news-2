Swiss  investor confidence  was
unchanged in June, signaling the economy may struggle to gain
momentum amid a recession in the neighboring euro area.  An index of investor and analyst expectations, which aims
to predict economic developments six months in advance, stayed
at 2.2 in June, matching the lowest level since January, the ZEW
Center for European Economic Research in  Mannheim , Germany, and
Zurich-based  Credit Suisse Group AG (CSGN)  said in a statement today.  The  Swiss National Bank , which expects the country’s
economy to grow as much as 1.5 percent this year, will update
that forecast tomorrow at its quarterly policy review.  To shield the economy from the turmoil in the 17-nation
currency bloc, its biggest trading partner, the SNB has a limit
of 1.20 per euro on the franc to lessen the risk of deflation
and recession. The euro-area economy has contracted the past six
quarters, its longest recession on record.  The Swiss survey of 46 analysts was conducted between June
3 and 17.  German investor confidence rose in June, climbing to 38.5
from 36.4 in May, ZEW said yesterday.  Germany  is Switzerland’s
largest export market.  To contact the reporter on this story:
