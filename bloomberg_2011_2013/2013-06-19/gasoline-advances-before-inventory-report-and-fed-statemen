Gasoline pared gains after a report
that U.S.  refiners processed  the most crude in six months,
implying production of the motor fuel will increase. Crack
spreads widened.  Futures narrowed gains to 0.2 percent from 0.7 percent
after the Energy Information Administration said refinery crude
inputs climbed 1.9 percent to 15.5 million barrels a day, the
most since Dec. 14. Supplies rose 183,000 barrels to 221.7
million, a nine-week high. Total  inventories  of crude and

at Jefferies Bache LLC in  New York .  July-delivery gasoline rose 0.7 cent to $2.8864 a gallon at
12:34 p.m. on the  New York Mercantile Exchange . Trading volume

August Brent increased 25 cents to $14.80.  Inventories in PADD 1, which includes New York Harbor,
delivery point for the Nymex contract, slid 1.51 million barrels
to 62.3 million. That’s still the highest level for this time of
year since 2002. Imports fell 27 percent to 485,000 barrels a
day, the least since the week ended March 15.  Above-Average  “Despite the draw, gasoline stocks in the all-important
East Coast remain 8 million barrels higher than last year’s
levels and some 5.8 million barrels higher relative to the five-year average,” said Amrita Sen, chief oil market strategist at
Energy Aspects Ltd., a research company in  London .  Supplies in PADD 2, which includes  Chicago , rose a fourth
straight week to a seven-week high. Inventories of the motor

U.S. operable refining capacity, fell 10,000 barrels to 75.5
million.  Demand, measured as wholesale deliveries, rose 2.2 percent
to 8.84 million barrels a day. Demand over the past four weeks

to release a policy statement and economic forecast at 2 p.m.
Fed Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  is scheduled to hold a press
conference at 2:30 p.m. Investors are looking for indications
the central bank will scale back, or taper, its purchases of
Treasuries as the  U.S. economy  extends its recovery.  Fed Statement  “The market is waiting to hear what Bernanke has to say
and whether there is any change in tone or indications whether
they will reduce bond purchases,” said  Andy Lipow , president of
Lipow Oil Associates LLC in Houston.  Gasoline at the  pump , averaged nationwide, fell 0.4 cent to
