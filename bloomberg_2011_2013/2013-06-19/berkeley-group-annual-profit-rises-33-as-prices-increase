Berkeley Group Holdings Plc (BKG) , the
U.K. homebuilder focused on  London  and southeast England, said
annual profit rose 33 percent after it sold more homes at higher
prices. The shares rose as much as 5.1 percent.  Net income increased to 209.7 million pounds ($328 million)
in the 12 months through April from 158.1 million pounds a year
earlier, the Cobham, England-based company said in a statement
today. Analysts expected net income of 209 million pounds, the
average of three estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  “The London market has been performing stronger than the
rest of the market,” Rob Perrins, group managing director of
Berkeley, said in an interview. “It hasn’t had the constraints
on mortgages and deposits that outside London has had.”  Berkeley’s board declared a further interim dividend of 59
pence per share payable in September, and the company said its
plan to return 1.7 billion pounds to shareholders over a 10-year
period remains on track. Berkeley  rose  as much as 5.1 percent,
the most since Dec. 7, and closed up 1.6 percent in London
trading at 2193 pence.  Prime Minister  David Cameron  is using homebuilding to help
stimulate the economy, with the government in March announcing
the Help to Buy equity-loan program to aid home buyers. The Bank
of England’s Funding for Lending Scheme has also eased home
lending by lowering bank-funding costs.  ‘Feel Good’  “The Help to Buy initiative will help bring back the feel
good factor outside of London,” Perrins said by telephone.  Berkeley has been acquiring land in southeast England,
where the housing market escaped the worst effects of the global
recession in 2008 and mortgage lending has been less
constrained. U.K. home sellers raised asking prices 1.2 percent
in June to an average 252,798 pounds, property-website operator
Rightmove Plc said in a report this week. The biggest increases
in the year so far were in the southeast, where asking prices
have risen 14.8 percent.  Berkeley in March said it had acquired three sites in
southeast  England  since November to gain from a shortage of
supply. The purchase of sites in the London neighborhoods of
Finchley and Mill Hill and in the town of Maidenhead will help
achieve Berkeley’s target of increasing its land by 10 percent
in fiscal 2013, the company said in a March 18 statement.  Berkeley sold 3,712 new homes during the year, up from
3,565 a year earlier, according to the statement. The average
selling price increased 26 percent to 354,000 pounds. Revenue
increased 32 percent to 1.37 billion pounds.  To contact the reporter on this story:
