Gold declined to the lowest in four
weeks after the Federal Reserve Chairman Ben S. Bernanke said
the central bank may “moderate” the pace of U.S. bond
purchases later this year.  “If the subsequent data remain broadly aligned with our
current expectations for the economy, we will continue to reduce
the pace of purchases in measured steps through the first half
of next year, ending purchases around mid-year,” Bernanke said
at a press conference after the conclusion of a two-day meeting
of the Federal Open Market Committee. The Fed currently buys $85
billion in Treasury and mortgage debt each month.  “Inflation remains at a low pace and the easing may end,
so there are no real solid reasons to back gold,” Edward Lashinski, the Chicago-based director of global strategy for
futures trading at RBC Capital Markets LLC, said in a telephone
interview. The Fed’s plan to scale back asset purchases “is
making gold investors nervous,” he said.  Gold futures for August delivery fell 1.2 percent to
$1,350.20 an ounce in electronic trading at 4:30 p.m. on the
Comex in New York. Earlier, the price touched $1,348.30, the
lowest for a most-active contract since May 20. The metal
settled up 0.5 percent at $1,374 at 1:44 p.m.  The dollar jumped as much as 1.1 percent against a basket
of major currencies.  Gold slumped 18 percent this year through today’s
settlement, following 12 straight annual gains. Some investors
lost faith in the commodity as a store of value amid a recovery
in the U.S. economy, a rally in equities and low inflation. On
April 12, gold entered a bear market, and in the following
session, the price plunged 9.3 percent, the most in 33 years.  Equity Rally  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index of  equities  rose to a
record on May 22. Through yesterday, the gauge climbed 16
percent this year. This month, U.S. data showed the inflation
rate was the lowest in at least five decades.  Holdings in the SPDR Gold Fund, the world’s biggest
exchange-traded product backed by the metal, have tumbled 26
percent this year to the lowest since February 2009.  The slump has erased $29 billion from the  value  of the
fund. Global ETP holdings in the metal have declined 20 percent
this year.  Gold jumped 55 percent since the end of 2008, reaching an
all-time high of $1,923.70 in September 2011, as the Fed cut
borrowing costs to a record to bolster the economy.  The benchmark  10-year yield  on Treasuries reached 2.29
percent on June 11, the highest in 14 months, Bloomberg Bond
Trader prices show. In July, the yield was as low as 1.38
percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
