A $21 billion  BlackRock Inc. (BLK) 
 exchange-traded fund  that owns investment-grade corporate bonds
plunged the most in almost two years after the  Federal Reserve 
signaled it may slow unprecedented stimulus supporting the
market.  The iShares iBoxx Investment Grade Corporate  Bond ETF (LQD) 
dropped 1.4 percent to $114.72, the biggest decline since August
2011. Investors have redeemed about $3.4 billion of the fund’s
shares this year, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  The central bank may “moderate” the pace of its buying
later this year and end the purchases around the middle of 2014
if data on economic growth is “broadly consistent” with its
forecast, Fed Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said at a news conference
today. Fed policy makers said in a statement today that risks to
the economy have decreased.  Investors are cooling enthusiasm for the highest-rated debt
as they prepare for a pullback from stimulus efforts that have
pumped more than $2.5 trillion into the financial system since
2008. Yields on 10-year U.S. Treasuries, a benchmark for
corporate debt, climbed 17 basis points to 2.35 percent as of
4:45 p.m. in New York, the highest level since March 2012.  ETFs, with shares that trade like stocks, allow investors
from retirees to hedge funds to slip in and out of the bond
market quicker than investments in the actual debt, which
typically trades off exchanges in privately negotiated
transactions.  Since BlackRock’s fund was created as the first fixed-income ETF in 2002, the U.S. debt funds have amassed $249.3
billion of assets, according to data from  State Street Corp. (STT)   To contact the reporter on this story:
