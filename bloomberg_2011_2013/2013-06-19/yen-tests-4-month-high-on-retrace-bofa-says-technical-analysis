The yen may climb to its strongest
level in almost four months versus the dollar as it retraces a
decline that saw it reach a 4 1/2-year low, according to Bank of
America Corp.  The yen will stay bullish as it passes through the area
from 93.65 to 93.15 before strengthening to 90.91, according to
 MacNeil Curry , chief rates and currencies technical strategist
in  New York  at Bank of America Merrill Lynch. That would be the
yen’s highest level since reaching a monthly peak of 90.88 on
Feb. 25.  “Bigger picture, we are in a multi-month 91-to-104 area
range trade,” Curry wrote today in a note to clients. The
Japanese currency slid as far as 103.74 on May 22, its weakest
level since October 2008.  The yen increased 0.3 percent to 95.01 per dollar at 10:39
a.m. in New York.  Curry made a bullish yen trade recommendation on June 14,
suggesting that traders sell the dollar against the yen with a
target of 91. Bank of American forecasts that  Japan ’s currency
will decline to 105 by year-end.  In  technical analysis , investors and analysts study charts
