CCX Carvao da Colombia SA (CCXC3) , the
smallest of  Eike Batista ’s publicly traded companies, slumped to
a record low after the billionaire canceled plans to take the
coal business private.  CCX  dropped  47 percent to 68 centavos at 11:56 a.m. in Sao
Paulo, the lowest since it began trading in May 2012. The stock,
which traded at more than 10 times its three-month daily average
volume, has declined 83 percent this month compared with a 14
percent fall in the Ibovespa small cap  index .  Batista, who last year lost the title of Brazil’s richest
person, in January offered as much as 4.31 reais a share for Rio
de Janeiro-based CCX, payable in stock of other public companies
he controls.  Brazil ’s stock market “doesn’t represent an ideal
environment to sustain the current terms” of his offer, Batista
said in a statement late yesterday. He said he may reassess the
deal if market conditions improve.  Batista, whose net wealth dropped 59 percent this year, is
selling assets, restructuring debt at his holding company EBX
Group Co. and trimming projects as his six publicly traded units
accumulate losses. OGX Petroleo & Gas Participacoes SA, the
billionaire’s oil-producing company,  fell  2.6 percent today to
76 centavos, extending its decline in the past year to 92
percent.  LLX Logistica SA (LLXL3) , Batista’s port-developer unit,  dropped  as
much as 12 percent today and was the second-worst performer on
Brazil’s benchmark Ibovespa index, which declined 2.4 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
