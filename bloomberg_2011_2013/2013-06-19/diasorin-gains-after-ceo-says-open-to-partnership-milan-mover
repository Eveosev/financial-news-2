DiaSorin SpA (DIA)  rose to the highest in
almost two years after Chief Executive Officer Carlo Rosa said
in an interview the Italian supplier of diagnostic tests is open
to a strategic partnership with a major competitor.  The  shares  gained as much as 2.8 percent to 31.49 euros,
the highest intraday price since August 2011, and were up 63
cents to 31.27 euros as of 11:48 a.m. in Milan. That boosted the
market value of the company, based in Saluggia,  Italy , to 1.75
billion euros ($2.34 billion).  Major diagnostic tests producers are seeking to add
specialty exams to boost their offerings amid consolidation of
labs, Rosa said. The company gets 74 percent of its  revenue  from
specialty tests based on Chemi Luminescent Immuno Assay, or
CLIA, including Vitamin D tests. DiaSorinâ€™s bigger  rivals 
include Siemens AG, Abbott Laboratories and Roche Holding AG.  The CEO also repeated 2013 financial forecasts. DiaSorin
expects revenue to rise between 2 percent and 4 percent at
constant exchange rates, and earnings before interest, tax,
depreciation and amortization on that basis in line with the
previous year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
