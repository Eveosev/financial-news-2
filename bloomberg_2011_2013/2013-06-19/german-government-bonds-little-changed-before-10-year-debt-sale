Germany’s  government bonds  rose for
the first time in three days as investors weighed what Federal
Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  will say about the central
bank’s asset-purchase program at a press conference today.  The  benchmark 10-year  bund yield approached the lowest
level in a week as investors sought fixed-income securities.
Bernanke is due to speak after the U.S. central bank ends a two-day policy meeting in  Washington . Portugal’s notes rose for a
fourth day as the nation sold 1.5 billion euros ($2.01 billion)
of bills. Coutts & Co. said it bought Irish government bonds
last week after volatility increased.  “The market is waiting to see what Bernanke will say about
when they will start tapering,” said Allan von Mehren, chief
analyst at  Danske Bank A/S (DANSKE)  in Copenhagen. “He will be very
careful because they don’t want to see bond yields go much
higher than this but they can live with them at these levels. We
have seen some volatility recently and that will continue.”  Germany ’s 10-year yield fell one basis point, or 0.01
percentage point, to 1.56 percent at 4:27 p.m.  London  time after
dropping to 1.51 percent on June 17, the lowest since June 7.
The 1.5 percent bund due in May 2023 rose 0.11, or 1.10 euros
per 1,000-euro face amount, to 99.475.  The 10-year yield will climb to 1.60 percent in six months,
Danske Bank’s von Mehren said.  Fed Outlook  The Fed will wait to reduce bond buying until its Oct. 29-30 meeting, when it will cut monthly purchases to $65 billion
from $85 billion, according to the median estimate in a June 4-5
Bloomberg survey of 59 economists. The  Federal Open Market
Committee  plans to release a statement at 2 p.m. in Washington,
while Bernanke’s press conference is due at 2:30 p.m.  “Bernanke has to address asset purchases and every nuance
in his replies will be seized upon by markets,”  Jim Reid , head
of fundamental strategy at Deutsche Bank AG in London, wrote in
a note to clients. “Our gut feeling is that the Fed will err on
the side of caution with regards to tapering talk and that no
additional signal will be given by the chairman to accelerate
the market’s fears.”  Italy ’s 10-year yield fell two basis points to 4.26 percent
and the rate on similar-maturity Spanish bonds fell three basis
points to 4.53 percent.  Spain  plans to sell as much as 4 billion euros of debt
maturing in 2018, 2021, and 2023 tomorrow. The nation last sold
the 4.4 percent bonds maturing in October 2023 on June 6 at an
average yield of 4.517 percent, the  lowest level  for a 10-year
sale since 2010.  German Sale  Germany allotted 4 billion euros of 10-year bunds today at
an average yield of 1.55 percent, the central bank said. The
nation received bids for 6.14 billion euros, compared with a 5
billion-euro target. The country last sold the securities on May
22 at average yield of 1.41 percent.  Portugal  sold 1.05 billion euros of 18-month bills and 450
million euros of six-month debt.  The securities due in December 2014 were allotted at an
average yield of 1.603 percent, the debt management agency said.
That compares with an average yield of 1.506 percent at a
previous auction of 18-month bills on March 20. The six-month
debt was sold at an average yield of 1.041 percent.  Portugal’s  two-year yield  fell 12 basis points to 3.26
percent after dropping to 3.22 percent, the lowest level since
June 11.  Buying Opportunity  Increased market volatility created a buying opportunity in
Irish bonds for Coutts, which oversees about $49 billion, Niamh Wylie, a  money manager  at the company in London told reporters
today in London.  Ireland’s  10-year yield  declined three basis points to 3.88
percent after climbing to 4.26 percent on June 11, the highest
level since March.  Volatility on Austrian bonds was the highest among euro-region markets today followed by those of France and  Finland ,
according to measures of 10-year debt, the yield spread between
two- and 10-year securities, and credit-default swaps. Swiss
bonds were the most volatile among developed markets, the
indexes showed.  German bonds handed investors a loss of 1 percent this year
through yesterday, according to Bloomberg World Bond Indexes.
Spanish securities returned 5.9 percent and Italy’s earned 3
percent, the indexes show.  To contact the reporters on this story:
