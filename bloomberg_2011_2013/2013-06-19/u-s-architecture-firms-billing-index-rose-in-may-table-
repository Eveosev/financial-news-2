Billings at U.S. architecture firms 
rose in May, according to the  American Institute of Architects .  Billings at architecture firms, tracked by the Work-on-the-Boards 
survey, rose to 52.9 in May from 48.6 a month earlier. The inquiry index,
which tracks a firm’s capacity to take on additional work, rose to 59.1.
A score above 50 indicates an increase in billings, while a reading below 
50 indicates a negative outlook.  Commercial building construction typically follows the billings
index by about six months. Following is a table compiled from the AIA
