The Abraaj Group, a Dubai buyout
firm managing $7.5 billion of assets, agreed to buy dairy
company Fan Milk International as it boosts  Africa  investments.  The acquisition of Fan Milk, a West African manufacturer
and distributor of frozen dairy products and juices, is expected
to close by the end of November, Abraaj said today in a
statement. Financial details of the deal weren’t given.  Abraaj has invested about $2.2 billion in sixty-nine
companies across Africa as the firm seeks to profit from growth
rates outpacing those in many developed nations. The Nigerian
economy is set to grow 7.2 percent this year according to the
 International Monetary Fund , compared with an estimated 5.6
percent growth rate for sub-Saharan Africa.  Fan Milk, through its subsidiaries, sells over 1.8 million
products daily across West Africa and the deal is the largest
ever in the so-called fast-moving consumer goods industry by a
private equity firm in the region outside  South Africa ,
according to the companies.  Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer acted as legal advisers to
Abraaj, with Norton Rose Fulbright advising Fan Milk, according
to the statement.  To contact the reporters on this story:
