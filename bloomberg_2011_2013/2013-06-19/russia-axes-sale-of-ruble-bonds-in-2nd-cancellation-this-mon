Russia scrapped a sale of 15-year
ruble bonds, the second time it has canceled an auction this
month, citing a lack of bids within the offered yield range.  The  Finance Ministry  planned to sell 10 billion rubles
($311 million) of the January 2028 notes with guidance of 7.70
percent to 7.75 percent, according to statements this week. The
yield on the bond climbed two basis points to 7.84 percent
before the results were announced, extending a 13 basis point
increase yesterday. The ministry sold all 10 billion rubles of a
new three-year note in a separate auction at an average yield of
6.43 percent.  The  Finance Ministry  canceled a June 5 auction ahead of
schedule and sold only 900 million rubles out of 20 billion
rubles offered on May 29. It shelved a sale on May 22 due to a
lack of competitive bids. U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  holds a press conference today, where he may shed more
light on when the Fed plans to trim its bond buying program
which has fuelled a rally in emerging-market debt.  To contact the reporter on this story:
