SAS Group, the Nordic region’s
largest airline, faces an in-depth investigation by European
Union regulators into whether state support by Sweden and
 Denmark  in 2012 may have violated EU state-aid rules.  The European Commission “has concerns regarding the
reliability of the business plan, on the basis of which the
public shareholders decided to participate” in a new revolving
credit facility that was part of a business plan prepared by SAS
to help it become profitable again, the EU regulator said in a
statement.  The European Low Fares Airline Association, whose members
include  Ryanair Holdings Plc (RYA)  and  EasyJet Plc (EZJ) , said in February
SAS’s credit line of 3.5 billion Swedish krona ($546 million)
was illegal state aid because it’s “effectively” guaranteed by
the Swedish, Danish and Norwegian governments that own stakes in
the carrier.  To contact the reporter on this story:
