Veolia Environnement , Europe’s
largest water utility, is building a seawater desalination plant
in Lamberts Bay on the southwest coast of  South Africa  to help
boost supplies for 40,000 residents.  Cederberg officials awarded the 17 million-rand ($1.7
million) contract for the facility after the company installed
six desalination plants along the Cape coast since 2009, Veolia
Water Solutions said today. The plant, due for commissioning in
October, will source seawater from boreholes drilled close to
Muisbosskerm, Veolia said.  “A steady increase in water consumption by the town and
surrounding farmers has resulted in an overall drop in
groundwater levels,” Cobus Olivier, engineering manager at
Veolia in Paarl, said in a statement. The new plant will help
Cederberg “correct this problem and improve water
sustainability.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
