Palm oil  fell for the first time in
four days on speculation that a rally to the highest level in
almost three months was overdone.  The contract for September delivery dropped as much as 0.8
percent to 2,449 ringgit ($775) a metric ton on the Bursa
Malaysia Derivatives and ended the morning session at 2,454
ringgit. Futures advanced yesterday to 2,468 ringgit, the
highest price at close for the most active contract since March
22. Palm for local  physical  delivery in July was at 2,460
ringgit yesterday, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Exports from Malaysia jumped 18 percent to 709,860 tons in
the first 15 days of this month, Intertek said June 15.
Shipments gained 16 percent to 707,148 tons in the same period,
with exports to  Pakistan  expanding almost 18 times to 107,650
tons from a month earlier, SGS (Malaysia) Sdn. said on June 17.
The two surveyors are scheduled to release estimates for the
first 20 days of the month tomorrow.  Traders are waiting “to see if the exports momentum will
be maintained,” said Vijay Mehta, a director of Commodity Links
Pte. in Singapore. “Fundamentally, the market is well-supported. The lower side is also limited because at the lower
levels, a lot of support is coming.”  Soybean oil  for December delivery gained 0.5 percent to
47.81 cents a pound on the Chicago Board of Trade, while
soybeans for delivery in November were little changed at $12.895
a bushel. Refined palm oil for January delivery declined 0.9
percent to 6,218  yuan  ($1,014) a ton on the  Dalian Commodity
Exchange , while soybean oil for delivery in the same month fell
0.4 percent to 7,658 yuan.  To contact the reporter on this story:
