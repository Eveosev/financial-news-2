The Group of Eight nations comment
on global efforts to protect the climate and cut emissions in
the aviation industry, according to a statement published
yesterday after a summit in Lough Erne,  Northern Ireland .  On progress in United Nations-overseen climate talks:  “In the UN Framework Convention on  Climate Change  we will
work to ensure that a new protocol, another legal instrument or
an agreed outcome with legal force under the convention
applicable to all parties is adopted by 2015, to come into
effect and be implemented from 2020.  ‘‘We also note with grave concern the gap between current
country pledges and what is needed and will work towards
increasing mitigation ambition in the period to 2020.’’  On climate-finance commitment:  ‘‘We reiterate our commitment to the developed countries’
goal of mobilizing jointly $100 billion of climate finance per
year by 2020 from a wide variety of sources in the context of
meaningful mitigation actions and transparency on implementation
and are advancing our efforts to continue to improve the
transparency of international climate finance flows.’’  On the need to curb  greenhouse gases  from aviation:  The nations called on the  International Civil Aviation
Organization  to agree in September ‘‘an ambitious package
related to both market-based and non-market based measures to
address rising aviation emissions.’’  To contact the reporter on this story:
