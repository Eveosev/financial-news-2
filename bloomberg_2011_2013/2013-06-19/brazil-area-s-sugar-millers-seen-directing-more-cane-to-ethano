Sugar millers in  Brazil ’s center
south, the main growing region of the world’s biggest producer,
may direct more cane to making ethanol than currently
forecast because rains are delaying the harvest and limiting
ethanol supplies, according to the  International Sugar
Organization .  The share of cane directed to making the biofuel in the
2013-14 season that started there in April may turn out to be
higher than the 53 percent currently forecast, Leonardo Bichara
Rocha, a senior economist at the ISO, said in an interview in
 London  today. Last year, about 50 percent of all the cane was
directed to ethanol production, he said.  “Rains are interrupting the harvest and the price of
ethanol has risen,” Rocha said. “There’s a current tightness
in the ethanol market.”  Brazil makes both sugar and ethanol from raw material sugar
cane. Sales of ethanol have been more advantageous than sugar as
prices for the sweetener slump due to excess supplies. The
global sugar surplus will be a record 10 million metric tons in
the 12 months ending Sept. 30, the ISO estimates.  “Even if the center south produces less sugar because of
ethanol, the market is unlikely to rise because of the
surplus,” Rocha said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
