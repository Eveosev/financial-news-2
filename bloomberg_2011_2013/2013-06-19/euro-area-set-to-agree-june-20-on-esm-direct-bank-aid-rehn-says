Euro-area finance ministers probably
will agree tomorrow on the terms for allowing the European
Stability Mechanism to recapitalize banks directly, Europe’s
economy chief said.  European Union Economic and Monetary Affairs Commissioner
Olli Rehn predicted a deal on the matter by finance ministers
from the 17 euro nations, the so-called eurogroup, when they
meet on June 20 in Luxembourg.  “I expect the eurogroup to agree on the principles and
rules of a direct-recapitalization instrument for the ESM
tomorrow,” Rehn told a conference today in Brussels.  The goal of allowing the 500 billion-euro ($669 billion)
ESM, the euro area’s permanent rescue fund, to infuse lenders
with emergency aid directly rather than via national governments
is tied to plans for a European banking union. The direct-recapitalization option is meant to hasten the end of the three-year-old debt crisis by breaking the link between sovereign debt
and banking woes.  Somewhere between 50 billion euros and 70 billion euros
might be set aside for direct bank aid via the ESM, which could
be able to offer such support starting in autumn 2014, a
European official said today in Brussels on the condition of
anonymity. The question of retroactivity in relation to direct
bank recapitalization remains politically contentious, according
to the official.  To contact the reporter on this story:
