MTU Aero Engines AG (MTX) ’s order intake
reached $1.1 billion in the past few days and will help the
company achieve its goal of 6 billion euros ($8 billion) of
sales in 2020, Chief Executive Officer Egon Behle said.  Behle, who leaves the company at the end of the year, told
reporters at the  Paris Air Show  today he won’t advance the
revenue target. “I want to give the new team the ability to top
my boring target,” he said.  MTU has a large involvement with  United Technologies
Corp. (UTX) ’s Pratt & Whitney unit on short-haul plane engines and
deeper ties with  General Electric Co. (GE)  for big planes, including
involvement on the GEnx powering the Boeing 787 and 747-8. The
narrow-body activity with Pratt, centered on the geared turbofan
engine, received a boost of around 1,000 engines at the expo,
Behle said.  The GTF, with deals for more than 4,500 turbines, “has
sold better than I would have imagined in my wildest dreams,”
Behle said. Winning the position as the exclusive powerplant
provider on  Embraer SA (EMBR3) ’s upgraded regional jets was also
unexpected only a few months before the Pratt powerplant was
selected, he said.  Behle said he wants to expand the company’s wide-body
activities through talks with GE to work on a new powerplant for
the Boeing Co. 777X long-range jet.  Negotiations with GE should be concluded by mid-2014 when
the world’s largest engine maker wants to complete its
partnership agreements for the GE9X turbine, Behle told
reporters. He wouldn’t specify what level of work the Munich-based company seeks.  To contact the reporter on this story:
