West Texas Intermediate crude fell
after Federal Reserve Chairman Ben S. Bernanke said the central
bank may start reducing bond purchases later this year and end
them in the middle of 2014.  Prices dropped as much as 0.9 percent in electronic trading
after the close of floor trading. The Fed will trim the $85
billion-a-month stimulus if the economy continues to improve as
the central bank forecasts, Bernanke said at a press conference
following a two-day policy meeting in  Washington . Futures closed
little changed before his remarks on a separate statement that
the Fed will keep buying government bonds at that pace.  “It represents a huge change in policy and that’s why the
market is down,” said Jason Schenker, president of Prestige
Economics LLC, an Austin, Texas-based energy consultant. “It’s
more bearish for the market.”  WTI for July delivery, which expires tomorrow, dropped 40
cents, or 0.4 percent, to $98.01 a barrel at 3:44 p.m. on the
New York Mercantile Exchange after falling to $97.57. The
contract settled at $98.24 a barrel earlier, down 20 cents from
yesterday’s nine-month high of $98.44. The volume of all futures
traded was 14 percent above the 100-day average for the time of
day at 4:36 p.m.  Brent for August settlement slid 19 cents to $105.83 a
barrel on the London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange. Volume
was 28 percent below the 100-day average. The European benchmark
grade’s premium over WTI widened to $7.64 using August
contracts. It was $7.35 yesterday, the narrowest based on
closing prices since January 2011.  FOMC Statement  The Federal Open Market Committee “currently anticipates
that it would be appropriate to moderate the pace of purchases
later this year,” Bernanke said, “if the incoming data are
broadly consistent with this forecast.”  The Fed also left unchanged its plans to hold the  target
interest rate  near zero as long as unemployment remains above
6.5 percent and the outlook for inflation doesn’t exceed 2.5
percent, according to a statement issued after the FOMC meeting.  U.S. equities declined and the dollar strengthened against
the euro after Bernanke’s comments, which were “bolder” than
the FOMC statement, Schenker said.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index dropped 1.4 percent. The
dollar gained as much as 1 percent to $1.3262 per euro. A
stronger dollar reduces oil’s appeal as an investment
alternative.  Economic Outlook  “They have left open the possibility of a reduction in
stimulus, which is worrisome,” said John Kilduff, a partner at
Again Capital LLC, a New York-based hedge fund that focuses on
energy.  Futures also fell as a government report showed crude
inventories unexpectedly rose last week.  Stockpiles increased 313,000 barrels to 394.1 million
barrels in the week ended June 14, the Energy Information
Administration, the Energy Department’s statistical arm, said.
Analysts surveyed by Bloomberg had expected a slide of 500,000
barrels.  Stockpiles reached an 82-year high of 397.6 million on May
24. Imports rose to 8.44 million barrels a day last week, the
most since Dec. 7.  “We are very well supplied,” said David McAlvany, chief
executive officer of McAlvany Financial Group in Durango,
 Colorado . “Prices should arguably be lower.”  Supplies at Cushing,  Oklahoma , the delivery point for New
York futures, slid 669,000 barrels to 48.6 million, the lowest
level since December.  U.S. Supplies  Gasoline  stockpiles  increased 183,000 barrels to 221.7
million and distillate fuels, which include diesel and heating
oil, fell 489,000 barrels to 121.6 million. Analysts had
forecast an increase of 750,000 barrels in gasoline and a gain
of 925,000 barrels in distillates.  Refineries increased their utilization rate to 89.3 percent
last week, the highest level since December, from the prior
week’s 87.5 percent.  The EIA report also showed that gasoline consumption
 increased  for the first time in three weeks, up 2.2 percent to
8.84 million barrels a day. Total petroleum demand gained 2.8
percent to 18.4 million barrels a day.  “There were mixed elements within the report, but the
overall sense was bearish,” said Tim Evans, an energy analyst
at Citi Futures Perspective in New York. The market “is not
becoming physically tighter overall.”  Implied volatility for at-the-money WTI options expiring in
August was 18.1 percent, down from 18.8 percent yesterday, data
compiled by Bloomberg showed.  Electronic trading volume on the Nymex was 608,578
contracts as of 4:36 p.m. It totaled 514,609 contracts
yesterday, 18.2 percent lower than the three-month average. Open
interest was a record 1.87 million contracts.  To contact the reporters on this story:
