The following is the text
of  Canada ’s wholesale trade report for April from
 Statistics Canada .  Wholesale sales rose 0.2% in April to $49.0 billion, mainly
as a result of higher sales in the computer and communications
equipment and supplies industry.  In volume terms, wholesale sales were up 0.4% in April.  The computer and communications equipment and supplies industry
leads the gain  In April, three of the seven subsectors, accounting for
about half of wholesale sales, reported increases.  The largest gain in dollar terms was in the machinery,
equipment and supplies subsector (+2.6%), largely because of a
10.4% advance in the computer and communications equipment and
supplies industry. Sales in this industry have been unstable in
recent months, alternating between large increases and decreases.  The personal and household goods subsector rose 1.6%,
mainly because of strength in the pharmaceuticals and pharmacy
supplies industry (+2.8%).  Sales rose in the miscellaneous subsector by 0.7%, its
fourth consecutive advance. Within this subsector, the
agricultural supplies industry increased 8.9%. The gain in the
agricultural supplies industry was largely offset by a decline
in the other miscellaneous industry (-8.7%).  The largest decline in dollar terms was in the motor
vehicle and parts subsector (-1.9%), mainly as a result of a
2.2% decrease in the motor vehicles industry.  Food, beverages and tobacco products (-1.4%) wholesalers
registered a third consecutive sales decline.  Sales in the farm products subsector (-2.3%) declined for
the fourth consecutive month.  Alberta posts the largest dollar increase  Wholesalers in five provinces reported higher sales for
April.  Sales in Alberta were up 1.4%, partially offsetting the
decline in March.  Quebec wholesalers posted a 0.6% sales gain in April.  New Brunswick  (+5.1%) posted the largest increase in
percentage terms, reversing the decrease in March.  Saskatchewan (-3.5%) posted the largest sales decline,
partially offsetting March’s gain.  Nova Scotia  (-2.2%) wholesalers reported the fifth decrease
in sales in six months.  Increase in inventories  Wholesale inventories rose 0.3% in April to $61.7 billion.
Inventories were up in four of the seven subsectors.  Inventory were up in the farm products subsector (+6.3%),
the miscellaneous subsector (+3.4%), the personal and household
goods subsector (+1.5%), and the motor vehicle and parts
subsector (+0.2%).  The inventory-to-sales ratio was unchanged at 1.26 in April.  The inventory-to-sales ratio is a measure of the time in
months required to exhaust inventories if sales were to remain
at their current level.  Note to readers  All data in this release are seasonally adjusted and in
