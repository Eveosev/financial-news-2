Siemens AG (SIE) , Europe’s largest maker
of power equipment, agreed to develop systems that convert waste
industrial gases into fuel using technology from LanzaTech NZ
Ltd.  Siemens’s Metals Technologies unit will collaborate with
LanzaTech for 10 years to commercialize and market systems for
the  steel industry , the two companies said today in a joint
statement.  LanzaTech’s fermentation  process  turns carbon monoxide and
carbon dioxide from steel mills into fuels and chemicals. Steel
and iron manufacturing produces 6.7 percent of global CO2
emissions, and turning the gas into fuel may help steel mills
lower operating costs and comply with government requirements
aimed at curbing  climate change , according to the statement.  Siemens has “developed a lot of the technologies that are
used in  steel mills ,” Jennifer Holmgren, chief executive
officer of Auckland, New Zealand-based LanzaTech said in an
interview today. The German company will help design new mills
that integrate LanzaTech’s process from the beginning or assist
with incorporating it into existing ones.  LanzaTech developed microorganisms that consume waste gases
to produce fuel and chemicals. Steel mills typically flare the
byproduct gas or use it to produce heat and electricity for
industrial processes.  LanzaTech completed two “pre-commercial” plants last year
at steel mills owned by the Chinese producers Shanghai Baosteel
Group Corp. and  Shougang Group . The sites each have ethanol
production capacity of 300 tons a year. Holmgren expects the
steelmakers to begin construction this year on larger facilities
that will begin production in 2014.  Siemens and LanzaTech are “already pursuing several
commercial gas fermentation project opportunities around the
world,” the companies said in the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
