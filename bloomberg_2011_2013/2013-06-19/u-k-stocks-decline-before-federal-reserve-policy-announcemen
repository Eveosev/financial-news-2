 U.K. stocks fell, snapping four
days of gains, as investors awaited the conclusion of a Federal
Reserve policy meeting for signals as to whether the central
bank will scale back stimulus measures.  The FTSE 100 Index dropped 44.25 points, or 0.7 percent, to
6,329.96 at 8:31 a.m. in  London . The equity benchmark has lost
7.5 percent since Fed Chairman Ben S. Bernanke said May 22 that
the central bank may scale back stimulus if the U.S. economy
improves sustainably. The broader FTSE All-Share Index also fell
0.7 percent today, while Irelandâ€™s ISEQ Index slid 0.1 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
