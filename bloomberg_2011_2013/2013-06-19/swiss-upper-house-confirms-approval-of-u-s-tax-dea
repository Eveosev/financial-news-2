Swiss parliament’s upper house
approved a bill allowing the country’s 300 banks to cooperate
with the U.S. to help catch tax evaders.  In a second round of voting, the upper house voted for the
measure 26 to 18, affirming its verdict of last week. In the
interim, the lower house rejected further debates of the bill,
potentially setting it up for derailment. The two chambers must
reconcile their differences by the end of the three-week
parliamentary session on June 21. The matter now goes back to
the lower house, which is scheduled to vote this afternoon.  The Swiss government wants to prevent the indictment of
another of the country’s bank. Wegelin & Co. was indicted last
year and pleaded guilty in January to helping U.S. taxpayers
hide assets from the Internal Revenue Service. The bank had
taken over clients from  UBS AG (UBSN) , which avoided prosecution in
2009 by admitting it aided tax evasion, paying $780 million and
handing over client names.  The bill would allow Swiss banks to hand over data to the
U.S. and negotiate individual settlements. Parliamentarians have
criticized it because the terms of the agreement were dictated
by the U.S. and haven’t been made public.  To contact the reporter on this story:
