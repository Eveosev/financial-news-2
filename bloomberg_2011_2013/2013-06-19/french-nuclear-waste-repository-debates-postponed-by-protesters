French plans to develop a nuclear-waste repository were set back for a second time when a public
meeting on the project was postponed by local opposition.  A debate scheduled for tomorrow in Nancy, northeastern
 France , will be delayed because a similar meeting earlier this
week was disrupted by protests, organizers said today in a
statement. The Nancy debate hasn’t yet been rescheduled.  France is seeking to store highly radioactive and long-life
waste from  Electricite de France SA ’s 58 reactors, as well as
from  Areva SA (AREVA)  and atomic-research organization CEA, at a site
near Bure, which straddles the Meuse and Haute-Marne regions.
Public meetings on the plan, known as Cigeo, must take place by
law. So far, they’ve been disrupted and canceled amid protests.  The organizers “recognize once again the impossibility of
holding a public meeting on the Cigeo project because of
orchestrated troubles,” they said on an official  website  for
the process, which is due to last through October. A meeting on
May 23 in Bure ended as opponents clashed with the police and
the organizers. One at Bar-le-Duc June 17 was also canceled.  Andra, the waste-management agency spearheading the plan,
is seeking to start construction in 2019 and begin operations in
2025. The public debate is supposed to result in a non-binding
report on the project, which also needs approval from the
 nuclear safety authority  as well as a new law making the waste
disposal reversible for a limited period.  To contact the reporter on this story:
