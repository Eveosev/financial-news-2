Tom Adshead, head of research at
Russian hedge-fund firm Kazimir Partners Ltd., said he’s left
following its acquisition of Renaissance Asset Managers.  Adshead, who joined Kazimir a year ago from Sito Capital,
said today in an e-mail he will be working on “other
projects,” without elaborating.  His departure comes after Elena Kolchina, head of fixed
income at Renaissance Asset Managers, said yesterday she is also
leaving. Frank Mosier, Kazimir’s founder, didn’t immediately
respond to calls or an e-mail seeking comment.  Kazimir, a hedge-fund firm focusing on  Russia  and the
former Soviet Union nations, bought the fund manager in March
from founder Stephen Jennings, whose Renaissance Capital
investment bank has been dismantled over the past year. Started
in 2003, Renaissance Asset Managers employs more than 50 people
and oversees $2.8 billion in  emerging markets , according to its
website.  Kazimir Partners was founded in 2002 by Mosier and Dmitri Kryukov, both former senior executives at RenCap. It’s currently
merging its team and funds with those of Renaissance, which
focused on Russia, eastern Europe and  Africa .  Adshead was previously head of research at investment bank
United Financial Group in Moscow and a senior analyst at Troika
Dialog before switching to portfolio management at Alfa Capital
in 2006.  To contact the reporter on this story:
