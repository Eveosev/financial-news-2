Ethanol’s discount to gasoline
expanded to the widest differential in more than two months
after a government report signaled that higher imports of the
fuel are replenishing a record-low supply.  The spread, or price difference, weakened 2.8 cents to
40.74 cents a gallon after the Energy Information Administration
said  U.S. imports  of the biofuel jumped to 65,000 barrels a day
last week from none a week earlier. Stockpiles rose for the
second time since April, one week after dropping to an all-time
low.  “The recent arrival of Brazilian material into  Florida  has
helped relieve some of the issues associated with the record-low
inventory situation the industry was facing” along the East
Coast, said Michael Breitenbach, a broker and director of
research at Blue Ocean Brokerage LLC in  New York .  Denatured ethanol for July delivery fell 1.5 cents, or 0.6
percent, to $2.485 a gallon on the Chicago Board of Trade.
Prices are up 13 percent this year.  Gasoline for July delivery advanced 1.3 cents, or 0.5
percent, to $2.8924 a gallon on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange . The contract covers reformulated gasoline, made to be
blended with ethanol before delivery to filling stations.  Imports reached the highest level since January, the EIA,
the Energy Department’s analytical arm, said today.  “Whether these supplies will continue in sufficient
quantities as we move into July and August is a question yet to
be decided,” Breitenbach said.  Brazilian Competition  Brazil , which uses sugarcane to make ethanol, is the
largest supplier of the fuel to the U.S. Anhydrous ethanol in
 Sao Paulo  cost $2.29 a gallon as of June 14, data compiled by
Bloomberg show, the cheapest since Nov. 9.  Ethanol  production  fell 1.2 percent to 873,000 barrels a
day, the least since May 24, the EIA report showed. That’s down
3 percent from a year earlier.  Stockpiles in the week ended June 14 increased 2.9 percent
to 16.5 million barrels, the highest level in six weeks.
Inventories as of June 7 were 16 million barrels, the lowest in
records going back to June 2010, EIA data show.  Output of the fuel has been  below average  this year as the
industry struggles to rebound to rates prior to last summer’s
U.S. drought, which pushed corn prices to a record and eroded
profits to make ethanol.  Corn Prices  Corn for July delivery rose 9 cents to $6.8225 a bushel in
 Chicago . The corn crush spread, or the cost difference between a
gallon of ethanol and the corn needed to make it, was minus 1
cent, compared with 5 cents yesterday, data compiled by
Bloomberg show.  A 2007 energy law requires the U.S. to use 13.8 billion
gallons of ethanol this year. The government and refiners use
tracking certificates, called Renewable Identification Numbers,
or RINs, which are attached to each gallon of biofuel to track
compliance. They can also be traded.  Corn-based ethanol RINs  today rose 1 cent to 91 cents and
 advanced RINs , which cover Brazilian sugarcane-based ethanol and
biodiesel, gained 2 cents to 99 cents.  In cash market trading, ethanol was unchanged in New York
at $2.605 a gallon, data compiled by Bloomberg show. The fuel
lost 2.5 cents to $2.545 in Chicago, 0.5 cent to $2.615 on the
 Gulf Coast  and 1 cent to $2.83 a gallon on the West Coast.  West Coast ethanol’s premium to the Gulf Coast narrowed 0.5
cent to 21.5 cents while Chicago’s discount to New York Harbor
swelled 2.5 cents to 6 cents.  To contact the reporter on this story:
