Al Kazeem and jockey James Doyle won
the Prince of  Wales ’s Stakes, the main race on the second day of
England’s Royal Ascot meeting.  The five-year-old, an 11-4 chance trained by Roger
Charlton, overhauled Mukhadram (14-1) in the closing strides of
the race. The Fugue was third at odds of 13-2. Camelot, the 5-2
favorite, was fourth of the 11 runners.  The 1 1/4-mile race carried a top prize of 284,000 pounds
($445,000).  Doyle, 25, went on to win the next two races, with Belgian
Bill (33-1) in the Royal Hunt Cup and Rizeena (6-1) in the Queen
Mary Stakes. His treble success had combined odds of almost 900-1.  The five-day Royal Ascot meeting, west of London, is the
richest in the U.K. with prize money of 5 million pounds.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
