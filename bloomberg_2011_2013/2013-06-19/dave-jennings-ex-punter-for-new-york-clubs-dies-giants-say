Dave Jennings, an All-Pro punter who
spent his entire National Football League career playing for the
two New York teams before turning to broadcasting, has died at
the age of 61.  Jennings, who had the chronic degenerative neurological
disorder  Parkinson’s disease  since 1996, died this morning at
his home in  Upper Saddle River ,  New Jersey , the Giants said in a
news release. The specific cause of death wasn’t disclosed.  “Dave Jennings was one of the all-time great Giants,”
 John Mara , the team’s president, said in a statement. “He was a
valued member of the Giants family for more than 30 years as a
player and a broadcaster, and we were thrilled to include him in
our Ring of Honor. More importantly, he was an outstanding
person who battled his illness with rare courage and dignity. We
will miss him dearly.”  David Tuthill Jennings was born on June 8, 1952, in  New
York City . After not playing football at Garden City High School
on  Long Island , Jennings attended St. Lawrence University,
earning two letters in basketball and walking onto the football
team as a punter. He became a three-time All-Conference
selection and earned a bachelor’s degree in economics.  Jennings played from 1974 to 1984 for the Giants. He led
the league with a 44.8 yards per punt average in 1980 and was
named an All-Pro in 1979 and 1980. He holds the franchise record
for punting yards with 38,792, and with 951 punts, 405 more than
runner-up Sean Landeta.  “Dave could have participated in different sports, but he
had punting down to a science,” Harry Carson, the Hall of Fame
linebacker who was Jennings’s teammate, said in a statement.  Ball Placement  “He could position the ball where he wanted it to go. He
had a terrific sense of placement. He took his job very
seriously, and he made it his own little science to punt the
ball where it needed to be.”  Jennings played for the  New York  Jets from 1985 to 1987 and
worked as a radio commentator for the team from 1988 to 2001. He
joined the Giants’ radio booth in 2002 and was replaced after
the 2007 season.  Jennings is survived by his sister, Susan Jennings, and her
husband, Harley. Funeral plans weren’t disclosed. The family has
asked that contributions in his memory be made to the Michael J.
Fox Foundation.  To contact the reporter on this story:
