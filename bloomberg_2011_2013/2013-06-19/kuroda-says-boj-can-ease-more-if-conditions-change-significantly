Bank of Japan  Governor Haruhiko Kuroda said that the central bank could add to its unprecedented
monetary easing announced two months ago should economic
conditions change significantly.  The April 4 package could be expanded or reduced as needed,
Kuroda told lawmakers today. The BOJ said in its latest
statement that it will make policy adjustments “as
appropriate.” In April, Kuroda said that policy makers had done
everything “necessary” and “possible” to counter deflation
and spur growth.  While the BOJ has laid out a two-year plan for doubling the
monetary base, that doesn’t mean that no further actions will be
taken over that period, Kuroda told parliament today. Economists
including Naohiko Baba, chief  Japan  economist at Goldman Sachs
Group Inc., have said the BOJ could expand easing in October,
when price forecasts will indicate whether progress has been
made towards achieving a goal of 2 percent inflation.  “The policy we decided on April 4, we are not saying that
we will not change it for two years, and if the economic or
financial situation changes significantly, and what we decided
on April 4 was insufficient, or was too much, we would adjust up
or down,” Kuroda said.  A policy statement this month restated the April pledge to
increase the monetary base by 60 trillion to 70 trillion yen
($736 billion) per year.  To contact the reporters on this story:
