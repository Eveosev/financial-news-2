The  Micex Index (INDEXCF)  fell for the first
time in four days on investor concern the  Federal Reserve  may
signal a faster-than-expected tapering of U.S. financial
stimulus, while  Russia ’s central bank chairman warned of
“abnormally high” capital outflows.  The country’s benchmark equities gauge lost 0.9 percent to
1,323.57 by the close in Moscow. Russia’s stocks have the
cheapest valuations among 21 emerging markets tracked by
Bloomberg. OAO Sberbank, Russia’s biggest lender, dropped 1.9
percent to 94.57 rubles. The stock lost 2.9 percent to $11.74 in
 London .  Fed Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  holds a press conference today
after a two-day policy meeting. More than $2 trillion has been
lost from global markets since May 22, when Bernanke signaled
Fed may trim its asset-buying program. While Russian capital
outflow sank to $54 billion in 2012 from $81 billion the year
before, it remains high, central bank Chairman Sergey Ignatiev
said today in Moscow.  “We’re expecting the market to react to Bernanke’s speech
at the meeting,” Oleg Popov, who manages $1 billion of
securities for Allianz Investments, the asset-management arm of
 Europe ’s biggest insurer, said by phone from Moscow. “If the
Fed decides to curb the asset-buying program, we’ll see a major
correction, while assurances that the stimulus program will
continue may be a strong growth driver.”  IMF Cuts  Russia’s outgoing central bank chairman said today a single
network of at least 1,173 sham companies is responsible for
illegally channeling a minimum of 760 billion rubles ($24
billion) from the country.  The International Monetary Fund yesterday cut its growth
forecast for Russia to 2.5 percent this year and 3.25 percent in
2014, compared with April predictions of 3.4 percent and 3.8
percent, respectively. The Washington-based lender cautioned the
country against the danger of stoking inflation with fiscal
stimulus, urging policy makers to improve the business climate.  OAO Mechel (MTL) , Russia’s biggest coking coal producer, jumped
the most in three months yesterday in  New York  after announcing
a $100 million American depositary receipts buyback plan that
would cost more than half its cash on hand. ADRs soared 9.9
percent to $3.12 yesterday, while shares added as much as 3.8
percent, before tumbling 0.9 percent to 97.20 rubles in Moscow.  The company, which had $170 million in cash at the end of
March and $9.2 billion of net debt after posting a first-quarter
loss, may struggle to pay for the buyback, according to Denis
Gabrielik, an analyst at Otkritie Capital who plans to cut his
rating on the stock to sell from hold.  “The question is where  Mechel (MTLR)  is going to get money for
this buyback,” Allianz’s Popov said. “Investors may choose to
use this moment to exit the stock.”  Bear Market  Even after surging, Mechel  leads losses  among Russian
companies traded in the U.S. this year as declining output dims
the outlook for earnings. Its ratio of net debt to equity, a
measure of leverage, soared to 2.7 at the end of 2012, an
unprecedented level for the company, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg. Mechel’s preferred shares fell 2.4 percent to 54
rubles in Moscow.  OAO GMK  Norilsk Nickel  fell 0.7 percent to 4,711 rubles.
Russia’s biggest producer of the metal declined 1.4 percent to
$14.60. Nickel dropped in London.  OAO TMK, the world’s biggest pipemaker by output, rose as
much as 3 percent, trading up 2.6 percent to 79.60 rubles. TMK
replaced OAO OGK-2 in the 50-stock Micex and RTS indexes from
yesterday.  The dollar-denominated RTS  Index (RTSI$) , which entered a  bear
market  on June 5, dropped 1.7 percent to 1,291.72. Consumer
services and utilities stocks were the biggest decliners among
nine industry groups on the Micex, retreating 1.1 percent on
average. OAO Magnit, Russia’s biggest food retailer, retreated
2.5 percent to 7,140.70 rubles, the most since June 3. The stock
plunged 2.6 percent to $26 in London.  Relative Strength  The 14-day  relative strength index  on the Micex fell to
43.6 after sliding to 31.4 last week, the closest since April to
a level of 30, which signals a rebound to some analysts. On the
Micex, 13 stocks increased, one was unchanged and 36 dropped.
The volume of shares traded on the gauge was 29 percent below
the 30-day average, while 10-day price swings subsided to
26.116.  Crude oil, Russia’s chief export earner, was little changed
at $98.33,  after a government report showed U.S. inventories
unexpectedly rose last week. Brent for August settlement
increased 0.1 percent to $106.14 a barrel on the London-based
ICE Futures Europe exchange.  Russia’s economy grew 1.6 percent in the first three
months, decelerating for a fifth quarter and missing the medium-term target of 5 percent set by Prime Minister  Dmitry Medvedev ,
the slowest pace since 2009.  Refinancing Rate  Bank Rossii held its refinancing rate at 8.25 percent on
June 10. That matched the median estimate in a Bloomberg survey
of 26 economists, with four predicting a quarter percentage
point cut. Inflation in Russia accelerated for a second month in
May to the fastest pace in 21 months.  Out of 50 stocks on the Micex, one closed yesterday at a
 52-week low  and none at highs, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. Twenty-two stocks, or 44 percent, were trading above
their  50-day moving average .  The Micex trades at 4.9 times its 12-month estimated
earnings, having lost 10 percent this year, compared with a
multiple of 9.8 for the MSCI  Emerging Markets  Index, which is
down 10 percent.  The Russian Volatility Index climbed 4.1 percent to 28.74,
the first gain in four days. The Bloomberg Russia-US Equity
Index of the most-traded Russian companies in the U.S. dropped 1
percent to 86.16.  To contact the reporter on this story:
