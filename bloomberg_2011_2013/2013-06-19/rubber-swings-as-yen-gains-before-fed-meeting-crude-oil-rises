Rubber futures in Tokyo swung
between gains and losses as Japan’s currency weakened against
the dollar on prospects the Federal Reserve today will signal
the fate of U.S. monetary stimulus.  The contract for delivery in November on the Tokyo
Commodity Exchange was little changed at 236.3 yen a kilogram
($2,481 a metric ton) at 11:55 a.m. in Tokyo after trading
between 241.5 yen and 235.5 yen. The most-active contract has
declined 22 percent this year.  Fed Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  will speak to reporters at the
end of a two-day policy meeting today. He signaled May 22 that
the central bank’s asset buying program aimed at bolstering the
world’s largest economy could be scaled back. Oil in New York
traded near a nine-month high after an industry report showed
U.S. stockpiles dropped last week. Higher  oil prices  boost the
cost of making synthetic rubber.  “The focus is on remarks from Bernanke after the policy
meeting ends today,”  Kazuhiko Saito , an analyst at broker
Fujitomi Co. in Tokyo, said by phone today. “The yen could
rebound on  risk aversion  if his comments spur sales of stocks.”  Higher exports on a weaker yen helps boost the outlook of
raw-material demand from Japanese manufacturers, Saito said.
Japan’s exports surged by the most since 2010 in May as the yen
depreciated, the  Finance Ministry  said today. The yen traded at
95.26 per dollar.  Rubber in Tokyo is still poised for a fifth monthly drop as
global supply is set to exceed demand for a third year. The
contract for delivery in September on the Shanghai Futures
Exchange dropped 0.9 percent to 18,020  yuan  ($2,940) a ton.  Thai rubber free-on-board dropped 0.6 percent to 85.50 baht
a kilogram yesterday, according to the Rubber Research Institute
of Thailand.  To contact the reporter on this story:
