British and Irish Lions winger
 George North  was passed fit for the series-opening rugby Test
against Australia in three days.  The 21-year-old North, who leads the Lions on their 2013
tour in  clean line breaks and meters gained , had been in doubt
for the match in  Brisbane  after missing the past two games
because of a hamstring injury.  “George came through a fitness test this morning and I’ve
never seen him in better shape,” Howley said in televised news
conference comments. “We’ve looked after him over the last week
to 10 days and it’s a huge boost to have someone like him
available.”  With head coach Warren Gatland scheduled to name his team
tomorrow,  Jamie Roberts  is “unlikely to be fit” because of a
hamstring injury, while fellow center Manu Tuilagi is “touch
and go” as he recovers from a shoulder injury, Howley added.  The Lions lost their 100 percent record in the sixth game
of their 10-match trip yesterday with a 14-12 defeat to the ACT
Brumbies in Canberra. It was the combined team’s first loss to
provincial opposition since 1997.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
