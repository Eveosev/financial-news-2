Tradition Financial Services Ltd. , a
broker of over-the-counter physical and derivative products,
hired four people to start an agricultural commodities desk.  The London-based company, known as TFS, expects to start
broking deals in soft commodities such as sugar, cocoa and
coffee, as well as grains in September, said  Mike Anderson , a
managing director of TFS running the energy and commodities
desks. Two brokers have joined the company, while another will
start in July and the last one in August, he said.  “We do oil, power, gas, coal, emissions and more recently
biofuels have become more prevalent,” Anderson said in a
telephone interview from  London  today. “It’s an obvious next
step for us to be involved in softs because of the crossover
with biofuels. Sugar goes into ethanol and ethanol is a
component of gasoline, particularly in the  United States .”  TFS will start broking agricultural commodities with four
people and depending on customers’ needs, the company may look
at hiring more people toward the end of the year, according to
Anderson.  Soft commodities and grains are also important to the
company because they are part of the portfolios of many of TFS’s
clients, he said, adding their clients include several  hedge
funds  and big trading houses.  To contact the reporter on this story:
