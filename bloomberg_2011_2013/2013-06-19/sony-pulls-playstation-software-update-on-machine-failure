Sony Corp. (6758)  withdrew a software
update for its PlayStation 3 console after reports some machines
stopped working.  The system software update, version 4.45, caused “a small
number” of PlayStation 3 systems to stop displaying the cross
media bar used to navigate to different functions on the
machine, said Dan Race, a PlayStation spokesman.  Sony, Microsoft Corp. and Nintendo Co. occasionally deliver
software updates to their game consoles to improve stability or
deliver new applications and features. A posting on the
microblogging site Twitter said the latest update would deliver
more “trophy notification options and improved system
stability.” Users can download updates themselves or set their
machines to automatically update.  “We have temporarily taken 4.45 offline and are
investigating the cause of the problem,” Race said in an e-mail.  Sony’s American depositary receipts fell 91 cents, or 4.3
percent, to $20.49 at the close in  New York . The Tokyo-based
company’s ADRs have gained 83 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
