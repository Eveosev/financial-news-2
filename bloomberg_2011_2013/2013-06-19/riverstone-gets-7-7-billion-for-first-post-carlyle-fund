Riverstone Holdings LLC raised $7.7
billion for a new private-equity energy fund, its first since
ending a joint venture with Carlyle Group LP.  Riverstone Global Energy & Power Fund V LP, which the New
York-based firm began marketing to investors in the second half
of 2011, surpassed its $6 billion target, according to a
statement today. Riverstone last year increased the amount it
could gather from investors to $7.5 billion from $6.5 billion,
two people familiar with the matter said in November. The final
tally includes the firmâ€™s own commitment to the fund.  Private-equity natural resources funds raised $9.7 billion
in the first quarter, after gathering $22.5 billion in 2012,
according to London-based research firm Preqin. At the end of
the first quarter, 30 funds were seeking $26.8 billion,
including $5 billion by First Reserve Corp. and $1.5 billion for
KKR & Co.  The new Riverstone fund has already begun investing,
putting $2.3 billion into 19 companies, the firm said in the
statement. Riverstone makes buyout and growth capital
investments in the exploration and production, midstream,
oilfield services, power and renewable segments of the  energy
industry .  Riverstone and Carlyle entered into a joint venture in 2000
that allowed either firm to end partnership at the start of a
fundraising cycle. Riverstone took the option when it began
marketing the fifth fund.  To contact the reporter on this story:
