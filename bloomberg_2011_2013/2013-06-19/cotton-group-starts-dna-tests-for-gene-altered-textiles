The International Cotton Association
said it is starting DNA testing of textiles at its research
center in Bremen,  Germany , to determine if products are made
from genetically modified plants.  ICA Bremen agreed in May to partner with Impetus Bioscience
to perform the DNA tests, which will also be used to reveal what
species of cotton a textile is sourced from, according to a
statement sent by e-mail today.  “The traceability of cotton varieties in finished textiles
is becoming increasingly important, with many retailers and
labeling organizations looking for suitable and reliable
analytical tools,” Kai Hughes, managing director of  ICA Bremen ,
said in the statement. “ICA Bremen can now test finished
textile garments to identify whether they contain genetically
modified cotton.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
