President  Barack Obama  said the
civil war in Syria threatens to spill over its borders unless a
political settlement that brings a new government to power can
be negotiated.  As the U.S. steps up military assistance to the rebels
battling Bashar al-Assad’s regime, Obama said the U.S. will keep
pressing for negotiations and for  Russia , which has backed
Assad, to fully back those efforts.  “We need to create a transitional governing body with full
powers,” Obama said at a news conference in Berlin with German
Chancellor  Angela Merkel .  Obama refused to give specifics about what military aid the
U.S. would provide.  At the conclusion of a Group of Eight nations meeting in
Northern Ireland yesterday, Russian President  Vladimir Putin 
dismissed assertions by the U.S., U.K. and France that Assad
used chemical weapons and said arming the opposition would led
to more bloodshed and putting extremists in power.  “At this point, President Putin believes that what would
replace Assad would be worse than Assad himself,” Obama said.
“What will become more and more apparent to him over the weeks
and months, that without a different government, you cannot
bring peace.”  Obama, Putin and the other G-8 leaders agreed on a
statement calling for establishment of a transitional government
as quickly as possible, stopping short of calling for Assad’s
ouster.  To contact the reporters on this story:
