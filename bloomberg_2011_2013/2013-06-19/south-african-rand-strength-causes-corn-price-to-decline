South African corn futures fell as
the rand rebounded from three sessions of declines against the
dollar, making imported grain cheaper.  Yellow corn for delivery in July, the most active contract,
declined 1.7 percent to 2,260 rand ($228) a metric ton by the
noon close on the South African Futures Exchange in
Johannesburg. The white variety for delivery in the same month
dropped 1.5 percent to 2,293 rand a ton.  The rand advanced against the U.S. currency after  South
Africa ’s current-account deficit narrowed unexpectedly and
inflation slowed more than estimated by economists.  “The stronger rand largely contributed to today’s fall in
prices,” Andrew Fletcher, an independent trader, said by phone
from Kroonstad in the Free State province.  South Africa is the continent’s largest corn producer. Meal
made from the white variety is a staple food, while yellow corn
is mainly used as  animal feed .  Wheat for delivery in July dropped 0.6 percent to 3,562
rand a ton.  To contact the reporter on this story:
