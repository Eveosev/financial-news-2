Lackluster growth and rising debt
levels are making it “more difficult to support” the positive
outlook on  Brazil ’s credit rating, according to Mauro Leos,
senior credit officer at Moody’s Investors Service.  “Questions about growth and the trend of the debt ratios
are ones that are leading us to question whether a positive
outlook can still be supported,” Leos said in a telephone
interview from  New York . “Perception about Brazil has started
to turn negative. This is complicating matters more.”  Moody’s will decide in the second half of 2013 whether to
change the outlook on Brazil’s Baa2 rating, Leos said. The
rating itself, two levels above junk, is “well-positioned,” he
said.  Standard & Poor’s  cut the outlook on its equivalent BBB
rating to negative from stable on June 6.  Latin America’s largest economy is forecast by analysts
surveyed by the central bank to grow less than 3 percent for a
third consecutive year in 2013. Structural problems include high
labor costs and low investment, Leos said.  Brazil’s ratio of debt to gross domestic product is almost
60 percent, compared with less than 40 percent for Mexico,
Turkey and India, Leos said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
