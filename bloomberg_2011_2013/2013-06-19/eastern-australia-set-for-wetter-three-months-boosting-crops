Grain-growing regions in eastern
parts of  Australia , the third-biggest exporter, are set for a
wetter-than-normal three-month period, boosting optimism output
will rebound after dry weather hurt crops last year.  The chance of exceeding median  rainfall  for July to
September is more than 60 percent over most of mainland
Australia, except for parts of the coast of  Western Australia ,
the Bureau of Meteorology said today. Parts of northern Victoria
and southern New South Wales, last year’s biggest wheat grower,
have a more than 80 percent chance of a wetter three-month
period, it said.  Australia increased its harvest estimate last week,
forecasting a 15 percent gain in wheat production this year
after rains boosted soil moisture. Wheat has tumbled 11 percent
this year, joining corn and soybeans in bear markets, as farmers
worldwide boost production. The downside potential for crop
prices is the biggest trading opportunity across commodity
markets, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. says.  “Most of the country has had a pretty good start,” said
Graydon Chong, a grains and oilseed analyst at Rabobank
International in Sydney. “These rains, if we get consistent
rains throughout spring, will set us up for a pretty good
harvest.”  Australia may produce 25.4 million metric tons of wheat in
2013-2014, the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource
Economics and Sciences said June 12. That compares with 24.9
million tons forecast in March and 22.1 million tons a year
earlier, it said. The U.S. is set to be the world’s largest
wheat exporter in 2012-2013 followed by the European Union and
Australia, according to the  U.S. Department of Agriculture .  Farmers worldwide will harvest 695.9 million tons in
2013-2014 from 655.6 million tons a year earlier, the USDA said
June 12. A 6.6 percent increase in output from  Canada  and gains
of 43 percent in  Russia  and 24 percent in Ukraine will counter
an 8.3 percent drop in the U.S., the agency forecasts.  To contact the reporter on this story:
