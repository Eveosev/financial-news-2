A joint venture between Americas
Trading Group and  NYSE Euronext (NYX)  filed a formal request to open
an exchange that would break  BM&FBovespa SA (BVMF3) ’s monopoly in stock
trading in the country.  Americas Trading System Brasil, as the joint venture is
known, expects to start operating in the first half of 2014,
depending on regulatory approval, Chief Executive Officer Alan Gandelman said in a telephone interview from Sao Paulo.  “We are really doing this,” Gandelman said. “It will be
positive for the Brazilian stock market.”  BM&FBovespa’s press office didn’t immediately respond to a
phone call from  Bloomberg News  seeking comment. The exchange’s
chief financial officer, Eduardo Guardia, said in April that the
market is too small for two competitors and that a potential
rival would have to set up a clearinghouse because BM&FBovespa
isn’t legally obligated to share the one it has.  Shares of BM&FBovespa declined 3.4 percent to 12.65 reais
at 2:23 p.m. in  Sao Paulo , the biggest drop since June 11 on a
closing basis. The stock has lost 9.7 percent this year while
the Ibovespa, the benchmark equity gauge, has slumped 19 percent
during the same period.  To contact the reporter on this story:
