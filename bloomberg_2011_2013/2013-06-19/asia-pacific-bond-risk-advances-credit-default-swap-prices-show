The cost of insuring corporate and
sovereign bonds in the Asia-Pacific region against non-payment
rose, according to credit-default swap traders.  The Markit iTraxx Asia index of 40 investment-grade
borrowers outside  Japan  gained 1 basis point to 136 basis points
as of 8:27 a.m. in  Hong Kong , Australia & New Zealand Banking
Group Ltd. prices show. The benchmark is headed for its highest
close since June 13, according to data provider CMA.  The Markit iTraxx Australia index rose 2 basis points to
126 as of 10:17 a.m. in Sydney, according to National Australia
Bank Ltd. prices. The measure, which has ranged from 96.1 basis
points to 134 basis points this year, is set for its second
straight rise, according to CMA, which is owned by McGraw-Hill
Cos. and compiles prices quoted by dealers in the privately
negotiated market.  The Markit iTraxx Japan index increased 1.5 basis points to
109.5 as of 9:15 a.m. in  Tokyo , according to Citigroup Inc.
prices. The gauge is up 4.1 basis points this week through
yesterday, CMA prices show.  Credit-default swap indexes are benchmarks for insuring
bonds against default and traders use them to speculate on
 credit quality . A drop signals improving perceptions of
creditworthiness, while an increase suggests the opposite.  The swap contracts pay the buyer face value in exchange for
the underlying securities if a borrower fails to meet its debt
agreements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
