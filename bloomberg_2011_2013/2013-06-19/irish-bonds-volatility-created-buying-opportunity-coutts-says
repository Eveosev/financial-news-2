Coutts & Co. bought Irish government
bonds last week after market volatility increased, according to
Niamh Wylie, a  money manager  at the company.  The yield on Ireland’s 10-year bond climbed to 4.26 percent
on June 11, the highest since March.  The increase in volatility created a buying opportunity for
Coutts, which oversees about $49 billion, Wylie told reporters
in London today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
