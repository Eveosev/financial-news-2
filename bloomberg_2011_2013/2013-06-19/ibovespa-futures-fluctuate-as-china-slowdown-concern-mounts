Ibovespa  futures  fluctuated between
gains and losses amid speculation that  China ,  Brazil ’s top
trading partner, will take further steps to cool the economy.  Paper maker Klabin SA may be active after Goldman Sachs
Group Inc. lowered its recommendation to sell. Braskem SA,  Latin
America ’s largest petrochemicals producer, was raised to the
equivalent of buy at Banco Itau BBA SA. Homebuilder MRV
Engenharia & Participacoes SA may move after extending a share
buyback program for one year.  Ibovespa futures contracts expiring in August added 0.2
percent to 49,630 at 9:52 a.m. in Sao Paulo after earlier
falling as much as 0.5 percent. The real gained 0.4 percent to
2.1721 per dollar, strengthening for the first time in four
days. Chinese stocks dropped as money-market rates surged and
investors speculated the government will step up property curbs.  The Ibovespa plunged into a bear market last week after
falling more than 20 percent from this year’s peak in January on
concern that accelerating inflation will curb the recovery in
Latin America’s largest economy.  Brazil’s benchmark equity gauge trades at 11.9 times
analysts’  earnings estimates  for the next four quarters, which
compares with a multiple of 10.1 for the MSCI  Emerging Markets 
Index of 21 developing nations’ equities.  Trading volume for stocks in  Sao Paulo  was 6.73 billion
reais ($3.09 billion) yesterday, compared with a daily average
of 7.85 billion reais this year through June 14, according to
data  compiled  by the exchange.  To contact the reporter on this story:
