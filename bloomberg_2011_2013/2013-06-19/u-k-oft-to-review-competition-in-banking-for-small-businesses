The U.K. Office of Fair Trading will
review whether a lack of competition in banking is hampering
lending and other services to small and medium-sized businesses.  The Competition and Markets Authority, a new regulator
taking over from the OFT and the Competition Commission later
this year, will use the study in deciding whether to start a
full investigation by 2015, the antitrust agency said in a
statement today.  “A competitive banking system and access to finance is
vital to businesses and to economic growth,” OFT Chief
Executive Officer Clive Maxwell said.  A parliamentary commission investigating banking failures
today published a report criticizing lenders for a culture of
greed and pursuing short-term gains. It asked for the government
to consider splitting  Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc  to
separate bad assets and focus its operations on retail and
commercial banking.  The OFT said it welcomed the commission’s findings. It will
work with the Financial Conduct Authority and the Prudential
Regulation Authority, as well as the Bank of  England , and has
invited comments from small businesses.  To contact the reporter on this story:
