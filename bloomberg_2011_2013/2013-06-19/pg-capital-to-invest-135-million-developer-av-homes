TPG Capital, the private-equity firm
founded by  David Bonderman  and  James Coulter , agreed to invest
$135 million in  AV Homes Inc. (AVHI)  and take a more than 40 percent
stake in the developer.  TPG will make the investment at $14.65 a share, Scottsdale,
Arizona-based AV Homes said today in a statement. The  stock 
closed yesterday at $14.54. At the deal’s completion, AV Homes
will issue about 2.6 million common shares and 0.7 million
shares of newly created preferred stock, resulting in TPG owning
41.9 percent of the  company .  AV Homes today  jumped  21 percent to $17.53, the biggest
increase since December 2008. The stock had gained 2.3 percent
this year through yesterday.  U.S. developers are expanding as the housing  market 
recovers from a more than half-decade slump. AV Homes, which
builds communities in  Arizona  and Florida for people 55 and
older, said it will use the proceeds from the investment to
accelerate growth in current markets and enter new areas.  AV Homes “is well-positioned to participate in the ongoing
recovery of the housing market, with real estate assets located
in two healthy and growing Sunbelt markets,” Kelvin Davis, a
senior partner at TPG, said in the statement.  TPG, which previously invested in homebuilder  Taylor
Morrison Home Corp. (TMHC) , will have two of eight spots on AV Homes’s
 board  at the deal’s completion. That will increase to four of 10
seats upon shareholder approval, the companies said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
