The  Federal Reserve  may “moderate”
its pace of bond purchases later this year and may end them
around mid-2014, Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said.  “If the incoming data are broadly consistent with this
forecast, the committee currently anticipates that it would be
appropriate to moderate the pace of purchases later this year,”
Bernanke said at a press conference in Washington. “And if the
subsequent data remain broadly aligned with our current
expectations for the economy, we will continue to reduce the
pace of purchases in measured steps through the first half of
next year, ending purchases around mid-year.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
