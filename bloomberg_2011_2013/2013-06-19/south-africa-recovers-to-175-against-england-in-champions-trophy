Jonathan Trott hit an unbeaten 82
off 84 balls as  England  beat South Africa by seven wickets to
reach the Champions Trophy final as its seeks a first global
title in cricket’s 50-over format.  Joe Root added 48, joining Trott in a 105-run third-wicket
stand that helped lift England to 179-3 in the 38th over to pass
South Africa’s 175 all out yesterday at the Oval in London.
Man of the match James Tredwell earlier led the host nation’s
bowlers with 3-19, while James Anderson took 2-14.  “That’s the performance you want in a semifinal,” England
captain Alastair Cook said at the post-match presentation
ceremony. “To win any tournament you need everyone to fire and
we’ve got that so far.”  England, the Champions Trophy runner-up in 2004, will meet
the winner of today’s second semifinal between  India  and Sri
Lanka in the June 23 championship match of the eight-nation
International Cricket Council event.  Top-ranked South Africa, which was sent in to bat
yesterday, slumped to 80-8 before David Miller (56 not out) and
Rory Kleinveldt (43) more than doubled the total with a ninth-wicket stand of 95.  Stuart Broad then dismissed Kleinveldt and Lonwabo Tsotsobe
with consecutive balls, both caught behind, to end the innings
with more than 11 overs to spare.  The Proteas had lost opening batsmen Colin Ingram and
Hashim Amla within the first two overs. Wickets continued to
fall with only Robin Peterson (30) and Faf du Plessis (26)
making any impression. Broad finished with 3-50.  “We tried everything with the ball but it got pretty flat
in the afternoon,” South Africa captain AB de Villiers said.
“There are no excuses. We had the talent to win this
tournament, we just didn’t play well enough.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
