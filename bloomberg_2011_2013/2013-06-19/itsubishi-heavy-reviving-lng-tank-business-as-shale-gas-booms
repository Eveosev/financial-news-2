Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Ltd. (7011) ,
with products including ships, nuclear plants and air
conditioners, has revived its business of making liquefied
natural gas tanks amid the shale-gas boom in  North America .  Mitsubishi Heavy, which suspended the LNG tank business
after last delivering storage units in 2009, wants to win at
least one order every two years to supply the containers at
receiving terminals, Nobuyuki Nishioka, general manager of the
company’s new LNG project management department, said in an June
17 interview.  Asian countries led by China and India are seeking LNG
supplies from North America, where a boom in shale gas output
has lowered prices. More than 30 countries have  plans  to build
or expand LNG import capacity, according to Ernst & Young LLP.  Mitsubishi Heavy has supplied 53 LNG storage tanks,
including those for  Cheniere Energy Inc. (LNG) ’s Sabine Pass project
in  Louisiana  and Sempra LNG’s terminal in Mexico, Nishioka said.
Some customers have indicated they would buy tanks from
Mitsubishi if they expand their existing terminals, he said.  Mitsubishi Heavy also wants a contract every two years to
build a terminal capable of handling 4 million to 5 million
metric tons a year, Nishioka said. Each contract is valued from
40 billion yen ($421 million) to 50 billion yen, he said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
