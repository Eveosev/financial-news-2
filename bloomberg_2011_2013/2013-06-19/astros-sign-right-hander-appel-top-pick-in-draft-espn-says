The Houston Astros signed right-handed pitcher Mark Appel, the top pick in the Major League
Baseball draft this month, ESPN reported.  Appel, 21, was 10-4 with a 2.12 earned-run average in his
senior season at  Stanford University . He recorded four complete
games and had 130 strikeouts in 106 1/3 innings.  The ESPN report didn’t mention financial details of the
agreement. Astros spokesman Gene Dias didn’t immediately respond
to an e-mail seeking comment.  The Astros (27-45) joined the American League this season
after 51 years in the National League. They have the fewest wins
in the AL after recording baseball’s worst record in each of the
past two seasons.  Appel was drafted last year by the Pittsburgh Pirates with
the No. 8 selection, turning down a $3.8 million offer to return
to Stanford instead, according to ESPN.  To contact the reporters on this story:
