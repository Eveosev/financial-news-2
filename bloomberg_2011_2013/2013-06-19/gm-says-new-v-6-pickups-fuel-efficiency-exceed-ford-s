General Motors Co. (GM) , introducing
redesigned full-sized pickups this year, said new Chevrolet
Silverado and GMC Sierra base engines will exceed the fuel
economy of  Ford Motor Co. (F) ’s F-Series.  The 2014 non-turbo, two-wheel-drive 4.3-liter EcoTec3 V-6
versions of Silverado and Sierra will get an estimated 18 miles
(29 kilometers) per gallon in city driving and 24 mpg on the
highway, GM said in e-mailed statements today. Combined driving
gets an estimated 20 mpg.  Ford’s 2013 F-150 two-wheel-drive, flex-fuel, 3.7-liter V-6
gets 17 mpg in the city and 23 on the highway with a combined
19, according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s
 website . The website didn’t have 2014 model ratings for the
F-150.  GM’s revamped pickups are part of the Detroit-based
automaker’s 18 new products being introduced this year in the
U.S. to boost sales, market share and profit. The company has
generated 13 quarters of net income while shares reached a two-year high earlier this month. The automaker also returned to the
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index after its 2009 U.S.-backed
bankruptcy.  “Reflecting Silverado’s straightforward approach to
performance and fuel economy, these EPA estimates are achieved
without expensive add-ons and apply to all three cab
configurations, regular cab, double cab, and crew cab,” GM said
in a statement.  GM said its V-6 pickups will be able to tow more with a
maximum available payload rating of 2,108 pounds (956 kilograms)
and towing rating of 7,200 pounds.  The automaker has already announced that its 5.3-liter  V-8
engine pickups with two-wheel drive with 23 mpg in highway
driving get better  fuel efficiency  than Ford’s turbocharged
V-6’s 22 and the same as the entry V-6’s 23 mpg.  GM fell 1 percent to $33.66 at the close in  New York . The
shares have gained 17 percent this year, compared with a 14
percent increase for the  S&P 500 .  To contact the reporter on this story:
