Andy Schleck, the 2010 Tour de
 France  winner, will return for cycling’s biggest race after
sitting out the last edition because of a pelvis injury.  The 28-year-old will lead the RadioShack Leopard Trek team
at cycling’s most prestigious event, with support from riders
including Hamair Zubeldia and Jens Voigt, the team said today in
an e-mailed statement. The race starts June 29 in Corsica.  Schleck of Luxembourg is a three-time runner-up who
inherited the 2010 title when Alberto Contador failed a drugs
test. After being beset by injuries over the last year, it would
be “unrealistic” to expect him to win another podium place
this time, RadioShack Leopard Trek general manager Luca
Guercilena said in the statement.  “On the other hand, the lack of stress and pressure can be
a positive stimulus to a brilliant performance,”     Guercilena
said.  Schleck’s older brother, Frank, is serving a one-year ban
for doping after testing positive at the 2012 Tour de France
while racing with the same RadioShack Leopard team.  To contact the reporters on this story:
