The pound was little changed against
the dollar and the euro after the minutes of the  Bank of
England â€™s most recent policy meeting showed officials voted 6-3
to keep the target for bond purchases unchanged.  Sterling was 0.1 percent lower at $1.5628 as of 9:37 a.m.
London time, and was at 85.70 pence per euro, from 85.62 pence
yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
