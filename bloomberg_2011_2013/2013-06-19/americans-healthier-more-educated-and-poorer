After a decade of shrinking incomes, here’s a consoling thought: Doing better means more than just bringing home a bigger paycheck. A study released today shows that while Americans have been earning less they’ve also been living longer and learning more. With its new report  Measure of America 2013-2014 , the Social Science Research Council tries to capture these broader measures of U.S. well-being in a “human development index.” The idea for such an index was developed in 1990 by Pakistani economist Mahbub ul Haq as an alternative to the much-cited gross domestic product. Conventional measures are “not paying enough attention to data about ordinary people,” says study co-author Sarah Burd-Sharps. The project, begun in 2007, calculates a human development index score based on three factors -- wealth, health and education. Healthy, Less Wealthy & Wise Wealth is measured by looking at median earnings, which fell $2,185 per person over the last decade, adjusting for inflation, to $28,899. Health, as measured by longevity, improved quite a bit. U.S. life expectancy at birth rose 1.9 years to 78.9 years from 2000 to 2010 -- an extra 2.3 months in lifespan for every year that passed. The final factor, education, looks at school enrollment and how many people earned educational degrees. Both rose; the proportion of Americans with a high school diploma jumping 5.2 percentage points to 85.6 percent. The combination of falling earnings, longer lives and more education means the human development index for the U.S. inched up to 5.03, from 4.76 in 2000. The real value of the study is the way the data can be sorted by ethnic group, geographic region or other factors. Here are some other findings: New Questions The study’s authors admit many of the trends found in the data raise more questions than answers. It’s clear that lower smoking rates and greater seatbelt use are improving longevity, but why did African-Americans see life expectancy improve more than any other ethnic group? They lived three years longer in 2010 than in 2000, though they still live 4.3 years less than average. Native Americans were the only group whose lifespans didn’t increase. These data give policymakers and philanthropists an idea of where to direct resources, revealing where people are falling behind and which groups are doing better, at least in theory. Says study co-author Kristen Lewis: “You can’t fix a problem if you don’t know you have it.”  An  interactive map  on the Measure of America website allows users to crunch the data themselves.
