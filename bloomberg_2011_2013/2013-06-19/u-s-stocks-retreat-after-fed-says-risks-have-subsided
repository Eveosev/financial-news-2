U.S. stocks retreated as the  Federal
Reserve  said risks to the economy have decreased, spurring
concern the central bank will reduce its stimulus efforts.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index lost 0.4 percent to
1,644.63 at 2:04 p.m. in New York even as the Fed said it will
keep buying bonds at a pace of $85 billion a month.  Risks to the outlook for the economy and the labor market
have “diminished since the fall,” the  Federal Open Market
Committee  said today at the conclusion of a two-day meeting in
 Washington . It repeated that it’s prepared to increase or reduce
the pace of purchases depending on the outlook for the job
market and inflation.  The Fed’s record low interest rates and bond purchases have
helped fuel a rally in stocks that lifted the  S&P 500  as much as
 147 percent  from its bear-market low in 2009.  The quantitative easing program suppressed interest rates,
with the yield on the 10-year  Treasury note  reaching a record
low of 1.39 percent in July and remaining below the S&P 500’s
dividend yield for most of 2012 and 2013. The benchmark note’s
average rate over the past year has been 1.78 percent, compared
with an average of more than 6.5 percent in Bloomberg data
starting in 1962.  The S&P 500 last set a record of 1,669.16 on May 21, the
day before Fed Chairman Bernanke told Congress the central bank
could begin to reduce the pace of asset purchases if the job
market shows signs of sustainable improvement. Ten-year Treasury
yields topped 2 percent that day for the first time since March.  Tame Inflation  The lowest rate of inflation since the brink of the
Kennedy-era economic boom in the 1960s bought time for the Fed
to press on with the central bank’s $85 billion in monthly bond
purchases.  A gauge of consumer prices excluding food and energy that
is watched by the Fed rose 1.1 percent in the year through
April, matching the smallest gain since records started in 1960.
With inflation below the Fed’s 2 percent long-run goal and the
jobless rate at 7.6 percent, the Fed is falling short of its
mandate to ensure stable prices and maximum employment.  The Fed will probably wait to taper bond buying until its
Oct. 29-30 meeting, when it will cut its monthly purchases to
$65 billion, according to the median estimate in a June 4-5
Bloomberg survey of 59 economists. By then, inflation will be
rising toward the Fed’s target, accelerating to 1.3 percent in
the third quarter and 1.5 percent in the fourth quarter,
according to economists’ estimates.  Fed Rallies  While the end of Fed stimulus has preceded stock gains over
the past two decades, those rallies usually followed periods of
market weakness. The S&P 500’s 87 percent advance since the rate
on overnight loans between banks was pushed to zero in December
2008 is more than five times the average advance in periods
following monetary easing, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  The S&P 500, down 1 percent through yesterday from its May
21 record, has increased an average of 16 percent over two years
the last four times the central bank started raising  interest
rates , according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Stock market
volatility has been higher this year than during past periods
when the Fed reversed policy. Daily moves for the S&P 500 have
averaged almost 0.7 percent since March, compared with 0.44
percent in the month before the Fed tightened in 1994 and 2004.  Fed Model  U.S. stock investors may reap unusually high returns during
the next five years thanks to interest rates on  government
bonds , according to a May 8 report from the Fed Bank of New
York. Equities are inexpensive compared to government debt,
according to the so-called Fed Model, which compares the
earnings yield for stocks with Treasury rates. The valuation
measure was derived from a July 1997 report from the central
bank.  Per-share profit  of $102.37 for all S&P 500 companies
represents 6.2 percent of the index’s price level, or 4
percentage points more than yields on 10-year Treasury notes,
according to Fed Model data compiled by Bloomberg. That compares
with an average spread of 0.21 percentage points since 1990.  To contact the reporter on this story:
