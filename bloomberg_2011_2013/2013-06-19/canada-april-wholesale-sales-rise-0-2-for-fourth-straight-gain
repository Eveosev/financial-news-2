Canadian  wholesale sales  rose for a
fourth month in April, the longest streak of gains in a year,
led by computer and communications supplies.  Receipts rose 0.2 percent to C$49.0 billion ($48.0
billion), Statistics Canada said today in Ottawa, after a
revised 0.1 percent gain in March. Economists surveyed by
 Bloomberg News  forecast sales would climb 0.3 percent, the
median of 15 responses, from an initially reported 0.3 percent
gain in March.  Wholesalers have been seeking to recoup losses at the end
of last year when the country’s economy grew at its slowest pace
since the 2009 recession. While growing 1 percent since
December, sales are still down 1.2 percent from a year earlier,
the agency said today.  In volume terms, wholesale sales were up 0.4 percent in
April.  Wholesalers of computer and communications equipment
recorded a 10.4 percent gain in sales in April, helping to drive
a 2.6 percent gain in the machinery and equipment component,
Statistics Canada said. Sales of personal and household goods
rose 1.6 percent during the month, led by higher sales of
pharmaceuticals.  Sales of motor vehicles and car parts led declines with a
1.9 percent drop in April.  Four of the seven industry components of the measure
recorded declines.  In a separate report,  Statistics Canada  said the country’s
net foreign debt declined C$70.8 billion in the first quarter to
C$231.3 billion as the value of Canadian holdings of foreign
equity rose during the period.  To contact the editors responsible for this story:
