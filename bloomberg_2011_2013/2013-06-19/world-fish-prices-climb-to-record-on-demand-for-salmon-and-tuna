Global fish prices rose to a record
in May on rising demand for salmon and falling supplies of tuna,
according to the UN’s Food & Agriculture Organization.  An index of fish prices tracked by the Rome-based United
Nations agency rose to 168 points in May, advancing 6.3 percent
from April and up 16 percent from a year ago, data published in
the FAO’s biannual Food Outlook  report  last week show.  Prices for farmed fish such as salmon rose faster than
those from capture fisheries in the past year, the FAO data
show. Aquaculture production is predicted to climb 5.6 percent
in 2013, while capture of wild fish may rise 0.9 percent.  “Strong salmon demand despite rising salmon prices implies
a structural shift in consumer demand, which is positive for
salmon producers,” the FAO wrote in the outlook. “Despite
record high prices, demand for tuna remains strong.”  Total fish production is forecast to climb 2.9 percent to
161.2 million metric tons this year from 156.7 million tons,
with aquaculture output climbing to 70.2 million tons from 66.5
million tons. The value of fish exports is predicted to climb 2
percent to $130.8 billion this year after rising 0.5 percent to
$128.2 billion in 2012.  “The lingering economic crisis in the major seafood
importing markets of northern  Europe  and  North America  has
contributed to generally sluggish growth in seafood imports,”
the FAO wrote. “Demand for specific products has remained
strong, namely salmon and tuna.”  The FAO’s index of salmon prices jumped to 195 points in
May from 186 in April, surging from 156 in May 2012. The gage
for the cost of tuna stood at 221 points, unchanged from the
previous month and up from 198 in the year-earlier period.  Canned Fish  Tuna supplies to Asian canners are down this year, lifting
prices for the canned fish.  Japan ’s market for sashimi tuna was
“firm” at the start of 2013, while the U.S. market for
uncanned tuna was stable in the face of prices of $2,000 a ton.  “Evidence shows that the record high tuna prices are not
hindering import demand in the major markets,” the FAO wrote.
“Canned tune prices are expected to remain stable in the face
of low supply relative to demand.”  World production of farmed salmon is expected to be little
changed this year at 2.01 million tons, with output down 2.3
percent to 1.05 million tons in  Norway , the largest producer.  Global food consumption of fish is forecast to rise to 19.7
kilograms per capita this year from 19.2 kilograms in 2012,
mainly as consumers eat more farmed fish, according to the Food
Outlook report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
