The pound snapped a two-day decline
against the euro before the  Bank of England  releases minutes of
its June 5-6 policy meeting, Governor  Mervyn King ’s last before
 Mark Carney  takes over on July 1.  Sterling was little changed against the dollar as investors
awaited the end of the  Federal Reserve ’s two-day policy meeting
that may signal when the U.S. central bank will slow its bond-buying program. The Bank of England kept its  target  for asset
purchases at 375 billion pounds ($587 billion) this month. King
and two other policy makers were outvoted in May as the nine-member Monetary Policy Committee decided against boosting
stimulus.  “If the majority against quantitative easing becomes more
pronounced, that could be beneficial for sterling,” said  Jeremy Stretch , head of currency strategy at Canadian Imperial Bank of
Commerce. “If there were to be a switcher or more, that would
potentially provide a bit of lift temporarily.”  The pound was little changed at 85.61 pence per euro at
9:27 a.m. in London after depreciating yesterday to 85.85 pence,
the weakest since May 30. Sterling traded at $1.5653 after
slipping to $1.5566 yesterday, the lowest since June 11.  Fed Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  will hold a press conference
today in Washington after policy makers end their meeting.
Bernanke said last month the central bank could reduce its $85
billion in monthly bond purchases if there’s sustainable
improvement in employment.  Pound Advances  The pound has strengthened 3.3 percent in the past three
months, the best performer after the euro among 10 developed-market currencies tracked by Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted
Indexes. Europe’s common currency gained 3.7 percent, while the
dollar fell 0.7 percent.  U.K. government bonds rose, with the 10-year gilt yield
falling two basis points, or 0.02 percentage point, to 2.12
percent. The 1.75 percent security due in September 2022 rose
0.17, or 1.70 pounds per 1,000-pound face amount, to 96.94. Two-year rates decreased one basis point to 0.44 percent.  Gilts handed investors a loss of 1.8 percent this year
through yesterday, according to Bloomberg World Bond Indexes.
German bonds dropped 1 percent and Treasuries declined 1.1
percent, the indexes show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
