An Egyptian who slapped a woman
after she confronted him over his sexual harassment was
sentenced in absentia to three months in prison, in a test case
for the North African country.  Lyla El-Gueretly, a 30-year-old school teacher, arrived at
the Abdeen Court in Cairo early today and was allowed briefly
inside before the judge asked her to leave for deliberations.  “I’m a bit annoyed that he didn’t get the maximum two year
prison sentence, and that he didn’t show up,” El-Gueretly said
in a cafe near the court in downtown Cairo where she waited for
her lawyer to phone with the ruling. “But I’m also happy he got
a prison verdict.” The defendant, Ahmed Mohamed Mahmoud Yousef,
40, may appeal. He faced charges of assaulting and hitting a
woman in public or a 200 Egyptian pound ($28) fine.  El-Gueretly said she was walking along a bridge in Cairo in
April as Yousef passed by on a bus, called her a whore and made
sexual gestures with his mouth. After she scolded him for
behaving badly in spite of the beard he wore in an apparent show
of religiousness, he jumped off and began slapping her across
the face, she said.  Women’s rights activists see the case as setting a
precedent for the handling of rampant sexual harassment in
 Egypt , which largely goes unreported to police and where few
cases get transfered to court. Yousef got two months jail for
hitting El-Gueretly and a month for assaulting a woman in
public.  “I didn’t have any faith in the legal system,” the school
teacher said, “so this isn’t bad for a start.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
