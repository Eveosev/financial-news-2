Nomura Holdings Inc. (8604) , Japan’s
biggest brokerage, plans “some redundancies” in its Australian
equities business in line with its global strategy, according to
a memo obtained by  Bloomberg News .  The changes are part of the Tokyo-based firm’s global
alignment of its equities and Instinet businesses, according to
the memo sent by Australia Chief Executive Officer Hiroyuki Nishikawa.  Rob Stewart , a Hong Kong-based spokesman for the
company, confirmed the contents of the document.  Nomura said last year that it’s reorganizing its equities
division, with execution services outside of Japan to be wrapped
into Instinet, the brokerage it acquired in 2006. In Australia,
the bank continues to cover more than 60 percent of the stock
market by market capitalization, the memo showed today.  The changes are understood to mean local equities head
Andrew Norman and  capital markets  chief Mark Bartels are
stepping down, the Australian Financial Review reported.  Nomura named Jon Linton as head of global markets for
Australia, including equities, according to the memo. Linton was
previously head of macro products for the country.  To contact the reporter on this story:
