The number of gasoline cargoes
booked for shipment to the U.S. from  Europe  will decline over
the next two weeks, a Bloomberg News survey showed.  Traders will charter a total of 17 Medium Range tankers for
loading to July 2, the median in a survey yesterday and today of
six shipbrokers and traders showed. That compares with 21
vessels, each normally carrying 37,000 metric tons of the auto
fuel, in a corresponding survey last week. There are 29 ships
available for the trade, one more than last week.  Tankers plying the trans-Atlantic route were earning $7,354
daily as of yesterday, the lowest since Nov. 26, according to
the  Baltic Exchange  in  London .  Eleven of the 17 charters have been completed and the rest
are anticipated, the latest survey showed. Ship bookings often
contain clauses allowing vessels to sail to different ports.  The survey is based on the industryâ€™s benchmark Rotterdam-to-New York voyage, which takes about 11 days at 12.5 knots,
according to the sea-distances.com website. Below is a table of
ships chartered, probably hired and available to be booked for
the journey loading over the two-week periods from the dates
shown.  *T                             June 18     June 11      Change
