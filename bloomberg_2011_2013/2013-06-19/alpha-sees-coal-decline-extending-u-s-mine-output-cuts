Declining metallurgical-coal prices,
which are seen hitting a three-year low amid rising Australian
exports to China, will lead U.S. producers to shut more mines,
according to  Alpha Natural Resources Inc. (ANR)   “I wouldn’t be a bit surprised if we looked at changes in
the back half of the year,” Alpha Chairman and Chief Executive
Officer Kevin Crutchfield said in an interview yesterday at
Bloomberg’s New York headquarters. “It’s going to affect
everyone.”  Alpha, the country’s biggest supplier of the steelmaking
ingredient, boosted its metallurgical-coal output in 2011 when
it acquired Massey Energy Co. for $6.67 billion. Since then it
has cut about half of its production in the central Appalachian
region, Crutchfield said in February.  Earlier this month, the Bristol, Virginia-based company
announced the closing of an unprofitable West Virginia mine. In
September, Alpha said it would shut eight mines, cutting 16
million tons of output. The company also produces thermal coal,
the price of which has declined amid mild weather and as some
power utilities switch to natural gas.  The metallurgical-coal benchmark contract for the third
quarter may be settled at $153 a ton, according to the average
of three analysts’ estimates compiled by Bloomberg. That would
be the lowest quarterly price since the first quarter of 2010,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Alpha plans to ship 81 million to 92 million tons of coal
this year, including 19 million to 22 million tons of
metallurgical coal, which typically fetches a higher price than
thermal.  To contact the reporter on this story:
