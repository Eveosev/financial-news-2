Portugal ’s cost of borrowing for 18
months climbed to the highest level since January as the nation
sold a combined 1.5 billion euros ($2.01 billion) of bills.  The country auctioned 1.05 billion euros of securities due
in December 2014 at an average yield of 1.603 percent, the debt
management agency said. That compares with an average of 1.506
percent at the previous sale of 18-month bills on March 20 and
was the highest since Jan. 16. Investors submitted bids for 2.1
times the amount offered, unchanged from March.  Portugal also sold 450 million euros of six-month bills at
an average yield of 1.041 percent, up from 0.811 percent at a
previous auction on May 15 and the most since Nov. 21.  “It’s true that rates increased but it’s not an alarming
rise,” Filipe Silva, director of asset management at Banco
Carregosa SA in Oporto, northern Portugal, wrote in an e-mailed
research note.  The nation sold  10-year (GSPT10YR)  bonds on May 7 for the first time
in more than two years as a decline in  interest rates  worldwide
spurred demand for higher-yielding assets. It stopped selling
bonds until this year after requesting a 78 billion-euro bailout
from the European Union and  International Monetary Fund  in April
2011 following a surge in debt levels and borrowing costs.  Spread Widens  The yield on Portugal’s benchmark 10-year yield dropped one
basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 6.10 percent as of
1:55 p.m. in  London  after rising to 6.65 percent on June 11, the
highest level since Feb. 26. The two-year yield fell 10 basis
points to 3.29 percent.  The  extra yield  that investors demand to hold the nation’s
10-year securities instead of similar-maturity German bunds
widened two basis points to 4.56 percentage points after
shrinking to 3.77 percentage points on May 22, the narrowest
since February 2011.  Portugal pays an average interest rate on its aid loans of
3.25 percent, Prime Minister  Pedro Passos Coelho  said on May 10.
The country’s debt is ranked below investment grade by  Fitch
Ratings , Moody’s Investors Service and  Standard & Poor’s .  The IGCP, as the debt agency is known, said on June 14 the
total indicative amount for today’s auctions would be between
1.25 billion euros and 1.5 billion euros.  Portugal is already starting to raise financing for next
year and has completed its borrowing needs for 2013, Finance
Minister Vitor Gaspar said on May 7.  To contact the reporter on this story:
