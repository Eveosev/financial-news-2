South African spending rebounded in
the first three months of the year as the government boosted
expenditure.  Gross domestic demand, which includes consumer, government
and investments, expanded 3.5 percent in the first quarter
compared with a 0.9 percent contraction in the last three months
of 2012, the  Reserve Bank  said in its Quarterly Bulletin
released in Pretoria today.  Sagging investment in the mining and manufacturing
industries and slowing  consumer spending  may mute the impact of
a rebound in overall expenditure. The  economy  expanded at an
annualized 0.9 percent in the first quarter, the slowest pace
since the 2009 recession. Consumer spending, which accounts for
about 60 percent of total expenditure, continues to face
pressure because of inflation, the central bank said.  “The household sector increasingly experienced higher
levels of financial stress, exacerbated by rising inflation and
slower growth,” the central bank said. “If the slower pace of
 capital spending  were to continue, it could reduce the long-term
potential of the economy and cause capacity constraints to
develop and inflationary pressures to escalate.”  Government spending  expanded 3 percent compared with a 0.7
percent contraction in the fourth quarter, while consumer
spending rose 2.3 percent in the first quarter from 2.4 percent,
the central bank said. Gross fixed-capital formation slowed to
2.5 percent from 4.3 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
