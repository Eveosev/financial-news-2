FlyDubai, the state-owned budget
carrier, will begin offering business class services on some
routes starting in October, it said in an e-mailed statement
today.  Business seats will be offered for sale in August, with
the first aircraft fitted with the new berths due to arrive the
same month. All planes delivered subsequently will feature the
two-class layout.  Low-cost airlines usually only offer economy services to
keep expenditure at a minimum and FlyDubaiâ€™s decision to sell
the new seating and services was based on passenger feedback, it
said. The business class cabin will have leather seats, in-flight entertainment and premium catering while on-ground
services will include priority check-in and lounge access.  FlyDubai, which began operations in 2009, operates to 60
destinations across the Middle East,  Africa , Indian
Subcontinent, Asia and Central and Eastern Europe.  To contact the reporter on this story:
