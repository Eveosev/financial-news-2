A Spanish court annulled a decision
to re-open a probe into a loan made by Miguel Blesa, the former
chairman of savings bank Caja  Madrid .  The Provincial Court of Madrid overturned the decision last
June by the Judge Elpidio-Jose Silva to re-open an investigation
into the loan granted by Caja Madrid to Gerardo Diaz Ferran, a
former head of the Spanish business lobby who was also a board
member of the lender, the court said today in a ruling.  Today’s judgment also affects “other actions” deriving
from the probe into the 26.6 million-euro ($35.6 million) loan,
the court said, without specifying what those were. Silva sent
Blesa, 65, to jail on June 5 as he continues a probe into losses
resulting from Caja Madrid’s 2008 purchase of a bank in  Florida .  In its ruling, the Provincial Court said that the loan
probe had “become a ‘general’ cause to seek those responsible -
- it seems Miguel Blesa de la Parra and Gerardo Diaz Ferran --
for the economic crisis we are going through and their
punishment.”  Caja Madrid was merged with Bancaja and five other savings
banks in 2010 to form  Bankia. (BKIA)  The banking group needed a 22
billion-euro rescue last year that led Spain to seek bailout
funds from Europe to salvage the industry.  To contact the reporter on this story:
