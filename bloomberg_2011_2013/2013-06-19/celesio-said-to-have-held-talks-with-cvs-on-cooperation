Celesio AG (CLS1) , a pharmaceutical
retailer, and  CVS Caremark Corp. (CVS)  have held talks on a possible
collaboration, including purchasing pacts, according to people
familiar with the situation.  It’s too early to say what the outcome of the talks may be
and which direction they make take, according to one person.  Manager Magazin reported earlier today that CVS Caremark is
prepared to buy Franz Haniel & Cie GmbH’s 50.01 percent stake in
Stuttgart, Germany-based Celesio. Markus Pinger, Celesio’s chief
executive officer, has been in talks with Woonsocket, Rhode
Island-based CVS for some time, the magazine reported, citing
unidentified people close to the industry.  CVS would be willing to pay as much as 2 billion euros
($2.7 billion) for the Haniel stake, the report said.  “There have been talks, but not about a sale,” Haniel
spokesman Dietmar Bochert said in a telephone interview today.  Celesio spokesman Rainer Berghausen said in a telephone
interview that only Haniel can decide on the sale of the stake.
 Carolyn Castel , a spokeswoman for CVS, declined to comment.  Pinger met Haniel Chief Executive Officer Stephan Gemkow on
June 12 to talk about the modalities of a possible deal, the
magazine said.  Celesio shares rose 11 percent to 17.89 euros in  Frankfurt 
today, the  highest  price in more than two years, giving the
company a market value of about 3 billion euros. It was the
biggest gain since at least 1996.  To contact the reporter on this story:
