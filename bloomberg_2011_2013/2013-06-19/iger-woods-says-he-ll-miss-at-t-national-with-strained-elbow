Tiger Woods said he has a strained
left elbow that will keep him from playing in the AT&T National
next week.  The world’s top-ranked golfer said on his website that he
was examined by doctors after returning home from last week’s
U.S. Open, where he was seen shaking his left arm in pain after
some shots.  The AT&T National, an annual stop on the U.S. PGA Tour, is
scheduled for Congressional Country Club in Bethesda,  Maryland ,
June 27-30.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
