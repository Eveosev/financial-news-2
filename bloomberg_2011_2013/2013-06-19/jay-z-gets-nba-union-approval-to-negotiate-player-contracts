Jay-Z, the entertainer who started
an athlete-representation firm in April, has been certified by
the National Basketball Association and Major League Baseball
players’ unions to negotiate contracts.  Robert Gadson, director of security and agent
administration at the National Basketball Player’s Association,
and MLB Players Association spokesman  Greg Bouris  said the
certifications had been granted.  Jay-Z, whose real name is  Shawn Carter , met with Ron Klempner, the NBPA’s acting executive director, and the
organization’s legal staff, Gadson said in an interview
yesterday.  Carter, an investor in the NBA’s Brooklyn Nets, has won 17
Grammy Awards and sold more than 33 million albums, according to
answers.com. Under NBA rules, Carter must sell his interest in
the team to represent players in contract talks.  Barry Baum, a spokesman for the Nets, referred questions on
Carter’s ownership interest to Jana Fleishman, a spokeswoman for
Jay-Z’s Roc Nation Sports. Fleishman didn’t immediately respond
to a voice mail or e-mail seeking comment on Jay-Z’s share of
the Nets.  Roc Nation’s clients include New York Yankees second
baseman  Robinson Cano  and New York Jets rookie quarterback Geno Smith.  Roc Nation operates in a partnership with  Creative Artists
Agency .  To contact the reporter on this story:
