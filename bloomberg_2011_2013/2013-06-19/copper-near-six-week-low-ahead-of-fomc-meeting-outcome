Copper traded near the lowest level
in six weeks as investors waited for the outcome of  Federal
Reserve ’s meeting tonight.  Metal for delivery in three months was little changed at
$7,011 a metric ton on the London Metal Exchange as of 9:39 a.m.
Shanghai time after falling to $6,965 yesterday, the lowest
since May 3.  Fed Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  indicated on May 22 that
stimulus aimed at bolstering the world’s largest economy could
be scaled back if the employment outlook shows “sustainable
improvement.” President  Barack Obama  said Fed Chairman Ben S.
Bernanke has stayed in his post “longer than he wanted,” one
of the clearest signals the central bank chief will leave when
his current term expires next year.  “Copper may come under further pressure if there’s any
hint of scaling back stimulus,” Xu Liping, an analyst at HNA
Topwin Futures Co., said by phone from Shanghai. “Tomorrow’s
China flash PMI may provide further clues.”  HSBC Holdings Plc and Markit Economics will release China’s
Preliminary  Purchasing Managers ’ Index for June tomorrow.  Copper for delivery in October fell 0.6 percent to 50,710
 yuan  ($8,271) a ton on the Shanghai Futures Exchange and the
September contract on the Comex in New York was little changed
at $3.172 per pound.  On the LME, lead and tin gained, while nickel fell.
Aluminum and zinc were little changed.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
