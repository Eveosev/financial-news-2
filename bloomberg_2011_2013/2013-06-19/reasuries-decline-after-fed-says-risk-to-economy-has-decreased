Treasuries fell after the  Federal
Reserve  said it will keep buying bonds at a pace of $85 billion
a month and said that risks to the economy have decreased.  Yields on benchmark 10-year notes rose for a third day as
the central bank said “the committee sees downside the risks to
the outlook for the economy and the labor market as having
diminished since the fall.” It repeated that it’s prepared to
increase or reduce the pace of purchases depending on the
outlook for the job market and inflation.  “The Fed’s let the genie out of the bottle,” Aaron Kohli,
an interest-rate strategist BNP Paribas SA in New York, one of
21 primary dealers that trade with the Fed, said before the
central bank released its statement. “It’s not QE forever.”  The yield on the 10-year note rose eight basis points, or
0.08 percentage point, to 2.26 percent at 2:05 p.m. in  New York ,
according to Bloomberg Bond Trader prices. The yield reached
2.29 percent on June 11, the highest since April 2012. It
touched 1.61 percent on May 1.  The Fed has been buying $45 billion of Treasuries and $40
billion of mortgage securities each month to put downward
pressure on borrowing costs in its third round of asset
purchases. It has kept its  target rate  for overnight lending
between banks at virtually zero since December 2008 to support
the economy.  Yield Forecasts  Benchmark 10-year note yields surged 55 basis points from
May 1 to yesterday as investors speculated the Fed would cut
back on stimulus. Bernanke told Congress’s Joint Economic
Committee on May 22 the Fed could begin slowing bond purchases
if it sees sustainable improvement in the labor market.  The 10-year Treasury yield will end 2013 at 2.35 percent,
according to the median forecast of 77 economists in a Bloomberg
News survey. That’s up from the 2.2 percent median forecast of a
similar survey in May.  Treasuries rallied after the Fed ended its two previous
rounds of asset purchases in March 2010 and June 2011. Ten-year
 yields (USGG10YR)  slid to 2.47 percent in August 2010 from 3.83 percent in
March 2010 on concern the economy faced the rising risk of
deflation after the central bank ended $1.7 trillion of bond
buying. The benchmark yields dropped to 1.92 percent in
September 2011 from 3.16 percent in June 2011, when a $600
billion purchase-program ended.  Job Growth  The Fed is short of the 6.5 percent  unemployment-rate 
threshold, with projected inflation below 2.5 percent, it said
would be necessary to reach before considering an increase in
the key interest-rate target.  While U.S. nonfarm payrolls swelled by 175,000 jobs in May,
more than economists forecast in a Bloomberg survey, the jobless
rate unexpectedly rose to 7.6 percent as more people entered the
workforce. It had been 7.5 percent, the lowest level since
December 2008.  Inflation has held below the central bank’s 2 percent
target. U.S. consumer prices increased 1.4 percent for the 12
months that ended in May, versus a 1.1 percent year-over-year
gain reported in April that was the lowest since 2010.  The yield  gap  between 10-year Treasuries and Treasury
Inflation Protected Securities, a gauge of traders’ expectations
for consumer prices over the life of the debt that’s called the
10-year break-even rate, reached a 17-month low this month. It
touched 2 percentage points on June 13, the lowest level since
January 2012, compared with an average of 2.38 percentage points
over the previous 12 months.  The Fed’s measure of traders’ forecasts for consumer prices
for the period from 2018 to 2023, the  five-year , five-year
forward break-even rate, dropped to 2.37 percent as of June 13,
the lowest since Dec. 19, 2011.  Purchase Goals  The gauge was one-quarter-percentage point below 2.63
percent, its level on Sept. 13. That was the day the Fed said it
would begin buying $40 billion a month of mortgage bonds “to
support a stronger economic recovery and to help ensure that
inflation, over time, is at the rate most consistent with its
dual mandate” of stable prices and full employment.  The central bank announced Dec. 12 it would increase asset
purchases by $45 billion a month in Treasuries and said the
buying would continue until the outlook for the labor market had
improved “substantially.”  President  Barack Obama  said Bernanke has stayed in his post
“longer than he wanted,” one of the clearest signals the Fed
chief will leave when his current term expires next year.  “ Ben Bernanke ’s done an outstanding job,” Obama said in
an interview this week with  Charlie Rose , when asked about
nominating him for another term subject to Senate approval.
“He’s already stayed a lot longer than he wanted or he was
supposed to.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
