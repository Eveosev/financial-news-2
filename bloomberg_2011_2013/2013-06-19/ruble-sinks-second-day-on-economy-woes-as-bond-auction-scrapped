The ruble slid for a second day on
weaker-than-forecast economic data as  Russia  canceled its second
bond sale this month and the central bank chairman warned
capital outflow remains “abnormally high.”  The ruble dropped 0.6 percent against the central bank’s
dollar-euro basket to 37.1181 by 6 p.m. in Moscow, nine kopeks
off the weakest level this year, reached June 11. The Russian
currency slid 0.6 percent against the dollar to 32.1975, making
it the worst performing emerging-market currency after
 Indonesia ’s rupiah among 24 tracked by Bloomberg.  The Finance Ministry scrapped a sale of 15-year ruble debt
today, citing a lack of bids. Russian industrial production
unexpectedly shrank 1.4 percent in May from a year earlier,
missing the median estimate for a 0.6 percent gain among 22
economists surveyed by Bloomberg, data showed yesterday. U.S.
Federal Reserve Chairman Ben S. Bernanke may shed more light on
when the Fed plans to trim its bond buying today.  “Industrial production was quite disappointing,” Vladimir Miklashevsky, an economist at  Danske Bank A/S (DANSKE) , said in e-mailed
comments.  The International Monetary Fund yesterday cut its growth
forecast for Russia to 2.5 percent this year and 3.25 percent in
2014, compared with April predictions of 3.4 percent and 3.8
percent, respectively. The Washington-based lender cautioned the
country against the danger of stoking inflation with fiscal
stimulus, urging policy makers to improve the business climate.  The drop in industrial production is of a “fundamental
nature,” ZAO Raiffeisenbank analysts wrote in an e-mailed note.  Capital Outflows  The ruble’s three-month volatility rose 33 basis points to
10.4475, compared with this year’s high of 11.1950 on June 7,
data compiled by Bloomberg show. The yield on benchmark ruble
bonds due 2027 fell three basis points, or 0.03 percentage
point, to 7.67 percent and an index of 20 emerging-market
currencies compiled by Bloomberg was little changed.  While Russian capital outflow sank to $54 billion in 2012
from $81 billion the year before, it remains high, central bank
Chairman Sergey Ignatiev said today in Moscow.  The Finance Ministry planned to sell 10 billion rubles
($311 million) of the 15-year bonds with guidance of 7.70
percent to 7.75 percent, according to statements this week. The
yield on the bond climbed two basis points to 7.84 percent
before the results were announced, extending a 13 basis point
increase yesterday. The ministry sold all 10 billion rubles of
the three-year notes it offered in a separate auction.  The central bank started buying rubles on May 29 to slow
its slide. Bank Rossii, which reports currency intervention data
with a delay,  spent  the equivalent of 2.21 billion rubles of
foreign currency on June 17. According to traders, the central
bank intervenes after a level of 35.65 rubles against the
basket.  To contact the reporter on this story:
