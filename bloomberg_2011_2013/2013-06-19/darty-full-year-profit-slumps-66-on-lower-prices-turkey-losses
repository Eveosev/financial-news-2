Darty Plc (DRTY) , the owner of  France ’s
largest consumer-electronics chain, said it expects another
challenging year after reporting annual profit declined as it
lowered prices and losses persisted in Turkey and Spain.  Adjusted pretax profit declined to 26.4 million euros ($35
million) in the year ended April 30, the retailer  said  today.
That compares with the 26.7 million-euro average estimate of
nine analysts compiled by Bloomberg. The retailer raised its
final dividend to 2.625 cents a share.  Darty, whose Chief Executive Officer Regis Schultz took
over in April, said he will improve profits by focusing on a
wider range of entry-priced products, an enhanced digital offer
with in-store click-and-collect points, more exclusive own-brand
ranges and will complete 50 million euros of annual cost savings
a year earlier than planned by fiscal 2015. The retailer sold
its Italian unit and closed its Spanish business in the past
financial year to curb losses.  “The year ahead will be challenging and we anticipate that
market conditions and product mix will continue to put pressure
on margins,” Schultz said in the statement. “We aim to
mitigate this through our cost saving programs.”  The  shares  fell 2.3 percent to 62.5 pence in London trading
yesterday. They have risen 9.7 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
