Treasury 10-year note yields stayed
in the tightest range in more than a month before Federal
Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  speaks following the conclusion
of a two-day policy meeting today.  Investors will be looking for signals as to when the
central bank may slow the pace of bond purchases, after data
yesterday showed inflation stayed below the Fed’s target and
housing starts trailed forecasts. The yield  gap  between 10-year
Treasuries and Treasury Inflation Protected Securities, a gauge
of traders’ expectations for consumer prices over the life of
the debt, was almost at a 17-month low. The U.S. is scheduled to
auction $7 billion in 30-year TIPS tomorrow.  “The Fed will probably remind the market of the economic
prerequisites needed for a reduction in bond purchases,” said
Kazuaki Oh’e, a debt salesman in  Tokyo  at CIBC World Markets
Japan Inc., a unit of  Canada ’s fifth-largest lender. “The 10-year yield looks quite comfortable a little above 2 percent, so
I doubt it will break below that.”  The benchmark  10-year yield  was little changed at 2.18
percent at 10:15 a.m. in Tokyo from yesterday, according to
Bloomberg Bond Trader prices. The price of the 1.75 percent
security maturing in May 2023 was at 96 5/32. Ten-year note
yields traded in a 4.88 basis-point  range  between 2.216 percent
and 2.1673 percent yesterday, the narrowest since May 9.  The 10-year  break-even  rate was at 2.09 percentage points
after touching 2 percentage points on June 13, the lowest level
since January 2012. The average over the past 12 months is 2.38
percentage points.  Fed Meeting  The Fed will release a statement and economic forecasts
when its meeting ends. Bernanke said in May the central bank
could reduce its $85 billion in monthly bond purchases, known as
quantitative easing, if there’s sustainable improvement in
employment. At the same time, he said a premature tightening of
monetary policy might imperil the economic recovery.  The central bank will trim its bond purchases to $65
billion a month at the Oct. 29-30 FOMC meeting, according to a
Bloomberg News survey of economists. The central bank will buy
up to $3.5 billion of Treasuries maturing in August 2020 to May
2023 tomorrow, the  website  of the Fed Bank of  New York  showed.  Data from the Commerce Department yesterday showed  housing
starts  rose 6.8 percent in May to a 914,000 annualized rate,
compared to 950,000 in the median estimate of economists polled
by Bloomberg.  Below Target  The Labor Department reported yesterday consumer prices
increased 1.4 percent in the 12 months ended in May, versus a
1.1 percent year-over-year gain reported in April. The Fed’s
inflation target is 2 percent.  Slow inflation gives the Fed room to maintain record
economic stimulus as policy makers seek to lower a jobless rate
of 7.6 percent.  Investors should buy U.S. 10-year notes as yields rise
toward 2.3 percent before the FOMC announcement,  William O’Donnell , head U.S. government-bond strategist at Royal Bank of
Scotland Group Plc’s RBS Securities unit in  Stamford ,
 Connecticut , a primary dealer, wrote in a note to clients.  Investors should not “be selling into weakness ahead of
the meeting on this most recent tapering fear,” O’Donnell
wrote. While the Fed “would like to begin the tapering
process,” it will probably go “no further than that in
advancing the conversation and if anything, being a bit dovish
away from that in order to soothe ruffled market feathers.”  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
