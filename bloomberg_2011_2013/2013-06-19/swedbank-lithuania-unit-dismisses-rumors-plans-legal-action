The Lithuanian unit of  Swedbank AB (SWEDA) 
told clients to ignore “rumors” about its business, saying
people spreading the false information were liable to
prosecution.  “Clients are receiving false messages calling into
question the continuity of the bank’s operations and spreading
baseless rumors” via social networks, mobile-phone messages and
e-mails, the Vilnius-based unit said on its website today. “The
bank intends to turn to legal institutions regarding this
spreading of false information.”  Similar speculation in neighboring  Latvia  in December 2011
sparked withdrawals by Swedbank clients equivalent to about 10
percent of that unit’s deposits, Diena newspaper reported at the
time, citing the Latvian banking regulator.  To contact the reporter on this story:
