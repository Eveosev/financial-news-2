Rates to ship iron ore rallied for a
10th day amid speculation traders are betting prices for the
commodity used to make steel will rebound as Chinese mills
replenish stockpiles.  Daily earnings for Capesizes hauling about 160,000 metric
tons rose 10 percent to $10,306, according to the  Baltic
Exchange , the London-based publisher of shipping costs. That’s
the highest since Dec. 10 and rates almost doubled since the
start of the month, figures show.  Traders are booking more cargoes as prices end a slump,
according to Ben Goggin, an iron-ore swaps broker at ICAP Plc in
 London . The benchmark price for the commodity at the Chinese
port of Tianjin rose 2 percent to $120 a dry metric ton today
after tumbling 24 percent since February, Steel Index Ltd. data
show. Stocks at Chinese ports rose 6.5 percent to 70.6 million
tons from a four-year low on March 8, according to Beijing
Antaike Information Development Co.  “There’s some restocking ahead for some Chinese mills,”
Goggin said by e-mail today. “Buyers may have jumped in and
bought all the cargoes in the expectation they will be able to
sell them at better prices in the coming weeks and that’s helped
increase  iron-ore  prices and freight rates.”  The Baltic Dry Index, a broader gauge of commodities
shipping costs, rose 3.4 percent to 995 today, the highest since
Dec. 5, according to the exchange. Daily earnings for Panamaxes
rose 1.9 percent to $7,240, and Supramaxes and Handysizes, the
smallest ship types tracked by the index, each gained less than
1 percent to $9,510 and $8,036, respectively, data show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
