Southern California spot wholesale
electricity fell as wind generation increased while transmission
bottlenecks limited flows to the north, where prices gained as
demand topped estimates.  Southern California wind output was 1,867 megawatts during
the hour ended at 1 p.m. local time, 14 percent higher than the
day-ahead outlook for the time, the California Independent
System Operator Inc.’s  website showed . The region’s power demand
was 0.4 percent below the forecast while the north topped
estimates by 2 percent.  The  discount  of SP15 in Southern California to NP15 in the
northern part of the state expanded to $20.15 a megawatt-hour at
1:19 p.m. local time from $1.76 yesterday, based on today’s on-peak average prices, grid data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Spot power at the  SP15 hub  fell $25.31, or 72 percent, to
$9.75 a megawatt-hour for the hour ended at 1 p.m. from the same
time yesterday. Prices at the  NP15 hub  fell $4.75, or 13
percent, to $32.53 for the same hour.  Electricity prices also gained in  Texas  as demand topped
forecasts while the Eastern grids dropped for a second day as
milder weather reduced the need to run air conditioners.  Houston power  increased $3.72, or 9.4 percent, to $43.26 a
megawatt-hour for the hour ended at 3 p.m. local time from a day
earlier.  Demand  on the main state grid operated by the Electric
Reliability Council of Texas Inc. was 58,600 megawatts at 2:34
p.m., 2.2 percent higher than the day-ahead outlook.  Temperatures will be below normal from the Northeast
through the mid-Atlantic states and the Midwest through the rest
of the week, according to WSI Corp. in Andover,  Massachusetts .  Spot electricity for New York City dropped $31.86, or 47
percent, to average $36.63 a megawatt-hour at 4 p.m. while
