UEFA, the governing body of European
soccer, banned Anzhi Makhachkala from hosting Europa League
matches in Dagestan and gave the club until the end of the month
to find a new site.  The Europa League is the continent’s second-tier soccer
competition, and was won by  London ’s Chelsea last season. UEFA’s
Emergency Panel met yesterday and decided to restrict its
competitive matches in the region of  Russia .  “The UEFA Emergency Panel came to this decision after
having carefully examined and evaluated the current security
situation in the North Caucasus and notably in Dagestan, and
taking into account the whole range of circumstances as well as
the warnings issued by various governments,” UEFA said today on
its website. “This decision remains in force for subsequent
seasons until further notice.”  Dagestan, the region where the brothers who bombed this
year’s Boston Marathon once lived, borders on the Caspian Sea,
Azerbaijan, Chechnya and  Georgia .  To contact the reporter on this story:
