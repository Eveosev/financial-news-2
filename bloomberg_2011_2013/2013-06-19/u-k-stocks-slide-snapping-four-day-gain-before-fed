U.K. stocks  declined, snapping four
days of gains, as investors awaited the outcome of a Federal
Reserve policy meeting for signals about when the central bank
will scale back stimulus measures.  BT Group Plc (BT/A)  slid 1.8 percent after saying Ian Livingston
will step down as chief executive officer.  Aggreko Plc (AGK)  fell 5.3
percent as UBS AG lowered its recommendation on the shares.
Berkeley Group Holdings Plc advanced 1.6 percent after saying
annual profit rose 33 percent.  The  FTSE 100 Index (UKX)  fell 25.39 points, or 0.4 percent, to
6,348.82 at the close in London. The equity benchmark has still
lost 7.2 percent  since  Fed Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said May 22
that the central bank could scale back stimulus if the  U.S.
economy  improves sustainably. The broader FTSE All-Share Index
retreated 0.3 percent today, while Ireland’s ISEQ Index gained
0.6 percent.  “The market is understandably thin, given the magnitude of
Fed news flow expected after European trading hours,” said Guy Foster, the London-based head of portfolio strategy at Brewin
Dolphin Securities Ltd., which oversees about $39 billion.
“We’re likely to see a bit of volatility in the markets. We’ve
already seen the last meaningful bits of data from the U.S. that
could influence the Fed’s decision, so now it’s a case of
waiting.”  The  Federal Open Market Committee  concludes a two-day
policy meeting today, with Bernanke scheduled to address the
press after European markets close.  CEO Change  BT dropped 1.8 percent to 313.7 pence after the U.K.’s
biggest fixed-line company said Gavin Patterson, head of its
retail division, will replace Livingston as CEO in September.
Livingston will join the U.K. government as Minister of State
for Trade and Investment, BT said in a statement.  Aggreko fell 5.3 percent to 1,660 pence for the worst
performance on the FTSE 100. UBS downgraded the provider of
mobile-power supplies to neutral from buy and lowered its
forecast for the company’s 2014 earnings, citing a weaker market
for power projects.  Evraz Plc slipped 1.7 percent to 115.3 pence after
Aktualne.cz said the steelmaker will stop production at its
Czech steel mill in July and part of August because of low
demand. The news website cited Roman Durca, a trade union
official.  Vodafone Offer  Vodafone Group Plc declined 1.6 percent to 181.45 pence
after people familiar with the matter said the U.K. carrier
raised its preliminary offer to buy Kabel Deutschland Holding AG
to about 7.5 billion euros, or 85 euros a share. The new
proposal follows a preliminary bid from Liberty Global Inc. this
week that was said to be valued at the same price.  Berkeley Group advanced 1.6 percent to 2,193 pence
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The U.K. homebuilder
said annual profit rose to 209.7 million pounds ($328 million).
Analysts had forecast 209 million pounds, according to the
average of three estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  A  gauge of retailers  in the FTSE 350 Index added 0.9
percent. Tesco Plc, the U.K.’s biggest supermarket chain, gained
2.6 percent to 344.6 pence. Greggs Plc climbed 1.9 percent to
418.8 pence and Home Retail Group Plc increased 2.9 percent to
133.7 pence.  To contact the reporter on this story:
