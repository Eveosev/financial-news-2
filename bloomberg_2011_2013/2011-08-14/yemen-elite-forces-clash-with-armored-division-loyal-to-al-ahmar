Yemen’s elite Republican Guard
forces loyal to President Ali Abdullah Saleh clashed today with
members of the defected First Armored Division, killing at least
one civilian, a local resident said.  The clashes took place in Shamlan in northwestern Sana’a,
the capital, Majed Mahyoub said in a telephone interview today.  It is the first time the Republican Guard has engaged in
direct confrontation with the First Armored Division since their
commander Ali Mohsen al-Ahmar defected in March to support anti-
government protests calling for Saleh’s resignation.  To contact the reporter on this story:
