Newcrest Mining Ltd. (NCM) ,  Australia ’s
biggest gold producer, said full-year profit rose 63 percent to
a record, allowing the company to pay its first special dividend.  Net income was A$908 million ($942 million) in the 12
months ended June 30, from A$557 million a year earlier, the
Melbourne-based company said today in a statement. This compares
with the A$999 million mean of 12 analyst estimates compiled by
Bloomberg.  Sales from Newcrest’s mines in Australia, Indonesia,  Papua
New Guinea  and  Ivory Coast  rose 46 percent to A$4.1 billion, the
company said. The company will pay a final dividend of 20 cents
a share as well as a special dividend of 20 cents for the year.
Gold prices gained 25 percent over the 12 months to June 30.  Bank of America Merrill Lynch raised its 12-month gold
price target last month to $2,000 an ounce on the increased
chance of a third round of so-called quantitative easing in the
U.S. Gold for immediate delivery fell 0.7 percent to $1,735.05
an ounce at 09:49 a.m. Sydney time, after reaching a record
$1,814.96 last week.  Newcrest closed at A$40.73 in Sydney trading on Aug. 12. It
has gained 7.8 percent in the past six months.  To contact the reporter on this story:
