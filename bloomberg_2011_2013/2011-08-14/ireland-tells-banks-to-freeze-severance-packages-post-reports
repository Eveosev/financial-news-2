Irelandâ€™s finance ministry last
month told state-supported banks to freeze generous redundancy
packages, the Sunday Business Post reported, without saying
where it obtained the information.  The ministry wants redundancy offers for bank employees to
include terms of three or four weeks pay per year of  service ,
the Post said. Most voluntary bank redundancies to date have
offered six weeks per year, and a statutory entitlement of two
weeks, the report said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
