Japanese and Australian  stock
futures  rose after U.S. retail sales increased by the most in
four months, boosting the earnings outlook for Asian exporters
as concern eased that the world’s largest economy may stall.  American depositary receipts of  Canon Inc. (7751) , the world’s
biggest camera maker, advanced 0.6 percent from the closing
share price in Tokyo. Those of  Trend Micro Inc. (4704) , a Japanese
maker of security software that gets a quarter of its sales in
 North America , gained 0.3 percent. ADRs of  Alumina Ltd. (AWC) , a
partner in the largest global producer of the material used to
make aluminum, climbed 1.9 percent after the company’s stock
rating was raised to “outperform” from “neutral” at
Macquarie Group Ltd.  Futures on Japan’s  Nikkei 225 (NKY)  Stock Average expiring in
September closed at 9,040 in Chicago on Aug. 12, compared with
8,960 in Osaka, Japan. They were bid in the pre-market at 9,050
in Osaka at 8:05 a.m. local time. Futures on Australia’s S&P/ASX
200 Index gained 1 percent today. New Zealand’s NZX 50 Index
advanced 0.9 percent in Wellington.  “People had been worried about the  U.S. economy  over the
medium term, but after retail sales and an earlier jobs report
exceeded estimates, people’s fears weren’t amplified,” said
 Kazuhiro Takahashi , a general manager at Daiwa Securities
Capital Markets Co. in Tokyo. “U.S. stocks are calming down.
There will be some buying in exporters and large-cap stocks.”  Retail Sales  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index rose 0.1 percent
today. In  New York , the index gained 0.5 percent to 1,178.81 on
Aug. 12 after economic reports showed retail sales rose and
first-time applications for jobless benefits decreased.  The Commerce Department said on Aug. 12 retail sales
climbed 0.5 percent in July, showing  consumer spending  was
holding up at the start of the third quarter. The increase
followed a 0.3 percent gain in June that was larger than
previously estimated. First-time applications for jobless
benefits fell 7,000 in the week ended Aug. 6 to 395,000, the
fewest since early April, the Labor Department said Aug. 11.  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index lost 11 percent this year
through Aug. 12, compared with drops of 6.3 percent by the S&P
500 and 14 percent by the Stoxx Europe 600 Index. Stocks in the
Asian benchmark are valued at 12.2 times estimated earnings on
average, compared with 11.9 times for the S&P 500 and 9.7 times
for the Stoxx 600.  The yen weakened after  Japan ’s finance minister said he is
ready to intervene in the currency market again to stem a yen
advance that risks slowing the nation’s recovery.  ‘Unstable Situation’  “An unstable situation is continuing,” Yoshihiko Noda
said during a talk show yesterday on public television
broadcaster NHK. “As foreign exchange market matters are my
prerogative, I will continue to closely watch the markets and
take bold action if it becomes necessary.”  The yen depreciated to 76.93 against the dollar, compared
with 76.81 at the close of stock trading in Tokyo on Aug. 12.
Against the euro, Japan’s currency weakened to 109.74 from
109.06. A weaker yen boosts the value of overseas income at
Japanese companies when converted into their home currency.  Japan’s Cabinet office is scheduled to release gross
domestic product figures for the quarter ended June 30 at 8:50
a.m. in  Tokyo . Japan’s GDP fell at an annualized 2.5 percent
rate in the second quarter, according to the median forecast of
25 economists surveyed by Bloomberg News.  To contact the reporters on this story:
