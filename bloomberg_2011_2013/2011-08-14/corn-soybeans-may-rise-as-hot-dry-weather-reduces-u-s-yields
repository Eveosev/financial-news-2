Corn and soybeans may rise this week
on speculation that hot, dry weather in August will erode
prospects for U.S. production.  Twenty-one of 30 traders and analysts surveyed from  Tokyo 
to  Chicago  on Aug. 12 forecast that corn will rise, and 23 of 31
respondents said soybeans will rebound.  On the Chicago Board of Trade last week, corn futures for
December delivery rose 1.6 percent to $7.145 a bushel, and
soybean futures for November delivery fell 0.1 percent to
$13.3475 a bushel.  Last weekâ€™s gain in corn was a surprise to the majority of
analysts and traders surveyed on Aug. 5, while the drop in
soybeans was expected.  Bullish on corn: 21    Bullish on soybeans: 23
Bearish on corn:  9    Bearish on soybeans:  8  To contact the reporter on this story:
