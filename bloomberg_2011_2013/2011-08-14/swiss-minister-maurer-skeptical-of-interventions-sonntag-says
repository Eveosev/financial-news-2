Swiss Defense Minister Ueli Maurer
said he’s skeptical of short-term intervention to weaken the
franc,  Der Sonntag  reported, citing an interview.  “We shouldn’t make the mistake of intervening too
strongly,” Maurer told the newspaper in the interview published
today. “Short-term measures usually cost money and one has to
pay FOR it later. We need to think long term.”  Maurer said the franc’s surge to near parity with the euro
was “a horror,” Der Sonntag reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
