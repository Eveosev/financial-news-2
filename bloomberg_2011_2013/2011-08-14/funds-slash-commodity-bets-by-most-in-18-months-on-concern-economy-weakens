Funds reduced bets on rising
commodity prices by the most in any week since February 2010 on
mounting concern that a weakening global economy will slow
demand for raw materials.  In the week ended Aug. 9, speculators cut their net-long
positions in 18 commodities by 19 percent to 989,110 futures and
options contracts, government data compiled by Bloomberg show.
Copper holdings plunged 61 percent, the most since June 2010,
and bullish gold bets fell to a five-week low.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index slumped 13 percent in the
three weeks ended Aug. 11. About $2.3 trillion was erased from
U.S. equity values over the period amid  Europe ’s debt crisis,
speculation that the economy is slowing and S&P’s downgrade of
the government’s AAA credit rating. The benchmark gauge for U.S.
shares dropped to within 11 points of a  bear market .  “The shock waves felt through commodities, currencies,
stock and bond markets over the last 10 days, that’s the primary
driver,” James Dailey, who manages $200 million at TEAM
Financial Management LLC, said in a telephone interview from
Harrisburg,  Pennsylvania  on Aug. 12. Funds reduced holdings on
signs “that the global economy is continuing to slow fairly
rapidly,” he said.  Confidence among U.S. consumers plunged this month to the
lowest level since May 1980. The Thomson Reuters/University of
Michigan preliminary index of consumer sentiment fell to 54.9
from 63.7 the prior month. The gauge was projected to decline to
62, according to the median forecast in a Bloomberg News survey.  ‘Out of Steam’  Investors put $704 million into commodity funds in the week
ended Aug. 10, according to EPFR Global, a Cambridge,
Massachusetts-based research company. Gold and precious metals
funds had an inflow of $2.14 billion, while all other funds saw
an outflow of $1.44 billion, said  Cameron Brandt , EPFR’s
director of research.  “This is what tends to happen when fear is driving
people,” Brandt said in a telephone interview on Aug. 12. “The
momentum to global growth is running out of steam, and easy
money is drying up. It’s really hard to imagine strong demand
for industrial commodities such as copper, aluminum and zinc in
the second half.”  Hedge funds  and other money managers lowered their copper
net-long position to 10,634 contracts from 27,345 on Aug. 2,
data from the U.S. Commodity and Futures Trading Commission
showed. Speculators reduced positions in cocoa by 52 percent to
3,009 positions, and soybean holdings declined 42 percent to
64,188 contracts, the biggest decline since July 2010,
government data show.  Gold Record  On Aug. 11, gold futures surged to a record $1,817.60 an
ounce, and climbed 5.5 percent last week, the most since
February 2009 and the sixth straight gain, while the S&P ended
the week down 1.7 percent, after losing 7.2 percent the previous
week, which was the most since 2008. Gold futures were up
$14.80, or 0.8 percent, to $1,757.40 at 1:23 p.m. in  New York ,
halting a two-session slide.  The Standard & Poor’s GSCI Spot Index of 24 raw materials
plunged to an eight-month low on Aug. 9 and ended the week down
0.4 percent, the third straight decline. Copper futures dropped
2 percent last week, the second straight decline.  “The depression in the stock market generally flows into
other financial markets and speculative markets,” Philip Gotthelf, the president of Equidex Brokerage Group Inc. in
Closter,  New Jersey , said in a telephone interview on Aug. 11.
“People are afraid to take on the risk of futures trading, so
they’re limiting positions. The pressure on the stock market is
putting pressure on tradable commodities.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
