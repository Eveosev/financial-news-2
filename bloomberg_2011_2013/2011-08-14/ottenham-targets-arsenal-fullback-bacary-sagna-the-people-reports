Tottenham wants to sign  France 
fullback Bacary Sagna from its north  London  soccer rival
Arsenal,  the People reported , without citing anyone.  Sagna, 28, is disillusioned at Arsenal with the impending
sales of Cesc Fabregas and Samir Nasri, and his clubâ€™s failure
to win a trophy for six years, the newspaper said.  Arsenal would demand at least 9 million pounds ($14.7
million) for Sagna, who joined the Gunners from Auxerre in 2007,
the People reported.  Tottenham also hopes to sign Lassana Diarra, with a
decision expected from Real  Madrid  this week after a 12 million-
pound bid for the midfielder, the newspaper added.  To contact the reporter on this story:
