Middle East shares advanced, sending
Dubai’s index to a one-week high, as U.S. economic data eased
concern the world’s biggest economy is headed for a recession,
buoying investor demand for riskier assets.  Emaar Properties PJSC (EMAAR) , the developer of the world’s tallest
skyscraper, gained 2.2 percent and  Dubai Islamic Bank PJSC (DIB)  rose
to the highest in more than a week. The  DFM General Index (DFMGI) 
climbed 1 percent to 1,478.67, the highest since Aug. 7, at the
2 p.m. close in Dubai.  Egypt ’s  EGX 30 Index (EGX30)  climbed 0.7 percent
in Cairo and  Israel ’s TA-25 Index surged 2.8 percent, the most
since May 2010.  Gains in local markets were prompted “by a strong
international lead from the U.S. over the weekend due to better
than expected jobless claims,” said Samer Darwiche, a financial
analyst at Gulfmena Investments in Dubai. “Investors want to
see the open of international markets tomorrow” and the Islamic
holy month of Ramadan is keeping volumes low, he said.  U.S. stocks rose Aug. 12 after the largest increase in
American retail sales in four months. First-time applications
for jobless benefits unexpectedly decreased 7,000 in the week
ended Aug. 6 to 395,000, the fewest since early April. The  S&P
500  added 0.5 percent, rising 5.2 percent in two days. The STOXX
Europe 600 Index jumped 3.7 percent Aug. 12.  Oil’s Surge  The Islamic holy month of Ramadan, when Muslims fast from
sunrise to sunset and business activity slows, started Aug. 1.
About 70 million shares traded in Dubai today, compared with a
12-month daily average of 123 million shares, according to data
on Bloomberg.  Crude oil for September delivery surged 7.7 percent in the
three days through Aug. 12 before settling at $85.38 a barrel on
the  New York Mercantile Exchange . The contract traded between a
low of $75.71 and a high of $87.37 a barrel last week. The six
nations of the Gulf Cooperation Council supply about a fifth of
the world’s oil.  Emaar rose the most since Aug. 4 to 2.82 dirhams. The
developer said revenue from the sale of villas jumped to 337
million dirhams ($92 million) in the second quarter from 54.5
million dirhams in the year-earlier period.  Dubai Islamic, the  United Arab Emirates ’ biggest lender
complying with Shariah rules, increased 1.5 percent to 2.02
dirhams, the highest since Aug. 4.  Abu Dhabi ’s  ADX General Index (ADSMI)  climbed 0.5 percent and
Oman’s MSM 30 Index gained 1 percent. Bahrain’s BB All Share
Index was little changed and Qatar’s  QE Index (DSM)  increased 0.1
percent. The Kuwait Stock Exchange Unweighted Index slipped 0.5
percent and the Saudi Arabia  Tadawul All Share Index (SASEIDX)  decreased
0.7 percent. The  Bloomberg GCC 200 Index (BGCC200)  of the region’s stocks
fell 0.3 percent.  In Israel, the TA-25 Index gained to 1,098.18. The yield on
the 5 percent Mimshal Shiklit government bonds due January 2020
rose three basis points, or 0.03 percentage point, to 4.74
percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
