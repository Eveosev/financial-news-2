Paul Myners , a former U.K. Treasury
minister, called for an inquiry into high frequency trading
because of its role in stock price volatility, the  Sunday
Telegraph  reported, citing comments by Myners.  Myners said the U.K.’s Financial Services Authority should
examine the influence of high-frequency, or “black box,”
techniques, which have played a larger role in recent share
price declines among banks than so-called short-selling,
according to the Telegraph. He said European banks should
disclose more information about levels of sovereign debt they
hold, the newspaper reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
