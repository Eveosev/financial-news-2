EON AG’s Chief Executive Officer
Johannes Teyssen said the German utility is open to discussions
about cooperation in areas such as the construction of new power
plants,  Der Spiegel  reported.  Teyssen said a direct “participation” from OAO Gazprom of
 Russia  would make “little sense” for EON, according to the
newspaper.  To contact the reporter on this story:
