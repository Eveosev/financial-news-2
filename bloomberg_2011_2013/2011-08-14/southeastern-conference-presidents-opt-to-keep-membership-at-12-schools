The  Southeastern Conference  said it
will keep its membership at 12 schools for the time being
following a meeting of its presidents and chancellors today.  “We recognize, however, that future conditions may make it
advantageous to expand the number of institutions in the
league,” Bernie Machen, chairman of the presidents and
chancellors, said in a statement on the conference’s website.’’  The meeting followed media reports that  Texas A&M
University  was considering leaving the Big 12 Conference to join
the SEC.  “No action was taken with respect to any institution,
including Texas A&M,” Machen said in the statement.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
