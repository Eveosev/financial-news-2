Chelsea manager Andre Villas-Boas
started his tenure with a 0-0 tie at Stoke City in English
soccer’s Premier League today.  The Blues are aiming to regain the Premier League title
from  Manchester United , which starts its defense at West
Bromwich Albion later today.   Villas-Boas, 33, received a three-year contract in June to
replace  Carlo Ancelotti , who left after Chelsea finished the
season without a trophy.  Yesterday, Arsenal was held to a 0-0 tie at Newcastle,
Liverpool drew 1-1 at home to Sunderland, Bolton defeated Queens
Park Rangers 4-0, and Wolverhampton Wanderers beat Blackburn 2-
1.   There were no goals in the Fulham-Aston Villa match, while
Wigan and Norwich tied 1-1. Tottenham’s game against Everton was
postponed because of last week’s rioting in London. Manchester
City hosts Swansea City tomorrow.   To contact the editor responsible for this story:
