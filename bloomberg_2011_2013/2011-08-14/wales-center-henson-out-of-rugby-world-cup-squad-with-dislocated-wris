Wales  center Gavin Henson was ruled
out of his country’s initial 30-man squad for rugby’s World Cup
after dislocating a bone in his right wrist during yesterday’s
19-9 warm-up win against  England .  The 29-year-old will be out for six to eight weeks, the
Welsh Rugby Union said in a statement on its website. Wales
plays its first match of the tournament against defending
champion  South Africa  on Sept. 11, four weeks today.  Henson will remain under the care of the national squad’s
medical staff to “ensure that he returns to fitness at the
earliest opportunity in case the coaches need to call him out to
 New Zealand  for any reason,” the WRU said.  The tournament runs until Oct. 23.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
