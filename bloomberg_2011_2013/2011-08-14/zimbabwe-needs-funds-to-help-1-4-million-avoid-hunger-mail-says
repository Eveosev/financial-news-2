Zimbabwe  needs $83 million to feed
1.4 million people who will face hunger over the next nine
months, the state-controlled  Sunday Mail  said, citing Tadeous
Chifamba, the country’s international cooperation secretary.  The United States Agency for International Development,
USAID, has contributed $18.5 million toward feeding Zimbabwe’s
hungry, the Harare-based Sunday Mail said on its website. The
southern African nation produced “slightly more” food this
year than it did last year, the Mail added, without giving
details.  To contact the reporter on this story:
