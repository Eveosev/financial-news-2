Israel Chemical Ltd. rose the most
in almost three months after the  U.S. Department of Agriculture 
said the corn harvest will be smaller than expected.  The shares’ 4.5 percent gain, the most since May 26, to
49.28 shekels at 2:15 p.m. in  Tel Aviv , followed advances of
Potash Corp, the world’s largest fertilizer maker, and  Mosaic
Co. (MOS) , the biggest producer of phosphate-based crop nutrients.
Potash rose 6.9 percent in the last two days of trading last
week and Mosaic advanced 8.9 percent. Israel’s market is closed
on Fridays.  Unusually high temperatures across the U.S. Midwest have
damaged corn crops, prompting the USDA to cut its harvest
forecast to 12.9 billion bushels (328 million metric tons) from
13.5 billion bushels projected last month. The U.S. report was
positive for “corn and soybean prices and agriculture stocks
generally,” Jeffrey Zekauskas, a New York-based analyst at
JPMorgan Chase & Co., said in a note to clients on Aug. 11.  To contact the reporter on this story:
