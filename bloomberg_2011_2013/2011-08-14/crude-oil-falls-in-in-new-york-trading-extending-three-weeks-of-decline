Oil rose in  New York  as a less-than-
expected economic contraction in  Japan , the world’s third-
biggest consumer of crude, countered concern that global growth
is slowing.  Futures fell as much as 0.6 percent and climbed as much as
0.3 percent. Japan’s economy shrank at an annualized 1.3 percent
rate in the three months ended June 30, compared with the median
forecast for a 2.5 percent drop in a Bloomberg News survey of 25
economists.  Consumer confidence  in the U.S. fell to the lowest
level in 31 years, an Aug. 12 report showed.  “The market is still nervous,” said  Jonathan Barratt , a
managing director of Commodity Broking Services Pty in Sydney,
who kept his forecast for New York crude oil to average $100 a
barrel this year. “We’ve got a big week of numbers. I think the
market has to try and get into the week on a positive note.”  Crude for September delivery was at $85.57 a barrel, up 19
cents, in electronic trading on the  New York Mercantile Exchange 
at 11:26 a.m. Sydney time. The contract slid 34 cents, or 0.4
percent, to $85.38 on Aug. 12. Prices have fallen 14 percent in
the past three weeks and 6 percent this year.  Brent oil for September settlement was at $108.25, up 22
cents, on the London-based ICE Futures  Europe . The European
benchmark was at a premium of $22.70 to U.S. futures, compared
with a record close of $23.79 on Aug. 10.  New York crude slumped as low as $75.71 a barrel and
climbed as high as $87.37 last week before closing 1.7 percent
lower, the third straight weekly decline.  Economic Reports  Reports this week will probably show the U.S. housing
market remained depressed and consumer prices rose the least in
three months in July as unemployment restrains spending,
according to surveys by Bloomberg News. Growth in the eurozone
probably slowed in the second quarter.  The Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan preliminary
index of U.S. consumer sentiment slumped to 54.9 in August from
63.7 the prior month.  Hedge funds  cut bullish bets on oil to the lowest level in
more than eight months in the week ended Aug. 9, according to a
report last week. The funds and other large speculators reduced
their net-long positions, or wagers that prices will rise, by 11
percent, according to the Commodity Futures Trading Commission’s
weekly Commitments of Traders report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
