Evonik Industries AG’s supervisory
board has decided to sell a majority holding in its real-estate
business,  Westdeutsche Allgemeine Zeitung  reported, without
saying where it got the information.  The company wants to sell at least a 25 percent stake to
its pension fund, while Evonik’s parent company, the RAG
foundation, wants to take over 25 percent, WAZ said.  RAG confirmed that it intends to take a 25 percent holding
in the company’s real estate business after an initial public
offering, the newspaper reported. The foundation’s board of
trustees still has to approve this, WAZ said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
