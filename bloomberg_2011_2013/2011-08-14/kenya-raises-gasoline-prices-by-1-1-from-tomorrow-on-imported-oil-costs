Kenya raised the cost of so-called
super petrol, the most commonly used gasoline in the East
African country, by 1.1 percent to 117.2 shillings a liter in
the capital, Nairobi.  The increase is effective from tomorrow until Sept.14, the
Energy Regulatory Commission said in an e-mailed statement
today. The higher price follows a 1.6 percent increase in
imported oil costs, it said.  Kenyan inflation accelerated for the ninth straight month
in July to 15.53 percent on rising fuel and food costs.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
