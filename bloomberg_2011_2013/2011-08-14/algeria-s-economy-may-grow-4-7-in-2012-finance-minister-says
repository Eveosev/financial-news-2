Algeria’s economy may grow 4.7
percent in 2012 after 3.9 percent growth this year, state-run
 Algerie Presse Service  reported, citing Finance Minister  Karim Djoudi .  Djoudi said the ministry’s draft budget bill forecast
inflation rate next year to remain unchanged from this year’s
level of about 4 percent, the agency reported. The North African
country’s 2012 budget is based on an oil price of $37 a barrel,
which is similar to this year’s figure, Djoudi said.  Algeria has an external debt of $5.2 billion, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
