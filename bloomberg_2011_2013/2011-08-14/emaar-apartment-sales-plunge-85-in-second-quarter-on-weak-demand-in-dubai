Emaar Properties PJSC (EMAAR) , the developer
of the  tallest tower  in Dubai, said revenue from apartment sales
plunged 85 percent in the second quarter amid weak property
demand in the Persian Gulf emirate.  Income from apartment sales dropped to 265.6 million
dirhams from 1.75 billion dirhams a year earlier, according
to Emaar’s  financial statement  posted on Dubai’s stock markert
today. Revenue from sale of villas jumped to 337 million dirhams
from 54.5 million dirhams. Emaar posted second-quarter earnings
on July 26 and provided a breakdown of revenue today.   Emaar, United Arab Emirates’ biggest developer by market
value, was hurt by a more than 60 percent slump in property
prices in its home market as speculative demand waned and banks
tightened lending since mid-2008. The company reported a 69
percent decline in second-quarter profit as it wrote down the
value of a bank investment and delivered fewer completed homes.  Sales of commercial units, plots of land and others rose
to 596.5 million dirhams in the second quarter from 176.7
million dirhams a year earlier, while revenue from the
hospitality business advanced 20 percent 283.8 million dirhams,
according to the statement.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
