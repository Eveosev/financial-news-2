German Economy Minister Philipp Roesler said he’s firmly opposed to the introduction of euro
bonds,  Handelsblatt  reported, citing an interview.  Countries that use the euro should take individual
responsibility, the newspaper quoted Roesler as saying. The
introduction of euro bonds would also mean higher interest rates
in  Germany , Handelsblatt said, citing the minister.  To contact the reporter on this story:
