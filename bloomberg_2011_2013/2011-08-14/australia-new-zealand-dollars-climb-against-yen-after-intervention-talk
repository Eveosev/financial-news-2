The Australian and  New Zealand 
dollars rose against the yen after Japan’s finance minister
warned he’s ready to intervene in the market again to stem an
advance in his nation’s currency that risks slowing an economic
recovery.  Australia ’s and New Zealand’s currencies declined last week
for a second week against the greenback as concern the  U.S.
economy  is slowing and Europe’s sovereign-debt crisis is getting
worse reduced investors’ appetite for higher-yielding assets.  The so-called Aussie climbed to 79.66 yen as of 6:56 a.m.
in Sydney from 79.44 on Aug. 12 in New York. It traded at
$1.0367 from $1.0355 last week, when it slid 0.8 percent. New
Zealand’s currency advanced to 64.01 yen from 63.85 yen. It
bought 83.30 U.S. cents from 83.22 on Aug. 12, when it completed
a 1.3 percent decline for the week.  “An unstable situation is continuing,”  Yoshihiko Noda ,
54,
said during a talk show yesterday on public television
broadcaster NHK. “As foreign exchange market matters are my
prerogative, I will continue to closely watch the markets and
take bold action if it becomes necessary.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
