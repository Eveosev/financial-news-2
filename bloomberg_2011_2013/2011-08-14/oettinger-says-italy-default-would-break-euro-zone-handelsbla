European Union Energy Commissioner
Guenther Oettinger said an Italian default would probably break
the euro zone because the country would stop contributing to the
rescue fund, Handelsblatt reported, citing an interview.  Oettinger is against increasing the 440 billion-euro
European Financial Stability Facility fund, Handelsblatt said.
The commissioner said the idea that the EFSF could refinance
itself via the  European Central Bank  like a commercial bank is
not “absurd” and should be considered, according to the paper.  To contact the reporter on this story:
