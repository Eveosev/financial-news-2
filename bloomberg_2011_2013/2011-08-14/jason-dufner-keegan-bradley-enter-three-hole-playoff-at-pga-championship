Jason Dufner  and Keegan Bradley
entered a playoff to determine the winner of the U.S.  PGA
Championship , the final major tournament of the golf season.  Dufner and Bradley tied at 8-under par after four rounds at
Atlanta Athletic Club in Johns Creek, Georgia.  The playoff will take place over the 16th, 17th and 18th
holes, with the lowest aggregate score winning. If there’s still
a tie, the format will change to sudden death over the 10th,
17th and 18th holes.  It’s the second straight year the PGA Championship has been
decided by a playoff. Martin Kaymer of Germany beat Bubba Watson
of the U.S. by one stroke over three holes in 2010 at Whistling
Straits in Kohler,  Wisconsin . Tiger Woods and Vijay Singh won
the only other three-hole aggregate playoffs in the tournament’s
history, in 2000 and 2004 respectively.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
