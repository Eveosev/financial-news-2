Third-tier English club Notts County
will play an exhibition at two-time European Cup winner Juventus
to mark the opening of the Italian soccer team’s new 41,000-seat
stadium in Turin.  The ground will be officially opened Sept. 8 and the
English club has been invited to play the record 27-time Italian
league winner that evening.  The link between the clubs dates back to 1903. John Savage,
an Englishman playing for Juve, asked a friend in Nottingham to
supply the Italian club with a set of shirts with colors better
able to withstand the weather than the pink tops they then wore.
He sent over the black-and-white striped kit, the colors then
worn by the English team and since used by Juventus.  Notts County Chairman Ray Trew said he was “slightly taken
aback” by the offer of the game, which comes amid a crowded
fixture list.  “However, given the historical relationship between our
two clubs and the sheer prestige of the occasion, we were
prepared to move heaven and earth to make this happen,” Trew
told  his club’s website . “It will be a fantastic night for
everyone associated with this great football club, the players,
the staff and of course the fans.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
