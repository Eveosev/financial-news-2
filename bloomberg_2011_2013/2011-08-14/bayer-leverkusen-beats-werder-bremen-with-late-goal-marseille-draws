Barcelona and Real Madrid drew 2-2
in the first game of the Spanish Super Cup, while  Bayer
Leverkusen  rebounded from an opening-round loss in German
soccer’s Bundesliga by beating Werder Bremen 1-0.  Mesut Ozil put Real ahead in the 13th minute last night at
the Santiago Bernabeu stadium before goals from  David Villa  and
 Lionel Messi  gave Barcelona a halftime lead.  Xabi Alonso  made it
2-2 in the 54th minute.  The return game in the annual matchup between the Spanish
league champion and the Copa del Rey winner is at Barcelona’s
Camp Nou stadium in two days. Barca won the curtain-raiser to
the Spanish season the past two years.  “We have a good feeling and we have three days to work to
earn the best possible result,” Alonso told Real  Madrid ’s
website. “I don’t care about favorites. This is a title and we
want to win it.”  In  Germany , Czech midfielder Michal Kadlec got the winning
goal in the 85th minute as Leverkusen, last season’s Bundesliga
runner-up, bounced back after losing at Mainz on Aug. 7.  Mainz and Hanover lead the standings with six points after
2-1 wins at Freiburg and Nuremberg, respectively. Stuttgart and
Borussia Moenchengladbach have four points.  Two days ago, Sejad Salihovic gave Hoffenheim a 1-0 home
win over champion  Borussia Dortmund , while Luiz Gustavo’s
injury-time goal clinched Bayern Munich’s 1-0 win at Wolfsburg.  In France, Marseille gave up a 2-0 lead to draw 2-2 at
Auxerre yesterday, while promoted Evian got its first victory,
1-0 at home to Nice.  Montpellier moved equal top on six points with Toulouse,
Caen and  Saint Etienne  by winning 1-0 at defending champion
Lille last night.  Ajax, Feyenoord and FC Twente lead the Dutch league with
six points from two games. Champion Ajax beat Heerenveen 5-1
