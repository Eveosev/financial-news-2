The  United Arab Emirates  opened
candidate registration for the  Federal National Council , an
advisory body to the government, as it attempts to broaden the
electoral process.  “We seek through the current election, a shift in the
political environment of the U.A.E., especially since the
electoral colleges represent different segments of the U.A.E.
society, which will be reflected on the way FNC functions in the
future,” Anwar Gargash, Minister of State for the Federal
National Council, said in an e-mailed statement today.  The election for the council, an advisory board to the
government, will be held on Sept. 24, according to the council’s
website. Winners will be announced on Sept. 28. Half of the 40
members are elected by a government committee and the rest are
appointed by the rulers of the country’s seven emirates.  Activists in the U.A.E. circulated an online petition in
April demanding that seats on the council be opened to universal
elections.  The petition, signed by about 140 people including
academics and journalists, also called for amending the
constitution to give the body full legislative and regulatory
authority.  The council said July 10 that the number of people allowed
to vote for its members has increased 20 times since the
inaugural election in 2006. Candidate registration will be held
for four days, until Aug. 17, the statement said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
