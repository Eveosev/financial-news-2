United Parcel Service Inc. (UPS) , the
world’s biggest package-delivery company, is resuming the
remainder of services halted in Japan’s Iwate prefecture after
the March earthquake and tsunami.  Pickups and deliveries in the affected areas will restart
today, said Susan Rosenberg, a spokeswoman. Fukushima is the
only region where some UPS services remain suspended, she said.  The restoration “has to do with businesses and our
customers getting back to work in those areas so that they’re
going to be shipping and receiving,” Rosenberg said in a
telephone interview. She didn’t know whether government
restrictions had affected UPS’s timetable for restarting.  The March 11 temblor and tsunami left more than 20,000
people dead or missing in  Japan . Power and cooling were knocked
out at the Dai-Ichi power plant in Fukushima, causing the worst
nuclear disaster since Chernobyl in 1986.  UPS resumed pickups and deliveries in eastern Japan five
days after the disaster and never stopped flying planes in and
out of the country. The Atlanta-based company hasn’t disclosed
the earthquake’s financial impact.  UPS has 1,000  employees  in Japan and 34 weekly flights to
and from the country, with 10 pickup and delivery centers plus
other centers for operations, logistics and brokerage services,
the company said in March.  About a quarter of UPS’s $49.5 billion in sales last year
came from international markets, and volume on international
packages jumped almost 14 percent, or about 7 times as much as
domestic deliveries.  To contact the reporter on this story:
