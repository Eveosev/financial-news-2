Singapore will maintain the thrust
of the policies that have helped the economy, even as it will
make adjustments to address specific concerns, Prime Minister
Lee Hsien Loong said in a televised speech today.  Investors are waiting to see what Singapore will do after
the May general election, and the island will maintain policies
that are important to the country and helpful to investors, he
said. The nation will keep its policies pragmatic and
constructive, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
