BP Plc (BP/)  is struggling to recruit
enough skilled workers such as engineers for North Sea
operations, the Sunday Telegraph reported, citing an interview
with the companyâ€™s regional head.  BP plans to hire 150 to 300 people a year, head of North
Sea operations Trevor Garlick told the newspaper. He said the
company often transfers employees who have trained in the region
to other areas, and has difficulty finding experienced workers
to replace them, according to the Times.  To contact the reporter on this story:
