Iran ’s Bushehr nuclear power plant
will start on time and is not being delayed because of
disagreements with Russia, RT television reported, citing an
 interview  with Iranian President  Mahmoud Ahmadinejad .  “I have already talked to President  Dmitry Medvedev , who
told me there is no obstacle to the plant launching its
operations at the scheduled time,” Ahmadinejad was cited as
saying by the state-run, English-language station.  Rosatom, Russia’s state nuclear holding company, has been
finishing work on the 1,000-megawatt Bushehr station and has
agreed to supply uranium to power the reactor and remove spent
fuel. The project, which has faced numerous delays, was halted
earlier this year after the reactor was switched on in August
2010.  Iran probably won’t ask  Russia  for any further help
building nuclear plants because of delays at Bushehr, Hossein
Amiri Khamkani, a member of the parliamentary committee formed
to review the status of the plant, said Aug. 8.  Ahmadinejad said Bushehr was expected to be restarted by
the end of the year. The plant may begin producing power in
August, Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov said last
month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
