Swiss Bankers Association President
Patrick Odier said the implementation of the governmentâ€™s tax
accord with  Germany  over cross-border accounts of wealthy
customers may cost lenders around 500 million Swiss francs ($643
million),  SonntagsZeitung  reported.  A separate tax agreement with the U.K. could be reached
over the coming weeks, Odier told the newspaper in the interview
published today. Swiss banks support further treaties with the
U.S.,  Italy  and  France , he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
