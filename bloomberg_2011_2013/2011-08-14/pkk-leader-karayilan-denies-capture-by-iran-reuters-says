The field commander of the outlawed
Kurdistan Workers Party, or PKK, appeared on a Kurdish TV
channel from his hideout to deny that Iranian forces have
captured him, Reuters said.  Murat Karayilan told Roj TV from the Kandil mountains
between Turkey and  Iraq  that he was well and that reports of his
arrest were designed to demoralize his Turkish Kurd rebel group,
Reuters said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
