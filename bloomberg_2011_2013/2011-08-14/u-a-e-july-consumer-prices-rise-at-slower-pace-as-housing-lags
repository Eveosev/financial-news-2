Inflation in the  United Arab
Emirates  slowed to 1.3 percent in July from 1.7 percent in the
previous month, as housing and fuel prices saw the biggest
monthly drop in more than a year.  Housing, fuel, electricity and water prices fell 2.43
percent year on year, and by 1.6 percent from a month earlier,
the National Bureau of Statistics said in an e-mail today.
That’s the biggest monthly decline since December 2009, when
prices dropped by 1.2 percent, Bloomberg data shows. Consumer
prices fell 0.16 percent from June.  “The rising supply of housing continues to pressure
rents,” said Giyas Gokkent, chief economist at the National
Bank of  Abu Dhabi , the U.A.E.’s second-biggest bank. “This
downward pressure on rents will continue to have a moderating
impact on overall inflation in the U.A.E.”  Property prices in the U.A.E. have dropped by more than
half since mid-2008 when the global credit crunch sent property
markets around the world tumbling. Rents in Abu Dhabi have
fallen 40 percent since the market’s peak, Jones Lang LaSalle
estimates. Those in Dubai, the worst performing market in the
 Middle East  for the past three years, have dropped 55 percent,
according to  Deutsche Bank AG. (DB)   To contact the reporter on this story:
