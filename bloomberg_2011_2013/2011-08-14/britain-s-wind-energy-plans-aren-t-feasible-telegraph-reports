The U.K.’s plans to get more than a
third of its energy from wind power aren’t feasible because the
power network isn’t built for it, the Sunday Telegraph reported,
citing the  Oxford Institute for Energy Studies .  Britain’s national grid wouldn’t be able to cope with the
intermittency of wind, which can not blow at all, or become too
strong and cause the system to overload, the newspaper reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
