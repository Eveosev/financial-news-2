The Chilean central bank’s rate
policy decision on Aug. 18 will be influenced by the
deterioration in the global economic climate, La Tercera
 reported , citing comments by the bank’s President Jose  De Gregorio .  The global economy will be weaker than the central bank was
expecting, De Gregorio said in an interview with the Santiago-
based newspaper. Slower global growth causes inflation to
decelerate and reduces pressure on monetary policy, De Gregorio
said, according to the newspaper.  The probability inflation will be below 4 percent this year
has increased and the central bank will publish new forecasts
next month, La Tercera said, citing De Gregorio.  To contact the reporter on this story:
