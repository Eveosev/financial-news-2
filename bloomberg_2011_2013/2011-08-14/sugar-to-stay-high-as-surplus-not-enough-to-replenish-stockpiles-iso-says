Sugar will stay high over the next
12 months because the predicted surplus of 4 million metric tons
will not be enough to rebuild stockpiles and the cost of 
production has risen, the  International Sugar Organization  said.  “Even this surplus is probably not enough to be taken by
importers to replenish their stocks, without increasing prices
considerably,”  Peter Baron ,  executive director , said in an
interview in Cebu, central Philippines today.  Prices may range between 23 cents and 28 cents a pound in
New York on what he called a constant basis and there may be “a
technical blip to 29 and 30” cents, he said. Raw sugar for
October delivery ended at 27.84 cents a pound on Friday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
