Saudi Arabia  bought 660,000 metric
tons of hard wheat from the U.S.,  Europe , Australia and Canada
for delivery from November to February, the Grain Silos and
Flour Mills Organization said.  The average price is $346 per ton, including cost and
freight, the government-run wheat importer said in an e-mailed
statement. The kingdom will receive six shipments in the port of
Jeddah and six in Dammam, according to the statement.  Saudi Arabia is raising grain imports as part of a plan to
phase out water-intensive food crops by 2016. Food was the
biggest import in May at the kingdomâ€™s eight ports, according to
data on the website of the  Saudi Ports Authority .  Domestic producers have supplied 800,000 tons of wheat this
year, the official  Saudi Press Agency  reported today, citing
Waleed Al-Khariji, the director general of the organizations.
Domestic wheat production is forecast at 1.1 million tons this
year, the news service said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
