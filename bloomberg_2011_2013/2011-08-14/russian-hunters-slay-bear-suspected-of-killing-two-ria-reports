Hunters in  Russia ’s far east have
shot a bear and three cubs suspected of killing a 19-year-old
woman and her father, RIA Novosti reported.  The two victims, who weren’t identified by name or
nationality, were fatally mauled yesterday near a river in the
Kamchatka region, the  news agency  reported.  Professional hunters found and shot a female brown bear and
her three year-old cubs today, the report said, citing an
unidentified local wildlife official. They found what appeared
to be human remains in the animals’ stomachs, the agency
reported, citing the official.  The estimated 18,000 brown bears that live on the Kamchatka
Peninsula can weigh as much as 700 kilograms (1,500 pounds)
according to RIA. Several attacks are reported each year, with
one fatal incident last year and three people killed by bears in
Kamchatka in 2009, the report said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
