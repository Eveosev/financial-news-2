Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA)  said an oil
leak from its Gannet Alpha platform in the  North Sea  spilled
between 12 to 120 barrels and is “under control.”  The company said in a statement that its estimate today is
less than an earlier preliminary estimate of as many as 1,000
barrels as it is based on oil volume detected on the surface of
the water, “natural dispersion and a better understanding of
the spill composition.”  The leak was initially detected when a light sheen on the
water was discovered Aug. 10. An inspection by a remote-operated
vehicle last night “shows the leak rate has reduced further,”
Shell said.  “We continue to expect the oil sheen will be naturally
dispersed through wave action and will not reach shore,” Shell
said. “A stand-by vessel remains on station with oil spill
response equipment and dispersant if required.”  Shell operates the  platform , 180 kilometers (112 miles)
east of Aberdeen, in waters about 95 meters deep, according to
its website.  Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM)  is a partner.  To contact the reporter on this story:
