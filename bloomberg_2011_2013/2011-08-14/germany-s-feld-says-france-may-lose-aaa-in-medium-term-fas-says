Lars Feld, a member of German
Chancellor Angela Merkel’s council of economic advisers, said
France’s AAA credit rating is at risk of a downgrade in the
medium term, according to an interview with  Frankfurter
Allgemeine Sonntagszeitung .  France’s debt ratio to its gross domestic product is too
high, Feld said. He also cited a  budget deficit  that is
“significantly” higher than in  Germany . Germany also has a AAA
rating.  The European Union rescue fund would have to be
restructured if France’s rating was cut, probably resulting in
higher costs for Germany, the German economic adviser said in
the interview.  To contact the reporter on this story:
