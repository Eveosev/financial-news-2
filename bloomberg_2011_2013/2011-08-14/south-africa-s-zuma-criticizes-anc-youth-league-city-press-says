South African President  Jacob Zuma 
has criticized African National Congress Youth League President
 Julius Malema , for statements calling for a change of government
in neighboring Botswana,  City Press  said.  The youth league’s comments on Botswana are “not in
keeping with our policies, whether on a government or ANC
level,” Zuma said, according to the Johannesburg-based Sunday
paper. The youth league’s Aug. 13  apology for its comments may
not save it from disciplinary action, ANC spokesman Jackson
Mthembu said, according to City Press.  To contact the reporter on this story:
