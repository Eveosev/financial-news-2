Delek Real Estate Ltd. (DLKR)  rose the most
in at least six years after its controlling shareholder agreed
to give an international investment fund its stake in exchange
for a 500 million-shekel ($140 million) investment in the
company.  The shares were up 58 percent, the biggest jump since at
least June 2005, and trading at 0.249 shekel at 2:09 p.m. in  Tel
Aviv . Delek Real Estate’s bond due September 2012 jumped,
pushing the yield down 29 percentage points to 59.92 at 2:06
p.m. in Tel Aviv, the lowest since July 27.  The deal, which is contingent on a 14-day period of due
diligence, also calls for a 100 million-shekel investment in
Delek Real Estate by the outgoing shareholder, a statement to
the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange said.  The  Ramat Gan , Israel-based company controlled by Isaac Tshuva has been in negotiations with bondholders over its debt
and has been selling off Canadian and other assets. Standard &
Poor’s Maalot on July 25 cut Delek Real Estate’s bond rating to
ilCC, 10 levels below investment grade, from ilCCC and placed it
on “CreditWatch” with negative implications.  Delek has a long-term debt-to-capital ratio of 81 percent,
according to Bloomberg data. Ninety-eight percent of the
companies on the TA-100 index show a better ratio. The company
has about 1.7 billion shekels of bonds outstanding, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  Delek Group Ltd. (DLEKG) , which is also owned by Israeli
billionaire Tshuva, was up 9.3 percent, its biggest jump since
June 2010, and trading at 607.90 shekels.  Eran Yunger, analyst at Migdal Capital Markets, said that
the Delek Real Estate deal gave investors more confidence to
invest in Delek Group, whose shares have dropped 33.5 percent
since the beginning of the year compared with a 6 percent drop
of the TA-100 index.  To contact the reporters on this story:
