The race to lead the Japanese
capital of  Tokyo  kicks off today, after  China  critic Shintaro Ishihara ended a 13-year run in office by resigning to run for
the national parliament.  Acting governor Naoki Inose, who served as Ishihara’s
deputy for five years, is an independent candidate backed by his
former boss and the main opposition  Liberal Democratic Party .
Residents in the city of more than 13 million people will vote
on Dec. 16, the same day as parliamentary elections.  Inose, a writer and historian, pledges to replace aging
power plants and improve the subway network in Tokyo, which has
a $1 trillion economy the size of  South Korea  that accounts for
almost a fifth of Japan’s gross domestic product. He will also
continue a bid to host the Olympics in 2020 and to make Tokyo’s
Haneda airport an international hub, according to his website.  Inose, 66, faces competition from at least seven other
candidates. They include attorney Kenji Utsunomiya, a former
head of the Japan Federation of Bar Associations; former LDP
science minister Takashi Sasagawa; and Shigefumi Matsuzawa, a
former governor of Kanagawa prefecture.  Last week, Ishihara merged his political party with the
Japan Restoration Party of Osaka Mayor Toru Hashimoto which has
also endorsed Inose. Ishihara’s proposal in April to buy an
chain of uninhabited islands also claimed by China forced Prime
Minister  Yoshihiko Noda ’s government to do so in September,
sparking violent demonstrations in China.  To contact the reporter on this story:
