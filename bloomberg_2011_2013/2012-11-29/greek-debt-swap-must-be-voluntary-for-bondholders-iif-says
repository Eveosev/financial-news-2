An aid package from European finance
ministers to ease terms for emergency aid to  Greece  including
plans for the country to buy back its debt must have the consent
of private investors, the Institute of International Finance
said.  The IIF, in charge of negotiating the terms of a debt-swap
deal with private bondholders, said in a statement that it’s
“critical that any buyback be conducted on a purely voluntary
basis.”  The package is intended to lower bilateral lending rates
and return profits generated by participating in the 100
billion-euro ($130 billion) Greek bailout to the country. The
International Monetary Fund, the European Central Bank and the
European Commission, implementing the bailout, have indicated
they will insist on a buyback as one of the conditions for the
release of the next installment of its cash.  Progress in aiding Greece would be enhanced by a resolution
of the U.S. fiscal cliff, where the expiration of tax cuts and
government spending programs at year-end threaten to upend
economic growth in the world’s largest economy, the Washington-
based IIF said.  Gridlock over an agreement to avert $607 billion in
automatic spending cuts and tax increases is hurting business
confidence and denting investment, the IIF said. It urged U.S.
lawmakers to “implement credible fiscal consolidation in a
medium-term framework to bring both the U.S. deficit and debt
positions under control.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
