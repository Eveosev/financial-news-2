(Correct to say no venue for meeting announced.)  Group of Seven finance ministers and
central bankers will meet in the U.K. on May 10-11, Britain’s
Treasury said.  While the Group of 20, which includes  emerging markets , has
become the main forum for international policy discussion, U.K.
Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne said in a statement
the smaller group of rich economies “remains an important
institution and a key forum in which to grapple with the
challenges that face the global economy.”  The meeting will come a month before Group of Eight leaders
meet in Northern Ireland. Details of venue for the finance talks
will be announced at a later date, the Treasury said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
