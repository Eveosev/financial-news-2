KBW Inc. (KBW) , the investment bank
focusing on financial-services clients, will pay a special
dividend of $2 a share linked to its takeover by St. Louis-based
brokerage  Stifel Financial Corp. (SF)   The dividend is payable Dec. 17 to shareholders of
record as of Dec. 10, the company said today in a statement.
KBWâ€™s merger agreement with Stifel, announced earlier this
month, stipulates that the cash portion of the takeover payment
will be reduced to reflect the special dividend.  To contact the reporter on this story:
