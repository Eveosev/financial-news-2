Free-agent outfielder B.J. Upton
agreed to a $75 million, five-year contract with the Atlanta
Braves, the Associated Press reported, citing a person familiar
with the negotiations.  The Braves, who may announce the deal today after Upton
passes his physical, have been looking for a center fielder to
replace free agent Michael Bourn, the AP said.  Upton, 28, hit .246 with a career-high 28 home runs, 78
runs batted in and 31 stolen bases for the Tampa Bay Rays last
season.  To contact the reporter on this story:
