The Austrian government said it is
evaluating business linked to its purchase of jet fighters from
 European Aeronautic Defence and Space Co.  amid allegations of
kickbacks.  The ministry installed a group charged with examining
follow-up deals that EADS’s Eurofighter unit commissioned after
Austria agreed to buy the jets in 2003, Economics Minister
Reinhold Mitterlehner said in a statement today.  “Our goal is complete clarification to be able to have a
full assessment of the offset business,” Mitterlehner said,
adding the ministry was also cooperating with prosecutors. “We
will get in touch with EADS directly and demand that any doubts
are removed which emerged over the legality of some of the
deals.”  Austria ordered 18 Eurofighter jets for 2 billion euros
($2.6 billion) in 2003 after a heated political debate and cut
the order to 15 jets when a new government was elected in 2006.  Under the terms of the purchase, EADS guaranteed that
business in the amount of twice the order value would be
generated in  Austria  by itself or its affiliates. Austrian
prosecutors are investigating allegations of kickbacks linked to
such deals paid to middlemen and raided EADS offices earlier
this month.  EADS said it is assisting prosecutors in their
investigation.  To contact the reporter on this story:
