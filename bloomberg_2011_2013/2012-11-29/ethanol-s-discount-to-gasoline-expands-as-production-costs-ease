Ethanol weakened against gasoline
for the first time in more than a week as production costs for
the biofuel eased.  The grain-based additive’s discount to gasoline widened to
35.9 cents a gallon from 28.79 cents yesterday, based on
December futures prices. Ethanol producers saw corn costs
decline after the Agriculture Department reported export sales
last week tumbled 69 percent from a week earlier.  “Ethanol’s still cheaper than gasoline, they’re
blending,” said Jim Damask, a manager at Biofuelsconnect, a
Jupiter, Florida-based alternative energy broker. “We’ve seen a
flurry of buying, people coming in, getting their needs and then
going back out. We’re just a little heavy in supply.”  Denatured ethanol for December delivery slipped 1.8 cents,
or 0.7 percent, to settle at $2.428 a gallon on the  Chicago 
Board of Trade, the first decline since Nov. 21. The futures
have climbed 10 percent this year.  In cash market trading, ethanol in the U.S. Gulf gained 2.5
cents, or 1 percent, to $2.50 a gallon and in Chicago the
biofuel added 2 cents, or 0.8 percent, to $2.445, data compiled
by Bloomberg shows.  Ethanol on the West Coast advanced 1.5 cents, or 0.6
percent, to $2.595 a gallon and in New York the additive
increased 1 cent, or 0.4 percent, to $2.535.  Gasoline Futures  Gasoline for December delivery rose 5.31 cents, or 1.9
percent, to settle at $2.787 a gallon on the New York Mercantile
Exchange. The contract covers reformulated gasoline, made to be
blended with ethanol before delivery to filling stations.  Ethanol-blended gasoline made up about 93 percent of the
total U.S. gasoline pool in the week ended Nov. 23, a seven-week
high, Energy Department data show.  Stockpiles of the fuel were at 18.3 million barrels, 7.6
percent higher than a year earlier, according to the government.  Corn for March delivery fell 5.25 cents, or 0.7 percent, to
$7.5875 a bushel in Chicago. One bushel makes at least 2.75
gallons of ethanol.  Based on December contracts for corn and ethanol, producers
are losing 30 cents on each gallon of the fuel made, down from
31 cents yesterday, excluding the revenue that can be pocketed
from the sale of dried distillers’ grains, a byproduct of
ethanol production that can be fed to livestock, according to
data collected by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
