Croatian medical workers and
scientists joined teachers in a one-day strike against the
government’s plan to reduce their benefits,  state TV  said.  Educators at primary and secondary schools and universities
are pressing the government over its Sept. 17 decision to cancel
collective contracts that stipulate benefits for public workers,
according to the teachers’ union.  Croatia , which is set to join the European Union in July,
is struggling to emerge from a renewed recession. The 11-month-
old  government  led by the  Social Democrats  plans to cut costs by
4 billion kuna ($690 million) this year to narrow the budget
deficit and preserve the country’s credit rating.  Fitch Ratings today lowered the country’s outlook to
negative from stable, citing a projected widening of the budget
deficit.  Health Minister Rajko Ostojic appealed to medical workers
to continue to provide medical care and keep the country’s
health system running, according to national news agency  HINA .  The average take-home salary in August was 5,541 kuna,
while unemployment in the country of 4.2 million was at 19.6
percent in November, according to the  statistics office  in
Zagreb.  To contact the reporter on this story:
