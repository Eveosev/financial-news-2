Venezuela  imported 196,000 barrels a
day of petroleum products from the U.S. in September, more than
nine times more than the 20,000 barrels a day the South American
country imported in the same month a year earlier, the U.S.
Energy Information Administration  said  today.  Venezuela, which has the largest oil reserves in the world,
imported 68,000 barrels a day of  finished motor gasoline  from
the U.S. in September, according to data published on the EIA’s
website.  Venezuela is relying on imported petroleum products from
the U.S. after a series of stoppages at its refineries, wrote
Eurasia Group analysts Risa Grais-Targow and  Daniel Kerner  in a
Nov. 27 report.  Petroleos de Venezuela SA, the state oil company, has been
operating its Amuay refinery, the country’s largest, at reduced
capacity since an Aug. 25 gas explosion that killed more than 40
people.  “Amuay is still operating at half of its normal capacity,
and Ramirez’s claims that it will be back at full capacity by
year-end should be taken with a grain of salt, given PDVSA’s
history of delays and operational challenges,” Grais-Targow and
Kerner wrote.  PDVSA, as the company is known, was processing 400,000
barrels of oil at Amuay Nov. 7 after the explosion knocked the
plant offline, Oil Minister Rafael Ramirez said. Amuay has the
capacity to refine 645,000 barrels a day.  To contact the reporter on this story:
