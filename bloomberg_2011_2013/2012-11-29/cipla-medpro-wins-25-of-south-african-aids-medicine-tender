Cipla Medpro South Africa Ltd. (CMP) , the
country’s third-largest pharmaceutical company, climbed to a
record after winning a quarter of the government’s 5.9 billion
rand ($672 million) AIDS medicine procurement contract.  The  stock  rose 0.2 percent to close at 8.82 rand, the
highest level since the shares started trading in June 2005. It
set a record intraday price of 9 rand yesterday. About 6.8
million shares, four times the daily average over the past three
months, changed hands today.  The 1.4 billion-rand contract for anti-retrovirals will run
through 2014, the Johannesburg-based company said in an e-mailed
statement. Cipla Medpro said it already has an order to supply
South Africa with respiratory medicines, bringing total business
with the government over the next two years to 2 billion rand.  “Cipla has historically been very strong in the private
sector,” Skhumbuzo Ngozwana, deputy chief executive officer,
said by phone today. The tender business has traditionally
lagged behind, he said.  Cipla Ltd. (CIPLA) , India’s third-largest drugmaker by market
value, last week offered to buy a 51 percent stake in the South
African company for 8.55 rand a share.  Aspen Pharmacare Holdings Ltd. (APN)  and  Mylan Inc. (MYL)  also won part
of the tender, the government said today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
