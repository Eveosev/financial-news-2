Former President  George H.W. Bush  is
being treated for bronchitis at a Houston hospital and expects
to be released within 72 hours, a spokesman said.  Bush, 88, is at Methodist Hospital at the Texas Medical
Center in Houston and doctors are waiting for his cough to
dissipate, the spokesman, Jim McGrath, said.  Bush’s condition isn’t life threatening, McGrath said. The
hospitalization isn’t related to Bush’s Parkinson’s disease,
which has limited his use of his legs and required him to use a
wheelchair for more than a year, McGrath said.  Bush was hospitalized earlier this month for his cough for
one week, released, and readmitted on Nov. 23, the day after
Thanksgiving.  The 41st president is the father of former President  George
W. Bush , the 43rd president.  To contact the reporters on this story:
