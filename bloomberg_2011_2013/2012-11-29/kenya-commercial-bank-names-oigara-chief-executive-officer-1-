Kenya  Commercial Bank Ltd., East
Africa’s biggest lender by assets and profit, promoted Chief
Financial Officer Joshua Oigara to chief executive officer as it
expands operations on the continent.  He will replace CEO Martin Oduor-Otieno, whose contract
ends in April. Oigara worked as finance director for Bamburi
Cement Co.,  Lafarge SA (LG) ’s Kenyan unit, before joining the lender,
known as KCB, in December 2011.  “The board has approved his name to be the next CEO,”
Chairman Musa Ndeto told reporters in the capital, Nairobi.
“The central bank has accepted this.” The contract is
renewable after four years, he said.  The bank, Kenya’s biggest by outlets, has operations in six
East African countries including  Uganda , Tanzania, Rwanda,
Burundi and  South Sudan . The units outside Kenya are expected to
contribute 25 percent of profit “in the mid-term,” compared
with 10 percent now, as trade within the East African Community
increases, Oigara said in an Aug. 7 interview.  KCB intends to open offices in three more African countries
over the next three to five years, he said.  Profit in the nine months through September surged 35
percent as income from loans grew. Net income climbed to 8.69
billion shillings ($102.1 million) from 6.43 billion shillings a
year earlier. The stock has rallied 63 percent so far this year,
outperforming a 36 percent surge in the  Nairobi Securities
Exchange’s All-Share Index (KNSMIDX)  over the same period.  Oigara’s appointment takes effect from Jan. 1, Oduor-Otieno
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
