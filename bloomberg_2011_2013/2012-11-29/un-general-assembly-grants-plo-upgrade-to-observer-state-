Palestinians won more than a two-
thirds majority vote in the United Nations to become an
“observer state.”   The 193-member General Assembly voted 138-9 to pass a
resolution that grants the Palestine Liberation Organization an
implicit form of statehood, putting it on par with the Holy See.
There were 41 abstentions.  The most significant ramification is that the Palestinians
will be able to join UN agencies and sign treaties, such as the
Rome Statute that established the International Criminal Court.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
