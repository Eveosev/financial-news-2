Poland ’s 10-year bond yields fell to
a record low before a report tomorrow that may show economic
growth slowed to its weakest pace in three years, boosting
expectations for more interest-rate cuts.  Yields on October 2023 notes slid one basis point, or 0.01
percentage point, to 4.09 percent by 5:12 p.m. in Warsaw. The
yield has declined every day this week by a total of 15 basis
points. The zloty gained 0.3 percent to 4.0895 per euro.  Growth in the European Union’s biggest eastern economy
slowed to a three-year low of 1.8 percent in the third quarter,
the statistics office will say tomorrow, according to a median
estimate of 35 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. Policy makers cut
 interest rates  this month and signaled more may come as the euro
area, Poland’s biggest trading partner, fell into a second
recession in three years.  “The market is starting to price in deeper rate cuts in
the cycle in anticipation of weaker data,”  Bank Pekao SA (PEO) 
economists led by Marcin Mrowiec in Warsaw wrote in an e-mailed
note to clients.  To contact the reporter on this story:
