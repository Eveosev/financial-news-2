Madonna’s conical-bra corset sold
for $52,000 at a London auction today.  The Jean Paul Gaultier-designed stage costume was sold
moments after a whip used by  Harrison Ford , though auctioneer
Christie’s International made no connection between the two in a
“Pop Culture” auction at its South Kensington salesroom.  Madonna wore Gaultier’s green-and-white corset for the 1990
“Blond Ambition” tour while performing three songs, including
“Now I’m Following You.” Its formal estimate was 10,000 pounds
($15,930) to 15,000 pounds at hammer prices and it made 32,450
pounds with fees. It was bought by a bidder in the room, acting
for an undisclosed London collector.  Supplies of pop and movie memorabilia have declined in
recent years as studios have become aware of their commercial
potential, boosting the rarity value of items that do make their
way onto the market, said dealers.  A black Lycra two-piece labeled “Trashy” that Madonna
wore to perform “Vogue” had an upper estimate of 12,000 pounds
and fetched 16,250 pounds.  The hand-made 12-plait kangaroo-hide bullwhip produced for
one of the Indiana Jones movies was also estimated at 10,000
pounds to 15,000 pounds. It sold for 20,000 pounds ($32,000) to
an Internet buyer.  ‘Temple of Doom’  It was one of more than 30 props produced by whipmaker
 David Morgan  and featured in the “Temple of Doom” film in
1984. The whip was first donated by  Steven Spielberg  to a Unicef
charity auction in 2001, when it was sold for 68,000 pounds,
Christie’s said.  “Indiana Jones is a timeless classic,” said Tim Lawes,
general manager of the dealership, The Prop Store of London.
“That was the cheapest whip with a provenance I’ve seen, though.
They have made $40,000 to $50,000 before.”  Lawes paid 18,750 pounds for the ‘Grail Diary’ prop from
the 1989 movie “Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade.”  Lawes said film memorabilia was now attracting alternative
investors, particularly for Bond,  Star Wars , Indiana Jones and
Spielberg films.  A prop chalice made for “Indiana Jones and the Last
Crusade” sold for 11,875 pounds, more than a 3,500-pound
estimate.  Other eye-catching pieces in the 160-lot auction included
an original concept painting by Gustaf Tenggren for the 1940
Walt Disney movie “Pinocchio” (43,250 pounds), and a bamboo
cane owned and used by  Charlie Chaplin  (6,875 pounds, beating a
top estimate of 2,500 pounds).  Warhol’s Dollar  Also up for sale was a $1 bill signed in felt-tip pen by
 Andy Warhol . It fetched 8,125 pounds, exceeding a top estimate
of 1,500 pounds.  A white jumpsuit designed by Ossie Clark for  Mick Jagger  to
wear on the Rolling Stones 1972 U.S. tour made 20,000 pounds,
beating an estimate of 12,000 pounds. The winning bidder was the
London-based Stones memorabilia collector Ali Zayeri.  Also sold: a La Perla corset worn by  Britney Spears  for her
performance of “Womanizer” at the Bambi Awards in November
2008 (1,000 pounds) and a promotional poster for the Sex
Pistols’ 1977 single, “God Save the Queen” (2,250 pounds, more
than the 800 pounds to 1,200 pounds estimated).  Punk-era souvenirs have become particularly sought after by
former fans who have become wealthier in their 40s and 50s,
dealers at the sale said.  The auction raised 653,325 pounds, within the presale 
estimate, with 81 percent of the 154 offered lots successful.  Russian Sales  Earlier in the week, auctions of Russian art in the U.K.
capital raised 36.1 million pounds with fees. They had been
estimated to fetch as much as 67.8 million pounds, based on
hammer prices.  The standout result of the series was the 4.4 million
pounds paid by a private buyer for the Christmassy 1923 Boris
Kustodiev canvas “The Coachman,” offered at Christie’s on Nov.
26. The price was an auction record for the artist.  Showing a bearded figure standing in sunlit snow, it had
been valued at 1.5 million pounds to 2 million pounds.  Christie’s,  Sotheby’s (BID)  and  MacDougall’s  attempted to lure
London’s growing population of wealthy residents from  Russia  and
the  Commonwealth of Independent States .  At the height of the previous art-market boom in 2007,
auctions in this collecting area raised almost 100 million
pounds. Some Russian buyers, concerned about high prices and the
authenticity of certain works, subsequently shifted into
Impressionist and contemporary art.  Record Price  Boosted by the record price for the Kustodiev, Christie’s
raised 15.1 million pounds with fees from its auction, just
below the upper estimate of 16.3 million pounds. The company
found buyers for 65 percent of its 391 lots.  That evening and the following day, Sotheby’s raised a
further 20.6 million pounds from 517 lots of Russian paintings
and works of art.  A top price of 1.2 million pounds -- more than twice the
upper estimate -- was paid for Valentin Alexandrovich Serov’s
painting “Portrait of Praskovia Anatolievna Mamontova” at the
company’s Nov. 26 auction of Russian art, where all 10 of the
most expensive works were bought by “Private CIS” bidders,
according to the New York-based auction house.  Russian specialists MacDougall’s raised 7 million pounds
with fees from more than 560 lots at auctions on Nov. 25 and
Nov. 28. An 1851 painting of lovers in a gondola, “View of
 Venice , San Giorgio Maggiore,” by the ever-popular Ivan
Aivazofsky, sold for 1 million pounds.  Muse highlights include  Richard Vines  on food,  Jason Harper 
on cars and  Rich Jaroslovsky  on tech.  To contact the writer on the story:
