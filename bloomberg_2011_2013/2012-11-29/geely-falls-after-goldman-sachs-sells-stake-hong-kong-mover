Geely Automobile Holdings Ltd. (175)  fell
the most in three months in Hong Kong trading after Goldman
Sachs Principal Investment Area sold shares at a 7.8 percent
discount.  The Volvo Car affiliate  fell  as much as 4.5 percent, the
most on a closing basis since Aug. 22, to HK$3.51 and traded at
HK$3.49 as of 10:45 a.m. local time. Goldman Sachs Principal
Investment Area sold 600 million shares at HK$3.30 each, the low
end of a marketed price range, according to a person with
knowledge of the matter. The Standard newspaper reported that
the fund was seeking to sell shares earlier today.  Geely  shares  more than doubled this year, while Hong Kong’s
benchmark Hang Seng Index rose 18 percent. The Zhejiang, China-
based automaker sold bonds convertible into 908.4 million new
shares at HK$1.90 apiece and warrants transferrable into 299.5
million new shares to a fund managed by Goldman in September
2009.  “I think Goldman is selling 600 million shares from a
combination of the convertible bonds and the warrants,” said
Steve Man, a Nomura Holdings Inc. analyst in Hong Kong with a
buy rating on the stock. “It’s a pretty good return for them
over the last three years.”  Lawrence Ang, executive director at Geely, didn’t reply to
an e-mail seeking confirmation and details of the sale.  Geely, which has targeted becoming  China ’s biggest car
exporter in two years, reported profit increased 8.7 percent in
the first six months of the year and forecast a “more
challenging” second half on rising competition.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
