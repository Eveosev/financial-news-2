Russia, the world’s third-biggest
wheat exporter last season, will have sufficient grain and a
“small” amount of carry-over stocks at the end of the season
on June 30, Deputy Prime Minister  Arkady Dvorkovich  said.  He didn’t give a specific estimate. Deputy Agriculture
Minister Ilya Shestakov said on Nov. 21 that grain stocks may
fall to a “critical level” of about 6 million metric tons if
Russia exports 15.5 million tons of grains this season.
Shipments reached 11.4 million tons by Nov. 26, according to
 Agriculture Ministry  data.  Interest in exporting grain is declining as prices in
Russia and abroad are leveling off, Dvorkovich said after a
government meeting in Moscow today.  The Agriculture Ministry forecast a 25 percent-drop in the
harvest this season after drought seared crops across the
country. The ministry expects the grain crop to reach 71 million
tons after drying and cleaning, down from 94.2 million tons in
2011.  Russia  may have a “decent crop” in the season starting
July 1, 2013, taking into account the current condition of
winter grains, Dvorkovich said without providing an estimate.
The total area sown is expected to be bigger than in 2011, he
said.  Russia’s weather center said yesterday 8 percent of winter
plantings are in bad condition, compared with an average of 6.1
percent. The rest of the crops are in good and satisfactory
shape. Seeds on 500,000 hectares (1.2 million acres) in the
south of the country, or about 3.2 percent of the total area
sown, failed to sprout as of Nov. 25, according to its data.  Seeds in the south may still emerge and develop in the
spring of 2013 if the weather is favorable, which would be
positive for next year’s crop, Vladimir Petrichenko, director of
Moscow-based consultancy OOO ProZerno, said by phone in Moscow
yesterday.  Wheat for March delivery was little changed at $8.9175 a
bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade by 3:31 p.m. Moscow time.  To contact the reporters on this story:
