A unit of German drugmaker  Bayer AG (BAYN) 
sued India’s Lupin Ltd. in federal court alleging infringement
of a U.S. patent for the birth-control pill Natazia.  Bayer Pharma AG, based in Berlin, contends Mumbai-based
Lupin is planning to offer a generic copy of  Natazia  in the U.S.
before the patent expires in 2026, according to a complaint
filed yesterday in Wilmington,  Delaware .  Bayer said it’s entitled to triple damages if Lupin markets
the drug in violation of patent-protection laws.  Natazia tablets have been approved by the U.S. Food & Drug
Administration for use as an oral contraceptive and to treat
pathologically heavy menstruation in women, according to the
complaint.  “We do not comment on ongoing litigations as a matter of
policy,” Lupin’s communications manager, Shamsher Gorawara,
said today by e-mail.  The case is Bayer Pharma AG v.  Lupin Ltd. (LPC) , U.S. District
Court, District of Delaware (Wilmington).  To see the patent, click: 8,071,577.  To contact the reporter on this story:
