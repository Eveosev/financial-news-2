Julius Berger Nigeria Plc (JBERGER) , the
country’s biggest construction company, rose to the highest in
almost six months on demand from institutional investors,
Lambeth Trust and Investment Co. said.  The stock gained 4.8 percent to 33 naira by the close in
Lagos,  Nigeria ’s commercial capital, the highest since Jun. 1.
About 192,000 shares, 27 percent of the three-month daily
average, changed hands, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Institutional investors are interested in the stock because
Julius Berger “is getting more jobs,” David Adonri, chief
executive officer of Lagos-based Lambeth, said by phone.
“Demand for the stock is five times the supply.”  The government on Nov. 19 awarded Julius Berger, a unit of
 Germany ’s  Bilfinger Berger AG (GBF) , and RCC Nigeria Ltd. a contract
to rebuild the 125-kilometer Lagos-Ibadan Expressway, the
country’s busiest road in the southwest, the  Punch  newspaper
said on Nov. 20. Julius Berger won a contract to rebuild the
United Nations Building in Abuja, Nigeria’s capital, at a cost
of 5.1 billion naira ($32 million), ThisDay newspaper reported
on Nov. 22.  Investors’ expectations on Julius Berger “are very high”
after winning the contracts, Raheem Mohammed, chief operating
officer of Kundila Finance Ltd., said by phone from Lagos. “We
expect the stock to rise to 50 naira before the release of the
full-year result early next year.”  Nine-month profit rose to 3.79 billion naira from 2.74
billion naira, the company said on Nov. 6.  To contact the reporter on this story:
