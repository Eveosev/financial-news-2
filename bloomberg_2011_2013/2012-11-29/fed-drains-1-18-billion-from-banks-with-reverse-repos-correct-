(Corrects amount in the headline.)  The  Federal Reserve  drained $1.18
billion in  reserves  from the banking system when it arranged
three-day tri-party reverse repurchase agreements.  The “small-value” transactions, part of a series of open-
market operations that began in 2009, don’t represent any change
in monetary policy, according to a  statement  on the  Federal
Reserve  Bank of New York’s website yesterday.  The Fed uses repos and reverse repos to help maintain the
level of money in the banking system to keep overnight  interest
rates  close to the central bank’s target. The Fed has held its
target rate for overnight loans between banks in a range of zero
to 0.25 percent since December 2008. The central bank’s large-
scale asset purchases have swelled its balance  sheet to $2.87
trillion, close to a record, as policy makers have sought to
reduce borrowing costs.  In a reverse repo, the Fed lends securities for a set
period, temporarily draining cash from the banking system. At
maturity, the securities are returned to the Fed, and the cash
to its counterparties.  In a tri-party arrangement, a third party functions as the
agent for the transaction and holds the security as collateral.
JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Bank of  New York  Mellon Corp. are the
only banks that serve in a trade-clearing capacity in the tri-
party repo market.  To contact the reporter on this story:
