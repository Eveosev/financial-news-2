Mexican President  Felipe Calderon 
signed into law the nation’s biggest labor overhaul in four
decades today, two days before he leaves office, in a move that
aims to boost productivity by easing hiring and firing.  Calderon, 50, signed the law today in a ceremony at the
presidential residence of Los Pinos two weeks after it was
approved by Mexico’s Senate. The bill was one of two he
introduced in September with fast-track authority that limited
debate.  The president had pushed for similar changes earlier in his
six-year term, only to be blocked by President-elect Enrique Pena Nieto’s Institutional Revolutionary Party. This time, many
PRI lawmakers sided with the reform, which Pena Nieto advocated
during his election campaign.  The labor bill allows temporary and trial-basis contracts
and hourly wages, while regulating outsourcing and limiting the
amount of back-wages workers can collect if they win legal
disputes with employers. Thousands protested in Mexico City
against the initiative in weeks leading up to the vote, saying
it erodes workers’ rights.  To contact the reporter on this story:
