CBOE Holdings Inc. (CBOE)  plans to move a
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index contract introduced last year on its
C2 venue to the  Chicago Board Options Exchange , where it can be
bought and sold electronically and on the trading floor.  The  S&P 500 index  contract, which settles based on end-of-
day prices rather than levels at the start of the session,
currently can be traded only electronically on C2, an exchange
introduced in 2010. The main options on the S&P 500 trade
primarily in open outcry on the floor of the CBOE. Those
contracts settle based on  price levels  at the start of the
trading session and are the largest options product by volume.  The shift is expected to increase access to  SPXpm (SPXPM) , as the
newer product is called, and its liquidity, CBOE said in an
announcement today. Weekly and quarterly products based on the
evening-settled index options will also move to the CBOE.  “Moving SPXpm to CBOE’s hybrid trading environment opens
up access to a very active SPX trading crowd on the floor of the
CBOE,”  William Brodsky , Chairman and CEO of CBOE Holdings, said
in the release. “Customers who prefer to trade SPXpm
electronically may continue to do so, but will have the added
benefit of tapping into the additional liquidity we expect to
see from our trading floor.”  CBOE plans to move the products to its main exchange in the
first quarter of next year, pending regulatory approval.  To contact the reporter on this story:
