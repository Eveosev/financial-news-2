Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA)  lifted its
force majeure on Forcados crude exports as  Total SA (FP)  resumed gas
supplies to  Nigeria LNG Ltd. , operator of the largest liquefied
natural gas plant in  Africa .  Shell rescinded the legal step that protects a company from
liability when it can’t fulfill a contract for reasons beyond
its control at 9 a.m. local time,  Precious Okolobo , a Lagos-
based spokesman said by phone. Total also ended its halt on gas
supplies to Nigeria LNG and resumed normal production from
onshore block OML 58 that pumps 90,000 barrels a day of oil,
Anastasia Zhivulina, a Paris-based spokeswoman, said today in an
e-mail in response to questions.  The loading halt on Forcados had been in place since Oct.
19 as a result of production deferment caused by suspected theft
on Shell’s Trans-Forcados Pipeline and the Brass Creek link, the
company said Oct. 22. Shell ended its force majeure on Bonny
Light on Nov. 21.  In October, Shell, Total and  Eni SpA (ENI) , which together
provide more than 80 percent of Nigeria LNG’s natural gas
feedstock, declared a block on supplies because of damage to
pipeline facilities and a water surge that inundated oil and gas
fields in the Niger River Delta.  Eni’s force majeure on supplies to Nigeria LNG is still in
place, the company said today in an e-mailed statement.  To contact the reporters on this story:
