Wells Fargo & Co. (WFC) , the biggest U.S.
home lender, said federal regulators plan to forgo recommending
enforcement action after completing a probe of offering
documents for mortgage-backed securities.  The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission notified Wells
Fargo on Nov. 20 that the previously announced probe was over,
the San Francisco-based bank said yesterday in a regulatory
filing. The firm said Feb. 28 that it received a so-called Wells
notice, a warning that regulators may recommend enforcement.  It’s at least the second time in less than four months that
the SEC has dropped an investigation into the marketing of
mortgage-backed securities by the largest U.S. banks. The agency
told  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)  on Aug. 6 that it had closed a
probe and no longer planned to pursue claims against the New
York-based company, according to a filing.  Wells Fargo, which revealed the SEC’s warning in its 2011
annual report, said at the time the government was examining
whether it properly described facts and risks in offering
documents for mortgage-backed debt.  Regulators are still examining how banks packaged and sold
home loans to investors, more than four years after mounting
mortgage defaults prompted government bailouts of the financial
system. Goldman Sachs paid $550 million in 2010 to settle SEC
claims that it misled investors on a mortgage-linked investment
in 2007. In that case, the company said it made a “mistake” in
omitting disclosures.  To contact the reporter on this story:
