BT Group Plc (BT/A) , the U.K.’s biggest
fixed-line phone company, will lease part of the media centers
built for the  London  2012 Olympics for its television sports
channels.  BT Sport will use 75,000 square feet (7,000 square meters)
of space in the former Olympic Broadcast Centre to produce live
sports content including English Premier League soccer, the
building’s owner, Innovation City, said in an e-mailed statement
today.  BT can use the site in London’s East End starting in
February and will begin broadcasts in August, pending planning
approval from the London Legacy Development Corp., Innovation
City, a unit of data center provider Infinity SDC Ltd., said in
the statement. BT will have a 10-year lease for the space, which
accounts for about 6 percent of the press and broadcast centers.  London Olympic officials are seeking buyers for buildings
and sports facilities erected for the Games as they try to avoid
the legacy of previous host cities such as  Athens  that were left
with underused or dormant sites. They are still seeking a tenant
for the 80,000-capacity Olympic Stadium.  To contact the reporter on this story:
