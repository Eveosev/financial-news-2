Residual-fuel stockpiles in
Singapore,  Asia ’s largest oil-trading and storage center,
climbed to the highest level in almost five months, according to
a unit of the Ministry of Trade and Industry.  Inventories including  fuel oil  and low-sulfur waxy residue
and excluding bitumen increased 305,000 barrels, or 1.4 percent,
to 22.5 million in the seven days ended yesterday,  International
Enterprise Singapore  said today in an e-mailed statement.
Supplies were the most since the week to July 4.  Stockpiles of  middle distillates  including gasoil, or
diesel, and kerosene rose 691,000 barrels, or 7.5 percent, to
9.9 million, the ministry’s data showed. Supplies rebounded from
the lowest level in seven weeks.  Light-distillates including naphtha, gasoline and reformate
fell 1.5 million barrels, or 13.7 percent, to 9.4 million,
according to the data. That’s the first decline in five weeks.  The trade ministry surveys refiners, traders and storage
terminals on a voluntary basis. The results may exclude offshore
storage capacity, International Enterprise said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
