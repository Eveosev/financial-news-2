Johnson & Johnson, the world’s
biggest maker of consumer health products, will let generic-drug
companies make and distribute copies of its HIV medicine
 Prezista (JNJ)  in sub-Saharan Africa and poor countries.  J&J, based in  New Brunswick , New Jersey, won’t enforce
patent claims against drugmakers that copy the pill. Prezista,
or darunavir, is an antiretroviral medication that’s used to
treat the immune system-destroying virus, in combination with
other anti-viral drugs.  Last year, J&J sold $1.21 billion of Prezista, making it
the company’s sixth best-selling drug. The agreement says that
generics manufacturers can only distribute the medicine for
patients living in the African and least-developed countries.
About  34.2 million people  worldwide are infected with HIV,
including 22.9 million in Africa, according to the  World Health
Organization .  “Intellectual property should not be a barrier to ensuring
a sustainable supply of medically acceptable darunavir in the
world’s poorest countries,” Paul Stoffels, J&J’s worldwide
chairman of pharmaceuticals, said in a statement today.  Prezista is used in patients who’ve already been on and
failed other HIV treatments because the virus becomes resistant
to them. Today’s statement didn’t identify specific countries
subject to the agreement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
