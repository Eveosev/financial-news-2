Volkswagen AG (VOW) ,  Europe ’s largest
carmaker, has reached an agreement to extend its joint venture
with  China ’s FAW Group for another 25 years, after concluding
that neither side infringed on technology patents.  The two companies will extend their partnership beyond
2016, when the current contract expires, expand their product
portfolio and jointly develop new business activities, the
Wolfsburg, Germany-based carmaker said in a statement today.  The agreement was reached after a meeting between VW Chief
Executive Officer  Martin Winterkorn  and FAW Group Chairman Xu Jianyi, according to the statement. Both partners discussed the
issue of engine and gear box patents and concluded no rights
were infringed, the company said in a statement.  China is key to VW’s goal of overtaking  General Motors Co. (GM) 
and  Toyota Motor Corp. (7203)  as the world’s biggest automaker by 2018.
The German carmaker, which makes Jetta and Audi A6L sedans with
FAW, has pledged to invest 9.8 billion euros ($12.7 billion) in
China through 2015.  The German newspaper Handelsblatt reported in July that FAW
had illegally copied engine technology and collected offers from
suppliers for key parts to a VW gearbox, without saying where it
got the information. Christoph Adomat, a VW spokesman, said then
that it was looking into the issue.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
