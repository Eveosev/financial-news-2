President  Barack Obama ’s aides said
they would recommend he veto a $631.4 billion defense
authorization measure now before the Senate unless it’s changed.  Among provisions cited as unacceptable in a statement today
from the White House is the bill’s limit on using funds to
transfer detainees from the detention facility at Guantanamo
Bay, Cuba, to other countries.  The administration maintains “that restricting the
transfer of detainees to the custody of foreign countries in the
context of an ongoing armed conflict interferes with the
executive’s ability to make important foreign policy and
national security determinations, and would in certain
circumstances violate constitutional separation of powers
principles,” according to the statement.  The defense measure for the fiscal year that began Oct. 1
sticks with Obama’s defense budget request. The Senate may vote
on passage of the measure tomorrow.  The bill is S 3254.  To contact the reporter on this story:
