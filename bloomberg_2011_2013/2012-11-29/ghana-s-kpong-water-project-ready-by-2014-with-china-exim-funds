A $273-million expansion of  Ghana ’s
Kpong water-treatment plant will be ready by 2014 with funding
from the government and the Export-Import Bank of  China , Water
Resources, Works and Housing Minister Enoch Teye Mensah said.  The project, which is 40 percent complete, will increase
supplies to the capital, Accra, and its suburbs by 40 million
gallons a day, he told reporters in the city today.  Ghana, which has West Africa’s second-biggest economy, is
investing in infrastructure with loans from China and other
donors to meet the pace of its growth, forecast at 8.2 percent
this year and 7.8 percent in 2013, according to the
International Monetary Fund.  In Teshie, a town near Accra, a $110 million project to
treat sea water will “serve an estimated population of 500,000
people,” Mensah said. The project has been approved and will
take two years, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
