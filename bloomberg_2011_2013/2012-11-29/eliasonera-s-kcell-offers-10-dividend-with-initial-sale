Kcell, the Kazakh wireless unit of
 Sweden ’s largest telephone company  TeliaSonera AB (TLSN) , is offering a
dividend yield next year of about 10 percent to attract
investors to its initial share sale, said people with knowledge
of the process.  Kcell, which is meeting investors in  London , Moscow,
continental Europe and the U.S. over the next two weeks, will
pay the dividend in the second quarter, the people said, asking
not to be named as the process is private. The dividend yield
will be determined once Kcell’s final share price is set.  TeliaSonera has sought $10.50 to $13 for each share in the
Kcell unit, according to a statement yesterday from the
Stockholm-based company. The IPO would value Kcell at $2.1
billion to $2.6 billion and cut TeliaSonera’s stake to 61.9
percent from 86.9 percent. At the range’s top end, the company
could raise $650 million. Trading is set to start Dec. 12.  Kcell will pay the first-year dividend based on 100 percent
of its net income for the second half of 2012, the company said
in the statement. It plans to pay investors dividends based on
at least 70 percent of full-year net income after that, meaning
the dividend amount may increase depending on performance.  Spokesmen for Teliasonera and Kcell declined to comment.  Telefonica Dividend  Telefonica Deutschland Holding AG, which raised 1.45
billion euros ($1.9 billion) in  Europe ’s largest IPO this year,
promised investors 500 million euros in cash dividends from 2012
earnings and has projected increasing pay outs in coming years.  Nordic operator TeliaSonera is selling stakes in emerging-
markets ventures to gain funds, while retaining holdings in them
to benefit from growth that’s faster than in more mature markets
such as Sweden and Finland. OAO MegaFon, the carrier’s Russian
affiliate, began trading this week after TeliaSonera reduced its
stake to 29 percent through an IPO.  Kcell, which has operated in  Kazakhstan  since 1998, had
approximately 12.7 million subscribers and a market share of
47.7 percent as of September,  according  to the company.  Credit Suisse AG (CSGN) ,  UBS AG (UBSN)  and Visor Capital are managing the
sale, according to yesterday’s statement.  Shares of TeliaSonera, which has cut  jobs  and trimmed
expenses in Sweden and Finland, rose 2.3 percent to 45.04 kronor
at 5:48 p.m. in  Stockholm . The stock had dropped 5.9 percent
this year through Nov. 28, valuing the company at 191 billion
kronor ($29 billion).  To contact the reporter on this story:
