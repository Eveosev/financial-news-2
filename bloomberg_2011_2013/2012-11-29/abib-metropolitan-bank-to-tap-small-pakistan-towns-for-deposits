Habib Metropolitan Bank Ltd. (HMB) , a
Pakistani lender, plans to open over 65 outlets by 2014, aiming
to tap deposits in small trading towns in the central province
of Punjab.  “You have to follow the  money flow ,” Sirajuddin Aziz,
chief executive officer, said in an interview in Karachi
yesterday. “Commodities dealers in Karachi are trading with
cities up country and we don’t want to miss that leg of the
transaction.”  Mid-sized Pakistani banks are seeking lower cost deposits
outside the major cities as falling interest rates reduce income
from loans, squeezing profits. These smaller lenders generated
70 percent of fresh deposits in the six months ended Dec. 31,
outpacing their bigger rivals, according to a central bank
 report  this month.  The bank plans to expand its network to at least 250
branches in 50 cities by 2014 from 183 outlets in 32 locations,
said Aziz, 56, who took over as CEO in December.  Continual growth in the bank’s deposits has kept revenue
rising consistently, said Nauman Waqar, an analyst at Optimus
Capital Management Pvt. Ltd. in Karachi.  Pakistan’s central bank lowered  borrowing costs  for a
second meeting in October, to 10 percent from 10.5 percent,
following a moderation in inflation.  Election Year  Habib Metropolitan may see flat growth in 2013, an election
year in Pakistan, Aziz said. “Maintaining the current stream of
income will be a challenge for banks since we’ll see populist
policies until the election.”  Net income rose 29 percent to 2.81 billion rupees ($29
million) in the nine months ended Sept. 30, according to the
company’s profit statement.  The bank’s  shares  have gained 10.2 percent this year,
compared with a 49 percent increase in the benchmark KSE 100
index. The shares rose 2.5 percent to 18.61 rupees at the close
of trade in Karachi, the highest in three months with volume
more than twice the three-month daily average.  Habib Metropolitan plans to increase its loans by about 12
percent to 135 billion rupees by 2013, after remaining static
for three years at 120 billion rupees, he said. This will be
done by increasing lending to small and medium enterprises
involved in foreign trade, Aziz said. Lending for overseas
shipments accounts for 80 percent of the bank’s loans, he said.  Habib Metropolitan Bank acquired Swiss-based Habib Bank AG
Zurich’s 18 Pakistani branches in 2006. AG Zurich owns 51
percent of Habib Metropolitan.  To contact the reporter on this story:
