Water utilities in two Mexican
cities signed grant agreements with the North American
 Development Bank  to help finance $76 million of wastewater and
water infrastructure projects.  Sewer and water upgrades in Matamoros and wastewater
collection system improvements in downtown Miguel Aleman in
Tamaulipas state will benefit from almost $18 million from the
Environmental Protection Agency through the Border Environment
Infrastructure Fund thatâ€™s administered by bank.  The works are being carried out in collaboration with the
Mexican National Water Commission, the development bank said in
a statement. The San Antonio-based NADB has given $315 million
in loans and grants for environmental infrastructure projects to
assist 16 communities on the northern border of Tamaulipas.  To contact the reporter on this story:
