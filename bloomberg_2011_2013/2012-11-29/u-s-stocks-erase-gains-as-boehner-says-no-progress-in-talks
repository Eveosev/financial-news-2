U.S. stocks erased gains after House
Speaker  John Boehner  said “no substantive progress” has been
made in budget talks in Washington.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index was little changed at
1,410.62 at 11:44 a.m. in New York after rallying as much as 0.7
percent on optimism lawmakers would reach a deal to avert the
fiscal cliff of more than $600 billion in automatic tax
increases and spending cut.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
