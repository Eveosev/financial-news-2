North Korea  replaced Kim Jong Gak as
defense minister as the nation’s young leader, Kim Jong Un,
promotes commanders who show him strong allegiance,  South
Korea ’s Munhwa Ilbo newspaper reported, citing a government
official in Seoul it didn’t identify.  Kim Kyok Sik, who is believed to have orchestrated the
shelling of Yeonpyeong Island and the sinking of a South Korean
naval ship in 2010, has been promoted to minister, the Korean-
language newspaper said.  Kim Jong Un became head of the totalitarian state in
December last year, following the death of his father,  Kim Jong Il , who ruled the secretive nation from 1994 to 2011.  He took the country’s top rank of marshal in July, as he
sought to bolster his power as leader of the impoverished
nation’s 1.2 million-strong armed forces. The promotion came
days after Kim sacked veteran army chief Ri Yong Ho, in the
biggest publicly revealed power shift since his succession.  The continuing shakeup in the military may indicate that
Kim Jong Un’s regime remains unstable, Munhwa reported.  North Korea, which in April defied international sanctions
with an attempt to fire a long-range rocket that failed minutes
after liftoff, may be preparing for another test. Activity at
its Sohae Satellite Launching Station is consistent with
preparations before the previous launch, satellite company
DigitalGlobe Inc. said, citing analysis of a Nov. 23 image of
the area.  To contact the reporter on this story:
