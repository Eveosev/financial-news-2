Hostess Brands Inc., the defunct
maker of Twinkies and Wonder Bread, told a bankruptcy court that
it must cut $1.1 million a month in retiree benefits as part of
its liquidation plan.  U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Robert Drain in White Plains, New
York, today approved formation of a committee of retired
employees to defend their rights in connection with the intended
cuts. Drain is also being asked to consider Hostess’s request to
close and its bid to pay as much as $1.75 million in incentive
bonuses to 19 senior managers during the company’s wind-down.  Hostess, based in Irving,  Texas , said it was forced to opt
for liquidation after the bakers’ union went on strike Nov. 9.
The Bakery, Confectionery, Tobacco Workers & Grain Millers
International Union, representing about 5,000 Hostess workers,
walked out after Drain imposed contract concessions opposed by
92 percent of its members.  The union and a pension fund have asked the judge to
appoint a trustee to take control of the wind-down.  Hostess sought court protection in January, its second time
in bankruptcy, listing assets of $982 million and debt of
$1.43 billion. The 82-year-old maker of Hostess CupCakes, Ding
Dongs and Ho Hos has endured years of declining sales as
Americans turned to rivals’ snacks and breads, while ingredient
costs and labor expenses climbed.  The case is In re Hostess Brands Inc., 12-22052, U.S.
Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of New York (White Plains).  To contact the reporter on this story:
