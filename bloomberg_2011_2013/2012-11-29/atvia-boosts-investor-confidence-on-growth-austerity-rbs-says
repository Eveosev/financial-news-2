Investor confidence in Latvia has
improved because of economic growth and austerity measures,
 Royal Bank of Scotland Plc  said.  The Baltic country plans to sell $2 billion of foreign
bonds next year and $3.2 billion in 2014 to cover spending and
repay an international bailout loan from 2008, Mohammed Kazmi, a
London-based emerging-markets strategist at RBS, wrote today in
an e-mailed note.  Latvia’s economy shrunk by almost a quarter in 2008 and
2009 after a property-fueled real estate bubble burst, credit
markets froze and its second-biggest bank needed a rescue. The
economy grew 5.3 percent from a year earlier from July to
September, the ninth consecutive quarter of expansion, as
exports and domestic spending advanced.  Growth “is expected to reach 4 percent in 2012, the
highest rate in the European Union, which has resulted in strong
revenues and has crucially provided the government with room to
ease austerity measures,” Kazmi said in the report.  The yield on  Latvia ’s dollar bond due 2021 fell eight basis
points to 3.2457 percent as of 4:41 p.m. in Riga, the capital,
data compiled by Bloomberg show. It fell to a low of 3.1911
percent on Oct. 18.  To contact the reporter on this story:
