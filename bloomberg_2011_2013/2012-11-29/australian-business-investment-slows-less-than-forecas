Australian business investment
slowed less than economists forecast last quarter as stronger
mining spending outweighed a decline in manufacturing.  Capital spending  gained 2.8 percent from the second
quarter, when it rose 3.4 percent, the Bureau of Statistics said
in Sydney today. That compares with the median forecast for a 2
percent gain in a Bloomberg News survey of 20 economists.  Reserve Bank  of Australia Governor  Glenn Stevens  held the
key  interest rate  at 3.25 percent this month, having cut the
benchmark five times since embarking on a series of reductions
in November 2011 as the country’s resource boom cools. He said
in minutes of the meeting that “further easing may be
appropriate.” While today’s report showed a rise in mining
investment from July to September, a projection for the 12
months ending June 30, 2013, was 8.1 percent lower.  “The forward-looking components of this survey are
consistent with the RBA’s easing bias,” said Su-Lin Ong, head
of Australian economic and fixed-income strategy at  RBC Capital
Markets  in Sydney. “You can see clearly capital expenditure is
easing, clearly the labor market is easing and the  unemployment
rate  is going to head higher.”  The central bank earlier this month predicted a peak in
resource spending at about 8 percent of gross domestic product
from a prior 9 percent as the boom is expected to crest at a
lower level.  Investment Projection  Today’s report showed Australian companies forecast
investment of A$173.4 billion ($182 billion) in the year ending
June 30, which was 3.3 percent lower than their estimate three
months earlier. Australian mining investment in 2012-13 is
projected at A$109.4 billion, compared with A$119 billion three
months earlier.  The local dollar slid after the report, buying $1.0463 at 2
p.m. in Sydney from $1.0470 before the release. The yield on
Australia’s benchmark 10-year note fell to 3.19 percent from
3.21 percent yesterday.  Traders are pricing in a 74 percent chance that the RBA
will cut its main rate to 3 percent on Dec. 4, up from a 69
percent probability seen yesterday, swaps data compiled by
Bloomberg show. That would match the half-century low of 3
percent reached at the height of the 2008-2009 global financial
crisis.  Buildings, Equipment  Today’s report showed spending on buildings and structures
rose 1 percent last quarter. Company investment in new plant and
equipment advanced 6.2 percent, it showed.  Australia’s currency has risen 4.6 percent against the  U.S.
dollar  in the past year, the best performer after the  New
Zealand dollar  among Group of 10 currencies, propelled by a
mining boom as urbanization in China drives demand for  iron ore ,
liquefied natural gas and coal. The RBA cut the overnight cash-
rate target by 1.5 percentage points from November 2011 to
October.  Stevens, in a speech last week, said Australia’s economy
will need to adapt to a slower pace of growth in China, higher
national savings at home and a decline in the resource
industry’s contribution to gross domestic product.  To contact the reporter on this story:
