Polish day-ahead electricity 
advanced as higher prices in neighboring countries prompted an
increase in exports.  Next-day power added 2.2 percent to 182.30 zloty ($57.79) a
megawatt-hour, exchange data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Net exports to the Czech Republic, Germany and Slovakia
were set to rise to as much as 1,453 megawatts in the early
hours of tomorrow from 281 megawatts at the same time today,
data from Warsaw-based grid manager PSE Operator SA showed.  Tauron Polska Energia SA (TPE)  was set to keep 345 megawatts of
power capacity at Jaworzno and Lagisza plants halted tomorrow
due to unplanned stoppages, the grid company said.  Day-ahead electricity on the coupled markets of the  Czech
Republic  and Slovakia jumped 16 percent to 55.97 euros ($72.63)
a megawatt-hour in a daily auction, according to the countriesâ€™
market operators. The day-ahead contract in Hungary settled 16
percent higher at 56.09 euros a megawatt-hour.  To contact the reporter on this story:
