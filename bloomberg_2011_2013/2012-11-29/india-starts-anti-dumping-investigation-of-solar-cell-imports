India  is probing allegations that
suppliers from the U.S., China, Taiwan and Malaysia sold solar
cells in the South Asian nation below cost and whether
retroactive duties should be imposed.  There’s “sufficient prima facie evidence” to warrant an
investigation into the dumping claims filed by local
manufacturers  Indosolar Ltd. (ISLR) , Jupiter Solar Power Ltd. and
 Websol Energy System Ltd. (WESL) , India’s Ministry of Commerce and
Industry said in a Nov. 23  statement  on its website.  The investigation will include imports of both crystalline-
silicon and thin-film photovoltaic cells sold in the country
between Jan. 1 and June 30, 2011. Suppliers, importers and users
of the cells have until Jan. 2 to respond to the allegations, it
said.  India joins a trade dispute among the world’s biggest
economies as the solar-manufacturing industry grapples with
overcapacity and declining profits. The U.S. set final duties on
Chinese solar-cell imports on Oct. 10 and the European Union is
investigating whether Chinese manufacturers are selling cells
and panels at a loss.  China  started its own probe this week to
determine if U.S., European and South Korean suppliers are
dumping polysilicon, the raw material used in panels.  To contact the reporter on this story:
