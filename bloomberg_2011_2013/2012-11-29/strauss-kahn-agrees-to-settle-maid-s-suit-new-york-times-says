Former International Monetary Fund
head  Dominique Strauss-Kahn  agreed to settle a lawsuit brought
by a hotel maid who accused him of trying to rape her, the  New
York  Times reported, citing unidentified people with knowledge
of the matter.  Details of the settlement, such as monetary damages,
couldn’t be determined today and the settlement hasn’t yet been
signed, the newspaper said, citing one of the unidentified
people. The two sides are scheduled to appear before New York
State Supreme Court Justice Douglas E. McKeon in the Bronx next
week, the Times reported.  The maid’s attorneys,  Kenneth Thompson  and Douglas Wigdor,
didn’t immediately respond to messages seeking comment on the
New York Times report, and Marina Ein, a spokeswoman for
Strauss-Kahn’s lawyers in the case, William Taylor III and Amit
Mehta, didn’t immediately respond to an e-mail.  Strauss-Kahn, 63, was pulled off an Air France flight at
 John F. Kennedy International Airport  on May 14, 2011, arrested
and charged with trying to rape the maid, Nafissatou Diallo, a
housekeeper at the Sofitel in midtown  Manhattan .  Diallo filed a civil lawsuit against Strauss-Kahn in the
Bronx in August, weeks before Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance Jr. dropped the criminal charges against Strauss-Kahn
after concluding that Diallo had lied about events surrounding
the alleged attack.  The case is Diallo v. Strauss-Kahn, 11-307065, New York
State Supreme Court (Bronx County).  To contact the reporter on this story:
