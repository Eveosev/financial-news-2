TAV Havalimanlari Holding AS (TAVHL) ,
 Turkey ’s biggest airport operator part-owned by  Aeroports De
Paris (ADP) , will sign a loan agreement for 250 million euros ($325
million) with a group of lenders coordinated by  UniCredit SpA (UCG) ,
two people with knowledge of the deal said.  An agreement for the loan will be signed in  London  tomorrow
and used to finance the airport project in Izmir town, Turkey’s
third largest city, said the people who asked not to be
identified because the process is confidential.  European Bank for Reconstruction & Development, Siemens
Bank GmbH, Black Sea Trade & Development Bank and  Denizbank TAS (DENIZ) ,
a Turkish lender owned by  OAO Sberbank (SBER)  of  Russia , also
contributed to the loan, the people said. The maturity of the
loan, which is non-recourse to the owners, is longer than 12
years, they said.  Silvia Lamberti, a spokeswoman for UniCredit, and a TAV
spokeswoman, who asked not to be named, declined to comment.  TAV, in which Aeroports De Paris bought a 38 percent stake
this year, won the 610 million-euro government concession
contract last year to build and operate the airport until 2032.
It will expand the area of the domestic passenger terminal at
the airport to 204,500 square meters by 2015 from 28,500 square
meters.  TAV shares fell 0.2 percent to 8.78 liras at 3:07 p.m.
