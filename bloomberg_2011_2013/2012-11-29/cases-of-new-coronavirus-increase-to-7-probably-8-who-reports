The number of people infected with
the new coronavirus in the  Middle East  rose to seven, with
another probable case, as the  World Health Organization 
recommended other countries increase monitoring for the bug.  All eight cases have been reported in  Saudi Arabia  in the
areas around Jeddah and  Riyadh , and in Doha, Qatar, the Geneva-
based WHO said in an  update  on its website.  The source of the virus and the means of transmission is
unclear, though genetic evidence suggests it’s most closely
related to a coronavirus found in bats, the WHO said. All eight
cases are male, though the significance of that isn’t known, the
United Nations agency said.  “The newly reported cases demonstrate that the virus has
persisted over a period of at least five months and is
geographically distributed over a wider area than was evidenced
by the first two cases,” the WHO said. “Given that the exact
extent of the distribution is unknown, WHO is taking the
precaution of recommending an expansion of surveillance to
monitor for the appearance of the virus in other countries.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
