South African white-corn futures
declined as the rand gained against the dollar, making grain
imports cheaper. Yellow corn and wheat also fell.  White corn for March delivery, the most active contract,
dropped 0.7 percent to 2,502 rand ($286) a metric ton by the
close in Johannesburg. The yellow variety for delivery in July,
declined 0.3 percent to 2,400 rand a ton.  The rand rose for a sixth day, increasing 0.7 percent to
8.7552 a dollar at 1:39 p.m.  “As a result of the stronger rand, prices have moved
lower,” Lindy van Blommestein, a trader at Farmwise Grains
(Pty) Ltd., said by phone from Johannesburg.  South Africa  is the continent’s largest producer of corn.
Meal made from the white variety is used as one of its staple
foods, while yellow corn is mainly used as  animal feed .  Wheat for March delivery declined 0.2 percent to 3,833 rand
a ton.  To contact the reporter on this story:
