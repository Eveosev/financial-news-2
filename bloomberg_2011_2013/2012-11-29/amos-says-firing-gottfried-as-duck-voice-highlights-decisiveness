Dan Amos, chief executive officer of
 Aflac Inc. (AFL) , said the decision to fire comedian Gilbert Gottfried
as voice of the insurer’s duck mascot in the U.S. shows the
importance of quick action to protect the company’s reputation.  Amos ended Aflac’s relationship with Gottfried within 30
minutes, after being told of his remarks about tsunami victims
in Japan, the company’s  biggest market , the executive said today
at a lunch sponsored by the  Boston  College Chief Executives’
Club of Boston.  “Events proved to me that when you’re decisive and
transparent and ultimately trying to do the right thing, it will
reflect on your company and on your image,” Amos said.  Gottfried posted messages on Twitter that made light of the
deadly flooding in  Japan , the  Daily Mail  reported on its
website in March 2011. A month later, Aflac hired Dan McKeague,
the sales manager from a Minneapolis radio station, as the voice
of the duck mascot in the U.S. Columbus, Georgia-based Aflac
launched the duck campaign in 2000 to elevate awareness of its
supplemental insurance.  The job involves more than “just getting behind a
microphone and yelling ‘Aflac’ over and over,” McKeague said
after his hiring. The role requires “doing interviews, doing
appearances and continuing to be an upstanding citizen.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
