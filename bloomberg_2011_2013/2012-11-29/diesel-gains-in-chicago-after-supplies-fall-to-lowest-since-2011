Diesel fuel in  Chicago  strengthened
against New York futures after regional supplies fell to the
 lowest level  in a year. A crude unit at  BP Plc (BP/) ’s Whiting
refinery remains shut.  Distillate inventories in the Midwest fell by 751,000
barrels to 24.4 million in the week ended Nov. 23, the lowest
since Nov. 18, 2011, according to Energy Department data. That’s
the  third consecutive  weekly decline. Pipestill 12, the largest
crude unit at Whiting, is in a planned turnaround, according to
a person familiar with the situation.  Ultra-low-sulfur diesel  gained 1.5 cents in Chicago to 14
cents a gallon over heating oil futures on the  New York
Mercantile Exchange  at 12:41 p.m. That’s the widest gap since
Nov. 19 and the third consecutive advance. The same fuel rose
0.25 cent to 2.75 cents a gallon over futures in the Mid-
Continent region, or Group 3.  BP’s Whiting, the largest refinery in the Midwestern region
known as PADD 2, can process 420,000 barrels a day. Pipestill 12
has a capacity of 235,000 barrels a day, according to the
person, who isn’t authorized to speak on the issue and asked not
to be identified.  To contact the reporter on this story:
