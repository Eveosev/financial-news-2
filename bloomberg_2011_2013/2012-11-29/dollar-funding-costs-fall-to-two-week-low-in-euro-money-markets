The cost for European banks to
borrow in dollars fell to the lowest in more than two weeks,
according to a money-markets indicator.  The three-month cross-currency  basis swap , the rate banks
pay to convert euro interest payments into dollars, was 26 basis
points below the euro interbank offered rate at 8:25 a.m. from
minus 27.5 yesterday, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
The measure is the lowest since Nov. 12.  The one-year basis swap was 28 basis points below Euribor
from minus 29 yesterday. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  A measure of European banks’ reluctance to make unsecured
loans to one another was little changed. The difference between
Euribor and overnight index swaps, known as the Euribor-OIS
spread, was 12.4 basis points, down from 12.75 on Nov. 23, the
highest since the start of October.  The European Banking Federation’s euro overnight index
average, or Eonia, of unsecured lending deals was set at 0.073
percent yesterday from 0.072 percent the day before. The Eonia
swap, an estimate of average overnight borrowing costs over the
next three months, was little changed at 6.3 basis points.  Lenders increased  overnight deposits  at the European
Central Bank yesterday to 245 billion euros ($318 billion) from
242 billion euros the day before.  To contact the reporter on this story:
