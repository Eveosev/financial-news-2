Retalix Ltd. (RTLX)  rose the most on record
in Tel Aviv after  NCR Corp. (NCR)  said it will buy the maker of
supermarket software for $650 million, the third-biggest
acquisition in  Israel  this year.  Retalix jumped 32 percent to 112.40 shekels, or the
equivalent of $29.45 in Israel, the steepest advance since the
Ra’anana-based company started trading in 1996. Volume was more
than 50 times the three-month daily average. Israel’s  TA-25
Index (TA-25)  rose 0.3 percent to 1,229.97. Retalix’s  U.S.-traded shares 
soared 35 percent yesterday.  NCR, the world’s biggest supplier of automated teller
machines, yesterday said it will pay $30 per share for Retalix.
Duluth, Georgia-based NCR said it will finance the buyout
through cash and debt which is expected to be completed in 2013.
The takeover ranks behind Paradigm Ltd.’s Aug. 30 sale to Apax
Partners LLP and JMI Management Inc. for $1 billion, and Israeli
businessman Shlomo Eliahu’s $913 million purchase of  Migdal
Insurance & Financial Holding Ltd. (MGDL)  last month.  “Retalix was apparently destined to have a bigger
partner,” Saar Golan, head of equities at Clal Finance Batucha
Brokerage Ltd. in Tel Aviv, said today by phone. “This is more
evidence that Israeli technology is very interesting and
contributes to big global companies. We expect to see more
acquisitions.”  RedPrairie Buyout  Retalix’s software and services are used at over 70,000
retail locations in more than 50 countries, the two companies
said in a statement. NCR said it expects the acquisition to
bolster the software it can offer to financial, travel and
hospitality clients.  Shares of NCR yesterday retreated 0.9 percent to $23.75
before trading was halted at 3:15 p.m. in  New York  after Israeli
daily Calcalist reported the deal. Retalix’s stock trading
resumed at 4:30 p.m. and it rose to $29.73 after hours.  The advance sent the  Bloomberg Israel-US Equity Index (ISRA25BN)  of
the largest New-York traded Israeli companies 1.2 percent higher
in its seventh day of gains, the longest stretch of increases
since July 2011.  The offer is a 37 percent premium to Retalix’s closing
price on Nov. 27, putting the transaction “on par” with
RedPrairie Corp.’s planned purchase of  JDA Software Group Inc. (JDAS) ,
a $1.9 billion deal announced on Nov. 1 that merges two
providers of software for managing corporate supply chains,
Uerkwitz said.  RedPrairie Corp., backed by private-equity firm New
Mountain Capital LLC, will pay a 33 percent premium over
Scottsdale, Arizona-based JDA’s stock price on Oct. 26.  Australian Deal  Retalix reported third-quarter revenue of $70.5 million on
Nov. 14, compared with $61.5 million a year earlier. The company
said on Nov. 12 that its technology will be used in more than
3,000 Woolworths Ltd. retail stores in  Australia  and  New
Zealand .  Israel, which has a population of similar size to
Switzerland’s, has about 60 companies traded on the Nasdaq Stock
Market, the most of any country outside the U.S. after China.
The nation is also home to more startup companies per capita
than the U.S.  Alon Holdings Blue Square-Israel Ltd. (BSI) , the country’s
second-largest food retailer, surged the most in eight weeks in
New York, advancing 13 percent to $2.68 as the company closed
supermarket branches to cut costs. Shares in Tel Aviv slipped
0.3 percent today to 10.01 shekels, or the equivalent of $2.62.  Mellanox Technologies Ltd. (MLNX) , the Israeli maker of products
used to transfer and store data, fell the most in six weeks on
concern slowing corporate spending on technology will depress
revenue. Mellanox tumbled 9.6 percent to $76.23 in New York. Its
shares in  Tel Aviv  today dropped 11 percent to 289.90 shekels,
or $75.95.  “Investors are wondering when they’ll get greater
certainty into the demand environment,” Brian Freed, an analyst
at Wunderlich Securities Inc. who has a buy rating on Mellanox,
said by phone from Denver yesterday. “Demand has struggled this
year, and although Mellanox bucked the trend for 2012, there’s
concern as to whether corporate buyers will horde cash or
spend.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
