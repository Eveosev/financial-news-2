Brian McCullough, a managing
director at  Citigroup Inc. (C) ’s Asia-Pacific financial institutions
group, has left after less than two years with the bank, two
people with knowledge of the matter said.  McCullough was hired in March 2011 to lead Citigroup’s
capital advisory services for financial institutions across the
region. His departure comes after fundraising by the industry
fell short of expectations, one of the people said, asking not
to be identified because the information is private.  The value of convertible bonds sold by financial-services
companies in the Asia-Pacific Region outside of Japan has
slumped 66 percent this year to $1.97 billion compared with all
of 2011, data compiled by Bloomberg show. Share sales by such
firms are down 9 percent.  James Griffiths , a Hong Kong-based spokesman at Citigroup,
and McCullough both declined to comment.  McCullough joined Citigroup from PacBridge Capital Partners
last year. He was a managing director at Morgan Stanley before
moving to PacBridge Capital.  To contact the reporter on this story:
