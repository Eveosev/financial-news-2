Yemen LNG began producing liquefied
natural gas from its Gulf of Aden plant after an October
pipeline attack there halted output, two people familiar with
the operations said.  A tanker docked at the plant yesterday to load fuel chilled
to a liquid for transport by ship, said the people, including a
Yemen LNG official, who declined to be identified because they
weren’t authorized to speak to the press.  The pipeline supplying the plant was sabotaged Oct. 30 in
the seventh attack in a year, Yemen LNG said on Oct. 31.  Total
SA (FP)  is the company’s biggest shareholder.  Yemen, located on the southeastern tip of the Arabian
Peninsula and bordering  Saudi Arabia  and Oman, is struggling to
recover from protests that weakened the central government’s
authority and forced former President Ali Abdullah Saleh from
power a year ago. The 320-kilometer (199-mile) pipeline network
supplying the plant runs through a region that’s home to al-
Qaeda-linked militants.  The LNG tanker Grace Cosmos docked Nov. 25 in the Yemeni
port of Belhaf, where Yemen LNG’s plant is located, according to
ship tracking data compiled by Bloomberg. The vessel V.K.
Mugungwha was off Belhaf yesterday morning, the data show.  To contact the reporters on this story:
