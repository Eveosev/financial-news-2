Glencore International Plc (GLEN) , seeking
a $33 billion takeover of  Xstrata Plc (XTA)  by the end of the year,
may retain its credit rating at Standard & Poor’s after
completing the deal to create the fourth-biggest miner.  The credit quality of the combined group, to be named
Glencore Xstrata Plc, is in line with the current BBB  rating ,
“reflecting the group’s strong business risk profile and
significant financial risk profile,” S&P said today in a
statement.  Glencore received European Union approval for its takeover
of Xstrata last week, moving it closer to completing the world’s
biggest deal this year with regulatory approval in  China  and
South Africa the only remaining hurdles. Glencore is seeking to
add Xstrata’s coal, nickel, zinc and copper operations to its
cotton-to-crude-oil commodities empire.  S&P estimates the combined company’s earnings before
interest, tax, depreciation and amortization this year to be $13
billion to $14 billion and its adjusted debt will be near $40
billion following the planned takeover of  Viterra Inc. (VT)   “The group’s financial risk profile is constrained by
substantial debt, which we expect to rise sharply in 2012 and
keep increasing in 2013 because of the ambitious capital
expenditure program and a number of already-contracted
acquisitions” S&P said.  The ratings company may study a “positive rating action
over the medium term, if free cash flow turned very positive in
2014 and the group was committed to reducing debt,” it said.  Moody’s last week confirmed its Baa2 ratings on Glencore
and Xstrata.  To contact the reporter on this story:
