Citigroup Inc. (C)  raised a $612 million
collateralized loan obligation for BlackRock Inc., according to
a person with knowledge of the deal.  The fund includes a $360 million slice rated AAA that pays
a rate of 139 basis points more than the London interbank
offered rate and a second $12 million piece with the same grade
that pays 214 basis points more than the benchmark rate, said
the person, who asked not to be identified because the terms are
private. Libor is the rate at which banks say they can borrow in
dollars from each other.  CLOs are a type of collateralized debt obligation that pool
high-yield, high-risk loans and slice them into securities of
varying risk and return.  To contact the reporter on this story:
