Canada ’s  current account  deficit
widened to the second largest on record between July and
September as exports of goods fell faster than imports.  The deficit grew to C$18.9 billion ($19.1 billion) in the
third quarter from C$18.4 billion in the previous three months,
 Statistics Canada  said today in Ottawa. Economists surveyed by
Bloomberg forecast a C$19.2 billion deficit according to the
median of 16 responses.  The shortfall in Canada’s broadest measure of international
trade has widened for four straight quarters, underlining the
increasing global strains on the world’s 11th-largest economy
where exports account for one-third of output. Tomorrow Canada
will probably report that third-quarter gross domestic product
slowed to a 0.8 percent annualized pace, according to economists
surveyed by  Bloomberg News .  The deficit in traded goods widened to C$4.84 billion from
C$3.64 billion in the third quarter, Statistics Canada said
today.  Exports of goods fell C$3.7 billion to C$112.7 billion and
imports fell C$2.5 billion from a record high to C$117.6
billion.  The third-quarter deficit lags only the C$19.4 billion set
in the third quarter of 2010, according to Statistics Canada
figures.  In a separate report, the agency also said its index of
 raw-materials prices  paid by manufacturers was unchanged in
October, while the median estimate in a Bloomberg survey of
seven economists was for a 1 percent decrease. Crude  oil prices 
rose 0.5 percent while metal prices declined, the report said.  The  industrial product price index , what factories are paid
for their goods, fell 0.1 percent in October from September,
while economists forecast 0.2 percent decline according to the
median estimate in a Bloomberg survey with 11 responses.  Over the 12 months ending in October, industrial prices
fell 0.2 percent while raw-materials costs fell 2.8 percent,
suggesting factory profit margins widened.  To contact the reporter on this story:
