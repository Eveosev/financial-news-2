Wheat futures fell for the first
time in five sessions on signs of declining demand for supplies
from the U.S., the world’s biggest exporter.  Export sales  in the week through Nov. 22 totaled 279,337
metric tons, down 56 percent from a week earlier, the U.S.
Department of Agriculture said today. Since June 1, overseas
buyers have agreed to  purchase  16.2 million tons, down 10
percent from the same period a year earlier, USDA data show. The
government said Nov. 9 that  exports  would rise 4.8 percent.  “Demand bearishness has reared its head after the export-
sales report came out,” Mike Zuzolo, the president of Global
Commodity Analytics & Consulting in Lafayette,  Indiana , said by
telephone.  Wheat futures for March delivery slid 0.6 percent to close
at $8.855 a bushel at 2 p.m. on the Chicago Board of Trade. The
price has gained 36 percent this year as dry weather reduced
global production 6.4 percent to a five-year low.  The grain climbed 3.7 percent in the previous four sessions
as dry weather eroded conditions for winter varieties grown in
the U.S. Great Plains. About 78 percent of  Kansas , the biggest
grower of the variety, was in extreme or exceptional drought as
of Nov. 27, compared with 36 percent a year earlier,  data  from
the weekly U.S. Drought Monitor show.  Wheat is the fourth-largest U.S. crop, valued at $14.4
billion in 2011, behind corn, soybeans and hay, government data
show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
