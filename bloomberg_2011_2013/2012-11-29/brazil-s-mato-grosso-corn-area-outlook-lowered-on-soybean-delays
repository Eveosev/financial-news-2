Farmers in  Brazil ’s Mato Grosso
state will plant less corn than expected as a second crop after
soybean sowing was delayed, researcher Instituto Mato-Grossense
de Economia Agropecuaria forecast.  Field work was delayed by a lack of rain, and the need to
replant soybeans in some municipalities means farmers in the
state will seed 2.79 million hectares (6.89 million acres) with
corn, less than the 2.92 million hectares expected last month,
Cuiaba, Brazil-based IMEA wrote in a  report  dated Nov. 23 and
posted online this week.  The researcher said it’s keeping a yield forecast of 80
bags (4.8 metric tons) of corn per hectare, and predicts a Mato
Grosso crop of 13.3 million tons in 2012-13. About 5.8 percent
of it has already been sold, IMEA said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
