India  will conduct open-market debt
purchases next week for the first time since June to ease a
shortage of cash in the banking system.  The  Reserve Bank  of India will offer to buy on Dec. 4 as
much as 120 billion rupees ($2.2 billion) of notes due in 2018,
2020, 2022 and 2027, the monetary authority said in a statement
yesterday. Borrowings by lenders from the central bank have
exceeded 1 trillion rupees a day for the past 11 days,
indicating a cash squeeze. Banks  borrowed  1.01 trillion rupees
from the central bank yesterday, according to official data.  “With repo borrowings consistently above one trillion
rupees and the 10-year bond yields edging higher, the bond
buying was anticipated,” said J. Moses Harding, executive vice
president at  IndusInd Bank Ltd. (IIB)  in Mumbai.  India’s 10-year sovereign bond  yield  has climbed 17 basis
points to 8.21 percent from a 14-month low of 8.04 percent in
June.  Funds at Indian banks declined because of slower  government
spending  and a surge in customer withdrawals during this month’s
festival season, according to Fullerton India Credit Co., which
is owned by a unit of  Singapore ’s state-owned Temasek Holdings
Pte, and Nomura Holdings Inc.,  Japan ’s largest brokerage. The
Hindu festival of Diwali was celebrated on Nov. 13.  The Indian government had a cash balance of more than 700
billion rupees as on Nov. 22, two finance ministry officials
with direct knowledge of the matter said last week. That
indicates the government scaled back spending, according to
Vivek Rajpal, a fixed-income strategist in Mumbai at Nomura.  Tax Payments  Local lenders borrowed an  average  931 billion rupees a day
from the  Reserve Bank of India  this month, compared with 671
billion rupees in October, official data show. The central bank
has bought 820 billion rupees of debt since April 1 to boost the
availability of funds.  Cash at banks may decline further as companies pay
quarterly taxes by Dec. 15, according to Arvind Chari, a senior
 fund manager  at Quantum Asset Management Co. in Mumbai. That may
drain between 500 billion rupees to 650 billion rupees from the
financial system, he said.  IndusInd’s Harding predicts the RBI may announce a further
reduction in the amount of cash banks need to set aside as
reserves, last cut by a quarter of a percentage point to 4.25
percent on Oct. 30, to overcome the cash crunch.  The cash reserve  ratio  has been cut by 175 basis points
this year.  “A CRR cut would be required as the bond purchases in
itself won’t be enough to satisfy the liquidity deficit,” said
Harding, who predicts the 10-year bond yield may touch 8.15
percent next week.  The RBI will buy 8.24% 2018 bonds, 8.19% 2020 securities,
8.15% 2022 notes and 8.28% 2027 notes.  To contact the reporter on this story:
