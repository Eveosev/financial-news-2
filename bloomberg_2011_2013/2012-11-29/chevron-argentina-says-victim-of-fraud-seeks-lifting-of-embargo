The Argentine unit of  Chevron Corp. (CVX) 
asked local courts to revoke an embargo of its assets in the
country related to a $19 billion award over pollution in
 Ecuador , saying the ruling affects local operations.  “Chevron  Argentina  is victim of a fraud,” the company
said in a paid statement published in newspapers Clarin and La
Nacion today. “Chevron Argentina has never had operations in
Ecuador and has no relation with the fraudulent trial in
Ecuador.”  Judge Adrian Elcuj Miranda ordered 40 percent of Chevron’s
Argentine bank accounts to be held in escrow, Enrique Bruchou,
an Argentine attorney representing Ecuadorean plaintiffs, said
on Nov. 7.  The plaintiffs are seeking to enforce a $19 billion award
against Chevron, which they say is responsible for destroying
the environment in the Lago Agrio region, damaging living
conditions of 30,000 inhabitants. Chevron, which on Sept. 14
signed a memorandum of understanding to help develop Argentina’s
Vaca Muerta shale formation, says the Ecuador judgment is
illegitimate and the embargo is improper.  The embargo endangers “Chevron Argentina’s capacity to
operate and reinvest as the order affects more than 90 percent
of the income from crude sales,” according to today’s
statement. Those funds are used to pay salaries, royalties,
taxes and capital investments, Chevron said.  The company, which employs 1,500 people in Argentina, said
the funds should be applied to invest in Argentina to recover
the country’s capacity to supply itself with energy.  To contact the reporter on this story:
