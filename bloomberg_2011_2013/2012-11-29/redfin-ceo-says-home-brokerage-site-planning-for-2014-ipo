Redfin Corp., the online real estate
search service and brokerage, plans in 2013 to file preliminary
papers to go public with the goal of a stock sale the following
year, Chief Executive Officer Glenn Kelman said.  “We expect to be public in 2014,” he said in an interview
yesterday at Bloomberg’s  Los Angeles  offices. The Seattle-based
company is searching for a chief financial officer in
anticipation of the IPO, which is tentative, Kelman said.  “We could still screw up,” he said.  Real estate brokerage and listing companies have been
turning to public markets to raise capital as U.S. housing shows
signs of recovering from a six-year slump.  Realogy Holdings
Corp. (RLGY) , the franchiser of brokerages including Coldwell Banker
and  Sotheby’s International Realty , went public on Oct. 10.
Shares of the Parsippany, New Jersey-based company closed at
$36.72 yesterday, 36 percent above its offering price.  Zillow Inc. (Z) , a Seattle-based online listing service that
went public in July 2011, raised $79.6 million by selling 3.98
million shares, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The
stock, which rose 79 percent to $35.77 on its first day of
trading, closed yesterday at $26.40. San Francisco-based  Trulia
Inc. (TRLA) , a Zillow competitor that went public on Sept. 19, closed
at $17.02, 2 cents above its IPO price.  Redfin, unlike Trulia or Zillow, employs real estate
brokers to represent buyers and sellers.  Kelman didn’t say how much Redfin expects to raise by
selling shares to the public. The company, which began offering
brokerage services in 2006, operates in 19 markets in 14 U.S.
states and Washington, D.C.  To contact the reporter on this story:
