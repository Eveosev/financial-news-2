Center Brook Lopez will miss the
Brooklyn Nets’ next two games because of a sprained right foot,
leaving the team without its leading scorer as it seeks to
extend a four-game winning streak.  The 7-foot Lopez was diagnosed with a mild sprain and X-
rays revealed no fractures, the team said. He’ll miss tomorrow’s
 National Basketball Association  game in Orlando and a Dec. 1
game in Miami for the Nets, who are tied for first place in the
Eastern Conference’s  Atlantic Division  at 10-4.  Lopez, who is averaging 18.5 points and 6.8 rebounds a game
this season, was limited to five games last season because of
two injuries to his right foot. He sat out the Nets’ first 32
games after breaking a metatarsal bone during the preseason,
returned briefly, and then sat out the final 28 games after a
scan revealed a small fracture.  Lopez, 24, hadn’t missed a game during his first three
seasons with the Nets.  To contact the reporter on this story:
