TeliaSonera AB (TLSN) ,  Sweden ’s largest
telephone company, is set to get more than $500 million by
selling a quarter of its Kazakhstan wireless unit in an initial
public offering.  TeliaSonera seeks $10.50 to $13 for each share in the Kcell
unit, according to a statement today from the Stockholm-based
company. The IPO would value Kcell at $2.1 billion to $2.6
billion and reduce TeliaSonera’s stake to 61.9 percent from 86.9
percent. Trading is set to start Dec. 12.  The Nordic operator is selling stakes in emerging-markets
ventures to gain funds, while retaining holdings in them to
benefit from growth that’s faster than in more mature markets
such as Sweden and  Finland . OAO MegaFon, the carrier’s Russian
affiliate, began trading yesterday after TeliaSonera reduced its
stake to 29 percent through an IPO.  Shares of TeliaSonera, which has cut  jobs  and trimmed
expenses in Sweden and Finland, rose 0.6 percent to 44.29 kronor
at 9:11 a.m. Stockholm time. The  stock  had dropped 5.9 percent
this year through yesterday, valuing the company at 191 billion
kronor ($29 billion).  To contact the reporter on this story:
