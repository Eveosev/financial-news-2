Advance Auto Parts Inc. (AAP) , the
retailer said to be exploring a sale, fell the most in more than
six months after the New York Post reported that deal talks with
private-equity firms have sputtered.  The shares tumbled 5.3 percent to $73.93 at the close in
New York, for the biggest one-day drop since May 17. The stock
had gained 10 percent this month through yesterday, after the
company on Nov. 2 was said to be working with  Blackstone Group
LP (BX)  on strategic options including a sale, according to a person
with knowledge of the matter who declined to be named.  While the seller of  car batteries  and motor oil had been
talking to several investment firms, only KKR & Co. remains in
the running, the Post said today. The Roanoke, Virginia-based
company, with more than 3,700 stores, had been seeking a sale
price of as much as $6 billion, the newspaper said.  The auction, now in its second round, has “fizzled out,”
the Post reported, citing a source close to the process that it
didn’t identify. The sales process was “ambitious” because a
buyer would need to pay more than seven times earnings before
interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, a measure known
as Ebitda, the newspaper said, citing another unnamed source.  Advance Auto reported Ebitda of $840.6 million in 2011,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  “We do not comment on rumors and/or speculation,” Shelly Whitaker, an Advance Auto spokeswoman, said in an e-mail.  Kristi Huller, a KKR spokeswoman, declined to comment on
the Post report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
