Lithuania has frozen 805 million
litai ($303 million) of assets belonging to the former owners of
defunct lender Snoras Bankas AB and people linked to them, the
Prosecutor’s Office said.  Investigations are continuing into Vladimir Antonov and
Raimondas Baranauskas amid fraud allegations over the lender’s
collapse, according to an e-mailed statement today from the
capital, Vilnius. The two men, who are fighting extradition to
the Baltic nation in a London court, deny wrongdoing.  -- Editors: Andrew Langley, Paul Abelsky  To contact the reporters on this story:
