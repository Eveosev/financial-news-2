U.S. home-price gains this year
weren’t large enough to justify an increase in the maximum size
of loans that  Fannie Mae  and  Freddie Mac (FMCC)  will purchase in 2013,
the companies’ regulator said today.  The two government-owned companies will continue to
purchase loans up to a maximum of $417,000 in most areas next
year, the same as the current year’s limit. In high-cost areas,
such as  Los Angeles  and Washington, D.C., the upper limit will
remain at $625,500, the  Federal Housing Finance Agency   said .  Home-price gains averaging between 4 and 4.4 percent
nationally were not enough to offset a 19 percent decline in
 home prices  through 2011, the agency said. Federal law governing
the two companies requires that prior price declines are offset
before an increase can occur.  Fannie Mae (FNMA)  and  Freddie Mac  provide liquidity to the housing
market by purchasing mortgages and packaging them into
securities on which they guarantee payments of principal and
interest. That frees up banks to make new loans.  The ceiling that the two government-sponsored enterprises
set for the loans they will purchase effectively caps the size
of most U.S. mortgages because banks are reluctant to make loans
they can’t sell. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac now back about two-
thirds of home loans.  The limits for loans purchased by Fannie Mae and Freddie
Mac will remain lower than the limits insured by the  Federal
Housing Administration  for a second year.  Under pressure from the real-estate industry, Congress last
year raised the maximum size of mortgages backed by the FHA to
$729,750, from $625,500, through 2013. Lawmakers didn’t enact
higher limits for the government-owned companies at the same
time.  Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac have been operating under U.S.
conservatorship since September 2008, when investments in risky
loans pushed them to the brink of bankruptcy.  To contact the reporter on this story:
