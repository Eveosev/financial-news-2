St. Jude Medical Inc. (STJ) , the second-
largest manufacturer of heart rhythm devices, authorized a share
buyback program for as much as $1 billion amid a U.S. regulatory
review for the manufacturing of one of its key products.  The purchases will occur on the open market or in privately
negotiated transactions with cash on hand or other readily
available funds, the St. Paul, Minnesota-based company said
today in a statement. It had 308 million shares outstanding as
of Nov. 28.  St. Jude’s shares plunged the most in three years last week
after U.S. government inspectors criticized the way it
manufactured and tested the Durata wire that connects a life-
saving defibrillator to the heart. Some doctors have raised
questions about the safety of the Durata, which replaced the
older Riata wires the company recalled last year. St. Jude says
it is actively monitoring Durata patients and there are no signs
of increased risk of failure with the device.  “This share repurchase program demonstrates the confidence
our board and management team have in the long-term prospects
for St. Jude Medical,” Chief Executive Officer Daniel Starks
said in the statement. “We remain committed to delivering
superior results and value to our shareholders.”  St. Jude  rose  2.4 percent to $33.69 at the close in New
York before the buyback program was announced. The shares have
lost 23 percent since their three-month peak of $43.69 on Oct.
