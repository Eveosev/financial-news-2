Electricite de France  tumbled to a
record low in Paris after the country’s highest court, the
Conseil D’Etat, ruled that the company overcharged households.  The  shares fell  as must as 6.2 percent, the biggest decline
since July 20. They were 3.4 percent lower at 13.79 euros as of
9:48 a.m., their lowest level since the stock began trading in
November, 2005. About 1.6 million shares changing hands in the
first 30 minutes of trading, more than its average daily volume
in the last three months of 1.4 million.  EDF shares were the  biggest decliners  on the benchmark  CAC
40 Index (CAC) , which rose as much as 0.8 percent. The company’s 30-
day  volatility , a measure of stock swings, increased to 27.5
today, the highest since Aug. 31.  EDF has overcharged households by a total by 8.8 billion
euros ($11.4 billion) since 2009, said Sipperec, the body that
filed the complaint against EDF.  “The amount of 8.8 billion represents a big dent in the
group’s financial capacity and an adverse effect on cash
flows,” Citigroup analyst Sofia Savvantidou said in a note.  EDF’s distribution unit ERDF said it has no knowledge about
a possible repayment to customers. It said it is up to the
energy regulator to decide on how it wants to apply the ruling.  Studying Response  French Energy Minister Delphine Batho said the government
is studying its response. EDF spokeswoman  Carole Trivi  declined
to provide immediate comment.  The Conseil d’Etat cancelled the rate charged by ERDF to
consumers between 2009 and 2013 following a complaint by the
Sipperec group of Paris region municipalities.  French electricity customers should be reimbursed 1.9
billion euros for each of four years that the group said ERDF
overcharged, according to a statement from Sipperec.  To contact the reporters on this story:
