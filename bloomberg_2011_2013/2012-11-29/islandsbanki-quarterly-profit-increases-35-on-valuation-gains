Islandsbanki hf , the state-created
successor to failed Glitnir Bank hf, said third-quarter profit
surged 35 percent as impairments on financial assets declined.  Net income rose to 4.49 billion kronur ($36 million) from
3.33 billion kronur a year earlier, the Reykjavik-based bank
said in a statement today. Net valuation changes on loans and
receivables jumped to a 713 million-krona profit, from a 576
million-krona loss a year earlier.  Glitnir collapsed in October 2008 after it was unable to
secure short-term funding. The Icelandic government then
established Islandsbanki out of Glitnir’s domestic assets. A
year later, 95 percent of Islandsbanki’s shares were taken over
by a resolution committee representing Glitnir’s creditors. The
Icelandic government owns 5 percent.  “There are clear signs that the financial markets are more
active than in recent years,” Chief Executive Officer Birna Einarsdottir said in the statement. The bank has managed a bond
sale by Eik, a real-estate company, the largest private sector
bond offering since late 2008, and oversaw the listing of
Eimskip shares and is working on the planned listing of Vodafone
shares, she said.  Islandsbanki’s capital-adequacy ratio was 24.3 percent,
compared with 22.6 percent in the end of 2011, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
