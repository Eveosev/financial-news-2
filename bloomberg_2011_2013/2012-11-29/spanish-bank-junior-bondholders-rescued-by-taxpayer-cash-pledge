European taxpayers are helping foot
the bill for saving junior bondholders of Spain’s nationalized
banks from being wiped out, an official at the country’s central
bank said.  Bankia SA (BKIA)  parent Banco Financiero y de Ahorros SA, created
by the merger of seven regional savings banks, will swap its
junior debt for shares at valuations between 54 percent and 86
percent of face value, the lender said  yesterday . Losses would
be higher if Spain’s bank bailout fund, backed by the European
Union, hadn’t pledged to inject as much as 18 billion euros
($23.3 billion) into the bank, said the official, who briefed
reporters on condition of anonymity.  BFA-Bankia, the country’s largest nationalized bank, had a
negative valuation of 13.63 billion euros in June when the
rescue fund known as FROB took control of the lender. That
compares with about 7 billion euros of BFA-Bankia’s subordinated
debt, a type of security that lenders issue to build loss-
absorbing buffers.  To contact the reporter on this story:
