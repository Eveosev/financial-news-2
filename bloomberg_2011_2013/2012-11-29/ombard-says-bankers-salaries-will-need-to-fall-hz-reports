Thierry Lombard, a senior partner at
Lombard Odier Darier Hentsch & Cie., expects bankers’ salaries
to decline as stricter regulation hurts earnings, Handelszeitung
reported, citing an interview.  Before the outbreak of the financial crisis, bankers were
paid at least four times more than their equivalents in industry
compared with parity in the 1970s when Lombard started working
at Lombard Odier, he told the newspaper.  “This ratio isn’t justifiable,” Lombard said. “In future
you won’t be able to pay that much anymore because of stricter
rules and regulation will stop making this possible, in
particular in  investment banking .”  To contact the reporter on this story:
