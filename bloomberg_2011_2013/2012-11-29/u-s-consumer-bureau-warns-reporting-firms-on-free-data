The U.S. Consumer Financial
Protection Bureau has warned six specialty reporting companies
that they may be violating federal rules on providing easy
access to consumer records.  Kent Markus, the assistant director of enforcement at the
bureau, said the firms, which weren’t named in the announcement
today, may be breaking a rule of the Fair Credit Reporting Act
that requires them to provide consumers a “streamlined” way to
access their free reports.  Nationwide specialty reporting companies are a subset of
the broader group of firms led by  Experian Plc (EXPN) ,  Equifax Inc. (EFX)  and
 TransUnion Corp. (TRUN)  The specialty players are typically much
smaller, and include closely held firms and units of larger
ones, such as  CoreLogic Inc. (CLGX) , whose business Teletrack is used
by some short-term lenders. Other firms collect data on rental
history and check writing.  “Nationwide specialty consumer reporting agencies can have
great influence over a consumer’s tenancy, insurance premiums,
or even employment,” Richard Cordray, the CFPB director, said
in an e-mailed statement. “Today, the CFPB is reminding these
companies that they must follow the law and provide consumers
with easy access to their free annual report. If we have reason
to believe that companies are not following the law, we will
take action.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
