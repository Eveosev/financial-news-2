Renewable Energy Corp. ASA (REC) , the
Norwegian solar company that shut its only local production unit
this year, rallied the most since 2008 in Oslo after a rival
filed for bankruptcy, raising chances an industry glut may ease.  REC surged 21 percent, the most since Nov. 24, 2008, to
close at 0.84 krone after South Korea’s Hankook Silicon Co.
filed for court receivership in  Seoul . More than 73 million
shares traded, more than triple the three-month daily average.  “Hankook accounts for about 6 percent of global
production, so this contributes to a better balance in the
market, which is positive for the players left,” Haakon Levy,
an analyst at DNB Markets in Oslo, said today by telephone.  REC and other makers of polysilicon, the main raw material
used in solar panels, are struggling with low prices after Asian
peers expanded, outpacing demand growth. Hankook, owned by  Osung
LST Co. (052420) , has about 14,000 metric tons of polysilicon capacity,
compared with 21,500 tons at Sandvika-based REC, Levy said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
