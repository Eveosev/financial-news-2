(Corrects company name in headline and first paragraph.)  Serbia may hire Lufthansa Consulting
GmbH or  Tasc Aviation  as an adviser in the planned overhaul of
JAT Airways,  Vecernje Novosti  reported, citing an unidentified

to renew the fleet of state-owned JAT, which will include four
 Airbus SASâ€™s (EAD)  A319 or A320 planes, depending on advice from the
consultant, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
