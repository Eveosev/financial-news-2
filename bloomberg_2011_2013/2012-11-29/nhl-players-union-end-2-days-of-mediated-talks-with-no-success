The National Hockey League and its
players union ended two days of talks involving federal labor
mediators without making enough progress to warrant continuing
the negotiations.  The two sides met under the guidance of the Federal
Mediation and Conciliation Service in an effort to reach a new
collective bargaining agreement and end a player lockout now in
its 11th week.  “We concluded two days of mediation with FMCS mediators
and representatives of the NHL Players’ Association,” NHL
Deputy Commissioner Bill Daly said yesterday in a statement
posted on the league’s website.  “After spending several hours with both sides over two
days, the presiding mediators concluded that the parties
remained far apart and that no progress toward a resolution
could be made through further mediation at this point in time,”
Daly said. “We are disappointed that the mediation process was
not successful.”  The labor dispute has forced the cancellation of more than
a third of the regular season so far, including the outdoor
Winter Classic, plus the All-Star Game.  NHLPA Executive Director Don Fehr also said the mediators
did not think it would be productive to continue the discussions
at this time.  “The mediators indicated that they would stay in contact
with the league and the NHLPA, and would call the parties back
together when they thought the time was right,” Fehr said in a
statement released by the union.  To contact the reporter on this story:
