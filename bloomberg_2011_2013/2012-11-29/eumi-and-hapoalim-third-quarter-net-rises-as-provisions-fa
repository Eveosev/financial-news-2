Bank Hapoalim Ltd. (POLI) ,  Israel ’s second-
largest lender by assets, said net income rose 33 percent in the
third quarter, beating analysts’ estimates, as provisions
dropped and fees rose.  The Tel Aviv-based bank posted profit of 625 million
shekels ($163 million) in the three months to Sept. 30, beating
the median of four analysts’  estimates  compiled by Bloomberg for
599.75 million shekels. Provisions declined to 286 million
shekels from 498 million shekels a year earlier, and fees and
other income rose 5.5 percent, the bank said.  “Hapoalim is showing the highest profit of the sector and
the highest return on equity,” said Adi Scop, a banking analyst
and head of sales at Tel Aviv-based I.B.I. Israel Brokerage &
Investments Ltd. “This stems from good financing income and
control over costs.”  Scop, who expected a 600-million shekel profit for
Hapoalim, said Israeli lenders may find it more difficult to
maintain growth as Israel’s economy slows.  The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development
cut its Israel growth forecast for 2012 to 3.1 percent on Nov.
27, from a May estimate of 3.2 percent. The body also reduced
its growth projection for next year to 2.9 percent from the
previous 3.6 percent. Israel’s jobless rate rose in October, the
 Central Bureau of Statistics  said yesterday, and the  Bank of
Israel  held the benchmark  interest rate  at 2 percent on Nov. 26
after a surprise 0.25 percentage point cut in October.  ‘More Challenging’  “Next year is going to be probably more challenging,”
Hapoalim Chairman Yair Seroussi said in an interview on
Bloomberg Television today.  Ran Oz, Hapoalim’s chief financial officer, said cost-
cutting efforts at the bank will continue as well as a trend
toward a lower concentration of big borrowers, a situation the
regulator has defined as posing risk.  “The results don’t yet reflect the economic slowdown,”
I.B.I. Israel’s Scop said in a phone interview. “We may see the
slowdown in coming quarters.”  Hapoalim shares rose for a second day this week in  Tel
Aviv , adding 2.6 percent, the most since Oct. 22, to 15.72
shekels at the 4:30 p.m. close. The Tel Aviv Banking Index was
up 2.2 percent to 1,123.76 and the benchmark TA-25 gauge
increased 0.3 percent to 1,229.97.  Bank Leumi Le-Israel Ltd. (LUMI) , Israel’s largest lender by
assets, said third-quarter net income tripled to 479 million
shekels as provisions fell 23 percent. The median of four
analysts estimates for Leumi profit was 532 million shekels,
 data  compiled by Bloomberg show.  Israel Discount Bank Ltd. (DSCT) , the third-biggest bank, said net
in the third quarter nearly doubled to 221 million shekels,
beating the 193.75 million-shekel median estimate, even as money
put aside for bad debt increased to 233 million shekels from 226
million shekels.  Discount rose 3.3 percent to 5.70 shekels and Leumi added
1.3 percent to 12.88 shekels.  To contact the reporters on this story:
