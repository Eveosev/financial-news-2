The pound was within 0.4 percent of
a five-week low against the euro after an industry report showed
U.K. house prices stagnated this month, adding to evidence
Britain’s economic recovery is losing momentum.  Sterling headed for a fourth monthly decline versus the 17-
nation currency as a rallies in Spanish and Italian bonds in
November, damped demand for the U.K. currency as a haven from
 Europe ’s debt crisis. House values may drop “modestly” over
the next year because of subdued wage growth, Nationwide
Building Society said. Gilts held gains from yesterday after the
Bank of England said overseas investors increased their holdings
of U.K. government bonds last month.  “The picture for sterling is going to turn more
negative,” said Ian Stannard, head of European currency
strategy at Morgan Stanley in London. “Sterling has been
relatively well supported by safe-haven flows from Europe but
these flows are slowing. That is going to expose sterling to its
underlying fundamentals, which I don’t think are positive.”  The pound was little changed at 80.85 pence per euro at
4:56 p.m.  London  time after depreciating to 81.14 pence on Nov.
27, the weakest since Oct. 24. The currency gained 0.1 percent
to $1.6025, having dropped 0.6 percent this month.  Sterling will weaken to 83 pence per euro by the end of
March, Morgan Stanley’s Stannard said.  The average cost of a U.K. home was 163,853 pounds in
November, Swindon, England-based Nationwide said in an e-mailed
statement. From a year earlier, prices declined 1.2 percent.  ‘Decline Modestly’  “House prices are likely to remain broadly flat or decline
modestly over the next 12 months,” the company’s chief
economist Robert Gardner said in the statement. Mortgage
approvals increased for a fourth month in October, the Bank of
England said yesterday.  Spain’s 10-year  bond yield  dropped to the lowest level in
eight months today, while similar-maturity Italian yields
declined to the least in two years. The Stoxx Europe 600 Index
of shares gained 1.2 percent.  Spanish bonds have returned 1.9 percent this month and
 Italy ’s have gained 2.4 percent, according to indexes compiled
by Bloomberg and the European Federation of Financial Analysts
Societies. U.K. gilts gained 0.7 percent.  Sterling has dropped 0.4 percent in the past month,
according to Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes, which track
10 developed-market currencies. It has still appreciated 1.3
percent this year as the euro-area debt crisis spurred demand
for safer assets.  Non-residents bought 4.31 billion pounds more gilts than
they sold last month, after increasing their holdings by 1.84
billion pounds in September, the Bank of England said.  The yield on the benchmark 10-year gilt fell two basis
points to 1.75 percent after dropping eight basis points, or
0.08 percentage point yesterday. The 1.75 percent bond maturing
in September 2022 traded at 99.99.  To contact the reporter on this story:
