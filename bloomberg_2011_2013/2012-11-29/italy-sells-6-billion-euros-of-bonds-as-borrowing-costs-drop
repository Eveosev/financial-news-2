Italy sold 10-year debt at the
lowest rate in two years amid increasing optimism on the outlook
of the euro crisis after the region’s finance ministers reached
an agreement on Greek aid.  Italy sold 3 billion euros ($3.88 billion) of its 5.50
percent 10-year benchmark bond at 4.45 percent, the lowest since
November 2010, and down from 4.92 percent at the last auction on
Oct. 30. Investors bid for 1.18 times the amount of bonds
offered, down from 1.43 times last month.  The Rome-based Treasury also sold 3 billion euros of a 2017
bond to yield 3.23 percent, the lowest since October 2010, down
from the 3.80 percent paid at an auction a month ago. Italy
matched the maximum target for the auction. Investors bid for
1.65 times the amount of securities offered, down from 1.49
times last month.  Euro-group ministers would consider taking steps to ease
 Greece ’s bailout terms, they said in a statement after a Nov. 26
meeting in Brussels. Italy’s bond yields have fallen since
European Central Bank President Mario Draghi said in July that
he would do what’s needed to keep the euro and followed in
September by announcing a bond-buying program for nations in
financing stress.  Still, as Italy is mired in its fourth recession since
2001, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development
said this week that Prime Minister Mario Monti’s efforts to
reduce the deficit won’t allow the country to start trimming the
euro region’s second-biggest debt next year.  Italy’s 10-year yield declined 6.9 basis points to 4.52
percent at 11:18 a.m. in  Rome , narrowing the difference with
comparable maturing German debt to 313.9 basis points.  The Treasury sold yesterday 7.5 billion euros of six-month
bills at the lowest yield on a similar note in more than 2 1/2
years. The day before the borrowing costs at an auction of 3.5
billion euros of zero-coupon bonds fell to the lowest since
October 2010.  To contact the reporter on this story:
