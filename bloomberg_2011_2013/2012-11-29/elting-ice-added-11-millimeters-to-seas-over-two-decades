Oceans worldwide rose by an average
of about 11 millimeters (0.43 inches) from 1992 to 2011 as ice
sheets near both poles melted, according to an article to be
published tomorrow in the journal  Science .  Researchers evaluated multiple sets of satellite data from
the past 20 years to measure the effect of melting ice near the
Earth’s poles, said  Ian Joughin , a professor at the University
of  Washington  and an author of the article.  The results paint a more accurate picture of climate change
than studies based on a single set of satellite data, he said
during a conference call yesterday. That information may aid
efforts to hammer out a treaty as representatives from more than
190 nations gather in Doha for two weeks of United Nations
climate talks, the researchers said.  “We have a 20-year record of ice-sheet mass balance, and
we’re worried about what’s going to happen over the next 100
years,” Joughin said.  As the Earth heads for its ninth-hottest year, the
researchers also found ice in Greenland is melting about five
times faster than in the 1990s and that the east and west coasts
of the U.S. and some other low-lying areas may have experienced
even larger increases in sea levels.  While the researchers can’t predict exactly how much more
the seas may rise or how quickly, “we can see that the trend is
toward increases,” Joughin said. “And that’s something we do
need to worry about.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
