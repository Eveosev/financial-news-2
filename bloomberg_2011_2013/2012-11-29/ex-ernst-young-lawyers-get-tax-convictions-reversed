Two former Ernst & Young LLP tax attorneys, Richard Shapiro and Martin Nissenbaum, won reversal of their convictions for developing illegal tax shelters sold by the accounting firm from 1999 to 2001.  A three-judge panel of the  U.S. Court of Appeals  in  New York  ruled 2-1 that the convictions weren’t supported by sufficient evidence. The court today also affirmed guilty verdicts against former Ernst & Young tax lawyer Robert Coplan and a former accountant at the firm, Brian Vaughn. The four were convicted after a 10-week trial in 2010.  Jurors found that the former Ernst & Young executives sold illegal shelters to wealthy clients based on fraudulent factual scenarios. That helped the clients reduce or eliminate tax liabilities on incomes of more than $10 million.  The scheme generated billions of dollars in paper losses used to offset taxes owed, prosecutors said. The government lost $2 billion in taxes in a scheme that involved about 40 people, the judge said.  The four were members of New York-based Ernst & Young’s VIPER Group, which stood for Value Ideas Produce Extraordinary Results.  Tax Evasion  Each of the four was convicted of one count of conspiracy and two counts of  tax evasion . Coplan was also found guilty of obstructing the  Internal Revenue Service  and making false statements. Nissenbaum, a former national director of Ernst & Young’s personal income tax and retirement planning practice, was found guilty of obstruction. Vaughn was convicted of making false statements.  In its decision today, the court also affirmed a 15-month prison sentence imposed on a fifth man in the case, Charles Bolton, an  investment adviser  who pleaded guilty to a single count of conspiracy. The court threw out a $3 million fine against Bolton, sending the matter back to the trial court to reduce it to $250,000, which the court said was the maximum allowed under the law.  Ernst & Young, which wasn’t charged, said it cooperated with the government’s investigation.  Ellen Davis , a spokeswoman for U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara in  Manhattan , declined to comment on the ruling.  The case is U.S. v. Coplan, 10-583, U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit (Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story: Bob Van Voris in New York federal court at   rvanvoris@bloomberg.net .
