ElSwedy Electric Co. (SWDY) ,  Egypt ’s
biggest publicly traded cables seller, reported an 82 percent
drop in third-quarter profit as delays in government delays in
approving equipment weighed on revenue.  Net income declined to 35 million Egyptian pounds ($5.7
million) from 196 million pounds in the same period a year
earlier, the company said in a statement to the Egyptian bourse
today. The net income figure missed estimates by investment
banks Beltone Finance for a profit of 169 million pounds and
EFG-Hermes for 135 million pounds.  Revenue from the company’s transformers business declined
61 percent “due to delays by the Egyptian government in testing
and inspecting” power transformers, Tarek Yehia, ElSwedy’s
investor relations manager, said by phone from Cairo.  ElSwedy’s turnkey projects revenue was down 54 percent due
to delays in obtaining letters of credit for the company’s
business in sub-Saharan  Africa , he said. “Government
bureaucracy is causing delays in obtaining signatures for the
letters of credit in sub-Saharan Africa,” Yehia said.  ElSwedy’s shares rose 6 percent at the 2:30pm close in
Cairo to 22.24 Egyptian pounds. Its shares have risen 7.2
percent for the year, compared with a gain of 32.7 percent for
the benchmark EGX 30 index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
