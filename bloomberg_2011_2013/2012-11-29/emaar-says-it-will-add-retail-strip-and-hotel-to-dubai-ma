Emaar Properties PJSC (EMAAR)  said it will
expand the Dubai Mall, the world’s biggest, by adding a shopping
boulevard lined with restaurants and water attractions.  The extension will include luxury homes, serviced
apartments and a hotel, the company said in an e-mailed
statement today. Construction will begin soon and the work will
be completed in phases, it said without specifying the number of
homes.  Emaar’s $20 billion Downtown Dubai project is centered
around  Burj Khalifa , the world’s tallest tower. In February, the
developer said it will add 1 million square feet (92,903 square
meters) to the Dubai Mall as it capitalizes on retail and
hospitality growth.  Emaar, the emirate’s biggest publicly traded developer,
will cooperate with Dubai Holding LLC to build a new district in
in the emirate that includes an even bigger mall. The project,
known as MBR City, is designed to include gardens bigger than
 London ’s Hyde Park, a theme park and art galleries. Another
development announced this week will have five theme parks set
to cost 10 billion dirhams ($2.7 billion).  To contact the reporter on this story:
