Barcelona’s  Lionel Messi  will try to
win the Ballon d’Or as the world’s best soccer player for the
fourth year in a row after being named a finalist along with
teammate  Andres Iniesta  and Real Madrid’s Cristiano Ronaldo.  Messi joins Ronaldo, the 2008 winner, and Spain’s Iniesta
in the running for the prize, which will be announced Jan. 7 in
Zurich. Brazil’s Marta, a five-time winner, and Alex Morgan and
 Abby Wambach  of the U.S. are the female finalists.  Vicente del Bosque, who led world champion Spain to the
2012 European title, Barcelona’s Pep Guardiola and Real Madrid’s
 Jose Mourinho  are the nominees for coach of the year for men’s
teams. France’s Bruno Bini, Norio Sasaki of Japan and Pia Sundhage, the Swede who led the U.S. to the Olympic title, are
the women’s nominees.  Messi became Barcelona’s all-time leading scorer in 2012 by
netting his 233rd goal in March and broke the mark for Champions
League goals in a single season with 14. He’s scored 82 goals so
far this year, closing in on Gerd Muller’s record of 85.  Iniesta was named best player in the European Championships
that took place this year in Poland and  Ukraine  as Spain
defended its title. Ronaldo’s 46 goals pushed Real Madrid to the
Spanish title, and the player took Portugal to the semifinals of
the Euros.  To contact the reporter on this story:
