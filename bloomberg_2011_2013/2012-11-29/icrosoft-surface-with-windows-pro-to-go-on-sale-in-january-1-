Microsoft Corp. (MSFT)  said its Surface
tablet computer running the new Windows 8 Pro software will go
on sale in January, the first versions of the machine that run
on  Intel (INTC)  Corp. chips.  Surface tablets with Windows 8 Pro will cost $899 for a
version with 64 gigabytes of memory, and $999 for a 128-gigabyte
model. They run on Intel’s Core i5 processor, giving the
machines a graphics boost, Redmond, Washington-based Microsoft
said today in a blog  post .  Microsoft hasn’t disclosed how many units it has sold of
the Surface that runs on a chip with  ARM Holdings Plc (ARM) 
technology, which went on sale last month for $499 to $699. The
price for the Intel-based iteration, which doesn’t include the
tablet cover with a built-in keyboard that is one of Surface’s
key features, may be too high for many users.  “At that price, by the time you add the keyboard you’re at
the price of an 11-inch MacBook,” said Wes Miller, an analyst
at Kirkland, Washington-based Directions on Microsoft, referring
to Apple Inc.’s laptop computer. “Everyone always says, ‘well,
Apple is so expensive,’ but here we are in that same
neighborhood looking at houses.”  Still, Miller said the price for the Surface with Windows 8
Pro is more reasonable if a user is planning to have the machine
double as a tablet and a full personal computer. For example,
customers could put the machine in a dock and use it alongside a
larger screen to replace desktop computers, he said.  “But if you’re looking at it as just a tablet, it is
pricey,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
