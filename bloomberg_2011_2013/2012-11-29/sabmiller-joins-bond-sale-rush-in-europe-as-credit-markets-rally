SABMiller Plc (SAB)  raised 1 billion euros
($1.3 billion) from its first sale of bonds in the currency in
three years as companies from  G4S Plc (GFS)  to  TeliaSonera (TLSN)  AB tapped
into Europe’s credit-market rally.  The world’s second-biggest brewer issued the notes due
January 2020 to yield 70 basis points more than the swaps rate,
according to people familiar with the deal. Debt issuance will
top at least 16.4 billion euros this week, the busiest since
Sept. 16 and above the year’s weekly average of 14 billion
euros.  Companies are taking advantage of a rally that pushed the
cost of insuring the region’s bank debt to near the lowest in 16
months as they raise funds before the holiday period. Corporate
bonds in  Europe  yield a record low 2.2 percent, Bank of America
Merrill Lynch’s EMU Corporate  index  shows.  “These are the last weeks before the holidays, so the last
chance to issue this year,” said Harold Van Acht, senior credit
analyst at Kempen Capital Management NV in Amsterdam. “Both
absolute yield and credit spread levels are generally attractive
for issuers and investors still want to put cash to work.”  London-based SABMiller last sold bonds in euros in July
2009 when it raised 1 billion euros of notes due January 2015
priced to yield 170 basis points more than the benchmark swaps
rate, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  TeliaSonera,  Sweden ’s largest telephone company, sold 400
million pounds ($641 million) of bonds due in 30 years, its
first deal in the currency, at a spread of 135 basis points more
than gilts, according to people familiar with the transaction.
British security provider G4S marketed 500 million euros of six-
year bonds at 167 basis points more than swaps.  Bilfinger Debut  Also in the market for the first time is German power
company Bilfinger, offering 500 million euros of seven-year
bonds that will yield 115 basis points more than swaps. The
securities were initially marketed with a spread of about 135
basis points.  Bonds of Spanish utilities  Iberdrola SA (IBE)  and Gas Natural SA
were the best performers today in Bank of America Merrill
Lynch’s EMU Corporates Non-Financials  index . The yield on
Bilbao-based Iberdrola’s 4.125 percent notes due 2020 fell 12.3
basis points to 250 basis points more than benchmark German
government debt. That’s the smallest gap since March 23. The
spread on Gas Natural’s 5.125 percent 2021 notes shrank seven
basis points to 384.  Credit-Default Swaps  Credit-default swaps insuring Spanish government debt fell
as much as 12.5 basis points to 277, approaching the lowest
level in 16 months. Contracts on Italy dropped as much as 11
basis points to 236, the lowest since Oct. 18.  The Markit iTraxx Financial Index linked to senior debt of
25 European banks and insurers dropped five basis points to 159
at 3 p.m. in  London , approaching the lowest in 16 months. The
subordinated index fell six basis points to 279.  The Markit iTraxx Crossover Index of swaps on 50 companies
with mostly junk credit ratings declined 14 basis points to 493.
The Markit iTraxx Europe Index of contracts on 125 companies
with investment-grade ratings dropped three basis points to 122.  A basis point on swaps contract a protecting 10 million
euros of debt from default for five years is equivalent to 1,000
euros a year. The derivatives pay the buyer face value in
exchange for the underlying securities or the cash equivalent
should a borrower fail to adhere to its debt agreements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
