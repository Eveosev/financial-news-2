The Australian dollar dropped
against its U.S. counterpart after business investment slowed
from the previous quarter amid manufacturing weakness.  The Aussie fell versus all of its 16 most-traded peers as
capital spending  gained  2.8 percent in third quarter, down from
3.4 percent in the second quarter, the Bureau of Statistics said
in Sydney yesterday. That compares with the median forecast for
a 2 percent gain in a Bloomberg News survey of 20 economists.
The New Zealand dollar decreased against most of its major
counterparts even as equities and commodities rose.  “Deteriorating domestic fundamentals and terms of trade
suggest that the Aussie is likely to remain vulnerable,” Dara Blume, a London-based foreign-exchange analyst at  Morgan
Stanley (MS) , wrote yesterday in a note to clients. “The Australian
dollar appears to be losing its appeal as an investment
currency.”  Australia ’s currency depreciated 0.4 percent to $1.0435
yesterday in New York, its biggest drop on a closing basis since
Nov. 15. It declined 0.4 percent to 85.69 yen.  The New Zealand dollar, nicknamed the kiwi, sank 0.1
percent to 82.27 U.S. cents. It decreased 0.1 percent to 67.56
yen.  The Standard & Poor’s GSCI Index of raw materials increased
1.1 percent and crude-oil futures gained 1.4 percent to $87.68
per barrel in New York. The  S&P 500 Index (SPX)  rose 0.4 percent.  New Zealand’s dollar has strengthened 4.3 percent this
year, the biggest increase among the 10 developed-nation
currencies monitored by the Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted
Indexes, and the Aussie has gained 0.3 percent. The U.S. dollar
has fallen 2.2 percent and the yen has dropped 9 percent to lead
decliners.  To contact the reporter on this story:
