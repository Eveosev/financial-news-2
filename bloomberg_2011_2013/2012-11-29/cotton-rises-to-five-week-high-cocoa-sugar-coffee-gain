Cotton rose to a five-week high on
optimism that U.S. lawmakers will reach a budget accord,
avoiding a fiscal cliff that would hurt the economy and cut
commodity use. Cocoa, sugar, coffee and orange juice gained.  The world economy is in its best shape in 18 months as
China’s prospects improve and the U.S. seeks to avoid the tax
increases and spending cuts known as the fiscal cliff, according
to the Bloomberg Global Poll of investors. The Standard & Poor’s
GSCI Spot Index of 24 raw materials rose for the first time in
four days.  “There is a certain amount of optimism that’s causing
people to buy all commodities,”  Sid Love , the president of Joe
Kropf & Sid Love Consulting in  Overland Park ,  Kansas , said in a
telephone interview. “We will see support in the market until
speculators decide to bail out again.”  Cotton for March delivery climbed 1 percent to settle at
73.35 cents a pound at 2:29 p.m. on ICE Futures U.S. in  New
York . Earlier, the price reached 73.98 cents, the highest for a
most-active contract since Oct. 24.  The fiber has dropped 20 percent this year as global
inventories swelled.  Cocoa futures for March delivery climbed 1.3 percent to
$2,491 a metric ton on ICE.  Raw-sugar futures for March delivery rose 0.9 percent to
19.34 cents a pound.  Arabica-coffee futures for March delivery advanced 1
percent to $1.564 a pound.  Orange-juice  futures for January delivery increased 0.7
