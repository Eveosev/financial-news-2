Indonesian sovereign bonds rallied,
pushing the yield on the five-year notes to near an eight-month
low, after foreign funds boosted holdings to a record due to a
lack of supply of new securities. The rupiah declined.  Overseas investors added 17.6 trillion rupiah ($1.8 billion)
to their local-currency sovereign  debt portfolios  this month,
taking ownership to 267.9 trillion rupiah on Nov. 27, finance
ministry data show. The government will offer 1 trillion rupiah
of six-month and one-year bills on Dec. 3, the  last  auction this
year, it said in a statement yesterday. It canceled a Nov. 27
sale and bought 500 billion rupiah of notes from the secondary
market this week.  “We can see bonds rallying further until the end of the
year after the sale,” said Raditya Ariwibowo, a research
analyst in the treasury division at PT Bank Negara  Indonesia  in
Jakarta. “The government may conduct more debt switches and
buybacks in order to support the market.”  The yield on the 10 percent securities maturing in July
2017 declined one basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, to
5.034 percent as of 9:02 a.m. in Jakarta, prices from the Inter
Dealer Market Association show. The yield reached 5.025 percent
on Nov. 19, the lowest level since March 6.  Foreign funds have pulled $40 million from Indonesia stocks
this week, taking monthly net sales to $366 million, exchange
data show.  The rupiah weakened 0.1 percent to 9,608 per dollar, prices
from local banks compiled by Bloomberg show. One-month implied
volatility, a measure of expected moves in exchange rates used
to price options, was steady at 4.40 percent, the lowest level
since August 2008.  To contact the reporter on this story:
