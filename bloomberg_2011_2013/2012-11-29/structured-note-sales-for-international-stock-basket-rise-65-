U.S. investors are buying 65 percent
more notes linked to a basket of U.K., European and Japanese
stock indexes this year, spurred by a 12 percent average gain in
the benchmarks since May.  Banks have sold $908 million of U.S. notes tied to the  Euro
Stoxx 50 Index (SX5E)  of the 50 largest euro-area companies, the U.K.’s
FTSE 100 Index, and  Japan ’s  Tokyo Stock Price Index (TPX) , known as
the Topix Index, making the basket the most popular this year,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. They issued $549
million of the securities during the same period last year.  Investors are increasingly looking overseas now that
concerns have eased that  Europe ’s sovereign debt crisis will
worsen, said Michael Gayed, chief investment strategist at
Pension Partners LLC and a portfolio manager of the ATAC
Inflation Rotation Fund in  New York .  “You had this tremendous negative narrative over the end
of Europe and it caused prices to fall so much that you had
almost fire sale levels,” Gayed said.  The Euro Stoxx 50 has climbed 20 percent since the end of
May, after dropping 8.5 percent during the first five months of
2012.  Investing in notes linked to international stock indexes
could “potentially be a significant shift” away from domestic
stock benchmarks such as the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index, said
Eric Greschner, co-founder and portfolio manager at Regatta
Research & Money Management LLC.  Surging Sales  Sales of securities linked to the basket containing the
Euro Stoxx 50, FTSE 100 and Topix have surged 76 percent this
month from October. Issuance of notes tied to both the  S&P 500 
and  Russell 2000  Index fell 51 percent during the same period.  The S&P 500 and Russell 2000 basket is the second-most
popular this year, accounting for $492.2 million in U.S. sales.  Euro Stoxx 50 returns have a 55 percent weighting in the
five top-selling notes tied to the international equity basket
this year, according to prospectuses filed with the U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission.  The Topix, which comprises 1,675 companies listed on the
first section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange, accounts for 23
percent. The FTSE 100 Index, the stock benchmark of the 100
largest companies traded on the London Stock Exchange, makes up
22 percent.  Lower Correlation  Baskets that contain components that are less correlated to
each other are less volatile, making certain options embedded in
the structured notes cheaper to buy. Issuers can then offer
better terms on the securities.  Daily price moves in the Euro Stoxx 50 were .85 correlated
with the  FTSE 100 Index (UKX)  and .28 with the Topix this year,
Bloomberg data show. That compares with .92 for the S&P 500 and
Russell 2000.  Credit Suisse Group AG (CS)  issued $51.4 million of one-year
notes on Aug. 10 tied to the group of international stock
indexes, the largest such sale this year. The notes yield twice
the gains of the basket to a limit of 19.2 percent, with
protection from the first 10 percent of losses, according to a
 prospectus  filed with the SEC.  Banks create structured notes by packaging debt with
derivatives to offer customized bets to retail investors while
earning fees and raising money. Derivatives are contracts whose
value is derived from stocks, bonds, commodities and currencies,
or events such as changes in  interest rates  or the weather.  To contact the reporter on this story:
