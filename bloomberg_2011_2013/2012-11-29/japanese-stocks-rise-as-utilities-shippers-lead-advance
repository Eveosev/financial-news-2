Japan  stocks  rose, with the  Nikkei
225 (NKY)  Stock Average rebounding from yesterday’s loss, after
Goldman Sachs Group Inc. said shares will benefit from policy
changes if the opposition wins next month’s election.  Honda Motor Co. (7267) , which gets 44 percent of its revenue in
North America, rose 2 percent on optimism for a budget agreement
in the U.S. to avoid the so-called fiscal cliff. Shikoku
Electric Power Co. paced gains among utilities on expectations
it will seek a 10 percent rate increase. All Nippon Airways Co.
climbed 4.1 percent on a report the carrier will gain eight new
berths at Tokyo’s Haneda airport.  Sharp Corp. (6753)  gained 3.1 percent
on a Wall Street Journal report the electronics maker is in
talks with Dell Inc. for $240 million in  capital investment .  The Nikkei 225 gained 1 percent to close at 9,400.88 in
Tokyo after yesterday falling 1.2 percent, the biggest decline
in three weeks. The broader Topix Index climbed 1 percent to
779.44, with more than two stocks advancing for each that fell.  “Investors are hoping the election will diminish
frustration with politics following confusion in the wake of the
earthquake,” said Koji Toda, chief  fund manager  at Tokyo-based
Resona Bank Ltd., which oversees about 15 trillion yen ($183
billion). “People are buying Japanese shares because prices are
too low, even with the economy in a rut.”  The Topix advanced 7.9 percent from Nov. 14, when Prime
Minister  Yoshihiko Noda  called for elections next month, causing
the yen to drop on speculation the opposition  Liberal Democratic
Party  will win and call for more monetary easing.  Goldman Forecast  The Topix will reach 930 within a year, Goldman strategists
led by Kathy Matsui wrote in a report dated today, saying
Japanese companies will have a 20 percent profit increase in the
fiscal year starting in April.  If the LDP takes power as polls suggest, “we would expect
policies aimed at combating deflation, including public works
investment, possible corporate tax cuts and a re-think of the
nuclear phase-out plan,” Matsui wrote in the note. LDP leader
Shinzo Abe reiterated calls today for unlimited monetary easing
until inflation reaches 2 percent.  The Topix traded at 0.9 times book value, compared with 2.1
for the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index and 1.5 for the Europe Stoxx
600 Index. A number less than one means that companies can be
bought for less than the value of their assets.  Futures on the  S&P 500  rose 0.3 percent today. The index
rose 0.8 percent yesterday after Republican House Speaker  John
Boehner  told reporters he is optimistic budget talks can avert
the fiscal cliff of automatic tax increases and spending cuts
next year that could spur a global recession.  Companies linked to the U.S. gained, with Honda adding 2
percent to 2,726 yen.  Canon Inc. (7751) , a camera maker that gets 31
percent of its revenue in the Americas, rose 1.1 percent to
2,849 yen.  Utilities Advance  Shikoku Electric added 2 percent to 1,100 yen after the
Nikkei reported the utility will request a 10 percent household
rate increase. Chubu Electric Power Co. gained 3.5 percent to
1,100 yen, while Chugoku Electric Power Co. rose 3.5 percent to
1,198 yen.  Airlines gained after  Kyodo News  reported ANA will get
eight new slots at Haneda airport while Japan Airlines Co. will
add three. ANA rose 4.1 percent to 178 yen. JAL climbed 0.9
percent to 3,750 yen.  Sharp added 3.1 percent to 169 yen after the Wall Street
Journal reported the loss-making electronics company in talks
for as much as $240 million in investment from Dell. Sharp has
had its ratings cut to junk and is the world’s worst-performing
major stock this year.  Nakayama Steel  Nakayama Steel Works Ltd. (5408)  surged 55 percent to 62 yen after
falling as much as 13 percent. It’s in talks with at least five
banks led by Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group Inc. to waive 60
billion yen of loans after three years of losses, bank officials
with knowledge of the talks said.  The  Nikkei Stock Average Volatility Index (VNKY)  dropped 1.8
percent to 17.36, indicating traders expect a swing of about 5
percent on the benchmark gauge over the next 30 days. Trading
volume on the Nikkei 225 was 12 percent below the 30-day
average.  Toyota Motor Corp. (7203)  led declines in China production among
Japanese automakers in October after a dispute over East China
Sea islets led to violent demonstrations in China and a boycott
of Japanese products. Toyota added 1.2 percent to 3,515 yen even
after its output in China fell 61 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
