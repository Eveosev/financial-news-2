Thailand ’s 10-year government bond
yield traded near its lowest level in more than two weeks after
Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra survived a no confidence vote
in Parliament yesterday. The baht was little changed.  Yingluck, whose party won a parliamentary majority in the
July 2011 election, received support from 308 members, while 159
voted to oust her after a debate on the government’s handling of
the economy and allegations of corruption in a state rice
program. The central bank kept its benchmark interest  rate 
unchanged at 2.75 percent yesterday, signaled it may be done
with easing as the economy is improving. That’s higher than 0.25
percent in the U.S. and 0.1 percent in  Japan .  “The political situation is stable after the government
survived the no-confidence vote,” said Disawat Tiaowvanich, a
foreign-exchange trader at  Bangkok Bank Pcl. (BBL)  “Foreigners may
want to continue buying bonds here.”  The yield on the 3.625 percent securities due June 2023 was
little changed at 3.497 percent as of 8:33 a.m. in Bangkok,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. That’s the lowest level
since Nov. 12.  Global funds bought $217 million more sovereign notes than
they sold this week through yesterday, taking a net purchase
this year to $28 billion, according to data from the Thai Bond
Market Association.  The baht was little changed at 30.73 per dollar from 30.72
yesterday, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. One-month
implied volatility, a measure of expected moves in exchange
rates used to price options, dropped 21 basis points, or 0.21
percentage point, to 4.09 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
