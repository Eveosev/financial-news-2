House Speaker  John Boehner  says he’s open to a budget deal with President  Barack Obama . He may need Democratic help to push any agreement through his chamber.  Pressure from at least 60 small-government  House Republicans , most backed by the anti-tax  Tea Party , means Boehner must construct a plan for averting the so-called fiscal cliff that can win some Democratic votes. Congress is trying to head off more than $600 billion in automatic spending cuts and tax increases set to begin in January.  “Everybody’s for fixing the problem until you get into the weeds,” said Ron Bonjean, who was an aide to Republican former Speaker Dennis Hastert of  Illinois . “Serious divisions are going to likely slow this process down.”  Boehner, 63, of  Ohio , and other Republicans, have called on Obama to propose a way to cut spending and trim entitlement programs in exchange for more  tax revenue . All sides are trying to craft an agreement that would satisfy the president, congressional leaders of both parties and, for Boehner, enough Republican lawmakers for the math to work in the 435-member House.  The speaker was in a similar position in negotiating the 2011 budget deal that set up the automatic spending cuts as a condition of raising the  debt ceiling , following a standoff that took the U.S. near a default. With 218 votes needed, the plan was  passed  with support from 174 Republicans and 95 Democrats. Opposing it were 66 Republicans and 95 Democrats.  ‘Very Difficult’  “I know this is a very difficult time for our speaker and our leadership. So, I have great sympathy for John Boehner,” Representative Dan Burton, an Indiana Republican, said in an interview this week. “Obama is in the driver seat.”  Today, Boehner said Obama must “get serious” about the fiscal cliff. Following a meeting today with Treasury Secretary  Timothy Geithner  and a telephone conversation with the president last night, Boehner told reporters there has been no substantial progress in the discussions in the past few weeks.  While Boehner dismissed any notion that talks between him and the White House have broken down, he said, “I am disappointed in where we are. I am disappointed in what’s happened over the last couple of weeks.”  Geithner also was meeting today with the other three top leaders in Congress.  Stocks Rise  Stocks rose today. The  Standard & Poor’s (SPX)  500 Index increased 0.4 percent to 1,415.06 at 1:04 p.m. in  New York . The  Dow Jones Industrial Average  rose 36.48 points, or 0.3 percent, to 13,021.59.  Republicans oppose Democrats’ proposal to let the George W. Bush-era tax cuts expire Dec. 31 for top earners. Boehner has rejected a suggestion by Republican House member Tom Cole of  Oklahoma  that party members accede to the president’s demand that Congress extend the tax cuts for families with incomes of less than $250,000 a year.  The number of Republican votes for any deal this time may fluctuate, said Representative Jeff Flake, an  Arizona  Republican who won a Senate seat in November. He will vote in the House in the current lame-duck session.  “It depends on the agreement, it really does,” Flake said in an interview.  Representative Allyson Schwartz, a Pennsylvania Democrat, said that regardless of what agreement may be reached, Boehner probably will lose at least 50 to 60 votes among Republicans who earlier opposed bipartisan measures to raise the debt ceiling and stopgap spending bills to keep the government operating.  ‘Big Stuff’  “It really is a question the Republicans will have to decide, if they’re going to work with us,” she said in an interview. “That’s how we’ve gotten all the big stuff before.”  Republicans hold the House majority with 241 seats to the Democrats’ 192, with two vacancies. In January, Democrats will gain eight seats.  “We don’t discuss votes, but we’re pleased with the support for the framework offered by the leaders to avert the fiscal cliff without raising tax rates,”  Kevin Smith , a Boehner spokesman, said in a statement.  At least 51 of the 55 Tea Party-backed House members were re-elected Nov. 6, cementing their influence in budget negotiations. In addition, the principles of the Republican Study Committee, a group of 165 lawmakers that promotes small government, align with those of the Tea Party on fiscal issues.  Diverse House  “It’s a very diverse body and rightly so. We have a first responsibility to represent our district back home, not the speaker’s opinion,” Representative James Lankford, an Oklahoma Republican, said in an interview, while emphasizing his support for Boehner as a negotiator.  Anti-tax, small government Republicans say a deal between Obama and congressional leaders can’t raise tax rates and must include an overhaul of entitlement programs such as Medicare. Spending cuts of about $109 billion to discretionary programs slated for 2013 must be part of a deal, according to Representative Tim Huelskamp, a Kansas Republican.  Putting off those cuts is “unacceptable,” and concessions on increasing tax rates for any income level “would be political suicide” for the party, said Huelskamp, a Tea Party caucus member re-elected for a second term.  Tax Breaks  Even the most strident anti-tax Republicans -- including Huelskamp, Raul Labrador of  Idaho ,  Jim Jordan  of Ohio and Tom McClintock of  California  -- have said they would be open to increasing tax revenue in a deal to avoid the fiscal cliff, mostly by ending or limiting some tax breaks. They continue to oppose increasing tax rates.  “Every conservative is OK with closing loopholes,” Labrador said during a “conversation with conservatives” event in  Washington  on Nov. 14. “What we want to make sure is that we don’t have marginal rates go up and that the overall tax burden remains the same.”  Representative Mike Coffman, a Colorado Republican, said Boehner would have a “hard time selling an increase in marginal tax rates to the conference.”  “We will be probably willing to support raising revenue through closing loopholes and deductions,” Coffman, a member of the Tea Party caucus, said in an interview. “The line would be drawn that we don’t want marginal rates to go up and that we want the Bush tax cuts extended and permanent.”  Medicare, Medicaid  Without an agreement from Democrats to overhaul Medicare and Medicaid, Boehner may risk the support of many Republicans. Democrats have said  Social Security  is off the table.  Dissent from fellow Republicans in 2011 posed the biggest test to Boehner’s first year as speaker. Amid Republican opposition to tax increases, talks between Boehner and Obama on a long-term deficit-cutting plan to be tied to the debt-limit increase collapsed.  At the time, Boehner likened negotiating with the White House to “dealing with a bowl of Jell-O.” Obama said that at one point Boehner didn’t return his phone call, and the president complained of being “left at the altar.”  Jordan, chairman of the Republican Study Committee, voted against raising the debt ceiling last year. The ticking clock on the fiscal cliff is “a crisis that we created with legislation that was passed here,” he said.
