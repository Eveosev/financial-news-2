Research In Motion Ltd. (RIM)  gained after
 Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)  upgraded the stock to buy, saying the
new BlackBerry 10 phones could help it return to profitability
in fiscal 2014.  RIM advanced 4 percent to $11.54 in New York. The Waterloo,
Ontario-based company’s shares have gained 46 percent since the
end of October and advanced on 10 of the last 11 trading days,
though the stock is down 20 percent this year.  Goldman’s upgrade is the latest in a wave of higher analyst
 ratings  amid fresh optimism for the new BlackBerry 10 phones,
which are set to go on sale in February. While RIM’s current
BlackBerry lineup continues to lose market share to  Apple Inc. (AAPL) ’s
iOS and devices that run  Google Inc. (GOOG) ’s Android software, the new
phones may change that, said  Simona Jankowski , a Goldman
analyst.  “We now assess a 30 percent chance of success for BB10
given positive early reviews, broad-based carrier support,
attractive features, and interest by carriers and consumers in
broadening the field beyond Android/iOS,” she wrote in a
research report today.  Higher demand for the new, pricier phones should also drive
up RIM’s average smartphone selling price and deliver improved
profitability, Jankowski wrote. That should help RIM return to
profit in the fiscal year ending February 2014, with earnings of
20 cents a share, she said today. Her previous forecast was for
a loss of 52 cents a share in fiscal 2014.  Jankowski, who previously rated the stock neutral, lifted
her 12-month price target to $16 from $9.  The BlackBerry’s share of smartphone sales fell 6.9
percentage points to 1.6 percent over the 12-week period ended
Oct. 28 from a year earlier, Kantar Worldpanel ComTech said this
week in a report. The iPhone’s share more than doubled to 48
percent, fueled by the debut of a new model.  To contact the reporter on this story:
