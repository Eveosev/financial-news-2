The Ferrari Formula One team asked
the sport’s ruling body for clarification after video showed
Sebastian Vettel may have passed another racing car illegally on
the way to winning the championship at the Brazilian Grand Prix.  The footage from the Nov. 25 race shows Vettel passing Toro
Rosso driver Jean-Eric Vergne on a stretch of  Sao Paulo ’s
Interlagos circuit between a yellow light -- when overtaking is
prohibited -- and a green light.  A retroactive penalty could push the Red Bull Racing
driver down the standings and hand the title to Ferrari’s
 Fernando Alonso .  Ferrari, which sent the  Federation Internationale de
l’Automobile  a letter late yesterday, has until the end of
tomorrow to decide whether to appeal, Ferrari team spokesman
Luca Colajanni said by telephone.  The FIA says Vettel’s pass was legitimate because a race
official was waving a green flag in the 150 meters between the
two lights, Autosport.com reported, citing unidentified sources
from the ruling body.  FIA spokesman Norman Howell didn’t immediately return an
e-mail seeking comment.  Vettel, 25, finished the Brazilian race in sixth place to
win the title by three points over Alonso, who finished second
in the rain-swept event.  It was the third straight title for the German, who passed
Ayrton Senna’s mark as the youngest three-time champion.  To contact the reporters on this story:
