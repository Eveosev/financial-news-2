A Moscow court ruled that  Internet
providers  should bar access to almost all videos by the all-
female punk group Pussy Riot because of their “extremist”
nature, state television  reported .  Judge Marina Musimovich today endorsed a request by
prosecutors to ban the videos, including one in which they
staged a protect act against President  Vladimir Putin  in a
Moscow cathedral, according to television channel Rossiya 24.  Three members of Pussy Riot were convicted of hooliganism
and inciting religious hatred in August for performing a “punk
prayer” in the country’s main Christian Orthodox place of
worship, urging the Virgin Mary to “expel” Putin. A Moscow
court last month released one of them after giving her a
suspended sentence.  The case drew international condemnation and support for
Pussy Riot from pop stars such as Madonna, Sting and  Paul
McCartney . Putin praised the court ruling last month, saying the
defendants “got what they wanted.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
