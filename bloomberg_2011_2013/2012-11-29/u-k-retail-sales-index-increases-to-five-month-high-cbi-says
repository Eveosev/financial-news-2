An index of U.K.  retail sales  rose
to a five-month high in November, according to a monthly report
from the Confederation of British Industry.  The gauge of annual sales growth increased to 33 from 30 in
October, the London-based business lobby said today. Still,
sales remain below average for the time of year, while a
quarterly measure of selling prices fell to a three-year low.  Household spending rose the most in more than two years in
the third quarter, boosted by one-time factors such as the
London Olympics. The gain may prove shortlived amid subdued wage
growth and the economic headwinds from the turmoil in  Europe .
Bank of England Deputy Governor Charlie Bean said in an
interview published yesterday that policy makers haven’t ruled
out more bond purchases to boost the recovery.  The CBI’s measure of expected sales for December was 25,
indicating stores expect growth to slow next month, according to
the report. A measure of three-month sales volumes rose to 23 in
November from 11 in October.  A quarterly gauge of selling prices fell to 25 in November
from 31 in August. A measure of retailers’ outlook for the
business situation in the coming three months rose to 7, the
highest since November 2010.  The survey of 76 retailers was conducted between Oct. 30
and Nov. 16.  To contact the reporter on this story:
