Cisco Systems Inc. (CSCO) , the largest
maker of equipment for  computer networks , said it plans to buy
Cariden Technologies Inc. for about $141 million, adding tools
to manage Internet data traffic.  The deal is expected to close in the second quarter of
Cisco’s 2013 fiscal year, the San Jose, California-based company
said today in a statement. Cisco said it will pay a combination
of cash and retention incentives.  Cariden’s gear for designing and operating
telecommunications networks can help Cisco benefit from the
surging volume of data that its customers must shuttle between
servers, mobile phones, search engines and video websites. With
the deal, Cisco gains tools to help wireless providers improve
the speed and efficiency of their networks.  “Given the widespread convergence of IP and optical
networks, Cariden’s technology will help carriers more
efficiently manage bandwidth, network traffic and
intelligence,” Surya Panditi, senior vice president and general
manager for Cisco’s service provider networking group, said in
the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
