Mortgage rates were little changed,
keeping borrowing costs near record lows as home prices extend a
recovery from a six-year slump.  The average rate for a 30-year fixed mortgage was 3.32
percent in the week ended today, up from the the all-time low of
3.31 percent, McLean, Virginia-based  Freddie Mac (FMCC)  said in a
statement. The average 15-year rate rose to 2.64 percent from
2.63 percent.  Low mortgage rates are spurring home purchases, while a
tightening supply of listings helps drive up prices. The
S&P/Case-Shiller  index  of home prices in 20 U.S. cities rose 3
percent in September from a year earlier, the most since July
2010, the group said this week.  “Housing is experiencing a sustainable upturn,”  Paul Diggle , property economist for Capital Economics Ltd. in  London ,
said in a note to clients on Nov. 27, after the Case-Shiller
report. “The fundamentals of very favorable housing valuations
and affordability argue for further price gains in 2013.”  Contracts to buy previously owned U.S. homes rose 5.2
percent last month from September, the National Association of
Realtors said today.  The Mortgage Bankers Association’s measure of  purchase 
applications climbed 2.6 percent in the week ended Nov. 23 to
the highest point this year. The  refinancing  gauge dropped 1.5
percent, the Washington-based group said yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
