Natural gas futures tumbled in New
York, heading for the biggest weekly decline since June, after a
government report showed an unexpected gain in U.S. stockpiles
as mild weather reduced demand.  Gas dropped 4 percent after an Energy Department report
showed supplies rose by 4 billion cubic feet last week to 3.877
trillion cubic feet, the latest seasonal gain since 2009.
Analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg showed a decline of 9
billion cubic feet. Gas has slid 7.2 percent on moderating
temperatures after reaching a one-year high on Nov. 23.  “That’s a pretty bearish inventory number,” said Gordy Elliott, a risk-management specialist at FC Stone LLC in St.
Louis Park,  Minnesota . “December forecasts have turned warmer
and there are no supply issues at all. This storage report could
be the thing that breaks the market.”  Natural gas for January delivery fell 15.3 cents to settle
at $3.648 per million British thermal units on the New York
Mercantile Exchange. Gas futures have dropped 6.5 percent this
week, heading for the biggest decline since the seven days ended
June 1.  February $3.50 puts were the most active gas options in
electronic trading. They were 4.4 cents higher at 13.4 cents on
volume of 2,510 contracts as of 3:07 p.m. Puts accounted for 57
percent of options volume.  The five-year average gas stockpile change for the week is
a decline of 18 billion cubic feet, department data show. A
 surplus  to the five-year average rose to 5.2 percent from 4.5
percent the previous week, widening for the first time since the
week ended Oct. 26.  Supply Report  Supplies were 0.7 percent above year-earlier inventories,
compared with 0.6 percent the previous week. Stockpiles rose by
2 billion cubic feet in the week ended Nov. 27, 2009.  The inventory data may be “reinforcing the market’s
concern over the warming trend in temperatures and the
likelihood of further bearish storage reports in the weeks
ahead,” Tim Evans, an energy analyst at Citi Futures
Perspective in New York, said in a note to clients today.  MDA Weather Services in Gaithersburg,  Maryland , predicted
above-normal temperatures across most of the contiguous 48
states through Dec. 8.  The low in New York on Dec. 4 may be 47 degrees Fahrenheit
(8 Celsius), 11 above normal, according to  AccuWeather Inc.  in
State College,  Pennsylvania . The low in  Chicago  may be 30
degrees, 4 more than the usual reading.  Heater Use  Heating demand in the U.S. may be 25 percent below normal
from Dec. 5 through Dec. 9, according to Weather Derivatives in
Belton,  Missouri . Demand was 18 percent below the usual level in
the week ended Nov. 24, the company said. About 50 percent of
U.S. households use gas for heating, Energy Department data
show.  The number of rigs drilling for gas in the U.S. rose by 11
to 428 in the week ended Nov. 23, according to data from Baker
Hughes Inc. in Houston. The rig count is down 47 percent this
year.  Marketed gas production will average a record 68.84 billion
cubic feet a day this year, up 4 percent from 2011, the Energy
Department said Nov. 6 in its monthly Short-Term Energy Outlook.  The boom in oil and natural gas production helped the U.S.
cut its reliance on imported fuel. America met 83 percent of its
energy needs in the first eight months of the year, department
data show. If the trend goes on through 2012, it will be the
highest level of self-sufficiency since 1991.  Gas futures volume in electronic trading on the Nymex was
307,817 as of 2:51 p.m., compared with the three-month average
of 359,000. Volume was 360,447 yesterday. Open interest was 1.14
million contracts. The three-month average is 1.15 million.  The exchange has a one-business-day delay in reporting full
volume and open interest data.  To contact the reporters on this story:
