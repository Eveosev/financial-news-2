A failure by lawmakers in Washington
to resolve the U.S. budget deadlock may plunge the nation into a
recession,  Aflac Inc. (AFL)  Chief Executive Officer Dan Amos said.  “You’re dealing with dynamite,” Amos said today after a
speech at the Boston College Chief Executives’ Club of Boston.
“You can hold it in your hand and it won’t explode on you, but
at some point it can. So I’m very worried.”  Officials are seeking to avoid the so-called fiscal cliff,
with more than $600 billion in automatic spending cuts and tax
increases scheduled to begin in January. Business leaders from
billionaire investor  Warren Buffett  to  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) 
CEO Lloyd C. Blankfein have called on lawmakers to reach a
solution.  “I’m afraid they’re going to go to the last moment, but I
would certainly like to see it resolved and hope it will be,”
Amos said. “I think everyone realizes how important this is to
our economy.”  Aflac, based in Columbus, Georgia, is the largest seller of
supplemental health insurance.  To contact the reporters on this story:
