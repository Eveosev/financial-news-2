Monarch Airlines Ltd. said it will 
order 45 single-aisle aircraft before the end of 2013 as it 
retires older jets and seeks to transform itself from a charter
carrier into a discount operator along the lines of  EasyJet Plc. (EZJ)   The planes would be delivered through 2021, Executive
Chairman Iain Rawlinson said in an interview. While Monarch’s
fleet is mainly from Airbus SAS’s A320-series, it will consider
buying 737s from  Boeing Co. (BA)  and models from other manufacturers.  “This is going to be a very important element to making
Monarch properly benchmarked with the low-cost carriers,”
Rawlinson said today by telephone. The airline, which has
typically operated a mixture of jets, will seek to streamline
the fleet around a single type, he said.  Monarch, based at Luton airport, north of London, will take
delivery of two Airbus A320s and two A321s next year, boosting
the total to 38 aircraft.  To contact the reporter on this story:
