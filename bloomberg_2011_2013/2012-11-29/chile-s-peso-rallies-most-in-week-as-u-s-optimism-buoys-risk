Chile ’s peso rose the most in a week
as optimism that U.S. lawmakers will reach an agreement in
budget talks boosted emerging-market assets and Chile’s
manufacturing output beat forecasts.  The peso appreciated 0.4 percent to 479.15 per  U.S. dollar 
in Santiago, the biggest gain since Nov. 20. It extended the
advance this year to 8.4 percent, the most among all of the
world’s currencies tracked by Bloomberg after the Hungarian
forint and Poland’s zloty. The price of copper, Chile’s biggest
export, advanced as much as 2.4 percent in  New York  today.  “Most stock markets outside are rebounding strongly on
optimism related to the fiscal issue in the U.S., and that is
pushing up the peso,” Matias Madrid, an economist at Banco
Penta in Santiago, said in a telephone interview. Peso trading
ended before stocks pared gains when House Speaker  John Boehner 
said there has been no substantial progress in talks aimed at
avoiding tax increases and spending cuts set for January.  Chile’s manufacturing output rose 9.1 percent in October
from a month earlier, the national statistics agency reported
today. The median forecast among analysts surveyed by Bloomberg
was for an increase of 3 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
