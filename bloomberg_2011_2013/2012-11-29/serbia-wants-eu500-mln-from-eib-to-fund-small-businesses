Serbia will ask the European
Investment Bank for 500 million euros ($649.5 million) worth of
loans to support small-and medium companies next year, when
financing needs are expected to grow as the economy recovers.  The loan from the European Union’s lending arm will offer
Serbian private companies access to cheaper long-term funding,
Finance Minister Mladjan Dinkic told lawmakers today, asking
them to approve guarantees for additional sovereign-backed
borrowing.  “We have decided to ask the EIB to double the amount of
those loans, which come with a 12-year maturity, five-year grace
period” because the need for private-sector borrowing will
“expand next year due to strengthened economic activity,”
Dinkic told Parliament’s Finance Committee.  The Luxembourg-based EIB and the World Bank agreed on Nov.
8 to a plan for eastern  Europe  that includes loans and
investment in private and public-sector projects including
infrastructure, corporations and the financial industry.  Dinkic said another 100 million euros from the EIB will
finance infrastructure projects, Dinkic said. Ultimately, the
EIB funds will “replace the government’s loan subsidies” in
the course of 2013, he said.  The government adopted a three-year fiscal strategy late
year to narrow the budget gap to 1 percent of gross domestic
product in 2015 and public debt to 58.4 percent of GDP in 2015
from its peak next year of 65.2 percent of GDP as economic
growth picks up to 3.5 percent in 2014 and 4 percent in 2015,
after a 2 percent expansion next year.  The economy will contract 2 percent this year, the
International Monetary Fund said on Nov. 20 and the government
is expected to pursue policies that will lead to lower debt
without choking economic growth.  To contact the reporter on this story:
