U.K.  house prices  were little
changed this month and values may decline “modestly” over the
next year because of subdued wage growth,  Nationwide Building
Society  said.  The average cost of a home was 163,853 pounds ($262,300) in
November, the Swindon, England-based customer-owned lender said
in an e-mailed statement today. From a year earlier, prices
declined 1.2 percent.  “The predominant theme remains one of stability,”  Robert Gardner , chief economist at Nationwide, said in the statement.
However, “ house prices  are likely to remain broadly flat or
decline modestly over the next 12 months.”  Britain’s uneven economic recovery has restrained the
 property market , as have tight lending conditions at banks,
which the Bank of England is trying to rectify with its Funding
for Lending Scheme. Still, data yesterday showed  mortgage
approvals  rose to a nine-month high in October and Nationwide
said that a better-than-expected labor market performance is
contributing to a stabilization of the housing market.  The economy will “gradually gather pace in the years
ahead,” Gardner said. Its ability to generate jobs “will
remain a key determinant of housing market conditions.”  Mortgage approvals rose to 52,982 last month from 50,415 in
September, according to  Bank of England  data. That’s the highest
since January.  To contact the reporter on this story:
