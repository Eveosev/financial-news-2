China ’s money-market rate fell,
snapping a three-day advance, as the central bank injected funds
into the financial system to meet month-end cash demand.  The People’s Bank of China offered 29 billion  yuan  ($4.7
billion) of seven-day reverse-repurchase agreements at a yield
of 3.35 percent, according to a trader at a primary dealer
required to bid at the auctions. The monetary authority also
sold 50 billion yuan of 14-day reverse repos at 3.45 percent,
the trader said.  “The money market rates will come down as liquidity is
still loose and will remain so,” said Chen Qi, a strategist at
UBS Securities Co. in Shanghai. “However, investors should be
wary that the rates could be volatile as we approach year-end.”  The  seven-day repurchase rate , a gauge of interbank funding
availability, fell two basis points, or 0.02 percentage point,
to 3.34 percent as of 10:02 a.m. in  Shanghai , according to a
weighted average compiled by the National Interbank Funding
Center. It touched 2.3 percent Nov. 19, the lowest since June 8.  The world economy is in its best shape in 18 months as
China’s prospects improve and the U.S. looks likely to avoid the
so-called fiscal cliff of automatic spending cuts and tax
increases, according to the latest Bloomberg Global Poll of
investors. Two-thirds of the 862 surveyed described the global
economy as either stable or improving. That’s up from just over
half who said that in September and is the most since May 2011.  The yield on 3.26 percent government bonds due June 2014
rose two basis points to 2.92 percent, according to data from
the Interbank Funding Center. The one-year interest-rate swap,
the fixed cost to receive the seven-day repo rate, shed three
basis points to 3.37 percent, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
