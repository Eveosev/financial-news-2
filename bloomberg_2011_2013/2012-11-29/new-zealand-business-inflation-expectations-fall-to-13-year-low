New Zealand business expectations
for inflation fell to a 13-year low in November, adding to the
case for benign price pressure that may prolong a period of
record-low interest rates, according to a private survey.  Annual inflation will be 2.24 percent in a year, down from
a 2.36 percent outlook in October and the lowest since October
1999, ANZ Bank New Zealand Ltd. said in a report today. A net
16.9 percent of firms expect to raise prices in the next three
months, it showed.  “Inflation gauges remain tame,”  Cameron Bagrie , chief
economist at ANZ Bank in Wellington, said in the report. “Such
inflation tones augur well for interest rates remaining low.”  Central bank Governor Graeme Wheeler next week will keep
the official cash rate unchanged at a record-low 2.5 percent,
where it has been since March last year, according to all 16
economists in a Bloomberg survey.  Business confidence rose from October, ANZ Bank’s survey of
464 companies showed. Profit expectations and intentions toward
hiring and investment all improved, Bagrie said. Exporters are
still “timid,” with a net 17.5 percent expecting overseas
sales to improve, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
