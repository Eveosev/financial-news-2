The U.S.  Justice Department  agreed
to defer further proceedings in a lawsuit filed by Texas over
the state’s voter identification law until the  Supreme Court 
rules whether part of the Voting Rights Act is constitutional.  Attorney General Eric Holder, in a filing today in federal
court in Washington, said the department could wait for the
Supreme Court to review a provision of the 1965 law that
requires all or part of 16 mostly Southern states to get federal
approval before changing their voting rules.  The Supreme Court said on Nov. 9 it would consider a case
brought by Shelby County,  Alabama , which objects to the formula
under the law used to determine which jurisdictions are subject
to Section 5 of act.  “The Supreme Court’s decision in Shelby County may provide
critical guidance in resolving” the case, Holder said.  A  Texas  law requiring photo identification to vote was
rejected by a three-judge panel in Washington on Aug. 30 after a
bench trial. In order to issue a ruling before the November
election, the panel held off on deciding Texas’s claim that
Section 5, which requires so-called pre-clearance of laws that
affect voting qualifications and procedures, is
unconstitutional.  The case is Texas v. Holder, 12-cv-00128, U.S. District
Court, District of Columbia (Washington).  To contact the reporter on this story:
