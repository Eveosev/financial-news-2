The  Bovespa (IBOV)  index rose for a second
straight day as higher commodity prices boosted the outlook for
Brazilian raw-material producers amid optimism U.S. lawmakers
will reach an agreement in budget talks.  Steelmaker Cia. Siderurgica Nacional SA led gains by
producers after Banco Santander SA raised its recommendation on
the stock to buy. Oil company Petroleo Brasileiro SA and iron-
ore producer Vale SA contributed the most to the gauge’s
advance.  Brazil ’s benchmark equity index rose 0.6 percent to
56,875.85 at 10:29 a.m. in Sao Paulo. Forty-three stocks climbed
on the measure while 23 fell. The real was little changed at
2.0942 per  U.S. dollar . The Standard & Poor’s GSCI index of 24
raw materials added 0.9 percent.  “The sentiment around the world is more positive, pushing
the Bovespa higher,” Luis Gustavo Pereira, an analyst at Futura
Corretora in Sao Paulo, said in a phone interview. “Commodities
are rising, so producers should perform well today.”  U.S. stock-index futures rose as Republican House Speaker
 John Boehner  said yesterday he is optimistic that talks on
implementing tax increases and spending cuts can “avert this
crisis sooner rather than later.” President  Barack Obama  said
he’s looking to reach a deal before Christmas.  CSN, as Cia. Siderurgica is also known, rallied 3.2 percent
to 10.41 reais. Petrobras advanced 1.7 percent to 18.96 reais,
and Vale rose 1.2 percent to 35.65 reais.  The Bovespa has climbed 7.7 percent from this year’s low on
June 5 as stimulus from central banks around the world eased
economic concern and borrowing costs at a record low in Brazil
boosted equity demand. The index  trades  at 10.5 times analysts’
earnings estimates for the next four quarters, which compares
with the ratio of 10.7 times for MSCI Inc.’s measure of 21
developing nations’ equities, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Trading volume was 6.47 billion reais in stocks in  Sao
Paulo  yesterday, compared with a daily average of 7.17 billion
reais this year through Nov. 27, according to data compiled by
the  exchange .  To contact the reporter on this story:
