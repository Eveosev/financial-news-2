Gold rose for the first time in four
days on speculation that the  Federal Reserve  will buy more debt
to boost the  U.S. economy . Silver climbed to a seven-week high.  “I will be assessing the employment and inflation outlook
in order to determine whether we should continue Treasury
purchases into 2013,” Federal Reserve Bank of New York
President William C. Dudley said in a speech in New York.
Treasury Secretary  Timothy F. Geithner  began talks with
congressional leaders on a budget accord.  “Talks about more stimulus measures being introduced are
bullish for gold,”  Bart Melek , the Toronto-based head of
commodity strategy at TD Securities, said in a telephone
interview. “The market is expecting some sort of resolution
soon to avert the fiscal-cliff crisis” on U.S. spending and
taxes, he said.  Gold futures for February delivery gained 0.6 percent to
