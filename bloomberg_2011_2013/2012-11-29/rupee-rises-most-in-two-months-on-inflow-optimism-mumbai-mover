India ’s rupee rose the most in more
than two months on optimism U.S. lawmakers will agree on budget
revisions and as Goldman Sachs Group Inc. upgraded the South
Asian nation’s shares, boosting the prospect of fund inflows.  The world economy is in the best shape in 18 months as
 China ’s prospects improve and the U.S. looks likely to avoid the
tax increases and spending cuts known as the fiscal cliff,
according to the latest Bloomberg Global Poll of investors. The
BSE India  Sensitive Index (SENSEX)  of shares surged 1.8 percent as
Goldman Sachs said the outlook for  Asia ’s third-largest economy
is improving, and raised local stocks to overweight, according
to two separate reports published today.  “After a very challenging 2012, we see  India’s economy 
gradually improving as we move into 2013, especially from the
second half onwards,” economists at Goldman Sachs, including
Mumbai-based Tushar Poddar, wrote in a research note. “We think
the rupee will likely appreciate in the medium term.”  The currency advanced 1.2 percent from Nov. 27 to 54.8250
per dollar in Mumbai, the biggest jump since Sept. 21, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg. It touched 54.7750 earlier, the
strongest level since Nov. 15. The market was shut yesterday for

expected moves in exchange-rates used to price options, fell 5
basis points from Nov. 27, or 0.05 percentage point, to 9.45

the three months through September from a year earlier, Finance
Minister Palaniappan Chidambaram predicted on Nov. 24, matching
the rate in the preceding quarter.  Economists forecast a 5.3 percent increase in gross
domestic product, according to the median estimate in a
Bloomberg survey before data tomorrow. That would match the pace
