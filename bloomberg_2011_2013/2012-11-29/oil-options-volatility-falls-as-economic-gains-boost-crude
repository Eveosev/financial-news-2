Crude oil options volatility fell as
underlying futures rose as the  U.S. economy  showed gains amid
optimism that U.S. lawmakers will make progress on budget talks.  Implied volatility for at-the-money options expiring in
January, a measure of expected price swings in futures and a
gauge of options prices, was 27.05 percent on the  New York 
Mercantile Exchange as of 4:20 p.m., down from 28.92 percent
yesterday.  January-delivery crude oil rose $1.58 to $88.07 a barrel on
the Nymex, the first increase in four days.  President  Barack Obama ’s administration is negotiating with
a divided Congress to avert a $607 billion package of automatic
spending cuts and tax increases set to begin Jan. 1. The
 Congressional Budget Office  has said that failure to reach an
agreement may push the economy into a recession next year.  “We got some positive economic news today, which adds to
the bullishness for commodities,” said  Gordon Elliott , a risk
management specialist at Intl FC Stone LLC in  St. Louis Park ,
 Minnesota .  The most active options in electronic trading today were
January $80 puts, which fell 13 cents to 17 cents a barrel on
volume of 7,422 lots at 4:26 p.m. January $85 puts were the
second-most active, with 2,689 lots exchanged as they declined
49 cents to 89 cents a barrel.  Bets that prices would decline, or puts, accounted for 54
percent of trading volume.  The exchange distributes real-time data for electronic
trading and releases information the next business day on open-
outcry volume, where the bulk of options activity occurs.  In the previous session, bullish bets made up 53 percent of
the 121,264 contracts traded.  January $75 puts were the most actively traded options
yesterday with 6,678 contracts. They were unchanged at 5 cents a
barrel. February $75 puts rose 6 cents to 41 cents on volume of
5,643 lots.  Open interest was highest for January $105 calls, with
45,832 contracts. Next were January $60 puts, at 34,924 lots,
and January $110 calls, with 31,209 contracts.  To contact the reporter on this story:
