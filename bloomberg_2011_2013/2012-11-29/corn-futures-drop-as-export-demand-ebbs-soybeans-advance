Corn futures fell from a five-week
high as demand by producers of grain-based fuel, animal feed and
food ebbed. Soybeans gained.  U.S. export sales of  corn  in the week ended Nov. 22 tumbled
69 percent to 263,140 metric tons from a week earlier, the
Department of Agriculture said today. Production of  ethanol  slid
1 percent in the week ended Nov. 23 to the lowest in five weeks,
the Energy Department said yesterday. The number of  chicks 
placed on feed last week dropped 3.8 percent from a year
earlier, USDA data show.  “The rally in prices slowed exports and ethanol
production,” Jerrod Kitt, the director of research at the Linn
Group on Chicago, said in a telephone interview. “The drop in
chicken production also weighed on the market.”  Corn futures for March delivery dropped 0.7 percent to
close at $7.5875 a bushel at 2 p.m. on the  Chicago  Board of
Trade. Yesterday, the price reached $7.675, the highest for a
most-active contract since Oct. 19. The grain has gained 17
percent this year after a Midwest drought reduced production.  Soybean futures for January delivery rose 0.1 percent to
$14.48 a bushel in Chicago. Earlier, the price reached $14.60,
the highest since Nov. 9. Export demand increased last week for
animal feed and cooking oil made from supplies in the U.S., the
world’s biggest producer.  U.S. exporters sold 365,058 metric tons of soy-based  animal
feed  in the week ended Nov. 22, up 84 percent from a week
earlier and the most in two years, the USDA said today. Soybean-
oil  sales  surged more than 13-fold to 121,527 tons from a year
earlier.  Corn is the biggest U.S. crop, valued at $76.5 billion in
2011, followed by soybeans at $35.8 billion, government figures
show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
