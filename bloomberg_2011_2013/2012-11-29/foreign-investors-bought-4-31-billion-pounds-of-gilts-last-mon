Overseas investors increased their
holdings of U.K. government bonds for a fourth straight month in
October, the  Bank of England  said today.  Non-residents bought 4.31 billion pounds more gilts than
they sold last month, after increasing their holdings by 1.84
billion pounds in September, the data showed.  Separately, the central bank said U.K. money supply rose
0.2 percent in October from the previous month. From a year
earlier, M4 fell 3.2 percent, the smallest annual decline since
January.  A measure of M4 money-supply growth the central bank uses
to assess the effectiveness of its asset purchases slowed to 5.4
percent from 7.5 percent. The gauge excludes financial companies
that specialize in intermediating between banks, such as holding
companies and non-bank credit grantors.  In another release, the Bank of England said the effective
 interest rate  on new mortgages slipped to 3.74 percent in
October from 3.77 percent in September. For existing secured
loans, the rate was 3.39 percent, up from 3.36 percent. On new
loans to companies, the effective interest rate increased to
2.92 percent from 2.72 percent.  The central bank accidentally published its monthly credit
and lending data, including mortgage approvals, yesterday. That
report had been scheduled to be released at 9:30 a.m. today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
