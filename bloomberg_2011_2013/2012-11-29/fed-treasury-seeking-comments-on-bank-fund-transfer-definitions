The U.S. Treasury and  Federal
Reserve  said today they are requesting comments on proposed
changes to the definitions of “funds transfer” and
“transmittal of funds” under the Bank Secrecy Act.  The changes are needed to update the definitions of
transfers and transmittals to comply with the Dodd-Frank Act,
the Fed and Treasury’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network said
today in a joint  statement . Comments are due Jan. 25.  To contact the reporter on this story:
