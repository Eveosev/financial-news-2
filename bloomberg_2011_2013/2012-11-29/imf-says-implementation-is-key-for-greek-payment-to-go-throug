The main challenge for a
disbursement under a Greek bailout package is the implementation
of measures agreed to by  Greece  and finance ministers of the
euro region, including a buyback of Greek bonds, an
International Monetary Fund spokesman said.  “We believe this is a significant and concrete package
that can put Greece’s debt back on a sustainable path,” IMF
spokesman Gerry Rice told reporters in Washington today. “We
have welcomed this but of course its success requires both
Greece and the European partners to fully implement their
commitments.”  Rice said IMF Managing Director Christine Lagarde would be
in a position to recommend a disbursement of the Greek loan if
the debt buyback is implemented. He declined to say what the IMF
would consider a successful completion of the bond buyback.  Rice said that the IMF expects the bond buybacks to be
completed by Dec. 13.  To contact the reporter on this story:
