Bank of Thailand  Governor Prasarn
Trairatvorakul comments on the nation’s policy  interest rate . He
spoke to reporters late yesterday.  The Monetary Policy Committee yesterday held its  one-day
bond repurchase  rate at 2.75 percent, after reducing borrowing
costs by a quarter of a percentage point last month.  “The interest rate at this level is quite balanced both in
terms of growth and price. Inflation hasn’t accelerated and
seems to be at the right level. The MPC viewed that there is no
need to reduce the rate further based on the current economic
data.”  Prasarn said  Thailand ’s interest-rate differential isn’t
the only factor affecting capital movements. He said  Hong Kong 
was an example of an economy that was attracting fund inflows
even as interest rates remain low. There have been no unusual
movements in the baht, he said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
