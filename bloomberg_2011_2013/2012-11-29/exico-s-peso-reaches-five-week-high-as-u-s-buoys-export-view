Mexico ’s peso closed at its highest
level in five weeks as optimism that U.S. lawmakers will reach a
budget agreement boosted the outlook for growth in the Latin
American nation’s top export market.  The peso climbed 0.2 percent to 12.9469 per dollar at 4
p.m., its strongest close since Oct. 22. The currency has
increased 7.6 percent in 2012, the biggest advance among the
dollar’s 16 most-traded counterparts.  “There’s a certain optimism” that the U.S. will avoid the
budget changes known as the fiscal cliff,  Rafael Camarena , an
economist at Grupo Financiero Santander Mexico SAB, said in a
telephone interview from Mexico City. “The market appears to
have more confidence that they could reach a deal. That’s surely
what’s helping the peso today.”  Mexico’s central bank will hold the target lending rate at
a record low 4.5 percent in a decision due to be released
tomorrow, 21 of 22 economists in a Bloomberg survey forecast.
One predicts policy makers will increase it to 4.75 percent.  Yields on peso bonds due in 2024 rose two basis points, or
0.02 percentage point, to 5.59 percent, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. The price fell 0.24 centavo to 138.56
centavos per peso.  Democratic Senator Chuck Schumer said in a news conference
there has been progress in talks and White House spokesman Jay Carney said the administration is optimistic about the
negotiations. President  Barack Obama  and U.S. lawmakers are
under pressure to reach a deal to avoid $607 billion in spending
cuts and tax increases set to take effect in January.  To contact the reporter on this story:
