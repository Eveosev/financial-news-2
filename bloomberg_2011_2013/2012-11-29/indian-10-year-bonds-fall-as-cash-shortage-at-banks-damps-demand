India ’s 10-year bonds declined,
snapping a two-day advance, on speculation a cash squeeze in the
banking system will damp demand.  Local lenders borrowed an  average  931 billion rupees ($17
billion) a day from the Reserve Bank of India this month to meet
shortages, compared with 671 billion rupees in October, official
data show. The central bank, which has bought 820 billion rupees
of debt since April 1 to boost the availability of funds, last
held an auction to purchase securities in June. Cash at banks
may decline further as companies pay quarterly taxes by Dec. 15,
according to Quantum Asset Management Co.  “Yields have risen as some investors probably expected the
central bank to resume debt purchases this week to boost
liquidity and they are disappointed,” said Arvind Chari, a
senior fund manager at Quantum Asset in Mumbai. “Liquidity is
going to worsen in the coming days as corporates pay taxes.”  The yield on the 8.15 percent government notes due June
2022 rose two basis points, or 0.02 percentage point, to 8.21
percent in Mumbai, according to the central bank’s trading
system. Local markets were closed yesterday for a public
holiday.  Tax payments may drain between 500 billion rupees to 650
billion rupees from the financial system, Chari said.  The one-year interest-rate swap, a derivative contract used
to guard against fluctuations in funding costs, fell one basis
point to 7.74 percent, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
