Republican David Rouzer conceded the
last undecided U.S. House of Representatives race to Democratic
incumbent Mike McIntyre in  North Carolina .  Jessica Wood, a spokeswoman for Rouzer, said in an e-mail
that the challenger, a Republican state senator, conceded
following a recount that he had requested after a canvass showed
McIntyre, 56, leading by 655 votes.  The election of McIntyre to his ninth term means Democrats
gained eight seats in the House in the Nov. 6 election.
Republicans will still control the House, 234-201.  “I have called Congressman McIntyre to congratulate him on
a hard-fought victory, and I wish him well as he joins a new
Congress that will be dealing with very difficult issues facing
our country,” Rouzer said in a statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
