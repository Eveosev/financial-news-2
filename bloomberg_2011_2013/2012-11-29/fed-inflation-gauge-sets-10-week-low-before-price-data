Treasuries erased losses after
Republican House Speaker  John Boehner  said “no substantive
progress” has been made in talks to avert the so-called fiscal
cliff, boosting demand for haven assets.  Government debt fell earlier today on speculation lawmakers
were making progress in budget talks to avoid automatic spending
cuts and tax increases. The Treasury will sell $29 billion of
seven-year notes today after demand rose at an auction of five-
year debt yesterday. The  Federal Reserve  is acquiring as much as
$17.2 billion in six Treasury purchases this week, including a
purchase of $4.74 billion today.  “The market is focused on utterances from people in
Congress on one side of this debate or the other,” said  Ray Remy , head of fixed income in  New York  at Daiwa Capital Markets
America Inc., one of 21 primary dealers that trade directly with
the Fed. “Boehner tempered those statements by saying he will do
everything to not go over the cliff.”  The yield on the benchmark 10-year note dropped one basis
point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 1.62 percent at 12:01 p.m.
in New York, according to Bloomberg Bond Trader prices. The
1.625 percent note due in November 2022 added 3/32, or 94 cents
per $1,000 face amount, to 100 2/32. The yield reached 1.64
percent earlier today. It dropped to 1.60 percent yesterday, the
lowest since Nov. 19.  Debt Returns  Treasuries have returned 2.7 percent this year, after
gaining 9.8 percent in 2011, according to Bank of America
Merrill Lynch indexes. The securities returned 0.6 percent this
month, according to the indexes.  The difference between the yields on two and 10-year notes,
the so-called yield curve, widened to 1.38 percentage points
after reaching 1.34 percentage points yesterday, the most narrow
in almost two weeks.  Volatility in Treasuries rose yesterday from five year
lows. Bank of America Merrill Lynch’s  MOVE index , which measures
price swings based on options, increased to 52.3 basis points
from 51.7 basis points the previous day, the lowest level since
May 2007. It hit a 2012 high of 95.4 basis points on June 15.
Volatility climbed to 264.6 basis points in October 2008 as the
financial crisis intensified.  Treasury trading volume rose yesterday to the most in three
weeks. About $281.5 billion changed hands, the most since Nov.
7, after trading below the 2012 daily average of $240 billion
for almost a week, according to ICAP Plc, the largest inter-
dealer broker of  U.S. government debt .  Deficit Goals  Treasury Secretary  Timothy F. Geithner  will meet the top
four leaders in Congress today, after chief executives from more
than a dozen U.S. corporations shuttled from the Capitol to the
White House yesterday and pressed both sides for an agreement to
prevent triggering automatic spending cuts and tax increases on
Jan. 1.  “The market is still focused on the fiscal cliff,” said
 Tom Porcelli , chief U.S. economist at Royal Bank of Canada’s  RBC
Capital Markets , a primary dealer. “It’s creating a cloud of
uncertainty around this outlook.”  Treasuries advanced yesterday after the $35 billion five-
year sale drew the highest demand in eight years from direct
bidders amid concern Congress faces headwinds in resolving the
fiscal cliff.  Direct bidders , non-primary dealer investors that place
their orders with the Treasury, purchased 15.9 percent of the
notes, the most since September 2004.  Auction Outcomes  A $35 billion two-year auction on Nov. 27 drew  orders  for
4.07 times the amount of debt available, matching the record
high from November 2011.  The seven-year notes scheduled for sale today yielded 1.05
percent in pre-auction trading. Today’s sale will conclude this
week’s $99 billion in notes auctions.  The Fed is selling shorter-term Treasuries from its
holdings and buying those due in six to 30 years under a program
known as Operation Twist, which is scheduled to end next month.  The central bank bought Treasuries today maturing from
February 2021 to November 2022, according to the Fed Bank of New
York’s  website .  Fed Bank of New York President William C. Dudley said he is
weighing “unacceptably high” joblessness as he considers
whether the central bank should increase its asset purchases.  Fed View  “I will be assessing the employment and inflation outlook
in order to determine whether we should continue Treasury
purchases into 2013,” Dudley said today in the text of remarks
for a speech in New York. “The Fed will promote maximum
employment and price stability to the greatest extent our tools
permit, and we will stay the course.”  The policy-setting  Federal Open Market Committee  next meets
on Dec. 11-12 to assess the impact of record accommodation,
including a plan to buy $40 billion in mortgage bonds per month
to reduce unemployment. The central bank said last month it will
buy bonds until the job market improves “substantially.”  Gross domestic product grew at a 2.7 percent annual rate,
up from a 2 percent prior estimate, revised figures from the
Commerce Department showed today in  Washington . The median
forecast of 82 economists surveyed by Bloomberg called for a 2.8
percent gain. Household purchases climbed at a 1.4 percent rate,
the least in more than a year and down from a previously
reported 2 percent rate, and income gains were also cut.  Ten-year yields will end the year at 1.74 percent,
according to Bloomberg surveys. They will climb to 1.85 percent
in the first quarter of next year, the predictions show.  To contact the reporters on this story:
