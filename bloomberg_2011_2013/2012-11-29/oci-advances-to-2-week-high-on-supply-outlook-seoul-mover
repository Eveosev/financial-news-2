OCI Co. (010060) ,  South Korea ’s biggest
polysilicon maker for solar cells, rose to a two-week high after
a smaller rival filed for court receivership, triggering
speculation an industry oversupply will ease.  Shares of OCI gained 2 percent to 152,000 won in Seoul
trading, the highest close since Nov. 15. The benchmark Kospi
index added 1.2 percent.  Hankook Silicon Co., which is unlisted, filed for
receivership with the Seoul Central District Court yesterday
because of deteriorating margins in the solar business, its
parent  Osung LST Co. (052420)  said in a filing today. The spot price of
polysilicon has been falling since February, dragging down the
price of long-term contracts for the material derived from sand.  “The crumbling of a smaller rival eases concerns about
industrywide oversupply,” Lee Eung Ju, an analyst at Shinhan
Investment Corp., said by telephone today. “It’s still unclear
whether demand could turn around.”  Osung LST tumbled 15 percent to 1,900 won, while the Kosdaq
index, where the company is listed, gained 0.5 percent. S-Oil
Corp., which also holds a stake in Hankook Silicon, slipped 2.1
percent to 97,200 won.  OCI  shares  have retreated 31 percent this year, compared
with a 6 percent gain in the Kospi index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
