Eastman Kodak Co. (EKDKQ) , the bankrupt
photography pioneer, obtained commitments for an $830 million
exit financing, trumping a previous offer of $793 million.  The transaction, offered by the second-lien noteholder
committee, includes $455 million in new money and $375 million
in term portions issued to senior creditors, the company said in
a regulatory filing yesterday. The financing is contingent on
Rochester, New York-based Kodak’s sale of its digital imaging
patents for at least $500 million.  A $255 million first-lien slice will pay interest at 9.5
percentage points more than the London interbank offered rate
with a 1 percent minimum on the lending benchmark, according to
the filing. A $200 million first-out portion pays interest at 11
percentage points more than Libor with a 1 percent minimum. A
$375 million second-lien piece will pay interest at 12
percentage points more than Libor with a 1 percent minimum.  Proceeds of the debt will refinance outstanding debtor-in-
possession loans and support the company’s working capital
requirements, according to the filing.  As much as $630 million may be rolled over to five-year
debt upon emergence from Chapter 11 if certain conditions are
met, according to the company.  Kodak received another financing offer from a group of
lenders including Centerbridge Capital Partners, GSO Capital
Partners, UBS AG and JPMorgan Chase & Co. earlier this month.  Kodak filed for bankruptcy protection in January, listing
$5.1 billion in assets and $6.75 billion in debt. The company
plans to exit bankruptcy in the first half of 2013.  To contact the reporter on this story:
