Australian carbon permits are
forecast to trade at an average price of A$16 ($16.74) a metric
ton in the second half of this decade, according to research
company RepuTex.  A lower carbon price than  Australia ’s government predicted
may result in a rise in higher costs for the certificates
created under its plan to get 20 percent of the nation’s power
from renewable energy by 2020, RepuTex said today in an e-mailed
statement.  Australia’s Climate Change Authority assumes that the
carbon price will trade at A$29 a ton when the nation moves to
from a fixed price to a floating price in 2015 and then rise 5
percent a year, according to RepuTex. The cost of Large-scale
Generation Credits may increase to as much as A$65 in 2020 in
the wake of lower carbon prices, the researcher said.  Australia, seeking to reduce its reliance on fossil fuels,
requires electricity retailers to purchase renewable energy
certificates from low-carbon generators, providing an incentive
to wind and solar developers. An oversupply of the certificates
reduced spot prices to about A$35 this year.  Australia started charging about 300 of its largest
polluters a fixed carbon price of A$23 a ton in July and plans
to move to a market-based, emissions trading system in 2015. The
country abandoned an attempt to set a minimum price for carbon
permits and announced in August it was linking to the European
Union market, preparing for global emissions trading.  To contact the reporter on this story:
