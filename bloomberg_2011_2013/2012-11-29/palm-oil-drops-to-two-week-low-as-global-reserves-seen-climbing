Palm oil  fell for a third day to the
lowest level in two weeks on concern that stockpiles in
 Indonesia  and Malaysia, the world’s largest producers, will
expand as demand weakens.  The contract for February delivery lost as much as 1.1
percent to 2,367 ringgit ($776) a metric ton on the Malaysia
Derivatives Exchange, the lowest price since Nov. 14, and ended
the morning session at 2,372 ringgit in Kuala Lumpur. Futures
are headed for a third monthly decline.  Production in Indonesia will climb 8 percent to 28 million
tons in the year that started started on Oct. 1, according to a
unit of the  U.S. Department of Agriculture . Inventories reached
a record 2.51 million tons in October, according to the
Malaysian Palm Oil Board. Shipments from Malaysia fell 1.8
percent to 1.28 million tons in the first 25 days of November
from a month earlier, Intertek said on Nov. 26.  “The bearish factor for palm oil is high stocks, both in
Malaysia and Indonesia,” said Chandran Sinnasamy, trading head
at LT International Futures (M) Sdn. in  Kuala Lumpur . “It would
need five to six months to clear the stocks and prices need to
fall to attract demand.”  Palm oil may be the best-performing agricultural commodity
in 2013 as demand rebounds after this year’s price plunge,
Rabobank International said yesterday. Futures may trade at
2,700 ringgit a ton by the fourth quarter of 2013, compared with
an expected average of 2,360 ringgit this quarter, analysts led
by Luke Chandler said in a report.  Indonesia is discussing changes to its export tax policy to
counter Malaysia’s plan to lower tariffs on crude palm oil
shipments from Jan. 1, Agriculture Minister Suswono told
reporters in Bali today. A decision will be taken soon, he said.  Soybean oil  for delivery in January dropped 0.2 percent to
50.25 cents a pound on the Chicago Board of Trade. Soybeans for
January delivery were little changed at $14.4775 a bushel.  Palm oil for May delivery declined 0.2 percent to 6,730
 yuan  ($1,082) a ton on the  Dalian Commodity Exchange . Soybean
oil for the same month lost 0.3 percent to 8,548 yuan a ton.  To contact the reporter on this story:
