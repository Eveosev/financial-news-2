LatRosTrans SIA, a pipeline operator
majority owned by  Ventspils Nafta (VNF1R)  AS, said it is starting
preparatory works to convert a crude oil pipeline into one that
transports gas.  The company has removed 43,000 tons of crude oil from the
pipeline, which runs from the western Latvian city of Ventspils
to Polotsk, Belarus, and plans to test an 8.2 kilometer (5.1
miles) section of it for gas transports early next year, the
company said in a statement to the Riga Stock Exchange today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
