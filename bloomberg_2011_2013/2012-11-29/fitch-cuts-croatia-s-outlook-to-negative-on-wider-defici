Fitch Ratings  lowered  Croatia ’s
outlook to negative from stable, citing the government’s
forecast for a wider budget deficit next year.  Fitch also affirmed the country’s long-term foreign and
local-currency issuer default ratings at BBB- and BBB,
respectively, it said in an e-mailed statement today.  Croatia, which is set to become the European Union’s 28th
member in July 2013, is struggling to fend off a renewed
recession. The 11-month-old Cabinet of Prime Minister  Zoran Milanovic  wants to attract investors with 8 billion kuna ($1.4
billion) from EU funds and reconstruction banks to help pay for
infrastructure and energy projects after EU contributions and
debt repayments will push the 2013 fiscal gap to 3.1 percent of
gross domestic product.  The “recently announced draft 2013 budget proposes an
increase in the consolidated general government’s fiscal deficit
from an estimated 3.5 percent of GDP in 2012 to 3.8 percent in
2013,” Fitch said.  The government on Nov. 15 reduced the 2012 growth forecast
to a 1.1 percent contraction, citing an investment drought as an
effect of  Europe ’s sovereign debt crisis.  Fitch on Sept. 5 raised Croatia’s outlook to stable from
negative, citing the government’s progress in cutting costs and
narrowing the  budget deficit .  “The revision to a Stable Outlook in September was based
on the government’s maintaining a tight medium-term fiscal
stance in line with the Fiscal Responsibility Law in 2012.”  The  International Monetary Fund  on Nov. 13 said Croatia’s
economy will shrink 1.5 percent this year, urging the government
to remove barriers to investment and employment in order to
return to growth in 2013. The European Commission said on Nov. 7
the economy will contract 1.9 percent in 2012.  Croatia is rated an equivalent Baa3 at Moody’s, the lowest
investment grade, level with Latvia and Romania. It is rated
BBB- by  Standard & Poor’s .  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
