Japan ’s environment ministry has
asked for 41.1 billion yen ($521 million) to support clean
energy projects for the fiscal year starting April, the Kyodo
News agency said today, citing a ministerial budget request.  The amount is almost twice as much as this fiscal year’s
budget and includes 25 billion yen for the Green New Deal fund
to support local governments and businesses planning to promote
clean energy, Kyodo said.  The ministry’s total budget request is about 1.12 trillion
yen, 9 percent more than this fiscal year, according to the
report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
