Spanish two-year notes fell after
demand at a Treasury auction weakened and investors awaited
details of the  European Central Bank ’s proposal to buy the
country’s bonds.  The Treasury today sold 3.5 billion euros ($4.4 billion) of
bonds, meeting its maximum target, even as demand for notes
maturing in 2014 fell to 2.01 times the amount sold from 3.97 at
an auction in June. Two-year benchmark yields, which had fallen
to as low as 2.99 percent before the auction, rose to 3.17
percent at 1 p.m. in Madrid.  While the auction was “pleasing from the perspective of
the Tesoro having met the top end of its target range,” that
positive news is “diluted by the comparative softness of
demand,”  Richard McGuire , a senior fixed-income strategist at
Rabobank in  London , said in an e-mailed comment.  Rajoy, who hosts German Chancellor  Angela Merkel  in Madrid
today to discuss the euro-area crisis, has said he may ask the
ECB to buy the country’s bonds once he has more details on the
proposal. ECB President  Mario Draghi  will speak to reporters at
2:30 p.m. today in  Frankfurt  after a rate-setting meeting.  At the auction,  demand  for the 2016 notes was 1.86 times
the amount sold, compared with 2.72 times at a sale in August
and the bid-to-cover ratio for the 2015 bonds was 1.76, down
from 2.28 in July.  Still, expectations of ECB buying pushed down yields. The
average rate on debt maturing in 2016 fell to 4.603 percent from
5.971 percent on Aug. 2, while the yield on notes due in 2015
declined to 3.676 percent from 5.086 percent in July. Securities
due in 2014 were sold at 2.798 percent, compared with 4.706
percent in June.  On Sept. 1, Rajoy said  Spain  is unable to fund itself at
current borrowing costs. The prime minister needs to find a
solution quickly. Of Spain’s 688.6 billion euros of bonds and
bills outstanding, 335.8 billion euros -- almost half of the
total debt -- comes due in the next three years, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  The yield on Spain’s benchmark  10-year bond yield  fell 19
basis points from yesterday to 6.22 percent, down from a euro-
era intraday record of 7.75 percent on July 25. Rajoy and Merkel
are expected to talk to reporters after meeting at 1 p.m. in
Madrid.  The Treasury, which returns to the market on Sept. 18.,
said after the auction today it has covered 76.8 percent of the
planned medium- and long-term issuance planned for this year.
That puts the debt agency in a “comfortable” position for the
rest of the year, it said in a statement today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
