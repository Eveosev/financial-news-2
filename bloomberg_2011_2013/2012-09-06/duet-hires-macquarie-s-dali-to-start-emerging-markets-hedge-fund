Duet Asset Management Ltd. has hired
a Macquarie Investment Management LLC managing director to start
a hedge fund to bet on macroeconomic trends in  emerging markets .  David Dali has been appointed chief investment officer of
the Duet Emerging Markets Macro fund, London-based Duet said in
an e-mailed statement today. Dali led the emerging markets team
at Macquarie Investment, which is a unit of  Macquarie Group
Ltd. (MQG) , Australia’s biggest investment bank, the company said.  Macro hedge funds that primarily invest in developing
markets such as  Latin America  and Asia have outperformed those
focused on developed markets this year, as volatility spurred by
Europe’s sovereign debt crisis has tripped up traders. Emerging-
market macro funds rose 5.2 percent on average through July,
compared with a 1.1 percent gain for all macro funds, according
to Singapore-based data provider Eurekahedge Pte.  The Duet fund will make wagers on credit spreads,  interest
rates , currencies and stocks. Jack Janasiewicz, who is also
joining Duet from Macquarie Investment, will serve as chief
strategist of the fund, while Brian Hassett will be head of
operations. Hassett joins Duet from KPMG LLP. He previously
worked at Macquarie Investment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
