The ruble strengthened for a third
day as oil gained and investors bet  Europe ’s debt crisis will be
contained, stoking appetite for riskier assets.  Russia’s currency advanced 1.1 percent to 31.9380 at 6 p.m.
in Moscow. The ruble gained 1 percent versus the euro at
40.3050, leaving it 1 percent higher against the central bank’s
target euro-dollar basket. Non-deliverable forwards showed the
ruble at 32.3915 per dollar in three months.  Oil rose for a second day in  New York  as ECB President
 Mario Draghi  said policy makers agreed to an unlimited bond-
purchase program to lower borrowing costs.  Brent crude  rose 1.4
percent to $114.73. Oil and natural gas account for about 50
percent of Russia’s state revenue.  “The purchase of state bonds by the regulator should offer
support for the EU debt market and as a result for the Russian
market,” Alexey Egorov, an analyst at Nomos Bank in Moscow,
said by e-mail. “In near future we may count on the beginning
of a recovery trend.”  The extra yield investors demand to own Russia’s dollar
bonds over U.S. Treasuries fell 11 basis points to 206,
according to JPMorgan Chase & Co.’s EMBI Global Index. An index
of five-year government bond yields compiled by the Micex fell
eight basis points to 7.526 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
