This is another in a series of reports from  Ramesh Ponnuru  and Margaret Carlson from the Democratic National Convention in  Charlotte ,  North Carolina . Ramesh:   Bill Clinton  made the  best case possible  for President  Barack Obama  last night,  but boy did he have to do a lot of work to make it. The deep recession  Obama inherited, and the weak recovery for which he arguably bears some  responsibility, mark him as a failure using the normal metric of the  number of jobs now compared to when he took office. So Clinton compared  the Democratic and Republican presidents of the last few decades in the  aggregate, arguing that Democrats had generally done better than  Republicans. That’s true  only because  Democrats have more often left  office at the start of recessions. In other words, Clinton wants us to judge Republicans in general by a tougher standard than he wants us to apply to Obama. To make the argument that Obama was willing to reach out to political  opponents, Clinton almost exclusively referred to Obama’s work with  rivals inside his party -- notably Clinton’s wife. If Obama’s record had  supplied Clinton with examples of reaching across the aisle, he would  have used them. Clinton's argument about Obamacare relied on the same sort of  cherry-picking. We’re supposed to believe that trillions of dollars in  new spending is worth it because some 25-year-olds can stay on their  parents’ health plans -- which they will have to do since the economy Obama  presides over isn’t generating jobs for them. We’re also supposed to  believe that Medicare can be cut by more than $700 billion without affecting anybody’s benefits. Clinton, in a line that seemed self-deprecating but was actually  self-aggrandizing, said that not even he could have turned around this  economy in “just four years.” I suspect that not even he could persuade  Americans that four disappointing years have actually been the prelude  to success.

Margaret:  The Big Dog started out hoarse, like Clint  Eastwood, another old man with white hair ignoring the flashing light, who  didn't naturally belong there. It's not so much what Clinton said as the way he  said it in defense of a man he might have never forgiven or been forgiven by. President Barack Obama may well give a better speech tonight, with a kiss to Michelle at the end to rival   Al Gore 's of Tipper. But we’ve been to the emotional mountaintop of the convention as  Obama came from behind the curtain for The Hug that lasted two back pats longer  than it needed to. No kiss could supplant it. By concentrating on facts, Ramesh, you miss  the point of Clinton. Yes, he was selective in the budget figures, BLS data, and the history of presidents past and present to make the  case for reelecting the current one.  He told the story with  conviction, good humor and the familiar touches -- the wagging finger, the head  tilt, the frequent "now, listen to this" asides in case anyone was drifting  away. Lost in your perusal of unemployment stats  is the moral authority Clinton brought to the stage, a piece of capital I never  thought he could reclaim when I covered the Clinton White House for Time  magazine. I remember the lights on the White House lawn 24 hours a day  chronicling Clinton’s deserved political and emotional death. Over a decade,  he’s inched slowly back from the depths of turpitude, from sin to denial to  confession to redemption through good works. He could be the hero of a country  song -- or the candidate of the Christian Right, which loves a repentant sinner. No  wonder  Mitt Romney  embraces him. Clinton wasn’t just another president  endorsing another president. The Obamas and Clintons have so many reasons to  hate, and love, each other. They were bitter enemies in the 2008 Democratic primary. They  became wary allies during the general-election campaign. And then, as much as its  exists in politics, they became friends. Yes,  Hillary Clinton ’s life would  have been fine had the former first lady and senator not become secretary of  State. But without Obama reaching out against the human instinct of the victor  to shun the loser, she wouldn’t be one of the most beloved figures in the world. Standing there last night, Clinton  proved how you can come to do that which you never imagined.  He's  not thinking about the next election as much as eternity. The heart patient  who's replaced Big Macs with tofu now has a head too big for his  slim body, and a wistful demeanor rather than a red face. With his ailing heart,   he races around the globe trying to save it, mentioning often how  his days are numbered. He used up one in Charlotte. His life is now in dying order.
