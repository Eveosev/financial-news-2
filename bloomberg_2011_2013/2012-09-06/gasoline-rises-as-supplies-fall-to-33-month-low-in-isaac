Gasoline advanced the most in a week
as an Energy Department report showed inventories slid last week
to the lowest level since November 2008.  Futures rose for the first time in three days as  gasoline
supplies  fell 2.33 million barrels to 198.9 million as Hurricane
Isaac idled 13 percent of Gulf Coast production. Gasoline  demand 
over the past four weeks was 0.7 percent above a year ago.  “You had a fairly decent gasoline draw in the front of
Labor Day,” said  David Pursell , a managing director at Tudor
Pickering Holt & Co. LLC in Houston. “Demand is up in a market
where gasoline prices are rising.”  October-delivery gasoline advanced 4.12 cents, or 1.4
percent, to settle at $2.991 a gallon on the  New York Mercantile
exchange , the largest gain since Aug. 27.  Regular  gasoline  at the pump, averaged nationwide, slipped
0.1 cent to $3.823 a gallon yesterday, AAA data showed. Prices
are up 49.7 cents from the year-to-date low of $3.326 on July 1.  Demand  for the motor fuel rose 1.3 percent in the seven
days ended Aug. 31 to 9.18 million barrels a day. Consumption
typically declines after the Labor Day holiday, which fell this
year on Sept. 3. Emissions specifications in fuel loosen after
the summer, making the fuel cheaper to produce and expanding
available supply.  “Gasoline demand has stayed strong, which is surprising,”
said  Sander Cohan , a global transportation fuels analyst and
principal with Energy Security Analysis Inc. in Wakefield,
 Massachusetts .  Inventories have declined 5.3 percent in the past six
weeks, department data show.  Refineries Starting  As of today, five Louisiana refineries that had been shut
because of the hurricane were restarting and another four were
operating at reduced rates, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. Gulf Coast refinery utilization dropped to 82.2
percent from 91.4 percent a week earlier.  “Refineries are not coming back as quickly as hoped,”
said  Phil Flynn , senior market analyst at Price Futures Group in
 Chicago .  In the PADD 1 region, which includes  New York  Harbor, the
delivery point of Nymex futures, stockpiles are 6.6 percent
below a year earlier and the lowest level for this time of the
year since 2007.  Heating oil for October delivery rose 2.49 cents, or 0.8
percent, to $3.1425 a gallon on the exchange.  Distillate Stockpiles  Supplies of distillates, including heating oil and diesel,
climbed 993,000 barrels to 127.1 million, the fourth consecutive
increase. Inventories, while the highest since April 13, are 19
percent below a year earlier and are the lowest for this time of
the year since 2004.  “We suspect the scale of the reported build was
attributable to a marked decline in gross exports that would
have been constrained by the hurricane,” Gareth Lewis-Davies
and  Harry Tchilinguirian , analysts at BNP Paribas SA in  London ,
said in an e-mailed report today.  Demand for distillates slipped 9.6 percent to 3.22 million
barrels a day, the lowest level since the week ended March 16.  “Gasoline demand was up over a year earlier while the
distillate demand number was really soft but it was a hurricane
week and things can be screwy,” said  Andrew Lebow , a senior
vice president at Jefferies Bache LLC in New York.  To contact the reporters on this story:
