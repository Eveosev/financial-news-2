Bakken oil’s premium to West Texas
Intermediate crude surged to the widest in almost a year as
refineries on the East and West coasts began receiving or were
expected to get shipments this month.  Tesoro Corp. (TSO)  received the first unit-train of Bakken crude
Sept. 4 at a new offloading terminal that will allow the
company’s Anacortes refinery in Washington state to receive as
much as 50,000 barrels a day by rail. Irving Oil Ltd. expects a
train terminal for offloading 70,000 barrels a day of Bakken and
Western Canada grades near its Saint John refinery in  New
Brunswick  to be fully operational this month, a person with
knowledge of the situation said today.  Bakken strengthened $4 to a premium of $6 above the U.S.
benchmark at 12:18 p.m. in New York, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg. That’s the largest premium for the grade since
Oct. 4.  Syncrude’s premium widened $1.25 to $12 a barrel over WTI,
the largest margin since Oct. 25, as upgrader maintenance this
quarter is expected to curtail supply.  Suncor Energy Inc. (SU)  plans
to start work this month on its No. 2 upgrader near Fort
McMurray.  Canadian Natural Resources Ltd. (CNQ)  is performing work at
its Alberta plant in the third quarter.  Western Canada Select’s discount narrowed $2.25 to $9.25 a
barrel.  On the U.S. Gulf Coast, grades were unchanged or
strengthened. Light Louisiana Sweet’s premium to WTI was steady
at $16.25 a barrel. Heavy Louisiana Sweet was unchanged at
$16.50 over WTI.  Poseidon’s  premium  was unchanged at $12.70. Mars Blend’s
premium was steady at $12.60 a barrel over WTI. Southern Green
Canyon’s widened by 10 cents to $10.75.  Thunder Horse , a sour crude with lower sulfur content than
Mars, Poseidon and Southern Green Canyon, added 10 cents to a
premium of $15.25.  To contact the reporter on this story:
