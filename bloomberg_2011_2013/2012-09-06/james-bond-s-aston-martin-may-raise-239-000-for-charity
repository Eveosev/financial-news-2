A 2008  Aston Martin  six-liter V12
used by  Daniel Craig  in “ Quantum of Solace ” is among 40 lots
of James Bond memorabilia to go under the hammer at a charity
auction.  “The Aston Martin DBS plays a dramatic role in the opening
sequence of the film, in which Bond skillfully navigates winding
roads,” Christie’s International said today in an e-mailed
release. The car is expected to fetch as much as 150,000 pounds
($239,000).  The 40 lots will feature in an online sale from Sept. 28 to
Oct. 8, with another 10 offered at an invitation-only charity
event at Christie’s South Kensington on Oct. 5. All the items
will go on show at the London saleroom from Sept. 29 to Oct. 5.  Other lots include a belt with golden-bullet buckle worn by
Christopher Lee as Scaramanga in “The Man With the Golden
Gun”; a charcoal suit worn by  Pierce Brosnan  in “The World Is
Not Enough”; and a pair of  Tom Ford  sunglasses worn by Daniel
Craig in “Quantum of Solace.”  The lots are direct from the archives of EON Productions
and the proceeds will go to a dozen charities. Barnardo’s will
benefit from the sale of the Aston Martin. The charity evening
on Oct. 5 will mark “Global James Bond Day.” The new Bond film
“Skyfall” arrives in November.  (Richard Vines writes for Muse, the arts and culture
