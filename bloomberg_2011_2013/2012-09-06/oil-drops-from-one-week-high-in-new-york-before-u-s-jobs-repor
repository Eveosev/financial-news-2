Oil traded near the highest closing
price in almost a week amid signs the U.S. recovery is improving
and steps by China to stimulate its economy, indicating fuel
demand may rise in the world’s biggest crude users.  Futures were little changed after earlier dropping as much
as 1 percent. China approved plans for infrastructure projects
including roads, ports and waterways, according to statements on
the website of the National Development and Reform Commission
yesterday. U.S. jobless claims declined last week and companies
added more workers than forecast in August, reports showed
before government data due today. Oil is still headed for its
first weekly decline in six weeks.  Crude for October delivery was at $95.66 a barrel, up 13
cents, in electronic trading on the  New York Mercantile Exchange 
at 3:31 p.m. Singapore time. The contract climbed 17 cents
yesterday to $95.53, the highest close since Aug. 31. Futures
are down 0.8 percent this week and 3.2 percent in 2012.  Brent oil for October settlement on the London-based ICE
Futures Europe exchange was at $113.77 a barrel, up 28 cents.
The European benchmark crude was at an $18.11 premium to New
York-traded West Texas Intermediate grade, from $17.96
yesterday.  Moving Average  WTI has technical resistance along its 200-day moving
average, at $96.61 a barrel, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. Futures have halted their advance near that level the
past week. Sell orders tend to be clustered close to chart-
resistance levels. Oil also settled below an upward-sloping
trend channel for a second day yesterday, confirming a breach of
technical support. The channel started from $77.28 a barrel, the
2012 intraday low on June 28, and marks where futures rebounded
in early August.  The NDRC,  China ’s top planning body, approved 2,018
kilometers (1,254 miles) of highways in its second major
construction announcement this week. The agency also cleared
plans for sewage-treatment plants, waterway upgrades and port
and warehouse projects, without giving an investment amount.  U.S. initial unemployment claims decreased by 12,000 to
365,000 in the week ended Sept. 1, the Labor Department reported
yesterday. Private employers expanded payrolls by 201,000 in
August, according to figures from ADP Employer Services,
exceeding the 140,000 median gain forecast by economists in a
Bloomberg survey. Employment probably rose by 130,000 in August
after gaining 163,000 in July, according to a separate Bloomberg
survey before a Labor Department report today.  Oil advanced yesterday after an Energy Department report
showed U.S. crude stockpiles fell  7.4 million barrels  last week
to the lowest level in five months and the  European Central Bank 
announced a bond-buying plan to ease the region’s debt crisis.  Gasoline inventories dropped  2.3 million barrels , less than
a 3 million median estimate of 12 analysts surveyed by  Bloomberg
News . Distillate-fuel supplies, a category that includes heating
oil and diesel, gained 993,000 barrels, compared with projected
decline of 1.55 million.  To contact the reporters on this story:
