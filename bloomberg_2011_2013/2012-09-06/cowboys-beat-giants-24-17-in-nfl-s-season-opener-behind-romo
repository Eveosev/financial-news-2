Tony Romo  threw three touchdown
passes, two to Kevin Ogletree, as the Dallas Cowboys beat the
New York Giants 24-17 in the opening game of the National
Football League’s regular season.  This was the ninth consecutive year the NFL’s defending
champion has hosted the season-opener in a primetime game. The
Giants are the first reigning Super Bowl champion to lose in
that span.  The opening game at MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford, New
Jersey, was moved to Wednesday from Thursday to avoid a conflict
with President  Barack Obama ’s speech at the Democratic National
Convention.  Romo and Ogletree hooked up on touchdown passes of 10 and
40 yards to give the Cowboys a 14-3 third-quarter lead.  After  Ahmad Bradshaw  scored on a 10-yard run to pull the
Giants within 14-10 with 5:19 left in the third quarter, Dallas
got a 33-yard field goal from Dan Bailey and a 34-yard touchdown
catch from  Miles Austin  to push its lead to 24-10. The Giants
pulled within a touchdown with 2:36 left on a 9-yard scoring
pass from Eli Manning to Martellus Bennett, yet the Cowboys ran
out the remaining time on the clock to seal the win.  To contact the reporter on this story:
