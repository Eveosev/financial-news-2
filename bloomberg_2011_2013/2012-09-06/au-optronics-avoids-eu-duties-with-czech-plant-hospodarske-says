AU Optronics Corp., Taiwan’s second-
largest maker of liquid-crystal displays, plans to use its Czech
production plant to manufacture solar panels for European
countries and thus avoid paying import duties,  Hospodarske
Noviny  said, citing Lai-Juh Chen, the director of the company’s
solar division. The plant will manufacture 65,000 solar panels
with a total capacity of 150 megawatts this year, the newspaper
said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
