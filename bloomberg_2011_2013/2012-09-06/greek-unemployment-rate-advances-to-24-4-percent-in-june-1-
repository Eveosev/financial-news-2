Greece ’s  unemployment rate  jumped to
a record in June, approaching a quarter of the workforce as the
country’s five-year recession deepened.  The jobless rate rose to 24.4 percent from 23.5 percent in
May, according to an e-mailed statement from the Athens-based
Hellenic Statistical Authority today. That’s the highest since
the agency began publishing monthly data in 2004, and compares
with a 23.5 percent median forecast from a Bloomberg survey of
three economists.  “This is a grossly disappointing figure,” said Platon Monokroussos, chief economist at  Eurobank Ergasias SA. (EUROB) 
“Unemployment is a lagging indicator of overall economic
activity and thus the ratio may not have peaked yet.”  Greece’s recession has been exacerbated by austerity
measures imposed to trim a  budget deficit  that was more than
five times the euro-area limit in 2009. Prime Minister Antonis Samaras’s coalition government is hashing out an 11.5 billion-
euro ($14.5 billion) package of budget cuts for 2013 and 2014
needed to keep rescue loans from the euro area and  International
Monetary Fund  flowing.  A breakdown of the statistics showed the female
unemployment rate rose to 28.1 percent from 26.8 percent, while
the jobless rate for Greeks aged 15 to 24 rose to 55 percent,
the highest in the 27-nation European Union, from 54.9 percent
the previous month.  The highest regional rate was in Epirus and part of
Macedonia in northern Greece, where the rate reached 26.3
percent, up from 24.9 percent in May, according to the
statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
