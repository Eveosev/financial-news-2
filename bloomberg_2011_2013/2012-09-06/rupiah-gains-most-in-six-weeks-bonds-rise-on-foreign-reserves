Indonesia’s rupiah advanced by the
most in almost six weeks and  government bonds  gained after the
central bank said its foreign-exchange reserves increased in
August, boosting its ability to support the currency.  The yield on one-year sovereign bonds dropped to a two-week
low after global funds added 840 billion rupiah ($88 million) to
their local debt holdings in the first two days of this week,
finance ministry data show.  Foreign reserves  reached $109
billion, from $106.6 billion in July. That is “more than
sufficient” to cover an unexpected increase in imports, Deputy
Governor  Hartadi Sarwono  said today, adding that the central
bank will continue to intervene in the  currency market  if needed.  “Improving foreign reserves creates market expectations
that the rupiah will stabilize,” said Handy Yunianto, the head
of fixed-income research at PT Mandiri Sekuritas in Jakarta.
“Subsiding  currency risk  will prompt bonds to rally as foreign
investors re-enter the market.”  The rupiah strengthened 0.3 percent to 9,565 per dollar as
of 4:40 p.m. in Jakarta, prices from local banks compiled by
Bloomberg show. The currency reached 9,604 yesterday, the
weakest level since May 31. One-month implied volatility, which
measures exchange-rate swings used to price options, was
unchanged at 6.5 percent.  The yield on the government’s 9 percent bills maturing in
September 2013 fell 12 basis points, or 0.12 percentage point,
to 5.30 percent, the lowest level since Aug. 21, closing prices
from the Inter Dealer Market Association show. The yield on
Indonesia’s 7 percent bonds due May 2022 dropped two basis
points to 6.06 percent, the lowest since Aug. 24.  To contact the reporter on this story:
