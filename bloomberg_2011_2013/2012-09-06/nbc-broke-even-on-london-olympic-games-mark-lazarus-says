Comcast Corp. (CMCSA) ’s  NBC Universal  broke
even on its broadcast of the London Olympic Games, according to
Mark Lazarus, chairman of NBC Sports Group, who cited strong
ratings for the telecast.  “We were fortunate many U.S. teams and athletes performed
very well, and that was good for our ratings,” Lazarus said
today at the Bloomberg Sports Business Summit hosted by
Bloomberg Link in New York.  Advertising sales for the games soared to about $1.25
billion, exceeding NBC’s forecast and rising almost 50 percent
from the Beijing Olympics four years ago. Lazarus said on Aug. 2
the network had a “small chance” for a profit after initially
projecting a $200 million loss. NBC Universal paid about $1.18
billion for U.S. TV rights to the Olympics.  The London Games were the most watched U.S. television
event ever, drawing 219.4 million U.S. viewers.  NBC Universal, controlled by Philadelphia-based Comcast,
spent $4.38 billion for future U.S. TV Olympics rights through
2020. Comcast expects the 2014 and 2016 games to be profitable,
Chief Executive Officer  Brian Roberts  said last year.  Comcast rose 2.8 percent to $34.65 at the close in New
York. The stock has gained 46 percent this year and ranks  first 
for 2012 return in the  S&P 500 Media Index (S5MEDA)  of 16 companies.  To contact the reporter on this story:
