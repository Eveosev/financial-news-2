Belfius Bank NV, the state-owned
Belgian lender, swung to a profit in the first half after buying
back subordinated debt at a discount and said it won’t pay
dividends before 2016 to meet more stringent capital rules.  First-half net income of 252 million euros ($318 million)
compared with a loss of 100 million euros in the same period a
year earlier, the Brussels-based bank said today in a statement
handed out to reporters. Profit included a 430 million-euro gain
from discounted buybacks, which Belfius used to offset losses
from selling 3.1 billion euros of bonds including all of its
Spanish government debt.  Four to five years of retained profits should help Belfius
raise about 2 billion euros to reach a common equity ratio of 9
percent under Basel III capital rules, Chief Executive Officer
Jos Clijsters said. The bank’s core Tier 1 ratio rose to 12
percent at the end of June from 11.8 percent at the end of last
year. Chairman Alfred Bouckaert reiterated that Belfius won’t
seek taxpayer funds to raise capital.  “De-risking was ahead of our expectations so far and we’re
fully secured now in our exposure on Dexia,” Bouckaert told
reporters. “We will meet Basel III rules as they will be
implemented gradually.”  Under plans submitted to the European Commission, Belfius
will shrink its balance sheet to about 180 billion euros in
three to four years from about 220 billion euros at the end of
June, Chief Financial Officer Johan Vankelecom said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
