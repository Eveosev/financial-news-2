France had a hot and dry August as a
heat wave in the second half of the month drove up temperatures
in most of the country, the  Agriculture Ministry  reported.  The average temperature in France last month was 22.2
degrees Celsius (72 degrees Fahrenheit), 1.7 degrees above
normal, the ministry wrote in a  report  on its website today.
Rainfall of 40 millimeters (1.6 inches) was 18 percent less than
the usual amount.  The southwest of France, including the Aquitaine region
that grows 20 percent of the country’s corn, got 26 millimeters
of rain in August, 58 percent less than usual. Temperatures in
the region of 22.8 degrees Celsius were 2.3 degrees higher than
normal. France is the European Union’s biggest corn producer.  “Between Aug. 15 and Aug. 21, the country had a heat wave
that pushed up average daily temperatures to 27 or 28 degrees
for a large part of the country,” the ministry wrote. “The
rains in August are largely insufficient.”  The month was one of the driest August months since 1959,
the ministry wrote, citing weather office Meteo  France .  Precipitation in the southwest since the start of March has
been 8 percent less than normal, while the deficit is 5 percent
in the southeast, the report showed. Rain in the six-month
period was higher than usual in all other regions, with the
country on average receiving 8 percent more rain that normal
since March 1.  To contact the reporter on this story:
