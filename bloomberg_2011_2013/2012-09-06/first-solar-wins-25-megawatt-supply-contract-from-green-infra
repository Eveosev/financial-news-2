First Solar Corp., the largest maker
of thin-film photovoltaic panels, won a contract to supply 25
megawatts for a project that Green Infra Ltd. is developing in
India.  Timing for the supplying of the modules and terms weren’t
disclosed by Tempe, Arizona-based First Solar in a website
statement. Green Infra hired Germany’s Juwi Holding AG to design
