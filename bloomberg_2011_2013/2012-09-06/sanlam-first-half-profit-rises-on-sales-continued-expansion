Sanlam Ltd., (SLM)  the largest South
Africa-based insurer, said first-half profit increased 15
percent after the company sold more insurance policies and
expanded in the U.K. and  Africa .  So-called normalized earnings excluding one-time items
jumped to 2.54 billion rand ($303 million) in the six months
through June from 2.20 billion rand a year earlier, the Cape
Town-based insurance company said in a statement today. The
median estimate of three analysts in a Bloomberg survey was for
profit of 2.42 billion rand. New life-insurance business volumes
climbed 11 percent, Sanlam said.  “The operating environment in the second half of the year
is expected to remain challenging, with weak global economic
growth and volatility in investment markets also likely to
continue,” the company said. “Positive one-off items in this
reporting period as well as in the second half of 2011 are
likely to impact on our ability to sustain the current level of
growth in operating profit for the full year.”  Sanlam, which  operates  in Africa, Europe, the U.K., U.S.
and India, has excess capital and has been searching for
acquisitions to boost growth. This year it has targeted
acquisitions in Bermuda,  Kenya , the U.K.,  South Africa  and
Ghana. The insurer is also using cheaper insurance products in
South Africa to attract lower-income earners.  Sanlam has  gained  29 percent this year, making it the
third-best performer on the five-member  FTSE/JSE Africa Life
Assurance Index. (JLFEA)   To contact the reporter on this story:
