Israel aims to lower its  budget
deficit  to about 3.8 percent or 3.9 percent of economic output
by the end of this year, Finance Minister Yuval Steinitz said.  “This is what we are working toward,” Steinitz said at a
meeting of the Knesset Finance Committee near  Tel Aviv  today.
“I can’t promise at this point.”  The deficit was 4.1 percent in the 12 months through
August, more than double the original target as revenue lagged
behind forecasts, the  Finance Ministry  reported yesterday.  Israel’s parliament last month approved an increase in
value-added tax from Sept. 1 to help narrow the gap. It also
approved higher income taxes beginning in 2013 to help meet next
year’s revised deficit target of 3 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
