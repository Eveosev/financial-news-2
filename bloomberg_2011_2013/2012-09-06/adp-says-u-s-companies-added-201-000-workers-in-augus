Companies added more workers than
forecast in August, easing concern the U.S. job market may be
stalling, a private report based on payrolls showed.  The 201,000 increase in employment, the biggest gain in
five months, followed July’s revised 173,000 rise, Roseland, New
Jersey-based ADP Employer Services said today. The median
forecast of 41 economists surveyed by Bloomberg called for an
advance of 140,000.  A sustained pickup in hiring would help generate the wage
gains needed to spur  consumer spending , the biggest part of the
economy. A Labor Department report tomorrow may show private
payrolls rose by 138,000 in August, and unemployment held at 8.3
percent, according to the median forecast in a Bloomberg survey.  The ADP figure is “good news for the economy if it turns
out to be correct,”  Joel Naroff , president of Naroff Economic
Advisors Inc. in Holland,  Pennsylvania , said in an e-mail to
clients. “We may not be seeing a deluge of new jobs but it
clearly looks like firms are hiring again.”  Estimates in the Bloomberg survey ranged from 90,000 to
170,000.  Another report today showed fewer Americans than forecast
filed applications for jobless benefits last week. Jobless
claims dropped by 12,000 to 365,000 in the week ended Sept. 1,
the lowest in a month, the Labor Department reported.  Stock-index futures held gains after the labor market
figures. The contract on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index
expiring this month rose 0.5 percent to 1,409.9 at 8:38 a.m. in
 New York .  ADP Compared  Since April 2010, ADP’s initial estimate has either
overstated or understated the Labor Department’s initial reading
on private payrolls by 69,000 on average. The average miss for
the Bloomberg survey’s median forecast of economists was 58,000.  Goods-producing industries, which include manufacturers and
construction companies, increased payrolls by 16,000, today’s
figures showed. Employment in construction rose 10,000, while
factories added 3,000 jobs.  Service providers took on 185,000 workers, up from 156,000
a month earlier.  Companies employing more than 499 workers added 16,000
jobs. Medium-sized businesses, with 50 to 499 employees, added
86,000 and small companies increased payrolls by 99,000, ADP
said.  The Labor Department’s report tomorrow may show overall
hiring, which includes government jobs, climbed 127,000 last
month after rising 163,000 in July, according to the Bloomberg
survey median. The  jobless rate  has held above 8 percent since
February 2009.  Fed’s Bernanke  “The stagnation of the labor market in particular is a
grave concern,” Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said
in an Aug. 31 speech in  Jackson Hole ,  Wyoming . Persistently high
unemployment “will wreak structural damage on our economy that
could last for many years.”  St. Jude Medical Inc., a maker of heart rhythm devices,
last month said it is firing 300 workers in a reorganization to
save $50 million to $60 million in annual pretax expenses
starting next year.  Others trimming their workforce include  Edison
International (EIX) , owner of  California ’s second-largest electric
utility, which will reduce staff at its shuttered San Onofre
nuclear plant by about 730 positions by the fourth quarter.  The ADP report is based on data from businesses with more
than 21 million workers on payrolls. Macroeconomic Advisers LLC
