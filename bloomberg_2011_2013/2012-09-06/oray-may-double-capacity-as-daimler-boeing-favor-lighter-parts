Toray Industries Inc. (3402) , the world’s
largest producer of carbon fiber, plans to increase capacity as
customers from  Daimler AG (DAI)  to  Boeing Co. (BA)  boost the use of the
lightweight material to make fuel-efficient cars and planes.  Capacity at the end of the decade may double from a
targeted level of 27,100 metric tons a year in 2015, Moriyuki Onishi, senior vice president and head of the carbon-fiber
composites division, said in an interview.  Toray expects sales of carbon-fiber composite materials to
 increase  29 percent to 90 billion yen ($1.1 billion) in the
financial year ending March 2013, or 5 percent of its estimated
1.7 trillion yen revenue, according to an Aug. 6 statement. The
company and rival  Teijin Ltd. (3401)  forged partnerships with Daimler
and  General Motors Co. (GM) , respectively, to develop and produce
carbon-fiber parts for cars.  “Carbon fiber has big potential as automakers look into a
variety of materials,” Onishi said in the interview on Sept. 5
in Tokyo, where Toray is based. “We’re trying to bring costs
down and speed production through technology development.”  Ramp-up plans for Boeing’s 787, the first aircraft built
with carbon-fiber reinforced plastic, and the launch of Airbus
SAS’ A350 wide-body aircraft will enable Toray to boost aviation
sales almost four times to 100 billion yen a year by the end of
this decade, Onishi said.  The 787 Dreamliner, designed to be 20 percent more fuel
efficient, uses lightweight composites for half of its
structure, a departure from traditional reliance on aluminum.
The A350 will compete with Boeing’s 787 and 777 long-range
aircraft.  Capacity Expansion  Toray shares  gained 3.7 percent, the most since Aug. 6, to
close at 477 yen in  Tokyo , paring their decline this year to 13
percent. Toray is the top producer of the material in the 40,000
ton-a-year global market, Onishi said.  The company said in March it would invest 45 billion yen to
boost global carbon fiber output capacity 50 percent to 27,100
tons by 2015 as it builds its first plant in  South Korea  and
expands plants and facilities in  Japan , the U.S. and France.  Carbon fiber is about 10 times stronger and 75 percent
lighter than steel, Toray said in a presentation. The cost of
carbon fiber ranges from 2,000 yen to 5,000 yen a kilogram (2.2
pounds), according to Takato Watabe, a Tokyo-based analyst at
Deutsche Securities Inc.  Nippon Steel Corp. (5401) , Japan’s biggest
maker of the alloy, sold products for 800 yen a kilogram in the
last quarter.  Luxury Cars  Toray’s carbon-fiber parts, including roofs and bonnets,
are used in luxury sports cars including Toyota Motor Corp.’s
Lexus LFA, the Mercedes-Benz and  Volkswagen AG (VOW) ’s Lamborghini.
While the current carbon-fiber market is limited to 5,000
supercars, it may expand to 5 million vehicles by 2020,
according to a company presentation this month.  Teijin, the second-largest carbon-fiber maker, is working
with GM to develop carbon-fiber composites using a new
technology that cuts molding time to enable mass production.  Osaka-based Teijin said in December it plans to supply
carbon-fiber parts to 1 million cars a year by 2020 and expects
automotive sales from the new technology of as much as 200
billion yen a year.  Steelmakers, facing competition from producers of
materials, including carbon fiber and aluminum, say the alloy
will remain suitable for vehicles in the future.  WorldAutoSteel, the automotive group of the World Steel
Association, including Nippon Steel, Posco and  ArcelorMittal (MT) ,
said last year next-generation eco cars built with steel would
be 35 percent lighter than gasoline-powered vehicles and cut
total lifecycle carbon-dioxide emissions by about 70 percent,
appealing to the  auto industry .  To contact the reporter on this story:
