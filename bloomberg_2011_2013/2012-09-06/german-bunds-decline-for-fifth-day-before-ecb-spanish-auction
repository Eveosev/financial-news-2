German 10-year bunds fell for a
fifth day amid speculation the  European Central Bank  will unveil
details of a bond-purchase plan to cap borrowing costs for so-
called peripheral euro-area nations.  Spain ’s two-year notes declined as demand fell at an
auction of short-dated government debt. German two-year  yields 
rose to a two-month high amid speculation steps by the central
bank today will boost demand for higher-yielding assets. The
yield difference between German and Italian 10-year securities
narrowed to the least in almost four months. The ECB will cut
its refinancing  rate  to 0.5 percent from 0.75 percent, according
to 30 out of 58 economists in a Bloomberg News survey.  “The market is expecting something that could be positive
for risk appetite and would naturally be in favor of spread
narrowing within the euro zone,” said  Karsten Linowsky , a
fixed-income strategist at Credit Suisse Group AG in Zurich.
“In general we can imagine that bund yields go higher in the
medium term irrespective” of what the ECB does today, he said.  The 10-year bund yield rose three basis points, or 0.03
percentage point, to 1.51 percent at 11:34 a.m. London time,
after reaching 1.54 percent, the highest level since Aug. 22.
The 1.5 percent security due in September 2022 declined 0.255,
or 2.55 euros per 1,000-euro ($1,262) face amount to 99.94. Two-
year yields added three basis points to 0.01 percent, after
climbing to as high as 0.035 percent, the most since July 5.  The central bank will announce its decision at 1:45 p.m. in
Frankfurt. ECB President  Mario Draghi  will hold a press
conference 45 minutes later.  ECB Proposal  Draghi will provide details of a bond-buying proposal that
will have unlimited purchases and will be sterilized to ease
concerns about printing money, two central bank officials
briefed on the plan said yesterday. The ECB will refrain from
setting a public cap on yields, according to the people, and a
third official, who spoke on condition of anonymity.  German bunds rallied after the previous ECB meeting on Aug.
2, with 10-year yields dropping 14 basis points and two-year
rates falling to a record minus 0.097 percent, amid concern
Draghi didn’t announce sufficient measures to contain the
region’s debt crisis.  “Expectations for today’s meeting are correspondingly high
and scope for disappointment has developed, in our view, as the
markets have priced in a clear decision,” Viola Julien, an
analyst at Helaba Landesbank Hessen-Thueringen in  Frankfurt ,
wrote in e-mailed comments. “Bond purchases by the ECB are not
without risk or controversy.”  Spanish Auction  The extra yield that investors demand to hold Italian 10-
year bonds instead of similar-maturity German bunds shrank three
basis points to 4 percentage points after narrowing to 3.87
percentage points, the least since May 8.  Volatility on Spanish bonds was the highest in euro-region
markets today, followed by France and  Italy , according to
measures of 10-year bonds, the spread between two- and 10-year
securities, and credit default swaps.  Spain sold 3.5 billion euros of securities at an auction
today, the Bank of Spain said. The nation sold notes maturing in
2014 at an average yield of 2.798 percent, compared with 4.706
percent when they were sold in June. Investors bid for 2.01
times the amount allotted, down from 3.97 times at the June
auction. It also sold debt maturing in 2015 and 2016.  Ireland, Portugal  Spanish two-year note yields increased 20 basis points to
3.30 percent, while those on Italian securities with a similar
maturity rose 18 basis points to 2.63 percent.  Portugal ’s two-year notes advanced on speculation that the
ECB may buy the securities as part of its plan. The rate fell
five basis points to 4.79 percent.  “It will be interesting to see whether the plan will be
immediately applied to Ireland and Portugal,” said Piet Lammens, head of research at KBC Bank NV in Brussels. “For
these countries, Draghi may confirm that they can benefit from
ECB buying and that would be something that the market would
embrace.”  French 10-year bonds snapped an eight-day decline as the
nation sold 3 billion euros of bonds maturing in April 2022 at
an average yield of 2.21 percent, the  lowest  at any auction
since at least 1999. Ten-year yields slipped two basis points to
2.22 percent.  German  government bonds  returned 3.3 percent this year
through yesterday, according to indexes compiled by Bloomberg
and the European Federation of Financial Analysts Societies.
Spanish bonds have fallen 1.6 percent and Italian debt gained 13
percent, the indexes show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
