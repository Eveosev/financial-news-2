Pioneers Holding (PIOH) , the Cairo-based
investment bank, said its second-quarter profit rose by 24
percent as revenues from its subsidiaries doubled over the last
six months.  Net income increased  to 37.8 million Egyptian pounds from
30.4 million pounds a year earlier, the company said in a
statement to the Egyptian bourse. Revenues jumped to 433.1
million pounds from 45.5 million pounds.  “What’s reflected is the result of the company’s
aggressive expansion over the last year,” Khaled El Tayeb, a
Pioneers board member, said in a telephone interview. “We made
more than 600 million pounds worth of investments, and all of
the companies doubled their profit over the last six months.”  The biggest investments have been in listed subsidiaries
such as  El Kahera Housing (ELKA) ,  Egyptian Electrical Cables (ELEC)  and  Upper
Egypt Contracting (UEGC) , the director said. The company’s expenses
soared from 1.5 million to 322.5 million pounds, a result of its
subsidiaries’ restructuring costs, El Tayeb said.  The company is still waiting for new regulations on global
depositary receipts by the Egyptian Finance Services Authority
before listing in New York, he said. Expectations for the next
six months are “very good”, especially from Pioneers’
financial services divisions, El Tayeb said.  Pioneers’ shares  rose 1.3 percent to 4.71 pounds at the
close in Cairo, valuing the company at 2.36 billion pounds. The
stock has surged 112 percent this year, compared with a 53
percent rise for the benchmark  EGX 30 Index. (EGX30)   To contact the reporter on this story:
