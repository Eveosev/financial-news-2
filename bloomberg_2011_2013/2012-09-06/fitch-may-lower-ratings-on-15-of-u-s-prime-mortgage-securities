Fitch Ratings  said that it may lower
about 15 percent of its credit grades on securities backed by
U.S. prime mortgages, typically those too large for government-
tied programs when they were issued.  More than 90 percent of the bonds under review were created
in 2005 or earlier, the New York-based ratings firm said today
in a statement. In a report earlier today, Fitch said that such
debt is being made riskier by “adverse selection” after
better-quality borrowers refinanced their portion of the
underlying loans. The securities have “historically performed
well,” with 93 percent of the roughly $650 billion issued
already repaid, Fitch said.  Downgraded senior-ranked securities are “still generally
expected to retain investment-grade ratings and thus are
expected to recover full principal,” Fitch said. Ratings cuts
are likely to be one to two categories, it said.  So-called jumbo mortgages issued in 2005 were smaller than
$359,650 for single-family properties, with the limits lower in
earlier years. Ratings companies such as Fitch generally don’t
assess the creditworthiness of debt in the larger market for
government-backed mortgage bonds.  To contact the reporter on this story:
