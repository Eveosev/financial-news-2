Canadian Prime Minister Stephen
Harper said his government will make a “broad” review of
Beijing-based Cnooc Ltd.’s takeover bid for  Nexen Inc. (NXY)   Harper said the main legal test for a foreign takeover is
the so-called net benefit test, speaking during an interview in
Vancouver with Bloomberg Television’s  Erik Schatzker .  “We will be looking at that idea and our definition of net
benefit will be very broad,” Harper said. He also said that the
bid needs extra scrutiny because Cnooc is state-owned, and that
like all reviews, national security issues will be taken into
account.  To contact the reporter on this story:
