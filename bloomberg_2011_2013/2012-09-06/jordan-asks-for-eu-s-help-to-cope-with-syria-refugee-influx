Jordanian prime minister Fayez al- Tarawneh said the country needs help from the European Union to
cope with an influx of refugees fleeing fighting in  Syria .  “We face a serious problem in water supply but we do
everything we can to help them,” al-Tarawneh said after meeting
Cypriot president Demetris Christofias in Amman today.  Jordan needs support providing food and education for
Syrian refugees, he said, according to a  statement  on the Web
site of the Nicosia based  Press and Information Office .  To contact the reporter on this story:
