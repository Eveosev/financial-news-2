Emerging-market stocks maintained
gains as European Central Bank President  Mario Draghi  announced
details of the bank’s bond-purchase program.  The  MSCI Emerging Markets Index (MXEF)  climbed 0.4 percent to
942.82 at 1:52 p.m. in London. South Africa’s rand appreciated
0.5 percent against the dollar, leading gains among developing-
nation currencies.  Draghi said policy makers agreed to an unlimited bond-
purchase program. The central bank reduced its 2012 forecast for
gross domestic product, he said. Draghi spoke at a press
briefing in Frankfurt.  Nations in the MSCI index send about 30 percent of their
exports to the European Union, according to the World Trade
Organization.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
