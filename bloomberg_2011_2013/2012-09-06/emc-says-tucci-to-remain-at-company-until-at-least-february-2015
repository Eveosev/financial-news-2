EMC Corp. (EMC)  said Chief Executive
Officer Joe Tucci will remain at the company through at least
February 2015 under an amended employment agreement.  The board expects Tucci to transfer his role as CEO to a
successor and become solely chairman of EMC and majority-owned
 VMware Inc. (VMW)  sometime earlier, the company said yesterday in a
regulatory  filing . EMC’s board also approved an $8 million grant
to Tucci of restricted stock units, which are tied to
performance targets, according to the filing.  EMC had previously said Tucci would remain CEO until at
least the end of 2013. He has said his successor will probably
be an internal candidate. A management shuffle between EMC and
VMware in July left Tucci’s top lieutenants as EMC President and
Chief Operating Officer David Goulden; Paul Maritz, who moved
from VMware CEO to oversee EMC strategy; and Pat Gelsinger, who
moved from EMC to run VMware.  When announcing the executive moves, Tucci, who has been
CEO since 2001, made comments that indicated he wasn’t looking
to leave Hopkinton, Massachusetts-based EMC any time soon. EMC
shares are up 28 percent this year.  “I will not overextend my welcome by any means, but as
long as I’m enjoying it, providing value, they want me, the
board wants me --  I’m very energized so I’m not putting any
firm end date in the sand,” he said in July.  -- Editors: Reed Stevenson, Stephen West  To contact the reporter on this story:
