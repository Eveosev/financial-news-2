Warwickshire routed Worcestershire
by an innings and 202 runs to win its first English county
cricket championship since 2004.  Worcestershire trailed by 311 runs when it resumed play on
day three at New Road on 100-2. The home side was then dismissed
for 209, with  Alan Richardson  the last man out shortly after
lunch.  Chris Wright  took 4-65 for Warwickshire, with Keith Barker
claiming three wickets. Moeen Ali top-scored for Worcestershire
with 72 not out.  Wright and Barker took five wickets each as Worcestershire,
the divisionâ€™s last-placed club, was bowled out for 60 in its
first innings. Varun Chopra then scored 195 as Warwickshire
reached 471-8 and declared before tea yesterday.  The victory completed a two-year turnaround for
Warwickshire, which just avoided relegation in 2010 and finished
second to Lancashire last season.  To contact the reporter on this story:
