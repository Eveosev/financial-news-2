National Football League
Commissioner  Roger Goodell  said the league is evaluating
shortening the four-game preseason because fans don’t like it.  The league, which plays four preseason games before
starting a 16-game regular season, is looking at 2-16 and 2-18
formats, Goodell said at the Bloomberg Sports Business Summit
hosted by  Bloomberg Link  in New York.  The league can change the format of the season without
approval from the players union, Goodell said, but wouldn’t
exclude the players from taking part in the decision. The issue
came up during labor negotiations last year.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
