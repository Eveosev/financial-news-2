EdX, the online school founded by
 Harvard University  and the  Massachusetts Institute of
Technology , will offer proctored final exams to allow students
to use their results for credentials and job applications.  Online learners who want to provide potential employers
with independently validated certificates will be able to take
exams at more than 450 test sites worldwide run by Pearson VUE,
a unit of London-based education publisher  Pearson Plc (PSON) , EdX said
today in an e-mailed statement.  Harvard and MIT, both based in Cambridge, Massachusetts,
announced the formation of EdX on May 2. The nonprofit venture,
funded with $30 million from each university, provides courses
from those schools and the  University of California , Berkeley.
Proctored tests means job-seekers can present their results to
potential employers, Anant Agarwal, an MIT professor who is
president of EdX, said in the statement.  “This option enhances the value of our courses in the real
world,” Agarwal said. It “is a natural evolution of EdX’s core
philosophy of transforming lives through education.”  Test takers will be charged “a modest fee,” according to
the statement. Courses are free, according to the  EdX website .
The first proctored test will be offered in the fall.  EdX’s class on circuits and electronics, taught by Agarwal
and others, started yesterday, according to the website. Courses
for chemistry, computer programming and public health will begin
later this month and in October.  To contact the reporter on this story:
