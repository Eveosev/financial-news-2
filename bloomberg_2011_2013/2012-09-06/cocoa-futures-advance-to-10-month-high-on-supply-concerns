Cocoa futures jumped to a 10-month
high on speculation that dry weather may hurt crops in West
Africa and  Southeast Asia . Sugar advanced.  While rains are forecast in northern parts of  Ivory Coast ,
the world’s top cocoa producer, and Ghana, the second-largest,
southern areas of the two nations will stay dry in the next 15
days, according to MDA Information Systems Inc. Prices headed
for the ninth gain in 10 sessions.  “More rain is needed in southern growing areas” in West
Africa,  Jack Scoville , a vice president at Price Futures Group
in  Chicago , said in a report. “There is still talk about El
Nino, and that it could harm crops next year in western Africa
and Indonesia as it develops.”  Cocoa for December delivery rose 1.4 percent to $2,692 a
metric ton at 11:04 a.m. on ICE Futures U.S. in New York.
Earlier, the price reached $2,707, the highest for a most-active
contract since Nov. 8. Through yesterday, the commodity advanced
26 percent this year.  “Trends are up” for prices amid strong demand and a lack
of supply, Scoville said yesterday in a telephone interview.  In the week ended Aug. 28,  hedge funds  and other large
speculators increased bullish bets to the highest since March
2011, data from the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission
showed on Aug. 31.  Raw-sugar futures for delivery in October gained 0.3
percent to 19.06 cents a pound in  New York .  To contact the reporter on this story:
