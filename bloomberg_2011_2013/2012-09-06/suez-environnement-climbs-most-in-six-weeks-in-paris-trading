Suez Environnement, the second-
largest water company, rose the most in six weeks in Paris
trading, the second-best performance on the Stoxx 600 Utilities
Index after  Iberdrola SA. (IBE)   Suez Environnement, 36 percent-owned by  GDF Suez (GSZ)  SA,
climbed 5.9 percent to 9.348 euros, topping the Stoxx 600
Utilities Index’s 2 percent gain.  The utility said last month that it would raise its cost-
savings target by 40 million euros ($51 million) this year to
150 million euros and may sell some smaller assets. The Paris-
