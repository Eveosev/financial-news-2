Pan American Silver Corp.’s (PAA)  mine in
Bolivia is being partially occupied by miners demanding more
jobs, according to state newswire ABI.  ABI said the occupation began Tuesday night, citing Hector
Cordova, the president of Bolivia’s Mining Corporation, or
Comibol. Pan American Silver has a 95 percent interest in PASB,
which jointly owns the mine with Comibol, according to Pan
American Silver’s website.  Kettina Cordero, a spokeswoman for Vancouver-based Pan
American Silver, didn’t immediately return a telephone call and
e-mail seeking comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
