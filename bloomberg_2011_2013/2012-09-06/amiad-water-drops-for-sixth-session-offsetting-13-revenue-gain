Amiad Water Systems Ltd. (AFS) , an Israeli
water filtration system producer, fell for a sixth session in
 London  as a “slight dip” in municipal operations offset a 13
percent rise in first-half revenue from a year earlier.  The water treatment company founded 50 years ago at a
kibbutz lost 5.6 percent to 338.50 pence, the most since June
2010, after reporting results for the six months through June
included $66.4 million in revenue compared with $59 million for
the first half of 2011.  Amiad said it was expanding due to increased investment in
water infrastructure, primarily in the Brazil-Russia-India-China
regions, and started the second half of the year with a higher
backlog than a year earlier.  The company also reported “particularly strong” sales in
U.S. ballast water operations that clean vessels’ ballast water
and help protect the marine environment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
