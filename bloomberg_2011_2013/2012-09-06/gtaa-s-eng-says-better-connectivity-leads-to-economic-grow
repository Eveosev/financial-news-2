Greater Toronto Airports Authority
Chief Executive Officer Howard Eng says better infrastructure
and connectively leads to economic growth.  Traveling needs to be made as easy as possible, Eng said
today at the Bloomberg Canada-Asia Conference in  Vancouver .  “Running one of the key gateway hubs for  Canada , we have
to ensure that as the front door to Canada, that I create an
environment for Canadian business to use the Toronto airport and
make it hassle free,” said the head of Canada’s busiest airport
said.  Eng said China shouldn’t just be seen as a market for cheap
goods but people in the Asian nation are growing wealthier and
have more money to spend on travel.  Arrivals of non-resident travelers from China, excluding
 Hong Kong , rose 23 percent in the first six months of this year
to 141,997, compared with 115,428 the same period in 2011,
according to data from  Statistics Canada . Over the past decade,
arrivals from China tripled to more than 20,000 a month, the
data show.  To contact the reporters on this story:
