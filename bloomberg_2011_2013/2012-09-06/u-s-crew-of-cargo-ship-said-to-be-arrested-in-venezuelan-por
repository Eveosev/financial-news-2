The crew of a U.S.-owned merchant
ship was arrested in the Venezuelan port of Maracaibo after
weapons were found on board, a U.S. embassy official said.  The captain and 14 crew members, all U.S. citizens, were
arrested Aug. 31 following an inspection in which three assault
rifles were discovered on the cargo ship Ocean Atlas, said the
official, who wasn’t authorized to discuss the case publicly.
Venezuelan authorities weren’t satisfied when told that the
rifles were aboard the craft because of fears of attacks from
pirates, the official said.  The arrests follow the August detention of an unnamed U.S.
citizen attempting to enter  Venezuela  from  Colombia  whom
President  Hugo Chavez  said may be a “mercenary.” The U.S. and
Venezuela have frequently clashed since Chavez, a self-declared
“anti-imperialist,” came to power 13 years ago. Chavez, who
faces elections on Oct. 7, accuses the U.S. of having supported
a 2002 coup against him.  The  Ocean Atlas  is a heavy-lift, box-hold, multipurpose
vessel, according to a description of the ship on the website of
New Orleans-based Intermarine LLC.  Chalice McGee, head of corporate communications at
Intermarine, didn’t immediately return a message seeking
comment. A press official at the Interior and Justice Ministry
wasn’t immediately available. A press official at the Ports
Ministry deferred comment to the  Interior Ministry .  To contact the reporters on this story:
