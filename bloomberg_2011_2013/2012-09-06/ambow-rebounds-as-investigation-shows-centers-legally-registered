Ambow Education Holding Ltd. (AMBO)  jumped
in  New York  as the Chinese private education services provider
said an internal probe found that its tutoring centers are
legally registered and it doesn’t expect financial restatements.  Ambow jumped 10 percent to $2.50 as of 11:10 a.m. in New
York as trading resumed. The company slumped a record 27 percent
yesterday before trading was suspended.  All one-on-one tutoring centers operated by Jinghan Yingcai
Education and Technology Co., a unit of Ambow, are legally
registered with local industrial registration agencies and tax
bureaus, and the company is not aware of any pending regulatory
reviews, Beijing-based Ambow said today in a PRNewswire
statement.  Ambow tumbled yesterday after the company said Sept. 4 in
an online  statement  that it started an internal investigation
after  China ’s state television reported a day earlier that its
unit exaggerated training results and that the schools’
registrations were incomplete.  Ambow has completed its internal review regarding the media
reports and has no plan to hire third-party advisers to assist
with any further internal review, it said today.   To contact the reporter on this story:
