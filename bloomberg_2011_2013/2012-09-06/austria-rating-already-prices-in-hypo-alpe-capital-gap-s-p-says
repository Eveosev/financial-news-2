Austria’s AA+ rating at  Standard &
Poor’s  already prices in Hypo Alpe-Adria-Bank International AG’s
capital gap, according to Anna Lozmann, an analyst at S&P in
 Frankfurt .  Lozmann spoke at a briefing in Vienna today.  Hypo Alpe, the nationalized Austrian lender loaded with bad
debt, said today that its capital need rose to 2.19 billion
euros.  The risk of further state capital injections into banks was
one of the main reasons the Alpine republic lost its AAA rating
at Standard & Poor’s and was put on negative outlook at Moody’s
Investors Service earlier this year.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
