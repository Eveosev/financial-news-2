Canada ’s dollar gained to a four-
month high versus its U.S. peer before reports forecast to show
the nation’s employers added jobs in August after a decline the
prior month.  The currency strengthened against the yen before a U.S.
monthly payroll report and after industry data yesterday showed
American companies hired more workers last month than analysts
predicted. The Canadian dollar rose with crude-oil and stocks
after ECB President Mario Draghi yesterday said policy makers
had agreed on an unlimited debt-buying program.  “The market is basically looking for a 10,000 number out
of Canada,”  Dean Popplewell , head analyst in Toronto at the
online currency-trading firm Oanda Corp., said in a telephone
interview. “Certainly something much better than last month.
But the risk-on and risk-off will depend on” the U.S. payroll
number, he said.  Canada’s currency, nicknamed the loonie for the image of
the waterfowl on the C$1 coin, appreciated 0.1 percent to 98.19
cents per  U.S. dollar  at 8:14 a.m. in Toronto. It touched 98.05,
the strongest since April 30. One Canadian dollar buys $1.0185.  Crude-oil futures rose 0.7 percent in New York. Standard &
Poor’s 500 Index futures gained 0.4 percent.  Canadian employers  added 10,000 jobs in August,  Statistics
Canada  is forecast to report, after unexpectedly cutting 30,400
jobs the prior month. The employment rate is forecast to remain
steady at 7.3 percent, according to another survey.  To contact the reporter on this story:
