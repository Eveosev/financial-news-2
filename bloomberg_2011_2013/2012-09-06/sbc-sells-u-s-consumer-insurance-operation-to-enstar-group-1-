HSBC Holdings Plc (HSBA) , Europe’s largest
bank, agreed to sell its U.S. insurance manufacturing business
to  Enstar Group Ltd. (ESGR)  for about $181 million in cash.  The final price will depend on the valuation of the
business and the amount of capital it has upon completion,
scheduled for the first quarter of 2013, London-based HSBC said
today in a statement. The unit concentrates on contracts written
for consumers, according to its annual report.  Stuart Gulliver , chief executive officer since January
2011, is seeking to cut costs by $2.5 billion to $3.5 billion
and revive profit by selling assets to focus on emerging
economies in which the bank has a greater market share. He has
overseen more than 36 asset sales and closures, including the
disposal of its U.S. credit card unit to Capital One Financial
Corp. The bank’s 2003 purchase of Household International Inc.
required the bank to set aside more than $65 billion for souring
loans in North America.  “HSBC group companies in North America will continue to
support client needs and offer creditor and life insurance
products to their customers through third-party providers,” the
bank said in the statement.  Enstar, based in  Bermuda , buys assets from insurers seeking
to exit businesses.  -- Editors: Jon Menon, Steve Bailey  To contact the reporter on this story:
