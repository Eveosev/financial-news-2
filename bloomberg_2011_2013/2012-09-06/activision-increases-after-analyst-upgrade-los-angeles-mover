Activision Blizzard Inc. (ATVI) , the maker
of the “Call of Duty” video games, gained the most in more
than a month after Piper Jaffray upgraded the stock to
overweight from neutral.  Activision  increased  3.5 percent to $12.23 at the close,
the biggest gain since July 18. The Santa Monica, California-
based company has declined 1 percent this year.  Michael Olson , an analyst with Piper Jaffray in
Minneapolis, raised his 12-month price target for the shares to
$14 from $13, citing new editions of “Call of Duty,” “World
of Warcraft” and “Skylanders.” The games will appear on
shelves in time for the holiday season.  “A streamlined, franchise-focused portfolio is poised to
outperform,” Olson wrote in a note to investors today.
“Investor sentiment is positioned to improve as risk-averse
investors discover the reliability of Activision’s business
model.”  Activision, led by Chief Executive Officer Bobby Kotick
since 1992, is 61 percent owned by Paris-based  Vivendi SA (VIV) , also
parent of Universal Music. The French company is under pressure
from investors to boost its share price and Chairman Jean-Rene Fourtou on July 12 said “it’s a possibility” his company may
sell Activision.  To contact the reporter on this story:
