Russia has allocated $7.5 billion to
build its 2014 Winter Olympic complex, about a third of the
total investment in the site and surrounding region, according
to Deputy Prime Minister Dmitry Kozak.  The government is providing just under 92 billion rubles
($2.9 billion), while private investors are spending about 150
billion rubles, Kozak said by e-mail in response to questions.
The Olympics in the Black Sea resort of Sochi and other large
infrastructure project will bolster the economy, he said.  “The economic legacy of these projects will primarily
remove infrastructure burdens and help economic development,”
Kozak said yesterday. “As regards Sochi specifically, we’re
talking about boosting transport, engineering and energy
infrastructure by several times.”  President  Vladimir Putin  has sought to attract large
international events, which also include the soccer  World Cup 
and this week’s Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit. Russia
has spent about 660 billion rubles on preparations for the APEC
forum in Vladivostok and will invest 300 billion rubles in the
World Cup in 2018.  The government has plans to ensure the Sochi infrastructure
will continue to be used after the Games, with the stadium built
for the Olympic opening ceremony earmarked for training Russian
soccer teams and hosting World Cup matches, Kozak said.  Private investment in the Sochi region through 2025 may be
maintained at about the same level after the Games as for the
Olympics, according to the deputy premier.  To contact the reporter on this story:
