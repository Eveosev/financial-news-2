The Organization for Economic
Cooperation and Development predicted the U.K. economy will
contract this year as it cut its forecast because of the
persistence of the euro-region crisis.  Gross domestic product will shrink 0.7 percent this year
instead of the previously predicted expansion of 0.5 percent,
the OECD said in a report published today. The forecast doesn’t
account for likely growth shifts following the additional
Diamond Jubilee bank holiday in June or the London  Olympic Games 
last month, the Paris-based organization said.  Prime Minister  David Cameron  this week pledged to stick to
his fiscal squeeze as he reorganized his government after a
deepening recession hurt poll ratings. The continuing turmoil in
the euro area is sapping demand for exports, while budget cuts
are hurting confidence at home.  “The loss of momentum at the Group of Seven level may
persist throughout the latter half of this year, with the
recession in the euro area and associated trade and confidence
headwinds enduring,” the OECD said.  -- Editors: Craig Stirling, Simone Meier  To contact the reporter on this story:
