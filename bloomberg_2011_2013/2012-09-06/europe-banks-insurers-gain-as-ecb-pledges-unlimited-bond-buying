European financial companies  gained ,
led by Spanish insurer  Mapfre (MAP)  SA and UniCredit SpA, Italy’s
biggest bank, after European Central Bank President  Mario Draghi 
said policy makers agreed to an unlimited bond-buying program.  Mapfre climbed as much as 13 percent in Madrid trading and
UniCredit jumped as much as 8.6 percent in Milan.  Credit
Agricole (ACA)  SA, France’s third-biggest lender, advanced as much as
9.4 percent as the 38-member Bloomberg Europe Banks and
Financial Services Index rose 4.5 percent by 5:04 p.m. Frankfurt
time.  Draghi said today that policy makers agreed to a bond-
buying program without limits to regain control of interest
rates in the euro area. The ECB’s pledge to buy debt helped buoy
financial stocks, said  Simon Maughan , a financial strategist at
Olivetree Securities Ltd. in London.  “Now we have a buyer for the bonds,” said Maughan.
“Draghi has delivered pretty much as was leaked beforehand.”  The ECB will target government bonds with maturities of one
to three years, including longer-dated debt that has a residual
maturity of that length, Draghi said.  Purchases will be fully sterilized, meaning that the
overall impact on the  money supply  will be neutral, he said. It
will be up to governments such as Spain and Italy to trigger ECB
bond purchases by requesting aid from Europe’s rescue fund and
signing up for conditions.  To contact the reporter on this story:
