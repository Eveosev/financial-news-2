Ethanol rebounded from an eight-week
low in  Chicago  as both corn and gasoline climbed on concern that
supplies are slipping.  Prices rose after the Energy Department reported that
gasoline supplies fell 2.33 million barrels to 198.9 million
last week as Hurricane Isaac idled 13 percent of Gulf Coast
production. Corn for December delivery rose 1 percent to $7.985
a bushel as a Bloomberg survey showed the U.S. crop probably
will be the lowest since 2003.  “You’ve got strength in gasoline and strength in corn,”
said  Dan Flynn , a trader at Price Futures Group in Chicago.
“That pretty much added strength to ethanol.”  Denatured ethanol for September delivery climbed 1.1 cents,
or 0.4 percent, to $2.539 a gallon on the Chicago Board of
Trade. The contract expired today. Futures have gained 15
percent this year.  Ethanol in the U.S. is made mostly from corn and blended
with gasoline to stretch supplies and meet federal mandates. One
bushel of the grain makes at least 2.75 gallons of the biofuel.  In cash market trading, ethanol in the U.S. Gulf increased
2.5 cents, or 1 percent, to $2.62 a gallon and on the West Coast
the additive rose 2 cents, or 0.8 percent, to $2.695, data
compiled by Bloomberg shows.  Ethanol in  New York  slipped 0.5 cent to $2.615 a gallon and
in Chicago the biofuel decreased 0.5 cent to $2.53.  Ethanol traded at a 45.2-cent  discount  to the motor fuel
today, up from yesterday’s 42.18 cents.  Gasoline for October delivery jumped 4.12 cents, or 1.4
percent, to $2.991 a gallon on the  New York Mercantile Exchange .
The contract covers reformulated gasoline, which is made to be
blended with ethanol before delivery to filling stations.  To contact the reporter on this story:
