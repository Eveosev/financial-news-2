German Finance Minister  Wolfgang Schaeuble  said the independence of the  European Central Bank  is
something to value highly, as he signaled trust in ECB President
 Mario Draghi .  Speaking in Potsdam, outside Berlin, at an award ceremony
for Draghi six hours after the central banker unveiled his bond-
buying proposals, Schaeuble said the ECB’s independence
“demands a high degree of restraint” by politicians in
commenting on its decisions.  Policy makers combating the debt crisis “must not set
wrong incentives,” Schaeuble said in a speech today. “Were we
to want to start solving the problems of financial policy with
the easier means of monetary policy, we would be making a grave
mistake. That is why we have the independence, that is why we
defend it, we respect it, we put our faith in it.”  Stocks, bonds and the euro rose after Draghi said that ECB
policy makers agreed to an unlimited bond-purchase program to
tackle “severe distortions in government bond markets” in the
euro area and fight speculation of a currency breakup.  “If the politicians aren’t fast enough for the markets,
the markets will have to wait,” Schaeuble said. The euro area
won’t break up and “anyone who bets on that will lose their
money.”  Chancellor Angela Merkel , asked in  Madrid  about Draghi’s
announcement, said that the ECB is “acting with independence
and within the framework of its mandate.” Even so, “all other
measures, for example those that serve to stabilize the
currency, cannot replace political action,” Merkel said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
