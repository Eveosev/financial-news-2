Wheat production in  Australia , the
world’s second-biggest shipper, may be less than a government
forecast after dry weather curbed yield prospects just as
drought from the U.S. to Russia threatens crops.  Output may be 23.25 million metric tons in 2012-2013,
according to the median estimate of six analysts and traders in
a Bloomberg survey. That’s 3.5 percent less than the 24.1
million tons predicted by the  Australian Bureau  of Agricultural
and Resource Economics and Sciences, and compares with a record
29.5 million tons a year earlier. The  U.S. Department of
Agriculture  estimates the harvest at 26 million tons.  Wheat has climbed 36 percent this year, reaching a four-
year high in July, as the worst U.S. drought since 1956 and dry
conditions in  Russia  shrink global supplies. The world needs
swift, coordinated action to avoid another food crisis in the
face of rising prices, the heads of three United Nations
agencies said Sept. 4. Surging grains and oilseeds prices drove
the biggest monthly gain in  food costs  in July since 2009,
according to the UN.  “Colder and drier-than-ideal conditions in much of Western
Australia and some parts of the east coast have really eroded
the potential for the wheat crop,” said Graydon Chong, senior
grains and oilseed analyst at Rabobank International. “The next
two-to-four weeks will be crucial from a weather perspective.”  Abares is set to update its production forecast on Sept. 11
followed by the  USDA  on Sept. 12. Australian grain farmers begin
harvesting from about November.  Western Australia  Total grain output in  Western Australia , the nation’s
biggest wheat producer, may be 9 million to 10 million tons in
2012-2013, Max Johnson, grain operations manager at CBH Group,
the state’s biggest handler, said Sept. 5. That compares with a
July forecast of 9 million to 11 million tons and a record 15
million ton harvest a year earlier.  Western Australia’s southwest had the  driest  July on record
and the state’s mean minimum temperature was the coldest since
at least 1950, when comparable records began, according to the
Bureau of Meteorology. The state’s main grain-producing region
is set for wetter-than-normal conditions in September to
November, the  bureau  said Aug. 22.  “We really lost 30 days of growth in July,” Johnson said
by phone from Newdegate, about 400 kilometers (249 miles)
southeast of capital Perth. “Crops are normally ripening in
late August-September, we want those crops to now ripen in late
September-October. If we get another three to four weeks of
cool, damp weather it offsets that miserable July we had.”  Fill Shortfall  Global wheat stockpiles will drop 10 percent before next
year’s harvest to 177.2 million tons, the lowest since 2009, the
USDA said Aug. 10. Wheat for December delivery fell 0.2 percent
to $8.8975 a bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade at 12:57 p.m.
in  Melbourne  today.  “Australian grain production this season will go a long
way to fill the shortfall left by North American crop production
failure as well as parts of the  Black Sea region ,” Rabobank’s
Chong said in a phone interview yesterday.  Russia’s wheat crop may be 40 million tons, Deputy
Agriculture Minister Ilya Shestakov said yesterday. In 2010,
when the country’s worst drought in 50 years spurred a 10-month
ban on grain shipments, Russia produced 41.5 million tons.  In the U.S.,  soybean  production may drop 12 percent to
2.692 billion bushels while  corn  output may slide 13 percent to
10.779 billion bushels, according to the USDA. The U.S. is the
world’s biggest wheat exporter followed by Australia, USDA data
show.  To contact the reporters for this story:
