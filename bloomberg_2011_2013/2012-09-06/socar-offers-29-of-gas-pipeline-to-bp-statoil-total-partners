State Oil Co. of Azerbaijan offered
29 percent of its proposed Trans-Anatolia natural-gas pipeline
to potential partners such as  BP Plc (BP/) ,  Statoil ASA (STL)  and  Total SA. (FP)   “We will keep 51 percent,” Nizamaddin Quliyev, a company
spokesman, said today by phone from the Azeri capital of Baku.  Azerbaijan and Turkey signed an agreement in June to build
the 2,000 kilometer (1,240 mile) pipeline to deliver at least 10
billion cubic meters of Azeri gas a year to the European Union
border through Turkey. It’s estimated to cost $7 billion.  Socar, as the state company is known, now has 80 percent of
the project. Turkey’s Boru Hatlari ile Petrol Tasima AS, or
Botas, and energy company Turkiye Petrolleri AO hold the
remaining 20 percent of the link, known as Tanap.  Tanap will connect either with the EU-backed Nabucco line
or the Trans-Adriatic Pipeline. The BP-led group developing the
Shah Deniz gas field in Azerbaijan’s section of the  Caspian Sea 
will choose between the two links by the middle of next year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
