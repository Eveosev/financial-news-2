Hurricane Leslie, almost stalled on
a track north past  Bermuda , may begin to gain strength tomorrow,
the U.S. National Hurricane Center said.  As of 11 a.m. East Coast time, the Category 1 storm was 430
miles (692 kilometers) south-southeast of the islands with top
winds of 75 miles per hour and moving north at 2 mph. The center
said the sytem had hardly moved since late yesterday. The
centerâ€™s latest tracking map shows Leslie passing east of
Bermuda on Sept. 9.  Hurricane Michael, a Category 3 storm east of Leslie, may
start to weaken tomorrow, the center said. The system poses no
threat to land as yet.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
