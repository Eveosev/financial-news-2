The Greek  finance ministry ’s
economic crimes unit has frozen bank accounts, shares and
properties in 121 tax evasion cases as the country seeks to
raise revenue to meet its budget-cut goals.  “Tolerance of tax evaders, no matter how high up they are,
is over,” Finance Minister Yannis Stournaras said in an e-
mailed statement today. SDOE, as the unit is called, has so far
frozen assets of 121 individuals and companies under probe.
Total unpaid taxes in the country amounted to 42 billion euros,
the finance ministry said a year ago.  Greece’s coalition government, headed by Prime Minister
Antonis Samaras, said in its policy statement after being formed
in June that budget measures for 2013 and 2014 will include
spending cuts and proceeds from improved tax collection rather
than further pension and wage reductions. The 11.5 billion-euro
($14.5 billion) budget cuts are part of pledges made to secure
240 billion euros of bailout funds from the European Union and
the  International Monetary Fund .  Confiscated assets include shares listed on the  Athens  and
 New York  stock exchanges as well as luxury properties, the
ministry said. Tens of millions of euros and foreign currencies
have been found in the seized bank accounts and more accounts
will be probed, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
