U.K. Business Secretary Vince Cable
said so-called quantitative easing is a “rather narrow
mechanism” and central banks including the Bank of  England 
should consider expanding the range of tools they use to boost
the economy.  “The BOE has an absolutely key role in the economic
recovery,” Cable said in an interview with Bloomberg
Television’s Manus Cranny today in Swindon, England. “Central
banks have a key role; they’re going to have to adapt their
approach. Quantitative easing has indeed become a rather narrow
mechanism. We maybe need to look beyond that.”  He added that the Bank of England “has been confident that
we’ve been managing our public finances correctly, and on the
back of that, they’ve been willing to maintain remarkable and
unorthodox monetary policy. That’s partly what has kept the
economy afloat. It could have been much, much, much worse.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
