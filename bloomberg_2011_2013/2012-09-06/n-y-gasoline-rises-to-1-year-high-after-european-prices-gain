New York  gasoline strengthened to
the highest level in more than a year as the fuel in Europe rose
to a four-month record, decreasing the incentive to export fuel
to the U.S.  Gasoline for immediate loading in Amsterdam-Rotterdam-
Antwerp traded at $1,150 a metric ton on the barge market,
according to a survey of traders and brokers monitoring the
Argus bulletin board. That compares with transactions from
$1,124 to $1,138 a ton yesterday and is the most since April 16,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The premium for reformulated, 87-octane gasoline in New
York Harbor rose 4.88 cents to 22.88 cents a gallon versus
futures traded on the  New York Mercantile Exchange  at 1:44 p.m.,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. It is the highest level
since Sept. 2, 2011. Prompt delivery rose 9.92 cents to $3.229 a
gallon.  Gasoline  inventories  on the East Coast increased 379,000
barrels to 49.8 million, according to the Energy Department,
near the 10-year  seasonal low .  The premium for conventional, 87-octane gasoline in the
 Gulf Coast  rose 0.75 cent to 9.5 cents a gallon versus futures.  Phillips 66 (PSX)  plans to shut a crude unit, the only coker and
a sulfur recovery unit at its Sweeny refinery in  Texas  on Jan. 7
for maintenance, according to two people familiar with the work.
The units will be down for 35 days, said the people, who asked
not to be named because the information isn’t public. The
refinery has two crude units.  Petroleos de Venezuela SA will resume normal operations at
its 645,000-barrel-a-day Amuay  oil refinery  in about a week
after an Aug. 25 explosion knocked the country’s largest plant
offline, said Jesus Luongo, head of refining.  To contact the reporter on this story:
