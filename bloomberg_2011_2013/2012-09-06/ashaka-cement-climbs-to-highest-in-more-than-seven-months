Ashaka Cement Plc (ASHAKACE) , a Nigerian unit
of  Lafarge SA (LG) , rose to the highest in more than seven months on
bets expanding sales will improve profit.  The stock rose for a fourth day, gaining 5 percent, the
daily limit, to 11.28 naira at the close in Lagos, the
commercial capital, the highest since Jan. 20. The shares have
fallen 0.6 percent this year, compared with a 17.5 percent gain
in the  Nigerian Stock Exchange All-Share Index (NGSEINDX)  over the same
period.  “Production picked up last year after Lafarge raised its
stake,” Austin Eseha, analyst at Lagos-based Partnership
Investment Co., said today in a telephone interview. “We’ve
also noticed an increase in its cement distribution,” prompting
increased demand for its shares in recent days, he said. Two
calls for comment on a phone number listed phone for the company
weren’t answered.  Ashaka Cement’s annual profit through December rose 19
percent to 3.57 billion naira ($22.6 million) from a year
earlier. Revenue increased to 20.8 billion naira from 19.2
billion Naira.  To contact the reporter on this story:
