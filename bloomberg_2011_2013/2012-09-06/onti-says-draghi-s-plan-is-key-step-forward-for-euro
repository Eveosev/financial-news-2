Italian Prime Minister  Mario Monti 
said European Central Bank President Mario Draghi’s plan to buy
the sovereign bonds of euro-area nations in distress will help
stem the region’s debt crisis.  “I see an important moment, an important step forward,”
Monti said today at a press conference in Rome. The plan leads
“toward a more satisfying governance of the euro zone.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
