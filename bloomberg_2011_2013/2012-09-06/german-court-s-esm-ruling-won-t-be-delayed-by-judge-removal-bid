The top German constitutional
court’s Sept. 12 ruling on the country’s participation in the
European Stability Mechanism won’t be delayed by a motion to
remove a judge for bias.  The request was filed by a plaintiff whose suit isn’t part
of the group of cases to be decided next week, Judith Blohm, a
spokeswoman for the based Federal Constitution Court in
Karlsruhe, said in an interview today. The motion “won’t change
the court agenda,” she said.  The plaintiff argues Judge Peter Huber should be removed
because he used to work for “Mehr Demokratie e.V.,” an
organization that has initiated multiple complaints against
 Germany ’s ESM participation.  The 500 billion-euro ($631 billion) ESM, designed to bail
out indebted euro-area member states beginning this year, will
replace the temporary 440 billion-euro European Financial
Stability Facility, which was set up in May 2010 to fight the
bloc’s debt crisis.  To contact the reporter on this story:
