OAO Rosneft,  Russia ’s biggest crude
producer, is “taking a pause” on its potential interest in
buying  BP Plc (BP/) ’s stake in oil venture TNK-BP while the U.K.
company is in talks with its billionaire partners.  “There are restrictions, the shareholders’ agreement,
which doesn’t allow third parties to stick their noses in,”
Rosneft Chief Executive Officer  Igor Sechin  told reporters today
in Vladivostok in Russia’s Far East.  BP said June 1 that it will pursue a possible sale of its
half of TNK-BP. AAR, which represents the interests of BP’s
billionaire partners in the venture, and Rosneft have said
they’re interested in buying shares. AAR is bidding to buy a 25
percent stake from BP at “market price,” while saying it is
also willing to swap its half of TNK-BP for BP shares. The
billionaires have 135 days from BP’s announcement to negotiate a
deal.  To contact the reporter on this story:
