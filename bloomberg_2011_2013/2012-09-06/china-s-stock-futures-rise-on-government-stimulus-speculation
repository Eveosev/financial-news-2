Chinese  stocks  rose for the first
time in three days on speculation policy makers will take more
steps to stimulate the economy after a government agency
approved subway plans for 18 cities.  China Railway Construction Corp. (601186)  climbed the most in five
months. LandOcean Energy Services Co., which makes drilling
equipment for oil and shale gas, advanced to the highest close
since April after  Shanghai  Securities News said the nation plans
to auction five shale-gas blocks in  Hunan province .  Kweichow
Moutai Co. (600519)  led consumer-related shares lower as Goldman Sachs
Group Inc. cut its forecast for the country’s growth outlook.  “The subway development plan boosts investors’
expectations of more spending by the government,” Xu Shengjun,
an analyst at Jianghai Securities Co. in Shanghai, said by phone
today. “Still, it’s widely expected economic data to be
released soon won’t be great and will drag on stocks.”  The  Shanghai Composite Index (SHCOMP)  increased 0.7 percent to
2,051.92 as of the close. About six stocks rose for every one
that fell in the gauge, which sank yesterday to its lowest level
since February 2009. The  CSI 300 Index (SHSZ300)  added 0.8 percent to
2,217.82. The  Hang Seng China Enterprises Index (HSCEI)  of Chinese
companies traded in  Hong Kong  gained 0.5 percent.  Signs that China’s economic slowdown is deepening have
dragged the Shanghai Composite down 7.8 percent this  quarter .
The gauge, which dropped 1 percent the past two days, trades at
9.4 times estimated profit, near the lowest level since January,
according to weekly  data  compiled by Bloomberg.  “Many investors are buying today because the index has
fallen quite a bit the past few sessions,” Jianghai’s Xu said.  Subway Plan  China Railway Construction, builder of more than half the
nation’s rail links, climbed 4.2 percent to 4.49 yuan, the
biggest advance since April 5.  CSR Corp. (601766) , China’s biggest
trainmaker by market value, jumped 4.4 percent to 4.04  yuan , the
biggest gain since July 11.  Rail stocks led a gauge of industrial companies in the CSI
300 index up by 1.6 percent, the most among 10  industry groups .
The National Development and Reform Commission approved
development plans of subways in 18 cities including Suzhou,
Hangzhou, Guangzhou, Tianjin and Shenzhen, the agency said on
its website yesterday.  The government said yesterday industrial output will expand
by about 10 percent this year, lowering its sights from an 11
percent goal given in December after weaker-than-anticipated
domestic and overseas demand.  Factory Production  A slow recovery abroad and weak investment at home will
keep weighing on factories, the Ministry of Industry and
 Information Technology  said in a statement on its website
yesterday. China’s economic  growth  dipped to a three-year low of
7.6 percent last quarter.  The People’s Bank of China has held off signaling further
easing measures after two interest rate cuts this year.  Goldman Sachs cut its estimate for China’s 2012 gross
domestic product growth to 7.6 percent from 7.9 percent and
reduced its 2013 forecast to 8 percent from 8.5 percent,
economists Li Cui,  Yu Song , MK Tang and Yin Zhang wrote in a
note to clients, citing weaker economic data and softer external
demand.  The three-month outlook for China is weak and stimulus
policies are likely to be late and insufficient, Christopher
Eoyang, Goldman Sachs’ chief growth markets strategist, said at
a media briefing in Singapore today.  Consumer-staple shares dropped the most in the CSI 300
Index today amid concern product demand will decline. Kweichow
Moutai, China’s largest maker of baijiu liquor, retreated 1
percent to 231.75 yuan.  Yonghui Superstores Co. (601933)  lost 2.1 percent
to 23.05 yuan.  No Catalyst  “We’re seeing more data showing growth slowing in China
but we’re also seeing very few signs that the central bank is
interested in aggressive easing,”  Timothy Ghriskey , the chief
investment officer at Solaris Group LLC, which manages about $2
billion in assets, said in a phone interview from  Bedford Hills ,
New York. “If the central bank stays on the sidelines, we don’t
see a short-term catalyst that might send us in a different
direction.”  LandOcean gained 3.2 percent to 23.02 yuan.  China Oil HBP
Science & Technology Co. (002554)  gained 5.3 percent to 11.23 yuan after
the shale-gas auction report.  Bohai Ferry Co. (603167) , an operator of passenger liners, surged
6.9 percent to 11.76 yuan on its first day of trading in
Shanghai. The company offered 101 million shares in its initial
public offering, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The Shanghai Composite’s 30-day  volatility  reading was at
12, compared with this year’s average of 17. About 5.7 billion
shares changed hands in the gauge yesterday, about 26 percent
lower than the daily average this year. The gauge sank 2.7
percent in August, a fourth straight month of declines. That’s
the longest streak since the five months through August 2004,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The  Bloomberg China-US Equity Index (CH55BN)  of the most-traded
Chinese shares in the U.S. sank 1 percent to 86.29 yesterday.
The  iShares FTSE China 25 Index Fund , the biggest Chinese
exchange-traded fund in the U.S., declined for a second day,
losing 0.9 percent to $32.17.  To contact the reporter on this story:
