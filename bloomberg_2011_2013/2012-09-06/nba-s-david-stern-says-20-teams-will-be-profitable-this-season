National Basketball Association
Commissioner  David Stern  said more than 20 of the league’s 30
teams will be profitable this season.  Stern, speaking at the Bloomberg Sports Business Summit
hosted by Bloomberg Link in New York, made the prediction after
saying half the league’s teams lost money prior to the new labor
agreement with the league’s players. He called the figure a
guess.  Stern said some team owners become consumed with the
passion to win and spend so much that it compromises profits.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
