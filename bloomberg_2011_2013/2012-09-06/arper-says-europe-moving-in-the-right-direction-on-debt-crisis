European policymakers are moving in
the right direction for solving the region’s debt crisis,
including today’s announcement of a bond-buying plan by the
European Central Bank, Canadian Prime Minister  Stephen Harper 
said.  Europe is the most immediate concern for the global
economy, Harper, 53, said during an interview in Vancouver with
Bloomberg Television’s  Erik Schatzker . The U.S. must begin to
deal with its fiscal problems after the November elections, and
slowing economies in emerging markets are less of a concern, he
said at the Bloomberg Canada-Asia Conference in Vancouver.  To contact the reporter on this story:
