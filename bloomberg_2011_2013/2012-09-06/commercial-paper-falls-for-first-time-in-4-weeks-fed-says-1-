The market for corporate borrowing
through  commercial paper  contracted for the first time in four
weeks as investors shunned the short-term IOUs of domestic
financial institutions.  The seasonally adjusted amount of U.S. commercial paper
fell $9.9 billion to $1.022 trillion outstanding in the week
ended yesterday, the  Federal Reserve  said today on its website.
It’s the first decline since the market shrank $20.8 billion in
the period ended Aug. 8 and the lowest level since $1.02
trillion outstanding on Aug. 15.  Demand from money-market funds, among the biggest investors
in the market, has declined for short-term obligations from
banks on concern that Europe’s sovereign debt turmoil will taint
balance sheets globally. European Central Bank President  Mario Draghi  said today policy makers agreed to an unlimited bond-
purchase program to regain control of interest rates in the euro
area and fight speculation of a currency breakup.  Commercial paper issued by U.S.-based banks  dropped $6.5
billion to $292.3 billion, the biggest decline since a $14.8
billion fall in the period ended Aug. 8, according to the Fed.
 The amount sold by overseas financial institutions  increased
$3.1 billion to $236.7 billion, the highest level since July
2011.  Corporations sell commercial paper, typically maturing in
270 days or less, to fund everyday activities such as rent and
salaries.  To contact the reporter on this story:
