Romania’s banking system will incur
an overall loss this year as bad-loan costs continue to rise,
 Ziarul Financiar  reported, citing Nicolae Cinteza, who heads the
central bank’s supervision department.  Non-performing loans will probably exceed 20 percent of
total lending, up from 16.8 percent at the end of June,
according to the newspaper.  The central bank is asking lenders to present audited
earnings for the first half of the year, so it can check the way
lenders evaluate capital and make provisions for bad loans, to
avoid “surprises,” ZF said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
