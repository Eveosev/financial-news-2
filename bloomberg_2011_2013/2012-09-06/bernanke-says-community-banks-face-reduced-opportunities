Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said U.S. community banks, while playing a “critical
role in keeping their local economies vibrant,” confront a
shrinking range of profit opportunities.  “They often respond with greater agility to lending
requests than their national competitors because of their
detailed knowledge of the needs of their customers and their
close ties to the communities they serve,” Bernanke said,
according to  comments  released by the Fed today.  A “big concern” for community banks is the “narrowing of
the range of profitable lending opportunities,” Bernanke said.
Larger rivals leverage their size to gain a pricing advantage in
 consumer lending , the Fed chief said in a question-and-answer
transcript posted on the central bank’s Community Banking
Connections website.  Smaller banks had profits that were “considerably higher”
last year than in 2010, while “nonperforming assets were lower,
provisions for loan losses fell appreciably and  capital ratios 
improved,” Bernanke said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
