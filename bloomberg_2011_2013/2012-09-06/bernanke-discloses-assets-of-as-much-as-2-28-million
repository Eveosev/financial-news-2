Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  refinanced his mortgage last year, cutting the rate on
a 30-year home loan to 4.25 percent from 5.375 percent, his
financial disclosure form shows.  Like millions of Americans, Bernanke benefited from a bond
purchase program by the Fed known as quantitative easing, which
helped push down rates on home loans to record lows. The central
bank has bought a total of $2.3 trillion in bonds since 2008 to
reduce borrowing costs and spur economic growth.  About 16.1 million U.S. homeowners have refinanced
mortgages since April 2009, according to U.S. Department of
Housing and Urban Development  data . The value of the Fed
chairman’s home loan ranges from $500,001 to $1 million,
according to his disclosure released today.  The average rate on a 30-year, fixed mortgage fell to a
record 3.49 percent in July, according to  Freddie Mac . It was
3.55 percent this week. The average 30-year, fixed-rate jumbo
mortgage rate was  4.18 percent  yesterday, matching prior record
lows in July and August, Bankrate.com surveys show. Mortgages in
Washington for $625,500 and more are classified as jumbo loans.  Bernanke said his family-owned financial assets are valued
between $1.07 million and $2.28 million. That compares with a
range of $1.06 million to $2.31 million in last year’s
disclosure, and $1.15 million to $2.48 million for 2009. The
forms from the U.S. Office of Government Ethics require
officials to report only a range in the value of holdings.  European Crisis  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index was little changed last
year and has rallied 14 percent  in 2012  as the Fed pledged to
strengthen the  U.S. economy  and European leaders tried to stem
contagion from the region’s debt crisis. The central bank
reduced its key interest rate to almost zero in December 2008
and has since engaged in two rounds of large-scale asset
purchases totaling $2.3 trillion.  Large-scale asset purchases “appear to have boosted stock
prices, presumably both by lowering discount rates and by
improving the economic outlook,” Bernanke said last week at the
Kansas City Fed’s annual symposium in Jackson Hole, Wyoming.  Bernanke, a former Princeton University professor, listed
retirement accounts, TIAA Traditional and CREF Stock Large Cap
Blend, as his two largest assets. Both were valued in a range of
$500,001 to $1 million, the same as the past two years. TIAA-
CREF is a New York-based financial services firm that offers
retirement accounts for academic and government workers.  Royalties from one textbook accounted for $50,001 to
$100,000 in income last year, while a second book brought in
$100,001 to $1 million, according to Bernanke’s form.  Bernanke Salary  Bernanke earns a salary of $199,700, an amount  set  by
Congress. The Fed chief was appointed by President  George W. Bush  to succeed  Alan Greenspan  as chairman in 2006 and was re-
nominated for a second four-year term in 2010 by President
Barack Obama.  Vice Chairman  Janet Yellen  and her husband  George Akerlof ,
a Nobel laureate, held assets of between $3.4 million and $7.4
million, her filing shows. The couple, who said they hold most
of their assets in a trust, listed stocks including  Pfizer Inc. (PFE) ,
 ConocoPhillips (COP) ,  OfficeMax Inc. (OMX)  and  Raytheon Co. (RTN)  They also have a
stamp collection valued from $15,001 to $50,000.  To contact the reporter on this story:
