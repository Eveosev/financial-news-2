A class-action suit against  Goldman
Sachs Group Inc. (GS)  over mortgage-backed securities was revived by
a federal appeals court in  New York .  Investors in 17 securities offerings, led by the NECA-IBEW
Health and Welfare Fund, sued Goldman Sachs over securities
backed by pools of residential mortgages originated by National
City Mortgage Co., Countrywide Home Loans, Washington Mutual
Bank and others, according to an opinion by the court today.  U.S. District Judge Miriam Goldman Cedarbaum dismissed the
suit in 2010, ruling that NECA, which purchased certificates
from only two of the offerings, lacked standing to represent
investors in the other 15. A three-judge panel of the appeals
court reversed that ruling today. The court also reversed
Cedarbaum’s ruling that NECA failed to claim a sufficient loss
from the investments.  “We hold that plaintiff has class standing to assert the
claims of purchasers of certificates backed by mortgages
originated by the same lenders that originated the mortgages
backing plaintiff’s certificates, because such claims implicate
‘the same set of concerns’ as plaintiff’s claims,” U.S. Circuit
Judge Barrington Parker said in the opinion.  Michael DuVally , a spokesman for New York-based Goldman
Sachs, declined to comment immediately on today’s ruling.  The case is NECA-IBEW Health and Welfare Fund v. Goldman
Sachs & Co., 11-2762,  U.S. Court of Appeals  for the Second
Circuit (Manhattan).  To contact the reporters on this story:
