Soybeans fell to a one-week low in
 Chicago  on signs the drought-hit crop in the U.S., the world’s
largest grower last year, may exceed a government forecast.
Wheat rose.  U.S. soybean output may reach 2.739 billion bushels, INTL
FCStone Inc. said yesterday, more than the 2.692 billion
estimated by the  U.S. Department of Agriculture  last month. The
oilseed has jumped 44 percent in 2012. While most of the Midwest
had below-average rain this year, areas of central Illinois,
Indiana and  Missouri  had double the normal amount in the past
week, National Weather Service data show.  “The supply situation perhaps is not directly in line with
the hysteria,” said Mike Darby, a former agricultural
specialist at the USDA who now runs Mike Darby International Pty
Ltd.  Australia , an agriculture consulting company. “Traders
said they’re not having any problems booking soybeans or corn.”  Soybeans for November delivery declined 0.4 percent to
$17.4025 a bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade by 12:50 p.m.
 London  time. Prices touched $17.255, the lowest level since Aug.
29. Futures reached a record $17.89 on Sept. 4 amid concern the
worst U.S. drought in half a century will cut global supply.  The USDA is scheduled to release updated crop forecasts
Sept. 12.  Wheat Harvests  Wheat for December delivery gained 1.1 percent to $8.775 a
bushel after sliding 4.2 percent in the prior four sessions. In
Paris, milling wheat for November delivery rose 0.5 percent to
261.25 euros ($329.96) a metric ton on NYSE Liffe.  The world wheat  harvest  will be about 2 percent lower than
previously estimated this year at 663.3 million tons, the  United
Nations ’ Food & Agriculture Organization said today. Output in
 Russia  may slide to 40 million tons, below the total in 2010,
when the country’s worst drought in 50 years spurred a 10-month
grain-export ban, the FAO said. Harvests may tumble 47 percent
in  Kazakhstan  and 37 percent in Ukraine, a report showed.  “Continued deterioration of cereal crop prospects over the
past two months, due to unfavorable weather conditions in a
number of major producing regions, has led to a sharp cut in
FAO’s world production forecast,” the UN agency said. “Based
on the latest indications, global cereal production would not be
sufficient to cover fully the expected utilization in the
2012-13 marketing season.”  Corn for December delivery gained 0.5 percent to $7.95 a
bushel in Chicago. The most-active contract reached an all-time
high of $8.49 on Aug. 10. World output of the grain may fall 20
million tons from 2011 to 864 million tons (34 billion bushels),
the FAO said. INTL FCStone predicts the U.S. crop will total
10.607 billion bushels, less than the USDA’s estimate of 10.779
billion.  To contact the reporters on this story:
