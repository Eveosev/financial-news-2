The naira snapped four days of
declines against the dollar, gaining the most in more than three
weeks after foreign investors bought Treasury bills.  The currency of  Africa ’s biggest crude producer rose 0.4
percent to 157.85 a dollar as of 2:57 p.m. in Lagos, the
commercial capital, the biggest gain on a closing basis since
Aug. 21. The naira has advanced 2.8 percent this year, the best
performer in Africa according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Treasury bill yields declined to the lowest in more than
three months at an auction yesterday as investors bid for three
times the 142.9 billion naira ($905 million) on offer, the
central bank said today. JPMorgan Chase & Co. said last month
that it is considering adding the West African nation’s debt
into its government bond emerging market index series.  “Flows into the market have increased” supporting the
naira, Adedayo Idowu, a Lagos-based analyst at Vetiva Capital
Management Ltd. said by phone today. “Clearly a lot of those
flows have been coming from off-shore investors.”  The yield on  Nigeria ’s 7 percent domestic bonds due October
2019 dropped nine basis points to 13.87 percent, according to
yesterday’s data on the Financial Markets Dealers Association
website. Yields on the nation’s $500 million of Eurobonds due
January 2021 slid less than one basis point to 4.92 percent
today.  Ghana ’s cedi climbed 0.2 percent to 1.9275 a dollar in
Accra, the capital.  To contact the reporter on this story:
