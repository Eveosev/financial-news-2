A Chinese court sentenced a man to
three-and-a-half years in jail for striking a toddler last year
in his van and driving away, in a case that drew public fury and
led to a national debate about morality.  Hu Jun was one of two drivers who hit the two-year-old
girl, identified as Yueyue, on Oct. 13. Video footage showed 18
people walked or drove past her in a six-minute span without
helping before an elderly garbage collector came to her aid.
Yueyue died after eight days on life support.  The court in the Guangdong provincial city of Foshan said
that after Hu confessed his crime and paid some of the girl’s
medical expenses, it handed down “a lighter punishment
according to law,” China News Service reported today.  The official People’s Daily newspaper published a
commentary on Oct. 18 calling the incident a “disgrace” and a
“shame,” and urged people to stem what it called a decline in
morals. Other Chinese media and Internet users also condemned
the people who ignored the girl as she lay in the road.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
