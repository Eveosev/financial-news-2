President  Vladimir Putin  said the
U.S. will “definitely” direct its missile defense system
against Russia if Republican challenger  Mitt Romney  defeats
President  Barack Obama  in November.  “Our American partners keep telling us, ‘This is not
directed against you,’” Putin said in an interview broadcast on
RT television today. “But what happens if Mr. Romney, who
believes us to be America’s number one foe, is elected as
president of the  United States ? In that case, the missile
defense system will definitely be directed against Russia as it
is technologically configured exactly for this purpose.”  Romney called Russia the “No. 1 geopolitical foe” of the
U.S. during the campaign and last month criticized Obama for
being too accommodating, saying he’d show Putin “less
flexibility and more backbone.”  “Such behavior on the international arena is the same as
using nationalism and segregation as tools of U.S. domestic
policy,” Putin said.  “Its effect on the international arena
is the same, when a politician, a person who aspires to lead a
nation, especially a great country like the U.S., declares
someone to be an enemy a priori.”  Still, Putin said Russia will work with whomever wins the
election, “but our effort will only be as efficient as our
partners will want it to be.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
