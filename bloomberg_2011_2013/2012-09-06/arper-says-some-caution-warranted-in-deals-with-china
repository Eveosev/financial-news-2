Canadian Prime Minister  Stephen
Harper  said some caution is warranted on the part of companies
seeking to do business in China.  Doing business in the country requires a presence on the
ground, Harper, 53, said during an interview in Vancouver with
Bloomberg Televisionâ€™s Erik Schatzker. Canada wants to ensure it
is promoting its economic interest in expanding trade with
China, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
