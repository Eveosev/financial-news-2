Oil rose after the  European Central
Bank  announced a bond-buying plan to ease the region’s debt
crisis and U.S. crude supplies fell to a five-month low.  Futures climbed and equities surged as ECB President  Mario Draghi  said policy makers agreed to an unlimited bond-purchase
program and as data from ADP Employer Services bolstered
optimism in the U.S. labor market. An Energy Department report
showed that  stockpiles  dropped 7.43 million barrels to 357.1
million last week. It was the biggest decrease since December.  “The primary reason for the rise in oil is that equities
are surging on the ECB bond-buying program and the positive ADP
employment numbers,” said  Tim Evans , an energy analyst at Citi
Futures Perspective in New York. “Most of the inventory data
today is supportive as well.”  Crude oil for October delivery advanced 17 cents to settle
at $95.53 a barrel on the  New York Mercantile Exchange . The
contract climbed as much as 2.5 percent to $97.71 earlier.
Futures are down 3.3 percent this year.  Brent oil for October settlement rose 40 cents, or 0.4
percent, to end the session at $113.49 a barrel on the London-
based ICE Futures Europe exchange. The European benchmark grade
traded at a $17.96  premium  to West Texas Intermediate crude in
New York, up from yesterday’s $17.73.  Futures retreated from the day’s highs after failing to
reach $97.84, a technical resistance level from a Fibonacci
study from the year’s high in March, said  John Kilduff , a
partner at Again Capital LLC, a New York-based hedge fund that
focuses on energy. Traders use technical indicators such as the
Fibonacci retracement to predict price movements.  Follow Through  “Prices started weakening after we got to the $97.70 area
and there was no follow through,” Kilduff said. “This is close
to the 61.8 percent Fibonacci retracement level. The same thing
happened last week.”  The ECB’s bond-buying plan is the most ambitious yet in the
central bank’s fight to wrest back control of  interest rates  in
a fragmented economy and save the euro after nearly three years
of turmoil. The central bank reserved the right to terminate
bond purchases if governments don’t fulfill their part of the
bargain, Draghi said.  “The market had been marking time since early August as
people waited for additional information about the ECB plans,”
said Marshall Berol, co-portfolio manager of the Encompass Fund
in  San Francisco , which has about $300 million in assets. “It
appears that people liked what they heard because all of the
markets are moving higher.”  The  Standard & Poor’s 500 (SPX)  increased 2 percent.  Money Supply  Purchases will be fully sterilized, meaning that the
overall impact on the  money supply  will be neutral, and the ECB
will not have seniority, he said.  “If purchases had not been sterilized, it would have been
wildly bullish for commodities because that would increase the
money supply,” said Bill O’Grady, chief market strategist at
Confluence Investment Management in  St. Louis , which oversees
$1.4 billion.  Companies in the U.S. added 201,000 workers in August,
according to figures from Roseland, New Jersey-based ADP.
Jobless claims fell by 12,000 to 365,000 in the week ended Sept.
1, the fewest in a month, the Labor Department reported today in
 Washington .  A Labor Department report tomorrow may show overall hiring,
which includes government jobs, climbed 127,000 last month after
rising 163,000 in July, according to the median estimate of
economists in a Bloomberg survey.  Falling Output  Oil production dropped last week as Hurricane Isaac moved
through the  Gulf of Mexico . About 95 percent of oil output from
the Gulf was halted on Aug. 31, three days after Isaac made
landfall, according to the Bureau of Safety and Environmental
Enforcement. About 43 percent of oil production from the Gulf
remained shut today, a BSEE report showed.  Crude  production  tumbled 12 percent to 5.49 million barrels
a day in the week ended Aug. 31, the lowest level since
September 2011. Output reached 6.36 million barrels a day in the
week ended July 20, the highest level since February 1999.  “It doesn’t appear that there was much in the way of
damage to platforms,” said  Kyle Cooper , director of commodities
research at IAF Advisors in Houston. “Crude production should
be back at multi-year highs within three or four weeks.”  Refineries operated at 86.1 percent of capacity, down 5.1
percentage points from the prior week and the lowest level since
April, the report showed.  Gasoline inventories  fell 2.33 million barrels to 198.9
million last week, the lowest level since November 2008, the
report showed. Production of the fuel increased 93,000 barrels a
day to 9.28 million.  Gasoline Market  “Not all of the numbers in the report make sense,” Evans
said. “It is impossible for gasoline production to be up when
refinery runs were down so much. This suggests that the market
be even tighter than appears in this report.”  Gasoline for September delivery climbed 4.12 cents, or 1.4
percent, to settle at $2.991 a gallon in  New York .  Electronic trading volume on the Nymex was 622,932
contracts as of 3:08 p.m. in New York. Volume totaled 494,973
yesterday, 7.7 percent below the three-month average. Open
interest was 1.54 million, the most since May 16.  To contact the reporter on this story:
