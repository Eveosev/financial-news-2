Light-distillate inventories in
 Singapore ,  Asia ’s largest oil-trading and storage center,
increased the most in 12 weeks, according to a unit of the
Ministry of Trade and Industry.  Onshore stockpiles including naphtha, gasoline and
reformate rose 1.17 million barrels, or 14 percent, to 9.45
million in the seven days to yesterday,  International Enterprise
Singapore  said in an e-mailed statement. That’s the biggest gain
since the week ended June 13.  Middle-distillate inventories including gasoil, or diesel,
and kerosene dropped 622,000 barrels, or 6.5 percent, to 8.98
million, the ministry’s data showed. Supplies fell to the lowest
in five weeks.  Stockpiles of  residual fuels  including  fuel oil  and low-
sulfur waxy residue and excluding bitumen were up 1.13 million
barrels, or 6.5 percent, at 18.4 million, according to the data.
That’s a four-week high.  The trade ministry surveys refiners, traders and storage
terminals on a voluntary basis. The results may exclude offshore
storage capacity, International Enterprise said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
