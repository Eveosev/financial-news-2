Germany ’s state-owned development
bank sold a 5 percent  Deutsche Post AG (DPW)  stake for 924 million
euros ($1.17 billion), taking advantage of the stock’s increase
to a four-year high.  KfW Group sold 60 million shares for 15.40 euros per share,
the Frankfurt-based lender said in an e-mailed statement today.
The price is a 3.6 percent discount to yesterday’s close of
15.98 euros.  KfW reduced its stake in  Europe ’s largest postal operator
to 25.5 percent. The bank is raising money as it plans the
purchase of a 7.5 percent stake in European Aeronautic, Defence
& Space Co. currently owned by  Daimler AG. (DAI)  That  holding  is
currently valued at 1.9 billion euros.  “KfW decided to take advantage of the favorable conditions
in the equity markets in order to continue the successful
privatization process of Deutsche Post,” Guenther Braeunig, a
KfW executive board member, said in the statement.  Deutsche Post, based in Bonn, climbed 2.7 percent yesterday
to its highest since September 2008. The stock  dropped  today as
much as 73 cents, or 4.6 percent, to 15.25 euros and was 3.2
percent lower, valuing the company at 18.7 billion euros, as of
11:47 a.m. in Frankfurt trading.  Deutsche Post raised its full-year forecast last month
after reporting a 2.6 billion-euro second-quarter profit,
exceeding analyst expectations. The company, which is also the
world’s biggest carrier of air and sea freight by volume, has
avoided the effects of the  European debt crisis  by focusing on
expansion of express-package and cargo businesses in  emerging
markets  while seeking to stabilize the mail unit’s earnings.  Profit Forecast  “The timing is pretty good, if you look at the recent run
up in the shares,” said Nigel van Putten, an Amsterdam-based
ING analyst with a “hold” rating on Deutsche Post. “But I
don’t think the 5 percent is going to make much of a difference
to Deutsche Post in terms of the government’s control. The 25.5
percent is still a blocking minority.”  Deutsche Post is seeking to increase profit by as much as
45 percent by 2015 by trimming administrative costs and
expanding the DHL express-service unit. The German postal
operator is targeting annual earnings before interest and taxes
of 3.35 billion euros to 3.55 billion euros. That compares with
Ebit in 2011 of 2.44 billion euros.  United Parcel Service Inc. (UPS) , the world’s biggest package-
delivery company, is seeking to expand in Europe with a 5.16
billion-euro deal to acquire  TNT Express NV (TNTE)  that would vault it
to equal footing with DHL.  DHL, acquired in 2002, is aiming for one-third of its
revenue from  Asia  within five years, and is adding a global
forwarding hub to an express-delivery center in Shanghai and a
supply-chain base in  Hong Kong . The region currently accounts
for 20 percent of DHL sales.  KfW and Daimler aim to complete the EADS transaction by the
end of the year, EADS Chairman Bodo Uebber, who is also
Daimler’s chief financial officer, said in May.  KfW was advised on the Deutsche Post transaction by
Rothschild and the placement’s bookrunner was Bank of America
Merrill Lynch.  To contact the reporter on this story:
