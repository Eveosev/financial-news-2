Spanish bonds rose, pushing 10-year
yields to the lowest level in eight weeks, after European
Central Bank President  Mario Draghi  said policy makers agreed to
an unlimited debt-purchase program to cap borrowing costs.  German  10-year bonds  fell after Draghi said the plan
provided a fully-effective backstop for the euro area,
undermining demand for the safest assets. The Frankfurt-based
central bank left its main  refinancing rate  at a record-low 0.75
percent. Italian 10-year yields fell to the least since April.
Portugal’s notes rose, with two-year yields falling to the
lowest since March 2011.  “Draghi hasn’t disappointed,” said  Richard McGuire , a
senior fixed-income strategist at Rabobank International in
London. “The market had a list of expectations heading in to
the meeting and so positively it seems that Draghi has addressed
all the concerns. Bunds sold off into the meeting and Spanish
bonds are higher.”  Spain ’s 10-year yield fell 39 basis points, or 0.39
percentage point, to 6.02 percent at 4:34 p.m. London time, the
lowest since June 11. The 5.85 percent security maturing in
January 2022 rose 2.655, or 26.55 euros per 1,000-euro ($1,263)
face amount to 98.755. Similar-maturity Italian bonds fell 22
basis points to 5.30 percent.  The plan will “assist the monetary policy transmission
mechanism in all euro area countries,” Draghi told reporters in
 Frankfurt  today. “We will have a fully effective backstop to
avoid destructive scenarios with potentially severe challenges
for  price stability  in the euro area.”  Bunds Fall  For its plan to succeed, the central bank may have to
indicate it is willing to buy the 180 billion euros of Spanish
and Italian notes maturing between one and three years held by
non-domestic investors, said Mohit Kumar head of European fixed-
income strategy at Deutsche Bank AG in  London .  The two countries have 846 billion euros of securities
maturing between 2013 and 2015, about 37 percent of their
outstanding debt, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Germany ’s 10-year bund yield climbed eight basis points to
1.56 percent, after reaching 1.57 percent, the highest level
since Aug. 21. Two-year yields added five basis points to 0.04
percent, after rising to 0.042 percent, the most since July 5.  The euro advanced to a two-month high against the dollar
even as the central bank cut its growth forecast for 2012,
saying euro-area gross domestic product will drop 0.4 percent
this year instead of a 0.1 percent contraction projected three
months ago.  ECB Target  The ECB will target  government bonds  with maturities of one
to three years, including longer-dated debt that has a residual
maturity of that length, Draghi said. Purchases will be fully
sterilized, meaning that the overall impact on the  money supply 
will be neutral, and the ECB will not have seniority, he said.  “For risk sentiment, it was what the market was waiting
for and that’s why we continue to have higher bund yields,”
said  Karsten Linowsky , a fixed-income strategist at Credit
Suisse Group AG in Zurich. “This is giving support to the
countries which would mostly benefit, especially at the short
end, and therefore those spreads are expected to tighten.”  Volatility on Spanish bonds was the highest in euro-region
markets today, followed by Portugal, according to measures of
10-year bonds, the spread between two- and 10-year securities,
and credit default swaps.  Spanish Sale  Spain sold 3.5 billion euros of securities today, the
central bank said. The nation auctioned notes maturing in 2014
at an average yield of 2.798 percent, compared with 4.706
percent when they were sold in June. Investors bid for 2.01
times the amount allotted, down from 3.97 times at the June
sale. It also sold debt maturing in 2015 and 2016.  Portugal ’s two-year notes advanced on speculation that the
ECB may buy the securities as part of its plan. The rate fell 23
basis points to 4.61 percent.  “It will be interesting to see whether the plan will be
immediately applied to Ireland and Portugal,” said Piet Lammens, head of research at KBC Bank NV in Brussels. “For
these countries, Draghi may confirm that they can benefit from
ECB buying and that would be something that the market would
embrace.”  Spanish bonds have returned 2.4 percent this month through
yesterday, cutting their decline this year to 1.6 percent,
according to indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the European
Federation of Financial Analysts Societies. Italian securities
have risen 2 percent in September, while German bonds have lost
0.7 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
