The Institute of Chartered
Accountants in England and  Wales  said it will draft guidance to
auditors in response to the scandal engulfing Libor and other
interbank lending rates.  The guidelines will enable auditors to provide “external
assurance” on whether rate-setting is being done properly, the
ICAEW said in an e-mailed statement.  External assurance can help provide trust by “testing that
there are robust processes in banks for submitting rates to form
the benchmark and that those processes are being followed,” the
ICAEW said.  Confidence in Libor, the benchmark  interest rate  for more
than $500 trillion of securities, plummeted following  Barclays
Plc (BARC) ’s admission that it submitted false rates. The revelations
have provoked renewed calls for tougher oversight of the
financial system and pushed regulatory probes of interbank
lending rates to the top of the political agenda.  To contact the reporter on this story:
