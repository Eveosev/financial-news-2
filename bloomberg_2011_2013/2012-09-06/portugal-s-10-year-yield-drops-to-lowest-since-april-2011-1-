Portugal ’s bonds rose, with 10-year
 yields  falling to the lowest in 17 months, after European
Central Bank President  Mario Draghi  said policy makers agreed to
an unlimited bond-purchase program.  Benchmark yields dropped 44 basis points, or 0.44
percentage point, to 8.67 percent at 4:10 p.m. in London, the
least since April 13, 2011. Portugal requested financial aid
from the European Union on April 6, 2011.  Portugal aims to regain access to bond markets by September
2013 and Prime Minister  Pedro Passos Coelho  has said if the
country can’t do that for “external reasons,” it would be able
to count on continued support from the European Union and the
 International Monetary Fund . The country is cutting spending and
raising taxes to comply with the terms of a 78 billion-euro
($98.5 billion) aid plan.  Bond purchases may be considered for euro-area countries
currently under bailout programs, such as Greece, Portugal and
Ireland, when they regain bond-market access, Draghi said today
at a press conference in  Frankfurt .  Portugal is “sounding out” the market as it prepares to
resume sales of medium-term notes, Joao Moreira Rato, chairman
of the country’s debt agency, said in an interview in July.  The extra yield investors demand to hold Portuguese 10-year
bonds instead of their German equivalents shrank to 711 basis
points, the narrowest since June 2011.  Portugal’s  five-year note  yields declined 72 basis points
to 6.38 percent, the least since February 2011. Two-year rates
fell to as low as 4.58 percent, the least since March 2011.  Portuguese stocks rose, with the  PSI-20 Index (PSI20)  climbing 2.5
percent, led by Banco BPI SA and Banco Espirito Santo SA.  To contact the reporter on this story:
