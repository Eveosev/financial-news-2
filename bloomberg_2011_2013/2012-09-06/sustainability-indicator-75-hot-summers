Today's sustainability indicator,  18,777 gigawatt hours , is the average monthly electricity generated from non-hydro renewable energy in the U.S. That supplies about  5.8 percent  of the country's electricity needs, compared with  3.1 percent  in 2008. This month's indicators: 213 : current measure of the UN's World Food Price Index. 210 : the price threshold associated with a sharp rise in social unrest and food riots. 50 percent : world transport fuels replaceable by converting 17.5% of farm waste to biofuel. 1.32 million square miles : Arctic sea ice this month, the least in 33 years of satellite records. 18 percent : decrease from the previous record-low Arctic ice, which was recorded in 2007. 330 : consecutive months that global temperatures have been above the 20th century average. 626 million : people in India who still defecate in the open, contributing to superbugs. 251 million : people who gained improved sanitation in the country from 1990 to 2010. 67% : return from a portfolio based on the Carbon Disclosure Leadership Index since 2006. 31% : return of the Leadership Index's Global 500 peers during the same period. 1,079 : jobs created by the average U.S. wind farm. 75,000 : total workers currently employed by U.S. wind power industry. 78% : polled investors who recognize that climate change is a threat to the environment. 
" Not much ": anticipated impact on profits from reducing pollution, said half of respondents. 75% : world's surface that experienced unusually hot summers each year over the last decade. 33% : world's surface with hot summers in the baseline years from 1951 to 1980. 81% :U.S. energy demands met from domestic sources last year. 2 : decades elapsed since the U.S. was similarly energy self-sufficient. 59% : proportion of emissions-reductions efforts that pay for themselves in 3 years. $10 billion : annual savings on U.S. electric bills from new lightbulb standards. 30 : large power plants it takes to produce electricity equivalent to the lightbulb savings. 63% : surge in new solar capacity added in Europe last year. 57% : potential decline in new solar capacity in 2012 amid economic uncertainty. $71 billion : investment by oil industry to develop low-emission biofuels in the last decade. $43 billion : investment by U.S. government over the same duration. 170 degrees Fahrenheit : reading on traditional black rooftops on NYC's hottest day last year. 42 degrees : temperature reduction reached by energy-efficient white roofs. 2 million : premature deaths each year from cooking with primitive stoves or open fires #2 : rank of indoor pollution from stoves among environment health risks, after unsafe water. $1.4 trillion : spending by people over age 60 in Japan last year as the population ages. 23.3% : record proportion of Japanese population over age 65. 1.7 billion metric tons : CO2 pollution saved by the 20-year-old Energy Star program. 2 years : time it takes to generate that much pollution from electricity to all U.S. homes. 1/3 : proportion of world's antibiotics consumed in India, where new superbugs were found. 35.3 gigawatts : North Sea offshore wind capacity projected by 2020. 3.2% : EU electricity demand supplied by 35.3 gigawatts. 2.5 billion : people worldwide who don't have bank accounts, which can reduce poverty 16% : banking done by mobile phones in Sub-Sahara Africa, where bank access is limited.
