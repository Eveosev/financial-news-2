Hong Kong  will restrict buyers of
apartments built on two sites it plans to sell next year to
local residents, as the government attempts to cool housing
prices that have surged to the world’s most expensive.  The two sites in eastern Kowloon have a combined area of
1.6 hectares (4 acres), Chief Executive Leung Chun-ying told
reporters at a briefing broadcast by the city’s Cable TV today.
Details of the measure come a week after it was flagged as part
of a 10-point package the chief executive announced on Aug. 30
that also included the speeding up of the approval of permits
for private project sales.  The policies are the toughest since the government in June
last year increased down-payment requirements, and the strongest
move yet to quell concerns about a surge in non-local purchases,
particularly by mainland China investors who account for a third
of new home buying in the city and helped drive prices up 85
percent since the beginning of 2009.  “Land for housing in Hong Kong is a rare resource,” Leung
said today. “When we decide on how to use it we need to make
sure we are satisfying the need of Hong Kong people first.”  The seven-member  Hang Seng Property Index (HSP) , which tracks
developers, including  Sun Hung Kai Properties Ltd. (16)  and  Cheung
Kong  (Holdings) Ltd., has risen 14 percent this year, compared
with the 4.2 percent increase in the benchmark  Hang Seng Index .  The property index has risen 0.5 percent since Leung
unveiled the new efforts to curb prices on Aug. 30. It fell 0.3
percent at the close of trading today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
