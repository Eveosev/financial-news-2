British teenager Jonnie Peacock
cemented his status as the world’s fastest amputee runner by
winning the men’s T44 100-meter title at the  London Paralympics .  World record holder Peacock, 19, won last night’s final at
the Olympic Stadium in a Paralympics-best time of 10.90 seconds.
Richard Browne of the U.S. finished second ahead of Arnu Fourie
and defending champion Oscar Pistorius of  South Africa .  “To go in front of 80,000, it was crazy,” Peacock, who
had his right leg amputated at age five, told the British
Broadcasting Corp. “To hear the crowd chant my name was amazing.
That’s going to live with me forever.”  Pistorius, 25, also failed to defend his 200-meter title
from four years ago following his surprise loss to  Brazil ’s Alan
Fonteles Cardoso Oliveira on Sept. 2. Pistorius, known as the
“ Blade Runner ,” last month became the first amputee runner to
compete at an  Olympic Games .  Peacock’s gold medal was one of five won yesterday by the
host nation, which rose to second in the  medals standings . With
three days of competition remaining,  China  leads with 70 golds
and 183 in total. Britain and Russia each have 31 golds, though
the host has won 23 more total medals.  Wheelchair racer David Weir added the 800-meter T54 to his
1,500-meter and 5,000-meter titles as he seeks to win four golds
in London, while fellow Briton Sarah Storey won the women’s
cycling C4-5 road race for her fourth gold at the games and a
record-tying 11th of her career.  Switched Sports  Storey is tied with wheelchair racer Tanni Grey-Thompson as 
Britain’s most successful female Paralympian. She won her first 
gold as a 14-year-old swimmer in 1992 and went on to win five in 
that sport before switching to cycling.  “To be even on the same page as Tanni, I don’t know if it
will ever sink in,” Storey, 34, told Channel 4.  In the pool, South Africa’s Natalie Du Toit won the women’s
200-meter individual medley SM 9 for her third gold medal in
London,  Australia ’s Jacqueline Freney set a world record to win
the women’s 400-meter freestyle S7 with a time of 4 minutes,
59.02 seconds, and Britain’s Josef Craig broke the world mark to
take the men’s race in a time of 4:42.81.  Mohamed Berrahal of  Algeria  set a world record in winning
gold in the men’s F51-53 discus with a throw of 12.37 meters (41
feet).  France  beat Spain 2-0 to advance to the five-a-side soccer
gold-medal game against Brazil, which defeated Argentina 1-0 in
a penalty shootout after the teams finished goalless. Australia
and  Germany  advanced to the women’s wheelchair basketball final.  The games run through Sept. 9, with more than 4,000
athletes from 164 teams competing in a series of classes
depending on their impairment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
