BP Plc sold a  North Sea  Brent crude
cargo, the first trade in 19 months. Total SA bid for Forties at
a higher price than yesterday. OAO Lukoil failed to sell Russian
Urals blend in the Mediterranean at a lower price.  Daily exports of Brent, Forties, Oseberg and Ekofisk
crudes, which make up the Dated Brent benchmark, will increase
18 percent in October from this month, loading programs obtained
by Bloomberg News show.  North Sea  BP sold the Brent lot for Sept. 20 to Sept. 22 loading to
Royal Dutch Shell Plc at 25 cents a barrel less than Dated
Brent, the first transaction since Jan. 27, 2011, according to a
Bloomberg survey of traders and brokers monitoring the Platts
trading window. BP has sold a total of eight cargoes of Brent,
Forties and Ekofisk for shipment in September.  BP failed to sell a consignment of Oseberg for Sept. 29 to
Oct. 1 at 55 cents a barrel more than Dated Brent, 15 cents less
than its offer yesterday, the survey showed.  Total didn’t manage to buy any cargoes of Brent, Forties,
Oseberg or Ekofisk for Sept. 22 to Oct. 2 at parity to Dated
Brent, the survey showed. The company was bidding for Forties at
a 5 cent discount yesterday.  Reported crude trading typically occurs during the Platts
window, which ends at 4:30 p.m.  London  time. Before the session,
Forties loading in 10 to 25 days was 42 cents a barrel less than
Dated Brent, the lowest since June 27, compared with a discount
of 26 cents yesterday, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Brent for October settlement traded at $114.77 a barrel on
the ICE Futures Europe exchange in London at the close of the
window, up from $113.68 yesterday. The November contract was
$114.36, a discount of 41 cents to October.  Exports of Brent, Forties, Oseberg and Ekofisk will average
870,968 barrels a day versus 740,000 barrels a day in September,
according to the plans.  Forties loadings will rise to 309,677 barrels a day, up
from 200,000 barrels a day this month, the lowest level in at
least five years, a schedule showed.  Exports of Troll will increase to 14 cargoes of 600,000
barrels each in October, compared with five lots this month,
while loadings of Alvheim will be unchanged at five 780,000
barrel shipments, according to programs.  Maersk Oil, a unit of Moeller-Maersk A/S, halted some of
its oil and natural gas output following unplanned repairs.  “Due to unplanned maintenance work, Maersk Oil had to shut
down some of its oil and gas production in the Danish North Sea,
leading to a cut of 100,000 barrels a day of oil production and
300 million standard cubic feet a day of gas production for six
days,” the company said today in a statement.  Crude exports from Dansk Undergrunds Consortium, the
producer part-owned by Maersk, will be reduced to four cargoes
of 600,000 barrels each in October, one less than September, the
plan showed.  Mediterranean/Urals  Lukoil didn’t manage to sell 80,000 metric tons of Urals
for loading on Sept. 18 to Sept. 22 at 65 cents a barrel less
than Dated Brent, 10 cents less than its offer yesterday,
according to the survey.  Urals advanced 10 cents to a discount of 66 cents a barrel
to Dated Brent for delivery in the Mediterranean, data compiled
by Bloomberg showed.  Rosneft Trading SA failed to buy 600,000 barrels of Azeri
Light for Sept. 30 to Oct. 4 at $2.60 a barrel more than Dated
Brent, the survey showed.  Saudi Arabian Oil Co. reduced its October official selling
price for Arab Light crude from the Egyptian port of Sidi Kerir,
two people with knowledge of the matter said.  Saudi Aramco , as the state-run producer is known, cut the
differential of Arab Light by $1.05 to a discount of 45 cents a
barrel to the Brent weighted average, or BWAVE, posted by the
 Intercontinental Exchange , said the people, who declined to be
identified because the information is confidential.  West Africa  Nigerian benchmark Qua Iboe rose 2 cents to $1.66 a barrel
more than Dated Brent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Petrolin Trading Ltd., which has a stake in the Rabi Light
oil field in Gabon, sold 650,000 barrels of the grade for
loading on Oct. 17 to Oct. 18 to Exxon Mobil Corp., said two
traders who declined to be identified because the information is
confidential.  To contact the reporter on this story:
