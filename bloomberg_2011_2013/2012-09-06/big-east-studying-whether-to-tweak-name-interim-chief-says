The Big East Conference, which has
added schools in Idaho and California over the past year, is
conducting a brand study that may result in a name change, said
interim Commissioner Joseph A. Bailey II.  The conference’s Big East brand is valuable, but also must
accurately reflect the makeup of the college sports league,
Bailey said at the Bloomberg Sports Business Summit hosted by
 Bloomberg Link  in  New York .  “It can’t look less than authentic in what it represents
to the rest of the country,” Bailey said. A “tweak” to the
name is more likely than a change, he added.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
