Canadian Prime Minister  Stephen
Harper  said the Quebec election earlier this week didn’t give a
mandate for separation to the incoming Parti Quebecois.  The people of Quebec don’t want to separate from the rest
of Canada, Harper said during an interview in Vancouver with
Bloomberg Television’s Erik Schatzker. The Parti Quebecois led
by Pauline Marois won a minority of seats in the Quebec
legislature in a Sept. 4 election.  To contact the reporter on this story:
