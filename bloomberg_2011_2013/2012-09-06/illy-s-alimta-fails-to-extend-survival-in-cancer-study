Eli Lilly & Co. (LLY)  said its cancer drug
Alimta didn’t extend overall survival when combined with  Roche
Holding AG (ROG) ’s Avastin in patients with a form of lung tumor.  The combination, which was in the final stage of testing
required to get U.S. approval, did delay the progression of
tumors, Indianapolis-based Lilly said today in a statement. The
company will present the full results tomorrow at a medical
meeting in  Chicago .  The study was intended to look at whether adding Alimta to
Avastin provided an additional benefit for patients with
nonsquamous non-small cell lung cancer. Lilly is trying to
expand use of Alimta, which had $2.5 billion in sales last year.  Alimta is the second late-stage testing setback for Lilly
in as many weeks. The drugmaker halted testing on Aug. 29 of a
schizophrenia treatment after determining it was unlikely to
provide a benefit. The company needs to get new products to the
market and expand sales of existing products to offset the
potential loss of $7 billion in revenue to generic competition
over the next five years.  Lilly rose 2.2 percent to $46.81 at the close of  New York 
trading.  In the study, called Pointbreak, patients were given either
Alimta combined with Avastin and the generic drug carboplatin or
a combination of Avastin with the generic paclitaxel. The Alimta
patients were then given Alimta plus Avastin as a follow-up
therapy while the other group of patients received just Avastin.  To contact the reporter on this story:
