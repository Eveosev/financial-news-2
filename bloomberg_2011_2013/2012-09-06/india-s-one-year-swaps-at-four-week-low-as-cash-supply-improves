India ’s one-year  interest-rate swaps 
fell to the lowest level in almost four weeks on speculation
cash supply in the banking system is improving as lending slows.  Lenders’ overnight  borrowings  from the central bank to meet
cash shortages, a gauge of interbank funding availability,
dropped to 21.2 billion rupees ($380 million) today from 338.7
billion rupees on Aug. 30, official figures show. Loan growth
averaged 17.3 percent so far in 2012, compared with 21.6 percent
a year earlier.  Asia ’s third-largest  economy  grew 5.5 percent
last quarter, following a 5.3 percent expansion in the previous
three months that was the slowest since 2009.  “The drastic increase in liquidity has pushed down swap
rates,” said Debendra Kumar Dash, a fixed-income trader at
 Development Credit Bank Ltd. (DEVB)  in Mumbai. “Banks are awash with
cash as a slower economy has affected credit growth.”  The fixed payment to lock in one-year borrowing costs fell
one basis point to 7.75 percent in Mumbai, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. That is the lowest level since Aug. 10.  The yield on the 8.15 percent notes due June 2022 dropped
two basis points, or 0.02 percentage point, to 8.16 percent in
Mumbai, according to the central bank’s trading system. That was
the lowest level since Aug. 9.  To contact the reporter on this story:
