Indian stocks advanced, tracking
Asian and European peers, as investors waited for European
Central Bank President  Mario Draghi  to give details of his plan
to stem the region’s debt crisis.  The BSE India  Sensitive Index (SENSEX) , or Sensex, gained 0.5
percent to 17,399.88 at 2:22 p.m. in Mumbai.  Infosys Ltd. (INFO) , the

the MSCI Asia Pacific Index rose for the first time in six days.  The Sensex has risen 13 percent this year, helped by the
