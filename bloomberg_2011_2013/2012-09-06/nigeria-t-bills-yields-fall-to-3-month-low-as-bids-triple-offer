Nigerian Treasury bill yields
declined to the lowest in more than three months at an auction
yesterday as investors bid for three times the 142.9 billion
naira ($905 million) on offer.  The  Central Bank of Nigeria  sold 32.97 billion naira of 91-
day bills at a yield of 13.64 percent, the Abuja-based central
bank said today in an e-mailed statement, the lowest since the
May 25 sale. The bank sold 20 billion naira of 182-day debt at
13.80 percent and 90 billion naira of 364-day securities at
13.87 percent, the lowest since May 10. Bids totalled 430.8
billion naira, the highest since July 25.  “There was meaningful international demand at the
auction,”  Samir Gadio , an emerging-markets strategist at
Standard Bank Group Ltd. in  London , said today in an e-mailed
response to questions. The results, which were higher than the
market expected, “also mean the CBN is keen to keep short-term
rates high and liquidity conditions under relative control as a
further qualitative drop in T-bill yields would eventually
jeopardise exchange rate stability,” he said.  The naira, which strengthened 0.4 percent at 158 a dollar
in Lagos, has risen 2.8 percent this year, making it the best
performing currency in  Africa  after the Zambian kwacha.  The central bank held its  benchmark interest rate  at a
record 12 percent on July 24 to contain inflation and support
the naira. The  inflation rate  declined to 12.8 percent in July
from 12.9 percent a month earlier, the Abuja-based National
Bureau of Statistics said Aug. 17.  Nigeria  also sold 14.9 billion naira of 91-day securities
at a yield of 13.6 percent, 13.5 billion naira of 182-day debt
at 13.8 percent and 64.2 million naira of 182-day bills at 13.8
percent yield to non-competitive bidders, according to the
central bank.  To contact the reporter on this story:
