Serbia may ban exports of sugar
beet, sunflower seed and soy bean to prevent possible shortages
after a weak harvest, state-run broadcaster Radio Televizija
Srbije  reported , citing the trade minister.  The government will intervene if higher commodity prices
abroad threaten excessive exports and shortages at home of
cooking oil, sugar or other products, the report quoted Rasim Ljajic as saying.  The state is also buying wheat and corn for its own
reserves, currently at 209,000 tons and 79,000 tons
respectively, to be used “if need be” before next year’s
harvest, Ljajic is reported as saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
