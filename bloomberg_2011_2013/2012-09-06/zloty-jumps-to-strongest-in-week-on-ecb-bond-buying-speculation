The zloty rallied the most in a
month after the  European Central Bank  announced an unlimited
bond-purchase plan to help control borrowing costs in the euro
area’s most-indebted nations, boosting risk appetite.  The zloty jumped 1.4 percent to 4.1240 per euro as of 5:46
p.m. in Warsaw, the steepest gain since Aug. 3 and the biggest
advance among more than 170 currencies tracked by Bloomberg. The
yield on 10-year notes fell one basis point, or 0.01 percentage
point, to 4.82 percent.  ECB President  Mario Draghi  said the bank will target
government bonds with maturities of one to three years,
including longer-dated debt that has a residual maturity of that
length. Purchases will be fully sterilized, meaning the overall
impact on the money supply will be neutral, and the ECB will not
have seniority, he said. The euro area is Poland’s biggest
trading partner.  “The ECB has delivered a mildly positive signal for risky
assets, which should benefit  emerging markets  high-beta
currencies,”  Benoit Anne , head of emerging markets strategy at
Societe Generale SA in London, wrote in an e-mailed note to
clients.  To contact the reporter on this story:
