OAO Gazprom, the world’s biggest
natural-gas producer, said first-quarter profit slumped 24
percent on lower export sales and refunds to European customers.  Net income fell to 357.8 billion rubles ($11 billion) from
468 billion rubles a year earlier, the Moscow-based company said
today in an e-mailed statement. That missed the 373 billion-
ruble average estimate of 12 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.
Revenue slid 7 percent to 1.22 trillion rubles. The state-
controlled gas export monopoly took a charge of 78.5 billion
rubles for retroactive gas-price adjustments.  Customers in  Europe , Gazprom’s biggest market by revenue,
have sought changes to their purchasing deals with Gazprom after
the 2008 recession cut demand, dragging spot prices below long-
term contract levels. Gazprom ties its contracts to prices for
crude and refined-oil products with a time lag of as much as
nine months.  “The retroactive payments are expected to continue into
future statements,” Alexander Burgansky, an oil and gas analyst
at Otkritie Capital, said by e-mail.  Sales to Europe fell 3 percent and 30 percent to former
Soviet republics as volumes dropped, according to the statement.  Gazprom shares were little changed at 155.32 rubles on
Moscow’s Micex exchange as of 11:30 a.m.  To contact the reporter on this story:
