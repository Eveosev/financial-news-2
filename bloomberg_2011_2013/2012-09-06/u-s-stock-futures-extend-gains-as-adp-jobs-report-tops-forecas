U.S. stock futures and European
shares pared gains and the euro turned lower versus the dollar
as the  European Central Bank  cut its economic forecast for the
region and detailed plans to buy bonds.  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index expiring this
month climbed 0.4 percent at 8:37 a.m. in  New York  after rising
as much as 0.7 percent. The Stoxx Europe 600 Index climbed 0.7
percent, trimming a gain of 1.1 percent. The euro was little
changed at $1.2600 after strengthening 0.4 percent earlier.  Futures extended gains earlier after a private report
showed employers added more jobs than forecast last month,
bolstering optimism in the economy before tomorrow’s government
labor report. First-time unemployment claims were below
forecast.  Companies in the U.S. added 201,000 workers in August,
according to figures from Roseland, New Jersey-based ADP
Employer Services. The median estimate in a Bloomberg survey
called for an advance of 140,000. Estimates of the 41 economists
ranged from increases of 90,000 to 170,000.  The  S&P 500  in August climbed to its highest level on an
intraday basis in more than four years, then failed to close at
that milestone. The index has risen 12 percent this year and
fluctuated near the 1,400 level for three weeks as European
leaders worked to tame the region’s debt crisis and Federal
Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said in  Jackson Hole ,  Wyoming ,
last week he wouldn’t rule out more stimulus.  Daily moves in the benchmark gauge narrowed to 0.4 percent
last month from 2.2 percent a year ago, when economic and policy
changes battered investors.  Most U.S. stocks fell yesterday, sending the S&P 500 lower
for a second day, following a lowered earnings forecast at FedEx
Corp. and disappointing global economic data.  To contact the reporter on this story:
