Growing genetically-modified crops
such as varieties of  Monsanto Co. (MON) ’s MON 810 corn can’t be
subject to national authorization procedures by European Union
countries when the bloc has approved their use and marketing,
the  European Court  of Justice wrote in a ruling today.  The lack of national rules to ensure so-called co-existence
between modified, organic and conventional crops doesn’t entitle
an EU member state to prohibit cultivation of biotech crops in a
general manner, the court wrote.  The court ruled in a dispute between Pioneer Hi Bred Italia
Srl and Italy’s agriculture ministry. The ministry had said it
couldn’t consider a Pioneer application to grow genetically
modified corn hybrids derived from MON 810 already included in
the EU common catalogue of agricultural plant species, according
to the ruling.  Italy is the EU’s second-largest corn grower.  France , the
bloc’s largest producer of the grain, in March temporarily
banned growing of Monsanto’s insect-resistant MON 810 corn,
citing scientific studies it said showed growing the corn
variety poses risks to the environment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
