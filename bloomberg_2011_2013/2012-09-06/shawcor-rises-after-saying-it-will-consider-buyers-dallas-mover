Shawcor Ltd. (SCL/A) , which provides
coatings and other services to the pipeline industry, rose the
most in its history after announcing yesterday it is considering
selling itself with the support of its controlling shareholder.  The shares gained 20 percent to C$42.20 at the close in
Toronto after earlier climbing to C$44.50, the biggest intraday
increase since they began trading in November 1988.  Chairman Virginia Shaw told the board she is prepared to
sell her shares as part of a sale of the company, the Toronto-
based company said in a statement yesterday. Shaw is the
controlling shareholder through a holding company, Shawcor said.  The board has formed a committee to consider a sale and
other alternatives, according to the statement. No buyers have
been identified. Shawcor has hired Credit Suisse Group AG as a
financial adviser.  To contact the reporter on this story:
