The pace of expansion in U.S.  service  industries probably eased in August, showing the biggest part of the economy is having trouble gaining traction, economists said before a report today.  The  Institute for Supply Management ’s non-manufacturing index, which covers about 90 percent of the economy, is projected at 52.5 last month following July’s 52.6, according to the  median  forecast of 76 economists in a Bloomberg survey. A reading greater than 50 signals expansion. Another report may show companies took on the fewest workers in three months in August.  Limited momentum in  service industries  and three straight months of contraction in manufacturing explain why the expansion is struggling to accelerate and create more employment opportunities.  FedEx Corp. (FDX)  is among service providers seeing waning demand as rising gas prices, cooling global economies and diminished business investment hold back U.S. growth.  “The U.S. services industry is in kind of a ho-hum state at the moment with not a lot of inspiration for future growth in sales,” said Guy LeBas, fixed-income strategist at Janney Montgomery Scott LLC in Philadelphia.  The Tempe, Arizona-based ISM’s index, which covers industries ranging from utilities and retailing to health care, housing and finance, is due at 10 a.m. Bloomberg survey estimates ranged from 51 to 53.5.  The group’s manufacturing index, released Sept. 4, showed the industry  contracted  for a third month in August, the longest such stretch since the recession ended in 2009.  Retail Sales  Stronger retail sales, along with a pickup in the housing market, have helped sustain growth in the services industry. In July, retail purchases advanced 0.8 percent, the most since February, Commerce Department data show. Auto demand has also fared well, with  sales of cars  and light trucks rising to an annual rate of 14.5 million in August, the best in three years.  Lower borrowing costs and cheaper properties have spurred residential construction. Housing starts ran at a 746,000 annual rate in July, close to June’s 754,000 pace that was the strongest in more than three years, according to the Commerce Department.  At the same time, the services industry may be held back by a struggling labor market. The jobless rate has exceeded 8 percent for more than three years.  August Employment  Figures at 8:15 a.m. today from the ADP Employer Services may show private employers hired 140,000 workers in August after 163,000 the prior month, according to economists’ median estimate.  Higher gasoline prices could also keep  consumer spending  in check. The average price of a gallon of regular gas has risen 50 cents since July 1, reaching $3.83 at the end of August, according to AAA, the nation’s largest auto club.  FedEx is among U.S. companies saying slowing economic growth is hurting demand. The operator of the world’s biggest cargo airline this week projected its first earnings decline since 2009 for the three-month period that ended Aug. 31.  “Weakness in the global economy constrained revenue growth at FedEx Express more than expected in the earlier guidance,” the company said in a Sept. 4 statement. Express packages provide most of FedEx’s sales, and the Memphis-based shipper is considered an economic bellwether because it moves goods ranging from financial documents to pharmaceuticals.
