The following is a reformatted
version of  European Central Bank  President  Mario Draghi ’s
statement on “Measures to preserve collateral availability”
at a press conference in  Frankfurt  today.  Measures to preserve collateral availability  On 6 September 2012 the Governing Council of the European
Central Bank (ECB) decided on additional measures to preserve
collateral availability for counterparties in order to maintain
their access to the Eurosystem’s liquidity-providing operations.  Change in eligibility for central government assets:
The Governing Council of the ECB has decided to suspend the
application of the minimum credit rating threshold in the
collateral eligibility requirements for the purposes of the
Eurosystem’s credit operations in the case of marketable debt
instruments issued or guaranteed by the central government, and
credit claims granted to or guaranteed by the central
government, of countries that are eligible for Outright Monetary
Transactions or are under an EU-IMF programme and comply with
the attached conditionality as assessed by the Governing
Council.  The suspension applies to all outstanding and new assets of the
type described above.  The decision on the collateral eligibility of bonds issued or
guaranteed by the Greek government taken by the Governing
Council on 18 July 2012 is still applicable (Decision
ECB/2012/14).  Expansion of the list of assets eligible to be used as
collateral:
The Governing Council of the ECB has also decided that
marketable debt instruments denominated in currencies other than
the euro, namely the US dollar, the pound sterling and the
Japanese yen, and issued and held in the euro area, are eligible
to be used as collateral in Eurosystem credit operations until
further notice. This measure reintroduces a similar decision
that was applicable between October 2008 and December 2010, with
appropriate valuation markdowns.  These measures will come into force with the relevant legal
acts.  #<505319.2583362.3.1.0.0.25>#
