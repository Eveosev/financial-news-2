Prime Minister  David Cameron ,
releasing details of a relaxation of U.K. planning rules to spur
house-building, said the plans would deliver up to 70,000 new
homes and 140,000 jobs in a boost to the  construction industry .  The plans include a government guarantee worth 40 billion
pounds ($63.6 billion) for major infrastructure projects, the
government said in a statement today. They also include removing
restrictions on house builders to help unlock 75,000 homes
currently stalled due to sites being commercially unviable.  “The measures announced today show this government is
serious about rolling its sleeves up and doing all it can to
kick-start the economy,” Cameron said.  “Some of the proposals are controversial; others have been
a long time in coming,” he said. “But along with our housing
strategy, they provide a comprehensive plan to unleash one of
the biggest homebuilding programmes this country has seen in a
generation. That means more investment around the county; more
jobs for our people; and more young families able to realize
their dreams and get on the housing ladder.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
