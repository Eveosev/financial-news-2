Dutch sugar-beet is suffering from
leaf yellowing, generally a sign something is wrong with the
crop, industry researcher IRS said.  Beet plots across the country show yellowing, which could
be caused by excess water in soils as well as a fungal disease
called stemphylium leaf spot, Bergen op Zoom, Netherlands-based
IRS said today in a  report  on its website.  The Netherlands is the European Union’s fifth-largest
sugar-beet grower after  France ,  Germany , the U.K. and  Poland ,
data from the bloc show. The country had a wet summer, with
rainfall in the June to August period on average 27 percent
higher than normal, Dutch weather office data show.  “Problems with soil structure are often and dramatically
visible this year,” IRS wrote. “Often this results in water
nuisance in places. This leads to a lack of oxygen that causes
the yellowing.”  Stemphylium leaf spot is being found in all regions, with
many notifications of the fungal disease, the IRS wrote. The
disease was first found in the Netherlands in 2007 in the
northeastern growing regions, and has since been found across
the country, according to the researcher.  The fungal disease that first shows up as yellow spots on
the plant can kill sugar beet leafs, and fungicides approved in
the Netherlands for use on beets have either no or limited
efficacy against stemphylium, according to the IRS.  To contact the reporter on this story:
