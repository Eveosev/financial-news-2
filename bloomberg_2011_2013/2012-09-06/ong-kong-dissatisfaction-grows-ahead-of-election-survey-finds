Dissatisfaction with the way  Hong
Kong ’s government deals with  China  rose to the highest level in
eight years ahead of an election on Sept. 9 for the city’s
legislature, according to a survey by the  Hong Kong Transition
Project .  The level of dissatisfaction climbed to 48 percent,
according to the survey of 1,309 people conducted last month.
That’s the highest level since the 51 percent in July 2004, when
Hong Kong was recovering from the severe acute respiratory
syndrome epidemic, according to the survey.  The introduction by Chief Executive Leung Chun-ying’s
administration of patriotism classes about China has drawn
nightly protests at the government headquarters in Hong Kong,
while a planned relaxation of visa procedures for mainland
visitors has been criticized by a range of people including
 James Tien , head of the tourism board, on concerns that the city
may not have the capacity to handle the influx.  “I don’t think there is any question about the loser --
that’s going to be C.Y. Leung,”  Michael DeGolyer , director of
the Hong Kong Transition Project, said at a luncheon today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
