Mohammad Al-Mojil Group will call an
extraordinary shareholders meeting to discuss its future after a
loss,  Al-Eqtesadiyah  reported, citing a company statement posted
yesterday on the Saudi exchange website.  Al-Mojil, which provides services to the  construction
industry , may announce in two weeks a second-quarter loss of 800
million Saudi riyals ($213 million), the newspaper said.  The company took provisions of 269 million riyals against
several projects and made losses of 443 million on al-Munaifah
refinery and King Abdullah Petroleum Studies and Research
Center, Eqtesadiyah said.  Liabilities now exceed assets by 300 million riyals and the
shareholders meeting will discuss the companyâ€™s possible
liquidation, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
