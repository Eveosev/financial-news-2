The Los Angeles Dodgers’ acquisition
of the Boston Red Sox’s three highest-paid players last month
fit the team’s business model,  Stan Kasten , Dodgers chief
executive officer, said at the Bloomberg Sports Business Summit
hosted by Bloomberg Link in New York.  The Dodgers acquired first baseman  Adrian Gonzalez , pitcher
Josh Beckett and outfielder Carl Crawford in August, about five
months after an investor group that included Guggenheim Partners
Chief Executive Officer Mark Walter, basketball Hall of Fame
player Magic Johnson and Kasten bought the team for $2.3
billion.  Gonzalez is making $21.9 million this season, Crawford
$20.3 million and Beckett $17 million. Kasten said all three are
stars in their prime.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
