Ecuadorean consumer prices rose the
most in five months in August, led by increases in food and
alcohol, as government tax increases trickled down to consumers.  Inflation in the Andean country was 0.29 percent in the
 month  and 4.88 percent from a  year  earlier, the National
Statistics and Census Institute said today in a report on its
 website .  President  Rafael Correa ’s administration increased taxes on
some imports, including alcohol and vehicles, in July to reduce
capital outflows. It also tightened controls on cash transfers
as part of measures to boost liquidity in the nation that uses
the  U.S. dollar  as its official currency. Global food prices
jumped 6.2 percent in July, the biggest monthly increase since
2009, according to the UN Food and Agriculture Organization’s
 world food price index , increasing pressure on processors who
import the raw materials.  Prices rose fastest in the coastal city of Esmeraldas,
climbing 0.64 percent in August from July, while they were
little changed in Guayaquil, the nation’s largest city, the
agency said. Ecuador, the smallest member of the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries, subsidizes fuel and the domestic
use of natural gas.  Producer prices rose 0.58 percent from July and 2.14
percent from August 2011, the agency said.  Consumer prices are forecast to increase an average 5.14
percent this year compared with 4.47 percent in 2011, according
to the  Finance Ministry ’s 2012 budget. The economy may expand
4.8 percent this year, the central bank said in July, less than
the 5.35 percent originally estimated in the 2012 budget.  To contact the reporter on this story:
