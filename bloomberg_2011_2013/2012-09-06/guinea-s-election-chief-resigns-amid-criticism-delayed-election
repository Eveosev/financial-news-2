Lounceny Camara, head of  Guinea ’s
election commission, resigned from his position following months
of criticism of the agency because of twice-delayed
parliamentary elections.  Political leaders are “using my presidency of the election
commission as an excuse” to delay the legislative vote, he said
in a speech on state-owned television late yesterday. “I hope
to move the electoral process forward by making this gesture,”
he said.  Camara was named head of the Conakry-based agency in 2010
to oversee a presidential election in the world’s biggest
bauxite exporter that was won by  Alpha Conde .  Opposition groups led two former prime ministers and
presidential candidates, Cellou Dalein Diallo and Lansana Kouyate, have organized several protests this year to demand the
members of the commission be dismissed. Originally planned for
December 2011, the legislative vote has been postponed twice and
a new date has not been announced.  Last month, Conde said he agreed to a partial
reorganization of the commission, including changing members of
the organization.  To contact the reporters on this story:
