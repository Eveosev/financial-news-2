NATO Secretary General Anders Fogh Rasmussen said he was “deeply concerned” by  Azerbaijan ’s
pardon and promotion of a convicted murderer who killed an
Armenian army officer with an ax.  Ramil Safarov, who was serving a life sentence for slaying
Gurgen Margaryan in his sleep in Budapest eight years ago, was
pardoned by Azeri President  Ilham Aliyev  and promoted after
 Hungary  transferred him home Aug. 31.  “The act he committed in 2004 was a terrible crime and
should not be glorified,” Rasmussen said today in the Armenian
capital, Yerevan. “The pardon damages trust and doesn’t
contribute to the peace process.”  Energy-exporter Azerbaijan fought  Armenia  over the Nagorno-
Karabakh enclave after the 1991 Soviet breakup, leaving tens of
thousands dead and more than 1 million displaced. While
hostilities ended with a Russia-brokered cease-fire accord in
1994, the sides have yet to sign a peace agreement.  Rasmussen said there must be no return to armed conflict.  “Tensions must be reduced and concrete steps must be taken
to promote regional cooperation and reconciliation,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
