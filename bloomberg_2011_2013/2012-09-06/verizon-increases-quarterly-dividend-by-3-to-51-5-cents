Verizon Communications Inc. (VZ) , the
second-largest U.S. phone company, raised its quarterly  dividend 
by 3 percent to 51.5 cents a share, the sixth consecutive year
of increases after wireless bills and customers rose last
quarter.  The dividend is payable on Nov. 1, the New York-based
company said in a statement. Increases in quarterly payout were
2.6 percent in each of the past two years.  Verizon reported a 19 percent gain in net income last
quarter after heftier mobile-phone bills helped make up for
sluggish growth of its land-line businesses. The shift to
smartphones, which let users surf the Web and watch videos, has
helped boost the size of subscribers’ phone bills.  “As the wireless industry matures, as the churn gets
lower, they’re generating more  cash flow ,” said  James Breen , an
analyst with William Blair & Co. in  Boston . “It makes sense
that the dividend would step up in line with that. This isn’t a
huge percentage.”  Verizon made about $2.6 billion in dividend payments to its
2.7 million shareholders in the first half of the year. It has
about 2.9 billion shares of common stock outstanding, it said in
a statement.  The shares gained 0.8 percent to $44.15 at the close in New
York. They have climbed 10 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
