Ben & Jerry’s Homemade Inc. won a
temporary restraining order against the producers of a series of
adult-film DVDs with titles and packaging based on its ice cream
flavors.  Ben & Jerry’s, a unit of London-based  Unilever NV (UNA) , sued in
New York yesterday to block Caballero Video from selling its
“Ben & Cherry’s” series of 10 DVDs with titles including
“Peanut Butter D-Cups” and “Boston Cream Thigh.”  U.S. District Judge Lewis Kaplan today ordered Caballero to
stop selling and distributing the materials and said all
infringing products, labels and advertising must be destroyed or
removed from retail shelves immediately.  The judge also directed that the producers appear before
him for a hearing on Sept. 12 to say why he shouldn’t issue a
preliminary injunction against them.  The DVD packaging features images of naked men and women
against backgrounds that copy the design of Ben & Jerry’s ice
cream containers including grazing cows and fluffy white clouds,
according to Ben & Jerry’s.  A woman who answered the telephone at Caballero’s offices
and declined to give her name said the company didn’t have an
immediate comment about the judge’s order.  The case is Ben & Jerry’s Homemade Inc. v. Rodax
Distributors Inc., 12-CV-6734, U.S. District Court, Southern
District of  New York  ( Manhattan ).  To contact the reporter on this story:
