A bid by National Football League
players to reopen a 2011 settlement of a lawsuit over revenue is
being considered by a federal judge following arguments in the
case in  Minneapolis .  U.S. District Judge David S. Doty is weighing a request by
the players to revisit last year’s settlement of claims over the
way the league shared revenue with athletes. The players,
claiming the league hid a $123 million per-club salary cap for
the 2010 season, want $3 billion in damages.  “We are here because of a startling, astonishing
revelation,”  Jeffrey Kessler , a lawyer for the players, told
the judge today at the start of a 90-minute hearing. “It never
occurred to us that there was collusion over a secret salary
cap.”  Gregg Levy of Covington & Burling, a lawyer for the league,
told the judge that players are seeking to reinterpret the terms
of a settlement that has turned out to disappoint them. Doty
said he would take the players’ request under advisement.  The broader lawsuit was brought by the late Philadelphia
Eagles Hall of Famer Reggie White. The suit initially resulted
in a 1992 settlement and later in a 2011 settlement, which
headed off a threatened lockout.  The players claim that the owners violated an earlier
agreement that required uncapped salaries for the 2010 season.  The case is White v.  National Football League , 92-cv-00906,
U.S. District Court, District of Minnesota (Minneapolis).  To contact the reporters on this story:
