Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM)  is in talks with
Turkiye Petrolleri AO,  Turkey â€™s state oil and gas company, known
as TPAO, to explore for shale gas in southeast Turkey,  Hurriyet 
reported, citing unidentified Energy Ministry officials.  The area for which Exxon seeks a license is adjacent to the
Saribugday-1 field in Diyarbakir province, where  Royal Dutch
Shell Plc (RDSA)  and TPAO started exploring last week, the newspaper
said.  There may be 13 trillion cubic meters of shale-gas
reserves, 1.8 trillion of which are recoverable, Ismail
Bahtiyar, chairman of the Turkish Association of Petroleum
Geologists, said April 20.  To contact the reporter on this story:
