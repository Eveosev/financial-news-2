Treasuries fell, pushing 10-year
yields up the most in more than a month, after data suggested
U.S. job growth is accelerating and European officials announced
plans to buy bonds to curb the region’s sovereign-debt crisis.  Ten-year note  yields climbed from almost a one-month low as
ADP Employer Services said companies added more workers than
forecast and a government report showed fewer Americans filed
applications for  unemployment benefits . European Central Bank
President Mario Draghi said policy makers agreed to an unlimited
bond-purchase program to regain control of  interest rates  in the
euro region and fight speculation of a currency breakup.  “It’s two-thirds  Europe , one-third ADP,” said Justin Lederer, an interest-rate strategist at Cantor Fitzgerald LP in
 New York , one of 21 primary dealers that trade with the  Federal
Reserve . “It should calm the short-term fears about Europe, but
there are still many concerns. It’s definitely a step in the
right direction.”  The  10-year note yield  climbed eight basis points, or 0.08
percentage point, to 1.68 percent at 5 p.m. in New York. It was
the biggest jump since Aug. 3. The yield touched 1.54 percent on
Sept. 4, the lowest level since Aug. 6. The  price  of the 1.625
percent note due in August 2022 dropped 3/4, or $7.50 per $1,000
face amount, to 99 1/2.  Ten-year yields reached a record low 1.38 percent on July
25, and rose to a three-month high 1.86 percent on Aug. 21. They
will trade at 1.79 percent at year-end, according to a Bloomberg
survey of economists in which the most recent projections are
given the heaviest weighting.  Thirty-year bond  yields rose nine basis points today to 2.8
percent, the highest level since Aug. 27.  Treasury Auctions  The Treasury said it will auction $66 billion of notes and
bonds next week: $32 billion of three-year debt on Sept. 11, $21
billion of 10-year securities on Sept. 12 and $13 billion of 30-
year bonds on Sept. 13.  Companies in the U.S. added 201,000 workers in August,
according to Roseland, New Jersey-based ADP. The median estimate
in a Bloomberg survey projected a 140,000 increase. Initial
jobless claims decreased by 12,000 to 365,000 in the week ended
Sept. 1, the fewest in a month, the Labor Department reported
today in  Washington .  Labor Department data due tomorrow will show the U.S. added
130,000 jobs last month, trailing the 163,000 increase in July,
economists in a Bloomberg survey forecast. The  unemployment rate 
held steady at 8.3 percent, economists projected.  ‘More Speculation’  “Prior to the ADP number, people were probably of the mind
that if it surprised, it would surprise to the downside,” said
 David Coard , head of fixed-income trading in New York at
Williams Capital Group, a brokerage for institutional investors.
“There may be a little more speculation that the number
tomorrow could be better than expected, especially with this
claims number.”  The ADP data may not translate to a higher-than-forecast
increase in tomorrow’s payrolls report, TJ Marta, a Bloomberg
analyst, wrote in a note. Of the 11 times since 2006 that the
ADP data beat expectations by 60,000 or more, nonfarm payrolls
missed estimates five times, he wrote.  Treasuries remained lower after the  Institute for Supply
Management ’s non-manufacturing index climbed to a three-month
high of 53.7 from 52.6 in July, the Tempe, Arizona-based group
said today. The gauge covers about 90 percent of the  U.S.
economy , and readings above 50 signal expansion.  Quantitative Easing  Bond yields tumbled last week as Fed Chairman  Ben S.
Bernanke  signaled the central bank may buy more debt under
quantitative easing to lower unemployment.  The policy-setting  Federal Open Market Committee  meets
Sept. 12-13. Bernanke, speaking on Aug. 31 at a conference in
Jackson Hole,  Wyoming , said the costs of “nontraditional
policies” appeared manageable when considered carefully. He
said he wouldn’t rule out steps to lower a jobless rate he
described as a “grave concern.”  The Fed purchased $2.3 trillion of securities from 2008 to
2011 in two rounds of the stimulus strategy known as
quantitative easing.  The central bank’s favored bond-market gauge of  inflation 
expectations, the five-year, five-year forward break-even rate,
which shows how much traders anticipate consumer prices will
rise during a period of five years starting in 2017, declined to
2.43 percent on Aug. 31. It was the lowest level since July 26.
The average for 2012 is 2.54 percent.  End Wager  After today’s selloff of 10-year Treasuries, investors
should end a bet that the notes will continue to fall, and
realize gains before tomorrow’s payrolls report, according to a
client note from the primary dealer Credit Suisse Group AG. The
firm retains its forecast that the yields will drop to 1.35
percent by year-end, New York-based strategists  Carl Lantz  and
William Marshall wrote.  The Fed bought $1.8 billion of Treasuries today due from
2036 to 2042. The purchase is part of an effort called Operation
Twist in which it is swapping shorter-term Treasuries in its
holdings with those due in six to 30 years to put downward
pressure on long-term interest rates.  U.S.  government bonds  returned 2.5 percent in 2012 through
yesterday, Bank of America Merrill Lynch index data show. That
compares with a 13 percent gain in the  Standard & Poor’s 500
Index (SPX)  of shares, including reinvested dividends.  The ECB’s bond-buying plan, called Outright Monetary
Transactions, will focus on government bonds with maturities of
one to three years, bank President  Mario Draghi  said. The ECB
will only intervene in the secondary market if a country has
asked Europe’s bailout fund to buy its debt on the primary
market, ensuring strict conditions are agreed to, he said.  “‘We will have a fully effective backstop to avoid
destructive scenarios with potentially severe challenges for
 price stability  in the euro area,” Draghi said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
