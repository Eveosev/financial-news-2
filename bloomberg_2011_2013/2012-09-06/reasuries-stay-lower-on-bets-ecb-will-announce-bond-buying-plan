Treasuries fell for a third day amid
speculation the  European Central Bank  will announce details
today of a plan to buy sovereign bonds of highly-indebted euro-
region nations, dimming the allure of refuge assets.  U.S. 10-year yields have climbed from a one-month low as
two ECB officials said yesterday President  Mario Draghi ’s bond-
buying proposal involves unlimited purchases of euro-area
government debt that will be sterilized. Demand for Treasuries
was supported before an industry report forecast to show
American companies hired fewer workers in August.  “Bond purchases by the ECB won’t resolve the debt crisis,
but at least it does buy a lot more time and that’s important,”
said Jamie Searle, a fixed-income strategist at Citigroup Inc.
in London. “The mood is pretty much risk-on and that might not
bode well for safe assets. We have to see what the ECB says
later today, and we can’t rule out the risk that the market will
be disappointed.”  The 10-year yield rose two basis points, or 0.02 percentage
point, to 1.62 percent at 7:51 a.m. in  New York . The rate
touched 1.54 percent on Sept. 4, the lowest since Aug. 6. The
1.625 percent note due August 2022 fell 5/32, or $1.56 per
$1,000 face amount, to 100 3/32.  U.S.  government bonds  had returned 2.5 percent in 2012
through yesterday, Bank of America Merrill Lynch index data
show. That compares with a 13 percent gain in the  Standard &
Poor’s 500 Index (SPX)  of shares, including reinvested dividends.
German securities handed investors a 3.5 percent gain during the
same period, according to the indexes.  ECB Policies  The  10-year bund  yield added two basis points to 1.50
percent and European  stocks  gained, with the Stoxx Europe 600
Index rising 0.7 percent.  The ECB blueprint, which may be called “Monetary Outright
Transactions,” will focus on government bonds rather than a
broader range of assets and will target maturities of three
years or less, according to central-bank officials briefed on
the proposal who requested anonymity.  Europe’s central bank will sterilize its bond purchases by
removing the same amount of money it spends from elsewhere in
the system, ensuring a neutral impact on  money supply , the
officials said. Policy makers meeting in  Frankfurt  left the
benchmark rate at a record low of 0.75 percent, as predicted by
28 of 58 economists in a Bloomberg survey.  The policy-setting  Federal Open Market Committee  meets
Sept. 12-13. Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke , speaking
on Aug. 31 in  Jackson Hole ,  Wyoming , said the costs of
“nontraditional policies” appeared manageable when considered
carefully. He said he wouldn’t rule out steps to lower a jobless
rate he described as a “grave concern.”  U.S. Jobs  U.S. corporate employment rose by 140,000, the least since
May, according to a separate Bloomberg survey of economists
taken before ADP Employer Services announces the figure today.
Labor Department data tomorrow are forecast to show payrolls
increased by 127,000 jobs in August, fewer than the 163,000
positions added in July.  “Speculation will increase that the Fed eventually
undertakes a third round of quantitative easing if the payroll
figure is within the market consensus,” said  Kiyoshi Ishigane ,
a senior strategist at Mitsubishi UFJ Asset Management Co. in
Tokyo, which oversees about $76 billion. “That’s more likely to
weigh on Treasury yields.”  Quantitative Easing  The Fed bought $2.3 trillion of mortgage and Treasury debt
between 2008 and 2011 in two rounds of the stimulus strategy
known as quantitative easing.  The U.S. central bank is  scheduled  to buy as much as $2
billion of Treasuries today due from February 2036 to August
2042 as part of so-called Operation Twist, a program to swap
shorter-term securities in its holdings with longer-term debt to
put downward pressure on borrowing costs.  The Treasury will announce today that it will auction $32
billion of three-year notes on Sept. 11, $21 billion of 10-year
debt the next day and $13 billion of 30-year bonds on Sept. 13,
according to Wrightson ICAP LLC, an economic advisory company
based in  Jersey City ,  New Jersey .  Volatility dropped yesterday for the first time in four
sessions. Bank of America Merrill Lynch’s  MOVE index , which
measures price swings based on Treasury options, slid to 67.1
basis points from 68.7 on Aug. 31. The average over the past 12
month was 83.1.  To contact the reporters on this story:
