Mexico ’s peso rose to a four-month
high as European Central Bank President  Mario Draghi  said policy
makers agreed to an unlimited bond-purchase program, boosting
optimism for progress in stemming the debt crisis.  The peso appreciated 0.6 percent to 13.0361 per dollar at
9:56 a.m. in Mexico City after touching 13.0344 in intraday
trading, the strongest level since May 4. It was the currency’s
fifth consecutive gain and pushed this year’s rally to 6.9
percent, the biggest among the dollar’s 16 most-traded
counterparts tracked by Bloomberg.  The peso strengthened with most other emerging-market
currencies after Draghi said the ECB will target  government
bonds  with maturities of one to three years as part of an effort
to save the euro.  “The peso is rising due to a bullish perspective for what
the ECB could do in the near future,”  Ramon Cordova , a currency
trader at Banco Base SA in San Pedro Garza Garcia, Mexico, said
in a phone interview. “It’s the asset that a lot of people use
to hedge their exposure to Latin American assets.”  The yield on Mexican local-currency bonds due in 2024 rose
five basis points, or 0.05 percentage point, to 5.58 percent,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The price declined 0.58
centavo to 139.17 centavos per peso.  To contact the reporters on this story:
