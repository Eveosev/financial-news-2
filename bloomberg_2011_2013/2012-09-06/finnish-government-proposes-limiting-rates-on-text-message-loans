The Finnish Justice Ministryâ€™s
proposal to limit interest rates on loans requested via text
message was sent to parliament today.  The Helsinki-based ministry proposes to cap interest rates
on loans of less than 2,000 euros ($2,500) at 50 percent plus
reference rate, which is currently at 1 percent, according to an
e-mailed statement from the ministry today. The government aims
to prevent debt growth and an increase in unserviced loans by
setting a ceiling for interest rates.  The average annual percentage rate of text-message loans is
about 920 percent, the ministry said in an e-mailed statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
