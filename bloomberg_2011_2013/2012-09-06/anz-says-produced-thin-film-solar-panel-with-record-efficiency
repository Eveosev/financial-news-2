Manz AG (M5Z) , a German manufacturer of
production equipment to the solar and flat-panel industry, said
it made a thin-film module that achieved a record efficiency.  Manz made a module based on copper indium gallium selenium,
or CIGS, technology with total panel efficiency of 14.6 percent
on its commercial mass production line, it said in a statement
today. That translates into power generation costs of 4 euro
cents a kilowatt-hour in  Spain  and 8 cents in Germany, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
