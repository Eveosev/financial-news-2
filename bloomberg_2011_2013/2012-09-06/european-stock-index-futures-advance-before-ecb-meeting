European stocks  rallied the most in
a month after European Central Bank President  Mario Draghi  said
policy makers agreed to an unlimited bond-purchase program as
they try to regain control of interest rates in the euro area.  UniCredit SpA (UCG)  and  Societe Generale SA (GLE)  led gains in banks,
climbing more than 7 percent.  Lonmin Plc (LMI) , the platinum producer
whose main mine has been shut since Aug. 10 because of a strike
that led to 44 deaths, soared 7.3 percent after agreeing to open
wage talks with labor unions.  Whitbread Plc (WTB)  jumped 5.3 percent
after sales climbed.  The  Stoxx Europe 600 Index (SXXP)  surged 2.3 percent to 271.67 at
the close, its biggest increase since Aug. 3. The gauge has
 rallied 16 percent from this year’s low  on June 4 as Draghi
pledged to do everything possible to preserve the euro.  “We are having a relief rally,” said Alan Higgins, chief
investment officer at Coutts & Co. in  London . “There is relief
that what Draghi has said is just in line with the rumors. The
new plan is essentially to help countries finance themselves at
the front-end.”  National benchmark indexes climbed in all 18 western-
European markets, and all 19  industry groups  in the Stoxx 600
advanced. Germany’s DAX rallied 2.9 percent and the U.K.’s FTSE
100 gained 2.1 percent. France’s CAC 40 jumped 3.1 percent.  The ECB program “will enable us to address severe
distortions in government bond markets which originate from, in
particular, unfounded fears on the part of investors of the
reversibility of the euro,” Draghi said at a press conference
in Frankfurt. “Under appropriate conditions, we will have a
fully effective backstop to avoid destructive scenarios with
potentially severe challenges for  price stability .”  Bond Buying  The ECB will target  government bonds  with maturities of one
to three years, including longer-dated debt that has a residual
maturity of that length, Draghi said. Purchases will be fully
sterilized, meaning that the overall impact on the  money supply 
will be neutral, and the ECB will not have seniority, he said.  “European financial markets are standing tall as the
central bank finally responds with a bond-buying plan like we
haven’t seen before,” Ishaq Siddiqi, a market strategist at ETX
Capital in London, wrote in e-mailed comments. “Operating
within its mandate, the ECB will help reduce borrowing costs of
indebted euro-zone members by buying their bonds.”  The ECB left its  benchmark interest rate  at a record low of
0.75 percent today, as predicted by 28 of 58 economists in a
Bloomberg survey. The remainder had forecast a quarter-point
cut. The  Bank of England  kept its rate at 0.5 percent and held
its  bond-purchase target  at 375 billion pounds ($597 billion).  U.S. Jobs  In the U.S., companies added more workers than forecast in
August, a private report based on payrolls showed. The 201,000
increase in employment, the biggest gain in five months,
followed July’s revised 173,000 increase, Roseland, New Jersey-
based ADP Employer Services said. The median forecast of 41
economists surveyed by Bloomberg called for an advance of
140,000.  The Institute for Supply Management’s index of U.S. non-
manufacturing businesses, which covers about 90 percent of the
economy, rose to 53.7 in August from 52.6 in July, the Tempe,
Arizona-based group said.  A  gauge of banks  had the biggest gain among 19 industry
groups in the Stoxx 600, rising 4.4 percent. UniCredit, Italy’s
largest lender, advanced 8.1 percent to 3.51 euros and France’s
 Societe Generale  rallied 7.8 percent to 22.93 euros.  Banco
Espirito Santo SA (BES)  surged 8.3 percent to 61.3 euro cents in
Lisbon.  Lonmin surged 7.3 percent to 568 pence. The company agreed
today with three labor union to reopen a wage deal agreed in
December to raise pay as much as 10 percent, depending on
employees’ job categories, in each of two years.  Whitbread Climbs  Whitbread jumped 5.3 percent to 2,210 pence after saying
 like-for-like sales  rose 4.3 percent in the 24-week period to
Aug. 16, while total sales increased 14.3 percent. Chief
Executive Officer Andy Harrison said that the company should
meet the targets of its growth program even though trading
remains variable from month to month.  Dixons Retail Plc (DXNS)  increased 3.9 percent to 19.85 pence
after fiscal first quarter like-for-like sales climbed 5
percent, beating estimates projecting a 4 percent gain. The
consumer electronics retailer said same-store sales in the U.K.
and Ireland, which account for almost half of the group’s
business, increased 7 percent.  William Morrison Supermarkets Plc (MRW)  gained 4.3 percent to
292.7 pence, its biggest rally since July 2009, after reporting
a  first-half underlying pretax profit  of 445 million pounds,
exceeding the average estimate of 431.5 million pounds.  Mining Companies  Salzgitter AG (SZG) , Germany’s second-biggest steelmaker, rose
7.1 percent to 30.23 euros.  Antofagasta Plc (ANTO) , the Chilean copper
producer, advanced 5.6 percent to 1,157 pence. A gauge of basic-
resources companies posted the third-biggest gain of the 19
industry groups in the Stoxx 600.  Luxottica Group SpA (LUX) , owner of the Oakley and Ray-Ban
sunglasses brands, tumbled 4.8 percent to 28 euros as the
company’s founder, Leonardo Del Vecchio, sold 18 million common
shares at 27 euros apiece.  Nokia Oyj (NOK1V) , the mobile-phone maker that lost more than 95
percent of market value since 2007, dropped 2.9 percent to 1.93
euros after the stock was cut to sell from hold at Deutsche Bank
AG. The shares sank 13 percent yesterday after the company
unveiled two smartphones using Microsoft Corp.’s new Windows
Phone software.  The volume of shares changing hands on the Stoxx 600 was 72
percent higher than the average of the last 30 days, data
compiled by Bloomberg show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
