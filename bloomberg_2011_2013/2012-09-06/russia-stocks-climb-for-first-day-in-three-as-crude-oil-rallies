Russian stocks rose for the first
time in three days as crude oil, the nation’s chief export
earner, climbed and as investors awaited details of a European
Central Bank plan to ease the region’s debt crisis.  The  Micex Index (INDEXCF)  increased 1.1 percent to 1,437.56 by 12:32
p.m. in Moscow. OAO  Mechel (MTLR) ,  Russia ’s biggest coking coal
producer, gained 1.5 percent, while OAO Severstal added 1.6
percent.  Oil companies  advanced, with OAO Gazprom Neft and
preferred shares of OAO Surgutneftegas rising 1.7 percent and
2.4 percent respectively.  Crude rose 1.2 percent to $96.49 in  New York . Oil and gas
contribute about 50 percent to Russia’s state revenue. ECB
President  Mario Draghi  favors unlimited purchases of government
debt that will be sterilized to assuage concerns about printing
money, two central bank officials briefed on the plan said
before bank policy makers meet today.  “The market players are keen to get some clarity on the
possible bond purchases,” Natalia Orlova, chief economist at
 Alfa Bank  in Moscow, said by phone. “The mood is very positive,
even some details from the ECB today can drive up the market.”  The dollar-denominated  RTS Index (RTSI$)  advanced 1.5 percent to
1,412.06, heading for the biggest gain since Aug. 21.  Standard & Poor’s GSCI Index of raw materials gained 0.8
percent to 673.73.  Sberbank, VTB  OAO Sberbank climbed 0.8 percent to 93.73 rubles as the
ruble strengthened for the third day. A stronger ruble
encourages Russians to deposit and abstain from converting
ruble deposits, Sberbank’s main source of funding. VTB Group
rose 0.9 percent to 5.31 kopeks. VTB Capital said Sberbank
remains its “top pick” in Russia, citing the lender’s discount
to emerging-market peers in a note today. The stock trades at
5.9 times estimated earnings.  OAO Aeroflot dropped 0.2 pecent to 42.55 rubles, retreating
for the third day. Russia’s biggest airline said yesterday
first-half net income fell 90 percent as operating costs surged.  The Micex trades at 5.3 times  estimated earnings  and has
rallied 2.5 percent this year. That compares with a multiple of
9.8 times and a 2.9 percent advance for the MSCI  Emerging
Markets  Index.  Russian equities have the lowest valuations based on
estimated earnings among 21 emerging markets tracked by
Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
