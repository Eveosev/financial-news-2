of Rouen,  Europe ’s biggest cereal-shipping hub, slumped 55
percent in the latest week as wheat cargoes to  Algeria  declined.  Outgoing grain cargoes fell to 76,597 metric tons between
Aug. 30 and Sept. 5 from 169,497 tons a week earlier, the  Seine
River port  wrote in an e-mailed report today.  Shipments in the week included 73,791 tons of wheat, down
from 159,450 a week earlier, with Algeria and  Portugal  the

importer of French grain, fell to 48,800 tons from the previous
week’s 109,150 tons.  Rouen accounted for 41 percent of  France ’s grain exports by
