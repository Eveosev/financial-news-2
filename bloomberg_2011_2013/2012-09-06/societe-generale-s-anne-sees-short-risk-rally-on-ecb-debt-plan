Benoit Anne , head of emerging
markets strategy at Societe Generale SA in London, comments on
the impact of the European Central Bank’s debt-buying plan on
risky assets globally.  ECB President  Mario Draghi  said today policy makers agreed
to an unlimited bond-purchase program to regain control of
 interest rates  in the euro area and fight speculation of a
currency breakup.  Anne gave his comments in an e-mailed response to
questions.  “It is overall positive. No disappointment there, but of
course not the final story given the big market events following
up such as non-farm payrolls tomorrow and FOMC next week,” he
wrote, referring to U.S. jobs data and the Federal Open Market
Committee meeting on Sept. 12 and 13.  “I expect a short risk rally tomorrow, as from a risk
management perspective the next hurdle has to be handled
carefully too,” which is the jobs data.  “The  Indian rupee  is highly sensitive to the global risk
picture, so it is positive for now, but the domestic
fundamentals are still not helping. I wouldn’t expect a strong
rupee rally at this point.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
