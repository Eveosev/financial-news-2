China Development Bank will today
sign an accord with La Caisse des Depots et Consignations to
invest jointly in unlisted French and Chinese companies,  Les
Echos   reported  in an interview with CDB President Zhang Xuguang.  CDB, which will create with CDC a 150 million-euro ($189
million ) fund managed by Cathay Capital, isnâ€™t concerned about
the European debt crisis, Xuguang said, according to the French
newspaper.  To contact the reporter on this story:
