Air Nigeria  has suspended its
operations for as long as 12 months due to the “disloyalty” of
some staff and a weak business environment, said Jimoh Ibrahim,
the airline’s chairman.  The airline will recommence operations as soon as 50 of its
best staff agree on how to “clean up” the company, Ibrahim
said by phone today from Lagos, the commercial capital.  Air Nigeria has only been operating international flights
since June, after authorities suspended its domestic flights to
allow for a financial audit, Joe Obi, a spokesman for the
Aviation Ministry in Abuja, the capital, said today by phone.
The airline was also being investigated by the Federal Inland
Revenue Service for taxes owed.  The agency said in June that it  arrested  Kinfe Kayssay, Air
Nigeria’s managing director, over a 4.9 billion naira ($30
million) tax bill. It said the company hadn’t filed annual tax
returns for 2011. Air Nigeria said the tax collector was
demanding payments dating back to the time when the company was
partly owned by  Richard Branson ’s Virgin Atlantic Airways Ltd.,
before Ibrahim acquired it in April 2010.  Yesterday, the Aviation Ministry allowed Dana Airlines Ltd.
to resume operations. The carrier had been suspended when one of
its planes crashed during the approach to Lagos airport on June
3, killing all 153 people on board.  To contact the reporter on this story:
