An Italian request for aid from the
 European Central Bank  wouldn’t help the economy because it would
bring extra requirements for budget austerity, said the economic
spokesman for the nation’s Democratic Party, or PD.  “What further restrictive measures will a country in a
deep recession and with ever-increasing unemployment, due to the
very steep rise in  interest rates , have to take?” Stefano
Fassina, whose party backs Prime Minister  Mario Monti ’s
government and leads in recent opinion polls, said today in an
e-mailed statement from Rome. “It would be self-defeating for
Italy, and for Spain, to request aid.”  Italy is seeking to rein in government borrowing costs as
it copes with its fourth recession since 2001. ECB President
 Mario Draghi  said today that policy makers agreed to an
unlimited bond-purchase program to regain control of interest
rates in the region and fight speculation of a euro breakup.  Access to the program would require a nation to request aid
from Europe’s rescue fund and agree to conditions. While Fassina
appreciates Draghi’s efforts, “we have to understand the
conditions required for the ECB to decide to intervene.”  With 28 percent, the PD and its allies received the most
backing in a  survey  released on Sept. 3 by Naples-based polling
company IPR. Former Prime Minister  Silvio Berlusconi ’s People of
Liberty party, which also supports Monti’s government, and its
allies were second with 21 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
