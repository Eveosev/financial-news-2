Citigroup Inc. (C) , the third-biggest
U.S. bank by assets, hired Kris Van Broekhoven from  Deutsche
Bank AG (DB)  as global head of a new commodity-trade-financing unit.  Van Broekhoven, whose group helps trading companies finance
commodity purchases, will be based in London and initially focus
on the energy industry, the bank said in a statement. He will
report to John Ahearn, global head of trade, and Sam Sehgal,
head of trade finance for Europe, Asia and the  Middle East .  Citigroup’s transaction-services division is targeting
commodity deals as Chief Executive Officer Vikram Pandit seeks
to boost revenue at the New York-based lender. Profit at the
unit, which  says  it handles more than $3 trillion in
transactions each day, rose 8 percent to $1.83 billion for the
first half of 2012, compared with the same period last year.  The bank also hired Georges Romano from  Credit Agricole SA (ACA) 
to head the export and agency finance business for Latin
America, it said. Ae Kyong Chung was named global head of the
export and agency finance group.  Some European banks have pulled back from lending to
commodities traders, creating opportunities for banks such as
Citigroup, according to  Jack Scoville , vice president at Price
Futures Group Inc. in Chicago.  “Those guys kind of pulled out of the market,” Scoville
said in a phone interview. “Citi and whoever else is doing it
is kind of filling into a hole that’s been created there.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
