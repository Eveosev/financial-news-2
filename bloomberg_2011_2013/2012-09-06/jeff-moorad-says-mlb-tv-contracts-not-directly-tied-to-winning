Jeff Moorad , a former  San Diego 
Padres chief executive officer, said the size of a team’s
television contract isn’t reliant on the club’s on-field
success.  “I’ll go out on a limb and say winning is immaterial,”
Moorad said at the Bloomberg Sports Business Summit hosted by
 Bloomberg Link  in New York.  Baseball games can be seen in markets all around the
country. That gives teams the ability to go into any corporate
marketing department and say they can deliver the top 25-27
markets in the U.S. on a one-stop basis, Moorad said.  That and the media industry’s need to deliver the sort of
programming that viewers are less likely to record for later
viewing drives larger and larger deals, he said.  The Padres are 64-74 this season and 13 1/2 games behind
the first-place  San Francisco Giants  in the National League West
division of  Major League Baseball . They have had one winning
season since 2007 and never have won the World Series.  “We did a 20-year contract with Fox in San Diego, and over
20 years, Fox is betting we are going to figure it out as a
baseball franchise,” Moorad said. “It’s interesting. I don’t
know that winning is a major factor when it relates to media
contracts long-term.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
