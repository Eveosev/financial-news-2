Japan  wants to reduce its nuclear
 energy supply  to less than 15 percent of its energy mix by 2030,
the Kyodo News agency said today, citing a government energy
policy  draft .  The draft said the country eventually wants to reduce
nuclear to zero from about 30 percent before the 2011 Fukushima
nuclear disaster, and included a blank space for the date when
it expects to reach that goal, Kyodo said.  Japan also plans to cut emissions of  greenhouse gases  by 20
percent by 2030 from the 1990 levels. That means it will
probably miss a goal, set in 2009, of cutting emissions by 25
percent by 2020. The country now expects emissions in 2020 to be
from zero to 9 percent lower than in 1990, Kyodo said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
