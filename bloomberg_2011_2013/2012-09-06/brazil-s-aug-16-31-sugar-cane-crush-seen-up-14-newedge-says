Sugar-cane crushing in  Brazil ’s
Center South, the world’s top growing region, may have increased
14 percent in the second half of August as dryness allowed
fieldwork to accelerate, Newedge Group said.  Growers probably harvested 46.3 million metric tons from
Aug. 16 to Aug. 31, Alex Oliveira, a trader at the New York-
based brokerage, said today in a telephone interview. The dry
conditions allowed “everyone to crush at full capacity,” he
said.  In the second half of August 2011, the harvest was 40.5
million tons, Sao Paulo-based Unica, an industry group, said on
Sept. 12, 2011.  Unica may release data as soon as Sept. 10 for the second
half of August.  To contact the reporter on this story:
