Suzuki Motor Corp. (7269)  said it expects
production at the Manesar,  India , factory run by its local unit
to recover to 800 cars a day this month after riots over a labor
dispute in July caused its closure for a month.  The factory built about 1,700 cars daily before the
disturbances that left one manager dead and is currently
operating under police surveillance, President  Osamu Suzuki  told
reporters today in Tokyo. The factory currently makes about 670
vehicles a day.  Suzuki is increasing output after Indian unit  Maruti Suzuki
India Ltd. (MSIL)  resumed partial production at its Manesar plant Aug.
21. Sales at Maruti Suzuki, India’s largest automaker by volume,
plunged 41 percent in August, after a general manager was killed
and dozens of executives hurt in a disturbance at the plant
about 50 kilometers (31 miles) southwest of  New Delhi .  “Without question, we hope that legal action will be
taken,” over the riot, Suzuki said. “It is still unclear what
caused the riot.”  The  carmaker  rose 0.8 percent to 1,374 yen as of 2:29 p.m.
in  Tokyo  trading. Maruti advanced 1 percent to 1,185.20 rupees
as of 11 a.m. in Mumbai.  The automaker said on Aug. 2 it will revise its profit
forecast if necessary, depending on the situation at Manesar.
Closure of the factory meant a loss of about 680 million rupees
($12.2 million) per day, according to estimates from Maruti.  Net income will probably jump 30 percent from the previous
year to 70 billion yen ($892 million) in the 12 months ending
March 31, Suzuki forecasts. Sales may advance 3.5 percent to 2.6
trillion yen, the company projects.  To contact the reporters on this story:
