Salzgitter AG (SZG) , the second-largest
German steelmaker,  rose  the most in almost three weeks as
investors awaited details of the  European Central Bank ’s plan to
ease the debt crisis.  Salzgitter, based in the city of the same name, climbed as
much as 4.6 percent to 29.51 euros. It was up 4.3 percent at
12:55 p.m. local time for the best performance on the MDAX
index. ThyssenKrupp, the largest German steelmaker, gained 1.9
percent. Salzgitter has fallen 10 percent in the past two weeks.  “Now there is a backlash caused by the hope that the
European Central Bank will become active today,” said Ingo Schmidt, an analyst at  Hamburger Sparkasse .  Salzgitter’s second-quarter pretax profit slumped 98
percent because of “unsatisfactory” selling prices and
“persistently high” raw material costs, the company said last
month.  The stock has also benefited from a recent drop in the
price of iron and coking coal, and a stable euro, said Marc Gabriel, an analyst at Bankhaus Lampe KG. “The pressure on
margins thus slightly decreased,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
