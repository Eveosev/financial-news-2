Turkish bond  yields  fell to the
lowest level in a month as investors speculated European Central
Bank President  Mario Draghi  will unveil measures that can stem
the region’s debt crisis.  Yields on two-year benchmark debt retreated four basis
points, or 0.04 percentage point, to 7.56 percent at 11:48 a.m.
in Istanbul, declining for a third day to the lowest level since
Aug. 7. The lira weakened less than 0.1 percent to 1.8191.  Draghi favors unlimited purchases of government debt that
will be sterilized to assuage concerns about printing money, two
central bank officials briefed on the plan said. He will speak
at a press briefing after the ECB’s Governing Council decides on
 interest rates  and his plan that aims to lower borrowing costs
in indebted countries and prevent a breakup of the euro.  The decline in Turkish yields “stems from the positive
climate about the bond-buying plans ECB is expected to announce
today,” Tunca Alp, head of trading at Sekerbank AS in Istanbul,
said in e-mailed comments.  The European Union countries buy 34.3 percent of Turkish
exports,  according to data published  by the state statistics
agency on Aug. 31.  Turkey ’s central bank offered to lend 2 billion liras
($1.09 billion) at its lowest 5.75 percent policy rate today,
the same amount of funding provided a week earlier in the one-
week repurchase agreements auction.  To contact the reporter on this story:
