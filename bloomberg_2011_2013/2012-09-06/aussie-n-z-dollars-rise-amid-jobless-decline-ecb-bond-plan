The Australian dollar gained for the
first time in four days versus its U.S. counterpart after the
country’s jobless rate unexpectedly declined in August on signs
employers in mining states are still hiring workers.  New Zealand’s dollar and the Aussie rose versus most of
their major peers after European Central Bank President  Mario
Draghi  said policy makers had agreed on an unlimited debt-buying
program, bolstering appetite for higher-yielding assets.
 Australia ’s unemployment rate fell to 5.1 percent, from 5.2
percent in July. The median forecast in a Bloomberg News survey
was for an increase to 5.3 percent.  “The Australian dollar is defying gravity in the face of
the deterioration in the U.S. and global manufacturing cycle,”
Kit Juckes, London-based head of foreign-exchange research at
Societe Generale SA, wrote yesterday in a note to clients.  Australia’s currency appreciated 0.9 percent to $1.0284
