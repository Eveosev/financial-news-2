What follows are opening calls for
U.S. grain and oilseed markets, which resume trading at 5 p.m.
on the Chicago Board of Trade.  -- Soybean futures may open steady to 1 cent a bushel higher on
speculation that a U.S. Department of Agriculture report next
week will show the worst drought since 1956 damaged plants,  Dave Marshall , a farm market adviser for Toay Commodity Futures Group
LLC, said by telephone.  -- Wheat futures may open steady to 1 cent a bushel lower as
rain in parts of the U.S. Midwest increases soil moisture ahead
of planting of winter varieties, Marshall said.  -- Corn futures are called to open steady to 1 cent a bushel
lower, Marshall said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
