AgustaWestland, owned by
 Finmeccanica SpA (FNC)  of Italy, expects  Turkey  to choose a supplier
next month for seven personnel-carrying police helicopters among
bids including the company’s own AW139 model.  AgustaWestland, which is building combat helicopters for
the Turkish army in a joint venture with state-owned Turkish
Aerospace Industries Inc., based in Ankara, submitted its bid to
the interior ministry in the summer, Roberto Garavaglia, senior
vice president in charge of marketing, said in an interview on
the sidelines of an airshow in Istanbul.  The other bidders are Eurocopter SAS, a unit of  European
Aeronautic, Defence & Space Co. (EAD) , and  Textron Inc. (TXT) ’s Bell
Helicopter unit, Garavaglia said. The list price for the most
basic AW139 model is about 10 million euros ($12.6 million), he
said. The fuselage for the seven helicopters would be built at
the TAI plant in Ankara, Garavaglia said.  AgustaWestland has supplied about 20 of 32 commercial
helicopters Turkish customers bought in the past five years,
Garavaglia said. It will have supplied 60 T129 combat
helicopters to the Turkish army under the ATAK project by 2018,
he said. The number will increase to 91 later, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
