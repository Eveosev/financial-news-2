Oil rose for a second day in New
York as European Central Bank President  Mario Draghi  said policy
makers agreed to an unlimited bond-purchase program.  Futures pared earlier gains of as much as 1.3 percent after
Draghi said the bloc’s economy will contract by 0.4 percent this
year, compared with a previous forecast of a 0.1 percent
decline. Energy Department data may show that U.S. crude
supplies fell for the first time in six weeks.  “We’ll have to have these quantitative easing measures.
From a fundamental point of view, the market is still a bit
oversupplied and needs rising demand to rebalance,” said Andy Sommer, a senior trader at Axpo AG in Baden,  Switzerland , who
predicts Brent will end the year at $112 a barrel.  Crude for October delivery climbed as much as $1.26 to
$96.62 a barrel in electronic trading on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange  and was at $95.82 at 1:56 p.m.  London  time. Futures
have lost 3 percent this year.  Brent oil for October settlement on the ICE Futures Europe
exchange in London advanced as much as $1.27, or 1.1 percent, to
$114.36 a barrel. The European benchmark crude was at a  premium 
of $17.52 to New York-traded West Texas Intermediate grade,
compared with $17.72 yesterday.  The ECB needs to be in a position to ensure the
transmission of its rates in all euro-area countries, Draghi
said after the ECB held its benchmark rate at a record low of
0.75 percent.  Severe Challenges  “We will have a fully effective backstop to avoid
destructive scenarios with potentially severe challenges for
 price stability ,” Draghi said at a press conference in
Frankfurt today.  Crude inventories dropped 7.2 million barrels last week to
359.3 million, the lowest since the period ended March 23, the
API data show. U.S. gasoline stockpiles dropped 2.3 million
barrels last week, according to the API. Supplies are  forecast
to fall  3 million barrels in the Energy Department report,
according to the median estimate of 12 analysts surveyed by
 Bloomberg News .  Distillate inventories, a category that includes heating
oil and diesel, declined 132,000 barrels, the API said. A median
1.55 million-barrel decrease is projected in the Energy
Department report, the survey showed.  The Energy Department data are scheduled for release at 11
a.m. Washington time.  About 680,749 barrels a day of oil, or 49 percent of
production, were curtailed in the  Gulf of Mexico  as of 12:30
p.m. East Coast time yesterday, down from 710,866 barrels, the
Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement said on its
 website . About 26 percent of natural-gas output was shut in.  U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said in
 Jackson Hole ,  Wyoming , last week he wouldn’t rule out more
stimulus to revive growth. Payrolls increased at a slower pace
in August and unemployment exceeded 8 percent for a 43rd month,
according to economist forecasts before a Labor Department
report tomorrow.  To contact the reporter on this story:
