The words "modern  India " are used today to describe a vast nation-state of more than a billion people, but they also imply a particular trajectory of history. They refer to an ancient, ethnically and culturally diverse civilization that was colonized from the 18th century onward, that developed a native intelligentsia that eventually deployed against British colonialism ideas of nationhood and liberty adapted from thought currents in the West, and that in 1947 won independence and became a nation-state ambitiously committed to democracy and secularism. But if much has been gained by the ascent, over three centuries, of modern political ideals and global thought-systems in India, much, too, about the precolonial Indian past has become obscure, or entirely fallen from view. In the new beginnings either forced upon the country in recent centuries or else self-consciously fashioned at home, these older knowledge-systems seem to have no place. To put it another way, in the 21st century's speeded-up time and vast platter of choices, the past seems to have become shorter. What might we do to prevent ourselves from completely becoming the prisoners of our own categories of time and place? The Indian intellectual  D.R. Nagaraj , a dazzling and eclectic thinker who taught briefly at the  University of Chicago  in the 1990s before he died tragically young at the age of 44, is best-known for his  book of essays  on  Mahatma Gandhi  and B.R. Ambedkar, two intellectual titans of the 20th century who often took opposing positions on the great issues of their day, such as the caste system and untouchability. Nagaraj was also possessed by a desire not just to see the Indian past through the lenses of the present, but also to turn history around and inspect the present through the lenses of the past. “If the methods and philosophical positions of present times are fit and useful to analyse the formulations of several kinds of pre-modern eras, the reverse should also be true,” he writes. Genuinely bilingual -- he wrote in both Kannada, one of the major languages of the Indian south, and in English -- he possessed the resources to carry this project through. Many of Nagaraj's ideas about how the dozens of distant Indian pasts could be brought to bear productively upon the present have just become available in a posthumously published book of essays, put together by his friends, colleagues and students, called " Listening To The Loom ." Although the book is often difficult going, reading it is like being taken on a whirlwind tour of Indian intellectual history, the kind of journey that nobody seriously interested in India should deny himself. I stayed up late into the night with it for several days, stimulated by the contact with a mind that seemed to be living in several centuries at the same time. The effect of reading Nagaraj has been described very well by the  Indian historian Ananya Vajpeyi , who was briefly his student at Chicago: I don't know about you, but I'd certainly like to know what it's like to be a  Mimansaka  or an  Advaitin . Nagaraj’s painstaking and perceptive editor, Prithvi Datta Chandra Shobhi, who teaches at  San Francisco State University , compares Nagaraj to the ancient Indian  pauranika : “the storyteller who organises the knowledge and wisdom of a culture,” and guards against the slide into intellectual amnesia. But what exactly did Nagaraj think Indians were losing sight of? For Nagaraj, as for several other prominent modern Indian thinkers working in different modes (whether  Jawaharlal Nehru  in his book "The Discovery of India," or the framers of the Indian Constitution) the first fact of Indian history was its pluralism, its diversity of viewpoints and knowledge systems -- some exceedingly arcane, but nevertheless philosophically rigorous and linguistically rich -- humming in dialogue or tension with one another. This history meant that no one religion, ethnic group or language  could enjoy a specially privileged place in the new nation . But at the same time, the modern nation-state, with its vast hunger for centralization and homogenization, invariably tilts toward a public sphere composed of majorities and minorities, insiders and outsiders, us and them -- or what Nagaraj calls “identity narratives of the religious-nationalist kind.” Almost every nation-state that has emerged from the shadow of colonialism continues to wrestle with this problem. This majoritarian tendency is seen in modern India in the right-wing Hindu project that wishes to pummel Hinduism into a unified field and to represent minorities (Muslims, tribal members, agitating lower-caste groups) as misguided, unpatriotic or aberrant. (Both aspects of this tendency can be found in  a rant by the Indian politician Subramanian Swamy  last year.) Nagaraj’s brief, trenchant critique of the Hindu right-wing movement’s use of the figure of Rama -- the hero of the ancient Indian epic  the Ramayana  -- as a symbol will have to serve here as a representative instance of his own method. The movement  reached its apotheosis  in 1992, when Hindu agitators destroyed a mosque, the Babri Masjid, in the northern town of Ayodhya, since the site was considered the birthplace of the historical Rama. (An excellent eyewitness account of the sacking of the Babri Masjid and a meditation on its fallout in Indian life can be found in " Inhaling The Mahatma ," by the Australian foreign correspondent Christopher Kremmer.") But this fixing of Rama in both history and geography, argues Nagaraj, elides the hundreds of other “sightings” of Ram and the other major protagonists of the Ramayana reported in legends across India. The power of Rama in Indian history, as expressed in its art and its legends, was that he was not “there,” speaking from remote Ayodhya, but always “here,” somewhere close to home. (Diana Eck’s magisterial recent book " India: A Sacred Geography " illuminates Hinduism’s persistent instinct for duplication of global stories in local contexts). But with Hindu nationalism, says Nagaraj, “history and faith are being made to share the same bed” -- somewhat like with creationism in America. What might be an antidote to such divisive readings of the Ramayana? For Nagaraj, the answer lay in not just a scolding based on the ideals of the Indian Constitution (a point of view that sounds patronizing to many right-wing Hindus), but in turning instead to the many “folk” Ramayanas of India, which often poke fun at the central characters of the epic, and see their stories as aesthetically malleable structures to be continuously reinterpreted. For Nagaraj, “the recovery of difference is an effective way of overcoming those threats posed by the essentialist use of symbols.” The  pluralism of the Indian Constitution  might be seen as just the codification, in the modern language of rights, secularism and democracy, of the natural pluralism of Indian history. In a  tribute to Nagaraj  shortly after his death, the scholars Sheldon Pollock and Carol Appadurai Breckinbridge offered an assessment of the range of his intellectual gifts and of the diverse, and sometimes disquieting, life experiences he brought to his work. Just as  Charles Dickens  as a boy had done time in a blacking factory, so, too, had Nagaraj, born in a notionally free India, spent some time weaving in bonded labor as a boy. Pollock and Breckinbridge wrote: To put it another way, while many prominent modern Indian thinkers have sought to expand Indian pluralism from above, in dialogue with ideas from the West, Nagaraj sought to expand it from below by sifting through the best native traditions and recovering their vocabulary and concepts. The  Clay Sanskrit Library  (now the Murty Classical Library), an ambitious new Indic publishing project  aiming  "to make available the great literary works of India from the past two millennia in scholarly yet accessible translations," would have excited Nagaraj greatly as just the kind of gateway to the past that he tried to supply in his essays. One of the things that we most closely associate with the condition of being modern is the range of choices guaranteed to us in relationships, vocations and  consumer goods . Through a book like "Listening To The Loom," we see that we also are given an unprecedented ability to transcend our historical moment and inhabit the pasts from which our world has emerged.
