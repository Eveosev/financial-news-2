Guatemala’s credit outlook was
raised by  Standard & Poor’s  on the country’s economic growth
prospects and increased revenue that will help narrow the  budget
deficit .  The outlook on Central America’s largest economy was raised
to stable from negative on expectations the government will
reduce fiscal deficits to about 2.5 percent of gross domestic
product from 3 percent over the next three years, S&P said in a
statement today. New tax legislation and improved economic
growth prospects will help the government improve on low revenue
and high infrastructure and security needs, according to the
statement.  “The expected improvement in economic growth and fiscal
revenues should diminish the downside risks for Guatemala at the
current rating level,” analyst Sebastian Briozzo wrote in the
report.  Guatemala is rated ‘BB’ by S&P, two levels below investment
grade and in the same category as Portugal and Turkey. The
economy expanded 3.4 percent in the first quarter, up from 3.3
percent in the final three months of 2011, the central bank
said.  Guatemala’s 10-year dollar bonds, the country’s first
global notes since 2004, have returned 14 percent since they
were sold on May 31.  To contact the reporter on this story:
