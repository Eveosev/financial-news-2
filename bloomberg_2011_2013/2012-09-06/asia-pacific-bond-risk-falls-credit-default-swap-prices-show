The cost of insuring corporate and
sovereign bonds in the Asia-Pacific region from non-payment
declined, according to traders of credit-default swaps.  The  Markit iTraxx Asia  index of 40 investment-grade
borrowers outside Japan dropped 2 basis points to 149 as of 8:21
a.m. in  Hong Kong ,  Credit Agricole SA (ACA)  prices show. The gauge is
headed for its first weekly decline since the five days ending
Aug. 10, according to data provider CMA. It ended last week at
153 basis points, CMA prices show.  The  Markit iTraxx Australia  index fell 3.5 basis points to
164.5 as of 10:14 a.m. in Sydney, according to  Westpac Banking
Corp. (WBC)  The index, which has ranged from 128 to 211 basis points
this year, is set for its lowest close since Aug. 29, according
to CMA, which is owned by McGraw-Hill Cos. and compiles prices
quoted by dealers in the privately negotiated market.  The  Markit iTraxx Japan  index declined 1 basis point to 210
as of 9:13 a.m. in  Tokyo , Citigroup Inc. prices show. The
measure is about seven basis points below a peak this year of
217 on May 18, CMA data show.  Credit-default swap indexes are benchmarks for protecting
bonds against default and traders use them to speculate on
 credit quality . A drop signals improving perceptions of
creditworthiness, while an increase suggests the opposite.  The swap contracts pay the buyer face value in exchange for
the underlying securities if a borrower fails to meet its debt
agreements. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  To contact the reporter on this story:
