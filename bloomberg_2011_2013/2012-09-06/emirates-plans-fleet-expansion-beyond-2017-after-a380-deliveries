Emirates, the world’s biggest
airline by international passenger traffic, is working on a plan
to expand its fleet after an order of 90 A380 aircraft from
 Airbus SAS (EAD)  are delivered by 2017.  “We have potential to get more aircraft and are working on
it,” Adel Al Redha, executive vice president for engineering
and operations, said in an interview at an airshow at Istanbul’s
Ataturk airport today. “But this largely depends on airport
capacities, especially the capacity in Dubai airport.”  Dubai-based Emirates, which has 179 planes in its fleet
including 4 freight aircraft, has 23 A380s.  “We will have three more deliveries in September, one in
November and four in December,” Al Redha said. “Soon we’ll be
the airline company that has the most wide-body aircraft in its
fleet.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
