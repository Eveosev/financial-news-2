 Andy Ji, Singapore-based strategist
at  Commonwealth Bank of Australia (CBA) , comments on the impact of
expected stimulus measures from the  European Central Bank  on the
Indian rupee.  “The market has priced in, by various degrees, policy
support not only from ECB but also the Fed. We expect more
subdued impact if the Fed goes ahead with additional
quantitative easing and ECB’s actions will probably be more
restricted to the broad euro direction.  ‘‘Thus, the rupee could get a small lift but the
contentious issue remains domestic conditions, namely growth and
inflation outlook. At this point of time, the dichotomy between
faltering growth and elevated inflation has not really shifted
much, which will continue to cloud the rupee’s outlook.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
