Italian Prime Minister  Mario Monti 
said northern European leaders have gone too far disparaging
southern countries and proposed a code of conduct to muzzle
divisive rhetoric throughout the region.  “We may have to talk directly in the European Council to
consider whether we should come up with a code of conduct for
public remarks by the people who love to call themselves
European leaders,” Monti said today in a speech in Fiesole,
Italy. He compared the euro to the crowning ornament on a gothic
cathedral and said derisive commentary, like insults traded in
the German and Greek press, threatens to destroy it.  Monti followed  Germany ’s  Angela Merkel  and Finland’s Jyrki Katainen in singling out politicians’ rhetoric for deepening the
region’s financial crisis. He wants leaders to show cohesion.
Monti, a former European Union commissioner and university
president, challenged Italian politicians to monitor their
rhetoric and warned lawmakers from northern  Europe  not to slight
their southern counterparts.  “It’s a rather dangerous posture,” Monti said. The
Italian premier is going beyond heads of government and talking
directly with legislators, “above all with lawmakers from those
countries that are probably very virtuous themselves, but that
are convincing themselves they’re the exclusive holders of
virtue,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
