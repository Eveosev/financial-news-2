Erste Group Bank AG (EBS) , eastern
 Europe â€™s second-biggest lender, made a buyout offer for a
minority stake in its Romanian unit as its seeks to gain full
control of the bank,  Mediafax  reported.  The Vienna-based lender, which increased its holding in the
Banca Comerciala Romana SA to 93.27 percent this year, wants to
pay about 22 million lei ($6 million) for a 0.14 percent stake
in the bank through an offer valid until Oct. 26, Mediafax said
today, citing a letter sent to minority shareholders. Erste is
paying 0.92 lei for each BCR share, as the offer excludes an
investment fund,  SIF Oltenia SA (SIF5) , which has a 6.59 percent stake
in BCR.  Erste bought the minority stakes of four investment funds
in BCR as part of a separate offer launched last year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
