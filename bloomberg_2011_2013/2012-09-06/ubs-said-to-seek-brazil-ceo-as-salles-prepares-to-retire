UBS AG (UBSN) , Switzerland’s biggest bank,
is seeking a chief executive officer for its Brazil unit as
Lywal Salles prepares to retire, according to two people with
direct knowledge of the plans.  Salles was hired in October 2010 under a two-year contract 
to build a local subsidiary for the Zurich-based bank, said the 
people, who asked not to be identified because the matter is 
private. UBS decided to establish a Brazil unit after selling 
Banco Pactual SA in April 2010 for $2.5 billion to  Andre Esteves  and his partners, who created Banco BTG Pactual SA.  UBS declined to comment, said an official who asked not to
be named in accordance with company policy.  The lender, after waiting almost two years, is close to
obtaining a banking license in Brazil, the people said. The
firm, which had considered buying a local bank for authorization
to operate in the South American nation, instead acquired some
assets from a small bank, one of the people said.  Salles, before joining UBS, was chairman of Banco Itau
Holding Financeira SA’s private-banking units. He previously led
Itau Private Bank and held positions at New York-based  Citigroup
Inc. (C) , including as regional director in Latin America for high
net worth clients.  To contact the reporters on this story:
