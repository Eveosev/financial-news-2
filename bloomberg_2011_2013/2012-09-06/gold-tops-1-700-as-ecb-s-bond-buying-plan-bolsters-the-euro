Gold futures rose to the highest
since March as European Central Bank President  Mario Draghi  said
policy makers agreed to an unlimited bond-purchase program to
help stabilize the region, boosting demand for the metal as a
store of value.  Draghi said the ECB will have a “fully effective backstop
to avoid destructive scenarios with potentially severe
challenges for  price stability  in the euro area.” U.S. jobless
claims declined last week and companies added more workers than
forecast in August, reports showed today before monthly payrolls
data tomorrow. In August, gold jumped 4.5 percent, the most
since January, on speculation that the  Federal Reserve  and the
ECB will increase steps to bolster their economies.  “Expectations of inflation rising after Draghi’s
statements are supporting gold,”   Adam Klopfenstein , a market
strategist at Archer Financial Services Inc. in Chicago, said in
a telephone interview. “Tomorrow’s jobs data will be crucial as
that will be one of the leading indicators about the health of
the economy.”  Gold futures for December delivery gained 0.6 percent to
$1,703.50 an ounce at 9:59 a.m. on the Comex in New York, after
earlier jumping to $1,716.90, the highest for a most-active
contract since March 12.  Gold will be at $1,840 by the end of 2012,  Jeffrey Currie ,
head of commodities research at Goldman Sachs Group Inc., said
in a Bloomberg Television interview today.  Silver futures for December delivery advanced 0.9 percent
to $32.62 an ounce in New York, after climbing to $33.04, the
highest since April 3.  To contact the reporter on this story:
