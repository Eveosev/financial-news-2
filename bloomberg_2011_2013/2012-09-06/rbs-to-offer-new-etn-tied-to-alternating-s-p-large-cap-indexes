Royal Bank of Scotland  Group Plc,
Britain’s biggest government-owned lender, is offering an
exchange-traded note tied to three Standard & Poor’s indexes.  RBS U.S. Large Cap Alternator Exchange Traded Notes, which
will start trading today under the ticker ALTL on the  New York 
Stock Exchange’s Arca platform, track an index of the same name,
according to a  prospectus  filed with the U.S. Securities and
Exchange Commission. The index follows either the S&P 500 Total
Return Index, the S&P 500 Low Volatility Total Return Index, or
the S&P 500 Equal Weight Total Return Index, depending on which
has been the best performer.  RBS issued one other exchange-traded note this year, its
China Trendpilot ETN, on April 19. The note tracks an index of
Chinese depositary receipts listed on the NYSE, NYSE Amex, and
Nasdaq exchanges, according to a  prospectus  filed with the SEC.
When the index performance falls below a 100-day moving average,
the note follows the yield of three-month U.S. Treasury bills.  Ed Canaday , an RBS spokesman, declined to comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
