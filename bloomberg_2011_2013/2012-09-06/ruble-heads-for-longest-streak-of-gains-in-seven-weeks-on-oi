The ruble headed for its longest
streak of gains against the dollar in seven weeks as oil rose
before the  European Central Bank  meets today to decide on its
bond-buying plan.  The ruble advanced 0.3 percent to 32.1849 at 10:38 a.m. in
Moscow.  Russia ’s currency was 0.2 percent stronger versus the
euro at 40.6250 and climbed 0.3 percent against the central
bank’s target euro-dollar basket.  Crude, Russia’s biggest export earner, gained 0.7 percent
to $96.06 a barrel in  New York . ECB President  Mario Draghi ’s
bond-buying proposal involves unlimited purchases of government
debt that will be sterilized to assuage concerns about printing
money, two central bank officials briefed on the plan said. The
ECB’s Governing Council will decide today on bond-buying plans.  Investors pared bets the ruble will weaken further, with
non-deliverable forwards showing the ruble at 32.6509 per dollar
in three months.  The extra yield investors demand to own Russia’s dollar
bonds over U.S. Treasuries fell one basis point to 216,
according to JPMorgan Chase & Co.’s EMBI Global Index. An index
of five-year government bond yields compiled by the Micex fell
10 basis points to 7.5 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
