The worst Midwest drought in 56
years has “significantly lowered” expectations for farm income
in the third quarter, the St. Louis Federal Reserve Bank said.  Lenders in a new quarterly agricultural finance survey
project lower third-quarter farm income and  capital expenditures 
compared with the same period a year earlier, according to a
 statement  on the St. Louis Fed website. Land values were
projected to stay steady or rise over the next three months, the
statement said.  The survey was conducted from June 15 through June 29 and
based on the response of 88 agricultural banks within the
boundaries of the eighth federal reserve district, which
includes Arkansas and portions of Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky,
 Mississippi , Missouri and Tennessee, the statement said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
