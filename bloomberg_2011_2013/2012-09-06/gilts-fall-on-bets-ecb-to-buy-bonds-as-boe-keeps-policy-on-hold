U.K. 10-year government bonds fell
for a second day as the  European Central Bank  unveiled a bond-
buying program to stem the euro-region’s debt crisis, damping
demand for the safest assets.  Ten-year gilt yields rose to the highest level in two weeks
after the  Bank of England  refrained from extending its bond-
purchase stimulus measures and held its key  interest rate  at a
record low. ECB President  Mario Draghi  said policy makers agreed
to buy unlimited amounts of government debt to regain control of
borrowing costs in the euro area and fight speculation of a
currency breakup. The pound advanced to the highest level in
over three months against the dollar.  Gilts are lower as “Draghi has gone about as far as we
could have expected and there’s generally a more buoyant tone
for risk,” said  Sam Hill , a fixed-income strategist at  Royal
Bank of Canada  in  London .  The yield on 10-year gilts rose six basis points, or 0.06
percentage point, to 1.71 percent at 4:21 p.m. London time,
after climbing to 1.72 percent, the highest since Aug. 20. The
1.75 percent bond due September 2022 fell 0.585, or 5.85 pounds
per 1,000-pound ($1,593) face amount, to 100.39.  Gilts have returned 4 percent this year through yesterday,
according to indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the European
Federation of Financial Analysts Societies. German bunds gained
3.3 percent and U.S. Treasuries earned 2.5 percent.  Expanding Stimulus  The Bank of England’s Monetary Policy Committee kept its
bond-purchase  target  at 375 billion pounds, as forecast by 38 of
39 economists in a Bloomberg News survey. A separate survey
shows economists see the MPC expanding stimulus to 400 billion
pounds by the end of 2012. Policy makers led by Governor  Mervyn King  left the benchmark  interest rate  at 0.5 percent, as
predicted by all 51 economists surveyed.  The ECB held its benchmark interest rate at 0.75 percent.  The pound rose 0.2 percent to $1.5929 after touching
$1.5943, the highest level since May 16. Sterling was little
changed versus the euro at 79.27 pence. It dropped to 79.56
pence on Aug. 31, the weakest since Aug. 7.  “We expect U.K. activity to remain soft and for the MPC to
conclude at the November meeting that more stimulus is
required,”  David Tinsley , an economist at BNP Paribas SA in
London, wrote in an e-mailed note.  Policy makers last increased asset purchases by 50 billion
pounds in July and began a facility with the government -- the
Funding for Lending Scheme -- to boost credit to companies and
households.  The pound has gained 1.7 percent in the past month,
according to Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes, which track
10 developed-market currencies. The dollar fell 0.6 percent and
the euro rose 1.5 percent.  Gross domestic product in Britain will shrink 0.7 percent
this year instead of the previously predicted expansion of 0.5
percent, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and
Development said today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
