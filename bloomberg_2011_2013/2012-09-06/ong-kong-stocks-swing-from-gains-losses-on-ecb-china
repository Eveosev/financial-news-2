Hong Kong   stocks  swung between gains
and losses as investors await a European Central Bank
announcement on its bond-buying program today, and amid signs
 China ’s economic slowdown is deepening.  Esprit Holdings Ltd. (330) , a clothier that counts  Europe  as its
largest market, rose 2.2 percent. CSR Corp., a Chinese train
maker, jumped 8.8 percent, pacing gains among rail companies
after the government approved subway projects. Brilliance China
Automotive Holdings Ltd., a partner of Bayerische Motoren Werke
AG, slumped 8.7 percent after saying its controlling shareholder
will sell a stake in the company.  The Hang Seng Index was little changed at 19,147.64 as of
1:44 p.m. local time, after rising as much as 0.3 percent and
dropping 0.4 percent. About the same number of stocks rose as
fell in the 49-member gauge. Volume was 15 percent above its 30-
day average for the time of day. The Hang Seng China Enterprises
Index of mainland companies climbed at 9,038.12.  “The market is waiting for more news to come out from the
ECB meeting,” said Linus Yip, a Hong-based strategist at First
Shanghai Securities. “The consensus is that the ECB will try to
buy bonds, what matters is the amount. In China, there are talks
about another hard landing. The economy is slowing, but there
are a lot of tools the government can use to stabilize the
economy.”  The  Hang Seng Index (HSI)   traded  at 10.2 times estimated earnings
on average yesterday, compared with 9.3 for the Shanghai
Composite Index and 13.6 for the  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index. (SPXL1) 
The Hong Kong gauge dropped 5.7 percent, or more than 1,000
points, from its recent high on Aug. 14 through yesterday.
Shares slid amid concern demand will slow as economic reports
signaled weakness in the global economy.  U.S. Futures  “Technical indicators are showing Hong Kong stocks are
being oversold,” Yip said.  Futures on the  S&P 500  rose 0.2 percent today. The index
fell 0.1 percent in  New York  yesterday as London-based Markit
Economics said euro-area services and manufacturing contracted
more than initially estimated in August.  ECB President  Mario Draghi ’s bond-buying proposal involves
unlimited purchases of government debt that will be sterilized
to assuage concerns about printing money, two central bank
officials briefed on the plan said. Draghi will hold a press
conference after the ECB announces its interest-rate decision
later today.  Esprit gained 2.2 percent to HK$12.26, while  Cosco Pacific
Ltd. (1199) , a shipping company which operates a port terminal in
 Greece , advanced 2 percent to HK$9.75.  China Growth  In China, the government said yesterday that industrial
output will expand by about 10 percent this year, lowering its
sights from an 11 percent goal given in December after weaker-
than-anticipated domestic and overseas demand. Separately,
Goldman Sachs Group Inc. cut its estimate for China’s 2012 gross
domestic product growth to 7.6 percent from 7.9 percent and
reduced its 2013 forecast to 8 percent from 8.5 percent.  CSR rose 8.8 percent to HK$5.20.  China Railway Group Ltd. (390) ,
the nation’s largest construction company by total assets,
climbed 7.4 percent to HK$3.18 while China Railway Construction
Corp. increased 6.5 percent to HK$6.39.  China’s National Development and Reform Commission approved
plans for subways in 18 cities including Suzhou, Hangzhou,
Guangzhou, Tianjin and Shenzhen, the agency said on its website
yesterday.  ‘Meaningful Impact’  “Beijing is stepping up efforts to speed up infrastructure
investment,” HSBC economists Hongbin Qu and Junwei Sun wrote in
a report dated today. “This has a meaningful impact on growth,
though the form of easing is of a relatively low profile. Once
started, these projects are likely to filter through the economy
quickly, given the strong track record of previous large
stimulus packages.”  Brilliance China (1114)  slumped 8.7 percent to HK$6.89 after
resuming trading today. The company’s controlling shareholder
Huachen Automotive Group Holdings Co. will sell 125 million
stake in the company at HK$7.17 each, a discount to yesterday’s
closing price of HK$7.55, Brilliance said in a statement to the
city’s stock exchange.  Futures on the Hang Seng Index climbed 0.2 percent to
19,098. The  HSI Volatility Index (VHSI)  declined 1.2 percent to 20.47,
indicating traders expect a swing of 5.9 percent for the equity
benchmark in the next 30 days.  To contact the reporter on this story:
