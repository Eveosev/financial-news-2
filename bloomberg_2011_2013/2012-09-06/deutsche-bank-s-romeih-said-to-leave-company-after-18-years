Saleh Romeih, head of central and
eastern Europe,  Middle East  and Africa at  Deutsche Bank AG (DBK) ’s
capital markets and treasury solutions unit, has left the bank
after 18 years, according to an internal memo.  Romeih will be replaced by Nizar Al-Bassam, head of markets
sales and coverage for the region, according to the memo,
obtained by Bloomberg News. An official for Frankfurt-based
Deutsche Bank declined to comment, as did Romeih when reached by
