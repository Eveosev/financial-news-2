The  Swiss franc  fell against the
euro to the weakest level in a month amid speculation the
central bank will shift its cap on the  exchange rate  to
depreciate the currency.  The franc slid as much as 0.2 percent to 1.2058 per euro,
the weakest since Aug. 6, and was at 1.2052 per euro at 6:24
a.m. London time. It was little changed at 95.65 centimes per
 U.S. dollar . The Swiss National Bank set its limit for the franc
at 1.20 per euro a year ago to protect the nation’s economy.  “With continued weak activity and inflation data,
speculation has been rife in the last 24 hours of a lift in the
floor to around 1.22,” francs per euro,  Sue Trinh , a senior
currency strategist at Royal Bank of Canada in Hong Kong, wrote
in a note to clients today. The franc is “vulnerable to a
selloff back to 1.201 should the rumors, speculation prove
unfounded,” she wrote.  SNB spokesman Walter Meier declined to comment when called
by Bloomberg News.  To contact the reporter on this story:
