China Three Gorges Corp. said water
levels at the world’s biggest hydropower dam are falling faster
than expected after flows from upstream on the  Yangtze River 
this month were 40 percent less than in the previous three years.  The water level behind the Three Gorges dam may fall to
less than 155 meters after releasing water at a rate of 7,000
cubic meters per second to ease a drought downstream, the
operator of the hydropower station said in a  statement  on its
website. The government last year estimated water levels at the
dam would reach 155 meters by May 25, according to the statement.  Falling water levels will cut Three Gorges’s power
generating capacity and hurt profitability at its listed unit,
China Yangtze Power Co., said Capital Securities Corp. analyst
Lai Shensheng. When the water level is 140 meters to 175 meters,
the listed company’s profit may be reduced by 0.01 yuan for
every 10 meters the level drops, Lai said. Effects become
greater when water levels are below 140 meters, he said.  China  Three Gorges’s plans to expand generating capacity
through 2012 will mean that falling water levels this year won’t
have a “very big” impact on Yangtze Power’s shares, Lai said
by telephone today. He recommends buying the stock.  Yangtze Power shares rose 0.7 percent at the close of
trading in  Shanghai , moderating from earlier gains of as much as
1.6 percent. China’s benchmark Shanghai Composite Index
increased 0.3 percent.  --Penny Peng. Editor:  John Liu   To contact Bloomberg News Staff for this story:
