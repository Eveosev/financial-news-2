Taiwan , which imports more than 99
percent of its crude oil needs, reduced purchases of the fuel
last month after a refiner shut a plant for maintenance.  Shipments fell 20 percent from a year earlier to 22.5
million barrels, the  Ministry of Finance  said in Taipei today.
The island’s April oil bill increased 15 percent to $2.57
billion, the ministry said in a statement.  Formosa Petrochemical Corp. (6505) , Taiwan’s only publicly traded
oil refiner, closed its No. 1 crude distillation unit on March
13 for scheduled maintenance, Lin Keh-yen, a company spokesman,
said by phone on March 14. The refiner planned to close the
plant for about 40 days, he said. Crude distillation units heat
the fuel and separate it into oil products.  To contact the reporters on this story:
