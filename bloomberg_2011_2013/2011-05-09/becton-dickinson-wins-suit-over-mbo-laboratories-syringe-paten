Becton, Dickinson & Co., the maker of
disposable medical supplies, won a U.S. court ruling that it
doesn’t infringe a MBO Laboratories Inc. patent for syringes
designed to protect against accidental needle sticks.  Becton Dickinson’s SafetyGlide devices works differently
than what is covered by the MBO patent, U.S. District Judge
Richard Stearns in  Boston  ruled May 6, ending the case.  Becton Dickinson and closely held MBO have been fighting
over the patent since 2003. A federal appeals court last year
upheld a ruling that part of the MBO patent was invalid, while
remanding the rest of the dispute for review.  Colleen White, a spokeswoman for  Franklin Lakes , New
Jersey-based Becton Dickinson, said the company was pleased with
the decision.  The case is MBO Laboratories Inc. v. Becton, Dickinson &
Co., 03cv10038, U.S. District Court for the District of
 Massachusetts  (Boston).  To contact the reporter on this story:
