Mitsui Mining & Smelting Co., Japan’s
largest zinc producer, said profit may drop 17 percent this
fiscal year after the March 11 earthquake and tsunami damaged
facilities, disrupted supplies and cut power.  Net income may fall to 17.5 billion yen ($217 million) in
the year started April 1 and sales may increase 4.6 percent to
467 billion yen, the Tokyo-based company said in a  statement .
Profit in the year ended March 31 rose 52 percent to 21.2
billion with sales gaining 13.8 percent to 446 billion, it said.  The company attributed the last fiscal year’s profit
increase to a rise in demand for auto parts and electronics as
well as price gains in zinc and lead. Zinc for immediate
delivery rose to an average of $2,187 a metric ton in the period
from the previous year’s average of $1,934, while lead gained to
$2,210 a ton from $1,985, according to the company’s data.  Mitsui Mining posted a total of 3.2 billion yen in special
losses last year because of the natural disaster, it said. The
company said April 11 it planned to restart its Hachinohe
smelter in Aomori prefecture, northern  Japan , in early June. The
plant has a capacity of 112,000 tons of zinc a year, the company
has said.  The company has been running its other two smelters --
Kamioka in Gifu prefecture and Hikoshima in Yamaguchi
prefecture, west of  Tokyo  -- at full capacity. Kamioka has
annual capacity of 67,000 tons a year and Hikoshima produces
74,000 tons of special high-grade zinc.  Mitsui Mining, also maker of an estimated 90 percent of the
world’s copper foil used in smartphones, plans to move some
production of copper foil overseas because of the uncertainty
over power supplies, said Keiji Nishida, general manager of the
company’s finance team. It produces 4,250 tons of copper foil a
month, according to spokesman Takayasu Ogisu.  To contact the reporters on this story:
