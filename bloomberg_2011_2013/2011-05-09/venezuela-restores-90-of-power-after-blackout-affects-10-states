Venezuela  has restored 90 percent of
power knocked out by a blackout today that hit 10 states in the
western part of the South American nation.  Two separate transmission failures took about 3,000
megawatts of capacity offline, and the states of Tachira,
Merida, Trujillo and Barinas were "totally" affected by the
blackout, Igor Gavidia, head of power transmission at the
Electricity Ministry, said today on state television.  “We’re working to bring stability to the system,” Gavidia
said. “Everything is practically resolved.”  A helicopter was dispatched to collect more information on
the cause of the blackout that also affected the states of
Zulia, Yaracuy, Portuguesa, Cojedes and Lara, Gavidia said. The
Paris-based  International Energy Agency  said last month that
increasing blackouts in Venezuela may cause oil output to
decline. A blackout on April 7 struck the capital of Caracas and
15 states.  Venezuela’s largest refining center, the Paraguana complex
in Falcon state, was not affected by the blackout today, an
official for state oil company Petroleos de Venezuela SA, who
isn’t authorized to speak publicly, said by telephone.  To contact the reporter on this story:
