German stocks rose following a report
that showed business confidence in the country remained
unexpectedly unchanged in May as booming exports and higher
company spending boosted economic growth.  K+S AG climbed after Financial Times Deutschland said the
company’s fertilizer unit has two bidders left. ThyssenKrupp AG
and  Salzgitter AG (SZG) , Germany’s largest steelmakers, gained as
metal prices rallied in  London .  Bayerische Motoren Werke AG (BMW)  and
 Volkswagen AG (VOW)  led carmakers higher.  The benchmark DAX Index increased 0.4 percent to 7,150.66
at the 5:30 p.m. close in Frankfurt, the first advance in three
days and bringing this year’s gain to 3.4 percent. The broader
HDAX Index also rose 0.4 percent today.  “Business confidence data gave the market some support and
there are signs the Greek government is doing something to
reduce its deficit,” said Andreas Lipkow, an equity trader at
MWB Fairtrade Wertpapierhandelsbank AG in Frankfurt. “We can
reach 7,300 in the DAX.”  The Ifo institute in Munich said its business climate
index, based on a survey of 7,000 executives, held at 114.2 from
April. Economists forecast a decline to 113.7, the median of 24
forecasts in a Bloomberg News survey showed.  The Greek government endorsed an accelerated asset-sale
plan and 6 billion euros ($8.4 billion) of budget cuts to win
extra aid and stem a market slide that threatens to swamp the
most debt-laden euro-area nations.  Steelmakers Climb  K+S jumped 2.6 percent to 53.27 euros, the biggest advance
in three weeks. The Compo consumer fertilizer unit may go to one
of the two investors still bidding, of which one probably is
Triton, FTD said, without citing anyone. K+S wants 200 million
euros for the business, which this year targets sales of 450
million euros and earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation
and amortization of 30 million euros, the newspaper said.  ThyssenKrupp,  Germany ’s largest steelmaker, advanced 1.2
percent to 32.46 euros, while Salzgitter, the second biggest,
gained 0.8 percent to 50.24 euros. Aluminum, copper, lead,
nickel, tin and zinc all rose on the London Metal Exchange.
Commodities rebounded from the biggest drop in almost two weeks
after Goldman Sachs Group Inc. said it’s turning “more
bullish” on raw materials.  BMW, the world’s largest maker of luxury cars, rallied 1.9
percent to 60.28 euros, while Volkswagen,  Europe ’s biggest
carmaker, added 1.5 percent to 122.55 euros. Automotive shares
were among the best performers in the Stoxx Europe 600 Index
today, rising 1.5 percent as a group.  To contact the reporter on this story:
