Acciona SA (ANA)  won a 45 million-euro ($65
million) contract to build and operate a desalination plant near
Chile’s Atacama desert, the driest place on Earth.  The coastal facility in the Copiapo valley will have the
capacity to turn about 17 million liters (4.5 million gallons)
of seawater into fresh water a day and is being built in the
mineral-rich region for the Chilean mining company  CAP SA (CAP) , the
company said in an e-mailed press release.  Madrid-based Acciona, which has 163 staff in Chile, has
built four wastewater plants in Latin America’s richest country.
It aims to win more desalination contracts as the country’s
mining industry expands, the company said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
