All banks in  Ivory Coast , including
local and foreign-owned lenders, will reopen today, according to
a statement by the Ivorian Professional Bankers’ Association
published in state-owned Fraternite Matin newspaper.  The  Western Union Co. (WU) , based in Englewood, Colorado,
restarted money-transfer services, it said in a separate
statement in the Abidjan-based newspaper.  Banks and other financial agencies closed their branches in
the world’s biggest cocoa grower during a four month-long
violent dispute over a November presidential election that eased
after the April 11 capture of ex-President  Laurent Gbagbo . Most
banks in Abidjan began to reopen last week.  To contact the reporter on this story:
