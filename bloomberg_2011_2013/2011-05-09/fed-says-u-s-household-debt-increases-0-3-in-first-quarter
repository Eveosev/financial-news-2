U.S. households expanded their debt
last quarter for the first time in more than two years as
mortgage balances rose, according to a survey by the  Federal
Reserve Bank of New York .  Consumer indebtedness rose 0.3 percent, or $33 billion, to
$11.5 trillion at the end of March from Dec. 31, according to a
quarterly report on  household debt  and credit released today.
Households have slashed debt by $1.03 trillion, or 8.2 percent,
since it peaked in the third quarter of 2008 as the financial
crisis was unfolding.  “We are beginning to see signs of credit markets healing
gradually and evidence of greater willingness of consumers to
borrow and banks to lend,” Andrew Haughwout, vice president and
New York Fed research economist, said in a statement today.  Consumer borrowing rose for a sixth straight month in
March, led by a gain in non-revolving credit, which includes
auto loans, and a pickup in credit-card use, the Fed said May 6
in a report from  Washington . Throughout the first quarter, banks
eased lending terms as they forecast improvement in the economy
and firms sought more loans, according to a Fed survey of senior
loan officers released May 2.  Delinquency rates declined for the fifth straight quarter,
with 10.5 percent of outstanding debt in “some stage of
delinquency,” down from 10.8 percent on Dec. 31, according to
the  New York Fed  survey released today. That’s also down from
11.9 percent a year earlier, the survey said.  New Bankruptcies  The amount of new bankruptcies fell 13.3 percent to
434,000, which was 6.4 percent below their level a year earlier,
according to the report.  About 368,000 consumers showed new foreclosures on their
credit reports in the first quarter, 17.7 percent less than in
the last three months of 2010, the survey showed.  Credit-card limits rose by about $30 billion, or 1 percent,
in the first increase since the third quarter of 2008. Credit
card balances declined by 4.6 percent.  Mortgage originations increased for the third straight
quarter to $499 billion, 65 percent more than their low at the
end of 2008, the survey showed.  The report is based on data compiled by the  New York  Fed’s
Consumer Credit Panel, a “nationally representative random
sample” from Equifax Inc. credit-report data, the statement
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
