Banco ABC Brasil, the Sao Paulo-based
bank part-owned by the Libyan government, headed to its biggest
advance in over a month after reporting first-quarter profit
growth.  Shares gained 5.4 percent to 12.60 reais at the close of
 Sao Paulo  trading at 4:15 p.m. New York time, the most since
March 31. The Bovespa index rose 0.3 percent to 64,621.97.  “This quarter was quite difficult for ABC, which had to
adopt a more conservative approach to growth due to fears that
events in Libya could affect funding capacity,” Bradesco
Corretora’s analysts including Carlos Firetti wrote in a note to
clients. “In light of the environment, we have a favorable view
on the results.”  Banco ABC Brasil reported first-quarter net income of 56.7
million reais ($35 million), a 20.8 percent increase from a year
earlier, according to a regulatory filing.  North Atlantic Treaty Organization-led forces are in the
midst of an air campaign over  Libya  against Muammar Qaddafi’s
forces in support of rebels battling the country’s leader.  Banco ABC’s shares tumbled 18.2 percent this year through
May 6, while the Bovespa index fell 7.1 percent in the same
period.  To contact the reporter on this story:
