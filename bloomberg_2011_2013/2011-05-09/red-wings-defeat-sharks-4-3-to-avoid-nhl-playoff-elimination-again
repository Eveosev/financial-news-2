The  Detroit   Red Wings  beat the  San

third-period goals as Detroit erased a 3-1 deficit at HP
Pavilion in San Jose,  California .  The Red Wings, who lost the first three games of the best-
of-seven second round series, now trail three-games-to-two.
Detroit will host Game 6 on May 10.   To contact the editor responsible for this story:
