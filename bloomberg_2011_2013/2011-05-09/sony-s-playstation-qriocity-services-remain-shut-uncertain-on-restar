Sony Corp. (6758) ’s PlayStation Network and
Qriocity online services remain shut as of today, Shigenori
Yoshida, a Tokyo-based spokesman said. Sony is uncertain when 
it can resume the services, Yoshida said by phone today.  The company is in the process of adopting an improved
security system and its plan to restart the services fully by
May 31 is unchanged, he said. Sony shut down the PlayStation
Network and Qriocity services April 20 because of possible  data
theft  by hackers.  The maker of PS consoles had planned to restart partial
operations within a week after boosting the level of security
system, the company said May 1.   To contact the reporter on this story:
