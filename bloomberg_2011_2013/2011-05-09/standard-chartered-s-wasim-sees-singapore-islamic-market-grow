Wasim Saifi, Singapore-based global
head of Islamic and consumer banking at  Standard Chartered Plc (STAN) ,
comments on the city-state’s development of Islamic finance in
an e-mailed response to questions.  Singapore  will host the second  World Islamic Banking
Conference (Asia Summit)  from June 8 to June 9.  On Singapore’s attempts to grow Islamic finance:  “With its role as a major financial centre, Singapore is
very well positioned to leverage its considerable talent to help
innovate Islamic  wealth management .  “I believe that once Islamic products are launched in
Singapore demand will be created, not only from the domestic
population but also from the substantial offshore business which
originates from Southeast Asia and  South Asia .  “However, the build-up of the business is likely to be
more gradual than in other Islamic markets in the region and
hence banks are probably evaluating whether the opportunity
justifies the investment.”  On the bank’s plans for Shariah-compliant products in Singapore:  “We’re currently focusing our efforts on the creation of
Islamic wealth management products which can be offered to our
customers in key Islamic markets of South and  Southeast Asia ,
and the Middle East.  “We are looking to see how we can work with partners who
already work closely with us in the conventional space, and we
can use their expertise combined with our Islamic structuring
capabilities and our substantial Islamic customer base across
several markets to help bridge the current product gaps in the
market.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
