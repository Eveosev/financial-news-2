Chile’s economy is growing “very
strongly” and probably will expand by more than 6 percent this
year, Finance Minister Felipe Larrain said in an interview with
state television station TVN.  While authorities will continue working on measures to
contain the Chilean peso’s gains, the currency is appreciating
against the dollar as part of a global trend, Larrain said.  Chile will need to develop more coal-fired power plants if
new hydroelectric dams aren’t built, he said, declining to
comment directly on the HidroAysen project in Patagonia.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
