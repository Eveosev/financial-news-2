A ship carrying as many as 600
migrants to  Italy  sank shortly after leaving the Libyan capital
Tripoli on May 6, killing at least 16 and leaving the rest
unaccounted for, the  United Nations  said today.  Somalia’s ambassador to  Libya  reported to the Geneva-based
UN refugee agency that the ship “broke up” close to the port
and that 16 bodies had washed ashore, including two babies.
Agency spokesman Sybella Wilkes said that while it is possible
that some migrants managed to swim to safety, there are no
reports of survivors.  Boats carrying 2,400 migrants fleeing the violence in Libya
arrived safely over the weekend at the Italian island of
Lampedusa, Wilkes said. At least three other ships that left
Libya since the conflict began in February never reached their
destination, and hundreds of people are feared dead, she said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
