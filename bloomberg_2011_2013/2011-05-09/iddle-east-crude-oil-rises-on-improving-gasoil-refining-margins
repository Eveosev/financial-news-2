Middle East crude oils for sale to
 Asia  ended a five-day decline as refining margins for gasoil
rose. Premiums for Qatar Marine crude fell.  Oman oil for immediate loading climbed $1.96, or 1.9
percent, to $106.04 a barrel, according to Bloomberg data. Dubai
for loading in June gained 1.8 percent to $105.56 and Murban
crude increased 1.8 percent to $110.40 a barrel.  Middle East crude has been supported by a surge in refining
profits for middle distillates including gasoil and kerosene.
Gasoilâ€™s premium to Dubai crude was at $19.70 a barrel, about 77
percent higher than a year earlier, according to data from PVM
Oil Associates Ltd., a London-based brokerage.  The premium for Qatar Marine, a grade rich in  fuel oil , was
4 cents lower at 11 cents a barrel, Bloomberg data showed.  The Brent-Dubai exchange for swaps for June widened 5 cents
to $6.25 a barrel, PVM data showed. The exchange for swaps for
July rose 9 cents to $6.30 a barrel.  Oman futures for July delivery increased $2.50 today to
$106.85 a barrel on the  Dubai Mercantile Exchange  at 4:33 p.m.
Singapore time, with 968 contracts traded. The settlement price
was at $106.51 at 12:30 p.m. in Dubai.  To contact the reporter on this story:
