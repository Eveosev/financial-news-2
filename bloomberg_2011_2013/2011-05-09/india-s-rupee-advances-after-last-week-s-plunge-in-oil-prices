India ’s rupee strengthened, snapping a
two-day decline, on speculation the biggest weekly drop in crude
prices in more than two years will reduce demand for dollars.  The local currency rose the most in a week after  oil prices 
fell by almost 15 percent in  New York  last week, the biggest
five-day decline since December 2008. India imports almost 75
percent of the crude it uses.  “Crude oil is always a big factor and its decline in such
a manner will always have a deep positive impact on the
currency,” said  Roy Paul , deputy general manager at Federal
Bank Ltd. in Mumbai. “I expect the rupee to hold on to gains
this week.”  The rupee advanced 0.3 percent to 44.65 a dollar as of 9:30
a.m. in Mumbai, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The
currency may rise to 44.55 this week, Paul said.  Crude for June delivery advanced 1.6 percent to $98.81 a
barrel in electronic trading on the  New York Mercantile Exchange .
The Bombay Stock Exchange’s Sensitive Index was little changed
after gaining 1.7 percent on May 6.  Offshore forwards indicate the rupee will trade at 45.37 to
the dollar in three months, compared with expectations of 45.44
at the end of last week. Forwards are agreements to buy or sell
assets at a set price and date. Non-deliverable contracts are
settled in dollars.  To contact the reporter on this story:
