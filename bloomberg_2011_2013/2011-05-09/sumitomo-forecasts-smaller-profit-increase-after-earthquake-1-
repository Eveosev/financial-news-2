Sumitomo Corp. (8053) , Japan’s third-largest
and most-indebted trading house, forecast a smaller profit
increase this year as gains in commodity prices slow and the
nation recovers from the March 11 earthquake.  Net income may rise 8.5 percent to 220 billion yen ($2.7
billion) in the year ending March 31, after jumping 31 percent
last year to 202.7 billion yen, the Tokyo-based company said
today in a  statement . Profit may advance 18 percent to 260
billion yen in the year ending March 31, 2013, Sumitomo said.  The slowdown comes as Sumitomo seeks to match new
investments with asset sales. The company, whose 3.2 trillion
yen of net debt is more than double its market value, plans to
sell 1.15 trillion yen of assets in the next two years and spend
the same amount in purchases and upgrades, according to the
statement.  “The effects of the earthquake, along with other factors,
mean that we will be operating in an uncertain economic
environment,” Sumitomo said, adding almost half of the spending
over the next two years will be in the resources, energy,
chemicals and metals industries.  Itochu Corp.,  Japan ’s fourth-largest trader, forecast on
May 6 a profit increase of 49 percent this fiscal year. Marubeni
Corp., the fifth-largest, expects a 25 percent net income gain
and Mitsui & Co., the No. 2 trader, a 17 percent increase, the
companies said May 6.  Sumitomo expects to write down about 10 billion yen this
fiscal year due to the destruction caused by the March
earthquake and tsunami, Chief Financial Officer Toyosaku Hamada
told reporters today in  Tokyo .  To contact the Bloomberg staff on this story:
