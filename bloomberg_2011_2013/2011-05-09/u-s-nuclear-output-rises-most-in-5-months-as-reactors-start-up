U.S. nuclear-power production rose 4.7
percent in the largest jump in more than five months as
operators started reactors in  New Jersey , Georgia, Texas and
 Nebraska , the Nuclear Regulatory Commission said.  Power generation nationwide increased 3,301 megawatts from
May 6 to 73,358 megawatts, or 72 percent of capacity, the
largest increase over three days since Nov. 23, according to an
NRC report today and data compiled by Bloomberg. Twenty-six of
the nation’s 104 reactors were offline.  Public Service Enterprise Group Inc. (PEG)  started the 1,130-
megawatt Salem 2 reactor in New Jersey after shutting it for
refueling and maintenance on April 11. The unit is operating at
65 percent of capacity.  Another unit at the site, the 1,174-megawatt Salem 1, is
operating at full power. The plant is located about 18 miles (29
kilometers) south of Wilmington, Delaware.  Exelon Corp. (EXC)  switched on the 619-megawatt Oyster Creek unit
in New Jersey after idling it on May 2. The plant is located 33
miles north of  Atlantic City .  Southern Co. (SO)  started the 883-megawatt Edwin I. Hatch 2
reactor in Georgia after shutting it on May 5 for repairs to the
feedwater pump system. It is operating at 55 percent of
capacity.  Another unit at the site, the 876-megawatt Hatch 1, is
operating at full power. The plant is located about 74 miles
west of Savannah.  South Texas Reactor  South Texas Project Nuclear Operating Co. switched on the
1,410-megawatt South Texas 1 reactor after a maintenance and
refueling outage that began April 4. It is operating at 56
percent of capacity.  South Texas 2, another 1,410-megawatt unit at the plant,
located 80 miles southwest of Houston, was operating at full
power.  The Nebraska Public Power District started the 830-megawatt
Cooper reactor in Nebraska after a refueling and maintenance
outage that began March 14. It is operating at 17 percent of
capacity.  The unit is near Brownville on the Missouri River 64 miles
south of Omaha. Nebraska Public Power is based in Columbus,
Nebraska.  NextEra Energy Inc. (NEE)  increased output from the 839-megawatt
Saint Lucie 2 reactor in Florida to 45 percent of capacity from
10 percent on May 6.  Another reactor at the plant, the 839-megawatt Saint Lucie
1, was operating at 93 percent of capacity. The station is
located about 45 miles north of  Palm Beach .  LaSalle Unit  Exelon boosted the 1,120-megawatt LaSalle Unit 2 to full
power from 60 percent of capacity on May 6. Another reactor at
the site, the 1,118-megawatt LaSalle 1, is operating at full
capacity. The plant is located 70 miles southwest of  Chicago .  Pinnacle West Capital Corp. (PNW)  increased output from the
1,335-megawatt Palo Verde 2 reactor to 69 percent of capacity
from 2 percent on May 6. The unit was shut for refueling and
maintenance on April 4.  Units 1 and 3, which have the same capacities as Unit 2,
are operating at full power. The plant is located about 45 miles
west of Phoenix.  Exelon shut the 882-megawatt Quad Cities 1 reactor on the
Illinois side of the Mississippi River. Another unit at the
site, the 882-megawatt Quad Cities 2, is operating at full
power. The plant is located about 20 miles northeast of Moline.  Entergy Corp. (ETR)  slowed the 852-megawatt FitzPatrick plant in
 New York  to 59 percent of capacity from full power on May 6. The
plant is located 6 miles northeast of Oswego.  Arkansas Reactor  Entergy boosted the 995-megawatt Arkansas Nuclear Two
reactor to 87 percent of capacity from 78 percent on May 6. The
 Little Rock  Transmission Operating Center asked the plant to
reduce power on April 25 after a storm knocked out a 500
kilovolt line.  The 843-megawatt Unit 1 is operating at 46 percent of
capacity. Before the storm, each unit was operating at full
power at the plant, located 65 miles northwest of Little Rock.  Some reactors are closed for maintenance and refueling
during the spring and fall in the U.S., when demand for heating
and cooling is lower. The outages can increase consumption of
natural gas and coal to generate electricity.  The average U.S. reactor  refueling outage  lasted 41 days in
2009, according to the  Nuclear Energy Institute .  To contact the reporter on this story:
