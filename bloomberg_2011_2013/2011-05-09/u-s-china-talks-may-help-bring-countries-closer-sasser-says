Talks between U.S. and Chinese
officials may help bring the countries closer together on
economic issues, said James Sasser, former ambassador to  China 
during the administration of President  Bill Clinton .  “There’s a good-faith effort being made to work
together,” Sasser, a former Democratic senator from Tennessee,
said in an interview today on Bloomberg Television. “As far as
anything solid coming out of this session, I doubt it.”  China is the largest foreign holder of U.S. Treasury debt.
“I don’t think the Chinese are concerned about the debt
ceiling,” Sasser said. “As of now, their U.S Treasury bonds
are safe and sound and they know it.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
