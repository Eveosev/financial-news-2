Asia  fuel oil  losses narrowed to the
smallest in more than a month on signs that  Japan  will increase
its demand for power generation fuels to replace lost nuclear
capacity. Naphtha swaps extended last week’s losses.  Fuel Oil  Fuel oil’s discount to Dubai crude narrowed 12 percent to
$7.29 a barrel at 11:12 a.m. Singapore time, according to PVM
Oil Associates, a London-based broker. The spread, which
measures refining losses from the fuel, was at its narrowest
since March 16. High-sulfur fuel oil swaps for June rose $6, or
1 percent, to $627 a metric ton, PVM data showed.  The premium of 180-centistoke fuel oil to 380-centistoke
fuel oil narrowed 50 cents to $12 a ton. A smaller premium means
prices of higher-quality fuel oil used at power stations rose
less than bunker grades.  Chubu Electric Power Co.’s board met May 7 to discuss a
possible closure of its sole nuclear plant after Japanese Prime
Minister  Naoto Kan  expressed concern the facility may not be
able to withstand a powerful earthquake and tsunami.  Light Distillates  Naphtha swaps slipped 0.9 percent to $953.25 a ton, the
fifth consecutive decline, PVM data showed.  The crack spread, a measure of the refining margin for
processing  Brent crude  into the petrochemical feedstock, rose to
$119.99 a ton today compared with $112.36 at the end of Asian
trading on May 6, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Yeochun NCC Co. is running its No. 1 cracker in Yeosu,
 South Korea , at full capacity after starting the plant last
week, ICIS said, citing a company official it didn’t identify.  The company started the plant on May 4 after a month of
maintenance work, ICIS said. The cracker has the capacity to
produce 857,000 tons a year of ethylene from naphtha.  Middle Distillates  June swaps for gasoil gained 35 cents, or 0.3 percent, to
$122.85 a barrel. Jet fuel’s premium to gasoil, or the regrade,
rose 40 cents to $1.25 a barrel.  Gasoil’s premium to Dubai crude, a measure of processing
profit for the fuel, advanced 44 cents, or 2.4 percent, to
$19.10 a barrel, PVM data showed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
