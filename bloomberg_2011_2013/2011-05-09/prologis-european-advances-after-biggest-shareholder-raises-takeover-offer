ProLogis European Properties (PEPR) ,  Europe ’s
biggest warehouse operator, gained in Amsterdam trading after
 ProLogis (PLD)  increased its bid for the fund.  ProLogis European, or PEPR, rose 1.2 percent to 6.20 euros
at the 5:30 p.m. close, matching ProLogis’s new offer price and
valuing PEPR at 1.18 billion euros ($1.7 billion). Denver-based
ProLogis said it raised the bid from 6.10 euros in a statement
after the market closed on May 6.  The U.S. property investor also agreed to buy units of the
fund held by APG Algemene Pensioen Groep NV and an affiliate of
the Government of Singapore Investment Corp. The agreement will
boost ProLogis’ stake in PEPR to about 60 percent.  “This is not a knockout bid, but the important news is
that APG and the government of Singapore are selling some of
their stakes,” Ruud Van Maanen, an analyst at ABN Amro Group
NV, said by telephone. “That decreases the chance that APG and
Goodman will come back with an offer.” Van Maanen has a
“hold” rating on PEPR.  APG and  Goodman Group (GMG)  on April 12 announced an indicative
offer of 6 euros in cash for each ordinary unit of Luxembourg-
based PEPR. ProLogis rejected APG’s proposal and offered 6.10
euros per unit on April 22. Goodman Group is Australia’s biggest
industrial real estate investment trust by market value.  APG said in April it was trying to end years of
disagreement with ProLogis on the management and governance of
the European fund, which owns 232 properties across Europe with
a value of 2.8 billion euros. PEPR, created in 1999 as a closed-
end real estate investment fund externally managed by a
subsidiary of ProLogis, sold units at 14.35 euros each in an
initial public offering in 2006.  To contact the reporters on this story:
