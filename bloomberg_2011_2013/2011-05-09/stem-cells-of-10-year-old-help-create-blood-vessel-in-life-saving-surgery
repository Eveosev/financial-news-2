A 10-year-old girl with a deadly blood
clot underwent a life-saving surgery that showed the power of
using  stem cells  to regenerate healthy organs.  The girl developed a clot in the blood vessel between her
intestine and liver during her first year of life, creating the
risk of potentially fatal bleeding.  Michael Olausson , a surgeon
at  Sahlgrenska University Hospital  at the University of
Gothenburg took a blood vessel from a donor, chemically removed
tissue and DNA from it, then seeded stem cells from the girl’s
bone marrow to create a healthy, living blood vessel.  “We carried out the surgery over three months ago now, and
the result was very good, with no serious complications,”
Olausson, of the hospital in Gothenburg,  Sweden , said today in a
statement. “The girl is in good health, and we believe that her
prognosis is very good. Since the vessel was created with the
girl’s own stem cells, she does not need to take drugs to
prevent rejection.”  A similar procedure was used in 2008 by surgeons in
Barcelona to create a new windpipe for a 30-year-old woman whose
airway collapsed from a tuberculosis infection.  More research may lead to the ability to remake other
organs and arteries, Olausson said. This might help patients who
need  kidney dialysis  or surgery on arteries leading to their
heart, Olausson said.  While blood vessels from other parts of a patient’s body
are sometimes used to repair such defects, liver failure can
result if the vessels are inadequate, according to the
hospital’s statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
