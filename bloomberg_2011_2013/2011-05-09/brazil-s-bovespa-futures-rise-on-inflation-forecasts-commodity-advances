The Bovespa stock index advanced,
rebounding from two straight weekly declines, as homebuilders
rallied on speculation interest rates will rise less than
previously estimated while commodity gains lifted producers.  MRV Engenharia & Participacoes SA, Brazil’s fourth-biggest
homebuilder by revenue, posted the biggest two-day jump in a
year after economists cut their inflation forecasts, spurring
traders to pare bets for higher borrowing costs. Petroleo
Brasileiro SA followed  oil prices  higher, gaining the most in
more than two weeks. Advances were offset as consumer-goods
maker  Hypermarcas SA (HYPE3)  plunged the most since October 2008 after
first-quarter net income fell 40 percent from a year earlier.  The Bovespa rose 0.3 percent to 64,621.97 at the 4:15 p.m.
New York time close, after falling as much as 0.4 percent
earlier. Forty-three stocks climbed on the measure while 24
slipped. The real lost 0.1 percent to 1.6168 per dollar.  “When you look around the world, the Bovespa is still one
of the cheapest markets out there,” Will Landers, manager of
the $1 billion  Latin America  Fund at BlackRock Inc., said on
Bloomberg Surveillance with  Tom Keene . “We’ll continue to see
strong earnings growth from the majority of the companies we’re
looking at.”  Economists covering  Brazil ’s economy cut their 2011
inflation forecast for the first time in nine weeks. Consumer
prices will rise 6.33 percent in 2011, compared with a week-
earlier forecast of 6.37 percent, according to a May 6 survey of
about 100 economists published today.  MRV advanced 4.4 percent to 13.89 reais, for a two-day gain
of 10 percent. Rossi Residencial SA, Brazil’s sixth-biggest
homebuilder by revenue, climbed 2.7 percent to 14.07 reais.  Commodity Rebound  Commodities rose the most in seven weeks on signs an
improving U.S. economy may boost raw-material demand and on
speculation last week’s biggest drop since December 2008 was
excessive. Crude oil rose above $102 a barrel in  New York .  Petrobras, Brazil’s state-controlled oil company, advanced
1.6 percent to 24.60 reais, the most since April 20.  Hypermarcas plunged 11 percent to 18.12 reais after saying
first-quarter net income fell to 32.9 million reais. The company
was forecast to post net income excluding some items of 129.3
million reais in the first quarter, according to the average
estimate of eight analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  Investors pulled 3.3 billion reais from Latin America’s
biggest equity market this year through May 4, data from the Sao
Paulo exchange show.  Brazil’s benchmark equity gauge trades at 10.3 times
analysts’ earnings estimates after falling 7.1 percent this year
through last week on concern speeding inflation will hurt
economic growth, according to weekly data compiled by Bloomberg.
That compares to a ratio of 13.3 for the Shanghai Composite
Index, 7 for  Russia ’s Micex, and 14.5 for  India ’s Sensex.  To contact the reporter on this story:
