Kenya ’s shilling depreciated to an
almost four-week low against the dollar as oil importers sought
to buy the U.S. currency to fund purchases.  The currency of East Africa’s biggest economy declined as
much as 0.7 percent to 84.40 per dollar the lowest level since
April 8 and traded 0.5 percent down at 4.22 by 1:07 p.m. in the
capital, Nairobi.  The shilling has weakened “due to growing demand by oil
importers and is expected to trade within the 84.50 to 85.00
range in the coming days,” Wilson Mutai, a dealer at Nairobi-
based African Banking Corp., said in a phone interview today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
