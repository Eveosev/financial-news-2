Wind farms will dominate two auctions
for power contracts that  Brazil  has scheduled for July.  Developers of 568 wind, biomass, hydroelectric and natural-
gas-fired power plants with total capacity of more than 23,300
megawatts will bid for sales contracts with distributors,
Brazil’s national energy research agency  Empresa de Pesquisa
Energetica  said on its  website  today.  Wind projects accounted for almost 11,000 megawatts, about
47 percent, and will likely sell power at the lowest rate, Fabio
Sales Dias, president of Brasilia-based consulting company Vario
ECP Ltda., said today in a phone interview.  The price for wind-power is unlikely to go below 131 reais
($81.02) a megawatt-hour, he said. “Any lower than that and
projects won’t be viable anymore.”  Natural-gas thermoelectric plants were the second-largest
category, with 16 projects and total capacity of more than 6,600
megawatts. This type of project was not included in two similar
power auctions last year, and Dias said it’s not clear  how much
distributors would pay.  The auctions will also include 81 biomass projects with
capacity of 4,600 megawatts, 41 small hydroelectric projects
with 725 megawatts of combined capacity and a 450-megawatt
expansion to an existing hydroelectric facility, according to
the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
