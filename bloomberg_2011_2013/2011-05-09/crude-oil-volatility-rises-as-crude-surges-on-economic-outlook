Oil options volatility rose as the
underlying futures surged 5.5 percent in  New York , rebounding
from the biggest weekly decline since 2008, on signals the
global economic recovery remains intact.  Futures climbed the most in more than two months after a
report today showed German exports surged to a record in March
and the U.S. Labor Department said last week that payrolls
expanded. Prices also advanced on concern that a rising
 Mississippi River  will flood Louisiana refineries.  Implied volatility for at-the-money options expiring in
June, a measure of expected price swings in futures and a gauge
of options prices, was 42.2 percent as of 4 p.m. in New York, up
from 41.1 percent May 6.  Crude oil for June delivery jumped $5.37 to settle at
$102.55 a barrel on the  New York Mercantile Exchange .  The most active contracts in electronic trading today were
June $90 puts, with 4,328 lots changing hands. They fell 51
cents to 14 cents a barrel at 3:55 p.m. June $105 calls, the
next-most active option, rose $1.21 to $1.74 a barrel with 3,504
contracts trading. One contract covers 1,000 barrels of crude.  Nymex distributes real-time data for electronic trading and
releases information on floor trading, where the bulk of options
trading occurs, the next business day.  June $95 puts were the most active options traded in the
previous session, with 12,484 lots changing hands. They
increased 63 cents to $1.82 a barrel. The next-most active
option, July $115 calls, fell 26 cents to 59 cents a barrel on
12,062 lots.  Open interest was highest for December 2012 $80 puts with
47,336 contracts. Next were June 2011 $150 calls with 44,097 and
