Canadian Tire Corp., operator of the
eponymous home-retail chain, agreed to buy  Forzani Group Ltd. (FGL) 
for about C$771 million ($800 million), gaining control of
Canada’s largest sporting-goods retailer.  The cash bid is C$26.50 a share, or 50 percent more than
Calgary-based Forzani’s latest closing price, the companies said
today in a statement. Forzani operates about 500 athletic stores
across Canada.  Canadian Tire, with more than 1,200 retail and gasoline
outlets, already sells bicycles and other sporting goods, as
well as home items. The acquisition gives Canadian Tire Chief
Executive Officer Stephen Wetmore stores under the Sport Chek
and National Sports brands.  “The complementary nature of the two is extraordinary,”
Wetmore told reporters today at a press conference in Toronto.
Canadian Tire would like to attract sports shoppers aged 20 to
40, whom they usually lose to Forzani, he said.  Michael Medline, a former Canadian Tire executive, will
lead the integration, Wetmore said.  Canadian Tire rose C$1.60, or 2.7 percent, to C$60.19 at 4
p.m. on the Toronto Stock Exchange. The shares had slumped 14
percent this year before today. Forzani surged C$8.64, or 49
percent, to C$26.25.  Sales Growth  Forzani, which has about 14,000 employees, was founded more
than three decades ago by John Forzani. The company’s revenue
rose 6.6 percent to C$1.45 billion in the year ended Jan. 30.  Canadian Tire, founded in 1922, sells automotive parts
through its Canadian Tire Retail and PartSource stores. It also
operates Mark’s Work Wearhouse, an apparel chain. Retail sales
were C$10.3 billion last year, the company said in February.  Greenhill & Co.  Canada  Ltd. served as financial adviser to
Forzani, while Blake, Cassels & Graydon LLP acted as legal
counsel. Macleod Dixon LLP provided legal counsel to the special
committee of the board evaluating the offer, and Longview
Communications Inc. acted as communications adviser. BMO Capital
Markets gave financial advice to Canadian Tire, while Goodmans
LLP and Stikeman Elliott LLP offered legal counsel.  Canadian Tire had C$554 million in cash as of Jan. 1,
according to a company filing. The auto-parts retailer will
finance the purchase with C$500 million in cash and the
remainder with short-term financing.  To contact the reporter on this story:
