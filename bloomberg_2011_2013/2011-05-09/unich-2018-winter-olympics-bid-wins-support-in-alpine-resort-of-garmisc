Munich’s bid for the 2018 Winter Games 
received regional support when residents of the alpine resort of
 Garmisch-Partenkirchen  voted in favor of the event in a
referendum.  Results showed 58.1 percent approved bringing the Olympic
games to the German state of Bavaria in 2018, according to a
 statement  on the website of the Munich 2018 bid committee. A
total of 12,476 people, or 59.6 percent of the electorate, took
part in the ballot.  Munich is competing with Annecy,  France , and Pyeongchang,
 South Korea , to host the Games. The  International Olympic
Committee  will decide on the site on July 6 at a meeting in
Durban,  South Africa . Garmisch would host the skiing events in
2018, should Munich win the bid.  Katarina Witt, the two-time Olympic figure-skating champion
who is leading Munich’s bid, said in April that she was
confident that local residents will vote in favor of the event.  “It is a good day for Munich 2018, because where we had
confidence, we now have certainty too,” the Munich committee
said. “This democratic decision should now be accepted by
everyone.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
