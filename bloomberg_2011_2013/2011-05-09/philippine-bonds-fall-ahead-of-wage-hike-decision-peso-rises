Philippine  government bonds  dropped,
pushing three-year yields to the highest in almost a month, on
speculation a wage increase in Manila will fan inflation. The
peso gained.  The capital’s wage board may approve a 22-peso ($0.51)
daily “emergency cost of living allowance,” Trade Union Congress
of the Philippines spokesman Rafael Mapalo said today. The union,
which is seeking a 75-peso increase to the minimum daily wage
from 404 pesos, will appeal the decision once it is announced,
he said.  “A wage increase is a strong signal of second-round
inflation,” said Yvette Marquez-Carlos, who helps manage the
equivalent of $11 billion at BPI Asset Management in Manila.
“As inflation remains a concern, so is the threat of further
rate increases.”  The yield on the 6.25 percent note due January 2014 climbed
10 basis points, or 0.10 percentage point, to 5.00 percent as of
4:27 p.m., the highest level since April 12, according to
Tradition Financial Services. The peso strengthened 0.4 percent
to 42.93 per dollar, the biggest daily gain in a week, according
to Tullett Prebon Plc.  The central bank, which raised its overnight borrowing rate
by a quarter of a percentage point to 4.50 percent on May 5, has
included a 25-peso rise in wages in its inflation outlook,
Governor Amando Tetangco said last week.  Consumer prices rose 4.5 percent in April from a year
earlier, from 4.3 percent in March and the most in 12 months,
official data showed May 5. A pay increase of more than 25 pesos
a day may stoke inflation, Finance Secretary Cesar Purisima told
reporters today.  To contact the reporter for this story:
