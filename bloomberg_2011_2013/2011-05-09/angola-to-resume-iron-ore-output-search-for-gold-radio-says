Angola plans to resume iron ore output
in its southwestern Huila province within the next two years
while also starting gold exploration there, Radio Nacional de
Angola reported, citing Secretary of State for Industry Kiala
Gabriel.  Iron ore production in Huila was interrupted in the mid-
1980s by a civil war, which ended in 2002.  To contact the reporter on this story:
