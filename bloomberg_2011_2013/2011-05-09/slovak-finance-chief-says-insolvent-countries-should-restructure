Restructuring of state debt should be
part of the solution of fiscal problems in insolvent countries,
Slovak Finance Minister Ivan Miklos said, adding he wasn’t
specifically talking about  Greece .  “The general principle is: if the country is facing
liquidity crisis, then a bailout helps,” Miklos said today at a
press conference in Bratislava, Slovakia. “If there is a
solvency crisis, debt restructuring should be part of the
solution.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
