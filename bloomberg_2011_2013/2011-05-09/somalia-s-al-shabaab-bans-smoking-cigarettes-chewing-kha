Somalia’s al-Shabaab, an Islamic
militant group that controls most of the southern and central
parts of the country, banned smoking cigarettes and chewing
khat, a leafy narcotic, in the Afgoye district.  Anyone caught violating the ban, which includes selling
tobacco products, may face 30 days and a fine, said Sheikh Aby
Ramla, head of the information department in Afogye, 30
kilometers (18.6 miles) southwest of the capital, Mogadishu.  Al-Shabaab, which the U.S. alleges is linked to al-Qaeda,
has been battling the western-backed Somali government for
control of the Horn of Africa nation since 2007.  To contact the reporter on this story:
