Freescale Semiconductor Inc., the
chipmaker that is partly owned by  Blackstone Group LP (BX) , said its
shares will be priced at $22 to $24 apiece in an initial public
offering that may raise as much as $1.04 billion.  The company said in a regulatory filing today that it
intends to sell 43.5 million shares. Based on the midpoint of
the price range and the company’s expected 239.8 million shares
outstanding following the sale, the offering would value
Freescale at about $5.52 billion.  The Austin, Texas-based company filed its intention to sell
shares to the public in February, saying it would use the
proceeds to help reduce its debt, which totals $7.58 billion.
Freescale, the largest supplier of chips to the U.S. automobile
industry, borrowed billions as it was taken private by
Blackstone, TPG Capital,  Carlyle Group  and Permira Advisers LLP
in a $17.6 billion transaction in 2006.  Chief Executive Officer Rich Beyer is trying to pay down
liabilities that have forced Freescale to report losses. To cut
costs, he has shuttered factories and is exiting the mobile-
phone radio-chip business, a legacy of the company’s origins as
a part of Motorola Inc.  If the underwriters -- Deutsche Bank AG, Citigroup Inc.,
Barclays Capital Inc., Credit Suisse Group AG and JPMorgan Chase
& Co. -- fully exercise their overallotment option, the offering
will rise to more than 50 million shares, Freescale said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
