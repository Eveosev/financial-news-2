Overseas investors sold a net 3.51
billion rupees ($78.5 million) of Indian stocks on May 9, paring
their investments in equities this year to 16 billion rupees,
the nation’s market regulator said.  Foreigners purchased 26.1 billion rupees of shares and sold
29.6 billion rupees, the  Securities and Exchange Board of India 
said  today . They bought 452 million rupees of bonds, taking
total debt purchases this year to 142 billion rupees.  Foreign funds bought a record 1.33 trillion rupees of
shares in 2010, helping fuel a 17 percent rally in the Bombay
Stock Exchange Sensitive Index, the best performer among the
world’s 10 biggest equity markets last year. The Sensex has
fallen 9.7 percent this year.  The previous record was in 2009 when flows reached 834.2
billion rupees, sparking the biggest advance in 18 years. Funds
withdrew a record 530 billion rupees from stocks in 2008,
setting off the worst annual slump. Foreign funds have placed
4.487 trillion rupees in equities and 928.7 billion rupees in
bonds since they were allowed into the country in 1993.  The regulator provides data on shares bought and sold by
large investors, including trades in the primary and secondary
markets, with a delay of at least a day.  To contact the reporter on this story:
