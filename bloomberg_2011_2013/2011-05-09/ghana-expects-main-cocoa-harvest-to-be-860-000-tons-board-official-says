Ghana , the world’s second-biggest
cocoa producer, expects its 2010-11 main-crop harvest to reach
860,000 metric tons, 1.2 percent higher than an earlier
projection, said Yaw Adu-Ampomah, deputy chief executive officer
of the Ghana Cocoa Board.  Purchases in the 30 weeks of the season to April 28 were
822,000 tons, he said by phone today from Accra, the capital.
About 30,000 tons of beans have been smuggled from neighboring
 Ivory Coast , the world’s biggest grower of the chocolate
ingredient, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
