Mexican auto output fell 10.4 percent
in April on factory shutdowns in  Japan  following the tsunami and
productivity lost to the Holy Week vacation, said Eduardo Solis,
head of the industry chamber known as  AMIA .  Auto production of cars and light trucks fell to 152,514,
according to AMIA statistics released today. Exports rose 5.9
percent to 141,338 units.  The Holy Week fell in March last year, causing an
unfavorable comparison this year, Solis said during a news
conference in Mexico City today. Solis said he doesn’t expect
another production slowdown this year.  AMDA , the Mexican auto dealership chamber, is maintaining
its forecast for as much as 890,000 units sold domestically by
year-end, said Guillermo Rosales, the chamber’s director.  Domestic sales in April increased 8 percent to 65,246
vehicles, according to the nation’s car dealership association,
or AMDA. The groups held a joint press conference in Mexico
City.  To contact the reporters on this story:
