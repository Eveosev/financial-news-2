Economists covering the Brazilian
economy cut their 2011 inflation forecast for the first time in
nine weeks, after monthly inflation unexpectedly slowed in April
and commodities prices last week fell the most since 2008.  Consumer prices will rise 6.33 percent in 2011, compared
with a week-earlier forecast of 6.37 percent, according to a May
6  survey  of about 100 economists published today. Economists’
forecasts for inflation next year were unchanged at 5 percent,
the survey showed.  “There are tentative signs that food inflation has shown
signs of peaking,” said  Neil Shearing , an emerging markets
economist at Capital Economics Ltd. in  London . “As we get more
and more evidence that the commodities shock is passing through
the system, we’ll get further downward revisions to these
numbers.”  Food price inflation may start to slow in a sustained
fashion from September or October, Shearing said, speaking by
telephone from London.  Brazil ’s central bank raised its benchmark interest rate by
a quarter-point to 12 percent on April 20, on top of half-point
increases at its January and March meetings. Monthly inflation
unexpectedly slowed to 0.77 percent in April, the lowest level
since December.  Benchmark Rate  Economists raised their forecast for the 2012 benchmark
interest rate for the sixth time this year. The Selic rate will
end next year at 12.25 percent, up from a week-earlier forecast
of 12 percent, the survey found. Economists expect the rate to
be 12.5 percent at the end of this year, unchanged from last
week’s forecast.  “The strength of demand in the Brazilian economy is
starting to be a real concern,” Shearing said. “There is a
sense that fiscal policy isn’t going to do the heavy lifting,
it’s going to have to fall to monetary policy.”  The economists surveyed by the central bank expect gross
domestic product to expand 4 percent this year. Analysts cut
their forecast for 2012 growth to 4.21 percent, from 4.25
percent.  Analysts expect the real to end 2011 at 1.62 per  U.S.
dollar , unchanged from the previous week’s forecast.  Slower Inflation  In testimony before Congress last week, central bank
President Alexandre Tombini said he expects monthly inflation to
start slowing in May to a level in line with the bank’s year-end
goal. The central bank targets inflation of 4.5 percent, plus or
minus two percentage points.  The yield on the interest rate futures contract maturing in
January 2013, the most traded in  Sao Paulo  today, fell two basis
points, or 0.02 percentage point, to 12.540 percent at 8:45 a.m.
New York time. The real was unchanged at 1.6149 per U.S. dollar.  Annual consumer price inflation accelerated to 6.51 percent
in the year through April, the first time the benchmark IPCA
index has exceeded the 6.5 percent upper limit of the inflation
target since 2005.  The Standard & Poor’s GSCI Index of 24 raw materials
advanced as much as 2.5 percent today, after falling 11.15
percent last week.  To contact the reporters on this story:
