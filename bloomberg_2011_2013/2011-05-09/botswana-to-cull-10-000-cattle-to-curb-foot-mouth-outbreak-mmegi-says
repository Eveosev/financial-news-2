Botswana plans to slaughter about
10,000 cattle to curb an outbreak of foot and mouth disease,
 Mmegi reported , citing Agriculture Minister Christian de Graaf.  The government will spend about 30 million pula ($4.6
million) on “bio-security” and fencing to prevent infected
livestock entering disease-free areas, the Gaborone-based
newspaper said.  Farmers will be compensated at market value for all cattle
slaughtered under the Botswana Meat Commission’s supervision,
the newspaper said. Botswana announced the outbreak on May 6.  Boikhutso Rabasha, a spokesman for the agriculture
ministry, didn’t answer her phone today when Bloomberg News
called seeking comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
