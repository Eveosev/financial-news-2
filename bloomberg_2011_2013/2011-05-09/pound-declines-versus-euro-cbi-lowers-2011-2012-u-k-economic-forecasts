The pound declined against the euro
after the Confederation of British Industry said the U.K.
economy will expand at a slower pace than previously forecast
this year and next.  Sterling snapped a two-day decline versus the dollar. Gross
domestic product will rise by 1.7 percent in 2011
compared with a February prediction of 1.8 percent, Britain’s
biggest employers’ group said in quarterly forecasts released
today. Growth next year will be 2.2 percent instead of 2.3
percent, it said.  The pound weakened 0.6 percent to 87.98 pence per euro as
of 7:29 a.m. in  London . It was 0.1 percent stronger at $1.6384
and little changed at 132.06 yen.  To contact the reporter on this story:
