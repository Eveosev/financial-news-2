Canada ’s dollar climbed for a second
day against its U.S. counterpart as a rebound in commodities
following the steepest weekly slump since 2008 overshadowed the
reduction of  Greece ’s credit rating by  Standard & Poor’s .  The loonie, as the currency is known for the image of the
aquatic bird on the C$1 coin, erased losses as crude oil, the
nation’s biggest export, rallied along with silver and wheat.
The Canadian currency fell earlier as the cut in Greece’s credit
rating sapped demand for higher-yielding assets.  “Commodities are the key to this,” said  John Curran , a
senior vice president in Toronto at CanadianForex Ltd., an
online foreign-exchange dealer. “ Europe  obviously may play into
it, but the longer-term trend is going to be based off of what
commodities do.”  The loonie appreciated 0.5 percent to 96.18 cents versus
the greenback at 5:00 p.m. in Toronto, from 96.66 on May 6. The
day before that it slipped to 97.13, the weakest level since
April 18. One Canadian dollar buys $1.0397.  Last week’s rout in commodities prompted Goldman Sachs
Group Inc., which forecast the plunge, to predict a possible
recovery. The S&P GSCI Index of 24  raw materials  jumped as much
as 2.5 percent, the most since March 17, following last week’s
slide of 11 percent.  Greece’s credit rating was cut two levels to B from BB- by
S&P, which said further reductions are possible as the risk of
default rises.  ‘Cannot Continue’  “You’re seeing a slow realization in public, at least by
the Europeans, that this cannot continue,” said Joseph Trevisani, chief market analyst at FX Solutions Inc. in Saddle
River,  New Jersey . “We may see more of this.”  Canadian  government bonds  rose, pushing the 10-year yield
down one basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 3.18 percent.
The price of the 3.25 percent security maturing in June 2021
increased 7 cents to C$100.58.  Crude oil for June delivery climbed 5.9 percent to $102.91
a barrel on the  New York Mercantile Exchange . Last week oil had
the largest slump since December 2008. Raw materials including
crude account for about half of Canada’s export revenue.  “The fundamental picture of the world’s economy hasn’t
changed at all,” Trevisani said. “We’ve had a huge bubble in
the commodities.”  Silver futures jumped as much as 7.6 percent after losing
27 percent, the most since at least 1975, last week. Wheat
advanced for a second day.  The Thomson Reuters/Jefferies CRB Index of commodities
advanced 2 percent to 344.10 after tumbling 9 percent last week,
the most since December 2008.  To contact the reporter on this story:
