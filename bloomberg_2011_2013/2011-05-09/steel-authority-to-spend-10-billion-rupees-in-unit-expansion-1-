Steel Authority of India Ltd. (SAIL) , the
nationâ€™s second-largest producer, plans to invest 10 billion
rupees ($224 million) in a ferromanganese unit as it seeks to
almost double output by 2020.  The company  will spend 5 billion rupees each on two new
ferromanganese furnaces and a 45-megawatt power plant at
Maharashtra Elktrosmelt Ltd., according to an e-mailed statement
today. The investment will help Steel Authority meet its future
needs, Chairman C.S. Verma said in the statement.  The New Delhi-based company plans to boost steel production
by about 80 percent to 26.2 million metric tons by expanding its
existing units in the eastern states of Jharkhand, West Bengal
and Orissa as demand rises for automobile and other high-grade
steel. It may also set up a new factory in Jharkhand.  Shares of Steel Authority were little changed today after
sliding 15 percent this year. The Bombay Stock Exchange
Sensitive Index, or Sensex, has declined 10 percent in 2011.  The steelmaker, which aims to spend 143.4 billion rupees
this fiscal year to expand capacity, will increase the share of
value-added steel it produces to 55 percent from 37 percent,
Verma said on Sept. 30. He expects output to rise 68 percent to
23.5 million metric tons by March 2013.  To contact the reporter on this story:
