Hong Kong stocks rose, driving the
benchmark index to its first increase in nine days, after
stronger-than-forecast growth in U.S. jobs bolstered confidence
in the global economy.  HSBC Holdings Plc (HSBA) , which made 20 percent of its 2009
revenue in  North America , increased 1.6 percent.  Li & Fung Ltd. (494) ,
the biggest supplier to retailers including Wal-Mart Stores Inc.,
gained 0.6 percent.  Cnooc Ltd. (883) ,  China ’s largest offshore oil
producer, advanced 1.8 percent, while Jiangxi Copper Co.,
China’s No. 1 producer of the metal, climbed 1.9 percent after
commodity prices rose today.  “We may see further extension of the current upward
movement in the market,” with some bargain hunting today, said
 Alex Wong , asset-management director at Ample Capital Ltd. in
Hong Kong. “The jobs data is encouraging because the creation
has been stronger than expected. There isn’t much negative news,
and a piece of encouraging data is helpful.”  The Hang Seng Index gained 0.8 percent to 23,336 at the
close, ending its longest losing streak since 2003, with about
eight stocks advancing for every one that fell in the 45-member
gauge. The Hang Seng China Enterprises Index of Chinese
companies’ H shares gained 0.7 percent to 12,934.47.  HSBC rose 1.6 percent to HK$84, the biggest contributor to
the Hang Seng Index. Its Asia-Pacific unit’s return on equity in
the first quarter is higher than 20 percent, the Apple Daily
reported, citing unidentified people.  Li & Fung increased 0.6 percent to HK$36.75, while  Yue Yuen
Industrial Holdings Ltd. (551) , which makes shoes for Nike Inc.,
gained 3.1 percent to HK$28.25.  U.S. Jobs Growth  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index were little
changed today. In  New York , the index gained 0.4 percent on May
6 as stronger-than-forecast growth in jobs bolstered confidence
in the world’s largest economy.  U.S. payrolls increased by 244,000 workers last month, the
biggest gain since May 2010, after a revised 221,000 gain in
April, the Labor Department said on May 6 in  Washington .
Economists projected an increase of 185,000, according to the
median estimate in a Bloomberg News survey of economists.  Commodity stocks gained after oil and metal prices
increased. Cnooc advanced 1.8 percent to HK$18.30, while
PetroChina Co., Asia’s biggest company by market value, rose 1.7
percent to HK$10.66. Jiangxi Copper climbed 1.9 percent to
HK$24.55.  Crude for June delivery advanced as much as $2.52 to $99.70
a barrel in electronic trading on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange  today, while three-month delivery copper gained by as
much as 1.6 percent to $8,970 a metric ton on the London Metal
Exchange, and traded at $8,939 at 4:04 p.m. Singapore time.  Oil, Copper Advance  The  Hang Seng Index (HSI)  sank 2.4 percent last week as economic
reports from the U.S. and falling commodity prices damped
investor confidence. Shares in the gauge traded at an average
12.2 times forecast earnings on May 6, compared with 14.4 times
at the end of last year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  BYD Co., the Chinese maker of lithium batteries, jumped
5.2 percent to HK$28.20 after the China Securities Regulatory
Commission said it will review the company’s Shenzhen initial
public offering application today.  Futures on the Hang Seng Index rose 0.8 percent to 23,160.
The HSI Volatility Index, the benchmark gauge for Hong Kong
stock options, increased 1.2 percent to 17.30, indicating
options traders expect a swing of 5 percent in the Hang Seng
Index in the next 30 days.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
