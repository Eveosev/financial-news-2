Hewlett-Packard Co. and  Apple Inc. (AAPL) 
were among five companies accused by closely held Linex
Technologies Inc. of infringing patents for wireless
communications used in laptop computers.  Aruba Networks Inc. (ARUN) ,  Meru Networks Inc. (MERU)  and Ruckus Wireless
Inc., all based in Sunnyvale, California, were also named in the
May 6  complaint  with the U.S. International Trade Commission in
Washington, which has the power to block imports of products
found to infringe patents. Linex also sued in federal court in
Wilmington, Delaware, the same day, seeking cash compensation.  Linex, a Palm Beach Gardens, Florida-based licenser of
technology, claims two of its patents cover inventions used in
the standard for wireless communication, including a way to
limit the fading of signal strength in buildings. The complaint
cites at least nine models by Palo Alto, California-based HP,
including the Pavilion and Envy laptops, as well as Cupertino,
California-based Appleâ€™s MacBook Air, MacBook Pro, Airport
Extreme and Time Capsule products.  The case is In the Matter of Certain Wireless Communication
Devices and Systems, Complaint  No. 2802 , U.S. International
Trade Commission (Washington). The civil case is Linex
Technologies Inc. v.  Hewlett-Packard Co. (HPQ) , 11cv400, U.S. District
Court for the District of Delaware (Wilmington).  To contact the reporter on this story:
