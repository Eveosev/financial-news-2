Melbourne Rebels left fly-half Danny Cipriani out of the squad to tour  South Africa , saying they’d
“lost confidence” in the English rugby player after several
incidents.  He missed a match last week after breaking a squad
agreement not to go out after a loss in Sydney and staying out
the following night as well, the team said.  Cipriani, the first England international to play for an
Australian team in the elite southern hemisphere provincial
competition, has had other discipline problems. The player will
miss the two-week trip, which includes games against the Bulls
and Cheetahs, the club said today in an e-mailed statement. The
squad leaves tomorrow.  “The playing group and management have lost confidence in
Danny after the latest in a series of off-field breaches of the
teams behavioral standards,” Rebels Chief Executive Officer
Ross Oakley said in the statement. “To put the decision in
context, Danny also chose to stay out late again the night after
the incident in Sydney, and did not attend training the
following day. Management is addressing these issues with Danny
and we support the decision to not allow him to join the tour to
South Africa.”  Cipriani was fined one match’s salary after being asked to
leave a Melbourne nightclub when he allegedly helped himself to
a bottle of vodka following the team’s opening-round loss to the
New South Wales Waratahs on Feb. 18, newspapers including the
Age reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
