Most Indian shares dropped with the
benchmark index little changed.  Hindustan Unilever Ltd. (HUVR)  surged
after its fourth-quarter profit beat estimates.  Hindustan Unilever, India’s biggest producer of household
products, rose the most in more than five weeks after reporting
better-than-expected fourth-quarter profit as economic growth
and rising incomes boosted sales.  State Bank  of India, the
country’s biggest lender, slid 1 percent, pacing losses among
its peers amid concern higher borrowing costs would cool demand
for loans. Tata Motors Ltd., the nation’s largest truckmaker,
fell 1.9 percent and Maruti Suzuki India Ltd., the biggest
carmaker, sank 2.2 percent.  “Investors are shying away from banking and auto shares,
which are likely to be impacted by the increase in  interest
rates ,” said Kaushik Dani, a  fund manager  at Peerless Mutual
Fund, which has $1.1 billion in assets. “In uncertain times,
investors prefer defensive sectors such as telecom, fast-moving
 consumer goods  companies and drugmakers. We’re seeing some kind
of a rotation happening into the defensive sectors.”  The Bombay Stock Exchange Sensitive Index, or Sensex, was
little changed at 18,528.96 at the 3:30 p.m. close in Mumbai.
Three shares fell for every two that advanced on the 30-member
gauge, which swung between gains and losses at least 15 times.
The measure dropped 3.2 percent last week, the most since the
five-day period ended Jan. 14, after the central bank on May 3
raised rates for the ninth time since last March.  The S&P CNX Nifty Index on the National Stock Exchange was
little changed at 5,551.10. Its May futures settled at 5,555.10.
The BSE 200 Index increased 0.1 percent to 2,287.89.  Bharti Airtel Ltd. jumped 4.1 percent to 365.2 rupees, its
biggest gain since Feb. 3.  Shampoo, Detergent  Hindustan Unilever surged 3.2 percent to 284.75 rupees, its
steepest gain since March 31. Net income fell 2 percent to 5.69
billion rupees ($127 million) in the quarter ended March 31,
from 5.81 billion rupees a year earlier. That exceeded the 4.7
billion-rupee average of 24 analyst estimates compiled by
Bloomberg. Sales gained 13.5 percent to 49 billion rupees.  The maker of Dove shampoo and Surf detergent reported its
fastest quarterly sales growth in more than two years as rising
wealth in the second-fastest growing major economy spurred
people to spend more on consumer goods and packaged foods.  Tata Motors fell 1.9 percent to 1,176.9 rupees and Maruti
sank 2.2 percent to 1,245.5 rupees. Ranbaxy Laboratories Ltd.,
the biggest drugmaker by revenue, gained 2.6 percent to 441.4
rupees.  State Bank of India (SBIN) , the nation’s biggest lender, slid 1
percent to 2,623.25 rupees, and its May futures traded at
2,629.90 rupees.  HDFC Bank Ltd. (HDFCB) , the third biggest, lost 0.8
percent to 2,278.85 rupees.  ‘Precarious Point’  “There’s concern as for the first time the central bank
said last week it was prepared to sacrifice growth to control
inflation,”  Jagannadham Thunuguntla , chief strategist at SMC
Global Securities Ltd., said by phone from  New Delhi . “We are
at a precarious point. It’s better to be cautious than be an
aggressive investor.”  The Sensex has declined 9.7 percent this year on concern
higher borrowing costs will hurt corporate earnings. Sensex
stocks trade at an average 14.8 times estimated profit, down
from 21.5 times in March 2010. The MSCI Emerging Markets Index
is valued at 11.4 times.  Earnings growth in India for the quarter ended March has
trailed year-earlier levels or missed analysts’ estimates for 10
of the 14 Sensex companies that have reported results so far,
data compiled by Bloomberg show.  SKS Loss  SKS Microfinance Ltd. (SKSM) , the nation’s biggest microlender,
tumbled 18 percent to a record 271.45 rupees after reporting a
wider-than-expected fourth-quarter loss. SKS on May 7 posted a
loss of 697.7 million rupees ($16 million) in the March quarter
on higher provisions for bad debt. That compared with a profit
of 628.9 million rupees in the same period a year earlier.  Tata Consultancy Services Ltd. (TCS) , the largest software
services exporter, dropped 1.2 percent to 1,135.55 rupees.  Wipro
Ltd. (WPRO) , the third-biggest, declined 1.4 percent to 436.15 rupees.
A stronger rupee reduces the value of repatriated earnings of
exporters. India’s three biggest software makers get 80 percent
of their revenue from abroad.  The rupee advanced 0.2 percent to 44.725 a dollar,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The currency may rise
to 44.55 this week, according to  Roy Paul , deputy general
manager at Federal Bank Ltd. in Mumbai.  Overseas investors sold a net 6.23 billion rupees ($139.7
million) of Indian stocks on May 5, paring their investments in
equities this year to 19.5 billion rupees, according to data on
the  website  of the Securities and Exchange Board of  India .  India’s economic growth and corporate earnings lured
foreign investors to buy a record $29.4 billion of local
equities last year and made the Sensex the best performer and
most expensive among the world’s 10 biggest markets.  To contact the reporter on this story:
