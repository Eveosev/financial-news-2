Sweden ’s krona and  Norway ’s krone
strengthened against the dollar for the first day in five as
demand for higher-yielding assets increased.  Sweden’s currency appreciated versus all 16 of its major
peers, advancing most against the yen and the U.S. currency. The
krone gained for a second day against the euro as prices rose
for oil, Norway’s biggest export, and a report showed Norwegian
credit growth accelerated to the highest in 20 months.  “There is some stabilization this morning in the markets
compared to last week, and that is supporting the Scandinavian
currencies,” said Kasper Kirkegaard, a senior currency
strategist at Danske Bank A/S in Copenhagen. “We’ve also seen
stabilization in the oil price. The Swedish krona and the
Norwegian krone trade very positively correlated with risk
appetite.”  The krona was 1.1 percent stronger at 6.2427 per dollar as
of 11:34 a.m. in  London . The currency gained 0.5 percent to
8.9877 per euro. Norway’s krone added 1.0 percent to 5.4772 per
dollar, and was 0.5 percent stronger against the euro at 7.8845.  Crude oil for June delivery increased as much as $3.12 to
$100.30 a barrel in electronic trading on the  New York
Mercantile Exchange . Oil slumped 15 percent last week, the
biggest drop since December 2008.  Norway’s annual credit growth was 6.3 percent in March, the
fastest pace since July 2009 and up from 5.9 percent in
February, data showed today. Growth was expected to be 6.1
percent, according the median estimate of five analysts surveyed
by Bloomberg.  Rate Increase  The nation’s central bank will raise  interest rates  by 25
basis points to 2.25 percent on May 12, according to the median
estimate of 19 economists in a Bloomberg survey. Norges Bank,
which has kept its benchmark rate at 2 percent since May last
year, signaled last month it may start raising borrowing costs
earlier than previously indicated to quell a credit-driven surge
in property prices.  The central bank forecasts Norway’s mainland economy, which
excludes revenue from oil, gas, and shipping, will expand 3.25

dollar, while Sweden’s krona has gained 7.2 percent, according
