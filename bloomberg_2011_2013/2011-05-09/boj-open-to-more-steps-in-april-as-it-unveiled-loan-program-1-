Bank of  Japan  board members left the
door open for more measures to support the economy at a
gathering where they unveiled a lending program for companies
damaged by a record earthquake, according to minutes of the
April 6-7 meeting.  “Members confirmed that the bank would continue to
carefully examine the outlook for economic activity and prices,
including the possible effects of the disaster, and take
appropriate policy action as necessary,” said the minutes,
which were published today in  Tokyo .  The central bank announced a 1 trillion yen ($12 billion)
credit facility for lenders in the earthquake-ravaged area at
the meeting, after having injected a record amount of cash into
the money market and doubled its asset-buying fund in March. BOJ
Governor Masaaki Shirakawa has said the bank is ready to ease
monetary policy further if needed.  One member, who the BOJ didn’t name, said increasing loans
to lenders in the disaster area was “one option” if funds were
insufficient, because “it was difficult to determine the size
of demand for funds among financial institutions in disaster
areas,” the minutes said.  BOJ members expressed opposition to proposals advanced by
ruling and opposition party politicians that it should directly
buy bonds issued by the government for reconstruction to help
finance public debt and to increase private demand.  One member said history shows that underwriting of
 government bonds  led to “severe inflation” and “substantial
damage on people’s living situation.” A few said if confidence
in the yen were hurt due to underwriting, that might lead to
increases in bond yields and may hamper the smooth issuance of
government bonds, according to the minutes.  An earthquake and tsunami that hit northeastern Japan on
March 11 left 24,837 people dead or missing as of May 7,
according to the country’s  National Police Agency .  To contact the reporter on this story:
