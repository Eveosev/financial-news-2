Brent crude  oil, which fell 13 percent
last week, should rebound to $115 a barrel because violence in
northern  Africa  and the Middle East persists, said Christin Tuxen, an analyst at Danske Bank A/S in Copenhagen and the most-
accurate oil forecaster tracked by Bloomberg over eight
quarters.  “You still have tensions in the Middle East area so in
that sense its sell-off has been a bit overdone,” Tuxen said by
phone May 6.  “It was justified down to $115 in our view, but the rest
is not really aligned with the situation in the Middle East and
the fundamentals we have in the market.  ‘‘The situation in the Middle East is not resolved yet and
there is still the risk that we could see the spread to other
oil-producing countries and that justifies that on top of $110
per barrel, fundamental value, we should have at least $5 as a
 risk premium .  ‘‘There is limited scope for us to move any further down,
but I think we could see some upside in  oil prices  in coming
weeks.  ‘‘We are still at elevated levels despite the sell-off.
That is going to slow activity to some degree. That hurts oil
demand, but it also hurts metals demand.’’  Brent crude for June settlement increased $3.85, or 3.5
percent, to $112.98 a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures
Europe exchange by 4:47 p.m. The contract fell as low as $105.15
on May 6.  To contact the reporter on this story:
