Reliance Industries Ltd. (RIL) ,  India ’s most
valuable company, had the capacity to produce 30 megawatts of
solar modules in the financial year ended March 31, the company
said in its latest annual report.  Fuels produced from renewable sources, including biofuels,
are the fastest-growing and their consumption is expected to
expand at 8.2 percent per year to 2030, said the report, which
was sent by e-mail today.  The company’s unit, Reliance Solar Group, set up a 5-
megawatt grid-connected solar power plant in Rajasthan last
July. It has also completed smaller projects placing solar
panels on rooftops, including a 1-megawatt installation at the
Thyagraja Stadium in New Delhi and a 50-kilowatt one at the
Judicial Academy in Chandigarh, according to its  website .  Reliance plans to look into developing new forms of energy,
Chairman  Mukesh Ambani  told the Economic Times in an  interview 
on May 5.  To contact the reporter on this story:
