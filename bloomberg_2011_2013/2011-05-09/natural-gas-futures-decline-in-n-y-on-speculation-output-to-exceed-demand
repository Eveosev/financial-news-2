Natural gas futures dropped for a
sixth day in  New York , the longest losing streak in a month, on
speculation that rising production will outpace demand.  Gas futures slipped 1.9 percent after data from Baker
Hughes Inc. released May 6 showed rigs drilling for the fuel
rose for a second week. The U.S. gas rig total gained eight to
890, the most since April 1.  “As prices crept higher this year, you’ve seen rig counts
come back up,” said Carl Neill, an energy consultant at Risk
Management Inc. in Atlanta. “Coming into 2011, the expectation
was that we’d start to see a decrease in rigs.”  Natural gas for June delivery fell 8.1 cents to settle at
$4.154 per million British thermal units on the  New York
Mercantile Exchange , the lowest settlement price since April 18.
The futures have declined 5.7 percent this year. The last time
gas dropped six straight days was the period starting April 1.  If prices drop below last week’s 200-day moving average of
$4.127 per million Btu, the front-month contract may hit $3.939,
 Stephen Schork , president of the Schork Group Inc., an energy
advisory company in Villanova, Pennsylvania, said in a note to
clients today.  Total marketed gas production may grow 2.4 percent in 2011
to 63.3 billion cubic feet per day, the Energy Department said
April 12 in its  Short-Term Energy Outlook . That level would be a
record, department data show.  Gas consumption may climb 1 percent to 66.75 billion, the
department said.  New York Weather  Below-normal temperatures are likely across most of the
eastern half of the U.S. from May 14 through May 18, according
to Commodity Weather Group LLC in Bethesda,  Maryland . The
cooler-than-normal weather may reduce air-conditioning use,
crimping the demand for gas in  power plants .  “The cooling is not strong enough to trigger exceptional
overnight heating demand, but strong enough to kill daytime
early season cooling demand,”  Matt Rogers , president of
Commodity Weather Group, said in a note to clients today.  The high in New York on May 16 may be 71 degrees Fahrenheit
(22 Celsius), matching the normal temperature, according to
AccuWeather Inc. in  State College , Pennsylvania. The high in
Louisville,  Kentucky , may be 68 degrees, 7 below normal.  U.S. cooling demand may be 48 percent below normal from May
15 through May 19,  David Salmon , a meteorologist with Weather
Derivatives in Belton, Missouri, said in a note to clients
today.  Power plants use 30 percent of the nation’s gas supplies,
according to the Energy Department.  Nuclear Power  U.S. nuclear-power production rose 4.7 percent in the
largest jump in more than five months as operators started
reactors in  New Jersey , Georgia, Texas and Nebraska, the  Nuclear
Regulatory Commission  said. Higher atomic output can reduce the
demand for gas as a power-plant fuel.  Power generation nationwide increased 3,301 megawatts from
May 6 to 73,358 megawatts, or 72 percent of capacity, the
largest increase over three days since Nov. 23, according to an
NRC report today and data compiled by Bloomberg. Twenty-six of
the nation’s 104 reactors were offline.  Public Service Enterprise Group Inc. (PEG)  started the 1,130-
megawatt Salem 2 reactor in New Jersey after shutting it for
refueling and maintenance on April 11. The unit is operating at
65 percent of capacity, the data show.  Gas futures volume in electronic trading on the Nymex was
275,512 as of 2:38 p.m., compared with the three-month average
of 318,000. Volume was 340,758 on May 6. Open interest was
986,789 contracts. The three-month average open interest is
941,000.  The exchange has a one-business-day delay in reporting open
interest and full volume data.  To contact the reporter on this story:
