Bellzone Mining Plc (BZM) , an iron-ore
developer operating in West Africa, fell to an almost six-month
low in London trading after reporting lesser grades at the Kalia
project in Guinea than some analysts expected.  Bellzone dropped 6.3 percent to the lowest closing level
since Nov. 17 after reporting resources of 111 million metric
tons of ore with a grade of 38 percent iron.  “These initial results this morning are likely to
disappoint the market,” Damien Hackett, an analyst at Canaccord
Genuity, wrote in a note. The resource is “well below the
targeted 1 billion tons of direct shipping ore” and the grade
is “well below similar” zones in West Africa, he said.  The company slid 4 pence to 59.5 pence by the 4:30 p.m.
close of London trading after falling to as low as 58.25 pence.
Hackett reduced his price estimate to 200 pence, while keeping a
“buy” recommendation for investors on the stock.  Bellzone, seeking to develop 250 million tons of resources
over 10 years, agreed with China International Fund in August
over financing for an infrastructure project for Kalia of about
$2.7 billion after winning a contract from the  Guinea  government
to develop a 180-mile (290-kilometer) railroad and build a port.  To contact the reporters on this story:
