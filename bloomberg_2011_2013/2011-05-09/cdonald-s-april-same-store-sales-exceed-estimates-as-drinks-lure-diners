McDonald’s Corp. (MCD) , the world’s biggest
restaurant chain, said sales at stores open at least 13 months
rose 6 percent in April as smoothies and McCafe beverages drew
customers in the U.S.  Analysts projected comparable-store sales would rise 4.1
percent, according to the average of seven estimates compiled by
Bloomberg News. Sales in the U.S. climbed 4 percent, the  Oak
Brook , Illinois-based company said today in a statement.  Chief Executive Officer James Skinner said sales increased
6.5 percent in both  Europe  and in  Asia ,  Africa  and the Middle
East. McDonald’s, which debuted frozen-strawberry lemonade in
the U.S. today, plans to introduce a mango pineapple smoothie
this year.  Specialty beverages are “appealing to an even broader
group of customers and bringing in more customers,” Sofia
Therios, a director of marketing at McDonald’s, said in a
telephone interview last week. Beverages make up about one-fifth
of sales at McDonald’s.  McDonald’s, which has about 33,000 locations worldwide, has
increased prices to help make up for rising food costs. The
fast-food chain’s “pricing power” has allowed it to raise menu
prices without hurting customer traffic, Sara Senatore, a New-
York-based analyst at Sanford C. Berstein & Co., said in a
research note today. She rates the shares “outperform.”  March same-stores sales increased 3.6 percent globally.
Comparable-store sales are viewed as a key measure of a
retailer’s growth because they exclude the impact of store
closings and openings.  McDonald’s rose 83 cents, or 1.1 percent, to $79.53 at 9:37
a.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. The shares
had gained 2.5 percent this year before today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
