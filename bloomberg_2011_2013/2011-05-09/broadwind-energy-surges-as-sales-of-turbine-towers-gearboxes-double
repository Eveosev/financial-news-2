Broadwind Energy Inc. (BWEN) , a U.S. wind-
turbine component maker, jumped as much as 12 percent after
reporting that first-quarter sales doubled on increased demand
for its towers and gearboxes.  Broadwind climbed 18 cents to $1.74 at 10:14 a.m. in Nasdaq
Stock Market trading, the most since April 25. That trimmed the
stockâ€™s decline over the past year to 46 percent.  First-quarter revenue more than doubled to $43.5 million
from $21.7 million a year earlier, Naperville, Illinois-based
Broadwind said today in a statement. The company was expected to
have sales of $38.9 million, the average of four analyst
compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
