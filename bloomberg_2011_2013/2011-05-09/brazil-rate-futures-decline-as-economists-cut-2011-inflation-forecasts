Yields on Brazilian interest-rate
futures contracts fell after economists cut their 2011 inflation
forecast for the first time in nine weeks.  Yields on the futures contract due in January 2013 fell
five basis points, or 0.05 percentage point, to 12.51 percent at
1:27 p.m. New York time. The contract due in January 2012
dropped one basis point to 12.28 percent.  Consumer prices will rise 6.33 percent in 2011, compared
with a week-earlier forecast of 6.37 percent, according to a May
6 survey by the central bank of about 100 economists published
today. Economists’ forecasts for inflation next year were
unchanged at 5 percent, the survey showed. Last week’s drop in
commodity prices and government efforts to control rising
ethanol prices convinced the market to lower expectations, said
 Andre Perfeito , chief economist at Sao Paulo-based Gradual
Investimentos.  “We’ve reached a turning point in the expectations,” he
said by telephone. “From now on inflation expectations are
going to be lower. The strong fall in commodities showed that
this element that pressures inflation in  Brazil  so much
shouldn’t be so terrible.”  The UBS Bloomberg index of commodities sank 7 percent last
week, the biggest weekly decline since December 2008. Crude oil
tumbled 15 percent over the period, its biggest weekly drop in
more than two years.  Annual inflation in the 12 months through April was 6.51
percent, slower than the 6.59 percent median forecast in a
Bloomberg survey.  The real fell 0.3 percent today to 1.6202 per dollar, from
1.6149 on May 6.  The currency of  Latin America ’s biggest economy fell after
 Standard & Poor’s  reduced  Greece ’s credit rating, said  Pedro Tuesta , a Washington-based economist for Latin America at 4Cast
Inc. The real sustained its decline as Brazil’s central bank
bought dollars in the spot market today, he said.  Policy makers said they purchased the U.S. currency at
1.6242 reais each. Buying the dollar is part of a regular effort
by the central bank to stem the real’s two-year 27 percent
rally.  To contact the reporters on this story:
