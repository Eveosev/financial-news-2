Turkey  may sell more than double the
amount of five-year inflation-linked bonds from a year ago after
the central bank predicted inflation will accelerate this year
for the first time since 2008.  The Treasury in Ankara may sell between 1 billion liras
($650 million) and 2 billion liras of the five-year bonds today
compared with the 918 million liras it sold in June 2010,
traders and analysts at Garanti Yatirim, Is Invest and Turk
Ekonomi Bankasi AS said. The bonds may yield between 2.1
percentage points and 2.25 percentage points above inflation,
they said.  “CPI-linkers provide attractive returns to investors
during times of rising inflation,” Alper Gokpinar, a bond
analyst at Is Asset Management, Turkey’s biggest wealth
management company, said by telephone.  Turkey is seeking to vary the means by which it borrows as
inflation gained to 4.3 percent last month from a four-decade
low of 4 percent in March, eroding the value of fixed-rate
bonds. The central bank last month raised its 2011 inflation
forecast to 6.9 percent from 5.9 percent.  The Treasury may sell between 1 billion liras and 1.5
billion liras of the CPI-linkers at a yield of about 2.20-2.25
percent, Tufan Comert, a strategist at Istanbul-based broker
Garanti Yatirim, said by telephone. The Treasury will probably
sell 1 billion liras of the bonds and the yield will be 2.1 to
2.15 percent, Selim Gulkan, a trader at Turk Ekonomi Bankasi AS,
said by telephone. Turkey may raise as much as 2 billion liras
in the auction, said Ugursel Onder, an analyst at Is Investment
Securities, Turkey’s biggest broker.  Borrowing Plan  The Treasury says it will borrow 10.8 billion liras ($7.1
billion) in the domestic market this month, including 3.3
billion liras from public institutions. It will also sell three-
year bonds today, benchmark 21-month bills and five-year bonds
tomorrow, and seven-year floating rate notes on May 24.  Yields on benchmark two-year lira bonds rose 1 basis point
to 8.42 percent at 10:03 a.m. in Istanbul, increasing for the
first day in three.  The bank is likely to increase  interest rates  to 6.75
percent in the fourth quarter from 6.25 percent to help contain
inflation, the median forecast in a Bloomberg survey showed.  Inflation was 6.4 percent at the end of 2010 and last
accelerated in 2008, when the rate increased to 10.1 percent
from 8.4 percent the previous year.  The Treasury offered inflation-linked bonds on April 12,
selling 2.01 billion liras of the 10-year debt at a yield of
2.86 percentage points more than inflation. It offered the same
bonds on Feb. 15 and sold 1.89 billion liras at a yield of 2.84
percentage points over inflation.  To contact the reporter on this story:
