Turkish industrial production fell 0.3
percent in March from a month earlier, the second consecutive
decline as the central bank tries to tame a domestic boom.  Output rose 10.6 percent from March 2010 when adjusted for
the number of working days, according to data published by the
government statistics agency in Ankara on its website today.
Without adjustment, the annual increase was 10.4 percent,
compared with a median forecast of 11.3 percent in a Bloomberg
survey of six economists.  The central bank says  Turkey ’s economy is growing too fast,
risking a deterioration in the  trade balance  as imports surge.
It is trying to slow growth from last year’s 8.9 percent by
raising reserve requirements for banks, cutting the amount
available for lending. The central bank has also kept the
benchmark interest rate at a historic low of 6.25 percent, to
deter capital inflows that may strengthen the lira.  “These are good prints for the central bank and strengthen
the argument of growth gradually losing momentum,”  Tevfik Aksoy , London-based head of emerging-market economics for the
region at Morgan Stanley, said in an e-mail. “We keep our rate
call of no hike until the fourth quarter of 2011 unchanged.”  Manufacturing output fell 0.9 percent in March, according
to today’s data. The central bank expects the higher  reserve
requirements  to start taking effect from the second quarter.  To contact the reporters on this story:
