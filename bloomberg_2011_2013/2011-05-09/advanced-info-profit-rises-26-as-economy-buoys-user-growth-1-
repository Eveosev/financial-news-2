Advanced Info Service Pcl (ADVANC) ,  Thailand ’s
biggest mobile-phone company, said first-quarter net income grew
26 percent, exceeding analyst estimates, as an economic recovery
boosted revenue.  Net income was 6.27 billion baht ($207.7 million), or 2.11
baht per share, compared with a restated 4.96 billion baht, or
1.67 baht, in the same period a year earlier, the company said.
That compares with a 5.78 billion-baht median estimate of 14
analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  Thai state-run phone company  TOT Pcl  said Feb. 1 it plans
to seek 76 billion baht in compensation from Advanced Info for
contract changes made during previous governments. Advanced Info
won an arbitration ruling against state-run CAT Telecom for
compensation over excise tax payments, the company said in a
March 9 statement.  Total Access, Thailand’s second-biggest mobile-phone
company, said on April 28 that profit increased 36 percent in
the first quarter as it expanded its network and added customers.  Advanced Info’s total revenue rose 15 percent from a year
earlier to 31.1 billion baht. Its costs rose 12 percent to 18.8
billion baht, according to the company’s filing.  The company will join with  Jasmine International Pcl (JAS)  to
expand its broadband  Internet service , Chief Executive Officer
Wichian Mektrakarn said March 21. The agreement will allow
Advanced Info’s subscribers to use Jasmine’s wireless broadband
Internet service in 15,000 spots nationwide, boosting data
service usage for Advanced Info.  To contact the reporter on this story:
