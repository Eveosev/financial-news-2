Iran ’s unemployed population increases
by about 1.6 million each year,  Shargh  reported, citing
parliamentary member Jalal Mahmoudzadeh.  Iran’s population mostly consists of young people and there
aren’t enough jobs created to match the number of Iranians
graduating from universities each year, Mahmoudzadeh said in a
report published by the Tehran-based newspaper today.  Official figures claim there are 2.5 million unemployed in
Iran which fails to take into account part-time workers, the
newspaper quoted Mahmoudzadeh as saying.  Iran has a population of almost 75 million. Iran’s Labour
Ministry said last year that at least 20 percent of university
graduates are unemployment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
