Finnish lawmakers will be presented
May 10 with a proposal in favor of a support package for
 Portugal , the Finnish state-owned broadcaster YLE reported on
its website.  Kimmo Sasi, the Coalition Party member of Parliament who is
leading the working group on Portugal, said that he believes the
proposal will get support of a majority in Parliament, according
to YLE.                                              â€œThe starting point is that we are together with the
European proposals. My expectation is that the number of real
opponents is now small," Sasi said according to YLE.   Click here for web link  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
