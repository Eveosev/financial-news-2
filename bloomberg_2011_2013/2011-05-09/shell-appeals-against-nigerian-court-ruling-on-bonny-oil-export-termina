Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA) ’s Nigerian unit
has filed an appeal with the Nigerian Supreme Court challenging
a ruling voiding its ownership of the land where its Bonny oil
export terminal is located.  The Court of Appeal in the southern oil industry hub of
 Port Harcourt  on May 5 upheld a 2008 judgment that Shell must
forfeit the Bonny terminal and its land to the island’s native
people after illegally obtaining the title to the property.  “We believe the judgment is wrong,” Shell said today in
an e-mailed statement. “We are also filing to suspend
enforcement of the judgment pending the determination of the
appeal.”  The Bonny terminal is the largest crude export terminal in
 Africa , with a capacity to process and export 1.25 million
barrels of oil daily, according to Shell’s  website . The Bonny
community contends that a 1958 agreement it signed with Shell
made it a tenant, nullifying a 1999 title to the land the
company obtained from the government.  To contact the reporter on this story:
