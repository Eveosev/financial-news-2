Treasury Secretary  Timothy F. Geithner 
said the challenges faced by the U.S. and  China  are “largely
complementary” and don’t conflict with each other.  “The reforms we must both pursue to meet these very
different challenges are not in conflict, and the strengths of
our economies are still largely complementary,” Geithner said
in remarks prepared for the opening session of meetings between
U.S. and Chinese officials in Washington today.  “Our ability to work together is important to the overall
health and stability of the global economy,” Geithner said.
China must “lay the foundation for a new growth model, driven
more by domestic demand,” he said.  -- Editor: Kevin Costelloe  To contact the reporter on this story:
