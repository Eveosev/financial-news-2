Cocoa Processing Co., a Ghanaian
chocolate maker, fell the most in three weeks after saying its
first-half loss through March 31 widened.  The stock tumbled 1 pesewa, or 33.3 percent, to 2 pesewas
by 2:06 p.m. in Accra, the capital. Thatâ€™s the biggest decline
since April 18.  The company reported a loss of 7 million cedis ($4.6
million) compared with a loss of 3.7 million cedis a year
earlier, it said in a statement published on the website of the
Accra-based Ghana Stock Exchange today. Revenue decreased to
42.8 million cedis from 54.6 million cedis, it said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
