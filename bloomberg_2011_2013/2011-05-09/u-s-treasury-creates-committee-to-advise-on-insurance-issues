The U.S. Treasury Department said it
will create a panel to advise regulators on insurance issues
after the industry complained it wasnâ€™t getting enough input on
the Financial Stability Oversight Council.  The Federal Advisory Committee on Insurance will advise the
Treasury Department and the director of the new Federal
Insurance Office, the Treasury said in a statement today.  Industry groups, including the  Property Casualty Insurers
Association of America , have said insurance companies need
greater representation on the oversight council, a group of
regulators created to prevent another financial crisis.  To contact the reporters on this story:
