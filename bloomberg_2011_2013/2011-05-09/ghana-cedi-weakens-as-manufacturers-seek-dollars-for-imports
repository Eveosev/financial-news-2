Ghana ’s currency, the cedi, weakened
the most in five weeks as manufacturers sought dollars to pay
for imports of equipment.  The currency of the world’s second-biggest cocoa producer
weakened 1.2 percent to 1.5265 per dollar as of 2:15 p.m. in the
capital, Accra, from a closing rate of 1.5075 per dollar on May
6, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  “Companies from the manufacturing industry were on the
market today, buying dollars to import equipment,” said Chris Nettey, a currency trader at the local unit of Standard Bank
Plc, in a phone interview.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
