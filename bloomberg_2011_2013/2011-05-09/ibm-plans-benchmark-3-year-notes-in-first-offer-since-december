(Corrects maturity of floating-rate note in last paragraph
of story that ran yesterday.)  International Business Machines Corp. (IBM) 
sold $1 billion of notes that tied for the lowest three-year
coupon this year after the world’s biggest computer-services
provider increased its dividend and share-repurchase program.  The 1.25 percent notes yield 37 basis points more than
similar-maturity Treasuries, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The coupon ties with the rate Colgate-Palmolive Co.,
the largest toothpaste maker, paid on a $250 million sale of
similar-maturity debt last month, Bloomberg data show.  IBM plans to spend about $20 billion on dividends and $50
billion buying back stock through 2015, the Armonk,  New York- 
based company said at an investor meeting in March. Its
quarterly payout will rise 15 percent to 75 cents a share, the
company said in an April 26 statement. IBM added $8 billion to
its stock-repurchase plan, bringing the total authorized by the
board to $12.7 billion.  Proceeds from today’s sale may be used for general
corporate purposes, IBM said today in a regulatory filing.  The company last sold three-year fixed-rate notes in
August, issuing $1.5 billion of bonds with a 1 percent coupon,
the lowest rate on record at the time, Bloomberg data show. The
notes priced at a 30 basis-point spread, the data show.  Colgate-Palmolive’s notes maturing in May 2014 priced at a
30 basis-point spread, the data show.  IBM sold $1 billion of floating-rate notes due 2012 in
December, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. A basis point
is 0.01 percentage point.  To contact the reporter on this story:
