The Qatari emir vowed to “intervene
personally” to resolve the crisis in  Bahrain  during talks
yesterday in Doha with leading Iraqi cleric Moqtada al-Sadr,
according to a statement on Sadr’s  website .  Sheikh Hamad Bin Khalifa Al Thani “has promised to mediate
a solution to the crisis in Bahrain and that he would personally
meet with Arab presidents and kings to resolve this crisis,”
Sadr said in the statement. The emir also said Qatar and Sadr
will form a committee to find solutions for Bahrain and follow
up on the situation, according to the statement.  Bahrain’s government declared a three-month state of
emergency on March 15 after Saudi-led Gulf troops arrived to
help quell protests led by members of the Muslim Shiite majority
for more democracy and civil rights in the kingdom ruled by a
Sunni monarch. Bahrain Human Rights Society says at least 21
people died during the crackdown against the rallies, which were
inspired by the toppling of leaders in Tunisia and  Egypt .  Sadr and other Shiite leaders in  Iraq  have voiced support
for the demonstrators in Bahrain and denounced the intervention
of Gulf troops in the kingdom.  To contact the reporter on this story:
