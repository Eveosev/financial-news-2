The South African government has
denied talk that it is in the process of selling its close to 40
percent stake in Telkom SA, Africa’s biggest fixed-telephone
company. “There’s no basis whatsoever for that,”
Communications Minister Roy Padayachie said during a phone call
on May 7. “There are no talks. There have been no talks.”  Talk Radio 702 reported on May 5 that the government was in
the process of selling its shares to an unnamed Chinese
investor. It didn’t say how it got the information.  To contact the reporter on this story:
