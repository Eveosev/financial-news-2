European stocks retreated after
officials agreed to review the terms of  Greece ’s bailout and
 Standard & Poor’s  downgraded the nation’s credit rating,
reigniting concern about the sovereign-debt crisis.  National Bank of Greece SA (ETE)  led a selloff in financial
shares, dropping 4.1 percent as the cost of insuring Greek debt
climbed to a record.  Centrica Plc (CNA)  led utilities lower after
saying increased taxes will hurt earnings.  MAN SE (MAN)  advanced 1.5
percent after  Volkswagen AG (VOW)  increased its stake in the
truckmaker.  The benchmark Stoxx  Europe  600 Index fell 0.3 percent to
280.43 at 4:30 p.m. in London, extending last week’s 0.9 percent
decline. The measure has still climbed 7 percent since March 16
as companies reported earnings that topped estimates and the
U.S. Federal Reserve pledged to keep  interest rates  low.  “We all know that a lot of these economies are heading
towards default and there is a lot of keeping balls in the air
going on,” Trevor Greetham, director of  asset allocation  at
Fidelity International, said on Bloomberg Television. “The
markets are forcing them to tighten fiscal policy and the
trouble is it’s weakening their economies. Yields are rising and
the more that happens the worse the situation is.”  The yield on Greek two-year  government bonds  gained 25
basis points to 25.58 percent today. Credit-default swaps on
Greece rose 30 basis points to a record 1,371, according to CMA,
signaling a 68 percent probability of default within five years.  National Benchmarks  National benchmark indexes declined in 16 of 18 western
European markets. Germany’s  DAX Index (DAX)  fell 1.1 percent, France’s
CAC 40 slid 1.3 percent and the U.K.’s FTSE 100 slipped 0.6
percent. Greece’s ASE Index retreated 1.5 percent as National
Bank of Greece sank 4.1 percent to 4.72 euros.  The European Union agreed in an unannounced meeting on May
6 to ease the terms of the 110 billion-euro ($158 billion)
lifeline Greece received last year. The gathering followed a
report in Der Spiegel magazine that Greece may withdraw from the
euro. EU officials denied the report and said Greece will need
more aid after investors drove yields on its two-year notes to
more than 25 percent.  Stocks extended their losses after S&P lowered Greece’s
sovereign-credit rating by two levels to B and said further
reductions are possible. Another cut would make Greece the
lowest-rated country in Europe.  Espirito Santo, BBVA  Banco Espirito Santo SA (BES) , Portugal’s biggest publicly traded
bank by market value, dropped 2.7 percent to 2.96 euros and
 Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria SA (BBVA) , Spain’s second-largest bank,
slid 3 percent to 8.19 euros. Bank of Ireland Plc retreated 5.7
percent to 23.2 euro cents.  Credit-default swaps on Ireland reached an all-time high of
676 basis points and contracts on Portugal, Italy, and Spain
also climbed.  HSBC Holdings Plc (HSBA) , Europe’s largest bank by market value,
fell 0.5 percent to 648.2 pence as Chief Executive Officer
 Stuart Gulliver  said it may take as long as three years to meet
its cost-reduction target. Expenses as a proportion of income
rose to 60.9 percent in the first quarter from 49.6 percent.  Centrica declined 3.8 percent to 303.5 pence after the
U.K.’s largest energy supplier said 2011 earnings will grow at a
“more modest” rate than previously expected because of higher
taxes on its production from the North Sea.  Thomas Cook , MAN  Thomas Cook Group Plc (TCG)  dropped 2.9 percent to 165.7 pence
after Europe’s second-largest tour operator said its first-half
loss widened to 166 million pounds ($272 million) because of the
cost of assisting holidaymakers affected by the popular revolts
in north Africa.  MAN limited losses in the Stoxx 600, climbing 1.5 percent
to 97.99 euros after Volkswagen raised its stake in the
truckmaker and said it will boost the holding to as much as 40
percent to forge a deeper alliance between the two companies and
 Scania AB. (SCVB)   VW increased its holding in MAN to 30.47 percent, requiring
Volkswagen to make a mandatory bid for the entire company.
Europe’s largest carmaker offered 95 euros per common share,
less than the May 6 closing price of 96.52 euros. VW shares
retreated 2.2 percent to 127.60 euros in Frankfurt, while
Scania, which has been pursuing a combination with MAN, rallied
3.7 percent to 155.50 kronor in Stockholm.  Misys Plc (MSY)  surged 8.4 percent to 343.5 pence, the biggest
increase in 11 months, as Credit Suisse AG reinstated coverage
of the U.K. provider of software for the financial industry with
an “outperform” rating.  Sophis Risks  “The stock’s current valuation is overly discounting the
risks associated with the integration of Sophis as well as a
turnaround in the company’s core banking software business,”
London-based analyst Frederick Grieb wrote in a report. In
February, Misys closed a deal to buy Sophis SCA to expand its
operations in treasury and capital markets.  Inmarsat Plc (ISAT)  rallied 4.4 percent to 619 pence. The biggest
provider of satellite services to the maritime industry said
first-quarter sales advanced 15 percent, helped by a North
American spectrum-cooperation accord with Philip Falcone’s
LightSquared Inc.  To contact the reporter on this story:
