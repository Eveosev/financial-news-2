China ’s  Yangtze River , site of the
world’s largest hydropower dam, received 40 percent less water
supply at its upstream section this month compared with
historical levels in the past three years, China Three Gorges
Corp. said in a  statement  on its website.  China Three Gorges is releasing water held by the Three
Gorges dam at a rate of 7,000 cubic meters per second to ease a
drought downstream, the Hubei-based dam operator said in the
statement dated May 7. The move to increase supply flows may
last three to four days, it said.  The water level behind the dam will fall below 155 meters
after the operation, Three Gorges Corp. said. The company had
planned last year for the water level to reach 155 meters on May
25, according to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
