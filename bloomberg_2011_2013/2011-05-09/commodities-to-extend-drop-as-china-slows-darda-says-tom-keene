A commodities slump may persist as
efforts to curb inflation in  China  slow demand, according to
Michael Darda, chief econonomist and market strategist with MKM
Partners in Stamford Connecticut.  Stronger reserve requirements in China have led to weaker
demand, Darda said today in an interview on Bloomberg
Televisions’s “Surveillance Midday” with  Tom Keene .  “Commodity increases are likely to reverse in a much more
dramatic way than people are expecting,” Darda said. “China’s
central bank is certainly responsible for that.”  China has raised interest rates four times since mid-
October and boosted lenders’ reserve requirements seven times to
cool inflation. The Standard & Poor’s GSCI Index of 24
commodities plunged 11 percent last week, the most since
December 2008, erasing all the gains since mid-March.  “China’s effort’s seem to be working, leading, in my
opinion, to a decrease in nominal demand,” Darda said.  The Shanghai Stock Exchange Composite Index has declined
6.4 percent from a five-month high on April 18 amid concern the
government will add to increases in lenders’ reserve-ratio
requirements and  interest rates .  Economic data scheduled for tomorrow may show China’s
exports rose 29.5 percent in April, slowing from a 35.8 percent
gain the previous month, according to a survey by Bloomberg
News.  To contact the reporter on this story:
