The former chairman of Torex Retail
Plc was charged in connection with the collapse of the company,
the U.K.’s Serious Fraud Office said.  Christopher Edward Moore was charged with conspiracy to
defraud and false accounting, the agency, which prosecutes
white-collar crime, said in a statement. The U.K. prosecutor
last week also charged three former directors of the company in
connection with the collapse.  “The alleged offenses took place between May 2006 and
January 2007,” the SFO said in the statement. “At the relevant
time Christopher Moore was the chairman at Torex Retail Plc.”  Torex Retail’s shares were suspended from trading in  London 
in January 2007 after the SFO started its investigation. The
probe was followed by overhauls of the company’s management and
it went into administration later that year. Its assets were
bought by New York-based private equity group Cerberus Capital
Management for 204.4 million pounds ($293 million).  Moore’s lawyer, Peter Burrell at Herbert Smith LLP,
declined to comment. Moore was also chief executive officer of
Torex Retail until Sept. 19 2006.  To contact the reporters on this story:
