Jaguar  Land Rover  Plc, the U.K.
carmaker bought by  India ’s  Tata Motors Ltd. (TTMT)  in 2008, is raising
1 billion pounds ($1.64 billion) from pound- and dollar-
denominated high-yield senior notes as low default rates fuel
demand for junk debt.  The company is seeking to sell 500 million pounds and $400
million of bonds due in 2018 and a further $400 million of
securities due 2021, a banker involved in the transaction said.
The proceeds will be used for refinancing existing debt as well
as for “general corporate purposes,” the luxury-car unit said
in a statement. High-yield bonds are rated below Baa3 by Moody’s
Investors Service and lower than BBB- by  Standard & Poor’s .  Jaguar Land Rover is selling bonds as falling default rates
fuel investor appetite for junk debt, helping drive yields
relative to benchmark government debt down 112 basis points this
year to 502, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch index
data. Sales of high-yield debt in  Europe  have risen to 21.6
billion euros this year from 15.8 billion euros in the same
period in 2010, Bloomberg data show.  Tata Motors, which is India’s biggest maker of trucks and
buses, paid $2.4 billion to acquire Jaguar and the Land Rover
sport-utility vehicle brand from Ford Motor Co. in June 2008.
The Mumbai-based company is rated Ba3 at Moody’s Investors
Service and an equivalent BB- at Standard & Poor’s.  The new notes will be guaranteed on an unsecured basis by
Jaguar Cars Ltd., Land Rover, Jaguar Land Rover North America
LLC, Land Rover Exports Ltd. and Jaguar Cars Exports Ltd., the
company said today. Citigroup Inc., Credit Suisse Group AG,
JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Standard Chartered Plc are managing the
sale, the banker said, who declined to be identified before the
terms are set.  The notes due 2018 will be callable after three years and
the 2021 notes callable after five, the banker said. The
securities will be sold following meetings with investors in
Europe and the U.S.  To contact the reporter on this story:
