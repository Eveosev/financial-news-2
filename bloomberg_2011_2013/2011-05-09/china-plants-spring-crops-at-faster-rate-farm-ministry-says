Farmers in  China  are completing the
seeding of spring crops at a faster rate than usual as the
prospects of better returns and improved growing conditions
stoked planting interest, the Ministry of Agriculture said.  As of May 6, farmers had planted 532 million mu (35 million
hectares) of grain crops, about 58 percent of the total
estimated area for this year, the ministry said in a  statement 
on its website. That compares with about 50 percent at the same
time last year, according to the statement.  More than 90 percent of cotton crops have been planted,
while rice crops are also developing better than last year, the
statement said. Rain in northern and southern China in the next
10 days may further accelerate plant development, it said.  --William Bi. Editors:  Richard Dobson ,  Matthew Oakley   To contact the Bloomberg News staff on this story:
