Greece led a surge in the cost of
insuring European  government bonds  as  Standard & Poor’s  cut its
credit rating on concern the nation is heading for a “selective
default” by extending debt maturities.  Credit-default swaps on Greece jumped 30 basis points to a
record 1,371 basis points, according to CMA. Swaps on Ireland
reached an all-time high of 681 basis points and contracts on
Portugal also rose.  “One by one, they will all need to renegotiate,” said
 Bill Blain , co-head of strategy at broker Newedge in London.
“As Europe’s most peripheral economy, Greece is just a canary
in the  coal mine .”  Greece was cut two steps to B by S&P, five levels below
investment grade, and kept on CreditWatch with negative
implications. An extension of debt maturities will be regarded
as “burden sharing” for private investors and constitute a
“distressed exchange,” the ratings firm said.  European leaders are trying to prevent Greece having to
restructure its debt as recession, higher borrowing costs and
weak  tax revenue  more than offset the spending cuts required by
last year’s bailout. Speculation Ireland will renege on its
commitments was fueled by economist Morgan Kelly’s forecast in
the Irish Times, even as central bank Governor Patrick Honohan
said the country will avoid the “doomsday” scenario.  Swaps on Ireland climbed 22 basis points, according to CMA.
Contracts on Portugal rose 16.5 basis points to 659, approaching
the record 681 set April 26.  Italy, Spain  Italy increased 11 basis points to 164 and Spain rose 13 to
259, helping push the Markit iTraxx SovX Western Europe Index of
swaps on 15 governments up 8 basis points to 197.  The cost of insuring corporate debt also rose, signaling
deterioration in perceptions of  credit quality . The Markit
iTraxx Crossover Index of 40 companies with mostly high-yield
credit ratings rose 6 basis points to 359, according to JPMorgan
Chase & Co.  The Markit iTraxx  Europe  Index of 125 companies with
investment-grade ratings rose 2.5 basis points to 98.25,
JPMorgan prices show. The Markit iTraxx Financial Index of 25
banks and insurers increased 6 to 138.5 and the subordinated
index was 14 higher at 242.5.  A basis point on a credit-default swap protecting 10
million euros ($14.3 million) of debt from default for five
years is equivalent to 1,000 euros a year. Swaps pay the buyer
face value in exchange for the underlying securities or the cash
equivalent should a borrower fail to adhere to its debt
agreements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
