Cocoa farmers in Cameroon,  Africa ’s
fourth-biggest producer of the chocolate ingredient, are facing
problems drying their beans, leading to higher-than-acceptable
humidity rates.  Farmers in the South West region, the country’s highest
growing area, need sun to dry their beans because they lack
special ovens for the purpose, said James Mosima, president of
the area’s cocoa association.  The drying period “usually coincides with the period of
heavy rains,” he told reporters in Yaounde, the capital, today.
That means beans have humidity, or moisture, rates of as much as
15 percent, which is above the government’s acceptable rate of 8
percent to 10 percent, Mosima said.  Improper drying can cause beans to develop mold or bad
flavors, according to the London-based International Cocoa
Organization. Cameroon follows  Ivory Coast , Ghana and  Nigeria 
and Africa’s biggest producers of cocoa.  To contact the reporter on this story:
