U.S. stock futures erased gains as the
dollar strengthened versus the euro after  Standard & Poor’s  cut
its rating on  Greece ’s debt.  S&P 500 futures expiring in June rose less than 0.1 percent
to 1,335.50 at 8:57 a.m. in  New York  after earlier rallying as
much as 0.8 percent. Dow Jones Industrial Average futures
increased 0.1 percent to 12,585. The euro was little changed at
$1.4324 after earlier strengthening as much as 0.9 percent.  Greece’s credit rating was cut two levels to B from BB- by
S&P, which said further reductions are possible, with private
investors at risk if maturities are extended on the nation’s
emergency-aid package. Earlier gains in U.S. stock futures came
as commodities rebounded from the biggest weekly decline since
2008, driving the industry’s shares higher.  The  S&P 500  had the biggest weekly decline since March last
week following a rout in raw materials that knocked off $99
billion of market value from commodities. The index is still up
6.6 this year through May 6 amid government stimulus measures
and higher-than-estimated corporate profits. Earnings-per-share
have beaten estimates at 72 percent of the 420 companies in the
S&P 500 that have reported results since April 11, Bloomberg
data show.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
