European gasoline’s premium to Brent,
or crack spread, climbed to its highest in more than a year as
motor fuel stockpiles plunged in the U.S. East Coast, buoying
demand for imports from  Europe .  Hess Corp.’s Hetco unit sold a 20,000 metric-ton diesel
cargo to Glencore International AG. Naphtha’s discount to Brent
narrowed to a three-month low as Glencore bought a naphtha cargo
from Gunvor International AG.  Light Products  Glencore paid $991 a ton for a 12,500-ton naphtha shipment
for delivery to Rotterdam from May 19 to May 23, according to a
Bloomberg survey of traders and brokers monitoring the Platts
pricing window.  Naphtha’s crack narrowed to $3.05 a barrel, the least since
Jan. 25, according to PVM Oil Associates Ltd. data.  European gasoline also gained relative to Brent. Its crack
widened to $13.05 a barrel, according to PVM. That’s the most
since March 17, 2010.  Gasoline stockpiles on the U.S. East Coast dropped 24
percent since the beginning of March, according to Department of
Energy data. That’s more than twice the 11 percent decline in
total motor fuel stocks across the U.S., the world’s biggest
crude consumer. “East coast stocks are well below the
historical average,”  Christophe Barret , an oil analyst at
Credit Agricole CIB, said from London. “That introduces some
tension in the market.”  Gasoline for immediate delivery traded from $1,080 to
$1,101 a ton, according to a Bloomberg survey of traders and
brokers monitoring the Argus Bulletin Board and Platts. Barge
deals, usually of about 1,000 or 2,000 tons, were done from
$1,025 to $1,088 a ton at the end of last week. Those prices are
for Eurobob grade, to which ethanol is added to make finished
vehicle fuel.  Middle Distillates  Gasoil, used mainly in heating, fell for a fifth day. The
contract for May delivery, which expires later this week,
dropped $5.25, or 0.6 percent, to $923.25 a ton on the ICE
Futures Europe exchange as of 5:05 p.m. in  London .  Diesel barges advanced relative to the May gasoil contract
on ICE. Barges changed hands at a premium of as much as $21 a
ton to May futures, more than the highest trade of $18 on May 6.  Hetco sold a 20,000-ton cargo of the fuel to Glencore at a
premium of $25 to May gasoil futures, the Platts survey showed.
That shipment is for delivery to the French port of  Le Havre 
from May 19 to May 23.  Heating oil barges traded at discounts of $3.50 to $4 a ton
to the May ICE gasoil contract, little changed on last week. Jet
fuel traded at premiums from $84 to $88 to May gasoil, the
survey showed.  Residues  Low sulfur  fuel oil  traded from $644 to $646 a ton, while
the high sulfur grade traded from $607 to $609.25 a ton, the
survey showed. Fuel oil is used to power ships and generate
electricity.  To contact the reporter on this story:
