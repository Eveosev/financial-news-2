Saudi Aramco , the world’s largest
state-owned oil company, will supply full contractual volumes of
crude to customers in Europe next month, according to two
refinery officials.  Aramco will provide 100 percent of cargoes sold under long-
term contracts, the officials said, declining to be identified
because agreements with the Saudi company are confidential.  Saudi Arabia exported 610,000 barrels a day of Arab Light
and Extra Light crude to the 24 European members of the
Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development in
January, the  International Energy Agency  said April 12 in its
monthly Oil Market Report. It didn’t ship any Arab Medium and
Arab Heavy grade to Europe, according to the IEA.  To contact the reporter on this story:
