John Connolly, who steps down as
global chairman and U.K. chief executive officer of Deloitte &
Touche LLP at the end of the month, has teamed up with several
former bankers to establish a debt fund management company, the
Financial Times reported, citing unidentified people close to
the matter.  The fund, called Metric Capital, aims to raise 300 million
euros ($430 million) to lend to mid-cap companies with
enterprise values of 50 million euros to 500 million euros, the
newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
