Rains in  Brazil , the world’s second-
biggest soybean grower, may pare output this year and the next
as showers hinder harvesting and reduce seed quality, weather
forecaster Somar Meteorologia’s Marco dos Santos said.  The heavy rainfall will trim this year’s soybean production
by about 1.5 million metric tons to 71.5 million tons, Santos, a
meteorologist at the Sao Paulo-based forecaster, said in a
report sent by e-mail today. Without the showers, farmers would
produce about 73 million tons, he said.  The government expects Brazilian soybean farmers to harvest
72.2 million metric tons of the oilseed this year, up from 68.7
million last year, according to an April 6 Agriculture Ministry
report. The ministry will release an updated report tomorrow.  The excess rains have caused a shortage of soybean seeds in
the South American country, which may force growers to sow
lower-yielding crops for next year’s harvest, Santos said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
