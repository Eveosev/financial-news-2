Thomas Cook Group Plc (TCG) ,  Europe â€™s
second-largest tour operator, said it hedged 88 percent of its
expected jet fuel needs for the six months to October.  The London-based company, which operates 93 planes mainly
in Europe, hedged 65 percent of its fuel needs for the following
six months, its next winter period, said today in a statement.
Those figures were correct as of May 5, it said.  Hedging allows airlines to agree on prices for future fuel
needs and is intended to help guard against cost fluctuations.  To contact the reporter on this story:
