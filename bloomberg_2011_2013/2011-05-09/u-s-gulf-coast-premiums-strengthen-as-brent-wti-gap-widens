U.S. Gulf oil grades strengthened as
the spread between the U.S. benchmark West Texas Intermediate
and Brent widened for the second consecutive day.  The gap between WTI and its European counterpart for June
delivery increased $1.28 to $13.23 a barrel at 2:45 p.m. in  New
York . The differential for the contract nearest to expiration
reached a record $15.94 on Feb. 16.  When Brent gains versus WTI, it strengthens the value of
low-sulfur U.S. grades that compete with West African oil priced
against the European grade.  Heavy Louisiana Sweet’s premium to WTI widened 60 cents to
$14.50 a barrel at 2:04 p.m. in New York, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. Light Louisiana Sweet’s premium gained 65
cents to $15.40 over the benchmark.  Among sour, or high-sulfur, grades, the premium for Mars
Blend widened $1 to $7.50 a barrel over WTI. Poseidon’s premium
strengthened 90 cents to $7.65.  Thunder Horse’s premium gained $2.45 to $12.70 a barrel
over WTI. Southern Green Canyon’s premium strengthened 65 cents
to $5.40 a barrel.  West  Texas  Sour’s discount was unchanged at $2.75 a barrel.
It has tracked more closely to its historical average discount
versus WTI because it’s delivered in Midland, Texas, away from
the  Gulf Coast  and close to Cushing,  Oklahoma , the delivery
point for oil traded on the  New York Mercantile Exchange .  The premium for Syncrude gained 10 cents at $13.20 a
barrel. Syncrude is a light, low-sulfur synthetic oil derived
from the  tar sands  in Alberta.  The discount for Western Canada Select widened 15 cents to
$17.15 a barrel.  To contact the reporter on this story:
