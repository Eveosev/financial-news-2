Indonesia ’s rupiah advanced for a
second day after global funds added to holdings of the nation’s
stocks to benefit from growth in  Southeast Asia ’s largest
economy.  Overseas investors bought $181 million more Indonesian
shares than they sold last week, boosting net purchases to $1.9
billion this year, exchange data show. The currency has gained
4.9 percent in 2011 as the central bank tolerates gains to
contain imported inflation.  “The central bank has been saying for some time it will
allow appreciation in the rupiah,” said Ralph Birger Poetiray,
head of interbank trading at PT Bank DBS Indonesia in Jakarta.
“The sentiment is positive.”  The rupiah advanced 0.2 percent to 8,558 per dollar as of
4:18 p.m. in Jakarta, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Bank Indonesia  is allowing the rupiah to strengthen,
Bambang Brodjonegoro, head of fiscal policy at the  finance
ministry , said in Hanoi last week. Gross domestic product rose
6.5 percent in the first quarter from a year earlier after
having increased 6.89 percent in the previous three months,
official data showed this month.  The yield on Indonesia government’s benchmark 8.25 percent
bond due July 2021 fell one basis point, or 0.01 percentage
point, to 7.72 percent, according to closing prices from the
Inter-Dealer Market Association.  To contact the reporter on this story:
