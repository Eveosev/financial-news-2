Bank Handlowy SA, the Polish unit of
Citigroup Inc., said first-quarter profit climbed 20 percent on
increased fees at its investment and insurance brokerage
business and lower provisions for bad loans.  Net income rose to 181.2 million zloty ($65.9 million) from
150.9 million zloty a year earlier, the Warsaw-based bank said
in a regulatory statement today. That compared with the 179.8
million-zloty mean estimate of five analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg.  Banking profits in  Poland  surged 41 percent in 2010 and the
industry may continue to benefit from an expanding economy,
which is expected to grow by about 4 percent this year and next,
according to government estimates. Banks estimate their combined
earnings will rise about 26 percent in 2011, a  survey  conducted
by the country’s financial regulator said in April.  Handlowy’s fees gained 13 percent to 169.7 million zloty in
the quarter, driven by a sale of investment and insurance
products as well as from brokerage operations, the bank said.
Profit also was boosted by a drop in provisions for bad loans,
which declined 46 percent to 41.9 million zloty.  Total costs in the quarter rose 7.5 percent to 332.1
million zloty on higher spending to promote the lender.  To contact the reporter on this story:
