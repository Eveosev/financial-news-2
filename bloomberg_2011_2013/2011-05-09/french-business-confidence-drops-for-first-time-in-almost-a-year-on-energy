French manufacturing confidence
weakened the first time in almost a year in April, as surging
energy costs and tougher austerity measures across  Europe 
clouded the region’s growth outlook.  The Bank of  France ’s Business Sentiment Indicator for
manufacturers slipped to 107 from 110 in March, the Paris-based
central bank said in an e-mailed statement today. That’s the
first drop since June and the weakest since December.  To contact the reporter on this story:
