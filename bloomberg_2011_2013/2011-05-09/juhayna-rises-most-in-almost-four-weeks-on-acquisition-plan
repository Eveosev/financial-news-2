Juhayna Food Industries (JUFO) ,  Egypt ’s
largest publicly traded producer of packaged milk, rose the most
in almost four weeks after its deputy chief executive officer
said the company is planning an acquisition.  The shares climbed 2.6 percent, the biggest gain since
April 13, to 5.45 Egyptian pounds at the 2:30 p.m. close in
Cairo. The benchmark EGX 30 Index rose 1.1 percent.  Juhayna plans to buy a local company in the food and
beverage business, Nabil Skaria said in an interview late
yesterday in Dubai. “We have two, three that we’re eyeing,” he
said, declining to identify the possible targets.  To contact the reporter on this story:
