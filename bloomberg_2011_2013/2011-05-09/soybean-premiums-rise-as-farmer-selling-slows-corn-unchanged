Cash premiums for soybeans shipped in
May to terminals near  New Orleans  rose relative to Chicago
futures as farmers focused on spring fieldwork instead of
transporting crops. The corn basis was steady.  The spot-basis bid, or premium, for soybeans delivered this
month was 58 cents to 65 cents a bushel above July futures, up
from 58 cents to 64 cents on May 6, U.S. Department of
Agriculture  data  show. The corn basis was unchanged at 56 cents
to 57 cents a bushel.  “We’re probably seeing very little movement from the
farmer,” said Brian Basting, a market analyst at Advance
Trading Inc. in Bloomington,  Illinois . “The weather has been a
nice change of pace, after all the rain we had.”  Soybean futures for July delivery rose 9 cents, or 0.7
percent, to settle at $13.35 a bushel at 1:15 p.m. on the
Chicago Board of Trade. The price gained 39 percent in the past
year.  Corn futures for July delivery rose 21.25 cents, or 3.1
percent, to $7.075 a bushel on the CBOT, capping the biggest
gain since April 29. The grain is up 90 percent in the past 12
months.  To contact the reporter on this story:
