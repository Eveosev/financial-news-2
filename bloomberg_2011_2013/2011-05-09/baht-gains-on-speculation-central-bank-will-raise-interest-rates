Thailand ’s baht rose, rebounding from
a two-month low, on speculation the central bank will raise
borrowing costs again this year, boosting the country’s yield
advantage over developed nations.  Inflation accelerated to a 15-month high in April, rising
4.04 percent from a year earlier, according to official data
released last week. The Bank of Thailand raised its benchmark
interest rate by a quarter of a percentage point to 2.75 percent
on April 20, its sixth increase since June. It next reviews
borrowing costs on June 1. Rates in the U.S. and  Japan  are at a
maximum of 0.25 percent.  “Asia’s growth is stronger and  interest rates  in the
region are being raised, inviting fund inflows,” said  Yuji Kameoka , chief currency strategist at Daiwa Securities Capital
Markets Co. in  Tokyo . “That trend remains intact in the long
term.”  The baht climbed 0.1 percent to 30.22 per dollar as of 8:14
a.m. in Bangkok, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. It
declined by as much as 1.1 percent to 30.57 earlier, the weakest
level since March 3.  Overseas investors bought $907 million more local equities
than they sold this year to benefit from the nation’s economic
growth. Gross domestic product may rise 4.1 percent in 2011,
driving a consumer-price rise of 3.9 percent over the period,
the central bank said on April 28.  The onshore one-year interest-rate swap, the fixed cost
needed to receive a floating payment, rose one basis point to
3.22 percent. The yield on the 3.125 percent debt due December
2015 gained five basis points, or 0.05 percentage point, to 3.45
percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
