Brazil ’s economy has begun
decelerating and should expand by 4 percent this year, less than
its potential of 4.5 percent, said Vladimir Caramaschi, chief
economist of  Credit Agricole ’s Brazilian unit.  “The economy may already be slightly below its
potential,” the economist at Credit Agricole Brasil SA DTVM
said in an interview today at Bloomberg’s Sao Paulo office.
“Retail sales are clearly losing momentum. Credit is no longer
growing with the same vigor.”  The central bank raised its benchmark interest rate for the
third time this year by a quarter-point to 12 percent on April
20. To temper growth and inflation, it also raised banks’
reserve requirements in December, and the government promised to
cut spending in this year’s budget by 50 billion reais ($31
billion).  Brazil will have to keep gross domestic product growth
below its potential “for a while” to keep inflation within its
target in 2012, Caramaschi said. Inflation over 12 months will
remain above the target ceiling until the third quarter and will
reach 6.3 percent by the end of the year, he said. The central
bank’s target is 4.5 percent, plus or minus two percentage
points.  To contact the reporters on this story:
