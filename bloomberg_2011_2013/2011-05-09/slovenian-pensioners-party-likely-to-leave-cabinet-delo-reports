Slovenia’s pensioners party will
probably abandon the coalition government of Prime Minister
Borut Pahor today, leaving it with a minority in parliament,
Delo newspaper  reported , citing party president Karl Erjavec.  Desus, as the pensioners party is known, said last month it
would leave the coalition because the party opposes a proposed
pension overhaul that will increase the  retirement age  to 65
from the current average of 60, the Ljubljana newspaper said.  Pahor’s administration will have 42 lawmakers in the 90-
member parliament if the pensioners group leaves, according to
Delo. That would force it to rely on votes from two minority
representatives and independent lawmakers to pass legislation.  Pahor has said his main priority is to convince people of
the need for the pension overhaul that voters will decide on in
a referendum next month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
