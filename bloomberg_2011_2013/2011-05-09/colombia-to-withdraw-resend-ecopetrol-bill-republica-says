Colombia  will withdraw a bill in
Congress that seeks to sell up to 10 percent of shares in state
oil company Ecopetrol SA and may resend it to Congress later
this week as it seeks to correct procedural problems, Bogota-
based  La Republica  newspaper said, citing Finance Minister Juan
Carlos Echeverry.  Colombia has said it will sell a stake in Ecopetrol to help
fund infrastructure repairs amid rains caused by the La Nina
weather pattern that have killed more than 400 people, left
thousands homeless and destroyed roads and bridges.  To contact the reporter on this story:
