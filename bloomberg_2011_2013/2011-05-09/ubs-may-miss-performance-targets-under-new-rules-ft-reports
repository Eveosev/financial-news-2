UBS AG (UBSN)  is unlikely to meet its
performance targets, which were set in 2009, before the new
Basel III framework was completed and before Swiss regulators
put forward their own additional  capital requirements  for the
bank, the Financial Times reported, citing senior unnamed UBS
bankers.  UBS, which is targeting 20 billion Swiss francs ($22.8
billion) in annual revenues and 6 billion Swiss francs in pretax
profits for its investment bank in the medium term, has no
immediate plans to change its growth plan, the FT said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
