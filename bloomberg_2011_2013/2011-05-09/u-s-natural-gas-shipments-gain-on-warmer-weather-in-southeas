Scheduled natural gas deliveries to
U.S. electricity generators slipped for the first time in ten
days on forecasts of cooler weather that may limit air-
conditioner use. Shipments to the Southeast dropped for the
first time in a week.  A sample of scheduled deliveries to  power plants  in the
U.S. and Canada shows shipments declined 5.3 percent to 16.2
million dekatherms (15.8 billion cubic feet), according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. Shipments to power generators in the
Southeast fell 10 percent to 3.95 million dekatherms.  Scheduled shipments for U.S. residences fell 18 percent to
23.6 million dekatherms.  Wholesale gas at the Sonat-T1 hub, where gas is delivered
from Texas and Louisiana to the Southeast, fell 4.46 cents, or 1
percent, to $4.348 per million British thermal units as of 1:20
p.m. New York time on the Intercontinental Exchange.  Gas at the  Henry Hub  in Erath, Louisiana, the delivery
point for futures traded on the  New York Mercantile Exchange ,
slipped 0.96 cent to $4.3577 per million Btu.  To contact the reporter on this story:
