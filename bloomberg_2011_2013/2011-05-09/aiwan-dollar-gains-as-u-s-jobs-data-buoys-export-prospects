Taiwan ’s dollar rose following last
week’s decline before the government reported that exports beat
economists’ estimates in April.  Overseas shipment climbed 24.6 percent from a year earlier,
more than the 16.7 percent increase in March and better than the
18 percent rise forecast in a Bloomberg survey. U.S. nonfarm
payrolls expanded by 244,000 during the same period, more than
the 185,000 analysts had estimated. Speculation Treasury
Secretary  Timothy F. Geithner  will push for a stronger yuan when
he meets with Chinese Vice Premier Wang Qishan today also buoyed
Asian currencies.  “We’re seeing U.S. dollar weakness after the payroll
numbers on Friday,” said  Henry Lin , a Taipei-based foreign-
exchange trader at Taiwan Shin Kong Commercial Bank. “Regional
currencies were also supported by speculation  China  will let the
yuan gain as it meets with the U.S. in Washington.”  Taiwan’s dollar strengthened 0.1 percent to NT$28.750
against its U.S. counterpart as of the 4 p.m. close, according
to Taipei Forex Inc. The currency was trading 0.6 percent
stronger at NT$28.617 four minutes before the end of trading and
then pared gains on suspected intervention by the central bank,
according to two traders who declined to be identified as the
monetary authority doesn’t usually disclose such details.  Government bonds  were little changed. The yield on the 1
percent note due January 2016, the most-traded government debt,
was 1.090 percent, compared with 1.094 percent at the end of
last week, according to Gretai Securities Market, the island’s
biggest exchange for bonds.  To contact the reporters on this story:
