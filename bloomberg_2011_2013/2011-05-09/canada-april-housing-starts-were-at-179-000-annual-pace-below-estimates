Canadian housing starts fell in April
for the first time in three months, led by multiple-unit
projects in Ontario and  Quebec , government figures showed.  The annual pace of starts was 179,000 on a seasonally
adjusted basis, down 3.1 percent from March’s revised 184,700,
Canada Mortgage & Housing Corp. said from Ottawa today.
Economists forecast a reading of 184,000 according to the median
of 19 responses to a Bloomberg News survey.  The number of urban multiunit homes such as condominiums
fell 5.1 percent to 96,000 in April, today’s report said.
Single-family projects in cities rose 3.4 percent to 64,100, and
rural projects set an 18,900 unit pace.  Housing starts will slow to 177,600 units this year from
189,930 units in 2010, CMHC said Feb. 17. Finance Minister  Jim
Flaherty  tightened mortgage rules earlier this year and warned
Canadians to ensure they can afford to finance their home as
consumer debts reached record levels and  interest rates  are
likely to rise after the global recession.  By province, the decrease in urban housing starts was led
by declines of 9.4 percent in Quebec and 8 percent in Ontario,
the report said.  Separately, the Canadian Real Estate Association today also
said sales of existing homes would decline 1.3 percent this year
to 441,100, less than a February forecast of a 1.6 percent drop,
on stronger-than-expected sales in British Columbia. The group
also said that sales will advance 2.6 percent next year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
