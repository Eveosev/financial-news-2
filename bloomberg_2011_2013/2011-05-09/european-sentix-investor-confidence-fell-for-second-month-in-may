European investor confidence declined
for a second month in May after surging  oil prices  and the
sovereign debt crisis clouded the economic outlook, the Sentix
research institute said.  An index measuring sentiment in the 17-nation euro region
fell to 10.9 from 14.2 in April, Limburg, Germany-based  Sentix 
said in an e-mailed statement today. A gauge of current business
conditions slipped to 23.75 from 25.5, while an indicator
measuring expectations declined to minus 1.25 from 3.5.  Investor expectations “have passed the high point,”
Sentix said in the statement. “The lasting discussion about the
solvency of some euro member states is weighing on sentiment as
well as soaring commodity prices -- in particular for crude
oil.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
