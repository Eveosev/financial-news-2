DekaBank Deutsche Girozentrale, the
 fund manager  for  Germany ’s state-owned savings banks, hasn’t
extended the contract of Walter Groll, the management board
member in charge of capital markets, Financial Times Deutschland
reported, without saying where it got the information.  Stefan Hachmeister, head of the capital markets department,
will also leave DekaBank to lead the capital markets unit at
Landesbank Hessen-Thueringen, the newspaper said, without citing
anyone. Klemens Breuer, the management board member in charge of
capital markets at WestLB AG, may be a potential successor to
Groll, FTD said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
