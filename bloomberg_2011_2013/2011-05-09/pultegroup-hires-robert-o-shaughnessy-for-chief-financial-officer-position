PulteGroup Inc., the largest U.S.
homebuilder by revenue, said it named Robert O’Shaughnessy
executive vice president and chief financial officer.  O’Shaughnessy, who will join the  Bloomfield Hills ,
Michigan-based builder at the end of the month, served since
2007 as chief financial officer of  Penske Automotive Group Inc. (PAG) ,
the second-largest U.S. automotive retailer, PulteGroup said in
a statement today. He will take over from Roger Cregg, who will
retire from the homebuilder on May 27.  “Bob is a proven leader,” PulteGroup Chief Executive
Officer  Richard Dugas  said in the statement. “With nearly 25
years of finance experience and a solid grounding in public
accounting, Bob brings a broad range of expertise to PulteGroup
from which our entire operation will benefit.”  PulteGroup last month reported a narrower-than-expected
first-quarter loss and said it expects to be profitable in the
second half of the year. The builder focused on cutting costs in
the face of weak demand for new homes.  To contact the reporter on this story:
