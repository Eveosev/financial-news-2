(Corrects non-oil exports release date to yesterday in
final paragraph.)  Saudi Arabian shares gained the most
in two weeks after crude oil rebounded from the biggest weekly
decline since 2008.  Saudi Basic Industries Corp. (SABIC) , the world’s biggest
petrochemicals maker, gained 0.9 percent to 108.75 riyals.  Tabuk
Cement (TACCO)  Co., the clinker maker, rose 2.4 percent to 21.05 riyals,
the highest level since October 2009. The  Tadawul All Share
Index (SASEIDX)  advanced 0.8 percent to 6,674.57 as of 2:37 p.m. in
Riyadh. The gauge tumbled 1.6 percent, while Saudi Basic dropped
2.9 percent on May 7.  “A strong rebound in  oil prices  has helped persuade
investors that Saturday’s sell-off in Saudi petrochemicals was
overdone,” said Amro Halwani, a senior trader at Shuaa Capital
PSC in Riyadh. “Driven by China and other emerging nations the
appetite for commodities remains firm with a floor on oil prices
near $100 likely to stay in place as long regional geopolitical
tensions persist.”  Crude for June delivery increased as much as 3.6 percent to
$100.69 a barrel in electronic trading on the  New York
Mercantile Exchange . On May 6, the contract fell 2.6 percent to
$97.18, the lowest settlement since March 15. Saudi Arabia’s
non-oil exports to China increased 34 percent to 1.75 billion
riyals ($467 million) in March from a year earlier, according to
data posted yesterday on the Department of Statistics and
Information’s website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
