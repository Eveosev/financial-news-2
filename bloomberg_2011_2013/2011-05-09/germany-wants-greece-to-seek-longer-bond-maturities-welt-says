Chancellor Angela Merkel’s government
wants  Greece  to negotiate an extension of maturities on its
bonds before receiving a new European Union aid package, Die
Welt  reported , citing officials who participated in a May 6
meeting in Luxembourg.  Germany  is alone in favoring a debt restructuring for
Greece, which would have to be voluntary and conducted in a way
that limits writedowns at euro-region banks, the newspaper cited
unnamed German officials as saying.  The Greek government isn’t doing enough to enforce the
spending cuts and privatizations it accepted in exchange for
help from its euro-region peers, the newspaper cited
unidentified members of Merkel’s coalition as saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
