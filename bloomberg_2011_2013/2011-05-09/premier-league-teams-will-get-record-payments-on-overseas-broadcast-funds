English soccer’s Premier League will
distribute a record amount of money to its 20 teams, with the
last-placed club getting a minimum of 37 million pounds ($60.4
million) and the champions getting more than 51 million pounds.  The increase comes at the end of the first year of the
league’s three-year television contract, which was boosted by
rising funds from overseas broadcast deals. Revenue from
countries outside of the U.K. has almost doubled to almost 1.2
billion pounds.  The contract has turned the English league into the richest
in domestic soccer, generating in excess of 1 billion pounds a
season more than it’s the top divisions in Spain, Germany and
 Italy . It’s also allowed teams to outbid many overseas clubs for
the sport’s top talent.  The money, which doesn’t include match day, commercial and
retail income, is distributed by the Premier League at the end
of the season. Each club receives 13.8 million pounds from its
share of the domestic rights contract, 17.7 million pounds from
the overseas pool and 752,000 pounds per position in the league.
They also get a minimum of 4.85 million pounds in so-called
facility fees for matches broadcast live in the U.K. One
broadcast is worth 485,000 pounds.  About 16 million pounds is paid to each team relegated to
soften the effect of the change in revenue from the top division
to the second tier.  Last-placed Portsmouth received 31.9 million pounds in
broadcast funds last year, when it was relegated.  To contact the reporter on this story:
