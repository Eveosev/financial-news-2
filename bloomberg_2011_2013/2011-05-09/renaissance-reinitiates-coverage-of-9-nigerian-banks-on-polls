Renaissance Capital , the Russian
emerging-markets bank with operations in Africa, reinitiated
coverage of six Nigerian banks with “buy” ratings after the
end of general elections in Africa’s most populous nation.  “The recent election cycle has, on balance, been positive,
and should shift market focus away from political risk,”
analysts David Nangle, Adesoji Solanke and Armen Gasparyan wrote
in an e-mailed note to clients today. “Credit growth has
started to recover and should deliver 15 percent sector-wide in
fiscal 2011, while margins should see upward pressure from a
rising-rate environment.”  Renaissance recommended buying shares of  Fidelity Bank Plc (FIDELITY) ,
 First City Monument Bank Plc (FCMB) ,  First Bank of Nigeria Plc (FIRSTBAN) , Skye
Bank Plc,  United Bank for Africa Plc (UBA) , and  Zenith Bank Plc. (ZENITHBA)  It
reinitiated coverage of  Access Bank Plc (ACCESS) ,  Diamond Bank Plc (DIAMONDB)  and
 Guaranty Trust Bank Plc (GUARANTY)  with “hold” recommendations.  Nigeria’s ruling People’s Democratic Party retained a
majority in national legislative and state-governor elections
last month that were called the cleanest in a decade in Africa’s
top oil producer, according to results released by authorities.  To contact the reporter on this story:
