Silver futures rebounded from the
biggest weekly slump since at least 1975 and gold gained on
renewed demand for precious metals as alternative assets.  The Standard & Poor’s GSCI Index of 24 commodities declined
11 percent last week, the most since December 2008, led by the
27 percent tumble in silver futures. The 14-day relative
strength index for silver dropped to 34 from 90 in two weeks, a
signal to some traders that the metal may be reaching oversold
conditions.  “Gold and silver may regain strength as traders perceive
last week’s commodities washout to be excessive and it isn’t
viewed as a trend reversal,” said Park Jong Beom, Seoul-based
trader with Tongyang Futures Co. “There’s no change in the
outlook for a weaker dollar as well.”  Silver futures for July delivery advanced $1.829, or 5.2
percent, to settle at $37.116 an ounce at 2:09 p.m. on the Comex
in  New York , the biggest gain for a most-active contract since
November.  Gold futures for June delivery rose $11.60, or 0.8 percent,
to $1,503.20 an ounce on the Comex after last week slipping 4.2
percent, the most in almost a year. The metal reached a record
$1,577.40 on May 2.  Greece Rating Cut  Prices also gained after Standard & Poor’s cut Greece’s
credit rating two levels, saying further reduction are possible
as the risk of default rises. Silver has doubled in the past
year and gold jumped 25 percent, partly as global debt concerns
boosted investor demand.  “Despite last week’s sell-off, very little has changed in
terms of fundamentals,” said Tom Pawlicki, an analyst at MF
Global Ltd. in  Chicago .  Still, silver dropped as much as 34 percent from a 30-year
high of $49.845 set on April 25 after Comex owner  CME Group Inc. (CME) 
announced an 84 percent rise in margin requirements. A  bear
market  is defined by some investors as a decline of 20 percent
or more. Holdings in exchange-traded products backed by the
metal tumbled 1.2 percent to 14,367.77 metric tons on May 6, the
lowest level in six months, Bloomberg data show.  Speculators’ “stampede for the exit was responsible for
last week’s ugly descent,”  Edel Tully , an analyst at UBS AG in
 London , said today in a report to clients. “We don’t believe
that investors and speculators have completely altered their
outlook for silver, however, and though hopes for $50 have
suffered a blow, they have not disappeared.”  Palladium futures for June delivery rose $12.70, or 1.8
percent, to $729 an ounce on the  New York Mercantile Exchange .
Platinum futures for July delivery climbed $8.70, or 0.5
percent, to $1,795.10 an ounce on Nymex.  To contact the reporters on this story:
