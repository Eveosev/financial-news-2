(Corrects claims estimate for  Japan  in fifth paragraph.)  Hiscox Ltd. (HSX) , the second-biggest
Lloyd’s of  London  insurer by market value, said first-quarter
sales fell 8 percent amid a “tough” market.  Gross written premiums declined to 453.5 million pounds
($743.4 million) in the year to March 31 compared with 504.1
million pounds a year earlier, the Hamilton, Bermuda-based firm
said today in a statement.  “We continue to underwrite for profit over volume in these
tough market conditions,” Chief Executive Officer Bronek Masojada said in the statement.  Hiscox, like other Lloyd’s insurers, was hurt by Japan’s
biggest earthquake on record earlier this year, estimated to
cost the industry between $21 billion and $34 billion, according
to catastrophe modeler Risk Management Solutions. Earthquakes in
 New Zealand  and flooding in Australia at the end of 2010 and
beginning of this year had already dented insurers’ catastrophe
reserves before the Japanese quake on March 11.  Hiscox said its claims estimate for the New Zealand
earthquake was unchanged at 60 million pounds. Its claims
estimate for the Japanese earthquake was also unchanged at
between $60 million and $150 million.  To contact the reporters on this story:
