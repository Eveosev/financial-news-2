Copper rose, rebounding from a five-
month low, after Goldman Sachs Group Inc. said commodities may
recover from an 11 percent slump last week.  The Standard & Poor’s GSCI Index of 24 raw materials rose
as much as 4.1 percent. “Given the magnitude of the pullback,
it does create an opportunity for more upside potential,”
Goldman Sachs said. A month ago, the bank told investors they
should be “underweight” in commodities. Copper fell 4.9
percent last week.  “People look at the sell-off as a little bit overdone,”
said  Matthew Zeman , a strategist at Kingsview Financial in
 Chicago . “There’s some buying based on the Goldman comments as
well.”  Copper futures for delivery in July rose 4.1 cents, or 1
percent, to close at $4.0165 a pound at 1:13 p.m. on the Comex
in  New York . On May 6, the price touched $3.928, the lowest for
a most-active contract Dec. 1. The metal reached a record
$4.6575 on Feb. 15.  Prices also got “a shot in the arm confidence-wise” after
a May 6 report showed U.S. payrolls exceeded economists’
forecasts last month, Zeman said.  “The markets were due for correction, but not of that
magnitude,” said  Robin Bhar , an analyst at Credit Agricole SA
in  London . “We’re getting some bargain-hunting from end-users
because it is the second quarter, which is a seasonally stronger
period.”  On the London Metal Exchange, copper for delivery in three
months rose $60, or 0.7 percent, to $8,890 a metric ton ($4.03 a
pound).  Aluminum, zinc, lead and tin rose in London. Nickel fell.  To contact the reporters on this story:
