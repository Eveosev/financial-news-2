The Democratic Republic of Congo’s
Minister of University and Higher Education escaped an attack by
Rwandan rebels that left two people dead, government spokesman
Lambert Mende said.  Rebels from the Democratic Forces for the Liberation of
 Rwanda  opened fire on a vehicle carrying Leonard Mashako Mamba
near the town of Rutshuru in Congo’s eastern North Kivu province
on May 7, killing his driver and a bodyguard, Mende said by
phone today from Kinshasa, the capital.  “We don’t know if he was being targeted,” Mende said. The
assailants stole the minister’s belongings, he said.  United Nations -backed military operations by Congo’s army
against the rebel group in the east have helped reduce its
numbers by at least 60 percent to 2,500 since 2009, according to
the UN. Last year, a UN-run program demobilized 1,881 FDLR
rebels, while 444 rebels surrendered to the UN between January
and March of this year, according to the UN.  The army will pursue its operations against the rebels to
force them to disarm and return to Rwanda or be resettled within
Congo, Mende said.  Ethnic Hutu rebels first fled to eastern Congo in 1994
after the  Rwandan genocide , in which 800,000 ethnic-Tutsis and
moderate Hutus were killed in a 100-day massacre. They formed a
succession of rebel groups, including the FDLR.  To contact the reporter on this story:
