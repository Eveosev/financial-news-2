Wheat and soybeans rose for a second
day in Chicago as the biggest slump in commodities in more than
two years lured buyers amid concerns about tightening global
supplies.  Hot, dry weather early this week may increase the risk to
the winter-wheat crop in the central and southern Plains of the
U.S., Telvent DTN Inc. said in a May 6 forecast. Winter-wheat
areas in western Europe and central  China  also need rain, the
forecaster said. The Standard & Poor’s GSCI Index of 24
commodities lost 11 percent last week, the most since December
2008.  “Planting delays should prevent prices from retreating
further” for corn, soybeans and spring wheat, said  Carsten Fritsch , an analyst at Commerzbank AG in  Frankfurt . “Given
concerns about serious crop losses, wheat prices have fared much
better in the negative market environment.”  Wheat for July delivery gained 17.25 cents, or 2.3 percent,
to $7.7675 a bushel by 1:56 p.m. London time on the Chicago
Board of trade. A close at that price would be the biggest daily
advance since April 29. The grain slid 5.2 percent last week,
the most since the week ended April 15.  Milling wheat for May delivery traded on NYSE Liffe in
Paris climbed 15 euros, or 6.3 percent, to 255 euros ($365) a
metric ton. Soybeans for July delivery increased 8.5 cents, or
0.6 percent, to $13.345 a bushel in  Chicago  after sliding 4.9
percent last week.  Corn for July delivery gained 10.25 cents, or 1.5 percent,
to $6.965 a bushel, rebounding from last week’s 9.3 percent
slump. The S&P GSCI index advanced 1.6 percent to 685.14 points.  ‘Massive Unwinding’  “We had a massive unwinding of long commodity trades last
week, and the grains markets took the brunt of the selloff,”
 Jonathan Barratt , managing director at Commodity Broking
Services Pty in Sydney, said in an e-mail. The market remains
concerned about the lack of available stockpiles and the
weather, he said.  Drought conditions may persist through mid-May in wheat-
growing areas from China, the world’s largest grower and
consumer, to the U.S. and western  Europe , hurting crops and
lifting prices, British Weather Services said May 5.  The International Grains Council last month  cut  its outlook
on global wheat production in the 2011-12 season by 1 million
tons to 672 million tons, matching global demand, because of
“less than ideal conditions for some crops” in the U.S., the
European Union and China.  The council acted before France’s Agriculture Ministry said
the nation had its second-hottest April since 1900 and one of
the driest since 1953. France is the largest wheat grower in the
27-country European Union.  French Wheat  The EU wheat harvest, which accounts for a fifth of world
production, will fall this year as drought cuts yields in  France 
and  Poland , Michel Portier, general director of Paris-based farm
adviser Agritel, said May 6.  The winter-wheat harvest in  Kansas , the biggest producer of
that variety in the U.S., may drop to 256.7 million bushels from
360 million bushels last year, according to a survey of 55
analysts, millers and industry officials on the tour of fields
conducted by the Wheat Quality Council.  Across the U.S., the largest exporter, the winter-wheat
harvest may fall 3 percent to 1.441 billion bushels this year as
dry weather persists,  Memphis , Tennessee-based Informa Economics
Inc. said in a report May 6. Farmers may abandon 9 million acres
of winter wheat this year, the most since 2007, it said. Winter
wheat accounted for about two-thirds of the total U.S. output of
the grain last year.  About 45 percent of the crop in  Kansas  was in very poor or
poor condition as of May 1, the most since 1996, according to
the  U.S. Department of Agriculture .  Corn Planting  Corn sowing in the U.S., the world’s largest grower and
exporter of the grain, has been delayed after excessive rains
left some Midwest fields too wet for heavy farm machinery.  About 13 percent of the corn crop was planted as of May 1,
the USDA said in a report a day later. That’s the slowest pace
since 1995, when only 10 percent of the crop was planted,
according to USDA data tracked by Bloomberg. The average for
that time of the year was 40 percent between 2006 and 2010, the
USDA said.  The USDA will release its next update on planting progress
at 4 p.m. in  Washington  today.  To contact the reporters on this story:
