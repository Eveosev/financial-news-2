Mitsubishi Estate Co.,  Japan â€™s second-
biggest developer, said it expects profit to drop 14 percent
this business year as apartment sales slow following a record
earthquake.  Net income will decline to 55 billion yen ($683 million) in
the year ending March 2012 from 64.2 billion yen last fiscal
year, the company said in a statement to the Tokyo Stock
Exchange today.  The developer joins bigger rival Mitsui Fudosan Co. in
forecasting lower net income this year as demand for  office
space  and new homes weakens after Japan was struck by a
magnitude 9 earthquake on March 11. Mitsubishi Estate said
apartment sales are likely to drop 16 percent to 311 billion
yen.  Shares of the Tokyo-based company, which have lost 11
percent since the quake, declined 1 percent to 1,453 yen at the
close of Tokyo Stock Exchange trading.  Net income climbed to 64.2 billion yen in the 12 months
ended March 31 from 11.9 billion yen a year earlier, the company
said today. Profit for the period ended March 2010 was the
lowest in eight years because of losses from equity investments
and declining land values.  Sales will decline 1.2 percent to 977 billion yen in the
current fiscal year, according to the statement. They dropped
2.5 percent to 988.4 billion yen last year.  Mitsui Fudosan on April 28 forecast net income will
decrease 5.8 percent to 47 billion yen in the year through March
2012. It expects sales to be little changed at 1.4 trillion yen.  To contact the reporters on this story:
