Japanese and stock futures fell after
Greece’s credit rating was cut two levels by Standard & Poor’s,
pushing the yen higher amid waning confidence about the global
economy. Australian futures were little changed.  American depositary receipts of  Toyota Motor Corp. (7203) , the
world’s largest carmaker, and those of  Sony Corp. (6758) , Japan’s No. 1
electronics exporter, both declined 0.3 percent from the closing
share price in Tokyo. ADRs of  Foster’s Group Ltd. (FGL)  , Australia’s
biggest brewer lost 0.7 percent, while  BHP Billiton Ltd. (BHP) , the
world’s biggest mining company, climbed 0.3 percent as commodity
prices rebounded.  Futures on Japan’s  Nikkei 225 (NKY)  Stock Average expiring in
June closed at 9,785 in Chicago yesterday, compared with 9,815
in Singapore. The futures were bid in the pre-market at 9,790 in
Osaka, at 8:05 a.m. local time. Futures on Australia’s S&P/ASX
200 Index were little changed at 4,761 today. New Zealand’s NZX
50 Index increased 0.2 percent in Wellington.  “The Greek’s debt rating cut will likely again boost
concerns about the country’s deteriorating finance and the yen’s
strength,” said Fumiyuki Nakanishi, a strategist at Tokyo-based
SMBC Friend Securities Co.  Futures on the  Standard & Poor’s  500 Index were little
changed today. In New York, the index gained 0.5 percent to
1,346.29 yesterday, advancing for a second straight day, as
commodity prices rebounded from the biggest weekly drop since
2008 and McDonald’s Corp., the world’s No. 1 restaurant chain,
rallied after sales topped estimates.  Crude Oil   Crude oil for June delivery jumped 5.5 percent to settle at
$102.55 a barrel yesterday in New York, the biggest one-day gain
since Feb. 22. The London Metal Exchange Index of six metals
including copper and aluminum advanced for a second day, rising
0.4 percent yesterday.  In Europe, Greece’s credit rating was cut two levels to B
from BB- by Standard & Poor’s, which said further reductions are
possible as the risk of default rises. Another cut would make
 Greece  the lowest-rated country in Europe. Yesterday’s reduction,
the fourth by S&P since April 2010, left it even with Belarus.
Also, Moody’s Investors Service yesterday placed Greece’s B1
rating on review for a downgrade.  The euro fell against half its major counterparts after
Standard & Poor’s cut Greece’s credit rating, renewing concern
the region’s debt crisis is worsening.  Yen Rises  The yen appreciated to as high as 115.03 against the euro
last night in Tokyo, compared with 115.97 at the close of  stock
trading  yesterday. Against the dollar, Japan’s currency
strengthened today to 80.19 from 80.63. A stronger yen reduces
overseas income at Japanese companies when converted into their
home currency.  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index fell less than 0.1 percent this
year through yesterday, compared with gains of 7 percent by the
 S&P 500  and 1.7 percent by the Stoxx Europe 600 Index. Stocks in
the Asian benchmark are valued at 13.5 times estimated earnings
on average, compared with 13.6 times for the S&P 500 and 11.3
times for the Stoxx 600.  Today, 39 of the 1,022 companies in the MSCI index are
scheduled to release earnings statements. Of the 415 companies
that have reported results for the latest quarter, 160 have
exceeded analysts’ estimates, while 160 have missed them,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporters on this story:
