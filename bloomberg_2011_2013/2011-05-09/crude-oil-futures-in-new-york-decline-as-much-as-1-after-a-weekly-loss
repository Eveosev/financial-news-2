Oil fell from a three-day high in  New
York  as investors sold contracts to profit from the biggest
price surge since February, amid speculation U.S. crude
stockpiles increased to near the highest in two years.  Futures dropped as much as 2.4 percent before an Energy
Department report tomorrow that may show inventories climbed for
a third week. Prices also slipped after CME Group Inc. raised
margins, or the amount of money traders must hold as collateral
for their transactions, for futures trading in New York. Oil
surged 5.5 percent yesterday after the biggest weekly decline
since December 2008.  “It’s just profit taking,” said  Jonathan Barratt ,
managing director of Commodity Broking Services Pty in Sydney,
who predicted oil will average $100 a barrel this year. “It’s a
technical bounce from that huge move we had the other day.
Expect the volatility to continue. It’s across the board with
the other commodities.”  Crude for June delivery slid as much as $2.43 to $100.12 a
barrel in electronic trading on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange . It was at $101.22 at 2:42 p.m. Singapore time. The
contract rose 5.5 percent to $102.55 yesterday, the most since
Feb. 22.  Brent crude  for June settlement on the London-based ICE
Futures Europe exchange fell as much as $2.32, or 2 percent, to
$113.58 a barrel. Yesterday, it jumped 6.2 percent to $115.90.  Margin Increase  CME Group, the Nymex owner, increased margins for crude
speculators to $8,438 per contract from $6,750, effective after
the close of business today. Heating-oil margins will rise to
$8,438 from $6,413, and gasoline margins will climb to $9,450
from $7,763.  Crude also dropped as the dollar gained, damping the
investment appeal of commodities. The Dollar Index, a measure of
the greenback against six major currencies, climbed as much as
0.4 percent to 75.005.  The dollar and oil have moved in the opposite direction
about 86 percent of the time over the past month, according to
Bloomberg calculations of the two instrument’s correlation.  U.S. crude stockpiles increased 1.5 million barrels from
366.5 million in the week ended May 6, according to the median
of 11 estimates from analysts surveyed by Bloomberg News before
tomorrow’s Energy Department report. Gasoline inventories are
expected to have declined 750,000 barrels from 204.5 million.
The industry-funded  American Petroleum Institute  will publish
its own data today.  China Imports  China’s net crude imports rose 3 percent in April from a
month earlier as refineries increased fuel production to supply
to factories in the world’s fastest-growing major economy.  Net imports advanced to 21.25 million metric tons last
month, or 5.2 million barrels a day, according to Bloomberg
calculations based on  data posted  today on the website of the
Beijing-based General Administration of Customs. Net inbound
shipments gained 1.3 percent from a year earlier.  Brent, the European and African benchmark, traded at a
premium of $13.59 a barrel to U.S. futures, the highest since
April 18. The difference between front-month contracts in  London 
and New York surged to a record $19.54 on Feb. 21. It averaged
76 cents last year.  Brent has rallied 21 percent this year as unrest in the
Middle East and North Africa toppled leaders in Tunisia and
 Egypt  and disrupted exports from  Libya . Security forces in  Syria 
renewed their assault on pro-democracy protesters across the
country, shooting at people who joined in demonstrations and
seeking to arrest their organizers.  To contact the reporter on this story:
