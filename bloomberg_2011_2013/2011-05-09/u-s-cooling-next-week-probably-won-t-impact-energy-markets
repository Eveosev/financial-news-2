The cool weather that is forecast to
return to the eastern U.S. next week isn’t expected to have much
of an impact on energy markets, according to  Matt Rogers ,
president of  Commodity Weather Group LLC .  Rogers is calling for cool air to spread from the Great
Lakes southward into Alabama and  Georgia  and eastward into the
Northeast from May 14 to May 18. California is expected to cool
at the same time.  “The cooling is not strong enough to trigger exceptional
overnight heating demand, but strong enough to kill daytime
early season cooling demand,” Rogers said in a note to clients
today.  Natural-gas traders monitor  weather forecasts  to determine
whether temperatures may boost heating or cooling demand.
Predictions of below-normal or above-normal temperatures may
prompt traders to buy or sell gas futures. Commodity traders
watch precipitation forecasts for impact on planting and yields.  In his 11- to 15-day outlook, Rogers calls for warmer-than-
normal or seasonal temperatures across the U.S. with the
exception of the West Coast, which will probably be cooler.  To contact the reporter on this story:
