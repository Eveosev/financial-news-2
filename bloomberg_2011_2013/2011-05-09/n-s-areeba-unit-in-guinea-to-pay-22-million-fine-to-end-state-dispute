MTN Group Ltd. (MTN) ’s Areeba unit has sent
the Guinean government a letter agreeing to pay a 15-million
euro ($22 million) penalty within 10 days, said Oye Guilavogui,
the country’s telecommunications minister.  The assets of the company will remain in the custody of the
government until the dispute has been resolved, Guilavogui said
today on state-owned Conakry-based Radio Television Guineene.  MTN spokesman  Rich Mkhondo  said the dispute with the
Guinean government is resolved. “That is all we know at this
stage and I can’t say if the fine was paid or not paid,” he
said. “Business was never interrupted, though we weren’t in
control of our operations for about a week,” Mkhondo said by
phone from Johannesburg.  MTN, Africa’s biggest mobile-phone company, bought Areeba
as part of a $5.53 billion 2007 merger with Middle Eastern
mobile-phone company Investcom LLC. The dispute related to fees
allegedly owed to authorities, MTN said May 6.  To contact the reporter on this story:
