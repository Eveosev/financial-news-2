German Health Minister Philipp Roesler, a Free Democrat, may switch jobs, taking on the role of
economy minister from his party colleague, Rainer Bruederle, the
 Deutsche Presse-Agentur  newswire reported, citing unnamed
officials.  Roesler may be succeeded in his current job by Deputy
Health Minister Daniel Bahr, while Bruederle would drop out of
the Cabinet to become the head of the Free Democratic Party in
parliament, the newswire said.  The party, Chancellor  Angela Merkel ’s junior coalition
partner, is reshuffling top posts in its hierarchy in a bid to
rekindle voter support. Roesler, a 38-year-old physician born in
 Vietnam , is scheduled to be elected as the FDP’s new chairman at
its annual congress on May 13.  To contact the reporter on this story:
