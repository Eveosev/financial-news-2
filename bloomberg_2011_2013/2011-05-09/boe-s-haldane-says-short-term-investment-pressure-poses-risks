Bank of England official  Andrew Haldane  said authorities should address pressure on investors to
make short-term gains as this is undermining important long-term
investment.  The pressure tends “to result in investment being too low
and in long-duration projects suffering disproportionately,”
said Haldane, who is executive director for financial stability
at the London-based central bank.  “This might include projects with high build or sunk
costs, including infrastructure and high-tech investments,” he
said. “These projects are often felt to yield the highest long-
term -- private and social -- returns and hence offer the
biggest boost to future growth. That makes short-termism a
public policy issue.”  Among the remedies Haldane suggests are greater
transparency in firms’ investment intentions, or penalties,
perhaps through taxes or subsidies, on short-term holdings of
securities. He made the remarks in a speech to be delivered in
Brussels on May 11 and published by the central bank today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
