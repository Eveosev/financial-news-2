About 200,000 municipal workers in
 South Africa  will go on strike on May 13 after their demands for
an 18 percent wage increase werenâ€™t met, Reuters reported,
citing Tahir Sema, a spokesman for the South African Municipal
Workers Union.  Municipal workers who also want the government to abolish
labor brokers will strike for five days before local government
elections on May 18, the  news agency  said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
