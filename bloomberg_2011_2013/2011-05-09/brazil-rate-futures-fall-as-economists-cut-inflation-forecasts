Yields on Brazilian interest-rate
futures contracts fell after economists cut their inflation
forecast for the first time in nine weeks.  Yields on the futures contract due in January 2013 dropped
three basis points, or 0.03 percentage point, to 12.53 percent
at 5 p.m. New York time.  Consumer prices will rise 6.33 percent in 2011, compared
with a week-earlier forecast of 6.37 percent, according to a May
6 survey by the central bank of about 100 economists published
today. Economists’ median forecast for inflation next year held
at 5 percent, the survey showed. Last week’s drop in commodity
prices and government efforts to control rising ethanol prices
convinced the market to lower expectations, said  Andre Perfeito ,
chief economist at Sao Paulo-based Gradual Investimentos.  “We’ve reached a turning point in the expectations,”
Perfeito said. “From now on inflation expectations are going to
be lower. The strong fall in commodities showed that this
element that pressures inflation in  Brazil  so much shouldn’t be
so terrible.”  The UBS Bloomberg index of commodities sank 7 percent last
week, the most since December 2008. Crude oil tumbled 15 percent
over the period, its biggest weekly drop in more than two years.  Annual inflation in the 12 months through April was 6.51
percent, slower than the 6.59 percent median forecast in a
Bloomberg survey.  Yields on longer-term contracts also declined after the
National Industrial Confederation said manufacturers reduced the
use of installed capacity to 82.4 percent in March from 83.4
percent in February. Economists surveyed by Bloomberg expected
83.5 percent, according to the median of six forecasts.  The yield on the contract due in January 2017 fell seven
basis points to 12.38 percent.  The real was little changed today at 1.6141 per dollar,
from 1.6149 on May 6.  Brazil’s central bank said it twice bought dollars in the
 currency market  as part of an effort to stem the real’s two-year
28 percent rally.  To contact the reporters on this story:
