The U.S. is still considering how to
assist the Egyptian economy and help the country’s transition to
democracy after the ouster of President  Hosni Mubarak , the U.S.
Embassy in Cairo said today.  The embassy was responding to an article in the Washington
Post that cited unidentified officials as saying that the
administration of President  Barack Obama  decided to provide
Egypt with about $1 billion in debt relief.  “We are still in the process of consultations over how the
U.S. may assist Egypt economically as it moves forward in its
transition to democracy,” the mission said in an e-mailed
statement.  Mubarak’s three-decade rule ended when he ceded power on
Feb. 11 after 18 days of mass protests. The crisis may slow
economic growth in the fiscal year that ends next month to 2.1
percent from 5.1 percent in the previous 12 months, Finance
Minister Samir Radwan said May 4.  The yield on  Egypt ’s 10-year 5.75 percent dollar bond
maturing in April 2020 rose 5 basis points, or 0.05 percentage
point to 6.32 percent.  The Egyptian pound rose 0.1 percent to 5.9382 against the
dollar at 2:07 p.m. in Cairo, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The currency appreciated to 5.9373 earlier, the
strongest level since March 22.  To contact the reporters on this story:
