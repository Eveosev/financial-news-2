The following companies are having
unusual price changes in Argentine trading. Stock symbols are in
parentheses and share prices are as of 12:47 p.m. New York time.  The Merval Index was little changed at 3,315.93.  Banco Macro (BMA AR),  Argentina ’s largest lender by market
value, fell 1.6 percent to 15 pesos, its lowest price since
Sept. 8, as Argentine sovereign bond prices dropped today,
signaling lower values for banks’ fixed-income holdings.  Siderar SAIC (ERAR)   dropped 2 percent to 31.20 pesos.
The Argentine securities commission allowed trading to resume
May 6 on shares of Argentina’s largest steel producer, after the
company said it would abide by a court order that barred it from
paying dividends.  YPF SA (YPFD)  , the Argentine unit of Repsol YPF, rose
4.2 percent to 185.50 pesos as Morgan Stanley said the company
is likely to benefit from rising domestic crude prices as the
country faces annual inflation of more than 25 percent. Morgan
Stanley initiated coverage of YPF’s American depositary receipts
with an “overweight” rating.  To contact the reporter on this story:
