Reserve Bank  of India Governor Duvvuri Subbarao comments on rising  oil prices  and the risk they pose to
the government’s budget deficit target and inflation. Subbarao
was speaking to reporters in Basel, Switzerland today.  “Monetary policy works best if there is also fiscal
consolidation. That’s true of any economy and certainly true of
India, where fiscal pressures have been with us for the last 15
years.  ‘‘A lot of developments have taken place since the February
budget, particularly oil prices have gone up and that calls into
question the feasibility of reaching the target given in the
budget.  ‘‘The RBI will have to persevere with the anti-inflationary
stance.’’  To contact the reporter on this story:
