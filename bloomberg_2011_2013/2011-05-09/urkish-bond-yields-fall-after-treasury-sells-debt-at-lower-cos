Turkish bond yields fell for the third
day after borrowing costs declined at the sale of 3.74 billion
liras ($2.43 billion) of three-year debt, double the amount in
April.  Yields on benchmark two-year bonds dropped seven basis
points to 8.34 percent at 4:34 p.m. in Istanbul, according to
the RBS Istanbul Benchmark Bond Index.  Turkey  is seeking to decrease the cost of borrowing as
policy makers keep  interest rates  at a record low and investors
speculate increases inflation will be temporary. The Treasury
sold 1.94 billion liras of the three-year debt yielding 9.21
percent, with bids almost double the amount sold. It also sold
1.8 billion liras in an earlier non-competitive offering. Turkey
had sold 1.79 billion liras of the bonds on April 11 at a yield
of 9.36 percent.  “The bid-to-cover ratio at the auction was pretty strong
and the yield was less than the market expected,” Murat Yardimci, head of trading at ING Bank AS, said by telephone.
“Increases in inflation are going to be temporary and that’s
how the market is interpreting things.”  Inflation gained to 4.3 percent in April from 4 percent in
March, the statistics agency said on May 3. The rate may climb
again this month due to the seasonal effect of an increase in
unprocessed food prices, the central bank said on May 4. The
central bank forecasts inflation will accelerate in the second
quarter before slowing in the third, governor Erdem Basci said
April 28.  The Treasury also sold 1.08 million liras of five-year
inflation-linked bonds at a yield of 2.32 percentage points
above inflation.  The lira weakened 0.2 percent to 1.5468 per dollar. The
main ISE National 100 share index fell 0.2 percent to 68,118.84.  To contact the reporter on this story:
