The  U.S. Mint  sold 62,000 ounces of
American Eagle gold coins in the first week of May, heading for
the highest monthly amount since March 1999.  This month’s sales are already 57 percent of the total in
April, according to the mint’s website. May sales would be about
240,250 ounces if the current pace continues. The mint sold
231,500 ounces of the coins in December 2009 and 269,000 ounces
in March 1999, its website showed.  Concern about faster inflation,  Europe ’s debt crisis, a
weakening dollar and conflict in the Middle East and North
Africa helped gold climb to a record $1,577.57 an ounce on May
2. European Union officials agreed in an unannounced meeting on
May 6 to reconsider the terms of the 110 billion-euro ($158
billion) lifeline  Greece  received last year.  “It could perhaps be explained by restocking, but it’s
also likely related to the return of European sovereign concerns
to the headlines,”  Edel Tully , an analyst at UBS AG in London,
said today in a report to clients. “Higher prices prompt
greater coin demand, particularly if the reason for higher
prices is fear.”  Gold coin buying accelerated even as prices dropped 4.4
percent last week, the most in almost a year. Silver’s slump
into a so-called  bear market  last week led commodities lower on
concern that demand will weaken and as Comex exchange owner CME
Group Inc. raised margin requirements for silver. Gold traded at
$1,508.43 an ounce by 10:56 a.m. in  London  today. Immediate
delivery silver, which reached a record $49.79 on April 25, was
at $37.14.  The mint sold 701,000 ounces of American Eagle silver coins
so far this month, the data show. That compares with 2.82
million ounces for the whole of April.  To contact the reporter on this story:
