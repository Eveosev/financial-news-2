Google Inc. (GOOG) ’s  YouTube  website will add
“The King’s Speech,” “Inception” and about 3,000 other titles to
its movie-rental service, accelerating its shift into Hollywood
entertainment and stepping up competition with  Netflix Inc. (NFLX)   YouTube is adding films from  Sony Corp. (6758) , Time Warner Inc.’s
Warner Bros., Comcast Corp.’s Universal Pictures and Lionsgate,
according to a statement today. The additions will push
YouTube’s total movie rentals available to more than 6,000. Most
of the newer titles will cost $3.99 and up to rent.  “By expanding our content partnerships worldwide and
stimulating the success of budding filmmakers, artists and
entrepreneurs, we’ll ensure that YouTube remains the best place
for the world to see and discover rich talent,” Salar Kamangar,
head of YouTube, said today on  the company’s blog .  YouTube, which built a following by letting users post home
videos and amateur clips, is counting on professionally produced
content to draw more visitors and keep them on the site longer.
YouTube users currently spend about 15 minutes on the site per
day on average, compared with the five hours they spend on
television, the company said. The expanded movie rental
offerings also could put pressure on Netflix, the biggest
provider of streamed movies online.  ‘Scarface,’ ‘Goodfellas’  The new titles -- including older films such as
“Scarface” and “Goodfellas” and newer releases like
“Despicable Me” and “Little Fockers” -- will be added to
YouTube over the coming weeks, the company said.  The rentals will be accompanied by reviews and extras,
YouTube said. The company also offers some free full-length
movies on the site, in addition to the rentals.  The movies, which are streamed over an Internet connection,
can be viewed within 30 days of renting them. Once users start
watching the movie, they’ll typically have to finish within 24
hours.  Google, based in Mountain View,  California , rose $2.38 to
$537.68 at 4 p.m. New York time on the Nasdaq Stock Market. The
shares have fallen 9.5 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
