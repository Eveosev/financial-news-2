Romanian industrial output growth
slowed for the first time in five months in March amid low
demand as the country struggles to recover from a two-year
recession.  Production grew an annual 7.4 percent in March after 12.7
percent in February, the Bucharest-based National Statistics
Institute said in an e-mailed statement today. Output fell 0.8
percent on the month.  Romania â€™s industry, which grew 10 percent in the first
quarter and 4.1 percent in 2010, and surging exports will
probably help the economy grow 1.5 percent this year, according
to the  International Monetary Fund  and government forecasts. The
economy contracted an annual 1.3 percent in 2010.  To contact the reporter on this story:
