Siemens AG (SIE)  is seeking a settlement
with Greece’s government in disputes over unpaid bills and the
government’s damage claims related to bribery allegations,  Der
Spiegel  reported, without saying where it got the information.  Greece wants at least 2 billion euros ($2.9 billion) from
Siemens because of alleged bribery cases while the Munich-based
manufacturer wants the state to pay for work valued in the
“low-triple-digit” million-euro range, the German magazine
reported. Initial talks have started in resolving the disputes,
it said.  Alexander Becker, a Siemens spokesman, declined today to
comment on the report.  George Petalotis , a Greek government
spokesman, didn’t immediately answer two calls made by Bloomberg
News to his mobile phone seeking comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
