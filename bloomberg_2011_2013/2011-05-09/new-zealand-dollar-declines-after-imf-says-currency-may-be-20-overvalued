New Zealand â€™s dollar fell after the
International Monetary Fund said the currency may be as much
as 20 percent overvalued relative to estimates of the
equilibrium exchange rate. The so-called kiwi slid to 79.16 U.S.
cents as of 8:11 a.m. in Sydney from 79.55 yesterday.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
