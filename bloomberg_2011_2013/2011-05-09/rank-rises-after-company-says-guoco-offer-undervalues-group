Rank Group Plc (RNK)  advanced in London
trading after saying that a 150 pence per share offer from Guoco
Group Ltd. “significantly undervalues” the operator of Mecca
Bingo clubs and Grosvenor casinos.  Guoco’s offer, required after the Hong Kong investment
company controlled by billionaire Quek Leng Chan raised its
shareholding to 40.8 percent and made after the close of trading
on May 6, is an 0.8 percent premium to the May 5 closing price
of 148.8 pence, Maidenhead, England-based Rank said in a
Regulatory News Service statement.  Rank shareholders face the “unappetizing prospect” of
being minority stockholders with Guoco in control, because Guoco
need only gain 10 percent acceptance of its offer, Numis
Securities analysts led by Ivor Jones said in a note.  “We expect a material number of shareholders to accept the
offer because of the uncertainty over what other shareholders
will do,” the Numis analysts wrote in a note to investors.  Rank rose 2.8 pence, or 1.9 percent, to 151.6 pence at the
4:30 p.m. close in  London . The shares have risen 20 percent so
far this year, giving it a market value of 592.1 million pounds
($966 million).  The offer was “pitched to fail,” as Guoco said it wasn’t
going to increase its bid, according to James Hollins, an
analyst at Evolution Securities.  “We therefore conclude that Guoco is content to remain as
a large shareholder in Rank, and that investors will and should
reject the offer,” he wrote. Hollins has a “buy”
recommendation on Rank.  To contact the reporter on this story:
