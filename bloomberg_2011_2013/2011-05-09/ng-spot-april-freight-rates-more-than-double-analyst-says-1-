Rates to ship spot supplies of
liquefied natural gas more than doubled in April to a five-year
high from a year earlier and are expected to stay “firm,” a
shipping consultant said.  Spot rates for LNG vessels rose to $92,000 a day in April
from $35,000 a year earlier, Drewry Maritime Services Ltd. said
in an e-mailed note today. That’s the highest in at least four
years.  “The surge in freight rates has been due to an increase in
LNG imports into  Japan , which has created a shortage of
conventional LNG vessels,” Pranay Shukla, Drewry’s Gurgaon,
India-based analyst, said in an e-mail. “The freight rates are
expected to remain firm as Japan is expected to buy significant
LNG cargoes in order to prevent any power outages during
summer.”  Freight rates for spot or short-term charters averaged
$79,000 a day this year from $40,700 in 2010, it said. Long-term
charter rates climbed 11 percent to $78,000 a day last month.  LNG tanker fleet grew 4.8 percent last month to 352
vessels, with another 33 vessels on order, according to the
note. Demand for LNG, liquefied by cooling the gas to about
minus 260 degrees Fahrenheit, will grow “tremendously” this
year after increasing at the fastest pace in 2010 to 294 billion
cubic meters, Cedigaz, a gas industry association, said on its
website this month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
