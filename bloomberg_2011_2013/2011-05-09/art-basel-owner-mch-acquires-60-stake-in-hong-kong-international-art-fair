MCH Swiss Exhibition Group, the
Swiss owner of  Art Basel  and  Art Basel Miami Beach , will take
a 60 percent stake in the company that controls  Hong Kong
International Art Fair , the fair’s director said today.  MCH, based in  Basel , bought the stake in Asian Art Fairs
Ltd., which owns ART HK, as the Hong Kong fair is known. The
deal takes effect July 1, said Magnus Renfrew, the ART HK
director. He didn’t provide financial details.  “Art Basel is an organization with unparalleled
experience in putting on international art fairs,” Renfrew
said. “This will give us incredible access to expertise and
collectors, curators and the art world.”  China  overtook the U.S. as the world’s biggest auction
market for fine art last year, according to research company
 Artprice , benefiting from the support of its government in
Beijing.  ART HK, which was started in 2008, will be held May 26-
29 and feature 260 galleries from 38 countries. Beginning
next year, it will be moved to February to provide sufficient
time between Art Basel Miami Beach in December and Art Basel
in June, Renfrew said.  Editors: Michael Tighe, Stan James  To contact the writer on the story:
