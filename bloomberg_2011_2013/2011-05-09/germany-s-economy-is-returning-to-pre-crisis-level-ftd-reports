Germany ’s economy is on its way back
to the level it reached before the financial crisis, Financial
Times Deutschland reported, citing economists.  “Germany’s gross domestic product should reach the level
of the first quarter of 2008 or exceed it slightly in April,”
Carsten-Patrick Meier, economist at the Kiel Institute for World
Economics, told the newspaper. The country’s overall economic
output in May is expected to be around 576 billion euros ($826
billion), higher than its level at the beginning of 2008, FTD
said, citing UniCredit SpA.  To contact the reporter on this story:
