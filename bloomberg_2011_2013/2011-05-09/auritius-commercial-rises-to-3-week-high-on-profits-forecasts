Mauritius Commercial Bank (MCB) , the Indian
Ocean island nation’s biggest lender by market value, advanced
to a more-than three-year high on speculation third-quarter
profit will rise.  The stock increased 2 rupees, or 1.1 percent, to 180
rupees, by the 1:30 p.m. close in Port Louis, its highest
closing level since March 2008.  “There are a lot of expectations,” Roshan Ramoly,
managing director of CIM Stockbrokers Ltd., said by phone from
Port Louis today. “Normal operating profits are seen to be
significantly higher than last year,” he said, without
providing estimates.  The lender plans to “reach or exceed the 4 billion-rupee
($146.1 million) profit level” in the year through June,
Banking Chief Executive Officer Antony Withers said on May 4.
MCB, as the bank is known, will announce third-quarter earnings
by the end of this week.  Second-quarter profit climbed 12 percent to 1.05 billion
rupees compared with 939.1 million rupees a year earlier, the
Port Louis-based company said Feb. 11.  To contact the reporter on this story:
