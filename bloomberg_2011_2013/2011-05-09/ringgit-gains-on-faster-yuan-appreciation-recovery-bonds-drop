Malaysia’s ringgit strengthened,
ending a four-day slump, on speculation  China  will allow faster
yuan appreciation and after a U.S. government report showed  job
creation  exceeded economists’ expectations.  The currency rose following its worst week in five months
after the Labor Department said on May 6 that employers added
244,000 jobs in April, compared with the median estimate of
185,000 in a Bloomberg News survey. Treasury Secretary  Timothy F.
Geithner  plans to ask China to favor a stronger yuan at an
annual Strategic and Economic Dialogue in  Washington  today and
tomorrow.  Government bonds  declined.  “A stronger yuan will definitely be a boost for the
ringgit and Asian currencies,” said Calbert Loh, head of
treasury at Bangkok Bank Bhd. in Kuala Lumpur. “Strong U.S. job
data is a pleasant surprise.”  The ringgit climbed 0.5 percent to 2.9870 per dollar as of
4:17 p.m. in  Kuala Lumpur , according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The currency slid 1.4 percent last week, the most
since the five days ended Nov. 26.  The Obama administration and U.S. lawmakers say China’s
currency policy gives the nation’s exporters an unfair
competitive advantage, costing U.S. jobs. Geithner is trying to
convince Chinese officials that a stronger yuan has benefits for
their economy.  A stronger yuan makes Malaysian goods cheaper for buyers
from China, which is the second-largest export market for the
Southeast Asian country. The yuan was little changed at 6.4974,
following a 1.8 percent gain this year to near a 17-year high.  The yield on Malaysia’s 4.012 percent bond due September
2017 rose one basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 3.73
percent, according to Bursa  Malaysia . The price dropped 0.05, or
50 sen per 1,000 ringgit face amount, to 101.6. The rate has
declined 10 basis points in the past month.  Malaysia’s government will sell an additional 3.5 billion
ringgit ($1.2 billion) of the 2017 notes on May 12, the first of
two bond sales scheduled for this month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
