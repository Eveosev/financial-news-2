Swiss stocks declined for the fourth
day in five as shares in  Switzerland ’s two largest banks
retreated, trimming the previous trading day’s rally.  UBS AG dropped 1.6 percent after the Financial Times
reported that the bank may fail to meet performance targets that
it set in 2009.  The Swiss Market Index of the biggest and most actively
traded companies slid 0.4 percent to 6,499.32 at 10:30 a.m. in
Zurich. The broader Swiss Performance Index lost 0.2 percent.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
