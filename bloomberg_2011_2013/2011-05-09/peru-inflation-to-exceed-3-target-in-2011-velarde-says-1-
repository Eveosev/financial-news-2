Peru’s inflation rate will top the
country’s target of 3 percent this year, central bank President
Julio Velarde said at an event in  Lima  today.  Price increases in April pushed the rate over target,
though inflation in May will be slower, and a decline in
commodities will ease pressure for prices to rise in the South
American country, Velarde said. The central bank targets annual
inflation in a range of 1 percent to 3 percent.  Peru’s annual inflation accelerated to 3.34 percent in
April from 2.66 percent in March, reflecting higher
international prices for corn, wheat and cotton, and increased
costs of food produced locally, the national statistics agency
said May. 1.  The central bank’s seven-member board last month raised its
benchmark rate by a quarter-point to 4 percent from 3.75
percent, the ninth increase in 12 months. Policy makers meet on
May 12 to decide whether to make further changes.  The sol rose for a fourth day, climbing 0.3 percent to
2.7920 per dollar at 1:06 p.m. New York time from 2.7990 on May
6.  To contact the reporter on this story:
