Vietnam ’s dong weakened, snapping a
two-day gain, on speculation inflation will accelerate.  Consumer prices rose 17.51 percent in April from a year
earlier, the most in 28 months, stoked by increases in fuel and
electricity prices. The country’s central bank devalued its
currency by about 7 percent on Feb. 11 as it tried to curb
Vietnam’s trade deficit.  “We expect weakness in the dong to resurface as inflation
edges higher in the coming months,”  Credit Suisse Group AG (CSGN)  said
in a research note released today.  The dong dropped 0.2 percent to 20,620 per dollar as of
4:09 p.m. in Hanoi, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The  State Bank  of Vietnam fixed the currency’s reference
rate at 20,708, unchanged from May 6, its website showed. The
currency is allowed to trade up to 1 percent on either side of
the fixing.  Vietnam’s benchmark five-year bonds gained, with yields
dropping three basis points, or 0.03 percentage point, to 12.75
percent, according to a daily fixing price from banks compiled
by Bloomberg.  --Nguyen Kieu Giang in Hanoi. Editors: Andrew Janes, Simon Harvey  To contact the Bloomberg News Staff on this story:
