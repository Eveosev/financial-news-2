Senegal  obtained approval from 75
percent of investors holding its $200 million of 2014 bonds to
retire the notes in exchange for new debt issued last week,
Standard Bank Group Ltd. said.  “Exchanging the illiquid 2014 bond for an index-eligible
benchmark dramatically repositions Senegal in the international
bond market,” Florian von Hartig, global head of debt capital
markets at Standard Bank in  London , said in an e-mailed
statement today. “The new bond provides Senegal with a liquid
and broadly subscribed bond which will serve as a beneficial
pricing benchmark for Senegal’s future international capital
markets requirements.”  Standard Bank and Standard Chartered Plc arranged the West
African nation’s sale of $500 million in 10-year dollar bonds,
which were priced to yield 9.125 percent on May 6. Investors
including more than 125 U.S., European and Asian institutions
placed orders for as much as $2.4 billion of the bonds by May 5,
Johannesburg-based Standard Bank said in the statement.  Senegal’s notes, which are rated B+ by  Standard & Poor’s ,
its fourth-highest junk assessment, is the fifth benchmark
sovereign bond to come to the international market from sub-
Saharan Africa excluding  South Africa , according to Standard
Bank. Benchmark typically means at least $500 million. Nigeria,
Ghana,  Ivory Coast  and Gabon have sold Eurobonds of $500 million
or more.  Senegal’s 2014 dollar bond, sold in December 2009, rose for
a second day, sending the yield down 12 basis points, or 0.12
percentage point, to a record 7.42 percent at 12:07 p.m. in
London.  To contact the reporter on this story:
