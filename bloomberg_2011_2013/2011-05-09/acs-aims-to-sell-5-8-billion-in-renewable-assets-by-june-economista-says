Actividades de Construccion &
Servicios SA started a second round to sell its renewable-energy
assets and aims to close the transactions in June,  El Economista 
reported, citing unidentified people.  The Spanish construction company plans to sell the  power
plants  for about 4 billion euros ($5.8 billion) in five blocks
after failing to find a single buyer in its first offer, the
 newspaper  said.  Mediobanca SpA (MB)  and  Societe Generale (GLE)  SA, the
banks managing the sale, are seeking a higher price for ACS by
dividing the assets into blocks, El Economista said.  Gas Natural SDG SA (GAS) , Obrascon Huarte Lain SA,  Enel Green
Power SpA (EGPW)  and Morgan Stanley are among the possible buyers, the
newspaper said, citing no source for that information.  To contact the reporter on this story:
