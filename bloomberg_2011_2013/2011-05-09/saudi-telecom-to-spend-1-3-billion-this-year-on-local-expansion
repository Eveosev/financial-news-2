Saudi Telecom Co. (STC) , Saudi Arabia’s
largest phone operator by market value, plans to invest more
than 5 billion riyals ($1.3 billion) on expansion in the kingdom
this year, Chief Executive Officer Saud al-Daweesh said.  The company will also expand in India and Indonesia as well
as pursuing a license in Syria, said Al-Daweesh on the sidelines
of a conference in Dubai today.  Saudi Telecom is competing with  Etihad Etisalat Co. (EEC)  and
Zain Saudi Arabia for mobile-phone and Internet customers in the
Arab world’s largest economy. It will also compete with Saudi
Integrated Telecom Co. which offered shares for sale last week.
The number of  Internet users  in the kingdom rose 11 percent, to
11.4 million by the end of 2010, the  Communications and
Information Technology Commission  said on March 14.  “We are very optimistic on 2011 as we are launching new
innovative services and broadband speed is increasing locally,”
said Al-Daweesh.  The Riyadh-based company will invest about $450 million in
Indonesia’s NTS, also known as Axis, Ghassan Hasbani, the
company’s chief executive officer for international operations
said. The investment will be announced in the next few weeks, he
added. Saudi Telecom said on March 12 that it raised its stake
in Axis to 80.1 percent from 51 percent.  About 33 percent of the company’s revenue comes from
international operations and the plan is for that to reach 50
percent in three to four years, Hasbani said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
