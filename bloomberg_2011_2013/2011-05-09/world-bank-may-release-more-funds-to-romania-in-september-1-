The  World Bank  may release 400 million
euros ($577 million) to  Romania  in September, the Washington-
based lender’s economist to the Balkan nation said.  “The payment is pending parliament’s approval of the
health co-payment law, the government’s progress in implementing
the unitary wage law and the approval of public-spending reforms
for the next three years,” Catalin Pauna said today in an
interview in Bucharest.  To contact the reporter on this story:
