The  Detroit Red Wings  avoided National
Hockey League playoff elimination for the second straight game,
scoring three straight third-period goals to rally for a 4-3 win
over the San Jose Sharks.  Jonathan Ericsson and Daniel Cleary scored less than two
minutes apart last night at HP Pavilion in San Jose, California,
while Tomas Holmstrom netted the go-ahead goal for the Red Wings
with 6:08 remaining.  Detroit had won by the same score in Game 4 after losing
the first three games in the best-of-seven second round series.
The Red Wings will host Game 6 tomorrow.  The  Nashville Predators  host the top-seeded  Vancouver
Canucks  tonight, seeking to force a decisive seventh game in the
other Western Conference series. The Canucks hold a 3-2 series
lead after their 4-3 loss in Game 5.  To contact the reporter on this story:
