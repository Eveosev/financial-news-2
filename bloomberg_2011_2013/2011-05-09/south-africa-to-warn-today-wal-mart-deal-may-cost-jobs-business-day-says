South Africa’s government will warn of
thousands of possible job losses if  Wal-Mart Stores Inc (WMT) ’s bid to
buy a controlling stake in  Massmart Holdings Ltd. (MSM)  goes ahead
without conditions, Business Day reported.  As many as 4,000 jobs could be lost by Massmart shifting as
little as 1 percent of procurement from local to imported
sources, the Johannesburg-based newspaper said, citing
government documents posted on the website of the Competition
Tribunal.  A week-long hearing into the proposed transaction begins
today, Business Day said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
