Juhayna Food Industries (JUFO) ,  Egypt ’s
biggest publicly traded producer of packaged milk, plans to
acquire a local company in the food and beverage business,
Deputy Chief Executive Officer Nabil Skaria said.  “We have two, three that we’re eying,” Skaria said in an
interview in Dubai late yesterday, declining to identify
possible candidates. The company plans to finance the
acquisition from the proceeds of last year’s initial public
offering.  Juhayna raised 1 billion Egyptian pounds ($168 million)
from the share sale in June. The company has invested about 150
million pounds of the proceeds so far, Skaria said.  First-quarter earnings will be “better” than the same
period last year, he said. Juhayna made a profit of 60.2 million
pounds in the first quarter of 2010, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg. It’s estimated to make 50 million pounds in the
first three months this year, according to investment bank EFG-
Hermes Holding SAE.  Juhayna’s shares have slid 12.7 percent this year, which
saw a popular revolt that toppled President  Hosni Mubarak  in
February. The country’s benchmark EGX 30  stock index  has tumbled
32 percent.  The company plans to set up a milk farm to boost production
for as much as 50 percent of its packaged milk output within
five years from 10 percent, Skaria said at an investment
conference in Dubai yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
