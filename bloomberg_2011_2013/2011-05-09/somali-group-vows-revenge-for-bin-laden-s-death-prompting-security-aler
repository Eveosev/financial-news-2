Somalia’s al-Shabaab group vowed to
avenge the killing of  Osama bin Laden  by U.S. forces as the Horn
of Africa nation announced a heightened state of alert aimed at
preventing retaliation by the Islamic militants.  At least seven al-Shabaab fighters were killed late
yesterday during several hours of “fierce fighting” with
soldiers in Baladweyne, in the Hiran region, Mohamed Nor Agajof,
commander of the government forces involved, said today by
phone. A senior al-Shabaab fighter told Radio Furqaan that there
had been no casualties among the militants during the battle.  “Al-Shabaab will continue their efforts until they
completely restore the Islamic religion on the earth regardless
of the death of Sheikh Osama bin Laden,” al-Shabaab’s
spokesman, Sheikh Ali Mohamud Rage, told reporters in Mogadishu,
the capital.  Hundreds of demonstrators came out in Mogadishu on May 4 to
celebrate the killing of bin Laden in  Pakistan  as the Somali
government said the country was on high alert against revenge
attacks by al-Shabaab. The U.S. accuses al-Shabaab, which has
been battling Somalia’s Western-backed government since 2007, of
having links to al-Qaeda.  Information seized in the raid on the al-Qaeda leader’s
hideout may help lead to other individual terrorists and groups
and to forestall further attacks, U.S. President  Barack Obama 
said in an interview aired yesterday on CBS’s “60 Minutes”
program.  To contact the reporter on this story:
