Tunisia  agreed to buy 14,000 metric
tons of raw sugar and an equal amount of refined, or white,
sweetener at a tender.  The state-run Tunisian Office for Trade bought the raw
sugar at $575 a ton from Sucden for arrival Aug. 10-20,
Purchasing Manager Khaled Ksouri said by telephone today from
Tunis. It purchased the white sugar at $740 a ton from Cargill
Inc. for arrival in June. Both prices include the cost of
freight, Ksouri said.  Tunisia’s sugar consumption will be 370,000 tons in the
2010-11 season that started in September, according to the  U.S.
Department of Agriculture . Imports will come to 470,000 tons,
allowing the country to build up its stockpiles to 121,000 tons,
the USDA estimates.  Cargill took delivery of a “large quantity” of white
sugar after the May futures contract expired on NYSE Liffe. The
amount was about 323,750 tons, company spokesman Francis DeRosa
said by e-mail April 18. The total delivery from the contract
expiration was 375,150 tons, the most since May 2007, according
to NYSE Liffe and data on Bloomberg.  To contact the reporters on this story:
