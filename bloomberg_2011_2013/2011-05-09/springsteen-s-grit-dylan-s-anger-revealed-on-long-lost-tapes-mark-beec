Bruce Springsteen fans have been
waiting more than three decades to hear this.  A concert witnessed by fewer than 300 people has passed
into legend among devotees of “the Boss.” Record company
Columbia had lost $150,000 on his first two LPs. Springsteen,
though, displayed the drive that was to make him a star when
playing in Bryn Mawr (“Big Hill” in Welsh),  Pennsylvania .  The gig was broadcast on local radio station WMMR and has
been the subject of murky bootlegs under different titles. Now
“Live at the Main Point 1975” shows clearly why critic Jon Landau was proclaiming Springsteen as the future of rock.  I’ve seen many Springsteen concerts from the 1980s where he
played as his life depended on it. Never was the “make or
break” more true than at the now-defunct Main Point as he
previewed songs for the soon-to-be-released “ Born to Run .” Its
title-track lyric references “broken heroes on a last-chance
power drive.” Bruce could be talking about himself.  Like some other recent “unofficial” Springsteen albums,
the disc isn’t available in the U.S. though it can be ordered
 online . It’s worth seeking out, if only for “Wings for
Wheels.” This is an early version of “Thunder Road,” with
different verses. Another standout is “New York City
Serenade,” here with an expanded monologue and instrumentals
that push it toward 20 minutes.  The E Street Band sounds great, boosted by violinist Suki
Lahav. Still, they were to get even better when guitarist Steve van Zandt joined soon after. Rating: ****.  “ Bob Dylan  in Concert: Brandeis University 1963” offers
revealing insight into a songwriter about to make it big.  An open-spool tape of the obscure show, probably recorded
straight off the mixing desk, was discovered in the archives of
writer Ralph Gleason. The resulting CD is going on general
release after being available as a limited-time offer.  Dylan’s political fury drives “Masters of War” and
“Talkin’ World War III Blues,” which both showed up in studio
form on “The Freewheelin’ Bob Dylan” released two weeks later.
Too bad “Honey, Just Allow Me One More Chance” is ragged.
Still, this is a fine document. Rating: ***.  Bob Dylan isn’t the only artist with a “Bootleg Series”
of archive material. The late  Johnny Cash  has joined in. A
previous album of outtakes from 1973-1982, “Personal File,”
has been repackaged as “Bootleg Volume I.” Now comes “Bootleg
Volume II,” which compiles a radio show and rarities from 1954
up to 1969. The low point is the gravel-voiced Cash hesitatingly
reading commercials for air conditioning. The best material
comes with the early demos, such as an energetic stab at “I
Walk the Line.” Rating: ***.  Neil Diamond joins the bandwagon with “The Bang Years
1966-1968.” He presented 23 mono songs such as “Girl, You’ll
Be a Woman Soon,” later covered by Urge Overkill for the “Pulp
Fiction” soundtrack; “Red Red Wine,” known for its version by
UB40; and “I’m a Believer,” a hit for the Monkees. Diamond’s
songwriting here is excellent, his performances growing in
confidence. Rating: ***.  Springsteen is on Left Field Media. U.S. import prices
vary. The CD is priced 8.99 pounds in the U.K. or on
 http://www.amazon.co.uk   Dylan is on Sony Legacy priced at $9.07 or 4.93 pounds.  Cash is on Sony Legacy priced at $14.44 or 10.49 pounds.  Diamond is Columbia/Sony CMG priced at $8.99 in the U.S. It
will be released on May 23 in the U.K. priced 8.99 pounds.  Download fees vary across services.  Information:  http://www.brucespringsteen.net ,
