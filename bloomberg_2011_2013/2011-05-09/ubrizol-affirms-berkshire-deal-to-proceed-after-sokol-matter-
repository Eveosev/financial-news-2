Lubrizol Corp. (LZ)  said its plan to sell
itself is unaffected by disclosures of David Sokol’s investments
in the firm as he pushed for Warren Buffett, his then-boss at
 Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (BRK/A) , to buy the firm.  “Berkshire Hathaway’s interest in Lubrizol remains a
testament to the hard work of all Lubrizol employees,” the
Wickliffe, Ohio-based lubricant company said today in question-
and-answer remarks in a regulatory filing. “It is unfortunate
that the David Sokol matter has occasionally overshadowed this
basic fact.”  Omaha, Nebraska-based Berkshire, which agreed in March to
pay about $9 billion for Lubrizol, said later that month that
Sokol was stepping down from the company.  To contact the reporter on this story:
