Mexico ’s central bank Governor Agustin Carstens said the bank’s decision to buy gold doesn’t reflect a
lack of confidence in the  U.S. dollar  as the world’s reserve
currency, Financial Times Deutschland reported, citing an
interview.  “Our adherence to dollar holdings will not be affected by
that in any way,” the newspaper quoted Carstens as saying in an
interview in Helsinki.  To contact the reporter on this story:
