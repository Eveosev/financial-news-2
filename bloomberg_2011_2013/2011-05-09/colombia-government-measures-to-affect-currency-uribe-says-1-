Colombia central bank chief Jose Dario Uribe said recent government steps to stem the peso’s rally are
likely to have an impact on the South American currency.  Uribe spoke to reporters after a quarterly presentation in
Bogota.  Finance Minister Juan Carlos Echeverry on April 29 said the
government would create an overseas fund with as much as $1.2
billion from dollars bought in the local  spot market  through the
end of 2011, and would forgo repatriating funds from abroad for
the rest of the year. Uribe spoke during a quarterly
presentation in Bogota.  The government’s dollar purchases come on top of the
central bank’s plans to buy a minimum of $20 million daily until
at least June 17.  “The government has had some nice surprises with tax
collections and so maintains an important level of deposits in
the central bank that allows us to manage monetary policy
without much difficulty through the remainder of the year,”
Uribe said.  The peso slid 1.1 percent to 1,787.97 per  U.S. dollar  at
3:19 p.m. New York time from 1,768.90 on May 6. The decline
pared the peso’s advance this year to 6.7 percent, still the
best performance among six Latin American currencies tracked by
Bloomberg.  All signs point to inflation ending this year and next at
close to 3 percent, Uribe said today. While economic growth will
likely be affected by torrential rains and flooding over the
last several weeks, gross domestic product will likely expand at
close to 5 percent in 2011.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
