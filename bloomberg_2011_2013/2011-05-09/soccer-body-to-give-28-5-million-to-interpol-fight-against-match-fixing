FIFA, soccer’s governing body, will
donate 20 million euros ($28.5 million) over 10 years to
Interpol to fight match-fixing and illegal betting.  FIFA will give 4 million euros in each of the next two
years, and then 1.5 million euros in the following eight,
according to an e-mailed statement today. Interpol, the
international police agency, will use the funds against illegal
and irregular gambling.  “The threat of match-fixing in sport is a major one, and
we are committed to doing everything in our power to tackle this
threat,” FIFA President  Sepp Blatter  said in the statement.
“In the fight against illegal betting and match-fixing, the
preventive measures that can be taken and the protection of the
players and the integrity of the game are of the utmost
importance.”  FIFA will also create an internal department, the Betting
Integrity Investigation Task Force, to investigate illegal
gambling.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
