Sino- Zimbabwe  Ltd. of  China  fired
workers at its Marange diamond fields operation in Zimbabwe
because the mine isn’t economically viable, the  Herald  reported,
citing Gift Chimanikire, the deputy mines minister, and
unidentified workers.  Sino-Zimbabwe entered into a joint venture to dig for gems
with the state-owned Zimbabwe Mining and Development Corp. on
March 11, the Harare-based newspaper said.  Mbada Mining Ltd., Marange Mineral Resources Ltd., Pure
Diamonds Ltd. and Anjin Mining also mine for diamonds at the
field, the Herald said. Mbada Mining and Marange Resources
export gems from Marange, it said. The Herald didn’t say how
many workers were employed by Sino-Zimbabwe.  To contact the reporter on this story:
