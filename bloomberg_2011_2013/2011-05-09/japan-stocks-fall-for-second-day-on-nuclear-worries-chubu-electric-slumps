Japanese stocks fell for a second day
on concern that a government request to shut a nuclear reactor
located close to an earthquake fault-line may hurt the economy.  Chubu Electric Power Co., based in Nagoya in central Japan,
plunged 10 percent after Japanese Prime Minister  Naoto Kan  asked
it to close its Hamaoka nuclear plant. Tohoku Electric Power Co.
lost 2.1 percent after the Asahi newspaper reported it may post
a loss.  Toyota Motor Corp. (7203) , the world’s largest carmaker, slid
0.5 percent.  Yamaha Corp. (7951) , a musical instruments maker, tumbled
5.8 percent after forecasting profit will drop, citing the March
11 quake impact.  The Nikkei 225 Stock Average fell 0.7 percent to 9,794.38
at the 3 p.m. close of trading in Tokyo. The broader Topix lost
0.4 percent to 853.21, with about twice as many shares declining
as advancing.  “The call to shut Chubu Electric’s reactors is boosting
uncertainty,” said Koichi Kurose, chief strategist in Tokyo at
Resona Bank Ltd., which oversees the equivalent of $57 billion
in assets. “If the reactors are halted, it will add to costs
for most companies, especially automakers and other manufactures
that need electricity to produce products.”  The Topix has declined 8.3 percent since March 10, the day
before a magnitude-9 earthquake and tsunami devastated  Japan ’s
northeast coast, disabled a nuclear power plant and disrupted
supply chains at companies from Toyota to Canon Inc. In the
period through the last close, the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index
gained 3.5 percent and the Stoxx  Europe  600 Index rose 1.2
percent.  Utilities Drop  Kan on May 6 asked Japan’s third-biggest utility to shut
its Hamaoka power plant, citing a government study that showed
an 87 percent likelihood of a magnitude-8 quake striking the
area within 30 years. It is the first government request to
close reactors since the March 11 temblor caused the world’s
worst nuclear accident in 25 years.  Chubu Electric plunged 10 percent to 1,584 yen, the lowest
close since April 2000 and the biggest drop in the Nikkei 225.
Power and gas companies had the steepest fall in the Topix among
its 33 industry groups.  Tohoku Electric, a utility based in the northern  Miyagi
prefecture , lost 2.1 percent to 1,205 yen after the Asahi
newspaper reported the utility, which had expected a 36 billion
yen profit, may post a loss for the year ended March 31 after
power plants were damaged in the March earthquake.  Carmakers Slipped  “A lot of industrial-use products such as cars and
electronics parts are produced in the Chubu district,” said
 Kazuhiro Takahashi , a general manager at Daiwa Securities
Capital Markets Co. in Tokyo. “The uncertainty about the
government measures toward nuclear power is a negative factor
for stock prices.”  Toyota, which operates 12 car and component factories in
Aichi prefecture, central Japan, slid 0.5 percent to 3,195 yen
and smaller automaker Nissan Motor Co. fell 1.3 percent to 767
yen. Carmakers were the heaviest drag on the Topix’s decline,
following power and gas sectors.  European-oriented companies declined after the euro fell
the most in four months against the dollar as European Central
Bank President  Jean-Claude Trichet  signaled he may not raise
 interest rates  next month and concern grew that  Greece ’s debt
crisis is worsening.  Weaker Euro  “While concern remains about the European sovereign risks
and the stronger yen, stock prices may face upside resistance,”
said Hiroshi Miyazaki, chief economist at Shinkin Asset
Management Co. in Tokyo.  Nippon Sheet Glass Co., a glassmaker that generates about
40 percent of its sales in Europe, slipped 0.8 percent to 242
yen.  Nintendo Co. , a video-game console maker that gets a third
of its revenue from Europe, lost 1.6 percent to 19,430 yen,
extending its decline of May 6 after cutting the price of its
Wii console to $150.  The euro depreciated to as much as 114.99 yen today in
 Tokyo , compared with 117.18 at the close of  stock trading  on May
6. A weaker euro cuts the value of European income at Japanese
companies when converted into their home currency.  Today, 91 of the 1,673 companies in the Topix index were
scheduled to release earnings statements. Of the 517 companies
that have reported results for the latest quarter, 102 have
exceeded analysts’ estimates, while 100 have missed them,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Yamaha, Kirin  Yamaha tumbled 5.8 percent to 936 yen after forecasting a
24 percent decline in operating profit to 10 billion yen ($124
million) for this fiscal year, citing sluggish sales after
difficulties in procuring electronic parts and a slump in
 consumer spending  after the earthquake. Yamaha had the second-
steepest fall in the  Nikkei 225 (NKY) , followed by Fast Retailing Co.
and Kirin Holdings Co.  Fast Retailing,  Asia ’s biggest apparel chain, lost 4.2
percent to 12,310 yen after saying the number of customers at
its Uniqlo stores open at least 12 months in Japan declined 1.2
percent last month, falling for a third month.  Kirin, the nation’s No. 2 brewer by volume, sank 4 percent
to 1,094 yen after saying it took a charge of 5.1 billion yen
from damage on its Sendai factory from the March 11 earthquake.
The company booked a 2.11 billion yen net loss for the January-
March period, compared with a profit of 6.16 billion yen a year
earlier.  To contact the reporter on this story:
