Grain planting in  Canada  is about 3
percent complete, behind the normal pace of almost 40 percent
for this time of year, the Canadian Wheat Board said today in an
e-mailed  statement .  “Light rain and moderate temperatures have combined to
stymie the general commencement of seeding across the
Prairies,” the board said. Poor conditions may continue this
week in Manitoba and Saskatchewan, while sunny weather may allow
planting to accelerate in  Alberta , the agency said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
