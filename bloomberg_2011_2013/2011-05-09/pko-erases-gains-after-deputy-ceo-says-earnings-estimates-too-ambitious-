PKO Bank Polski SA, Poland’s biggest
lender, erased gains after the PAP newswire quoted Deputy Chief
Executive Officer Bartosz Drabikowski as saying that analysts’
estimates of first-quarter net income at 947 million zloty ($344
million) were “too ambitious.”  PKO sank 1.9 percent to 44.8 zloty at 16:04 p.m. in Warsaw,
after gaining as much as 0.5 percent today. The state-controlled
bank will report earnings before the market opens tomorrow.  Elzbieta Anders, a spokeswoman for the Warsaw-based bank,
confirmed to Bloomberg News that Drabikowski made the comments
to PAP.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
