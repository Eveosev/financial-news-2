Impresa SGPS SA (IPR) ,  Portugal ’s second-
biggest media company by revenue, said first-quarter earnings
plunged 78 percent as revenue dropped from a year earlier.  Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and
amortization declined to 726,526 euros ($1.04 million) from 3.24
million euros as sales dropped 6.1 percent to 57.8 million
euros, Lisbon-based Impresa said in a statement today.  Impresa owns SIC, the second-most viewed television channel
in Portugal. Multimedia revenue retreated more than 41 percent
to 3.74 million euros, after the final stage of the program
“Idolos” in February 2010 increased sales a year earlier.  The net loss widened to 3.45 million euros from 896,818
euros.  To contact the reporter on this story:
