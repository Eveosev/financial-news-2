Liberia  is suspending for a year
import tariffs on agriculture, forestry, road and some types of
mining equipment, according a statement e-mailed yesterday from
the West African nation’s presidency.  The tax cuts are a bid to boost the country’s economic
growth following a decade and a half of conflict that ended in
2003, the statement said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
