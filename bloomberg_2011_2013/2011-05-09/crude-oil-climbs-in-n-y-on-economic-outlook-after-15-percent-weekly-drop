Crude oil rose above $102 a barrel in
 New York , rebounding from the biggest weekly decline since 2008,
on signals that the global economic recovery remains intact.  Futures climbed 5.5 percent, the most in more than two
months, after a report today showed German exports surged to a
record in March and the U.S. Labor Department said last week
that payrolls expanded. Prices also advanced on concern that a
rising  Mississippi River  will flood Louisiana refineries.  “Some of the economic news has been stronger than
expected, reducing worries about demand,” said  Rick Mueller , a
principal with ESAI Energy LLC in Wakefield,  Massachusetts .
“The  Mississippi  floods are increasing concern about
disruptions, especially of the products.”  Crude oil for June delivery rose $5.37 to settle at $102.55
a barrel on the  New York Mercantile Exchange , the biggest one-
day gain since Feb. 22. Futures dropped 15 percent in the five
days ended May 6, the largest weekly decline since December
2008. Prices are up 37 percent from a year ago.  Brent crude for June settlement increased $6.77, or 6.2
percent, to $115.90 a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures
Europe exchange.  German exports, adjusted for work days and seasonal
changes, jumped 7.3 percent from February, when they gained 2.8
percent, the Federal Statistics Office in Wiesbaden said.
Economists had forecast a 1.1 percent increase, according to the
median of 10 estimates in a Bloomberg News survey. Exports were
worth 98.3 billion euros ($141.4 billion) in March, the most
since records began in 1950, the statistics office said.  U.S. payrolls expanded by 244,000 last month, the biggest
gain since May 2010, after a revised 221,000 increase the prior
month, the Labor Department said May 6 in  Washington .  Gasoline Surges  Gasoline advanced the most in 21 months on speculation that
rising water levels in the Mississippi River may threaten
production at some refineries along the river.  “In an extreme scenario, you may get flooding in
refineries, which in the short term may boost the price of
gasoline,” said  Richard Ilczyszyn , a market strategist at Lind-
Waldock, a broker in  Chicago . “That would be my only concern
here in the States with supply disruptions.”  The Mississippi, the largest U.S. river system, is forecast
to crest today in  Memphis ,  Tennessee , just below its 74-year-old
record.  Louisiana Refineries  The water has the potential to close oil operations in the
New Orleans-to-Baton Rouge region, which has 11 refineries with
a combined capacity of 2.5 million barrels a day, or 13 percent
of U.S. output, said  Andy Lipow , president of Lipow Oil
Associates LLC in Houston.  Gasoline futures for June delivery gained 18.83 cents, or
6.1 percent, to settle at $3.2784 a gallon on the Nymex. The
percentage gain is the biggest since July 30, 2009.  “You’re seeing some bottom-fishing today as confidence
returns to the commodity markets,” said  Tom Bentz , a broker
with BNP Paribas Commodity Futures Inc. in New York.  Gains in oil followed commodities’ broad rebound after last
week’s decline. The Standard & Poor’s GSCI Index of 24
commodities gained 3.7 percent after tumbling 11 percent last
week, the biggest weekly loss since December 2008.  Silver futures rose 5.2 percent to $37.116 an ounce in New
York after slumping 27 percent last week.  Commodity Recovery  Goldman Sachs Group Inc., which forecast the plunge,
predicted a possible recovery in commodity prices.  “Given the magnitude of the pullback, it does create an
opportunity for more upside potential, particularly in the
second half of this year, when fundamentals are expected to
tighten,”  Jeffrey Currie , the London-based head of commodity
research at Goldman, said in a May 6 interview.  JPMorgan Chase & Co. raised its oil-price forecasts because
OPEC and other producers aren’t matching rising demand and
consumers will take time to react to higher prices.  The bank boosted its 2011  Brent crude  forecast to $120 a
barrel from $110, and changed its estimate for West Texas
Intermediate crude, the grade traded in New York, to $109.50
from $99.  “While financial bushfires or perhaps a rapid resolution
to the Libyan civil war could radically alter market dynamics,
the balance of both risks and fundamentals still points to a
supply constrained world,” JPMorgan analysts led by New York-
based  Lawrence Eagles  wrote in a report on May 6.  Hedge funds  were caught with bullish bets near record highs
last week as oil in New York plunged.  Large speculators reduced net-long positions by 2.4 percent
to 293,823 futures and options in the seven days to May 3,
according to the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission’s
weekly Commitments of Traders report. That’s still within 5.7
percent of a record reached in March.  Oil volume in electronic trading on the Nymex was 813,856
contracts as of 3:11 p.m. in New York. Volume totaled 1.06
million on May 6, 44 percent above the average of the past three
months. Open interest was 1.65 million contracts.  To contact the reporter on this story:
