Commodities rose the most in seven
weeks on signs an improving U.S. economy may boost raw-
material demand and on speculation last week’s biggest drop
since December 2008 was excessive.  The Standard & Poor’s GSCI Index of 24 raw materials
advanced as much as 2.5 percent, the most since March 17, and
was up 1.6 percent at 684.71 by 3:34 p.m. in London. It fell 11
percent last week. Silver futures jumped as much as 7.6 percent
after losing 27 percent, the most since at least 1975, last
week. Crude oil in  New York  added as much as 3.6 percent after
last week’s 15 percent drop.  U.S. payrolls rose more than economists forecast, figures
showed May 6. Reports this week may show  China ’s inflation eased
in April, while industrial output and retail sales grew at about
the same pace as the previous month. Bulls say the expanding
global economy, led by China, India and  Brazil , is raising
demand at a time when producers from  BHP Billiton Ltd. (BHP) , the
mining industry leader, to oil company BP Plc can’t keep up.  “You’d expect some sort of reaction after the reasonable
employment data,” said  Jonathan Barratt , managing director at
Commodity Broking Services Pty in Sydney.  Crude for June delivery advanced 2.3 percent to $99.39 a
barrel on the  New York Mercantile Exchange  after touching
$100.69 earlier today. The contract closed May 6 at $97.18, the
lowest level since March 15. Oil will average $100 this year,
compared with $98.82 so far, Barratt said.  Payroll Data  Payrolls increased by 244,000 workers last month, the most
since May 2010, the U.S. Labor Department said. Economists
projected an April increase of 185,000, according to the median
estimate in a Bloomberg News survey.  “Economic activity remains quite positive,” Dominic Schnider, an analyst at UBS AG, said in a Bloomberg Television
interview in  Singapore . “The growth outlook in the near term
warrants that you hold or buy some commodities.”  China may say on May 11 inflation slowed to 5.2 percent in
April from 5.4 percent the previous month. Industrial production
grew 14.6 percent after increasing 14.8 percent in March and
retail sales expanded 17.6 percent from 17.4 percent, according
to surveys of economists by Bloomberg.  “The declines exhibited last week provide a good entry
point for both investors and consumers” as the macroeconomic
environment remains positive,  Hussein Allidina , head of
commodity research at Morgan Stanley in New York, said in a
report today. Corn, crude oil, gold, aluminum, copper and nickel
will deliver the best returns, the bank said.  Silver, Copper  Silver futures jumped 4.6 percent to $36.905 an ounce. Gold
for immediate delivery gained 0.5 percent to $1,503.40 an ounce.  “Gold and silver may regain strength as traders perceive
last week’s commodities washout to be excessive,” said Park
Jong Beom, a Seoul-based trader at Tongyang Futures Co.
“There’s no change in the outlook for a weaker dollar.”  Copper rebounded from a five-month low. The metal for
three-month delivery gained as much as 1.6 percent to $8,970 a
metric ton on the  London  Metal Exchange and was last at $8,834.
The contract lost 5.3 percent last week and on May 6 touched
$8,657.50, the lowest price since Dec. 3.  Wheat advanced for a second day as dry weather persisted in
some of the largest growers, potentially curbing harvests and
tightening global supplies. The July-delivery contract climbed
as much as 3.5 percent to $7.86 a bushel on the Chicago Board
of Trade and was last at $7.84. The grain fell 5.2 percent
last week, the most since the week ended April 15.  Hot, dry weather early this week may increase the risk to
the winter-wheat crop in the central and southern plains of the
U.S., Telvent DTN Inc. said in a May 6 forecast. Winter-wheat
areas in western  Europe  and central China also need rain “to
prevent significant declines” in yields, Telvent DTN said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
