A Greek debt restructuring would wreak
more damage than providing the country with additional financial
help, the senior finance spokesman for German Chancellor  Angela Merkel ’s party said.  Germany  would consider more help for Greece under stringent
conditions to avoid restructuring, a development that would risk
“maneuvering ourselves into an even bigger problem than we have
already,” Michael Meister, the parliamentary finance spokesman
for Merkel’s  Christian Democratic Union , said today in a phone
interview in Berlin.  Meister’s comments are a reversal from the position of
German officials as recently as last month, when Deputy Foreign
Minister Werner Hoyer said a Greek debt restructuring “would
not be a disaster.” The euro tumbled the most in a year on May
6 after Spiegel magazine reported that Greece was considering a
return to the drachma. Euro-area finance ministers held an
unannounced meeting the same day in Luxembourg to work on a new
aid package for  Greece .  Greece can win better bailout terms if it accelerates its
program of state asset sales to convince creditors that it’s
serious about cutting debt, according to Meister.  Greece has agreed to “reduce its accumulated debt through
privatizations and thus make a contribution to improving debt
sustainability,” he said. “The key regarding the question of
sustainability of existing debt is that the Greek government has
to think about what it can do to reduce the risk for its
creditors further. Then its creditors can in turn think about
whether it would be possible, given the lessened risk, to
negotiate about the level of interest and the question of
maturities.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
