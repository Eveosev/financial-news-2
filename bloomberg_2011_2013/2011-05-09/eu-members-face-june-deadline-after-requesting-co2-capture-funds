European Union members  seeking funding
for carbon capture and storage facilities facing a deadline
today are under pressure to meet another date next month to
adopt law, said the Zero Emissions Platform.  Spain is the only nation to have implemented the EU
Directive on Geological Storage, which is meant to be enacted by
June 25, said Eric Drosin, a spokesman for the  lobby group  known
as ZEP, whose members include ENEL SpA and  BP Plc. (BP/)  About eight
other member states are set to meet the June deadline, Drosin
said today by e-mail.  Member states need to apply by today to get funding from
the 5 billion euros ($7.2 billion) NER 300 fund set up by the EU
for  carbon-capture  and renewable-energy projects, ZEP said in an
e-mailed statement.  To contact the reporters on this story:
