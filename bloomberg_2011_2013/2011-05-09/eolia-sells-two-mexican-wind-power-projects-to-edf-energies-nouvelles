Eolia Renovables SA sold two wind
projects in Mexico with a potential generating capacity of 324
megawatts to a unit of  EDF Energies Nouvelles SA (EEN) , the company
said in an e-mailed press release.  Eolia bought the two projects in Oaxaca state in 2007 and
secured the required permits, negotiated power purchasing
agreements for the electricity they produce and won acceptance
to the  United Nations â€™ Clean Development Mechanism for the
generators, which means they can earn additional revenue by
selling carbon credits.  EDF Energies Nouvelles plans to begin work at the plants
soon, and they will begin generating in 2012 and 2013.  To contact the reporter on this story:
