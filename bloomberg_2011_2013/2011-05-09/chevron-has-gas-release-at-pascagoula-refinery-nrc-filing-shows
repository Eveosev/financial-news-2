Chevron Corp. (CVX)  had a release of gas at
its Pascagoula refinery in  Mississippi  during the startup of a
unit at the plant, according to a filing with the U.S. National
Response Center.  The release yesterday was associated with the unit
following scheduled maintenance, Katherine Swetman, a
spokeswoman for the plant, said in an e-mail. She declined to
identify the unit.  The refinery can process 360,000 barrels a day of crude,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
