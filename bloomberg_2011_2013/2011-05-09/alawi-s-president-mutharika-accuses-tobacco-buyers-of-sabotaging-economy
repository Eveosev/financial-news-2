Malawi  President Bingu wa Mutharika
accused tobacco buyers of trying to sabotage the southern
African nation’s economy by rejecting good-quality leaves and
offering low prices.  The government will keep pushing for buyers to meet its
minimum prices for tobacco, Mutharika said in a speech today at
the opening of an auction in Mzuzu, in northern Malawi,
broadcast on state TV. Buyers have rejected more than half of
the leaves on offer since the selling season officially started
on March 14, he said.  “The crop is of national importance and if you reject 70
percent of the crop, what do you want to do?” he said. “Kill
the economy? Do you want to sabotage this economy?”  The average price of tobacco in Malawi, the world’s largest
producer of the burley variety, fell 57 percent below the
government set price of $1.80 per kilogram (2.2 pounds) in the
week to March 25, the country’s central bank said April 11.
Sales were 80 percent lower in the first five weeks of the
season compared with a year earlier, the Daily Times reported
April 20, citing the Tobacco Control Commission.  Mutharika backed down on a March 15 threat to deport buyers
for offering low prices. “I will not deport you, I hope you
will change,” he said.  Tobacco is Malawi’s biggest foreign-exchange earner,
accounting for 60 percent of all revenue earned from abroad.
Burley tobacco is a lower-grade variety of the leaf used to fill
cigarettes flavored with higher-grade flue-cured tobacco.  To contact the reporter on this story:
