Apple Inc. (AAPL) , maker of the iPhone, iPad
and iMac, overtook search-engine giant  Google Inc. (GOOG)  to become the
world’s most valuable brand, WPP Plc said in a  report  today.  Apple’s brand value climbed 84 percent in the past year to
$153.3 billion, WPP’s Millward Brown unit said. Google’s brand
lost 2 percent to $111.5 billion, ending four years atop the
rankings, while  International Business Machines Corp. (IBM)  climbed 17
percent to be the No. 3, ahead of  McDonald’s Corp. (MCD)   New versions of the iPhone and iMac, and the introduction
of the iPad tablet, helped Cupertino, California-based Apple
almost double sales and profit for the latest quarter. Apple,
which overtook Redmond, Washington-based  Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) , as the
most-valuable technology company by market value in May 2010,
boosted its share of the global phone market and is the leading
seller of tablet computers.  “It’s clear that every single Apple employee, from  Steve Jobs  and  Tim Cook  to the summer interns, see protecting and
nurturing that brand as a top priority,” Millward Brown Chief
Executive Officer Eileen Campbell wrote in the report. “Tablet
computing also drove value growth not just for Apple, but also
for the providers who support yet another networked device.”  Facebook Inc., operator of the world’s largest social-
networking site, had a 246 percent climb in brand value, the
fastest, to become the No. 35 brand at $19.1 billion, according
to the report. Baidu Inc., Google’s Chinese rival, posted the
second-fastest climb at 141 percent, to be the No. 29 brand at
$22.6 billion.  Twelve of the top 100 global brands were from  China , led by
 China Mobile Ltd. (941)  at No. 9 and Industrial & Commercial Bank of
China Ltd. at No. 11.  Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN) , which ranked 14th,
overtook  Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (WMT) , which ranked 15th, to become the
most-valuable retail brand.  To contact the reporter on this story:
