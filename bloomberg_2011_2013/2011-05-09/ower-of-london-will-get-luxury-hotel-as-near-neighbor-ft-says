The former Port of  London  Authority
headquarters close to the Tower of London is to be converted
into a luxury hotel by Singapore-based KOP Properties and
Reignwood Group, a Chinese investment firm, which together
bought the building last year, the Financial Times reported,
citing Leny Suparman, KOP’s chief executive officer, and
Reignwood Chairman Chanchai Ruayrungruan.  The building, which was designed by Edwin Cooper in 1922
and hosted the inaugural meeting of the United Nations general
assembly in 1946, will have an hotel with 120 rooms, 37 private
apartments, a private members’ club, three restaurants and a
spa, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
