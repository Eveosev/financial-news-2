Meyer Burger Technology AG (MBTN)  received
antitrust clearance from  Germany ’s Federal Cartel Office in
connection with its planned takeover of  Roth & Rau AG (R8R) , the Swiss
maker of solar-power materials said today in an e-mail.  “We are very pleased that the Federal Cartel Office came
to the decision so quickly,” Peter Pauli, chief executive
officer of the Baar, Switzerland-based company, said. “This
concludes a further step in the successful takeover of Roth &
Rau.”  The biggest maker of solar panel manufacturing equipment
made a 357 million-euro ($511 million) bid for Roth & Rau on
April 11. Roth & Rau has traded above Meyer Burger’s offer of 22
euros a share since then.  Roth & Rau’s management sold their stakes to Meyer Burger
after endorsing the bid. The Hohenstein, Germany-based company
is the biggest gainer on the 98-member WilderHill New Energy
Index the past nine weeks, up 68 percent since March 1. Meyer
Burger shares have climbed 27 percent in the same period.  To contact the reporter on this story:
