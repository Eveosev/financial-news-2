SBG Securities, Standard Bank Group
Ltd.’s equity broking division, hired Voyt Krzychylkiewicz from
 Deutsche Bank AG (DBK)  to be its  South Africa  banks analyst as it
expands its equity research operations in the country.  Krzychylkiewicz will cover the South African banking and
specialty finance industries in addition to coordinating all
financial research across sub-Saharan Africa, Marc Ter Mors,
Standard Bank’s global head of equity research, said in an e-
mailed statement today.  Standard Bank, Africa’s largest bank, last year ended its
South African stock-brokerage joint venture with  Credit Suisse
Group AG (CSGN)  because both firms wanted to control their own units in
Africa’s largest economy. The banks have since been hiring
separately to compete for business in Africa’s biggest economy.  Nicole Penny will also move from Deutsche Bank to join
Krzychylkiewicz’s team as specialist finance analyst. Risto Ketola, who ran an independent research company based in
 Finland , will join SBG to cover the life assurance and general
insurance industries, Standard Bank said.  In London, the lender hired Peter Davey as head of metals
and mining research from Ambrian Partners, where he had overseen
the firm’s mining unit. Lionel Therond will also join from Fox-
Davies Capital to head oil and gas research, the bank said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
