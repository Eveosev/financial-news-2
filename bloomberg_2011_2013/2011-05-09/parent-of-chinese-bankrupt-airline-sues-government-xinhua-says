East Star Group, the parent of a
bankrupt Chinese airline, sued  China ’s aviation agency for
allegedly improperly grounding the airline’s planes, the
official Xinhua News Agency reported.  East Star Airlines, in debt after the 2008 global financial
crisis, rejected a government-initiated takeover by the parent
of state-owned Air China on March 12, 2009, three days before
regional civil aviation authorities grounded its planes, Xinhua
said.  --Helen Yuan. Editor: Joshua Fellman  To contact the Bloomberg News staff on this story
