U.K. retail sales surged the most in
five years last month as public holidays and the warmest April
on record spurred spending, the British Retail Consortium said.  Sales rose 5.2 percent in April from a year earlier on a
like-for-like basis, which excludes new-store openings, the
London-based BRC said in a report today. The reading follows a
3.5 percent annual drop in March, and taken together the data
suggest sales over the two months stalled, the BRC said.  Britons stocked up on food and clothing during two
consecutive four-day weekends at the end of the month to mark
Easter and the marriage of  Prince William  and  Kate Middleton ,
the report said. Spending may falter as consumers are squeezed
by faster inflation and the government’s fiscal tightening.  “Easter and the Royal Wedding bank holiday provided a
badly needed boost to many retailers,” BRC Director General
 Stephen Robertson  said in the report. Still, “the underlying
pressures on the retail sector of climbing costs and depressed
 consumer spending  will be problems for many months to come.”  Food sales rose an annual 2.1 percent in April, boosted by
alcoholic drinks including champagne, the BRC said. Non-food
sales fell 1.3 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
