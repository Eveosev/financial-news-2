Belgian cyclist Wouter Weylandt was
injured in a crash during today’s stage of the Giro d’Italia,
and the 26-year-old was airlifted to the hospital, according to
Eurosport.  Television video showed paramedics giving an unconscious
Weylandt cardiopulmonary resuscitation after they’d cut his
helmet off, the broadcaster said. The Leopard-Trek rider fell
during a downhill portion about 25 kilometers (15.5 miles) from
the end of the 173-kilometer stage between Reggio nell’Emilia
and Rapallo in  Italy .  He’d won the third stage of the race last year.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
