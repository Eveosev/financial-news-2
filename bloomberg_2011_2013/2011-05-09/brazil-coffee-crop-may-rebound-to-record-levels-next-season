Brazil ’s coffee harvest may rebound 12
percent next season as producers take advantage of a doubling of
prices in the past year, according to the  International Coffee
Organization .  The world’s biggest producer of arabica beans will “match
or even exceed” the 48 million bags reached last season,  ICO 
Executive Director Jose Sette said today in a telephone
interview from Istanbul. Current prices give “all sorts of
incentives for growers” to maximize production, which is
expected to be around 43 million bags this season, he said  Arabica coffee reached a 14-year high on May 3 as adverse
weather hampered production in  Colombia . The Andean nation is
the second-largest producer after Brazil of mild arabica beans
used by specialty brewers like  Starbucks Corp. (SBUX)   Arabica coffee for July delivery fell 0.15 cent to $2.8740
a pound at 2:00 p.m. on ICE Futures U.S. in  New York . Earlier,
it gained as much as 2.3 percent. Coffee reached $3.089 a pound
on May 3, the highest since May 1997.  Higher prices will slow global coffee demand growth in 2011
from last year, when consumption climbed 2.4 percent to 134
million bags, according to Sette. Consumption growth this year
will be less than that of last year or unchanged, he said.  Worldwide, production will be little changed in the crop
year beginning in 2011 from the prior season’s estimated 133
million bags because of the lower-yielding half of a two-year
cycle in Brazil. Output will be a “bit less or almost equal,”
he said.  Brazil produced a record 48.5 million bags in 2002,
according to Brazil’s Agriculture Ministry’s crop forecasting
agency, known as Conab.  To contact the reporter on this story:
