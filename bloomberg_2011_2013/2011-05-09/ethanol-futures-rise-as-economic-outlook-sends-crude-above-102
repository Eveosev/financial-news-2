Ethanol futures advanced as crude oil
rose above $102 a barrel on signals that the global economic
recovery remains intact.  The grain-based gasoline additive moved higher as crude
futures climbed 5.5 percent after a report today showed German
exports surged to a record in March and the U.S. Labor
Department said last week that payrolls expanded.  “The major thing is that crude oil is up $5.45 and it’s
pushing the ethanol market higher today,” said John Janney, a
trader at Citigroup Global Markets Inc. in  Chicago . “We’ve had
a big sell-off in commodities in the last 10 days and I think
we’re coming back up a little with crude and gold up and the
weaker dollar.”  Denatured ethanol for June delivery rose 3.8 cents, or 1.5
percent, to $2.56 a gallon on the Chicago Board of Trade.  In cash market trading ethanol in  New York  tumbled 0.5
cent, or 0.2 percent, to $2.655 a gallon and in Chicago the
additive decreased 1 cent, or 0.4 percent, to $2.555, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Ethanol in the U.S. Gulf gained 5 cents, or 1.9 percent, to
$2.755 a gallon and on the West Coast ethanol was unchanged at
$2.765 a gallon.  Crude oil for June delivery rose $5.37 to settle at $102.55
a barrel on the  New York Mercantile Exchange , the biggest one-
day gain since Feb. 22. Futures dropped 15 percent in the five
days ended May 6, the largest weekly decline since December
2008. Prices are up 37 percent from a year ago.  Gasoline for June delivery rose 18.83 cents, or 6.1
percent, to settle at $3.2784 a gallon on the New York
Mercantile Exchange. It was the first gain in six days and
follows a loss of 11 percent last week.  To contact the reporter on this story:
