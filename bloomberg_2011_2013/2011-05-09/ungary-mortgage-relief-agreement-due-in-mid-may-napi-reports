The Hungarian government and domestic
banks may reach a final agreement on a plan to help foreign-
currency mortgage holders in difficulty meeting their payments,
Napi Gazdasag reported, citing a bank executive.  The deadline for an agreement was extended by two weeks
from the end of April, Daniel Gyuris, head of OTP Bank Nyrt.â€™s
mortgage unit and board member of the Bank Association, told the
newspaper.  He added that the moratorium on evictions would be lifted
as of July 1, Napi reported. The government may offer interest
subsidies on home purchases to a limited number of distressed
borrowers, Gyuris also told the newspaper.  To contact the reporters on this story:
