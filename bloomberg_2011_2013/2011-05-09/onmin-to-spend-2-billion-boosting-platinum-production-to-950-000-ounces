Lonmin Plc (LMI) , the world’s third-largest
producer of the platinum, plans to spend about $2 billion over
the five years to 2015 to increase production to 950,000 ounces
annually.  Lonmin may also consider “corporate action” in the second
half of the fiscal 2011 year and will, in the next 12 months or
so, consider when to reopen its Limpopo operation, shut after
platinum prices fell in 2008.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
