Saab Automobile AB, the carmaker that
formed a partnership with  China ’s Hawtai Motor Group last week
after a cash crunch forced it to halt production, named Timothy Colbeck chief operating officer for  North America .  Colbeck had worked at  Fuji Heavy Industries Ltd. (7270) ’s Subaru
of America unit for 25 years, most recently as senior vice
president for sales, Stockholm-based Saab said today in a
statement. He will report to Matthias Seidl, Saab’s global sales
chief, and the company’s North America board.  Saab, sold by General Motors Co. last year, is getting a
120 million-euro ($172 million) investment from Beijing-based
Hawtai under a plan that calls for joint production in China.
Hawtai will receive as much as 29.9 percent of Saab’s owner,
 Spyker Cars NV (SPYKR) , and will loan Zeewolde, Netherlands-based Spyker
30 million euros, according to the May 3 accord.  The Swedish automaker was forced to stop building cars
March 29 and after a brief restart last month again halted
vehicle output. The company said on May 2 that it planned to
begin production within a week, after getting a 30 million-euro
loan from Gemini Investment Fund Ltd. and saying it would draw
down 29.1 million euros from the EIB, the European Union’s
lending arm.  Saab also is trying to bring in Russian banker  Vladimir
Antonov  as an investor. GM on April 28 said it tentatively
agreed to allow an Antonov investment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
