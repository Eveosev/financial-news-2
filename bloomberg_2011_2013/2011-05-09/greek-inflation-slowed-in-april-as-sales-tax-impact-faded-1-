Greek inflation slowed in April as the
impact from higher sales taxes began to fade.  Consumer prices calculated using European Union methods
rose 3.7 percent from a year earlier, compared with a 4.3
percent increase in March, the  Hellenic Statistical Authority 
said in an e-mailed statement from Athens today. The April rate
was two percentage points less than in September, when inflation
accelerated to a 13-year high. The rate based on Greek
methodology eased to 3.9 percent from 4.5 percent.  Prices for alcohol and tobacco were 12 percent higher in
April than a year earlier after the introduction of excise
duties in January. That was less than March’s 20.2 percent.  Prime Minister  George Papandreou ’s government increased
sales taxes in a bid to narrow a  budget deficit  that reached
15.4 percent of gross domestic product in 2009. Inflation slowed
by one percentage point in the first two months of this year, as
retailers absorbed some of the impact of sales taxes introduced
in January, before unexpectedly quickening in March.  Transport costs increased 7.6 percent in April because of
higher oil prices, excise duties and an increase in public-
transit fares.  To contact the reporter on this story:
