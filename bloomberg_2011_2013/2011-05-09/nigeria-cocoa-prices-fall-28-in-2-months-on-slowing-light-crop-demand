Cocoa prices received by farmers in
 Nigeria , the world’s fourth-largest producer, fell by as much as
28 percent from a record high two months ago on declining
demand, according to Neji Abang Neji, secretary general of the
Cocoa Association of Nigeria.  Prices have fallen because there is low demand for the so-
called light-crop beans, which the farmers are harvesting
currently, he said.  “Demand is always low because you have to crush more beans
to get the right quantity of butter that you need,” Neji said
by phone today from Akure, capital of the western Ondo state,
Nigeria’s leading cocoa producing area.  Farmgate prices are 400,000 naira ($2,567) a metric ton in
Akure, and 384,000 naira a ton in Ikom, in the south, down from
an all-time high of about 535,000 naira a ton in early March, he
said.  Cocoa is Nigeria’s second-biggest foreign-exchange earner
after crude oil, according to figures published by the Nigerian
government. Only the  Ivory Coast ,  Ghana  and  Indonesia  produce
more cocoa, according to the  International Cocoa Organization .  The light-crop, the smaller of two annual harvests, usually
begins in March and ends in June.  To contact the reporter on this story:
