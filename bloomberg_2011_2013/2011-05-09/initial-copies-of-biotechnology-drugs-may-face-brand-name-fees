Drugmakers seeking U.S. approval for
the first lower-cost copies of biologic medicines made from
living cells should initially pay application fees similar to
charges for brand-name medicines, regulators said.  The  Food and Drug Administration  plans to break down the
cost to review so-called biosimilars into separate payments with
more money charged up front during development, according to a
 proposal  released today. The fees will be assessed annually and
followed by application charges, establishment and product fees
required for all drugs.  Generic-drug companies led by  Teva Pharmaceutical
Industries Ltd. (TEVA)  and  Novartis AG (NOVN) ’s Sandoz division have urged the
FDA to create a pathway to start reviewing biosimilars as
required by last year’s health-care law. Access to lower-cost
versions of biologic medicines for cancer, arthritis and rare
genetic diseases would save $25 billion in a decade, the
 Congressional Budget Office  estimates.  “Given that the approval pathway for biosimilar and
interchangeable biological products is new, FDA services are
most critical for continued and successful development of
biosimilar and interchangeable biological products during the
investigational stage prior to submission of a marketing
application,” the agency said in its Federal Register notice.  The European Union approved its first biosimilar in 2006.
The FDA’s proposal covers fiscal years 2013 to 2017, and
comments will be accepted on the plan until June 9.  To contact the reporter on this story:
