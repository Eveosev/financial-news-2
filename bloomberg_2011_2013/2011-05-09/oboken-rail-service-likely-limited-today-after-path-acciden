Train service in and out of Hoboken,
 New Jersey , likely will be limited today, after a PATH train
crashed there yesterday morning, injuring 42 people.  The train hit an abutment at the end of the track,  Port
Authority  of  New York  and New Jersey spokeswoman Justine Karp
said in an interview. The injured were treated on site or at
area hospitals and all injuries were minor, she said.  Service at the PATH station, operated by the Port
Authority, was suspended and the PATH website directed
passengers to use light rail or the ferry service, which are
also available at the station. Crews worked to restore service
last night and at least one of the three tracks was expected to
remain out of service this morning, according to the  city of
Hoboken’s website .  The city of Hoboken said yesterday the accident is being
investigated by the  National Transportation Safety Board .  NJ Transit will be providing additional bus service this
morning, according to the Hoboken website, which also said
ferries operated by NY Waterway will have capacity to take
additional commuters.  The Hoboken PATH station delivers Manhattan commuters into
stations at the World Trade Center and as far north as 33rd
Street. PATH averages 246,890 passenger trips every 24 hours,
and almost 74 million a year, according to the system’s  website .  To contact the reporters on this story:
