Origin Energy Ltd. (ORG) , an Australian oil
and gas exploration company, bought 40 percent of the Chilean
geothermal developer  Energia Andina SA  as it seeks to tap the
regions’s subterranean energy reserves.  Energia Andina has permits to evaluate the geothermal
potential of eight sites in northern and central  Chile  covering
553,400 hectares (1.4 million acres), Sydney-based Origin Energy
said today on its  website . The price wasn’t disclosed.  Chile may have as much as 16 gigawatts of geothermal
resources available, according to the statement, and is
estimated to have 60 percent of all of Latin America’s potential
underground energy.  “It is our view that geothermal can provide large-scale,
renewable, baseload energy and Chile has significant
potential,” Origin’s Executive Director Karen Moses said in the
statement.  Origin purchased the stake from Chile’s state-owned oil
refiner Empresa Nacional del Petroleo. The remaining 60 percent
of Santiago-based Energia Andina is owned by the London-based
mining company  Antofagasta Plc. (ANTO)   To contact the editor responsible for this story:
