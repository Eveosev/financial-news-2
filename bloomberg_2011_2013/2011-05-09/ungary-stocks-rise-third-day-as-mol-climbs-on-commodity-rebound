Hungarian stocks fell to a three-week
low, snapping two days of gains after Standard & Poor’s
downgrade of Greek debt reignited concern  Europe ’s debt crisis
may spread. The forint weakened.  The benchmark BUX index of shares slid 0.4 percent to
23,614.21, the lowest close since April 19, by the 5 p.m. end of
trade in Budapest. It rose as much as 0.4 percent earlier today.
OTP Bank Nyrt., the country’s largest lender, dropped 1.4
percent to 6,251 forint. The forint depreciated 0.3 percent to
265.42 per euro.  “In the absence of important macroeconomic data, the
sentiment surrounding the Greek events may influence markets
today,” Zoltan Arokszallasi, an analyst at Erste Group Bank AG
in Budapest, wrote in a research report today.  Greece ’s credit rating was cut two levels to B from BB- by
 Standard & Poor’s , which said further reductions are possible as
the risk of default rises.  To contact the reporter on this story:
