Poland’s WIG20 Index climbed for a
second day, increasing 3.09, or 0.1 percent, to 2,870.28 at
10:43 a.m. in Warsaw.  The following are among the most active stocks on the
 Warsaw Stock Exchange  today. Stock symbols follow company names.  Bank Handlowy SA (BHW PW), controlled by Citigroup Inc.,
sank 3.45 zloty, or 3.4 percent, to 98.25 zloty, falling for the
first time in three days. Net interest income slipped 6.8
percent to 347.2 million zloty ($128 million) in the first
quarter from a year earlier, the bank said in a regulatory
statement today.  KGHM Polska Miedz SA (KGH)  , the copper producer with the
biggest European mine output, rose for the first time in four
days, adding 1.8 zloty, or 1 percent, to 185.7 zloty. Copper
rebounded from a five-month low after stronger-than-forecast
U.S. jobs growth boosted confidence in the demand outlook in the
world’s second-largest user of the metal.  Grupa Lotos SA (LTS)  , Poland’s second-largest oil
refiner, increased 0.52 zloty, or 1.2 percent, to 45.7 zloty.
Oil rose in  New York , rebounding from the biggest weekly decline
since 2008, as signs of an improving economy in the U.S., the
world’s largest crude consumer, stoked speculation last week’s
slump was exaggerated.  To contact the reporter on this story:
