The cost of protecting U.S. corporate
bonds from default fell as earnings reports exceeding analyst
forecasts bolstered optimism about economic growth.  The Markit CDX North America Investment Grade Index, which
investors use to hedge against losses on corporate debt or to
speculate on creditworthiness, decreased 1.1 basis points to a
mid-price of 89.3 basis points as of 5:02 p.m. in New York,
according to index administrator Markit Group Ltd.  Credit-default swaps are declining as investors grow more
confident that the economy is improving, helping borrowers to
repay their obligations. More than 72 percent of companies in
the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index that reported earnings for the
last quarter exceeded analysts’ estimates, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  “Corporate fundamentals were much better than people were
expecting in first-quarter earnings,” said George Bory, chief
corporate credit strategist for UBS AG in  Stamford ,  Connecticut .
“The CDS market has shown impressive resilience in the face of
macro shocks because of an underlying strong fundamental
story.”  Credit swaps pay the buyer face value if a borrower fails
to meet its obligations, less the value of the defaulted debt. A
basis point equals $1,000 annually on a contract protecting $10
million of debt.  The index, which typically falls as investor confidence
improves and rises as it deteriorates, has moved by a basis
point or less each day this month because “the reality is that
credit remains firmly underpinned,” Bory said in a telephone
interview.  To contact the reporter on this story:
