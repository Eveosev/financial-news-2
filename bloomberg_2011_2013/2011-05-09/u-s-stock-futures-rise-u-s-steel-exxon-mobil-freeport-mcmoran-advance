U.S. stocks were little changed
following the biggest weekly drop for the  Standard & Poor’s  500
Index since March as concern over  Greece ’s debt crisis offset a
rebound in commodity prices.  ConocoPhillips (COP)  and  Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold Inc. (FCX) 
paced gains in commodity producers as oil halted a five-day
slump and metal prices advanced. Financial shares were the
biggest drag on the  S&P 500  after Standard & Poor’s lowered
Greece’s debt rating.  Citigroup Inc. (C)  slumped 2 percent following
a 1-for-10 reverse stock split.  The S&P 500 fell less than 0.1 percent to 1,339.79 at 10:21
a.m. in New York. The  Dow Jones Industrial Average  was little
changed at 12,638.43.  “Greece’s downgrade put some pressure as it’s a
confirmation of the rumors that had been floating out there,”
said  Peter Jankovskis , who helps manage about $2.8 billion at
Oakbrook Investments in Lisle,  Illinois . “For some people,
that’s kind of their last straw.”  Stock-index futures reversed early gains before the open of
U.S. exchanges after Greece’s credit rating was cut two levels
to B from BB- by S&P, which said further reductions are
possible, with private investors at risk if maturities are
extended on the nation’s emergency-aid package.  The S&P 500 fell 1.7 percent last week, its biggest decline
since March, following a rout in raw materials that knocked off
$99 billion of market value from commodities. The S&P 500 is
still up 6.6 this year through May 6 amid government stimulus
measures and higher-than-estimated corporate profits. Earnings-
per-share have beaten estimates at 72 percent of the 420 S&P 500
companies that have reported results since April 11, Bloomberg
data show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
