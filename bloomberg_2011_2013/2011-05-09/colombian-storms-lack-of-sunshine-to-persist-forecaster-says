Colombia , the world’s second-largest
producer of arabica coffee, likely will have above-average
rainfall and lack of sunshine this month as the weather pattern
known as La Nina persists, said an international weather
forecaster.  The effects of La Nina haven’t eased yet in Colombia as in
other South American nations, said Rodney Martinez, scientific
coordinator at the Guayaquil, Ecuador-based International Center
for the Investigation of the El Nino Phenomenon.  “You’ll still see a situation of heavy rainfall in May,”
he said in a May 6 telephone interview. “It will be pretty
similar” to April, he said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
