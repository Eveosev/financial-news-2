Pakistani media have named the man
they say is the Central Intelligence Agency’s station chief in
Islamabad, the  Wall Street Journal  said, citing reports by the
ARY television channel and The Nation newspaper.  The reports have prompted questions about whether
 Pakistan ’s government attempted to expose a CIA operative
following Osama bin Laden’s killing, the Journal said. The CIA’s
Islamabad station chief oversees the agency’s covert programs
that target al-Qaeda and Taliban militants, the U.S. paper said.  The U.S. is not planning to withdraw the station chief, who
was posted to Pakistan six months ago, it reported. His
predecessor was pulled from the country when a lawsuit filed in
December identified him, the Journal said.  The Journal said the name given for the CIA chief in the
May 7 edition of The Nation was inaccurate, without giving
further details.  A spokesman for the U.S. Embassy in Islamabad, Alberto
Rodriguez, said in a cellphone text message today that he was
unable to comment on the reports.  To contact the reporters on this story:
