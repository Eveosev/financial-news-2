ThyssenKrupp AG (TKA)  may have to spend more
than intended on a new steel plant in Brazil,  Financial Times
Deutschland  reported, citing unidentified people familiar with
the situation.  Costs may increase as the plant takes longer than planned
to reach full capacity and because of problems with its coke
ovens, the newspaper said. The German company will need to spend
about 500 million euros ($719 million) on coking coal and other
raw materials as a result, FTD said.  German President  Christian Wulff  canceled a visit to the
Brazilian factory on May 6 because ThyssenKrupp failed to tell
him about plans to dispose of units with about 35,000 workers
and 10 billion euros in sales, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
