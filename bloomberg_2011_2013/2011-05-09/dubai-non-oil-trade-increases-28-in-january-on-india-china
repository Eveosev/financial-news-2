Dubaiâ€™s non-oil trade increased 28
percent in January to $15 billion, boosted by trade with India
and  China , the Economist Intelligence Unit reported today,
citing statistics from the Dubai Customs Authority.  Foreign investment in Dubai is expected to jump 30 percent
in 2011, fueled by an influx of companies from  South America  and
China, EIU said in an e-mailed statement today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
