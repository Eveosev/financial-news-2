Japan ’s bonds advanced, driving 10-
year yields toward this year’s low, after a downgrade of Greece
by  Standard & Poor’s  boosted demand for safer assets.  The rating was lowered to B from BB- by S&P yesterday,
which said further reductions are possible as the risk of
default rises. Demand for debt was bolstered after Goldman Sachs
Group Inc. decreased its 2011 growth estimate for Japan, citing
supply disruptions after a record earthquake in March.  “Investors are buying bonds to reduce risk on the back of
concern about a global slowdown and Europe’s debt problem,”
said Takehito Yoshino, chief  fund manager  at Mizuho Trust &
Banking Co. in Tokyo, a unit of Japan’s No. 3 bank by market
value. “ Greece ’s situation is worse than a year earlier.”  The benchmark 10-year yield retreated half a basis point to
1.135 percent as of 3:20 p.m. in Tokyo at Japan Bond Trading
Co., the nation’s largest interdealer debt broker. The 1.3
percent security due March 2021 rose 0.045 yen to 101.462 yen.  The yield fell to 1.125 percent yesterday, the lowest level
since Dec. 30. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  Ten-year bond futures for June delivery gained 0.08 to
140.66 at the 3 p.m. close of the Tokyo Stock Exchange.  Greece is scheduled to auction 1.25 billion euros ($1.79
billion) of 182-day bills today. S&P lowered the country’s
credit rating to B from BB- yesterday, the fourth cut since
April 2010, saying that further reductions are possible. Another
cut would make Greece the lowest-rated nation in  Europe .  Japan’s gross domestic product will shrink 0.2 percent this
year and expand 2.6 percent in 2012, according to the latest
predictions by Tokyo-based Goldman Sachs economists Naohiko Baba
and Chiwoong Lee, released in an e-mailed note today. The
analysts had previously seen a 0.7 percent gain for this year
and 2.3 percent growth in 2012.  Japan’s government debt rose to 924.4 trillion yen ($11.5
trillion) as of the end of March, the Ministry of Finance said
today. The debt, up from 919.15 trillion yen the previous
quarter, includes  government bonds , borrowings and financing
bills, according to a statement on the ministry’s website.  To contact the reporters on this story:
