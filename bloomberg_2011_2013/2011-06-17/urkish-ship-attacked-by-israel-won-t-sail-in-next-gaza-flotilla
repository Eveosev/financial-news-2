The Mavi Marmara, the ship on which
Israeli commandos killed nine Turkish activists who tried to
break the naval blockade of the  Gaza Strip  last year, won’t sail
in a second international flotilla to the Palestinian enclave,
the organizers of the planned voyage said.  About 10 ships with representatives from 20 countries will
head to Gaza in a renewed attempt to break  Israel ’s embargo by
delivering aid, the group behind the effort, called Freedom
Flotilla II, said today in an e-mailed statement.  The Humanitarian Relief Foundation, the Turkish Islamic
charity organization that is refitting the Mavi Marmara, will
continue to be a part of the next flotilla, according to the
statement. Technical problems will prevent the Turkish ship from
joining the other vessels when they head for Gaza on June 25,
the  Associated Press  cited the IHH as saying.  Israel, which says it needs to limit and monitor cargo
going into Gaza to prevent weapons from entering, said its
commandos were trying to stop last year’s flotilla and that
those on board the Mavi Marmara attacked first. Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu’s spokesman,  Mark Regev , has called the new
flotilla “an unnecessary provocation” and “a political stunt”
to back the Islamic Hamas group that controls Gaza.  To contact the reporter on this story:
