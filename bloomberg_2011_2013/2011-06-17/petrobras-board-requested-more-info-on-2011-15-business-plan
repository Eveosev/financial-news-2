Petroleo Brasileiro SA (PETR4) , the state-
controlled  oil company , said its board requested further
analysis and studies for its 2011-2015 business plan after
reviewing it today.  Petrobras, as the Rio de Janeiro-based producer is known,
didn’t say when the new plan will be released in a regulatory
filing today. Petrobras is revising its $224 billion five-year
investment plan, the largest in the oil industry, to include the
development of 5 billion barrels of reserves it bought from the
government last year.  “They should be extremely careful about it to increase
returns on investments,” Auro Rozenbaum, an analyst at Bradesco
in  Sao Paulo , said in a telephone interview. “There is some
room for postponements, especially in downstream,” he said,
referring to Petrobras’s refining projects.  Petrobras plans to more than double production to 6 million
barrels a day of oil and natural gas by 2020, the company said
on June 8. Petrobras is developing the largest oil discoveries
in the Americas in more than three decades, including the 6.5-
billion-barrel Lula field in deep waters of the Atlantic Ocean.  Petrobras Chief Executive OfficerJose Sergio Gabrielli
said June 8 that the new plan would have “marginal” changes.  To contact the reporter on this story:
