Metallurgical coal prices were mixed
this week in the U.S. spot market as buyers resisted paying
higher prices for the steelmaking component, according to Energy
Publishing Inc.  Spot prices for low-volatility coking coal fell 25 cents to
$315 a ton in the week ended today, the  Knoxville, Tennessee-
based  data provider reported. High-volatility coal dipped $6.58,
or 2.4 percent, to $269.33.  “Buyers perceive that the price is too high, but there
isn’t a corner in which to hide,” Energy Publishing said.  Energy Publishing says it surveys buyers and sellers of
coal to determine pricing.  To contact the reporter on this story:
