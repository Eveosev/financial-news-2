Volkswagen AG (VOW)  and  Bayerische Motoren
Werke AG (BMW)  led  Europe ’s strongest car-sales recovery in 14 months
in May, as new models attracted buyers in Germany and  France .  Registrations rose 7.6 percent from a year earlier to 1.25
million vehicles, the  European Automobile Manufacturers’
Association  said today in a statement. Five-month sales
decreased 0.4 percent.  Demand in Germany and France, Europe’s two biggest car
markets, expanded 22 percent and 6.1 percent, respectively.
European car deliveries have declined every month except two
since April 2010, after an end to government cash-for-clunker
programs curtailed demand.  “The European market shows signs of recovery,” said  Fiat
SpA (F)  head of sales Andrea Formica. “It’s still a two-speed
market. Germany and France are growing, while Italy, Spain and
 Greece  are still facing difficulties,” Formica told reporters
at a Fiat model presentation June 14.  Volkswagen, Europe’s biggest carmaker, benefited from the
sales rebound in its German home market as Europe’s largest
economy grows. The VW group recorded a 16 percent sales increase
last month to 299,841 vehicles. Its European market share rose
to 23.9 percent. BMW sales advanced 22 percent to 77,784 cars.  European sales at  General Motors Co. (GM)  rose 16 percent to
110,157 vehicles. Sales for  Ford Motor Co. (F) , based in Dearborn,
 Michigan , rose 9.7 percent last month.  Toyota Motor Corp. (7203)  and
 Renault SA (RNO)  recorded declines of 9.5 percent and 8 percent.  Fiat, which also runs Chrysler Group LLC, continued to lose
market share, falling to 7.3 percent from 7.8 percent, while
sales rose 0.2 percent led by a surge in Alfa Romeo SpA
deliveries. Chief Executive Officer  Sergio Marchionne  expects to
recover share in the second half of the year with new models
such as the subcompact Lancia Ypsilon and the Fiat Freemont, a
European version of the Dodge Journey.  Sales have declined in the region for the last three years,
dropping to 13.8 million vehicles in 2010 from 16 million in
2007, the last year deliveries gained, according to ACEA.  To contact the reporter on this story:
