Juan Mauricio Soler’s condition is
improving after the top climber at the 2007 Tour de  France 
sustained head injuries during a race in  Switzerland , his
Movistar team said in a statement.  Swelling in the Colombian rider’s brain has decreased,
although he remains in a serious but stable condition in an
intensive care unit at Hospital Sankt Gallen, team doctor
Alfredo Zuinga said. Soler crashed into a barrier yesterday
during stage six of the Tour of Switzerland.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
