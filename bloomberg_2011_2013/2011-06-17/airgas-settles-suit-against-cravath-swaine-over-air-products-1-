Airgas Inc. said it settled a
lawsuit accusing Cravath Swaine & Moore LLP of having access to
confidential information while helping rival  Air Products &
Chemicals Inc. (APD)  prepare a failed takeover offer.  Airgas, the Radnor, Pennsylvania-based distributor of
industrial gases, sued Cravath in state court in Philadelphia in
February 2010 claiming the New York firm violated state ethics
rules prohibiting conflicts of interest. The case, which sought
to bar Cravath from representing Air Products, was later
transferred to federal court.  “The lawsuit has been dismissed by agreement of the
parties,” Airgas said today in a statement. “The terms of the
settlement are confidential.”  Cravath served as Airgas’s legal counsel in at least 25
financing deals from 2001 to October 2009 when it notified the
company it could no longer continue in that role because of a
conflict.  Air Products pursued Airgas beginning in February 2010
before dropping its $5.9 billion hostile bid a year later after
a Delaware judge upheld the company’s anti-takeover defense.  Robin Shanzer, a spokeswoman for Cravath, didn’t
immediately return a phone call seeking comment.  The case is  Airgas Inc. (ARG)  v. Cravath, Swaine & Moore LLP,
10-612, U.S. District Court Eastern District of  Pennsylvania 
(Philadelphia).  To contact the reporter on this story:
