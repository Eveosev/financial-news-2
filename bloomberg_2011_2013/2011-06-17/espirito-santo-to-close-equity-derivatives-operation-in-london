Banco Espirito Santo SA (BES) , Portugal’s
biggest publicly traded bank, shut its equity derivatives unit
in London to reallocate capital to other divisions.  “Espirito Santo Investment Bank is closing its London
derivatives business in order to focus on the core cash equities
and emerging markets businesses,” spokeswoman Sarah Gestetner
said in a statement today. “Globally, Espirito Santo Investment
Bank will continue to offer derivatives products to clients.”  Nick Tranter, who led the unit, and his team of seven will
all leave the firm. The group worked at Execution Noble Ltd.
before Banco Espirito Santo’s investment-banking arm bought a
50.1 percent stake in the London-based broker in February.  Investment banks in the U.K. and Europe have been
eliminating staff after a decline in revenue.  Royal Bank of
Scotland Group Plc (RBS)  plans to cut 200 posts at its securities
division and  Barclays Plc (BARC)  is eliminating as many as 50 jobs at
its equities unit.  To contact the reporters on this story:
