India ’s 10-year bonds completed the
first weekly loss this month after the central bank increased
 interest rates  for a 10th time since the start of 2010 to curb
inflation.  The  Reserve Bank of India  raised the repurchase rate
yesterday by 25 basis points, or 0.25 percentage point, to 7.5
percent. The wholesale-price index rose 9.06 percent in May from
a year earlier, compared with 8.66 percent in April, official
data showed on June 14.  “The fundamentals are quite negative for bonds,” said
Pradeep Madhav, Mumbai-based managing director at Securities
Trading Corp. “Inflation continues to be a worry and the
central bank continues to be hawkish.”  The yield on the 7.8 percent note due April 2021 rose four
basis points this week to 8.27 percent as of the 5 p.m. close in
Mumbai, according to the central bank’s trading system. The rate
fell three basis points today.  The  Reserve Bank  said yesterday that “domestic inflation
risks remain high,” adding “some short-run deceleration in
growth may be unavoidable in bringing inflation under control.”  “Our major challenge in the short term is inflation,”
Finance Minister Pranab Mukherjee told a conference in  New Delhi 
today. The management of inflationary pressures “is critically
dependent” on boosting farm production and “taking steps to
moderate aggregate demand,” he said.  The cost of one-year interest-rate swaps, or derivative
contracts used to guard against fluctuations in borrowing costs,
rose three basis points this week to 7.93 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
