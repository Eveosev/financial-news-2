Siemens AG entered the photovoltaic
production business by acquiring a 16.1 percent stake in
Semprius Inc., a U.S. maker of high-efficiency solar modules.  Semprius, founded in 2005 and based in Durham, North-
Carolina, employs 33 people in developing solar modules that
increase efficiency by using lenses to concentrate sunlight onto
cells that produce power. Terms weren’t disclosed.  The purchase is the first acquisition by Siemens in the
photovoltaic business, said Eva-Maria Baumann, a spokeswoman for
the company’s Siemens Energy unit. The Munich-based company will
help Semprius set up production.  “This is a technology that can provide higher efficiency
levels than conventional photovoltaic and we have high hopes for
it,” Baumann said today by telephone.  Siemens,  Germany ’s largest engineering company, acts as a
general contractor on solar projects, responsible for planning,
designing, delivery and installation of solar power generating
systems. It’s also active in solar thermal energy, in which the
sun’s energy is used to heat a fluid that generates steam for
turning power generators.  Editor: Reed Landberg  To contact the reporter on this story:
