Scotland  introduced a package of new
laws designed to tackle sectarian behavior related to soccer,
with five-year jail terms.  The draft bill is expected to be passed by the Scottish
Parliament in Edinburgh in time for the start of the new soccer
season, the Scottish government said in a statement today.  “The legislation seeks to create two new offences relating
to offensive behaviour that can incite religious, racial or
other forms of hatred, in and around football grounds and on the
Internet,” the statement said.  Police in April investigated explosives sent to the coach
of Celtic, one of the country’s two biggest clubs, and two
prominent supporters. The attacks were the latest in an
escalation of tension within Scottish soccer centering on
Glasgow clubs Celtic and Rangers. As well as representing
different parts of the city, the teams are traditionally divided
between Catholics and Protestants.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
