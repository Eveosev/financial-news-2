(Corrects to show only one member voted against the
transaction in second paragraph of story originally published
June 14.)  BRF - Brasil Foods SA (BRFS3) , the world’s
largest poultry exporter, asked local regulators to postpone a
final ruling on its purchase of Sadia SA as it seeks to
negotiate an agreement to save the two-year-old deal.  Brasil Foods Chief Executive Officer Jose Antonio do Prado Fay and vice-president of institutional relations Wilson Mello
asked antitrust agency board member Ricardo Ruiz yesterday in
Brasilia to delay the vote. The agency, known as Cade, is
scheduled to convene tomorrow to analyze the acquisition,
according to Mello. One commissioner voted to block the deal
last week.  “If we want to reach an agreement, we need time to
discuss,” Mello told reporters yesterday. “We want Cade to
reach the best decision, we’re not trying to influence anyone.”  The regulator suspended the vote on the merger last week
after Carlos Ragazzo, the commissioner responsible for
presenting a report on the case, recommended the merger be
undone.  Brasil Foods  wields too much market share and is able to
raise prices without losing customers, he said.  Brasil Foods won’t meet with Cade today and hasn’t
presented an agreement proposal, Mello said yesterday. Ruiz left
without speaking to reporters after meeting with Brasil Food
executives.  To contact the reporter on this story:
