The following companies are having
unusual price changes in  Mexico  trading. Stock symbols are in
parentheses and prices are as of 12:12 p.m. New York time.  The IPC index was little changed at 35,235.65.  Homebuilders were among the biggest gainers in Mexico as
European leaders moved closer to a compromise on a financial
rescue for  Greece , fueling demand for riskier emerging-market
assets.  Consorcio Ara SAB (ARA* MM), Mexico’s fourth-largest
homebuilder, jumped 2.4 percent to 6.01 pesos, erasing
yesterday’s 2 percent retreat. Corp. Geo SAB (GEOB MM), Mexico’s
second-largest homebuilder, added 0.5 percent to 25.72 pesos.  Cemex SAB (CEMEXCPO MM), the largest cement maker in the
Americas, advanced 0.7 percent to 9.27 pesos. The index of U.S.
leading indicators rose more than forecast in May, a sign
economic growth may pick up by the end of 2011 in Cemex’s
second-biggest market. Cemex gets about 18 percent of its
revenue from the U.S. and 24 percent from Mexico.  To contact the reporter on this story:
