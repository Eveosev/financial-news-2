The following is the text of the U.S.
state employment report from the Bureau of Labor Statistics.  Regional and state unemployment rates were little changed
in May. Twenty-four states recorded unemployment rate decreases,
13 states and the  District of Columbia  registered rate increases,
and 13 states had no rate change, the U.S. Bureau of Labor
Statistics reported today. Forty-three states and the District
of Columbia posted unemployment rate decreases from a year
earlier, four states reported increases, and three states had no
change. The national jobless rate was essentially unchanged at
9.1 percent, but was 0.5 percentage point lower than a year
earlier.  In May, nonfarm payroll employment increased in 22 states,
decreased in 27 states and the District of Columbia, and was
unchanged in 1 state. The largest over-the-month increase in
employment occurred in  Florida  (+28,000), followed by Ohio
(+12,000), Arizona and Louisiana (+10,100 each), and  Texas 
(+8,800). Wyoming experienced the largest over-the-month
percentage increase in employment (+0.8 percent), followed by
 Louisiana  (+0.5 percent) and Arizona and Florida (+0.4 percent
each). The largest over-the-month decrease in employment
occurred in California (-29,200), followed by  New York  (-24,700),
 Pennsylvania  (-14,200),  Michigan  (-13,400), and Maryland (-
13,300). Alaska experienced the largest over-the-month
percentage decline in employment (-1.5 percent), followed by
Vermont (-1.2 percent), Delaware (-0.9 percent), and  West
Virginia  (-0.7 percent). Over the year, nonfarm employment
increased in 39 states and decreased in 11 states and the
District of Columbia. The largest over-the-year percentage
increase occurred in  North Dakota  (+4.3 percent), followed by
Texas (+2.0 percent),  Nebraska  (+1.9 percent), and Wyoming (+1.7
percent). The largest over-the-year percent decrease in
employment occurred in Maryland (-0.8 percent), followed by  New
Mexico  (-0.7 percent) and Georgia and  Nevada  (-0.6 percent each).  Regional Unemployment (Seasonally Adjusted)  The West reported the highest regional unemployment rate in
May, 10.3 percent, while the Northeast and Midwest recorded the
lowest rates, 8.0 and 8.1 percent, respectively. The West was
the only region to experience a statistically significant over-
the-month rate change (-0.1 percentage point). All four regions
registered significant rate decreases from a year earlier: the
Midwest (-1.5 percentage points), Northeast (-0.8 point), West
(-0.7 point), and South (-0.5 point).  Among the nine geographic divisions, the Pacific continued
to report the highest jobless rate, 10.9 percent in May. The
West North Central again registered the lowest rate, 6.7 percent.
The Mountain was the only division to experience a statistically
significant over-the-month unemployment rate change (-0.2
percentage point). Over the year, six divisions posted
significant rate changes, all decreases; the largest of these
was in the East North Central (-1.8 percentage points).  State Unemployment (Seasonally Adjusted)  Nevada continued to register the highest unemployment rate
among the states, 12.1 percent in May.  California  recorded the
next highest rate, 11.7 percent. North Dakota reported the
lowest jobless rate, 3.2 percent, followed by Nebraska, 4.1
percent, and  New Hampshire  and South Dakota, 4.8 percent each.
In total, 25 states posted jobless rates significantly lower
than the U.S. figure of 9.1 percent, 5 states recorded
measurably higher rates, and 20 states and the District of
Columbia had rates that were not appreciably different from that
of the nation.  New Mexico experienced the largest over-the-month
unemployment rate decrease in May (-0.7 percentage point). Three
other states also posted statistically significant rate declines
from April--Oklahoma (-0.3 percentage point) and Florida and
Idaho (-0.2 point each). The remaining 46 states and the
District of Columbia registered jobless rates that were not
measurably different from those of a month earlier, though some
had changes that were at least as large numerically as the
significant changes.  Nevada recorded the largest jobless rate decrease from May
2010 (-2.8 percentage points). Two other states had rate
decreases of more than 2.0 percentage points--Michigan (-2.5
points) and  Indiana  (-2.2 points). Nineteen additional states
had smaller but also statistically significant decreases over
the year. The remaining 28 states and the District of Columbia
registered unemployment rates that were not appreciably
different from those of a year earlier.  Nonfarm Payroll Employment (Seasonally Adjusted)  Over the month, 15 states recorded statistically
significant changes in employment. The four states reporting
over-the-month statistically significant job gains were Florida
(+28,000),  Arizona  and Louisiana (+10,100 each), and Wyoming
(+2,200). The largest over-the-month statistically significant
declines in employment occurred in California (-29,200), New
York (-24,700), Pennsylvania (-14,200), Michigan (-13,400), and
Maryland (-13,300).  Over the year, 15 states experienced statistically
significant changes in employment, all of which were increases.
The largest increase occurred in Texas (+205,400), followed by
California (+87,300), Ohio (+65,900), Illinois (+61,600), and
