Czech stocks rose, erasing this
week’s declines, after German Chancellor  Angela Merkel  retreated
from demands that bondholders shoulder a “substantial” part of
the cost of a Greek rescue, boosting demand for Europe’s assets.  The PX gauge of companies rose 0.2 percent to 1,216.5 at
its 4:28 p.m. close of trading in Prague, after earlier sliding
as much as 0.4 percent. The index added less than 0.1 percent in
the week. Austria’s  Erste Group Bank AG (EBS)  advanced 1.3 percent,
the most in more than a month, to 827.6 koruna.  To contact the reporter on this story:
