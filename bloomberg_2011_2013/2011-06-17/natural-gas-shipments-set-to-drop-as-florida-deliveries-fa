Natural gas shipments to U.S. and
Canadian electricity generators were set to drop as milder
weather reduced demand for the power-plant fuel. Deliveries to
 Florida  declined for a second day.  A sample of scheduled gas deliveries to power plants fell
0.6 percent to 17.5 million dekatherms (17 billion cubic feet)
from yesterday’s 17.6 million, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg as of 2:36 p.m. in New York.  Scheduled shipments to Florida power plants decreased 2.1
percent to 3.32 million dekatherms from 3.4 million.  Wholesale gas for next-day delivery at Florida Gas
Transmission Zone 3 declined 3.8 percent to $4.57 per million
British thermal units on the Intercontinental Exchange.  Gas at the  Henry Hub  in Erath, Louisiana, lost 2.5 percent
to $4.44. The hub is the benchmark for gas futures traded on the
 New York Mercantile Exchange .  Temperatures in Florida will be in a normal range through
June 21, according to Commodity Weather Group LLC in Bethesda,
 Maryland . The high in Miami tomorrow may be 88 degrees
Fahrenheit (31 Celsius), 2 degrees below normal, according to
AccuWeather Inc. in  State College , Pennsylvania. The city had a
high of 96 degrees on June 15, 7 degrees above normal.  U.S. nuclear-power production nationwide increased by 667
megawatts from yesterday to 92,838 megawatts, or 91 percent of
capacity, according to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission and
data compiled by Bloomberg. That’s the most since March 3.  To contact the reporter on this story:
