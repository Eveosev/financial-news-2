Hewlett-Packard Co. (HPQ) , the world’s
largest maker of personal computers, said it will shift some
production of laptops to  Japan  from Shanghai this year to
shorten delivery times to customers in the country.  The company will assemble laptops geared for corporate
customers in a Tokyo factory that currently makes desktop PCs,
said spokesman Naoto Miyazawa, confirming an earlier report in
the Nikkei newspaper. HP, as the company is known, aims to
produce 1.4 million desktops and laptops a year at the plant, he
said.  “China has become less attractive as a global
manufacturing base,” saidYuichi Ishida, a Tokyo-based analyst
at Mizuho Investors Securities Co. “Personnel expenses in China
are rising by about 20 percent a year.”  Shifting production from  China  will allow Palo Alto,
California-based HP to shorten product delivery times in Japan
to five business days from 10 days, Miyazawa said. Japan
accounts about 2.5 percent of HP’s global PC sales by volume,
Miyazawa said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
