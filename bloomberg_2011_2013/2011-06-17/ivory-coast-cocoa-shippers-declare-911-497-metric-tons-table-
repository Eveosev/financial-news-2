Shipments of  cocoa beans  and the
bean equivalent of processed products registered at  Ivory
Coast’s  ports for export totaled 911,497 metric tons in the
season to June 9, according to an industry official with access
to the data.  In the 14 days to June 9, deliveries cocoa beans totaled
88,012 metric tons, said the official, who declined to be
identified because the data are confidential. The figures are
based on data provided by the ports of Abidjan and  San Pedro .
The official declined to be identified because the data are
confidential.  Processing companies declared 23,180 tons of beans used for
derived products during the period. The processed beans
generated 18,544 tons of product, primarily cocoa liquor, butter
and powder, which on average require one ton of raw beans to
produce 800 kilograms (1,764 pounds) of finished derivative.  Ivory Coast , the world’s largest cocoa producer, harvests
its main crop from Oct. 1 to March 31, while a smaller mid crop
is gathered from April to the end of September. The figures are
tabulated under exporting company, metric tons of beans shipped,
and total beans shipped since the season opened.  The following table shows the bean equivalent of products
declared in the period, tabulated under processing company,
metric tons of processed beans, and total beans exported since
the season opened.  To contact the reporters on this story:
