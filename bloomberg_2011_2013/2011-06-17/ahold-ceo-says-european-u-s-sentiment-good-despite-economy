Royal Ahold NV Chief Executive
Officer Dick Boer said consumer sentiment in  Europe  and the U.S.
is “good’’ with shoppers continuing to buy the company’s budget
and higher-priced private-label items.  “We all know in Europe and the U.S. we have an economy
quite under pressure and consumers are always reacting,’’ Boer
said in an interview on the sidelines of a consumer goods forum
in Barcelona. Still, “we are a retailer selling food so that’s
a good thing.’’  The retailer doesn’t expect changes in demand for its
private-label items, with shoppers purchasing a variety of
products, including its lowered-priced “guaranteed value”
range and top-tier products in the U.S., he said. The Amsterdam-
based grocer reported net income that beat estimates earlier
this month as a later Easter holiday boosted earnings in the
U.S., where the company owns the Stop & Shop and Giant Landover
chains.  The executive wouldn’t comment on potential acquisition
plans.  Ahold has promised to add “Healthy Living’’ labels on 25
percent of goods sold by 2015, as part of a drive to improve
consumer health and wellbeing, and will re-label all its
products with calorie counts on the front of the package, he
said.  To contact the reporter on this story: Sarah Shannon in London
