German lawmakers trying to shield
savings banks and cooperative lenders from a bank levy delayed a
vote on financing the country’s restructuring fund until next
month, reflecting conflict between state and federal officials.  Germany ’s upper house of parliament put off debate on
amendments to the fund’s contribution rules today until July 8,
the final session before the summer recess, Claas Ludwig, a
Finance Ministry spokesman in Berlin, said in an e-mail. The
changes would exempt the first 500 million euros ($707 million)
of balance-sheet liabilities from the tax and help banks avoid
the levy if they make a loss, according to a motion on the upper
house website.  Chancellor  Angela Merkel ’s government may have to make the
changes if the measures pass in the upper house, or Bundesrat,
which groups delegates from Germany’s 16 state governments.
Finance Minister  Wolfgang Schaeuble  has said German banks will
pay as much as 1.2 billion euros a year into the crisis fund.  Germany is phasing out a bank-rescue fund paid by taxpayers
that was set up in 2008 and replacing it with the bank-financed
rescue fund that was formed in January.  Deutsche Bank AG (DBK) ,
Germany’s biggest lender, will be affected the most by the fee,
Chief Executive Officer  Josef Ackermann  has said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
