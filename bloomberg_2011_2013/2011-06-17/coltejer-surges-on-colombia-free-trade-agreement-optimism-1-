Coltejer SA (COLTEJ) , a Colombian clothing
maker and exporter, jumped the most in almost three years on
optimism the  U.S. Congress  will pass a free-trade agreement with
the South American country.  Coltejer jumped 12 percent to 95 centavos at 4:34 p.m. New
York time, the biggest increase for the Medellin-based company
since July 2008.  White House Chief of Staff  William Daley  said a consensus
has emerged in Congress for renewing aid for workers who lose
jobs to global competition and passing free-trade agreements
before the August recess. The Obama administration a month ago
said it wouldn’t submit for review the free-trade accords with
South Korea, Colombia and Panama until lawmakers agreed to renew
trade aid for workers at its 2009 funding level.  “Coltejer is one of those speculative shares that moves
easily with news regarding the free-trade agreement,” said
Valeria Marconi, a stock analyst at brokerage Correval SA.  To contact the reporter on this story:
