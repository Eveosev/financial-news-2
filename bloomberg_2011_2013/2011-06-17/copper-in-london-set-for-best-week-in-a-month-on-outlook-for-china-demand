Copper climbed, set for its first
weekly advance in three, on optimism that China’s demand is
improving, tempering concern about  Europe ’s debt crisis. Zinc
and nickel also gained.  Three-month copper on the London Metal Exchange gained for
the first day in three, rising as much as 0.7 percent to $9,125
a metric ton. The metal last traded at $9,077.50 by 3:27 p.m.
Singapore time. It has risen 1.5 percent this week. Zinc, nickel
and tin also rose on better-than-estimated U.S. jobless claims
and housing starts.  “The market is pricing the expectation for a pickup in
demand in the months ahead,” Yu Haijian, an analyst at Bohai
Futures Co., said from Changchun in Jilin.  September-delivery copper in  New York  declined 0.4 percent
to $4.1205 a pound, while August-delivery metal on the Shanghai
Futures Exchange added as much as 0.6 percent to 68,540 yuan
($10,591) a ton.  Copper stockpiles in  China , the biggest consumer, dropped
by 36 percent last month and 21 percent in April. Inventories in
bonded warehouses, used to store shipments before duties are
paid, may have fallen 50 percent over the past two months,
Chinese traders and analysts estimated this week, prompting
speculation of a pickup in imports after two months of decline.  In the U.S., first-time filings for  unemployment benefits 
declined last week to 414,000, compared with 420,000 claims
estimated by economists surveyed by Bloomberg News. Construction
began on 560,000 houses at an annual pace, exceeding the 545,000
median forecast of economists.  Europe, China  “The global economic environment remains fraught with
uncertainty, which will keep a lid on prices,” said Yu.  European leaders meet to discuss the Greek debt crisis
today amid concern a default would risk spreading contagion to
other countries in the region, sending the euro lower against
the yen and dollar.  Alan Greenspan , former Federal Reserve
chairman, said a default by  Greece  is “almost certain” and
could help drive the  U.S. economy  into recession.  In China, the central bank announced a half percentage
point boost in the reserve requirement ratio for banks on June
14, adding to its 11 reserve-requirement and four interest-rate
increases since early 2010 to cool inflation, which climbed to
5.5 percent in May, the fastest pace in almost three years.  Zinc advanced 0.4 percent to $2,214 a ton, nickel climbed
0.3 percent to $21,670 a ton and tin gained 1.2 percent to
$25,200 a ton. Aluminum fell 0.4 percent to $2,545.75 a ton
while lead fell 0.2 percent to $2,476 a ton.  To contact the reporter for this story:
