Aston Villa appointed  Alex McLeish 
as manager five days after he resigned as coach of the Premier
League soccer team’s archrival Birmingham.  McLeish, 52, will assume his duties with immediate effect,
Villa said in a statement on its website. He becomes the seven-
time English champion’s third manager in nine months after
Martin O’Neill resigned five days before the start of last
season and Gerard Houllier stepped down on June 1 because of
heart problems.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
