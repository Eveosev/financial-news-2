PetroChina Co. received approval
from the National Development and Reform Commission for its oil
refinery venture in eastern Zhejiang province, the official
Xinhua News Agency reported, without giving more details.  PetroChina,  Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA)  and Qatar Petroleum plan
to invest about 80 billion yuan ($12.4 billion) to build a 20
million metric-ton-a-year, or 400,000 barrel-a-day, refinery in
Taizhou, the local municipal development and reform commission
said in a  statement  in 2009. The complex will also include a 1.2
million ton-a-year ethylene plant, according to the statement.  The unit of state-controlled China National Petroleum Corp.
will hold a 51 percent stake in the venture, while Shell and
Qatar Petroleum will each own 24.5 percent, the local planning
agency said at the time. Mao Zefeng, the Beijing-based spokesman
of PetroChina, didn’t return three phone calls today seeking
comment. Two calls to the Taizhou government weren’t answered.  After the signing of the letter of intent in Doha in 2008,
PetroChina, Qatar Petroleum and Shell have been conducting a
feasibility study on the development of an integrated refinery,
petrochemical and marketing project in  China , Li Lusha, Shell’s
spokeswoman in Beijing, said by e-mail today when asked to
comment on the Xinhua report. She declined to give more details.  --Winnie Zhu. With assistance from Regina Tan in Beijing.
