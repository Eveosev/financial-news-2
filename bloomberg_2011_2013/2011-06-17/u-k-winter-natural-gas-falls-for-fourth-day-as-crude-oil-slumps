U.K. winter natural gas fell for a
fourth day in its longest losing streak since February as  Brent
crude  slumped.  Gas for the six months from October dropped as much as 0.7
pence, or 1 percent, to 71 pence a therm, its lowest since June
2, according to broker prices compiled by Bloomberg. It was at
71.3 pence as of 9:30 a.m. in  London , equal to $11.48 a million
British thermal units.  Brent for August settlement dropped as much as $2.97, or
2.6 percent, to $111.05 a barrel on London’s ICE Futures Europe
exchange, its lowest since May 25. It was at $111.83 a barrel as
of 9:42 a.m. in London. Lower oil costs affect the price of some
mainland European gas contracts and weaken U.K. contracts
because of pipeline links to the continent.  U.K. winter baseload power slipped 40 pence to 58.60 pounds
a megawatt-hour, broker data show. Baseload is delivered around
the clock.  Centrica Plc, Britain’s biggest energy supplier, said it
took delivery of its first cargo of liquefied natural gas under
a three-year deal signed with Qatar Liquefied Gas Co. for annual
supply of 2.4 million metric tons of the chilled gas.  “The Mozah, a state of the art Q-Max LNG tanker, berthed
at 1.30 a.m. today and is capable of carrying enough gas to
supply 6 million homes for a week,” Centrica said in an e-
mailed statement.  Langeled Flows Rise  Norwegian pipeline imports through the Langeled link
increased, grid data show, indicating Royal Dutch Shell Plc’s
Ormen Lange field may have started after planned maintenance.
Shell wasn’t immediately able to comment.  National Grid Plc forecast gas demand in the 24 hours
through 6 a.m. tomorrow at 196 million cubic meters, 47 million
less than normal for the season, according to the pipeline
 manager’s website . The nation’s pipelines will hold 338 million
cubic meters of the fuel at that time, about the same as at the
start of today.  Within-day gas fell 0.6 pence to 58.6 pence a therm. That’s
0.05 pence a therm lower than the forward price for today at
4:30 p.m. yesterday. Power for the next working day rose 25
pence to 51.25 pounds a megawatt-hour.  To contact the reporter on this story:
