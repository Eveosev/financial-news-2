The  International Monetary Fund  cut
its 2011 and 2012 growth estimates for Brazil to 4.1 percent and
3.6 percent, respectively, as a global economic expansion slows,
the Washington-based lender said in a report today.  The IMF estimated in April that Brazil’s economy would grow
4.5 percent in 2011 and 4.1 percent in 2012.  Government spending cuts and decreased funding for Brazil’s
development bank, known as BNDES, will help the country meet its
budget surplus target this year of 3 percent of gross domestic
product, before interest payments, the  fund  estimated. The
country will still run an overall  budget deficit  equal to 2.8
percent of GDP this year and 2.9 percent in 2012, the IMF said.  In Mexico, fiscal restraint and stronger revenues will help
reduce government debt levels as a proportion of the economy,
the fund said. Mexico’s budget deficit will fall to 2.7 percent
of GDP in 2011 from 4.1 percent last year, the IMF said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
