Brazilian Finance Minister Guido Mantega today rejected  Petroleo Brasileiro SA (PETR4) ’s plan to invest
more than $224 billion from 2011 to 2015, O Globo reported,
citing people close to the discussions who weren’t identified.  Mantega, during the state-controlled oil company board
meeting, asked Petrobras to trim its investment plan, the Rio de
Janeiro-based newspaper said, without detailing how it obtained
the information.  The  Finance Ministry  declined comment, according to an e-
mailed statement from its press office. An official at
Petrobras’ press department, who declined to be named due to
company policy, declined to comment on the status of the
business plan.  To contact the reporters on this story:
