The following companies had unusual
price changes in Chilean trading. Stock symbols are in
parentheses and prices are as of 4:10 p.m.  New York  time.  The Ipsa index rose 2.1 percent to 4,623.48, ending a six-
day losing streak in which it lost 6 percent.  Cencosud SA (CENCOSUD CC),  Latin America ’s third-largest
retailer by sales, rose 3.8 percent to 3,259 pesos, the most in
three months. Cencosud advanced on speculation that a fall
earlier this week was excessive, Marcelo Barrero, an analyst at
brokerage Euroamerica Corredores de Bolsa SA, said in an
interview.  Other retailers also rose.  SACI Falabella (FALAB)  , the
country’s largest retailer by market value, gained 0.2 percent
to 4,516.2 pesos and was the most active stock today by value
with 16.9 billion pesos ($36 million) changing hands.  Empresas Iansa SA (IANSA)  ,  Chile ’s largest sugar
producer, gained 8.6 percent to 43.67 pesos, leading gains among
members of the IPSA index. Recent falls in the Chilean market
have been excessive and “it’s time for investors to go
windowshopping,” Banco de Credito e Inversiones wrote in an e-
mailed note to clients.  Lan Airlines SA (LAN)  , Latin America’s largest airline
by market value, rose 3.3 percent to 12,787 pesos, the biggest
gain in four months.  Oil prices  fell as much as 3.3 percent in
New York today on higher inventories in the U.S., which signals
lower costs for transport companies.  Cia. Sudamericana de Vapores SA (VAPORES CC), Latin
America’s largest container shipping company, also gained,
rising 6.6 percent to 288.24 pesos.  To contact the reporter on this story:
