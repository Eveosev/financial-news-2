South Africa , the biggest corn
producer on the continent, will probably leave its forecast for
this season’s harvest of the grain unchanged, a survey showed.  The government may say farmers will reap 10.99 million
metric tons of corn, the same as projected last month, according
to the median estimate of 13 traders surveyed by Bloomberg.
Forecasts ranged from 10.74 million tons to 11 million tons.  The government’s  Crop Estimates Committee  is scheduled to
release its fifth assessment of the harvest on June 23 at 3:30
p.m. local time in Johannesburg.  White corn for July delivery, the most active contract on
the South African Futures Exchange, fell 3 percent to 1,724 rand
($252) a ton as of the midday close in Johannesburg today. Meal
made from the grain is the country’s staple food.  Yellow corn for July delivery dropped 3.3 percent, to 1,735
rand a ton. The grain is used mainly as  animal feed  in South
Africa.  To contact the reporter on this story:
