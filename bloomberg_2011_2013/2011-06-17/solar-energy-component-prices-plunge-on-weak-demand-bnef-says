Solar-energy component prices dove
in June, driven by European subsidy cuts that weakened demand
and led to the build-up of inventories at factories, Bloomberg
New Energy Finance said.  Solar-grade silicon fell 28 percent in the month to $53.4 a
kilogram, relieving some pressure on downstream manufacturers of
wafers and solar cells, the London-based analyst said today in a
statement. Prices for multicrystalline silicon cells dropped 15
percent to $0.92 per watt and modules declined 6.5 percent to an
average of $1.68 per watt, New Energy Finance said.  “The markets are oversupplied with modules, as
manufacturers seek to reduce their inventories in markets that
are demanding cheap modules because of reductions in
subsidies,” said Martin Simonek, a New Energy Finance solar
analyst. “Producers are preparing for a painful consolidation
that could see several players exit the solar industry.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
