Inflation in Burundi slowed to 6.3
percent in May as the price of rice declined following a harvest
of the grain, said Antoine Gahiru, an information officer at the
Burundian Institute of Statistics and Economic Studies.  The inflation rate declined from 8.4 percent in April,
Gahiru said in a phone interview today from Bujumbura, the
capital. Prices increased 1.8 percent in the month, he said.  The cost of rice fell to as low as 1,200 Burundian francs
(97 cents) a kilogram (2.2 pounds) in May from 1,500 francs a
month earlier, Gahiru said.  The East African nation, about the size of the U.S. state
of  Maryland , relies on tea and coffee exports to generate most
of its foreign-exchange earnings.  To contact the reporter on this story:
