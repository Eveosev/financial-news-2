Serbia  and other nations in the
Western Balkans should increase excise duties on cigarettes and
other tobacco goods to bring them closer to European Union
levels, said Cristian Cring, Adriatic representative for  Japan
Tobacco Inc. (2914)   Excise duties in Serbia now are 28 euros ($39 dollar) per
1,000 cigarettes, compared with EU taxes of 90 euros.  “That is the target which will be imposed for the
countries of the region. That is a huge difference, even if
Serbia becomes an EU member in 2020,” Cring said today at a
conference in Becici, Montenegro. “We are not here to ask for
an increase in taxes, but for an increase in predictable and
stable way.”  The duty of 114 euros in Italy compares with 22.3 euros per
1,000 cigarettes in Albania, Cring said, adding that differences
between EU and the Western Balkans meant that “a pack of
Winston costs 1.25 euros in Serbia and 5.25 euros in  Italy .”  An excise duty calendar would determine the pace of an
increase in excise duties over a three- to five-year period,
while securing stable budget revenue and a predictable business
environment for the tobacco industry.  Excise duties on tobacco in Serbia generated 9.1 percent of
its budget in 2010, 5.3 percent of the Romanian budget and 6.3
percent of the Bulgarian budget, Cring said.  Japan Tobacco, the world’s third-largest publicly traded
cigarette maker, is the manufacturer of brands such as Camel and
Winston.  To contact the reporter on this story:
