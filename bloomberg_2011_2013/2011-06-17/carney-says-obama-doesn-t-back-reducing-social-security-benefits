President  Barack Obama  wouldn’t
support changes to Social Security that would reduce payments to
current beneficiaries or lead to sharp cuts in future benefits,
his spokesman said.  “No current beneficiaries should see their basic benefits
reduced,” White House press secretary  Jay Carney  said today.
“We will not accept any kind of reform that slashes benefits
for future beneficiaries.”  Carney said that Social Security is not “a driver” of the
nation’s  budget deficit . Obama has said changes to the program
should be considered separately from current negotiations
between the administration and Congress to reduce the deficit.  Obama has argued that health-insurance programs such as
Medicare and Medicaid are the root cause of the deficit, while
the solvency of Social Security is more of a long-term challenge
for the country.  Vice President  Joe Biden  is leading talks with lawmakers to
reduce the budget deficit by $4 trillion as part of an agreement
to raise the government’s borrowing limit.  Congress is working to meet an Aug. 2 deadline for raising
the nation’s $14.3 trillion debt limit.  To contact the reporter on this story:
