Volkswagen AG (VOW)  and  Porsche Automobil
Holding SE (PAH3)  are poised for further ‘distinct growth’ even as
conditions in the world economy remain ‘challenging,’ Chief
Executive Officer Martin Winterkorn said, citing rising raw
material prices and countries’ debts.  Volkswagen may face another ‘very successful’ business year
in 2011, the CEO said in remarks prepared for delivery today at
Porsche’s annual shareholder conference in Stuttgart.  To contact the reporter on this story:
