Guinness Ghana Breweries Ltd. (GGBL) , the
local unit of Diageo Plc, jumped the most in more than a year as
one million shares traded after the company approved a rights
offer this week to pay debt and invest in infrastructure.  The stock jumped 9.9 percent to 1.44 cedis at the 3 p.m.
close in Accra, the capital, the biggest gain since May 2010.
More than one million shares changed hands, compared with a
daily average of about 12,000 shares in the past six months
before today, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The
shares gained 11 percent this week, the most since June 2008.  Guinness is seeking to raise 70 million cedis ($46.2
million) in a rights offer that opens in September and closes in
October, company chairman, David Harlock, said June 14.  “I believe it is in line with the upcoming rights issue in
September,” Hilary Lomotey, a stock trader at  Renaissance
Capital  said in an e-mailed note today from Accra. “It was a
cross trade between two foreign funds.”  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
