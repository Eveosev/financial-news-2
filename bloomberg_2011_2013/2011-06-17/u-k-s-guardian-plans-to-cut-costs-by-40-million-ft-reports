Guardian News & Media Ltd., which
publishes the Guardian daily newspaper and the Observer each
week on Sunday, aims to cut its costs by 25 million pounds ($40
million) in the next five years to staunch losses, the Financial
Times reported, citing  Andrew Miller , the chief executive
officer of Guardian Media Group Plc, the parent company.  Miller told staff that the “transformational program”
will involve job losses and may mean reducing the number of
pages in the Guardian’s weekday edition, the FT said.  Guardian News and Media, which is likely to report a 35
million-pound loss in the fiscal year to March, said it wants a
shift in emphasis from print to online journalism, the FT said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
