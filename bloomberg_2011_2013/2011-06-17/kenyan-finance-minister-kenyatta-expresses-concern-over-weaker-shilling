Kenya ’s government has no plans to
stem the shilling’s weakness against the dollar even as it is
concerned about the drop, Finance Minister  Uhuru Kenyatta  said.  “We don’t want to say that we are going to interfere with
market forces” even though there is “some concern” over the
shilling’s depreciation, Kenyatta told reporters today in
Nairobi, the capital.  The shilling’s 10 percent depreciation since the start of
the year against the dollar has fueled rising inflation and
undermined economic growth. Annual price growth in East Africa’s
biggest economy accelerated to a 25-month high of 12.95 percent
in May as food and fuel costs rose. The government expects
economic growth to slow to 5.3 percent this year, from 5.6
percent in 2010.  The shilling gained 0.3 percent to 89.75 per dollar by
10:47 a.m. in Nairobi, after reaching 90.95 yesterday, the
weakest intraday level in 17 years.  Higher global crude prices have increased demand for
dollars by fuel importers, in a country where oil purchases
account for a fifth of the average monthly import bill,
according to  Central Bank of Kenya  data published in March.  The weakening currency is a “situation that has to be
monitored very keenly, especially in the scenario of rising
prices of fuel and other imported commodities that are
essential,” Kenyatta said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
