Abraaj Capital Ltd. hired  Goldman
Sachs Group Inc. (GS)  and Bank of America Merrill Lynch to find a
buyer for its Turkish hospital unit Acibadem Saglik Hizmetleri &
Ticaret AS, according to two people with knowledge of the sale.  Abraaj , based in Dubai, plans either to sell its entire
stake to a single buyer, or offer the shares on the market, said
the people, who declined to be identified because the talks are
private.  Acibadem’s  market value is 2.25 billion liras ($1.4
billion), based on today’s closing share price. Abraaj has a 46
percent stake in Almond Holding, which owns 92 percent of
Acibadem, according to data on the website of the  Istanbul Stock
Exchange . The stock rose 9.3 percent to 22.45 liras at 5:30 p.m.
in Istanbul, extending earlier gains.  Abraaj’s  Turkey  manager, Selcuk Yorgancioglu, didn’t answer
phone calls seeking comment on the sale.  Abraaj Capital, the biggest private equity firm in the
 Middle East  and North Africa, bought the Acibadem stake for
about $606 million in 2007 and 2008. Funds under management were
$6.6 billion at the end of 2009, according to its website.  Turkey’s growing health-care industry has attracted
investors including  Carlyle Group , the world’s second-largest
private-equity firm. Carlyle bought 40 percent of hospital
operator Medical Park Saglik Grubu AS for an undisclosed price
in 2009.  Acibadem, based in Istanbul, operates 11 general hospitals,
8 medical centers and a laboratory and genetic diagnostic center
in Turkey, according to its website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
