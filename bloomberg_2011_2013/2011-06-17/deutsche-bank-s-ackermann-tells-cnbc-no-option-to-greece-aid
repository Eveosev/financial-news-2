Deutsche Bank AG (DBK)  Chief Executive
Officer Josef Ackermann said private investors’ role in
restructuring Greek debt must be “absolutely voluntary” to
avoid a  credit event , adding that a delay in aid for the country
could be “a disaster.”  “We have to avoid under any circumstances of a credit
event or rating event, and should of course also see that there
is no real markdowns of positions, not only in the banking
system, but also talking about the European Central Bank,
insurance companies, pension funds and individual portfolios,”
Ackermann said in an interview with CNBC today. “We are
certainly open to a dialogue.”  Investors “have to know” within coming days if the
European Union and  International Monetary Fund  will inject more
money into Greece, he said in the CNBC interview.  “If we delay until September, who knows what’s going
happen over summer break in terms of discussions about other
countries as well,” he told CNBC.  To contact the reporter on this story:
