China Petroleum & Chemical Corp. (600028)  is
planning a 100 billion yuan ($15.5 billion) refining complex in
the coastal province of Jiangsu, National Business Daily
reported, citing an unidentified local government official.  The project at Lianyungang includes two refineries with
total processing capacity of 32 million metric tons a year and
a liquefied natural gas terminal with capacity of 5 million tons
a year, according to the report.  Huang Wensheng , the Beijing-
based spokesman for Sinopec, as China Petroleum is known, didn’t
return three phone calls to his office seeking comment.  The local government, which will take a stake in the
project, hasn’t reached an accord with Sinopec on how costs may
be split, the Shanghai-based daily said. The Hong Kong-listed
refiner may bring in a foreign company to invest in the project,
the newspaper said, citing President Wang Tianpu.  The refining complex will be developed in two phases, with
a 12 million ton-a-year plant to be built first, according to
the newspaper. The National Development and Reform Commission,
 China ’s top economic planner, is expected to approve the first
phase in 2013 and the refinery may begin operations in 2016, the
daily said. The Jiangsu government’s media relations department
declined to comment on the report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
