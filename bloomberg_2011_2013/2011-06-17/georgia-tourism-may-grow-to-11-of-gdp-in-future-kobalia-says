Georgia ’s tourism industry may grow
to as much as 11 percent of economic production over the next
few years, from 5 percent in 2011, said Economy and Sustainable
Development Minister Vera Kobalia.  “Tourism is growing fast, but we must not be dependent
just on it,” Kobalia said in an interview today after appearing
at a transportation conference in Tbilisi, the capital.
“Agriculture and transit routes are also important.”  Georgia will attract as many as 3 million visitors this
year, up from 2 million in 2010, Kobalia said in April. That
would be the highest figure since 2003, when President Mikheil
Saakashvili came to power in the so-called Rose Revolution.  The economy expanded 6.4 percent last year to $11.7
billion, according to the statistics office.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
