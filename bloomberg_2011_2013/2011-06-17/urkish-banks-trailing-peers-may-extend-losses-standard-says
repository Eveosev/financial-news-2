Turkish banking stocks that have
underperformed emerging market peers by almost a quarter over
the past year are still “not cheap” and may extend losses,
according to Standard Bank Group Ltd.’s unit in  Turkey .  “Turkish banks are still trading at only seven percent
discount to peers” while Turkey weathers a rapidly
deteriorating risk outlook and an “unsustainably high external
deficit,” Standard Unlu head of research Ercan Uysal said in an
e-mailed report today. “Unless bond yields come down on a
sustainable basis, bank valuations should drift lower.”  Turkey’s banking index has declined 5.6 percent over the
past year compared to a 16 percent rise for the benchmark MSCI
Emerging Markets Banks Index, as the central bank increased 
banks' reserve requirements to contain a credit boom. The main 
 ISE National 100 Index (XU100)  in Istanbul has increased 7.4 percent 
over the same period.  The ISE fell 0.2 percent to 60,987.28 at 10:42 a.m., heading
for the first weekly loss in three. The Turkish banking index fell
0.1 percent, taking the week's decline to 5 percent.    Among Turkish banks, only Yapi & Kredi Bankasi AS is
probably undervalued following a sharp sell-off in recent weeks,
Uysal said. Investors should buy shares in  Turkiye Garanti
Bankasi AS (GARAN)  should they drop to 6 liras per share, he said.  Yapi Kredi fell 0.8 percent to 3.92 liras. Garanti rose 0.3
percent to 6.98 liras.  To contact the reporter on this story:
