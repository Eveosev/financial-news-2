The lira strengthened, snapping a
five-day drop, after French PresidentNicolas Sarkozy said he
and German  Chancellor Angela Merkel  reached a “breakthrough”
on a plan to address  Greece ’s debt crisis.  The lira gained 0.8 percent to 1.5969 per dollar at 5:51
p.m. in Istanbul, trimming the week’s depreciation to 1.3
percent. Yields on benchmark two-year bonds decreased five basis
points to 9.04 percent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
The yields fell for the first in four days, the TEB Local
Benchmark Bond Index showed.  “The mood has improved here after the Greek news,” Eren Yardimci, a currency trader at Akbank TAS in Istanbul, said by
telephone. “This spurred dollar sales and investors closed
short lira positions.”  The lira had the longest losing streak since January before
today, with the crisis in Greece adding to concern  Turkey  would
struggle to rein in its current-account deficit.  Sarkozy’s comments signaled a reconciliation between
Germany’s insistence that investors help bail out Greece with
European Central Bank warnings backed by  France  that any
compulsory move risked triggering a default. A Vienna-style
voluntary debt rollover is a “good basis” for a solution,
Merkel said. She declined to give a date, saying that the matter
must be resolved “as quickly as possible.”  The  ISE National 100 index (XU100)  of stocks gained for a second
day, closing 1 percent higher at 61,716.68, paring its decline
this week to 3.1 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
