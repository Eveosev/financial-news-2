German power for next-year delivery
fell to its lowest price in nine days after crude oil declined,
signaling lower costs for fuels at power stations.  Baseload power for 2012 slid 35 cents to 59.30 euros ($96)
a megawatt-hour at 5:47 p.m. Berlin time, according to broker
data compiled by Bloomberg. That’s the lowest since June 8.
Baseload is delivered around the clock.  The benchmark contract climbed to a two-year high of 60.90
euros on May 31 after  Europe ’s biggest economy hastened its exit
from nuclear energy. Germany is the largest nation to abandon
atomic power after the March disaster at Japan’s Fukushima plant
stoked concerns about nuclear safety.  Brent crude  fell as much as 2.6 percent to $111.05 a
barrel.  Oil prices  affect the cost of coal and natural gas,
fuels used at power stations in Europe.  Germany’s 17 reactors generated 23 percent of the country’s
electricity last year.  Chancellor Angela Merkel  ordered the halt
of the country’s seven oldest reactors after the Japan crisis.  Bloomberg tracks power prices from brokers including GFI
Group Inc., ICAP Plc, Spectron Group Ltd., Tradition Financial
Services and Tullet Prebon Plc.  To contact the reporter on this story:
