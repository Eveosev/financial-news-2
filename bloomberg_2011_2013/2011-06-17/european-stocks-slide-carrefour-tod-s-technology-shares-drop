European stocks declined, with the
Stoxx Europe 600 Index heading for its longest weekly losing
streak in more than three years, as concern escalated that
Greece will default on its sovereign debt. Asian stocks slipped
and U.S. futures were little changed.  Technology shares fell after  Research In Motion Ltd. (RIM) , the
maker of the BlackBerry smartphone, cut its profit forecast.
Carrefour SA slumped 4.7 percent after saying results in France
failed to meet the company’s own expectations.  Tod’s SpA (TOD) 
declined 1.9 percent after Morgan Stanley downgraded the shares
of the luxury-goods company.  The Stoxx 600 lost 0.6 percent to 265.04 at 8:04 a.m. in
London. The benchmark has dropped 9 percent since this year’s
high on Feb. 17 as a slowdown in U.S. job creation suggested the
economic recovery is faltering and speculation grew that Greece
will default on its debt. The index is heading for its seventh
week of losses, the longest losing streak since January 2008.
Volatility may be unusually high today as index options expire
throughout  Europe .  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
