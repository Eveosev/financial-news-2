Oil options volatility increased as
July futures dropped to the lowest level in almost four months
on doubts that the Greek debt crisis will be resolved.  Implied volatility for at-the-money options expiring in
August, a measure of expected price swings in futures and a
gauge of options prices, was 33.16 percent as of 3 p.m. in New
York, the highest since May 23, up from 32.29 percent yesterday.  Crude for July delivery tumbled $1.94, or 2 percent, to
$93.01 a barrel on the  New York Mercantile Exchange , the lowest
settlement since Feb. 18. Todayâ€™s move capped the biggest weekly
drop in six weeks. August futures fell $1.96 to $93.40.  The most active contracts in electronic trading today were
August $110 calls, with 2,489 lots changing hands. They fell 6
cents to 17 cents a barrel. August $90 puts, the next-most
active option, gained 51 cents to $2.11 a barrel with 2,193 lots
trading. One contract covers 1,000 barrels of crude.  The Nymex distributes real-time data for electronic trading
and releases information on floor trading, where the bulk of
options trading occurs, the next business day.  August $90 puts were the most active options traded in the
previous session, with 7,675 lots changing hands. They fell 13
cents to 1.60 a barrel. The next-most active options, August $95
puts, dropped 15 cents to $3.30 a barrel on volume of 6,443
lots.  Open interest was highest for December 2012 $80 puts with
44,877 contracts. Next were December 2011 $120 calls with 40,612
and December 2011 $80 puts with 38,458.  -- With assistance from Mark Shenk in  New York . Editors:
