Saab AB (SAABB) , the maker of the Gripen
fighter jet, has discovered previously unknown payments of 24
million rand ($3.5 million) in 2003 from its subsidiary Sanip
Pty Ltd to a South African consultant, Svenska Dagbladet
reported today, citing Saab Chief Executive Officer Haakan
Buskhe.  The funds had been transferred to Sanip from Saabâ€™s then
partner,  BAE Systems Plc (BA/) , Buskhe was quoted as saying.  South Africa signed a contract for 26 Gripen fighters in
1999 as part of its Strategic Defence Procurement, Svenska
Dagbladet said.  BAE spokeswoman Leonie Foster said the matters were fully
reviewed by the Serious Fraud Office and formed part of the 
overall resolution reached in February 2010.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
