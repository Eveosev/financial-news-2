Almost two-thirds of French people
want higher tariffs on non-European imports, with even more
saying free trade has been bad for  France , an Ifop poll said.  The poll said 84 percent of the French think international
trade has killed jobs in France and 78 percent say it has
reduced domestic salaries. The survey also showed that 57
percent believe imports have led to higher prices for consumer
goods while 65 percent want higher  import duties .  The poll, which involved 1,012 people interviewed by
telephone from May 17-19, was commissioned by a group of
economists pushing for the European Union to reduce imports from
developing countries. No margin of error was given.  To contact the reporter on this story:
