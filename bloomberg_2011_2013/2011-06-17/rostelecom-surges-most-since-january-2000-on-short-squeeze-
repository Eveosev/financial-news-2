OAO Rostelecom,  Russia ’s dominant
fixed-line telephone operator, climbed the most since January
2000 after the stock’s inclusion in a benchmark index prompted
investors to cover bearish bets in a so-called short squeeze.  The stock jumped 27 percent to 220.82 rubles at the 6:45
p.m. close in Moscow, the biggest gain since Jan. 5, 2000. The
shares advanced 4.5 percent yesterday after inclusion in the RTS
Index came into effect.  “There is shorting in the stock and there is very little
available to borrow,”  Luis Saenz , the London-based director of
international sales at brokerage Otkritie Securities Ltd., wrote
in response to e-mailed questions. “It’s a short squeeze.”  Short sellers borrow stocks and sell them in the hope of
profiting by repurchasing the securities later at a lower price
and returning them to the holder. Short covering occurs when an
investor buys a security to close a short position or to return
a borrowed security.  In a short squeeze, the lack of supply forces prices upward
and traders with short positions are forced to buy the
securities to cover their positions and limit their losses. The
surge of buying results in even higher prices.  To contact the reporter on this story:
