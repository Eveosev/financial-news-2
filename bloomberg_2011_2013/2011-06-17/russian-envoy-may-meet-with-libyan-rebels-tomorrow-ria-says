Russia ’s envoy to Africa, Mikhail Margelov, said he may hold talks with Libyan rebel leader
Mustafa Abdel Jalil tomorrow in Tunis, Russia’s state-owned RIA
Novosti news service reported.  Margelov’s comments came after he met with Tunisian Prime
Minister Beji Caid Essebsi today in the Tunisian capital.  Margelov said yesterday that officials of Libyan leader
 Muammar Qaddafi ’s government assured him they were in direct
contact with the rebels and that talks between representatives
of the two groups took place June 15 in Paris, according to RIA.  Abdel Hafiz Ghoga, vice president of the rebel Transitional
