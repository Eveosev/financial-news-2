(Corrects order of name in ninth paragraph.)  Gold is poised for a second weekly
decline as growing evidence of an economic slowdown and the
dollar’s strength curb demand for commodities.  Immediate-delivery gold dropped as much as 0.3 percent to
$1,525.73 an ounce before trading at $1,526 at 2:35 p.m. in
 Singapore . The metal lost 0.3 percent this week after a 0.7
percent drop the previous week. The August-delivery contract
decreased 0.2 percent to $1,527.60. Cash silver lost 2.4 percent
this week and was set for a third weekly decline.  The Standard & Poor’s GSCI Index of 24 commodities weakened
4.1 percent this week, heading for its first decline since the
week ended May 6, after manufacturing in the Philadelphia region
unexpectedly contracted in June. Americans’ views on the
economy’s outlook also soured. The Dollar Index, a six-currency
gauge of the dollar’s value, rose 1.1 percent this week,
following a jump of 1.4 percent the previous week.  “With a decline in commodities and the dollar creeping
higher, gold lacked momentum this week to break its lull,” said
Hwang Il Doo, a Seoul-based senior trader at KEB Futures Co.
Still, the dip may be a good buying opportunity as the Greek
debt crisis “shows no signs of ending.”  The Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia’s general economic
index fell to minus 7.7, the lowest since July 2009, from 3.9
the prior month, data showed yesterday. Readings less than zero
signal contraction. The Bloomberg gauge of economic expectations
slumped to minus 31 this month, the weakest since March 2009.  Merkel, Sarkozy  German Chancellor  Angela Merkel  and French President
 Nicolas Sarkozy  will meet today in Berlin, with pressure rising
for the leaders to reach an accord on a rescue for  Greece . EU
finance ministers agreed on June 14 to reconvene on June 19
after they failed to reconcile a German-led push for bondholders
to shoulder part of the cost of a new plan for Greek aid.  Fifteen of 23 traders, investors and analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg said gold will rise next week. Five saw lower prices
and three were neutral. Assets held in exchange-traded products
stood little changed at 2,053.204 tons yesterday, according to
Bloomberg data. Holdings hit a record 2,114.6 tons in December.  Gold is up 7.5 percent this year, reaching an all-time high
of $1,577.57 an ounce on May 2, as investors seek precious
metals as a protection of wealth against rising inflation and
currency debasement.  Slowing economic growth generates “political panic,”
which in turn leads to stimulus incentives, Monty Guild, chief
executive officer at Guild Investment Management Inc, wrote in a
note. “Look for another major rally in gold, oil, commodities
and stocks,” Guild said.  Cash silver declined 0.7 percent to $35.32 an ounce after
ending last week at $36.1825. Spot palladium gained 0.4 percent
to $760.50 an ounce, trimming its weekly loss to 6.4 percent.
Platinum rose 0.4 percent to $1,765.75 an ounce, reducing this
week’s loss to 3.7 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
