European coal fell for a third day
in  London , on course for the first weekly decline in three
weeks.  Coal for delivery to Amsterdam, Rotterdam or Antwerp with
settlement next year slid 85 cents, or 0.7 percent, to $128.35 a
metric ton by 10:13 a.m. London time. A close at that price
would be a 1.6 percent drop for the week.  Profit from running coal-fired power plants for the next
month, the so-called clean-dark spread, is about 5.99 euros
($8.51) a megawatt-hour, compared with 2.60 euros from burning
natural gas, Bloomberg data showed. The calculation uses
electricity prices in  Germany ,  Europe ’s biggest energy consumer,
and takes emission costs into account.  December carbon-dioxide permits under the European Union
cap-and-trade system were 1.1 percent lower at 15.93 euros a
ton. Gas for delivery in the six months through September 2012
to the U.K., Europe’s biggest consumer of the fuel, declined 2
percent to 66.1 pence ($1.07) a therm in London.  The coal-derivative data are drawn from information
