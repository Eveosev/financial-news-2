Main Street is out of step with Wall
Street.  The Bloomberg Consumer Comfort Index has stalled near its
recession average as the  Dow Jones Industrial Average  has risen
83 percent from a 12-year low in March 2009. A tight correlation
between the index and Dow that lasted more than two decades has
broken down as joblessness above 9 percent, stagnant wages and
near $4-a-gallon gasoline outweigh the benefits of higher share
prices, even after a 6.6 percent retreat in the Dow since the
end of April.  “Consumers are fairly depressed, yet the stock market
continues to improve,” Guy LeBas, chief fixed-income strategist
at Janney Montgomery Scott LLC in Philadelphia, said in an
interview. “It’s foreign demand that is really pushing
corporate profitability.  Consumer confidence  is pretty
constrained by the labor market.”  U.S. manufacturers in particular have profited from faster
growth in emerging economies, including Colombia and  Indonesia ,
where expanding middle classes are demanding more roads and
utilities, as well as higher-protein foods and more  consumer
goods .  Deere & Co. (DE) , the world’s largest farm-equipment maker,
raised its fiscal 2011 earnings forecast on May 18 to $2.65
billion from $2.5 billion, citing increased demand for farm and
construction machinery outside the U.S, along with growth in
America.  Shares of the Moline, Illinois-based company have jumped
219 percent to $79.27 yesterday from $24.83 on March 2, 2009,
even after sliding 20 percent from a high of $99.24 on April 4.
Half its business will come from overseas by 2018 compared with
about 40 percent now, driven by “big opportunities in markets
like  Russia  and  South America ,” Marie Ziegler, the company’s
treasurer, said on a June 7 conference call.  ‘Margins Intact’  U.S. corporations have gotten “a pickup in sales growth,
but they’re not responding with a big pickup in wages and labor
growth,” said  Rob Carnell , chief international economist at ING
Bank in  London . “This is helping them to keep their margins
intact in the backdrop of rising commodity prices.”  Wages and salaries made up 48.9 percent of gross value-
added for domestic businesses in March, according to Commerce
Department data. That’s up slightly from 48.7 in December, the
lowest since records began in 1929. Meanwhile, corporate profits
posted a sixth quarterly gain in January-March this year from a
year earlier.  The 18-month recession shaved 4.1 percentage points off
gross domestic product before ending in June 2009, making it the
deepest downturn since the 1930s. Growth has averaged about 2.8
percent since then, enough to restore only 1.8 million of the
8.8 million jobs lost as a result of the slump.  Rising Unemployment  The economy generated 54,000 positions in May, the fewest
in eight months and down from 232,000 in April, while the
 unemployment rate  rose to 9.1 percent, the Labor Department
reported June 3.  “Now that there is a delay in the job-market recovery,
there is a delay in the confidence recovery,” said Jim Paulsen,
chief investment strategist at Minneapolis-based Wells Capital
Management.  Since the stock rally began in March 2009, the correlation
between the Dow and Bloomberg’s comfort index, a measure of
consumer sentiment, has fallen to 0.36 compared with 0.82 since
1985, according to Langer Research Associates LLC in  New York ,
which compiles the index for Bloomberg. A correlation of 1
indicates two variables are in lockstep; negative 1 means they
move in opposite directions.  The index rose to minus 44 in the week ended June 12 from
minus 45.9 and has averaged minus 46 since June 2009. That’s
below a minus 43 average during the slump and a clear sign some
consumers aren’t feeling the benefits of the recovery as much as
companies and Americans who own their shares.  Falling Expectations  The Bloomberg Comfort Gauge of economic expectations
dropped to minus 31 this month, the lowest level since March
2009, from minus 16 in May, the latest report showed yesterday.  Confidence among households making between $40,000 and
$49,999 a year has averaged minus 46 since the recession ended,
compared with minus 7.3 for people making more than $100,000 a
year, who are most likely to be more-active stock owners. A
reading of less than zero is negative.  “Higher-income people have greater exposure to the
markets” while lower-income Americans are more focused on the
“kitchen-table” issues of high unemployment and stagnant
wages, said  Gary Langer , president of Langer Research.  Eighty-seven percent of Americans who make $75,000 or more
a year own stocks, according to a  Gallup poll  conducted April
7-11. That compares with 54 percent of all Americans, the lowest
share since Gallup began monitoring the data annually in 1999.  ‘Hesitant’ Investors  “Even as stocks have surged over the past couple of years,
it has been hard for most Americans to understand what is
happening on  Wall Street  and why, leaving them hesitant to
invest,” Dennis Jacobe, Gallup’s chief economist, said in an
April 20 statement.  Weekly earnings adjusted for inflation fell about 10
percent between 1979 and 2009 for the 74 percent of consumers
without a college degree, compared with a 20 percent increase
for people with a bachelor’s degree or higher, according to
Langer’s research based on Labor Department data.  “There is a strong sense that the opportunity for
prosperity is much diminished from previous generations,”
Langer said. “If we wonder why so many people feel they’re
doing less well financially, it’s because it’s true.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
