(Corrects word in third paragraph from aims to working to.)  PepsiCo Inc., the world’s largest
snack-food maker, aims to raise prices of its soft drinks in the
U.S. as the economy improves, Chief Executive Officer  Indra Nooyi  said.  “The economy is better now than it was last year,” Nooyi
said in an interview on the sidelines of a consumer goods forum
in Barcelona today. “Ultimately the test is going to be when
unemployment rates come down. Everybody is focused on it.”  PepsiCo is working to increase prices “right now as we
speak,” the executive said. The company in April vowed to
increase beverage prices from July 4 to offset higher commodity
costs, with rival Coca-Cola Co. also saying prices would
increase 3 percent to 4 percent in the second half.  Nooyi told the conference that she “hates the fact that
fingers are pointed at us” on increasing global obesity. A
multi-facted approach with government and retailers including
education and greater innovation in products and packaging is
needed to lessen the burden, she said.  Increasing taxation on unhealthy products isn’t enough, the
CEO also said. “It’s discriminating, it’s not going to get the
desired effect,” Nooyi said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
