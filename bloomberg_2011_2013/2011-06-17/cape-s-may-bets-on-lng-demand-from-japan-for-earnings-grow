Cape Plc (CIU) , which supplies fire-
protection, scaffolding and cleaners to energy companies, is
expecting higher liquefied natural gas demand from Japan to prop
up earnings through 2015.  Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA) ,  Chevron Corp. (CVX)  and  Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) 
with partners are investing in LNG projects in  Australia  and
Papua New Guinea to supply the fuel to  Asia . Japan will be
importing more gas after the March 11 earthquake shut nuclear
power stations, industry analysts said.  “We can see the market coming towards us,” Cape Chief
Executive Officer Martin May said today in a phone interview.
“People are now talking about gas as an alternative source of
energy” after the nuclear accident in  Japan .  Uxbridge, England-based Cape today resumed trading on the
 London  Stock Exchange main market after eight years on  AIM , a
trading platform for smaller companies. The company has examined
an opportunity to invest in power generation in  Hong Kong , May
said. He also expects to secure more contracts in the Caspian
Sea,  Gulf of Mexico  and  Middle East .  Cape shares rose 10 pence, or 1.9 percent, to 550 pence in
London. The company’s value more than doubled in the last year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
