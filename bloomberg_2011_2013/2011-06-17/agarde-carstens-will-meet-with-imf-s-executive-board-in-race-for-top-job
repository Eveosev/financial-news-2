French Finance Minister  Christine Lagarde  and Mexican Central Bank Governor Agustin Carstens will
be interviewed by the International Monetary Fund’s executive
board next week as they compete for the top job at the agency.  Carstens will be at the IMF in Washington June 20-21 and
will meet with the board on his second day, Gita Bhatt, a
spokeswoman for the fund, said in an e-mail. Lagarde will follow
June 22-23, with her board interview June 23, she said.  “During their visit to the fund, the candidates will also
have an opportunity to meet bilaterally with executive
directors,” Bhatt said.  The IMF aims to make a decision by June 30, a month and a
half after the arrest of former chief  Dominique Strauss-Kahn  on
charges including attempted rape. He has pleaded not guilty.  Both candidates have been traveling from Brazil to  China  in
a bid for the job, and Lagarde, who has backing from the
European Union and nations including Egypt and Morocco, has the
most support.  To contact the reporters on this story:
