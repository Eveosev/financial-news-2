Rory McIlroy of  Northern Ireland  set
a U.S. Open record with two rounds in 11-under-par 131 at
Congressional Country Club in Bethesda, Maryland.  It’s the lowest 36-hole total in the 111-year history of
the season’s second golf major, and the first time anyone has
finished the first two rounds 10 strokes or more under par.  After a 5-under-par 66 today -- capped by a double bogey at
the final hole -- he leads by eight shots over Y.E. Yang of
 South Korea , who has yet to start his second round.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
