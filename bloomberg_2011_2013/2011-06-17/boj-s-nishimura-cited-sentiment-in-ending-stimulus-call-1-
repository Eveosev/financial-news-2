Bank of Japan  Deputy Governor
Kiyohiko Nishimura said sentiment had been better than expected
when he dropped a call for the bank to expand its asset
purchases last month, a record of the policy meeting showed.  “A further deterioration in sentiment, which had
previously been feared, did not appear to have materialized,”
Nishimura said, according to minutes of the May 19-20 meeting
released today in Tokyo. Another member said additional monetary
easing is warranted, though the bank should examine “the
appropriate timing” to take action, the record showed.  Nishimura suggested in April that the bank expand its 10
trillion yen ($123 billion) asset-purchase program, a proposal
defeated by the board, which kept its key interest rate near
zero and credit programs unchanged at the gathering. The Bank of
 Japan  this week raised its monthly economic assessment for the
first time since February, saying there are signs of picking up
as supply constraints are eased and confidence of businesses and
households are improving.  The BOJ injected record amounts of cash into the money
market after a March 11 earthquake, and doubled the asset fund,
which includes investments from government debt to real estate
investment trusts. It has kept the benchmark overnight rate
between zero and 0.1 percent since October.  It has also offered 1 trillion yen in funds for lenders in
disaster-stricken areas, and unveiled a 500 billion yen loan
program to help smaller companies this week.  To contact the reporter on this story:
