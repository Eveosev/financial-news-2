Total SA (FP) , Europe’s third-biggest  oil
company , said the costs of developing energy projects are being
dragged higher by  oil prices .  “We see a trend for an increase in costs but it’s only a
trend for the time being and I hope it won’t be confirmed,”
Yves-Louis Darricarrere, head of exploration and production at
the Paris-based company, said in an interview in  St. Petersburg ,
Russia today. “We see it in many areas, it’s general, it’s
linked to the price of oil.”  In a bid to boost output, Total plans to making final
investment decisions on the Ichthys LNG project off Australia,
Egina in Nigeria and the Shtokman gas field in Russia’s Barents
Sea by the end of the year. The French oil company has said it
may raise investment to about $23 billion annually in the next
few years from about $20 billion to pay for the new, expensive
oil and natural gas projects.  OAO Gazprom,  Statoil ASA (STL)  and Total are in talks with
suppliers on the development amid rising costs, Andre Goffart,
deputy chief executive officer of Shtokman Development AG, said
at a conference in Paris last month. Shtokman may hold enough
gas to meet world demand for more than a year.  The prospect of even higher prices next year for equipment
and work required at the site favors a decision being made in
2011, Goffart said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
