Ethiopian Airlines Enterprise said
it will resume flights to the capital of  Sudan , Khartoum, today
after they were suspended due to a volcanic  ash cloud  from an
eruption in Eritrea.  The ash cloud is expected to clear soon, allowing routes to
eastern and northern Ethiopia to reopen, the company, sub-
Saharan Africaâ€™s second-biggest carrier by passenger numbers,
said in an e-mailed statement.  The Nabro volcano erupted on June 12, spewing a 13.5-
kilometer (8.4-mile) plume of ash into the air, according to the
 Volcanic Ash Advisory Center  in Toulouse, France.  To contact the reporter on this story:
