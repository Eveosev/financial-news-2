U.S. stocks rallied and benchmark
indexes were set to halt a six-week drop as a gauge of economic
indicators topped forecasts, helping the market extend an early
gain spurred by signs of progress on a bailout for  Greece .  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index climbed 0.9 percent to
1,278.71 at 10:03 a.m. in  New York . The  Dow Jones Industrial
Average  jumped 107.4 points, or 0.9 percent, to 12,068.92 .     The Conference Board’s gauge of the outlook for the next
three to six months rose 0.8 percent after a revised 0.4 percent
decline in April, the New York-based group said today.
Economists forecast a 0.3 percent gain, according to the median
estimate in a Bloomberg News survey.  Stocks maintained gains earlier after the Thomson
Reuters/University of Michigan preliminary index of consumer
sentiment in the U.S. fell to 71.8 in June from 74.3 a month
earlier, trailing the median projection of 74 in a Bloomberg
News survey of economists.  The  S&P 500  has fallen 7 percent from this year’s high at
the end of April through yesterday. Equities slumped as reports
showed business activity cooled more than forecast, sales of
existing homes unexpectedly declined and growth in industrial
production stopped. The decline threatened the 2011 gain for the
S&P 500, which was up 0.8 percent through yesterday.  Global stocks rose earlier today as Chancellor Angela
Merkel retreated from German demands that bondholders be forced
to shoulder a “substantial” share of a Greek rescue, saying
she’ll work with the  European Central Bank  to avoid disrupting
markets.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
