Palm oil  advanced after a slump in
prices widened the discount to  soybean oil  to the biggest in
more than two years, making the tropical oil a cheaper
alternative for food and cooking purposes.  The August-delivery contract gained 0.2 percent to close
at 3,198 ringgit ($1,055) a metric ton on the Malaysia
Derivatives Exchange. The most-active contract dropped as much
as 0.9 percent in intraday trading to a six-week low. Futures
fell 1.3 percent this week, a third weekly decline.  Soybean oil’s premium over palm oil widened to $222.86 a
ton yesterday, the most since February 2009, and stood at
$215.75 today. That compares with a 12-month average of $101.24
a ton, according to Bloomberg data.  “Palm is very attractive now compared to soybean oils,”
Vijay Mehta, director at Commodity Links Pte, said by phone from
 Singapore  today. “Whenever the market is dropping, a lot of
buying interest is coming in.”  Demand for cooking oils is expected to increase when the
Muslim festival of Ramadan begins in August, Mehta said.
Communal meals at night during the festival increase overall
demand for food staples even as followers fast during the day.  Still, rising Malaysian output may cap gains in prices,
Mehta said.  Malaysia’s palm oil output expanded 13.7 percent to 1.74
million tons in May from April, reaching the highest level in 19
months, the Malaysian Palm Oil Board said on June 10.  November-delivery soybeans fell as much as 0.7 percent to
$13.41 per bushel in  Chicago , while soybean oil for December
delivery slid as much as 1 percent to 57.07 cents a pound.  January-delivery palm oil on the  Dalian Commodity Exchange 
dropped 0.6 percent to close at 9,046 yuan ($1,397) a ton.
Soybean oil for delivery in the same month fell 0.5 percent to
10,168 yuan a ton at the close.  To contact the reporter on this story:
