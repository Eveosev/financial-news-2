Spain ’s 17 regions saw their debt
rise to a record 11.4 percent of gross domestic product in the
first quarter from 10.8 percent in the previous quarter.  Debt increased to 121.4 billion euros ($172 billion) from
115.3 billion euros, data released today by the Bank of Spain in
 Madrid  showed. The central bank revised lower its debt figure
for the fourth quarter of 2010 from 115.5 billion euros, or 10.9
percent of GDP.  Catalonia, the largest region with an economy the size of
 Portugal ’s, remains the most indebted region, with a 34.3
billion-euro shortfall. Castilla-La Mancha and Comunidad
Valenciana reported the highest debt-to-GDP ratios, at 16.9
percent and 17.4 percent respectively.  The regions together control more than a third of the
country’s spending and employ half of all public workers,
playing a crucial role in Spain’s efforts to cut the euro area’s
third-largest deficit. Their debt has nearly tripled in the last
10 years and budget data on May 31 indicated they aren’t on
track to meet a deficit target this year of 1.3 percent of GDP.  Prime Minister Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero aims to cut the
overall public deficit to 6 percent of GDP this year from 9.2
percent in 2010, and forecasts a debt ratio of 68.7 percent as
the minority Socialist government tries to convince investors it
can fend off contagion from  Europe ’s debt crisis.  The Bank of Spain said on June 15 that the government took
the right steps to control public finances last year, though
efforts are not being evenly shared between the central
government and the regions. The government’s capacity to control
regions’ spending is limited, it said, calling for spending caps
and sanctions.  The yield on Spain’s benchmark 10-year bond was 5.62
percent today after surging to 5.72 percent yesterday, the most
in a decade, as the cost of insuring Greek debt against default
also rose to a record.  To contact the reporter on this story:
