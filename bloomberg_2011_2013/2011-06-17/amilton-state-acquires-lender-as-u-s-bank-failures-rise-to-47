Hamilton State Bancshares Inc., the
lender that raised more than $120 million in private-equity
funds last year, purchased a failed  Georgia  firm as this year’s
tally of U.S.  bank failures  climbed to 47.  Hamilton State purchased McIntosh State Bank of Jackson,
Georgia, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. said today on its
 website . Stonegate Bank of  Fort Lauderdale , Florida, purchased
First Commercial Bank of Tampa Bay. The two failures drained
$108.5 million from the FDIC deposit-insurance fund.  Banks are closing under stress from commercial real estate
loans, tied to property values that fell as much as 45 percent
from the October 2007 peak through last August, according to
Moody’s Investors Service. Regulators have shuttered 369 lenders
since the start of 2008, FDIC data show.  Hamilton State, based in Hoschton, Georgia, paid a 0.5
percent premium to acquire McIntosh State’s $324 million in
deposits, the FDIC said. New York-based Angelo Gordon & Co. and
Tailwind Capital Group LLC agreed to inject about $60 million
each into Hamilton State as part of a $232 million capital
raise, according to a Feb. 28 statement.  Stonegate paid a premium of 0.5 percent to acquire First
Commercial Bank of  Tampa Bay ’s almost $93 million in deposits,
the FDIC said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
