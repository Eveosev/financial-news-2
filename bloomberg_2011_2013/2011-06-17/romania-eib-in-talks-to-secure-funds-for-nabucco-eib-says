The Romanian government has
started initial talks with the  European Investment Bank  to
get funds for state-owned natural gas grid operator
Transgaz SA to help build the Nabucco Pipeline.  “It’s too early to discuss details of the possible
financing aid, but I can say we have started discussions
with the government about this, ’’ Millena Messori, head of
the EIB office in Bucharest, said in an interview today.  Raiffeisen Bank International AG (RBI)  said on June 8 that
Transgaz will have to contribute as much as 50 million lei
($16.9 million) to Nabucco this year to cover operating and
pipeline expenses and another 30 million lei next year.
Nabucco is intended to transport natural gas through Europe
from the  Caspian region .  The Nabucco venture decided in May to postpone the
start of construction until 2013.  The pipeline, a joint venture of Transgaz, Germany’s
 RWE AG (RWE) , Vienna-based  OMV AG (OMV) , Budapest-based Mol Nyrt.,
Bulgargaz EAD and Ankara-based Boru Hatlari ile Petrol
Tasima AS, is designed to carry gas more than 3,900
kilometers (2,400 miles) from Turkey to Austria to reduce
European dependence on Russia.  To contact the reporters on this story:
