Aluminum inventories tracked by the
London Metal Exchange dropped for a 17th day.  Stockpiles fell 10,125 metric tons to 4.60 million tons,
daily exchange figures showed. That was the lowest level since
May 12. Most of the metal was removed from U.S. and South Korean
warehouses. Inventories declined for a fourth week.  Canceled warrants, or orders to draw aluminum from LME
stocks, fell for a fourth day to 513,900 tons. Orders reached
the highest level since at least October 1997 on June 6.  “LME canceled warrants have surged to extremely high
levels in recent weeks,” analysts at Citi Global Commodities
said in a June 14 report. “The issue now is deciding whether
this is merely a large holding being transferred to another
warehouse -- on the back of a better rent deal -- or whether
consumers are ‘canceling’ in anticipation of long delays in
getting hold of their material.”  Withdrawing aluminum from LME-approved warehouses in
 Detroit  can take as long as 7 1/2 months, according to Laredo,
Texas-based researcher  Harbor Intelligence .  Copper inventories dropped for a fifth day to 470,825 tons
after reaching the highest level since May 2010 last week.
Canceled warrants were little changed at 26,200 tons.  To contact the reporter on this story:
