Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (WMT)  said its vice
president of operations in  China  left the company, becoming at
least the third executive from that nation to depart in the past
month.  Shawn Gray left for “personal reasons,” Wal-Mart said in
an e-mail today. The Bentonville, Arkansas-based company, the
world’s biggest retailer, didn’t say if a replacement had been
named.  Roland Lawrence, Wal-Mart’s chief financial officer in
China, and Rob Cissell, chief operating officer there, left the
company in May to “seek new development opportunities.” The
retailer has sought to boost investment in China, the world’s
second-largest economy, and last month agreed to buy an
undisclosed stake in online shopping operator Yihaodian.  Wal-Mart fell 1 cent to $52.82 at 4:01 p.m. in New York
Stock Exchange composite trading. The shares have dropped 2.1
percent this year.  Operations in China, where Wal-Mart had 333 outlets at the
end of April, generated $7.5 billion in revenue, or 1.8 percent
of the company’s $420 billion in total sales last year,  Scott Price , chief executive officer for  Asia , said in March. Sales in
China rose 12 percent in the first quarter of this year, the
company said May 17.  To contact the reporter on this story:
