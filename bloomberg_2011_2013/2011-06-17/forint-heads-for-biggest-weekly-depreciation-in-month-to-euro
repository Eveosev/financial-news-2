The forint headed for the biggest
weekly decline in a month against the euro and depreciated
against the Swiss franc.  The Hungarian currency slipped as much as 0.3 percent to
269.70 per euro before trading little changed at 269.25 by 10:17
a.m. in Budapest. A close at that level would mean a 1.1 percent
depreciation this week, the most since the five days through May
13. The forint weakened as much as 0.6 percent against the Swiss
franc today and extended its weekly retreat to 1.7 percent.  The BUX index of shares slid 0.4 percent to 22,582.67, led
by Mol Nyrt.,  Hungary â€™s largest refiner, and Gedeon Richter
Nyrt., the biggest drugmaker.  To contact the reporter on this story:
