The European Commission upheld its
proposal to prohibit the disclosure of serial numbers for carbon
permits, according to updated draft regulations on the European
Union’s single carbon registry.  The updated draft, sent to EU member states yesterday and
due to be voted on later today, also keeps a 24-hour delay in
the transfer of carbon permits between  registry accounts  to
protect the EU emissions trading system from fraud and abuse. It
also modifies the proposed rules on the finality of transfers of
allowances.  Representatives of national governments in the Climate
Change Committee are scheduled to vote on the draft regulation
after noon today in Brussels, according to a meeting agenda.  The  European Federation of Energy Traders  said yesterday
the proposal to hide serial numbers brings “important
drawbacks” and called on member states to carefully consider
the issues at stake. Still, the Leipzig, Germany-based European
Energy Exchange AG said the rules proposed by the commission
will help underpin trading.  To contact the reporter on this story:
