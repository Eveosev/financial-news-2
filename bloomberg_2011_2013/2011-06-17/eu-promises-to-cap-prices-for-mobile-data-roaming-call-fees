Vodafone Group Plc (VOD) ,  Telefonica SA (TEF) 
and other mobile-phone operators may face a European Union price
cap for Internet data roaming charges under draft rules
regulators plan to publish next month.  The European Commission said it foresees price limits for
using mobile data within the EU and also plans to extend
“safeguard retail price caps” for making mobile phone calls
and sending texts outside a user’s home country after current
limits are scheduled to end in June 2012.  “Wholesale data roaming charges have fallen significantly
but consumers are not seeing that in lower retail prices,” the
regulator said in a statement on its  website  today.  The EU capped fees for making and receiving mobile-phone
calls abroad from 2008. It said last year that there should be
little difference between roaming and domestic fees by 2015. The
EU’s proposal will need approval from lawmakers and governments
before it can enter into force.  To contact the reporter on this story:
