Corn rebounded after falling to a
three-week low on speculation that ethanol producers won’t
reduce purchases of the grain after the  U.S. Senate  voted to
repeal industry tax incentives.  The U.S. Senate yesterday voted to eliminate the 45-cent
tax credit for refiners on each gallon of ethanol mixed with
gasoline and ended a 54-cent tariff on Brazilian imports. Under
an energy law known as the Renewable Fuels Standards, petroleum
refiners are still required to use 15 billion gallons of ethanol
by 2015.  “There has been no change in the mandated higher uptake of
ethanol set out in the Renewable Fuels Standard and so corn use
for domestic biofuel will stay strong,” said Justine White, an
analyst at VM Group in London. “The change in the subsidy
regime should not translate into immediate demand destruction
for corn from the ethanol sector.”  Corn futures for December delivery gained 7.5 cents, or 1.2
percent, to $6.605 a bushel by 1:15 p.m.  London  time on the
Chicago Board of Trade. The price earlier touched $6.4775, the
lowest for the most-active contract since March 17.  Lower prices also may have encouraged users of the grain
including exporters and animal feeders to purchase supplies,
White said.  “The dip also prompted some physical buying of corn for
feed as feed producers in Asia need to start booking their
supplies for September,” White said.  Wheat for September-delivery gained 5.75 cents, or 0.8
percent, to $7.14 a bushel. The price earlier dropped to
$6.9625, the lowest since March 17. Milling wheat for November
delivery dropped 2 euros, or 0.9 percent, to 214 euros ($305.27)
a metric ton, after earlier reaching 210.50, also the lowest
since March 17.  Soybeans for November-delivery gained 3.5 cents, or 0.3
percent, to $13.5375 a bushel, set for a 2 percent decline this
week. The price has declined 3.5 percent this year, partly on
speculation Chinese demand will fall.  To contact the reporter on this story:
