U.S.  commercial bank revenue  from
trading over-the-counter derivatives and securities more than
doubled to $7.4 billion in the first quarter from $3.5 billion
in the final period of 2010.  Trading revenue declined by $854 million, or 10 percent,
from the first quarter of 2010, the Office of the Comptroller of
the Currency said today in a report.  “Trading revenues followed the familiar pattern of
seasonal strength in the first quarter,” Martin Pfinsgraff,
deputy comptroller for credit and market risk, said in a
statement.  The U.S.  Commodity Futures Trading Commission  and
Securities and Exchange Commission are leading efforts under the
Dodd-Frank Act to write rules requiring most swaps to be
guaranteed by central clearinghouses and traded on exchanges or
other platforms.  JPMorgan Chase & Co.,  Bank of America Corp. (BAC) , Citigroup
Inc.,  Morgan Stanley (MS)  and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. executed 96
percent of the $321 trillion of over-the-counter derivatives
trades by the top 25 U.S. bank-holding companies as of March 31,
according to the report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
