Japan’s stocks fell to a three month
low amid concern the government will scale back spending on
disaster reconstruction and Greece’s debt crisis will worsen.  Canon Inc. (7751) , a camera maker that counts Europe as its
biggest source of revenue, slid 1.3 percent.  Toyota Motor Corp. (7203) ,
the world’s biggest carmaker, lost 0.6 percent.  Shimizu Corp. (1803) ,
Japan’s largest builder by market value, tumbled 6.7 percent.
Tokyo Electric Power Co., owner of the nuclear plant crippled by
March’s earthquake and tsunami, slumped 5.6 percent after the
head of Japan’s banking lobby group said lenders won’t consider
forgiving loans to the company.  The Nikkei 225 Stock Average dropped 0.6 percent to
9,351.40 at the 3:00 p.m. close in Tokyo, its lowest close since
March 18. Concern that Greece will default on its debt
overshadowed U.S. reports yesterday on employment and housing
that suggest the world’s biggest economy isn’t faltering.  “As long as the  Greece ’s debt crisis isn’t taken care of
investors are going to be very cautious,”  Naoki Fujiwara , who
helps oversee $6 billion in Tokyo at Shinkin Asset Management Co.
“People are worried Greece’s problems will spread to
neighboring countries. If that happens, it will weigh heavily on
stocks.”  ‘Almost Certain’  The Nikkei declined 1.7 percent this week, the biggest
weekly drop since May 13, amid concern Greece’s sovereign debt
crisis will derail the global economic recovery.  Former Federal Reserve Chairman  Alan Greenspan  said
yesterday that a default by Greece is “almost certain” and
that could help drive the  U.S. economy  into recession.  “The problem you have is that it’s extremely unlikely the
political system will work” in a way that solves Greece’s
crisis, Greenspan said in an interview with  Charlie Rose  in  New
York . “The chances of Greece not defaulting are very small.”  Canon, the world’s biggest camera maker, slid 1.3 percent
to 3,690 yen. Toyota, which gets about 72 percent of revenue
outside of Japan, fell 0.6 percent to 3,175 yen.  Daikin
Industries Ltd. (6367) , the world’s second-largest maker of air
conditioners by sales, declined 0.9 percent to 2,760 yen.  The broader Topix index dropped 0.9 percent to 805.34, its
lowest close since March 15 and extending losses this week to
1.5 percent. The gauge has tumbled 13 percent since March 10,
the day before a magnitude-9 earthquake and tsunami devastated
Japan’s northeast coast, triggering the worst nuclear accident
in 25 years, disrupting supply chains, and leaving more than
23,000 people dead or missing.  Japan Reconstruction  “The government’s reconstruction policy isn’t moving
ahead,” said Naoteru Teraoka, general manager at Tokyo-based
Chuo Mitsui Asset Management Co., which oversees about $28
billion. “Even before the quake, the domestic economy was weak
and you had a lot of firms dependant on overseas markets. Now,
with government in such confusion, investing in the domestic
market makes even less sense.”  Prime Minister Naoto Kan’s ruling Democratic Party of Japan
on June 15 proposed scaling back a second disaster
reconstruction package to 2 trillion yen ($25 billion), or half
of the size of the first one. Kan two weeks ago survived a no-
confidence vote by pledging to resign once the crisis from the
March earthquake and the meltdowns at Tokyo Electric Power Co.’s
Fukushima nuclear plant are contained.  Shimizu declined 6.7 percent to 318 yen, leading
construction companies lower.  Kajima Corp. (1812) , Japan’s second-
biggest contractor by sales, sank 3.9 percent to 222 yen.
Smaller  Obayashi Corp. (1802)  slipped 3.7 percent to 336 yen.  Tepco Slides  Tokyo Electric tumbled 5.6 percent to 302 yen. Masayuki Oku,
chairman of the Japanese Bankers Association, said yesterday
that while banks may still provide loans to the utility, they
aren’t considering forgiving the utility’s debts.  Tepco, as the company is known, has lost 86 percent of its
value since March 10, the day before its Fukushima Dai-Ichi
plant was destroyed. The company is the worst-performing stock
on the Nikkei, which has lost 9.9 percent since the temblor.  Sekisui House Ltd. (1928)  slumped 5.7 percent to 717 yen. The
company had its rating lowered to “neutral” from
“outperform” at JPMorgan and Credit Suisse. Separately, the
builder announced plans to sell at least 50 billion yen of
convertible bonds.  To contact the reporters on this story:
