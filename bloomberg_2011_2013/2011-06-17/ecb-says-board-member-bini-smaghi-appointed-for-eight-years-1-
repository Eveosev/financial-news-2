The  European Central Bank ,
responding to questions about Executive Board member Lorenzo Bini Smaghi’s future, said board members are appointed for eight
years and take decisions in “full independence.”  “All the members of the Executive Board have been
appointed for eight years according to their contracts,” an ECB
spokeswoman said. “This period of eight years is laid down in
the Treaty itself. Members of the Executive Board take all their
decisions in full independence.”  Bini Smaghi, whose term isn’t due to end until May 2013, is
facing mounting pressure from the leaders of Italy and France to
leave early as part of their deal to allow fellow Italian  Mario Draghi  to become ECB president. While euro-area nations have
found consensus on Draghi’s replacement of  Jean-Claude Trichet 
as chief of the Frankfurt-based ECB in November, that would
leave Italy with two seats on the six-member board.  “To obtain the support of France for our candidate Mario
Draghi, we need to have a French member on the board and we are
working on that,” Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi told
journalists yesterday before asking Bini Smaghi to resign.
French President  Nicolas Sarkozy  said today in Berlin that Italy
had given “its word” on the matter.  Bini Smaghi declined to comment today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
