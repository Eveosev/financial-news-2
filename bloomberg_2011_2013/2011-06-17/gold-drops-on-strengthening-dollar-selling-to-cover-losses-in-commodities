Gold may gain for a fourth day in
New York as concern about Europe’s debt crisis spurs demand for
a protection of wealth.  Chancellor  Angela Merkel  signaled a willingness to
compromise on German demands that bondholders shoulder a
“substantial” share of a Greek rescue, saying she’ll work with
the European Central Bank to resolve the crisis. Gold is trading
3.1 percent below its record reached last month.  “The market remains very jittery and there is still far
too much uncertainty over Greece,”  Andrey Kryuchenkov , an
analyst at VTB Capital in London, said today in a report.
“Global risk sentiment is still sour and bullion could well
rally to May highs given a renewed flight to safety should
matters worsen.”  Gold for August delivery fell $1.90, or 0.1 percent, to
$1,528 an ounce by 8:15 a.m. on the Comex in  New York . The metal
is down 0.1 percent this week. Immediate-delivery gold was 0.2
percent lower at $1,527.40 in London.  Bullion rose to $1,526.25 an ounce in the morning
“fixing” in London, used by some mining companies to sell
output, from $1,523.25 at yesterday’s afternoon fixing. The
metal pared some of its losses after the euro rebounded against
the dollar. Gold typically moves counter to the greenback.  A Greek default is “almost certain” and could help drive
the  U.S. economy  into recession, Former Federal Reserve Chairman
 Alan Greenspan  said in an interview yesterday with  Charlie Rose 
in New York.  Greek Debt Crisis  Gold is up 7.5 percent in 2011 after climbing the past 10
years, the longest run of gains in at least nine decades in
London.  Europe ’s debt crisis helped bullion futures reach a
record $1,577.40 on May 2. Fifteen of 23 traders, investors and
analysts surveyed by Bloomberg said gold will rise next week.
Five expect lower prices and three were neutral.  The dip may be a good buying opportunity as the Greek debt
crisis “shows no signs of ending,” said Hwang Il Doo, a Seoul-
based senior trader at KEB Futures Co.  Silver for July delivery declined 0.3 percent to $35.46 an
ounce in New York. Palladium for September delivery fell 1.1
percent to $755.40 an ounce, after dropping to a three-week low
of $743.55. Platinum for July delivery was down 0.4 percent at
$1,754.40 an ounce. It fell to as low as $1,745.70, the lowest
level since May 23.  To contact the reporters on this story:
