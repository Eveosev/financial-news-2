NBC Universal’s bid on the Olympics
hinged on getting four games and the broadcast channel might
have let a rival to win if the contract had been limited to 2014
and 2016, said Brian Roberts, chief executive officer of parent
company  Comcast Corp. (CMCSA)   NBC outbid competitors after it was allowed to bid for the
2018 and 2020 games, where it sees the most value, Roberts said
in an interview in Chicago yesterday. Comcast this month agreed
to pay $4.38 billion for the U.S. TV rights.  Analysts including Stifel Nicolaus & Co.’s  Christopher King 
have said NBC may not earn a profit on the Olympics, a
projection Roberts disputes. Comcast, the largest U.S. cable
provider, says the 2014 and 2016 games should break even or earn
a small profit while the later games will yield a bigger payoff.  “Our strategy was to go long and bid for four games, not
two,” Roberts said. “With four games, we will put content on
the Golf Channel as well as Versus and hopefully expand
distribution. We also have the digital rights for all devices
now and into the future, which is great given the explosion of
content across all platforms.”  The likely increase in value of digital rights, inflation,
and the ability to charge cable providers with higher affiliate
fees for NBC and its cable networks all factored in to Comcast’s
bidding strategy, he said. NBC’s bid for just the 2014 and 2016
games would likely have been in line with competitors  Walt
Disney Co. (DIS)  and  News Corp. (NWSA) , Roberts said.  Comcast, which owns 51 percent of NBC, spent about $2
billion for the rights to air the 2014 and 2016 games. Disney’s
ESPN offered $1.4 billion for the 2014 and 2016 rights, and News
Corp.’s Fox bid $3.4 billion for all four Olympics, two people
with knowledge of the bids said this month.  Sochi, Pyeongchang  Golf becomes an Olympic sport in the 2016  Summer Olympics 
in Rio de Janeiro. Comcast’s cable networks include Golf Channel
and the sports-oriented Versus.  The 2014 Winter Olympics will be in Sochi,  Russia . Munich,
Pyeongchang,  South Korea , and Annecy, France, are competing for
the 2018 Winter Olympics. The  International Olympic Committee 
will decide on the site on July 6. The IOC will announce the
location for the 2020 games in 2013. No finalists have been
named yet.  Philadelphia-based Comcast, which completed the purchase of
the NBC Universal stake in January, rose 10 cents to $23.54 at
12:23 p.m.  New York  time on the Nasdaq Stock Market. The shares
had gained 6.7 percent this year before today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
