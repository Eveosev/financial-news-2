The cost of protecting Australian
and Japanese corporate bonds from default dropped, according to
traders of credit-default swaps.  The Markit iTraxx Australia index fell 2 basis points to
117.5 basis points as of 10:33 a.m. in Sydney, according to
Deutsche Bank AG. The index is on course for its highest weekly
close since September as the Greek debt crisis roils markets,
prices from CMA show.  The Markit iTraxx  Japan  index dropped 0.75 basis point to
133.75 as of 9:33 a.m. in  Tokyo , according to Deutsche Bank.  The Markit iTraxx Asia index of 50 investment-grade
borrowers outside Japan was little changed at 118 basis points
as of 8:33 a.m. in  Hong Kong , Deutsche Bank prices show. That
would be the highest weekly close since September, according to
data from CMA, which is owned by CME Group Inc. and compiles
prices quoted by dealers.  Credit-default swap indexes are benchmarks for protecting
bonds against default and traders use them to speculate on
credit quality. A drop signals improving perceptions of
creditworthiness, while an increase suggests the opposite.  The swap contracts pay the buyer face value in exchange for
the underlying securities if a borrower fails to meet its debt
agreements. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  To contact the reporter on this story:
