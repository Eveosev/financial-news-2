Burkina Faso’s  government will
dismiss the country’s  electoral commission  following the June 8
resignation from the panel by representatives from opposition
parties, said Jerome Bougouma, minister of territorial
administration and security.  Benewende Stanislas Sanakra, an opposition leader who lost
a presidential election to incumbent Blaise Compaore in
November, has been calling for the resignation of the
commission’s members since that vote, alleging fraud.  The government “could not remain indifferent” to the
demands for the panel’s dismissal, Bougouma told reporters in
Ouagadougou, the capital, today. The state will introduce a bill
at the National Assembly to approve the resignation, he said.  Burkinabe civil-society organizations also want a new
electoral commission, said Francoise Yougbare, a member of a
national council of the organizations. “It was time to change
the members,” she told reporters.  The commission members will “respect this law and resign,”
Boris Edson Yameogo, a spokesman for the group, said by phone.  Compaore won a fourth term in power with 80 percent of the
vote, the commission said Nov. 25.  To contact the reporter on this story:
