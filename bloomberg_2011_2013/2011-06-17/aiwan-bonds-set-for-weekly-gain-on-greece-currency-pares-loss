Taiwan’s government bonds had the
biggest weekly advance in three months as European leaders
struggled to agree on a rescue plan for  Greece , boosting demand
for safer assets.  Ten-year yields reached a one-week low today after Greek
Prime Minister  George Papandreou  said he will reshuffle his
cabinet after attempts to garner opposition support for the
government’s austerity plan failed. The island’s currency
completed its biggest weekly loss since February.  “Taiwan’s government bonds had a volatile week, as stocks
slumped and investors fled to safety,” said James Wang, a
fixed-income trader at Yuanta Securities Co. in Taipei.  The yield on the 1.375 percent notes due March 2021, the
most-traded security, dropped five basis points this week to
1.48 percent as of the 1:30 p.m. close in Taipei, according to
Gretai Securities Market. The rate was little changed today.  Taiwan ’s dollar weakened 0.6 percent to NT$29.000 against
its U.S. counterpart during the five-day period as of the 4 p.m.
close, according to Taipei Forex Inc. It reached NT$29.005 today,
the lowest level in three weeks.  The overnight money-market rate, which measures interbank
funding availability, declined one basis point, or 0.01
percentage point, to 0.34 percent this week, according to a
weighted average compiled by Taiwan Interbank Money Center.  To contact the reporter on this story:
