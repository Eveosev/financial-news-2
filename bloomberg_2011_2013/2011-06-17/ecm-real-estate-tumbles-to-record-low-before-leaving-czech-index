ECM Real Estate Investments AG (ECM)  fell
to its lowest ever in the last day of trading before being
excluded from the Czech Republicâ€™s PX equity index.  The developer in central  Europe  that filed an insolvency
petition with a court last month slumped 14 percent to 29.26
koruna at 4:26 p.m., the lowest close since ECM started trading
in December 2006.  ECM will leave the PX benchmark as of June 20, cutting the
number of companies included to 14, the Prague Stock Exchange
said last week in a  statement  on its website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
