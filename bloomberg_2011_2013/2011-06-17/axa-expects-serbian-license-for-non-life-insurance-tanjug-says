The Serbian unit of  Axa SA (CS)  has been
issued a license allowing it to offer non- life insurance 
products in the Balkan country, the central bank said.  The permit enables the subsidiary of Europe’s second-
largest insurer by market value to “complete its offer on the
Serbian insurance market,” which it entered through the
acquisition of Credit Agricole Life’s local unit in 2010, the
 Narodna Banka Srbije  said in a statement on its website.  The company was renamed  Axa Zivotno Osiguranje  and offers
life insurance. The Paris-based insurer also registered Axa
Nezivotno Osiguranje a.d.o. to sell non-life products and
secured the license after “proving its serious intentions for
positioning on the market,” the central bank said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
