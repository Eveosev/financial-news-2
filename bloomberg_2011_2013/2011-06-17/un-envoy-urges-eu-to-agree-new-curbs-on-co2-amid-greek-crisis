European Union leaders should commit
to further limits on their greenhouse gas emissions at the same
time as they’re fighting to contain  Greece ’s sovereign debt
crisis, the United Nations diplomat leading climate talks said.  “Countries such as Greece are having a particularly hard
time and yes that is part of the reality,” Christian Figueres,
head of the UN Framework Convention on  Climate Change , said at a
press conference in Bonn today. “Countries need to despite all
of this move forward with a firm footing with a vision towards
the long term for climate.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
