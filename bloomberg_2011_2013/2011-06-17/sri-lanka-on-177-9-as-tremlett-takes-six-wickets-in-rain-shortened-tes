England bowler  Chris Tremlett  took
four wickets on the second day of the rain-affected third
cricket Test to reduce Sri Lanka to 177-9 in Southampton.  Tremlett took his tally for the match to six by taking four
of the five wickets the visitors lost today. The Sri Lankans
added 96 runs in the 23.2 overs played at the  Rose Bowl . Top-
scorer Prasanna Jayawardene was dismissed for 43 when Eoin
Morgan took a catch off Graeme Swann. Dilhara Fernando (33)
and Chanaka Welegedara (7) were batting when rain stopped play
this afternoon.  Tremlett and James Anderson each took two wickets in the 38
overs played yesterday. Rain, which delayed the start of both
days, returned this afternoon to halt play shortly after 3 p.m.  England  leads the three-Test series 1-0, after winning the
first match in Cardiff. The second Test, at Lordâ€™s in London,
was drawn.  To contact the reporter on this story:
