The yuan rose to a 17-year high
after the National Business Daily newspaper said there is
speculation  China  will announce a “relatively important”
currency policy on June 19, the anniversary of the scrapping of
a two-year peg.  The yuan completed a weekly advance after the People’s Bank
of China set the yuan’s reference rate 0.13 percent stronger to
a record 6.4716 per dollar today. The State Administration of
Foreign Exchange said in its annual report that China will
gradually increase exchange-rate flexibility, which was
interpreted as a signal that the yuan’s trading band will be
expanded, the National Business Daily also said, citing
unidentified analysts.  “It’s the one-year anniversary of de-pegging the yuan to
the dollar and people speculate there will be another change,”
said Dariusz Kowalczyk, a Hong Kong-based strategist at  Credit
Agricole  CIB. “And the fixing was much stronger, raising
speculation they are preparing the market for a stronger yuan.”  The yuan gained 0.09 percent this week and was unchanged
today at 6.4744 per dollar as of the close at 4:30 p.m. in
 Shanghai , according to the China Foreign Exchange Trade System.
It touched 6.4634 earlier, the strongest level since China
unified official and market exchange rates at the end of 1993.
The yuan isn’t allowed to move more than 0.5 percent on either
side of the daily fixing.  Credit Agricole expects China to widen the trading band in
the near future and the currency to appreciate to 6.30 by year-
end, Kowalczyk said.  In  Hong Kong ’s offshore market, the yuan climbed 0.24
percent today and 0.16 percent this week to 6.4685. The 12-month
non-deliverable forward on the currency added 0.33 percent to
6.3845, a 1.4 percent premium to the spot rate, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
