Billionaire Stephen Jarislowsky, one
of  Research In Motion Ltd. (RIMM) ’s largest shareholders, added his
name to the call for the BlackBerry smartphone maker to split
the roles of chairman and chief executive officer.  “You should not have these two people at both positions
because they have worked together all their lives and they are
basically the same person, from point of view of policy,”
Stephen Jarislowsky, chairman of Jarislowsky Fraser Ltd., said
today in an interview.  The Montreal-based investment firm, which was the company’s
sixth-biggest investor with 10.2 million shares of RIM at the
end of the first quarter, has sold more than half its stake, he
said.  Mike Lazaridis , who invented the BlackBerry to handle
mobile e-mail, has shared the role of CEO with  Jim Balsillie 
since 1992 and they are also both co-chairmen.  To contact the reporter on this story:
