Ethanol futures rose for the first
time in four days in  Chicago  as higher corn prices boosted
production costs.  The biofuel advanced as corn’s cost for immediate delivery
fell 11 percent in the past week through yesterday in Chicago,
enticing purchases by end-users of the grain such as food
manufacturers, feedlots and ethanol producers.  “It’s a function of the corn,” said  Terry Reilly , an
analyst at Citigroup Global Markets Inc. in Chicago. “It kept
ethanol prices higher. “Importers, feedlot and ethanol plants
should all be locking in the forward curve at this point.”  Denatured ethanol for July delivery rose 0.7 cent, or 0.3
percent, to $2.641 a gallon on the Chicago Board of Trade.
Futures have gained 11 percent this year.  In cash market trading ethanol in  New York  sank 6.5 cents,
or 2.3 percent, to $2.76 a gallon and in Chicago the additive
lost 4 cents, or 1.5 percent, to $2.685.  Ethanol in the U.S. Gulf dropped 3 cents, or 1.1 percent,
to $2.745 a gallon and on the West Coast the biofuel climbed 1.5
cents, or 0.5 percent, to $2.855.  Corn futures for December delivery increased 7 cents, or
1.1 percent, to $6.60 a bushel in Chicago. One bushel makes at
least 2.75 gallons of ethanol.  To contact the reporter on this story:
