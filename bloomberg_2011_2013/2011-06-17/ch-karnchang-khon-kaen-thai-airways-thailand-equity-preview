decline.  PTT Exploration & Production Pcl (PTTEP)  , Thailand’s
only publicly traded oil explorer, declined 1.2 percent to

largest carrier, fell 0.9 percent to 29.25 baht. The airline had
its share-price forecast cut to 40.50 baht from 50.50 baht at
Credit Suisse Group AG, which cited higher fuel costs and
increased political risk.  To contact the reporter on this story:
