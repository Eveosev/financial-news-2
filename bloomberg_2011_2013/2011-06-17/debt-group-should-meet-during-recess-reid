Senate Majority Leader  Harry Reid 
said Vice President  Joe Biden ’s bipartisan deficit-cutting group
should stop taking breaks when one or both houses of Congress is
in recess.  The Nevada Democrat, in an interview posted on the PBS
“NewsHour” website today, said about the group, “I have one
big complaint. And that is, they shouldn’t be taking breaks.
They should be meeting every week, multiple times each week.”  Biden and six lawmakers from both parties are trying to
work out a deficit-reduction plan in time for Congress to meet
an Aug. 2 deadline for raising the nation’s $14.3 trillion debt
limit.  The group held its first meeting on May 5, had three get-
togethers this week and plans to meet as many as four times next
week. It has skipped other weeks when either the House or Senate
was in recess. Both houses will be in session during four of the
seven remaining weeks before Congress’s August vacation.  “All these congressional recesses, that should have no
bearing,” said Reid, who isn’t a member of the group.  “I’m saying that when the Senate is in recess we should be
working on this,” he said Reid. “When the House is in recess
we should be working.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
