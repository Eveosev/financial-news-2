EuroSibEnergo , the Russian utility
controlled by billionaire Oleg Deripaska, signed an investment
framework agreement with China Yangtze Power Co. for a series of
power projects in Eastern Siberia.  “The proposed new plants will be the foundation for the
development of new industries and infrastructure in Eastern
Siberia, driving the region’s growth,” EuroSibEnergo said in an
e-mailed statement today, citing Chairman Andrey Likhachev.  The agreement was signed by Likhachev and Yong Bai, chief
financial officer at Shanghai-listed Yangtze Power, at the St.
Petersburg International Economic Forum, according to the
statement. The companies are currently conducting a feasibility
study, EuroSibEnergo said, without giving investment values.  Projects that the companies are studying include the
Lenskaya CHP in the Ust-Kut, Irkutsk region and the Nizhne-
Angarskaya HPP in the Krasnoyarsk Territory, according to
EuroSibEnergo.  -- Wang Ying . Editors: Ryan Woo.  To contact the reporter on this story:
