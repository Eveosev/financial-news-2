Telkom  South Africa  Ltd., the
continent’s biggest fixed-line network operator, was reduced to
“sell” at Avior Research Ltd., which cited “generally
disappointing” full-year results.  “The group has acknowledged that it needs to boost capex
in order to improve the competitiveness and capacity of its data
offering, which in our view is the only growth vector in the
near term,” Johannesburg-based analysts Peter Coutromanos and
David Lerche wrote in an e-mailed note to clients today.  The recommendation was reduced from “hold,” according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
