Romanian prices of natural gas for
industrial consumers such as chemical and steel plants will rise
30 percent by March next year,  Mediafax  reported, citing
unidentified government officials.  Prices of the commodity will probably rise twice through
next year with a first increase of 10 percent coming as soon as
next month, according to the Bucharest-based news service.  The Romanian government approved yesterday a measure to
keep natural gas prices for households unchanged from July until
March next year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
