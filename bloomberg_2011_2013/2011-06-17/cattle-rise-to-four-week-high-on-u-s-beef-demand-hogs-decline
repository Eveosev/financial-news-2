Cattle futures rose to a four-week
high on signs of increasing demand for U.S. beef amid concern
that supplies will decline later this year. Hog prices dropped.  As of midday, wholesale beef was up for the second straight
day. Feedlots bought 1.81 million head of cattle last month,
down 11 percent from 2.03 million in May 2010, the  U.S.
Department of Agriculture  said after futures settled. Thirteen
analysts surveyed by Bloomberg News projected a 7.5 percent
decrease, on average.  “Movement of beef has really been good this week,” said
 Mark Schultz , the chief analyst at Northstar Commodity
Investment Co. in  Minneapolis . “It might be sign of better
things to come down the road.”  Cattle futures for August delivery rose 2.35 cents, or 2.2
percent, to settle at $1.102 a pound at 1 p.m. on the Chicago
Mercantile Exchange. After the close of regular trading, the
price reached $1.10425, the highest for the most-active contract
since May 16.  This week, cattle jumped 6.5 percent, the most since mid-
January. The commodity has climbed 24 percent in the past year.  Feeder-cattle futures for August settlement climbed 2.675
cents, or 2.1 percent, to $1.3265 a pound. The price reached
$1.32975, the highest for a most-active contract since May 16.  Hog futures for August settlement fell 0.375 cent, or 0.4
percent, to 94.85 cents a pound. The price, up 2.2 percent this
week, has climbed 15 percent in the past year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
