Cameroon plans to boost cocoa
production to as much as 300,000 metric tons a year by 2015, up
from about 219,000 tons, according to Jean Marie Mboutou, an
official with the government’s Integrated Cocoa Plant Protection
Program.  Cameroon, the world’s fifth-biggest producer of the crop
after  Ivory Coast ,  Ghana ,  Indonesia  and  Nigeria , plans to boost
output by training farmers to maintain and clean farms to ensure
parasites and old pods, which can cause disease, are removed,
Mboutou said in an interview today in the capital, Yaounde.  “Our mission is to ensure that farmers regulate the
humidity level by making sure their cocoa plants receive at
least 70 percent of sunlight”, Mboutou said.  Improved farming conditions will increase yields from 300
to 500 kilograms (661 to 1,102 pounds) a hectare (2.47 acres) to
800 to 2,000 kilograms, he said.  Cocoa farms in the Central African nation at present cover
450,000 hectares of land produced by 600,000 farmers, Mboutou
said.  Cameroon has produced 219,000 tons of cocoa this year since
the season started in August, according to the Cocoa and Coffee
Board. The country’s output was 198,000 tons in 2009-10.  To contact the reporter on this story:
