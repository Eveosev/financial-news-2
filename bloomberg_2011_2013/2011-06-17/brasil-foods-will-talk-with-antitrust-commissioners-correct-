June 15.)  BRF - Brasil Foods SA (BRFS3)  will hold
talks with members of the country’s antitrust regulator to seek
approval for its acquisition of Sadia SA after a ruling was
postponed today and one of the agency’s five commissioners said
last week that the deal should be blocked.  Wilson Mello, the company’s vice-president for corporate
affairs, made the comments to reporters in Brasilia today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
