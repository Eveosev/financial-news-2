Peru’s sol-denominated bonds rose
for a fourth week, pushing yields lower, as European leaders
moved closer to a compromise on preventing a Greek default,
boosting demand for higher-yielding, emerging-market assets.  The yield on the nation’s benchmark 7.84 percent sol-
denominated bond due August 2020 fell five basis points, or 0.05
percentage point, to 6.43 percent this week, according to prices
compiled by Bloomberg. The bond’s price rose 0.36 centimo to
109.65 centimos per sol. The yield dropped seven basis points
today.  German Chancellor  Angela Merkel  and French President
 Nicolas Sarkozy  signaled reconciliation on working out financial
assistance for Greece.  “The hope is that Greece will see some band-aid measure
which will draw a feint line under this current episode,” said
 Mike Moran , a currency strategist at Standard Chartered Bank in
New York. “The market sees this as a short-term fix.”  The sol rose 0.1 percent to 2.7610 per U.S. dollar from
2.7625 yesterday. The currency has risen less than 0.1 percent
this week, its sixth weekly advance in seven.  To contact the reporter on this story:
