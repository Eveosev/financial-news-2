Russia ’s Micex Index sank the most
in two weeks as oil dropped to near a four-month low on concern
the Greek debt crisis will hobble the economic recovery.  The 30-stock gauge slumped 1.5 percent to 1,645.82 at the
6:45 p.m. close in Moscow, its steepest drop since June 3. The
measure has declined 2.3 percent this week. Oil producer OAO
Gazprom Neft decreased 0.3 percent to 122.63 rubles, while OAO
Sberbank, Russia’s biggest lender, fell 1.5 percent. The dollar-
denominated RTS Index slid 1 percent to 1,878.55.  Oil, Russia’s chief export revenue earner, dropped as much
as $2.83 a barrel to the lowest since Feb. 22, and last traded
at $93.59 per barrel. Former Federal Reserve Chairman  Alan
Greenspan  said a Greek default is “almost certain” and could
help drive the U.S. into recession.  OAO Rostelecom, Russia’s dominant fixed-line telephone
operator, climbed the most since January 2000 after the stock’s
inclusion in a benchmark index prompted investors to cover
bearish bets in a so-called short squeeze. The shares jumped 27
percent to 220.82 rubles.  To contact the reporter on this story:
