Peru’s sol rose and headed for its
second straight weekly gain as European leaders moved closer to
a compromise on preventing a Greek default.  The sol rose 0.1 percent to 2.7605 per U.S. dollar at 12:15
p.m.  New York  time, from 2.7625 yesterday. The currency has
risen less than 0.1 percent this week, headed for its sixth
weekly advance in seven.  German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President
Nicolas Sarkozy signaled reconciliation on working out financial
assistance for Greece.  “The hope is that Greece will see some band-aid measure
which will draw a feint line under this issue,” said  Mike Moran , a currency strategist at Standard Chartered Bank in New
York.  To contact the reporter on this story:
