Indian stocks dropped for the third
day, with the benchmark index completing its second weekly
decline, amid concern that a possible sovereign-debt default by
 Greece  will derail the global economic recovery.  Tata Consultancy Services Ltd. (TCS) , the nation’s largest
software exporter, which gets 27 percent of its revenue from
 Europe , fell the most in two months. Nearest rival Infosys Ltd.
slumped for a fourth day.  Housing Development Finance Corp. (HDFC) , the
biggest mortgage lender, slid to a one-month low after the
central bank increased  interest rates  yesterday.  The Bombay Stock Exchange Sensitive Index, or Sensex,
dropped 115.35 points, or 0.6 percent, to 17,870.53, at the 3:30
p.m. close in Mumbai. The gauge declined 2.2 percent this week,
the steepest drop since the five days ended May 6. Asian stocks
fell, capping the MSCI Asia Pacific Index’s longest weekly
losing streak since 2004. The S&P CNX Nifty Index on the
National Stock Exchange lost 0.6 percent to 5,366.40 and its
June futures settled at 5,372.70. The BSE 200 Index decreased
0.7 percent to 2,225.66.  “There is nervousness in the markets,” said Arun Khurana,
a  fund manager  at UTI Asset Management Co., India’s fourth-
biggest mutual fund, with $15.2 billion in assets. “There could
be a flight of capital from emerging markets on account of the
problems in Europe.”  Tata Consultancy sank 3.6 percent to 1,109.2 rupees and its
June futures settled at 1,115 rupees. Infosys decreased 1.1
percent to 2,769.65 rupees.  Wipro Ltd. (WPRO) , the third-biggest, fell
1.7 percent to 408.85 rupees. India’s biggest software exporters
get more than 75 percent of their revenue from overseas.  Greek Crisis  The 10-member Bombay Stock Exchange IT Index dropped 1.9
percent to 5,818.66, its lowest close since September. That’s
the steepest decline among the 13 industry groups on the bourse.  Greek Prime Minister  George Papandreou  called on his allies
in parliament to back austerity measures needed to qualify for
international aid and avoid a sovereign-debt default. Alan Greenspan, former Federal Reserve chairman, yesterday said a
default by Greece is “almost certain.”  The Indian currency lost 0.4 percent this week to 44.88 per
dollar. The Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against the
currencies of six major U.S. trading partners, climbed 0.4
percent this week, extending last week’s 1.4 percent gain.  ‘Getting Worse’  “The Greece debt situation is just getting worse and the
dollar has strengthened because of that,” said Sudarshan Bhatt,
chief currency trader at Corporation Bank in Mumbai. “The rupee
isn’t getting any support from stocks either.”  The rupee may drop to 45.20 in the coming week, Bhatt said.  Hindalco Industries Ltd. (HNDL) , the aluminum producer that
controls Atlanta-based Novelis Inc., slid 1.9 percent to 169.85
rupees. The stock has lost 8.1 percent this week, the worst
performer on the Sensex.  Housing Development slid 1.5 percent to 638.65 rupees on
concern that higher borrowing costs will curb loans and consumer
spending. The 14-member Bombay Stock Exchange Bankex Index
declined for a second week.  The  Reserve Bank  of India increased the repurchase rate to
7.5 percent from 7.25 percent yesterday, extending the longest
streak of monetary tightening in a decade, after India’s
benchmark wholesale-price inflation accelerated to 9.06 percent
in May from 8.66 percent in April. The bank signaled it may slow
the most aggressive monetary tightening among  Asia ’s major
economies as risks to global growth threaten to undermine
consumer demand.  Living Costs  India joined nations from  China  to  South Korea  in stepping
up the fight against surging living costs that have stoked
protests in the South Asian nation. Accelerating inflation has
contributed to a 13 percent decline in the benchmark  stock index 
in Mumbai this year, the biggest drop in Asia, on concern rising
rates will erode corporate earnings and economic expansion.  Rate increases will slow India’s economic expansion this
year and help ease inflation to 6 percent “with an upward
bias” by March 31, 2012, central bank Governor Duvvuri Subbarao
said May 3. India’s economy may grow “around 8 percent” in the
year through March, from 8.5 percent in the previous 12 months,
he estimated.  Tata Steel Ltd. (TATA) , the largest producer of the alloy, surged
3.6 percent to 573.05 rupees after it sold its entire stake in
 Australia ’s Riversdale Mining Ltd. to Rio Tinto Group for A$1.06
billion ($1.12 billion). Tata’s 26.3 percent holding in the
Sydney-based coking coal developer almost doubled in value in
less than four years, the company said.  Stocks on the Sensex measure are valued at an average 14.5
times estimated profit, down from 21.5 times in March 2010, last
year’s high. The MSCI Emerging Markets Index trades at 10.7
times earnings.  Overseas investors sold a net 921 million rupees ($20.6
million) of Indian stocks on June 15, taking total withdrawals
from equities this year to 3.81 billion rupees, according to
data on the  website  of the Securities and Exchange Board of
 India .  To contact the reporter on this story:
