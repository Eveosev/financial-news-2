A South Korean business delegation
held talks with Guinean authorities about investing in the
country’s natural resources, the West African nation’s Foreign
Ministry said.  “ South Korea  needs iron, uranium and several other
resources, the raw materials which Guinea has,” the ministry
said, citing Kim Eun-Seok, South Korea’s ambassador for energy
and resources. “We wish to meet the country’s decision-makers to
discuss concrete projects.”  Guinea is the world’s biggest producer of bauxite, an ore
used to make aluminium, and also produces gold and diamonds,
according to the website of the  U.S. Geological Survey .  To contact the reporter on this story:
