U.K. stocks erased gains as shares
of ARM Holdings Plc and BAE Systems Plc retreated.  The FTSE 100 Index was little changed at 5,700.41 at 3:28
p.m. in  London  after climbing as much as 0.6 percent earlier.
The gauge has swung between gains more than five times today.  ARM retreated 1.8 percent to 551.5 pence, BAE slid 1.2
percent to 308.8 pence and Kingfisher Plc retreated 1.3 percent
to 264.7 pence.  Volatility may be unusually high today as index options
expire in throughout  Europe .  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
