Industrial & Commercial Bank of
China (601398)  agreed to buy 80 percent of  Standard Bank  Ltd.’s Argentine
unit, El Cronista Comercial  reported , citing people it didn’t
identify.  ICBC, as the Hong Kong-based lender is known, is likely to
pay $700 million to $800 million for the unit, while Standard
Bank will keep the remaining 20 percent, according to the Buenos
Aires-based newspaper. The due diligence process has already
been concluded, the paper said.  Standard Bank declined to comment because the report is
“pure speculation,” according to an e-mail from Ross Linstrom,
a spokesman for the Johannesburg-based lender.  To contact the reporter on this story:
