The European Union December carbon
call option at a 20-euro strike price dropped to a record low,
as demand for upside protection has waned.  The price of the option dropped 2 cents yesterday, or 7.7
percent, to 24 euro cents ($0.34) a metric ton on the ICE
Futures Europe exchange. The 20-euro call option has more open
interest than any other strike price. The exchange handled 1.25
million metric tons of the option yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
