Kenyan President Mwai Kibaki
appointed Willy Mutunga as the East African nation’s chief
justice, the presidency said.  Nancy Baraza was named as Mutunga’s deputy, while Keraiko
Tobiko becomes director of public prosecutions, according to an
e-mailed statement from Kibaki’s office in Nairobi, the capital.  The appointments follow months of wrangling between Kibaki
and Prime Minister  Raila Odinga  over changes to the judiciary
promised in the country’s new constitution.  In January, Odinga rejected Kibaki’s appointment of a new
chief justice, attorney general, director of public prosecutions
and budget controller, saying he wasn’t consulted as required by
the constitution. That new charter was promised in a power-
sharing accord reached in 2008 to end two months of post-
election violence that left an estimated 1,500 people dead and
displaced 300,000 more.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
