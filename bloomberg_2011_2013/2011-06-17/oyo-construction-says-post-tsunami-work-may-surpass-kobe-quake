Toyo Construction Co., the Tokyo-
base port builder, said work following  Japan ’s March 11 tsunami
may surpass the 60 billion yen ($744 million) it earned after
the 1995 Kobe quake as local governments bolster sea defenses.  “There is going to be a rush to increase safety and
security around the country,” Executive Officer Nobuyuki Kawase
said in an interview in  Tokyo  yesterday. “‘People are
increasingly recognizing how important concrete is for
protection.’’  Sea-defense work and reconstruction in areas directly hit
by the March tsunami may help Toyo boost civil-engineering
orders by 10 percent annually through as long as March 2016,
Kawase said. That may help the company avoid a fourth straight
decline in annual sales after the government cut public-works
spending in a bid to reduce its  budget deficit .  Toyo, which helped rebuild Kobe Port following the 1995
quake, has surged 85 percent since March 10 in Tokyo trading,
compared with a 12 percent drop for the Topix Index. It was
unchanged at 89 yen at 9:06 a.m. today.  Toyo posted 122 billion yen of sales in the year ended
March 31, compared with 270 billion yen in the year ended March
31, 2001. The company, which gets about half of orders from
civil engineering, expects revenue to decline to 115 billion yen
this fiscal year, excluding disaster work.  The March earthquake and tsunami caused about 480 billion
yen of damage to ports and seawalls, according to Japan’s
transport ministry.  Tokyo Electric Power Co., the operator of a nuclear power
plant crippled by the tsunami, has said it plans to construct a
wall to a height of 15 meters (50 feet) above  sea level  off the
coast of its Kashiwazaki Kariwa facility northwest of Tokyo
following the March disaster.  To contact the reporter on this story:
