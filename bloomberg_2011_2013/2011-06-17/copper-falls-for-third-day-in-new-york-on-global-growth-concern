Copper fell for the third straight
day in  New York  on concern that global economic growth may be
slowing, curbing demand for the metal used in cars, homes and
appliances.  A default by Greece is “almost certain” and may help
drive the  U.S. economy  into recession,  Alan Greenspan , a former
Federal Reserve chairman, said yesterday. Copper has dropped 12
percent since reaching a record $4.6575 a pound on Feb. 15 as
manufacturing slowed in  China , the world’s largest metals buyer.
Chinese imports fell for a second month in May.  “Copper is currently confronted by a soft patch in global
economic growth, monetary tightening in some regions and fiscal
crises in others,” Stephen Briggs, a senior metal analyst at
BNP Paribas SA in  London , said in an e-mailed report today.  Copper futures for September delivery declined 1.5 cents,
or 0.4 percent, to close at $4.121 at 1:30 p.m. on the Comex in
New York. The price still gained 1.1 percent this week.  On the London Metal Exchange, copper for three-month
delivery rose $30, or 0.3 percent, to $9,095 a metric ton ($4.13
a pound.)  Copper is “caught between misleadingly poor demand signals
from China and a large underlying deficit,” Briggs said. “The
latter may largely explain the relative resilience of the copper
price.”  The metal may rise to a record $11,000 in late 2011 or
early 2012 once Chinese destocking ceases, he said.  Nickel and tin also rose in London. Aluminum, lead and zinc
dropped.  To contact the reporter on this story:
