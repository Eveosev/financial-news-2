ICE Futures  Europe  began
consultation to change its gasoil futures specifications.  “This change is likely to include, but will not
necessarily be limited to, a reduction in the sulfur content
from the current specification of no higher than 0.1 percent,”
the London-based exchange said in a  circular  dated yesterday to
members posted on its website.  The proposal would implement changes from the January 2014
contract, ICE said. The exchange may also consider putting new
requirements in place as early as the January 2013 contract.  Germany, Europe’s largest heating market, is encouraging
sales of gasoil with a 50 parts-per-million sulfur content for
environmental reasons. Gasoil is a category of fuel that
includes heating oil, diesel and  jet fuel .  The ICE gasoil contract accepts a maximum of 1,000 ppm
sulfur and is used as a European benchmark for other products.  To contact the reporter on this story:
