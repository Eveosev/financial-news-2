Gasoline slid to a three-week low on
concern that Greek’s debt crisis weakens  Europe ’s economic
recovery and threatens global fuel demand.  Gasoline fell as much as 2.5 percent as German  Chancellor
Angela Merkel  called for private creditors to participate in a
Greek rescue plan. Greek Prime Minister  George Papandreou 
overhauled his Cabinet to try to secure passage of austerity
measures needed for a bailout.  “There’s growing levels of unease of how the economic
recovery is playing out here and in Europe,” said  Gene McGillian , an analyst and broker at Tradition Energy in
Stamford, Connecticut. “If Greece defaults, you will snuff some
of the recovery that Europe has seen.”  Gasoline for July delivery fell 2.19 cents, or 0.7 percent,
to $2.9275 a gallon at 9:50 a.m. on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange . Prices touched $2.8745, the lowest intraday price for
the front-month contract since May 23.  European finance ministers next meet on Greece in
Luxembourg on June 19-20, followed by a Brussels summit of
European Union leaders on June 23-24.  Regular gasoline at the pump declined 1 cent to $3.675
yesterday, according to AAA data on its website. It’s the lowest
level since April 3.  Heating oil for July delivery dropped 2.84 cents, or 1
percent, to $2.9754 a gallon on the Nymex. Prices touched
$2.9347, the lowest intraday level since May 25.  To contact the reporter on this story:
