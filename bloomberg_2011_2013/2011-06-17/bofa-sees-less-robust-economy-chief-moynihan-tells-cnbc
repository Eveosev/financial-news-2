Bank of America Corp. (BAC) , the largest
U.S. lender, is prepared for lower economic growth as the
housing slump and unemployment weigh on its customers,
Chief Executive Officer  Brian T. Moynihan  told CNBC.  “There’s still spending, so hopefully that will just keep
driving the economy along,” Moynihan told the business-news
channel today. “But the signs are a little less robust than
they were a few month ago.” Bank of America is based in
Charlotte, North Carolina.  To contact the reporter on this story:
