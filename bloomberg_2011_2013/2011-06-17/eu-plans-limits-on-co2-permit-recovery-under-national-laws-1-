European Union regulators proposed a
regulation that would limit carbon traders’ ability to use
national law to recover specific carbon allowances.  Regulators are seeking to boost security in the market
after thefts of allowances prompted the closure of spot trading
on the BlueNext exchange in Paris in January for 15 days. The EU
carbon market was set up to help the bloc achieve its emissions-
reduction target under the 1997  Kyoto Protocol .  “The fungibility of allowances and Kyoto units shall imply
that any recovery or restitution obligations that may arise
under national law in respect of an allowance or Kyoto unit
shall only apply to the allowance or Kyoto unit in kind,”
according to a draft of the regulation obtained today by
Bloomberg News.  The regulation won’t prevent a trader from making a claim,
“as long as this does not lead to the reversal, revocation or
unwinding of the transaction in the registry or recovery or
restitution directed at specific numbered allowances or Kyoto
units,” according to the draft.  To contact the reporters on this story:
