Republican Senator  Richard
Lugar , in an interview on Bloomberg Television’s “Political
Capital with  Al Hunt ,” airing this weekend, said the
president’s performance on foreign policy has slipped to
“at best” mediocre.  (This is not a legal transcript. Bloomberg LP cannot
guarantee its accuracy.)  AL HUNT: We begin the show with Senator Richard Lugar
of  Indiana . Senator, thank you so much for being with us.  SENATOR RICHARD LUGAR: Thank you, Al.  HUNT: You said the other day the president’s refusal
to seek congressional authorization of U.S. involvement in
Libya is both unwise and legally dubious. If the White
House persists in refusing to seek authorization, would you
vote to cut off funding?  LUGAR: Well, I’m going to wait until we get the
hearing that I’ve asked for. And I applaud Senator  John
Kerry , our chairman, for acceding to my request that we
really have the administration on record as - the
constitutional rationale for this.  We had one briefing on how the military activity is
actually going on at the secret clearance level. But the
people from the administration were not empowered to give
any reasons why we had the ability to be there at all. And
so we need to come to grips with that. Now, other than that
-  HUNT: Well, conversely, if Senator Durbin brings up,
as he said he might the other day, a resolution in support
of what we’re doing in Libya -  LUGAR: Yes.  HUNT: - would you vote for that from what you know
right now?  LUGAR: No. But I admire  Dick Durbin . He’s taking a
position in which he’s very skeptical, but he (inaudible)
to have a vote up or down, he might propose such so that
people could debate the thing, and in both houses.  So it would be not just for show, but at the same
time, we’re really coming to grips here with something that
is a very small conflict, a small war, but - an examination
of how we get into wars.  If, in fact, the president simply can say this is a
humanitarian effort and, after all, the  Arab League  has
called for it, we’ve sought the  United Nations ’ permission,
our NATO allies - at least a third of NATO - are for it, we
ought to be helpful in some respect. Even if we do fire
half-a-billion dollars worth of Tomahawk missiles at  Libya ,
knocking out installations, and refuel our allies and do
all sorts of things, this is really not a conflict.  HUNT: The White House also says that the mission is
not to get rid of Qaddafi. Do you believe that?  LUGAR: No, because at the same time, people in the
administration talk about Qaddafi must go -  HUNT: Right.  LUGAR: - that he’s illegitimate, lacks - and so forth.
And so they feed this with Europeans, who also believe
Qaddafi must go. Now, in the meanwhile, there are rumors
from time to time that even Russian diplomats have been
visiting with Qaddafi, but have been rebuffed. Qaddafi told
them where to go, namely that he’s going to stay, they’re
the ones that’ll have to go home.  It’s a situation which my guess is that the president
or others felt they might get lucky, that if they did look
as if NATO was coming in, Qaddafi would say, “It is time
for me to go.”  HUNT: Right. And it’s lasted longer than they thought.  LUGAR: And, perhaps, as was handed (ph), maybe some
diplomacy would occur as to where Qaddafi might go, so he
would not be in harm’s way. But people weren’t lucky. And
you can’t fight wars on the basis somehow people might be
bluffed out because now it goes on and on and on. And we’re
spending - and the  United States  is spending real money, at
least $700 million to date, estimate over $1 billion by
September. Out in the front room, we’re still talking about
the budget. In the back room, however, war goes on and it’s
almost irrelevant.  HUNT: You keep spending. Well, let me ask you about
another troubled spot. You’ve worried about Pakistan for a
long time. The situation seems to have gotten worse since
the bin Laden. They were rounding up American
collaborators. They’re threatening the army chief of staff.
What should we do? Should we tell Pakistan, “I’m sorry, we
really are going to cut off aid if you keep this up”?  LUGAR: Well, that would not be wise, because we’re
dealing with  Pakistan  because we’re involved in
 Afghanistan .  HUNT: Right.  LUGAR: And Pakistan has borders and people come back
and forth across the borders. On some days, we are grateful
that they try to shoot Taliban and stop al-Qaeda types.
Other times, we feel they’re highly lax. We are dealing
with a government to begin with that is a weak government.
President Zardari, vis-a-vis his military, does not have
much control -  (CROSSTALK)  HUNT: Can we do anything? Do we have any leverage?  LUGAR: Our only leverage is the fact that we both need
each other, given the predicament in Afghanistan or
elsewhere in the  Middle East .  HUNT: I’m going to turn to Afghanistan in a minute,
but given the situation, do you worry more about the safety
and security of nuclear weapons?  LUGAR: Well, I think there is a real worry, and we’ve
raised this question, and the Pakistanis have said this is
our sovereign right to deal with this. We don’t want this
intrusion.  As a matter of fact, they have felt we have been more
and more intrusive and that we ought to get over it, that
they’re a sovereign country, and that we ought to deal with
them as a sovereign country.  HUNT: You mentioned Afghanistan. You also said that
the administration next week is probably going to - well,
they’re probably going to announce the beginning of their
troop withdrawal. You said more important than any number
is for the president to put forth a definition of success
in Afghanistan based on U.S. vital interest. What is your
definition?  LUGAR: Well, I’m waiting for the president’s
definition, because I think we ought to listen carefully to
the military people, as opposed to imposing this. But as a
starter, I would say that we’re going to have to try to
determine what level of security might be obtained by
Afghans fighting and governing themselves and how they’re
going to pay for it.  HUNT: So what size force would we need to do that,
would you imagine?  LUGAR: Well, it was suggested in one of our Foreign
Relations hearings, I think by Richard Haass, for whom I
have a lot of respect, that we ought to be down somewhere
to 20,000 or 30,000 level.  HUNT: And how soon could we get there, would you
think?  LUGAR: Well, you could get there, I think, within a
year of time, if that was your inclination.  HUNT: Within a year? Right.  LUGAR: Now, for the moment, it does not appear to be.  HUNT: No, but it seems to me that you are favorably
disposed towards that -  (CROSSTALK)  LUGAR: Yes, I am, because I believe that, even though
the administration has said that the wars in Afghanistan
and  Iraq  are only costing $117 billion this year as opposed
to $159 billion the year before, this is a disproportionate
amount of the  defense budget  on one small country. In other
words, it’s a big world, and the al-Qaeda or Al-Shabaab or
the terrorists are in many countries, and therefore, we are
going to need a strategy which really, through our better
intelligence and through better rifle shots, literally,
gets us more security -  (CROSSTALK)  HUNT: Let me ask you a final question. Professor
Lugar, put your grading cap on. Two years ago, you told the
Fort Wayne newspaper that you would give  Barack Obama  an A
in foreign policy. What would you grade him today?  LUGAR: Oh, I think at best a C. And I say this simply
because the efforts in Afghanistan do not really have the
benefit of objectives and a very clear path. The Libya
situation borders on being a fiasco altogether. And our
diplomacy with regard to Pakistan, as we discussed,
certainly leaves a lot to be desired. We have a NATO
alliance that is becoming weaker as time goes on, despite
the admonitions of Secretary Gates this week, that - sort
of get with it. You can’t have your defense budgets
declining every year, everybody out of Afghanistan, that
won’t help us.  In short, this is not a situation that is going
particularly well. Now, one can say, well, after all, it’s
a very difficult and dangerous world. That’s why I don’t
say it’s a failure. But it’s at best a mediocre situation.  HUNT: Okay, Senator Richard Lugar, thank you so much
for being with us today. And when we come back, 2012
politics and efforts in  Washington  to reach a deficit
agreement. Bloomberg reporters are next.  ***END OF TRANSCRIPT***  THIS TRANSCRIPT MAY NOT BE 100% ACCURATE AND MAY
