(Corrects spelling of country in headline.)  A “hard haircut” for investors in
Greek securities would risk contagion to other European
countries and have unpredictable knock-on effects,  Jean-Claude Juncker , head of the euro-region finance ministers group, was
cited as saying in an interview with newspaper Tagesspiegel.  “We have absolutely no experience as to what may happen if
a member of a unique monetary union such as this one were to
take such a step,” Juncker was quoted as saying in the German
newspaper. “The risks are so big that I can only warn of such a
move.”  Juncker also said “it will be an extremely difficult
process for the Greeks” to execute policies ensuring they pay
back their debt, Tagesspiegel said. “I don’t think  Greece ’s
outlook is as gloomy as it is often described.”  “A hard haircut would risk contagion for many European
countries with unpredictable consequences,” Juncker said,
according to Tagesspiegel.  To contact the reporter on this story:
