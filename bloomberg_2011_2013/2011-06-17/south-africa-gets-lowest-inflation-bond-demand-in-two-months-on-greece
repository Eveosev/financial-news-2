South Africa  received the smallest
amount of orders in more than two months at a sale of inflation-
linked bonds as investors shunned riskier assets on concern
 Greece ’s debt crisis will spread.  Investors submitted bids for 765 million rand ($112.4
million) of debt, the lowest demand at an auction of inflation-
linked debt since April 1, according to the central bank’s data
on Bloomberg. Yields rose for this first time in two month, with
the rate on the 2.45 percent notes due 2033 adding 3.5 basis
points, or 0.035 percentage point, to 2.535 percent, compared
with the previous sale.  Foreign investors have been net sellers of 1.8 billion rand
of South African bonds this week, according to JSE Ltd. data, as
concern grew that a Greek debt default would spread contagion to
other countries in the euro region.  “Today’s inflation-linked auction should not be looked on
as a great predictor of what the market anticipates inflation
will be,” Tradition Analytics researchers led by Johannesburg-
based Quinten Bertenshaw said in a research note before the
auction. “It will reflect generally weak demand for emerging-
market and indeed South African debt assets at a time when the
risks in the euro zone are massively elevated.”  The Pretoria-based  Reserve Bank  auctioned 555 million rand
($81.1 million) of the notes due 2033. The central bank sold 45
million rand of 2.75 percent inflation-linked bonds due 2022 at
a yield of 2.54 percent, two basis points higher than at the
previous auction. It didn’t allocate any 2.6 percent inflation-
linked notes due 2028.  The breakeven rate, or yield difference between 10-year
inflation-linked bonds and similar-maturity fixed-rate notes, an
indicator of investors’ outlook for inflation, has climbed 11
basis points to 5.88 percent in the past week.  The consumer inflation rate rose to 4.2 percent in April,
from 4.1 percent the previous month, the Pretoria-based
statistics agency said on May 17. The rate quickened to 4.3
percent in May, according to the median estimate of nine
economists in a Bloomberg survey.  To contact the reporter on this story:
