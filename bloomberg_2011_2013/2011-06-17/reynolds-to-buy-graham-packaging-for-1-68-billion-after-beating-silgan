Reynolds Group Holdings Ltd., the
packaging company owned by New Zealand billionaire Graeme Hart,
agreed to acquire Graham Packaging Co. for $1.68 billion,
beating out a previous bid from  Silgan Holdings Inc. (SLGN)   Reynolds, a unit of Hart’s Rank Group Ltd., will pay Graham
investors $25.50 a share, 50 cents more than its June 13 bid,
York, Pennsylvania-based Graham said today in a statement.
That’s equal to about $4.5 billion plus debt.  Hart, New Zealand’s  richest  man, gains a plastic-container
business with customers such as PepsiCo Inc., maker of Gatorade
and Tropicana beverages. The transaction adds to more than $13
billion of packaging acquisitions since 2006.  Blackstone Group LP, the world’s largest private-equity
firm, owns 61 percent of Graham after selling shares of the
packaging company to the public in February 2010 for $10 each.  Hart’s original bid of $4.3 billion including net debt
equals 8.96 times Graham’s earnings before interest, taxes,
depreciation and amortization in the past 12 months, which would
have made it the most expensive takeover of a U.S. plastic-
container maker in nine years, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. Rank Group is based in Auckland,  New Zealand .  Silgan, based in  Stamford ,  Connecticut , said in a separate
statement that is it entitled to a termination fee of $39.5
million for the cancellation of its April 13 buyout agreement.  Silgan had agreed to pay 0.402 of a share and $4.75 in cash
for each share of Graham. That equals $20.64 a share, or $1.36
billion, based on Silgan’s closing price yesterday.  Calculations for the offer values are based on 65.7 million
Graham shares outstanding on April 25, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
