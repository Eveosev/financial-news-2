China ’s stocks swung between gains
and losses. Material producers retreated on concern the central
bank will take more steps to cool inflation, while coking
companies rose on merger potential.  Laiwu Steel Corp. (600102)  lost 4.9 percent. Shanxi Coking Co.,
China’s largest publicly traded coking coal producer, rallied
after the China Securities Journal said the government will
introduce measures to prevent the resources from becoming
scarce, including mergers.  “There’s no reason to buy into the market now because of
the uncertainty over further monetary policies,” said Hao Kang,
a Beijing-based  fund manager  at ICBC Credit Suisse Asset, which
oversees $8.7 billion.  The Shanghai Composite Index lost 4.72, or 0.2 percent, to
2,659.57 at 1:35 p.m., extending the retreat from the lowest
level since Sept. 30 and adding this week’s loss to 1.7 percent.
The  CSI 300 Index (SHSZ300)  slid 0.1 percent to 2,915.50.  Concern the world’s second-largest economy is slowing has
dragged the Shanghai gauge down 13 percent from this year’s high
on April 18. The central bank announced a half percentage point
boost in the reserve requirement ratio for banks on June 14,
adding to its 11 reserve-requirement and four interest-rate
increases since early 2010 to cool inflation. The  stock index 
has lost 5.3 percent this year, extending the 14 percent retreat
in 2010.  Shanghai Composite stocks trade for 12.4 times estimated
profit, compared with an average 19.5 times in the past five
years and 10.8 times for the MSCI Emerging Market Index,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  A gauge tracking material companies slipped 0.8 percent,
the second-biggest decline among the CSI 300 Index’s 10 industry
groups. Laiwu Steel sank 4.9 percent to 9.15 yuan. Hebei Iron &
Steel Co. dropped 1.1 percent to 4.33 yuan.  Interest Rates   The central bank increased the yield on three-month bills
for the first time in 10 weeks yesterday, spurring speculation
of further monetary tightening.  The People’s Bank of China sold 1 billion yuan ($154
million) of the securities at 2.9985 percent, up from 2.9168
percent last week, according to a statement on its website
yesterday. China Development Bank Corp., the nation’s second-
largest issuer of bonds, scrapped a 20 billion yuan offering of
floating-rate notes due to “market conditions,” a statement on
Chinabond, the biggest debt clearing house, said.  “The move by the PBOC to raise yields sends a strong
signal for an imminent rate hike in coming days,” Wee-Khoon
Chong, a fixed-income strategist at Societe Generale SA in  Hong
Kong , wrote in a research report yesterday. “A hike in
benchmark rates shouldn’t be a big surprise as it is well
expected.”  ‘Further Pullback’  The Shanghai Composite may extend losses by as much as 13
percent within three months, after falling below a “key support
level” of 2,675, according to Trading Central Asia Ltd. The
measure remains “capped” by a descending 20-day moving
average, said Jeffrey Zhang, head of Asia research at Trading
Central in Hong Kong.  “The slide below 2,675 should trigger a further pull back
to 2,570 and then to 2,500 in the coming weeks,” said Zhang.
“For the mid-term, the index is indeed under pressure. Further
downside is more likely to 2,320 within one to three months.”  Shanxi Coking advanced 2.7 percent to 15.10 yuan. Yanzhou
Coal Mining Co., China’s fourth-biggest coal miner, increased
1.2 percent to 32.82 yuan. Shanxi Lu’an Environmental Energy
Development Co. climbed 2.6 percent to 58.69 yuan.  China plans to introduce mining measures to prevent coking-
coal resources from becoming scarce, China Securities Journal
reported today, citing an unidentified person.  The National Energy Administration is preparing the
measures, according to the Beijing-based newspaper. The
government may limit mining licenses and encourage companies to
merge to achieve “protective” mining, according to the report.  The China National Coal Association is drafting plans for
the formation of large coal companies in the five years through
2015, the 21st Century Business Herald reported today, citing an
unidentified person.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
