Here's a graphical look at how employment has historically recovered following recessions. Something to keep in mind as jobs come to dominate the national conversation in the months to come. Next week, we'll take a look at the recessions of the early 80s, and in particular the Fed's actions leading up to them. Send us your thoughts.
