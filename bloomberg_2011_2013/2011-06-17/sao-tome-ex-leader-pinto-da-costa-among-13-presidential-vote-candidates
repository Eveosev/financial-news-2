Sao Tome and Principe voters will
choose from 13 candidates, including the country’s first leader,
Manuel Pinto da Costa, in a presidential election planned for
July 17, according to the country’s  Supreme Court .  Two women, including former Prime Minister Maria das Neves
and Elsa Pinto, who was minister of national security, are
running as independent candidates.  Opposition leader Aurelio Martins of the Movement for the
Liberation of Sao Tome and Principe/Social Democratic Party and
Evaristo Carvalho, a former prime minister, are also in the
running, according to a document from the court, which set
yesterday as the deadline for candidates.  President Fradique de Menezes will step down after serving
two five-year terms in office. He is not eligible to run again,
according to the country’s policies.  Pinto da Costa became leader after the islands gained
independence from colonial ruler,  Portugal , in 1975. He
established a one-party state and led until 1990, when the
country legalized opposition groups and held elections in 1991,
according to the U.S. State Department.  Sao Tome and Principe is  Africa ’s second-smallest country
by population after Seychelles, with about 169,000 people. Its
gross domestic product of $1,171 per capita compares with the
sub-Saharan African average of $1,127, according to the  World
Bank .  To contact the reporter on this story:
