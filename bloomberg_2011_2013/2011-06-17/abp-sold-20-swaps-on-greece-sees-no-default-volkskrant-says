Stichting Pensioenfonds ABP sold 20
credit-default swaps on Greek bonds, four of which will expire
this weekend, Dutch newspaper  de Volkskrant  reported, without
saying where it got the information.  Should  Greece  default on its debt, the Dutch pension fund
would have to pay 160 million euros ($227 million) to clients
who bought the swaps, the newspaper said.  ABP is confident Greece will survive the crisis without
defaulting and prefers receiving the premiums on the swaps to
selling them at a profit, de Volkskrant said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
