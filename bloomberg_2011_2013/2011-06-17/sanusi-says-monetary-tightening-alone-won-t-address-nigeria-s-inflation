Nigerian Central Bank Governor
Lamido Sanusi said monetary tightening alone won’t address
accelerating inflation in the West African nation.  The rising cost of imported food and unsubsidized fuel
products indicate the risks to inflation are still on the
upside, Sanusi said by phone yesterday from the capital, Abuja.  “The reason we tightened policy at the last monetary
policy committee meeting was partly because we believed the
underlying fundamentals continue to point to inflation risks,”
Sanusi said. “We think it will help up to a point.”  Nigeria ’s inflation rate rose to 12.4 percent in May from
11.3 percent the month earlier, the National Bureau of
Statistics said yesterday. With inflation above the 10 percent
target, the central bank raised its key rate for the third time
this year in May by half a percentage point to 8 percent. Policy
makers also doubled the reserve requirement for banks.  Rising prices “would always be a problem through the
import channel, especially with pressure on the naira even
against a weakening dollar,” Sanusi said.  The central bank governor has previously warned that rising
government expenditure may push up inflation in the West African
nation.  President  Goodluck Jonathan  signed a revised 2011 budget on
May 27 after lawmakers agreed to reduce spending plans to 4.48
trillion naira ($26.8 billion) from their previous proposal of
4.972 trillion naira.  To contact the reporter on this story:
