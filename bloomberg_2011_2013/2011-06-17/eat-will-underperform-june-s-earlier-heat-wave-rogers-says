The looming heat expected to spread
from the Midwest and South to the East Coast, won’t be as severe
as the event that prompted high electricity use and health
alerts earlier this month, said  Matt Rogers , President of
Commodity Weather Group LLC.  The heat will start off strong in the Midwest in the next
five days, Rogers said from his office in Bethesda, Maryland.
As it spreads east a lack of strength and rain, among other
factors, will lessen its impact, he said.  “The upcoming heat events for the Midwest, East and South
are expected to underperform significant heat from the first
half of June,” he said in a note to clients.  In his 6- to 10-day outlook, issued for June 22 to June 26,
Rogers calls for the U.S. East Coast and Canadian Maritimes to
be warmer than normal. The heat will concentrate on the
Northeast and eastern  Canada  from June 27 to July 1, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
