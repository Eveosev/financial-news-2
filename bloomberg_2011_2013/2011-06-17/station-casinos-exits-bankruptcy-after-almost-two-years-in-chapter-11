Station Casinos Inc., the biggest
U.S. gambling company in bankruptcy, exited Chapter 11 almost
two years after seeking court protection.  Station was reassembled by its founding family, led by
Frank Fertitta and his brother, Vice Chairman Lorenzo Fertitta.
They own 45 percent of the restructured company after investing
almost $200 million, Las Vegas-based Station said today in an e-
mailed statement.  “Lorenzo and I believe in the future of  Las Vegas , which
is why we remain committed to the company and the community,”
Frank Fertitta said in the statement.  Other owners include lenders  Deutsche Bank AG (DBK)  with 25
percent and  JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM)  with 15 percent, some
bondholders and Tom Barrack’s Colony Capital LLC.  Station filed for Chapter 11 protection in July 2009 after
a leveraged buyout by the Fertitta family and Colony Capital.
Station is exiting bankruptcy with 17 of the company’s 18
casinos still controlled by the existing owners.  Aliante Station, the 18th, is still managed by Station
after being taken over by creditors in May.  The bankruptcy case is In re Station Casinos Inc., 09-
52477,  U.S. Bankruptcy Court , District of Nevada (Reno).  To contact the reporters on this story:
