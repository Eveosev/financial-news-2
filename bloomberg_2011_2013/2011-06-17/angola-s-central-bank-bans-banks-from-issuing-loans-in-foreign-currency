Angola  banned commercial banks from
issuing loans in foreign currency in an attempt to limit the use
of the dollar in the economy, Banco Nacional de Angola said.  Exceptions can be made for borrowers such as the government
and businesses with proven “revenues and receivables” in
foreign currencies, the central bank said in a statement on its
website yesterday.  “Financial institutions are expressly forbidden to realize
credit operations, by disbursement in foreign currency of any
term,” it said.  Angola,  Africa ’s second-biggest oil producer, needs to
lower  interest rates , while boosting confidence in the local
currency, the kwanza, central bank Governor Jose de Lima Massano
said in March. In November, the bank capped foreign currency
purchases by residents at $5,000 and instructed commercial banks
to value 80 percent of their capital in kwanza by June 2012.  To contact the reporter on this story:
