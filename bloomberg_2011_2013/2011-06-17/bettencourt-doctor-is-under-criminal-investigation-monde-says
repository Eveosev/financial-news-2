Liliane Bettencourt’s doctor,
Christophe de Jaeger, is under investigation for allowing
employees at his Paris clinic who aren’t licensed doctors to
write treatment forms, pre-signed by him, for patients,  Le Monde 
reported today.  De Jaeger and two of his employees are named in the probe,
which dates back to 2001, the newspaper said without stating how
it learned the information. De Jaeger was chosen by advisers to
Bettencourt, heir to the founder of  L’Oreal SA (OR) , and her daughter
to monitor the heiress’s mental health and decide whether she
needed closer supervision, the newspaper said.  A lawyer for Bettencourt’s daughter wrote to de Jaeger in
May questioning his “all-powerful role in the health” of her
mother, the newspaper reported.  Lawyers for de Jaeger, Bettencourt and her daughter didn’t
return calls from Bloomberg News for comment on the report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
