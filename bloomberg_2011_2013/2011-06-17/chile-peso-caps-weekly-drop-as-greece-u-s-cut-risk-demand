Chile ’s peso fell, capping the
biggest weekly slide in six weeks, as European debt concerns and
disappointing U.S. economic data eroded demand for riskier,
emerging-market assets.  The peso slid 0.1 percent to 472.1 per  U.S. dollar  from
471.50 yesterday, extending a decline since June 10 to 0.9
percent, the most since the five days ended May 6.  “We’ve had negative data from the U.S. and concern about
the sovereign debt situation in Europe, which has led foreign
investors to sell pesos and take their dollars to safer
havens,” Marcelo Zuniga, a trader at the brokerage unit of
Banco de Chile, said today by telephone.  The euro has fallen 0.3 percent this week on speculation
that  Greece  will become the first euro-area member to default on
its sovereign debt while U.S. manufacturing activity in the  New
York  area unexpectedly fell 7.8 percent in June and industrial
production rose a less-than-forecast 0.1 percent in May. Copper,
which accounts for half of Chile’s exports, fell 0.5 percent in
New York today, reducing a weekly gain to 1 percent.  Chile’s central bank paid an average of 471.24 per U.S.
dollar for $50 million today, as part of a $12 billion effort to
limit the peso’s gains, according to data posted on its website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
