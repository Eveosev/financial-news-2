Russia ’s monetary policy is “moving
in the right direction” and interest rates may be higher, said
central bank First Deputy Chairman  Alexei Ulyukayev .  “We probably could be tighter but anyway I believe we are
moving in the right direction,” Ulyukayev said today in an
interview with Bloomberg Television at the  St. Petersburg 
International Economic Forum. “Not too fast but in the right
direction.”  Bank Rossii signaled last month it may pause rate increases
as risks from inflation and a slowing economic recovery were
balanced. Industrial production slowed last month to the weakest
pace since 2009. The regulator raised its overnight deposit rate
to 3.5 percent from 3.25 percent in May while leaving the
refinancing and overnight repurchase rates unchanged after a
quarter-point increase in April.  The  International Monetary Fund  urged Russia to conduct
“more decisive monetary tightening” to help meet the central
bank’s inflation goal of 6 percent to 7 percent, according to a
 report  released June 14.  Policy makers are maintaining its target of keeping
inflation this year at “no more than 7 percent,” Ulyukayev said.
“Now the year-on-year CPI index is going down. And I expect the
acceleration” of that trend in July.  To contact the reporters on this story:
