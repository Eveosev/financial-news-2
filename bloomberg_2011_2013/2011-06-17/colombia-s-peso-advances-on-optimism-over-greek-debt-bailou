Colombia ’s peso rose for the first
time in three days amid optimism that European leaders will
reach a compromise on a financial rescue for Greece.  The peso advanced 0.1 percent to 1,791.80 per U.S. dollar
at 4:26 p.m. New York time, from 1,793.50 yesterday. Today’s
gain pared the peso’s weekly drop to 0.8 percent. It has jumped
6.5 percent this year, the best performance among the six most-
traded Latin American currencies tracked by Bloomberg.  Following a meeting with German Chancellor  Angela Merkel ,
French President  Nicolas Sarkozy  said a “breakthrough” had
been made on the Greek debt crisis, signaling a reconciliation
between German calls for investors to help bail out  Greece  with
warnings from the  European Central Bank  and France that a
compulsory move risked triggering the euro area’s first
sovereign default.  “Risk appetite is driving today’s move,” said Daniel
Velandia, head analyst at Bogota-based brokerage Correval SA.
“It had been a while since the peso was as strongly tied to
external markets as it is now.”  The yield on Colombia’s 10 percent bonds due July 2024 fell
five basis points, or 0.05 percentage point, to 7.81 percent,
according to Colombia’s stock exchange. The security’s price
rose 0.447 centavo to 117.536 centavos per peso.  Colombia’s central bank raised its overnight lending rate
today for a fifth month, ignoring pressure from President  Juan
Manuel Santos  to pause at 4 percent and preserve growth.  The seven-member board, led by bank chief Jose Dario Uribe,
increased the key rate by a quarter point to 4.25 percent,
meeting expectations of 22 of 23 economists surveyed by
Bloomberg. One analyst expected the rate to remain unchanged.  To contact the reporter on this story:
