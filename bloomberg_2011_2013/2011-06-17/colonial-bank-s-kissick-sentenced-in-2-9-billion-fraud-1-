A former executive of the defunct
 Colonial Bank , Catherine Kissick, was sentenced to eight years
in prison for her role in a $2.9 billion fraud involving Taylor,
Bean & Whitaker Mortgage Corp.  Kissick, 50, whose role in the fraud contributed to the
failures of Colonial Bank and Taylor, Bean, was sentenced today
by U.S. District Judge Leonie M. Brinkema in Alexandria,
Virginia, the U.S. attorney for the district said an e-mailed
statement.  Kissick, who headed the bank’s mortgage warehouse lending
division, pleaded guilty in March to one count of conspiracy to
commit bank, wire and securities fraud. Co-conspirator Teresa
Kelly, a former operations supervisor at Colonial who reported
to Kissick, was also sentenced today to three months in prison,
prosecutors said.  Lee Farkas , the ex-chairman of Taylor, Bean on April 20 was
found guilty of 14 counts of conspiracy and bank, wire and
securities fraud in what prosecutors said at the time was an
almost $3 billion scheme involving fake mortgage assets.  Colonial Bank was one of the 25 largest banks in the U.S.
and  Taylor Bean  was one of the largest closely held mortgage
lending companies in 2009, according to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
