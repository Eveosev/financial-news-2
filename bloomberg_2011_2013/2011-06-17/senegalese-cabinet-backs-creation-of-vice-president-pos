Senegalese President Abdoulaye Wade
and his cabinet backed a modification to the constitution
yesterday that would create the post of vice president,
according to the e-mailed minutes of the meeting.  Ministers agreed the vice president would be elected
separately during presidential elections, the minutes showed.  At present, Senate President Pape Diop would replace Wade
if the 85-year-old leader died. Wade,  Africa ’s oldest head of
state after Zimbabwe’s  Robert Mugabe , has been criticized by
opposition leaders for seeking a third term in office in
elections in February. Senegal’s current constitution limits
presidents to two five-year-terms.  To contact the reporter on this story:
