Palm oil  declined to the lowest
level in six weeks on speculation that inventories in  Malaysia ,
the second-largest grower, may expand from the highest level in
16 months as production accelerates.  The September-delivery contract declined as much as 0.8
percent to 3,169 ringgit ($1,034) a metric ton on the Malaysia
Derivatives Exchange, the lowest level since May 6, and was at
3,172 ringgit at 3:56 p.m. in Kuala Lumpur. Futures have lost
2.1 percent this week, set for a third weekly drop.  “Stockpiles could exceed 2 million tons, especially if we
have the similar kind of statistics that May had -- strong
production and sort of sluggish exports,” Arhnue Tan, senior
investment analyst at ECM Libra Capital Sdn, said by phone from
 Kuala Lumpur . “The high-production season is only in the third
quarter but it seems to be recovering pretty swiftly.”  Output of the cooking oil in Malaysia expanded 13.7 percent
to 1.74 million tons last month, the highest level in 19 months
while stockpiles surged 14.8 percent to 1.92 million tons, the
highest level since January 2010, the nation’s palm oil board
said on June 10. Shipments gained 4.3 percent to 1.4 million
tons, less than the 8.9 percent increase in April, it said.  Palm oil prices have shed 20 percent from a 35-month high
of 3,967 ringgit a ton on Feb. 10 on prospects for increased
supplies from Indonesia and Malaysia, the largest producers, due
to favorable weather.  Palm oil also dropped on “improving soybean-supply
prospects,” Tan said. Soybeans fell to a four-week low
yesterday and corn slumped to the lowest price since March on
speculation that warm weather during the next two weeks will aid
U.S. crops while a stronger dollar cuts investment demand.  November-delivery soybeans declined as much as 0.7 percent
to $13.41 per bushel in  Chicago , extending yesterday’s 1.2
percent loss.  Soybean oil  for December delivery slid as much as
0.8 percent to 57.18 cents a pound.  January-delivery palm oil on the  Dalian Commodity Exchange 
dropped 0.6 percent to close at 9,046 yuan ($1,397) a ton.
Soybean oil for delivery in the same month fell 0.5 percent to
10,168 yuan a ton.  To contact the reporter on this story:
