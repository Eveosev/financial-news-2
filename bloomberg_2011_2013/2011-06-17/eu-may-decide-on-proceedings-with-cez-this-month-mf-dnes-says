The European Commission may decide
on administrative proceedings against  CEZ AS (CEZ)  by the end of this
month,  Mlada Fronta Dnes  reported, citing unnamed people
familiar with the matter.  The commission declined to comment about the timing adding
that it will publish a press release when the decision is made,
the newspaper cited Maria Madrid  Pina, a press officer for the
regulator, as saying.  European Union officials raided the offices of CEZ, the
largest Czech utility, and other Czech companies in November
2009, searching for evidence that CEZ may have unlawfully
excluded competitors and raised wholesale electricity prices.  To contact the reporter on this story:
