U.S. oil supplies rose to the
highest level in 31 years for the month of May as refineries
processed less crude amid a decline in gasoline demand,
according to the  American Petroleum Institute .  Inventories increased for a fifth consecutive month to
367.6 million barrels, a record for May in data going back to
1980, the industry-funded group said today in a report. Supplies
were up 0.7 percent from April and 2.6 percent from a year
earlier. Refineries processed 4.8 percent less crude than during
the same month last year, at 14.7 million barrels a day.  “Consumers of gasoline may have been adjusting to higher
prices by increasing use of public transportation, more
telecommuting, more purchases of fuel efficient vehicles and
cutting down on discretionary travel,”  John Felmy , chief
economist with the Washington-based API, said in a statement.  Demand for gasoline declined 0.7 percent from May 2010 to
9.16 million barrels a day, a two-year low. Gasoline pump prices
averaged 37 percent higher in May from the same month last year
and were up 2.5 percent from April, according to AAA data
compiled by Bloomberg.  Gasoline production was 2 percent higher than in May 2010
at 9.37 million barrels a day, a record for any May and the
highest level this year.  Total U.S. fuel demand rose in May amid demand for
distillate fuel, including heating oil and diesel. Deliveries of
petroleum products, a measure of consumption, climbed 3.6
percent to 22 million barrels a day.  Distillate Demand  Demand for distillate fuel rose 7 percent to 3.89 million
barrels a day. Consumption of ultra-low sulfur diesel, the type
used on highways, climbed 25 percent to average 3.39 million
barrels a day, the report showed. Heating-oil use slipped 5.4
percent to 398,000 barrels a day.  Jet-fuel use fell 7.3 percent to an average 1.32 million
barrels a day last month compared with the same period in 2010.  U.S. crude-oil production slipped 1.6 percent to an average
5.4 million barrels a day. Output in the lower 48 states dropped
2.7 percent to 4.77 million barrels a day. Alaskan production
increased 8.1 percent to 615,000 barrels a day.  To contact the reporter on this story:
