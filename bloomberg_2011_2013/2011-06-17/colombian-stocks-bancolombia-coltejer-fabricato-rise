The following companies had unusual

2.4 percent to 29,800 pesos, the highest since December 2010.
The lender was raised to “hold” from “sell” yesterday by
Interbolsa SA. Interbolsa raised its year-end target price 26
percent to 32,550 pesos on the outlook for loan growth,  interest
rates  and borrowers’ creditworthiness, according to an e-mailed
statement from Colombia’s biggest brokerage.  Coltejer SA (COLTEJ)  , a Colombian clothing maker and
exporter, jumped the most in almost three years on optimism the
U.S. Congress will pass a free-trade agreement with the South
American country. The stock jumped 12 percent to 95 centavos,
the biggest increase for the Medellin-based company since July
2008.  White House Chief of Staff  William Daley  said a consensus
has emerged in Congress for renewing aid for workers who lose
jobs to global competition and passing free-trade agreements
before the August recess.  Fabricato SA (FABRI CB), Colombia’s largest textile maker,
gained 2.5 percent to 61.5 pesos after Daley’s comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
