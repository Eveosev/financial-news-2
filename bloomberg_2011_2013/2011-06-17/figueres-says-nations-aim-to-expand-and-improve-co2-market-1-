Countries participating in United
Nations-sponsored carbon trading want to expand and improve the
market rather than “kill” it, according to the executive
secretary of the UN Framework Convention on  Climate Change .  “There is discussion as to whether we will keep the CDM as
is, and how it will operate with other mechanisms,”  Christiana Figueres  said today in Bonn. “There’s no discussion about
killing the market.”  Delegates from almost 200 countries have been meeting in
Germany this week to advance negotiations on a global climate
treaty to succeed the  Kyoto Protocol , whose commitments expire
in 2012. Among the issues under negotiation is the future of the
Clean Development Mechanism, a system under which emissions-
reducing projects in developing countries earn credits which can
be sold to developed countries.  “The CDM is a market that stems from a political
agreement,” Figueres said. “It’s understandable that when the
future of that climate agreement is being discussed, there’s a
lull in the market.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
