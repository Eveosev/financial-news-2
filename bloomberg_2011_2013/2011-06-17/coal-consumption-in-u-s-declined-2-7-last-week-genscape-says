Coal consumption in the U.S.
declined 2.7 percent in the week ended yesterday from the
previous seven-day period, driven by a drop in the East,
according to  Genscape Inc.   Eastern power-plant use fell 3.4 percent while demand in
the West gained 1 percent, the data provider said. Overall coal
demand was down 8.8 percent from a year earlier.  Genscape says it monitors coal use in real time at U.S.
power producers with a device installed at the plants. The
company uses different models to reach its consumption figures,
making it possible for regional data to conflict with national
totals.  The U.S., which holds the worldâ€™s largest reserves of coal,
relies on the fuel for about 47 percent of power generation,
compared with about 30 percent for natural gas.  To contact the reporter on this story:
