Blackstone Group LP (BX) , the world’s
largest private-equity firm, may co-invest in a new fund being
set up by Russian President  Dmitry Medvedev , chairman and chief
executive  Stephen Schwarzman  said.  “I think we have an open mind in terms of looking at that
vehicle,” Schwarzman said in an interview at the St. Petersburg
International Economic Forum today. Blackstone has yet to invest
in Russia.  Medvedev is promoting the fund as a way to spur foreign
investment into Russia, diversifying the economy away from a
reliance on revenue from oil, gas and metal exports.
Representatives from Blackstone,  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) , Abu
Dhabi Investment Authority, and others from the U.S., Europe,
Asia and the Middle East, came to  Russia  to discuss the fund in
May.  “In this type of market, a good local partner is
essential,” Schwarzman said. He declined to say whether
Blackstone is talking to Russian companies. Private-equity rival
TPG Capital has invested with VTB Capital, the investment-
banking arm of Russia’s second-biggest lender, in a local
supermarket chain.  It is “more logical” for companies to invest in the
consumer sector because risks associated with commodities
industries are “relatively high,” he said.  Should Blackstone decide to invest in Russia, Schwarzman
said the allocation would come from an existing fund rather than
a new country fund.  Blackstone won’t participate in a share sale by OAO
Sberbank, Russia’s biggest lender, later this year, he said.
