Japan ’s bond futures rose to a six-
month high as concern  Greece  will struggle to avoid default
boosted demand for the safety of the Asian nation’s debt.  Bonds gained for a second day after  Jean-Claude Juncker ,
head of the euro-region finance ministers group, said a “hard
haircut” for investors in Greek securities would risk contagion
to other European countries. Bonds also advanced as Asian stocks
fell and before a report that economists said will show U.S.
consumer confidence fell this month, adding to signs the world’s
largest economy is losing momentum.  “People in Greece may not approve austerity measures
required by the international community, and we don’t see how
the situation will be resolved,” said  Satoshi Yamada , who helps
oversee about $12.7 billion as manager of fixed-income trading
at Okasan Asset Management Co. in  Tokyo . “When risk factors
rise, bonds in Germany, the U.S. and Japan get bought.”  Ten-year bond futures for September delivery gained 0.10 to
141.17 as of the afternoon close at the Tokyo Stock Exchange.
The contracts earlier touched 141.33, the highest since Dec. 7.
They were up from 140.90 on June 10.  The yield on the 1.2 percent bond due June 2021 was
unchanged at 1.12 percent as of 3:18 p.m. at Japan Bond Trading
Co., the nation’s largest interdealer debt broker. The price was
100.719 yen. Five-year yields dropped one and a half basis
points to 0.415 percent. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index of shares slid 0.5 percent, and
the  Nikkei 225 (NKY)  Stock Average fell 0.6 percent.  The Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan final index of
consumer sentiment dropped to 74 this month from 74.3 in May,
according to the median estimate of economists in a Bloomberg
News survey before today’s data.  To contact the reporter on this story:
