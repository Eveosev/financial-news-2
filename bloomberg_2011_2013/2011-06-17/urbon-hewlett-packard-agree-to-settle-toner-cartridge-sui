Turbon AG (TUR)  and Hewlett-Packard Co.
agreed to settle a lawsuit filed by a Turbon unit last year
accusing the world’s largest maker of personal computers of
stealing trade secrets for remanufactured toner cartridges.  Turbon International, based in Cinnaminson,  New Jersey , and
Palo Alto, California-based Hewlett-Packard said in a document
filed in federal court in Manhattan today that they reached a
settlement to dismiss the claims.  Turbon, which makes toner cartridges, filed the lawsuit in
June 2010, accusing Hewlett-Packard of inducing it to disclose
details of its business with promise of a supply contract. The
suit sought a court order barring HP from using the company’s
secrets.  The case is Turbon International Inc. v.  Hewlett-Packard
Co. (HPQ) , 10-cv-04540, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New
York (Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
