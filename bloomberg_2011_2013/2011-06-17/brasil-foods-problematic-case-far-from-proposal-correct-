(Corrects to show only one member voted against the deal in
first paragraph of story originally published June 16.)  BRF - Brasil Foods SA (BRFS3)  hasn’t made
any formal proposal yet to win approval for its $3.8 billion
takeover of Sadia SA after an antitrust commissioner said the
deal should be blocked, said Olavo Chinaglia, one of the five
members of the competition regulator, known as Cade.  The Sao Paulo-based company this week presented guidelines
for a possible agreement that are “far from” a proposal,
Chinaglia said today in an interview in  Rio de Janeiro . Chief
Executive Officer Jose Antonio do Prado Fay earlier this week
requested more time to make a offer to the antitrust agency,
which yesterday agreed to postpone its ruling on the deal.  “I have no doubt this is a problematic case,” Chinaglia
said on the sidelines of an event. The company “spoke in
general terms, far from a proposal,” he said.  Brasil Foods , which became the world’s biggest poultry
exporter after bailing out rival Sadia two years ago, wields too
much pricing power and holds a 90 percent share in some markets
in the South American country, commissioner Carlos Ragazzo said
last week. Yesterday’s postponement prompted investors to bet
Brasil Foods may be able to avoid an outright rejection, pushing
the shares up the most in five months.  The stock rose 19 centavos, or 0.8 percent, to 24.72 reais
as of 1:13 p.m. in Sao Paulo trading, after earlier gaining as
much as 1.5 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
