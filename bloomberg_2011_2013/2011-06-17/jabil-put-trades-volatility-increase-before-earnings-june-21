Jabil Circuit Inc. (JBL)  put-options
trades rose to 4.9 times the four-week average and the shares
fell as  Research In Motion Ltd. (RIM) , one of its biggest customers,
plunged after its profit and revenue forecasts missed estimates.  More than 8,300 puts to sell the electronics manufacturer
changed hands as of 4 p.m. in New York, 2.9 times the number of
calls to buy, as the shares slumped 1.7 percent to $18.29.
Implied volatility, the key gauge of option prices, for at-the-
money options expiring next month rose to 52.15, the highest
since March.  Jabil, which reports earnings on June 21, fell after RIM
said revenue may miss analysts’ estimates as it loses market
share to rival Apple Inc. The BlackBerry smartphone maker
contributed 15 percent of  St. Petersburg , Florida-based Jabil’s
revenue in the fiscal year ended Aug. 31, according to a
regulatory filing in October.  “I’m not surprised at the volume considering what RIM has
done today,” said Brett Marcus, an options trader at Needham &
Co. in New York. “People are very cautious of earnings next
week that might have exposure to RIM.”  RIM tumbled 21 percent to $27.75 in U.S. trading, the
lowest close since September 2006. The company, which had lost
39 percent this year before today, said quarterly revenue may
drop for the first time in nine years and that profit this
quarter will be 75 cents to $1.05 a share. Analysts had
predicted $1.40.  Put volume for Waterloo, Ontario-based RIM soared today to
461,208 contracts, 7.4 times average. June $27.50 puts, which
expired at today’s close of U.S. options markets, were the most-
active contracts. Investors who bought June $30 puts before
today reaped the biggest gains among RIM contracts as those
options rose 676 percent to $2.25 for the largest advance.  RIM and Cisco Systems Inc., the world’s largest maker of
computer-networking equipment, are Jabil’s two largest
customers. Cisco also accounted for 15 percent of net revenue in
the last fiscal year, according to the filing.  To contact the reporters on this story:
