Nigeria  said it will take over
operator rights at each of the four licenses in which  Royal
Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA)  is selling its interests.  State-owned  Nigerian National Petroleum Corp.  will operate
the licenses, said  Levi Ajuonuma , a company spokesman, through
its Nigerian Petroleum Development Co. unit.  “The operatorship is not part of the sale,” Ajuonuma said
today by phone from Abuja, the capital. “That’s why we put the
caveat emptor to warn those who think they will come in and be
the operators.”  SacOil Holdings Ltd., the South African explorer that
failed to win a joint bid for Shell’s interest in the OML 42
license, said last week that Nigeria’s decision to take over the
operatorships added an extra risk for investors.  “Clearly that raises issues for the buyers because you are
not in control of the asset,” SacOil’s Chief Executive Officer
Robin Vela said June 17 in an interview in  London . “It adds
another layer of risk to the transaction.”  Kulczyk Oil Ventures Inc. (KOV)  said last month it won the bid
for OML 42 with a local partner and will acquire the 45 percent
interest held jointly by Shell,  Total SA (FP)  and a unit of  Eni SpA. (ENI) 
NNPC holds the remaining 55 percent.  In addition to OML 42, Shell is also selling its interests
in the OML 30, 34 and 40 licenses in which it holds a 30 percent
stake and NNPC owns 55 percent. Total SA has a 10 percent stake
and Eni SpA holds 5 percent.  Nigeria is Africa’s biggest oil producer and the fifth-
biggest source of U.S. oil imports.  To contact the reporter on this story:
