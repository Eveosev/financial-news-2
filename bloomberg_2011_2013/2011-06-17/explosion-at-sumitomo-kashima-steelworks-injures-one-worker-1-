A boiler exploded at  Sumitomo Metal
Industries Ltd. (5405) ’s largest steel factory, north of  Tokyo ,
injuring one worker.  The explosion at Kashima steelworks in Ibaraki prefecture
occurred at 1:46 p.m. today, Reiko Ishihara, a spokeswoman for
the Japanese company, said today by phone. The cause of the
accident is being investigated, she said.  The boiler is not used often and the explosion won’t affect
operations at the plant, Ishihara said. Kashima produces more
than half of the company’s crude steel.  Ibaraki police confirmed a Kyodo news report earlier today
on the explosion.  To contact the reporter on this story:
