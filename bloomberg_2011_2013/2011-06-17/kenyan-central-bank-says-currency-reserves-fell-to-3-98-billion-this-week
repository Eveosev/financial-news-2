Kenya ’s foreign-exchange reserves
fell to $3.98 billion this week from $4 billion last week, the
Central Bank of Kenya said in its weekly bulletin.  Commercial lenders borrowed 56.4 billion shillings from the
central bank’s overnight window in the week to June 15, compared
with 30 billion shillings last week, “reflecting tight
liquidity conditions in the money market,” the Nairobi-based
bank said in an e-mailed statement today.  The average  interbank rate  in the period was 6.22 percent
compared with 5.98 percent last week, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
