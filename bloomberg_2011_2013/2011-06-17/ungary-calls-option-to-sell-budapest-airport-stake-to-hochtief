Hungary  called an option to sell the
state’s remaining 25 percent stake in Budapest Airport to
 Germany ’s  Hochtief AG (HOT) , which leads a group that owns the rest of
the shares, the National Development Ministry said.  The price of the shares on June 15 when the State Asset
Management company called the option was 36.6 billion forint
($195 million), the ministry said in an e-mailed statement
today. An asset-value assessment process put the value of the
stake at 31.8 billion forint.  The ministry last week said the government planned to sell
the stake by the June 18 deadline set when the majority of the
equity was sold in 2005. U.K.-based BAA Plc paid Hungary 465
billion forint for the majority stake in 2005. The shares were
then sold to the Hochtief-led consortium in May 2007 for $2.6
billion.  Hochtief’s Hungarian unit owns 37.7 percent of the airport.  To contact the reporter on this story:
