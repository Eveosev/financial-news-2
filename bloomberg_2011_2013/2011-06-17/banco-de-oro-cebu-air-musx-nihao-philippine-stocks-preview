Shares of the following companies
had unusual moves in Philippine trading. Stock symbols are in
parentheses and prices are as of the noon close in  Manila .  The Philippine Stock Exchange Index fell 0.5 percent to
4,153.11, a 1.6 percent weekly loss.  Banks:  Banco de Oro Unibank Inc. (BDO)  , the nation’s
largest bank by assets, sank 5.7 percent to 51.80 pesos, the
sharpest loss since April 1, 2009, after the central bank raised
the amount of cash that banks must set aside as reserves.  Bank
of the Philippine Islands (BPI)  , the third-biggest, fell 2.8
percent to 53.95 pesos, the lowest level since March 25.  The Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas raised the reserve
requirement ratio for banks to 20 percent from 19 percent
effective June 24, it said in a statement yesterday. The
increase will drain 38 billion pesos ($873 million) of funds
from the system, Deputy Governor Diwa Guinigundo said.  Consumer-related stocks:  Universal Robina Corp. (URC)  ,
the nation’s largest maker of snackfoods and bottled ice tea,
climbed 1.1 percent to 40.25 pesos, rebounding from yesterday’s
4.1 percent slump, on expectations costs will go down after the
central bank paused on raising  interest rates  and Governor
Amando Tetangco said inflation is slowing.  Alliance Global Group
Inc. (AGI)  , a producer of alcoholic drinks and owner of the
local franchise holder of McDonald’s Corp., gained 2.4 percent
to 10.34 pesos, the highest level since June 2.  “The move to put off rate increases and the outlook on
inflation suggests to investors the threat of rising costs is
beginning to wane,” said Alex Pomento, Manila-based strategist
at Macquarie Group Ltd. “Some investors are making a bet that
this might be a good time to return to consumer-related
stocks.”  Electricity Producers:  Aboitiz Power Corp. (AP)  , which
owns electricity plants and retailers, surged 5.7 percent to
31.55 pesos, the sharpest gain since Jan. 14, after the nation’s
regulator said large consumers of electricity will be allowed to
choose their own suppliers by the end of the year.  First Gen
Corp. (FGEN)  , owner of the nation’s largest producer of
geothermal power, climbed for a third day, adding 0.2 percent to
13.80 pesos.  Cebu Air Inc. (CEB)  , the largest Philippine budget
carrier, rallied for a third day, soaring 5.5 percent to 91.65
pesos, its sharpest gain since May 2. The airline ordered 37
Airbus SAS A320-family planes for $3.8 billion, the biggest for
a Philippine carrier.  JG Summit Holdings Inc. (JGS)  , Cebu
