A gauge of Indian technology stocks
fell, on course for its lowest close in nine months, amid
concerns global growth is slowing and after  Research In Motion
Ltd. (RIMM)  said quarterly revenue may drop for the first time in nine
years.  The 10-member Bombay Stock Exchange IT Index dropped 2
percent to 5,815.53 at 2:08 p.m. in Mumbai, headed for its
lowest close since Sept. 16. That’s the steepest drop among the
13 industry groups on the bourse.  Tata Consultancy Services Ltd. (TCS) , India’s largest software
services provider, slumped 2.7 percent to 1,120 rupees while
 Infosys Technologies Ltd. (INFO) , the second-largest software services
provider, lost 1.8 percent to 2,749.9 rupees, falling for a
fourth day. Wipro Ltd., the third-biggest, dropped 1.3 percent
to 410.65 rupees. The top three software services companies get
more than 75 percent of their sales from outside  India .  “It is a sentimental impact to the comments made by RIM
and the broader concerns surrounding the global economic
recovery,” said Rohit Maheshwari, an analyst at Mumbai-based
brokerage K.R. Choksey Shares & Securities Pvt. “The overall
mood in the domestic markets is pessimistic and that is adding
to the selloff in software stocks.”  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index dropped 0.5 percent, with
technology stocks sliding the most among 10 industry groups on
the gauge after Research In Motion, whose BlackBerry phones are
losing sales to Apple Inc.’s iPhone, said quarterly revenue may
be $4.2 billion to $4.8 billion and unveiled plans to reduce
jobs.  The Bombay Stock Exchange Sensitive Index, or Sensex, slid
0.7 percent to 17,856.44, set for a second weekly decline, amid
concern that a possible sovereign-debt default by  Greece  will
derail the global economic recovery.  To contact the reporter on this story:
