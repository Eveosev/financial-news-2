A Danish proposal to ban the use of
carbon credits linked to hydrofluorocarbon-23 to meet climate
goals gained support from almost half the 27-member European
Union, according to the  Environmental Investigation Agency .  Germany ,  France  and the U.K. are among 11 nations that
officially support the proposal to ban EU countries from using
HFC-23-linked Certified Emission Reduction credits to comply
with emissions limits under the  Kyoto Protocol , according to an
e-mail from EIA and Bonn-based CDM-Watch, two non-governmental
groups that monitor policies around HFC-23 related credits.  Under the Kyoto Protocol, developed countries may buy
Certified Emission Reductions from poorer nations to help meet
their emission reduction targets for the period 2008 to 2012.  The European Commission, regulator of the bloc’s cap-and-
trade program, banned the use of the HFC-23-linked CERs in its
own emissions trading system, saying they offered “exorbitant”
profits. HFC-23 is a greenhouse gas nearly 12,000 times more
potent than carbon-dioxide. It’s produced via industrial
processes.  Spain and  Italy  didn’t answer CDM-Watch’s request for
information, according to the e-mail.  “Spain and Italy have a financial stake in those
contracts, there’s nothing in the proposal that would prevent
them from using those,” said Samuel LaBudde, senior atmospheric
campaigner at EIA. “The only reason to oppose the proposal is
that they have an expectation to renew the contracts. They want
to keep options open.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
