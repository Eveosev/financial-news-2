Copper climbed for the first time in
three days on optimism that  China ’s demand is improving,
tempering concern about  Europe ’s fiscal crisis.  The metal for three-month delivery on the London Metal
Exchange rose as much as 0.5 percent to $9,105.50 a metric ton,
and last traded at $9,105 by 8:04 a.m. Singapore time. It is up
1.9 percent this week, set for its first weekly advance in three
weeks.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
