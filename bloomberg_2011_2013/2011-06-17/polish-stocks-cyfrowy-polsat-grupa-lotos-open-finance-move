Poland ’s WIG20 Index gained 16.32,
or 0.6 percent, to close at 2,880.13, the first advance in three
days. The measure increased 1 percent this week.  The following are among the most active stocks on the
 Warsaw Stock Exchange  today. Stock symbols follow company names.  Cyfrowy Polsat SA (CPS)   fell for a third day, retreating
0.3 zloty, or 1.9 percent, to 15.8 zloty. Polish billionaire

country’s second-biggest television group to raise money for
investments in the telecommunication business, the company said
in a regulatory statement.  Grupa Lotos SA (LTS)   rose for the first time in three
days, adding 0.91 zloty, or 2 percent, to 47.48 zloty as

“accumulate” from “hold” at Erste Group Bank AG.  Open Finance SA (OPF PW) jumped 0.8 zloty, or 4.6 percent,
to 18.1 zloty, gaining the most since it started trading, as

Czarnecki, setting its price estimate for the stock at 22.8
zloty in new coverage.  To contact the reporter on this story:
