College football teams will play 35
games in 24 days this bowl season, according to the  schedule 
released by the Football Bowl Association.  The bowl season starts Dec. 17 with the New Mexico,
Humanitarian and  New Orleans  bowls, and concludes Jan. 9 with
the BCS  national championship  game in New Orleans.  Walt Disney Co. (DIS) ’s ESPN will show 31 games, including the
national championship contest. Disney’s ABC will pick up the
Liberty Bowl on New Year’s Eve and the Outback Bowl on Jan. 2.  No bowls will be played on Jan. 1, because it falls on a
Sunday and conflicts with the National Football League schedule.
The  Rose Bowl  is scheduled for Jan. 2, followed by the Sugar
Bowl Jan. 3, Orange Bowl Jan. 4 and Fiesta Bowl Jan. 5.  To contact the reporter on this story:
