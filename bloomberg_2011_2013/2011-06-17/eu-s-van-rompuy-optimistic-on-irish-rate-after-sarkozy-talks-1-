European Union President  Herman Van Rompuy  said he discussed Ireland’s request to lower the interest
rate it pays on aid loans with French President  Nicolas Sarkozy 
and came away more optimistic of reaching a solution.  ““I met President Sarkozy last Wednesday in Paris at the
Elysee Palace and we discussed this issue,” Van Rompuy told
reporters in Dublin today after talks with Irish Prime Minister
Enda Kenny. “I left Paris more positive than I entered Paris on
this particular” matter.  Ireland secured an international bailout package last year
after concerns about the cost of saving its banks and financing
the  budget deficit  locked the country out of credit markets. The
government has failed to negotiate a reduction on the 5.8
percent interest rate on its aid loans amid French demands that
the country raise its corporate-tax rate, a move Irish Finance
Minister  Michael Noonan  has ruled out.  “There are real possibilities of getting an outcome of
this issue,” Van Rompuy said. Earlier in the day, he said he’s
“fully aware this is a sensitive issue for Ireland.”  Ireland is on its way to restoring confidence in its
economy, Van Rompuy said.  “What you are doing is needed not only for your country
but for the stability of the euro area as a whole,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
