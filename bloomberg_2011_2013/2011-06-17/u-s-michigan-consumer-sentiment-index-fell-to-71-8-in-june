The Thomson Reuters/University of
Michigan preliminary index of consumer sentiment in the U.S.
fell to 71.8 in June from 74.3 a month earlier.  The gauge was projected to slip to 74, according to the
median estimate of 67 economists in a Bloomberg News survey.
Estimates ranged from 70 to 78.5. The index averaged 89 in the
five years leading up to the recession that began in December
2007.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
