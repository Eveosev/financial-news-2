NBNK Investments Plc (NBNK)  Chief Executive
Officer Gary Hoffman said the company, which intends to bid for
the 630 branches  Lloyds Banking Group Plc (LLOY)  is obliged to divest,
will only consider making an offer for Northern Rock Plc if it
wins the Lloyds auction, the Financial Times reported, citing an
interview.  “If it gets to a point where we’re allowed to look at
Northern Rock we would,” Hoffman said. “But on its own it is
not large enough for the ambitions we have,” Hoffman said, the
FT reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
