Bondholders participating in a
European effort to reduce Greek debt must be given assurances
that the country will be stabilized and that any debt rollover
be done at a “high quality standard,” Michael Kemmer, general
manager of the Association of German Banks, told  Tagesspiegel  in
an interview.  Bondholders “want to do their part to ease the crisis,”
the Berlin-based newspaper quoted Kemmer as saying in an e-
mailed preview of an interview to be published tomorrow.  To contact the reporter on this story:
