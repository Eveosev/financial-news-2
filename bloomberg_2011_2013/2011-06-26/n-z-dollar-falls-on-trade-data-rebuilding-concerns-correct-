(Corrects low for Australian dollar in fourth paragraph)  New Zealand ’s dollar fell for a
third day after a government report showed the nation’s trade
surplus in May was lower than economists forecast.  Australia ’s
currency also declined.  The so-called kiwi also weakened against all 16 of its
major peers amid concern rebuilding in earthquake-hit
Christchurch will be delayed, damping an economic recovery.
Australia’s dollar traded 0.2 percent from a one-month low
against the U.S. currency as Greek lawmakers vote this week on
an austerity plan that must pass for the cash-strapped nation to
secure more international aid. Equity and commodity markets
slumped last week amid concern over  Europe ’s debt crisis.  “The kiwi has come off on the back of the lower-than-
expected trade data,” said Khoon Goh, head of market economics
and strategy at ANZ National Bank Ltd. in Wellington. “This
whole sovereign-debt crisis will continue to linger for a while
and in the commodity currency space, commodity prices are
soft.”  New Zealand’s dollar fell to 80.33 U.S. cents as of 9:17
a.m. in Sydney from 81.18 cents in  New York  on June 24, and
earlier touched 80.20 cents, the weakest since June 17. It
declined 1.1 percent to 64.63 yen. Australia’s dollar fell 0.2
percent to $1.0474 and fetched 84.26 yen from 84.37 yen. The so-
called Aussie fell to as low as $1.0455 on June 23.  New Zealand’s trade surplus was NZ$605 million ($486
million) in May, the government statistics office said in
Wellington, compared with the median estimate in a Bloomberg
News survey for a NZ$1 billion surplus.  To contact the reporter on this story:
