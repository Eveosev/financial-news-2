The  Bank for International
Settlements  held 409 metric tons of bullion related to gold
swaps contracts as of March 31, up 18 percent from a year
earlier.  The BIS held 346 tons of gold in connection with swap
operations through March 31 last year, the Basel, Switzerland-
based bank said in its annual report today. Under swap
contracts, the bank exchanges currencies for physical gold,
which it must return at the end of the contract.  The bankâ€™s gold investment assets stood at 119 tons, down
from 120 tons a year earlier, it said.  Emerging market countries continue to be the most
vulnerable to inflation, as economic recovery and supply
disruptions drive food and commodity prices higher, BIS said.
Advanced economies may be affected by inflation via global
supply chains as producers in emerging markets pass on higher
labor costs to consumers, the bank said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
