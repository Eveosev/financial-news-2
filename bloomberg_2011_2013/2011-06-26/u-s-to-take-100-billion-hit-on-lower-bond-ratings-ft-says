The U.S. bond market would take a
“hit” with losses of as much as $100 billion if the
government’s Aaa credit rating is downgraded, the Financial
Times reported, citing a research arm of  Standard & Poor’s .  The higher yields and lower prices of such a downgrade
would force the Treasury to pay $2.3 billion to $3.75 billion
more a year in interest, the FT said, citing analysts at S&P
Valuation and Risk Strategies, a research team separate from the
ratings company, a unit of McGraw-Hill.  Ratings reductions to AA or A would lead to declines of 2
percent and 3.2 percent, respectively, in the price of the 10-
year Treasury note, sending yields higher, the analysis
indicates. The 30-year bond’s price would fall 3.9 percent and
6.3 percent under those scenarios, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
