Lloyds Banking Group Plc (LLOY)  shouldn’t
have to sell more branches as suggested by the Independent
Commission on Banking, the  Sunday Telegraph  reported, citing the
lender’s former Chairman, Victor Blank.  Making it easier for consumers to change account-providers
is the key to improving competition, the London-based newspaper
said, citing Blank.  There is currently enough competition to allow consumers to
get “sensible competitive offers” from banks other than
Lloyds, he said, according to the Sunday Telegraph.  To contact the reporter on this story:
