As many as six Mauritanian soldiers
were injured in an attack on an al-Qaeda camp in neighboring
 Mali  last week as the African nations step-up their fight
against crime and terrorism in the region, according to the
Ministry of Defense of Mali.  “Heavy gunfire between the bandits and the armed forces
wounded five or six soldiers within the Mauritanian army,” said
Nouhoum Togo, spokesman for Mali’s Ministry of Defense, in a
phone interview today.  The injured soldiers, part of a joint operation by Mali and
 Mauritania , were flown to safety in helicopters belonging to
Mali’s military, he said.  Mali, Algeria, Mauritania and Niger have set up a joint
force to secure their shared Sahara-Sahel desert zone and
jointly fight terrorism in the region, the countries said in a
statement in May.  To contact the reporter on this story:
