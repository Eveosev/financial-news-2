Yemen’s government said it will give
3 million rials ($10,000) to anyone with information on members
of the Joint Meeting Parties, a six-party opposition coalition,
it alleges were involved in the bombing of oil pipelines and
destruction of electricity stations, state-run  Saba reported.   Mohammed Qahtan, a spokesman for the JMP, dismissed the
accusations as “groundless” and “nonsense” and said the
interior ministry is no longer legitimate given the country’s
changing political landscape. Protesters have taken to the
streets of Yemeni cities for four months to call for the removal
of President Ali Abdullah Saleh.  The interior ministry said 43 members of the opposition are
accused of attacks on pipelines in the Ma’rib province, which
caused power and fuel shortages across the country, according to
Saba.  To contact the reporter on this story:
