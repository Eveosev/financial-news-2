New York Yankees’ left-hander C.C. Sabathia became the first Major League Baseball pitcher to win
10 games this season, in yesterday’s 8-3 victory over the
 Colorado Rockies .  Sabathia (10-4) allowed seven hits and one run in eight
innings while striking out nine in the interleague game at
Yankee Stadium.  “I wish I could say it meant something, but it don’t,”
Sabathia told reporters. “We’re here to win championships.
That’s what we’re trying to do.”  Sabathia was one of 12 pitchers vying yesterday to be the
first to reach 10 wins.  To contact the reporter on this story:
