Dubai shares retreated to the lowest
level in three months as Europe’s sovereign debt crisis weighed
on the global economy and the  International Energy Agency  said
it may release more oil to stabilize prices.  Emaar Properties PJSC (EMAAR) , the builder of the world’s tallest
skyscraper in Dubai, tumbled to the lowest in a month.  Drake &
Scull International (DSI) , a construction company, fell the most since
May. The benchmark  DFM General Index (DFMGI)  slipped 1.1 percent to
1,521.15, the lowest since March 22, at the 2 p.m. close. The
 Bloomberg GCC 200 Index (BGCC200) , which tracks the top 200 companies in
the  Persian Gulf , rose 0.5 percent.  Concern Greek lawmakers will fail to pass austerity
measures to ensure the next installment of the nation’s
international bailout helped push down European stocks last
week, while U.S. equities posted their seventh loss in eight
weeks as the  Federal Reserve  cut its growth forecast. Oil
tumbled 4.6 percent on June 23 after the IAE’s decision to
release 60 million barrels over 30 days.  “The market is affected by international volatility, lower
 oil prices ,” said Tariq Qaqish, director and fund manager at Al
Mal Capital PSC in Dubai. The United Arab Emirates and Qatar not
being upgraded to emerging market at index provider MSCI Inc.
also hurt investor sentiment, he said.  MSCI Delay  MSCI, whose stock indexes are tracked by investors with
about $3 trillion in assets, kept the U.A.E. and Qatar as
frontier markets on June 21, citing the need for more time for
market-participant feedback. Introduction of delivery-versus-
payment, a program for completing stock transactions, may help
lift the nations from their rankings in December. Qatar’s  QE
Index (DSM)  declined 0.1 percent.  Crude has tumbled 11 percent this month to close at $91.16
a barrel in New York on June 24. The six nations of the Gulf
Cooperation Council supply about a fifth of the world’s oil.  Emaar fell 2 percent to 3.02 dirhams, the lowest since May
25. Drake & Scull retreated 2.2 percent to 97.2 fils. Each
dirham has 100 fils.  Abu Dhabi’s  ADX General Index (ADSMI)  and Oman’s benchmark stock
index gained 0.1 percent. Saudi Arabia’s  Tadawul All Share Index (SASEIDX) 
increased 0.9 percent. Kuwait’s measure and Bahrain’s gauge lost
less than 0.1 percent. Egypt’s benchmark  EGX 30 Index (EGX30)  dropped
0.8 percent.  In Israel, the TA-25 Index declined 0.8 percent. The
nation’s government bonds rose on expectations the Bank of
 Israel  will hold borrowing costs at 3.25 percent, according to
23 economists surveyed by Bloomberg. The yield on the benchmark
Mimshal Shiklit due January 2020 fell two basis points, or 0.02
percentage point, to 5.08 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
