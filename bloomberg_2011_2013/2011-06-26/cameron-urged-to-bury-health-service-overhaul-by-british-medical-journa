The  British Medical Journal  urged
 David Cameron ’s government to abandon its legislation
overhauling the  National Health Service , “sweep the bill’s
mangled remains into an unmarked grave and move on.”  The journal is published by the British Medical
Association, which represents the interests of doctors. Cameron
and Health Secretary Andrew Lansley have already retreated from
their original proposal to put family practitioners in charge of
most of the NHS budget in the face of resistance from those
working in the health system. The BMJ said today that the
remaining plans lack a rationale.  “The breakneck speed that has characterized the
legislative program since the beginning has been both
unnecessary and counterproductive,” the journal said in an
editorial. “Only a handful of companies in the world exceed the
100 billion-pound ($160 billion) turnover of the English NHS;
none would have embarked on change in this harebrained
fashion.”  Since he became leader of the  Conservative Party  in 2005,
Cameron has made winning public trust on handling of the state-
funded NHS, which offers free care to all, a priority. The
article suggests that he may have to tone down his plans ever
more if he is to win back the support of the medical profession.  To contact the reporter on this story:
