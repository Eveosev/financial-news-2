Tropical storm Meari will hit
 China ’s Liaoning province in the northeastern area bordering
 North Korea  by tomorrow, said the China Meteorological
Administration.  Meari reached Shandong province today with the fastest wind
speeds of 23 meters a second, the weather agency said in a
statement on its  website  today. Heavy rains will hit Shandong,
Liaoning and Jilin provinces in the coming 24 hours, while most
regions in the south will have rain in the coming three days, it
said.  The rains from Meari have relieved a drought in Jiangsu
province, between Shandong and Shanghai, the official Xinhua
News Agency said.  The storms will miss China’s northwestern region, which
has experienced drought since March, Xinhua said yesterday.  As many as of 3.65 million people are short of drinking
water in northwestern China, the National Flood Control and
Drought Relief Headquarters said on June 24. Drinking water
supplies to more than 2 million people have been disrupted by
the drought, Xinhua said, citing provincial authorities.  --Wenxin Fan, Winnie Zhu. Editors: Paul Tighe, Hugh Chow  To contact the Bloomberg News Staff on this story:
