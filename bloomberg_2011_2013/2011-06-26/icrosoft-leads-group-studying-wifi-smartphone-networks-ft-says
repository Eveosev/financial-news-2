Microsoft Corp. (MSFT)  is heading a group
that on June 29 will start a U.K. trial that may lead to new
mobile broadband networks that can support smartphones, the
Financial Times reported, without saying where it got its
information.  The British Broadcasting Corp.,  British Sky Broadcasting
Group Plc (BSY)  and  BT Group Plc (BT/A)  are in the group that will study how
radio spectrum not required for digital terrestrial television
could be used, the FT said. The spectrum could be used for
“super WiFi” urban networks and provide broadband
infrastucture for rural areas, the newspaper said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
