Chevron Corp. will take into account
 Venezuela ’s new oil-price tax when considering investment in
projects in the country, El Universal  reported , citing Ali Moshiri, the company’s president for  Latin America  and Africa.  President Hugo Chavez in April modified Venezuela’s oil tax
laws by swapping out its old system of royalties and instead
charging a levy of 80 percent or 95 percent on revenue above $70
and $100 a barrel.  Chevron will not pull out of existing projects and expects
to begin producing 50,000 barrels a day from its Carabobo fields
in the Orinoco Belt by September 2012, El Universal said, citing
Moshiri. Production in the Carabobo fields may increase by
50,000 to 100,000 barrels every two year once initial production
is started, Moshiri said, according to El Universal.  Oil Minister  Rafael Ramirez  said in May he expected the
Carabobo fields to have 50,000 barrels a day of early production
with joint venture partners this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
