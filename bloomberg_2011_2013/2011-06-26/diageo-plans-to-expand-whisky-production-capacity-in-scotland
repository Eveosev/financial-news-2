Diageo Plc (DGE) , the worldâ€™s biggest
distiller, said it plans to expand its Scotch whisky production
capacity in Speyside, northern Scotland.  The company has submitted an application for a 9.5 million
pound ($15.2 million) upgrade of its  Dailuaine  complex, it said
in an e-mailed statement yesterday.  Diageo, which makes whiskies including  Johnnie Walker  and
J&B, is working on plans to boost production at its existing
distilleries by more than 10 million liters per annum over the
next two to three years, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
