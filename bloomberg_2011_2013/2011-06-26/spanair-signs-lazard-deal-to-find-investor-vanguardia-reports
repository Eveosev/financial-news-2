Spanair SA, a Spanish airline owned
by Catalonian businessmen and in which the regional government
has a stake, signed a deal through which  Lazard Ltd. (LAZ)  will help
the airline find an investor,  La Vanguardia  reported.  Spanair, based in Barcelona, needs 150 million euros ($213
million) to become profitable and operate long-haul flights, the
newspaper said, citing unidentified people close to the deal.  The potential investor could come from  China  or the Middle
East since transactions with other airlines such as  Deutsche
Lufthansa AG (LHA) ,  Singapore Airlines Ltd. (SIA)  and  Turk Hava Yollari (THYAO)  AO,
known as Turkish Airlines, have already been discounted, La
Vanguardia said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
