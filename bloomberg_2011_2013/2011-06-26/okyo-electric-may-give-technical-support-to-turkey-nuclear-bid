Tokyo Electric Power Co. will
consider providing technical support if asked by a Japanese
group including  Toshiba Corp. (6502)  that’s seeking orders to build
four nuclear power reactors for  Turkey ’s government.  “We haven’t make any decision on participating,” said
Yoshinori Mori, a Tepco spokesman. “We’ll consider whether we
can offer technical support if we get such a request.”  Tokyo Electric will probably be replaced by another utility,
the Sankei newspaper reported earlier today, citing a Turkish
government official it didn’t name. Talks between Turkey and the
group have been suspended since the March 11 earthquake, Sankei
said.  Tokyo Electric is reviewing its overseas businesses as it
plans a restructuring, Mori said. The Turkish project isn’t
included in the review as the utility hasn’t made a decision to
participate, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
