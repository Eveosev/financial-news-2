Banks in the besieged rebel-held
city of Misrata in western Libya opened today for the first time
since the February uprising against Libyan leader  Muammar Qaddafi ’s four-decade rule began.  “It’s a good day,” said Hussein Al Jamal, 47, as he
waited for his wife to make a withdrawal at the Alwaha Bank in
central Misrata. “We need the banks to start the economy. With
our banks working, everything will be possible.”  The re-opening was organized by the city council, which
limited cash withdrawals to 300 dinars, worth about $150 on the
local black market, amid concern that larger withdrawals could
trigger inflation in a city still surrounded by pro-Gaddafi
forces. Many teachers, doctors and other state workers have not
been paid their salaries since January.  Long lines formed at daybreak outside banks across the
city, with police supervising those waiting for withdrawals.
“This is the start I hope,” said Al Jamal. “Misrata people
are great traders, we are famous for this.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
