Bank for International Settlements 
General Manager  Jaime Caruana  was paid 70 percent more than
European Central Bank President  Jean-Claude Trichet  last year.  Caruana earned 758,600 Swiss francs ($906,115) “before
expatriation allowances” in 2010, the Basel-based BIS said in
its annual report today. Trichet was paid 367,863 euros
($523,505). The comparison is boosted by the strength of the
franc, which in the past two years has appreciated about 30
percent against the euro and the dollar.  Caruana earned more than four times as much as U.S. Federal
Reserve Chairman  Ben Bernanke , who was paid $199,700 in 2010.
The head of Switzerland’s central bank, Philipp Hildebrand, was
paid 994,800 francs last year.  The BIS, known as the central bank for central banks, holds
currency reserves on behalf of its members and provides policy
makers with a forum for discussion.  To contact the reporter on this story:
