Boubyan Petrochemicals Co. (BPCC)  posted a
7 percent jump in full-year profit as it gained from investment
in a venture of  Dow Chemical Co. (DOW) , said the deputy chairman of
the Kuwait-based investor in plastics and chemical ventures.  Net income for the year ended April 30 increased to 22.8
million dinars ($83 million) from 21.4 million dinars a year
earlier, the company said in a statement today.  "The main reason behind this rise is the growth in  Equate
Petrochemical Co. ’s profitability," Dabbous al-Dabbous said in
an interview. "Equate has forecast profit growth of between 20
percent to 40 percent in 2011 compared with last year."  Equate Petrochemical is a venture between Kuwait’s
Petrochemicals Industries Co. and Dow Chemical. Boubyan holds a
9 percent stake in the venture, al-Dabbous said. The company
also holds a 24 percent stake in  Kuwait ’s al-Kout Industrial
Projects Co. as well as a 60 percent stake in Olayan Arabian
Packaging Co. in  Saudi Arabia .  Boubyan’s shares closed unchanged at 580 fils in Kuwait
today, giving it a market value of 281 million. The stock has
gained 7.4 percent this year, compared with a 10 percent decline
in Kuwait’s benchmark index.  Boubyan is one of 15 companies to be included in a new
index established by Kuwait’s Stock Exchange for companies with
the biggest market value and liquidity, state-run  KUNA  reported
on June 19. "I think that will have a positive impact on the
share price," al-Dabbous said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
