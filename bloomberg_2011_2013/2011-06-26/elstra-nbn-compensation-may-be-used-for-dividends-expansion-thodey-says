Telstra Corp., Australia’s largest
phone company, may use the cash it gets from a deal with the
government-owned high speed Internet network for dividends,
share buy-backs or expanding its business, Chief Executive
Officer David Thodey told the Australian Broadcasting Corp.  Telstra will enjoy “some very rich cash flows” from the
deal, which includes handing over its fixed-line assets in
exchange for A$11 billion ($11.5 billion), Thodey told the ABC’s
“Inside Business” program today, according to a transcript of
the interview. This creates an opportunity for the company to
reorient itself for the next 20 years, he said.  Asked whether Telstra will use the money for acquisitions,
Thodey said “we have real capital management options. We could
look at our dividend policy, we could look at a buy-back program,
or we can look at expanding our business.  “For the first time in this company’s history, we have
real optionality going forward.”  NBN Co., the government-owned national broadband network
builder, will lease access to carriers on the fiber system to be
completed in 2018, with Telstra to receive its compensation over
three decades, the Melbourne-based carrier said in a statement
on June 23.  To contact the reporter for this story:
