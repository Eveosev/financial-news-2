Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (WMT)  said it will
create 15,000 jobs in South Africa within the next five years
after its 16.5 billion rand ($2.4 billion) takeover of
Johannesburg-based retailer  Massmart Holdings Ltd. (MSM)   Wal-Mart plans to open new stores and will spend 60 billion
rand ($8.7 billion) on additional purchases of food and fast-
moving consumer goods, over that period, mostly from local
suppliers, the company said in an e-mailed statement today.  South Africa’s Competition Tribunal on May 31 said it had
approved with conditions the U.S. retailer’s plan to buy a 51
percent stake in Massmart. The companies must ensure no jobs are
cut for two years and that existing labor agreements are honored
for three years after the purchase, the Pretoria-based
 Competition Tribunal  said at the time.  The companies today announced discounts on products from
televisions to paint and bread.  To contact the reporter on this story:
