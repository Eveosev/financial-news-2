The Spanish government won’t create
a fund to finance layoffs because of the weak domestic economy,
 El Pais  reported, citing unidentified people at the Labor
Ministry.  Prime Minister Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, who on June 28
will participate in his last state-of-the-nation debate as the
government leader, may announce new measures to boost the
economy, such as extending commercial schedules, while avoiding
new austerity measures, El Pais said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
