Kuwait’s interest rate of 2.5
percent is "appropriate at the current stage," Al-Rai reported,
citing Central Bank Governor Sheikh Salem Abdul Aziz al-Sabah.  Inflation is accelerating mostly due to rising prices of
imported goods, al-Sabah said, according to Al-Rai.  Finance Minister Mustafa al-Shimali said April 6 that he
expects inflation to be 4 percent to 5 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
