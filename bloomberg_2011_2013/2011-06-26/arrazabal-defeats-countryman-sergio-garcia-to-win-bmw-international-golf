Spain’s Pablo Larrazabal beat
countryman  Sergio Garcia  in a playoff to win the BMW
International Open in Munich, Germany, his first European Tour
golf title in three years.  Larrazabal won at the fifth extra hole with a birdie as
Garcia only made par. Both had finished on 16-under-par 272
through today’s final round, two shots ahead of five other
players including world No. 26 Retief Goosen of South Africa.  The champion collects a check for 333,330 euros ($472,900),
with Garcia receiving 222,220 euros.  The 28-year-old Larrazabal’s  only previous European Tour
victory  was at the Open de France in 2008. He’d recorded four
top-10 finishes in his previous 15 tournaments this year, making
the halfway cut 11 times.  Garcia, 31, formerly No. 2 in the Official World Golf
Ranking but now in 64th spot, is still looking for his first
European Tour win since the HSBC Champions in 2009.  To contact the reporter on this story:
