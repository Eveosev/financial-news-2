Bolivia President  Evo Morales  will
today sign a new law designed to move the Andean nation toward
food sovereignty by spurring small scale agriculture and the
stockpiling of key grains, according to state news agency ABI.  The initiative requires a $500 million a year investment
over the course of 10 years, said Congressman Luis Alfaro,
according to information released by Bolivia’s congress last
week.  The government will form a state seed bank to store and
sort native Bolivian plants, channel credits to community
producers, and define standards for importing, producing and
trading genetically modified products. A silo system for
stockpiling grains such as corn will also be developed.  The law also includes plans for investment in mechanized
agriculture and increased irrigation systems in  Bolivia , where
drought often damages crops.  The law’s focus on communities and individual producers has
prompted some criticism. “The law does not consider the small,
medium and large agricultural businesses who are the principal
producers in the country,” said La Paz-based research company
 Fundacion Milenio  in a document released June 20.  Protests over rising food prices and sugar shortages spread
throughout Bolivia in February, prompting the government to
import sugar to meet internal demand. Annual inflation was 11.2
percent in June, according to the national statistics agency.  To contact the reporter on this story:
