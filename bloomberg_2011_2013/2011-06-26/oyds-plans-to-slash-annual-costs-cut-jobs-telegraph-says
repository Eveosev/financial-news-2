Lloyds Banking Group Plc (LLOY)  will slash
costs by an additional 1 billion pounds ($1.6 billion) per year
and is expected to cut thousands of jobs, the  Sunday Telegraph 
reported, without saying where it got the information.  Chief Executive Officer Antonio Horta-Osorio, who plans to
announce his new strategy on June 30, will focus on cutting
roles as well as reducing costs such as corporate entertainment
expenses, the London-based newspaper said.  The cuts will be in addition to the 2 billion pounds of
savings earmarked from the bankâ€™s acquisition of HBOS Plc,
according to the report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
