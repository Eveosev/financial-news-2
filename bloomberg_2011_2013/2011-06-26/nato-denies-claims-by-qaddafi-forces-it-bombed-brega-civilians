NATO denied a claim by Libyan leader
 Muammar Qaddafi ’s armed forces that it bombed civilian targets
including a bakery and a restaurant in the city of Brega.  North Atlantic Treaty Organization  Spokesman Mike Bracken
said aircraft struck command-and-control centers near Brega and
a radar site and military vehicles in other locations over the
past days.  “What we know is that the buildings we hit were occupied
and used by pro-Qaddafi forces to direct attacks against
civilians around Ajdabiya,” he said in a telephone interview
from Brussels. “We have no indications of any civilian
casualties in connection to these strikes.”  Libya ’s state-news service JANA yesterday cited a military
spokesman as saying that NATO attacks in the previous 48 hours
killed 20 civilians and wounded more than 20 others in the
central coastal city of Brega. NATO said June 19 that its
warplanes didn’t all hit their intended targets during a
nighttime raid on Tripoli and that it may have caused civilian
casualties, its first such admission during the air campaign.  To contact the reporter on this story:
