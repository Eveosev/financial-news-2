(Corrects Valco spelling in first paragraph of story
published June 26.)  HMV Group Plc (HMV)  will announce it has
sold its 125-store Canadian business to Hilco Consumer Capitalâ€™s
private-equity arm, Valco Capital Partners, the  Sunday
Telegraph  reported, without saying where it got the information.  Suppliers to the U.K. CD and DVD retailer were told about
the sale of the loss-making Canadian arm in the past week and
the disposal is expected to raise no more than 5 million pounds
($8 million), the London-based newspaper said.  A spokesman for HMV declined to comment, according to the
report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
