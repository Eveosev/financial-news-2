SABMiller Plc (SAB) ’s offer to buy
 Foster’s Group Ltd. (FGL)  may face opposition from some shareholders,
the  Sunday Times  reported, citing unidentified shareholders.  Some large investors have said Chief Executive Officer
Graham Mackay had not explained adequately why SABMiller is
seeking to takeover Foster’s, the newspaper said. The investors
see few opportunities to reduce costs and view the takeover as
possibly weakening the brewer’s exposure to emerging markets,
the newspaper reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
