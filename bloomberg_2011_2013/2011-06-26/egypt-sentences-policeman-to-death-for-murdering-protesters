A Cairo court sentenced in absentia
a policeman to death for the murder of protesters during the
uprising that led to the ouster of President  Hosni Mubarak , the
state-run Middle East News Agency said.  The court convicted the policeman, Mohammed Ibrahim Abdel
Monem, whose whereabouts are unknown, of killing 23 people and
attempting to murder 16 others, the Cairo-based news agency
reported. At least 846 people died during the uprising, an
official fact-finding committee said in April.  Mubarak ceded interim authority to a military council on
Feb. 11 after 18 days of mass protests.  To contact the reporter on this story:
