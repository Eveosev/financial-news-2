The head of  Turkey ’s steel producers
association said the country’s melting capacity for the metal
may rise even faster than he estimated last week as prospects
for the economy improve.  Turkey may be able to produce 42 metric million tons of
steel billets by 2015, up from 35.4 million in 2010, Veysel
Yayan said at a conference in  New York  last week. Slab capacity
may rise to 20 million tons, from 13.4 million he said. Those
numbers may be exceeded as Turkey’s economy grows, he said in an
interview in Washington on June 24.  Rising exports from the world’s  10th-largest  steel producer
can be a force for stability in the  Middle East , as trade ties
boost goodwill between Turkey and nearby nations, Yayan said.  “Foreign policies and economic policies are very
interrelated,” he said. “Without good relations you cannot
export, especially in our region.”  Billet capacity for this year will be 35.4 million tons and
slab will be 15.9 million, Yayan said. The country’s industry is
continuing to diversify to meet domestic and import-nation
needs, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
