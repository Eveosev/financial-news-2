Former Social Democratic finance
minister Peer Steinbrueck is in talks with party leaders to lead
the SPD’s campaign against  Chancellor Angela Merkel  in 2013,
 Bild am Sonntag  reported today, without saying where it got the
information.  Steinbrueck met with SPD general secretary Andrea Nahles, a
leader of the party’s left wing, to discuss a campaign, telling
her he’s interested in being a candidate if all factions of the
party support him, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
