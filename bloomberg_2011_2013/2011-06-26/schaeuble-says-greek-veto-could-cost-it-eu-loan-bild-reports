German finance minister  Wolfgang Schaeuble  said rejection of Prime Minister  George Papandreou â€™s
austerity plan by the Greek parliament this week could result in
the country foregoing its next loan under a European bailout,
according to an interview today in  Bild am Sonntag .  The Greek parliament is expected to approve the austerity
plan, Schaeuble told the newspaper. German banks have an
incentive to participate voluntarily in bailing out the country,
he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
