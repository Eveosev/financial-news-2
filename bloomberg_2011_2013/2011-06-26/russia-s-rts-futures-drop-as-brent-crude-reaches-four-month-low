Russia’s RTS stock-index futures
fell, signaling shares may drop today in Moscow, after  Brent
crude  slid to a four-month low in  London  as the  International
Energy Agency  announced the release of 60 million barrels.  Futures on the dollar-denominated index expiring in
September fell 0.8 percent on June 24. Contracts on OAO Rosneft,
Russia’s top oil producer, fell 0.7 percent, while those on OAO
Lukoil, the second-biggest, dropped 0.3 percent. Contracts on
OAO Gazprom, the world’s largest gas producer, fell 0.7 percent.  “A decline in  oil prices  may continue through November --
that means additional  currency risk  for ruble-denominated
investments,” Elena Matrosova, a Moscow-based economist at BDO
International, a financial adviser that lists the central bank
among its clients, said in a telephone interview. “It’s not
exactly the right time for investments in Russian equities.”  Russia , the world’s largest energy exporter, also produces
metals including steel, copper, nickel, palladium and aluminum.
Oil and natural gas make up a quarter of its economic output.  The Thomson Reuters/Jefferies CRB Index of 19 raw materials

settle at $91.16 a barrel on the  New York Mercantile Exchange .  Market Vectors Russia ETF  The Market Vectors Russia ETF, a U.S.-traded fund that
