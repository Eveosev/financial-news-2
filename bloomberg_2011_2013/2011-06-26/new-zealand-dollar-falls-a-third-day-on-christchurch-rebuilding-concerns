The  New Zealand dollar  declined for
a third day amid concern rebuilding in earthquake-hit
Christchurch will be delayed, damping the nation’s economic
recovery.  The currency reached a one-week low versus the  U.S. dollar 
after interest.co.nz reported that Fletcher Building, New
Zealand’s largest supplier of building materials, doesn’t expect
rebuilding of damaged homes in Christchurch to start until
aftershocks cease, citing Chief Executive Officer Jonathan Ling.  “Any economic boom and higher rates depended on the
rebuild and it just appears to be more and more delayed,” said
Tim Kelleher, vice-president of institutional banking and
markets at Commonwealth Bank of Australia in Auckland. “The
risk is probably for a weaker kiwi overall.”  New Zealand’s dollar fell to 80.74 U.S. cents as of 7:52
a.m. in Sydney from 81.18 cents in  New York  on June 24, and
earlier touched 80.54 cents, the weakest since June 20. It
declined 0.6 percent to 64.91 yen. Australia’s dollar traded at
$1.0482 from $1.0491 last week. The currency fetched 84.29 yen
from 84.37 yen.  To contact the reporter on this story:
