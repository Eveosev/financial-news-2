The  New Zealand dollar  fell,
extending earlier declines, after a government report showed the
nation’s May trade surplus was smaller then estimated by
economists in a Bloomberg survey.  The currency dropped to 80.46 U.S. cents as of 10:48 a.m.
in Wellington, from 80.67 cents before the data and 81.18 cents
on June 24 in  New York .  To contact the reporter on this story:
