Oil fell in  New York  on concern the
economic expansion in the U.S. is slowing and as the
 International Energy Agency  said it’s prepared to release more
stockpiles to stabilize prices.  Futures dropped as much as 0.7 percent before reports this
week that may show U.S. consumer spending climbed at the slowest
pace in almost a year and manufacturing cooled. Greek lawmakers
will vote on a five-year austerity plan that must pass for the
cash-strapped nation to secure more international aid. The IEA,
adviser to 28 nations, will act again if needed, Executive
Director  Nobuo Tanaka  said in Beijing on June 25.  “Leading into the IEA’s decision to release stockpiles, we
had a global economy that was slowing and we already had
concerns over Greece,” said  Jonathan Barratt , managing director
of Commodity Broking Services Pty in Sydney. The IEA’s move
suggests “there is more urgency for lower  oil prices  than the
market thought,” he said.  Crude oil for August delivery declined as much as 65 cents
to $90.51 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange, and was
at $90.77 at 8:14 a.m. Singapore time. Prices rose 14 cents, or
0.2 percent, to $91.16 on June 24, and are up 16 percent the
past year.  Brent oil for August delivery was at $105.16 a barrel, up 4
cents, on the London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange. The
contract fell $2.14, or 2 percent, to $105.12 a barrel on June
24, the lowest close since Feb. 18.  Hedge funds  cut bullish bets on oil to the lowest level in
more than six months. The funds and other large speculators
reduced wagers on rising prices by 14 percent in the week ended
June 21, according to the Commodity Futures Trading Commission’s
weekly Commitments of Traders report. Bullish bets have dropped
46 percent from a March 8 record amid disappointing U.S.
economic reports on employment and housing.  To contact the reporter on this story:
