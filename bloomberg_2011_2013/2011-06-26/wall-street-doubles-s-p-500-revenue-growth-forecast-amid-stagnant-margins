Analysts are increasing sales
forecasts for Standard & Poor’s 500 Index companies by the most
in three years, compensating investors as the biggest expansion
in profitability since 2002 ends.  Revenue will climb 10 percent in 2011, twice last year’s
rate, as personal income and corporate spending recover,
according to data from analysts compiled by Bloomberg. Net
margin estimates were unchanged the past two months after rising
more than 50 percent since 2009. The measure of income divided
by revenue increased to 13.4 percent in the first quarter from
8.2 percent in October 2009, Bloomberg data show.  Companies that boosted profits by firing workers and
closing factories in the first two years of the expansion are
running out of opportunities to reduce costs, requiring sales
gains to keep growing. While bears say U.S. businesses will fail
to increase revenue fast enough to justify higher stock prices,
chief executive officers at  Caterpillar Inc. (CAT)  and  Coventry Health
Care Inc. (CVH)  have raised forecasts.  “In the early part of the recovery, the CEO focuses on
efficiency, productivity and margin enhancing, until their sales
kick in,” said  James Paulsen , the chief investment strategist
at Minneapolis-based Wells Capital, which oversees $340 billion.
“Once that happens, that emphasis on margins starts to fade.
What looks on the surface as something you’d check off as bad is
actually an indication that things are getting better.”  Caterpillar, Coventry  Caterpillar, the world’s largest maker of construction
equipment, and Coventry Health, an insurer based in Bethesda,
 Maryland , posted higher profits when sales retreated, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg. Each has rallied after boosting
revenue, the data show.  The  S&P 500  fell 0.2 percent between June 17 and June 24,
dropping for the seventh time in eight weeks. The gauge has
surged 87 percent to 1,268.45 since reaching a 12-year low in
March 2009 during the 18-month recession, the longest since the
43-month slump of the Great Depression, according to the
 National Bureau of Economic Research . The index rose 0.9 percent
to 1,280.09 today.  Analysts have boosted estimates for S&P 500 sales growth in
2011 to 10 percent, compared with 5.2 percent last year and a
decline of 9.1 percent in 2009.  Income Rising  Personal income for Americans increased 0.3 percent in May
for the second month, according to Commerce Department data
today. Income is rising at an average rate of 0.5 percent a
month in 2011, versus 0.3 percent in 2010, Commerce Department
data show.  Capital spending  by companies in the index may jump
21 percent this year, according to the median estimate of
analysts compiled by Bloomberg. Retail sales excluding cars
increased 0.3 percent last month, topping economist predictions
for a 0.2 percent gain, the data show.  Revenue gains may push S&P 500 profits to $99.08 a share
this year, up 17 percent from 2010, after rising 37 percent a
year earlier, the biggest two-year expansion since 1995, analyst
estimates compiled by Bloomberg show. The gauge has traded at an
average 15.7 times reported earnings since the start of 2010, or
15 percent below the average for the rest of the past 10 years.  “Due to the stubbornly high unemployment, lack of economic
clarity and questionable self-sustainability, the multiple needs
to come down,” said Chad Morganlander, a  Florham Park , New
Jersey-based  money manager  at Stifel Nicolaus, which oversees
$110 billion. “Margins have reached the crescendo, so any
improvement with earnings will be pushed through with sales
growth. But the economy suggests only a modest improvement in
sales, and so earnings improvement should be modest at best.”  Employment Report  The S&P 500 tumbled as much as 7.2 percent after reaching
an almost three-year high of 1,363.61 on April 29, driven by
government reports showing U.S. employers added 67 percent fewer
jobs than economists forecast in May and producer prices rose at
twice the expected rate. At 40 days, the decrease is the second
longest since the  bull market  began, Bloomberg data show.
 Consumer spending  unexpectedly stagnated in May, marking the
weakest outcome since June 2010, Commerce Department figures
showed today.  Shares broke a four-day winning streak on June 22 after the
 Federal Reserve  cut its forecast for growth and employment in
2011 and 2012. Risk signals for financial stability in the euro
area are flashing “red,” European Central Bank President Jean- Claude Trichet said that day.  The  U.S. economy  grew 1.9 percent last quarter, a slowdown
from 3.1 percent at the end of last year. Unemployment
unexpectedly climbed to 9.1 percent in May, homebuilder
confidence plunged to the lowest level in nine months and
economists cut their estimates for 2011 gross domestic product
growth to 2.5 percent from 3.2 percent in February.  ‘Derisking and Deleveraging’  “We’re seeing a tightening in financial conditions,
derisking and deleveraging,” said Doug Noland, the money
manager for Pittsburgh-based Federated Investors Inc.’s Prudent
Bear Fund, which oversees $1.3 billion. “The markets are
starting to recognize this. They’re recognizing we need to bring
down these multiples because the environment is so uncertain.”  Peak profit margins haven’t always signaled the end of
equity gains in the past, data compiled by Bloomberg show. The
last time corporate profitability reached a high was in January
2007, before the S&P 500 advanced 10 percent through October,
the data show. In the same period, U.S. government bonds
returned 5 percent, while bonds for American companies added 3
percent, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch data.  Margins rose to a record 15.6 percent in 1999, when the
benchmark gauge for U.S. equities rallied 14 percent through
March 2000. That time, Treasuries rose 1.5 percent, and
corporate bonds lost 0.24 percent. The S&P GSCI Total Return
Index of 24 raw materials outperformed equities in both periods,
advancing 23 percent in 2007 and 38 percent in 1999.  Four Stages  Stocks will probably climb about 5.9 percent through March
2012 if history is any guide, according to Birinyi Associates
Inc., which examined data on bull markets since 1962. The
Westport, Connecticut-based money-management and research firm
found advances typically have four stages with the biggest gains
coming in the first, when economic data rebounds, and the last,
when investors who missed earlier gains buy shares.  The third phase of an advance is usually the weakest as
economic growth slows, Birinyi said. While that may be happening
now, the firm predicts equities will rise 51 percent by the end
of the rally in 2013, based on average historical returns.  “We had two years where every data point was stronger than
the next one, and earnings were just marching back to all-time
peaks,” said  Jeffrey Kleintop , the chief market strategist at
LPL Financial Corp. in  Boston , which manages about $300 billion.
“It’s great, but that pace of growth is unsustainable, and
ultimately you get to the point where businesses do need to
reinvest to generate growth.”  Profit Margins  Profit margins have reached the highest level since the end
of 2007, data compiled by Bloomberg show. The expansion since
2009 has helped S&P 500 companies raise earnings for nine
straight quarters.  “As sales start to emerge, attention turns to investment,
to staffing, and to meeting the sales demand,” Paulsen said.
“We’re not going to have profit growth going forward like we
have had, but there’s nothing uncommon about that, because of
the economic cycle we’re in. Even if margin slips a little bit,
your overall earnings can still do fairly well.”  Caterpillar in Peoria,  Illinois , posted a 28 percent
increase in adjusted earnings per share for the first quarter of
last year, even as sales shrank 11 percent. It countered a slump
in machinery and engine sales by lowering operating expenses 23
percent that quarter after cutting about 37,000 workers and
contractors from late 2008 to the end of 2009.  Higher Sales  The company said on April 29 that revenue will climb to at
least $52 billion this year, compared with an October forecast
of less than $50 billion, as sales surge in  developing
countries . The stock is up 51 percent since Caterpillar started
to report higher sales.  Coventry Health Care’s adjusted earnings rose 73 percent
last year even as sales slipped 17 percent. The profit margin,
which in 2009 was the lowest since 1997, more than doubled.
Shares of the health insurer advanced 2.7 percent since the
company boosted its revenue estimate for the year on April 29.  “We are downshifting to a more normal mid-cyclical
environment,” said Kleintop. “That’s a good thing, it sustains
the recovery. Even as profit margins might be stable or even
falling, stocks will do reasonably well because people believe
the growth is going to continue, even if at a slower pace.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
