Yani Tseng became the youngest
female golfer to capture four major tournament titles with her
10-shot victory at the LPGA Championship  Taiwan’s Tseng, 22, who’s No. 1 in the women’s world golf
ranking, finished 19-under-par yesterday at Locust Hill Country
Club in Pittsford,  New York , to tie the record for the lowest
score in relation to par at a major championship.  “I don’t think I’ve played any better, especially since
this is a major,” Tseng said in a televised interview.  Se-Ri Pak of  South Korea  held the previous LPGA record by
winning her fourth major at the age of 24 in 2002. Tiger Woods
claimed his fourth men’s major championship in 2000 at the same
age. Young Tom Morris won four British Opens by the age of 21 in
1872 before there were other major championships.  “She’s really the new face of the LPGA,” Hall of Fame
golfer Annika Sorenstam, who won the first of her 10 LPGA major
titles in 1995 at the age of 24, said of Tseng in a televised
interview. “She’s doing everything right on the course.”  Tseng opened the tournament with a 6-under-par 66 and
followed it up with rounds of 70, 67 and 66 to earn $375,000.  Morgan Pressel finished second at 9-under par, one stroke
better than fellow Americans Paula Creamer and Cristie Kerr, the
2010 winner, and Suzann Pettersen of  Norway .  Tseng’s win was her third on the LPGA Tour this season and
comes a week after 22-year-old Rory McIlroy of  Northern Ireland 
won the  U.S. Open , the second men’s major of the year.  Tseng has eight career victories and got her first major
win as a rookie at the 2008 LPGA Championship.  The LPGA’s next major tournament is the U.S. Women’s Open,
held July 7-10 at The Broodmoor in  Colorado Springs , Colorado.  To contact the reporter on this story:
