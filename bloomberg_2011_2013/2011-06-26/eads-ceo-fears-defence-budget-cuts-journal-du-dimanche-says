European Aeronautic, Defence & Space
Co. Chief Executive Officer Louis Gallois “fears” that the
trend in defense budget cuts may last several years,  Le Journal
du Dimanche  reported, citing an interview.  Air France SA must make decision about a future large order
based on its needs, the CEO told the Paris-based newspaper amid
calls by some French lawmakers that the French carrier should
favour Airbus over Boeing Co.  Canadian, Russian and Chinese plane-makers will probably
represent a threat to Airbus planes of the A320 category in 10
years, Gallois said, according to Le Journal du Dimanche.  To contact the reporter on this story:
