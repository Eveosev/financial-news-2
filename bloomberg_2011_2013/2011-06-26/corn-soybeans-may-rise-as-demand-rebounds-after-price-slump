Corn and soybeans may rebound this
week on renewed demand for U.S. supplies to make food,  animal
feed  and fuel.  Twenty-six of 32 traders and analysts surveyed from  Tokyo 
to Chicago on June 24 forecast that corn will climb, and 24 of
34 respondents said soybeans will gain.  Last week, corn futures for December delivery fell 4.2
percent to $6.32 a bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade after
touching a three-month low, and soybeans for November delivery
dropped 1.8 percent to $13.0925 a bushel, the third straight
decline.  The drop in corn and soybeans last week was a surprise to
the majority of analysts and traders surveyed on June 17.  Bullish on corn: 26    Bullish on soybeans: 24
Bearish on corn:  6    Bearish on soybeans: 10  To contact the reporter on this story:
