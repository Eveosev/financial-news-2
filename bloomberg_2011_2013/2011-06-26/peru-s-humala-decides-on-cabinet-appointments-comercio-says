Peruvian President-elect
Ollanta Humala has selected his cabinet, choosing someone from
within his Peru Wins party to be finance minister,  El Comercio 
reported, citing Vice President-elect Marisol Espinoza.  Kurt Burneo, a former deputy finance minister, has “worked
hard” for Humala, while economic adviser Felix Jimenez also
will be part of Humala’s government, the Lima-based newspaper
said, citing Espinoza, who wasn’t more specific.  Congressman Daniel Abugattas will be either cabinet chief
or president of Congress, El Comercio said, citing Espinoza.  To contact the reporter on this story:
