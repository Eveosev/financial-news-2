The  Washington Nationals  named Davey Johnson as manager until the end of the Major League Baseball
season.  Johnson succeeds Jim Riggleman, who resigned three days ago
because the Nationals refused to discuss his contract option for
2012. Riggleman had a 140-172 record with Washington since 2009.  Johnson, who managed the  New York Mets  to the 1986 World
Series title, will participate in the hiring of his successor at
the Nationals after also agreeing to remain as a consultant for
three years after this season.  “We could have absolutely no better choice to lead the
Nationals at this time,” General Manager Mike Rizzo  said on the
team’s website  today. “He knows exactly what we need to be doing
to build the Nationals into a contender.”  Johnson, 68, has been a senior adviser to Rizzo since 2009.
His last job as a manager was with the  Los Angeles Dodgers  in
2000. He’s also been the manager in Cincinnati and Baltimore and
has a 1,148-888 record in 14 seasons.  John McLaren was put in temporary charge of the team two
days ago before Washington beat the Chicago White Sox 9-5 in 14
innings for their 12th win in 13 games.  The Nationals, who have never finished with a winning
record since joining the National League in 2005, are third in
the East division, 8 1/2 games behind the Philadelphia Phillies.  Johnson’s first game will be tomorrow against the Los
Angles Angels. The Nationals wrap up a three-game series against
the Chicago White Sox today. The teams have each won one game.  To contact the reporter on this story:
