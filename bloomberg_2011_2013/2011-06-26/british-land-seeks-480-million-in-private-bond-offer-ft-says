likely to issue a series of bonds with maturities ranging from
seven to 15 years, with  Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc (RBS)  and
 HSBC Holdings Plc (HSBA)  acting as joint book runners, the newspaper
said. A British Land spokesman declined to comment, the FT said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
