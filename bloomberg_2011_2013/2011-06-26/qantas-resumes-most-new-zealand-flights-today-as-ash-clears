Qantas Airways Ltd. (QAN) , Australia’s
largest carrier, will resume most of its flights to and from  New
Zealand  today as a cloud of volcanic ash that has plagued
carriers in the southern hemisphere for three weeks clears.  Flights to Auckland, Christchurch and Queenstown will
operate as scheduled, while services to Wellington remain
suspended, the Sydney-based airline said in a statement on its
 website  yesterday.       Air New Zealand Ltd. (AIR)  is operating its
standard schedule to all domestic and international airports,
the Auckland-based carrier said  yesterday .  Trans-Tasman flights were canceled yesterday by Qantas and
Virgin Australia Group, the nation’s second-biggest carrier, on
concern that ash from the Puyehue-Cordon Caulle volcanic complex
in Southern Chile may clog their  jet engines . Qantas said
yesterday it delayed by 28 hours a scheduled June 25 service
from Sydney to Buenos Aires and planned to operate the flight
via Papeete, Tahiti.  All other international and domestic Qantas flights are
operating as scheduled, Qantas said.  Nine Virgin flights today between Australia and New Zealand
were  listed  as canceled on the airline’s website as of noon in
Sydney yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
