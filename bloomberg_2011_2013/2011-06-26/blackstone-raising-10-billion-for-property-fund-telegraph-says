Blackstone Group LP (BX)  has started
raising more than $10 billion to buy property assets around the
world, the  Sunday Telegraph  reported, without saying where it
got the information.  The private equity firm has begun marketing to potential
investors in the fund, which will primarily invest in U.S. and
Canadian property, the London-based newspaper said. A spokesman
for Blackstone declined to comment, according to the report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
