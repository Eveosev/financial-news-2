Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said he accepted a prisoner-exchange deal proposed by
a German mediator to free Israeli soldier Gilad Shalit who’s
been held in the Hamas-controlled  Gaza Strip  for five years.  “This proposal was difficult and not simple from Israel’s
perspective, but I agreed to accept based on an understanding of
our interest in seeing Gilad return home and Hamas’ interest in
getting its prisoners released,” Netanyahu told the Cabinet in
 Jerusalem  today in remarks broadcast on  Army Radio . “Until this
moment we haven’t received an official answer from Hamas to the
mediators’ proposal.”  Hamas, the Islamic movement that controls Gaza, denied the
Israeli claim. “There is nothing new in the prisoners’ exchange
deal so far, and Netanyahu is practicing lies,” Hamas spokesman
Sami Abu Zuhri said in a phone interview.  Shalit, 24, was seized by Palestinian militants in an
attack on an Israeli army post on the border with Gaza on June
25, 2006. Egypt and  Germany  have been trying for years to broker
an exchange in which Shalit would be freed in return for the
release of Palestinian security prisoners from Israeli jails.  Hamas is considered a terrorist organization by the U.S.,
the European Union and Israel.  To contact the reporter on this story:
