K+S AG Chief Executive Officer
Norbert Steiner said  Germany  may need to import raw materials if
the country lacks the political will to support mining,
according to an interview in the  Sueddeutsche Zeitung .  Technology may limit the impact of mining on the
environment, Steiner said, according to an e-mailed preview of
the interview to be published tomorrow. K+S will spend 360
million euros ($510.3 million) on environmental projects for its
largest facility on the Werra River, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
