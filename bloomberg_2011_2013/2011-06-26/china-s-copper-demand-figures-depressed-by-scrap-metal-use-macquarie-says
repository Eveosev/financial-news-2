China ’s copper demand figures have
been depressed by usage of scrap metal and supplies taken out of
bonded warehouses, Macquarie Group Ltd said in a report.  Over the past two months, about 200,000 metric tons of
copper may have been removed from bonded warehouses in China,
which should be added to demand estimates, Macquarie said in a
report dated tomorrow. Not counting that metal, apparent copper
demand was down 8.5 percent in January through May from the same
period last year, Macquarie said.  “Another factor depressing refined copper consumption has
been greater use of copper scrap as a substitute for refined
copper but the most recent reports suggest availability of
scrap is now greatly reduced,” Macquarie said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
