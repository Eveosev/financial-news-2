Blackstone Group LP (BX)  has started a 1
billion-pound ($1.6 billion) refinancing of Center Parcs, the
 Sunday Telegraph  reported, without saying where it got the
information.  Blackstone will inject more equity into Center Parcs to
allow it to open a fifth park in the U.K. and may have started
talks with a syndicate of banks, possibly including  Royal Bank
of Scotland Group Plc (RBS) , the London-based newspaper said.  The refinancing may value the company at about 1.5 billion
pounds, the Sunday Telegraph said. A spokesman for Blackstone
declined to comment, according to the newspaper.  To contact the reporter on this story:
