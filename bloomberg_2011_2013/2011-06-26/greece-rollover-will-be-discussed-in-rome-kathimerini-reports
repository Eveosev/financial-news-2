European Union officials and
representatives of banking institutions will meet in  Rome 
tomorrow to discuss plans to allow banks and other private
investors to roll over maturing Greek debt,  Kathimerini 
newspaper reported, without saying how it got the information.  Charles H. Dallara , managing director of global banking
lobby group  Institute of International Finance , will attend the
meeting with Vittorio Grilli, the Italian head of the European
Economic and Finance Committee, the newspaper said. The informal
meeting aims to get as much private sector participation in the
plan as possible, Kathimerini said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
