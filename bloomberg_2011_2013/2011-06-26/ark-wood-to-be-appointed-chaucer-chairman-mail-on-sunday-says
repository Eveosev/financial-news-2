Mark Wood, a former Prudential Plc
executive, will become chairman of  Chaucer Holdings Plc (CHU)  after
its takeover by the Hanover Insurance Group Inc., the  Mail on
Sunday  reported, without saying where it got the information.  Wood, who was also U.K. chief executive officer of  Axa SA (CS) ,
is currently a non-executive director at Chaucer. Hanover’s
acquisition of the Lloyd’s of London insurer is set to be
completed next month, the London-based newspaper said.  A spokeswoman for the company declined to comment when
contacted by Bloomberg News.  To contact the reporter on this story:
