Fraport AG isn’t in talks with
Frankfurt-Hahn airport about freight cooperation, the company
said in an e-mailed statement today, denying a report by
 Handelsblatt  that the two parties are in discussion on the
matter.  A meeting several months ago concerned “branch trends”
and remaining legal links between the two entities, Fraport said
in the statement.  Handelsblatt cited Hahn Managing Director Joerg Schumacher
in reporting that the operator of Frankfurt airport is in talks
with Frankfurt-Hahn about a cooperation that may include air-
freight flights,  Hahn officials met with the Fraport board, the newspaper
quoted Schumacher as saying in an e-mailed preview of an article
to be published tomorrow. It would be possible to shift some
freight flights to Hahn without building new warehouses, the
report quoted him as saying.  Fraport transferred its 65 percent stake in Frankfurt-Hahn
airport to the state of Rhineland-Palatinate in 2009.  To contact the reporter on this story:
