New Zealand ’s trade surplus narrowed
more than economists forecast in May as a jump in fuel imports
and aircraft parts purchases outweighed increased exports of
commodities and pleasure boats.  Exports exceeded imports by NZ$605 million ($487 million),
down from a revised NZ$1.15 billion surplus in April,  Statistics
New Zealand  said today in Wellington. The median estimate in a
Bloomberg News survey of 12 economists was for a NZ$1 billion
surplus.  New Zealand’s dollar fell by the most in more than a week
on concerns that exports, which make up 30 percent of gross
domestic product, will provide less of an impetus to the
economy’s recovery after earthquakes in Christchurch. Central
bank Governor Alan Bollard on June 9 said rising commodity
prices had boosted exports and business confidence.  “With the global recovery looking less assured, and with
resources needing to shift toward earthquake reconstruction, a
series of narrowing trade surpluses from later this year remains
in prospect,” said  Mark Smith , an economist at ANZ  National
Bank Ltd. (NBL)  in Wellington, in an e-mailed note.  The  New Zealand dollar  dropped 1.1 percent to 80.29 U.S.
cents at 11:43 a.m. in Wellington, from 81.18 cents on June 24
in  New York , heading for its biggest decline since June 15.  Exports rose 10 percent from the year-earlier month to
NZ$4.63 billion, today’s report showed. Economists expected
NZ$4.73 billion, according to the Bloomberg survey.  Meat and lumber led the rise as commodity prices increased
0.3 percent in May from April to a record, according to an index
released earlier this month and calculated by ANZ National Bank
Ltd. From a year earlier, the index jumped 20 percent.  Dairy Shipments  Dairy exports, which make up a fifth of overseas sales,
rose 8 percent from a year earlier to NZ$981 million, today’s
report showed. Still, dairy sales fell from April, led by a
decline in volumes, the statistics agency said, citing
seasonally adjusted figures. Overseas sales of pleasure boats
rose to NZ$108 million from NZ$9 million, the agency said.  Imports rose 17 percent from a year earlier to NZ$4.02
billion, the biggest gain since February. Imports were led by
fuel, reflecting an increase in volumes to 481,000 metric tons
from 381,000 tons in May last year. Prices rose 4.8 percent.  Aircraft parts imports of NZ$214 million were a one-time
event, the statistics agency said. Crane, tractor and mobile
phone purchases bolstered imports of capital machinery, it said.  New Zealand posted a trade surplus of NZ$1.07 billion in
the 12 months ended May 31. The gap narrowed from a revised
NZ$1.23 billion in the year through April. Economists expected a
12-month surplus of NZ$1.41 billion.  To contact the reporter on this story:
