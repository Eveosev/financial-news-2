Ratio Oil Exploration 1992 LP (RATIL) 
advanced the most in almost a month after the Israeli oil and
gas exploration company said drilling started at the Leviathan 3
site.  Ratio, which owns a 15 percent stake in the Leviathan
field, gained 3.9 percent, the most since May 30, to 0.369
shekel at the 4:30 p.m. close in  Tel Aviv . Avner Oil
Exploration-LP dropped 0.1 percent, while Delek Drilling-LP fell
0.5 percent. Both companies are partners in the project.  Noble Energy Inc., another partner in the Leviathan natural
gas field, holds a 39.7 percent stake, while Delek Drilling and
Avner each own 22.7 percent.  The Infrastructures Ministry on June 24 granted Noble
Energy and its partners permission to drill at the site.  To contact the reporter on this story:
