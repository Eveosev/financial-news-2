Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc (RBS) 
plans to join with  Blackstone Group LP (BX)  or  Lone Star Funds  to
manage a property-loan portfolio that the bank is seeking to
sell, the  Sunday Times reported , citing sources it didnâ€™t
identify.  The private equity partner will take a 25 percent stake in
the portfolio while RBS seeks to divest its 75 percent holding,
the newspaper said. The 1.6 billion-pound ($2.6 billion) loan
package may be valued at about 1.2 billion pounds because the
private equity company will demand a discount, according to the
Times.  RBS spokeswoman Linda Harper declined to comment when
contacted by Bloomberg News.  To contact the reporter on this story:
