News Corp. (NWSA)  should pay an additional
4 billion pounds ($6.4 billion) to buy the 61 percent of  British
Sky Broadcasting Group Plc (BSY)  that it doesn’t own, the Sunday Times
said, citing Crispin Odey, the founder of a company with a 2.7
percent stake in BSkyB.  Odey of Odey Asset Management LLP believes the broadcaster
is worth 19 billion pounds, the newspaper reported. That
suggests News Corp. would need to offer 11.6 billion pounds for
BSkyB shares it doesn’t already hold, rather than the 7.8
billion pounds it offered a year ago, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
