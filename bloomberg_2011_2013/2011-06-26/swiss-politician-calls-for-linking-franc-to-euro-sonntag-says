Switzerland  should temporarily link
its currency to the euro because the strength of the franc is
threatening 100,000 jobs, Christian Levrat, head of the Social
Democrat party, was reported as saying by  Der Sonntag .  The  Swiss National Bank  should consider the link and
intervene to weaken the franc, Hans Hess, head of mechanical
engineering trade group Swissmem, also told the newspaper.  To contact the reporter on this story:
