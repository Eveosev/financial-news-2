U.K. Prime Minister David Cameron’s
government wants British banks to help  Greece  avoid a default,
the Observer  reported , citing “insiders” it didn’t name.  U.K. banks hold about 2.5 billion pounds ($4 billion) of
Greek bonds and the government is urging them to join any
Europe-wide plan to prevent the euro-area’s first default, the
newspaper reported.  German Chancellor Angela Merkel’s government is jostling
with its biggest banks and insurers over aiding Greece with her
 Finance Ministry  rejecting industry calls for incentives to
encourage them to participate.  To contact the reporters on this story:
