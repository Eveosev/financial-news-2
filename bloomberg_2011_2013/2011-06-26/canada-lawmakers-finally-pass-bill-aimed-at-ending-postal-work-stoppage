Canada ’s Conservative government
used its parliamentary  majority  to pass legislation that would
end a 3-week old labor dispute at Canada Post after opposition
lawmakers forced the legislature to sit since June 23 without
interruption.  The legislation, which will order about 48,000 employees
back to work at government-owned Canada Post, passed by a 158-
112 margin. The bill must now be approved by the Senate, where
the Conservatives also have a majority, before it becomes law.  The Canadian Union of Postal Workers began a series of
rotating strikes June 2, and the company locked out workers June
14. Talks between Canada Post and the union broke off earlier
this week.  Under a motion passed by the government last week, the
House of Commons sat continuously until the legislation passed.
Opposition leader  Jack Layton  had each of the 103 New Democratic
Party lawmakers participate in the debate, delaying its passage
for nearly three days.  Marc Roy, a spokesman for Senate opposition Liberal leader
James Cowan, said last week that the Liberals -- the only other
major party in the Senate -- don’t plan to stand in the way of
the bill being passed quickly. Once the bill passes the Senate
it will receive “Royal Assent,” and under the terms of the
legislation, workers have to be back on the job 24 hours later.  To contact the reporter on this story:
