Russia ’s envoy to Africa Mikhail Margelov is to meet a delegation of Syrian human rights
activists in Moscow after Prime Minister  Vladimir Putin  said
Syria’s leadership must be pressured to end its crackdown.  Margelov will meet the group on June 28, he told Bloomberg
News in a text message.  The talks are to be held amid the unrest in Syria, where
opposition supporters are calling for an end to President Bashar
al-Assad’s government. The clashes pushed the number of Syrian
refugees in neighboring Turkey to 11,739 on June 24, according
to Anatolia news agency that cited the office of Prime Minister
 Recep Tayyip Erdogan .  Putin has distanced himself from Assad, saying on June 21
in Paris that Russia has no “special interests” in  Syria .
"Certainly, it is necessary to pressure leadership of any
country, where mass unrest and, all the more, bloodshed take
place," he said. "It is necessary to demand from any country’s
leadership to use those measures that would not lead to human
deaths, and, vice versa, to demand the use of political
instruments during solution of domestic issues."  To contact the reporters on this story:
