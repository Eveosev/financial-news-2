Hu Jia, a prominent Chinese
dissident, was released today after spending more than three
years in a Beijing prison, his wife said.  He returned home at 2:30 a.m. local time, Zeng Jinyan said
in a Twitter message. “Sleepless night,” she wrote. “Safe,
very happy.” Hu and his wife live in an eastern suburb of the
Chinese capital.  Hu’s release was expected as his prison term was set to end
today. A leading campaigner in  China  for AIDS sufferers,
environmental issues and civil rights, Hu, 37, was sentenced to
3 1/2 years in jail in 2008 for “inciting subversion,” several
months before the European Parliament awarded him its top human
rights prize, named after the late Soviet dissident Andrei
Sakharov.  Chinese authorities released dissident artist Ai Weiwei on
bail on June 22, the official  Xinhua News Agency  said in a
report that day. Ai, who was detained on April 3 at Beijing
airport, was let out because of “his good attitude in
confessing his crimes,” willingness to pay taxes he owes, and
his chronic disease, Xinhua said.  Ai’s sister Gao Ge said in a telephone interview that while
her brother was thinner, he appeared otherwise fine.  Human Rights Watch , a New York-based advocacy group, says
Ai was one of more than 100 people detained in China this year
in “the largest crackdown on dissent in over a decade.”  One of the activists, Chen Guangcheng, a blind village
advocate of law in eastern Shandong province, has been kept
under unofficial house arrest with his wife since he was
released from jail last fall, according to the  Associated Press .  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
