Beijing called on residents to cut
back on fireworks for the traditional  Lantern Festival  today as
 air quality  in the Chinese capital city worsens, state-run  China 
News Service reported.  Today is the final day of the annual Lunar New Year
celebrations and the last time Beijing residents are allowed to
set off fireworks during the period. In 2009, Lantern Festival
fireworks triggered a blaze in a building in the landmark new
China Central Television compound in downtown Beijing  Pollution levels in Beijing rose to a record on Jan. 12,
sparking criticism of the government’s handling of the
environment. Li Keqiang, set to become China’s next premier,
called for patience as authorities work to reduce emissions.  China, estimated by the World Bank to have 16 of the
world’s 20 most-polluted cities, is the largest emitter of
greenhouse gases. The burning of coal is the main source of
pollution, accounting for 19 percent, while vehicle emissions
contribute 6 percent, according to a study by Greenpeace and
Peking University’s School of Public Health published Dec. 18.  China will impose emission limits on six polluting
industries including coal-fired power plants and steel and
petrochemical factories as soon as March 1 to improve air
quality in major cities, the country’s environment ministry said
on Feb. 20.  To contact the reporter on this story:
