Attackers detonated explosives in an
early morning assault in Colombia on the Cerrejon coal-mining
venture owned by  BHP Billiton Ltd. (BHP) ,  Xstrata Plc (XTA)  and  Anglo
American Plc (AAL) , Cerrejon said.  The assault damaged four trucks that had been stopped in
the area of the mine because of a 17-day-old strike, according
to an e-mailed statement today from Cerrejon. Nobody was killed,
and it wasn’t clear who targeted the vehicles, the company said.  “Cerrejon emphatically rejects the act of terrorism
carried out against it,” it said in the statement. “Cerrejon
calls upon its workers and the community for solidarity in
condemning these acts.”  Workers at Cerrejon, the world’s largest export-focused,
open-pit coal mine, walked off the job Feb. 7 in part to demand
a pay raise.  Igor Diaz, president of the coal workers’ union
Sintracarbon, said in a telephone interview that his group
denounces the attack and that his union plans to re-engage mine
leadership tomorrow in a step toward resolving the labor
dispute.  “We completely reject this terrorist attack,” he said in
a telephone interview from Barrancas, in La Guajira, Colombia.  To contact the reporter on this story:
