Swansea City beat Bradford City 5-0
in English soccer’s League Cup final to win its first major
trophy and secure a place in next season’s Europa League.  Nathan Dyer and Jonathan de Guzman got two goals each and
Michu also scored for Premier League Swansea. Bradford, which
became the first fourth-tier club to appear in a major Wembley
final, had goalkeeper Matt Duke red-carded when 3-0 down.  Dyer and Michu, with his 19th goal of the season, scored in
the first half. Dyer added another goal just after halftime and
De Guzman converted a 59th-minute penalty after Duke’s sending-
off for tripping the Dutchman in the area. De Guzman got the
fifth goal in injury time.  “The first trophy is always special and next year in
 Europe  it's a nice experience,” Swansea manager Michael Laudrup,
a European Cup winner with Barcelona in 1992, told  Sky Sports .  Bradford had upset three Premier League teams on its way to
the final: Wigan, Arsenal and Aston Villa. The club’s only major
trophy win was the 1911 F.A. Cup, when the team was in the top
division.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
