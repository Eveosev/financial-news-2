Zinc-processing fees will probably
rise almost 10 percent from last year, as increased ore supplies
enable smelters to charge miners more, said Duncan Hobbs, an
analyst at Macquarie Group Ltd.  Smelters including  Korea Zinc Co. (010130)  and mining companies such
as  Teck Resources Ltd. (TCK/B)  are in annual negotiations at an
 International Zinc Association  conference in Cancun, Mexico,
over treatment charges that mining companies pay to have their
semi-processed ore turned into finished metal. The talks will
probably be completed in the next two or three days, Hobbs said.  The fees are likely to settle at about $210 a metric ton,
based on a zinc price of $2,000 a ton, Hobbs said in an
interview in Cancun. The were $191 a ton last year on a zinc
price of $2,000 a ton. The fees to refine semi-processed ore,
also known as concentrate, generally rise when supplies of ore
increase.  “The balance in this year’s negotiations is with the
smelters,” Hobbs said. “There’s still likely to be a surplus
market this year.”  The price of zinc, used to rust-proof steel, is up 0.4
percent this year on the London Metal Exchange.  Nyrstar (NYR)  NV, the largest producer of the refined metal, is
“reasonably confident” that zinc treatment charges will rise,
