Vipshop Holdings Ltd. (VIPS)  drove a
rebound in Chinese stocks traded in  New York  as the online
fashion retailer joined companies posting better-than-estimated
earnings amid a recovery in the world’s second-largest economy.  Shares of Vipshop, which sells brands from Guess to Adidas
from its website at a discount, rallied 7.8 percent to $24.42 in
New York Feb. 22 after the Guangzhou-based company reported a
first quarterly profit more than eight times the mean of two
analysts’ estimates compiled by Bloomberg. The  Bloomberg China-
US Equity Index (CH55BN)  of the most-traded Chinese equities in the U.S.
climbed 1 percent, trimming a weekly drop of 2.2 percent spurred
by concern global stimulus will be withdrawn.  China’s economy  emerged from its seven-quarter slowdown in
the last three months of 2012, when the 15 companies on the
China-US gauge that reported over the past month earned on
average more than triple what analysts estimated,  data  compiled
by Bloomberg show. Vipshop, which has quadrupled its market
value since its U.S. debut in March, followed Sina Corp. and
51Job Inc. in issuing a higher-than-projected sales forecast.  “We have pretty healthy expectations for company earnings
growth,” Marc Tommasi, head of global investment strategy at
Manning & Napier Advisors LLC, which manages $45 billion in
assets including Chinese equities, said by phone from Rochester,
New York Feb. 22. “The Chinese economy troughed in the third
quarter, a modest expansion is what’s in store.”  Bigger Than Dangdang  Vipshop, whose online store vipshop.com has been likened to
New York-based Gilt Groupe Inc.’s Gilt.com in the U.S., is
valued at $1.2 billion, compared with a market capitalization of
$268 million at the company’s March 23 initial public offering
in New York. It is now almost four times the size of  E-Commerce
China Dangdang Inc. (DANG) , the nation’s biggest online book retailer,
which is valued at $320.6 million, from $593 million in March,
data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Vipshop posted fourth-quarter net income of $6.3 million,
from a net loss of $63.5 million a year earlier. The mean of two
analysts’ estimates was for a $750,000 profit. Sales in the
quarter almost tripled to $299.6 million, and Vipshop forecast
first-quarter revenue of between $265 million to $270 million,
exceeding the analysts’ estimate of $211 million.  “Among the e-commerce companies in  China , Vipshop is one
of the few, or maybe the only one, that’s been able to prove
that they can grow very fast and still make money,” Jeff Papp,
a senior analyst at Oberweis Asset Management Inc., which
manages about $700 million of investments and invests in
Vipshop, said by phone from Lisle,  Illinois . “Vipshop has a
strong position in its niche market. Currently it works very
well with its suppliers so they don’t need to look elsewhere.”  ‘Extremely Competitive’  Vipshop’s American depositary shares rose the most Feb. 22
in two weeks. Trading volume in the ADS’ was almost seven times
the daily average over the past three months, data compiled by
Bloomberg show. Dangdang’s American depositary receipts slid 1.9
percent last week to $4.09, and are down 74 percent since the
company’s December 2010 IPO.  Dangdang, based in Beijing, got 66 percent of its sales
from books and other media products in the third quarter of
2012, according to a Nov. 15 statement. The company’s net loss
of 100.1 million  yuan  for the three months to Sept. 30 compared
with a loss of 73.4 million a year earlier. The company will
report sales of 1.63 billion yuan for the fourth quarter, while
the loss will widen to 130.9 million yuan, according to the mean
of five analysts’ projections compiled by Bloomberg.  “Dangdang’s main business is books and that’s extremely
competitive,” Papp said. “The branded merchandise that they
sell is just too small a part of their business.”  Share Offering  Vipshop intends to sell as much as $120 million of stock,
according to a Feb. 21  filing . The offer will involve both the
issuance of new shares as well as sales by existing private
investors, the company said.  The  iShares FTSE China 25 Index Fund (FXI) , the largest Chinese
 exchange-traded fund  in the U.S., was little changed at $38.54
in New York Feb. 22, declining 4.4 percent last week. Earnings
in the third quarter for companies on Bloomberg’s China-US
measure fell below analysts’ estimates by 9.1 percent, data
compiled by Bloomberg show.  Stocks on the gauge trade at 13.2 times  estimated earnings ,
compared with a multiple of 13.4 for the Standard & Poor’s 500
Index.  Elong Rally  Elong Inc. (LONG) , China’s second-largest online travel company,
climbed 7 percent to $16.26 in New York Feb. 22, the steepest
rally this month. The company’s ADRs added 0.7 percent last
week.  Elong, which earns 78 percent of its revenue from online
hotel bookings, said in a Feb. 21 statement that sales rose 33
percent to 224.4 million yuan ($36 million) in the fourth
quarter, after forecasting growth of 25 percent in November.
Profit declined to 5.7 million yuan from 15 million yuan a year
earlier. Revenue will increase by as much as 30 percent in the
first three months of this year, the company predicted.  The results “could be attributed to Elong’s consistent
strategy of investing in the online hotel booking business,”
Tian Hou, founder of T.H. Capital LLC, wrote in a note dated
Feb. 22, reiterating a hold recommendation on the stock.  Solar stocks were the biggest decliners on the China-US
index  last week  amid reports European Union member nations have
approved a plan to register solar panel imports from China.
 Trina Solar Ltd. (TSL) , based in Changzhou, lost 8.3 percent to $4.67,
while LDK Solar Co., the world’s second-largest maker of wafers
used to make solar cells, sank 6.9 percent to $1.75.  The  Hang Seng China Enterprises Index (HSCEI)  slid 1 percent to
11,317.13 Feb. 22 for a weekly loss of 4.5 percent, while the
Shanghai Composite Index of domestic Chinese shares dropped 0.5
percent to 2,314.16, dropping 4.9 percent last week.  To contact the reporter on this story:
