Dubai stocks rallied to the highest
level in more than three years as  Emaar Properties PJSC (EMAAR) ’s new
hotel project fueled bets revenue of the developer of the
world’s tallest skyscraper will grow this year.  Emaar surged 4.6 percent after the company said it would
build two luxury hotel and serviced apartment towers in central
Dubai.  Arabtec Holding Co. (ARTC) , the largest United Arab Emirates
builder by market value, rose to the highest level in almost
three weeks. The benchmark  DFM General Index (DFMGI)  gained 1.2 percent
to 1,945.95, the strongest close since November 2009.  “The assumption is that with growing confidence in U.A.E.
real estate, any new developments offered for sale will command
ever-increasing premiums,” said  Julian Bruce , Dubai-based head
of institutional trading at EFG-Hermes Holding SAE.  Emaar, which sold out the first phase of a separate luxury
hotel development last month, said it will accept offers in
Dubai and Riyadh on March 2 for The Address Residence Sky View
project. The city’s property market is recovering after prices
tumbled more than 65 percent from a 2008 high. The economy may
have expanded 5 percent in 2012, the fastest pace since 2007, as
tourism, hotel and restaurant industries pick up, government
forecasts show.  “Recent offerings have met with robust demand and with
multiple international launches this latest project is expected
to be extremely well-bid,” Bruce said.  Property Recovery  Dubai shares trade at an average  price-to-book value  of 0.8
times, compared with 1.8 times for stocks on  Saudi Arabia ’s
 Tadawul All Share Index, (SASEIDX)  the Persian Gulf’s largest bourse, data
compiled by Bloomberg show. The 31 companies on Dubai’s measure
trade at 11 times estimated 2013 earnings, compared with 11.3
times for the Saudi gauge.  Emaar surged to 5.26 dirhams, the highest since November
2008. The company’s board will meet tomorrow to discuss a full
year dividend after 2012 net income advanced 18 percent. Emaar’s
share price may rise to 6 dirhams as apartment sales pick up
amid increasing demand, HSBC Holdings Plc said earlier this
month.  Arabtec advanced 1.3 percent to 3.02 dirhams, the highest
level since Feb. 5.  The DFM General Index’s 14-day  relative strength index 
jumped to 75 today from 72 last week. A reading above 70
indicates to some analysts that a security or index is poised to
decline. About 209  million shares  were traded today, compared
with a 12-month daily average of 180 million shares.  Elsewhere in the  Middle East ,  Abu Dhabi ’s  ADX General Index (ADSMI) 
gained 0.2 percent. Saudi Arabia’s Tadawul All Share Index and
Bahrain’s  measure  were little changed. Oman’s MSM30 Index
declined 0.3 percent. In North Africa, Egypt’s benchmark EGX 30
Index lost 0.8 percent. Markets in Kuwait and Israel were closed
for holidays.  To contact the reporter on this story:
