The average price for regular
gasoline at U.S. pumps rose 20.32 cents a gallon in the past two
weeks to $3.795 a gallon, according to Lundberg Survey Inc.  The survey covers the period ended Feb. 22 and is based on
information obtained at about 2,500 filling stations by the
Camarillo, California-based company. The average has jumped
53.71 cents this year and is 10.33 cents above a year earlier.  “Although this is a steep rise, it’s not as steep as the
price rise during the prior two weeks,”  Trilby Lundberg ,
president of Lundberg Survey, said today in a phone interview.
“There’s reason to expect the price rise will not continue at
this pace and may even end soon because crude  oil prices  are
down and refiners are starting to cut wholesale prices to their
marketing and retail customers.”  Gasoline futures on the  New York Mercantile Exchange  rose
2.08 cents, or 0.7 percent, to $3.0796 a gallon in the past two
weeks. Futures have climbed 9.5 percent this year, the best
performer on the Standard & Poor’s GSCI index of 24 commodities.  U.S. gasoline stockpiles  fell 2.88 million barrels to
230.4 million in the week ended Feb. 15, according to the Energy
Information Administration. Refineries ran at 82.9 percent of
capacity, the lowest level since March, amid breakdowns and
seasonal plant maintenance.  West Texas Intermediate oil on the Nymex fell $2.59, or
2.7 percent, to $93.13 a barrel in the two weeks to Feb. 22.  Crude Inventories  Crude  inventories  rose 4.14 million barrels in the week
ended Feb. 15 to 376.4 million, the highest level since July,
according to data from the EIA, the Energy Department’s
statistics arm. Supplies at Cushing,  Oklahoma , the delivery
point for the Nymex futures contract, climbed 417,000 barrels to
50.7 million.  Oil may fall this week, a Bloomberg survey showed. Twenty
of 30 analysts, or 67 percent, forecast crude will drop through
March 1. Five respondents, or 17 percent, predicted a gain. Five
said there would be little change. Last week, 48 percent of
analysts projected a decrease.  The highest price in the lower 48 U.S. states among the
markets surveyed was in  Los Angeles , where the average was $4.29
a gallon, Lundberg said. The lowest price was in Billings,
 Montana , where customers paid an average of $3.23 a gallon.  Regular gasoline on  Long Island ,  New York , averaged $4.01 a
gallon, according to Lundberg.  To contact the reporters on this story:
