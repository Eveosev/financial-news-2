Defending champion  Hunter Mahan  will
face  Matt Kuchar  in today’s final of golf’s Match Play
Championship.  Mahan and Kuchar won their semifinals this morning 4-and-3,
meaning they each held an unassailable four-hole lead with three
holes remaining at The Golf Club on Dove Mountain in Marana,
Arizona. Mahan ousted  Ian Poulter  of England and Kuchar
eliminated Australian Jason Day.  Every winner on the U.S. PGA Tour this season has been
American, a streak that will continue after Mahan and Kuchar
advanced to the final.  The Match Play Championship, which carries a first prize of
$1.5 million, is the first of four annual World Golf
Championships events.  No. 1 seed Rory McIlroy and Tiger Woods, who was seeded
second overall, lost in the first round.  To contact the reporter on this story:
