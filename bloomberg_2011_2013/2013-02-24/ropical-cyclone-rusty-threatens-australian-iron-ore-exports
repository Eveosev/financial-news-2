Tropical cyclone  Rusty is expected
this week to slam into the northwestern coast of  Australia , the
world’s biggest exporter of iron ore, threatening to flood mines
and cut exports.  Rusty was upgraded to a Category 2 cyclone overnight and is
305 kilometers (190 miles) north of Port Hedland, the world’s
largest bulk export terminal, the Bureau of Meteorology said on
its website at 11:45 a.m. western standard time.  The Pilbara, where most of Australia’s iron ore is mined,
is home to  BHP Billiton Ltd. (BHP) , Rio Tinto Group and  Fortescue
Metals Group Ltd. (FMG) ’s mines, ports and rail lines. Port Hedland,
which ships ore from BHP and Fortescue’s mines, has closed, the
port authority said today in an e-mailed statement. Rio’s
Dampier and Cape Lambert iron ore shipping facilities are also
closing, the London-based company said.  Apache Corp. (APA) , a U.S.-based oil and gas producer, has shut
its Stag oil field as the cyclone nears, the company said today.  Further intensification is likely as Rusty approaches the
coast today and tomorrow and “there is a high risk that it will
cross the coast as a severe tropical cyclone,” the bureau said.
“Very heavy rainfall is expected in near coastal parts of the
eastern Pilbara and western Kimberley on Monday. During Tuesday
and Wednesday widespread very heavy rainfall is likely to lead
to major flooding.”  Rusty may bring rainfall of 400 millimeters (16 inches) to
600 millimeters this week, the port authority said in the
statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
