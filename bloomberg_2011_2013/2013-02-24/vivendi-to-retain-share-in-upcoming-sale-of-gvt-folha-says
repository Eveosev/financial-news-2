A sale of  Vivendi SA (VIV) ’s GVT phone
unit in Brazil could occur within weeks, and Vivendi will retain
a direct or indirect share in the company as part of the deal,
newspaper Folha de S.Paulo  reported .  The prospective deal has received approval from Brazil’s
government, Folha reported, without saying where it obtained the
information. In order meet Vivendi’s asking price of 19 billion
reais ($9.6 billion), both groups vying for GVT would ask the
French company to retain a stake, Folha said, citing
unidentified executives involved in the talks.  Direct TV (DTV) , based in El Segundo, Calif., has bid around 15
billion reais, Folha said. Under its offer, Vivendi would become
a partner in the American holding company and an indirect
shareholder in GVT, the newspaper reported. A lower offer from a
group of funds led by  KKR & Co. (KKR)  and including Rio de Janeiro-
based Gavea Investimentos Ltda involves Vivendi retaining a
direct share in GVT, Folha said.  The Folha article contained no comment from any of the
companies involved. A call to GVT from  Bloomberg News  wasn’t
immediately answered.  To contact the reporter on this story:
