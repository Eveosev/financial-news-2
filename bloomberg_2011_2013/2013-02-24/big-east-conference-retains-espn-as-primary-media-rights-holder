The  Big East  Conference reached an
agreement to retain  Walt Disney Co. (DIS) ’s ESPN Inc. as its primary
media rights holder, commissioner Mike Aresco said.  The U.S. college athletic conference declined to disclose
financial terms of the deal, which needs approval from the
presidents of its  member schools , who may vote this week. The
$130 million agreement covers seven years through the 2019-20
school year, ESPN reported, citing unidentified people familiar
with the transaction.  “ESPN has matched the third-party offer that the Big East
Conference received,” Aresco said yesterday in a statement.
“Subject to Big East board approval, ESPN and the Big East will
continue, for years to come, their long-term relationship, which
began in 1980.”  ESPN had one week to match an offer from NBC Sports Network
in order to keep the media rights.  “We look forward to continuing our relationship,” ESPN
said in a statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
