At least 28 Nascar fans were injured
at Daytona International Speedway yesterday when debris flew
into the grandstands after a car crashed on its final lap of a
Nationwide Series race, a prelude to today’s Daytona 500.  Fourteen people were transported off the property yesterday
and 14 were treated at the track’s on-site care center, Daytona
President Joie Chitwood said during a televised press conference.  Rookie Kyle Larson’s car had its front end shaved off with
the engine crashing into the stands and a tire flying into the
seats. Speedway crews repaired the fence and stands in
preparation for today’s Daytona 500.  “There obviously was some intrusion into the fence and
fortunately with the way the event’s equipped up, there were
plenty of emergency workers ready to go and they all jumped in
on it pretty quickly,” NASCAR President Mike Helton said in a
video on its website. “Right now, it’s just a function of
determining what all damage is done.”  Helton said emergency crews moved the injured fans to local
hospitals.  Regan Smith, leading the race at the time, tried to block
Brad Keselowski when the accident occurred. Larson’s car hit
Keselowski and went airborne. Larson emerged from his damaged
vehicle and stood on the track, hands on his hips.  “I was getting pushed from behind, I felt like, and by the
time my spotter said lift or go low, it was too late,” Larson
said during a Nascar video. “I took a couple big hits there and
saw my engine was gone. Just hope everybody’s all right.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
