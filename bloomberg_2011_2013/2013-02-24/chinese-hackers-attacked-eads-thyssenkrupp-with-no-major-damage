European Aeronautic Defence & Space
Co. and  ThyssenKrupp AG (TKA)  were attacked by Chinese hackers last
year, both companies said.  EADS reported the Chinese “standard attack, not remarkable
attack” to the German federal government,  Rainer Ohler , a
spokesman at the Toulouse, France-based company, said today by
phone. He declined to give details on any damage caused.  ThyssenKrupp, Germany’s largest steelmaker, today confirmed
a hacker attack in the U.S. from  China  in an e-mailed statement.
There were no findings of so-called “siphonings,” the Essen,
Germany-based company said.  China’s army may be behind a hacking group that has
attacked at least 141 companies worldwide since 2006, according
to a report on Feb. 19 by U.S. computer security firm Mandiant
Corp. China’s state-owned news agency said claims are “full of
loopholes.”  There were almost 1,100 cyberattacks by foreign
intelligence services on the German federal government last
year, Spiegel said. The German magazine reported the Chinese
attacks on EADS and ThyssenKrupp earlier today. The focus was on
the foreign and economy ministries and the chancellor’s office,
the magazine said, quoting  Germany ’s intelligence service.  To contact the reporter on this story:
