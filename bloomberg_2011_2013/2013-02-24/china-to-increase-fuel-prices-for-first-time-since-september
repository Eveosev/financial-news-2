China  will raise fuel prices for the
first time since September amid a gain in oil benchmarks since
the start of the year.  Gasoline will increase by 300  yuan  ($48) a metric ton and
diesel by 290 yuan a ton effective tomorrow, the National
Development and Reform Commission said in a statement on its
website today.  The pump price of 90-RON, China III gasoline in Beijing
will rise 3.1 percent to 10,030 yuan a ton, or $4.55 a U.S.
gallon, according to Bloomberg calculations from NDRC data. The
price for North Sea Brent crude has increased by 2.7 percent
this year, while U.S West Texas Intermediate added 1.4 percent
in the period.  “According to recent development in international  oil
prices , we decided to increase finished oil product prices,”
the NDRC said. The government will continue to subsidize the
farming and public transportation industries to offset the
impact of costlier fuel, it said.  This is the first increase in Chinese fuel prices since
September, when the NDRC increased gasoline by 550 yuan per ton
and diesel prices by 540 yuan. The government cut gasoline by
310 yuan and diesel by 300 yuan in November.  Gasoline and diesel prices are set by the NDRC under a
system that tracks the 22-day moving average of a basket of
crudes comprising Brent, Dubai and  Indonesia ’s Cinta. The
government may adjust fuel rates when the measure changes more
than 4 percent from the last modification. It has increased 4.73
percent since prices were cut on Nov. 16.  The NDRC adjusted fuel prices eight times in 2012, raising
them four times and cutting them four times.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
