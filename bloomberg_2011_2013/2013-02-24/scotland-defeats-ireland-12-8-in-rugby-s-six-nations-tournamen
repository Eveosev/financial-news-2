Scotland  beat Ireland 12-8 to get
back-to-back wins in rugby’s Six Nations for the first time in
12 years and keep alive its championship challenge.  All Scotland’s points came from penalties by scrum-half
Greig Laidlaw yesterday at Murrayfield Stadium in Edinburgh.
Ireland, which had 71 percent of the possession and spent more
than three-quarters of the match in the opposition half, had led
8-0 after fly-half Paddy Jackson kicked a penalty and winger
Craig Gilroy got the only try of the game.  “My neck was getting sore looking at one side of the
pitch,” Scotland interim head coach Scott Johnson said in
comments on the tournament’s website. “We showed some great
resolve and great character, but we have to be honest and say
that was not perfect from us.”  By following up its 34-10 win against  Italy  on Feb. 9,
Scotland secured successive victories in Europe’s annual
international rugby championship for the first time since 2001.
The Scots join  Wales , who they host in the next round on March
9, with four points in the standings, two fewer than  England  in
first place.  England stayed on course for a so-called Grand Slam sweep
of its European rivals two days ago by defeating  France  23-13.
Wales beat Italy 26-9.  Ireland and Italy each have two points, with France in last
place following three straight defeats.  To contact the reporter on this story:
