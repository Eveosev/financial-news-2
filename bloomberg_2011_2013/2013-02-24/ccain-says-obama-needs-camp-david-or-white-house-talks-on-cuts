U.S. Senator John McCain, a
Republican of Arizona, said President  Barack Obama  should hold
talks with lawmakers at Camp David or the White House to avoid
spending cuts set to take effect March 1.  “I won’t put all the blame on the president of the United
States,” McCain said on CNN television’s “ State of the Union ”
broadcast today when asked about the looming reductions. “But
the president leads. The president should be calling us over
somewhere, Camp David, the White House somewhere, and us sitting
down and trying to avert these cuts.”  If Congress doesn’t act, federal spending will be reduced
by $85 billion in the final seven months of this fiscal year and
by $1.2 trillion over the next nine years. By the end of 2013,
inaction would lower the gross domestic product by 0.6 percent
and cost 750,000 jobs, according to the non-partisan
Congressional Budget Office.  McCain is a senior member of the Senate Armed Services
Committee.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
