Most  New Zealand  consumers expect
 house prices  to rise in the next 12 months as buyers spurred by
low  interest rates  face a shortage of properties.  Sixty-six percent of respondents in a January survey
expected values will increase over the next year compared with
64 percent in October, ASB Bank Ltd. said in an e-mailed report.
The proportion expecting lower prices was unchanged at 8 percent.  “Listings remain low and have not kept up with the modest
increase in demand,” Auckland-based ASB Chief Economist  Nick Tuffley  said in the report. “Housing inventory levels have
fallen sharply and the market is tilted in favor of sellers.”  The  Reserve Bank  of New Zealand is considering ways to
contain the nation’s “over-heating” housing market, Governor
Graeme Wheeler said in a speech last week, as the official cash
rate remains at a record-low 2.5 percent. Thirty-two percent of
respondents expect higher borrowing costs over the next year and
39 percent predict no change, the survey showed.  Tuffley is among nine economists who forecast the central
bank will maintain the current cash rate until at least the end
of the year, according to a survey of 16 analysts by  Bloomberg
News  last week. Seven predict a rate rise by then.  House prices  rose 7.2 percent in January from a year
earlier, the Real Estate Institute said Feb. 12. In Auckland,
home to a third of the nation’s 4.4 million people, values
surged 11.8 percent amid a shortage of new listings.  To contact the reporter on this story:
