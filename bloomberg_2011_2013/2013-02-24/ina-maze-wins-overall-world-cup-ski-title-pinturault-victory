Tina Maze  of Slovenia won the
women’s overall World Cup ski title after clinching the super-
combined event in Meribel, France, today.  Second-placed Maria Hoefl-Riesch of Germany, who fell in
the slalom section, cannot now overhaul Maze in the standings in
the remaining nine events.  Alexis Pinturault of France won the men’s giant slalom
World Cup event at Garmisch-Partenkirchen, Germany. Austria’s
Marcel Hirscher kept his lead in the overall standings.  Pinturault was 0.6 second quicker than Hirscher over the
two runs. Ted Ligety of the U.S. came third and still leads the
giant slalom category.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
