Lithuania ’s  Labor Party , led by
Russian-born millionaire Viktor Uspaskich, plans to merge with
the movement of impeached ex-President Rolandas Paksas to form
the Baltic nation’s largest political party.  The councils of the two parties each approved today the
goal of completing the project in April, Uspaskich and Paksas,
who heads the Order & Justice movement, told reporters at
Parliament in the capital, Vilnius.  Order & Justice, part of a four-party coalition formed
after elections in October, and the Labor Party have a combined
39 seats in Lithuania’s 141-member parliament. Prime Minister
Algirdas Butkevicius’s Social Democrats have 38 seats.  Uspaskich and Paksas said they wouldn’t seek any changes in
the Cabinet even if their influence on government decision-
making increased.  “Integration will allow us to achieve our goals with
bigger and faster impulse,” Uspaskich said. “We both support
balancing social needs with an attractive business climate.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
