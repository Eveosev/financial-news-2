The jersey Mike Eruzione wore when
he scored the winning goal in the 1980 U.S. Olympic ice hockey
team’s victory over the Soviet Union sold yesterday for $657,250.  The jersey was part of a larger auction in Manhattan, which
included the blue jersey Eruzione wore in the Gold medal game
against  Finland , as well as the stick, gloves and pants he wore
against  Russia . In total the auctions, which ended two days
after the 33rd anniversary of the historic victory, garnered
$2.3 million.  The final bid for the jersey was $529,086, with the total
price including a 19.5 percent buyer’s premium of $128,164. The
stick used to score the winning goal was sold for $262,900.  Eruzione, who captained the “Miracle on Ice” squad, said
in December he wanted to raise money to help his family.  The auction for the jersey opened online and concluded
yesterday with live bidding at Dallas-based Heritage Auctions’
New York Sports Platinum Night Auction in  Manhattan .  Eight bidders, including the winner at yesterday’s floor
session, participated in the jersey auction. The auction was
expected to garner at least $1 million, according to a release
on the Heritage website.  Eruzione, 58, said in December he would auction the items
to raise money for his three children. Some proceeds will also
go to the Winthrop Foundation, which he founded to help local
causes in his home town of Winthrop,  Massachusetts , according to
the release.  “I’m not broke,” Eruzione said prior to the auction.
“All is well.”  Eruzione has worked at Boston University, where he attended
college, for the past 20 years, while also making appearances as
a motivational speaker. He  charges  $25,000 for keynote speeches.  The victory by the U.S. squad made up of college players
over the Soviet Union, a team that had won the previous four
Olympic hockey gold medals and outscored the U.S. 28-7 over that
stretch, was voted Sports Illustrated magazine’s top sports
moment of the 20th century.  To contact the reporter on this story:
