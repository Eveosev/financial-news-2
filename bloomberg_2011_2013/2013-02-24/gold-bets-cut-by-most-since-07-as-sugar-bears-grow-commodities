Hedge funds  cut bets on a rally in
gold by the most since 2007 and became the most bearish ever on
sugar and coffee as concern that the  Federal Reserve  will slow
U.S. stimulus programs drove prices for raw materials to the
biggest loss this year.  Money managers and other large speculators reduced their
net-long  position  in gold futures and options by 40 percent in
the week ended Feb. 19 to 42,318, the biggest drop since July
31, 2007, U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission data show.
Wagers across 18 U.S. raw materials tumbled to the lowest since
December 2011 as investors’ net-short positions for sugar and
coffee hit record highs. Bullish corn wagers fell the most since
June 2010.  Global holdings of exchange-traded  products  backed by gold
tumbled 1.6 percent last week, the most since August 2011, after
minutes of a Fed policy meeting showed several officials said
the central bank should be ready to vary the pace of their
monthly bond purchases. The Standard & Poor’s GSCI Spot Index of
24 commodities sank 2.6 percent, the most since Dec. 7. The
gauge surged 85 percent in the four years through Dec. 31 as the
Fed expanded its balance sheet to more than $3 trillion.  “The expectations and rhetoric out of the Fed about an
exit strategy has spooked people, making them think the Fed is
going to tighten stimulus,” James Dailey, who manages $215
million at TEAM Financial Asset Management LLC in Harrisburg,
 Pennsylvania , said in a telephone interview. “There’s a
confluence of weak gold owners, and people who don’t have a
strong conviction about owning gold.”  Commodities Slide  The GSCI Index has dropped 2.5 percent in February, heading
for the biggest monthly loss since October. The MSCI All-Country
World Index of equities slid 1 percent, while the dollar
advanced 3.2 percent against a basket of six trading partners.
Treasuries rose 0.2 percent, a Bank of America Corp. index
shows.  Many Fed policymakers “expressed some concerns about
potential costs and risks arising from further asset
purchases,” according to the minutes of the latest Federal Open
Market Committee meeting released Feb. 20. The central bank is
purchasing $85 billion a month in debt, putting it on track to
expand its record $3.08 trillion balance sheet by $1.02 trillion
this year.  Fed Governor Jerome Powell said Feb. 22 the central bank
could revise its plan to eventually sell the securities acquired
during its large-scale asset purchases, both to avoid causing
financial instability and taking losses on its sales. Fed
Governor  Jeremy Stein  said this month some credit markets,
including leveraged loans and  junk bonds , show signs of
potentially excessive risk-taking. In 2007, the central bank
held less than $900 billion in assets.  China Imports  China’s demand for commodities will continue to support
prices as the country imports more energy, metals and grains,
according to Adrian Day, who manages about $170 million of
assets as the president of Adrian Day Asset Management in
Annapolis,  Maryland .  China bought 410,000 metric tons of soybeans from the U.S.,
the Department of Agriculture said on Feb. 22. The Asian nation
has a “structural shortage” of grain because demand continues
to rise, Minister of Agriculture Han Changfu said in a statement
posted on the central government website on Feb. 21. Imports of
copper rose 2.9 percent in January from December, customs data
showed Feb. 8.  In  Brazil , a record backlog at the Port of Santos may delay
shipments of soybeans, corn, wheat, rice and sugar to  China . The
country’s ports have 192 ships waiting to load 10.8 million tons
of commodities, compared with 90 ships waiting to load 4.1
million tons a year earlier, researcher SA Commodities said Feb.
22.  Agriculture Demand  “I track a lot of shipping into China, and they can’t get
enough to meet their demand for agriculture,” said Jeffrey Sica, who helps oversee more than $1 billion of assets as the
president and chief investment officer of Sica Wealth Management
LLC in Morristown,  New Jersey . “There’s this whole sentiment
around the funds selling off, but the demand is still very much
there.”  Money managers took $828 million from commodity funds in
the week ended Feb. 20, said  Cameron Brandt , the director of
research for Cambridge, Massachusetts-based EPFR Global, which
tracks money flows. Outflows from gold and precious-metals funds
totaled $870 million, the seventh straight week of net
withdrawals, the longest stretch since first quarter of 2011, he
said.  Copper Wagers  Wagers on a rally for copper tumbled 51 percent to 11,413
contracts, the lowest since investors were betting on a decline
in November, the CFTC data show. Bullish silver holdings slumped
34 percent, the biggest drop since June.  A measure of net-longs for 11 U.S. farm goods plunged 44
percent to 190,892 contracts, the lowest since March 2009, the
CFTC data show.  Investors are holdings a net-short position, or bets on a
decline, of 57,073 contracts in  sugar , and are net-short by
28,454 contracts for coffee. Both outlooks are the most negative
since at least June 2006, when the government data begins.  Last week, stockpiles of coffee at warehouses monitored by
ICE Futures U.S. rose to the highest since March 2010. In the 12
months starting Oct. 1, world sugar output may exceed demand for
a third consecutive year, according to Macquarie Group Ltd.  Bullish corn positions plunged 48 percent to 65,303
contracts, the biggest drop since June 29, 2010. Bets on a
soybean rally slid 5.4 percent, the second straight decline.
Investors increased their wheat net-short holding to 49,223
contracts, the most bearish since May.  Corn Production  The USDA said last week that corn production will rise 35
percent to 14.53 billion bushels in the year that starts on Aug.
31, and stockpiles will more than triple to 2.177 billion
bushels. Soybean inventories will double as domestic production
will jump 13 percent, the agency said.  “With these big crops, that’s an indication that supply
concerns will be lessened,” said  Donald Selkin , who helps
manage about $3 billion as chief market strategist at National
Securities Corp. in  New York . “If there’s no weather concerns,
corn and soybean prices are going to go down.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
