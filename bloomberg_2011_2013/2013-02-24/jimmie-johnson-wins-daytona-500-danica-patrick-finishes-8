Jimmie Johnson held off Dale Earnhardt Jr. to win the Daytona 500 for a second time as Danica Patrick finished eighth to secure the best result for a female
driver in the 55-year history of Nascar’s marquee race.  Twelve months ago, Johnson crashed after completing just
one lap at Daytona International Speedway in Daytona,  Florida .  Yesterday, the five-time Sprint Cup winner took the lead
for good on lap 191, pulled away from Brad Keselowski on the
final restart with six laps left in the 200-lap event and
withstood challenges from runner-up Earnhardt and third-place
finisher Mark Martin to win “The Great American Race.”  “I feel like the speed our car had in it allowed me to
really have control of the race there late,” said Johnson,
whose team received $1.5 million for the win. “I felt like I
was sitting on something all day and was just ready to have some
fun when it counted, and it did.”  Patrick, the first woman to start from the pole position
for a race in Nascar’s top series, remained in the top 10 for
most of the day in improving on her 38th-place finish in her
Daytona 500 debut last year.  The best previous Daytona 500 finish for a woman was by
Janet Guthrie, who placed 11th in 1980 and was 12th in 1977.
Shawna Robinson, the only other woman to compete in the race,
finished 24th in 2002. Patrick had been in third place with just
over a lap remaining yesterday.  “It was a solid day,” Patrick said. “We stayed basically
in the top 10 all day long, so you can’t really complain about
that.”  The last driver to win the Daytona 500 from the pole
position was Dale Jarrett in 2000.  Fence Repairs  The Daytona 500 was held a day after more than 30
spectators were injured at the racetrack when Kyle Larson’s car
crashed through a barrier and sent debris into the crowd.  Workers had finished repairing a 54-foot (16.5 meter) wide
section of fencing at midnight, just hours before the race
started with Patrick on the pole.  Jeff Gordon, who began the race second on the grid, passed
Patrick’s  Chevrolet  on the first of 200 laps. Gordon, the 1997,
1999 and 2005 champion, has now held a lead during 17 of his 21
starts at the Daytona 500.  Johnson’s Chevrolet took the lead for the first time on lap
33 after a six-car pile-up brought about the third caution of
the race.  Two-time winner Matt Kenseth claimed first place on lap 38
and held it until he made a pit stop on lap 71 along with
Johnson and Patrick. Kenseth led four times for a total of 86
laps, the most of any driver, before dropping out with 51 laps
remaining as smoke vented from his car.  Patrick’s Lead  Patrick moved back in front on lap 90 before dropping back
to third place at the halfway stage. Kenseth led again through
126 laps, when Patrick moved briefly back into first place
before making a pit stop with 70 laps to go.  “It was nice to lead later on in the race, just to have
done that,” Patrick said.  The leaders made their final pit stops on lap 172, leaving
Keselowski, the 2012 Sprint Cup champion, in first place with 25
laps to race. Scott Speed became the 13th driver to lead the
race on lap 178 as Jeff Burton hit the wall to bring about the
fifth caution with Patrick in sixth place.  Racing resumed with 19 laps to go and Patrick immediately
moved up to third place behind Keselowski and Biffle. Johnson
and Denny Hamlin moved down the inside to drop Patrick back to
fifth place with 15 laps remaining.  Johnson went ahead with nine laps to go before racing was
suspended by the sixth caution. When racing resumed with six
laps to go, Johnson maintained his lead over Keselowski.  A final-lap crash wasn’t significant enough to halt racing,
as Patrick failed to keep pace with her rivals and Johnson held
on to become the 10th multiple winner of the race.  “For me the defining moment in the race was the caution
coming out and the 48 being ahead of the 2,” Johnson said of
his car staying in front of Keselowski. “That gave me lane
choice and really control of the race in the closing laps.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
