Iranian president  Mahmoud Ahmadinejad  said crude oil revenue has dropped because of
international sanctions.  “The country will try to compensate for the decline in oil
revenue by cutting spending and increasing taxes in the next
Iranian year,” Ahmadinejad said in a speech aired on state
television yesterday.  “This was a difficult year for our economy,” he said.  Ahmadinejad said he will present the budget for the next
Iranian year, which begins March 21, to parliament on Feb. 27.  To contact the reporter on this story:
