New York Yankees outfielder  Curtis Granderson  will miss the first month of Major League Baseball’s
regular season after fracturing a bone in his right forearm
during his first spring training at-bat.  Granderson, who hit a team-leading 43 home runs last season,
was injured when he was hit by a pitch from J.A. Happ of the
Toronto Blue Jays yesterday in Tampa, Florida.  “It’s definitely tough,” Granderson said in a televised
interview. “Mind and body were feeling great, looking forward
to getting spring training going. Five pitches in, we have to go
and alter everything a little bit, but it’s just a little bump
in the road. It’s definitely not the end of everything.”  The Yankees said Granderson would be out for 10 weeks,
meaning he’d probably be able to return during the first week of
May. The Yankees open their regular-season schedule on April 1
against the Boston Red Sox.  Granderson, 31, batted .232 with 106 runs batted in and 102
runs scored for the Yankees last season.  During his absence, Matt Diaz, Juan Rivera and Zoile
Almonte will probably compete for more playing time alongside
starting outfielders Ichiro Suzuki and  Brett Gardner .
Outfielders  Nick Swisher ,  Raul Ibanez  and  Andruw Jones  were
among those to leave the Yankees during the offseason.  “You keep your body ready to go, and mentally stay
focused,” Granderson said. “I’m always looking forward to the
season, so that’s not going to change. It just might be a little
different start date, that’s all.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
