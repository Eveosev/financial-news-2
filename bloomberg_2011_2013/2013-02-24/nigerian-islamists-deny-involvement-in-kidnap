The Nigerian militant Islamic group
Boko Haram said it has no links with the kidnappers of French
tourists in Republic of  Cameroon .  “We have nothing to do with the French people or their
abductors,” Sheikh Ibn Abdulazeez, spokesman of the group, told
reporters in the northern city of Maiduguri.  Seven French tourists including four children, were seized
on Feb. 19 at the village of Dabanga in neighboring Cameroon.
The tourists were taken across the border into neighboring
Nigeria, said Eloi Gabriel Essoa, a local official in Cameroon.  To contact the reporter on this story:
