Hunter Mahan  and  Ian Poulter 
advanced to the semifinals of the World Golf Championship Match
Play Championship.  Defending champion Mahan topped Webb Simpson 1-up yesterday
after the start of the third round was delayed for 45 minutes
because of frost at The Golf Club at Dove Mountain in Marana,
 Arizona . Poulter, from the U.K., beat Steve Stricker 3 & 2.  “It’s like a final round in each match, especially right
now, when you get closer and closer (to the end),” Mahan said
in a televised interview. “It’s exciting at the same time.”  Matt Kuchar  beat Robert Garrigus 3 & 2 to reach the second
semifinal against Jason Day who defeated Graeme McDowell 1-up.  “I got off to a nice lead and then I stumbled a little bit
there kind of three-quarters into the round and kind of felt
like we were back in a battle again,” Kuchar said. “I was
pretty excited to hit some good shots on 14, 15 and 16 to be
able to close him out and be able to hopefully go home soon and
get some rest.”  Kuchar and Mahan are trying to extend a streak in which
every PGA Tour winner this year has been American.  To contact the reporter on this story:
