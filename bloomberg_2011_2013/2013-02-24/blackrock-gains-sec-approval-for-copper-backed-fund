BlackRock Inc. (BLK)  won U.S. regulatory
approval for an exchange-traded fund backed by physical copper,
which some industrial users said may disrupt the market for the
metal.  The Securities and Exchange Commission approved the
proposed rule change by NYSE Arca Inc. to list BlackRockâ€™s
iShares Copper Trust, the regulator said on its website in a
 notice  dated Feb. 22. JPMorgan Chase & Co. won regulatory
approval in December for its planned ETF, which would be the
first U.S. exchange-traded fund backed linked to copper.  A group of industrial copper consumers including AmRod
Corp., Southwire Co. and  Encore Wire Corp. (WIRE)  have opposed plans
for copper ETFs, saying funds backed by copper would leave less
of the metal available for manufacturers, creating shortages and
driving up prices.  ETF Securities Ltd. also has said its plans to start
physically backed ETFs for industrial metals in the U.S.  To contact the reporter on this story:
