IC Companys A/S, Denmarkâ€™s largest
publicly traded clothing company, said it sold garments with
excessive chemical residues between 2009 and 2011.  IC Companys failed to comply with a Danish legal
requirement to inform authorities and customers about the
garments, which it recalled, the company said in a statement on
its website today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
