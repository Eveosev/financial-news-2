One farmer was shot dead and at
least four injured in  Burkina Faso  after they tried removing
cotton from another grower’s field, said Gilbert Kabore, a
spokesman for state cotton company Societe Burkinabe des Fibres
Textiles, known as Sofitex.  The farmer killed supported a boycott by about 8,000
producers nationwide against planting the crop to protest a
government plan to raise fertilizer prices and cap the amount
growers were paid for their produce after world prices soared to
a record on March 7. Burkina Faso is sub-Saharan  Africa ’s
biggest grower of the crop.  The farmers “went to extract the plants in the farms of
one of the producers who didn’t support the boycott,” Kabore
said by phone from Bobo Dioulasso, 360 kilometers (223 miles)
west of the capital, Ouagadougou. “When they arrived, the owner
shot him and hurt the others.” The shooting took place 200
kilometers from Ouagadougou.  The shooter has been arrested by police for investigation,
Kabore said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
