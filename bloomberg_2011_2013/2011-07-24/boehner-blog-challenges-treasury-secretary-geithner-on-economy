House Speaker  John Boehner  took
issue with Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner’s statement today
on “Fox News Sunday” that the economy is “absolutely” in
better shape that it was three months ago.  “On the economy, it’s Secretary Geithner vs. reality, and
reality is winning,” the Ohio Republican said in a message sent
out by Twitter.  An  item  posted by aide Michael Ricci on Boehner’s website
noted that job growth slowed in June compared with March, and
that the  unemployment rate  has risen to 9.2 percent. The posting
said that various economic indicators reflect an economy that
isn’t improving relative to this spring, including lower
consumer confidence.  To contact the reporter on this story:
