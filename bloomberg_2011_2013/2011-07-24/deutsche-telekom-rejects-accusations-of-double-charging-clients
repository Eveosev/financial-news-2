Deutsche Telekom AG (DTE)  rejected
accusations reported by Spiegel that it double-charged clients
for database costs.  The German phone company is accused of double-charging over
several years, Spiegel reported, citing a complaint filed to the
prosecutor’s office in Bonn. The alleged behavior amounted to
proceeds in the “three-digit millions of euros,” the German
magazine said in an e-mailed summary of a story.  “We decisively reject the accusations,” Christian Schwolow, a spokesman for Deutsche Telekom, said in an e-mailed
response to questions from Bloomberg News today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
