Iran  will sign a $10 billion
contract tomorrow to export natural gas to Iraq and  Syria , the
Oil Ministry said on its news website, citing remarks yesterday
by Javad Owji, National Iranian Gas Co.’s managing director.  The gas will be shipped from the South Pars field via a new
pipeline route that may take three to five years to build and
will be mapped once the agreement has been signed, according to
the report on the  Shana  website.  Iran and Syria signed a preliminary agreement on Jan. 19
for the construction of a 2,000-kilometer (1,250-mile) network
to carry Iranian gas via a 56-inch (142-centimeter) pipeline.  Iran holds the world’s second-largest gas reserves. The
Shama report didn’t disclose details of the contract.  To contact the reporter on this story:
