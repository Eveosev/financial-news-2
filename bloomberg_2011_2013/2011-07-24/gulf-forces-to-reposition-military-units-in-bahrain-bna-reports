Gulf Arab Peninsula Shield forces
will reposition in Bahrain by replacing “certain military
units” in the country,  Bahrain News Agency  said, citing an
unidentified official with the Bahrain Defense Force.  The replacement of these military units “is a routine
operation,” the official Manama-based news service reported
yesterday.  Saudi Arabia  and other Gulf Arab states sent security
forces to Bahrain in March to quell anti-government protests led
by the island nation’s Shiite-Muslim majority. Many of Bahrain’s
Shiites have complained of discrimination by the country’s
ruling Sunnis.  To contact the reporter on this story:
