Manchester United manager  Alex
Ferguson  is considering a move for Newcastle midfielder  Joey
Barton , the Sunday Times reported, without saying where it got
the information.  Barton, 29, is in the last year of his contract and may be
available for 2 million pounds ($3.3 million), the newspaper
said. The player’s agent, Willie Mackay, has already lined up
four European clubs, including Roma and Deportivo La Coruna, if
Barton runs down his contract, the Times added.  Barton was refused a visa to join Newcastle on its pre-
season U.S. tour because of a conviction for assault in 2008.
The Times said Barton has become teetotal and cited Newcastle
manager  Alan Pardew  as saying the player has “put his life back
on track.”  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
