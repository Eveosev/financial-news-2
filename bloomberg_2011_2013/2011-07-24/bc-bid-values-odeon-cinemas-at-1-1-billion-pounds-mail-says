BC Partners  Ltd., a private-equity
company, has put in a bid for the operating business of Odeon
Cinemas Group Ltd., owned by Terra Firma Capital Partners Ltd.,
valuing it at 1.1 billion pounds ($1.8 billion),  the Mail on
Sunday  reported, without citing anyone.  Terra Firma, owned by  Guy Hands , rejected the bid,
according to the newspaper. London-based BC Partners, which had
bid for the U.K. movie-theater chain with the private-equity arm
of Ontario Municipal Employees Retirement System, a Canadian
pension fund known as Omers, may make a higher offer for Odeon,
the Mail on Sunday said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
