Vietnam  will maintain a tight
monetary policy in August after inflation accelerated for an
11th month in July, Nguyen Xuan Phuc, chairman of the government
office, said at a briefing in Hanoi today.  Consumer prices jumped 22.16 percent from a year earlier,
compared with June’s 20.82 percent pace, data released by the
General Statistics Office yesterday show. That’s the highest
inflation rate tracked by Bloomberg among 17 economies in Asia.  Inflationary pressures are still high, Nguyen Dong Tien,
deputy governor of the nation’s central bank, said at the same
meeting and Nguyen Tien Thoa, head of price control at the
 finance ministry , said “there are still risks that would affect
the economy and prices from now to the end of the year.”  State Bank  of Vietnam will continue managing credit for
“non-production business” as part of measures to curb rising
prices, Tien said. Banks must restrict lending to sectors that
invest in stock and property markets to 22 percent of loans by
June 30, and to 16 percent by the year-end, he reiterated.  Prime Minister Nguyen Tan Dung said in February that he
aims to curb credit growth to less than 20 percent this year
from an earlier target of 23 percent. He also intends to narrow
the  budget deficit  to below 5 percent of gross domestic product
and cap the jump in  money supply  at 15 to 16 percent in 2011.  --Nguyen Kieu Giang. Editor: Ravil Shirodkar  To contact the Bloomberg News staff on this story:
