Japanese stock futures fell as the
failure to raise the U.S. federal debt limit intensified concern
of a default that may threaten the global economic recovery.
Australian stock future rose after oil and metal prices advanced.  American depositary receipts of Honda Motor Co., a Japanese
carmaker that gets about 85 percent of its sales abroad, slid
0.4 percent from the closing share price in Tokyo. Komatsu Ltd.,
a construction machinery maker fell 1.9 percent. ADRs of
Woodside Petroleum Ltd., Australia’s No. 2 oil and gas producer,
advanced 0.4 percent.  Futures on the  Nikkei 225 (NKY)  Stock Average expiring in
September closed at 10,135 in  Chicago  on July 22, compared with
10,140 in Osaka,  Japan . They were bid in the pre-market at
10,100 in Osaka, at 8:05 a.m. local time. Futures on Australia’s
S&P/ASX 200 Index rose 0.1 percent today. New Zealand’s NZX 50
Index was little changed in Wellington.  “The outcome of U.S. debt talks was one of the big
concerns for investors, so this will trigger a mini sell-off in
stock markets,” said Prasad Patkar, who helps manage the
equivalent of $1.7 billion at Sydney-based Platypus Asset
Management Ltd. “Failure to reach a debt deal would jeopardize
the U.S.’s credit rating, and this has the potential to cause a
seizure in global credit markets.”  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index fell 0.7 percent
today. House Speaker  John Boehner  told Republicans that there’s
no agreement on a plan for raising the U.S. debt ceiling before
a default threatened for Aug. 2. A Republican congressional
official said Boehner, speaking by telephone to lawmakers, is
reporting that discussions are continuing. The impasse has
boosted the chance S&P Ratings Service will cut the U.S. credit
rating from AAA within three months to 50 percent, the company
said July 21.  Dollar Falls  The dollar weakened against the yen, Swiss franc and euro
as Republicans prepared to force action on a shorter-term
extension of the U.S. debt limit than President  Barack Obama  has
requested, defying a veto threat. The greenback touched a four-
month low of 78.12 yen today, compared with 78.60 at the close
of  stock trading  on July 22, cutting the value of some overseas
income at Japanese companies when repatriated.  In  Europe ,  Fitch Ratings  said on July 22  Greece  will be
considered a “restricted default” after the 159 billion-euro
($229 billion) European bailout unveiled a day earlier, given
the plan includes getting bondholders to assume part of the cost.  The yen appreciated to as high as 111.66 against the euro
today in Tokyo, compared with 113.25 at the close of stock
trading on July 22.  Oil Gains  On July 22, the S&P rose 0.1 percent in  New York  as
technology companies rallied on improving earnings.  Crude oil for September delivery gained 0.8 percent to
$99.87 a barrel in New York on July 22, the highest settlement
since June 9. The London Metal Exchange Index of prices for six
metals including copper and aluminum advanced 0.5 percent on
July 22.  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index rose 1 percent this year
through July 22, compared with a gain of 7 percent by the  S&P
500  and a drop of 1.4 percent by the Stoxx Europe 600 Index.
Stocks in the Asian benchmark are valued at 13.8 times estimated
earnings on average, compared with 13.5 times for the S&P 500
and 11.1 times for the Stoxx 600.  To contact the reporters on this story:
