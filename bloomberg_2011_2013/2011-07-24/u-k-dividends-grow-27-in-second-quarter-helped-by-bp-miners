Dividends in the U.K. grew 27
percent in the second quarter as  BP Plc (BP/) , the nation’s second-
biggest oil company, resumed payments and the  mining industry 
increased theirs almost fourfold.  Payouts to shareholders by British companies increased to
19.1 billion pounds ($31 billion) in the three months through
June from 15 billion pounds in the year-earlier period, Capita
Registrars said in an e-mailed statement today, citing data from
Exchange Data International. That still trails the 22 billion
pounds paid in both 2007 and 2008.  Excluding the cancellation of BP’s dividend after the Gulf
of Mexico oil spill, which would have been worth 1.8 billion
pounds in the second quarter of 2010, payments have grown for
five consecutive quarters, Capita said. Mining companies had the
biggest increase in payouts last quarter, with a 276 percent
increase, thanks to the boom in commodity prices. The biggest
contribution came from  Antofagasta Plc (ANTO) , which had a 540 million-
pound special dividend.  “Dividends are finally flowing freely again,” Charles Cryer, chief executive officer of Capita Registrars, said in the
statement. “Finance directors may have relaxed their iron grip
on corporate cash piles as the financial crisis has abated, but
looming sovereign debt collapses in the  euro zone  may cause a
renewed banking squeeze, leaving dividends back at the mercy of
a need by companies to preserve cash.”  Energy, Media  Payouts from what Capita called “cyclical” industries,
including energy, media and retailing, grew 35 percent, while
“defensive” companies such as utilities, aerospace and tobacco
climbed 13 percent. Some 247 companies started paying or
increased dividends in the quarter, compared with 221 in the
same period last year.  Capita increased its U.K. dividend forecast for 2011 to 66
billion pounds from 64.2 billion pounds three months ago. That
would give the benchmark  FTSE 100 Index (UKX)  a dividend yield of 3.6.  ARM Holdings Plc, GlaxoSmithKline Plc and LVMH Moet
Hennessy Louis Vuitton SA may be among 29 companies in the Stoxx
Europe 600 Index to increase their dividends this week,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
