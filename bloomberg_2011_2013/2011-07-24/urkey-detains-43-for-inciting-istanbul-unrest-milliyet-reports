Turkish police arrested 43 people in
Istanbul for inciting unrest and damaging property in a series
of attacks in the Zeytinburnu neighborhood last week, Milliyet
reported.  The people arrested are alleged to have spread rumors to
provoke Turks and Kurds, sparking street battles and attacks on
businesses, homes and vehicles in  Turkey ’s largest city between
July 18 and July 22, the Istanbul-based newspaper  said . A police
investigation uncovered weapons, drugs and organizational
documents, according to the newspaper.  The unrest began after 20 people, including 13 Turkish
soldiers, were killed in a July 14 clash between the military
and the Kurdistan Workers’ Party, or PKK. The PKK is designated
as a terrorist organization by Turkey, the U.S. and the European
Union.  To contact the reporter on this story:
