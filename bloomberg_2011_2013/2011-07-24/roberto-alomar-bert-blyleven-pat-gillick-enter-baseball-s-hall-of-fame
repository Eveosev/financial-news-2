Roberto Alomar and Bert Blyleven were inducted into the  National Baseball Hall of
Fame , one year after both fell just short of the vote total
needed to be elected to the shrine in Cooperstown,  New
York .  Alomar and Blyleven were joined in this year’s class
by baseball executive Pat Gillick, who in December was
voted in by the Hall of Fame’s veterans committee after
building three World Series-winning teams.  Alomar, who won a record 10 Gold Glove Awards for his
defensive play at second base, in January was named on 90
percent of the record 581 ballots cast by members of the
 Baseball Writers’ Association of America , receiving 523
votes. Blyleven, a right-handed pitcher who won 287 games
over 22 seasons, was named on 79.7 percent of the votes,
just above the 75 percent needed for enshrinement.  “I feel speechless,” Alomar said in his induction
speech. “I played the game of baseball in front of
thousands of people all my life, but I must say I’d rather
be playing the game than doing this speech here today.”  Blyleven won 74.2 percent of the vote last year, five
votes short of the mark. Alomar got 73.7 percent, eight
votes short and the closest of any first-year candidate not
elected.  Alomar, 43, is wearing a Toronto  Blue Jays  cap on his
Hall of Fame plaque, having won two World Series titles
during his five Major League Baseball seasons with the Blue
Jays.  12-Time All-Star  Alomar’s stay in Toronto was the longest of his 17-
year playing career, which also included stints with the
 San Diego Padres , Baltimore Orioles,  Cleveland Indians ,  New
York Mets , Chicago White Sox and  Arizona Diamondbacks .  A 12-time All-Star, Alomar had a lifetime .300 batting
average with 210 home runs and 1,134 runs batted in.  Alomar led the  American League  with 138 runs scored
for the Indians in 1999, when he batted .323 with a career-
high 24 home runs and 120 runs batted in. Alomar was also
known for his defense, winning 10 Gold Glove awards in an
11-year span, the most by a second baseman in major league
history.  Alomar is also remembered for his five-game suspension
for spitting in the face of umpire John Hirschbeck in
September 1996 while arguing a called third strike. The two
later reconciled, shaking hands at home plate in a 1997
game, and Hirschbeck supported Alomar’s Hall of Fame
candidacy.  ‘He Forgives Me’  “It’s something I regret doing, something that I have
apologized many, many times for,” Alomar said. “Me and
John are great friends, and as long as he forgives me for
what I did, I feel good about it.”  Blyleven, 59, retired in 1992 after playing 11 seasons
with the  Minnesota Twins , five with the Indians, three each
with the California Angels and Pittsburgh Pirates and two
with the  Texas Rangers .  The two-time All-Star, who was born in Zeist,
 Netherlands , had a career  287-250  record with a 3.31 earned
run average. The win total ranks 27th in major league
history, while his 3,701 strikeouts are fifth and his 60
shutouts ninth.  This was Blyleven’s 14th year on the ballot.  “I’m very proud to be the first Dutchman voted into
the Hall of Fame,” he said in his induction speech. “We
get out of life what we put into it, the same could be said
about baseball.”  Falling Short  Players become eligible five years after retirement
and can gain election for the next 15 years unless they
receive less than 5 percent of the vote in a year.  Former Cincinnati Reds shortstop Barry Larkin finished
third in balloting this year, falling short of induction
with 62.1 percent of the vote. Pitcher Jack Morris was the
only other player to receive more than 50 percent, gaining
53.5 percent in his 12th year on the ballot.  Rafael Palmeiro , who had 569 home runs and 3,020 hits
during a career stained by a steroid suspension, got 11
percent of the vote this year in his first time on the
ballot. Twelve-time All-Star  Mark McGwire  received 19.8
percent in the first balloting since he admitted using
steroids as a player.  Gillick, currently a senior adviser with the
 Philadelphia Phillies , was elected to the Hall of Fame by
receiving 13 votes from the 16-member veterans committee.  Gillick’s Playoff Teams  Gillick, 73, has worked in baseball for the past 51
years, including 27 as a general manager, and built playoff
teams with every franchise he ran. He won World Series
titles with the Blue Jays in 1992 and 1993 and the Phillies
in 2008.  Gillick was also general manager of the  Baltimore
Orioles  and  Seattle Mariners , and was the  New York Yankees ’
scouting director from 1974 through 1976. He’s the 32nd
executive to be inducted in Cooperstown.  The veterans committee operates on a three-year cycle,
considering long-retired players, managers and executives
from three different eras for induction into the Hall of
Fame.  To contact the reporter on this story:
