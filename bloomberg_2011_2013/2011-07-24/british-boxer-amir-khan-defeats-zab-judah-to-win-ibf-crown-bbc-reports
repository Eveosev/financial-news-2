Britain’s Amir Khan knocked out Zab
Judah of the U.S. in five rounds in their light-welterweight
unification fight in  Las Vegas  last night, the  British
Broadcasting Corp . reported.  The win meant Khan added Judah’s International Boxing
Federation title to his own World Boxing Association crown.  The final punch looked like it might have been too low, but
television replays showed it was on Judah’s belt-line and so
wasn’t a foul blow, the  BBC  added.  “He went down and it was above the belt,” Khan told BBC
Radio 5 Live. He’ll now seek a fight with the winner of a
September matchup between Floyd Mayweather and Victor Ortiz, the
broadcaster said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
