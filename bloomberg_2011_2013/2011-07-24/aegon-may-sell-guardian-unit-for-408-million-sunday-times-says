Aegon NV (AGN)  may sell its Guardian
assurance unit for 250 million pounds ($408 million), the London
Sunday Times newspaper reported, without saying where it got the
information.  Private-equity companies Cinven Ltd. and Apollo Global
Management LLC and reinsurer Swiss Re Ltd. may be making bids
for the company, the newspaper said. Goldman Sachs Group Inc. is
managing the sale, with a deal expected to be announced “within
the next few weeks,” according to the report.  The Guardian business is worth 300 million pounds and
buyers will offer about 70 percent of this value to buy it, the
newspaper reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
