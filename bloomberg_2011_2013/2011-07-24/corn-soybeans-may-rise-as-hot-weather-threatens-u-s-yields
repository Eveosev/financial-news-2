Corn may gain for a fourth straight
week and soybeans may rise for a fifth week on speculation that
above-normal temperatures and dry weather will damage crops in
the U.S. Midwest.  Eighteen of 33 traders and analysts surveyed from  Tokyo  to
 Chicago  on July 22 forecast that corn will rise, and 21 of 34
respondents said soybeans will extend rallies.  On the Chicago Board of Trade last week, corn futures for
December delivery rose 0.5 cent to $6.855 a bushel, after
gaining 15 percent the previous two weeks. Soybean futures for
November delivery climbed 1.25 cents to $13.8825 a bushel.  Last weekâ€™s gains in corn and soybeans were expected by the
majority of analysts and traders surveyed on July 15.  Bullish on corn: 18    Bullish on soybeans: 21
