Jefferson County,  Alabama , may
decide this week on filing a record U.S. municipal bankruptcy,
according to a meeting notice from the county commission.  The five-member commission meeting on July 28 may also vote
on extending a negotiating period with creditors on
restructuring more than $3 billion of sewer bonds or a
settlement, the notice said.  The meeting will come one day before the end of a 30-day
“standstill period” in which the county and creditors led by
 JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM)  agreed to pursue a settlement to end the
more than three-year-old debt crisis.  The  county , home to Birmingham and a population of more
than 658,000, has struggled for more than three years in fiscal
distress after a sewer-bond refinancing collapsed during the
credit crisis. Its woes intensified when the state legislature
refused to act after a court struck down an occupational tax in
March. The tax generated about a quarter of the county’s general
fund revenue and officials have put more than 500 employees on
unpaid leave.  On July 21, county commissioners met with Kenneth Klee, one
of the attorneys who represented Orange County,  California , in
its 1994 bankruptcy, at that time the largest ever municipal
filing. The county may vote at the July 28 meeting to hire
Klee’s firm, Klee, Tuchin, Bogdanoff & Stern, LLP, according to
the notice.  To contact the reporters on this story:
