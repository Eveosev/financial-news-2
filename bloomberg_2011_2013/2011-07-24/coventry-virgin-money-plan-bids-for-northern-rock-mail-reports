Coventry Building Society and Virgin
Money Ltd. may make the most credible proposals to buy Northern
Rock Plc,  the Mail on Sunday  reported, without citing anyone.  Coventry may have received the backing of major
institutions for buying the state-owned bank, according to the
London-based newspaper. The U.S. billionaire  Wilbur Ross  has
pledged 500 million pounds ($816 million) to back Virginâ€™s bid
for Northern Rock, the Mail on Sunday said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
