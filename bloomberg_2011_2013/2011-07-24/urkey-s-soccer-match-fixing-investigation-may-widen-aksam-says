Turkish prosecutors may widen an
investigation into an alleged match-fixing scheme that threatens
to strip league champion Fenerbahce SK of its title,  Aksam
 reported.  Special prosecutor Mehmet Berk, who is leading the probe,
may call on Fenerbahce coach Aykut Kocaman, Oguz Sarvan, who
heads the committee on referees, and cup winner Besiktas JK
executive Sinan Engin to testify, the newspaper said, without
indicating where it got the information.  Turkey  detained or jailed more than 50 people since the
operation became public July 3. Berk may widen his investigation
a third time after he returns from vacation on July 29, Aksam
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
