India  battled to 80-1 at the close
of play on day four of the first cricket Test against England at
Lordâ€™s in London, still trailing the hosts by 377.  England wicketkeeper Matt Prior cracked his sixth Test
century to give his team the edge after India had fought back
through four wickets from Ishant Sharma.  Prior, 103 not out, and Stuart Broad, 74 not out, came
together with England struggling on 107-6 in its second innings
and took the total to 269-6 before captain  Andrew Strauss 
declared. India then lost only one wicket before the close.  The match is the 2,000th in the 134 years of elite Test
cricket. England can overtake India as the top team in the
International Cricket Council rankings if it wins the four-match
series by two Tests or more.  England started the day on 5-0 and soon lost its first
wicket as Alastair Cook edged Praveen Kumar to wicketkeeper
Mahendra Singh Dhoni after scoring only one run.  Strauss made 32 before he was trapped leg before wicket by
 Harbhajan Singh , the start of a collapse that saw three further
wickets fall for the addition of eight runs.  Kevin Pietersen and Ian Bell both edged Sharma to Dhoni in
the same over, then Jonathan Trott was bowled by the paceman
soon after. Prior and Morgan, 19 runs, lifted the hosts past 100
before Sharma claimed his fourth wicket.  With England keen to set a declaration, Prior and Broad
scored quickly and the innings was concluded immediately after
the wicketkeeper struck a boundary to reach his ton -- scored
off 120 balls.  India lost Abhinav Mukund early in its reply, before Rahul Dravid, 34 runs, and VVS Laxman, 32 runs, built an unbeaten 61-
run partnership.  To contact the reporter on this story:
