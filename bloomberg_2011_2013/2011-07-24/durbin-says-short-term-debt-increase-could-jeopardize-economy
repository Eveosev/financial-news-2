Dick Durbin , the second-ranking
Democrat in the  U.S. Senate , said it would be dangerous to the
economy for Congress to pass a shorter-term debt ceiling
increase than the $2.4 trillion boost President Barack Obama has
requested.  “A short-term extension of the debt ceiling is going to
jeopardize our economy,” Durbin, of Illinois, said in an
interview on CBS’s “Face the Nation” program, as House Speaker
 John Boehner  considered forcing action on such a plan. “We
can’t do that.”  Durbin said Boehner, an Ohio Republican, is ignoring the
warnings of credit rating companies that have said they may
downgrade U.S. debt if Congress fails to enact a long-term plan
to address deficits.  “The American economy is too fragile at this point in the
recovery to allow that to happen,” Durbin said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
