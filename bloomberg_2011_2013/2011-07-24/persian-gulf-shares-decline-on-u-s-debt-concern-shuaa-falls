Persian Gulf shares fell for the
first time in six days as concern about progress in talks to
raise the debt ceiling in the U.S., the world’s biggest economy,

companies in the region, declined 0.1 percent at the 3:30 p.m.
close in  Riyadh . Almost two shares fell for every one that rose.

a week.  Emirates NBD PJSC (EMIRATES) , the biggest bank in the United Arab
Emirates by assets, slid to the lowest level in almost a month.  “Turnover is very low due to summertime and the fact that
Ramadan is approaching, along with the volatility in
international markets because of the debt crisis in  Europe  and
the U.S.” said  Marwan Shurrab , assistant fund manager and chief
trader at Dubai-based Gulfmena Alternative Investments. “We are
