Talks to sell All3Media Holdings
Ltd., a U.K. television production company, slowed as bidders
wait for the company’s annual earnings, the  Sunday Telegraph 
reported, without citing anyone.  All3Media, which may be sold for as much as 750 million
pounds ($1.22 billion), may release earnings for the year to
August in late September, the newspaper said.  The company’s earnings before taxes, depreciation and
amortization were flat at 50.7 million pounds for the year to
Aug. 2010, according to the Telegraph.  To contact the reporter on this story:
