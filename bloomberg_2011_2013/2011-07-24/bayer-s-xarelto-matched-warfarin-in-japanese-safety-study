Bayer AG (BAYN) ’s Xarelto blood-thinner
didn’t raise the risk of bleeding for irregular-heartbeat
patients in a Japanese study comparing the medicine with
warfarin, the former standard of care, the Leverkusen, Germany-
based company said today.  The results confirmed those of the global Rocket study,
Bayer said. The German drug and chemicals maker said in April it
requested Japanese approval for Xarelto for irregular-heartbeat
patients.  To contact the reporter on this story:
