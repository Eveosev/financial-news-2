The U.K. and India will unveil about
1 billion pounds ($1.6 billion) in commercial deals days after
 BP Plc (BP/)  won approval to buy $7.2 billion in stakes in  Reliance
Industries Ltd. (RIL) ’s oil and natural gas blocks.  Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne and his Indian
counterpart Pranab Mukherjee will present the agreements in
London tomorrow following regular talks both countries hold each
year. The talks also seek to improve financial links and ways to
support businesses trying to establish a presence in each
country.  “Britain is now making the largest foreign investment in
India,” Osborne said in a statement released by his office in
London today. “British companies are competing with the best in
the world, despite some sceptical voices, and it is good for
growth in Britain.”  Osborne and Prime Minister  David Cameron  are striving to
boost trade with India, China and Brazil, and break the U.K.’s
reliance on finance as a source of income. The BP deal may reach
as much as $20 billion, the Treasury said today.  Five months after announcing the accord, BP will acquire a
30 percent interest in 21 of 23 blocks proposed by Reliance, Oil
Minister S. Jaipal Reddy said after a cabinet meeting in New
Delhi last week.  Last year, BP signed a deal to explore off Brazil and
sealed a partnership with  Cnooc Ltd. (883) , China’s biggest offshore
oil producer, for licenses in the South China Sea.  To contact the reporters on this story:
