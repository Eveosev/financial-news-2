Chris Weafer , chief strategist at
ING Bank NV in Moscow, comments on the effect U.S. debt talks
will have on stock markets and emerging markets. He spoke in a
telephone interview from  London  today.  “I think that the market will open nervously, but I don’t
expect any big moves. Investors still believe that the deal will
be done even at the last minute.”  “The reason for that is that consequences of not doing the
deal are so catastrophic, so dangerous, that nobody believes
that U.S. administration or Congress will be party to that.”  “I think all markets have been affected by the threats of
the default in  Greece  and the U.S. The outcome is much more
positive for emerging markets than for U.S. or European equity
markets. I expect the investors moving more into emerging
markets as a result of these twin debt issues.”  “It’s quite clear that these deals are only temporary
measures, that they do not fix the major structural problems
that  Europe  and the U.S. have. The situation in emerging markets
is a lot better. Fiscally, emerging markets are in a much
stronger position and the rates of growth across the most of
emerging markets is also much stronger.”  “Once the threat of a global catastrophe caused by
Eurozone or U.S. debt is resolved, there will still be a
lingering concern about structural problems of both U.S. and
Europe and I would expect to see investors moving back more into
the emerging markets because of their fiscal strength and their
stronger economic dynamics.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
