Deutsche Bank AG (DBK)  would have accepted
a 50 percent writedown on Greek bond holdings in a rescue
package for the country, Die Welt reported, citing unidentified
people in the financial industry.  A writedown of that size would have cost the Frankfurt-
based lender 300 million euros ($431 million), Welt reported.
The planned 21 percent voluntary writedown may result in a
“small” profit, the newspaper reported, without saying where it
got the information.  To contact the reporter on this story:
