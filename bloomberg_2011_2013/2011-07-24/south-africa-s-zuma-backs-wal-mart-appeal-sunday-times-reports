South African President  Jacob Zuma 
supports an appeal by three government ministers against a
decision to allow Wal-Mart Stores Inc. to buy a controlling
stake in  Massmart Holdings Ltd. (MSM) , the Johannesburg-based  Sunday
Times  reported, citing Lionel October, director general of the
 Department of Trade and Industry .  Economic Development Minister  Ebrahim Patel , Trade and
Industry Minister  Rob Davies  and Forestry and Fisheries Minister
Tina Joemat-Pettersson filed the application, according to
documents posted on the  website  of the Pretoria-based
Competition Appeal Court. The Competition Tribunal ruled on May
31 that the world’s biggest retailer could proceed with the 16.5
billion-rand ($2.4 billion) takeover on condition no jobs are
cut for two years.  To contact the reporter on this story:
