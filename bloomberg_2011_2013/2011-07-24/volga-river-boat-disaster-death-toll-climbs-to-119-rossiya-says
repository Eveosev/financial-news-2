The confirmed death toll in a July
10 shipwreck on  Russia ’s Volga River rose to 119 after divers
recovered five more bodies today, Rossiya 24 said.  The double-decker ship  Bulgaria , which had 201 people on
board when it sank during an unlicensed cruise, was raised from
the river bottom and towed on to a sandbank, the state-run
television station reported on its  website  today, citing the
Emergency Situations Ministry.  Rescue workers are sealing the hull and pumping out water
to allow it to float, after which it will be handed over to the
federal Investigative Committee, which will decide if the ship
should be towed into dock for inspection, Rossiya 24 said.  The search for bodies continues on the shore, the river
bottom and inside the boat, Rossiya 24 said.  President  Dmitry Medvedev  vowed “a complete review” of
passenger ships after the Bulgaria went down about three
kilometers from shore.  To contact the reporter on this story:
