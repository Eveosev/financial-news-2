Ireland “does not need nor seek a
default,” Irish Prime Minister  Enda Kenny  said in an e-mailed
statement of comments he made at an event in Ireland today. A
default would be “an economic calamity” carrying consequences
that “would be a millstone hung around Ireland’s neck and that
of its citizens for decades,” he said.  “The price of default is to immediately risk the ongoing
funding of the state and could overnight close down vital public
services,” Kenny said. “It would definitely shut us off from
the private debt markets for even longer.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
