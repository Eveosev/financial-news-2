Mellanox Technologies Ltd. (MLNX)  surged to
the highest level on record after the Israeli maker of data-
center adapters and software reported second-quarter profit that
beat analystsâ€™ estimates.  The shares soared 10 percent to 115 shekels at 10:15 a.m.
in  Tel Aviv , the highest since they began trading in 2007. U.S.
traded shares climbed 18 percent July 21 and July 22 while Tel
Aviv was closed for the weekend.  Local shares are closing the arbitrage gap with U.S.
shares, Joseph Wolf, a Tel Aviv-based analyst at Barclays Plc,
said by telephone.  To contact the reporter on this story:
