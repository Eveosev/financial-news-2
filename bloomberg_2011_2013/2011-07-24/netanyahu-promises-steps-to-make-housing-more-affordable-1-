Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said his government is working on a plan to ease the
burden of high rents and housing prices.  Netanyahu’s remarks today at the Cabinet’s weekly meeting
followed a  Tel Aviv  rally that drew some 30,000 demonstrators
last night to demand affordable housing. The government has
started soliciting bids for construction of some 6,900 housing
units across the country.  “We will take a series of targeted steps to help young
couples, students and needy populations in the next year and a
half while the big waves of additional construction are taking
place,” Netanyahu told the cabinet in remarks e-mailed by his
office. He didn’t specify what the steps include.  Housing prices rose “rapidly” in the first four months of
the year, though at a slower pace than in 2010, the Bank of
Israel said in a report last month.  Home prices  climbed 14
percent in the previous 12 months, following a 20 percent
increase in 2010, the Jerusalem-based central bank said.  Governor  Stanley Fischer  has been tightening monetary
policy to rein in inflation, increasing the benchmark  interest
rate  to 3.25 percent at the end of May, the fourth raise this
year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
