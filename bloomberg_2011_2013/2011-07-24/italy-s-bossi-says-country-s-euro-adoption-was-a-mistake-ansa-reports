  Umberto Bossi , the leader of the
Northern League party and a key ally of Italian Prime Minister
 Silvio Berlusconi , said the adoption of the euro was one of the
two biggest “mistakes” in the country’s history, Ansa news
agency reported, citing comments by the politician.  Bossi, who is also Minister for Reforms and Federalism in
the government, said the formation of modern Italy, with the
South forced to adopt a “strong currency,” was the other main
error in the country’s history, Ansa reported late yesterday.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
