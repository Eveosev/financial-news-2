Philippine President  Benigno Aquino 
said China has too much at stake to let territorial disputes
between the two countries boil over into conflict, as he
prepares to lead a 200-strong trade mission to Beijing.  “If we engage them in a boxing match there’s 1.3 billion
of them and 95 million of us, there’s no way we will win,”
Aquino, 51, said in an interview at the presidential palace in
Manila yesterday. “But at the end of the day, they’ll close so
many doors to trade that they need to sustain growth, so it
doesn’t make sense for them.”  Aquino’s comments on rising tension over oil exploration in
the South China Sea contrast with his more strident language in
last month’s state of the nation address, when he pledged a
military upgrade to defend national interests. Aquino said he
expects “a lot of business deals that will be consummated”
during the trip to  China  beginning Aug. 30.  “Aquino realizes China remains a very important geo-
economic, geo-political partner,” said  Ralf Emmers , a professor
at the S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies in
 Singapore . The government wants to highlight the disputes, “but
not go as far as jeopardizing relationships with China.”  Philippine exports to China have more than doubled since
the beginning of January 2009. Two-way trade between the two
countries accounts for more than 10 percent of the  Philippines ’
total commerce, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  China’s Claims  China, whose ships chased away a vessel working for U.K.-
based  Forum Energy Plc (FEP)  off the Philippines in March, claims
sovereignty over  most  of the  South China Sea  and says any
attempt to drill or fish in the waters is a violation of its
rights. The Philippines intends to pursue oil exploration in the
sea, Foreign Minister Albert F. del Rosario said last month,
days after China and the 10-member Association of Southeast
Asian Nations agreed on non-binding guidelines for operating in
the waters.  Aquino said in his July 25 speech the Philippines is
sending a message to the world that “what’s ours is ours” and
would buy more ships, as well as helicopters and other weapons
to modernize its military. The Philippine navy last month took
delivery of a 378-foot U.S. Coast Guard vessel equipped with a
helicopter pad and missile systems.  Asean members Philippines,  Vietnam ,  Malaysia  and Brunei
have competing claims in the sea. Most claimants have troops on
the Spratlys, a group of islands and reefs with a total land
area equivalent to 1 1/2 times the size of  New York ’s Central
Park spread over waters roughly the size of Iraq.  Clinton, U.S.  U.S. Secretary of State  Hillary Clinton , who attended the
Asean forum in  Indonesia , warned on July 24 that increased
confrontations in the area are a threat to sea lanes that are
“absolutely essential” to world trade.  Aquino said yesterday that he expects the U.S., which has a
defense treaty with the Philippines, to retain its presence in
 Asia  because of the region’s faster economic growth rates.  Asian markets “represent quite a significantly growing
amount of trade and an America that wants to revitalize and
revive itself cannot forgo trade in the region,” he said.  The Philippines spent about 1 percent of China’s budget for
its military last year, according to the  Stockholm International
Peace Research Institute .  China’s claims in the South China Sea include oil and gas
fields more than three times further from its coast than they
are from Vietnam. That includes two of 15 exploration blocks the
Philippines put out for tender in June.  More than 100 energy companies including  Chevron Corp. (CVX)  and
Total SA attended a  June 11 event  in Singapore to meet
Philippine energy officials and get information on the blocks,
according to the department of energy in Manila. Three weeks
later, Energy Secretary Rene Almendras said the government may
offer more exploration contracts in disputed waters because it
is “staking claims to these areas.”  The Philippines, with an economy about 1/30th the size of
China’s, intends to boost hydrocarbon reserves by 40 percent in
the next two decades to reduce its almost total reliance on
imports, according to a department of energy  plan .  To contact the reporters on this story:
