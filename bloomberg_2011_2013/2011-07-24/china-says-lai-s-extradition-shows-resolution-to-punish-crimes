The extradition of fugitive Lai
Changxing, accused of smuggling 53 billion yuan ($8.2 billion)
of goods, shows the “resolution” of  China  and  Canada  to uphold
the law and punish crime, Xinhua News Agency reported, citing
China’s Ministry of Public Security.  Lai was returned to China yesterday after fleeing to Canada
in 1999, Xinhua reported, citing a statement from the ministry.  China has sought the extradition of Lai since his arrest in
2000 in  Vancouver , where he fled via  Hong Kong  in August 1999.
Canadian courts turned down a 2006 request to deport Lai, with
the judge saying he didn’t believe China’s pledge not to execute
Lai.  Lai, 53, is the primary suspect in a smuggling ring dating
back to the 1990s in Xiamen, a port city in the southeastern
province of Fujian. Officials implicated in the case, including
Li Jizhou, the then-vice minister of public securities.  Lai should be returned to China and put on trial, Foreign
Ministry spokesman  Ma Zhaoxu  said in a  statement  on the
ministry’s website on July 22, commenting on a Canadian federal
court’s decision to uphold the extradition.  After Lai’s arrival at the Beijing Capital International
Airport yesterday, Chinese police announced his arrest and read
him his rights, Xinhua cited the ministry as saying.  Chinese police are willing to continue and strengthen
cooperation with Canada in cracking down on crimes and seizing
fugitives, Xinhua cited the statement as saying.  In 2000, a Chinese court sentenced 14 people to death, 12 to
life in prison, and 58 others to various prison terms, for their
involvement in the smuggling ring, Xinhua reported at the time.  --Zheng Life. Editors: Paul Tighe,  Jim McDonald   To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
