The Nikkei 225 Stock Average fell
for the first time in four days as U.S. lawmakers failed to
reach agreement on raising the federal debt limit, increasing
the risk of a default that could threaten the global economy.  Honda Motor Co., a carmaker that gets about 85 percent of
its sales outside of Japan, declined 1.6 percent.  Mitsubishi UFJ
Financial Group Inc. (8306) , Japan’s No. 1 publicly traded lender, lost
2 percent.  Komatsu Ltd. (6301) , a maker of construction machinery,
retreated 3.1 percent after its bigger rival  Caterpillar Inc. (CAT) 
posted earnings that missed analyst estimates.  The Nikkei 225 fell 0.8 percent to 10,050.01 at the 3 p.m.
close in Tokyo. The broader Topix index slipped 0.8 percent to
861.91, the most since July 12, after talks between U.S.
lawmakers on a plan to raise the federal government’s borrowing
authority appeared to unravel days ahead of an Aug. 2 deadline.  “Without an agreement on a deal, investors are going to
start to worry about the outlook for the U.S. economy,” said
Naoteru Teraoka, general manager at Tokyo-based Chuo Mitsui
Asset Management Co., which oversees about $28 billion. “If it
takes a long time to settle the debt issue, it’s going to weigh
on stocks.”  The fewest number of shares since May 30 traded on the
first section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange amid uncertainty about
whether the U.S. will avoid a default. The  Nikkei 225 (NKY)  climbed
1.6 percent last week and was close to erasing its loss for the
year as European leaders agreed an additional aid package for
 Greece  and amid signs before the weekend that U.S. leaders were
nearing a compromise on debt negotiations.  Debt Impasse  House Speaker  John Boehner  on July 22 walked out of
negotiations on a bipartisan plan for raising the U.S. debt
ceiling, leading to a weekend during which Republican and
Democratic leaders tried to come up with separate plans to break
the impasse. Without legislation by Aug. 2, the Treasury will be
unable to pay its bills, triggering a default that could damage
the U.S. economy and the global recovery.  “If talks fail, we should expect a credit-rating downgrade
and another turn downwards in the  U.S. economy ,” said  Stephen Halmarick , Sydney-based head of investment markets research at
Colonial First State Global Asset Management, which oversees
about $150 billion. “The ongoing saga of needing to raise the
debt ceiling in the U.S. is likely to remain a concern for stock
markets as the deadline heads closer.”  Honda, The Yen  Honda lost 1.6 percent to 3,185 yen.  Toyota Motor Corp. (7203) ,
the world’s largest carmaker, dropped 1.4 percent to 3,290 yen.
 Kyocera Corp. (6971) , a maker of solar panels that gets 17 percent of
its revenue in the U.S., dropped 1.1 percent to 8,280 yen.  The yen appreciated to a four-month high of 78.12 against
the dollar, compared with 78.60 at the close of  stock trading  in
 Tokyo  on July 22. Against the euro, Japan’s currency
strengthened to 112.35 from 113.25. A stronger yen hurts
Japanese exporters because it cuts the value of overseas sales.  Stocks also fell today as Moody’s Investors Service cut
Greece’s sovereign credit rating by three steps to Ca from Caa1,
saying the European Union’s financing package for the debt-laden
nation implies “substantial economic losses” for private
creditors.  ‘ Fitch Ratings  said on July 22 Greece will be considered a
“restricted default” because  Europe ’s plan for bailing out the
country requires bondholders to assume part of the cost.  Banks were the heaviest drag on the Topix index. Mitsubishi
UFJ sank 2 percent to 399 yen. Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group
Inc., Japan’s second-largest publicly traded bank, retreated
1.3 percent to 2,497 yen.  Komatsu Retreats  Makers of building equipment retreated after Caterpillar,
the world’s largest construction machinery maker, posted lower-
than-expected profit for the first time in 10 quarters. The
Peoria, Illinois-based company said the March 11 disaster in
Japan caused disruptions to its suppliers, costing it $200
million in sales and $60 million in operating profit.  Komatsu, Japan’s largest construction-machinery maker,
declined 3.1 percent to 2,461 yen. Rival  Kawasaki Heavy
Industries Ltd. (7012)  dropped 2.9 percent to 298 yen. Hitachi
Construction Machinery Co., a maker of excavators and cranes,
retreated 1.5 percent to 1,667 yen.  Utilities declined after Liberal Democratic Party lawmaker
Yasutoshi Nishimura on July 22 said a new bill to compensate
victims of the Fukushimi Dai-Ichi nuclear disaster will nullify
an earlier plan that would have prevented  Tokyo Electric  Power
Co.’s debts from exceeding its assets. The bill, which the lower
house of parliament will vote on tomorrow, requires Tokyo
Electric and other power companies to contribute to a
compensation fund.  Sanrio Rises  Tokyo Electric, owner of the crippled Fukushima plant, fell
1.5 percent to 535 yen after declining as much as 8.8 percent.
Chubu Electric Power Co.,  Japan ’s third-largest utility, sank 1
percent to 1,435 yen.  Among stocks that rose, Sanrio Co., the maker of Hello
Kitty character goods, surged 8.8 percent to 3,265 yen, the most
since April 14. Pretax profit from operations probably rose 48
percent to about 4 billion yen ($51 million) in the April-June
period on higher revenue from royalties in the U.S. and Europe,
the Nikkei newspaper reported on July 23. Sanrio has advanced 72
percent this year, while the Topix has fallen 4.1 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
