Julius Malema , leader of the youth
wing of  South Africa ’s ruling party, failed in a court bid to
stop City Press from publishing details about payments to a
trust he controls, the  newspaper  reported.  The court ruled that Malema, who advocates nationalizing
mines and banks to help the poor, is a public figure and
reporting on his financial affairs is in the public interest,
City Press said today, citing Johannesburg High Court Judge
Colin Lamont.  Malema, the president of the African National Congress
Youth League, did not answer calls from Bloomberg News to his
mobile phone. League spokesman Floyd Shivambu did not respond to
Bloomberg’s voicemail messages seeking comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
