Russia  RTS stock-index futures were
little changed after four days of gains as euro-region leaders
worked to persuade investors that plans to contain the region’s
debt crisis will be adequate. Commodity prices rose.  Futures on the dollar-denominated index expiring in
September were at 196,710 on July 22, little changed from
196,725 on July 21.  German  Chancellor Angela Merkel  said on July 22 European
government chiefs had learned from the “systemic effects” in
the single-currency area and widened the scope of their bailout
fund to allow it to buy bonds of debt-laden nations, support
banks and offer credit lines. The Thomson Reuters/Jefferies CRB
Index of 19 raw materials gained 0.8 percent, its first advance
in three days.  “No announcement today could or should be used as evidence
that the problems of the European banking system are solved,”
Ian Hague, a New York-based founding partner at Firebird
Management LLC, said in a phone interview July 22.
“Nonetheless, commodity prices is where events in  Europe  do
link to Russia, so it can affect Russian stocks because so many
of the companies are commodity exporters.”  Contracts on OAO Rosneft, Russia’s biggest oil producer,
were little changed, and those on OAO Lukoil, Russia’s second-
biggest oil producer, gained 0.1 percent. Futures on OAO
Gazprom, the world’s largest gas producer, also advanced 0.1
percent.  Crude for September delivery gained 0.8 percent to settle
at $99.87 a barrel on the  New York Mercantile Exchange  on July
22, the highest settlement since June 9.  The euro dropped for the first time in four days against
the dollar on concern measures announced by European Union
officials July 21 to contain  Greece ’s debt crisis won’t be
enough to quell regional turmoil. The euro fell 0.4 percent to
$1.4362 in  New York , from $1.4425 on July 21, after reaching
$1.4439, the highest since July 6.  Some investors buy dollar-denominated assets to protect
value when the dollar weakens against the euro and sell them
when the dollar gains.  U.S. technology stocks rose on July 22 as  Advanced Micro
Devices Inc. (AMD)  posted better-than-estimated earnings, offsetting a
drop in industrial shares spurred by lower-than-projected
results at  Caterpillar Inc. (CAT)   The 30-stock  Micex Index (INDEXCF)  was little changed at 1,728.84 in
Moscow on July 22.  To contact the reporter on this story:
