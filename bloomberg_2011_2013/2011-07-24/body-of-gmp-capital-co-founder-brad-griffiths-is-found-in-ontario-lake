The body of  GMP Capital Inc. (GMP)  co-
founder Brad Griffiths has been recovered by divers, five days
after he went missing in Ontario’s Lake Joseph.  Using a remotely operated underwater vehicle, the divers
located Griffiths’ body at 6:23 p.m. yesterday at a depth of 295
feet (90 meters), Ontario Provincial Police said in an e-mailed
statement. A post-mortem will determine the cause of death,
police said.  Griffiths, 55, was seen in the water in distress at about
12:43 p.m. on July 18, the West Parry Sound Ontario Provincial
Police said in a July 19 statement. A motorboat also was spotted
in the area, about 200 kilometers (124 miles) north of Toronto,
moving without an operator.  Several people in boats searched the area without success
for the Toronto man, who wasn’t believed to be wearing a
lifejacket, police said.  Griffiths and Eugene McBurney founded the predecessor
company Griffiths McBurney & Partners in 1995, according to the
company’s  website . The brokerage offered shares to the public in
December 2003.  Griffiths left the firm in 2000, according to the Globe and
Mail newspaper. He also worked for Canadian Imperial Bank of
Commerce and  Canaccord Financial Inc. (CF) , the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter for this story:
