Mauritius’s stocks index fell the
most in 22 months and the rupee headed for its biggest weekly
decline in seven as concern economic recoveries in the U.S. and
 Europe  may stall curbed demand for riskier assets.  The 38-member SEMDEX stocks gauge dropped 1.7 percent, the
biggest retreat since September 2009, to 1,997.85 by the 1:30
p.m. close in Port Louis, the capital, led by Mauritius
Commercial Bank. The currency depreciated 0.5 percent to 28.25
per dollar, bringing its drop this week to to 0.9 percent, the
biggest decline since the five days through June 10, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The U.S. added 85,000 jobs last month, leaving the 9.2
percent unemployment rate unchanged, according to economists
surveyed before data today that will cap a week of economic
reports that showed the recovery is slowing. As global stock
markets sank for an eighth day, the European Commission called
for another reinforcement of the European Financial Stability
Facility, the 440 billion-euro ($623 billion) rescue fund for
distressed euro-area states.  “The current economic situation have led renewed talks of
a double-dip recession,” analysts at Mauritius Commercial Bank
wrote in an e-mailed research note. “With the eurozone stuck in
the debt quagmire, the U.S. struggling to provide real solution
to its fiscal issues and  China  facing inflationary pressures, it
will be hard to find a ray of hope to cheer markets up in the
short term.”  Indicative Rates  China is scheduled to release economic data including the
July inflation report on Aug. 9. The CPI probably stayed at a
three-year high of 6.4 percent, according to the median estimate
of 26 economists surveyed by Bloomberg.  Mauritius, an Indian Ocean Island nation with a population
of 1.3 million people, is a net importer of food and fuels, with
Europe as its main trading partner, accounting for almost two
thirds of tourism arrivals and manufactured goods exports. About
67 percent of its imports bills are dollar-denominated,
according to Bank of Mauritius data.  Buying prices for the dollar ranged from 27.3626 rupees and
27.5311 rupees, with the selling price rising to 28.8308 from
28.7327 rupees per dollar, according to indicative rates
published today on the  Bank of Mauritius’s website .  To contact the reporter on this story:
