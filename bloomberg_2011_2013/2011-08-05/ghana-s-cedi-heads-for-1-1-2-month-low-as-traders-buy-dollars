Ghana ’s cedi headed for its weakest
close in 1 1/2 months against the dollar as importers sought the
U.S. currency to pay for goods including raw materials to make
cement.  The currency of the world’s second-biggest cocoa producer
depreciated as much as 0.5 percent to 1.5241 per dollar, its
weakest intraday level since July 20, before trading less than
0.1 percent down at 1.5185 as of 1:47 p.m. in Accra, the
capital, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. A close at
this level will be the weakest since June 21. The West African
nation’s currency is poised for a 0.4 percent decline this week,
a second of decreases.  “Traders who import goods from abroad for resale in Ghana
bought the dollars today,” Biggles Amponsah, a currency trader
at the local unit of Access Bank Plc, said in a phone interview.
“There was also significant demand from cement producers for
the importation of raw material.”  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
