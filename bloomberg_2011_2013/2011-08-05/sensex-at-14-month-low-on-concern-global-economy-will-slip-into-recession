Indian stocks tumbled, rupee fell and
bonds climbed on concern the global economy may lapse into
recession even as accelerating inflation prompts the central
bank to extend interest-rate increases.  Reliance Industries Ltd. (RIL) , India’s most valuable company,
sank to its lowest price since April 2009. Infosys Ltd., the
second-largest software maker, slid to its lowest in 14 months.
The rupee is set for its biggest weekly loss in three months.
The yield on the 7.8 percent bonds due April 2021 dropped 15
basis points this week, or 0.15 percentage point, to 8.31
percent, according to the central bank’s trading system.  “If there’s going to be some catastrophe in  Europe  or the
U.S. then in the near term all global markets are going to get
hit,” Sunil Singhania, head of equities at Reliance Capital
Asset Management Ltd., India’s biggest money manager, said in an
interview. Reliance Mutual Fund has $23 billion in assets.  The Bombay Stock Exchange Sensitive Index, or Sensex, lost
387.31, or 2.2 percent, to 17,305.87, the lowest since June 11,
2010, at the 3:30 p.m. close in Mumbai. The gauge retreated 4.9
percent this week, the most since October 2009. The S&P CNX
Nifty Index lost 2.3 percent to 5,211.25. Its August futures
settled at 5,220. The BSE 200 Index sank 2.1 percent.  Global stocks sank for an eighth day, the longest losing
streak since January 2010, and commodities fell, erasing the
Standard & Poor’s GSCI index’s gains for the year, on concern
the U.S. recovery is faltering. Bonds jumped, driving Treasury
10-year yields to a 10-month low.  The U.S. added 85,000 jobs last month, leaving the 9.2
percent unemployment rate unchanged, according to economists
surveyed before data today that will cap a week of economic
reports that showed the recovery is slowing.  ‘Threshold Level’  India  may extend rate increases, after the central bank
boosted the repurchase rate 11 times since 2010, even as
counterparts in Europe,  Japan  and  Switzerland  add cash into
their economies or seek to stem appreciating exchange rates to
support expansion. Price gains are “far above the threshold
level” and policy makers need to curb growth to slow price
gains, central bank Governor Duvvuri Subbarao said yesterday.  Reliance Industries shed 2.5 percent to 792 rupees, its
lowest since April 2009. Sterlite Industries (India) Ltd., the
largest copper and zinc maker, retreated 6.3 percent to 141.45
rupees. The stock has lost 18 percent in nine days, its longest
losing streak in at least two decades.  Infosys tumbled 4.4 percent to 2,591.2 rupees. Its August
futures settled at 2,600.70 rupees.  Tata Consultancy Services
Ltd. (TCS)  slumped 3.5 percent to 1,057.95 rupees. The two companies
get more than 90 percent of their sales from overseas.  ‘Dollar Strength’  “Risk-aversion emanating from the U.S. data has led to a
very weak domestic stock market and increasing worries about
capital inflows,” J. Moses Harding, executive vice president at
IndusInd Bank Ltd., said in Mumbai. “The dollar strength we saw
yesterday also worked against the rupee.”  The rupee weakened 0.4 percent to 44.74 per dollar. It fell
to 44.85 earlier, the weakest level since June 29.  The Dollar Index, which tracks the U.S. currency against
those of six trading partners, rose 1.7 percent yesterday, the
most since June, and Treasuries advanced as investors favored
the safest assets. It is little changed today.  Offshore forwards indicate the rupee will trade at 45.19 to
the dollar in three months, compared with expectations for a
rate of 44.99 yesterday.  India’s 10-year bonds rose, driving yields down this week
by the most since June, as investors sought the relative safety
of government debt.  ‘Powerful Benefit’  Oil fell to the lowest in eight months in  New York , set for
the biggest weekly decline since May. Futures dropped as much as
4.3 percent after slumping 5.8 percent yesterday. India depends
on imports to meet almost 80 percent of energy demand.  “The drop in oil is a powerful benefit for India, which
has not been factored in this market fall,” Sankaran Naren,
chief investment officer for equities at ICICI Prudential Asset
Management Co., India’s third-largest money manager, said in an
interview to Bloomberg UTV. Naren said he’s using the declines
in share prices to reduce cash holdings across funds.  The Sensex has lost 16 percent this year, the second-worst
performer after  Brazil ’s Bovespa Index among major indexes in
the 10 biggest markets, on concern higher borrowing costs will
erode earnings. The decline has almost erased gains of 17.4
percent in 2010. Companies on the gauge trade at 14 times 2012
earnings, down from 21.5 times in March 2010, last year’s high.  Earnings reported by nine out of 20 Sensex companies, or 45
percent, have lagged behind analyst estimates for the three
months ended June. That compares with 33 percent that missed
forecasts in the previous quarter.  Overseas investors sold a net 8.01 billion rupees ($180.5
million) of Indian equities on Aug. 3, paring their investment
in stocks this year to 93.6 billion rupees, according to data on
the  website  of the regulator.  To contact the reporters on this story:
