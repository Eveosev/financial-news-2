The European Central Bank’s
reluctance to buy Italian bonds is discouraging demand for the
country’s debt, Finance Minister  Giulio Tremonti  told reporters,
according to Radiocor newswire.  Tremonti, speaking after a press conference yesterday in
Rome, said that Asian investors have told him that “if your
central bank isn’t buying your bonds, why should we buy them?,”
according to Radiocor.  Tremonti also suggested that the ECB should follow the
example of the central banks of Japan and Switzerland by
adopting a more expansionary monetary policy, the news agency
reported. “We’re awaiting decisions if possible,” he said,
according to Radiocor.  To contact the reporter on this story:
