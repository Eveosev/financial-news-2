Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) , the U.S.
bank that makes most of its money from trading, said it delayed
providing equity-market trading and clearing reports to some
clients this morning because of the high volume yesterday.  “We told clearing clients that some reports might be
delayed due to the high volume of trading yesterday,” said
 David Wells , a spokesman for the New York-based firm. “Ninety-
five percent of the usual data was available by 7 a.m. and the
rest was available by the time the U.S. stock market opened.”  The affected unit was  Goldman Sachs Execution & Clearing
LP , which provides trading and clearing services for stocks,
options and futures.  Goldman Sachs, the fifth-biggest U.S. bank by assets, made
the most revenue from trading equities of any bank in the world
last year.  CNBC.com  reported earlier today that Goldman Sachs posted a
message on a client website this morning notifying customers
that there would be custody reporting delays.  To contact the reporter on this story:
