Mauritius will produce less sugar
this year than previously forecast, the country’s Chamber of
Agriculture said, as cane struggled to recover from last year’s
drought.  Output is expected to be 390,000 metric tons, 7.1 percent
less than the 420,000 tons forecast on June 8, the Port Louis-
based industry group said today in an e-mailed statement
following a meeting of the country’s Crop Estimate Coordinating
Committee. That would be the smallest harvest since 1999, when
growers reaped 373,294 tons, according to the chamber’s data.
The country’s production of the sweetener was 452,473 tons in
2010, according to the chamber.  Cane growth on the Indian Ocean island nation didn’t fully
recover from the drought, which lasted up to December, even amid
favorable weather in the first half of 2011, the chamber said.  Sugar cane is the country’s main crop and makes up about 63
percent of agricultural exports, according to the chamber.  To contact the reporter on this story:
