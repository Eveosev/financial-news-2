Sailesh K. Jha, Singapore-based head
of Asia markets strategy at Skandinaviska Enskilda Banken AB,
comments on the outlook for the Indian rupee.  “A good buying opportunity for the rupee would be 44.90-
45.10 per dollar because it would likely trade back to 44 in the
next few weeks.  “On a three-month horizon our forecast is 43.50 to
43.72,” he said.  “Unless we get some shock from the payrolls numbers
tonight in the U.S. or Tuesday’s China data for July, then I
think we should start seeing some stabilization in the financial
markets globally in the near term.  “The rupee will underperform other Asian currencies at
least over three months due to concerns related to the high
current-account deficit and in terms of risks related to the
fiscal front, where the government seems to be on a path of
maintaining its policy of a loose stance, and also because in my
view the central bank has a lot more to do in terms of hiking
the repo rate.”  Jha predicts the  Reserve Bank  of  India  will raise the
repurchase rate to 9 percent by the end of March from the
current 8 percent.  Three-month non-deliverable forwards dropped 0.6 percent to
45.26 per dollar as of 12:25 p.m. in Mumbai, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. The contracts reflect bets the rupee will
drop 1 percent from the spot rate of 44.79.  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
