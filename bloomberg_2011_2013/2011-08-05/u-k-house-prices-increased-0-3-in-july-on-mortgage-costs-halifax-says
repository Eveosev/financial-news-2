U.K.  house prices  increased in July
as record-low borrowing costs helped support demand for
residential property.  Prices rose 0.3 percent from the previous month, the
mortgage unit of  Lloyds Banking Group Plc (LLOY)  said in a statement in
London today. From a year earlier, prices fell 2.6 percent to an
average 163,981 pounds ($267,000).  The housing market is struggling to gain momentum as
consumers are suffering from high inflation and government
spending cuts. The  Bank of England  held its benchmark interest
rate at a record low yesterday as the economy grew just 0.2
percent in the second quarter after stalling since September.  “Overall, there has been little change in either the level
of house sales or the number of properties on the market for
sale since late 2010,”  Martin Ellis , a Halifax economist, said
in the statement. “Sustained low  interest rates  and a slowly
improving economy should help to support demand in the face of
pressures from weak earnings growth, relatively high inflation
and higher taxes.”  In the three months through July, values rose 0.5 percent
from the previous quarter, Halifax said.  Consumers are getting squeezed by inflation that reached
4.2 percent in June, more than double the bank’s 2 percent
target, as the government implements the biggest public spending
cuts since World War II.  ‘Willingness to Commit’  “The current sell-offs in financial markets and growing
fears of a renewed serious global economic downturn are unlikely
to do much for  consumer confidence  and willingness to commit to
buying a house in the near term,” Howard Archer, an economist
at IHS Global Insight, said in a research note.  Net mortgage lending fell by 100 million pounds in June
from May, while mortgage approvals rose to 48,421 from 46,418
the previous month, Bank of England data show. Loan approvals
have held between 43,000 and 50,000 since the start of 2010,
compared with an average of 119,000 in 2006, when house prices
peaked before the global credit squeeze.  Central-bank policy makers also held their bond-purchase
program at 200 billion pounds yesterday. Minutes of the decision
will be published Aug. 17.  To contact the reporter on this story:
