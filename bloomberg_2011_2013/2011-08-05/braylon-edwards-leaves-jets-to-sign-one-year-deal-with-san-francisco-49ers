Braylon Edwards  signed a one-year
contract with the San Francisco 49ers, leaving the New York Jets
after two seasons.  Edwards, 28, had 53 receptions for 904 yards and seven
touchdowns last season. Financial terms weren’t disclosed by the
49ers on their website. The contract is worth $3.5 million, the
Associated Press reported.  The 6-foot-3 wide receiver was a National Football League
All-Pro in 2007. He’s played in 90 games for the Cleveland
Browns and Jets, with 326 catches for 5,142 yards and 39
touchdowns. He left the University of Michigan as a two-time
All-Big 10 selection, with school records for receptions, yards,
touchdowns and 100-yard receiving games.  Edwards caught some throws in practice yesterday for the
49ers.  “I felt good today and it’s good to learn,” Edwards said
on the team’s  website .  San Francisco  was 6-10 last season, while the Jets were 11-
5 and reached the American Football Conference championship game
for the second straight year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
