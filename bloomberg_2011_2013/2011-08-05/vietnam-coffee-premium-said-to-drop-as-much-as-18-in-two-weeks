The premium buyers are prepared to
pay for coffee in  Vietnam  fell as much as 18 percent in the past
two weeks as roasters turned to beans stored in  Europe , three
traders said.  Vietnamese coffee cost $140 to $150 a metric ton more than
prices on NYSE Liffe in London, according to the people, who
declined to be identified because they aren’t authorized to
speak to the media. That’s below the $170 reported on July 22 by
Volcafe, the coffee unit of ED&F Man Holdings Ltd.  Robusta inventories with valid grading certificates in
warehouses monitored by NYSE Liffe fell 1.7 percent to 410,140
tons in the two weeks to July 25, signaling demand for beans
stored in Europe. Stocks almost doubled this year from 216,880
tons on Dec. 27, exchange data showed. Prices slid 16 percent,
the most since October 2008, on NYSE Liffe last month.  “The cash prices have been firm for such a long time now,
but this tightness has only been played out on the physical
market and not on Liffe,”  Kona Haque , an analyst at Macquarie
Group Ltd., said by phone from London. “Any reduction in Liffe
stocks will help top up Liffe futures.”  Coffee from Vietnam is now cheaper at European ports than
in the Southeast Asian nation’s export market, three people
involved in the trade said Aug. 3. Prices in the Belgian port of
Antwerp were $105 to $150 a ton above NYSE Liffe, according to
the people. Vietnam is the world’s biggest robusta grower.  Container Rates  Shipping coffee to ports in northern Europe from  Ho Chi
Minh City  costs $1,250 for every 20-foot container, each holding
15 to 18 tons, according A.P. Moller-Maersk A/S, owner of the
world’s biggest container-shipping line. That corresponds to
about $69 to $83 a ton.  Farmers and exporters in Vietnam may be holding 1.2 million
to 1.3 million bags of coffee, Ratzeburg, Germany-based
researcher F.O. Licht said in a report covering the July 18 to
Aug. 3 period. Vietnamese exporters delayed or canceled as much
as 60,000 tons of shipments in the past two months, said Geneva-
based coffee trader Sucafina SA.  That helped lift prices in the physical market. Vietnamese
coffee was at a discount of $140 to NYSE Liffe prices in
February, according to Eugen Atte GmbH, a Hamburg-based broker.  Robusta prices may decline in the fourth quarter as
producers in Vietnam start to hedge the new crop from October,
Macquarie’s Haque said. The country’s coffee output will
increase 10 percent to 20.6 million bags in the coming 2011-12
season, U.S. Department of Agriculture data show.  Robusta for September delivery rose $23, or 1.1 percent, to
$2,068 a ton by 3:54 p.m.  London  time on NYSE Liffe. The beans
gained 19 percent in the past year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
