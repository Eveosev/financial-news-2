Asian currencies posted their biggest
weekly decline since November, led by Malaysia’s ringgit and
 India ’s rupee, as regional stocks plunged on concern the global
economic recovery is stalling.  The MSCI Asia-Pacific Index of equities dropped 7.8 percent
this week, the most since October 2008, as reports from the U.S.
showed  consumer spending  fell in June for the first time since
September 2009 and a July manufacturing index reached the lowest
level in two years, damaging Asia’s export outlook. Global funds
sold $2.1 billion more South Korean and Taiwanese shares than
they bought this week through Aug. 4, exchange data show.  The Bloomberg-JPMorgan Asia Dollar Index, which tracks the
region’s 10 most-traded currencies excluding the yen, declined
0.7 percent from a week ago to 119.11 yesterday. The ringgit
weakened 1.6 percent to 3.0150 per dollar, the rupee slumped 1.2
percent to 44.74 per dollar and  South Korea ’s won dropped 1.5
percent to 1,071.7, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The
Philippine peso fell 1 percent to 42.568.  “Stocks are plunging globally and there’s growing concern
about a slowdown in global economic growth,” said Kozo Hasegawa,
a currency trader at Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corp. in Bangkok.
“That’s making investors risk averse.”  Bank of America Merrill Lynch cut gross domestic product
forecasts for some Southeast Asian economies, citing lower
expectations for growth in the U.S.,  Europe  and  Japan , according
to a report received yesterday. It reduced Singapore’s growth
estimate for 2011 to 4.5 percent from 4.8 percent and the
Philippines’ to 4.7 percent from 5.8 percent. Malaysia’s GDP
growth may be below 4 percent in the second quarter, the bank
said. The country’s economy expanded 4.6 percent in the first
three months of the year, the smallest gain since 2009.  South Korean Meeting  The ringgit sank to a three-week low yesterday before a
Labor Department report showed that U.S. employers added more
jobs than forecast in July with payrolls rising by 117,000
workers. The U.S. jobless rate fell to 9.1 percent.  “People are shying away from risk in reaction to the
meltdown in the stock markets in the U.S. and Europe,” said Yeo Chin Tiong, head of financial markets at Alliance Bank Bhd. in
 Kuala Lumpur . “There are no signs of intervention from the
central bank. What we are seeing is a lot of position squaring
and adjustment.”  The won had its biggest weekly drop since February. The
government will closely monitor the impact in financial markets,
with officials from the  finance ministry , the Bank of  Korea  and
regulators to hold an emergency meeting on Aug. 7, the ministry
said yesterday.  ‘Steep Slide Unlikely’  “Global stock market plunges are prompting foreign
investors to sell Korean stocks, dragging the currency down,”
said Han Sung Min, a foreign-exchange dealer at Busan Bank in
Seoul. “Still, a steep slide is unlikely as market players
think the government will start intervening around 1,075.”  Elsewhere, the  Singapore  dollar fell 1.2 percent to
S$1.2200 against its U.S. counterpart. Indonesia’s rupiah
declined 0.8 percent to 8,574, Taiwan’s dollar dropped 0.4
percent to NT$28.965 and the  Thai baht  weakened 0.2 percent to
29.89.  China ’s yuan slipped 0.05 percent to 6.4404.  To contact the reporter on this story:
