A United Nations peacekeeper was
killed and another was “seriously injured” when their vehicle
came under attack today in a village outside Nyala, the state
capital of South Darfur, the UN said in an e-mailed statement.  The vehicle was ambushed by four unidentified gunmen in
Duma, a village 37 kilometers (23 miles) northeast of Nyala.
Thirty UN peacekeepers have died due to hostile action in the
western Sudanese region since the peacekeeping force, known as
 Unamid , was deployed on Dec. 31, 2007, the UN said.  Insurgents in Darfur took up arms in 2003, accusing
President Umar al-Bashir’s government of neglecting the region.
The conflict has led to the deaths of as many as 300,000 people,
mainly due to illness and starvation, and forced about 2.7
million to flee their homes, according to UN estimates. The
Sudanese government has put the death toll at about 10,000.  “Unamid is doing all it can to render treatment to the
injured, and, with the Sudanese police, to find the perpetrators
and bring them to justice,” the force’s deputy joint special
representative, Aichatou Mindaoudou Souleymane, said in the
statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
