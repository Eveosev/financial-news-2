Negotiations between the  United Arab
Emirates  and the French government and  Dassault Aviation SA (AM)  over
the sale of about 63 Rafale fighter planes have picked up again,
with a deal expected between September and year-end, La Tribune
reported, without saying where it got the information.  Such an order would be worth between 6 billion euros ($8.5
billion) and 8 billion euros, the French newspaper said. The
negotiations include plans for the purchase of Meteor missiles
built by MBDA, a missile maker comprised of European Aeronautic,
Defence & Space Co.,  BAE Systems Plc (BA/)  and  Italy â€™s Finmecanicca
SpA.  To contact the reporter on this story:
