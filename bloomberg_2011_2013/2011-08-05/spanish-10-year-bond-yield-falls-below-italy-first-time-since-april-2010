(Corrects headline, first paragraph to show that the last
time the Italian yield was higher was in May 2010.)  Spanish 10-year bonds rose, driving
the yield on the securities to a discount to similar-maturity
Italian debt for the first time since May 2010.  The 10-year Spanish bond yield fell six basis points to
6.22 percent as of 8:56 a.m. in  London , below the 6.24 percent
rate on the Italian bonds.  To contact the reporter on this story:
