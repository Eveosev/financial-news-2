Uganda ,  Africa ’s second-biggest
coffee producer, raised its export forecast for 2010-11 by about
12 percent because of a good harvest in the southwest, according
to the country’s Coffee Development Authority.  Exports in the 12 months through September may range
between 2.8 million and 2.9 million 60-kilogram (132-pound)
bags, from an April estimate of 2.6 million bags, an official
who declined be identified because he isn’t authorized to speak
to the media, said by phone today from the capital, Kampala.  The agency cut its forecast in April from an initial 3.1
million bags after drought reduced yields in the central and
eastern regions, where the main crop is reaped from October to
March. In the south and southwest, the main harvest is collected
from April through August.  Exports from the start of the season on Oct. 1 through July
rose 8.7 percent to 2.5 million bags, from 2.3 million bags a
year earlier, according to a tally of the authority’s figures
compiled by Bloomberg News. Shipments in August may rise 1.2
percent to 220,000 bags, from 217,284 bags a year earlier, the
official said.  Robusta Variety  Uganda earned $243.6 million from the sales of the beans
last season, down from $291.3 million a year earlier, according
to the authority. The country consumes less than 3 percent of
its annual output, according to the Eastern African Fine Coffee
Association.  Uganda ranks behind  Ethiopia  as the continent’s largest
exporter of coffee, according to the website of the
 International Coffee Organization . The robusta variety,
used in instant coffee and espresso, accounts for about 85
percent of the East African nation’s annual production of the
beans.  To contact the reporter on this story:
