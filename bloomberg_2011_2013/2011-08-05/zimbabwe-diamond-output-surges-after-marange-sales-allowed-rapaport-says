Zimbabwe  became the world’s seventh-
biggest diamond producer by value in 2010, up from 13th the
previous year,  statistics  released by the Kimberley Process and
New York-based Rapaport show.  The southern African nation produced gems worth $339.8
million last year, up from $20.4 million in  2009 , the reports
show. The value of a carat from Zimbabwe almost doubled from
$21.20 to $40.28 in the same period.  The jump came after the Kimberley Process, which monitors
the export of so-called conflict gems, allowed limited sales of
diamonds from Zimbabwe’s contested Marange diamond fields last
year.  The top producers of the stones by value last year were
Botswana, Russia, Canada,  South Africa , Angola and  Namibia .
Worldwide, gems worth $12 billion were sold, a 45 percent
increase on 2009, the Kimberley Process tables show.  Global rough diamond production rose 39 percent in 2010 and
the average price per carat increased 30 percent, Rapaport said
in an e-mailed statement today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
