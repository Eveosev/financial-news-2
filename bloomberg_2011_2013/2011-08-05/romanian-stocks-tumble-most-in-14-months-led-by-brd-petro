Romania ’s benchmark equity index fell
the most in more than 14 months, led by  OMV Petrom SA (SNP)  and BRD-
Groupe Societe Generale SA, as investors ditched riskier assets
worldwide.  The BET stock index slid as much as 6.4 percent, the most
since May 2010, and traded down 4.4 percent at 4,905.18 by 11:15
a.m. in Bucharest. Petrom, the country’s biggest oil company,
and BRD, the second-largest lender, fell more than 4 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
