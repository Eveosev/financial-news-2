Oil flows will resume through an
Iranian pipeline in a “few hours” after an explosion today
halted operations, the state-run Mehr news service said, without
saying how the information was obtained.  The pipeline, which carries crude to plants in the
southwestern Iranian city of Ahvaz from Qalat Naar, suffered an
explosion and fire, the news service said. Ahvaz, in Khuzestan
province, is near the border with  Iraq . The cause of the blast
wasn’t known, Mehr said.  The fire was extinguished 10 hours after it began, state-
run Press TV said. The pipeline carries as much as 4,000 barrels
a day and is “one of the longest” in the country, according to
the station.  Khuzestan is the largest oil-producing province in  Iran ,
holder of 10 percent of the world’s crude reserves, according to
a U.S. Energy Department report.  To contact the reporters on this story:
