Norway ’s central bank extended for 48
hours a rule allowing a wider difference in the setting of
buying and selling prices on the country’s bonds by primary
dealers amid turbulence in global markets.  The bid-ask spread, the difference between selling and
buying prices, was temporarily widened by 10 basis points on the
price through a special clause in the primary dealer accord, the
Oslo-based bank said in a statement. The clause allows primary
dealers, or banks obligated to set prices on bonds, to increase
the spread in the event of turbulent market conditions,
according to a copy of the  agreement  on Norges Bank’s website.  “The turmoil abroad has increased interest in Norwegian
 government bonds ,” Kristine Falkgaard, head of Norges Bank’s
market operations and analysis department, said by phone. “When
there’s a large buyer interest and limited volumes available, it
becomes demanding.”  Norway’s 10-year note yield has slipped 14 basis points to
2.67 percent this week amid global concerns of the spreading
debt crisis in the euro area and a slowing in U.S. economic
expansion. The country’s two-year yield fell 18 basis points to
2.04 percent. Bond yields move inversely to price.  The price spread on two-year notes was 25 price points, up
from 15 on August 2 according to data provided by DNB NOR ASA,
Norway’s largest bank. The difference varies across different
maturities.  To contact the reporter on this story:
