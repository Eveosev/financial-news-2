OAO Sberbank will get 35 percent of
Belaruskali, the Belarusian potash producer, as collateral for a
$2 billion loan, Sberbank Chief Executive Officer  German Gref 
told Russian Prime Minister  Vladimir Putin  today.  The Russian state-owned bank and  Deutsche Bank AG (DBK)  agreed to
lend $2 billion to Belaruskali, Gref told Putin, according to a
transcript on the government’s website. The loan is also secured
by Belaruskali export contracts, the transcript said. Deutsche
Bank declined to comment, according to an e-mail from its Moscow
press office.  Belaruskali owns an export trader with Russian potash
producer OAO Uralkali, controlled by billionaire Suleiman Kerimov and his partners. Uralkali may be interested in
Belaruskali if the price creates value for shareholders, Chief
Executive Officer Vladislav Baumgertner said June 28.  “The value of 35 percent in Belaruskali as collateral is
clearly way above $2 billion,” said Mikhail Stiskin, analyst at
Troika Dialog in Moscow. “Such a deal blessed by the Kremlin
increases the chances that Kerimov could acquire a controlling
stake in Belaruskali using the debt funding of the state
banks.”  Jointly,  Uralkali (URKA)  and Belaruskali control 42 percent of the
world’s potash exports, Uralkali said in a June presentation on
its website. This compares with the 25 percent market share of
Canpotex Ltd., a trader representing North American producers
Potash Corp. of Saskatchewan Inc.,  Mosaic Co. (MOS)  and  Agrium Inc. (AGU)   To contact the reporter on this story:
