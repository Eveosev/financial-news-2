Julius Malema , leader of the youth
wing of  South Africa ’s ruling  African National Congress , holds
shares in On-Point Engineering, which has awarded government
contracts to some of his family and friends, the Mail & Guardian
reported.  Malema told the Johannesburg-based newspaper that he was
involved in On-Point, though didn’t influence the awarding of
contracts. On-Point, which was appointed by Limpopo’s provincial
government to award contracts for road works, allocated projects
to Malema’s cousin, his friend and former driver, and business
associates, the newspaper said.  Calls to Malema’s mobile phone didn’t connect, while ANC
Youth League spokesman Floyd Shivambu didn’t immediately respond
to a message left on his mobile phone. Pinky Kekana, the Limpopo
government’s head of roads and transport, didn’t immediately
respond to a message left on her office phone and an e-mail
seeking comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
