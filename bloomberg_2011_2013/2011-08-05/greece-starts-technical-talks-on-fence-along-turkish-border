Greece  said it has opened for public
 discussion  the technical aspects of a fence to be built along
part of the country’s border with Turkey.  The discussions on the specifications of the project, which
has a budget of just under 5.5 million euros ($7.7 million),
will last until Aug. 20, the  Ministry of Civil Protection  said
in an e-mailed statement late yesterday.  The fence, 10.3 kilometers (6.4 miles) in length, is being
built with the aim of curbing illegal immigration and
trafficking and will be built in the Evros region of the
country’s northeast, according to the statement. The barrier
will consist of two parallel wire fences supported by galvanized
steel posts with barbed wire between the fences.  Greece’s land border with  Turkey  accounted for more than
half of the illegal immigration into the European Union in the
first quarter, according to Warsaw-based  Frontex , the EU agency
for external border security.  To contact the reporter on this story:
