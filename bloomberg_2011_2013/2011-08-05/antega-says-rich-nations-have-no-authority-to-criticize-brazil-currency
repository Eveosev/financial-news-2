 Rich nations in the Group of 20 have
“no moral authority” to criticize  Brazil  for taking steps to
stem a rally in its currency, Finance Minister  Guido Mantega 
said.  “These countries are the ones causing the currency
problems,” Mantega said in an interview in Lima ahead of a
meeting of South American finance officials. “‘They don’t have
any moral authority to speak against currency intervention.”  Mantega, who is preparing to host Canadian Prime Minsiter
Stephen Harper in Brasilia next week for talks about economic
imbalances within the G-20, said Brazil won’t allow its economy
to be “contaminated” by attempts from advanced nations to
weaken their currencies to gain trade advantages.   Policy makers critical of Brazil’s use of  capital controls 
should be more worried about fueling growth in their own
economies, he said.  “Brazil is part of the solution, not the problem,”
Mantega said. “They depend a little on us.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
