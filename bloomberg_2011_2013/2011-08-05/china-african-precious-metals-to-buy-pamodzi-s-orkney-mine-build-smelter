China African Precious Metals Ltd.,
affiliated to  Hong Kong ’s SSC Mandarin Holdings Ltd., will buy
Pamodzi Gold Orkney Ltd. in South Africa for 150 million rand
($22 million), the provisional liquidator of the mine said.  “It is expected that it will spend more than 525 million
rand on mine developments and on erecting a new gold plant at
the mine,” the liquidator said today in a statement. Orkney may
be in full production a year from deal completion, it said.  Aurora Empowerment Systems Ltd., led by a grandson of
 Nelson Mandela  and nephew of President  Jacob Zuma , was ordered
by the liquidator to vacate the mine in May as workers went
unpaid. Aurora had planned to buy the mine and others from
 Pamodzi Gold Ltd. (PZG) , which went bankrupt in 2009 and had been
given operational rights in the meantime.  China African Precious Metals, or CAPM, is 74 percent-owned
by Superb Gold Ltd., an affiliate of the SSC, according to
today’s statement from Icon Insolvency Practitioners Ltd. A
black shareholders’ group led by Elias Khumalo owns the rest.
The transaction adviser is Standard Bank Group Ltd.  Pamodzi’s Modderfontein, Grootvlei, Nigel and East Rand
operations will also be sold, the liquidator said in an
advertisement in Johannesburg-based newspaper Business Day in
June.  To contact the reporter on this story:
