U.S. stocks rose, erasing an early
tumble, amid speculation the  European Central Bank  was preparing
to buy Italian and Spanish bonds to halt the region’s debt
crisis.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index climbed 1 percent to
1,211.76 at 12:50 p.m. in  New York  after slumping 2.7 percent
earlier. The  Dow Jones Industrial Average  rallied 153.79 points,
or 1.4 percent, to 11,535.45. Both gauges sank the most since
2009 yesterday amid concern the  U.S. economy  was weakening.  Stocks erased losses after Reuters said the European
Central Bank is pressuring Italy to make further reforms in
return for buying Italian and Spanish bonds. Italy’s government
will announce plans to speed up state-asset sales, liberalize
the labor market and introduce a balanced-budget amendment into
the country’s constitution, Sky TG24 reported today, citing
unidentified officials.  European leaders are hunting for solutions to the debt
crisis, helping Italy and  Spain  gain a respite from the market
turbulence after the resumption of the ECB bond-buying program.  The ECB would be willing to buy more bonds of deficit-hit
countries once they take “concrete” steps to stabilize their
finances, European Central Bank council member Luc Coene said.  “Certainly the ECB is ready to make major efforts to
relieve the situation, but first the countries have to take
steps,” Coene, head of Belgium’s central bank, told RTBF radio
in Brussels today. “It doesn’t make sense to pour water into a
bucket with a hole in it.”  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
