Intercontinental Exchange Inc. plans
to shut down its Chicago Climate Futures Exchange at the end of
next year’s first quarter.  The failure of the U.S. to pass “cap-and-trade”
legislation to help limit  carbon emissions  is part of the reason
for the closure, the Atlanta-based company  said today  in a
notice to members. Intercontinental bought the parent company,
Climate Exchange Plc, last year for about $581 million,
providing access to  Europe ’s largest emissions trading market.  The Chicago Climate Exchange ended its cap-and-trade
program for companies to make voluntary cuts in their greenhouse
gas output last year. Intercontinental said it will list OTC
contract equivalents of all of its climate futures contracts on
its over-the-counter trading system.  Cap-and-trade programs, in which companies buy and sell a
declining number of carbon dioxide pollution rights, already
operate in Europe and a 10-state region of the U.S. Northeast.  Federal legislation to create a U.S. program stalled amid
criticism from Senate Republicans and some Democrats that it
would make fossil fuels such as coal and oil more expensive to
use and slow the U.S. economy’s recovery. Senate Majority Leader
 Harry Reid  said last year the bill wouldn’t pass.  Dow Jones Newswires reported the decision earlier today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
