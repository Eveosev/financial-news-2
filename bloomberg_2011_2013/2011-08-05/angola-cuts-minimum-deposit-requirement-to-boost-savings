Angola  cut the minimum deposit
required to open a bank account to 100 kwanza from 20,000 to
boost savings and draw funds out of the informal economy,
central bank Governor Jose de Lima Massano said.  Nine banks signed up to the accord yesterday, including
Banco Fomento Angola, the largest bank by deposits, and the
state-run Banco de Poupanca e Credito.  The government is aiming to increase the percentage of
people with a bank account to 20 percent by the end of next year
from 13 percent at the moment, Massano told reporters yesterday.
The ratio is up from 11 percent at the beginning of the year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
