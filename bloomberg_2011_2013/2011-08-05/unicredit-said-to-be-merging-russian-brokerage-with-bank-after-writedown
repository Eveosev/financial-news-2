     Aug. 5 (Bloomberg) --  UniCredit SpA (UCG) , Eastern Europe’s
biggest lender, plans to combine its Russian brokerage and bank
after writing down the broker’s remaining goodwill, according to
two people familiar with the matter.  UniCredit will merge CJSC UniCredit Securities with ZAO
UniCredit Bank, which the Milan-based company holds through its
Bank Austria AG unit, according to the people, who declined to
be identified because the information hasn’t been made public.
UniCredit Bank was formerly known as International Moscow Bank
and the brokerage was called Aton.  “Aton has not been particularly exciting,” Bank Austria
Chief Financial Officer Francesco Giordano told journalists in
Vienna yesterday, after the lender wrote down remaining goodwill
of 50 million euros ($71 million) on the Moscow-based unit. “We
have reassessed partially our activity,” he said, adding that
UniCredit wants to “do securities business mostly as support
for corporates and a little bit less as a standalone activity.”  The writedown followed previous impairments in 2008 and
2009, and Giordano said the brokerage’s profit for the first
half of 2011 was “about zero.”  UniCredit’s Russian bank was started in 1989 as the first
lender co-owned by Western banks in the  Soviet Union .
Predecessors to both Bank Austria and UniCredit’s German unit,
HypoVereinsbank, were among the founding shareholders, with a 12
percent stake each. They were both bought by UniCredit in 2005,
and the unit was moved to Bank Austria in an internal revamp.  ‘Pros and Cons’  Giordano said yesterday there were “pros and cons” to the
idea of merging the two units. “At this point in time we stay as
it is, for the time being,” Giordano said.  UniCredit was the 30th biggest underwriter of equity and
debt deals in Russia last year, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  The bank has 106 branches in Russia and 3,700 employees
serving 90,000 retail customers and 22,600 corporate clients,
according to its Russian  website . The securities unit has about
120 employees, according to the people familiar.  UniCredit agreed to buy what was then known as Aton Capital
for $424 million in 2006, winning against rival suitors that
included Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and JPMorgan Chase & Co.,
according to Russian media at the time. That was four times
Aton’s book value, according to  Bank Austria’s 2007 annual
report . The bank wrote down 140 million euros of goodwill in
2008, and another 18 million euros in 2009.  The original owner of Aton, Yevgeny Yuryev, retained asset
management and restarted the brokerage under the Aton Capital
name in 2009.  “Within the strategic reassessment of our Central and
Eastern European operations we also look at our perspectives and
options in  Russia , but so far no decision has been taken” on
combining the units, a spokesman for UniCredit, who declined to
be named citing company policy, said in e-mailed comments today.  To contact the reporters on this story:
