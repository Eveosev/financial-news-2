New Mauritius Hotels Ltd. (NMH) , the
country’s biggest leisure company by market value, said its
third-quarter loss widened 41 percent due to losses in its
airline catering unit.  The loss for the three months through June increased to 133
million rupees ($4.7 million) from 94.5 million rupees a year
earlier, the company said in a statement published on the Port
Louis-based Stock Exchange of Mauritius’s website today. Revenue
increased 7.4 percent to 1.45 billion rupees.  “The current low season proves to be more difficult than
anticipated,” it said. The Indian Ocean island nation’s low
season for tourism is from April to September. The group’s
catering unit accounted for 33 million rupees of losses in the
quarter, it said.  Tourism and textiles are the country’s biggest foreign
exchange earners, with Europe accounting for almost two-thirds
of tourist arrivals. NMH, as the group is known, manages hotels
under the Beachcomber brand, with eight resorts in Mauritius and
one in  Seychelles , according to its website.  New Mauritius Hotels’ nine-month profit increased 12
percent to 769.5 million rupees, the company said. Profit for
the full-year will probably be higher than a year earlier and
may improve further in 2012, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
