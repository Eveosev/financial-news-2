Banco Santander  SA recommended buying
Brazilian homebuilder stocks after the market “correction”
drove valuations to the cheapest levels since the financial
crisis in 2008 and 2009.  “The sell-off has created a major opportunity for
investors to rebuild positions in the sector, as we believe that
the story of 2009 could repeat itself, and the recovery with
respect to homebuilders’ stock prices could be significant and
fast when the market returns to fundamentals,” analysts at
Banco Santander, including Flavio Queiroz, wrote in a note to
clients today.  Amid a global equity rout yesterday, the  BM&FBovespa Real
Estate (IMOBBV)  Index fell 6.9 percent, the biggest drop since January
2009. The measure’s ratio of price to net assets fell to 1.2,
the lowest since April 2009, data compiled by Bloomberg show. In
2009, the index rallied 205 percent after losing 69 percent the
previous year.  Brazil’s homebuilders have plunged 34 percent from an
October peak through yesterday as the central bank raised
interest rates,  reserve requirements  and taxes on consumer loans
to contain the fastest inflation since 2005.  To contact the reporter on this story:
