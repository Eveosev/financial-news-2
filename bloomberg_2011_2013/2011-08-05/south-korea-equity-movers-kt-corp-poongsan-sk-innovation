in  New York , set for the biggest weekly decline in three months

Europe’s debt crisis worsens.  Poongsan Corp. (103140 KS), a copper-products maker, slid
4.4 percent to 41,750 won, the lowest close since July 12.

that missed analyst estimates as the company spent more buying
smartphones to meet rising demand for the devices.  To contact the reporter on this story:
