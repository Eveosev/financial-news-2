Raw sugar’s rally above 31 cents a
pound in  New York  trading curbed demand, leaving prices
“vulnerable” to selling, while arabica coffee may rebound,
according to Macquarie Group Ltd.  Fewer ships are waiting at Brazilian ports to load sugar,
and prospects are better for Northern Hemisphere crops, analyst
Kona Haque said in a report e-mailed today. Arabica may rebound
above $2.60 a pound in the fourth quarter and in 2012’s first
quarter before falling, she said.  “The bullish news emanating out of  Brazil  of the ageing
and lower-yielding cane crop has run its course in terms of
pushing prices higher in the short term,” Haque said.  Sugar-cane production in Brazil, the world’s largest
grower, will fall for the first time in a decade, according to
industry group Unica. Output will be 533.5 million metric tons,
the group estimates. Sao Paulo-based consultancy Canaplan says
the crop will be about 520 million tons, while Archer
Consulting, also in  Sao Paulo , says the market is expecting a
harvest as small as 515 million tons.  Recent declines for arabica amount to “a good entry
point,” according to Haque. The beans slid 11 percent on ICE
Futures U.S. in New York over the past month.  “The Brazilian coffee-export program was front-loaded, but
will likely ease from here on,” Haque said. “The world will
find little supply-side relief from other origins too, with
 Colombia ’s mitaca falling sharply below expectations and
Vietnamese and Indonesian producers now sold out.”  Raw sugar for October delivery fell 0.03 cent, or 0.1
percent, to 27.76 cents a pound by 5:46 p.m. London time on ICE.
Prices reached 31.68 cents on July 25. Arabica for December
delivery added 0.95 cent, or 0.4 percent, to $2.407 a pound.  To contact the reporter on this story:
