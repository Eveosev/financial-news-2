The U.S. Justice Department urged a
federal court to approve the settlement outlining conditions for
permitting  Comcast Corp. (CMCSA) ’s takeover of NBC Universal in response
to a judge’s threat to block the deal.  The Justice Department defended an “alternative
arbitration mechanism” through which online video distributors
could get content from Comcast-NBC following criticism last
month from U.S. District Judge Richard Leon in  Washington . Leon
said at a July 27 hearing he was concerned that an arbitration
process to be overseen by the department wouldn’t allow appeals.  The process, which would use an outside, neutral
arbitrator, provides a “speedier and less costly alternative,”
the Justice Department said in court filing today. The online
video distributors would still have the option of arbitration
overseen by the Federal Communications Commission, whose
decisions can be appealed, according to the filing.  Comcast’s proposed acquisition of  NBC Universal  won
approval Jan. 18 from U.S. regulators, under an agreement with
the FCC and the Justice Department that imposed conditions
designed to protect the emerging online-video market. The
settlement is pending final approval by Leon.  “I’m giving you fair notice I am not sure I am going to
sign this, ” Leon said at the July 27 hearing. “This not a
fait accompli, not in this court.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
