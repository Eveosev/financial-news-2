Asia naphtha cargoes traded $63 a
metric ton lower on the Platts window on concern that global
fuel demand may fall. Total SA bought gasoil for a second day in
Singapore, the region’s biggest oil-trading center.  Light Distillates  Royal Dutch Shell Plc, the biggest buyer of naphtha cargoes
on the window this month, purchased 25,000 tons for delivery to
 Japan  in the second half of October from BP Plc at $905 a ton,
according to a Bloomberg News survey of traders monitoring
transactions on the Platts window. Yesterday, Shell paid $968 a
ton for a cargo delivered in the same period.  Naphtha’s premium to London-traded Brent crude futures, or
the crack spread, slumped to $88.92 a ton at 5:39 p.m. Singapore
time from $116.65 a ton at the end of Asian trading on July 29,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Total sold 50,000 barrels of 92-RON gasoline to Morgan
Stanley at $113.95 a barrel, the survey showed. The Paris-based
refiner sold 50,000 barrels of 95-RON to Vitol Group at a
premium of $3 a barrel to 92-RON prices.  Vitol bought 50,000 barrels of 92-RON from Trafigura Beheer
BV at $113.90 a barrel. The London-based trader sold 50,000
barrels of 95-RON to Shell at $118.60 a barrel.  Shell bought 50,000 barrels of 97-RON from Morgan Stanley
at $121.50 a barrel.  Middle Distillates  Total bought 0.5 percent sulfur gasoil, or diesel, in
 Singapore  for a second day, the survey of traders showed. Total
paid 40 cents a barrel below benchmark quotes to Barclays Plc
for 150,000 barrels, and sold a similar cargo to BP at $120.10 a
barrel.  Trafigura bought 250,000 barrels of gasoil from Glencore
International AG, receiving a 45-cent discount to quotes, the
survey showed. Last month, Glencore was the biggest buyer in
Singapore, purchasing at least 4 million barrels.  Gasoil’s premium to Asian benchmark Dubai crude gained 4
cents to $19.78 a barrel at 2:55 p.m. Singapore time, according
to PVM Oil Associates Ltd., a broker. This crack spread, a
measure of refining profit, widened 9 percent this week, the
most in five weeks.  Jet fuel’s premium to gasoil slid 5 cents to $1.55 a barrel,
PVM said. This regrade fell 23 percent this week, snapping a
four-week rally, indicating it’s less profitable to produce
 aviation fuel  over diesel.  Fuel Oil  Fuel oil’s discount to Dubai crude narrowed 71 cents to
$5.30 a barrel at 2:55 p.m. Singapore time, according to PVM.
That’s the smallest gap since June 28, indicating reduced losses
for refiners turning oil into residual products.  In Singapore, Vitol sold 20,000 tons of 180-centistoke fuel
oil to Hin Leong Trading Pte at $2.75 a ton over quotes for
August, the Bloomberg News survey showed.  The premium of 180-centistoke fuel oil to 380-centistoke
was unchanged after declining to $9.25 a ton, PVM said. This
viscosity spread widened 2.8 percent this week after two weeks
of losses, meaning bunker, or marine fuel, dropped more than
higher-quality  fuel oil .  To contact the reporters on this story:
