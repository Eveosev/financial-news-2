Exco Resources Inc. (XCO)  has received a
subpoena from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission asking
for records about its natural-gas reserves for the last four
years.  Exco received the subpoena Aug. 1, according to an Aug. 3
regulatory filing. The request covers records on proved
developed reserves from shale-gas wells and reserve estimates
since Jan. 1, 2008.  “The SEC states that this investigation is a fact-finding
inquiry,” Dallas-based Exco said. “We understand that a number
of other shale-gas producers have received similar subpoenas
from the SEC.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
