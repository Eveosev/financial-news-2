(Corrects speaker starting in ninth paragraph of story
published Aug. 5.)  Procter & Gamble Co. (PG) , the world’s
largest consumer-products company, forecast annual revenue that
topped some analysts’ estimates and said fourth-quarter profit
rose 15 percent as sales gained in emerging markets.  Net income in the period ended June 30 climbed to $2.51
billion, or 84 cents a share, from $2.19 billion, or 71 cents, a
year earlier, Cincinnati-based P&G said today in a statement.
The average estimate of 19 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg was
for profit of 82 cents a share.  Chief Executive Officer Bob McDonald has added services
such as Tide Dry Cleaners franchises and worked to expand sales
in emerging markets to reduce dependence on the U.S., where
unemployment has topped 9 percent for 24 of the past 26 months.
Wood pulp, resin and other materials cost P&G $1 billion more
than expected this year and prompted price increases, Chief
Financial Officer Jon Moeller said on a conference call today.  “The main concern going forward is what happens in the
macro environment,”  Ali Dibadj , a New York-based analyst at
Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., said in a telephone interview.
“Those events will determine whether P&G is an exciting company
at a turning point or not.”  Fourth-quarter sales rose 10 percent to $20.9 billion,
exceeding the $20.6 billion average estimate of 17 analysts.  P&G gained $1.01, or 1.7 percent, to $60.59 at 4 p.m. in
New York Stock Exchange composite training, the biggest gain
since Dec. 1. The shares have dropped 5.8 percent this year.  Profit Forecast  P&G said sales in its fiscal 2012 will increase 5 percent
to 9 percent, with favorable currency exchange boosting sales
about 2 percent to 3 percent. The average estimate of 20
analysts was for about $87 billion in revenue, which would be a
5.4 percent gain.  Earnings per share from continuing operations in fiscal
2012 will be $4.17 to $4.33, P&G said. That compares with 23
analysts’ average estimate for $4.26.  P&G will focus on expanding Olay skincare products in  South
America  and  Asia , McDonald said. While the average person in the
U.S. spends $100 a year on the company’s products, people in
 China  spend only about $3, he said.  “We still have a lot of work to do to get the rest of the
categories in there and expand the growth,” McDonald said.  First-quarter earnings per share from continuing operations
will be $1 to $1.04 as price increases fail to keep pace with
rising commodity costs, P&G said. The average estimate of 12
analysts was $1.14.  To contact the reporters on this story:
