Mark Konyn , the Hong Kong-based chief
executive officer of RCM Asia Pacific Ltd., which helps oversee
about $150 billion globally, commented on the outlook for
equities amid concern the global recovery is faltering.  He spoke in a Bloomberg Television interview today. The
MSCI Asia Pacific Index dropped 3.8 percent as of 12 p.m. in
Hong Kong, taking its drop from this year’s high reached on May
2 to 11 percent.  “We’ve probably seen the highest of this year. We can say
that with reasonable amount of certainty. In  Wall Street  and
 Europe  as well, investors are quite nervous now about
developments in Europe and whether or not we have real
leadership in tackling the sovereign debt issue and the
cascading effect on growth.”  “If you look at economies and how they’re positioned,
they’re certainly posturing for a double dip. Now it’s a
question of whether or not there will be policy response to
revert that. That’s the worry. If it continues to move in this
direction, we’ll start to see the falls reach those levels seen
back then.”  On his investment strategy:  “We have a balanced portfolio at the moment, where we’ve
got an evenly balanced between cyclicals and growth, so we’re
not overly exposed. We’re underweight energy stocks, underweight
certain industrial names and we’re positioned for growth in
consumption.”  “We still see growth in consumption, for example in
various areas in technology, particularly in the Internet
space.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
