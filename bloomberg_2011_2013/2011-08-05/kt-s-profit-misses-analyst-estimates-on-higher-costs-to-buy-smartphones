KT Corp. (030200) ,  South Korea ’s largest phone
and Internet company, posted second-quarter profit that missed
analysts’ estimates on higher spending and discounts to lure
smartphone users.  Net income rose 0.3 percent to 420.6 billion won ($392
million) in the three months ended June 30 from a year earlier,
KT said in a regulatory filing today. That trailed the 511.7
billion won average of six analysts’ estimates compiled by
Bloomberg. Profit was boosted by the sale of the Russian unit
this year, KT said.  Operating costs increased 15 percent in the quarter on
higher expenses to purchase smartphones, while revenue from
mobile-phone calls fell 14 percent because of discounts, the
Seongnam, South Korea-based carrier said. The company also faces
pressure from the government to cut phone tariffs after rival SK
Telecom Co. agreed to lower rates this year.  “It doesn’t look easy for them to increase revenue in
their main telecom business, while there’s a constant need for
investment,” Park Jong Soo, an analyst at Hanwha Securities Co.,
said by telephone. “This situation will likely continue.”  KT shares fell 2.9 percent to 39,050 as of 11:45 a.m. in
Seoul trading, while the benchmark Kospi declined 2.9 percent.  Operating profit dropped 36 percent to 432.4 billion won,
while sales gained 7.9 percent to 5.3 trillion won.  Mobile Sales  The figures released today, including for the year-earlier
period, were based on the International Financial Reporting
Standards that the company began to use this year.  Revenue from mobile services fell 0.7 percent as a drop in
voice-calls overshadowed a 41 percent increase in data usage.  Depreciation costs increased 7 percent after upgrading
networks to meet a surge in data traffic. The company spent 1.5
trillion won in capital expenditure in the first half, 28
percent more than last year.  SK agreed with the government to reduce tariffs for its
phone plans on June 2. The company plans to cut basic rates for
all of its subscribers by 1,000 won per month from September,
while offering 50 free  text messages  each month. KT is
considering following SK’s lead, the company said at that time.  KT’s number of smartphone subscribers surged almost
fivefold to 5.2 million at the end of June. Bigger rival SK had
7.5 million. KT expects to have more than 7 million smartphone
customers this year, the company said.  The company said in May it sold KT’s stake in  Russia ’s New
Telephone Company Inc. for 371.9 billion won.  To contact the reporter on this story:
