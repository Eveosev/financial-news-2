Following is the text of the July
employment report from the Labor Department.  THE EMPLOYMENT SITUATION -- JULY 2011  Total nonfarm payroll employment rose by 117,000 in July, and
the unemployment rate was little changed at 9.1 percent, the
 U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics  reported today. Job gains
occurred in health care, retail trade, manufacturing, and
mining. Government employment continued to trend down.  Household Survey Data  The number of unemployed persons (13.9 million) and the
unemployment rate (9.1 percent) changed little in July. Since
April, the unemployment rate has shown little definitive
movement. The labor force, at 153.2 million, was little
changed in July.  Among the major worker groups, the unemployment rates for
adult men(9.0 percent), adult women (7.9 percent), teenagers
(25.0 percent), whites (8.1 percent), blacks (15.9 percent),
and Hispanics (11.3 percent) showed little or no change in
July. The jobless rate for Asians was 7.7 percent, not
seasonally adjusted.  The number of persons unemployed for less than 5 weeks
declined by 387,000 in July, mostly offsetting an increase in
the prior month. The number of long-term unemployed (those
jobless for 27 weeks and over), at 6.2 million, changed little
over the month and accounted for 44.4 percent of the
unemployed. (See table A-12.)  The civilian  labor force  participation rate edged down in July
to 63.9 percent, and the employment-population ratio was
little changed at 58.1 percent.  The number of persons employed part time for economic reasons
(sometimes referred to as involuntary part-time workers) was
about unchanged in July at 8.4 million. These individuals were
working part time because their hours had been cut back or
because they were unable to find a full-time job.  In July, 2.8 million persons were marginally attached to the
labor force, little changed from a year earlier. (These data
are not seasonally adjusted.) These individuals were not in
the labor force, wanted and were available for work, and had
looked for a job sometime in the prior 12 months. They were
not counted as unemployed because they had not searched for
work in the 4 weeks preceding the survey.  Among the marginally attached, there were 1.1 million
discouraged workers in July, about the same as a year earlier.
(These data are not seasonally adjusted.) Discouraged workers
are persons not currently looking for work because they
believe no jobs are available for them. The remaining 1.7
million persons marginally attached to the labor force in July
had not searched for work in the 4 weeks preceding the survey
for reasons such as school attendance or family
responsibilities.  Establishment Survey Data  Total nonfarm payroll employment increased by 117,000 in July,
following little growth over the prior 2 months. Total private
employment rose by 154,000 over the month, reflecting job
gains in several major industries, including health care,
retail trade, manufacturing, and mining. Government employment
continued to decline.  Health care employment grew by 31,000 in July. Ambulatory
health care services and hospitals each added 14,000 jobs over
the month. Over the past 12 months, health care employment has
grown by 299,000.  Retail trade added 26,000 jobs in July. Employment in health
and personal care stores rose by 9,000 over the month with
small increases distributed among several other retail
industries. Employment in retail trade has increased by
228,000 since a recent low in December 2009.  Manufacturing employment increased in July (+24,000); nearly
all of the increase was in durable goods manufacturing. Within
durable goods, the motor vehicles and parts industry had fewer
seasonal layoffs than typical for July, contributing to a
seasonally adjusted employment increase of 12,000.
Manufacturing has added 289,000 jobs since its most recent
trough in December 2009, and durable goods manufacturing added
327,000 jobs during this period.  In July, employment in mining rose by 9,000; virtually all of
the gain (+8,000) occurred in support activities for mining.
Employment in mining has increased by 140,000 since a recent
low in October 2009.  Employment in professional and technical services continued to
trend up in July (+18,000). This industry has added 246,000
jobs since a recent low in March 2010. Employment in temporary
help services changed little over the month and has shown
little movement on net so far this year.  Elsewhere in the private sector, employment in construction,
transportation and warehousing, information, financial
activities, and leisure and hospitality changed little over
the month.  Government employment continued to trend down over the month (-
37,000). Employment in state government decreased by 23,000,
almost entirely due to a partial shutdown of the Minnesota
state government. Employment in local government continued to
wane over the month.  The average workweek for all employees on private nonfarm
payrolls was unchanged over the month at 34.3 hours. The
manufacturing workweek and factory overtime for all employees
also were unchanged at 40.3 hours and 3.1 hours, respectively.
In July, the average workweek for production and
nonsupervisory employees on private nonfarm payrolls was 33.6
hours for the sixth consecutive month.  In July, average hourly earnings for all employees on private
nonfarm payrolls increased by 10 cents, or 0.4 percent, to
$23.13. Over the past 12 months, average hourly earnings have
increased by 2.3 percent. In July, average hourly earnings of
private-sector production and nonsupervisory employees
increased by 8 cents, or 0.4 percent, to $19.52.  The change in total nonfarm payroll employment for May was
revised from +25,000 to +53,000, and the change for June was
revised from +18,000 to +46,000.  _____________
