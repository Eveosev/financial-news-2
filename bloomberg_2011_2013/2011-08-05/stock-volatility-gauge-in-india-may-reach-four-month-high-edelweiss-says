Option prices in  India  climbed the
most in more than two-and-a-half years and volumes surged as
investors sought protection against further declines in stock
prices amid concern the global economy may slip into recession.  The India VIX, which gauges the cost of buying protection
against losses in the S&P CNX Nifty Index, jumped 23.2 percent
to 25, the steepest gain since Jan. 27, 2009, data compiled by
Bloomberg show. The measure gained 10.4 percent last week, the
most since the period ended Feb. 27, the data show.  More than $4.5 trillion has been wiped out from equity
market values globally on growing concern the U.S., the world’s
biggest economy, may slow faster than expected. The MSCI Asia
Pacific Index had its largest weekly loss since October 2008,
following yesterday’s 4.8 percent tumble in the Standard &
Poor’s Index.  “The options premium, prices and volumes are also rising
on concerns  Europe ’s debt crisis and a slowdown in the U.S. may
lead to further stock declines,” Nandish Patel, a derivatives
analyst at Sharekhan Ltd., said in a phone interview in Mumbai.
“Implied volatility on all stocks is rising, signaling traders
are buying protection against further losses.”  The 50-stock Nifty Index sank 2.3 percent to 5,211.25 at
the 3:30 p.m. close in Mumbai, the lowest level in 14 months.
The gauge has retreated 15 percent this year on concern higher
borrowing costs will slow growth and reduce corporate earnings.  A total 6,049,035 options contracts on the Nifty changed
hands, almost three times the entire volume traded yesterday.  “Long-only funds may come to sell and we may see forceful
unwinding of leveraged positions after the deep cut” in global
markets, Yogesh Radke, head of quantitative research at a unit
of Edelweiss Capital Ltd., the nation’s biggest publicly traded
brokerage, said in a phone interview from Mumbai. The Nifty may
fall to 5,170 before rebounding to 5,200, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
