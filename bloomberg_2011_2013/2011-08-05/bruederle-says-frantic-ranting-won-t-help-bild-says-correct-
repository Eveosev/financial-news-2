(Corrects to say Barroso was referring to bailout fund in
first paragraph.)  Rainer Bruederle, the parliamentary
spokesman for Germany’s Free Democratic Party, criticized
European Commission President  Jose Barroso ’s call to review
 Europe ’s rescue fund, saying “frantic ranting” won’t help to
restore trust and stability, in an interview with Bild Zeitung.  “To anchor the euro, we need an effective and assertive
Stability and Growth Pact 2, and not a frivolous letter from
Brussels,” Bild cited Bruederle as saying. “It is imprudent
and negligent to call into question something that state and
government leaders haev only recently agreed on.”  The Free Democratic Party is German Chancellor Angela
Merkel’s coalition partner.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
