Corn production in  Argentina , the
world’s second largest exporter, will surpass 28 million tons
next season, President  Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner  said.  Farmers will start planting the 2011-2012 crop between late
August and early September and harvest the bulk of it next year.
Fernandez, who gave no further details on the crop, spoke today
at the National Corn Festival in Chacabuco, Argentina.  Fernandez’s prediction is for a 29 percent increase in the
next harvest, compared with the Agriculture Ministry’s estimate
of 21.7 million tons for the harvest due to end this month. The
crop is 97 percent harvested, according to the ministry.  The 2011-2012 corn crop will cover about 700,000 hectares
(1.72 million acres), or 25 percent, more land than the current
one, Martin Fraguio, director of the corn association, said
Aug.3. The current crop covers about 4.35 million hectares.  To contact the reporter on this story:
