Securitas AB (SECUB) , the second-biggest
guarding-services provider, said second-quarter profit fell 22
percent as the company raised pay and lost some large contracts
in  Europe . The stock dropped as much as 14 percent.  Net income declined to 368 million kronor ($56 million)
from 471 million kronor a year earlier, Stockholm-based
Securitas said today in a statement. That compared with the
average estimate of 419 million kronor in a Bloomberg survey of
11 analysts.  “In Security Services Europe, the loss of a few major
contracts and difficulties to manage the balance between wage
increases and price increases have resulted in a non-
satisfactory development,” and the company is working to
restore its performance, Securitas said in the statement.  Securitas offered on May 16 to buy Niscayah AB through a
share swap that values the company at 5.1 billion kronor based
on yesterday’s closing share price.  Stanley Black & Decker Inc. (SWK) ,
most known for its power tools, outbid Securitas on June 27,
offering 7.6 billion kronor to expand the U.S. company’s
security-related business.  Securitas fell as much as 8.37 kronor to 49.98 kronor and
was down 13 percent as of 9:04 a.m. in Stockholm trading.  The company, smaller only than Anglo-Danish rival G4S Plc
in guarding services, yesterday extended the acceptance period
of its Niscayah bid until Sept. 9 from Aug. 12. Securitas spun
off three of its divisions between 2006 and 2008, including
Niscayah. The unit, then called Securitas Systems, was
distributed to shareholders in 2006.  To contact the reporter on this story:
