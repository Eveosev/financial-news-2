Banks offered  Ghana ’s  cocoa board 
more than the $1.75 billion it sought in a loan facility that
will  be used for cocoa purchases in the 2011-12 harvest, the
Business and Financial Times newspaper reported, citing a board
official it didn’t identify.  The amount is $250 million more than the board raised a
year earlier, the Accra-based newspaper cited the official as
saying. It did not provide details on how much the lenders had
sought.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
