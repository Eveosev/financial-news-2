Uganda ’s shilling, the world’s worst-
performing currency in the last two months, was headed for a
third successive weekly slump against the dollar because of
reduced inflows of the U.S. currency.  The currency of  Africa ’s second-biggest coffee producer
gained 0.1 percent to 2,672.50 per dollar at 3.57 p.m. in the
capital, Kampala, paring its drop this week to 1.9 percent,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  “The market has been quiet as dollar inflows from exports
and the demand for the dollar was low,” Timothy Muzoora, a
currency trader at Cairo Bank Ltd., said by phone from Kampala.
“Next week we don’t expect to see any major inflows and the
demand by  oil companies  is low because they have good stocks.”  The shilling has depreciated 10 percent against the dollar
over the last two months. A surge in food and fuel prices pushed
inflation to a more than 18-year high of 18.7 percent in July
from 15.7 percent in June.  To contact the reporter on this story:
