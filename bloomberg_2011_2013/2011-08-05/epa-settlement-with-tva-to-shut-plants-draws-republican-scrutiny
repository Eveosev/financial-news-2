A settlement with the U.S. and states
in which the  Tennessee  Valley Authority will close 18 coal-fired
plants and add pollution controls is drawing scrutiny from House
Republicans, who say it may raise energy costs.  House Energy and Commerce Committee Chairman Fred Upton of
Michigan and five other Republicans sent a letter today asking
Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Lisa Jackson about
the agreement, which requires TVA to spend $3 billion to $5
billion on equipment to reduce emissions.  “What will be the source of the funds to meet these
obligations, and will the costs be passed on to ratepayers?”
the lawmakers wrote in the letter.  The lawmakers also ask the EPA to explain how the agreement
led TVA to close almost a third of its 59 coal-fueled
generators. The settlement resolves allegations that the
authority violated the federal  Clean Air Act .  The TVA, created in 1933 by President Franklin D.
Roosevelt, owns 59 coal-burning generators. It plans to replace
the units being closed with renewable energy, natural gas and
nuclear power sources.  The authority also will invest $350 million in clean-energy
projects and pay $10 million in civil penalties, under the
settlement.  TVA, created to bring power to the rural south, serves
parts of Alabama, Georgia,  Kentucky , Mississippi,  North
Carolina , Tennessee and Virginia.  Upton was joined by Representatives Ed Whitfield of
Kentucky, Cliff Stearns of  Florida , Sue Myrick of North
Carolina, Marsha Blackburn of Tennessee and Brett Guthrie of
Kentucky in signing the letter.  To contact the reporter on this story:
