Malaysia ’s ringgit fell, headed for
its biggest weekly loss in eight months, as signs the U.S.

safer bets than emerging-market assets.  The ringgit sank to a three-week low, regional stocks

first time in almost two years. A Labor Department report today
is forecast to show the world’s biggest economy failed to create
enough jobs in July to reduce unemployment.  “People are shying away from risk in reaction to the
meltdown in the stock markets in the U.S. and  Europe ,” said Yeo Chin Tiong, head of financial markets at Alliance Bank Bhd. in

central bank. What we are seeing is a lot of position squaring
and adjustment.”  The ringgit weakened 1.5 percent to 3.0110 per dollar as of
4:11 p.m. in Kuala Lumpur for its worst five-days since November,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The currency fell as
much as 1.1 percent today to 3.0225, the lowest since July 14.  The MSCI Asia-Pacific Index tumbled 3.7 percent, adding to

York .  Bank of America Merrill Lynch cut its 2011 and 2012 growth
forecasts for Malaysia,  Singapore  and the Philippines, according
