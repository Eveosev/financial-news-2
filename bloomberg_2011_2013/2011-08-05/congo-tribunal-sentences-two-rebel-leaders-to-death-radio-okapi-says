A military tribunal in the  Democratic
Republic of Congo  sentenced to death two leaders of an
insurgency that forced almost 200,000 people to flee their homes
in Equateur province, Radio Okapi said.  Udjani Magbama and his father, Ibrahim Magbama, were found
guilty of leading an insurrection against the government, sexual
slavery of a minor, war crimes and crimes against humanity, the
United Nations-sponsored  broadcaster  said, citing a judgment the
court announced yesterday in Kinshasa, the capital.  The conflict in Equateur, which began in 2009, was fueled
by longstanding disputes in the northwestern province between
the Magbamas’ ethnic-Enyele community and the Monzaya people
over political representation and fishing rights.  The violence escalated when the Enyele, a clan of the
Lobala people, accused Congo’s government of siding with the
Monzaya. Other Lobala and demobilized soldiers joined the
movement, which briefly took over the airport in Equateur’s
capital, Mbandaka, in April 2010.  About 130,000 people who fled the violence are still living
as refugees in neighboring Republic of Congo and Central African
Republic, according to the UN Refugee Agency.  To contact the reporter on this story:
