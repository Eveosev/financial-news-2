Ivory Coast  will spend 42 percent of
its budget for 2011 on servicing debts, while investing
“insignificant” amounts in infrastructure, Finance Minister
Charles Koffi Diby said.  Spending on debt servicing will total 1.3 billion  CFA
francs  ($2.8 billion), or 15 percent of gross domestic product,
Diby said in speech on his budget strategy yesterday, a copy of
which was e-mailed to Bloomberg today.  The government is trying to reassure investors after a
civil war earlier this year led it to default on $2.3 billion of
Eurobonds. Diby said on July 12 that payments on the bonds would
resume next year and that the country needed “a complete
reassessment” of its payment capacity.  The world’s top cocoa grower approved a 3.05 trillion CFA-
franc budget for this year on June 23 on the assumption that the
economy will shrink 6.3 percent. Civil war broke out after
elections in November, when former President  Laurent Gbagbo 
refused to cede power to the internationally recognized winner,
 Alassane Ouattara . The impasse ended in April with Gbagbo’s
capture.  Speaking to a group of business people in the commercial
capital, Abidjan, Diby said payments on debt this year would
pave the way to increased investment thereafter. The government
plans to make an immediate cash payment of 144 billion CFA
francs to reduce arrears on its internal debt, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
