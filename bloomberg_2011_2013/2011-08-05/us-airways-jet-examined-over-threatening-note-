A  US Airways Group Inc. (LCC)  jet was
evacuated and inspected in Philadelphia today after a
“threatening note” was found, the U.S. Transportation Security
Administration said.  The flight was cleared to continue its journey tonight to
Alaska, the  Associated Press  reported, citing an airport
spokeswoman.  Greg Soule, a spokesman for TSA, said in an e-mail earlier
that passengers had been deplaned and the aircraft was being
swept by law enforcement, “out of an abundance of caution.” He
didn’t specify the contents of the note or the nature of the
sweep.  Flight 968 to Anchorage, Alaska, from Philadelphia
International Airport had taken on 157 passengers and six crew
members when TSA asked that the plane be emptied for the
inspection, an airline spokesman, Andrew Christie, told AP.  The  Boeing Co. (BA)  757 had been scheduled to depart at 4 p.m.
local time, according to flight-tracker FlightAware.com. It
arrived in Philadelphia from Glasgow, Scotland, at 2:45 p.m.,
Soule said. TSA is part of the Department of  Homeland Security .  To contact the reporters on this story:
