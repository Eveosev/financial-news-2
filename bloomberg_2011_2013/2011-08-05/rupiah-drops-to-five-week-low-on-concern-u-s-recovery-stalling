Indonesia ’s rupiah dropped to the
weakest level in five weeks as concern a recovery in the U.S. is
stalling countered data that showed Southeast Asia’s biggest
economy grew more than 6 percent for a third quarter.  The currency declined for a second day as global stocks
were pummeled after reports this week showed the U.S. services
industries expanded in July at the slowest pace since February
2010 and consumer spending fell in June for the first time in
almost two years. Indonesia’s gross domestic product rose 6.49
percent in the three months through June from a year earlier,
compared with a revised increase of 6.47 percent in the prior
quarter, the  Central Bureau of Statistics  said today.  “The market is still worried about the risk of global
growth weakening after data coming out from the U.S. have been
on the weaker side,” said  Prakriti Sofat , a regional economist
at Barclays Capital in Singapore. “The external environment is
clearly dominating the currency markets.”  The rupiah lost 0.6 percent today and 0.7 percent this week
to 8,563 per dollar as of 4:07 p.m. in Jakarta, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. The currency touched 8,599, the
weakest level since June 30.  Global funds sold $66.5 million more Indonesian shares than
they bought yesterday, exchange data show. The  Jakarta Composite
Index (JCI)  slumped 4.9 percent today, the most since Nov. 2008.  Ten-year  government bonds  rose today and for the week. The
yield on the 8.25 percent note due July 2021 slid one basis
point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 6.84 percent, according to
closing prices from the Inter-Dealer Market Association. The
rate fell 19 basis points this week.  To contact the reporter on this story:
