Wall Street  has never been more sure
that the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index will rally in 2011, even
after speculation the U.S. economy is heading for a recession
prompted the biggest plunge since the  bull market  began.  Chief strategists at 13 banks from  Barclays Plc (BARC)  to  UBS AG (UBSN) 
see the benchmark measure of American equity surging 17 percent
through Dec. 31, the average estimate in a Bloomberg survey.
Their projection that the index will reach 1,401 hasn’t budged
in four weeks, while mounting concern U.S. growth is slowing
drove the S&P 500 down 11 percent since July 22, including
yesterday’s 4.8 percent tumble.  About $1.8 trillion has been erased from American equities
as reports on manufacturing and consumer spending showed the
world’s largest economy is slowing. Forecasters at UBS and
 Deutsche Bank AG (DBK)  say rising profits mean the S&P 500 deserves a
higher price-earnings ratio than the 28-month low reached
yesterday. A year ago, strategists also remained bullish after a
14 percent drop, and proved prescient as the  S&P 500  rallied 20
percent from its August low.  “I’m reluctant to overreact to some shorter-term weakness,
no matter how real it is, because the market has proven to be
unbelievably resilient,”  Jonathan Golub , the chief U.S. market
strategist at UBS in New York, said in an Aug. 3 phone
interview. “If you would have been acting that way for the last
two years, you would have gotten killed by this market.
Companies have done an absurdly good job of managing through
this environment.”  Most Since 2009  Golub says the S&P 500 will end the year at 1,425. It fell
yesterday to an eight-month low of 1,200.07 amid a global rout,
extending a nine-day retreat to 11 percent. That was the biggest
loss over the same amount of time since March 9, 2009, when the
gauge ended a 17-month  bear market . The MSCI All-Country World
Index slid 4.1 percent yesterday, the most since March 2009. The
Stoxx Europe 600 Index fell to the lowest level since July 2010,
while Brazil’s index sank the most since 2008, as commodities
producers dropped.  The S&P 500 fell 0.1 percent to 1,199.38 at 4 p.m. in New
York, bringing its weekly loss to 7.2 percent, the most since
November 2008. Treasuries and the dollar fell today.  A year ago, stocks also fell as investors speculated the
 U.S. economy  would contract. Equities plunged until Federal
Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  foreshadowed $600 billion in
bond purchases meant to prevent deflation and stimulate growth
at a Aug. 27, 2010, meeting in  Jackson Hole , Wyoming.  Pimco’s Gross  Bill Gross , who runs the world’s biggest bond fund at
Pacific Investment Management Co., told Bloomberg Television on
Aug. 2 that another asset-purchase program may be announced by
the Fed, even after President Barack Obama signed a deficit
reduction plan that demands less government spending.  Should a plan materialize, it won’t have the same impact as
last year, said Mark Luschini of Janney Montgomery Scott LLC,
which manages about $54 billion.  “The macroeconomic issues are trumping the good earnings
picture,” Luschini, the chief investment strategist at the
Philadelphia-based firm, said in a phone interview on Aug. 3.
For valuations to rise, “we’d have to have better economic
conditions than we do at the moment, and that’s not evident,”
he said.  Expecting Growth  Strategists say earnings growth will fuel gains. S&P 500
profit will rise 18 percent in 2011 and 14 percent in 2012,
according to the average per-share analyst estimates in a
Bloomberg survey. More than 75 percent of corporations in the
index have exceeded earnings estimates for the second quarter,
with total income topping projections by 5.2 percent.  Credit Suisse Group AG (CSGN)  and  HSBC Holdings Plc (HSBA)  advised
investors to buy equities today. Andrew Garthwaite, a London-
based strategist at Credit Suisse, reiterated an “overweight”
recommendation on stocks even as he cut his year-end forecast
for the S&P 500 to 1,350.  “Our economists are not forecasting a recession and,
indeed, are looking for U.S. growth to accelerate in the second
half,” Garry Evans, global head of equity strategy at HSBC in
Hong Kong, wrote in a note today. “Investors should look to
raise equity risk gradually over the summer.”  Even as companies from  Ford Motor Co. (F)  to Boeing Co. beat
forecasts, the S&P 500 has plunged as investors turned their
attention to reports showing slower economic growth. Consumer
spending fell 0.2 percent in June, personal incomes grew at the
slowest pace since November and an index of American
manufacturing sank to a two-year low.  Not ‘Well-Reasoned’  “It’s unlikely I will change my view because we had a bad
week or get really excited because we had a good week,”  Tobias Levkovich ,  Citigroup Inc. (C) ’s chief U.S. equity strategist in New
York, said in an Aug. 3 phone interview. “That’s not a well-
reasoned market outlook,” said Levkovich, who forecasts the S&P
500 will end the year at 1,400. “That’s a reactive trader
mindset, but that’s not what I’m supposed to be doing.”  The combination of falling prices and rising profits has
driven the S&P 500’s price-earnings ratio down 17 percent since
Feb. 18, data compiled by Bloomberg show. At 13.2 times profit,
the valuation is 20 percent below the average since 1954.  Following the drop in valuations, “our view is growth
picks up, and like last summer/fall as the data turn up, they
will take the equity market up with it,” Binky Chadha, Deutsche
Bank’s chief U.S. equity strategist in New York, said in an Aug.
2 e-mail. He said the index will reach 1,550, the highest
projection in the Bloomberg survey.  Last Year’s Rebound  The S&P 500 bottomed in 2010 at 1,022.58 on July 2. Gross
domestic product expanded at an annual rate of 2.5 percent and
2.3 percent in the third and fourth quarters. The  stock index 
rallied 10 percent to 1,127.79 through Aug. 9, before slipping
7.1 percent to 1,047.22 by Aug. 26.  At the time, strategists said the index would rise to 1,234
through the end of 2010, according to the average estimate.
Three days later, Bernanke said the central bank would “do all
that it can” to sustain growth, foreshadowing the bond-purchase
program revealed two months later. The August announcement
helped catapult the S&P 500 to 1,257.64 as of Dec. 31 and
1,343.01 by Feb. 18, a 28 percent advance.  Laszlo Birinyi, one of the first investors to recommend
buying stocks when the bull market began in March 2009, said
this week that stocks shouldn’t be abandoned.  More Scotch  “It’s like all these times when you second-guess yourself,
and you probably wake up a little earlier than you’re used to,
and maybe you put an extra finger of scotch in the glass,”
Birinyi said in an Aug. 2 telephone interview. “It’s probably a
good idea to have a gut check once in a while, because it makes
you review and rethink your process. Our view is that this is
still a market of some duration.”  The S&P 500 had the second-best performance in 2011 among
the world’s 10 biggest stock markets through yesterday, even
after the 12 percent slump since April 29 brought the year-to-
date decline to 4.6 percent. China’s Shanghai Stock Exchange
Composite Index did best with a 4.4 percent drop. Japan’s Topix
lost 8.1 percent, while the  FTSE 100 Index (UKX)  of U.K. stocks
dropped 8.6 percent.  “Doing this 22 years, to me this has to be the type of
bottoming that the U.S. needed to just clean the slate,”  Brian Belski , the New York-based chief investment strategist at
Oppenheimer & Co., said in a telephone interview yesterday. “A
year ago, we were only a couple quarters into the rebound, now
we’re further in. There was less belief a year ago because
nobody really believed forward earnings growth. Now they’ve
proven themselves.” He estimates the S&P 500 will reach 1,325.  No Contraction  Barry Knapp, the New York-based chief U.S. equity
strategist at Barclays, said that it’s unlikely the economy will
contract even though data show a slowdown. The Citigroup
Economic Surprise Index has averaged negative 95.05 since
sinking on June 3 to negative 117.20, meaning reports were
missing the median estimate in Bloomberg surveys by the most
since January 2009.  “If you sell stocks at 1,250, that’s a bet we’re going
back to a recession, and we don’t buy that,” Knapp said in a
telephone interview yesterday. His year-end projection is 1,450.
“The probability of the U.S. going back into a recession is
low. These things have a way of running their course.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
