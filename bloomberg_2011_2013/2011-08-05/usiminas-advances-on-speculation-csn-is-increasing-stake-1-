Usinas Siderurgicas de Minas Gerais
SA,  Brazil ’s second-biggest steelmaker, gained the most since
December 2008 on speculation rival Cia. Siderurgica Nacional SA
is boosting its stake in the company.  Common shares of Usiminas, as Usinas Siderurgicas is known,
jumped 10 percent at the close of Sao Paulo trading at 4:15 p.m.
New York time. Preferred shares rose 5.8 percent to 10.70 reais.  “Shares have fallen a lot in the past few days,”  Pedro
Galdi , an analyst at Sao Paulo-based brokerage SLW Corretora,
said in a telephone interview. “CSN could be seizing the
opportunity to buy more, or other people may be buying now,
betting prices will go up when CSN starts buying again.”  CSN, as Cia. Siderurgica is known, may buy more shares in
Usiminas after building a 10 percent stake in its rival, Chief
Financial Officer Alberto Monteiro said Aug. 3 on a conference
call.  A CSN official, who asked not to be named because of
internal policies, declined to comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
