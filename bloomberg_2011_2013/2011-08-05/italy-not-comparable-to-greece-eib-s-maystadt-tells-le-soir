Economic difficulties in the European
Union are country-specific and the situation in  Italy  is not
comparable with Greece or Ireland, European Investment Bank
President Philippe Maystadt said, Le Soir reported citing an
 interview .  Maystadt said that to allay market concerns in the short-
term national governments need to ratify an agreement reached by
euro-area leaders on July 21 and the bloc needs to adopt a
legislative package aimed at reinforcing economic governance,
according to the newspaper.  To contact the reporters on this story:
