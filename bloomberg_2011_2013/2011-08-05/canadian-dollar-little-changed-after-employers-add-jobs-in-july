Canada ’s dollar fell for a second
week versus its U.S. counterpart on concern slowing global
economic growth will weigh on demand for raw materials and
increase risk aversion.  The currency fluctuated today amid volatile stock markets
after data showed the economy of the U.S., the nation’s largest
trading partner, added more jobs last month than forecast and
Canada added jobs for a fourth month. Crude oil, the nation’s
biggest export, fell for a second week.  “The initial euphoria over the better-than-expected U.S.
employment report has already started to fade,” said  Joe Manimbo , a market analyst in  Washington  at Travelex Global
Business Payments, a currency-exchange network. “That is
pressuring some of those commodity-sensitive currencies.”  The loonie, as the currency is called for the image of the
waterfowl on the C$1 coin, declined 2.8 percent this week. It
fell 0.1 percent to 98.20 cents per  U.S. dollar  at 5 p.m. in
Toronto after strengthening earlier to as much as 97.42 cents
and falling to 98.54. One Canadian dollar buys $1.0183.  Government bonds  fell, pushing the yield on Canada’s
benchmark 10-year note 13 basis points higher to 2.64 percent. A
basis point is 0.01 percentage point. The 3.25 percent security
maturing in June 2021 fell $1.20 to C$105.28.  Jobs Data  U.S. payrolls increased 117,000 jobs after a revised 46,000
rise in June, government data showed. The media estimate in a
Bloomberg News survey projected a gain of 85,000.  The Canadian economy added fewer jobs than forecast in
July, increasing 7,100 on a seasonally adjusted basis,
 Statistics Canada  reported. It was the fourth straight monthly
gain and compared with a Bloomberg survey forecast of 15,000 and
an increase of 28,400 in June. The jobless rate fell to 7.2
percent, from 7.4 percent in June.  “It was slightly weaker than expected on the headline,”
said  Camilla Sutton , head of currency strategy at Bank of Nova
Scotia in Toronto. “But some of the details highlight that some
of the losses were in education, which is a seasonal adjustment
factor.”  The Canadian dollar fell yesterday after the Bank of  Japan 
followed its Swiss counterpart in moving to weaken its currency.
Finance Minister  Yoshihiko Noda  saying the Japanese action was
unilateral following joint yen sales by Group of Seven nations
in March. The  Swiss National Bank  cut its target for the three-
month London interbank offered rate to “as close to zero as
possible” to curb the franc’s gains.  Stocks Drop  The loonie dropped versus 12 of its 16 most-traded
counterparts this week as the MSCI World Index, a measure of
stocks in developed nations, tumbled 8.6 percent.  Crude oil futures rose 0.6 percent to $87.15 a barrel in
 New York  and fell 8.9 percent for the week.  The yield on the December 2011 bankers’ acceptances, a
barometer of short-term interest rate expectations, fell to 1.16
percent, the lowest since the contract started trading in
December 2008, as traders slashed bets the central bank would
raise rates amid slowing global growth.  The  Bank of Canada  has held the benchmark overnight rate at
1 percent since September after raising it three times last
year. Governor Mark Carney said July 20 the central bank won’t
be “mechanical” in raising rates during the recovery, because
of the risks posed by a strong currency and slow U.S. growth.
The central bank published a note that day that said interest
rates can remain below their long-run average even after the
economy recovers, if economic “headwinds” are slowing growth.  To contact the reporter for this story:
