U.S. stock-index futures retreated,
indicating the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index may extend its
biggest selloff since February 2009, as investors await a jobs
report amid concern the world’s largest economy is faltering.  Exxon Mobil Corp. and  Chevron Corp. (CVX)  both lost more than 2
percent in Germany as crude oil declined for a sixth day.  Alcoa
Inc. (AA) , the largest U.S. aluminum producer, slumped 2.8 percent as
metal prices retreated. Banks including  JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM)  and
 Bank of America Corp. (BAC)  also dropped.  Futures on the S&P 500 expiring in September dropped 0.8
percent to 1,189.7 at 6:02 a.m. in  New York . Dow Jones
Industrial Average futures lost 88 points, or 0.8 percent, to
11,283.  “The move in equities relative to bonds has been really
shocking,” said Trevor Greetham, director of  asset allocation 
at Fidelity International in an interview with Bloomberg
Television. “If we get a positive payrolls number, markets
would rally very strongly. Lead indicators are still very
negative, so I would be tempted to sell into that rally.”  U.S. stocks plunged yesterday as concern that the global
economy is weakening prompted a global rout that has wiped off
more than $4.4 trillion from equity market values worldwide
since July 26. The benchmark  S&P 500  has lost 7.1 percent so far
this week, on course for the biggest five-day selloff since at
least November 2008.  U.S. Jobs, Unemployment  Today’s non-farm payrolls report may show that U.S.
employers failed to create enough jobs in July to reduce the
jobless rate, economists said. Payrolls climbed by 85,000
workers after an 18,000 increase in June that was the smallest
this year, according to the median forecast in a Bloomberg News
survey.  The Labor Department release, due at 8:30 a.m. in
 Washington , may also show that the jobless rate held at 9.2
percent after rising in each of the previous three months. Data
yesterday showed initial claims for unemployment insurance
payments fell last week to a level that shows limited
improvement in the labor market.  Exxon lost 2.3 percent to $72.18 in  Germany  and Chevron
retreated 2.6 percent to $94.28 as crude oil fell to its lowest
price in eight months as investors speculated that fuel demand
will falter as the U.S. economy stalls.  Alcoa lost 2.8 percent to $12.58 in early New York trading
as base metals tumbled on the London Metal Exchange.  JPMorgan lost 2.4 percent to $37.02 in Germany, while Bank
of America retreated 3.7 percent to $8.50 in early New York
trading. The two biggest U.S. banks respectively tumbled 5
percent and 7.4 percent yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
