U.S. sales and rentals of home videos
declined 3.6 percent to $3.99 billion in the second quarter, led
by a 16 percent drop in consumer purchases of packaged discs, an
industry trade group said.  Blu-ray and online purchases increased, partly countering
the drop in sales and rentals of DVDs, Los Angeles-based  Digital
Entertainment Group  said today in an e-mailed statement.  Movie studios are offering high-definition discs and
digital content to make up for declines in the sale of standard
DVDs. Home entertainment is the film and television industry’s
most profitable revenue source because much of a movie’s
production and marketing expense is covered by theater ticket
sales.  Revenue from subscription rental services, including discs
and streaming, rose 24 percent during the quarter to $808.2
million, the studio-backed group said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
