The  European Central Bank  may come
under pressure to cut  interest rates  amid a global economic
slowdown and a deterioration of the region’s debt crisis, Royal
Bank of Scotland Group Plc economists said.  “With other central banks increasingly under pressure to
respond to their own renewed challenges, it is not inconceivable
to see the ECB forced to cut interest rates,” RBS’s Jacques Cailloux and  Nick Matthews  wrote in a research note to clients
dated yesterday. “This could happen if other central banks
engage in additional quantitative easing” or if a “total
seizing-up of funding markets” is observed.  The London-based economists pushed back their forecast for
higher ECB interest rates to the third quarter of next year from
October, “fully recognizing the high level of uncertainty and
conditionality of the call.”  “The resumption of the normalization process will be
dictated by the speed and efficacy of the policy response to
stabilize the financial system,” Cailloux and Matthews wrote.  To contact the reporter on this story:
