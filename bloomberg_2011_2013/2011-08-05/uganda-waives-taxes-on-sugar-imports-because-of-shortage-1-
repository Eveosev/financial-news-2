Uganda  will waive all taxes on sugar
imports for six months to attract enough imports to meet demand
because of a domestic shortage, said Fred Omach, the
minister of state for finance.  Uganda wants to import 40,000 metric tons of sugar, Omach
told reporters in the capital, Kampala, today. The five-member
East Africa Community bloc agreed to the tax waiver, he said.  A kilogram (2.2 pounds) of sugar costs 7,000 Uganda
shillings ($2.61), up from 3,000 shillings at the end of June
because of the shortage, Jim Kabeho, chairman of the Uganda
Sugar Cane Technologists Association, said yesterday.  Demand for sugar from neighboring countries in South Sudan
and  Rwanda  has contributed to the Uganda shortage, and
supermarkets restricted sales to 2 kilograms a customer, Kabeho
said. Uganda consumed 346,000 tons of sugar last year and
imported 130,000 tons, according to the association.  To contact the reporter on this story:
