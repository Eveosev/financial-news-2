Wheat fell for a third day in
 Chicago , extending the biggest drop in five weeks, as
commodities and equities plunged on concern a faltering global
economy will curb demand. Corn and soybeans slid.  The S&P GSCI Spot Index of raw materials retreated for an
eighth day, the longest losing streak since December 2008. The
MSCI World Index of shares slumped to the lowest level since
November. Figures today may show U.S. employment growth in July
was too weak to reduce the country’s 9.2 percent jobless rate.  “Markets seem to be increasing their bets that the U.S.
economic recovery indeed turns negative,”  Luke Mathews , a
commodity strategist at Commonwealth Bank of  Australia , said by
phone from Sydney today. “As long as this wider  risk aversion 
persists, we think that grain markets are susceptible to further
selling pressure.”  Wheat for December delivery dropped 11 cents, or 1.5
percent, to $7.145 a bushel by 11:11 a.m.  London  time on the
Chicago Board of Trade. The grain is little changed for the week
after falling 3.3 percent yesterday, the most since June 30, and
is down 10 percent this year.  Prices also declined on signs importers favor cheaper
Russian wheat, reducing demand for supplies from the U.S., the
world’s top exporter.  Egypt , the largest global importer, bought
180,000 metric tons from  Russia  in a tender yesterday at $261.94
and $262.50 a ton. As of July 22, U.S. soft wheat for export
traded at $275.30 a ton.  Milling wheat for November delivery traded on NYSE Liffe in
Paris slid 3 euros, or 1.5 percent, to 193.75 euros ($274.10) a
ton.  Purchases Scrapped  The U.S. reported overseas buyers last week canceled a net
405,598 tons of soybean purchases, the most since 1990. Exports
of corn since Sept. 1 are 7.9 percent lower than a year earlier.
Both crops retreated for a third day today.  Corn for December delivery declined 12.75 cents, or 1.8
percent, to $6.8875 a bushel in Chicago, paring this week’s gain
to 3 percent. The grain has climbed 9.5 percent this year on
speculation hot, dry weather that followed excessive rainfall
during planting will curb yields.  Soybeans for November delivery fell 16.25 cents, or 1.2
percent, to $13.29 a bushel. The oilseed is down 2.1 percent
this week and 5.3 percent this year.  Prices also dropped as the U.S. Dollar Index, a six-
currency gauge of the greenback’s strength, headed for its
biggest weekly increase since May. A stronger U.S. currency
makes crops from the country more expensive in terms of other
monies. The index is up 1.5 percent this week.  To contact the reporters on this story:
