Lear Corp. (LEA)  said European Union
antitrust regulators asked it for information as part of a probe
into possible collusion between suppliers of electric and
electronic car parts.  Terrence Larkin, the company’s general counsel, said it
received a “supplemental request for information” and the
company was cooperating with authorities. EU officials visited
the company’s Paris offices in February 2010, he said on a
conference call yesterday.  Southfield, Michigan-based Lear isn’t involved in similar
investigations in the U.S. or  Japan , he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
