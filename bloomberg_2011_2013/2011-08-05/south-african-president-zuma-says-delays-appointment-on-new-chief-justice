South African President  Jacob Zuma 
said he has delayed the appointment of a new Chief Justice to
give more time for consultations.  The process to appoint a replacement for Sandile Ngcobo
will be concluded “shortly after” his contract expires on Aug.
14, Zuma said in a copy of a speech e-mailed today.  Zuma said he was also seeking more clarity on a report by
the graft ombudsman on police department leases. The Public
Protector found the national police commissioner flauted
procurement rules when agreeing to the leases.  To contact the reporter on this story:
