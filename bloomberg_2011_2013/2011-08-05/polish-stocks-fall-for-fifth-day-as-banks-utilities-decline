Polish stocks plunged for a fifth
day, sending the benchmark WIG20 stock index to its lowest close
in almost a year, led lower by banks and utilities on fears of a
global economic slowdown.  The index declined 1.6 percent to 2,447.21 at the 5:30 p.m.
close, following world indexes lower. The MSCI Emerging Markets
Index dropped 3.6 percent to 1,034.66.  PGE SA, Poland’s largest power utility, retreated 4.2
percent to 21.26 zloty, falling for a third day, and  Polskie
Gornictwo Naftowe i Gazownictwo SA (PGN) , the largest gas company,
lost 3.6 percent to 3.8 zloty.  Bank Pekao SA (PEO) , the second-largest
lender, slipped 2.3 percent to an almost two-year low of 143.6
zloty.  Stocks around  Europe  retreated, with the benchmark Stoxx
Europe 600 Index headed toward its biggest weekly loss since
November 2008, as a U.S. jobs report failed to allay concern
that the global economy is struggling.  Poland’s zloty currency weakened to a record low against
the Swiss franc, dropping as much as 1.4 percent to 3.7659, its
weakest intraday level since Bloomberg started tracking the data
in 1998, and traded down 0.2 percent to 3.7189 as of 6:17 p.m.
in Warsaw. Against the euro, the Polish currency depreciated 0.2
percent to 4.0363.  To contact the reporter on this story:
