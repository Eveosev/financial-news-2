Macquarie Group Ltd. (MQG) , Australia’s
largest investment bank, tumbled the most since 2008 in Sydney
trading as market volatility surges around the world on concern
about European sovereign debt and the U.S. economy.  Macquarie dropped 7.8 percent to A$23.09 as of 10:29 a.m.
in Sydney, taking this year’s decline to 38 percent. The shares
fell as much as 11.4 percent today, the most since Dec. 2, 2008.  Tumbling markets threaten Chief Executive Officer Nicholas Moore’s forecast, made last week, that full-year profit will top
the A$956 million ($998 million) reported for the year ending
March 31. Analysts surveyed by Bloomberg News last week said
markets will need to rebound in coming months for Moore to meet
his forecast. Concern the U.S. economy is faltering sparked a
global equities rout that drove the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index
to its worst slump since February 2009.  The six-member S&P/ASX 200 banks index, which includes the
nation’s four largest lenders led by Commonwealth Bank of
 Australia  and Westpac Banking Corp., fell 2.1 percent to its
lowest in more than two years.  To contact the reporter for this story:
