South Africa ’s stock gauge suffered
its biggest weekly drop in 15 months as world markets and
commodity prices continued to tumble on concern the U.S.
economic recovery is faltering.  The FTSE/JSE Africa All Share index slumped 1.2 percent to
29,256.75 by the 5 p.m. close in Johannesburg, taking its
retreat this week to 6.3 percent, the biggest five-day decline
since May 2010. BHP Billiton Ltd., the world’s largest mining
company, fell for a tenth day, the longest losing streak on
record, closing 2.3 percent lower. Anglo American Plc dropped
2.3 percent to the lowest since Oct. 4 as copper plunged 10
percent from its February record on concern that the global
economy is slowing, reducing demand for raw materials.  More than $4.5 trillion has been wiped off equity-market
values worldwide since July 26, driving the MSCI index of global
shares down more than 10 percent from this year’s high in a so-
called correction. The JSE has fallen 12 percent from its Feb.
14 closing high of 33,094.06.  “The market has fallen far too much now,” Wayne McCurrie,
a portfolio manager at Johannesburg-based RMB Asset Management,
said by phone. “If you were a brave investor you would be
buying.”  Earlier, the JSE pared its decline of as much as 3.3
percent after U.S. jobs data came in better than expected,
easing concern that recovery in the world’s biggest economy is
grinding to a halt. U.S. payrolls rose by 117,000 workers after
a 46,000 increase in June that was more than originally
estimated, Labor Department data showed today in  Washington . The
median estimate in a Bloomberg News survey called for a July
gain of 85,000.  Foreign Sellers  “The market could bounce 3 percent to 4 percent if the
number is better than expected,” McCurrie said before the  data
were released.  Foreign investors were net sellers of 500.6 million rand
($72 million) of South African shares yesterday, taking their
total sales this year to 77.9 million rand. That compares with
23.1 billion rand of net purchases for the same period a year
earlier, according to data compiled by JSE Ltd., which manages
the nation’s stock and bond exchanges.  To contact the reporter on this story:
