Oil fell to the lowest in eight
months in  New York , set for the biggest weekly decline since
May, on speculation fuel demand will falter as U.S. economic
growth stumbles and  Europe ’s debt crisis worsens.  Futures dropped as much as 4.3 percent after tumbling 5.8
percent yesterday. Equities in Asia and Europe slumped. The U.S.
added 85,000 jobs last month, leaving the 9.2 percent
unemployment rate unchanged, according to economists surveyed
before data today.  Brent crude  rebounded after an oil pipeline
explosion in  Iran , highlighting supply concerns from the world’s
biggest producing region.  “In terms of the oil market the recent correction is part
of the broader move we saw in equities,”  Harry Tchilinguirian ,
head of commodity-markets strategy at BNP Paribas SA said. “We
have greater cross asset correlation since 2009 due to the
injection of vast amounts of liquidity by central banks.”  Crude for September delivery dropped as much as $3.76 to
$82.87 a barrel in electronic trading on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange , the lowest intraday price since Nov. 26. The contract
traded at $86.08 a barrel as of 12:17 p.m. London time. A close
at that level would mean a fall of 10 percent this week, the
biggest weekly drop since the first week in May.  Brent for September settlement on the London-based ICE
Futures Europe exchange rose as much as 2 percent to $109.38 a
barrel and last traded at $108.38 a barrel. It fell as much as
2.8 percent earlier today. The European benchmark is up 14
percent this year. Its premium to U.S. futures widened to $22.20
a barrel. The spread closed at a record $22.67 on Aug. 2.  Pipeline Explosion  An Iranian oil pipeline exploded today in Larstan in the
west of the country, the state-run Mehr news service said. Flows
will resume in a few hours, the service said. The nation is the
second-biggest producer in the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries.  “The fundamentals didn’t deteriorate in one day to such an
extent to warrant this sell off,” Amrita Sen, an oil analyst at
Barclays Plc, said by phone from  London . “It’s going to remain
choppy from here with the macro environment so uncertain.”  Crude in New York, which fell below a long-term Fibonacci
support yesterday, has crossed the bottom of a technical
downtrend channel at about $85.20 a barrel, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. The 14-day relative strength index for
West Texas Intermediate futures also dropped below 30, signaling
the market may have fallen too quickly. Today’s reading is 27.1,
the lowest since May 2010.  ‘Long WTI’  BNP Paribas’ Tchilinguirian said the oil price may rise,
partly because of uncertainty of supply. “ China’s economy  will
accelerate in the second half of the year, supporting oil demand
growth,” he said. “Thus going long oil WTI at $85-$86 is
extremely attractive.”  The Stoxx Europe 600 Index plunged as much as 3.3 percent,
extending its loss for the week to 11 percent. The MSCI  Asia 
Pacific Index fell 4.1 percent, taking its weekly loss to 8.1
percent. That will be the steepest one-week drop since October
2008, when credit markets froze following the bankruptcy of
Lehman Brother Holdings Inc. a month earlier.  The Labor Department’s data are due at 8:30 a.m. in
 Washington .  The Bloomberg Consumer Comfort Index was minus 47.6 in the
week to July 31, the lowest since May. Confidence among women
fell to the lowest level since October 2009, while Americans
making more than $100,000 a year were the most pessimistic since
November 2009.  Tropical Storm Emily was broken up by 10,000-foot (3,000-
meter) mountains in  Haiti  and the  Dominican Republic  and storm
warnings throughout the Caribbean were dropped. Emily’s maximum
winds have fallen to 35 miles (56 kilometers) per hour, below
the threshold of 39 mph used to designate a system as a tropical
storm, according to the U.S. National Hurricane Center.  To contact the reporter on this story:
