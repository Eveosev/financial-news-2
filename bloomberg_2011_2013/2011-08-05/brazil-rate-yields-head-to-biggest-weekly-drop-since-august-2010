Yields on Brazilian interest-rate
futures contracts due in January 2013 are headed to the biggest
weekly tumble since August 2010 after central bank President
Alexandre Tombini said inflation will slow starting in
September.  Yields on the contract due January 2013 were unchanged at
12.35 percent at 9 a.m.  New York  time. They have fallen 34 basis
points, or 0.34 percentage point, to 12.35 percent this week.
Yields on the contract fell 34 basis points in the period ended
Aug. 20, 2010.  Brazil ’s consumer inflation rose at the second-slowest pace
in 11 months last month, the national statistics agency said
today. Tombini said yesterday that policy makers are “more
comfortable” with inflation because annual price increases will
slow starting in September.  “The central bank may cut  interest rates  starting in the
second half of next year,” Ines Filipa, chief economist at ICAP
do Brasil CTVM, said in a telephone interview from  Rio de
Janeiro .  Consumer prices, as measured by the IPCA index, rose 0.16
percent in July, compared with a 0.18 percent median forecast
from 46 economists surveyed by Bloomberg, and a 0.15 percent
rise in June. Annual inflation quickened to 6.87 percent from a
year ago.  The central bank targets an annual inflation rate of 4.5
percent, plus or minus 2 percentage points.  The real gained 0.3 percent to 1.5829 per dollar, paring
its weekly loss to 2.1 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
