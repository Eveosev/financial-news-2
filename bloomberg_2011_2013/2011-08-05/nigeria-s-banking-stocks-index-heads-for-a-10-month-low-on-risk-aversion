Nigeria’s  banking-stock index
declined to a 10-month low as concern economic recovery in the
U.S. and Europe may stall curbed demand for riskier assets.  The  Bloomberg NSE Banking (NGSEB10)  Index, which tracks the
performance of the 10 most capitalized banks, fell for a ninth
day, the longest streak since March 8, dropping 3.8 percent to
328.85, its lowest value since Sept. 29, by the 2:30 p.m. close
in Lagos.  Zenith Bank Plc (ZENITHBA) , Nigeria’s biggest lender by market
value, lost the maximum daily limit of 5 percent to 13.59 naira.  Reports this week on unemployment claims, manufacturing and
spending pointed to a slowdown in the U.S., the world’s biggest
economy. The European Commission called for another
reinforcement of the European Financial Stability Facility, the
440 billion-euro ($623 billion) rescue fund for distressed euro-
area states.  “There is a global pessimism towards equities that is
overwhelming the positive trend in Nigerian banks,” Adesoji
Solanke, a Lagos-based analyst with  Renaissance Capital , said by
phone today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
