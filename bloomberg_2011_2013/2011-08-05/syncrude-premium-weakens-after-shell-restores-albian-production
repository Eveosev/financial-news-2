Syncrude’s premium to benchmark West
Texas Intermediate weakened after  Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA) 
completed maintenance at its Albian oil-sands site in  Alberta .  Unplanned maintenance that began in mid-July and reduced
output was completed and operations returned to normal, Stephen
Doolan, a company spokesman, said in an e-mail yesterday.  The premium for Syncrude narrowed $1.30 to $14.15 a barrel
above West Texas Intermediate at 12:04 p.m. in  New York ,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Syncrude is a light,
low-sulfur synthetic oil derived from the tar sands in Alberta.  The spread for Western Canada Select strengthened 95 cents
to a discount of $14.90 a barrel.  Light Louisiana Sweet’s premium added 95 cents to $23.95 a
barrel. Heavy Louisiana Sweet gained 60 cents a barrel to $24.35
over WTI.  Among sour, or high-sulfur, grades, the premium for Mars
Blend added 90 cents to $20. Poseidon’s increased $1.05 to $20.  Southern Green Canyon’s premium gained $1 to $18 a barrel
over WTI. West Texas Sour’s discount narrowed 5 cents to 95
cents. Thunder Horse’s premium added $1.25 to $24.50.  To contact the reporter on this story:
