Vietnam ’s benchmark five-year bonds
declined for a third week on speculation inflation accelerated
in August, which may prompt policy makers to raise  interest
rates .  Vietnam’s consumer price index is forecast to rise 1
percent in August from July, the magazine Dau Tu Chung Khoan
reported today, citing the Ministry of Finance’s domestic market
management department. Vietnam will maintain a tight monetary
policy in August, Nguyen Xuan Phuc, former-chairman of the
government office, said July 24, after inflation jumped to 22.16
percent from a year earlier in July.  The yield on five-year bonds rose seven basis points, or
0.07 percentage point, this week to 12.59 percent, according to
a daily fixing rate from banks compiled by Bloomberg. It was
four basis points higher from yesterday.  The dong weakened 0.1 percent to 20,605 per dollar as of
4:35 p.m. in Hanoi from the end of last week, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  The central bank fixed the reference rate at 20,608,
unchanged since July 11, according to its website. The currency
is allowed to trade up to 1 percent on either side of the rate.  -- Nicholas Heath . Editor: Simon Harvey  To contact the reporter on this story:
