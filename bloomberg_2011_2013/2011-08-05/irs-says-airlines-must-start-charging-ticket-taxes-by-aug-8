Airlines must resume charging U.S.
ticket taxes by 12:01 a.m. Aug. 8, said Frank Keith, a Internal
Revenue Service spokesman.  A bill reinstating the  Federal Aviation Administration â€™s
taxing authority through Sept. 16 is heading to President Barack
Obama for his signature. The taxes had lapsed July 22, and the
law would impose them retroactively.  The IRS will not attempt to collect taxes from passengers
or airlines for tickets purchased since July 22. Most airlines
raised their fares to cover the amount of the lapsed tax.  To contact the reporter on this story:
