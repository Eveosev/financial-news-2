The franc weakened after Swiss
National Bank President Philipp Hildebrand called the currency’s
strength “absurd” and said the bank won’t exclude “further
measures” to curb its advance.  The franc slid against all 16 of its major peers tracked by
Bloomberg. “We clearly communicated that we are willing to take
further measures if those are necessary,” Hildebrand was quoted
as saying in an interview in Neue Zuercher Zeitung.  ``The bounce in euro-swiss is linked to people being afraid 
of intervention,'' said  Sebastien Galy , a foreign-exchange 
strategist at Societe Generale SA in  London . ``At the moment it 
is just speculation, but we would expect a package of measures 
from the SNB even if not classical intervention.''  The franc depreciated 1.1 percent to 1.08787 per euro as of
8:27 a.m. in London, paring its gain for the week to 3.8
percent. It reached a record 1.07112 earlier today. The franc
dropped 0.7 percent against the dollar to 76.89 centimes.  SNB spokesman Walter Meier declined to comment on today's
move in the franc.  To contact the reporter on this story:
