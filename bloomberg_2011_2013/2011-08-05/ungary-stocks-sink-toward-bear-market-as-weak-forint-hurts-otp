Hungarian stocks tumbled, sending the
benchmark BUX Index down more than 20 percent from its 2011
high, as the forint’s depreciation against the Swiss franc risks
boosting bad loans.  OTP Bank Nyrt., the country’s largest lender, plummeted as
much as 7 percent to 4,345 forint and traded at 4,564 by 11:52
a.m. in Budapest. The BUX declined as much as 4.7 percent to
19,117.886, the lowest level since September 2009. It was last
3.1 percent lower, headed for its worst week since May 2010.  The European Union’s most indebted eastern member is
getting hurt as global equities tumble on concern U.S. growth is
stalling and the  European Central Bank ’s measures are inadequate
to contain the region’s debt crisis.  “Some measure of calm could enter the markets if the
European Central Bank announced more categorical measures, which
could meaningfully reduce contagion risk,” analysts at
Raiffeisen Bank  Hungary  said in an e-mail today. OTP is a
“falling knife,” Raiffeisen said.  Investors are concerned banks will face losses on foreign-
currency loan defaults as the forint falls to a record against
the Swiss franc, weakening as much as 1.5 percent to 254.64 and
traded at 252.67 at 11:53 a.m. The currency has depreciated 5.4
percent against the franc this month, the second-worst
performance among 25 emerging market currencies tracked by
Bloomberg.  The index has lost more than 20 percent from this year’s
high in April, poised to enter a so-called  bear market .  Mol Nyrt., Hungary’s largest refiner, tumbled 3.2 percent
to 18,100 forint, the lowest since June 2010. Mol’s Croatian
subsidiary INA Industrija Nafte d.d. said late yesterday that
the government in Zagreb revoked its license to explore for
hydrocarbons in northwestern Croatian, hurting the company’s
business and investment plans.  To contact the reporters on this story:
