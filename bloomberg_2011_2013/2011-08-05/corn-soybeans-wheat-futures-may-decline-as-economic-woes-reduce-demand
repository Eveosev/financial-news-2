What follows are opening calls for
U.S. grain and oilseed markets.  -- Corn futures are called to open 3 cents to 5 cents a bushel
lower on the  Chicago  Board of Trade on speculation that the
world economy will slow, reducing demand for  animal feed , fuel
and food made from the grain, Mike Zuzolo, the president of
Global Commodity Analytics & Consulting LLC in Lafayette,
Indiana, said in a telephone interview. Hot July weather that
damaged U.S. crops may support prices, he said.  -- Soybean futures may open 3 cents to 5 cents a bushel lower in
Chicago as Bank of America Merrill Lynch cut its growth
forecasts for some Southeast Asian economies, signaling less
commodity demand, Zuzolo said. Soybean-oil futures are expected
to open down 0.15 cent to 0.25 cent a pound, and soybean-meal
futures may open steady to 50 cents lower for 2,000 pounds.  -- Wheat futures may open 3 cents to 5 cents a bushel lower on
the CBOT, the Kansas City Board of Trade and the  Minneapolis
Grain Exchange  as slowing growth and rising global production
reduces demand for supplies from the U.S., Zuzolo said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
