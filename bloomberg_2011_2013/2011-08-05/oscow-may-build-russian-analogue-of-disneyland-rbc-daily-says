Moscow’s new mayor,  Sergei Sobyanin ,
has taken up the idea of building a Russian analogue of
Disneyland on wasteland in the city’s northwest, RBC Daily
 reported , citing people it didn’t identify.  The  City Hall  may announce a tender to develop the park by
year-end, the newspaper said. The plan to build a “Russian
Disneyland” in this location was first proposed by Soviet
leader Nikita Khrushchev in the 1960s and revived by Moscow’s
previous mayor, Yury Luzhkov, in the 1990s, RBC Daily said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
