Anyone looking to take advantage of
this week’s drop in U.S. stocks would be well advised to play
defense, according to Andrew Burkly, a strategist at Brown
Brothers Harriman & Co.  Investors should focus on companies least affected by
economic swings, Burkly wrote in a report two days ago. These
so-called defensive stocks are likely to do better in the next
few months than shares of cyclical companies, which may suffer
the most as a U.S. expansion slows, the report said.  The CHART OF THE DAY shows the performance of cyclical
stocks versus defensives, based on indexes compiled by Morgan
Stanley, tends to track the  Institute for Supply Management ’s
manufacturing index. The ISM gauge dropped last month to 50.9,
one point above a reading that would signal a contraction.  Many investors believe a shift away from cyclicals in the
past six months “is merely a speed bump,” Burkly wrote. “We
beg to differ.” He added that the stocks are unlikely to
deliver a second-half rally as they did in the final six months
of last year, when the Morgan Stanley Cyclical Index rose 34
percent.  Burkly recommended that investors tilt their holdings
toward three categories of defensive stocks. He favored the
makers of food, beverages, tobacco and other consumer staples,
along with health-care and telephone companies.  Industrial, raw-material and technology companies are all
worth avoiding, the report said. All three industry groups are
represented in the cyclical index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
