Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index fell the
most in more than 18 months and its volatility index had the
biggest surge on record, as exporters and commodity stocks
tumbled amid a global equity rout triggered by signs the world
economy is weakening.  Li & Fung Ltd. (494) , a supplier of toys and clothes to retailers
including Wal-Mart Stores Inc., tumbled 4 percent, while
 Techtronic Industries Co. (669) , maker of Ryobi power tools and Hoover
vacuum cleaners, sank 7.3 percent.  Esprit Holdings Ltd. (330) , a
clothier that gets most of its revenue from Europe, dropped 7.6
percent.  Cnooc Ltd. (883) , China’s biggest offshore oil producer by
market value, slumped 5.9 percent as crude headed for its
steepest weekly drop in three months.  “The latest weakness in stocks is the product of global
investors coming to the conclusion that global growth is no
longer getting incrementally better and may even get worse,”
said  Angus Gluskie , who manages about $350 million at White
Funds Management in Sydney. “The moves this week reflect the
mental capitulation of investors from hope to pessimism, and
each day’s fall is only reinforcing the negative outlook.”  The  Hang Seng Index (HSI)  dropped 4.3 percent to 20,946.14 at the
close, its biggest decline since November 2009. All 46 stocks on
the measure fell. The gauge slid 6.7 percent for the week, which
is the steepest drop since the period ended March 6, 2009. The
Hang Seng China Enterprises Index of Chinese companies’ H shares
sank 3.9 percent to 11,434.59.  Futures on the Hang Seng Index dropped 4.4 percent to
20,741.  Volatility Surges  The HSI Volatility Index, the benchmark gauge for Hong Kong
stock options, jumped 56 percent to 33.87, the most since data
began on the measure in 2001. The reading indicates options
traders expect a swing of 9.7 percent in the Hang Seng Index in
the next 30 days.
high.  “A lot of investors now are using options and derivatives
to protect their downside,” said Cedric Ma, senior investment
strategist at Convoy Asset Management Ltd., which oversees the
equivalent of about $260 million in Hong Kong. “The U.S. has
cut spending, Europe is under an austerity policy and China has
been softening in the last few months, so where is the economic
growth going to come from? That’s the big question mark for
investors.”  U.S. options prices soared the most in four years as
investors scrambled to buy protection against greater stock-
market losses.  Exporters Slide  Li & Fung sank 4 percent to HK$12.04. Techtronic fell 7.3
percent to HK$7.83, and  Yue Yuen Industrial Holdings Ltd. (551) , which
makes shoes for Nike Inc., declined 4.8 percent to HK$23.60.  Esprit tumbled 7.6 percent to HK$19.68.  HSBC Holdings Plc (HSBA) ,
Europe’s biggest lender by market value, slid 4.5 percent to
HK$72.70, the largest drag on the Hang Seng Index.  Hutchison Whampoa Ltd. (13) , a developer and port operator that
gets more than half of its revenue from Europe, tumbled 8.3
percent to HK$82.90. The company said first-half profit
increased to HK$46.3 billion ($5.93 billion) from HK$6.3 billion
a year earlier, missing the HK$51 billion median estimate of
five analysts’ estimates in a Bloomberg News survey.  Cosco Pacific Ltd. (1199) , a shipping-container terminal operator
that is part of China’s largest shipping group, tumbled 8.1
percent to HK$10.22.  China  Merchants Holdings International Co.,
an investor in ports handling almost a third of China’s
containers, plunged 6.8 percent to HK$24.05. China Shipping
Development Co., which operates oil and coal shipments, tumbled
6 percent to HK$5.05.  ‘Down-grading Soon’  “The main reason behind the slump in the port sector is
investors’ concern over the U.S. spending and economic
outlook,” said Lawrence Li, a Shanghai-based analyst with UOB-
Kay Hian Holdings Ltd. “There will be a large-scale down-
grading of the sector soon.”  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index fell 0.4 percent
today. In  New York  yesterday, the  S&P 500  tumbled 4.8 percent to
an eight-month low of 1,200.07, erasing its 2011 gain. The Stoxx
 Europe  600 Index sank 3.5 percent to 243.16 in  London  yesterday,
the biggest decline since May 2010.  European Central Bank President  Jean-Claude Trichet  said
policy makers will offer banks in the region additional cash to
ease tensions in financial markets.  Trichet indicated the ECB is reluctant to shelve further
rate increases even as investors reduce bets on the central bank

“particularly high” level of uncertainty, rates are still
“accommodative” and inflation risks “remain on the upside,”
he said.  Energy, Materials  Cnooc slid 5.9 percent to HK$15.54. PetroChina Co.,  Asia ’s
biggest company by market value, declined 3.2 percent to
HK$10.36. Jiangxi Copper Co., China’s No. 1 producer of the
metal by market value, lost 5.7 percent to HK$24.85. Glencore
International Plc, the world’s largest listed commodity trader,
tumbled 8.9 percent to HK$51.40.  Crude oil for September delivery sank to the lowest level
in five months in New York yesterday, falling 5.8 percent to
settle at $86.63 a barrel. The fuel extended declines today. The
London Metal Exchange Index of prices for six industrial metals
including copper and aluminum lost 1.9 percent.  The Hang Seng Index slid 0.5 percent yesterday, and had
declined more than 10 percent from its April 8 high. The drop is
a level that some analysts describe as a correction. Shares on
the index trade at about 11.2 times forecast earnings, the
lowest level since March 2009.  The last time the  Hong Kong ’s benchmark index fell more
than today’s decline was on Nov. 27, 2009, when it tumbled 4.8
percent amid concern Dubai would fail to repay its debt.  To contact the reporters on this story:
