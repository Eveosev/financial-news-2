Reinstating a metal standard that
underpins the global monetary system is the only way to exit the
financial-markets crisis, Marine Le Pen, head of  France ’s
extreme-right National Front party, said in an interview on
radio broadcaster Europe 1 today. Le Pen would get about 20
percent of French votes in the first round of a presidential
election, according to an Ifop poll published last month.  “Indisputably, it’s the end of the international monetary
system that was the outcome of  Bretton Woods . To us it seems
that the restoration of a metallic standard, gold, silver or
platinum, in the international monetary system is the only
solution capable of absorbing the world debts.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
