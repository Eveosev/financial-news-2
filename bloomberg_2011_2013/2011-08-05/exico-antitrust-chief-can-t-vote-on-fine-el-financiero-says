A Mexican judge rejected a legal
challenge from the nation’s antitrust chief that would have
allowed him to vote on the appeal of a $1 billion fine against
America Movil SAB, El Financiero newspaper  reported .  Eduardo  Perez Motta , head of the Mexican Federal
Competition Commission, sought to reverse a decision by his
fellow antitrust commissioners recusing him from voting on the
fine for anticompetitive practices against the largest wireless
provider in  Latin America .  A Mexico City court said Perez Motta’s challenge was
“inadmissible” El Financiero reported, citing a court document.  Some commissioners from the antitrust agency voted to bar
Perez Motta from voting on America Movil’s appeal of the fine,
saying he had shown bias on the matter in radio and TV
interviews in May.  Axtel SAB, Mexico’s second largest fixed-line provider, and
Megacable Holdings SAB, the nation’s largest cable provider,
also challenged the exclusion of Perez Motta from voting on
America Movil’s fine, El Financiero reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
