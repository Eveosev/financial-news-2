Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab, the man
accused of the 2009 Christmas day attempt to blow up a Northwest
Airlines plane with explosives hidden in his underpants, asked
to have his trial moved out of the state of  Michigan .  Abdulmutallab, 24, said in a filing yesterday in federal
court in Detroit that there has been an extensive amount of
pretrial publicity, including coverage of all pretrial hearings,
in local media that has created hostility toward him in Michigan
and preconceived notions of guilt.  He faces eight criminal counts, including conspiracy to
commit an act of terrorism, attempted murder and attempted use
of a weapon of mass destruction. The indictment also says he has
ties to the al-Qaeda terrorist network. He has pleaded not
guilty and faces a possible life sentence if convicted.  Northwest Airlines Flight 253, carrying 279 passengers and
11 crew, originated in Amsterdam and was approaching  Detroit 
Dec. 25, 2009, when Abdulmutallab tried to detonate the
explosives, according to prosecutors. He set fire to his clothes
and a wall before passengers subdued him, prosecutors said.  Assistant U.S. Attorney Michael Martin in Detroit didn’t
immediately return a call to his office after regular business
hours yesterday.  The case is U.S. v. Abdulmutallab, 10-cr-20005, U.S.
District Court, Eastern District of Michigan (Detroit).  To contact the reporter on this story:
