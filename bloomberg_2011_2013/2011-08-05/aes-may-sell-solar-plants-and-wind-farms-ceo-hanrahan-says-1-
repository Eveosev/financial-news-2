AES Corp. (AES) , the U.S. power utility
with operations in 28 countries, may sell solar plants and wind
farms, Chief Executive Officer Paul Hanrahan said.  AES is looking at options for its wind and solar units,
Hanrahan said today during a conference call with investors.  “If there is strong interest and we can get good value for
those businesses, we take a look at that,” Hanrahan said. AES
would use sale proceeds to fund other operations, which include
wholesale power-generation sales and regulated utilities.  AES’s wind unit operates more than 1,700 megawatts of
generating capacity in the United States, China and Europe,
according to the company’s website.  The company has 262 megawatts of wind-power projects
scheduled to be online by the end of this year in the U.S.,
 Europe , China and India, Hanrahan said today.  AES Solar, a joint venture between AES and New York-based
Riverstone Holdings LLC, owns more than 100 megawatts of solar
in Spain, France, Greece and Italy, according to the company’s
website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
