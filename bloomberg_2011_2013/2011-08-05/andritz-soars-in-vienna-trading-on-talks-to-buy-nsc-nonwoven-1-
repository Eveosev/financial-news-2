Andritz AG (ANDR)  rose the most in eight
months after  NSC Groupe (NSGP)  said it’s in exclusive talks to sell its
NSC Nonwovens business to the Austrian maker of machines used in
the paper and metals industries.  Andritz climbed as much as 5.7 percent to 61.21 euros, the
biggest intraday increase since Dec. 2, and was up 3 percent at
4:34 p.m. in Vienna.  The unit consists of the companies Asselin-Thibeau, based
in Elbeuf, France, and Wuxi NSC, based in China, and makes
equipment used in the production of non-woven fabrics, the
manufacturer of machinery said in a  statement  on the Les Echos
website today.  In 2010 NSC Nonwovens was responsible for 41 percent of its
parent’s 78.8 million-euro ($112 million) turnover, according to
NSC’s  website .  Michael Buchbauer, a spokesman for Graz, Austria-based
Andritz, didn’t immediately answer e-mails seeking comment.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
