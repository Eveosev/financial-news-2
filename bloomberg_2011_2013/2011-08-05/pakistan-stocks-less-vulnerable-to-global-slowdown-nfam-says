Amjad Waheed, who oversees the
equivalent of $220 million in Pakistani stocks and bonds at
National Fullerton Asset Management Ltd. in Karachi, comments on
the outlook for Pakistani equities after concerns the world
economy is weakening prompted a rout that drove the Standard &
Poor’s 500 Index to its worst slump since February 2009. Waheed
spoke in a phone interview.  The Karachi Stock Exchange 100 index fell 2.7 percent to
11,528.40 at 10:09 a.m. local time.  On the share-market impact:  “I do not see any big negative impact on the Pakistani
market from global economic concerns. There is less linkage to
global business, and shares here are offering attractive price-
to-earnings ratios.”  On the impact on overseas investors:  “It’s a blessing in disguise. There’s not much foreign
investment in this market. It’s almost nothing compared with
investments of foreign funds in other regional markets. That
makes it less vulnerable to a fast pullout.”  On intraday decline in shares:  “The market is expected to perform well in line with
corporate earnings, which remained positive despite difficult
economic conditions.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
