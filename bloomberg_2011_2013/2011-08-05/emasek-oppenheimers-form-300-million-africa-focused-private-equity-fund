E. Oppenheimer & Son, the investment
holding company of the Oppenheimer family, and Temasek Holdings
Pte’s Sennett Investments Ltd. unit will each invest $150
million in a new Africa-focused private equity joint venture.  The venture, Tana Africa Capital, will primarily invest in
African consumer and agricultural businesses, the companies said
today in a statement. Tana may also invest in the media, health-
care and education industries, it said.  The size of investments is expected to range from $40
million to $50 million, E. Oppenheimer & Son Group Managing
Director James Teeger said in a telephone interview from
Johannesburg. “We have the ability to raise further capital if
a great opportunity comes along,” he said.  The venture already has a “well-developed” deal pipeline,
Teeger said. “We are targeting the entire African continent.
Clearly our focus will be more on the larger economies, but we
are opportunistic in respect of the smaller ones,” he said.  Temasek is  Singapore ’s state-owned investment company. The
Oppenheimer family founded  Anglo American Plc (AAL)  and is a
shareholder in  De Beers , the world’s largest diamond producer.  To contact the reporter on this story:
