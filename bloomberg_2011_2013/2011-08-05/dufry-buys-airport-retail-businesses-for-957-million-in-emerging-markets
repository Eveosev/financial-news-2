Dufry AG, the operator of Hudson News
stores in airports, said it bought four companies for a combined
$957 million to add outlets in emerging markets.  The businesses are Interbaires, an airport retailer in
 Argentina ; airport-retail operations in  Uruguay ,  Ecuador ,
 Armenia  and Martinique; and a wholesale platform, Dufry said in
a statement today. The purchases will boost earnings per share
starting in 2012 and generate savings of $25 million in the next
12 months, Dufry said.  The acquisitions add 21 shops in 10 airports with retail
space of about 13,500 square meters (145,800 square feet) to
Dufry’s assets, the Basel, Switzerland-based company said.  The retailer said it’s financing the purchases through
debt, including a $1 billion five-year syndicated loan
underwritten by  Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria SA (BBVA) ,  BNP Paribas (BNP) 
SA, Credit Agricole CIB,  ING Groep NV (INGA) , Raiffeisen Bank
International,  Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc (RBS) ,  Banco Santander
SA (SAN) , UniCredit and WestLB AG. Credit lines have almost doubled to
1.8 billion Swiss francs ($2.3 billion).  Dufry fell as much as 5.2 percent to 77.60 francs and was
down 2.5 percent as of 12:24 p.m. in Zurich trading.
 Switzerland ’s benchmark SMI Index declined 2.6 percent.  The Swiss retailer plus the four acquired businesses had
combined revenue of 3 billion francs in 2010 and earnings before
interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization of about 430
million francs, Dufry said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
