The FTSE/JSE Africa All Share Index

percent, to 29,256.75 by the 5 p.m. close in Johannesburg. The
index has dropped 6.3 percent this week, its biggest five-day
decline since May 2010.  The following were among the most active stocks in the
South African market today.  Anglo American Plc (AAL)  , the diversified mining company
that makes up 10 percent of the benchmark  stock index , closed at
its lowest since Oct. 4, dropping 6.81 rand, or 2.3 percent, to
288.60 rand. Copper futures fell in  New York , heading for the
biggest weekly slump since June 2010, on concern that the
faltering global economy will curb demand for industrial metals.  BHP Billiton Ltd. (BHP)  , the world’s biggest mining
group, fell for a tenth day, its longest losing streak since it
was formed in 1997, declining 5.17 rand, or 2.3 percent, to
222.95 rand.  Bell Equipment Ltd. (BEL)  , a manufacturer of handling
machinery, rose for the first day in five, gaining 5 cents, or
0.4 percent, to 13.75 rand. The group said earnings per share
for the six months to June 30 would be about 109 cents, from 9
cents in the same period a year earlier.  Exxaro Resources Ltd. (EXX)  , the coal miner that exports
about 38 percent of its production outside of  South Africa , fell
to its lowest in six weeks, declining 6.90 rand, or 4 percent,

coast, shipped 4.36 million metric tons of the fuel in July, 27
percent less than a year earlier, RBCT said today.  Old Mutual Plc (OML)  , South Africa’s largest insurer and
the third-biggest insurer in the U.K., closed at its lowest in
more than a year, declining 32 cents, or 2.5 percent, to 12.67
rand. The group said the planned initial public offering of its
U.S. asset management business is unlikely to happen by the end
of 2012 because of concern that the U.S. recovery is faltering.  Petmin Ltd. (PET)  , South Africa’s largest anthracite
coal miner, rose for the first time in eight days, gaining 3
cents, or 1 percent, to 2.80 rand. The company said it has

fuel from coal, closed at its weakest since Oct. 1, declining
