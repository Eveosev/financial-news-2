Canada  added jobs for the fourth
straight monthly in July as gains in construction and
transportation offset losses in government employment and
education, while the  unemployment rate  fell to the lowest since
2008 on a shrinking labor force.  Employment rose by 7,100 on a seasonally adjusted basis,
Statistics Canada said today in Ottawa, less than the 15,000
median estimate in a Bloomberg News survey of 27 economists. The
jobless rate fell to 7.2 percent from 7.4 percent in June, while
economists had forecast the jobless rate would be unchanged.  The employment report shows the economy continued to create
jobs even as the recovery faded, though slowing wage growth
suggests the labor market is softening. Wage growth decelerated
in July to its slowest since 2003, the statistics agency said.  “The real concern is the ongoing reduction in the wage
growth,” said  Derek Holt , vice-president economics with  Scotia
Capital  in Toronto. “It remains bearish for consumption going
forward.”  Canada’s job market has recovered from the global recession
faster than other Group of Seven countries, as the economy
benefited from rising prices for commodities and a buoyant real
estate market propelled by low borrowing costs.  Canada has added about 25,000 jobs on average each month
since August 2009.  Canadian Dollar Falls  The Canadian dollar fell after the report. It was trading
at 98.22 cents per  U.S. dollar  at 7:29 a.m. in New York,
compared with 98.15 cents late yesterday.  Canada’s gross domestic product fell by 0.3 percent in May,
the most in two years, due to temporary disruptions in the
mining and oil and gas industries,  Statistics Canada  said July
29.  The  Bank of Canada  said July 20 the economy’s growth
probably slowed to a 1.5 percent annual pace in the second
quarter, the slowest rate since the country emerged from
recession in 2009, amid a weak global recovery. Governor Mark Carney has kept the central bank’s benchmark policy rate at 1
percent since September.  Average hourly wages rose 1.4 percent in July from a year
ago, down from 2 percent in the previous month, to reach the
slowest annual pace since June 2003, Statistics Canada said.  Transportation Rises  The economy created 94,500 private sector jobs during the
month, led by a gain of 30,800 in construction employment.
Retail and wholesale increased by 27,500 jobs, while
transportation and warehousing businesses added 27,700 workers.  Canadian National Railway, the country’s biggest railroad
based on sales, said July 25 it added 1,188 employees over the
12 months through June, a 5.4 percent increase.  Public-sector employment declined by 71,500 in the month
and the number of self-employed workers dropped by 15,900, the
agency said.  Schools fired 30,000 employees in July. The statistics
agency said that while there have been similar drops in summer
educational employment in recent years, it doesn’t have enough
data to determine whether the swings need to be adjusted for
seasonality.  Full-time employment rose by 25,500 during July while part-
time jobs dropped by 18,400, the report said.  The U.S. Labor Department will release employment data for
July at 8:30 a.m.  New York  time. The U.S. jobless rate is
forecast to remain unchanged at 9.2 percent, the median of 84
forecasts in a Bloomberg survey.  To contact the reporter on this story:
