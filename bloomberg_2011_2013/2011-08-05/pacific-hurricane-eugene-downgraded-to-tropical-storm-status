Pacific Hurricane Eugene was
downgraded to a tropical storm after its top winds fell to 65
miles (104 kilometers) per hour, according to the  National
Hurricane Center .  Eugene is expected to keep moving west-northwest and break
up over the weekend, according to an advisory issued just before
8 a.m.  Los Angeles  time. It was 935 miles west-southwest of the
southern tip of  Baja California . At its height, Eugene, never a
threat to land, was a Category 4 hurricane with winds of 140
mph.  “Eugene is expected to weaken quickly as the cyclone
traverses colder water,” the hurricane center said.  In the  Atlantic , the remnants of Tropical Storm Emily have
a 60 percent chance of reforming. The bulk of the system is over
Cuba and  Haiti .  To contact the reporter on this story:
