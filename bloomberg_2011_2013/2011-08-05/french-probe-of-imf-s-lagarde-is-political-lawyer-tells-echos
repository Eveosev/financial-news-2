A French investigation into whether
International Monetary Fund Managing Director  Christine Lagarde 
mishandled a dispute involving a supporter of President Nicolas
Sarkozy when she served as the country’s finance minister is
politically motivated, her lawyer Yves Repiquet said.  Public prosecutor “Jean-Louis Nadal didn’t act on his own
initiative but after referral from the opposition for political
reasons,” Repiquet said in an interview published by French
business daily  Les Echos .  Repiquet also said he was “surprised” that the Cour de
Justice de la Republique, which backed the prosecutor’s call for
a probe, said it would be investigating allegations of aiding
and abetting fraud and embezzlement, according to the newspaper.  To contact the reporter on this story:
