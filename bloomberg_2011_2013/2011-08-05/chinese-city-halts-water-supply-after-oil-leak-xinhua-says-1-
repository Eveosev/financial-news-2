The Chinese city of Yiyang in
southern  Hunan province  halted tap-water supply today after a
boat leaked oil into a river, the official  Xinhua News Agency 
said, citing the local Communist Party committee.  A boat transporting fuel spilled oil into the Zijiang river,
Xinhua reported, without stating the extent of the contamination.
Cleanup work is ongoing and the cause of the leak is under
investigation, Xinhua said.  --Winnie Zhu. Editor: Ryan Woo.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
