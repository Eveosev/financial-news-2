Spanish industrial production dropped
in June after stalling in the previous month as the economy
struggled to emerge from a three-year slump.  Output at factories, refineries and mines fell 2 percent
from a year earlier, adjusted for the number of working days,
the National Statistics Institute in  Madrid  said today in an e-
mailed statement. Non-seasonally adjusted production declined
2.7 percent from a year earlier.  Spain ’s government forecasts the economy will grow 1.3
percent this year as exports offset the impact of a 21 percent
unemployment rate and austerity measures on domestic demand. The
government has cut public wages, frozen pensions and axed
benefits to reduce the euro region’s third-largest budget gap by
half in two years.  To contact the reporter on this story:
