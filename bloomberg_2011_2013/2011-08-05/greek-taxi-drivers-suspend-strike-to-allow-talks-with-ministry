Greek taxi drivers will suspend an
almost three-week long strike held over government plans to ease
regulation of the industry so they can negotiate a settlement of
the dispute with the country’s transport ministry.  The strike will be suspended until Sept. 5, according to a
statement posted on the website of the  Association of Attica
Taxi Drivers . “We will continue talks and we hope that by then
we will have proposals from the ministry,” the body said.  The taxi owners are opposing attempts by the government to
make it easier to obtain taxi licences and lift restrictions on
the number available. The changes are part of a push to
liberalize dozens of professions in  Greece , one of the
conditions for last year’s 110 billion-euro ($155 billion)
European Union-led bailout.  The strike has been continuing since July 18, leaving
citizens and tourists stranded at the height of the summer
season. Drivers have blocked access to highways, airports and
ports and occupied toll booths and tourist sites, allowing
people to pass through without paying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
