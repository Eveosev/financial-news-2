Goldman Sachs Group Inc. said today
it saw a one-in-three chance of a renewed recession in the U.S.
within the next nine months as it cut its growth forecast to 2
percent through the first quarter of 2012, chief economist Jan Hatzius wrote in a note to clients.  Goldman now sees growth averaging 1.7 percent this year,
from a prior 1.8 percent forecast, Hatzius said. The world’s
largest economy will expand 2.1 percent in 2012, down from a
previous estimate of 3 percent, he wrote.  The U.S.  unemployment rate  will rise to 9.25 percent by the
end of 2012, reflecting the weaker pace of growth, Hatzius said.
A worsening of the European debt crisis, failure to extend the
U.S. payroll-tax cut beyond 2011 and further increases in
unemployment were cited as key risks to the outlook.  “Even our new forecast is subject to meaningful downside-
risk,” Hatzius wrote. “Increases in the U.S. unemployment rate
have historically had a tendency to feed on themselves, and this
could happen again.”  Goldman expects the  Federal Reserve  will “provide more
guidance” about the future size of its balance sheet at next
week’s policy meeting, Hatzius wrote. Goldman anticipates “no
rate hikes or changes in the size of the Fed’s balance sheet
until 2013 or later,” he wrote.  The unemployment rate fell to 9.1 percent in July from 9.2
percent in June, the Labor Department reported today. Payrolls
rose by a more-than-forecast 117,000 after a 46,000 increase in
June, the report said.  The economy grew at a 1.3 percent pace in the second
quarter following revised growth of 0.4 percent in the first
three months of the year that was less than previously
estimated, the Commerce Department reported last week.  Consumer
spending  rose 0.1 percent, the smallest gain since the second
quarter of 2009, when the recent recession ended.
