Zambia  will probably “soon” mine as
much as 5 million tons of  iron ore  a year,  Radio Phoenix 
reported, citing Situmbeko Musokotwane, the former finance
minister.  Musokotwane, who was finance minister in the country’s
cabinet that was dissolved last week ahead of elections to be
held on Sept. 20, didn’t give more details, the Lusaka-based
broadcaster reported. Musokotwane didn’t answer calls made to
his mobile phone seeking comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
