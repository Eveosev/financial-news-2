South Africa  plans to rely on wind
and solar power to meet its renewable energy targets, Business
Day reported, citing documents inviting bids from companies to
supply power to the country.  Of the 3,725 megawatts South Africa wants to source from
renewable energy it expects 1,850 megawatts to come from wind
power, 1,450 megawatts from photovoltaic solar plants and 200
megawatts from concentrated solar plants, Business Day reported,
citing the documents. The country also expects to get 75
megawatts from small hydropower plants, 25 megawatts from
landfill gas and 12.5 megawatts each from biomass and biogas.  In addition the government has allocated another 100
megawatts for small-scale projects, generating less than 5
megawatts each, using the technnologies, the Johannesburg-based
newspaper said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
