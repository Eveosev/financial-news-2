Ruth Porat,  Morgan Stanley (MS) ’s chief
financial officer, and Paul J. Taubman, co-head of the firm’s
investment bank, bought a total of $1.53 million of the bank’s
shares as Chief Executive Officer  James Gorman  purchased $2.06
million.  Taubman bought 50,000 shares yesterday at a weighted-
average price of $20.3847, worth $1.02 million, according to a
filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission today.
Porat purchased 25,000 shares at $20.50, worth $512,500,
according to a separate filing.  Morgan Stanley rose 1.6 percent today, the second-largest
gain in the 81-company Standard & Poor’s 500 Financials Index,
after earlier touching the lowest price since March 2009. The
shares have fallen 26 percent this year. The bank’s puts were
the most active in the U.S. equity-options market on Aug. 3
after an investor bought a block of contracts with a strike
price 25 percent below the previous day’s closing level.  Taubman, 50, who has worked at the New York-based firm for
almost 30 years, now owns 1.15 million shares, worth $23 million
at today’s closing price. Porat, 53, owns 695,667 shares, worth
$13.9 million. Board member Hutham Olayan purchased 5,000 shares
at $20, worth $100,000, according to a filing today.  Morgan Stanley rose 32 cents to $20.02 at 4:15 p.m. in New
York Stock Exchange composite trading. It was the largest
increase in more than two weeks and made the firm one of only 10
companies in the  S&P 500 Financials Index (S5FINL)  to climb.  Gorman’s Purchase  Gorman, 53, bought 100,000 shares yesterday at a weighted
average price of $20.62, according to a filing yesterday. The
purchase, which was larger than his cash bonus for 2010,
increased Gorman’s holdings to 955,370 shares, worth about $18.8
million at yesterday’s closing price. It was Gorman’s first
outright purchase since he became CEO last year.  The stock jumped 11 percent on July 21 after Morgan Stanley
reported a smaller loss than analysts estimated on higher
trading revenue. It has dropped 19 percent since then, as
financial companies in the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index retreated
amid concern the U.S. recovery is weakening and the European
sovereign-debt crisis will spread.  To contact the reporter on this story:
