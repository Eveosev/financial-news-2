Blackstone Group LP (BX)  and KKR & Co.
both had their worst one-day declines in more than a year
yesterday on concern that a falling stock market will hinder the
buyout firms’ ability to sell companies.  The number of initial public offerings worldwide jumped 23
percent in the first half to 901 deals, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg, and the stronger market enabled private-
equity firms to sell companies at a profit, increasing
distributions to investors and bolstering their own fees.  That start may be at risk if equity markets keep
struggling. Blackstone, the world’s biggest buyout firm, fell 11
percent in yesterday’s  New York  trading, more than twice the
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index’s 4.8 percent decline in a global
equity-market rout. Apollo Global Management LLC, which began
trading on March 30, suffered its worst day and closed at its
lowest price.  “You’re not immune in private equity if valuations come
down and the IPO market is soft,” said Paul Schaye, managing
partner of New York-based Chestnut Hill Partners, which helps
private-equity firms identify buyout targets. “They need to
have great exits.”  Market volatility may damp investors’ appetite for highly
leveraged deals, after buyout-backed IPOs had their best start
this year since at least 2006.  $56.5 Billion Exits  Private equity-backed companies have raised about $56.5
billion from 118 IPOs and private placements worldwide this
year, 45 percent more in value than the total from 159 such
exits during all of 2010, according to data compiled by London-
based research firm Preqin Ltd. HCA Holdings Inc.,  Kinder Morgan 
Inc. and Nielsen Holdings NV combined raised more than $8.5
billion, Preqin’s data show.  GNC Holdings Inc., backed by Ares Management LLC and
 Ontario Teachers’ Pension Plan , gained 49 percent from its March
31 IPO through yesterday. HCA Holdings, the hospital chain
partly owned by KKR and Bain Capital LLC, raised $4.4 billion in
March in the biggest-ever private equity-backed U.S. IPO,
according to Preqin. The company declined 24 percent from its
debut through yesterday.  Firms have a long list of companies they’re trying to sell
profitably. A record $1.6 trillion in leveraged buyouts were
completed from 2005 to 2007, according to Preqin.  “There are dark clouds gathering over the market for
private-equity IPOs,” Josef Schuster, founder of Chicago-based
IPOX Schuster LLC, which invests in IPOs and oversees about $2.5
billion, said in telephone interview.  ‘Much More Selective’  “Investors are going to be much more selective with the
private-equity IPOs they choose to invest in and it will be
harder for the firms to exit at rich valuations,” Schuster
said. “Macro risk has increased and individual deals, such as
HCA, have sharply disappointed.”  A  bear market  would be another setback for private-equity
firms that endured a near-halt in exits and deal-making for more
than two years after the global financial crisis triggered in
part by the 2008 collapse of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc.  Some IPOs already done this year have rewarded firms and
investors.  Kinder Morgan, the energy-pipeline company whose owners
include  Carlyle Group , raised $3.3 billion in its February IPO.
Dunkin’ Brands Group Inc., the coffee and baked goods chain
backed by Bain, Carlyle and Thomas H. Lee Partners LP, surged 47
percent in its July 27 trading debut after raising $486 million.
Nielsen Holdings, the media research company owned by
Blackstone, KKR, Carlyle and  Thomas H. Lee Partners , increased
22 percent from its January IPO through yesterday.  Still, IPOs for companies such as Toys “R” Us Inc., which
filed in May 2010, have yet to be completed.  Exploring Alternatives  Caesars Entertainment Corp., the world’s biggest casino
company, canceled a proposed $500 million IPO in November. Chief
Executive Officer Gary Loveman said in May the company may seek
an alternative equity listing within 18 months.  Apollo and closely held private-equity firm TPG Inc. took
Las Vegas-based Caesars private in January 2008 for $30.7
billion including debt and transaction costs.  Growth outlooks have deteriorated globally as investors
lose confidence amid “political gridlock” and fiscal issues in
the U.S. and  Europe , Michael Novogratz, a principal and co-chief
investment officer of  Fortress Investment Group LLC (FIG) ’s macro
funds, said yesterday on an earnings conference call.  Markets are “waking up to the fact that this is going to
be a long, hard grind out of this deleveraging, it could last
three to four more years,” Novogratz said. “We foresee a very
choppy environment where the broad move is lower in equities
with big short squeezes to the up side, with rates low for a
long period of time and the dollar under continued pressure.”  Extending Losses  Blackstone lost $1.66 to $13.72 in New York Stock Exchange
composite trading yesterday, after a 3.9 percent decline on Aug.
3, and Apollo Global slid $1.80, or 11 percent, to $14.93. KKR
declined as much as 11 percent before closing down 80 cents, or
6 percent, to $12.59, extending a 5.3 percent drop after weaker-
than-expected quarterly earnings.  Fortress, which reported profit short of analysts’
expectations and said it would reinstate a dividend, declined 36
cents, or 8.8 percent, to $3.72.  Brookfield Asset Management
Inc. (BAM/A)  fell $1.47, or 4.9 percent, to $28.65. Brookfield is based
in Toronto and the other four firms in New York.  In a volatile session today, Blackstone fell 12 cents, or
0.9 percent, to $13.60 at 4:15 p.m., after sliding as much as
5.1 percent. Apollo declined 88 cents, or 5.9 percent, to $14.05
after slumping as much as 13 percent. KKR lost 40 cents, or 3.2
percent, to $12.19 after slipping as much as 6.7 percent.
Brookfield dropped 16 cents, or 0.6 percent, to $28.49, and
Fortress was unchanged.  Circuit Breakers  When Blackstone, Apollo and, for a time, KKR dropped more
than 10 percent yesterday, they each triggered a Securities and
Exchange Commission circuit breaker that temporarily stops short
selling. Short-sellers bet on a decline by borrowing shares and
selling them, hoping to buy them back later for less.  For four of the firms, yesterday marked the worst
performance in at least a year, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  Blackstone’s close represented the stock’s biggest one-day
decline since April 20, 2009, and lowest finishing price since
Dec. 20. KKR delivered its biggest drop since joining the NYSE
on July 15, 2010, and lowest closing price since Nov. 30.  Fortress had its steepest one-day decline since May 6,
2010, and lowest closing price since Oct. 4, and Brookfield fell
to its largest single-day drop since June 4, 2010, and lowest
close since Oct. 4.  Correction Territory  The  S&P 500  tumbled 60.27 points to 1,200.07 yesterday, a
12 percent drop from its April 29 peak and weakest level since
Nov. 30. The more than 10 percent decline since April 29 means
the index has entered what is known as a correction. The  Dow
Jones Industrial Average  tumbled 512.76 points, or 4.3 percent,
to 11,383.68. The MSCI World Index of developed markets slid 4.3
percent.  The S&P 500 declined 0.1 percent today to 1,199.38, the Dow
rose 0.5 percent to 11,444.61 and the MSCI World Index dropped
1.2 percent as of 4:30 p.m. New York time.  To contact the reporters on this story:
