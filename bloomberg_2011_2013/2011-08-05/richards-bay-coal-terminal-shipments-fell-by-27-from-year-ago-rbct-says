Richards Bay Coal Terminal,  South
Africa ’s main coal export harbor, shipped 27 percent less of the
fuel in July than a year earlier as a seasonal drop in demand
reduced cargoes.  The terminal shipped 4.36 million metric tons of the 5.68
million tons received during the month, and had stockpiles of
4.23 million tons as of July 31, RBCT said in a  statement 
published on its website today.  South African exporters have experienced three months of
lower seasonal demand from buyers in  China ,  Europe  and India,
Bevan Jones, a broker at London Commodities Brokers, said by
telephone from Johannesburg.  “A lot of deliveries have been rolled over to the fourth
quarter,” when winter starts in the Northern Hemisphere, Jones
said.  Exports to  India , South Africa’s main coal market, were
reduced by a longer-than-expected monsoon, Jones said. “Coal
imports practically come to a standstill during monsoon
season.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
