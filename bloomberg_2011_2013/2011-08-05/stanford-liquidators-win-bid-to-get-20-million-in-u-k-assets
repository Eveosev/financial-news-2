Stanford International Bank’s
liquidators won a bid to gain access to $20 million of assets
frozen in the U.K.  Grant Thornton  LLP, which is liquidating the Antigua-based
bank, will use the money to fund its plan to recover assets for
victims of R. Allen Stanford’s alleged  Ponzi scheme . Judge
Elizabeth Gloster yesterday ordered the release of $20 million,
with $5 million to be made available to Grant Thornton
immediately.  Stanford, 61, faces civil and criminal allegations that he
defrauded investors of more than $7 billion using bogus
certificates of deposit issued by Stanford International Bank.
Stanford denies the claims. His criminal trial was postponed
until January 2012 because of health problems.  About $100 million of Stanford International Bank’s assets
are held in the U.K. in various  hedge funds . The money has been
the subject of a legal battle over access to the funds. The U.K.
Serious Fraud Office wants to hand the assets to the  U.S.
Department of Justice .  Grant Thornton said it will use the money to fund lawsuits
against banks and advisers who worked with Stanford. The
accounting firm also hopes to clawback funds from investors who
profited from the alleged fraud, its lawyers said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
