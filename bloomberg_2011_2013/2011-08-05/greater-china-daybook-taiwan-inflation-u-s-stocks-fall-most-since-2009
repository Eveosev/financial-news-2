Taiwan’s consumer price inflation
probably slowed to 1.90 percent in July from 1.93 percent the
previous month, according to the median estimate from 19
economists surveyed by Bloomberg News.  U.S. stocks plunged in trading yesterday, driving the
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index to the biggest decline since
February 2009, as concern the global economy is weakening
prompted a global rout. Only three of the 500 stocks in the
benchmark measure of American equities rose.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
