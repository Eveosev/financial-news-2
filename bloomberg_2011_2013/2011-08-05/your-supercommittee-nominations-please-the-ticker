We know lots of things about the congressional supercommittee created by the debt-limit compromise: It will have six members from each party; it will come up with $1.5 trillion in additional deficit reductions; its recommendations will be given fast-track privilege in the House and Senate; it absolutely  cannot  raise taxes, unless, of course, it totally  can ; it gets to order Chinese any night it works past midnight. (OK, we made that one up.) What we don't know, however, is the most critical fact: Who will be on it? The congressional leadership --  John Boehner  and  Nancy Pelosi  in the House,  Harry Reid  and Mitch McConnell in the Senate -- has until Aug. 16 to complete its fantasy draft, and the field is wide open (with a notable  exception  hailing from  Texas 's 14th District). As a public service, the Ticker has done a somewhat exhaustive  Google search  and come up with a thoroughly unscientific list of candidates proposed most frequently in news articles, opinion pieces, blog posts and the like. The sample size is small, but we suspect the results give a pretty accurate picture of who will be the lead dogs on this fiscal Iditarod.
