ReneSola Ltd. (SOLA)  has begun producing its
own steel wire for slicing solar wafers and expects to handle
8,400 metric tons a year of output by the end of 2011, the
Chinese company said today in a statement. The company expects
significant savings compared with buying the wire from outside
suppliers, it said.Â ReneSola also said it has developed a new
generation of G6 casting furnaces with a capacity of 650
kilograms and annual output of 8 megawatts, compared with about
6 megawatts for its curent ovens.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
