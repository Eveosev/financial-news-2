Further enlargement of the European
Union’s bailout funds “isn’t a solution” to the bloc’s debt
crisis, Slovak Finance Minister Ivan Miklos said.  While Slovakia supports plans to increase the effective
lending capacity of the European Financial Stability Facility, a
temporary bailout fund created last year, it rejects boosting
the amount available beyond the current 440 billion euros ($623
billion,) he said in an e-mailed statement from the capital,
Bratislava. Slovakia adopted the euro in 2009.  European Commission President Jose Barroso yesterday urged
euro region leaders to review “all elements” of their response
to the crisis, including the size of the EFSF and the 500
billion-euro European Stability Mechanism that will replace it.  Governments should focus on implementing policies adopted
at a July 21 summit of euro-area leaders, which “give hope”
contagion can be stopped, Miklos said. Those plans include
expanding the powers of the bailout funds to let them provide
credit lines to distressed countries and buy their bonds.  To contact the reporter on this story:
