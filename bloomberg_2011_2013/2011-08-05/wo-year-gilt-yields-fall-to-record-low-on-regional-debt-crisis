U.K. two-year notes rose, pushing the
yield to a record low, and sterling strengthened as investors
sought British assets amid concern the euro area’s debt crisis
is deepening.  The 10-year gilt’s yield also touched an all-time low,
though the security snapped seven days of gains after U.S. data
showed better-than-expected job growth. The pound was set for a
second consecutive weekly gain against the euro, after European
Central Bank President  Jean-Claude Trichet  said yesterday the
ECB will offer banks as much money as they need for six months.
The pound strengthened versus all 16 of its major counterparts
tracked by Bloomberg.  “Gilts find themselves in a fortunate situation,” said
Eric Wand, a fixed-income strategist at Lloyds Bank Corporate
Markets in London. “They’re seeing the benefit of
diversification flows away from  Europe  and safe-haven demand,
driving yields to record lows.”  The two-year gilt yield dropped three basis points to 0.57
percent as of 4:39 p.m. in London, down six basis points from
July 29. It reached a record low 0.51 percent. The 4.5 percent
security due March 2013 traded at 106.175. The yield on the 10-
year gilt rose three basis points to 2.71 percent after dropping
as low as 2.59 percent. It’s still 15 basis points lower from
the end of last week.  The 30-year gilt yield dropped to within two basis points
of an almost 12-month low, reaching 3.79 percent.  Inflation Data  Two-year gilts pared their advance as a report showed U.K.
producer prices rose in July, pushing the annual rate to the
fastest since October 2008.  The cost of goods at factory gates increased 0.2 percent on
the month and 5.9 percent on the year, the  Office for National
Statistics  said today in London. The monthly gain matched the
median forecast of 18 economists in a Bloomberg News survey,
while the annual change exceeded a 5.8 percent estimate. Input
costs jumped the most since April on the month.  U.K. consumer-price inflation was 4.2 percent in June, more
than twice the  Bank of England ’s 2 percent goal. Governor  Mervyn King  has said the price surge is temporary and will ease.  The Bank of England is scheduled to publish its quarterly
inflation report on Aug. 10.  Gilts have handed investors a return of 6.9 percent this
year, compared with 4.6 percent for German bunds and 6.3 percent
for U.S. Treasuries, according to indexes compiled by Bloomberg
and the European Federation of Financial Analysts Societies.  Pound Moves  Sterling strengthened 0.3 percent to 86.46 pence per euro,
its strongest level since May 27. The pound climbed 0.7 percent
to $1.6369, approaching the $1.6476 level reached on Aug. 1, the
most since June 1. It’s down 0.3 percent for the week.  Other data today showed U.K. house prices increased in July
as record-low borrowing costs helped support demand for
residential property. Prices rose 0.3 percent from the previous
month, the mortgage unit of  Lloyds Banking Group Plc (LLOY)  said in a
statement in London today. From a year earlier, prices fell 2.6
percent to an average 163,981 pounds.  The housing market is struggling to gain momentum as
consumers are suffering from high inflation and government
spending cuts. Bank of England policy makers left the benchmark
rate unchanged at 0.5 percent yesterday as the economy grew just
0.2 percent in the second quarter after stalling since
September. The Bank of England kept its bond-purchase program,
known as quantitative easing, on hold at 200 billion pounds.  Sterling has fallen 7.1 percent in the last 12 months,
making it the second-worst performer among 10 developed-market
currencies after the  U.S. dollar , according to Bloomberg
Correlation-Weighted Currency Indexes.  To contact the reporter on this story:
