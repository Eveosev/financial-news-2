Copper futures fell in New York,
capping the biggest weekly slump since June 2010, on concern
that the faltering global economy will curb demand for
industrial metals.  Copper declined for the fifth straight day as a report
showing U.S. employers in July added more jobs than forecast
failed to ease concern that the nation will slip into another
recession. All six base metals traded on the  London  Metal
Exchange dropped, with lead and zinc falling more than 5 percent
and tin had the biggest weekly drop in two years.  “Sentiment has become king, and perceptions of the macro
outlook have taken a turn for the worst,”  Gayle Berry , an
analyst at  Barclays Capital  in London, said in a report. “The
metals were by far the worst affected of the commodity
sectors.”  Copper futures for September delivery slid 11.85 cents, or
2.8 percent, to close at $4.117 a pound at 1:24 p.m. on the
Comex in New York. Earlier, the price reached $4.0795, the
lowest for a most-active contract since June 28. The metal
tumbled 8.1 percent this week.  The  U.S. economy  expanded less than economists estimated in
the second quarter, and first-quarter growth was revised lower,
government figures showed last week. European services and
manufacturing growth eased last month to the slowest pace in
almost two years, a report showed on Aug. 3.  “There is a lot of disappointing macro data coming out of
the U.S.,” Angus Staines, an analyst at UBS AG in London, said
in a telephone interview. “As the market changes its sentiment
toward an expectation for worse data, we’ll continue to see that
being priced into commodities.”  On the London Metal Exchange, copper for delivery in three
months fell $314, or 3.4 percent, to $9,041 a metric ton ($4.10
a pound).  Tin fell $1,155, or 4.5 percent, to $24,350 a ton. Earlier,
the metal touched $23,165, the lowest since Sept. 22. This week,
the price dropped 13 percent, the most since July 2009.  Aluminum dropped $74, or 3 percent, to $2,402 a ton after
reaching $2,400, the lowest since Jan. 27. The metal fell 8.5
percent this week, the most since December 2008.  Nickel, zinc and lead also declined.  To contact the reporters on this story:
