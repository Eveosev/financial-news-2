OAO  Uralkali (URKA) ,  Russia ’s largest
fertilizer maker by market value, will buy back as much as 30
billion rubles ($1.06 billion) of bonds on Aug. 22, it said in a
statement.  The company has sufficient cashflow to repay most of the
bonds after potash prices surged this year, spokesman Alexey
Sotskov said by telephone today. Uralkali sold two-year bonds
with an 8.25 percent coupon in February to help fund the
acquisition of a 20 percent stake in rival Silvinit.  Uralkali hedged its ruble bonds with currency swaps and now
plans to benefit from terminating the arrangement, given the
ruble’s appreciation against the dollar since February, the
statement shows.  To contact the reporter on this story:
