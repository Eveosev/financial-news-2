Arsenal will meet Udinese in the
playoff round of soccer’s  Champions League , while four-time
winner Bayern Munich faces FC Zurich.  The matchups were among 10 determined by today’s draw at
the headquarters of European soccer’s governing body, UEFA, in
Nyon, Switzerland. The winners of the two-match series advance
to the group stage of the region’s elite-team competition.  Arsenal was forced into the playoff after faltering late
last season and finishing fourth in the Premier League. The
Gunners will open the series without manager Arsene Wenger and
midfielder Samir Nasri, who received one-match bans for their
comments following last season’s loss to Barcelona in the round
of 16, as well as striker Robin van Persie, who was shown two
yellow cards in the final match in  Spain .  Udinese finished fourth in Serie A, claiming the spot with
a goalless draw against champion AC Milan in the final game. It
features Antonio Di Natale, the top scorer in Italy the past two
seasons, and sold star forward  Alexis Sanchez  to Barcelona last
month.  Bayern, which lost the 2010 Champions League final to Inter
Milan, was one of two former winners of the competition in the
draw. Two-time champion Benfica was drawn against Dutch runner-
up FC Twente.  The matches will be played Aug. 16-17 and Aug. 23-24. The
first teams listed will play their opening games at home.
