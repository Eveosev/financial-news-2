Bulgaria opened a tender to sell the
remaining 36 percent state stake in  Arsenal AD , a producer of
assault rifles and ammunition, in an effort to attract
investment to the Balkan nation.  The asset-selling body in Sofia will accept bids from
companies involved in weapons production or trade with annual
revenue of at least 40 million lev ($29 million), the agency
said in an e-mail today. The deadline for binding bids is in
four months.  Bulgaria, the European Union’s poorest country, is
recovering from its worst recession in more than a decade and
needs to raise cash to narrow its  budget deficit  and meet
increasing social benefits payments ahead of October
presidential and local elections. The six-month budget gap
narrowed to 0.9 percent of economic output from 2.2 percent a
year ago.  The Kazanlak, Bulgaria-based factory was sold to its
management in 1996. It also produces artillery systems and has
recently developed a device for discovering explosives,
according to its website.  Bulgaria  lifted in March a requirement to keep minority
stakes in defense-industry companies, to boost investment. The
requirement dated from 1998, when the country began selling its
military plants. The state still owns 100 percent of three
defense companies, including the Terem group of maintenance
plants and Sopot-based  Vazovski Mashinostroitelni Zavodi , or
VMZ, the country’s biggest weapons maker, which will also be
sold at a later stage.  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
