U.S. stocks fell the most in 32
months this week, erasing the  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index (SPX) ’s 2011
advance, as investors fled equities amid signs that the economy
is stalling. An early rally faded yesterday as concern grew that
S&P would cut the American  credit rating , speculation which
proved to be true after financial markets closed.  Bank of America Corp.  and Alcoa Inc. tumbled more than 13
percent, leading losses in the Dow Jones Industrial Average.
 Caterpillar Inc. (CAT)  retreated 7.9 percent, while  General Electric
Co. (GE)  sank 7.8 percent. Energy and materials companies in the S&P
500 fell 9.5 percent or more, the most among 10  industries , as
every group declined. Losses exceeded 10 percent for 167 out of
500 companies in the index, and nine rose.  The S&P 500 slumped 7.2 percent to 1,199.38, the biggest
weekly drop since November 2008 and the lowest level since Nov.
30, 2010. The Dow rose 60.93 points yesterday. For the week, it
dropped 698.63 points, or 5.8 percent, to 11,444.61. The
measures erased year-to-date gains that reached 8.4 percent and
11 percent as of April 29, respectively.  “It was disaster,”  Michael Gibbs , Memphis, Tennessee-
based chief equity strategist at Morgan Keegan Inc., said
yesterday in a telephone interview. His firm oversees about $80
billion in client assets. “The weakness in the  U.S. economy 
combined with the lack of confidence in European leadership made
the perfect storm for investors.”  About $1.87 trillion has been erased from the value of U.S.
equities since July 22, including the 4.8 percent plunge by the
S&P 500 on Aug. 4 that was the biggest drop since February 2009.  Seeking Safety  Investors speculated the global economy may contract,
driving them out of stocks and the euro and into havens such as
Treasuries. European Central Bank President Jean-Claude Trichet
tried to stamp out investor concern that the 21-month crisis
will spread to Italy and Spain, the region’s third- and fourth-
largest economies.  Stocks have slumped two straight weeks as reports on
manufacturing and consumer spending showed the world’s largest
economy is slowing. The  S&P 500  fell 0.1 percent yesterday even
after the U.S. Commerce Department said employers added 117,000
jobs last month, topping the median economist projection of
85,000 in a Bloomberg survey. The S&P 500 has retreated 11
percent since July 22, the biggest loss over the same amount of
time since March 2009, when the equity bull market began.  The S&P 500 climbed as much as 1.5 percent in the first
five minutes of trading yesterday before turning lower as
speculation swirled through the market that S&P was preparing to
strip the U.S. of its AAA rating for the first time. S&P cut the
rating one level to AA+ after financial markets closed on Aug.
5, criticizing the nation’s political process and saying
lawmakers failed to cut spending enough to reduce record
deficits.  Cyclicals Slump  The Morgan Stanley Cyclical Index of companies most-tied to
economic growth tumbled 11 percent this week as all 30 of its
stocks retreated. The  Dow (INDU)  Jones Transportation Average of 20
stocks, also considered a proxy for the economy, slumped 9.5
percent. Both gauges fell the most since March 2009.  United Technologies Corp. (UTX) , the maker of Pratt & Whitney jet
engines, retreated the most since October 2008, losing 11
percent to $74.14. Boeing Co., the world’s second-largest maker
of commercial aircraft, slipped 11 percent to $62.75.
Caterpillar, the world’s largest construction and mining-
equipment maker, declined 7.9 percent to $90.99.  While mounting concern U.S. growth is slowing has driven
down stocks,  Wall Street  has never been more sure that the S&P
500 Index will rally in 2011. Chief strategists at 13 banks from
Barclays Plc to UBS AG see the benchmark measure of American
equity surging 17 percent through Dec. 31, the average estimate
in a Bloomberg survey. Their projection that the index will
reach 1,401 hasn’t budged in four weeks.  ‘Reluctant to Overreact’  “I’m reluctant to overreact to some shorter-term weakness,
no matter how real it is, because the market has proven to be
unbelievably resilient,”  Jonathan Golub , the chief U.S. market
strategist at UBS in New York, said in an Aug. 3 phone
interview. He says the S&P 500 will end the year at 1,425.  The U.S. debt-ceiling compromise failed to prevent losses
for equity investors. President  Barack Obama  signed the law on
Aug. 2, avoiding a default on the day the Treasury warned the
nation’s borrowing authority would expire. The agreement ended a
months-long debate that reinforced partisan divisions over
federal spending while deferring decisions on the nation’s
finances to a bipartisan panel.  ‘Kicked the Can’  “We kicked the can down the road with regard to the heavy
lifting on the spending cuts,” Scott Migliori, the San
Francisco-based U.S. chief investment officer at RCM Capital
Management, a unit of Allianz Global Investors, said yesterday
in a telephone interview. RCM oversees more than $145 billion.
“The uncertainty about which sectors of the economy will face
spending cuts remains an overhang, not only on the equity market
but also on corporate America’s decisions on hiring and capital
expenditures.”  The odds of a U.S. downturn are rising amid cutbacks in
spending by consumers and the government, according to five of
the nine members of the panel that dates recessions.  “This economy is really balanced on the edge,” Harvard
University economics professor  Martin Feldstein , a member of the
Business Cycle Dating Committee of the National Bureau of
 Economic Research , said in an interview on Bloomberg
Television’s “Surveillance Midday” with  Tom Keene  on Aug. 2.
“There’s now a 50 percent chance that we could slide into a new
recession. Nothing has given us much growth.”  Commodity Producers  Energy and  raw-material  shares led the declines in the S&P
500, falling 10 percent and 9.5 percent, respectively.  Chevron
Corp. (CVX) , the second-largest U.S. oil company, slid 6.2 percent to
$97.61. Alcoa, the nation’s largest aluminum producer, sank 13
percent to $12.79.  AK Steel Holding Corp. (AKS) , the third-largest U.S. steelmaker
by sales, plunged 25 percent to $9.12, its lowest price since
April 2009. Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold Inc., the world’s
largest publicly traded copper producer, decreased 13 percent to
$45.99 as metal prices declined.  Bank of America, the largest U.S. lender by assets, fell 16
percent to $8.17, the lowest price since April 2009. Matthew Burnell, an analyst at  Wells Fargo & Co ., cut his recommendation
on the bank to “market perform” from “outperform” because of
lower expectations for the American economy.  The  KBW Bank Index (BKX)  of 24 U.S. financial stocks slid 10
percent, and has declined on 10 of the past 11 days, amid
concern Europe’s sovereign debt crisis may spread.  Citigroup
Inc. (C)  dropped 13 percent to $33.44.  MetroPCS Communications Inc. (PCS)  tumbled 41 percent to $9.53
for the biggest retreat in the S&P 500. The mobile-phone carrier
reported earnings that trailed analyst estimates.  Kraft Foods Inc. was the only Dow stock to advance,
climbing 1.4 percent to $34.87. The world’s second-biggest food
company plans to spin off its North American grocery business to
shareholders, splitting the existing company in two.  MasterCard Inc. (MA) , the second-biggest payments network,
gained the most in the S&P 500, rallying 7.7 percent to $326.54
after profit rose 33 percent as customers’ spending increased.  To contact the reporter on this story:
