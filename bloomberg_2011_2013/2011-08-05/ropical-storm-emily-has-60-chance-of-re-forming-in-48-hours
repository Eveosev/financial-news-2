Tropical Storm Emily, which abated
last night as it passed over mountains in the  Dominican
Republic , has a 60 percent chance of re-forming, the U.S.
 National Hurricane Center  said.  The remnants of the storm are “producing a large area of
cloudiness and thunderstorms, extending from eastern Cuba
northeastward across the southern Bahamas,” the center said in
an  advisory  issued before 8 a.m. in Miami.  The system has a 60 percent chance of regenerating into a
tropical cyclone in the next 48 hours as it moves northwest at
15 miles per hour (24 kilometers per hour), it said. Conditions
will become “a little more favorable for development on
Saturday,” it said.  All week, forecasters have said mountains in Haiti and the
Dominican Republic, some of which rise to 10,000 feet, could
tear Emily’s structure apart and break the storm up before it
could re-enter the Atlantic and threaten the Bahamas and
possibly  Florida .  Tropical cyclones draw energy from warm ocean water. As
Emily’s winds interacted with the mountains of Hispaniola, home
to Haiti and the Dominican Republic, dry air was pumped into the
system, said Paul Walker, a meteorologist with  AccuWeather Inc. 
in  State College ,  Pennsylvania , yesterday.  The height of the mountains also disrupts the circular
structure of a storm, which spins counterclockwise in the
Northern Hemisphere, said  Dennis Feltgen , a spokesman for the
hurricane center.  To contact the reporter on this story:
