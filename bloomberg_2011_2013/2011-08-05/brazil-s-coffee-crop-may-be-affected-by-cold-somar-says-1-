Possible frost formation in  Brazil ’s
main coffee-producing regions may affect next year’s crop,
according to Somar Meteorologia.  Temperatures fell below 2 degrees Celsius (35.6 degrees
Fahrenheit) overnight in some growing regions in southern  Minas
Gerais , Sao Paulo and northern Parana, with possible frost
formation, Marco Antonio dos Santos, an agronomist at Somar
Meteorologia, said by phone today. Minas Gerais is Brazil’s
largest arabica coffee-producing state.  “There is a possibility of some damage to the coffee crop
for next year,” Santos said. “It’s too early to evaluate the
extent of the damage.”  Frost in Brazilian growing regions can damage trees bearing
the following year’s crop. Coffee futures soared to a record
$3.375 a pound in 1977 after damage from “black frost” in the
country two years earlier, according to Bloomberg data.  Arabica for September delivery rose 0.6 cent, or 0.3
percent, to $2.3645 a pound by 5:33 p.m. London time on ICE
Futures U.S. in  New York , paring a gain of as much as 5 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
