The Czech Republicâ€™s benchmark equity
index tumbled to its lowest in two years after  Unipetrol AS (UNIP) 
reported a loss for the second quarter and coal-mining company
New World Resources Plc fell with commodities.  The PX gauge of 14 companies retreated 2.5 percent to
1,092.4 at its 4:28 p.m. end of trading in Prague, the lowest
close since August 2009. The index lost 7.1 percent this week,
the most since the five days ended May 7, 2010.  Global stocks and oil plunged and most emerging-market
currencies weakened as report showing the U.S. added more jobs
than expected failed to ease concern the global economy is
struggling.  NWR, the biggest Czech coking-coal producer, slid 8 percent
to 185 koruna, the lowest on record. Unipetrol tumbled  0.9
percent to 170 koruna, the weakest since April 2010. The biggest
Czech oil refiner had a loss of 1 million koruna ($58,610) in
the three-month period, compared with a profit of 520 million
koruna a year earlier, it said late yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
