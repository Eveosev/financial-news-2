U.S. stock index futures retreated,
indicating the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index may extend the
biggest drop since February 2009, amid deepening concerns of a
global economic slowdown.  S&P 500  futures expiring in September lost 0.5 percent to
1,192.5 as of 3:12 p.m. in  Hong Kong  as equity benchmarks in
 Asia  plunged. Dow Jones Industrial Average futures expiring the
same month declined 70 points, or 0.6 percent, to 11,301.  More than $4.4 trillion has been wiped off equity market
values worldwide since July 26, driving the MSCI All-Country
World Index down more than 10 percent from this year’s high and
into a so-called correction. The S&P 500 has fallen eight out of
the past nine days, losing 11 percent since July 7.  To contact the reporter on this story:
