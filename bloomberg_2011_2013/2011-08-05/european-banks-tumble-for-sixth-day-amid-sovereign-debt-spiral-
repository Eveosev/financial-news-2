European banks fell for a sixth day
on concern the deteriorating creditworthiness of countries from
 Italy  to  Spain  will tip the region’s economy into recession.  Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc (RBS)  and  Intesa Sanpaolo SpA (ISP) 
led the 46-member Bloomberg Europe 500 Banks Index down as much
as 3.9 percent to its lowest since April 2009. RBS, Britain’s
biggest government-controlled bank, fell as much as 21 percent
and was 11 percent lower at 26.82 pence as of 8:23 am in  London .
Intesa, Italy’s second-biggest lender, was suspended in Milan
after dropping as much as 7.7 percent.  Banks fell as Italian, Spanish and Belgian bonds opened
lower, driving yields on the securities relative to German bunds
to the most since before the euro was introduced in 1999.
European Central Bank President Jean-Claude Trichet yesterday
offered banks unlimited money for six months and extended
existing liquidity measures to quell concern that southern
European lenders may struggle to borrow in the debt markets.  “Increasingly violent moves in stressed sovereign bonds,
bank equity values and now all traded markets are driving a
self-perpetuating downward spiral,” RBS analysts led by Ian Smillie wrote in a report to clients. “Absent a turn in the
economic data, it looks increasingly like a large and credible
move by the authorities will be required to stabilize
confidence.”  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
