Standard & Poor’s  is reconsidering an
earlier decision to possibly downgrade the U.S. government debt
rating after the Obama administration challenged S&P’s
conclusions,  CNN  reported, citing an unidentified administration
official.  S&P is revising its analysis after assertions that its
conclusions were off by “trillions,” CNN cited the official as
saying. Some S&P analysts are still in favor of a downgrade, the
official told CNN.   To contact the reporter on this story:
