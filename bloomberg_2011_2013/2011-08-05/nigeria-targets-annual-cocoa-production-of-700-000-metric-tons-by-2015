Nigeria , the world’s fourth-largest
cocoa producer, plans to almost double production in four years
by providing farmers with access to new seeds, fertilizers and
finance, Agriculture Minister Akinwunmi Adesida said.  Production will increase to 700,000 metric tons by 2015
from about 380,000 tons, Adesida said in an interview in Abuja,
the capital, yesterday. Cocoa is Nigeria’s second-biggest
foreign-exchange earner after oil, according to the government.  Nigeria will “make sure that farmers get access to
fertilizers and other agrochemicals,” Adesida said.  Nigeria’s cocoa trees produce an average 450
kilograms (992 pounds) a hectare (2.47 acres), according to
Chris Okafor, a researcher at the Ibadan-based International
 Institute  of Tropical Agriculture. Newer varieties can produce
up to 2,000 kilograms a hectare, he said.  Ivory Coast , Ghana and
 Indonesia  are the largest producers, according to the
International Cocoa Organization.  Exports of cocoa products from Nigeria rose 47
percent to $822.8 million in 2010, Olakunle Akingbola, business
development manager of Cobalt International Services, an
inspection company, said on June 2. Cocoa prices in  London  have
more than doubled since the end of 2006.  A Cocoa Market and Trade Development Corp., run by private
companies, will be set up, Adesida said. “We expect that within
the next three months, we’ll have a new blueprint for cocoa
revitalization for Nigeria,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
