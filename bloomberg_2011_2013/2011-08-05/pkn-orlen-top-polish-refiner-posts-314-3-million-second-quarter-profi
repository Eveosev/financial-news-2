PKN Orlen SA reported second-quarter
profit on higher sales driven by rising oil prices and a stable
currency, a year after  Poland ’s largest refiner posted a net
loss driven by financial operations.  Orlen had net income of 898.6 million zloty ($314.3
million), compared with a loss of 5.25 million zloty a year
earlier, the Plock, central Poland-based company said in a
regulatory statement today. The mean estimate of seven analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg called for a profit of 874 million zloty.  Orlen had lost 1.09 billion zloty on financial operations
in the same period a year earlier as the zloty weakened by 15
percent in the quarter, increasing the value of its foreign-
currency denominated loans. This year the loss was 13.4 million
zloty as the Polish currency strengthened 3.5 percent against
the dollar.  Orlen is set to report record profit this year after
agreeing in June to sell its stake in Polish mobile phone
company Polkomtel SA for 3.7 billion zloty. Pretax profit on the
transaction, once it’s completed, will be about 2.5 billion
zloty. The state-controlled company plans to use the cash to
invest in oil and gas exploration and production.  Sales in the quarter rose 21 percent to 25.6 billion zloty
as Brent oil prices increased 50 percent from a year earlier,
the country’s largest company said. That missed the mean
estimate of 26.2 billion zloty.  Earnings before interest and taxes, or Ebit, fell to 1.01
billion zloty from 1.12 billion zloty a year earlier as refining
margins narrowed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
