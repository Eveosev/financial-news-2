Heat will spread from “coast to
coast” by mid-August with the most intense outbreaks centering
on the southern central U.S.,  Matt Rogers , president of
 Commodity Weather Group  LLC, said today.  Rogers’s 6- to 10-day forecast calls for the heat to
stretch from the Pacific to the Atlantic while remaining
primarily in the southern half of the U.S. from Aug. 10 to Aug.
14. Then it will climb into the northern Rocky Mountains, Great
Lakes and  New York  in the 11- to 15-day forecast covering Aug.
15 to Aug. 19.  “The core of the most persistent and frequently strongest
heat is still in the mid-continent, but this hot ridge expansion
should keep Texas from being quite as severe as this past
week,” Rogers wrote in a note to clients.  Excessive heat warnings and advisories cover the southern
central U.S. from  Kansas  to Texas and as far east as Alabama,
according to the National Weather Service. The temperature in
Dallas is expected to reach 108 degrees Fahrenheit (42 Celsius)
today and  be above 105 until next week.  The temperature at Love Field Airport in Dallas has been
above 100 for 34 days, according to the weather service. The
record is 42 days set in June through August of 1980. As of
yesterday,  Fort Smith , Arkansas, has been at or above 100
degrees for 31 days, breaking the 17-day mark set in 1934.  The  Electric Reliability Council  of Texas set a record for
electricity demand of 68,294 megawatts two days ago, according
to a statement by the grid operator.  To contact the reporter on this story:
