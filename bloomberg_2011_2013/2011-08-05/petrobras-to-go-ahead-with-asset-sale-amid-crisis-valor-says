Petroleo Brasileiro SA (PETR4)  will go ahead
with plans to sell assets even after the global stock and bond
markets slumped this week,  Valor Economico  reported on its
website, citing Chief Executive Officer Jose Sergio Gabrielli.  The market rout wonâ€™t prevent the Brazilian state-run  oil
company  from raising the funds needed for its investment plan,
Gabrielli told the Sao Paulo-based newspaper.  To contact the reporter on this story:
