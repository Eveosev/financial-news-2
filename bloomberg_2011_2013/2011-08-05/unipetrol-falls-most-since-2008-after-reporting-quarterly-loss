Unipetrol SA, the  Czech Republic ’s
largest oil refiner, fell to a 16-month low in Prague trading
after reporting a second-quarter loss and forecasting a
“difficult” second half.  Unipetrol declined 0.9 percent to 170 koruna, the lowest
closing price since April 8, 2010, after earlier tumbling as
much as 12 percent. Other energy stocks also fell on concern the
global economic recovery is stalling.  The company had a net loss of 1 million koruna ($58,207) in
the quarter, compared with a profit of 520 million koruna a year
earlier, Unipetrol said yesterday. “We expect the second half
of 2011 to be difficult, not only because of macroeconomic
conditions but also because we plan refinery outages,” it said.  The Prague-based company is among refiners to have suffered
from the rising price of feedstock. Brent crude traded at an
average $116.99 a barrel in the second quarter, 47 percent
higher than a year earlier. Petroplus Holdings AG,  Europe ’s
largest independent refiner, reported a wider quarterly loss on
Aug. 3, citing an “extremely weak” refining market.  Refining margins, or the profit from turning crude into
fuels, “collapsed” to 30 cents a barrel in the second quarter
from $1.60 a barrel in the first as  oil prices  rose, Unipetrol
said. Currency swings shaved 150 million koruna off profit.  The company will invest more than 1 billion koruna in
maintenance this year, it said, adding that it aims to cut fixed
costs by 200 million koruna and will continue to reduce staff.  “The quarterly results are disappointing,” Bohumil
Trampota, an analyst at Prague-based J&T Banka, said in a note.
“They lagged our estimates, as well as those of the market.”  Unipetrol cited only one “positive macroeconomic
development,” the Brent-Urals differential, or the difference
between prices of higher-quality  Brent crude  and Urals oil. The
differential jumped to $2.90 a barrel from $1.60 a year earlier,
it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
