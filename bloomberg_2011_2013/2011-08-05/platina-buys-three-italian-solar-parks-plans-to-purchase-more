Platina Partners LLP, a London-based
private equity firm, bought three solar plants in  Italy  and
plans to buy more to take advantage of growth in the world’s
largest market for so-called photovoltaic power after Germany.  The investor in renewable energy agreed to buy plants with
15 megawatts of capacity yesterday and plans to boost business
in the country to 30 to 50 megawatts through further purchases,
Managing Partner Thomas Rottner said in an interview in  London .  Including the latest transaction, the company operates 13
Italian solar parks with 25 megawatts of capacity.  The country’s overall installed projects have expanded to
almost 9 gigawatts, from about 1 gigawatt in late 2009, the
renewable energy regulator’s latest  figures  show. That has made
the Italian market interesting for Platina, Rottner said.  The firm invests in projects using a 208 million-euro ($295
million) European renewable energy fund it closed to new
investors in March 2010. Platina operates about 300 megawatts of
renewable capacity, mainly in wind farms, and is studying
creating another fund, Rottner said.  The company bought 15 megawatts of solar projects planned
for  India  this year and may bid in a tender expected in  France 
this month for incentives to build solar developments, he said.  Platina doesn’t have any immediate plans for new projects
in  Spain , where it operates the remainder of its solar capacity.  To contact the reporter on this story:
