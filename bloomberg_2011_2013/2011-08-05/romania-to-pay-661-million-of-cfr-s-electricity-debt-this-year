Romania  will this year pay 1.98
billion lei ($661 million) that CFR SA, the state-owned railway
company, owes to its electricity suppliers, including  CEZ AS (CEZ) ,
 E.ON AG (EOAN)  and  Enel SpA (ENEL) , Transport Minister Anca Boagiu said.  The price of 476 lei per megawatt-hour that CFR is paying
for the electricity is triple the production cost, Boagiu said,
adding that almost half of the debt represents penalties for
delayed payments for used electricity “which is not normal.”  “I would recommend to all the electricity suppliers to
look very carefully at the prices CFR is paying them” and
“don’t assume Romania is a no-man’s land,” Boagiu told a news
conference in Bucharest today. “We don’t plan to erase CFR’s
debt and we will pay it this year. Afterwards CFR will be able
to buy electricity from the free market.”  Jan Veskrna, the chief executive officer of CEZ’s Romanian
unit, said yesterday the company may have to ask for bankruptcy
of its unprofitable sales unit, CEZ Vanzare, or stop investing
in it if it fails to recover a 330 million-lei debt from CFR.  Prime Minister Emil Boc’s government, which plans to sell a
20 percent stake in CFR’s freight unit, CFR Marfa, seeks to
select a manager for the sale by November, Boagiu said. It may
also select a manager for a 20 percent stake sale in the
national carrier Tarom, by the same month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
