The U.K.’s  Financial Services
Authority  will review banks’ bonus policies for 2012 before
authorizing their payment, the regulator said in a draft letter
to chief executive officers of financial firms.  The chairmen of lenders’ remuneration committees will be
asked to certify to the FSA that their firm is compliant with
the supervisor’s bonus code. Banks will have to provide
information on the size and timing of bonus payments and won’t
be able to inform staff until the supervisor approves the plans.  “We will check for compliance against code requirements
and, provided that compliance is confirmed, indicate that you
may announce and distribute the awards,” Andrew Bailey,
director of U.K. banks at the FSA, said in a draft letter on the
supervisor’s  website  today.  Regulators across the world are targeting bankers’ pay and
bonuses to prevent a repeat of the excessive risk taking and
focus on short-term profits that they say contributed to the
global financial crisis following the collapse of  Lehman
Brothers Holdings Inc. (LEHMQ)  in September 2008. They have called for
payouts to be linked to success, instead of rewarding failure.  As much as 60 percent of a bonus payout for risk-takers and
senior managers must be deferred for at least three years, and
half of the amount must be in the form of shares under the FSA’s
bonus code which came in to force at the start of the year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
