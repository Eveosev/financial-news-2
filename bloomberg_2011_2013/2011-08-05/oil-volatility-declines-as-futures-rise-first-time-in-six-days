Oil options volatility decreased as
futures rose for the first time in six days in  New York 
following a report that the U.S. added more jobs than forecast
in July and  Italy  said it will speed up austerity measures.  Implied volatility for at-the-money options expiring in
September, a measure of expected price swings in futures and a
gauge of options prices, was 40.5 percent at 4:48 p.m. in New
York, down from 42.4 percent yesterday.  Oil for September delivery gained 25 cents, or 0.3 percent,
to $86.88 a barrel on the  New York Mercantile Exchange . Prices
tumbled 9.2 percent this week.  The most active contracts in electronic trading today were
September $80 puts, with 8,362 lots changing hands. They fell 18
cents to 60 cents a barrel. September $70 puts, the next-most
active option, fell 2 cents to 7 cents a barrel with 3,042 lots
trading. One contract covers 1,000 barrels of crude.  The exchange distributes real-time data for electronic
trading and releases information on floor trading, where the
bulk of options trading occurs, the next business day.  September $85 puts were the most active options traded
yesterday, with 16,440 lots changing hands. They advanced $1.66
to $2.09 a barrel. The next-most active options, September $80
puts, increased 66 cents to 78 cents on volume of 11,557.  Open interest was highest for December $80 puts with 47,578
