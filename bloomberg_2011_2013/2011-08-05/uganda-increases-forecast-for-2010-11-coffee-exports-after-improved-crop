Uganda ,  Africa ’s second-biggest
coffee producer, raised its export forecast for 2010-11 by as
much as 12 percent after an improved harvest in the country’s
southwestern region, the Uganda Coffee Development Authority
said.  Shipments in the 12 months through September will probably
be between 2.8 million and 2.9 million 60-kilogram (132-
pounds)bags, from an April estimate of 2.6 million bags, an
official, who declined to be named because he isn’t authorized
to speak to the media, said by phone from the capital, Kampala,
today.  The agency reduced its forecast in April from an initial
3.1 million bags projection after a drought cut yields in the
central and eastern regions.  To contact the reporter on this story:
