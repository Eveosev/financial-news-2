Wheat futures fell for the third
straight day on lingering concern that cheaper grain from
Eastern Europe will erode demand for supplies from the U.S., the
world’s top exporter.  Russia and  Romania  sold a combined 240,000 metric tons
yesterday to  Egypt , the world’s largest wheat importer, at
$261.94 and $262.50 a ton. As of July 22, U.S. soft wheat for
export traded at $275.30 a ton.  “The export market has been a struggle with the low-priced
wheat coming from Russia and Romania,”  Shawn McCambridge , the
senior grain analyst at Jefferies Bache LLC in Chicago, said by
telephone.  Wheat futures for December delivery dropped 2.5 cents, or
0.3 percent, to close at $7.23 a bushel at 1:15 p.m. on the
Chicago Board of Trade, bringing the three-day slide to 4.7
percent. The most-active contract has declined 11 percent in the
past year.  On July 1,  Russia  lifted a ban on grain shipments after the
worst drought in 50 years damaged last year’s crop. The nation
was the world’s second-largest wheat exporter during the
2009-2010 season, International Grains Council data show.  Wheat prices may get a boost from a rally in corn,
McCambridge said. Corn, the primary ingredient used in livestock
feed, jumped 5.1 percent this week.  “Wheat is going to continue to follow corn as there’s a
possible upside in replacing corn in feed,” McCambridge said.  Wheat is the fourth-largest U.S. crop, valued at $13
billion in 2010, behind corn, soybeans and hay, government data
show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
