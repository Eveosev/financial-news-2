Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc (RBS) ’s
first-half earnings, scheduled to be announced today, may show
the U.K.’s five biggest banks have exceeded targets for
corporate lending under the so-called project Merlin accord
between the banks and government, the Financial Times reported,
without saying how it got the information.  RBS,  Lloyds Banking Group Plc (LLOY) , Banco Santander SA,  HSBC
Holdings Plc (HSBA)  and  Barclays Plc (BARC)  may have made a total of about 100
billion pounds ($163 billion) of corporate credit available in
the first six months of the year, beating a 95 billion-pound
target, the newspaper said. The banks may miss a 38 billion-
pound target for lending to small businesses, the FT said.  To contact the writer on the story:
