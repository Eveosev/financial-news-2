U.S. options volume jumped to a
second straight record today as stocks whipsawed investors and
the Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility Index, or VIX,
climbed to the highest level in more than a year.  More than 39 million options on stocks, indexes and
exchange-traded funds changed hands today on U.S. exchanges,
according to a preliminary tally, said Jim Binder, a spokesman
for Chicago-based OCC, which settles all trades. That topped
yesterday’s record of 36.1 million contracts and the prior
record before this week of 30.8 million on May 6, 2010, when a
20-minute rout erased $862 billion from the value of U.S. shares
before stocks rebounded.  The VIX rose 1.1 percent today to 32, the highest level
since July 2010. It jumped 35 percent yesterday, the most in
more than four years, as concern grew that the U.S. might slip
into recession. The index measures the cost of using options as
insurance against declines in the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index,
which has fallen 11 percent over the past 10 days.  “Investor confidence right now is trending downward,”
 Andy Nybo , head of derivatives at New York-based Tabb Group LLC,
said in a telephone interview. “The lack of certainty in terms
of the economic environment, in terms of the economic policies
in the U.S. government is causing investor confidence to remain
weak at best.” He added, “I think we’re in for a bumpy ride.”  The  S&P 500  slumped the most since 2008 this week as
economic data worsened and  Europe  struggled to contain its debt
crisis. The gauge has retreated 11 percent since July 22, the
biggest loss over the same amount of time since March 9, 2009,
when the equity bull market began. It had risen as much as 8.4
percent this year through April 29 amid government stimulus
measures and higher-than-estimated corporate earnings.  To contact the reporters on this story:
