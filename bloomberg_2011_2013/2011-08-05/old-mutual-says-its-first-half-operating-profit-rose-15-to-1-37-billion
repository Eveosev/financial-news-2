Old Mutual Plc (OML) , the U.K.’s third-
largest insurer by market value, said the planned initial public
offering of its U.S. asset management business is unlikely to
happen by the end of 2012 because of concerns that the U.S.
recovery is faltering amid plummeting stock prices.  The public offer is not “mission critical” to Old
Mutual’s plans to pay down 1.5 billion pounds ($2.4 billion) of
debt by the end of next year, Julian Roberts, the London-based
chief executive officer, said on a conference call today. By the
end of July the insurer had paid down 482 million pounds of its
debt, the company said.  The company also reported in a statement that its first-
half profit almost doubled as earnings increased in emerging
markets, with net income climbing to 489 million pounds in the
six months to June from 265 million pounds a year earlier.
Earnings per share excluding one-time items rose to 7 pence a
share from 2.6 pence a year earlier, a figure restated to show
the effect of the sale of a U.S. unit, said the insurer.  Old Mutual,  Africa ’s largest insurer, said last year it may
also dispose of its stake in South Africa’s  Nedbank Group Ltd. (NED) 
as part of its plan to cut debt. The company agreed in 2010 to
sell its U.S. life unit to Harbinger Capital Partners for $350
million. In October, talks to sell its $3.7 billion stake in
 Nedbank  to HSBC Holdings Plc collapsed.  “We remain on track to achieve our 2012 targets and
despite volatile markets will continue to make further progress
against our strategic goals as and when  shareholder value  can be
created,” Roberts said in the statement. The insurer increased
its half-year dividend by 36 percent to 1.5 pence a share.  The insurer is the fourth-worst performing stock on the
eight-member  FTSE 350 Life Insurance (F3LIFE)  Index this year, having
slumped 9.9 percent compared with the average decline of 8.9
percent. The shares traded down 1.9 percent to 110.9 pence a
share in  London .  To contact the reporter on this story:
