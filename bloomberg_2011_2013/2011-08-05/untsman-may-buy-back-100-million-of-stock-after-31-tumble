Huntsman Corp. (HUN) , the U.S. chemicals
producer founded by the family of presidential candidate Jon Huntsman Jr., said it will buy back as much as $100 million of
shares after they tumbled 31 percent yesterday.  The repurchase is effective immediately, the company said
in a statement today. The shares rose 1.9 percent in New York.  Huntsman fell yesterday after posting second second-quarter
profit that trailed analysts’ estimates. U.S. stocks also
plunged on concern the economy is weakening. The Standard &
Poor’s 500 Index fell yesterday to an eight-month low, extending
a nine-day retreat to 11 percent, the biggest loss over the same
amount of time since March 9, 2009.  “This share repurchase program is an expression of
confidence in the company’s long term future and ability to
create further  shareholder value ,” Chief Executive Officer
Peter Huntsman said in the statement.  The company, which is run from offices in  Salt Lake City 
and The Woodlands,  Texas , also declared a quarterly dividend of
10 cents. The shares rose 24 cents to $12:74 as of 2:54 p.m. in
New York Stock Exchange composite trading.  Second-quarter earnings excluding restructuring and
acquisition costs rose to 48 cents a share from 31 cents a year
earlier, the company reported yesterday. That missed the 49-cent
average of seven analysts’ estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  The Huntsman family is the largest shareholder in the
company, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
