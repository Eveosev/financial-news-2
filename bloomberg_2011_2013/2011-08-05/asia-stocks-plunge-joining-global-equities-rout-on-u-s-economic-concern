Asian stocks tumbled, with the
regional benchmark index falling more than 10 percent from its
May peak, as concern the world economy is weakening sparked an
equities rout that drove the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index to its
worst slump since February 2009.  Sony Corp., a Japanese exporter of consumer electronics
that earns half of its revenue in the U.S. and Europe, slumped 5
percent in  Tokyo .  Toyota Motor Corp. (7203) , the world’s largest
carmaker, retreated 3.2 percent.  BHP Billiton Ltd. (BHP) , the biggest
global mining company and Australia’s No. 1 oil producer, sank
4.8 percent as commodity prices dropped and the nation’s central
bank slashed the country’s economic growth forecast.  “It’s a panic attack from fear that growth is dropping off
a cliff,” said Prasad Patkar, who helps manage the equivalent
of $1.7 billion at Sydney-based Platypus Asset Management Ltd.
“There was an expectation that resolution of the U.S. debt-
ceiling issue would trigger a relief rally. It looks like
everyone forgot about the weakness in the underlying economy.”  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index slumped 3.6 percent to 126.12
as of 7:48 p.m. in Tokyo. Just 34 stocks advanced on the
benchmark of 1,018 companies, the lowest number since October
2008, according to data tracked by Bloomberg. The measure is
headed for 7.8 percent decline this week, amid concern the U.S.
economic recovery will stall after growth slowed in
manufacturing and service industries and employment cooled in
the world’s biggest economy.  Weekly Drop  The week’s drop is the biggest weekly decline since October
2008, when credit markets froze following the collapse of Lehman
Brothers Holdings Inc. The gauge is down 10 percent from its May
2 high, a decline that some analysts say signals a
“correction.”  Japan ’s  Nikkei 225 (NKY)  Stock Average and South Korea’s Kospi
index both sank slipped 3.7 percent. India’s Sensitive Index
slipped 2.2 percent in Mumbai.  Hong Kong ’s Hang Seng Index slumped 4.3 percent, the
biggest plunge since November 2009, while  China ’s Shanghai
Composite Index dropped 2.2 percent.  Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 Index plunged 4 percent after the
 Reserve Bank  of Australia slashed its 2011 economic growth
forecast to 2 percent from its previous estimate of 3.25
percent. The central bank raised the outlook for inflation as
delays in coal production, risks to global financial markets and
subdued consumer spending delay a rebound.  ‘May Get Worse’  U.S. options prices soared the most in four years as
investors scrambled to buy protection against greater stock-
market losses as worsening economic data sent stocks to the
longest losing streak since the bull market began in March 2009.  “The latest weakness in stocks is the product of global
investors coming to the conclusion that global growth is no
longer getting incrementally better and may even get worse,”
said  Angus Gluskie , who manages about $350 million at White
Funds Management in Sydney. “The moves this week reflects the
mental capitulation of investors from hope to pessimism, and
each day’s fall is only reinforcing the negative outlook.”  Exporters dropped on concern demand from the U.S. and
Europe, the two biggest markets for Asian companies, will
decline.  Sony Corp. (6758) , the maker of Bravia televisions and PlayStation
game consoles, dropped 5 percent to 1,828 yen in Tokyo. Toyota
Motor slipped 3.2 percent to 3,040 yen. Samsung Electronics Co.,
South Korea’s No. 1 exporter of consumer electronics, fell 3.9
percent to 789,000 won in Seoul.  Li & Fung Ltd. (494) , the biggest
supplier of toys and clothes to retailers including Wal-Mart
Stores Inc., dropped 4 percent to HK$12.04 in Hong Kong.  Global Rout  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index lost 0.2 percent
today. In  New York  yesterday, the  S&P 500  tumbled 4.8 percent to
an eight-month low of 1,200.07, erasing its 2011 gain. The Stoxx
Europe 600 Index sank 3.5 percent to 243.16 in  London , the
biggest decline since May 2010.  The global rout, which has wiped out more than $4.5
trillion from market values worldwide since the selling began on
July 26, has made stocks “extremely oversold,” Marc Faber,
publisher of the Gloom, Boom & Doom report, said on Bloomberg
Television.  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index fell 5.8 percent in the last
three trading days, its biggest such decline since March 15,
amid growing concern the  U.S. economy  may be heading for another
economic recession as consumption remains weak amid the nation’s
high unemployment rate.  U.S. Jobs  The U.S. Labor Department said yesterday that initial
claims for unemployment insurance payments fell last week to a
level that shows limited improvement in the labor market of the
world’s biggest economy. Applications for jobless benefits
dropped 1,000 in the week ended July 30 to 400,000, the fewest
in almost four months.  Employers added 85,000 workers in July, economists project
a Labor Department report to show today, failing to reduce a
jobless rate that’s holding above 9 percent.  Gauges of raw material producers and energy companies led
the decline among the 10 industry groups in the MSCI Asia
Pacific Index after commodity prices slumped.  BHP dropped 4.8 percent to A$38.12. United Co. Rusal, the
world’s No. 1 aluminum producer, tumbled 12 percent to HK$9.25
in Hong Kong. Glencore International Plc, the world’s largest-
listed commodity trader, slumped 8.9 percent to HK$51.40.  Cnooc
Ltd. (883) , China’s biggest offshore oil producer, decreased 5.9
percent to HK$15.54.  Rio Tinto  Crude oil for September delivery fell 5.8 percent to $86.63
a barrel in New York yesterday, the lowest settlement since Feb.
18. The London Metal Exchange Index of prices for six industrial
metals including copper and aluminum lost 1.9 percent.  Rio Tinto Group, the world’s second-biggest mining company
by sales, also declined 6 percent to A$72 in Sydney after
posting first-half profit that missed analyst estimates as costs
and currency gains in Australia and Canada hurt earnings.  Of the 402 companies in the MSCI Asia Pacific Index that
reported earnings since July 11, 176 beat analyst estimates,
while 132 fell short, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Billionaire Li Ka-shing’s  Cheung Kong Holdings Ltd. (1)  and
 Hutchison Whampoa Ltd. (13)  slumped after reporting earnings that
missed estimates.  Cheung Kong, Hong Kong’s second-biggest developer by market
value, declined 6.2 percent to HK$112.20. The company said
yesterday first-half net income almost tripled to HK$33.3
billion ($4.3 billion). That compares with the average estimate
of HK$34.9 billion in a Bloomberg survey of five analysts.  Hutchison Whampoa, Li’s biggest company, slumped 8.3
percent to HK$82.90 after posting first-half profit that also
missed analyst estimates as a loss at its Australian mobile-
phone unit eroded gains from utilities and energy.  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index lost 5 percent this year
through yesterday, compared with drops of 4.6 percent by the S&P
500 and 11.8 percent by the Stoxx  Europe  600 Index. Stocks in
the Asian benchmark were valued at 13 times estimated earnings
on average, compared with 12 times for the S&P 500 and 9.9 times
for the Stoxx 600.  To contact the reporters on this story:
