A Greek court decided as many as 15
people should stand trial on fraud charges related to a 280
million-euro ($397 million) structured bond transaction, Athens
 News Agency  reported.  The case relates to the sale of a structured bond to Greek
social insurance funds at inflated prices, ANA said, without
citing anyone.  A  district attorney  presented a 250-page report proposing
the 15 be indicted for offences including tax evasion,
conspiracy to defraud and embezzlement, according to ANA. Those
facing charges include the former heads of three social security
funds and people involved in the matter from JPMorgan Chase &
Co., the news agency said.  No one at the Athens Court of Appeals was immediately
available to comment. Prosecutor George Lekkas declined comment
when reached by telephone at his office, because the case is
continuing.  Harry Adamopoulos, JPMorgan’s senior officer for  Greece ,
didn’t answer a call to his London office or immediately respond
to an e-mail. JPMorgan spokespeople Jane Drew, Juliana Wheeler
and Axel Luedeke didn’t respond to e-mails seeking comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
