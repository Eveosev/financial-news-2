Suzlon Energy Ltd. (SUEL) ,  Asia ’s third-
largest wind-turbine maker, fell the most in six weeks in Mumbai
trading after receiving a $490,000 fine for pollution violations
at its plant in Minnesota.  Suzlon dropped 6.1 percent to 48.6 rupees at the 3:30 p.m.
close in Mumbai. That’s the biggest one-day decline since June
20. The benchmark Sensitive Index of the Bombay Stock Exchange
fell 2.2 percent.  The turbine company failed to get permits to carry out
sandblasting or to install a fourth  production line  at its
blade-making facility in Pipestone, the Minnesota Pollution
Control Agency said late yesterday in a website  statement .  The matter dates back to 2008, and Suzlon has already
rectified all infractions identified by the agency, the
Ahmedabad, India-based company said today in an e-mailed
statement. Suzlon will pay the fine over four quarters, it said
in a separate e-mailed response to questions.  To contact the reporter on this story:
