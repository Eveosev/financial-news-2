Citigroup Inc. (C) , the third-biggest
U.S. bank, was subpoenaed by the California Attorney General’s
Office over mortgage securitization, a person familiar with the
matter said.  Attorney General Kamala Harris, who is investigating
mortgage fraud, is seeking information from the New York-based
bank on its practices, said the person, who wasn’t authorized to
speak publicly about the matter and didn’t want to be
identified.  The subpoena comes after Harris’s May announcement that she
had set up a mortgage-fraud  task force  to investigate “every
step” of the mortgage process from lending to securitization.  Shum Preston, a spokesman for Harris, and Mark Costiglio, a
Citigroup spokesman, declined to comment yesterday on the
subpoena.  The subpoena was reported earlier yesterday by the Los
Angeles Times.  Harris is part of a group of state  attorneys general  and
federal officials that is negotiating a nationwide settlement
with U.S. banks over their foreclosure and mortgage-servicing
practices. Citigroup is one of the five banks involved in those
talks.  Attorneys general in  New York , Delaware and Massachusetts
are also conducting investigations into mortgage practices of
banks as the settlement negotiations continue.  To contact the reporter on this story:
