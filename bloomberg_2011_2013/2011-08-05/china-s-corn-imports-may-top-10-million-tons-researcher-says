China’s annual corn imports may grow
to more than 10 million metric tons in five years as the
increase in demand outpaces expansion in output, a researcher at
South China Grain Trade Center said.  As consumers switch to diets rich in meat, poultry, eggs
and dairy, more demand for corn to feed livestock will reduce
the consumption of wheat and rice, Zheng Wenhui, an analyst at
the Guangdong-based exchange, wrote in a report posted on the
 website  of China Academy of Social Sciences today.  Corn consumption by farm animals may rise to over 170
million tons by 2015 from 133 million tons this year, assuming
the same 5 percent annual growth rate seen in the last five
years, Zheng wrote. Demand far exceeds the country’s current
ability to produce the grain, Zheng said.  The rate of growth in corn consumption will be even higher
if it includes industrial usage, which the government has
unsuccessfully tried to curb through administrative measures,
Zheng wrote.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
