Argentina ’s capital outflows
accelerated in the second quarter to $6.1 billion from $3.7
billion in the first three months of the year, the country’s
 central bank  reported.  First half outflows of $9.8 billion compared with $6.6
billion in the same 2010 period, the bank said last night in its
second-quarter report on the exchange balance. Last year,
capital outflows totaled $11.4 billion.  The bank, based in Buenos Aires, said that the increase is
normal because the country is heading to a presidential election
on Oct. 23. President  Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner  is favored
to win a second-term, according to polls.  “It reflects the usual behavior of the private sector
during pre-election times, mainly demand for foreign currencies
by savers of small amounts,” the bank said.  Residents bought $4.8 billion in foreign currencies in the
period, $1.9 billion more than in the first quarter, according
to the report. About 45 percent of the transactions were for
amounts of up to $10,000 a month.  The peso, which was little changed yesterday at 4.1535 per
dollar, has fallen 4.2 percent in the year, the most among Latin
American currencies tracked by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
