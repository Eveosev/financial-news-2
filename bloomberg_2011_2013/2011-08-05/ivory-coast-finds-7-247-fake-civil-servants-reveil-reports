Ivory Coast  conducted a survey of
workers listed on state payrolls and found 7,247 names of
people that may be fictitious,  le Nouveau Reveil  reported,
citing Gnamien Konan, minister of administrative reform.  The West African nation, which has almost 133,000 civil
servants, spent 800 billion  CFA francs  ($1.7 billion) on
salaries in 2010, from 453 billion francs in 2000, the
Abidjan-based newspaper cited Konan as saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
