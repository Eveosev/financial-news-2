Oil pared losses in  New York  after a
report showed the U.S. created more jobs than forecast in July.  Payrolls rose by 117,000 workers in July, Labor Department
data showed. The median estimate in Bloomberg News survey called
for a July gain of 85,000 workers. The U.S. is the world’s
biggest consumer of crude oil.  Crude for September delivery was at $86.53 a barrel, down
10 cents, on the  New York Mercantile Exchange  as of 1:45 p.m.
London time. The contract traded at as much as $88.32 a barrel
after the report.  “With the oil rally petering out so quickly after the
figures it suggests we’re going to continue the down trend,”
said Alexander  Ridgers, London-based head of commodities at CMC
Markets, which handles about $180 million a day in U.S. crude
contracts.  Oil flows will resume through an Iranian pipeline in a
“few hours” after an explosion today halted operations, the
state-run Mehr news service said, without saying how the 
information was obtained.  The pipeline, which carries crude to plants in the
southwestern Iranian city of Ahvaz from Qalat Naar, suffered an
explosion and fire, the news service said. Ahvaz, in Khuzestan
province, is near the border with  Iraq . The cause of the blast
wasn’t known, Mehr said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
