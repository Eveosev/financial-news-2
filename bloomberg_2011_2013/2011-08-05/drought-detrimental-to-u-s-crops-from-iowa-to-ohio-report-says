Hot, dry U.S. weather in the past
week had a “detrimental impact” on crops from Iowa to  Ohio ,
worsening “an already dire situation” in south-central states,
a National Drought Mitigation Center report showed.  A historic 10-month drought in states including  Texas 
“left little hope” for crops that rely on rain for irrigation,
according to the  U.S. Drought Monitor  published yesterday by the
Lincoln, Nebraska-based center. The heat wave has moved into the
Midwest, the top corn and soybean-growing region in the U.S.,
the world’s largest producer and exporter.  “Previously, the drought had been limited” to the
southern Great Plains,  Rich Nelson , the director of research at
Allendale Inc. in McHenry, Illinois, said by telephone. “Now,
yield damage has been made, and will continue to be made, in
corn.”  Corn-crop  conditions  deteriorated in  Iowa , the biggest U.S.
producer, along with Illinois, Nebraska, Indiana and Missouri in
the week ending July 31, the  U.S. Department of Agriculture  said
in an Aug. 1 report. The Midwest may receive 1 inch to 2 inches
(5.1 centimeters) of rain and cooler weather in the next four
days, according to the U.S. Drought Monitor.  The Climate Prediction Center said yesterday that a weather
pattern known as La Nina may bring less rain for southern
states. Tropical Storm Don, which made landfall on July 29 and
was expected to provide rain to Texas, “literally disintegrated
upon moving inland,” the U.S. Drought Monitor said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
