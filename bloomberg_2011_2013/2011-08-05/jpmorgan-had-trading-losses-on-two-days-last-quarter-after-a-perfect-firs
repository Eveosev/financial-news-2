JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) , the second-
biggest  U.S. bank  by assets, had two days of trading losses last
quarter after a perfect first three months in 2011.  Gains from market-related risk in the investment bank,
chief investment office and mortgage-banking unit topped $200
million on four days during the first half, New York-based
JPMorgan said today in a filing with the Securities and Exchange
Commission.  The two days of losses didn’t exceed the firm’s value-at-
risk gauge, JPMorgan said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
