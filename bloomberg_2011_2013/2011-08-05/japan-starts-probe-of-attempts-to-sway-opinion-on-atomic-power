Japan ’s government set up an
independent panel to investigate alleged attempts by electricity
companies and the industry regulator to influence public opinion
on nuclear power.  Four legal experts will investigate the claims and
recommend ways to prevent a recurrence, the Ministry of Economy,
Trade and Industry said in a statement on its website. The panel
will hold its first meeting on August 9 and release an interim
report at the end of this month, it said.  Chubu Electric Power Co., one of Japan’s regional
electricity monopolies, said last week the Nuclear and
Industrial Safety Agency asked the utility to prepare questions
favoring atomic power for a public hearing in 2007. METI
Minister  Banri Kaieda  said yesterday he will resign after
replacing three officials in charge of  energy policy .  The panel members are Takashi Oizumi, a lawyer, Toshihiko
Suzuki, a professor of law at Meiji Gakuin University, Kenji
Hirose, a law professor at Rikkyo University, and Shunsuke
Marushima, a lawyer, according to the statement.  Public opinion has been turning against atomic power after
Tokyo Electric Power Co.’s Fukushima Dai-Ichi plant was damaged
in the March earthquake and tsunami, causing the worst nuclear
disaster since Chernobyl in 1986.  Kyushu Electric Power Co. last month said it asked staffers
at affiliates to send e-mails supporting the restart of reactors
to an internet-broadcast show run by METI on nuclear plant
safety.  To contact the reporter on this story:
