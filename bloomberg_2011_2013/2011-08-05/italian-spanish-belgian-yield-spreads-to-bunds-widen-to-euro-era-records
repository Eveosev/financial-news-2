Italian, Spanish and Belgian bonds
opened lower, driving yields on the securities relative to
German bunds to the most since before the euro was introduced in
1999.  The yield on 10-year Italian bonds jumped 19 basis points
to 6.38 percent as of 7:40 a.m. in  London  after reaching 6.40
percent, the highest since 1997. That pushed the difference in
yield, or spread, with benchmark German bunds as wide as 414
basis points. The yield on two-year Italian notes jumped to more
than 5 percent.  Spanish and Belgian bonds also opened lower, sending the
yield spreads to bunds to 415 basis points and 229 basis points
respectively.  To contact the reporter on this story:
