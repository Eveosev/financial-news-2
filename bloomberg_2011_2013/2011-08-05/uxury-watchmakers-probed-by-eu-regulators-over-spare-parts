Luxury watch manufacturers will be
probed by European Union antitrust regulators over allegations
they refused to supply spare parts to independent watch menders.  The European Commission said it will investigate a 2004
complaint by the  European Confederation of Watch & Clock
Repairers’ Associations , or CEAHR, after an EU court  ruled  that
regulators were wrong to dismiss the group’s concerns.  Swatch Group AG (UHR) , the world’s biggest watch maker, was
targeted by the probe which “concerns almost the entire watch
industry,” it said in a statement. “We are confident regarding
the outcome of this investigation.”  The start of EU formal antitrust proceedings “means that
the commission will investigate the case as a matter of
priority,” regulators said in an e-mailed statement.  Cie. Financiere Richemont SA, the maker of Cartier watches,
supported EU regulators in the court case. Alan Grieve, a
spokesman for Richemont, declined to comment today.  Olivier Labesse, a spokesman for  LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis
Vuitton SA (MC) , declined to comment. Rolex didn’t immediately
respond to an e-mail seeking comment. A spokesman for  Patek
Philippe  wasn’t immediately available. CEAHR didn’t immediately
respond to an e-mail seeking comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
