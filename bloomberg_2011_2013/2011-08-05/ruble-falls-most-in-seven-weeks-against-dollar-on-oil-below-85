The ruble weakened the most against
the dollar in seven weeks as oil,  Russia ’s chief export earner,
fell for a sixth day in  New York  and traded under $85 a barrel.  Russia’s currency depreciated 1.1 percent to 28.3745 per
dollar as of 10:42 a.m. in Moscow, the biggest intraday drop
since June 16. It has weakened or remained unchanged against the
greenback every day since July 26. The ruble was 0.6 percent
weaker at 39.97 per euro, leaving it down 0.8 percent at 33.5914
against the central bank’s target dollar-euro basket.  Oil fell for a sixth day in New York, slipping below $85 a
barrel and heading for its biggest weekly drop since May, on
speculation that fuel demand may falter as U.S. economic growth
stalls and  Europe ’s debt crisis worsens. Crude for September
delivery dropped 3.6 percent to $83.50 a barrel.  “The oil developments are bad, putting the ruble under
pressure for sure,”  Denis Korshilov , the Moscow-based head of
fixed income, currencies and commodities in Russia at Citigroup
Inc., said by e-mail. Investors can expect the losing streak to
continue “because of global developments,” he said. “It looks
like a recession is coming.”  Russian  government bonds  rose, pushing the yield on the
dollar Eurobond due in 2020 down two basis points, or 0.02
percentage point, to 4.171 percent. The yield on the ruble
Eurobond, due 2018, rose six basis points to 6.84 percent.  Non-deliverable forwards, which provide a guide to
expectations of currency movements and allow companies to hedge
against them, show the ruble at 28.67 per dollar in three
months, compared with 28.4067 yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
