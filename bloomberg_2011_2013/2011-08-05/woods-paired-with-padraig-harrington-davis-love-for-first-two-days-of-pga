Tiger Woods will play alongside
Ireland’s  Padraig Harrington  and U.S. Ryder Cup captain Davis Love III for the first two rounds of next week’s  PGA
Championship .  The threesome, all former winners of golf’s final major
tournament of the year, will begin play at Atlanta Athletic Club
in Johns Creek, Georgia, at 8:35 a.m. New York time on Aug. 11.
They will tee off for round two at 1:45 p.m. the following day,
according to tee times released today by the PGA of America.  Northern Ireland’s Darren Clarke and Rory McIlroy will play
with South Africa’s Charl Schwartzel in a traditional pairing of
the winners of this year’s first three major titles. Clarke won
the British Open, McIlroy the U.S. Open and Schwartzel the
Masters Tournament.  Woods, who is making his return to golf this week at the
Bridgestone Invitational after a layoff of almost four months
due to knee and ankle injuries, captured the most recent of his
four  PGA Championship  titles in 2007. He finished 24th at
Atlanta Athletic Club in 2001.  David Toms, who edged  Phil Mickelson  with a birdie on the
final hole a decade ago to win his only major title, will be
reunited with Mickelson next week as part of a threesome with
Fiji’s  Vijay Singh , a two-time PGA winner.  To contact the reporter on this story:
