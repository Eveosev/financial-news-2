Stockholders at  News Corp. (NWSA) , the media
company under fire for a phone-hacking scandal at one of its
London newspapers, asked to meet with the company’s lead
independent director on ways to restore investor confidence.  “As long-term shareholders, we are concerned about the
future of  News Corp. (NWS) ,” Wespath Investment Management said in a
letter to Roderick Eddington dated today. “An examination of
News Corp.’s corporate governance reveals several areas of
concern, including dual chairman/CEO role, a high number of
inside or affiliated directors, and a dual share class
structure.”  The letter is from Vidette Bullock Mixon, director of
corporate relations at Glenview, Illinois-based Wespath, and
names six other institutional investors. They hold 1.11 million
Class A shares and 201,000 of the Class B voting stock. Teri
Everett, a News Corp. spokeswoman, didn’t immediately respond to
an e-mail request for comment after normal business hours.  News Corp., the New York-based owner of  Fox News  and the
Wall Street Journal, rose 11 cents to $14.67 in Nasdaq Stock
Market trading. The Class A shares are little changed this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
