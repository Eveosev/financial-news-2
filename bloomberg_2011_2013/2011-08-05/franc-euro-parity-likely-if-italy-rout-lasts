The Swiss franc may strengthen to
parity with the euro if Italian bond yields keep rising,
according to Deutsche Bank AG.  The euro-franc  exchange rate  “will carry on to parity if
European authorities cannot stabilize the Italian bond market
soon,”  Alan Ruskin , the global head of Group-of-10 currency
strategy at Deutsche Bank in New York, wrote in an e-mailed note
today.  The franc depreciated 0.9 percent to 1.08548 per euro as of
12:22 p.m. in London today, after Swiss National Bank President
Philipp Hilderbrand called its strength “absurd” and said the
bank won’t exclude “further measures” to curb its advance. The
currency appreciated to a record 1.07112 per euro earlier.  The franc has gained 15 percent against the euro this year
as investors sought a haven and European policy makers failed to
stem the two-year-old sovereign-debt crisis.  The yield on 10-year Italian bonds was recently at 6.11
percent, compared with 4.73 percent at the start of the year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
