Uganda waived taxes on imported sugar
to help reduce a shortage that resulted in retail prices more
than doubling, the New Vision reported, citing Trade Minister
Amelia Kyambadde.  The waiver was agreed at a Cabinet meeting yesterday in an
effort to contain prices that escalated to 7,000 shillings
($2.62) a kilogram (2.2 pounds) from 2,500 shillings a kilogram
earlier this year, the Kampala-based newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
