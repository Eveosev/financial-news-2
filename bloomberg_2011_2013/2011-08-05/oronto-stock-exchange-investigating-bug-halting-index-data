The Toronto Stock Exchange is
investigating a bug that has halted dissemination of index
prices twice today.  A “data feed problem” is responsible for the lack of
index prices from 9:30 a.m. to 9:40 a.m. in Toronto and again
from about 9:58 a.m. to 10 a.m., Carolyn Quick, a spokeswoman
for TSX owner  TMX Group Inc. (X) , said in an e-mail message.  The bug halted prices for the benchmark Standard &
Poor’s/TSX Composite Index as well as the S&P/TSX Smallcap
Index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
