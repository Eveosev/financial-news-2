AccessKenya (ACCESS)  Group Ltd., the country’s
only publicly traded Internet company, erased an earlier
increase that it realized after saying profit doubled in the
first half.  The stock closed trading unchanged at 6.55 shillings by 3
p.m. in the capital Nairobi, erasing an advance of as much as
2.3 percent to 6.7 shillings in intraday trading.  Profit jumped to 61.7 million shillings ($667,000) in the
six months through June 30 compared with 30.7 million shillings
a year earlier after it cut cost of sales, Access said today in
an e-mailed statement to the stock exchange.  “The trading outlook remains positive,” the company said.
“We will continue to benefit from investments in our network
and focus on growing our revenues.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
