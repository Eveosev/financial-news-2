Chile’s peso fell for a second day as
copper tumbled to a five-week low.  The peso lost 0.2 percent to 463.55 pesos per  U.S. dollar 
at 10:54 a.m. New York time, from 462.73 yesterday. The currency
has dropped 1.3 percent this week.  Chile’s peso is under pressure from the “precipitous fall
in equities and copper,” analysts from 4Cast Inc., led by  Pedro Tuesta , wrote in a note to investors. “All will depend on
whether S&P can finally bottom out.”  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index decreased 0.6 percent,
erasing gains from earlier in the day. The index plummeted 4.8
percent yesterday, the most since 2009, fueling concern the
world’s largest economy could be grinding to a halt.  Copper, which accounts for half of Chile’s exports, fell
1.2 percent on the New York Metals Exchange to the lowest since
June 28.  Chile ’s one-year interest-rate swap rate, which reflects
traders’ views of future rates, was unchanged at 5.37 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
