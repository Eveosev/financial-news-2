Mauritius’s inflation was little
changed at 6.7 percent in July as a strong currency curbed the
impact of rising commodity prices.  Inflation compared with 6.6 percent in June, the Port
Louis-based Central Statistics Office said its website today.
Prices gained 0.3 percent in the month.  “The strong rupee has helped in containing our import
bills,” Renganaden Padayachy, an economist at the Ebene-based
Mauritius Chamber of Commerce and Industry, said by phone.  Mauritius, an Indian Ocean island nation with a population
of 1.3 million people, is a net importer of fuels and food, with
67 percent of its import bill denominated in dollars, according
to Bank of Mauritius. Since the beginning of the year, the rupee
has gained 8.8 percent against the U.S. currency.  The rupee weakened 0.2 percent to 28.15 to the dollar at
10:30 a.m. in  Port Louis , according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  The average inflation rate for the past 12 months increased
to 5.5 percent in July from 5.1 percent in June, the statistics
agency said.  “The dynamics are still pointing up, which means that the
central bank will have to maintain its very prudent stand,”
Bank of Mauritius Governor Rundheersing Bheenick said in a
transcript of an interview published by l’Express newspaper on
July 29.  The central bank forecasts economic growth of 4.6 percent
this year, driven by textiles and tourism.  An increase in  interest rates  from the current 5.5 percent
is unwarranted as “priority should be given to growth,”
Padayachy said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
