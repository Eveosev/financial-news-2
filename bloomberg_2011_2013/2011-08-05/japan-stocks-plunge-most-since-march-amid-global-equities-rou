Japanese stocks plunged by the most
in more than four months, as concern the global economy is
stalling triggered an equities rout that drove the Standard &
Poor’s 500 Index to its worst slump since 2009.  Sony Corp. (6758) , which makes half of its sales in the U.S. and
 Europe , tumbled 5 percent.  Nomura Holdings Inc. (8604) , Japan’s largest
brokerage, plunged 5.4 percent to the lowest level since
February 1975.  Inpex Corp. (1605) , Japan’s biggest energy exploration
company, plummeted 6.8 percent after crude prices dropped.  “There’s enough fear out there that I think foreign
investors might start to dump Japanese stocks,” said Takashi Aoki, who helps oversee about $2.2 billion at Mizuho Asset
Management Co. in Tokyo. “Once foreign investors start to sell
in earnest, the sell-off usually continues for a while.”  The  Nikkei 225  Stock Average fell 3.7 percent to 9,299.88
at the 3 p.m. close in Tokyo, sliding the most since March 15.
All but nine stocks declined on the 225-member gauge. The
broader Topix index plunged 3.1 percent to 800.96. For the week,
the Nikkei lost 5.4 percent while the Topix index dropped 4.8
percent, the biggest weekly declines since the five-day period
following  Japan ’s March 11 earthquake.  U.S. options prices, which Mizuho Asset’s Aoki cited as a
gauge of market anxiety, soared the most in four years as
investors scrambled to buy protection against greater stock-
market losses. Following Japan’s quake, net buying by foreign
investors in 14 out 20 weeks through last week helped to limit
losses in Japanese equities.  Global Rout  In  New York  yesterday, the  S&P 500  tumbled 4.8 percent to
an eight-month low of 1,200.07, erasing its 2011 gain. The Stoxx
Europe 600 Index sank 3.5 percent to 243.16 in  London , the
biggest decline since May 2010.  “It’s a panic attack,” said Prasad Patkar, who helps
manage the equivalent of $1.7 billion at Sydney-based Platypus
Asset Management Ltd. “There was an expectation that resolution
of the U.S. debt-ceiling issue would trigger a relief rally. It
looks like everyone forgot about the weakness in the underlying
economy.”  Sony retreated 5 percent to 1,828 yen.  Toyota Motor Corp. (7203) 
sank 3.2 percent to 3,040 yen.  Canon Inc. (7751) , the world’s biggest
camera maker, dropped 3.9 percent to 3,580 yen.  European Central Bank President Jean-Claude Trichet said
policy makers will offer banks in the region additional cash to
ease tensions in financial markets.  ‘No Measures’  Trichet indicated the ECB is reluctant to shelve further
rate hikes even as investors reduce bets on the central bank
adding to its two rate moves in 2011. While acknowledging a
“particularly high” level of uncertainty, rates are still
“accommodative” and inflation risks “remain on the upside,”
he said.  “Investors are increasingly removing risk assets,” said
Hideyuki Ishiguro, assistant manager at the investment strategy
department at Okasan Securities Co. in Tokyo. “Even though the
economy is slowing and the Europe crisis persists, policy makers
in the U.S. have not taken measures.”  Brokerages fell on concern profits may drop while equities
decline globally. Nomura plunged 5.4 percent to 349 yen, the
lowest close in 36 years.  Daiwa Securities Group Inc. (8601) , Japan’s
second biggest brokerage, lost 3.6 percent to 321 yen.  The rout in equities followed yesterday’s yen sales by the
Japanese government to stem currency gains that threaten the
nation’s economic recovery. The yen appreciated to as high as
78.43 against the dollar today, compared with 79.41 at the close
of  stock trading  in Tokyo yesterday. Against the euro, Japan’s
currency strengthened to 110.71 from 113.30. A stronger yen cuts
the value of overseas sales for Japan’s exporters.  U.S. Jobs  The U.S. Labor Department said yesterday that initial
claims for unemployment insurance payments fell last week to a
level that shows limited improvement in the labor market of the
world’s biggest economy. Applications for jobless benefits
dropped 1,000 in the week ended July 30 to 400,000, the fewest
in almost four months.  Employers probably added 85,000 jobs in July, economists
project a Labor Department report will show today. That increase
may not be enough to reduce an  unemployment rate  that’s holding
above 9 percent, they forecast.  Inpex plummeted 6.8 percent to 533,000 yen, the most since
July 2010.  Mitsubishi Corp. (8058) , Japan’s No. 1 trading company,
slumped 2.9 percent to 1,932 yen. Mitsui & Co., Japan’s second-
largest trading company, declined 3 percent to 1,349 yen.  Crude oil for September delivery fell 5.8 percent to $86.63
a barrel in New York yesterday, the lowest settlement since Feb.
18, amid intensifying concern the global economy is slowing. The
London Metal Exchange Index of prices for six industrial metals
including copper and aluminum slid 1.9 percent.  Toyobo Co., a textile maker, was among eight stocks
advancing on the Nikkei 225. The stock gained 1.7 percent to 117
yen, after the company raised its full-year profit forecast 29
percent. Toyobo said sales declines due to March’s earthquake
were limited to products for cars and that a recovery in the
 auto industry  is likely in the second quarter, according to a
statement to the  Tokyo  Stock Exchange.  To contact the reporters on this story:
