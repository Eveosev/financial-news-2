The European Bank for Reconstruction
and Development and a syndicate of international commercial
banks will lend 80 million euros ($113.13 million) to  Serbia ’s
leading agribusiness operator to expand output and save energy.  The lending, split in half between the EBRD and foreign
commercial lenders, will help  MK Group  and “its trading arm MK
Commerce to build up their farming operations,” the EBRD said
in an e-mail today, without naming partner banks.  Of the total, 10 million euros will finance “an equipment
upgrade” at Sunoko d.o.o., a local sugar producer controlled by
MK Group and member of  Germany ’s Nordzucker Gmbh & Co KG,
resulting in lower carbon-dioxide emissions and thermal
consumption, it added.  Agriculture accounts for one fifth of the Serbian economic
output and the EBRD’s loan to MK Group marks an effort to ease
liquidity problems the sector shared with other industries as
the Balkan nation strives to recover from a slowing economy
triggered by global recession.  “The investment will provide MK Group with a stable
financing platform and funds for energy efficiency measures. The
project will also contribute to greater productivity in the
Serbian farming sector, enhancing competition and setting higher
environmental standards,” the statement said, citing Gilles
Mettetal, the EBRD’s Director for Agribusiness.  To contact the reporter on this story:
