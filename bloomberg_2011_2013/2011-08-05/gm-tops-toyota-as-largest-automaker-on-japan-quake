General Motors Co. (GM)  outsold  Toyota
Motor Corp. (7203)  globally in the first six months to become the
world’s largest automaker after the record March earthquake
disrupted production in  Japan .  GM sales rose 8.9 percent to 4.536 million units in the
half-year ended June 30, the Detroit-based automaker said in a
 statement  yesterday. That compares with 4.13 million units at
second-ranked  Volkswagen AG (VOW)  and 3.71 million units for Toyota,
including its luxury Lexus marque and affiliates Daihatsu Motor
Co. and  Hino Motors Ltd. (7205) , according to statements by the
companies.  Output at the Toyota City, Japan-based automaker slumped 23
percent to 3.37 million units in the half-year after the company
halted production following the magnitude-9 temblor and tsunami
in March. Toyota expects to enter a production recovery phase in
September, one month earlier than previously announced, it said
Aug. 2.  “Even if Toyota recovers production, it will take another
few more months for sales to actually recover” as it takes time
to deliver vehicles to dealers, said Takeshi Miyao, an analyst
at consulting company Carnorama in  Tokyo . “Toyota’s sales may
trail behind Volkswagen in the full-year as well.”  GM’s U.S. sales climbed to 669,065 vehicles in the second
quarter, according to industry researcher Autodata Corp. The
Chevrolet Cruze was the top-selling car in the market in June
and the Chevy Silverado full-size pickup remained the second-
most popular vehicle, behind only Ford Motor Co.’s F-Series line.  Hyundai Motor Co. (005380) ,  South Korea ’s largest automaker, had a
11 percent jump in first-half deliveries of 1.96 million units.  Toyota shares fell 3.8 percent to 3,020 yen as of the 11:30
a.m. trading break in Tokyo. The benchmark Nikkei 225 Stock
Average declined 3.4 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
