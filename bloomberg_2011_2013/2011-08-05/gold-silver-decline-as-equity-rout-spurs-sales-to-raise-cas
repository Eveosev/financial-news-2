Gold fell for the second straight day
on sales by some investors to cover losses in other markets.
Silver slumped, capping the biggest weekly drop in three months.  U.S. equities, which erased earlier losses today, headed
for the biggest weekly decline since March 2009. Yesterday, gold
rose to a record $1,684.90 an ounce as global economic concerns
and the sovereign-debt crisis in the U.S. and  Europe  sent yields
on two-year Treasuries to a record low.  “It’s a volatile period for gold,”  Adam Klopfenstein , a
senior strategist at MF Global Holdings Ltd. in  Chicago , said in
a telephone interview. “You would think that people would buy
gold as a haven now, but they’re selling it because they need to
raise cash.”  Gold futures for December delivery fell $7.20, or 0.4
percent, to settle at $1,651.80 at 1:45 p.m. on the Comex in  New
York . Earlier, the metal rose as much as 0.8 percent.  This week, the  price climbed 1.3 percent, the fifth
straight gain. The commodity has gained 38 percent in the past
year as nations hampered with debt and sluggish economies were
forced to keep borrowing rates low.  Dennis Gartman , an economist and the editor of the Suffolk,
Virginia-based Gartman Letter, recommended that clients cut
their gold positions by half.  “Given the circumstances prevailing in a world that shall
put a premium high upon liquidity, we think it is wise to
liquidate our gold holdings ahead of everyone else,” Gartman
said in the report. “The highs seen yesterday shall not be
taken out for quite some long while.”  Silver Slides  Silver futures for September delivery tumbled $1.22, or 3.1
percent, to $38.211 an ounce on the Comex, capping a two-day
slump of 8.5 percent. This week, the metal dropped 4.7 percent,
the most since early May.  Palladium futures for September delivery fell $11.20, or
1.5 percent, to $741.75 an ounce on the  New York Mercantile
