Argentina  canceled an offer to
exchange about $340 million of defaulted Brady bonds after a
U.S. Court of Appeals decision meant the conditions of the swap
couldn’t be met.  The swap involved $263 million in dollar-denominated bonds
and 54 million euros ($77 million) of bonds, all due in 2023,
the country said in a statement released by Bondholder
Communications Group LLC, which said it’s acting as the
information, exchange and tabulation agent for the offer.  “An embargo of the assets of these bonds had been
requested by vulture funds, so the swap depended on the result
of the court decision on that,” Argentina’s Finance Secretary
Hernan Lorenzino told reporters today in Buenos Aires. “This
creates a situation of conflict between bondholders.”  In December, Economy Minister  Amado Boudou  said that the
offer to exchange $335 million in those bonds was accepted by
80.7 percent of creditors. The exchange followed a debt
restructuring of $12.9 billion in mid-2010 of bonds that
remained out from a 2005 swap. Argentina defaulted on $95
billion in late 2001.  The 2023 bonds were issued under the so-called Brady Plan
in which 21 developing countries, including Poland,  Brazil  and
the Philippines, restructured foreign debt they defaulted on
after the  Federal Reserve  drove up U.S. interest rates in the
1980s. Argentina issued about $30 billion worth of Brady bonds.  The extra yield investors demand to hold Argentine bonds
instead of U.S. Treasuries rose 24 basis points, or 0.24
percentage point, to 673 as of 1:37 p.m. New York time.  To contact the reporter on this story:
