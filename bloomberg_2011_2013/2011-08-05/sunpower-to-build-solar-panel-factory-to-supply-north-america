SunPower Corp. (SPWRA) , a U.S. solar-panel
maker majority owned by French oil company  Total SA (FP) , will build
and operate a factory in Mexicali, Mexico, to meet demand from a
growing North American solar market.  SunPower will lease a 320,000 square-foot (29,729 square-
meter) building to make panels for residential, commercial and
utility-scale projects as well as solar roof tiles, the San
Jose, California-based company said today in a statement. The
output and cost of the plant werenâ€™t disclosed.  In the last year, SunPower has increased capacity at its
Fab 3 plant in Malaysia, opened a factory in Silicon Valley,
California, and expanded a facility in Europe to meet global
demand, it said. New solar installations are expected to reach
about 24 gigawatts this year compared with 18 gigawatts in 2010,
according to Bloomberg New Energy Finance estimates.  To contact the reporter on this story:
