German stocks tumbled for an eighth
day, the longest losing streak since 1993, after a better-than-
forecast U.S. jobs report failed to allay investor concern that
the global economic recovery may falter.  Companies from  Daimler AG (DAI)  and  Volkswagen AG (VOW)  to  ThyssenKrupp
AG (TKA)  and  BASF SE (BAS)  fell by more than 3 percent in Frankfurt trading.
 Allianz SE (ALV)  dropped 4.4 percent as Europe’s biggest insurer
reported profit that missed analyst estimates.  The benchmark  DAX Index (DAX)  slid 2.8 percent to 6,236.16 at
5:30 p.m. in Frankfurt, extending this week’s selloff to 13
percent, the biggest five-day decline since 2008. The gauge has
lost 17 percent from this year’s high on May 2 amid speculation
Europe will fail to contain its sovereign-debt crisis as U.S.
growth falters. The HDAX Index lost 2.4 percent today.  “This week has seen some of the heaviest falls for global
indices since the heights of the credit crisis,” said Sean Power, an equity analyst at  City Index  in  London . “With well-
entrenched concerns over growth in the U.S., European and
emerging-market economies, investors are unwilling to carry risk
in case the situation worsens next week.”  The DAX recouped some losses after U.S. employers added
more jobs than forecast in July, the jobless rate fell and wages
climbed. Payrolls rose by 117,000 workers after a 46,000
increase in June, the Labor Department said today in  Washington .
The median estimate in a Bloomberg News survey called for a July
gain of 85,000.  In Germany, industrial production unexpectedly fell in June
as construction activity waned and investment-goods output
retreated.  Global Rout  Global stocks yesterday had their biggest one-day rout
since March 2009, wiping off more than $4.4 trillion from
equity-market value worldwide since July 26 as concern mounted
that the  U.S. economy  is weakening.  Daimler, owner of the Mercedes-Benz luxury-vehicle brand,
lost 4.3 percent to 41.97 euros today, while Volkswagen,
 Europe ’s largest carmaker, slid 4.5 percent to 115.9 euros.
ThyssenKrupp, Germany’s biggest steelmaker, retreated 3.9
percent to 24.6 euros, for a ninth day of declines. BASF, the
world’s biggest chemical company, retreated 4.7 percent to 53.99
euros.  Allianz slid 4.5 percent to 79.10 euros. The insurer
reported an 8.2 percent decline in second-quarter profit to 1
billion euros ($1.42 billion), which missed the average analyst
estimate of 1.28 billion euros in a Bloomberg survey. The
company also wrote down its Greek debt holdings by 326 million
euros at the end of June.  To contact the reporter on this story:
