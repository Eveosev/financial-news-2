OAO Rosneft,  Russia â€™s largest oil
producer, fell to its lowest since December after oil plunged in
 New York  on speculation fuel demand will falter as the global
economic recovery stalls.  The shares fell as much 4.4 percent to 215 rubles, their
weakest since Dec. 17 and traded 2.2 percent lower at 219.92
rubles as of 12:53 p.m. in Moscow.  Crude for September delivery dropped as much as $3.76 to
$82.87 a barrel in New York.  To contact the reporter on this story:
