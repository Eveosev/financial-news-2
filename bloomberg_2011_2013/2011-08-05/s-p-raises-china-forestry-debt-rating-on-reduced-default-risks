China Forestry Holdings Co., the
timber supply company partly owned by the  Carlyle Group , had its
 credit rating  raised by  Standard & Poor’s  Ratings after it
bought back some of its debt.  S&P increased China Forestry’s rating one level to CCC-,
according to a statement today. It has a “negative outlook” on
the company’s ratings.  The timber company proposed to buy back as much as $120
million outstanding on its 7.75 percent notes due November 2015,
according to a statement to Hong Kong’s stock exchange on July
15. Potentially faster repayments of its notes will reduce the
risk of default in the next six months, Standard & Poor’s said.  Still, the timber company’s cash balance will reduce
significantly following the partial redemption, and its
“financial strength and business sustainability to remain
vulnerable in the next year,” S&P said, citing the uncertain
quality of the company’s forest assets and future logging
permits.  China Forestry will report a first-half net loss because of
“irregularities” in its financial statements and interest
expenses, according to a July 13 stock exchange filing. The
company reported first-half net income of 429 million yuan ($66
million) in the previous corresponding period.  China Forestry shares in  Hong Kong  have been suspended
since Jan. 26, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  930 HK <Equity> CN BN  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
