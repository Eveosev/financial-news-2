Kenya Electricity Transmission Co. 
plans to construct a new power transmission line and sub
stations worth 22.5 billion shillings ($244 million) in the
capital Nairobi to stabilize supply, Business Daily said today.  The first of two phases of the project, which is being
funded by the  European Investment Bank  and the  African
Development Bank , are expected to begin next year and will
reduce power outages in the city, the Nairobi-based newspaper
said citing Chief Executive Officer Joel Kiilu.  Companies have until Feb. 18 to express an  interest in the
project, it said. The power lines will cover a distance of 403
kilometers (250 miles), the state-owned power-grid operator
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
