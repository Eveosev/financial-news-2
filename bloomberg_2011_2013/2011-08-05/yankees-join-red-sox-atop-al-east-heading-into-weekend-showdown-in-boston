The  New York Yankees  won their
seventh straight game to join the  Boston Red Sox  atop the
American League East Division heading into their weekend series.  Both teams have 68-42 records, tied for best in the league.
No other AL team has fewer than 50 losses this season. Tampa Bay
is third in the AL East, 10 games behind the leaders.  Itâ€™s the first time since July 6 that the Yankees have held
at least a share of first place in the division.  The Yankees won 7-2 last night at the Chicago White Sox.
The Red Sox, who host the three-game Major League Baseball
series against the Yankees starting tonight at Fenway Park, lost
7-3 against the visiting Cleveland Indians.  To contact the reporter on this story:
