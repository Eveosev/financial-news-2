U.S. options prices swung between
gains and losses after a report showing faster-than-expected job
growth failed to eliminate speculation that the world’s largest
economy could slip into recession.  The VIX, as the Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility
Index is known, fell 1.2 percent to 31.29 at 10:37 a.m. in New
York.  The benchmark gauge for U.S. stock options fell as much as
13 percent after a U.S. report showed payrolls rose by 117,000
workers in July, the Labor Department said, beating the 85,000
median economist estimate. The jobless rate dropped to 9.1
percent as more Americans left the  labor force . The VIX then
rose as much as 3.2 percent.  “Risk is going crazy, blowing up completely,” said Daniel
Hawkins, director and founder of Mariana Capital Markets Ltd., a
London-based brokerage firm specializing in equity derivatives
in a telephone interview. “People are very scared of what’s
going on. Everyone is trying to buy protection in the options
market. It feels like 2008.”  The VIX jumped 35 percent yesterday, the most since
February 2007, as investors scrambled to buy protection against
greater stock-market losses as worsening economic data sent
stocks to the largest losing streak since the  bull market  began.
It closed at 31.66, the highest level since July 2010.  To contact the reporter on this story:
