Polandâ€™s zloty weakened to a record
low against the Swiss franc as concern the global economic
recovery is faltering prompted investors to sell riskier assets.  The zloty depreciated as much as 1.4 percent to 3.7659 per
franc, its weakest intraday level since Bloomberg started
tracking the data in 1998, and traded down 0.7 percent to 3.7392
as of 5:05 p.m. in Warsaw. Against the euro, the Polish currency
was 0.4 percent weaker at 4.0437.  Global stocks and commodities plunged and most emerging-
market currencies weakened as report showing the U.S. added more
jobs than expected failed to ease concern the global economy is
struggling.  To contact the reporter on this story:
