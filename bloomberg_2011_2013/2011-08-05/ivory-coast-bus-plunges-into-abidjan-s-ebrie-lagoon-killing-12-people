The number of people killed in  Ivory
Coast  after a bus plunged off a bridge that spans the Ebrie
lagoon in Abidjan climbed to 47, with another 9 people in
hospital with injuries, according to a rescue official.  Three people survived without injuries and the recovery of
victims has been halted, said General Kili Fiacre, head of the
National Union of Civil Protection and the person in charge of
the rescue team.  “We don’t think there are any more people killed or
injured,” Fiacre said by phone from the commercial capital. “The
bus was half full,” he said, adding that the cause of the
accident will be investigated. It damaged part of the Felix Houphouet Boigny bridge, one of two that crosses the lagoon,
Fiacre said.  Africa accounts for about 20 percent of the world’s road-
traffic deaths, yet has just 2 percent of the world’s cars,
according to the  World Health Organization . About 643 people are
killed each day in traffic accidents on the continent, the
Geneva-based organization said on its website.  Ivorian President  Alassane Ouattara  visited the site of the
crash and declared three days of national mourning, according to
an e-mailed statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
