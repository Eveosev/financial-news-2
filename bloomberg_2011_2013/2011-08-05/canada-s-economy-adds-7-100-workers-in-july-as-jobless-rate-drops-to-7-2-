Canadian employers slowed their pace
of  job creation , cut back on wage increases and reduced
purchases last month, data released today show, adding to
evidence the country’s recovery is waning.  Employment rose by 7,100 on a seasonally adjusted basis,
Statistics  Canada  said today in Ottawa, less than the 15,000
median estimate in a Bloomberg News survey of 27 economists and
down from an average 36,300 over the prior three months. The
annual increase in hourly wages also decelerated in July to its
slowest since 2003, the agency said.  The report suggests Canada’s labor market may be softening,
after the country led the Group of Seven countries in recouping
employment lost during the global recession. Canada has added
about 25,000 jobs on average each month since August 2009, as
the economy benefited from rising prices for commodities and a
buoyant real estate market propelled by low borrowing costs.  “The real concern is the ongoing reduction in the wage
growth,” said  Derek Holt , vice-president economics with  Scotia
Capital  in Toronto. “It remains bearish for consumption going
forward.”  In a separate report, the  University of Western Ontario ’s
business school said its Ivey purchasing managers’ index fell to
46.8 in July, a six-month low, from 59.9 a month earlier.  Readings greater than 50 indicate purchasing by governments
and companies advanced. Economists surveyed by Bloomberg
predicted a reading of 61, the median of 9 forecasts.  Clouding the Outlook  Europe ’s sovereign debt crisis and a growing risk of a new
recession in the U.S. are clouding the longer-term Canadian
employment outlook, said  Paul Ferley , assistant chief economist
at RBC Economics.  “The issue is sustainability. If the external problems
deepen, it could get to the point where it will jeopardize our
expansion and start pushing the  unemployment rate  higher,”
Ferley said by a telephone from Toronto.  Canada’s gross domestic product fell by 0.3 percent in May,
the most in two years, on temporary disruptions in the mining
and oil and gas industries, Statistics Canada said July 29.  The  Bank of Canada  said July 20 the economy’s growth
probably slowed to a 1.5 percent annual pace in the second
quarter, the slowest rate since the country emerged from
recession in 2009, amid a weak global recovery. Governor Mark Carney has kept the central bank’s benchmark policy rate at 1
percent since September.  Average hourly wages rose 1.4 percent in July from a year
ago, down from 2 percent in the previous month, to reach the
slowest annual pace since June 2003,  Statistics Canada  said.  Dollar Weakens  The Canadian dollar swung between gains and losses, rising
0.4 percent to 97.75 cents per  U.S. dollar  at 1:23 p.m. in
Toronto. Bonds fell, with yields on 2-year  government bonds 
gaining five basis points to 1.07 percent.  Job cuts by governments, which have been curtailing
stimulus measures, offset employment gains in construction and
transportation, Statistics Canada said. The economy created
94,500 private sector jobs during the month, led by a gain of
30,800 in construction employment. Retail and wholesale
increased by 27,500 jobs, while transportation and warehousing
businesses added 27,700 workers.  Public-sector employment declined by 71,500 in the month
and the number of self-employed workers dropped by 15,900, the
agency said.  Schools fired 30,000 employees in July. The statistics
agency said that while there have been movements in summer
educational employment in recent years, there hasn’t been a
consistent pattern over that time.  Ferley said the Canadian job market, though, remains
stronger than it appears in the July report, since the decline
in education employment is likely a seasonal phenomenon that
will be reversed once schools re-hire staff in the next few
months.  Full-time employment rose by 25,500 during July while part-
time jobs dropped by 18,400, the report said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
