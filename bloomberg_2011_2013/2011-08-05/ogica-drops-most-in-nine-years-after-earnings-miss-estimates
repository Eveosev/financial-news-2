Logica Plc (LOG) , the Anglo-Dutch computer
services provider, fell as much as 20 percent in  London  trading
after reporting first-half earnings that missed analyst
estimates.  Logica declined as much as 20.6 pence to 82.3 pence, the
biggest intraday drop in nine years. It was trading down 13
percent at 89.5 pence at 9:39 a.m. in London, where the company
is based.  Net income declined 14 percent to 58.4 million pounds in the
first half on cost-cutting by government customers in the
Netherlands, the company said in a statement. That missed the
62.4 million-pound average estimate of analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg. The company said it expects adjusted operating profit
at constant currency for the full year to exceed that of last
year because of sales growth.  “Margin improvement is now dependent on progress in
Benelux,” Chief Executive Officer Andy Green said in the
statement, referring to  Belgium , the Netherlands and Luxembourg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
