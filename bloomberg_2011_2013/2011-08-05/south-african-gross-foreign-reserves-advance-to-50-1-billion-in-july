South African reserves rose for the
first month in three in July as gold prices soared and the
central bank bought more foreign currency to curb the rand’s
strength.  Gross gold and foreign currency reserves increased 0.1
percent to $50.1 billion last month, the Pretoria-based  Reserve
Bank  said on its website today. Net reserves increased to $47.9
billion from $47.2 billion.  The spot price of gold climbed 8.5 percent last month,
reaching as high as $1,627.88 an ounce in  London  on July 29. The
Reserve Bank purchased $480 million of foreign currency through
swap transactions in the month to crimp the rand’s gain to 1.1
percent against the dollar.  “July’s market purchases exceeded market expectations,”
 Michael Keenan , an analyst at Standard Bank Group Ltd. in
Johannesburg, said in a note to clients. “Given the rand’s
robust appreciation against the dollar towards the end of July,
it is hardly surprising that the Reserve Bank was a more active
buyer this month.”  The rand has slumped 2.8 percent against the dollar this
month on concerns global economic growth is weakening. The
currency was at 6.9328 to the U.S. currency as of 9:34 a.m. in
Johannesburg from 6.9249 before the data was released.  Building reserves has come at a cost to the central bank,
which posted a loss for a second consecutive year of 1.17
billion rand ($169 million) in the 12 months through March. The
bank pays more in interest on local-currency debt than it earns
on holding foreign currency assets.  The median estimate of seven economists surveyed by
Bloomberg was for gross reserves to climb to $50.4 billion.  To contact the reporter on this story:
