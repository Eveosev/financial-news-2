Volkswagen AG (VOW)  and  Suzuki Motor Corp. (7269) 
will terminate their partnership, the  Platow Brief  newsletter
reported today, citing differences between the carmakers over
leadership roles.  Platow didn’t say where it obtained the information.  Volkswagen’s interim chief spokesman, Stephan Gruehsem,
didn’t immediately respond to a message left on his mobile phone
late today seeking comment on the Platow report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
