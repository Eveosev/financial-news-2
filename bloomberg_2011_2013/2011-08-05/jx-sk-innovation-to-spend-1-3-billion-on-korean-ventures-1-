SK Innovation Co. and  JX Holdings Inc. (5020)  
agreed to jointly invest 1.35 trillion won ($1.3 billion) in
petrochemical and lubricant ventures to meet rising Asian demand.  The companies will build a 1 trillion-won plant in Ulsan,
South Korea, capable of making 1 million metric tons of
paraxylene annually, according to statements by SK and JX. A
second venture will invest 350 billion won in a lubricant plant.  SK and its rivals including Hyundai Oilbank Co. and  S-Oil
Corp. (010950)  are boosting their petrochemical output capacity as growth
in demand for synthetic fibers from  China , South Korea’s largest
market, and India outpaces supply increases. A venture between
Hyundai Oilbank and Japan’s Cosmo Oil Co. is planning a plant
capable of producing 800,000 tons a year of paraxylene, used to
make polyester fibers.  JX and SK aim to start commercial production at the
paraxylene plant in 2014, with construction of the project
scheduled to begin in the third quarter of this year, according
to  South Korea ’s largest oil refiner. The lubricant plant, with
a capacity of 26,000 barrels a year, will begin operations in
the second half of next year, SK said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
