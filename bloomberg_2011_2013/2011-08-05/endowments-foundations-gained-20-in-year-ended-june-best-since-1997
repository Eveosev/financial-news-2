Endowments and foundations gained an
average of 20 percent in the year ended June 30, their best
performance in 14 years, according to consultant Wilshire
Associates Inc.  The non-profits lagged behind the 31 percent increase,
including dividends, of the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index over the
same period. In the past year, endowments and foundations on
average had about 55 percent of their portfolios allocated to
stocks, 22 percent to bonds and 2.4 percent to cash, according
to  Santa Monica , California, based Wilshire.  Endowments lost a record 19 percent in the year ended June
2009 after the September 2008 bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers
Holdings Inc. crippled financial markets, according to Wilshire.
That prompted hundreds of layoffs, construction delays,
discounted sales of illiquid investments and debt issuance.
Investments at the two wealthiest U.S. schools,  Harvard
University  in Cambridge, Massachusetts, and  Yale University , in
New Haven, Connecticut, declined a record 27 percent and 25
percent respectively.  The following year, the endowments rebounded, gaining 12
percent, Wilshire research shows, compared with a 14 percent
increase in the S&P total return. This past period’s gain of
19.9 percent was the best since the 20.3 percent gain of 1997,
said Kim Shepherd, a Wilshire spokeswoman.  Individual U.S. endowments usually report their figures
from September. For the fiscal year ended June 30, the
 California Public Employees’ Retirement System , the nation’s
largest pension fund, said it gained 21 percent, and the
California teachers program, the second-largest  pension plan , 23
percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
