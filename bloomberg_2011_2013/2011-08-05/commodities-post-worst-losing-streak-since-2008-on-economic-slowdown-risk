Commodities declined for an eighth
day, the longest losing streak since December 2008, and erased
their gains for the year as concern deepened that the global
economic slowdown will reduce demand for raw materials.  The Standard & Poor’s GSCI Spot Index of 24 commodities
lost as much as 2.6 percent to 628.11, the lowest since January,
and was at 643.92 by 12:38 p.m in  London . The gauge headed for a
weekly loss of 6.1 percent, the worst since May. Zinc led the
drop, sliding as much as 4.3 percent in London. Oil fell as much
as 4.3 percent in  New York  and was set for its biggest weekly
loss in three months. Copper fell to the lowest since June and
gold gained 1.1 percent.  “The game is now one of liquidation,”  Dennis Gartman , the
economist who correctly forecast 2008’s commodities slump, said
in his daily Gartman Letter today. “Liquidate first and ask
questions later are the orders of the day.”  U.S. consumer confidence slid last week to the lowest level
in more than two months, a report showed yesterday. More than
$4.4 trillion has been cut from equity market values in a seven-
day sell-off that drove the MSCI All-Country World Index down
more than 10 percent from this year’s high. The U.S. added
85,000 jobs last month, leaving the 9.2 percent unemployment
rate unchanged, said economists surveyed before data today that
cap a week of reports showing the U.S. recovery is slowing.  Industrial production in  Germany  unexpectedly decreased in
June, declining 1.1 percent from May led by drops in
construction output and in investment goods such as machinery,
the  Economy Ministry  said today. Economists had forecast a gain
of 0.1 percent.  Crude, Copper  Crude oil for September delivery dropped 0.4 percent to
$86.29 a barrel on the  New York Mercantile Exchange  after
slumping to $82.87, the lowest level for the most active
contract since November. The price fell 5.8 percent yesterday.  Gold for immediate delivery increased 1.1 percent to
$1,664.30 an ounce. Bullion, which touched a record $1,681.72
yesterday, is up 2.2 percent this week, set for the longest run
of weekly advances since the five weeks to March 4.  “Gold is supported on many fronts and we remain bullish,”
said Yang Shandan, a trader at Cinda Futures Co. “There’s fear
spreading across all markets,” said Yang, ranked second in a
Futures Daily and Securities Times poll of China gold analysts.  Copper for delivery in three months fell as much as 2.3
percent to $9,143 a ton, the lowest intraday price since June
29, and a 10 percent plunge from its record $10,190 a ton in
February. The metal traded at $9,199.75 a ton and has been
supported by a strike at BHP Billiton Ltd.’s Escondida copper
mine in  Chile . The workers at the mine, the world’s largest,
voted for a package of benefits to end a strike at the world’s
biggest copper mine as soon as today.  Wheat for December delivery dropped as much as 2.1 percent
to $7.10 a bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade before trading
at $7.1825. Corn for December delivery declined 0.9 percent to
$6.9525 a bushel after falling 1.6 percent yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
