S&B Industrial Minerals SA (ARBA) , a Greek
minerals company, said first-half profit almost doubled as
global demand for steel and industrial production in Europe and
the U.S. boosted sales.  Net income climbed to 10.4 million euros ($14.7 million)
from 5.6 million euros in the same period a year earlier,
according to an  Athens  bourse  filing . Sales rose 13 percent to
229.8 million euros.  The company manufactures and trades industrial minerals and
ores for the steel, metallurgy and construction markets. About
60 percent of S&B’s operations relate to steel production, which
has “performed very well” in the last six months, Chief
Executive Officer Kriton Anavlavis said in a telephone interview
today.  “We’ve come out of a sequence of very positive quarters
but we are aware of what might come and we are ready to address
any adverse impact,” he said. “We continuously look at our
costs. What concerns us now is the raw material increases.”  Such increases can be passed on to customers, the CEO said.
“I believe we are in a good position to continue doing that
even in an adverse environment,” Anavlavis said.  Athens-based S&B primarily focuses on  Europe , the U.S. and
developing economies including Brazil,  China  and India.  To contact the reporter on this story:
