Asian stocks tumbled the most in
almost three years this week, with the regional benchmark index
also falling 10 percent from its May peak on concern a global
economic recovery is weakening.  Sony Corp. (6758) , a Japanese consumer-electronics maker that gets
more than a third of its revenue from the U.S. and  Europe , sank
6.1 percent in  Tokyo  even after the Japanese government
intervened in the foreign exchange market to stem the yen’s
gains.  BHP Billiton Ltd. (BHP) , the world’s biggest miner, plunged 8
percent, leading commodity stocks lower on concern demand will
weaken. Hanjin Shipping Co. tumbled 17 percent in Seoul.  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index tumbled 7.8 percent to 126.08
this week for its biggest weekly loss since October 2008. The
gauge this week dropped more than 10 percent from its May 2 high
this year, a decline that some investors define as a correction.
Shares fell on four out of the five trading days this week,
climbing only on Aug. 1 after U.S. President Barack Obama said
congressional leaders reached an agreement to raise the nation’s
debt ceiling and cut the federal deficit.  “It’s a panic attack from fear that growth is dropping off
a cliff,” said Prasad Patkar, who helps manage the equivalent
of $1.7 billion at Sydney-based Platypus Asset Management Ltd.
“There was an expectation that resolution of the U.S. debt-
ceiling issue would trigger a relief rally. It looks like
everyone forgot about the weakness in the underlying economy.”  Nikkei, Hang Seng  Japan ’s  Nikkei 225 (NKY)  Stock Average sank 5.4 percent for the
week even as the yen weakened against the dollar after the
government stepped in to sell its currency. South Korea’s Kospi
index tumbled 8.9 percent.  Hong Kong ’s Hang Seng Index slumped
6.7 percent and  China ’s Shanghai Composite Index dropped 2.8
percent.  Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 Index plunged 7.2 percent as the
 Reserve Bank  of Australia slashed its 2011 economic growth
forecast to 2 percent from its previous estimate of 3.25 percent.
The gauge has lost more than 17 percent from its April 11 high
this year, nearing the 20-percent-level that some investors call
a bear market.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index tumbled 4.8 percent in  New
York  on Aug. 4, its biggest decline since February 2009. The
measure’s slide this week erased its gain for the year, while
the Stoxx Europe 600 Index dropped 9.9 percent through the week
as concern the global economy is weakening prompted a global
rout.  Quantitative Easing  Shares fell even as speculation grew that the U.S. Federal
Reserve will start a third round of quantitative easing, or
“QE3,” after U.S. data in the past week showed manufacturing
grew at the weakest pace in two years, spending unexpectedly
fell and service industries grew at the slowest pace since
February 2010. The second round of bond purchases ended in June.  “Everyone’s rushing for the exit at one time,” said Chris Weston, an institutional dealer at IG Markets in Melbourne.
“People are saying they’re not bothered about returns any more,
they just want to make sure their money’s safe. There’s really
no place to hide at the moment. In this kind of market, the
investment case for equities is extremely low.”  Sony slumped 6.1 percent to 1,828 yen in Tokyo.  Toyota
Motor Corp. (7203) , the world’s biggest carmaker, lost 3.7 percent to
3,040 yen. Samsung Electronics Co., the South Korean television
maker that reports “America’ as its second-largest market for
sales, slid 6.5 percent to 789,000 won in Seoul.  Li & Fung Ltd. (494) , the biggest supplier of toys and clothes to
retailers including Wal-Mart Stores Inc. and Target Corp.,
plunged 7.1 percent to HK$12.04 in Hong Kong. In Sydney,  Qantas
Airways Ltd. (QAN) , Australia’s biggest carrier, sank 8.4 percent to
A$1.69.  National Australia Bank Ltd. (NAB)  declined 9.3 percent to
A$21.77.  Global Recovery  Concern the global recovery may be derailed drove investors
out of stocks this week and into the relative safety of
Treasuries, the Swiss franc and yen. Japan’s moves to sell the
currency, which this week neared a post-World War II record, and
expand an asset-purchase fund followed efforts by the Swiss
central bank to curb the franc’s gains.  The  European Central Bank  resumed bond purchases and
offered banks more cash to stem the spread of the debt crisis
after the yield on Italian and Spanish bonds surged to records
amid speculation Europe will fail to contain its sovereign-debt
crisis.  Gauges of raw material producers and energy companies led
declines among the 10 industry groups tracked on the MSCI Asia
Pacific Index after commodity prices slumped. Crude oil in New
York fell 9.2 percent this week, while a measure of primary
metals traded in  London  slid 8.9 percent.  BHP, Rio  BHP dropped 8 percent to A$38.12 in Sydney. Rival Rio Tinto
Group, the world’s second-largest mining company by sales, fell
10 percent to A$72.  Cnooc Ltd. (883) , China’s biggest offshore oil
producer, slid 11 percent to HK$15.54 in Hong Kong.  Woodside Petroleum Ltd. (WPL) , Australia’s second-biggest oil and
gas producer, lost 9.9 percent to A$34.55. In Wellington,  New
Zealand Oil & Gas Ltd. (NZO) , that nation’s biggest publicly traded
explorer, retreated 2.9 percent to 66 New Zealand cents.  “The latest weakness in stocks is the product of global
investors coming to the conclusion that global growth is no
longer getting incrementally better and may even get worse,”
said  Angus Gluskie , who manages about $350 million at White
Funds Management in Sydney. “The moves this week reflect the
mental capitulation of investors from hope to pessimism, and
each day’s fall is only reinforcing the negative outlook.”  Shipping Companies  Hanjin Shipping, South Korea’s third-biggest shipping line
by market value, tumbled 17 percent to 17,550 won.  Cosco Pacific
Ltd. (1199) , a shipping-container terminal operator that is part of
China’s largest shipping group, plunged 19 percent to HK$10.22.  Stocks tumbled even as corporate earnings showed signs of
improving. Of the 402 companies in the MSCI Asia Pacific Index
that reported net income from July 11 through 7:15 p.m. in Hong
Kong on Aug. 5, 176 beat analyst estimates, while 132 fell short,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index lost 8.4 percent this year
through yesterday, compared with drops of 4.6 percent by the S&P
500 and 13.4 percent by the Stoxx Europe 600 Index. Stocks in
the Asian benchmark were valued at 12.7 times estimated earnings
on average, compared with 12.0 times for the S&P 500 and 9.8
times for the Stoxx 600.
        Konami Corp. (9766) , a video-game developer, climbed 15 percent
to 2,335 yen in Tokyo after saying net income in the quarter
ended June 30 more than tripled.  Nippon Paper Group Inc. (3893) , Japan’s second-biggest papermaker
by revenue, rose 6.6 percent to 1,834 yen. Nomura Holdings Inc.
boosted its investment rating to “buy” from “neutral,”
saying a restructuring plan and higher paper prices will likely
improve earnings in two to three years.  To contact the reporters on this story:
