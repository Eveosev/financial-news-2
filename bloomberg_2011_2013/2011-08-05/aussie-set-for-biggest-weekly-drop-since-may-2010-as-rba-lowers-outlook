The Australian dollar had the biggest
weekly fall against its U.S. counterpart since May 2010 after
the  Reserve Bank  of Australia lowered its forecast for 2011
economic growth.  The Aussie fell for a second week against the yen as
concern output is slowing in  Europe  and the U.S. spurred
declines in prices of commodities that account for a majority of
Australia’s exports. The  New Zealand dollar  reached three-week
lows versus the dollar and yen as global stocks fell. Bond
yields tumbled.  “We’re looking an economy that’s not really grown
significantly apart from the mining sector,” said  Thomas Averill , a director in Sydney at Rochford Capital, a currency
and interest-rate risk management company. “The moderation of
the growth forecast from the RBA was the more interesting
component of the statement. You’ll see the Aussie trade softly
for the next two or three weeks.”  Australia ’s dollar dropped 4.3 percent this week, the
biggest drop since May 2010. It rose 0.5 percent to $1.0521 at
1:23 p.m. in  New York . It touched $1.0376 today, the lowest
level since April 5. The currency fell 0.1 percent to 82.45 yen,
weakening 2.2 percent over the past five days. It reached 81.42
yen today, the lowest since March.  New Zealand’s dollar, nicknamed the kiwi, strengthened 1
percent to 84.48 U.S. cents after earlier touching 82.75 cents,
the weakest level since July 13. It fell 3.9 percent on the
week. The kiwi rose 0.5 percent today, while falling 1.8 percent
this week, to 65.31 yen. It touched 65.25 yen today, the lowest
since July 13.  Stocks Tumble  The MSCI Asia Pacific index of regional shares tumbled 7.8
percent this week, the most since October 2008, and the  Standard
& Poor’s  500 index fell 6.4 percent. The Thomson
Reuters/Jefferies CRB Index of raw materials slid 4.9 percent.  The RBA said in its quarterly monetary policy statement
today that economic output will likely grow at an average of 2
percent this year, down from its May 6 estimate of 3.25 percent.
It forecast consumer prices will rise 3.5 percent in the year
through to the final quarter of 2011, from a previous prediction
of 3.25 percent. Underlying inflation will remain “relatively
high” in 2012 and 2013, it said.  Australian  government bonds  soared, sending the yields on
2-year notes down 74 basis points for the week, or 0.74
percentage point, to 3.66 percent, the lowest level since July
2009. The 10-year yield fell 33 basis points to 4.48 percent,
the lowest level since April 2009.  To contact the reporter on this story:
