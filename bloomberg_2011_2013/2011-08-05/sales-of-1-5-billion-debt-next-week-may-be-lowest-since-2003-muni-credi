Municipal issuers plan about $2
billion in sales next week, the slowest August week since at
least 2003, after lawmakers ended a months-long debate over
raising the U.S. debt limit.  The slowdown, from about $4.9 billion this week, reflects
issuers’ hesitation to sell while Congress and the White House
were hashing out the  debt deal , said Matt Fabian, a managing
director of Concord, Massachusetts-based Municipal Market
Advisors.  Some issuers may still be working through their calendars
to find the right time to return to the market, he said.  “It’s probably still a scheduling problem around the
Treasury debt-ceiling issue and reflecting the uncertainty
around that,” Fabian said.  He also pointed to the rush to sell municipal debt during
the week ended July 22, when $8.55 billion of bonds and notes
changed hands before the Aug. 2 deadline for raising the federal
debt ceiling.  “That week probably stole some of this week’s and next
week’s issuance,” Fabian said.  In 2003 through 2010, the average weekly issuance in August
was $5.81 billion, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The
slowest such period was $2.6 billion in the last week of August
in 2003, the earliest year for which Bloomberg has weekly data.  The 30-day visible supply was about $5.5 billion as of
yesterday, below the year-to-date average of $7.2 billion,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  State Deficits  States are limiting the debt they take on after grappling
with $103 billion in deficits for fiscal 2012 amid voter demands
for fiscal conservatism, said Herman Charbonneau, senior vice
president of New York-based underwriters Roosevelt & Cross Inc.  “The planning cycle is so long and needs to be so
carefully developed that the fundamental thing that drives bond
issuance is getting money to build things,” he said. Without
such capital projects, public issuers aren’t in the market,
Charbonneau said.  Top-rated 30-year tax-exempt yields fell to 4.02 percent
today, the lowest this year. Top-rated 10-year tax-exempt yields
slid to 2.48 percent, also a low for 2011.  Investors pulled about $861 million from U.S. municipal-
bond mutual funds in the week through Aug. 3, Lipper US Fund
Flows said yesterday. It was the second straight week of
outflows and the biggest since April, the data show. A basis
point is 0.01 percentage point.  To contact the reporters on this story:
