The rout that erased about $780
billion from U.S. share values yesterday reflected orderly
selling by institutional investors, unlike the crash of May
2010, traders said.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index fell 4.8 percent to an
eight-month low, the biggest drop since February 2009. The
tumble that became known by traders as the flash crash on May 6,
2010, wiped out $862 billion in less than 20 minutes and briefly
sent the  S&P 500  down 8.6 percent.  While 497 stocks in the S&P 500 fell yesterday, declines
were smaller than in the 2010 crash. So-called circuit breakers
that halt trading when shares rise or fall 10 percent in five
minutes were triggered once yesterday. The swings on May 6 were
so wide that the curbs would have been set off more than 600
times had they existed, according to data compiled by Ana Avramovic, a New York-based analyst at Credit Suisse Group AG.  “It’s very, very, very different from the flash crash,”
Joseph Mazzella, global head of trading at Knight Capital Group
Inc. in  Jersey City ,  New Jersey , said in a telephone interview
yesterday. In 2010, “there was more volume, more volatility and
a vicious window where trading got disorderly that day,” he
said. “Today, relatively speaking, is an orderly sell-off.”  Last year’s disruption led to new curbs to safeguard
markets. Exchanges now require market makers to supply bids and
offers within 8 percent of a stock’s prevailing price for the
biggest companies during most of the trading day. Last year’s
slump was exacerbated by shares of companies such as  Accenture
Plc  plunging to pennies.  Russell 1000 , ETFs  Circuit breakers were also implemented for stocks in the
S&P 500 and Russell 1000 Index as well as almost 350 exchange-
traded funds. They halt trading when shares rise or fall 10
percent within five minutes. The pause lasts five minutes.
Exchanges said in June that the program would be expanded on
Aug. 8.  “Liquidity is fine,”  Dave Lutz , head of ETF trading and
strategy at Stifel Nicolaus & Co. in Baltimore, wrote in an e-
mail. “I have not heard any chatter of brokers pulling in bids,
and I don’t see any ‘panic’-type selling from our clients. The
market is operating just fine -- this is a bad sell-off, but
very orderly.”  Concern the global economy may relapse into a recession is
driving investors out of stocks and the euro and into havens
such as Treasuries. The S&P 500 has retreated 11 percent since
July 22, the biggest loss over the same amount of time since
March 9, 2009, when the  bull market  began.  Euro, Spending  The euro fell against the dollar yesterday after European
Central Bank President  Jean-Claude Trichet  said policy makers
will offer banks additional cash to ease tensions in financial
markets. That followed reports on U.S. manufacturing and
consumer spending over the last two weeks, showing the world’s
largest economy is slowing.  Equity derivatives suggest a level of concern similar to
May 2010. The VIX, as the Chicago Board Options Exchange
Volatility Index is known, jumped to 31.66 yesterday. The
compares with 32.80 on May 6, 2010. The measure surged 35
percent yesterday, the most since the record 64 percent increase
on Feb. 27, 2007. The S&P 500’s move was the biggest since the
2010 crash and more than double the four-week average.  Money markets showed little stress. The difference between
two-year swap rates and comparable-maturity Treasury note yields
ended the day at 26.25 basis points, down from the high this
year of 31 basis points on June 24 and below the 52.25 basis
points in May 2010 when the extent of  Greece ’s fiscal crisis
came to light.  Commercial Paper   Rates on the highest-ranked 30-day commercial paper
averaged 19 basis points, compared with 22 basis points in
January and last year’s high of 44 in July, according to yields
offered by companies and compiled by Bloomberg.  Exchanges canceled trades on May 6, 2010, that were 60
percent or more away from their price at 2:40 p.m. in New York,
when the sell-off intensified. Transactions in 326 securities,
70 percent of which were ETFs, were broken, regulators said.
About 20,800 separate trades were voided, including many when
orders hit stub quotes, or placeholder bids and offers from
market makers that aren’t meant to be used.  During yesterday’s rout, trades were canceled for two
companies, according to data compiled by exchanges. Short-sale
restrictions were imposed for about 850 securities when they
declined 10 percent on the day, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The curbs, which began Feb. 28, limit bearish bets
the day they’re triggered and the next, requiring traders to
execute orders at prices higher than the best available bid.  “There was liquidity today for people to get done what
they wanted to get done,” Michael James, a managing director at
Wedbush Securities Inc. in  Los Angeles , said in a telephone
interview yesterday. “The significant move down in 2010 was
related to technology malfunctions and inefficient market
functions. Today we didn’t experience technological snafus, and
there weren’t instances of bids being pulled. It was just a
preponderance of selling on bad economic news.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
