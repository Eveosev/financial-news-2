The lira will keep underperforming
other emerging-market currencies and investors should buy
dollars if  Turkey ’s currency appreciates, while avoiding
“chasing” lira weakness as central bank may step in to support
the currency, Morgan Stanley said.  The lira plunged yesterday 2.7 percent against the dollar,
the most in more than a year, after policy makers cut their
benchmark  interest rate . The bank unveiled steps to protect the
lira including offering $50 million for sale in an auction today
and pledging to increase the size of sales if needed. The
currency gained 0.2 percent to 1.7372 per dollar at 2:02 p.m. in
Istanbul, reversing earlier losses.  “Any periods of sharp weakness are likely to be met with a
policy response to prevent any disorderly moves,” Morgan
Stanley analysts including James Lord, emerging-market
strategist in  London , and  Tevfik Aksoy , chief economist for the
region in London, wrote in a note to clients. Buying dollars on
signs of strength in the lira “is a strategy that makes
sense,” he wrote.  Turkey’s currency has tumbled 11 percent this year, the
biggest decline among 31 major currencies tracked by Bloomberg,
on concern the country will struggle to contain its current-
account deficit.  The analysts said they don’t “suggest chasing the lira
weaker on the back of big moves, since a policy response would
likely be forthcoming,” according to the report.  The central bank has foreign currency reserves of $93
billion as of July 29, according to data on its website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
