Financial markets haven’t reacted as
European leaders had hoped to the second Greek rescue package
and plans for a revamped bailout mechanism, European Union
Economic and Monetary Affairs Commissioner  Olli Rehn  said.  “Markets have not reacted as we expected or hoped for to
the measures agreed by euro-area Heads of State and Government
on July 21,” Rehn told reporters in Brussels today. “The
spread of bond-market tensions across the euro area is, however,
not justified by economic and budgetary fundamentals.”  The July 21 agreement will take time to implement, though
markets expected immediate action, Rehn said.  “Such a comprehensive, detailed and technically complex
agreement requires time to implement,” he said. “But there
were expectations in financial markets that all elements could
be implemented immediately. While these expectations were
clearly unrealistic, markets have nevertheless been
disappointed,” Rehn said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
