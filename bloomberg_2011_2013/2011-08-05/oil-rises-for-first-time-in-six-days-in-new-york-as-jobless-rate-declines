Oil rose for the first time in six
days in  New York  and curbed the biggest weekly drop in three
months as the U.S. added more jobs than forecast in July and the
Italian government said it will speed up austerity measures.  Futures gained 0.3 percent after the Labor Department
reported that payrolls rose by 117,000 workers, more than the
85,000 median estimate in a Bloomberg News survey of economists.
Equities halted the worst slide in more than two years after
markets tumbled yesterday amid concern that the economic
recovery in the U.S. and Europe is faltering.  “We’re looking for signs of recovery,” said Carl Larry,
director of energy derivatives and research with Blue Ocean LLC
in New York. “We’re getting a lift from  Europe .”  Oil for September delivery rose 25 cents to settle at
$86.88 a barrel on the  New York Mercantile Exchange . Prices
tumbled 9.2 percent this week, the biggest drop since the week
ended May 6.  Brent crude  for September settlement on the London-based
ICE Futures Europe exchange increased $2.12, or 2 percent, to
$109.37 a barrel. Brent fell 6.3 percent this week. The European
benchmark contract was at a $22.49 a barrel premium to U.S.
futures after reaching a record $22.67 on Aug. 2.  Crude swung between gains and losses in intraday trading,
with prices touching an eight-month low of $82.87 a barrel on
economic uncertainty before rebounding after the U.S. Labor
Department reported that employers added more jobs than forecast
in the U.S. in July, a signal that fuel demand may increase.  Unemployment Rate  The U.S. jobless rate slipped to 9.1 percent in July from
9.2 percent in June, the Labor Department report showed.  Italian President Silvio Berlusconi and Finance Minister
 Giulio Tremonti  said the country will adopt a balanced budget
amendment, liberalize its labor market and speed asset sales.
They spoke at a joint press conference in  Rome  as they sought to
earn the confidence of investors who have driven Italy’s bond
yields to euro-era highs.  The  S&P 500  was up 0.5 percent at 1,206.14 when Nymex floor
trading closed at 2:30 p.m. in New York. It slipped 0.69 point
to 1,199.38 at 4:05 p.m. in New York. The  Dow Jones Industrial
Average  rose 60.93 points, or 0.5 percent, to 11,444.61.  The euro strengthened 1.3 percent to $1.4281 at 4:15 p.m.
in New York, boosting the appeal of commodities as an alternate
investment to the  U.S. dollar .  New York crude futures wiped out all their gains for 2011
yesterday, equities plunged and 21 of the 24 commodities on the
Standard & Poor’s GSCI Index declined amid growing signals that
the  U.S. economy  is faltering and as the debt crisis in Europe
threatened to spread to Italy and Spain.  Fiscal Limits  “Europe and the U.S. appear to have reached the limits of
what could be done on the fiscal front, with poor results, and
are now moving together toward austerity policies,” said
 Christophe Barret , global oil analyst at  Credit Agricole  in
 London , in a note to clients today. He said prices will fall
over the next few weeks and forecast an $85 price for New York
futures and $95 for Brent.  U.S. lawmakers agreed this week to cut the federal deficit
by $917 billion as part of a plan to raise the nation’s debt
ceiling by $2.1 trillion and stave off a default.  Crude in New York, which fell below a long-term Fibonacci
support yesterday, has crossed the bottom of a technical
downtrend channel at about $85.20 a barrel, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. The 14-day relative strength index for
West Texas Intermediate futures also dropped below 30, signaling
the market may have fallen too quickly. Today’s reading is 26.7,
compared with 45.2 a week ago.  ‘Tumultuous Week  “It looks like crude is licking its wounds here,” said
 Matt Smith , a commodities analyst for Summit Energy Services
Inc. in Louisville,  Kentucky . “It was indecisive after a
tumultuous week.”  Prices also increased as products surged after Valero
Energy Corp. said it shut both crude units at is Memphis
refinery and an Iranian pipeline exploded in Larstan in the west
of the country, according to the state-run Mehr news service.  Gasoline for September delivery gained 6.8 cents, or 2.5
percent, to settle at $2.8052 a gallon on the Nymex.  “There’s extreme volatility and people are trying to come

president of Ritterbusch & Associates, a Galena, Illinois-based
consulting company.  Implied volatility for at-the-money Nymex crude oil options
expiring in September, a measure of expected price swings in
futures and a gauge of options prices, was 41.4 percent at 3

32.1 percent a week ago.  Oil volume in electronic trading on the Nymex was 855,922
