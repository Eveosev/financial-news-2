Losses for U.S. banks triggered by
counterparty defaults on over-the-counter derivatives totaled
less than $2.7 billion since 2007, according to the
International Swaps & Derivatives Association.  Risk management processes such as netting and
collateralization decreased the net current credit exposure of
the U.S. banking system to $107 billion, or 0.04 percent of
notional debt outstanding, ISDA said.  “The credit risk losses and exposure of U.S. banks related
to derivatives are quite manageable,” said Conrad Voldstad,
ISDA’s chief executive officer.  To contact the reporter on this story:
