American International Group Inc. (AIG) 
declined in New York trading after second-quarter profit fell at
its two largest units.  AIG dropped 84 cents, or 3.2 percent, to $25.56 at 10:18
a.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading, the lowest
since March of last year. The company has declined about 47
percent this year.  Pretax operating profit dropped at the Chartis property-
casualty unit on catastrophe claims and at the SunAmerica life
business on lower investment income, New York-based AIG said in
a statement late yesterday. Net income was $1.84 billion,
compared with a loss of $2.66 billion a year earlier when the
bailed-out company took charges tied to discontinued operations.  “We remain cautious on the shares,” said  Cliff Gallant ,
an analyst at KBW Inc., in a note to investors. “The company’s
return on equity is single-digit and may be so for years.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
