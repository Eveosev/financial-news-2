Tanzania’s shilling headed for a
third weekly decline against the dollar as oil importers and
telecommunication companies stepped up purchases of the U.S.
currency.  The East African nation’s currency retreated 0.3 percent to
1,602.5 per dollar, taking its retreat this week to 0.8 percent,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  “We have seen more demand for dollars from the oil and
telecom sectors over the past two to three weeks,” Zainul
Chandoo, head of treasury at Standard Bank Group Ltd.’s
Tanzanian unit, said by phone today from  Dar es Salaam . “Local
currency liquidity in the market has also been tight over the
past week.”  Tanzania’s shilling is  Africa ’s third-worst performer
against the dollar over the past six months after  Uganda  and
Kenya’s shillings. The country’s inflation rate climbed to 10.9
percent in June, the fastest pace in 14 months, on higher energy
and food costs, the National Bureau of Statistics said on July
15.  To contact the reporter on this story:
