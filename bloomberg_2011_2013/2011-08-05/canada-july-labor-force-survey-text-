Following is the text of
 Canada 's labor force survey released by  Statistics Canada .  Following three consecutive months of increases,
employment was little changed in July. The unemployment
rate declined by 0.2 percentage points to 7.2%, as fewer
people participated in the labour market.  Employment increased by 252,000 (+1.5%) compared with
July 2010, with the growth in full time and among private
sector employees.  In July, employment increased in construction,
transportation and warehousing as well as retail and
wholesale trade. At the same time, there were decreases in
health care and social assistance; educational services;
business, building and other support services; natural
resources as well as agriculture.  An increase in the number of private sector employees
was offset by a decline in the public sector.  There were more people working in Alberta and in
Newfoundland and Labrador in July, while there was a
decline in Ontario. There was little or no change in the
other provinces.  In July, younger students aged 15 to 16 experienced
more difficulty finding work than their older
counterparts. Their  unemployment rate  was similar to that
of July 2009, while the rate for students aged 20 to 24
dropped by half.  Gains in construction, transportation and warehousing  Employment in construction rose by 31,000 in July,
following three months of little change. This increase
brings gains over the past 12 months to 66,000 (+5.3%).  Employment in transportation and warehousing rose for
the second consecutive month, up 28,000 in July. Compared
with 12 months earlier, employment in transportation and
warehousing increased by 7.2%, the highest growth rate of
all industries.  There were 28,000 more people working in retail and
wholesale trade in July. Despite this increase, employment
in this industry remained similar to its level of a year
earlier.  Employment in manufacturing edged up in July. Over the
past 12 months, the number of workers in this industry
rose by 1.2% (+22,000).  Following a long-term upward trend, employment fell by
39,000 in health care and social assistance in July. This
decline leaves employment in the industry slightly above
its level of July 2010 (+0.7%).  Employment in educational services declined by 30,000
in July, all in elementary and secondary schools (see Note
to readers).  Employment also decreased in July in business, building
and other support services (-14,000), natural resources (-
11,000) as well as agriculture (-9,000).  More private sector employees  The number of employees in the private sector increased
for the fifth consecutive month, up 95,000 in July. This
brings total gains from 12 months earlier to 241,000
(+2.2%). In contrast, employment in the public sector fell
by 72,000 in July, leaving the number of employees in the
sector 0.9% above the level of 12 months ago.  Self-employment edged down in July, bringing the number
of self-employed slightly below its level of 12 months ago
(-0.7%).  In July, increases in full-time employment were mostly
offset by declines in part-time work. Over the last 12
months, full-time employment has grown by 351,000 (+2.6%)
while part time has declined by 99,000 (-2.9%).  Employment increases in  Alberta   Employment in Alberta rose by 12,000 in July, the third
consecutive monthly increase. Employment in the province
is now 3.8% higher than 12 months earlier. This is the
highest growth rate of all provinces and higher than the
national average of 1.5%.  Following two consecutive months of decreases,
employment in Newfoundland and Labrador increased by 3,800
in July. Compared with 12 months earlier, employment in
the province has grown by 3.5%, the second highest growth
rate in the country.  In Ontario, employment declined by 22,000 in July.
Despite this decline, employment growth over the past 12
months stands at 1.6%, similar to the national growth
rate. The unemployment rate fell by 0.2 percentage points
to 7.5%, the result of a decrease in the number of people
participating in the labour market.  While employment in  Quebec  was little changed in July,
the unemployment rate fell by 0.7 percentage points to
7.2%, mostly the result of fewer people in the labour
market in search of work. Compared with 12 months earlier,
employment in the province increased by 1.5%, the same as
the national rate of growth.  Student summer employment  From May to August, the Labour Force Survey collects
labour market information about young people aged 15 to 24
who were attending school full time in March and intend to
return to school in the fall. The published estimates are
not seasonally adjusted; therefore, comparisons can only
be made on a year-over-year basis.  Employment for students aged 15 to 24 was little
changed in July compared with 12 months earlier. In July
2011, the unemployment rate for students was 17.4%,
similar to that of July 2010. This was lower than the rate
of 20.8% observed in July 2009, a time when the student
labour market was particularly affected by the labour
market downturn.  In July 2011, younger students experienced more
difficulty than their older counterparts in finding work.
The unemployment rate among students aged 15 to 16 was the
highest among all students at 32.7% and was similar to
their rate of July 2009.  Among 17- to 19-year-olds, the unemployment rate was
17.6%, lower than the rate of 19.9% in July 2009. For
students aged 20 to 24, it was 7.1%, about half the rate
of 13.3% observed two years earlier.  The next release of the Labour Force Survey will be on
September 9.  To contact the reporter on this story:
