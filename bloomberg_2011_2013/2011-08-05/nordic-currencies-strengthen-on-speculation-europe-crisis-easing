The Norwegian and Swedish currencies
strengthened on speculation policy makers are keeping the
sovereign-debt crisis from worsening after the  European Central
Bank  bought Portuguese and Irish bonds for a second day.  Sweden’s krona gained against all 16 major currency peers
tracked by Bloomberg, while the Nordic krone appreciated against
all but the krona and Japanese yen, amid renewed demand for
assets tied to economic growth.  “The expectation that the ECB will do more in the market
than what it did yesterday is one of the reasons why investors
are not selling the Scandinavian currencies,” said  John Hydeskov , chief analyst at Danske Bank A/S in London. “This is
also a Scandinavian move. Investors are starting to see Nordics
with good fundamentals and good value.”  The Norwegian krone strengthened 1 percent to 5.4814
against the dollar at 3:40 p.m. in  London , after tumbling 3.2
percent yesterday. The krone rose 0.2 percent to 7.7904 per
euro. Sweden’s krona appreciated 1 percent against the dollar to
6.4833 and 0.2 percent versus the euro at 9.2132.  Two people with knowledge of the transactions confirmed the
ECB purchased  government bonds  today, though they declined to be
identified because the trades are confidential. The ECB bought a
small amount of short-dated debt today, according to one of the
people.  To contact the reporter on this story:
