Chile ’s economic activity indicator
increased 6.1 percent in June from the previous year, more than
economists forecast, driven by retail and industrial expansion.  The median forecast of 18 economists surveyed by Bloomberg
was for the Imacec, as the central bank’s monthly gross domestic
product proxy is known, to climb 5.8 percent in June. The
economy grew a seasonally adjusted 0.7 percent from the previous
month, the central bank said today on its website.  While economic growth and inflation expectations in Chile
are easing, policy makers need to see further moderation in
internal demand growth before completing their tightening cycle,
Luis Oscar Herrera, the central bank’s head of research, said in
an Aug. 3 interview. Retail sales rose 12.5 percent from June
last year, the  National Statistics Institute  reported July 28.  “The monthly result was influenced mainly by growth in
commercial and industrial activity,” the bank said today.  Industrial production expanded 4 percent in June from a
year ago while copper output slumped to the lowest since
February on strikes and inclement weather.  The central bank kept the benchmark  interest rate  unchanged
at 5.25 percent last month, the first pause since January, amid
a “highly uncertain” global outlook, according to minutes of
the meeting in which a quarter-point increase was discussed.  Chile’s peso was little changed at 462.63 per  U.S. dollar 
at 9:11 a.m. New York time. The currency has depreciated 1.1
percent since July 29 after five straight weekly gains.  To contact the reporter on this story:
