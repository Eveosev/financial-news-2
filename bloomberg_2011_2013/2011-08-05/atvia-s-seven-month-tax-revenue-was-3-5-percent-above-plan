Latvia collected 3.5 percent more tax
revenue than the government planned in the first seven months of
the year as the country’s economy grew, the  Finance Ministry 
said today in a  statement .  The Baltic nation collected 2.2 billion lati ($4.4 billion)
in revenue in the year through July, 74.3 million lati more than
anticipated, as payments of businesses and personal-income tax
rose faster than expected, the ministry said.  Tax from business income was 52.7 percent or 37.3 million
lati more than planned, while personal-income tax was 5.5
percent, or 23.4 million lati higher, the ministry said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
