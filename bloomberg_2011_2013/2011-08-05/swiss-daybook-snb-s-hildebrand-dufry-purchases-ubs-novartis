The Swiss Central Bank won’t exclude
any “effective measures” to curb the advance of the Swiss
franc,  Swiss National Bank  President Philipp Hildebrand told
Neue Zuercher Zeitung in an interview.  “We clearly communicated that we are willing to take
further measures if those are necessary,” Hildebrand was quoted
as saying. He was responding to a question whether the SNB had
opted to boost liquidity rather than sell Swiss francs.  Hildebrand also said it’s important for the Swiss National
Bank to have an alternative to cutting or raising  interest rates 
when it comes to conducting monetary policy.  Having a fixed Swiss franc rate against the euro would be
“incompatible” with the Swiss central bank’s constitutional
and legally binding task of conducting an independent monetary
policy, Hildebrand was quoted as saying.  EQUITIES:
