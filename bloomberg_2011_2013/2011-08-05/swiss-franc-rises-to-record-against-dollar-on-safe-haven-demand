The franc rose to a record against
the dollar as investors sought the haven currency even after
Swiss National Bank President Philipp Hildebrand said policy
makers won’t exclude “further measures” to curb its advance.  The franc strengthened against eight of its major peers
tracked by Bloomberg. Equity markets fell, with the benchmark
Stoxx Europe 600 index falling 1.8 percent, as demand increased
for the safest assets.  “The SNB is all talk and no action and the markets are now
calling their bluff,” said  Geoff Kendrick , head of European
currency strategy at Nomura International Plc in London. “The
franc will strengthen in this environment as it is still the
only safe haven.”  The franc depreciated 0.7 percent to 1.08339 per euro as of
4:32 p.m. in London, paring its gain for the week to 3.8
percent. It reached a record 1.07112 earlier today. The franc
strengthened to 76.21 centimes a dollar after reaching a record
75.79 centimes.  “We clearly communicated that we are willing to take
further measures if those are necessary,” Hildebrand was quoted
as saying in an interview in Neue Zuercher Zeitung.  Editors: Peter Branton, Keith Jenkins  To contact the reporter on this story:
