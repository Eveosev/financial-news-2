Following is the text of the
June building permits report from  Statistics Canada .  Municipalities issued building permits worth $6.6
billion in June, up 2.1% from May, when growth was 20.9%.
The increase in June was largely attributable to higher
construction intentions for industrial and institutional
buildings in Ontario and multi-family dwellings in British
Columbia.  The value of permits in the non-residential sector rose
3.0% to $2.8 billion in June, following a 51.1% increase
in May. Industrial and institutional buildings in Ontario
and Quebec were behind much of the advance in the non-
residential sector.  In the residential sector, municipalities issued $3.7
billion worth of permits in June, up 1.5% from May, when
intentions had increased 5.2%. The gain in June was
primarily the result of higher construction intentions for
multi-family dwellings in British Columbia and single-
family dwellings in Ontario and Saskatchewan.  The total value of building permits was up in seven
provinces, led by Ontario and British Columbia. In
contrast, Alberta,  New Brunswick  and Manitoba posted
declines in June.  Non-residential sector: Industrial and institutional
components up  In June, construction intentions rose in the industrial
and institutional components for a second consecutive
month.

____________  Note to readers  Unless otherwise stated, this release presents
seasonally adjusted data, which facilitates comparisons by
removing the effects of seasonal variations.  The Building Permits Survey covers 2,400 municipalities
representing 95% of the population. It provides an early
indication of building activity.  The communities representing the other 5% of the
population are very small, and their levels of building
activity have little impact on the total.  The value of planned construction activities shown in
this release excludes engineering projects (for example,
waterworks, sewers or culverts) and land.  For the purpose of this release, the census
metropolitan area of Ottawa-Gatineau (Ontario/ Quebec ) is
divided into two areas: Gatineau part and Ottawa part.  Revisions  Preliminary data are provided for the current reference
month. Revised data, based on late responses, are updated
for the previous month.

____________  In the industrial component, the value of permits
increased 78.7% in June to $615 million, following a 22.8%
advance in May. June's gain came from seven provinces, led
by Ontario and Quebec. In Ontario, the gain was
attributable to higher construction intentions for
transportation and utilities buildings. Quebec followed
with increases in a range of industrial buildings, such as
utilities buildings and manufacturing plants.  Construction intentions in the institutional component
rose 23.1% to $647 million in June, following a 7.1%
increase in May. The advance in June was primarily the
result of higher construction intentions for medical
facilities in Ontario and social housing in Quebec.  In contrast, the value of commercial building permits
fell 16.5% to $1.6 billion in June, following a
significant increase in May. In Ontario, laboratories and
retail establishments posted the largest declines. In
June, six other provinces, including  Alberta , British
Columbia and Quebec, also registered decreases in
commercial construction intentions.  Residential sector: Higher intentions for single-family
dwellings  The value of building permits for single-family
dwellings rose 3.4% to $2.2 billion in June, following a
4.8% decline in May. June's increase was attributable to
gains in eight provinces, led by Ontario and Saskatchewan.  Construction intentions for multi-family dwellings
decreased 1.0% to $1.5 billion in June, following a 22.6%
advance in May. Ontario, Quebec and Alberta accounted for
much of the decline. Conversely, British Columbia
registered the largest gain, followed by Nova Scotia.  Canadian municipalities approved the construction of
17,227 new dwellings in June, up 1.5% from May. The
increase came from single-family dwellings, which rose
4.7% to 6,946 units. Multi-family dwellings edged down
0.5% to 10,281 units.  Ontario and British Columbia post the largest gains  The value of building permits was up in seven
provinces, led by Ontario and British Columbia.  Ontario posted its second consecutive monthly increase
in June. The advance was largely attributable to higher
construction intentions for industrial and institutional
buildings. British Columbia followed, as a result of an
increase in the value of residential permits, particularly
permits for multi-family dwellings.  In contrast, Alberta posted the biggest decline, mainly
as a result of decreases in permits for commercial and
industrial buildings, which had increased in May.  Higher permit values in most census metropolitan areas  The total value of permits was up in 22 of the 34
census metropolitan areas in June.  Vancouver , Calgary and  London  had the largest
increases. In Vancouver, the advance was largely
attributable to permits for multi-family dwellings and
commercial buildings. In Calgary, the gain came from
higher construction intentions in both residential and non-
residential sectors. In London, the increase was mainly
due to institutional buildings.  By contrast, the largest declines were in Toronto and
 Edmonton . In Toronto, the decrease was attributable in
particular to permits for multi-family dwellings,
commercial buildings and institutional facilities. In
Edmonton, the decline originated primarily from lower
construction intentions for commercial and residential
buildings.  To contact the reporter on this story:
