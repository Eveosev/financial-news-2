Ethanol futures rose the most in a
month in  Chicago  after a government report showed U.S. employers
added more jobs than forecast in July.  The grain-based additive followed gasoline and other
commodities higher after the Labor Department reported payrolls
rose by 117,000 workers, more than the 85,000 forecast in a
Bloomberg survey of economists. Ethanol is blended with gasoline
to stretch supply and meet federal mandates.  Denatured ethanol for August delivery advanced 9.3 cents,
or 3.5 percent, to settle at $2.735 a gallon on the Chicago
Board of Trade, the biggest one-day gain since July 5. Futures
have risen 15 percent this year.  In cash market trading, ethanol on the West Coast declined
4.5 cents, or 1.6 percent, to $2.86 a gallon and in the U.S.
Gulf the biofuel decreased 1 cent, or 0.4 percent, to $2.835,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Ethanol in Chicago slid 0.5 cent to $2.715 a gallon and in
 New York  the gasoline additive gained 0.5 cent to $2.81.  On a spot basis, an average ethanol mill in  Iowa  is making
8 cents on every gallon of the fuel, while a typical plant in
 Illinois  is pocketing 18 cents, according to Ag TraderTalk, a
Clive, Iowa-based online grains information service.  To contact the reporter on this story:
