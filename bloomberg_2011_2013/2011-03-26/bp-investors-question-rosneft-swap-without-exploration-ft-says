Investors in  BP Plc (BP/)  said the
company shouldn’t push ahead with the $7.8 billion share swap
with OAO Rosneft without a deal to explore  Russia ’s Arctic, the
Financial Times said.  BP’s Russian billionaire partners in the TNK-BP venture won
an extension of an injunction blocking the Rosneft deal this
week. BP said yesterday it will apply to proceed with the share
swap on its own, without the exploration pact. That would be a
concern for investors, according to two shareholders who
declined to be identified, the FT said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
