Groupe Lactalis said it acted
“correctly” following reports that a Milan prosecutor is
probing  Parmalat SpA (PLT)  stock movements, after the shares soared
during a battle for control of  Italy ’s largest dairy company.  “Lactalis confirms that it always acted correctly and
calmly awaits developments on the matter,” the Laval, France-
based company that this week agreed to become Parmalat’s biggest
shareholder said in a statement late yesterday.  Parmalat Chief Executive Officer Enrico Bondi was
questioned as a witness by prosecutor Eugenio Fusco yesterday,
said two people familiar with the probe, who declined to be
identified because it is ongoing. The prosecutor has been
reviewing share trading dating back to at least February, one of
the people said.  Lactalis said March 22 it would buy the 15.3 percent stake
in Parmalat held by a group of activist investors, boosting its
holding to 29 percent. That was before Italian Prime Minister
 Silvio Berlusconi ’s Cabinet passed a decree allowing Parmalat to
delay an April shareholders meeting where Lactalis would likely
have gained management control of Parmalat.  Parmalat shares jumped 20 percent this year through March
21, the day before the Lactalis announcement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
