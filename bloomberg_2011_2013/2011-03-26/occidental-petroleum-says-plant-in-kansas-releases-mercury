Occidental Petroleum Corp. (OXY) ’s
chemicals plant near Wichita,  Kansas , had a failure that
resulted in the release of an unknown amount of mercury, the
company said in a filing.  A company  report  with the National Response Center showed
the incident took place yesterday.  U.S. refineries and chemicals plants must notify the
National Response Center if they release hazardous substances in
excess of reportable quantities, according to the Comprehensive
Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act, commonly
known as Superfund.  The report said absorbents were applied and the area
isolated. A cleanup is under way, the company’s report said.  The plant is about 12 miles (19 kilometers) southwest of
Wichita.  To contact the reporter on this story:
