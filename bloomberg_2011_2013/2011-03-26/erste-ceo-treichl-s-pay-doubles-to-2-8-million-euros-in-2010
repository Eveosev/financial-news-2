Erste Group Bank AG (EBS)  Chief Executive
Officer Andreas Treichl earned 2.8 million euros ($3.9 million)
in 2010, almost double the 1.48 million euros he made the
previous year.  His pay includes a 1.3 million-euro bonus for 2009, which
wasn’t awarded until 2010, as noted in the annual report for
last year, published late yesterday. The bank, eastern  Europe ’s
second-biggest, gave no bonus payments in 2008 after receiving
state aid.  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
