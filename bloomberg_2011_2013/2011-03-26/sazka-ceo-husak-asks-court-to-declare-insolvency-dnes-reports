Sazka AS Chief Executive Officer
Ales Husak has asked Prague’s Municipal Court to declare the
lottery company insolvent,  Dnes  said.  The filling late yesterday followed an earlier session of
the court which declined to hear Husak’s proposals for an
emergency loan for the company, the newspaper said. The court
must rule on Husak’s filling within 15 days, Dnes reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
