Former Goldman Sachs Group Inc.
executive Richard Sharp and a company founded by Lebanese Prime
Minister-designate Najib Mikati plan to bid for U.K. retailer
All Saints,  Sky News ’s Mark Kleinman reported on his blog
yesterday, without saying where he got the information.  Sharp and Mikati’s M1 Group are in detailed talks to take
control of the chain in a transaction valued at as much as 300
million pounds ($481 million), Sky reported.  Other parties are ready to bid if the transaction isn’t
completed, Sky said.  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
