China  Investment Corp. is looking
to invest in Canadian resource, infrastructure and real estate
companies, the Globe and Mail reported, citing the director of
the Beijing-based sovereign wealth fund’s Canadian office.  China Investment seeks minority stakes in such companies,
not controlling investments, Felix Chee said in an interview.  “There is a perception and concern about China and the
controlling of resources,” Chee told the Toronto-based
newspaper, adding that the fund “does not seek control” of any
Canadian company.  China Investment appointed Chee as head of the Toronto
office, its first foreign representative bureau, in January. The
fund bought a 17 percent stake in Teck Resources Ltd.,  Canada ’s
largest diversified mining company, for C$1.74 billion ($1.5
billion at the time of purchase) in July 2009.  To contact the reporter on this story:
