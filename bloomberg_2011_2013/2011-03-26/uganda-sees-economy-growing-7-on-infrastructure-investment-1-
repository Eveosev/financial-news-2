Uganda ’s economy may expand by as
much as 7 percent in the 2010-11 fiscal year as infrastructure
spending outweighs the effect of rising food and oil prices,
Finance Minister Syda Bbumba said.  East  Africa ’s third-biggest economy will probably grow by 6
percent to 7 percent in the 12 months through June as the
government invests in roads and power, Bbumba told reporters
today in the capital, Kampala.  “Our target is to get 7 percent growth by the end of this
financial year,” she said. “We have prioritized investments in
infrastructure development.” Food shortages caused by a drought
have pushed up prices, she said.  The forecast compares with her June 10 projection of 6.4
percent this fiscal year and 5.8 percent in 2009-10.  The expansion of private enterprise, driven by a 35 percent
increase in private credit this financial year, will also boost
growth, Louis Kasekende, the deputy governor of the central
bank, said at the press conference.  Uganda, with a population of more than 30 million people,
is set to become Africa’s newest oil producer next year when
 Tullow Oil Plc (TLW) , a U.K.-based energy company, aims to start
pumping crude and gas from the Lake Albert Basin. The country
has an estimated 2.5 billion barrels of oil, with about 1
billion barrels already proven, according to Tullow.  To contact the reporter on this story:
