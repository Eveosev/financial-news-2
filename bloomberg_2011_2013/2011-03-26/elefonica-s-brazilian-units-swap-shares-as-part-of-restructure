Telefonica SA (TEF)  said the boards of
 Telecomunicacoes de Sao Paulo SA (TLPP3) , its fixed-line unit in Brazil
known as Telesp, and  Vivo Participacoes SA (VIVO4) , the country’s
biggest wireless company, agreed that all of Vivo shares will be
owned by Telesp as part of a restructuring.  Telesp will boost its share capital and Vivo’s shareholders
will get 1.55 new shares of Telesp for each of the Vivo shares
they owned, Telefonica said in a regulatory filing.  Telefonica, based in Madrid, bought full control of Vivo,
which leads Brazil’s wireless market with 30 percent of
subscribers, last year and planned to incorporate its stock into
Telesp to cut costs. The combination would make Telesp Brazil’s
largest telecommunications company, with Telesp benefiting most
from savings, Barclays Plc said in a research report in August.  After the swap is approved at the companies’ shareholders
meetings, Telefonica will own 91.8 percent of Telesp’s ordinary
shares with  voting rights  and 64.6 percent of Telesp’s preferred
shares, according to the regulatory filing. Spain’s largest
phone company would then own 73.8 percent of Telesp’s share
capital, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
