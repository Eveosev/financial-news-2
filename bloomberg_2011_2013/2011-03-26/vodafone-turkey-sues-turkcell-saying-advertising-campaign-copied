Vodafone Group Plc (VOD) ’s Turkish unit
is suing competitor Turkcell Iletisim Hizmetleri AS on
allegations of copying an ad campaign, Vodafone  Turkey  said in
an e-mailed statement today.  Turkcell imitated Vodafone’s “ declaration of consumer
rights ” campaign with its own “ mobile constitution”  drive,
Vodafone said. Both are modeled on political declarations and
guarantee certain rights to their customers.  More than 10 million customers have transferred to Vodafone
from other operators since November 2008 when legislation made
it possible to keep the same phone number after changing
carriers, the statement said. Vodafone has taken more customers
from competitors than any rival, it said.  Turkcell, 38 percent owned by Stockholm-based  Teliasonera
AB (TLSN) , is Turkey’s biggest mobile operator by market share.  Vodafone said it opened its case on March 17 after pleas
to Turkcell to stop the campaign went unheeded. The statement
didn’t say what, if any, damages or compensation Vodafone is
seeking.  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
