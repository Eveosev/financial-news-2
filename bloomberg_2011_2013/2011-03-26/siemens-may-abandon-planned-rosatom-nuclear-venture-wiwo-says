Siemens AG (SIE)  is exploring all options
including an exit from its planned nuclear-plant joint venture
with Russia’s Rosatom Corp. after the nuclear crisis in  Japan ,
 WirtschaftsWoche  reported, citing an unidentified manager at the
company.  Siemens would forfeit “sizeable revenue” if it fully
abandons cooperation with Rosatom, the magazine said on its
website today.  No decision has been taken on whether the German company
will fully exit the venture or take a role as a preferred
technological partner, the magazine said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
