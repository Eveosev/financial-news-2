Royal Philips Electronics NV has
for the most part recovered from the 2008 financial and economic
crisis,  De Telegraaf  reported, citing an interview with retiring
Chief Executive Officer Gerard Kleisterlee.  The company’s healthcare business has grown faster “than
the market” for the past two or three years, while consumer-
products sales were flat last year, the newspaper said.  Philips’s sales in  Japan , the third-biggest market for its
medical division, may be hurt temporarily after the earthquake
and tsunami, Kleisterlee said, according to De Telegraaf.  For Related News and Information:  To contact the reporter on this story:
