Ackermans & van Haaren NV (ACKB)  said Bank
J. Van Breda & Co. NV’s 110 million-euro ($155 million) offer
for Antwerps Beroepskrediet CVBA will start March 29 and end
April 29 with payment due May 13.  The Antwerp, Belgium-based investment firm, which controls
Van Breda through its Finaxis unit, disclosed the information in
an e-mailed statement today.  Van Breda’s 490 euros-a-share offer for Antwerps
Beroepskrediet, first disclosed on Jan. 31, trumped Credit
Mutuel Nord Europe Belgium SA’s planned 410 euros-a-share offer
for the closely held lender.  To contact the reporter on this story:
