The Democratic Republic of Congo
intends to ratify the New York Convention rules on the
recognition of international arbitration rulings, the Prime
Minister’s office said today.  Prime Minister Adolphe Muzito made the announcement in a
meeting with representatives of the  World Bank  and the
 International Monetary Fund  about improving the country’s
business environment, according to an e-mailed statement from
Muzito’s office.  Congo’s ministries of environment and mining also plan to
begin publishing completed mining contracts and lists of timber
and mining permits on their respective websites to improve
transparency in the sectors, the statement said.  The Central African nation, which has a third of the
world’s cobalt resources and 4 percent of its copper, is facing
two international arbitration cases over cancelled mining
contracts belonging to  First Quantum Minerals Ltd. (FM)  The World
Bank’s International Finance Corporation was a minority
shareholder in one of the First Quantum projects, and is party
to the case against Congo at the International Court of
Arbitration in Paris.  In March 2010, the IFC announced a moratorium on any new
investments in Congo until the dispute was resolved. If Congo
ratified the New York Convention, it would require the country
to enforce the international arbitration rulings.  To contact the reporter on this story:
