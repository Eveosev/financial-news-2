Brandon Knight’s 15-foot jump shot
with 5.4 seconds remaining gave the  University of Kentucky  a
62-60 win against Ohio State University, the overall top seed in
the national men’s college basketball championship.  The Buckeyes became the third regional No. 1 seed to fall
in the National Collegiate Athletic Association tournament,
joining  Duke University  and the University of Pittsburgh. The
only top seed to reach the final eight was the University of
 Kansas .  Kansas advanced last night by beating the University of
Richmond 77-57, and second-seeded University of North Carolina
topped Marquette University 81-63. No. 11 Virginia Commonwealth
University defeated 12th-seeded Florida State 72-71 after the
Seminoles forced the game into overtime.  The next opponent for Kansas in the Southwest Region will
be Virginia Commonwealth. North Carolina will play seven-time
national champion  Kentucky  in the East Region.  Kansas’ Brady Morningstar scored 18 points and Marcus
Morris had 13 to lead the Jayhawks to victory against the 12th-
ranked Spiders at the Alamodome in San Antonio. Justin Harper
had 22 points for the Spiders, who were down 41-22 at the half.  At the Prudential Center in  Newark ,  New Jersey , Tyler
Zeller had 27 points and Harrison Barnes had 20 for North
Carolina.  The Tar Heels used a 19-0 first-half run to take a 27-10
lead, holding the Golden Eagles scoreless for 8 minutes, 47
seconds. Marquette went 0-for-14 shooting during the stretch,
turning the ball over five times.  “We did a great job of forcing them out of their offense,
and then just not letting them ever take a comfortable shot,”
Zeller said in a news conference.  ‘We Were Pitiful’  For the half, Marquette shot 20 percent from the field on
6-of-30 shooting, turning the ball over 12 times as compared
with three for the Tar Heels.  North Carolina  had a 40-15 lead at
the half.  “I thought in the first half we were pitiful,” Marquette
coach Buzz Williams said. “I knew they were really good, and I
thought they played even better than good.”  Davante Gardner had 16 points for the Golden Eagles.  To contact the reporters on this story:
