The head of Turkish Prime Minister
 Recep Tayyip Erdogan ’s constitutional advisory committee says
the country’s parliamentary system is outdated and should be
replaced by a presidential system,  Sabah  reported.  The parliamentary regime has accomplished its historical
mission and should be replaced by a system that combines the
French and U.S. forms of presidential governance, the newspaper
reported, citing conclusions by constitutional commission chief
Burhan Kuzu in a book advocating a presidential system.  To contact the reporter for this story:
