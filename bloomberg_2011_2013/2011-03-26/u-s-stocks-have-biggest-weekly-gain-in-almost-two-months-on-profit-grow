U.S. stocks rose, giving the
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index its biggest weekly rally in almost
two months, following corporate takeovers and higher-than-
estimated profit forecasts as well as easing concern that
 Japan ’s nuclear crisis will curb global economic growth.  AT&T Inc. (T)  climbed 3.3 percent after agreeing to buy T-
Mobile USA from Deutsche Telekom AG, forming the biggest U.S.
wireless-phone company.  Oracle Corp. (ORCL) ,  Jabil Circuit Inc. (JBL)  and
 Micron Technology Inc. (MU)  advanced more than 6.1 percent after
profit or forecasts at the computer-related companies beat
analysts’ projections.  Sprint Nextel Corp. (S)  dropped 7.3 percent,
the most in the S&P 500, after the mobile-phone company failed
to purchase T-Mobile.  The S&P 500 gained 2.7 percent to 1,313.80, ending a two-
week losing streak. The benchmark measure of U.S. equities pared
its slump since Feb. 18 to 2.2 percent after losing 6.4 percent
through March 16. The  Dow Jones Industrial Average  gained 362.07
points, or 3.1 percent, to 12,220.59.  “Investors are getting back into the mode of thinking
there’s an economic expansion phase that’s likely to continue,”
said Sean Kraus, who oversees about $2.2 billion as chief
investment officer at Citizens Business Bank in Pasadena,
 California . This week’s earnings reports were “very, very
positive, and a lot of the commentary coming out of the
companies was also positive.”  Recovering Losses  The  S&P 500  recouped all of its losses following Japan’s
magnitude-9 earthquake on March 11. As concern about the temblor
eased, the Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility Index,
which measures the cost of using derivatives as insurance
against S&P 500 losses, extended its drop since March 16 to 39
percent. That’s the most since November 2008 for the measure
known as the VIX.  Equities also gained after the Commerce Department said
yesterday that the  U.S. economy  expanded at a 3.1 percent annual
rate in the fourth quarter, higher than the prior estimate of
2.8 percent, as  consumer spending  increased. Applications for
first-time unemployment benefits dropped and the total number of
Americans receiving help dropped to the lowest level since
October 2008, the Labor Department said March 24.  AT&T rose 3.3 percent to $28.85 this week. The deal would
allow AT&T, now the second-largest U.S. wireless operator, to
add about 34 million customers and surpass Verizon Wireless. The
acquisition may face government scrutiny because it combines the
second- and fourth-largest wireless providers, reducing consumer
choice. Though regulatory approval may take a year, cost savings
and revenue gains could total $3 billion a year, AT&T said.  Weaker Company  Sprint, the third-largest U.S. mobile phone carrier,
slumped 7.3 percent to $4.68. An AT&T purchase of T-Mobile may
make Sprint a far weaker player in the industry, said Craig Moffett, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein & Co.  OptionsXpress Holdings Inc. (OXPS)  rose 19 percent, the most since
March 2009, to $18.26.  Charles Schwab Corp. (SCHW)  agreed to buy the
retail options brokerage for about $1 billion in stock. Charles
Schwab increased 3 percent to $18.09.  Technology companies in the S&P 500 added 4.1 percent, the
second-biggest weekly gain among 10 groups.  Oracle, the world’s biggest supplier of database software,
rose 6.1 percent to $32.64. The company forecast fourth-quarter
profit that topped the average analyst predictions, a sign of
growing demand for database software as well as hardware added
by the Sun Microsystems Inc. purchase.  Most Since 2009  Jabil Circuit advanced 14 percent, the most since December
2009, to $21.28. The electronics manufacturer forecast third-
quarter earnings excluding some items of at least 55 cents a
share, beating the average analyst estimate of 53 cents in a
Bloomberg survey.  Micron, the biggest U.S. producer of computer-memory chips,
surged 15 percent to $11.55 for the largest weekly gain since
December 2009. It posted second-quarter sales and profit that
beat analysts’ estimates on increasing demand for chips used to
store data on mobile phones and tablets.  Red Hat Inc. (RHT)  climbed 18 percent, the biggest gain in the
S&P 500, to $46.34. The largest seller of the Linux operating
system posted fiscal fourth-quarter profit of 26 cents a share
excluding some items, beating the 22-cent average estimate in a
Bloomberg survey, as customers updating data centers to take
advantage of cloud computing boosted billings.  Accenture Plc (ACN)  gained 8 percent to $54.29. The world’s
second-largest technology-consulting firm said 2011 earnings
will be $3.22 to $3.30 a share, more than the average analyst
estimate of $3.13.  Rejected by Fed  Bank of America Corp. (BAC)  fell 5 percent, the only decline in
the Dow, to $13.34. The biggest U.S. lender by assets said the
 Federal Reserve  rejected its request for a dividend increase in
the second half of 2011, forcing the company to resubmit plans
for a “modest” boost.  Best Buy Co. fell 7.3 percent, the second-biggest decline
in the S&P 500, to $29.22. The world’s largest consumer
electronics retailer forecast full-year profit that trailed some
analysts’ projections, citing economic challenges.  Purchases of new U.S. homes unexpectedly declined in
February to the slowest pace on record and prices dropped to the
lowest level since December 2003. Sales decreased 16.9 percent
to a 250,000 annual pace, figures from the Commerce Department
showed on March 23. Economists surveyed by Bloomberg News
projected a gain to a 290,000 rate, according to the median
estimate.  The median price fell 8.9 percent from the same month in
2010. Wells Fargo analyst Carl Reichardt said the February home
sales data may be revised up and didn’t reflect the market
“reality” as bad weather hurt the market.  “The things that make a market go are monetary policy,
which is stimulative right now, earnings growth and economic
growth, which have both been good,” said James Moffett, a  fund
manager  at Scout Investments, which oversees $20 billion in
Kansas City, Missouri. “Stocks will continue to climb.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
