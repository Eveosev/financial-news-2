Turkey ’s  Galatasaray  soccer club
sacked head coach Gheorgie Hagi, cutting short his 18-month
contract after the team lost 13 of its 26 matches so far this
season.  The club will promote Bulent Under to the position until
the end of the season, its listed marketing unit Galatasaray
Sportif Sinai & Ticari Yatirimlar AS said in a statement to the
Istanbul stock exchange after the market closed yesterday.  Galatasaray, one of Istanbul’s big three clubs with
Fenerbahce and Besiktas, ranks 11th in the Turkish Super League
standings.  An ex-star for  Romania ’s national team, Hagi was hired in
October to replace former Barcelona manager and Dutch
international Frank Rijkaard.  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
