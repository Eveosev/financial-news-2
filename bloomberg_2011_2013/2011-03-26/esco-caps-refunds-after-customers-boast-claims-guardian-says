Tesco Plc (TSCO)  has put a cap on its
promise to refund double the price difference on products found
more cheaply at  Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (WMT) â€™s Asda chain after some
customers boasted online that they claimed hundreds of pounds on
the promotion, the Guardian reported.  Advice had been posted on personal financing websites
explaining how the refunds could be maximized by choosing a
specific basket of goods, the newspaper said.  Tesco has now limited the amount that can be paid out under
its PriceCheck promotion to 20 pounds ($32) per visit and 100
pounds per month, the Guardian said.  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
