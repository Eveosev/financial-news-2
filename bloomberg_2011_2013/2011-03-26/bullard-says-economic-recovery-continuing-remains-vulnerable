The worldwide recovery is
continuing, especially in  Asia  and the U.S., although it still
remains vulnerable, Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis President
 James Bullard  said.  “Bad things can still happen,” Bullard said today in a
speech in Marseille, France.  When an economy experiences a negative shock, it’s still
susceptible to further negative shocks, he added.  The policy of “aggressive fiscal expansion given what’s
happened in  Europe  over the 18 months” to tackle economic
deterioration has proven to be a “little irresponsible,”
Bullard said. “What you’re seeing is the downside to this type
of policy.”  The policy is both “impractical and dangerous, given
what’s happened with the European sovereign debt crisis,” he
also said.  Bullard added that the policy of quantitative easing in the
U.S. has been successful and that inflation expectations have
been turned around since November’s announcement by the Fed for
QE2.  While “all measures of inflation are tricky to look” at
as a basis for inflation targeting, the next five years should
be a “horizon that you can hit your inflation target,” Bullard
said. “If you can’t hit it in that period, you’ve got the wrong
policy.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
