Top-seeded  Yale University  advanced
to round two of the national men’s ice hockey tournament on Chad
Ziegler’s overtime goal.  Yale (28-6-1), which beat the Air Force Academy 2-1, will
play Minnesota-Duluth (23-10-6) today in the National Collegiate
Athletic Association tournament at the Webster Bank Arena in
Bridgeport,  Connecticut . Minnesota-Duluth defeated Union College
2-0 in yesterday’s game.  Michigan  (27-10-4), which defeated Nebraska-Omaha 3-2 in
overtime, will play Colorado (23-18-3) today at the Scottrade
Center in St. Louis. Colorado beat Boston College 8-4 to advance
to the second round.  Yale’s Ziegler, with assists from Nick Jaskowiak and
Brendan Mason, scored 3:16 into overtime. He scored on his
second rebound off Air Force goalie Jason Torf.  “That goal meant a lot, I wouldn’t have missed that goal
for anything,” said Ziegler, who had been pulled from the game
to check his knee. “My knee is fine -- just a bump. I’m good to
go.”  The Bulldogs took the lead 7 minutes, 48 seconds into the
second period on Brian O’Neill’s score. Eleven minutes later,
Sean Bertsch tied the game for the  Air Force  Falcons.  To contact the reporter on this story:
