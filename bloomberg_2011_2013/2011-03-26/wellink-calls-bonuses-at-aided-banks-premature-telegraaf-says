Dutch Central Bank President Nout Wellink says awarding bonuses to executives at banks that
received state aid is “premature,”  De Telegraaf  reported.  Wellink told the Dutch newspaper in an interview that he is
“glad”  ING Groep NV (INGA)  executives decided to waive their variable
remuneration after the pay policy of the lender that got state
aid during the financial crisis sparked criticism. ING Chief
Executive Officer Jan Hommen on March 22 said the bank’s
management board would give up proposed 2010 bonuses.  ING’s recovery to profit is more important than the talk
about variable remunerations, Wellink said, according to  De
Telegraaf . “Hommen’s achievements were snowed under by all
commotion surrounding the discussion on bonuses,” he is cited
as saying.  Herman Lutke Schipholt, Wellink’s spokesman, confirmed the
comments.  To contact the reporter on this story:
