Uganda  won’t use its reserves to
protect its “undervalued” currency from weakening further
against the dollar, the central bank said.  The Bank of Uganda will conduct operations on the market to
stabilize the shilling day by day, without targeting a
particular level, Deputy Governor Louis Kasekende told reporters
today in Kampala.  “We will not use our reserves to bring” the shilling to
stronger levels, he said.  The shilling has “weakened beyond what can be explained by
fundamentals” this year, exacerbated by the country’s worsening
balance of payments and partly by speculation, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
