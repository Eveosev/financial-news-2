The  European Central Bank  is close
to completing a new facility providing troubled euro-region
banks with longer-term liquidity, which may help Irish banks,
 Reuters  reported, citing a central banker it didn’t identify.  The plan will initially be “tailor made” for Irish
lenders and may be announced next week to fit with the results
of new stress tests on the country’s lenders, the newswire said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
