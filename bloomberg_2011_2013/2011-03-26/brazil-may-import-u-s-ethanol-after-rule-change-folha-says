Brazil  may import ethanol from the
U.S. in the short term in a bid to contain rising prices, Folha
de S.Paulo newspaper reported, citing a decision by the oil
regulator.  Brazilâ€™s oil regulator allowed an increase in the amount of
water in ethanol to 1 percent from 0.4 percent, to conform to
U.S. specifications and allow imports, the newspaper said.
Brazil may import ethanol from the U.S. until April 30, when the
sugarcane harvest begins, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
