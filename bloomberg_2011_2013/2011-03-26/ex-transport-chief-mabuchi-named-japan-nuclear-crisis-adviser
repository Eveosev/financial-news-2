Former transport minister Sumio Mabuchi will take charge of  Japan ’s nuclear reactor crisis, the
government said today.  Appointed an adviser to Prime Minister  Naoto Kan , Mabuchi
“will help strengthen our response to the disaster and the
nuclear plant,” Chief Cabinet Secretary Yukio Edano told
reporters in Tokyo.  Mabuchi, 50, a ruling Democratic Party of Japan member of
the lower house of parliament, served as land and transport
minister between September 2010 and January 2011.  He resigned as minister after the opposition-controlled
upper house censured him and then-Chief Cabinet Secretary
Yoshito Sengoku in November over their handling of a collision
between a Chinese fishing boat and Japanese Coast Guard vessels
near islands claimed by both countries.  A tsunami following a magnitude-9 earthquake on March 11
damaged the Fukushima Dai-Ichi nuclear plant in northeastern
Japan, resulting in radiation leaks that contaminated vegetables
and drinking water. The plant is operated by  Tokyo  Electric
Power Co.  To contact the reporters on this story:
