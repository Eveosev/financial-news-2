Porsche SE, the sports-car maker
that plans to merge with Volkswagen AG, said its executive and
supervisory boards will decide on the details of a planned 5
billion-euro ($7 billion) share sale tomorrow.  A group of banks agreed to underwrite all new ordinary and
preferred shares to be offered at 38 euros apiece, Porsche said
in a statement late yesterday. Holders of ordinary shares
indicated they agreed to the subscription price and plan to
exercise their rights for the new ordinary shares, the company
said.  Porsche, which plans to use the proceeds to cut debt to
about 1.5 billion euros, last week said a timetable to sell new
shares still stands amid the volatile financial markets
following the Japanese earthquake. Porsche and Volkswagen agreed
to combine in August 2009 after the maker of the 911 sports car
racked up more than 10 billion euros of debt in an unsuccessful
attempt to gain control of VW.  The merger, originally scheduled for completion in the
second half of 2011, will probably be delayed into next year
because of German legal obstacles. An investigation into share-
price manipulation allegations will likely push the dealâ€™s
completion into 2012, Porsche said Feb. 24.  Porsche shareholders last year approved the stock sale to
raise funds, half of which will come from the Porsche and Piech
families, who control the common stock.  To contact the reporter on this story:
