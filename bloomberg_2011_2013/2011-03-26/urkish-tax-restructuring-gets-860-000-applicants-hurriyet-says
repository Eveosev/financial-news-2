About 860,000 Turks have applied
for a tax restructuring program that reduces some debts and
allows others to be paid in installments,  Hurriyet  reported,
citing Finance Minister Mehmet Simsek.  Interest in the program has been “strong and
encouraging,” Simsek said at a conference at Turgut Ozal
University in Ankara, according to the newspaper. He said income
received from the program will go to reduce the Treasury’s debt
load, Hurriyet reported.  The government announced the restructuring in November to
encourage repayment of overdue debt and lighten caseloads at tax
courts.  Parliament is also debating a  measure  that would forgive
debts of less than 250 liras ($160) at hospitals, and allow
higher liabilities to be reduced by 50 percent if they’re paid
within a year, Hurriyet said.  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
