Bahrain’s banks haven’t been
affected by more than a month of political turmoil in the
country,  Asharq Al-Awsat  reported, citing the country’s central
bank governor, Rasheed al-Maraj.  Oil production and large companies in the petrochemical and
aluminum industries in country were operating without
disruptions, the London-based newspaper cited al-Maraj as
saying. Banks can provide financing if needed, the newspaper
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
