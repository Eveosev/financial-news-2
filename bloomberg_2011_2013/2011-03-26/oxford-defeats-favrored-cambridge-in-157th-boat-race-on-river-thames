Oxford University  beat favored
 Cambridge University  in the 157th annual Boat Race on London’s
 River Thames .  The Oxford crew took the lead at the start of the 4.25-mile
(6.8 kilometer) race through west London and won by about four
boat lengths. It’s the third victory in the past four years for
the Dark Blues, who were the lighter crew by about 1.63 kilos
(3.6 pounds) per man.  “It all just seemed to come together,” Oxford’s Simon
Hislop said in an interview with the British Broadcasting Corp.
“It was good fun. Hard work, but good fun.”  Cambridge ’s weight advantage made it the favorite with U.K.
bookmaker William Hill Plc. After falling behind early, the
Light Blues weren’t able to duplicate their feat of rallying for
victory in last year’s race.  “We came up against a tough Oxford crew this year,”
Cambridge club president Derek Rasmussen told the  BBC . “I was
proud of the way we fought, but we lost a tough one here.”  Cambridge holds an 80-76 lead over its rival in the world’s
top student rowing race. There has been one tie in the
competition, which started in 1829 when a Cambridge student
wrote to an Oxford friend proposing a race.  Cambridge was the 4-9 favorite with William Hill, meaning a
successful $10 bet would have brought in $4.44 profit plus the
original stake. Oxford had odds of 13-8 and the race brought in
a record 150,000 pounds ($240,000) in bets for the bookmaker.  “A large amount of the early money we took was for Oxford,
however today we saw a real move for the favorite,” William
Hill spokesman Joe Crilly said in a statement. “All in all, we
have had a good day once again with the outsider winning for the
second year in a row.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
