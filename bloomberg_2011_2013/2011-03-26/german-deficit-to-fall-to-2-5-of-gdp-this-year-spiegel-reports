Germany ’s budget deficit will
decline to 2.5 percent of gross domestic product this year,  Der
Spiegel  reported, citing a draft of the government’s updated
stability program.  The deficit should drop to 2 percent next year, 1.5 percent
in 2013, 1 percent in 2014 and 0.5 percent by 2015, the magazine
said.  The positive development may be used to reduce taxes for
lower- and middle-income groups, Spiegel said, citing the
report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
