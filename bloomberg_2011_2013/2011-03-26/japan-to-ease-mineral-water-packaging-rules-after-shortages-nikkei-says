Japan ’s government will temporarily
loosen restrictions on  mineral water  to help ease shortages in
 Tokyo  and surrounding areas, the Nikkei newspaper reported,
without citing anyone.  Imported water in foreign-language packaging can be sold as
is, according to the report on the newspaper’s website.
Domestically produced mineral water can be sold in simplified
packaging stating only the maker’s name and location, the Nikkei
said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
