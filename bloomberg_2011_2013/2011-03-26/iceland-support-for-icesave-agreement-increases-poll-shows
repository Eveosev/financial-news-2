Icelandic support for a depositor
accord with the U.K. and the Netherlands has increased,
 according to  a Capacent poll conducted for Afram, a political
group which supports the pact and published the results late
yesterday.  Backing for the agreement was 56 percent compared with 52
percent in a poll conducted by MMR published March 16 by
newspaper  Vidskiptabladid . Of those polled by Capacent, 44
percent said they would reject the agreement in the April 9
referendum.  Capacent polled 1,271 people March 17 through March 24. No
margin of error was provided. Icesave is a proposal under which
Iceland would agree to pay depositors for losses stemming from
the failure of Landsbanki Islands hf, which had branches in the
U.K. and the Netherlands before its failure in 2008.  To contact the reporter on this story:
