Charges to treat and refine copper
ore have jumped after smelter and refinery capacity was curbed
by the earthquake and tsunami in  Japan ,  Macquarie Group Ltd. (MQG) 
said in a report.  Treatment charges rose to $130 a metric tons from $60-70
before the disaster and refining charges to 13 cents a pound
from 6-7 cents, Macquarie said.  Three smelters and refineries were shut by the March 11
events and they produced a combined 442,000 tons of copper last
year, equal to 2.3 percent of world supply, Macquarie said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
