Demetrio Carceller, chairman of
Disa Corp. Petrolifera SA, boosted his stake in  Sacyr
Vallehermoso SA (SYV)  to 15.7 percent, becoming the biggest
shareholder in the Spanish builder,  Cinco Dias  reported, citing
a statement from Disa.  Disa, an oil-products distributor based in  Spain ’s Canary
Islands, bought 11.9 million shares of Sacyr, or a 2.9 percent
stake, in the last few days for about 98.1 million euros ($138.2
million), the newspaper said.  Carceller now directly owns 12.9 percent of Sacyr and
another 3 percent through its association with Grupo Satocan SA,
which was diluted to 2.8 percent after Sacyr’s capital
increases, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
