Uganda  will audit Libyan
government-owned companies whose assets were frozen under United
Nations sanctions, Finance Minister Syda Bbumba said.  The audit will determine the value of the companies’
investments in the country, she said today in an interview in
Kampala. Uganda’s government has frozen $375 million of Libyan-
owned assets to comply with the UN action, the Daily Monitor
newspaper reported yesterday, citing the Foreign Ministry.  Uganda’s central bank yesterday took control of Libyan-
owned Tropical Bank Ltd. The Libyan government has investments
in companies including Uganda Telecom Ltd., National Housing and
Construction Corp., Laico Lake Victoria Hotel, Tamoil East
Africa Ltd. and OilLibya Co., according to the  Finance Ministry .  To contact the reporter on this story:
