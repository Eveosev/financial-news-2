The University of  North Carolina 
and the University of  Kansas  reached the final eight of the
men’s national college basketball tournament with lopsided
victories.  Tyler Zeller had 27 points as North Carolina (29-7)
defeated Marquette 81-63 at the Prudential Center in Newark, New
Jersey. Kansas (35-2) won 77-57 against Richmond.  North Carolina will play the winner of tonight’s later East
Region game in Newark between top-seeded Ohio State and seven-
time national champion Kentucky.  The next opponent for Kansas in the Southwest Region at the
Alamodome in San Antonio will be Virginia Commonwealth or
Florida State, who play later tonight.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
