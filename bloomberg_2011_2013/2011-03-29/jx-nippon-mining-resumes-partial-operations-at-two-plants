JX Nippon Mining & Metals Co. said
its processing plants in Ibaraki prefecture resumed partial
operations after the March 11 earthquake.  The company’s Hitachi plant resumed partial production from
March 24 and part of its Isohara plant started operations from
last week, the company said in a  statement  on its website. The
two processing plants produce electronics parts.  Another Isohara plant which makes products including
sputtering targets, used in the manufacturing of hard disks,
plans to resume partial output in April, the company said.  On March 24, JX Nippon Mining, a unit of JX Holdings Inc.,
said Pan Pacific Copper Co.,  Japan ’s biggest smelter of the
metal, is planning to resume operations at its Hitachi refinery
in April. The plant has an annual capacity of 120,000 metric
tons of copper. Pan Pacific is 66 percent owned by JX Nippon
Mining. The remainder is held by Mitsui Mining & Smelting Co.  JX Holdings fell 1.8 percent to 562 yen by 3 p.m. in  Tokyo ,
paring an earlier loss of as much as 3.3 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
