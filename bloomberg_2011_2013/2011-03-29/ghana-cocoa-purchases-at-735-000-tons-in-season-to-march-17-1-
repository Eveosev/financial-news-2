Ghana , the world’s second-biggest
cocoa producer, bought 735,000 metric tons of beans from farmers
in the 24 weeks of the season to March 17, said Ghana Cocoa
Board Deputy Chief Executive Officer Yaw Adu-Ampomah.  Purchases are about 200,000 tons higher than the same
period a year earlier, he said by phone today. In the week,
Ghana bought 7,000 tons of the key chocolate ingredient, he
said.  “Weekly purchases are falling compared to the previous
season, but we believe they will pick up again,” Adu-Ampomah
said. “I am just returning from a visit to some of the farms
and there is a lot of cocoa on the trees getting ready.”  Adu-Ampomah said the board’s target of 850,000 tons for the
entire 33 weeks of the major season is still on course. Some
50,000 tons will be bought during the minor harvest that spans
July to September, he said on March 15.  Ghana ’s total purchase
during 2009-10 was 632,000 tons.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
