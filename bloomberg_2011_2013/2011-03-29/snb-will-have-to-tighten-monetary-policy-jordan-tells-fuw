Switzerland ’s Swiss central bank
will have to raise interest rates at some point to maintain
 price stability  as the current level is “extremely
accommodative,” Swiss National Bank Vice President Thomas Jordan told  Finanz und Wirtschaft .  “With time,  monetary policy  has certainly to become more
restrictive to ensure that price stability is maintained in the
medium term,” Jordan said in a pre-release of an interview with
the Zurich-based newspaper to be published tomorrow. “Monetary
conditions are appropriate. But they are unbalanced. Interest
rates are at a very low level and extremely accommodative for
the domestic sector.”  Jordan also said the strength of the franc “poses a big
challenge for the export industry,” according to the newspaper.
The SNB is concerned about the franc’s gain against the dollar,
he said.  “Through the appreciation, monetary conditions are
becoming more restrictive which limits the room for the SNB to
normalize  interest rates ,” he said. “If the franc weakened
clearly, we should have to raise the interest-rate level.”  Jordan said currency purchases to stem the franc’s gains
were a “means in times of very high economic risks” and are
not much of a priority now.  “Today, it’s different,” he said. “The global economic
prospects are much better. Of course, we retain the option of
interventions, should economic developments necessitate that.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
