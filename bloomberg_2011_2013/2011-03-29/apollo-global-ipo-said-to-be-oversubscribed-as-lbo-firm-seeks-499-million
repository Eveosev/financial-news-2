Apollo Global Management LLCâ€™s
share sale has received more orders than the amount of stock
being offered, according to two people with knowledge of the
situation.  The deal will likely price at the top of the range, and may
price above the top end, said one of the people, who declined to
be identified because the information is private. 
Apollo, the New York-based private equity firm led by  Leon
Black , is scheduled to offer 26.3 million shares for $17 to $19
each today, according to a regulatory filing and data compiled
by Bloomberg.  The offering by Apollo aims to raise as much as $342
million for the firm and $157 million for existing shareholders,
according to its filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission. Underwriters may buy 3.94 million additional shares
from Apollo by exercising an overallotment option, the
prospectus showed.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
