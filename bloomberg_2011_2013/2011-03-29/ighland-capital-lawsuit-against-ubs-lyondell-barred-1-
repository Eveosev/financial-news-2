Highland Capital Management LP’s
2011 lawsuit claiming a  UBS AG (UBS) ’s securities unit punished it by
interfering with its loan in Lyondell Chemical Co.’s bankruptcy
is dismissed, a judge ruled.  U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Robert Gerber granted UBS’s motion to
dismiss the complaint in  Manhattan  bankruptcy court today, and
Highland will get nothing, according to a court order. Highland
had alleged that UBS failed to allocate a $150 million loan
Highland pledged to fund Lyondell’s exit from bankruptcy,
claiming “tortious interference” with its contract.  “There was no contract with Highland as a party with which
UBS tortiously interfered,” Gerber said in his ruling.  Highland, a Dallas-based debt manager, said in its
complaint that Lyondell accepted its $150 million loan offer
before UBS Securities LLC interfered to punish Highland over an
unrelated dispute. The UBS unit was an agent to lenders who took
part in a loan to fund Lyondell’s Chapter 11 exit.  “UBS, to further its own personal unrelated dispute with
Highland, refused to allocate any of the  term loan  to Highland,
and caused Lyondell to breach its contract,” according to the
complaint. “Such raw abuses of power disrupt the commercial
workings of the market and should be stopped and punished.”  LyondellBasell Industries NV (LYB) , based in Rotterdam, and its
U.S. unit, Lyondell Chemical Co., left Chapter 11 protection in
April 2010. Zurich-based UBS is a Swiss bank.  The case is Highland Capital v UBS, 11.1728,  U.S.
Bankruptcy Court , Southern District of  New York  (Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
