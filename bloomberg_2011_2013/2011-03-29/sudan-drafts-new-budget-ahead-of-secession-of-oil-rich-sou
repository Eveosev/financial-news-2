Sudan  is drafting a new budget as
oil-rich Southern Sudan prepares to declare independence in
July, state-run SUNA news agency reported, citing Finance
Minister Ali Mahmoud Abdel Rasoul.  Revenue and spending will be modified and issues related to
the south will be deleted from the budget, SUNA said yesterday.  After independence, Southern Sudan will assume control of
about three-quarters of the country’s current oil production of
490,000 barrels a day, pumped mainly by China National Petroleum
Corp., Malaysia’s Petroliam Nasional Bhd. and India’s Oil &
Natural Gas Corp.  While most of Sudan’s crude is produced in the land-locked
south, Sudan’s refineries and its only oil-export terminal at
 Port Sudan , on the  Red Sea , are in the north. The two regions
now share revenue from oil pumped in the south on a 50-50 basis,
under a 2005 peace agreement that ended a two-decade civil war.  Almost 99 percent of Southern Sudanese voters chose to
secede from the north and form an independent country in a
January referendum.  To contact the reporter on this story:
