Bankrupt companies’ costs rose 9.5
percent a year, or four times the inflation rate, as judges
approved almost 99 percent of the fees demanded by lawyers and
other professionals, according to  University of California , Los
Angeles professors Lynn LoPucki and Joseph Doherty.  Companies including  Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. (LEHMQ) , whose
fees to advisers have exceeded $1.2 billion during its
bankruptcy, and Enron Corp., “shop” for courts such as New
York and Delaware that rarely cut fees, LoPucki said in a phone
interview. About 68 percent of bankrupt companies are so-called
forum shoppers that pay 29 percent more to reorganize or
liquidate than debtors that stay in their home states, he said.  “Judges in general don’t do anything because if a court
cut fees, cases would no longer go there,” he said.  The money being spent by lawyers would otherwise go to
creditors, according to the professors’ book, “Professional
Fees in Corporate Bankruptcies.” The book, released this month
by  Oxford University Press , covers 102 cases from 1998 to 2007.  To contact the reporter on this story:
