Domtar Corp. (UFS) , the largest North
American maker of paper for computer printers and copiers, said
it will close part of an Arkansas mill and fire about 110
workers because of declining demand.  Shutting one of four paper machines at the Ashdown pulp and
paper mill will cut the company’s annual production capacity of
office paper, known as uncoated freesheet, by about 125,000
short tons, Montreal-based Domtar said today in a statement. The
closure will result in a pretax charge of about $80 million, the
company said.  “Domtar is committed to keeping a balance between its
supply and its customer demand,” Domtar Chief Executive Officer
 John Williams  said in the statement. “Because secular demand
decline in  North America  continues, we must permanently reduce
our uncoated freesheet paper production capacity.”  Electronic commerce and the rise of the Internet have cut
demand for office paper, forcing producers such as Domtar and
competitor  International Paper Co. (IP)  to reduce capacity.  Domtar rose C$1.35, or 1.6 percent, to C$87.87 at 3:59 p.m.
in Toronto Stock Exchange trading.  The shares  have risen 16
percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
