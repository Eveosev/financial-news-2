Turkish stocks fell after Goldman
Sachs cut estimates for the country’s banks and as concern
persisted about a partial meltdown at a nuclear plant in Japan.  The main  ISE National 100 index (XU100)  dropped 506.95, or 0.8
percent, to 63,754.38 at 11:37 a.m.  Turkiye Garanti Bankasi AS (GARAN) 
led losses, sliding 1.6 percent to 7.34 liras.  Goldman lowered price estimates for the six Turkish banks
it covers saying an increase in  reserve requirements  by the
central bank will hurt profit, according to an e-mailed report
today. Garanti was cut to “sell” from “neutral” and  Turkiye
Vakiflar Bankasi TAO (VAKBN)  was reduced to “neutral” from “buy,”
Goldman said. Investors should buy banks outside of Turkey
including OAO  Sberbank of Russia (SBER) , it said.  “Earnings will come under further pressure following a
substantial increase in reserve requirement ratios,” Goldman
said.   Last week the central bank increased the reserves banks
need to set aside for the third time since the start of
December, raising the ratio to as much as 15 percent for
deposits of one month or less from 10 percent. The measures are
needed to curb lending and ensure financial stability, the bank
said on March 23.  Goldman has cut earnings estimates for Turkish banks by an
average of 6 percent between 2011 and 2013, the report said.
 Turkiye Is Bankasi (ISATR)  AS’s share price estimate was lowered to 5
liras from 5.5 liras and  Akbank TAS (AKBNK) , part-owned by Citigroup
Inc., to 6 liras from 6.7 liras.  “We find more value outside Turkey, particularly in
Sberbank, where improving earnings power is yet to be fully
captured by valuation multiples,” Goldman said.  Akbank TAS lost 1.3 percent to 7.42 liras. Vakiflar
decreased 1 percent to 3.80 liras. Sberbank gained 0.3 percent
to 3.75 liras in Moscow.  Japan’s Prime Minister  Naoto Kan  said for the first time
that a damaged nuclear plant’s tsunami defenses were inadequate,
while reassuring the public that radiation leaks pose no health
threat beyond an evacuation zone.  The lira was little changed at 1.56130 per dollar. Yields
on benchmark two-year bonds were unchanged at 9 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
