Croatian Prime Minister Jadranka
Kosor said the government will cap individual holdings in INA
Industrija Nafte d.d. at 49 percent, state news agency HINA
reported today.  Kosor said she would suggest changes in the privatization
law related to the refiner on April 2, HINA said. Kosor was
speaking to reporters in Arzano, southern  Croatia , according to
HINA.  INA is controlled by Hungary’s Mol Nyrt, which holds a
47.26 percent stake in the company, while the Croatian
government owns 44.84 percent of the country’s largest refiner.  Croatia’s market regulator on March 28 suspended trade in
INA’s shares until April 1. It said it acted “following
significant trading by foreign investors” and to protect INA’s
shareholders.  To contact the reporter on this story: Jasmina Kuzmanovic at
