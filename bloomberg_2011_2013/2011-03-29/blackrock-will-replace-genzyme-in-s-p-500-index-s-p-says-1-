BlackRock Inc. (BLK) , the world’s largest
money manager, will replace  Genzyme Corp. (GENZ)  in the Standard &
Poor’s 500 Index after the close of trading on April 1, S&P said
in a statement.  Shares of New York-based BlackRock rose 5 percent to
$195.75 at 5:59 p.m.  New York  time. Companies added to the
benchmark index of U.S. stocks usually rally because investment
firms that track the measure have to purchase the shares.  BlackRock became the largest money manager in 2009 after
buying the investment unit of London-based Barclays Plc. The
purchase boosted assets to $3.56 trillion and helped the company
more than double net income to $2.06 billion last year.
Investors have withdrawn $121 billion from BlackRock funds in
the past year, helping drive the shares down 15 percent.  The S&P 500 change is being made because  Sanofi-Aventis SA (SAN) 
of Paris is buying Cambridge, Massachusetts-based Genzyme, S&P
said in the statement.  BlackRock has a stock-market value of $35.8 billion, bigger
than 420 of 500 companies in the index, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. Genzyme is valued at $20 billion.  To contact the reporter on this story:
