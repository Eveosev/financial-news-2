Uranium spot prices rose 4.2
percent in a slower market last week following “chaotic”
trading in the wake of  Japan ’s biggest earthquake that damaged
nuclear reactors.  Uranium-oxide concentrate for immediate delivery gained
$2.50 to $62.50 a pound in the seven days ended yesterday,  Ux
Consulting Co.  said in an e-mailed report today. The price is
based on the most competitive offer tracked by the Roswell,
Georgia-based company.  “The spot uranium market slowed for the second week in a
row with respect to overall volume and price movements, but
still exhibited decent volume and the price moved in a couple of
directions,” Ux said in the report.  A magnitude-9 earthquake and ensuing tsunami on March 11
that damaged Japan’s Fukushima Dai-Ichi plant and caused
radiation leaks triggered selling of the nuclear fuel, which is
down $7.25 from the start of the month, according to Ux. The
world’s worst nuclear crisis since Chernobyl in 1986 prompted
officials in  China  and  India  to call for reviews of atomic
energy programs.  Nuclear-power utilities buy the bulk of their uranium for
processing into fuel from mining companies, with the contracts
mostly extending beyond a year. The market for immediate
delivery, or  spot market , allows trading for delivery within a
year and includes financial investors. The U.S. government also
periodically conducts auctions to reduce stocks.  To contact the reporter on this story:
