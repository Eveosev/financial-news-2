U.S. stocks rose, sending the
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index to a three-week high, as energy and
consumer shares rallied and the equity measure rebounded from a
level watched by chart analysts. Treasuries declined as the
government sold $35 billion of five-year notes.  The  S&P 500  climbed 0.7 percent to 1,319.44 at 4 p.m. in
 New York . It advanced after falling to 1,305.26, compared with
yesterday’s 50-day average of 1,306.11, a bullish sign to some
traders. Yields on five-year notes added five basis points to
2.23 percent. The yen fell to 116.39 per euro, the weakest level
since May, amid speculation central banks in Europe and the U.S.
may curtail stimulus measures. Crude oil rose 0.8 percent to
$104.79 a barrel, breaking a three-day losing streak.  Home Depot Inc. (HD)  rallied after selling $2 billion in debt to
help fund stock buybacks, while  Schlumberger Ltd. (SLB)  helped lead
energy stocks higher as oil rose and  Baker Hughes Inc. (BHI)  Chief
Executive Officer Chad Deaton said  Saudi Arabia  will deploy more
drilling rigs. Equities climbed three days before a government
report forecast to show U.S. nonfarm payrolls rose 190,000.  “We found support at the 50-day moving average today,”
said  Donald Selkin , the New York-based chief market strategist
at National Securities Corp., which manages $3 billion. “We
should continue like this until we get the jobs report on
Friday, which may or may not break us out of this range.”  32-Month High  The S&P 500 closed at a 32-month high of 1,343.01 on Feb.
18 before falling to 1,256.88 on March 16. It dropped below its
50-day average at least four times today, rebounding within
three minutes each time, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The advance by U.S. shares reversed losses in the
MSCI All-Country World Index of stocks in 45 nations, which
climbed 0.2 percent after declining 0.5 percent earlier.  Home Depot rose 2.9 percent while Schlumberger advanced 4.4
percent.  AK Steel Holding Corp. (AKS)  gained 5.2 percent as SAC
Capital Advisors LP reported a stake.  Apollo Group Inc. (APOL) , owner
of the biggest U.S. for-profit college, fell 4.3 percent
following lower enrollment.  Yields on five-year Treasury notes climbed for a ninth day
in the longest losing streak since Lehman Brothers Holdings
Inc.’s bankruptcy in as the government paid the highest yield at
a five-year debt auction since April 2010. At the $35 billion
sale, the notes drew a yield of 2.260 percent, higher than the
average forecast of 2.246 percent in a Bloomberg News survey of
eight primary dealers.  Portugal,  Greece   Two-year notes issued by Portugal and Greece slumped after
the nations’ ratings were cut by S&P, which said the European
Union’s new bailout rules may mean that both eventually renege
on their debt obligations. S&P cut  Portugal  for the second time
in a week to the lowest investment-grade rating of BBB-, three
steps below Ireland. Greece’s rating fell two grades to BB-,
three levels below investment grade.  Yields on Portugal’s two-year note yield surged 30 basis
points to 7.73 percent, while comparable Greek debt jumped 42
basis points to 15.36 percent.  Japan ’s currency weakened against all of its major
counterparts as St. Louis Federal Reserve President  James Bullard  said signs of an improving economy may lead the central
bank to curtail debt buying.  New Zealand ’s dollar was the top
currency against the yen after posting its first  trade surplus 
in eight months.  Brazil ’s real was the second-best performer
even as the country imposed a tax designed to stem gains.  The yen weakened 1.1 percent to 116.35 per euro. It
declined 1 percent to 82.47 per dollar.  Europe ’s shared currency
traded at $1.4108, compared with $1.4087 yesterday.  Energy stocks in the S&P 500 advanced 1 percent, the
second-biggest gain among 10 industries, as oil rallied. Crude
had fallen 1.7 percent during the previous three days. Deaton,
the CEO of Baker Hughes, said Saudi Arabia will increase the
number of deployed drilling rigs to 118, a 28 percent boost.
