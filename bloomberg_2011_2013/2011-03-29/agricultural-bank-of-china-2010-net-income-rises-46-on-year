Agricultural Bank of China Ltd. (601288) ,
the nation’s fourth-largest lender, rose the most in six weeks
in Hong Kong trading after posting a bigger-than-estimated
increase in fourth-quarter profit as loan margins widened.  The stock gained 2.7 percent to close at HK$4.24 as net
income jumped 83 percent to 24.7 billion yuan ($3.8 billion) in
the quarter from a year earlier. Profit beat the 21 billion yuan
average estimate of 17 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  Agricultural Bank, which in August completed a record $22.1
billion initial public offering, boosted lending 20 percent last
year even as China’s government stepped up efforts to contain
credit growth. The company’s net interest margin widened by 19
basis points in the three months ended Dec. 31 to 2.77 percent,
according to Credit Suisse Group AG.  “As a result of the tight monetary environment in  China ,
we expect ABC will continue to benefit from expanding net
interest margins in 2011,”  Michael Werner , a Hong Kong-based
analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., wrote in a note today.  Agricultural Bank’s full-year profit climbed 46 percent to
94.9 billion yuan after the July IPO bolstered capital, allowing
it to lend more.  Net interest income rose 33 percent to 242 billion yuan
last year, while income from fee-based services gained 29
percent to 46.13 billion yuan. Net interest margin, a measure of
lending profitability, expanded 29 basis points to 2.57 percent
last year. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  Zhang Optimistic  President Zhang Yun said in Beijing today that he’s
optimistic about the 2011 growth outlook because greater pricing
power and higher fee income will make up for slower lending.  Set up in 1951 by  Mao Zedong  to finance rural cooperatives,
Agricultural Bank was the first Chinese  commercial lender 
established during Communist rule. It had 350 million customers
and 23,486 outlets at the end of December in China, more than
any other Chinese bank.  More than half of Agricultural Bank’s outlets are in the
countryside. Those operations accounted for about 30 percent of
total pretax profit last year. Loan growth and margins at rural
operations exceeded those at Agricultural Bank’s urban business,
the lender said yesterday in a statement.  Even so, Agricultural Bank has the smallest ratio of
“buy” recommendations from analysts among the nation’s five
largest state-owned banks, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg, on concern that a crackdown on loans to local
governments will weaken its capital.  Lower Capital Adequacy  China’s requirement that banks assign risk weightings of as
much as 300 percent for loans to local governments that aren’t
fully backed by  cash flow  will reduce the banking industry’s
capital adequacy ratio by 0.76 percentage point, according to an
estimate from BoCom International Ltd. Agricultural Bank and
China Construction Bank Corp. are among the most affected,
according to BoCom analyst  Li Shanshan .  Agricultural Bank had 100 billion yuan of non-performing
loans as of Dec. 31, accounting for 2.03 percent of total
credits, according to the statement. That was above the 1.14
percent average among local banks, data from the banking
regulator show.  Stress tests carried out by the bank show that a drop of at
least 50 percent in property prices would boost the bad-debt
ratio in its mortgage loan portfolio by about 1 percentage point,
Executive Vice President Guo Haoda said in  Hong Kong  today.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
