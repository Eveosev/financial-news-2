Czech Industry and Trade Minister
Martin Kocourek said he is “resolutely” opposed to extending
the taxation of carbon-dioxide emissions beyond 2013.  “I’m resolutely against that,” Kocourek said in an
interview today after a presentation in  Prague  when asked
whether the government is considering extending the temporary
carbon tax. “If I’m the minister it won’t happen.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
