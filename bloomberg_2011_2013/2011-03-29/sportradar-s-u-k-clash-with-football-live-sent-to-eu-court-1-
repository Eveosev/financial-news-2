A dispute over the online use of
soccer scores and match data has been sent to the European
Union’s highest court by the U.K. Court of Appeal.  The EU Court of Justice should give its view on the
application of region-wide database laws in the clash between
U.K. soccer database Football Live and  Sportradar AG , a Swiss-
registered company that provides data to the betting industry,
the London-based court said today.  Football Live, owned by Football Dataco Ltd, the Scottish
Premier League Ltd, the Scottish Football League and the U.K.’s
Press Association, allege that Sportradar is using their
information without authorization, according to the ruling. It
provides live data on information about matches while they are
in progress, such as goals, scorer, penalties and substitutions.  While the data Football Live compiles isn’t subject to U.K.
copyright rules as it relates to “matters of pure fact,” the
Luxembourg court should give guidance on EU database law,
according to today’s decision.  “All our clients are doing is obtaining the data though
public sources,” Peter Brownlow, a lawyer for Sportradar at
Bird & Bird LLP in  London , said in a telephone interview.  Football Live’s lawyers, DLA Piper, didn’t immediately
respond to a message seeking comment.  The case is Football Dataco & ors -and- Sportradar GmbH &
Ors, Court of Appeal, London, Case no: A3/2010/2849 and 2947.  To contact the reporter on this story:
