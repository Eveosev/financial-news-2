Banco Santander SA (SAN) , Spain’s biggest
lender, purchased 96 percent of Poland’s  Bank Zachodni WBK SA (BZW) 
for 3.99 billion euros ($5.62 billion) from Allied Irish Banks
Plc.  Banco Santander will also buy 50 percent of BZ WBK Asset
Management from Allied Irish for 150 million euros in cash, the
Madrid-based lender said in a statement today.  Allied Irish agreed in September to sell its 70 percent
stake in Poland’s third-largest lender by market value after it
was ordered to bolster a balance sheet depleted by Ireland’s
economic slump and real-estate losses.  Santander said on Feb. 7 it made a bid to acquire 100
percent of the Polish lender. Santander, which won Polish
regulatory approval to buy the stake on Feb. 18, is expanding in
 Poland  as its domestic market struggles to emerge from the worst
recession in 60 years.  To contact the reporters on this story:
