Turkey ’s government proposed
legislation giving it power to rule by decree and establishing
four new ministries, Milliyet said.  The draft law sent to the Ankara parliament would give the
government six months during which the Cabinet can issue decrees
with the force of law, the newspaper said. The country is due to
hold nationwide parliamentary elections on June 12.  The measure would also upgrade four state ministries to
full executive ministries, giving the officials in charge more
power over their own budgets, Milliyet said. The changes would
be to the economy, women’s affairs, social security and sport
portfolios, it said.  Click here for web link  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
