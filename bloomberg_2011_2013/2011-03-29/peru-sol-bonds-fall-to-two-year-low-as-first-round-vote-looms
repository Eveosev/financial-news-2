Peruvian sol bonds fell, pushing up
yields to a two-year high, on concern opposition presidential
candidate Ollanta Humala may win the first round of elections on
April 10.  The yield on Peru’s benchmark 7.84 percent sol-denominated
bond due August 2020 rose five basis points, or 0.05 percentage
point, to 6.72 percent at today’s close, according to Citigroup
Inc’s local unit. The bond’s price fell 0.36 centimo to 107.77
centimos per sol, the lowest since March 2009.  Humala, chief of Peru’s nationalist party and an ally of
 Venezuela ’s  Hugo Chavez , took the lead in presidential polls
published March 27, causing the Peruvian sol and stocks to drop
the most in 21 months yesterday. Investors are concerned Humala
could win the second round vote on June 5 and adopt policies
that may deter foreign investment, said Pedro Tuesta, a
Washington-based Latin America economist at 4Cast Inc.  “The base case scenario is that Humala will be more
statist like Lula in  Brazil ,” Tuesta said. “The worst case
scenario is that he would have policies that are closer to
Chavez in Venezuela. The market is being cautious.”  The Peruvian sol held near a three-month low of 2.8145 per
 U.S. dollar , little changed from 2.8141 yesterday.  The sol has declined 1.6 percent in the past three weeks,
the worst performance among 25 emerging-market currencies
tracked by Bloomberg.  Peru ’s central bank offered to sell 200 million soles
($71.1 million) of sol-indexed certificates of deposit today but
didn’t receive any bids, the bank said on its website. The
central bank sold 300 million soles of the certificates
yesterday to stem declines in the sol.  To contact the reporter on this story:
