European stocks fell, with the
Stoxx Europe 600 Index snapping a four-day rally, as banks
retreated and investors awaited reports on U.S. consumer
confidence and real-estate prices. U.S. futures rose and Asian
shares were little changed.  Unione di Banche Italiane ScpA tumbled the most in more
than two years as  Italy ’s fourth-biggest bank said it plans to
offer new shares.  Commerzbank AG (CBK) ,  Germany ’s second-largest
lender, slid 3.1 percent. Banco Popolare Scrl, Italy’s third-
biggest bank, fell 6.2 percent as Goldman Sachs Group Inc.
slashed its price estimate on the shares 5.2 percent.  The Stoxx 600 retreated 0.5 percent to 274.81 at 10:22 a.m.
in  London . Futures contracts on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index
expiring in June rose 0.2 percent. The MSCI Asia-Pacific Index
was little changed.  “The European banking sector still needs capital and this
process isn’t finished,”  Philippe Gijsels , the Brussels-based
head of research at BNP Paribas Fortis Global Markets, said in a
telephone interview. “There’s added fragility with banks ahead
of the stress tests. There have also been some disappointing
figures on the  U.S. economy  recently and the whole recovery
remains weak.”  The Stoxx 600 has clawed back 4.8 percent since this year’s
low on March 16 as investors speculated that Japan will prevent
further radiation leaks from its stricken nuclear plant. Concern
that Arab revolts in the Middle East and North Africa will
disrupt oil supplies and the strongest earthquake on record in
Japan dragged stocks down 10 percent from Feb. 17 through March
16.  S&P/Case-Shiller Index  Still, the gauge has soared 75 percent, or 89 percent
including reinvested dividends, since its March 2009 low as the
 Federal Reserve  bought bonds in an effort to boost the global
economy and corporate profits beat estimates. The index has lost
0.4 percent so far this year.  The S&P/Case-Shiller index of property values in 20 cities
fell 3.2 percent from January 2010, the biggest 12-month
decrease since November 2009, according to the median forecast
of 29 economists surveyed by Bloomberg News before the report
due at 9:00 a.m. New York time. The New York-based Conference
Board’s consumer confidence gauge, due at 10:00 a.m., fell to 65
from 70.4 in March, according to the survey median.  Goldman Sachs on  Japan   Japan’s economy will shrink in the April-to-June quarter in
the aftermath of power cuts and damage from the earthquake,
Goldman Sachs Group Inc. economists said. Gross domestic product
will rise 0.7 percent in the 2011 fiscal year, less than the
previous prediction of 1.3 percent, Goldman Sachs analysts
including Tokyo-based Naohiko Baba and Chiwoong Lee wrote in a
report today. The economists boosted their projection for 2012
to 2.5 percent growth compared with 2.1 percent before. The
fiscal year begins April 1.  “There are plenty of reasons for investors to look
nervous,” James McCaughan, chief executive officer of Principal
Global Investors LLC, said in a Bloomberg Television interview
with Francine Lacqua in London. “But, the uncertainty has not
been enough to derail a very strong business cycle in the U.S.
particularly.”  Unione di Banche Italiane SCPA (UBI)  dropped 9.4 percent to 6.23
euros as Chief Executive Officer Victor Massiah said the bank’s
proposed share sale wasn’t requested by the  Bank of Italy  and
won’t be used for acquisitions. Banks from Nomura Holdings Inc.
to  Societe Generale (GLE)  and Intermonte SIM SpA downgraded the
shares.  Banco Popolare Scrl fell 6.2 percent to 2.11 euros as
Goldman Sachs slashed its price estimate to 2.75 euros from 2.9
Euros.  Bank Stocks  A gauge of bank stocks on the Stoxx 600 fell 1.2 percent,
the biggest drop among the 19 industry groups on the measure.
Commerzbank retreated 3.1 percent to 5.58 euros.  Nordex SE (NDX1)  slumped 6 percent to 8.80 euros. The company is
selling 6.68 million shares in an accelerated bookbuild and will
use the proceeds to invest in research and development.  Hugo Boss AG (BOS)  climbed 4.2 percent to 57.02 euros after
saying that after “a successful start to 2011,” the group
forecasts currency-adjusted sales to grow at least 12 percent.
Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization
and excluding special items are expected to rise at least 15
percent this year, the company said.  Wolseley gained 2.7 percent to 2,146 pence as fiscal first-
half earnings jumped to 275 million pounds ($440 million) after
cutting costs and benefiting from higher sales volumes. CA
Cheuvreux analysts predicted so-called trading profit of 241
million pounds, while Liberum Capital Ltd. estimated 235 million
pounds.  Groupe Eurotunnel SA (GET) , which operates the undersea rail link
between England and  France , gained 2.7 percent to 7.38 euros
after Morgan Stanley upgraded the shares to “overweight” from
“equalweight.”  Babcock International Group Plc (BAB)  climbed 2.9 percent to
594.5 pence as the company said trading for the full year is
“consistent” with its expectations.  To contact the reporter on this story:
