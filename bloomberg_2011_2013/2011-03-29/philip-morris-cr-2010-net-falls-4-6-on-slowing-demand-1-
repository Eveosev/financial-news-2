Philip Morris  CR, a Czech tobacco
maker, said profit fell 4.6 percent last year as higher
unemployment prompted customers to switch to cheaper brands and
hand-rolled cigarettes.  Net income fell to 2.39 billion koruna ($137 million) from
2.506 billion in 2009, the Kutna Hora-based company said in an
e-mailed statement today. Revenue dropped 2.5 percent to 11.4
billion.  While the Czech economy emerged from recession last year,
the export-driven recovery has failed to reduce unemployment,
which was at 9.6 percent in February, almost double the level
two years ago. Shipments of goods in the  Czech Republic  dropped
7.9 percent and total shipments including exports were down 3.4
percent, the company said.  “The Czech Republic continued to face adverse economic
conditions, resulting in a significant drop in domestic
cigarette consumption, as consumers increasingly shifted to
cheaper tobacco alternatives,” the company said.  Philip Morris’s share of the Czech market declined 1.5
percentage points to 54 percent, the company said, citing
research conducted by A.C.Nielsen.  The management proposes to pay a dividend of 1,260 koruna
per share from 2010 profit and from that retained from earlier
years, the company said. The proposal will be submitted to
shareholders for approval at a meeting called for April 29.  Philip Morris rose 610 koruna, or 6.3 percent, to 10,300
koruna, a two-month high.  To contact the reporter on this story:
