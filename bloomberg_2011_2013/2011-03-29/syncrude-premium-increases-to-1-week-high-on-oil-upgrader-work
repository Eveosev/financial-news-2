Syncrude oil strengthened with
 Suncor Energy Inc. (SU)  expected to conduct maintenance on an oil-
sands upgrader in May and refiners increasing rates as peak U.S.
driving season approaches.  Suncor is planning seven weeks of maintenance on its oil-
sands upgrader No. 2 in  Alberta  starting in May, company
officials said on a conference call with investors Feb. 2.
 Canadian Natural Resources Ltd. (CNQ)  said March 3 that it would be
months before full production returns at the 110,000-barrel-a-
day Horizon upgrader in Alberta after a Jan. 6 fire.  The premium for Syncrude against benchmark West  Texas 
Intermediate crude rose $1.50 to $12.50 a barrel at 2:26 p.m. in
New York, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. That’s the
highest level since March 21.  Refinery rates may have risen last week for the fifth
consecutive time as plants finish seasonal maintenance.  U.S. plant use increased 0.7 percentage point to 84.1
percent of total capacity in the week ending March 18, according
to the Energy Department. Rates are expected to increase another
0.3 percentage point in the latest report to be released at
10:30 a.m. tomorrow in  Washington , according to the median
estimate of 13 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg News.  Light Louisiana Sweet’s premium narrowed 20 cents to $13.25
a barrel. Heavy Louisiana Sweet’s premium to WTI weakened 25
cents to $12.75.  Among Gulf Coast sour, or high-sulfur, grades, Mars Blend
weakened 30 cents to $6.80 a barrel over WTI, while Poseidon’s
premium narrowed 5 cents to $7.  Thunder Horse’s premium to WTI rose 50 cents to $10.75.
Southern Green Canyon weakened 20 cents to $6.30 over.  West Texas Sour’s discount widened 5 cents to $3.25. WTS is
delivered in Midland, Texas, so its price is less influenced by
imports.  To contact the reporter on this story:
