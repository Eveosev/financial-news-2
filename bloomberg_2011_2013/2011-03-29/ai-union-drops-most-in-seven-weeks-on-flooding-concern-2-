Thai Union Frozen Products Pcl (TUF) , the
country’s largest seafood exporter, fell by the most in seven
weeks in Bangkok trading on concern flooding in the nation’s
south will increase costs and erode earnings from shrimp sales.  Thai Union dropped 3.7 percent to 45.75 baht at the 4:30
p.m. close, the steepest decline since Feb. 8. The stock was the
fourth-worst performer in the 479-member SET Index, which rose
0.3 percent.  Flooding in six southern provinces killed seven people
since March 23, according to  data  on the Department of Disaster
Prevention and Mitigation’s website. Local shrimp prices may
rise because of the flooding in the south, Thai Union President
Thiraphong Chansiri said in an interview yesterday.  The flooding will raise prices of shrimp over the next few
months, cutting Thai Union’s profit margins, Asia Plus
Securities wrote in a note to clients today. Thai Union buys
about 60 percent of its shrimp supplies from farms in the
southern region, the brokerage said.  The company is “closely monitoring” the flooding in the
southern provinces, the country’s biggest shrimp farming areas,
Thiraphong said yesterday. Shrimp prices will probably rise
further because the flooding will cut supply from the region, he
said. Thiraphong was not available for comment after a call to
his office today.  Heavy rains will continue to cause flash flooding in
certain areas in the southern region over the next few days,
according to a warning  statement  on the Thai Meteorological
Department website dated today.  -- Editors:  Garry Smith , Vipin Nair  To contact the reporter on this story:
