European Central Bank Executive
Board member Juergen Stark said it is time for monetary policy
to move “step by step in the direction of normality,”
 Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung  reported, citing an interview.  “We cannot keep  interest rates  at this level for a long
period of time, particularly in combination with extraordinary
credit assistance,” Stark was quoted by the newspaper as
saying. He said the bank’s outlook on interest rates hasn’t
changed as a result of the Japan earthquake, FAZ reported.  “Uncertainty has increased, but that has not changed our
overall assessment,” FAZ quoted Stark as saying. The ECB is
concerned with avoiding the “negative effects” of a monetary
policy that has become “very accommodative,” he said.  Stark added that the Irish central bank’s Emergency
Liquidity Assistance program for banks “cannot be a permanent
state of affairs,” the newspaper said. He also said the ECB is
opposed to Ireland making bank bondholders share in the costs of
any restructuring, FAZ reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
