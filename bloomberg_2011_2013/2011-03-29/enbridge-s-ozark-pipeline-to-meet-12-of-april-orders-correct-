Enbridge Inc. (ENB)  said its Ozark
pipeline, which moves heavy and low-sulfur oils between Cushing,
Oklahoma, and Wood River,  Illinois , will be able to meet 12
percent of requests for transport next month.  Producers, traders and refiners will move 231,846 barrels a
day on the Ozark line, compared with 1.89 million barrels a day
in nominations, Larry Springer, a spokesman for  Canada ’s largest
pipeline company, said today in an e-mail. Ozark was scheduled
to move 232,425 barrels a day in March, when it was considered
full although not apportioned.  Enbridge’s  Spearhead  oil pipeline, which transports mostly
heavy Canadian oil in the central U.S., isn’t apportioned and
has capacity available, he said. Initial nominations were
139,184 barrels a day out of a capacity of 165,377.  Shippers sometimes inflate nominations to make sure they
obtain the space needed to transport their oil, and the company
must determine how many requests it can meet.  Spearhead was scheduled to move 157,405 barrels a day in
March, meeting 17 percent of shippers’ requests. The Spearhead
line spans 657 miles (1,058 kilometers) from  Chicago  to Cushing,
according to the company’s website.  Ozark is part of Enbridge’s  Mid-Continent System , which
includes more than 480 miles of oil pipelines and 12.8 million
barrels of storage, according to the company’s website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
