Harmony Gold Mining Co.,  Africa ’s
third-largest producer of the metal, said the company’s Wafi-
Golpu joint venture with  Newcrest Mining Ltd. (NCM)  in  Papua New
Guinea  may be three times the size of its next biggest mine.  Wafi may yield as much as an annual 700,000 ounces of gold
and 320,000 metric tons of copper, Harmony told analysts at the
site, according to a copy of the  presentation  posted today on
its website. The company is still working on establishing the
size of the resource, the Johannesburg-based mine operator said.  Harmony, which produced 1.43 million ounces of gold last
fiscal year, is digging mines abroad as depleted South African
reserves become more difficult and dangerous to excavate, and as
labor and electricity costs rise. In the financial year ended
June 30, Harmony’s Tshepong mine yielded about 217,000 ounces.  The company climbed 2.66 rand, or 2.7 percent, to 99.61
rand, the highest level since April 2, 2009, by the 5 p.m. close
of Johannesburg trading, giving Harmony a market value of 43
billion rand ($6 billion). Wafi may add $1.5 billion to $2
billion, or about 40 percent, to the value and make the company
a takeover target,  RBC Capital Markets  said last week.  Wafi’s content is estimated at 16 million gold ounces, 4.85
million metric tons of copper and 55,000 tons of molybdenum, or
a total gold equivalent of 38.5 million ounces, according to the
presentation, which added that only  Freeport-McMoran Copper &
Gold Inc. (FCX) ’s Grasberg mine in  Indonesia  and Ivanhoe Mines Ltd.’s
Oyu Tolgoi deposit in Mongolia have higher gold equivalent
grades. Harmony’s management last year estimated the cost of
building a mine at Wafi at $2.5 billion to $3 billion.  To contact the reporter on this story:
