The  New York Knicks  snapped a six-
game losing streak with a 113-106 overtime win against the
 Orlando Magic  behind 39 points from Carmelo Anthony, who had
called the game “almost a must win for us.”  The Knicks outscored the Magic 10-2 over the final three
minutes, 15 seconds of overtime last night at Madison Square
Garden in  New York .  “We had a will to win,” Anthony, who added 10 rebounds,
said in a televised interview. “We wanted it bad enough
tonight. We went out and got it. We knew we would get out of the
hole of this losing streak.”  Losers of nine of their previous 10 games, the Knicks
recovered after blowing a six-point lead in the final 1:05 of
the fourth quarter. The Magic forced overtime when Jason Richardson hit a 3-point shot with five seconds left to tie the
score 100-100.  In the five-minute overtime, the Knicks held a 108-106 lead
when Orlando’s  Dwight Howard  fouled out while going after an
offensive rebound. Howard, who led the Magic with 29 points and
18 rebounds, was then whistled for a technical foul after
throwing the ball in the backcourt in frustration.  Chauncey Billups, who had 17 points and six assists, hit
the ensuing foul shot and the Knicks sealed the victory with
four more free throws.  The Knicks (36-38), who are in position for a playoff berth
in seventh place in the Eastern Conference, halted their longest
losing streak of the season. The Magic fell to 47-27.  “If we can keep the intensity and the urgency right there,
then we can get out of this slump,” said Knicks coach  Mike D’Antoni , whose team is 8-12 since acquiring Anthony in a trade
with the  Denver Nuggets  last month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
