Givot Olam Exploration LP fell the
most in two weeks after the oil explorer said there will be a
“slight delay” in production tests at the Meged 5 drill site.  The shares retreated 3.1 percent, the most since March 15,
to 0.062 shekel at the 4:30 p.m. close in  Tel Aviv , giving the
Jerusalem-based explorer a market value of 655.3 million shekels
($186 million).  The delay was due to a decision to produce a component
needed for the tests locally rather than import it, the company
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
