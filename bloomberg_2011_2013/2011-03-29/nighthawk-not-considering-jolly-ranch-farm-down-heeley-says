Nighthawk Energy Plc (HAWK) , the shale oil
developer active the U.S., said it isn’t considering selling a
stake in its Jolly Ranch project to help meet its funding needs.  The Bristol, U.K.-based company last year exited all its
other projects to focus on the Colorado project, where it is a
50 percent partner with Running Foxes Petroleum Inc. Nighthawk
has raised more than 5 million pounds ($8 million) in equity in
the past year.  “At the moment, we don’t have enough money to fund the
next two years,” Chief Executive Officer Tim Heeley said in a
telephone interview. “We have an equity drawdown, and we’re
assessing how to grow successfully. We’d like to get as far as
we can as a joint venture. A farm down certainly isn’t on the
cards now.”  Jolly Ranch is more than 400,000 acres and may contain as
much as 13 billion barrels of oil in place, Heeley said. The
company is focused on developing Jolly Ranch after selling off
and writing down the value of all its other projects.  Nighthawk posted an operating loss of $23.9 million and
revenue of $1.3 million for the second half of 2010, the company
said in a statement in  London  today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
