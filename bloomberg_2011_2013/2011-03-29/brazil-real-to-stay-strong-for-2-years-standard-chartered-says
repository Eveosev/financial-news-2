Brazil ’s currency will likely
remain strong for the next two years even as the government
takes steps to contain gains, said Airton Villafranca, chief
executive officer of Standard Chartered Plc’s local unit.  “The real will remain strong,” Villafranca said at the
Bloomberg Brazil Economic Summit in  Sao Paulo  today. “The
government will continue taking measures to try to hold it down,
but I think it will continue trading between 1.65 and 1.68” per
dollar.  The real strengthened 0.3 percent to 1.6582 per dollar at 9
a.m. New York time.  To contact the reporter on this story:
