South Africa ’s President Jacob Zuma
has been badly advised since taking office and made the wrong
decision to back a no-fly zone in Libya, Julius Malema, leader
of youth league of the country’s ruling African National
Congress said, the Star reported.  “Since he got into power comrade Zuma has been surrounded
by bad advisers,” Malema told a youth league conference in the
north eastern province of Limpopo, the Johannesburg-based
newspaper said. “I’m dismayed and shocked at the way our
country makes its decisions.”  The youth league backs revolutionary leaders such as
Muammar Qaddafi of Libya,  Robert Mugabe  of Zimbabwe and Fidel
Castro of Cuba, he said, according to the newspaper.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
