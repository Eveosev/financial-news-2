Pret A Manger, a closely held U.K.
sandwich retailer, said sales last year rose 17 percent as it
opened new shops and sold more breakfast items such as hot
porridge.  Sales for the year ended December 2010 rose to 327.5
million pounds ($523.8 million) from 279.2 million pounds a year
earlier, the company said in an e-mailed statement. Earnings
before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization rose 37
percent to 46.1 million pounds. Sales at outlets open at least a
year grew 9.8 percent, compared with 2.6 percent growth the year
before.  Last year, Pret opened 33 new shops, of which seven were in
the U.S. and two in  Hong Kong , the retailer said. Pret is
selling more than 50,000  bowls of porridge  a week after
introducing the item in the spring last year.  “We are still seeing good momentum globally in our
business in the early part of the new financial year and we
intend to create over 700 new jobs in over 30 new shops around
the world this year,” Chief Executive Officer Clive Schlee said
in the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
