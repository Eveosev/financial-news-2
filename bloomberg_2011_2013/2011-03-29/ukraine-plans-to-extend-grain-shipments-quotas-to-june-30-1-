Ukraine will probably extend the
term of grain export quotas through the end of June and allow an
additional 2 million metric tons of corn shipments, according to
a draft government resolution.  Ukraine can export 5.8 million tons of grain in March,
April, May and June, the countryâ€™s Trade and Economy Ministry
said in a  statement  on its website today. Wheat accounts for 2.3
million tons and corn for 3.4 million tons of the possible
exports, according to the statement.  Ukraine imposed limits on outbound shipments of grain in
October last year, seeking to control domestic grain prices
after drought reduced harvests in Russia and Ukraine. The
current limit of 4.2 million tons runs to March 31.  Ukraine will supply 1.3 million tons of grain through
inter-government agreements, or outside quotas, the ministry
said. This will include about 800,000 tons of corn and 500,000
tons of wheat, according to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
