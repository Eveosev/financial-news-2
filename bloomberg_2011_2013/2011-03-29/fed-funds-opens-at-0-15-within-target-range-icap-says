Fed funds, the U.S. overnight
inter-bank lending rate, opened at 0.15 percent, within the
 Federal Reserve ’s target of zero to 0.25 percent.  Fed funds closed at 0.11 percent yesterday after trading
from 0.08 percent to 0.16 percent and averaging 0.13 percent,
ICAP Plc, the world’s largest inter-dealer broker, said in an e-
mailed statement.  The central bank will acquire Treasury Inflation Protected
Securities maturing from April 2013 to February 2041 today as
part of its plan to purchase $600 billion more in Treasuries
through June and reinvest its maturing mortgage holdings. The
Fed expects to reinvest $250 billion to $300 billion of proceeds
from mortgage-backed debt and agency securities into Treasuries
during that time.  The central bank plans to purchase from $1 billion to $2
billion of securities today, according to the New York Fed’s
website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
