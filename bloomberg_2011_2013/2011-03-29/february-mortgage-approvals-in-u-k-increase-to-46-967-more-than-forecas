U.K. mortgage approvals rose to
46,967 in February, the highest level since November and more
than economists forecast, suggesting the  property market  is
stabilizing.  The figure compares with an upwardly revised 46,152 in
January, the  Bank of England  said today in London. Economists
forecast 46,000, based on the median forecast of 15 economists
in Bloomberg News survey.  Recent house-price data have been mixed as a lack of supply
props up home values, while banks’ rationing of credit and
record low consumer confidence curb demand. The property market
may come under pressure as government spending cuts begin in
earnest and accelerating inflation stokes expectations the Bank
of England will raise  interest rates  by mid-year.  “Following a weak end to the year, mortgage approvals
appear to have picked up a little bit recently,”  Philip Shaw ,
an economist at Investec Securities Ltd. in  London , said before
the release. “Approval levels are still far from a level
indicative of a housing market recovery and well off the pre-
crisis 2006 high of 128,000.”  Separate figures showed the economy shrank 0.5 percent in
the fourth quarter, less than previously estimated, as services
and factory output was revised higher. Excluding the impact of
the coldest December in a century, growth was “broadly flat,”
the  Office for National Statistics  said today in London.  First-Time Buyers  The pound dropped as much as 0.1 percent after the reports
and was trading at $1.6017 as of 9:35 a.m. in London, up 0.2
percent on the day.  Chancellor of the Exchequer  George Osborne  said in his
budget last week that the government will help 10,000 first-time
buyers get interest-free loans of 20 percent of the value of the
property. Developers have said that sales have suffered because
first-time buyers can’t afford high deposits for new homes.  Today’s Bank of England figures show net mortgage lending
was 1.2 billion pounds ($1.9 billion) in February and gross
lending was 11.9 billion pounds. Consumer credit rose 768
million pounds, with borrowing on credit cards rising 96 million
pounds.  A measure of M4 money-supply growth that the central bank
uses to assess the effectiveness of its asset purchases slowed
to 0.5 percent in the three months through February on an
annualized basis from 3.2 percent in January. The gauge excludes
financial companies that specialize in intermediating between
banks, such as holding companies and non-bank credit grantors.  Total M4 fell 0.3 percent on the month and was down 1.5
percent on the year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
