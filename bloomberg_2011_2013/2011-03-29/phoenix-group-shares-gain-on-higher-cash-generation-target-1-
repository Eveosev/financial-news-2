Phoenix Group Holdings (PHNX)  Ltd., the
U.K.’s biggest manager of closed life-insurance funds, rose to
the highest in more than five months in London as it announced a
six-year cash flow target that beat analysts’ estimates.  The company plans to generate 3.2 billion pounds ($5.1
billion) of cash by 2016, London-based Phoenix said today in a
statement. It expects to reduce its leverage to less than
50 percent by the end of this year.  Phoenix, which buys books of life insurance contracts and
profits when policies expire, plans to reduce its 2.3 billion-
pound debt burden by generating cash from the policies it
already owns.  “Significantly improved operational cash flow projection
is not only materially above our own expectation, but also
lowers debt risk,” Deutsche Bank AG analyst Oliver Steel, who
has a “buy” rating on the stock, said in a note to clients
today. “The net  leverage ratio  can be reduced organically to
about 33 percent by end of 2016, removing the fear of a forced
capital raise.”  The shares rose to 696.5 pence, the highest since Oct. 20.
They were up 0.7 percent at 682.5 pence at 11:17 a.m. in London,
valuing the insurer at about 1.2 billion pounds.  “We are confident in the prospects for 2011 and beyond and
have set challenging new targets,” Chief Executive Officer
Clive Bannister said in the statement. “We will continue to
explore options with our lenders regarding the best structure
and timing for the restructuring of our banking facilities.”  Dividend Plan  The insurer said in November it aimed to remove a cap on
dividends imposed by its lenders before it makes future
acquisitions of life-insurance policies.  Phoenix generated 734 million pounds of cash in 2010,
compared with 716 million pounds the year before on a pro-forma
basis. The company will pay a dividend of 42 pence a share,
beating the 38 pence paid out for 2009.  Net income in 2010 fell to 30 million pounds, or 20.1 pence
a share, from 95 million pounds, or 89.8 pence, in 2009.  Assets under management overseen by the firm’s Glasgow,
Scotland-based Ignis fund unit increased by 600 million pounds
to 67.5 billion pounds, more than offsetting 5.4 billion pounds
of run-offs from the closed life funds.  To contact the reporters on this story:
