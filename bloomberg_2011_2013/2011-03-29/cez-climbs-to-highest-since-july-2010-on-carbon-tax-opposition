CEZ AS (CEZ) , the biggest power producer
in the Czech Republic, rose to its highest in more than nine
months after Industry and Trade Minister Martin Kocourek said he
opposes extending the Czech carbon tax paid by polluters.  The stock advanced for a fifth day, adding 1.8 percent to
895 koruna at 4:24 p.m. in  Prague , its highest close since June
22, valuing the utility at 481.5 billion koruna ($27.6 billion).  Kocourek said today he “resolutely” opposed extending the
period in which Czech polluters have to pay a new tax on carbon-
dioxide emission allowances awarded by the European Union as an
incentive to switch to more environment-friendly technologies.
The government imposed the tax last year for 2011 and 2012.  “Removing the tax could have a positive impact of about 15
koruna per CEZ share,” analyst Marek Hatlapatka at Cyrrus wrote
in an e-mail today. “This is the first time the government has
clearly expressed its position on future carbon taxation.”  Cyrrus brokerage in Brno,  Czech Republic , has an
“accumulate” recommendation for CEZ shares with a 12-month
price estimate of 970 koruna, according to a report to clients
dated today.  CEZ was raised to “neutral” from “underweight” at HSBC
Holdings Plc with a price estimate of 900 koruna today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
