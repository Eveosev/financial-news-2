South African  government bonds 
declined ahead of the release of credit and producer inflation
data as investors pared bets that borrowing costs will stay at a
30-year low the rest of the year.  The 13.5 percent bonds due 2015 fell 18 cents to 121.01
rand, driving the yield up 4 basis points, or 0.04 percentage
point, to 7.80 percent as of 5.58 p.m. in Johannesburg. Nine-
month forward rate agreements, used by investors to speculate on
interest rates, have climbed 5 basis points in the past two
days. The rand was little changed at 6.8638 per dollar, and lost
0.2 percent to 9.6603 per euro.  Producer inflation,  money supply  and private sector credit
data due tomorrow may indicate that inflation pressures are
building in  Africa ’s biggest economy, according to economist
surveys compiled by Bloomberg. Yields on the 2015 bonds have
fallen 17 basis points in the past two weeks through yesterday
on expectations the central bank will keep  interest rates  at a
30-year low.  “We’re seeing some position squaring before the data
releases,” Victor Mphaphuli, who helps manage about $45 billion
at Stanlib Asset Management, said by phone from Johannesburg.  Factory gate prices probably rose an annual 6.1 percent in
February, from 5.5 percent the month before, according to the
median estimate of 10 economists surveyed by Bloomberg. Private
sector credit probably grew 5.2 percent, from 5 percent, and the
broadest measure of money supply likely climbed 8.6 percent,
compared with 8.2 percent.  Demand for bonds at the weekly government bond auction fell
as yields approach a three-week low. The country sold 1.3
billion rand ($189 million) of 6.75 percent bonds due 2021 and
800 million of 8 percent bonds due 2018. Investors bid for 2.9
times the amount of longer-dated debt on offer, compared with
3.9 last week.  To contact the reporter on this story:
