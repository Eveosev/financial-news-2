German power for next year fell
from a 19-month high after coal prices dropped, signaling
cheaper fuel costs for generating plants in  Europe ’s biggest
electricity market.  The next-year power contract fell 30 cents, or 0.5 percent,
to 59.25 euros a megawatt-hour, according to broker prices
compiled by Bloomberg as of 5:47 p.m. in Berlin.  German utilities  E.ON AG (EOAN) ,  RWE AG (RWE)  and EnBW Energie Baden-
Wuerttemberg AG agreed to shut 25 percent of the country’s
nuclear capacity this month for a three-month safety review. The
government said yesterday that the country’s seven oldest
reactors may never reopen, pushing the benchmark next-year
contract to at 59.80 euros, its highest level since August 2009.  Electricite de France SA’s 1,330-megawatt Paluel 2 nuclear
reactor will restart today after it was halted yesterday,
boosting power supplies in northwest Europe, according to a
message on grid operator RTE’s website.  Coal for 2012 delivery to Amsterdam, Rotterdam or Antwerp
fell after two days of gains, dropping 1.3 percent to $129.75 a
metric ton.  Germany  generates about a fifth of its power from
hard coal. The country also gets electricity from lignite,
nuclear, natural gas, wind and solar plants.  European Union carbon permits for December fell 1.5 percent
to 17.03 euros a metric ton on the ICE Futures Europe exchange
in  London . They jumped yesterday to close at 17.29 euros, their
highest price since May 11, 2009.  Bloomberg tracks prices from brokers including ICAP Plc,
