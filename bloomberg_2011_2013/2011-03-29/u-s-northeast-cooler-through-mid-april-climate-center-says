The U.S. Northeast, upper Great
Plains and Pacific Northwest will probably have cooler-than-
normal temperatures from April 4 to 8, according to the U.S.
Climate Prediction Center.  The U.S. Gulf Coast will probably have warmer temperatures
while the rest of the nation remains about normal during the
period, according to the  climate center’s  6- to 10-day outlook
released today.  The area of cooler weather is expected to include the West
Coast and western New York State from April 6 to 12, according
to the center’s 8- to 14-day outlook.  The U.S. east of the  Mississippi River , with the exception
of southern  Florida , may receive more rain than normal from
April 4 to 8, the center said. The Pacific Northwest and
northern Alaska also have a chance for more rain.  The Southwest,  Texas , Colorado, Kansas and most of
Nebraska, as well as the western parts of Oklahoma and Iowa, all
have the probability to receive less rain than normal, according
to the center.  In the center’s 8- to 14-day outlook, the Ohio Valley into
the U.S. Northeast may receive more rain, as well as northern
Montana and  North Dakota .  To contact the reporter on this story:
