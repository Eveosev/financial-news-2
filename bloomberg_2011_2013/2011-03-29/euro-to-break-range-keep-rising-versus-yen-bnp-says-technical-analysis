The euro is poised to break out of
a nine-month trading range against the yen if it closes above a
key technical level, according to BNP Paribas SA.  The shared currency reached 116.24 yen today, the highest
level since May 14. The euro has traded within an 11-yen range
since June. If it closes above 116.10, it could appreciate to a
118.35 to 119.65 range against the Japanese currency, BNP
Paribas estimates. The 17-nation currency strengthened 1 percent
to 116.24 yen at 3:50 p.m. in  New York .  The euro has rallied 9 percent since it hit a six-month low
of 106.61 yen March 17, before the Group of Seven nations
jointly intervened in foreign-exchange markets for the first
time in more than a decade. G-7 central banks sold about $25
billion of yen after it reached a post-World War II high against
the dollar, endangering  Japan ’s recovery from its worst
earthquake on record.  “A firm close above 116.00 is the next thing to watch,”
said  Andrew Chaveriat , a technical analyst at BNP Paribas in New
York. “The intervention kick-started the dollar-yen rise, which
I see having spilled over into euro-yen.”  The euro will also be buoyed by rising U.S. Treasury
yields, which will drive up the shared currency along with the
dollar, Chaveriat said.  Yields on U.S. five-notes climbed for a ninth day in the
longest losing streak since before Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc.
collapsed in 2008, on speculation the  Federal Reserve  may begin
to curtail bond purchases.  To contact the reporter on this story:
