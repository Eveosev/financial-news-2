U.S. aviation regulators  suspended
an air-traffic controller who violated separation standards by
sending a  Southwest Airlines Co. (LUV)  jet too close to a small plane.  The controller in central Florida asked the Southwest crew
at 12,000 feet to fly closer to a single-engine Cirrus aircraft
to check on a crew that had been out of radio contact, the
 Federal Aviation Administration  said in a statement today. The
Southwest plane was heading to Orlando, Florida.  “The air traffic controller compromised the safety of
everyone involved,” FAA Administrator Randy Babbitt said of the
March 27 incident in the statement. The agency didn’t specify
how close the two aircraft came.  The suspension was the second of a controller announced by
the FAA since March 24. Two planes carrying a combined 154
passengers landed without tower assistance after midnight on
March 23 at  Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport  after
failing to make contact with a controller who told investigators
he had fallen asleep.  To contact the reporter for this story:
