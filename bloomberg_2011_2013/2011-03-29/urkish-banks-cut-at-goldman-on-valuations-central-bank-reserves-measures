Turkish banks had their price
estimates lowered at Goldman Sachs, which said valuations were
“relatively unattractive” and investors should invest in banks
outside  Turkey  including OAO  Sberbank of Russia. (SBER)   Goldman also cut  Turkiye Garanti Bankasi AS (GARAN)  and  Turkiye
Vakiflar Bankasi TAO (VAKBN)  to “neutral” citing the impact on
earnings of an increase in central bank reserve requirements.  “Earnings will come under further pressure following a
substantial increase in reserve requirement ratios,” Goldman
said in an e-mailed report today.    Turkiye Is Bankasi (ISATR)  AS’s price estimate was lowered to 5
liras from 5.5 liras and  Akbank TAS (AKBNK)  to 6 liras from 6.7 liras,
Goldman said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
