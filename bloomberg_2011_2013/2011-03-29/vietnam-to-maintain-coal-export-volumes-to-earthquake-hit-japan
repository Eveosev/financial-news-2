Vietnam will maintain coal
shipments to  Japan  at current levels even as demand has risen
following the March 11 earthquake, said the country’s dominant
exporter of the commodity.  “Japan is raising its demand for coal after the earthquake,
but we can’t meet their demand because we have to ensure
national  energy security ,” Nguyen Van Hai, deputy chief
executive officer of Vietnam National Coal-Mineral Industries
Group, said by phone today.  Japan may increase coal imports by about 17 percent this
year and oil purchases starting next quarter as it seeks
alternate fuels after its strongest recorded earthquake, Kenneth Courtis, a non-executive director at Hong Kong-based commodity
supplier Noble Group Ltd., said last week.  The state-owned Vietnamese company, known as  Vinacomin ,
plans to maintain its coal shipments to Japan at around 1.5
million metric tons in 2011, “about the same as last year,”
Hai said.  Vietnam ’s coal exports totaled 19.23 million tons last year,
of which more than 18 million tons came from Vinacomin,
according to the company.  --Nguyen Dieu Tu Uyen. Editors: Ryan Woo,  Jane Lee .  To contact the reporter on this story:
