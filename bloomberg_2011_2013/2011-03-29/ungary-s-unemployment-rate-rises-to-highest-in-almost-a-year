Hungary’s unemployment rate rose to
the highest level in almost a year in the December to February
period, the statistics office said.  The jobless rate rose to 11.5 percent from 10.7 percent in
the previous three-month period, the highest since February-
April last year, when it was at a record 11.8 percent, the
statistics office said in an e-mailed statement today. The
median estimate of 10 economists in a Bloomberg survey was 11.3
percent.  Hungarian Prime Minister  Viktor Orban  won elections last
year on a pledge to boost growth and create a million jobs in a
decade. He introduced a flat personal income- tax rate  this year
and cut the corporate tax rate to boost growth.  “By year’s end, we expect a 1 percent increase in the
employment rate and a corresponding jobless rate below 11
percent,” Economy Minister  Gyorgy Matolcsy  said in a speech in
Budapest today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
