Cash premiums for soybeans and corn
shipped this month to terminals near  New Orleans  fell relative
to Chicago futures as exporters slowed purchases before
government inventory and acreage reports on March 31.  The spot-basis bid, or premium, for soybeans delivered this
month at  Gulf of Mexico  ports was 56 cents to 70 cents a bushel
above May futures, compared with 58 cents to 70 cents yesterday,
U.S. Department of Agriculture  data  show. The corn basis fell to
50 cents to 51 cents from 50 cents to 53 cents a bushel.  “It was quiet with the exporters and processors waiting
for the USDA reports,” said Bryce Stremming, a commodity-risk
consultant at Mid-Co Commodities Inc. in Bloomington,  Illinois .
“People have talked themselves into thinking the USDA will
estimate corn and soybeans supplies are larger than expected”
after prices last month rose to the highest since 2008, limiting
consumption, he said.  Soybean futures for May delivery gained 13 cents, or 1
percent, to $13.615 a bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade, the
biggest gain in more than a week.  Corn futures for May delivery rose 0.75 cent to $6.7175 a
bushel, the first increase in three days.  To contact the reporter on this story:
