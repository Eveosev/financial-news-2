Banks in  Mexico  are increasing peso
bond sales at the fastest pace in nine years to finance loans as
the U.S. recovery bolsters growth in Latin America’s second-
largest economy.  Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria SA and Banco Santander SA
helped boost lenders’ debt offerings 335 percent to 70.9 billion
pesos ($5.9 billion) in the past year, the biggest 12-month
advance since the period ending in March 2002, data compiled by
Bloomberg show. The local unit of Santander, Mexico’s third-
largest bank by outstanding loans, sold 1.7 billion pesos of
bonds due in 2021 on March 16 to yield 8.91 percent, or 135
basis points above similar-maturity government debt.  “The underlying element here is that we expect a sizable
expansion of credit in Mexico,” Ernesto Gallardo, deputy chief
financial officer at BBVA Bancomer SA, the nation’s largest
bank, said in a telephone interview in Mexico City. Mexico’s
lending may expand this year as much as 14 percent, he said.  Peso sales are growing as economists predict policy makers
will increase  interest rates  for the first time since 2008 as
soon as July. The cost for Mexican companies to borrow in
dollars approached the highest level in eight months.  While  consumer credit  is expanding at half the pace of
 Brazil , the 8 percent annual growth rate in January reflects
Mexico’s recovery from its worst recession since 1991, buoyed by
rising U.S. demand.  Mexico’s gross domestic product expanded 5.5 percent in
2010, the fastest pace in 10 years, and may grow 4 percent to 5
percent this year, Finance Minister  Ernesto Cordero  said last
week. The expansion compares with 7.5 percent growth in Brazil
in 2010 and a 9.1 percent increase in GDP in  Argentina .  Consumer Lending  Outstanding Mexican consumer loans have risen every month
since May 2010, when they reached an almost four-year low,
according to Mexico’s Banking and Securities Commission. The
loans totaled 384.9 billion pesos in January from a year
earlier, up from 356.3 billion pesos in the same month in 2010.
In Brazil, outstanding consumer loans climbed 19 percent in
January from the year-earlier period to 553.8 billion reais
($336 billion), according to central bank data.  Grupo Financiero Inbursa SAB, the financial-services firm
controlled by billionaire  Carlos Slim , forecast an expansion of
at least 15 percent in its outstanding loans this year amid
growth in lending for autos and small businesses, Frank Aguado,
the bank’s head of credit, said on a conference call Feb. 11.  ‘Growth Potential’  “Banks are going to need capital,” Guillermo Ortiz, a
former central bank governor who is now chairman of Grupo
Financiero Banorte SAB, said in  New York  on March 22. “If you
think about their growth potential, they’ll require a lot of
financing.”  Mexican banks are failing to meet demand for credit, Ortiz
said.  Debt sales of non-bank companies in Mexico fell 15 percent
to 144.8 billion pesos in the 12-month period ending March 28,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Yields on the TIIE futures contract maturing in July fell 1
basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 5.0 percent today.  The peso strengthened 0.2 percent to 11.95515 per dollar at
5 p.m. New York time and is up 3.2 percent this year.  The extra yield investors demand to hold Mexican dollar
bonds instead of U.S. Treasuries fell 3 basis points to 125,
according to JPMorgan Chase & Co.’s EMBI+ Index. The difference
compares with 166 for Brazil, rated one level lower than Mexico
at BBB- by  Standard & Poor’s , and 165 for similarly rated
 Russia .  The average yield on dollar bonds sold by Mexican companies
rose 3 basis points to 6.35 percent yesterday, according to
JPMorgan. It reached 6.38 percent on March 8, the highest since
July.  Rate Outlook  The cost to protect Mexican debt against non-payment for
five years fell 2 basis points to 106, according to CMA
DataVision. Credit-default swaps pay the buyer face value in
exchange for the underlying securities or cash equivalent if the
issuer fails to comply with debt agreements.  Central bank Governor Agustin Carstens will increase the
overnight lending rate about 75 basis points to 5.25 percent by
year-end, trading in 28-day interbank rate futures contracts
known as TIIE futures shows.  Mexico is the only major Latin American country that hasn’t
boosted borrowing costs in the past year as consumer prices rise
at the third-slowest pace in the region after Chile and  Peru .  ‘Good Moment’  The central bank’s five-member board has kept the benchmark
lending rate at 4.5 percent for a record 17 meetings after
cutting it from 8.25 percent on Aug. 15, 2008. The economy
shrank 6.1 percent in 2009 after the U.S., the biggest buyer of
Mexican exports, slipped into recession. The  U.S. economy 
expanded 2.9 percent last year and may grow 3.1 percent this
year, according to the median estimate in a Bloomberg survey of
68 economists.  “If you ask whether it’s a good moment to get funding, I’d
say it is,” Eduardo Estrada, the head bond trader at Actinver
Casa de Bolsa in Mexico City, said in a telephone interview.
“If you keep in mind we’re coming out of a couple years of
general decline in growth and low interest rates worldwide, I
think it makes a lot of sense.”  The economic expansion is fueling speculation Mexican
inflation will pick up. Consumer price increases slowed to 3.1
percent in the 12 months through mid-March from 3.6 percent in
February. Annual inflation will reach 3.9 percent at the end of
the year, according to a survey of 24 economists released by
Citigroup Inc.’s Banamex unit on March 22.  Bank Deposits  Total deposits  held by Mexican banks rose 8.5 percent to
2.42 trillion pesos at the end of the fourth quarter of 2010,
compared with the same period in 2009, according to National
Securities and Banking Commission. The figure doesn’t include
international deposits. Outstanding loans rose 0.5 percent to
2.14 trillion pesos in January from a year earlier, the
commission said on March 22.  Bancomer, BBVA’s Mexico City-based unit, has the most
outstanding loans at 573.9 billion pesos, followed by Banamex
with 322.7 billion pesos, the commission’s data show.  Banks including Bancomer, Banamex, Inbursa and Santander
may return to the local market because they’ve only sold a small
amount of what they’re authorized to issue, Actinver’s Estrada
said.  Santander, Mexico’s third-largest bank by outstanding
loans, sold 3.7 billion pesos of bonds due 2013 to yield 15
basis points above TIIE on March 16.  Banamex Sale  Santander is “extending the terms” of funding because the
bank expects demand for credit will quicken and regulators will
impose stricter liquidity requirements, according to an e-mail
from the bank.  Banamex, the Mexico City-based unit of Citigroup, sold 7
billion pesos of notes due in 2015 to yield 28 basis points
above TIIE on Nov. 24. Officials at Banamex’s press office
didn’t return calls for comment.  Banco Inbursa, a unit of Slim’s Grupo Financiero Inbursa,
sold 6 billion pesos of bonds on Feb. 23 to yield 24 basis
points above TIIE.  Bancomer still has room to sell more bonds in the local
market this year, Gallardo said.  “We are in a comfortable position and we have the space to
sell more debt because of the growth we see coming,” Gallardo
said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
