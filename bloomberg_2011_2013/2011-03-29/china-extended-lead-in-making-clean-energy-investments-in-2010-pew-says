China  extended its lead in
renewable energy investments last year, and  Germany  overtook the
U.S. to become the second-largest market for clean technologies
including solar, wind and biomass generators, according to the
 Pew Charitable Trusts .  Global investment in clean energy surged 30 percent last
year to $243 billion, more than 90 percent of which went to
power projects and companies in the 20 largest economies, Pew
said in a report based on Bloomberg New Energy Finance data.  The data show that the U.S. is increasingly being left
behind as other countries make clean energy investments a
national priority, Pew said today.  “China’s surging growth is nothing short of remarkable,”
Phyllis Cuttino, director of Pew’s Clean Energy Program in
 Washington , said in an interview. “It should be a gigantic
worry for the U.S. -- just three years ago we were first.”  China’s dominance in clean energy was fueled by a 39
percent increase in investment to a record $54.4 billion last
year. That made it the world’s largest manufacturer of  wind
turbines  and solar modules, and helped it to overtake the U.S.
in terms of installed renewable energy capacity.  Financial incentives for renewable energy, such as feed-in-
tariffs in Germany and  Italy , as well as targets that require
higher production, helped the industry surpass installed nuclear
capacity for the first time in decades.  Government Goals  China has set a goal of installing 20,000 megawatts of
solar energy by 2020, and the European Union wants to generate
20 percent of its power from renewable sources over the same
period.  In the U.S., 30 states have policies requiring utilities to
buy an increasing amount of their electricity from renewable
sources. While the federal government has incentives to reduce
project costs, there’s no nationwide mandate for clean energy.  Solar power investments jumped 53 percent in 2010 to a
record $79 billion, leading to 17,000 megawatts of new capacity
globally, or enough for about 14 million homes. For wind, 40,000
megawatts of capacity were installed, with $95 billion in
investments.  That helped to increase renewable energy installations at
the end of last year to 388,000 megawatts worldwide, or enough
for about 310 million typical American homes. That compares to
 377,000  megawatts of nuclear energy capacity at the end of 2010.  To contact the reporter on this story:
