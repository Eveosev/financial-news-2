Jaya Tiasa Holdings Bhd. (JT) , a
Malaysian timber producer and oil palm planter, rose to an 11-
year high in Kuala Lumpur stock trading after third-quarter
profit almost tripled.  The stock gained 6.5 percent to 6.56 ringgit at the 5 p.m.
local-time close, the highest level since March 2000. The
benchmark  FTSE Bursa Malaysia KLCI (FBMKLCI)  Index’s increased 0.4
percent. The Sarawak-based company’s net income surged to 39.9
million ringgit ($13 million) in the three months ended Jan. 31
from 13.7 million ringgit a year earlier due to higher timber
and  palm-oil  prices, it said in a statement yesterday.  Lumber prices have gained 11 percent in the past year,
while crude palm oil rose 30 percent, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg. Toh Woo Kim, a Kuala Lumpur-based analyst at RHB
Research Institute Sdn., raised his profit forecasts for Jaya
Tiasa by between 5.8 percent and 10.6 percent for fiscal year
2011 to 2013, according to a report today.  “Jaya Tiasa’s prospects are looking up, given that average
selling prices of timber products are expected to remain firm in
view of the robust demand for logs and anticipated increase in
demand from  Japan  due to reconstruction efforts after the
earthquake disaster,” Toh wrote.  The number of dead and missing people following a
magnitude-9 earthquake and resulting tsunami that struck Japan
on March 11 had risen to at least 28,321, the National Police
Agency reported in Tokyo today.  Shares of Jaya Tiasa and other timber companies have
rallied since the earthquake on anticipated reconstruction
demand.  WTK Holdings Bhd. (WTKH)  surged 14 percent to 2.10 ringgit, the
highest close since July 2008. The stock has soared 67 percent
this year. Lingui Developments Bhd. jumped 12 percent to 1.99
ringgit. It has risen 54 percent this year.  To contact the reporters on this story:
