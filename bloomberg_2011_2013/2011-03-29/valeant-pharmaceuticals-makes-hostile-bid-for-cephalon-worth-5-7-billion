Valeant Pharmaceuticals
International Inc. (VRX)  offered to buy  Cephalon Inc. (CEPH)  for $73 a share
in cash. The offer is worth about $5.7 billion, Valeant said.  Valeant, which said it was disappointed by private offers
to Cephalon, will attempt to replace Cephalon’s current board of
directors with its own nominees.  The offer represents a 29 percent premium more than the
Cephalon’s 30-day trading average, Valeant said. The offer is 24
percent higher than Cephalon’s closing price today of $58.75.  Valeant said the transaction will be entirely debt financed
and Goldman Sachs & Co. has provided a letter for the full
amount.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
