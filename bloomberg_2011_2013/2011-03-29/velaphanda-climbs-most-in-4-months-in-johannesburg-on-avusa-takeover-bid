Mvelaphanda Group Ltd. (MVG) , a South
African investment holding company, rose the most in four months
after  Avusa Ltd. (AVU) , the media company in which Mvelaphanda has a
25.5 percent stake, received a takeover bid.  The stock advanced as much as 29 cents, or 9.7 percent, to
3.28 rand, the biggest intraday increase since Nov. 29 and
traded 7 percent up at 3.20 rand by 9:39 a.m. in Johannesburg.  Avusa, which runs a publishing venture with Pearson Plc in
South Africa, said yesterday it received an unsolicited offer
for all of its shares from a group represented by Capitau
Holdings Ltd., RMB Ventures and other unidentified investors.  The  New Age newspaper  said today that Capitau will buy out
Avusa for 26 rand a share, without saying where it got the
information from.  The company, which has a market capitalization of 2.6
billion rand ($378 million), publishes Business Day,  South
Africa ’s main daily business newspaper, and the Financial Mail
and runs Summit TV in a venture with Pearson. Separately, it
publishes the Sunday Times, South Africa’s biggest Sunday
newspaper, and the Sowetan.  To contact the reporter on this story:
