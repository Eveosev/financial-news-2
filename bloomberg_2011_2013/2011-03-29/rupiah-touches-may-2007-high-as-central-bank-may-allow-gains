Indonesia ’s rupiah advanced,
touching the strongest level in almost four years, on
speculation the central bank will tolerate gains to counter
rising consumer prices. Benchmark bonds gained.  Inflation in  Southeast Asia ’s largest economy accelerated
to 6.99 percent in March from a year earlier, according to the
median estimate of economists surveyed by Bloomberg before
official data due April 1. Prices gained 6.84 percent in
February. Bank Indonesia is allowing the rupiah to strengthen as
it sees  core inflation  possibly increasing this month due to
rising commodity prices, Perry Warjiyo, the monetary authority’s
director of economic research, said last week.  “The central bank wants to control inflation by allowing
gains in the currency,” said Lindawati Susanto, head of
foreign-exchange trading at PT Bank Resona Perdania in Jakarta.
 Bank Indonesia  “is also in the market” to prevent volatility,
she said.  The rupiah strengthened 0.1 percent to 8,713 per dollar as
of 4:18 p.m. in Jakarta, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
It touched 8,703, matching the level it reached on March 23
which was the strongest since May 2007. The currency has gained
3.1 percent this quarter, the best performance among the 10
most-traded Asian currencies.  Policy makers will meet on April 12 to review the benchmark
lending rate. Bank Indonesia kept its  reference rate  unchanged
at 6.75 percent earlier this month, after raising it by 25 basis
points in February, the first increase since October 2008. A
basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  Ten-year  government bonds  rose. The yield on the 8.25
percent note due July 2021 slipped one basis point to 8.11
percent, according to closing prices from the Inter-Dealer
Market Association.  To contact the reporter on this story:
