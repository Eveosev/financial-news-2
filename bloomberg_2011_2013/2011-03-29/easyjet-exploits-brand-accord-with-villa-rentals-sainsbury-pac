EasyJet Plc (EZJ)  will step up plans to
exploit an accord that grants the carrier greater control of the
brand as it adds non-airline businesses such as holiday villas
and partners with J. Sainsbury Plc to sell tickets.  The pact with Sainsbury, the third-biggest U.K. supermarket
chain, will let shoppers redeem Nectar loyalty points against
EasyJet fares. Chief Executive Officer Carolyn McCall has struck
a deal with U.K. tourism authority  VisitBritain  and is chasing
further linkups, she said in an interview.  McCall is rolling out promotional alliances five months
after sealing a deal to pay a percentage of sales to founder
 Stelios Haji-Ioannou  in return for wider branding rights. Peter
Duffy, former U.K. marketing director of luxury carmaker Audi,
joined EasyJet three weeks ago to spearhead the sales push.  “There are definitely two or three more deals in the
pipeline,” McCall, 49, said in Amman, Jordan, following the
Luton, England-based carrier’s inaugural flight there. “We have
complete freedom to talk to anybody.”  EasyJet is also pursuing co-branding prospects in
Switzerland and  France , with the retail and mobile-phone
industries presenting attractive opportunities, the CEO said.  Under the licensing agreement, Stelios, who goes by his
first name, will receive a royalty equal to 0.25 percent of
sales, capped at 3.9 million pounds ($6.2 million) and 4.95
million pounds respectively for the first and second years.  EasyJet’s biggest investor runs his own collection of
companies under the EasyGroup Holdings banner in markets ranging
from office rentals and airport buses to gyms and cinemas, and
had gone to court to stop the carrier striking its own marketing
deals and expanding beyond  air travel .  Vacation Unit  Europe’s second-largest low-cost carrier wants to tap new
businesses to help boost so-called ancillary revenue, and
following the settlement with Stelios began selling hotel rooms
and villas on March 11 under the new  EasyJet Holidays  brand.  The vacation unit, established with partner Lowcost Travel
Group, will allow tourists to arrive and depart on days of their
choice, instead of buying a traditional inflexible package trip.
It will compete with companies including TUI AG,  Europe ’s No. 1
tour operator, and Thomas Cook Group Plc.  Lowcost Travel Chief Operating Officer Laurence Hunt,
formerly CEO of failed business-class-only carrier Silverjet,
estimates the value of Britain’s package-holiday market at as
much as 11 billion pounds and says EasyJet Holidays could
generate “a few hundred million pounds” of revenue within
three years. He wouldn’t comment on how proceeds will be split.  Media Background  McCall, who joined EasyJet from Guardian Media Group Plc
last July with no previous experience in aviation, said she has
appointed Nick Hughes, recruited from Swiss travel firm  Kuoni
Reisen Holding AG (KUNN) , as the first manager for non-airline sales.  “When I came, ancillary revenue was not going very well,”
the CEO said. “Seat revenue had been the focus of attention. We
are in a much better place than we were.”  While EasyJet is permitted to do “anything in the airline-
travel space” and to link with rental-car providers and
insurers via its website, the brand license doesn’t allow it to
go so far as putting its own name on those services, McCall
said.  Marketing chief Duffy, hired from  Volkswagen AG (VOW) ’s Audi last
year, has been tasked with developing new branding opportunities
and increasing EasyJet’s appeal to business passengers, who
generally book seats later and pay more for the privilege.  Profit Priority  McCall said that the focus on marketing opportunities
mustn’t be allowed to detract from that drive to lift margins.
EasyJet is adding flights on routes from bases in  London , Paris
and Geneva and will adopt flexible ticketing across the network
this summer to enhance its appeal to corporate travelers.  “If this amounts just to enabling people to put packages
together it shouldn’t be too much of a distraction,” said
Jonathan Wober, an analyst at Societe Generale SA in London who
recommends buying EasyJet stock. “But the major issue is to
make sure they tackle punctuality issues from last summer.”  EasyJet is recovering from a slump in performance prompted
by crew shortages and rostering problems at bases including
 London Gatwick , its main hub. Passenger numbers still rose 7.9
percent to 49.72 million last year.  Ryanair Holdings Plc (RYA) ,
Europe’s top discount carrier, carried 72.7 million people.  To contact the reporter on this story:
