Dubai World, the state-owned
holding company that’s restructuring about $25 billion of debt,
is in “a new phase of growth,” Chairman  Sheikh Ahmed  Bin Saeed
Al Maktoum said.  “We look forward to a brighter future based on solid
financials,” Sheikh Ahmed told a meeting of 600 managers from
its business units in Dubai yesterday, according to a company
statement.  Dubai World’s units include  DP World Ltd. (DPW) , the world’s
fourth-biggest port operator, ship repair company Drydocks World
LLC and private-equity investor Istithmar World PJSC. Sheikh
Ahmed replaced Sultan Ahmed bin Sulayem as Dubai World chairman
in December.  To contact the reporters on this story:
