Spot gasoline in New York Harbor
jumped the most since December after  Sunoco Inc. (SUN)  worked to
return units to service at its Marcus Hook refinery in
Pennsylvania after a power outage yesterday.  The 194,000-barrel-a-day refinery “momentarily” lost
power at 4:19 p.m. local time yesterday, Lynda Rebarchak, a
spokeswoman for the southeast regional office of the
Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection, said in an
e-mail. At 8:30 p.m., Sunoco informed the department that “all
units were coming back online,” she said.  The discount for conventional 87-octane gasoline in New
York narrowed 3.38 cents, the biggest gain since Dec. 1, to
12.25 cents a gallon. Prompt delivery rose 5.21 cents to $2.9233
a gallon.  The  power failure  occurred when a transmission customer was
performing work, Karen Muldoon Geus, a spokeswoman for PECO
Energy, a subsidiary of Exelon Corp., said in an e-mail late
yesterday.  Premium 93-octane unleaded in the  Gulf Coast  surged 5.75
cents to a 5-cent premium over futures, after Marathon Oil Corp.
shut an alkylation unit at its Texas City, Texas, refinery
following a release of hydrofluoric acid March 27. The unit
produces alkylate, used to make high-octane gasoline.  The gap between 87-octane and 93-octane fuel widened to 17
cents a gallon, the largest since May 25.  The discount for conventional, 87-octane gasoline in the
Gulf Coast narrowed 0.75 cent to 12 cents a gallon versus
futures traded on the  New York Mercantile Exchange  at 4:16 p.m.,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Prompt delivery rose
2.35 cents to $2.9236 a gallon.  To contact the reporter on this story:
