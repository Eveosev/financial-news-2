Turkey’s benchmark  ISE National 100
Index (XU100)  dropped 497.5, or 0.8 percent, to 63,763.8 at the 5:30
p.m. close of trading in Istanbul.  The following stocks were active. Symbols are in
parentheses.  Albaraka Turk Katilim Bankasi AS (ALBRK)  , an Islamic
bank, rose the most in more than two weeks after reporting net
income rose 35 percent in 2010 to $94 million. The shares gained
4 kurus, or 1.8 percent, to 2.25 liras.  Is Finansal Kiralama AS (ISFIN)  , a leasing company,
plunged as much as 8 percent, the most since May, after
Bloomberg HT television cited Finance Minister Mehmet Simsek as
saying he expects a “limited” reduction in the 18 percent tax
on leasing transactions. The shares closed down 8 kurus, or 4.9
percent, to 1.54 liras.  Turkey Garanti Bankasi AS (GARAN TI), the nation’s biggest
provider of consumer loans, fell to a three-week low, dropping
16 kurus, or 2.1 percent, to 7.30 liras. Goldman Sachs Group
Inc. lowered price estimates for the six Turkish banks it
covers, saying an increase in  reserve requirements  by the
central bank will hurt their profit. Investors should buy banks
outside of Turkey instead, Goldman Sachs said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
