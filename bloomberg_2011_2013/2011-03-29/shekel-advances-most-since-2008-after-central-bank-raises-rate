The shekel rose to the highest in
more than two years as a larger-than-expected rate increase from
the  Bank of Israel  indicated a shift in focus to targeting
inflation from curbing gains in the currency.  Governor  Stanley Fischer  lifted the interest rate by a
half-percentage point to 3 percent yesterday. Inflation
expectations for periods longer than a year as calculated from
the capital market are still above the upper limit of the
government’s 1 percent to 3 percent target range, the bank said.  “The aggressive move by the central bank is expected to be
followed by additional interest rate increases to bring down
high inflation, but there is uncertainty about the magnitude,”
Arie Tal, chief strategist at Alumot-Sprint Investment House
Ltd. in Herzliya,  Israel , said by telephone today. “The
interest-rate differential with the U.S. will widen and further
contribute to a stronger shekel.”  Near-zero  interest rates  in the U.S. and  Europe  have
spurred increased inflows into Israel and other countries where
rates are higher, driving gains in currencies and undermining
exports. Fischer until yesterday had kept the pace of rate
increases gradual even as growth picked up, aiming to moderate
shekel gains and help exporters compete in world markets.  The shekel climbed as much as 0.4 percent to 3.5094 per
dollar, the highest intraday level since October 2008. The
currency, which has gained 2.7 percent this month and 5.1
percent over the past year. It slipped 0.1 percent to 3.5280 at
5:02 p.m. in Tel Aviv.  Highest Since 2008  The rate increase was the first of its size since 2005 and
puts the main rate at the highest level since November 2008.
Only one of 21 economists and institutions surveyed by Bloomberg
had forecast the decision. Tal now expects the benchmark rate
will reach 4.25 percent by year end.  The benchmark Mimshal Shiklit bond due January 2020 rose,
pushing the yield down 2 basis points to 5.33 percent at the
4:30 p.m. close. The yield has gained 64 basis points this
quarter.  “The bank’s move, aimed at curbing accelerated inflation,
will calm down the yield rally and lower inflation expectations
in the market,”  Rafael Gozlan , chief economist at Leader
Capital Markets Ltd. in  Tel Aviv . said by telephone.  Inflation expectations, as derived from the  bond market ,
fell today, with the spread between inflation-linked bonds due
October 2014 and fixed-rate notes of similar maturity narrowing
15 basis points to 334.8 from 350.1 yesterday, which implies
expected inflation of about 3.3 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
