Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria SA (BBVA) 
would consider the purchase of assets in Latin America, either
alone or with partners, a region that will remain a driver for
growth this year,  Reuters  reported, citing an interview with
Vicente Rodero, director for the lender in the region.  There may be some options in 2011 after BBVA purchased
Credit Uruguay last year, Rodero said, referring to corporate
moves, according to Reuters. Still, there is competition for
non-organic growth and few sellers, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
