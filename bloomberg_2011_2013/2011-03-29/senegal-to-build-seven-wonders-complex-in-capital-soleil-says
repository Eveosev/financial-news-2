Senegal plans to build “The Seven
Wonders of Dakar,” a 10-hectare (27-acre) zone that will
include a national theater, a national library, an architectural
school, a museum of African history, an art museum, an art
school and a concert hall, Le Soleil reported.  The project, announced by President Abdoulaye Wade late
yesterday, will be built by the Dakar-based architectural firm
Atepa Group, and Chinese construction companies, the newspaper
said, without saying which Chinese firms.  To contact the reporter on this story:
