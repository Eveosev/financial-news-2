Middle Eastern and North African
countries need to encourage their small and medium-sized
companies and remove regulatory hurdles to reduce unemployment,
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP said.  “Using the U.S. as an example, over the past 20 years new
firms, which invariably start as small firms, have been
responsible for nearly all the  job creation ,” David Stevens,
PWC’s government industry leader for the Middle East, said in an
e-mailed statement late yesterday.  Across the region, it takes an average of 20 days and 8
procedures to start a business, compared with the global best
practice of one day and one procedure, he said.  Unemployment has been one of the main causes of the unrest
across the Middle East that has toppled leaders in Egypt and
Tunisia and escalated into an armed conflict in  Libya . Total and
youth average unemployment rates in the Middle East and North
Africa are the highest in the world, PwC said, citing a 2011
report from the International Labor Office.  Unemployment averages 10 percent across the region and is
24 percent for people aged between 15 and 24, the report said.
In  Egypt , Jordan, Syria and  Saudi Arabia , average youth
unemployment is 30 percent, it said.  Changes within the financial industry that would allow
small and medium-sized companies access to credit is needed, the
report said. Credit to the private sector as a percentage of
gross domestic product is barely a quarter of that found in the
Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development countries,
the report said, citing data from the  World Bank .  To contact the reporters on this story:
