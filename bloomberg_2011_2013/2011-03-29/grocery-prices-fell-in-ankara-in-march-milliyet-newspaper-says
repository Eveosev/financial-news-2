Grocery prices fell in Ankara in
March, suggesting nationwide inflation may follow suit, Milliyet
newspaper reported, citing a cost-of-living survey by labor
union Turk-Is.  The unionâ€™s poverty and hunger survey showed a 2.1 percent
fall in grocery prices in the city in the month, driven by
declines in fruit and dairy prices, the newspaper said.  Economists including Banu Kiivci Tokali say Ankara prices
track nationwide inflation figures closely, Milliyet reported.  The labour union put the hunger line for a family of four
people in March at 871 liras ($558), it said.  Click here for web link  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
