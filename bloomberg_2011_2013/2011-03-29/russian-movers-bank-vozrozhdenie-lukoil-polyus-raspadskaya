The 30-stock  Micex Index (INDEXCF)  slid 1.3
percent to 1,788.14 at the 6:45 p.m. close in Moscow, the
biggest drop since March 15. The dollar-denominated RTS Index
also slumped 1.3 percent, to 2,018.74.  The following were among the most active stocks in the
Russian market today. Stock symbols are in parenthesis.  Bank Vozrozhdenie (VZRZ RX) fell the most in two weeks,
losing 4.4 percent to 1,147.5 rubles after the Russian lender
said net income decreased in 2010 to 581 million rubles ($20.5
million) from 1.22 billion rubles for the prior year.  OAO Lukoil (LKOH RX),  Russia ’s second-biggest oil producer,
declined 1.8 percent to 1,990.9, the lowest closing price since
March 22. Crude fell as much as 1.2 percent to $102.70 a barrel
as Libyan rebels’ advance against Muammar Qaddafi’s troops
spurred hope that the conflict in  Africa ’s third-largest oil
producer may end soon.  OAO Polyus Gold (PLZL RX), Russia’s biggest producer of the
metal, dropped the most in two weeks, losing 1.2 percent to
1,665.7 rubles. Gold declined for a fourth day in  London  as
signs the  U.S. economy  is improving and speculation of interest-
rate increases curbed demand for the metal as an alternative
investment.  OAO  Raspadskaya (RASP)   retreated for a third day,
dropping 3 percent to 191.26 rubles after RIA Novosti reported
OAO Mechel is seeking to buy the coal company at a price three
times lower than its shareholders expected.  To contact the reporter on this story:
