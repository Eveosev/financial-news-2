France  has named an envoy to the
Libyan rebel forces, Agence France-Presse reported, citing
unnamed French officials.  Antoine Sivan, 53, who speaks Arabic and has worked in
French embassies in Qatar and Iraq, left France two days ago for
Benghazi, the eastern Libyan city where the Interim National
Council is based.  France’s government was the first to say that it regards
the council, which is seeking the overthrow of  Muammar Qaddafi ,
as the representative of the Libyan people.  The French Foreign Ministry didn’t return calls seeking
comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
