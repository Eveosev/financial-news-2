Jiangxi Copper Co.,  China ’s biggest
producer of the metal, plans to increase spending by 47 percent 
this year to boost capacity and benefit from record prices.  Investments will reach 5 billion yuan ($762 million) in
2011, Financial Manager Jiang Liehui said at a media briefing
today in  Hong Kong , where the company is listed.  Capital
spending  last year was 3.4 billion yuan. Capacity will increase
to 1 million metric tons this year and to 1.5 million tons by
2015 from 900,000 tons last year, Vice Chairman Li Baomin told
reporters at the event.  Jiangxi Copper is benefiting from prices that reached a
record $10,190 a ton last month. Chinese copper demand will grow
by as much as 12 percent this year, Huang Dongfeng, assistant to
general manager, said today.  “China’s copper demand will continue a good growth
momentum as the nation pushes ahead with construction of ultra
high-voltage power-grids and high-speed railways,” Li said.  Jiangxi Copper rose the most in almost five months in Hong
Kong trading. The shares rose 5.5 percent to HK$26, the most
since Nov. 5, at the 4 p.m. close of trading. The key  Hang Seng
Index  rose 1.7 percent.  Derived Earnings  Second-half profit more than doubled to 2.79 billion yuan.
The result was derived by deducting first-half figures from
full-year profit released yesterday by the company on the
Shanghai stock exchange.  Full-year net income more than doubled to 4.91 billion yuan
in 2010, based on Chinese accounting standards, Jiangxi Copper
said. Net profit was 4.99 billion yuan by international
standards, beating the 4.7 billion yuan mean estimate of 11
analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. Sales rose 48 percent to 76.4
billion yuan.  Jiangxi Copper plans to build new projects or buy mines in
China, Vice Chairman Li said. The company will start operations 
at its projects in  Peru  and  Afghanistan  as early as in 2014,
Huang said today. The Peru project will cost Jiangxi Copper and
partner China Minmetals Nonferrous Metals Co. $2.5 billion to
develop, Huang said.  The Aynak copper mine in Afghanistan, in which Jiangxi
Copper has 25 percent stake, will cost $1.7 billion to develop,
Huang said. The mine will start producing 200,000 tons of copper
a year as early as 2014, he said.  -Wang Ying in Hong Kong and Xiao Yu in Beijing. Editors:
