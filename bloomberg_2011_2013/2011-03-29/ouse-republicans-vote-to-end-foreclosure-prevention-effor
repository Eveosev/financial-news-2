The U.S. House of Representatives
voted to abolish a program designed to help homeowners avoid
foreclosure as some Democrats aligning with Republicans against
the measure.  The House voted 252-170 to eliminate the Home Affordable
Modification Program, President  Barack Obama ’s effort to aid
struggling homeowners. The program pays banks and mortgage
servicers to modify borrowers’ monthly payments.  About 1.5 million households have begun trial mortgage
modifications through HAMP, fewer than initial projections of 3
million to 4 million. More than 600,000 homeowners have received
permanent modifications.  Neil Barofsky , special inspector general for the Troubled
Asset Relief Program, has called the HAMP program “a failure”
and said it pales in comparison to the record 2.9 million
foreclosure filings in 2010.  The vote is the last of four brought by House Republicans
to kill funding for homeowner-aid programs backed by the
administration.  The measure must pass the Senate before it can become law.
Senate Republicans Jim DeMint of South Carolina,  Bob Corker  of
Tennessee and  Tom Coburn  of Oklahoma have introduced legislation
to end the program. Obama has threatened to veto the bill if it
gets to his desk.  To contact the reporter on this story:
