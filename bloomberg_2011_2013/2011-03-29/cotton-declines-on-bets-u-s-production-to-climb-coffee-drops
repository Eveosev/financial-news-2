Cotton prices declined for a third
straight session on expectations for a bigger crop in the U.S.,
the world’s largest exporter. Coffee also retreated.  U.S. cotton farmers may boost planting by 20 percent this
year after prices jumped to a record, a Bloomberg News survey
showed last week. The  U.S. Department of Agriculture  will
release its first survey-based acreage estimate on March 31.
Global output will exceed demand by 1.1 million metric tons in
the year that begins Aug.1, according to researcher  Cotlook Ltd.   “The market will remain weak ahead of Thursday’s report,”
said  Sid Love , the president of Joe Kropf & Sid Love Consulting
Services LLC in  Overland Park , Kansas.  Cotton for May delivery fell 2.61 cents, or 1.3 percent, to
settle at $1.9488 a pound at 2:40 p.m. on ICE Futures U.S. in
New York. Yesterday, the most-active contract plunged 3.4
percent, the biggest drop since March 15.  The commodity has more than doubled in the past year,
touching a record $2.197 on March 7, as Chinese demand surged.
The price is heading for its third straight quarterly gain.  “We may see a decline in demand because of very high
prices,” Love said.  Arabica-coffee futures for May delivery fell 2.5 cents, or
0.9 percent, to $2.6145 a pound in  New York . Still, the
commodity has gained 8.7 percent this quarter, heading for a
ninth straight gain, a record rally.  In London, robusta-coffee futures for May delivery
retreated $11, or 0.5 percent, to $2,405 a metric ton on NYSE
Liffe.  To contact the reporters on this story:
