Kenya ’s shilling strengthened for a
fourth day against the dollar, the longest streak of gains in
four months, on speculation dollar inflows from the sale of
agricultural goods will increase.  The currency of East Africa’s biggest economy strengthened
as much as 0.5 percent to 83.70 per dollar and was trading 0.4
percent up at 83.82 at 12:15 p.m. in Nairobi from a close of
84.13 yesterday.  “Expected inflows from the agricultural sector are likely
to strengthen the local unit further, hence businesses are
liquidating their long-dollar positions,” Steve Lagat, a dealer
at Nairobi based CfC Stanbic Bank Ltd., said in a phone
interview today. “The shilling is expected to strengthen and
trade within the 83.50 to 83.00 range in the coming days.” A
long position is a bet that an assets price will increase.  Agriculture accounts for 25 percent of Kenya’s gross
domestic product, with tea, coffee and horticulture being its
main source of foreign exchange. Kenya is the world’s biggest
exporter of black tea.  Tea yields showed a “slight increase” after favorable
weather in growing areas in the country, Africa Tea Brokers Ltd.
said on March 25. African tea prices rose for the first week in
four, averaging $2.77 a kilogram on March 23 auction compared
with an average of $2.72 a kilogram in the previous auction.  To contact the reporter on this story:
