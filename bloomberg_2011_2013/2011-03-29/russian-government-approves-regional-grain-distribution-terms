Russia set out the terms for
distributing 2.39 million metric tons of feed grain from
stockpiles to the country’s regions, according to a posting on a
government  website .  The resolution, approved on March 24, authorized sales of
about 1.4 million tons of the fifth-grade feed wheat and some
982,000 tons of feed barley priced at 4,550 rubles ($158) and
4,200 rubles a ton respectively. The grain will be distributed
according to a formula based on the regions’ production last
year of pork, poultry, eggs and animal-feed.  Russia’s Agriculture Ministry has concluded agreements with
16 regions that will provide lists of applicants for the grains,
it said today in a statement. The lists will be sent to state-
owned grain trader United Grain Co., and sales contracts should
be signed within a week of their receipt, the government said.
 Russia  is seeking to control food price inflation after Russia’s
worst drought in a half century damaged crops last year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
