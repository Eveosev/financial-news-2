U.S. Ambassador to China  Jon Huntsman  is interested in running for president in 2012 or 2016,
his brother Peter Huntsman said.  Jon Huntsman, a Republican who resigned during his second
term as governor of  Utah  to accept President  Barack Obama ’s
diplomatic appointment, may sit out the next presidential
election cycle, Peter Huntsman said yesterday in an interview in
San Antonio. Peter Huntsman said he’s as close to his brother
Jon “as anyone except his wife.”  Jon Huntsman, 51, who speaks Mandarin Chinese, resigned
from his ambassadorship in January, effective April 30, fueling
speculation he will run for president.  “There is a real need in this country for a politician who
can have a focus on economic progress and economic development
and deficit reduction,” said Peter Huntsman, chief executive
officer of  Huntsman Corp. (HUN)  , the Salt Lake City-based chemicals
company their father founded.  “He is interested at some point” in running for
president, he said. “That’s not necessarily in 2012.”  Peter Huntsman, 48, said he voted for Obama and is rooting
for the president to succeed. Still, Jon would make “an
attractive candidate,” he said.  Their father, Jon Meade Huntsman Sr., is chairman of
Huntsman Corp.  To contact the reporter on this story:
