Tata Teleservices Ltd., the Indian
phone partner of  Japan ’s  NTT DoCoMo Inc. (9437) , is preparing to sell
about 30 billion rupees ($670 million) in stock to fund network
expansion, two people familiar with the matter said.  The share sale will probably be disclosed by March 31, said
the people, who asked not to be identified because the
information isn’t public. NTT DoCoMo, based in  Tokyo , plans to
buy enough shares to maintain its 26 percent stake in the
closely held Indian company, they said.  The proceeds will help Tata Teleservices build its third-
generation wireless network in the world’s second-largest market
for mobile services. The company was among nine Indian operators
including  Vodafone Group Plc (VOD) ’s Indian unit that spent 677.2
billion rupees on next-generation wireless permits in a
government auction last year.  Rajeev Narayan, a spokesman for Tata Teleservices in New
Delhi, declined to comment. Takuya Ori, an NTT DoCoMo spokesman,
declined to comment.  Tata Teleservices Maharashtra Ltd. (TTLS) , the listed unit that
provides mobile-phone services in Mumbai and the western states
of Maharashtra and Goa, rose 0.3 percent to 15.3 rupees at the
3:30 p.m. local time close. The shares climbed as much as 2.6
percent earlier.  Telecommunications Licenses  Tata Teleservices won third-generation licenses in nine of
India’s 22 telecommunications zones, paying 59 billion rupees.  NTT DoCoMo rose 1.2 percent to close at 147,900 yen in
Tokyo trading. The stock has gained 6 percent over the past year.  Tata Teleservices plans to split the offering into two
equal tranches of 15 billion rupees each, one of the people said.  NTT DoCoMo, Japan’s largest mobile-phone operator,
completed a 250 billion yen ($2.6 billion) investment in Tata
Teleservices in March 2009.  Temasek Holdings Pte,  Singapore ’s state-owned investment
company, bought 9.9 percent of the Tata Group unit in March 2006.
Tata  units  generated combined revenue about $70 billion last
year, according to its website.  To contact the reporters on this story:
