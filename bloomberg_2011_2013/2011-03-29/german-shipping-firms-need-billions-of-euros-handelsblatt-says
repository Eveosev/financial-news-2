German shipping companies need to
raise billion of euros to finance new vessels at a time when
investors are sceptical of lending them money,  Handelsblatt 
reported, citing industry officials.  The crisis among shipping companies isn’t over,
Handelsblatt cited Nicholas Teller, head of E.R. Capital Holding
in Hamburg, as saying.  He added that companies aren’t likely to be able to raise
the record amount of capital obtained in 2007 for the
foreseeable future, the newspaper reported.  To contact the reporters on this story:
