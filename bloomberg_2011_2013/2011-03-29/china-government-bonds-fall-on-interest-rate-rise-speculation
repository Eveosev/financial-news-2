China ’s 10-year government bonds
declined on speculation the central bank will raise  interest
rates  in April to counter inflation.  The People’s Bank of China sold 99 billion yuan ($15.1
billion) of one-year bills to yield 3.1992 percent at a weekly
auction today, the biggest amount since March 2010. China may
raise interest rates in April or the middle of this year, the
official China Securities Journal said in a front-page editorial.  “The market is already looking for the rate hike in
April,” said Wee-Khoon Chong, a fixed-income strategist at
Societe Generale SA in  Hong Kong . “We also expect them to hike
interest rates next month. The central bank’s inflation-fighting
mode is not over yet and there is still a lot of liquidity in
the system.”  The yield on the 3.83 percent note due March 2021 gained
two basis points to 3.90 percent, and the price of the security
dropped 0.12 per 100 yuan face amount to 99.43 as of 10:27 a.m.
in  Shanghai , according to the Interbank Funding Center. A basis
point is 0.01 percentage point.  Inflation may accelerate to 6 percent in June and July, the
editorial in the China Securities Journal said. Consumer prices
climbed 4.9 percent in February, the same as January, exceeding
the government’s 4 percent annual target, the statistics bureau
said on March 11.  The seven-day repurchase rate, which measures interbank
funding availability, dropped 17 basis points to 2.13 percent,
according to a weighted average rate compiled by the National
Interbank Funding Center.  The one-year swap contract, the fixed cost needed to
receive the floating seven-day repurchase rate, gained one basis
point to 3.28 percent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  -- Judy Chen . Editors:  James Regan , Simon Harvey  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
