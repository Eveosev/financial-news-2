Italy is trying to arrange an
African haven for Libyan leader  Muammar Qaddafi  as his escape is
being considered by diplomats, the Guardian reported.  Today, an international conference is being held in  London 
to discuss various aspects of the situation, including
coordinating assistance after the military campaign, the
Guardian said.  Last night, Italy offered to broker a cease-fire involving
asylum for Quaddafi in an African country, the Guardian said,
citing Italian Foreign Minister Franco Frattini as saying “We
hope that the African Unon can find a valid proposal.”  A senior U.S. official indicated that letting Qaddafi flee
to a country beyond the reach of the  International Criminal
Court  would be acceptable to the U.S.; “I can’t say I know of
active efforts to find him a place to go, but I would not say it
has been ruled out,” the Guardian quoted the official as
saying.    Click here for web link  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
