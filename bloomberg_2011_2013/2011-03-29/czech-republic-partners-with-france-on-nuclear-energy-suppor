The  Czech Republic  has found a
“strong” partner in France for supporting further development
of nuclear energy, Deputy Minister of Industry and Trade Tomas
Huner said.  “We are very happy to have found a strong European partner
that’s pro-nuclear,” Huner said today at an energy conference
in Prague.  Development of nuclear energy is the country’s “absolute
priority” even after the March 11 accident at  Japan ’s Fukushima
Dai-Ichi atomic plant, Prime Minister Petr Necas said. The Czech
Republic will continue using its six existing nuclear reactors
and go ahead with plans to build two more reactors at the
Temelin plant, according to Necas.  France’s Areva AS is competing with Westinghouse Electric
Co. and a Russian-Czech group led by ZAO Atomstroyexport for the
contract to build two new units at Temelin. State-controlled  CEZ
AS (CEZ) , which owns Temelin, will choose the winner of the tender by
the end of 2013.  To contact the reporter on this story:
