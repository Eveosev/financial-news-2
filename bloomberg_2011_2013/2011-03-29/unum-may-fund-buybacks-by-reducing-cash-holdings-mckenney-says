Unum Group (UNM) , the disability insurer
authorized to buy back about $1 billion of stock over the next
year and a half, said it may fund repurchases by reducing the
amount of cash it keeps on hand.  “This is a meaningful amount of capital which could be
deployed overtime,” Rick McKenney, chief financial officer of
the Chattanooga, Tennessee-based company, said today at a
conference organized by JPMorgan Chase & Co. “We’re also
sensitive to the fact that we don’t want to undermine the
ratings improvement we’ve seen and the market perceptions we’ve
seen as a result of our prudent approach” to maintaining cash
holdings, McKenney said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
