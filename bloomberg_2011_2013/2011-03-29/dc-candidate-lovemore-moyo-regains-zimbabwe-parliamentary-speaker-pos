Zimbabwe’s Movement for Democratic
Change candidate, Lovemore Moyo, won the most votes in an
election to determine the next speaker of the country’s
Parliament, said the body’s clerk, Austin Zvoma.  Moyo, who is also chairman of Prime Minister  Morgan Tsvangirai ’s MDC party, won 105 ballots to defeat Simon Khaya Moyo, who received 95 votes from lawmakers in Harare today.  Simon Khaya Moyo is chairman of President  Robert Mugabe ’s
Zimbabwe African National Union-Patriotic Front. Their
respective chairmanships are coincidental and the position
doesn’t automatically make them eligible for the speaker’s
position.  Lovemore Moyo resigned as Speaker on March 10 after a
Zimbabwean court nullified his 2009 election when it was
challenged by Zanu-PF.  The  MDC  and  Zanu-PF  share power in a coalition put in place
by the Southern African Development Community in 2009, bringing
a 10-year economic crisis to an end. The coalition hasn’t ended
outbreaks of political violence in the country.  To contact the reporter on this story:
