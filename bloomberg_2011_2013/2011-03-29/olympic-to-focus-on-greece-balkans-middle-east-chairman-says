Olympic Air , the Greek carrier
owned by  Marfin Investment Group SA (MIG) , will focus on serving the
Greek domestic market and boosting operations to the Balkans and
the Middle East after a merger proposal with its local rival,
 Aegean Airlines SA (AEGN) , was rejected by European anti-trust
regulators in January.  Olympic Air signed a code sharing agreement with Cyprus
Airways on March 22 and would be open to similar arrangements
with other foreign airlines, Olympic Chairman Ioannis Karakadas
told reporters in Athens today.  Aegean Airlines bought four slots from Olympic Air at
 London ’s Heathrow Airport and Charles de Gaulle airport in Paris
last month after Olympic decided to exit those markets along
with Vienna and Brussels as part of its new strategy.  Karakadas, who was appointed chairman in February,
criticized the Greek government for helping foreign airlines by
scrapping takeoff and landing fees at regional airports during
the tourist season while leaving them in place at  Athens 
International Airport, where Olympic is based.  “Greek travellers are paying more for airport taxes in
Athens then they are for the actual ticket,” Karakadas said.
“We’re not at all happy with the way in which the state is
penalizing Greek air carriers.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
