The  Bank of Tanzania  said it’s
seeking consultants to provide advice on the planned
demutualization of the  Dar es Salaam  Stock Exchange.  “The objective of the study is to come up with a suitable
demutualization strategy and a road map that is acceptable to
policy makers, financiers and other stakeholders,” the central
bank said in a statement published in the East African nation’s
 Guardian  newspaper today. Consultants will be selected according
to World Bank guidelines, it said.  Demutualization involves the separation of ownership from
the management of a stock exchange, with a view to running the
bourse as profit-making entity. The Dar es Salaam bourse is
currently governed by a council of 10 representatives of listed
companies, institutional investors, traders and members of the
public, according to information on its website.  The exchange has 16 listed companies, four  government bonds 
and seven corporate bonds. Its total market capitalization was
5.72 trillion Tanzanian shillings ($3.8 billion) at the close of
business yesterday.  Emmanuel Nyalali, clearing and settlement manager at the
bourse, said in a phone interview today that it was “too early
to comment on the exercise because the consultant has not been
selected yet.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
