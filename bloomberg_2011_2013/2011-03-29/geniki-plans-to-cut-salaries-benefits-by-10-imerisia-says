Geniki Bank (TGEN)  SA, the Greek unit of
France’s  Societe Generale (GLE)  SA, is in talks with employees to cut
wages and bonuses by 10 percent to counter losses,  Imerisia 
reported, citing a company letter to employees.  The union representing bank employees has urged workers to
reject the bank’s proposal for a new labor agreement which would
include the wage reductions, the Athens-based newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
