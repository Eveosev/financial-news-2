Manchester United  will face
Barcelona in an exhibition match as part of its pre-season
summer tour of the U.S.  The teams, which met in the 2009 Champions League final and
have both reached the quarterfinals this season, will play July
30 at FedEx Field in Landover, Maryland. It will be the finale
of United’s five-match tour, which includes three games against
three Major League Soccer teams, as well as the league’s All-
Stars.  “Tours are a fantastic chance for the players to get away
as a unit, to put in some good training sessions and to meet
some of our fans around the world who don’t have a chance to
watch us play live every week,” United manager  Alex Ferguson 
said on the club’s  website .  United will open its tour July 13 against the New England
Revolution, followed by games against the Seattle Sounders on
July 20 and the Chicago Fire three days later. The Red Devils
will then meet the MLS All-Stars on July 27 at Red Bull Arena in
Harrison,  New Jersey , before taking on Barcelona.  To contact the reporter on this story:
