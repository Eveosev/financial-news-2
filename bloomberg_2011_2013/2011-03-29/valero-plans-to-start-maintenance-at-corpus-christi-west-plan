Valero Energy Corp. (VLO)  expects
emissions as it starts planned maintenance at the Corpus Christi
West refinery in Texas, according to a filing with state
regulators.  Emissions associated with the shutdown began today at noon
local time and were expected to end in about six hours,
according to a  filing  with the Texas Commission on Environmental
Quality. A  second filing  with regulators showed emissions were
expected to begin at 1 p.m. today and last for 24 hours.  The two filings with the regulatory agency were “related
to a leak at the heavy oil cracker,” Bill Day, a spokesman
based at company headquarters in  San Antonio , said in an e-mail.
“The unit was not shut down and the work is not expected to
affect production.”  The plant has the capacity to process 200,000 barrels a day
of crude, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The refinery
consists of an east and west plant about a mile apart, which
have a capacity of about 315,000 barrels a day, according to the
company’s  website .  To contact the reporter on this story:
