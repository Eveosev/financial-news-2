Association of America-College Retirement Equity Fund, known as
TIAA-CREF, the U.S. pension manager, will put $1 billion of its
own capital into Covariance Capital Management, a new investment
fund that starts today, the Financial Times reported.  It seeks to gain a bigger share of the outsourced
investment management market, the newspaper said.  Covariance will be headed by Scott Wise and run as an
independent unit based in Houston,  Texas , targeting almost $1.5
trillion of assets held by U.S. endowments and non-profit
foundations, the FT said.  It will seek allocations from endowments with assets of
more than $100 million and intends to begin investing in July,
the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
