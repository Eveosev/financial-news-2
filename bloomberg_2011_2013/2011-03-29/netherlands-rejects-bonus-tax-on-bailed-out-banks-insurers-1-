The Netherlands rejected a proposed
100 percent tax on bonuses given to employees of  ING Groep NV (INGA) ,
 Aegon NV (AGN)  and other bailed-out banks and insurers.  The request is “disproportionate, legally flawed and
undesirable,” State Secretary for Finance Frans Weekers said in
an interview with Dutch broadcaster RTLZ today. “I do
understand the reasoning behind it and together with Finance
Minister Jan Kees de Jager we will see how we can act in
accordance with its essence.”  Dutch lawmakers last week submitted a non-binding motion to
apply a one-time tax on all bonuses paid since 2008 after ING
proposed paying Chief Executive Officer Jan Hommen a 1.25
million-euro ($1.76 million) bonus. ING, which received 10
billion euros of aid in 2008, scrapped proposed executive
bonuses amid criticism from lawmakers and government officials.  The transfer of risk by Amsterdam-based ING on 21.6 billion
euros of U.S. mortgage assets should also be taken into account
when awarding bonuses, Weekers said.  The Netherlands bought the Dutch units of Fortis, including
ASR Nederland NV and parts of ABN Amro Group NV, in 2008 after
the company ran out of short-term funding, customers withdrew
deposits and investors lost confidence. The government also
provided aid to Aegon and  SNS Reaal NV. (SR)   To contact the reporter on this story:
