Treasury Secretary  Timothy F. Geithner  said proposed risk-retention rules “will help promote
better standards for underwriting and securitizing mortgages.”  U.S. regulators today proposed exempting banks and bond
issuers who meet high underwriting standards from rules
requiring them to keep a stake in loans they securitize,
according to a draft proposal.  The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. board, in a 5-0 voice
vote, agreed to seek comment on the proposal. Other agencies
including the Securities and Exchange Commission are scheduled
to consider the measure this week.  “Today’s announcement is an important next step in our
ongoing efforts to fundamentally reform America’s housing-
finance market and our nation’s broader financial system,”
Geithner said in a statement released by the Treasury Department
today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
