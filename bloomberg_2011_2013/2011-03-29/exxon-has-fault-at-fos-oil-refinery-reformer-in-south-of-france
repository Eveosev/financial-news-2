Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) , the largest U.S.
oil company, started a unit that produces blending components
for gasoline at its Fos refinery in southern France following a
malfunction early yesterday.  The unit has been starting up since last night,  Catherine Brun , an Exxon spokeswoman, said by phone from Paris.  Brun said earlier today there had been “a technical issue
with the catalytic reformer on Monday morning around 1 a.m.”.
The incident wasn’t related to the planned shutdown that took
place earlier in the quarter, she said.  Exxon started units at the 119,000 barrel-a-day refinery in
early March after maintenance that began in January. The plant
receives crude from the port of Marseille.  To contact the reporter on this story:
