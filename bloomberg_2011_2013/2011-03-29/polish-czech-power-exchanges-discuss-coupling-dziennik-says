The operators of the Polish and
Czech power markets have started talks on price coupling,
Dziennik Gazeta Prawna  reported  citing the head of the Warsaw-
based bourse Grzegorz Onichimowski.  The Polish power exchange, known as  Polpx , and  OTE AS , the
company that runs the Czech electricity market, could start the
link this year via a 1,000 megawatt cable, according to
Onichimowski.  On Dec. 15, Poland and  Sweden  connected their electricity
markets with a 600-megawatt undersea power cable, the Swe-Pol
link. Market coupling, the process whereby exchanges and grid
operators cooperate to send power through international cables
to places where prices are higher, is recommended by the
European Union to develop the regionâ€™s market.  To contact the reporter on this story:
