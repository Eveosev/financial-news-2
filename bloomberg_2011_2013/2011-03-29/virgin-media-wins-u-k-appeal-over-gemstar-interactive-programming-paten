Virgin Media Inc. (VMED)  won a U.K. appeal
ruling affirming it didn’t infringe European patents for
interactive program guides held by  Rovi Corp. (ROVI) ’s Gemstar-TV Guide
International because the patents were deemed invalid.  The ruling today by a three-judge panel in the Court of
Appeal in  London  upholds a lower court decision from 2009 that
two of Gemstar’s three patents in the case, which relate to
television channel-guide systems, weren’t innovative enough to
be valid. Gemstar didn’t appeal over the third invalid patent.  “The judge was plainly right,” Justice Robin Jacob said
in the ruling, referring the lower court’s earlier judgment.
“The appeal should be dismissed.”  The complaint over interactive program guides, which are
Gemstar’s main product, was filed in 2008 after the two sides
weren’t able to reach a licensing agreement, Los Angeles-based
Gemstar said at the time.  Today’s judgment “comprehensively” ends the three-year
legal dispute, said Scott Dresser, Virgin Media’s general
counsel.  “We have vigorously defended our assertion that Gemstar’s
claim was unfounded and that they should not have brought this
case and the court agrees emphatically,” Dresser said in a
statement.  Rovi, the  Santa Clara , California-based provider of TV
guides, parental controls and other interactive-video systems,
was formed in 2008 through the acquisition of Gemstar by
Macrovision Corp.  Rovi spokeswoman Linda Quach didn’t respond to e-mail and
voicemail messages seeking comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
