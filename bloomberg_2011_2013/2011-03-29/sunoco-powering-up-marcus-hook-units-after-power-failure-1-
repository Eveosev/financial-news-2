Sunoco Inc. (SUN)  began returning units
to service at its Marcus Hook refinery in Pennsylvania after
some were shut following a power failure.  The refinery “momentarily” lost power at 4:19 p.m. local
time yesterday, Lynda Rebarchak, a spokeswoman for the southeast
regional office of the  Pennsylvania Department of Environmental
Protection , said in an e-mail. At 8:30 p.m., Sunoco informed the
department that “all units were coming back online.”  The power failure occurred when a transmission customer was
performing work, Karen Muldoon Geus, a spokeswoman for PECO
Energy, a subsidiary of  Exelon Corp. (EXC) , said in an e-mail late
yesterday.  “The customer’s actions when switching caused a momentary
voltage depression in the immediate vicinity of Marcus Hook,”
she said.  There were no reported injuries, Thomas Golembeski, a
company spokesman, said in a telephone interview yesterday.  The refinery has a capacity of 194,000 barrels a day,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
