  South Africa ’s FTSE/JSE Africa All
Share Index snapped two days of losses, rising 224.30, or 0.7
percent, to 31,601.30 at 3:16 p.m. in Johannesburg.  The following are among the most active stocks in the South
African market today.  BHP Billiton Plc (BIL)  , the world’s largest mining
company, rose the first day in three, adding 3.29 rand, or 1.3
percent, to 263.29 rand. Copper will lead a rally in base metals
this year as increased consumption in  China  reduces inventories
and higher prices encourage stockpiling, according to researcher
Brook Hunt, a Wood Mackenzie company.  Mvelaphanda Group Ltd. (MVG)  , an investment holding
company, jumped the most in four months, after  Avusa Ltd. (AVU)  , the media company in which Mvelaphanda has a 25.5 percent
stake, received a takeover bid. Mvelaphanda increased as much as
9.7 percent, the most since Nov. 29, and last traded up 16
cents, or 5.4 percent, at 3.15 rand. Avusa fell the most since
March 10, declining 20 cents, or 0.8 percent, to 24.80 rand.  Primeserv Group Ltd. (PMV)  , the training-center

million rand to compensate customers of HRS for ending temporary
employment service agreements with them, the company said in a
