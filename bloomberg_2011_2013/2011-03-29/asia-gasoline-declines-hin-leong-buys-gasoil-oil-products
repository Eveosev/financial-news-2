Asia gasoline and naphtha fell for
a second day. Hin Leong Trading Pte bought gasoil and  fuel-oil 
cargoes in Singapore, the region’s biggest oil-trading center.  Light Distillates  Open-specification naphtha for delivery to  Japan  declined
1.2 percent to $974.50 a metric ton, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg. The premium of Japan-delivered naphtha to Brent
traded in  London , or the crack spread, dropped to $113.74 from
$119.41 at the end of Asian trading yesterday, Bloomberg data
showed.  Benchmark 92-RON gasoline slid 0.6 percent to $118.55 a
barrel, based on Bloomberg data. Gasoline’s premium to naphtha
rose 55 cents to $11.90. The spread, or reforming margin, has
widened as Japan’s March 11 earthquake increases gasoline demand
relative to naphtha.  Middle Distillates  Gasoil, or diesel, with 0.5 percent sulfur, fell 70 cents,
or 0.5 percent, to $130.65 a barrel, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg.  Jet fuel  dropped 80 cents, or 0.6 percent, to
$131.70. Each product declined for the fourth day, the longest
losing streak since November.  In Singapore, Hin Leong bought 150,000 barrels of 0.5
percent sulfur gasoil from Royal Dutch Shell Plc at parity to
benchmark quotes, the first time there’s been no premium since
March 11, traders said. The Singapore trader also purchased
another cargo from Singapore Petroleum Co. at plus 10 cents.  Vitol Group bought 250,000 barrels with 500 parts-per-
million sulfur from Mercuria Energy Ltd. at $2.80 a barrel over
average quotes for April, traders said. That’s the first
Singapore transaction for the grade since Dec. 13.  Gasoil’s premium to Asian benchmark Dubai crude gained 9
cents to $22.62 a barrel at 6:28 p.m. Singapore time, according
to PVM Oil Associates, a broker. This crack spread, a measure of
refining profit, increased for a second day.  Jet fuel’s premium to gasoil declined 10 cents to $1.10,
PVM said. A narrowing regrade shows it’s less profitable to
produce  aviation fuel  over diesel.  Shell sold 250,000 barrels of jet fuel to Glencore
International AG at parity to benchmark quotes, traders said.  Fuel Oil  Benchmark 180-centistoke fuel oil decreased 25 cents to
$649.50 a ton, according to Bloomberg data. The price of 380-
centistoke fuel oil, mainly used as marine fuel, was unchanged
at $636.  Fuel oil’s discount to Dubai crude narrowed $1.04 to $7.12
a barrel, the smallest loss from turning oil into residual
products since March 16, Bloomberg data showed. The premium of
180-centistoke fuel oil to 380-centistoke grade, or the
viscosity spread, was down 25 cents at $13.50 a ton, the
narrowest in a week.  Hin Leong bought two 20,000-ton cargoes of 380-centistoke
fuel oil from PetroChina Co. at $4.50 over benchmark quotes,
traders said. That’s the biggest premium since PetroChina sold
at plus $7.50 on March 4.  Refinery News  Formosa Petrochemical Corp.’s No. 2 naphtha cracker is
operating after a fire today, said Lin Keh-yen, a spokesman at
the Taiwan company.  Exxon Mobil Corp. resumed maintenance work at its  Singapore 
refining complex, the company’s largest globally, after a one-
day stoppage following the death of a worker yesterday.  To contact the reporters on this story:
