Bank of America Corp. (BAC) ’s Merrill
Lynch won dismissal of lawsuits brought by investors who said
they experienced losses as a result of aggressive investments in
collateralized debt obligations.  U.S. District Judge Jed Rakoff in New York yesterday
dismissed the two so-called double derivative suits brought on
behalf of the company in 2007 and 2009. The investors wanted the
largest U.S. lender by assets to force its Merrill unit to bring
claims against the subsidiary’s officers and directors, he said.  The allegations in the complaints describe “the kind of
risky behavior by high-ranking financiers that helped create the
economic crisis from which so many Americans continue to
suffer,” the judge said in his written ruling.  Rakoff concluded the shareholders failed to show that the
 Charlotte , North Carolina-based bank’s board was “so involved
in the underlying wrongdoing alleged in the derivative complaint
that it could not impartially consider a demand to pursue claims
against the Merrill officers and directors.”  Shirley Norton , a spokeswoman for Bank of America, which
acquired Merrill Lynch in 2009, said she didn’t have an
immediate comment.  CDOs are securities backed by corporate loans, mortgages,
auto loans, credit cards and other assets that are sliced into
layers carrying different levels of risk.  The cases are In Re: Merrill Lynch & Co. Securities
Litigation, 07-CV-09633, and N.A. Lambrecht v. O’Neal, 09-cv-
08259, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York
( Manhattan ).  To contact the reporter on this story:
