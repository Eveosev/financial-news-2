Russia’s wheat production may jump
to 52.5 million metric tons in the year starting July 1,
compared with 41.47 million a year earlier, when drought slashed
crops, a unit of the  U.S. Department of Agriculture  said in a
report posted today on its website.  Exports may rise to 4.5 million tons from 4.2 million tons
a year earlier, the USDA’s  Foreign Agricultural Service  said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
