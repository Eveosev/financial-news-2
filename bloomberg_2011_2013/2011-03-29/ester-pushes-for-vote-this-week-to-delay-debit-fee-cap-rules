U.S. Senator Jon Tester, a Montana
Democrat, is pushing for a chamber vote as soon as this week on
a bill that would delay the start of a U.S. cap on debit-card
transaction fees.  The bill would put off by two years  Federal Reserve 
rulemaking to cap debit-card interchange, or “swipe” fees,
charged to merchants on each transaction. Fed Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said today that the central bank wouldn’t meet an April
21 deadline to come up with a final rule. The cap, mandated by
the Dodd-Frank law that overhauled the financial industry last
year, must be in place by July 21.  Tester is trying to attach his bill as an amendment to
legislation concerning small-business investment. It’s unclear
when or if the Senate will consider his proposal, Andrea
Helling, his spokeswoman, said in an e-mail.  The Fed in December proposed capping debit interchange fees
at 12 cents a transaction, compared with the current formula
that averages 1.14 percent of the purchase price, or 44 cents.
The proposal, which may cut as much as $12 billion in revenue
from large lenders including  Bank of America Corp. (BAC)  and  JPMorgan
Chase & Co. (JPM) , triggered a lobbying fight between banks and
retailers.  Shares of San Francisco-based  Visa Inc. (V)  and Purchase, New
York-based  MasterCard Inc. (MA) , which set interchange fees and pass
the money to card-issuing banks, fell more than 10 percent after
the Fed’s plan was released Dec. 16 amid investor concern that
the caps will damage their business model.  To contact the reporter on this story:
