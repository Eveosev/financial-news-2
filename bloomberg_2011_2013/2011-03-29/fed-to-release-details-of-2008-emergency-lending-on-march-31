The  Federal Reserve  on March 31
will release details of the emergency loans it made to banks
during the financial crisis, the central bank said in  Washington 
today.  The data are being disclosed after the U.S. Supreme Court
rejected an industry appeal that aimed to shield the records
from public view. Last week the justices left intact a court
order that gives the Fed five days to release the records,
sought by Bloomberg Newsâ€™s parent company, Bloomberg LP.  To contact the reporter on this story:
