TPG Capital and VTB Capital, which
control 30.8 percent of Russian supermarket chain OOO Lenta,
challenged rival shareholder August Meyer to an auction to end
their dispute over management of the company, Vedomosti said.  TPG and VTB want to bid against Meyer, who owns about 41
percent of Lenta, for all the shares held by the three entities,
the Moscow-based newspaper said today, citing a letter TPG and
VTB sent to Meyer. The auction would go in steps of $50 million,
with a starting price based on a $2 billion valuation for the
whole company, Vedomosti said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
