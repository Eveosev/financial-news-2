Sales of 1-ounce American Eagle
silver coins are heading for a three-month low, according to the
 U.S. Mint .  About 2.767 million coins have been  sold  in March, data on
the Mint website showed. That would be the lowest since December
and the smallest March total since 2008. Purchases also declined
in February. In January, the monthly total reached 6.422
million, the highest since sales began in 1986.  Silver futures for May delivery dropped 10.1 cents, or 0.3
percent, to $36.987 an ounce on the Comex in  New York  today. The
price touched a 31-year high of $38.18 last week as investor
demand for precious metals as alternative investments surged.  To contact the reporter on this story:
