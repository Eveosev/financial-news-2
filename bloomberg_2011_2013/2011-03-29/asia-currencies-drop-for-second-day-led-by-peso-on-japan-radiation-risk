Asian currencies strengthened, led
by the South Korean won and Indian rupee, as stocks rebounded on
bets  Asia  will weather the impact of  Japan ’s earthquake and
radiation risks.  Currencies reversed earlier losses as the MSCI AC Asia
Pacific excluding Japan Index of shares rose 0.4 percent after
dropping as much as 0.2 percent. The won was supported by a
central bank report showing the current-account surplus widened
to $1.18 billion in February, from $154.7 million in January.
Official data later this week may show  India ’s current-account
deficit narrowed to $9.15 billion in the fourth quarter from
$15.8 billion in the previous three months, according to the
median estimate of economists in a Bloomberg survey.  “Asian currencies, including the won, rebounded due to a
recovery in risk appetite and we can see that in the stocks as
well,” said Ho Woei Chen, an economist at United Overseas Bank
Ltd. in Singapore.  Korea ’s “current-account surplus was
strong,” he said.  The won appreciated 0.4 percent to 1,110.25 per dollar as
of the 3 p.m. close in Seoul, the strongest level since Feb. 10,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The rupee climbed 0.2
percent to 44.77. The Bloomberg-JPMorgan Asia Dollar Index,
which tracks the region’s 10 most-active currencies, rose 0.1
percent, reversing an earlier loss.  Overseas investors bought more Korean equities than they
sold for the ninth straight day, exchange data showed. The
benchmark Kospi index of stocks rose 0.8 percent to close at its
highest level since Feb. 7.  Rate Increase  Malaysia’s ringgit traded near a 13-year high on
speculation policy makers will raise  interest rates  or allow
more currency appreciation to tackle inflation.  Bank Negara Malaysia signaled last week it would counter
rising prices and won’t limit the ringgit’s advance to protect
exporters. Consumer prices in Southeast Asia’s third-largest
economy rose by the most since April 2009 last month.  “The market expects more measures to tighten liquidity and
higher interest rates,” which should support the ringgit, said
D. Sivadass, a currency forwards trader at EON Capital Bhd. in
 Kuala Lumpur .  The ringgit was little changed at 3.0270 per dollar,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. It reached 3.0210 on
March 25, the highest level since October 1997. The currency has
strengthened every quarter since March 2009.  Elsewhere, the Philippine peso was little changed at 43.455
per dollar. Taiwan’s currency, Indonesia’s rupiah, and
 Singapore ’s dollar all strengthened 0.1 percent to NT$29.477,
8,713 and S$1.2613, respectively.  China ’s yuan gained 0.05
percent to 6.5610.  To contact the reporter on this story:
