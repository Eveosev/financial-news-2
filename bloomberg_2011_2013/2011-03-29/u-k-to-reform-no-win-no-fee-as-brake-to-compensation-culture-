The U.K. will change how lawyers
are paid in “no-win no-fee” court cases to stop spiraling
legal costs from harming the legal system, Justice Secretary
Kenneth Clarke announced today.  “Success fees” will be paid out of damages awarded to
claimants -- with a cap of 25 percent -- rather than by
defendants who are currently liable for as much as 100 percent
of the winning lawyer’s base costs on top of their usual fee,
the  Ministry of Justice  said. The reforms will also see a 10
percent increase in general damages.  “We have the mechanics that are moving us towards a
compensation culture and our proposals will arrest that
process,” Justice Minister Jonathan Djanogly told reporters in
London today. “No-win no-fee will continue, but the interests
of claimant and lawyer should be more closely aligned.”  The reforms will cut costs for businesses and public
agencies, Djanogly said, with the  National Health Service  saving
50 million pounds a year that it currently pays in success fees.
A supermarket chain told the department that 60 percent of the
pay-outs it makes on legal claims goes to lawyers with 40
percent going to the injured parties, Djanogly said, without
identifying the company.  The department also opened a consultation on reforms to the
civil justice system, including encouraging more use of
mediation, increasing the threshold for cases to go to the small
claims court to 15,000 pounds ($24,000) from 5,000 pounds and
increasing the use of online services to settle cases.  To contact the reporters on this story:
