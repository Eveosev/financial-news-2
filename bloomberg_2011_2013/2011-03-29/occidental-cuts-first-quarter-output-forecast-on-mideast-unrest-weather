Occidental Petroleum Corp. (OXY) , the
largest onshore crude oil producer in the continental U.S., cut
its first-quarter production forecast, citing disruptions in
Libya and Yemen and slower  capital spending  in Iraq.  Daily output of oil and natural gas will average the
equivalent of 711,000 to 721,000 barrels of oil, 29,000 barrels
a day less than previously expected for the quarter, Occidental,
based in Los Angles, said today in slides prepared for a
conference in New Orleans.  Production from Libya, Yemen and Iraq will be 15,000
barrels a day lower than expected, according to the filing. Bad
weather in the U.S. and  oil prices  each will cause Occidental to
lower output by 7,000 barrels a day, the company said.  The announcement was made before regular trading began on
U.S. markets. Occidental rose 2 cents to $100.87 yesterday in
New York Stock Exchange composite trading.  To contact the reporter on this story:
