Harry & David Holdings Inc., the
gift-box retailer that began selling fruit by mail in the 1930s,
won interim court permission to borrow as much as $100 million
to use while it reorganizes in bankruptcy.  U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Mary Walrath in Wilmington,  Delaware ,
approved the request today, saying she will sign an order
authorizing the loan after wording changes.  The money will be necessary for the company to prepare for
the holiday season, when Harry & David makes the majority of its
sales, it said.  “Liquidity is pretty much shot,” David G. Heiman, a
lawyer for the company, said in court.  Harry & David, based in Medford,  Oregon , blamed competition
from Internet retailers, large, warehouse-style stores and the
recession for its bankruptcy.  The company has an agreement to be taken over by
noteholders in exchange canceling more than $200 million in
debt, Heiman told Walrath today in court. That agreement would
be part of a reorganization plan needing court approval.  Under the company’s bankruptcy loan agreement, Harry &
David will pay about $4 million in fees, company attorney Brad Erens told Walrath. The company is also required to exit
bankruptcy by Oct. 1, he said in court.  “We have some measure of confidence that we can get though
this case is six months or less,” Heiman said in court.  The case is In re Harry & David Holdings, Inc., 11-10884,
 U.S. Bankruptcy Court , District of Delaware (Wilmington).  To contact the reporter on this story:
