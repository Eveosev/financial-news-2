A 70-year-old Scotch whisky sold
for 15,000 pounds ($24,000) at an auction in Edinburgh to raise
money for Japanese earthquake victims.  The malt was the first of 100 decanters of 1940 Gordon &
MacPhail Glenlivet on sale this year, auctioneer Bonhams said in
a statement. It had a guide price of 13,000 pounds to 15,000
pounds. The proceeds went to the  Red Cross  for Japan.  The number of dead and missing following the magnitude-9
earthquake and subsequent tsunami that struck Japan on March 11
was 28,321 as of 10 a.m. local time today, according to the
 National Police Agency  in Tokyo.  To contact the reporter on the story:
