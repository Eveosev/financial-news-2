Chile ’s peso slid as the price of
copper, the country’s biggest export, fell on concern that
demand from  China , the largest customer, may wane.  The peso weakened 0.4 percent to 482.15 per  U.S. dollar  as
of 9:35 a.m. New York time from 480.45 yesterday. It has fallen
the most among major Latin American currencies this year after
the central bank started buying $50 million of U.S. currency a
day to stem its advance.  “We started off with copper falling and some euro weakness
against the dollar,” said Alejandro Araya, a trader at Banco
Santander Chile in Santiago. “Copper has recovered somewhat and
the euro stabilized. The peso is still in the 478 to 484 per
dollar range.”  Copper fell for a fourth day as Chinese stocks declined on
speculation the government will raise  interest rates . The peso
is down 1.3 percent this month as the cost of West Texas
Intermediate crude oil pushed above $100 a barrel.  Chile relies on imports for more than 99 percent of its oil
needs and crude is its largest import, so when energy prices
rise and copper falls the country’s trade surplus narrows,
reducing the value of its currency.  Foreign investors trimmed bets against the Chilean peso in
the forwards market to $2.3 billion on March 25 from $2.5
billion a day earlier and $3 billion on March 17, according to
central bank data.  The price of copper for May delivery declined as much as
1.3 percent to $4.2925 a pound before recovering to $4.3185 as
of 9:53 a.m. New York time.  To contact the reporter on this story:
