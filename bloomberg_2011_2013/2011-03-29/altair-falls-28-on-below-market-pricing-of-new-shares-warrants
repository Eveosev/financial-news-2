Altair Nanotechnologies Inc. (ALTI) , a
U.S.-based lithium-ion battery maker, fell the most in almost
eight years after announcing a common share and warrants
offering priced 20 percent below yesterday’s closing price.  Altair fell as much as 28 percent earlier today before
trading off 61 cents, or 27 percent, at $1.62 a share at 11:53
a.m. in Nasdaq Composite trading. It was the biggest intraday
decline since July 17, 2003.  Institutional investors will purchase 3.6 million shares at
$1.784 a share and warrants to purchase one share for every two
shares of common stock purchased for $6.4 million in proceeds,
the Reno, Nevada-based company said today in a statement. JMP
Securities LLC of  San Francisco  acted as the exclusive placement
agent for the transaction.  Should Altair’s previously announced transaction with Canon
Investment Holdings not close, the company said it will issue
the investors a maximum additional 1.8 million shares. Canon
agreed in September to buy more than half of Altair’s shares for
$48.9 million.  The company will use the proceeds from the offering for
general corporate purposes and for working capital to execute
the recently announced  customer contracts .  Altair says its energy storage systems for smart grid,
transport and renewable energy integration, use  lithium titanate 
in place of graphite in conventional  lithium-ion batteries . The
technology results in faster charge and discharge rates, longer
cycle life, greater thermal stability and extreme temperature
endurance, according to Altair.  To contact the reporter on this story:
