Nicolas Correa SA (NEA)  will return to
profit in the second half of this year after it completes the
reshuffle of its management team and reduces the number of
products it manufactures,  El Confidencial  said, citing Chairman
Jose Ignacio Nicolas Correa.  Nicolas Correa, which in future will be called Correanayak,
has named three general directors to coordinate the companyâ€™s
different factories and units after its merger with Industrias
Anayak in 2005, El Confidencial added.  To contact the reporters on this story:
