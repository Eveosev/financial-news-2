Masraf Al Rayan (MARK) , Qatar’s second-
biggest Islamic lender, plans to sell Islamic bonds worth as
much as $1 billion in the fourth quarter after its board
received shareholder approval, Chairman Hussain Ali Al-Abdalla
said.  The company is also seeking to buy a stake in a Saudi bank,
he told the general meeting of shareholders late yesterday in
Doha, without naming the lender.  “The aim from issuing the sukuk is to manage the balance
sheet more efficiently,” he said. The banks that will manage
the sale haven’t been determined, he said.  Masraf is the second Islamic lender to approve a sukuk sale
this year after Qatar International Islamic Bank shareholders
authorized as much as $700 million in five-year convertible
sukuks at a meeting earlier this month.  Sales of Islamic bonds may rise to $47 billion this year,
the highest level since before the world financial crisis in
2007, to finance infrastructure spending in Islamic countries,
Mufti Talha Ahmad, an associate shariah manager at BMB Advisors
UK Ltd. Qatar, said earlier this month.  Masraf, the best-performing stock on in the  QE Index (DSM)  of
Qatari companies, fell 0.6 percent to 22.26 riyals on the Qatar
Exchange at 10:48 a.m. today.  To contact the reporters on this story:
