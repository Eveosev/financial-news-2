South African stocks rose for the
first time in three days, led by MTN Group Ltd.,  Africa ’s
biggest mobile-network operator.  The FTSE/JSE Africa All Share Index added 0.6 percent to
31,559.57 at 10:56 a.m. in Johannesburg. MTN climbed 3.31 rand,
or 2.5 percent, to 134.50 rand.  BHP Billiton Plc (BIL) , the world’s biggest mining company,
advanced 1 percent to 262.65 rand. Copper, which reached a
record last month, will lead a rally in base metals this year as
increased consumption in China cuts inventories and higher
prices encourage stockpiling, according to researcher Brook
Hunt, a Wood Mackenzie company.  To contact the reporter on this story:
