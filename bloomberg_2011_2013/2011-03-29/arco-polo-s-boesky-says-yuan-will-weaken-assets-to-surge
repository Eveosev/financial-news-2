Zuo Jiqing, Beijing-based general
manager of fixed income at China Life Asset Management Co.,
comments on the nation’s interbank bond market.  On market disclosure:  “When companies issue bonds they provide information but
there is no follow-up. If there is no compulsory disclosure
system it hurts investors.”  On credit ratings:  “Ratings are not very effective. If the regulators say
they have to be AA then all the bonds will be AA.” In China
companies will change a credit rating company if they’re not
happy with the rating they receive, Zuo said.  On the use of internal credit checks:  “Our internal ratings are hugely different from the
external ratings.”  --Henry Sanderson. Editors: Hugh Chow,  Shelley Smith   To contact the reporter on this story:
