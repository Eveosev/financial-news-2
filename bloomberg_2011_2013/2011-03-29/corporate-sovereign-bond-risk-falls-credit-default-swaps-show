The cost of insuring against
default on European corporate and sovereign bonds fell,
according to traders of credit-default swaps.  Contracts on the Markit iTraxx Crossover Index of 40
companies with mostly high-yield credit ratings declined 3 basis
points to 385, according to JPMorgan Chase & Co. at 11:30 a.m.
in London. The index is a benchmark for the cost of protecting
bonds against default and a decline signals improvement in
perceptions of  credit quality .  The Markit iTraxx Europe Index of 125 companies with
investment-grade ratings dropped 0.25 basis point to 102. The
Markit iTraxx Financial Index of 25 banks and insurers fell 1 to
143.5. The Markit iTraxx SovX Western Europe Index of swaps
linked to 15 governments declined 3 basis points to 169.  A basis point on a credit-default swap protecting 10
million euros ($14.1 million) of debt from default for five
years is equivalent to 1,000 euros a year. Swaps pay the buyer
face value in exchange for the underlying securities or the cash
equivalent should a borrower fail to adhere to its debt
agreements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
