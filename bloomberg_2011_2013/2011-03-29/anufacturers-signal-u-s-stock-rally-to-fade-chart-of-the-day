U.S. manufacturers are signaling
that a two-year surge in stocks may give way to smaller gains,
according to Jeffrey Kleintop, chief market strategist at LPL
Financial Corp.  The CHART OF THE DAY compares the  Institute for Supply
Management ’s manufacturing index, based on a monthly survey of
corporate purchasing managers, with the year-to-year percentage
change in the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index.  February’s ISM reading of 61.4 matched its peak in May
2004, which in turn was the highest level since 1983. The March
figure will be published on April 1, and economists surveyed by
Bloomberg anticipate a drop to 61 on average. Readings of more
than 50 signal growth.  “With momentum in the ISM at or near a peak, stock-market
performance is likely to soften,” Kleintop wrote yesterday in a
report. He cited the S&P 500’s performance before and after nine
highs in the manufacturing gauge since 1976.  In the first six months after the ISM topped out, the  S&P
500  rose by an average of 1.3 percent. The comparable 12-month
figure was 5.2 percent, far from the 18 percent average during
the preceding 12 months.  “It would be (April) foolish to expect the powerful pace
of gains over the past two years to continue,” Kleintop wrote.
At yesterday’s close, the S&P 500 was 94 percent higher than its
March 2009 low. High-yield bonds and commodities may be more
rewarding than stocks “in the near future,” he added.  To contact the reporter on this story:
