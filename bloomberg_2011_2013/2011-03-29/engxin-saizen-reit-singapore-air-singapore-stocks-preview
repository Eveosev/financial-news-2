2010, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The following shares were among the most active in the

companies with facilities in Japan advanced as companies from
Hitachi Ltd. to IHI Corp. restarted some operations that were
halted following the March 11 earthquake.  Global Logistic Properties Ltd. (GLP)  , the logistics
that counts Japan as its biggest market, climbed 3.8 percent to
S$1.90, the best performer on the benchmark Straits Times Index.

of revenue from Japan, gained 2.3 percent to 90.5 Singapore
cents.  Palm-oil suppliers: Crude palm-oil futures for June

arrivals this year as tourists avoiding Japan in the aftermath
of the March 11 earthquake and ensuing nuclear crisis look for
alternative destinations, DBS Group Holdings Ltd said.  “Potential inbound travelers into Japan could look for
alternative holiday destinations in the coming months,” Derek Tan, an analyst at DBS Group, wrote in a note to clients today.

which might more than offset any potential weakness from
Japan.”  CDL Hospitality Trusts (CDREIT)  , the hotel operator
