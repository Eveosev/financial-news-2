China ’s yuan strengthened to near a
17-year high on speculation the central bank will lift  interest
rates  or lenders’ reserve requirements to curb inflation.  The aftermath of Japan’s earthquake and tsunami, coupled
with higher  oil prices , may worsen inflation in China, according
to a report from Bank of America-Merrill Lynch released today.
Consumer prices in Asia’s largest economy may rise as much as
5.5 percent in March from a year earlier, Ting Lu, a Hong Kong-
based economist at Bank of America, said in the report. Prices
gained 4.9 percent in February, official data show.  “The market is speculating the central bank will hike
reserve requirements or interest rates if it sees higher
inflation,” said Carlos Cheung, a foreign-exchange dealer at
Bank of Communications Co. in  Hong Kong . “If consumer-price
growth breaks the 5 percent mark, it’s likely the People’s Bank
of China will hike again.”  The yuan advanced 0.05 percent to 6.5610 as of the 4:30 p.m.
close of trading in Shanghai, according to the China Foreign
Exchange Trade System. It touched 6.5549 on March 25, the
strongest level since the country unified official and market
exchange rates at the end of 1993. In Hong Kong’s offshore
market, the currency strengthened 0.02 percent to 6.5625.  Twelve-month non-deliverable forwards were little changed
at 6.4505 per dollar in Hong Kong, reflecting bets the yuan will
strengthen 1.7 percent in a year, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  China’s central bank set the  reference rate  0.01 percent
weaker at 6.5625. The currency is allowed to trade up to 0.5
percent on either side of the official rate in Shanghai.  To contact the reporter on this story:
