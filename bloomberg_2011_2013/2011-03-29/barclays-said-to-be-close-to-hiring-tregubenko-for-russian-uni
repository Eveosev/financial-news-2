Barclays Capital  is close to hiring
former UBS AG banker Fedor Tregubenko to oversee its Russian
 investment banking  operations, said three people with knowledge
of the talks.  The appointment would be Barclays’s most senior appointment
in Moscow since Bob Foresman became chief executive officer of
the Russian unit in 2009. Foresman said last June the London-
based bank planned to hire dozens of bankers in  Russia  to help
it become the leading foreign investment bank in Moscow within
three years.  Prime Minister Vladimir Putin’s government selected 10
banks in October to help it raise at least 1 trillion rubles
($34 billion) selling assets over the next three years. Barclays
Capital, the securities unit of London-based  Barclays Plc (BARC) , was
among 13 banks the government added in December to the list of
companies that will work on the asset sales.  Barclays is selling its Russian consumer unit to focus on
investment banking in Russia, according to Barclays Capital
Chairman Hans-Joerg Rudloff. The lender sees “no scale” in the
consumer unit, which it acquired for $75 million in March 2008,
Rudloff said in a Feb. 16 interview.  Tregubenko declined to comment by text message today.
