China will investigate possible
price increases for goods sold by  Unilever NV (UNA)  and  Tingyi Cayman
Islands Holding Corp. (322) , China National Radio reported.  Policymakers were “highly concerned” about media reports
that companies are planning to raise prices on daily consumer
goods, the broadcaster said today, citing an unidentified
official at the National Development and Reform Commission.  The NDRC has contacted companies to urge them not to
“casually” raise prices on consumer goods, the station said.
China’s economic planning body will send a team to investigate
the cases, according to the report, which identified Unilever
and Tingyi as two companies among several under scrutiny.  Consumer prices rose at an annual pace of 4.9 percent in
February, exceeding a government target of 4 percent for this
year. Premier  Wen Jiabao  is seeking to prevent price increases
from stirring social unrest.  Consumer goods such as laundry products and instant noodles
are daily necessities, and price changes will “directly”
affect citizens, the broadcaster said, citing the NDRC official.  China’s central bank said yesterday controlling inflation
in the world’s fastest-growing major economy remains its main
task. The country has raised  interest rates  three times since
mid-October to rein in price gains.  Five calls to Unilever’s Shanghai office and Tingyi’s
Tianjin office after business hours today weren’t answered.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
