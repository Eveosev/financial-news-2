Greece ’s credit rating was cut two
steps by Standard and Poor’s on concern the country may be
required to restructure its debt and bondholders may lose out.  The rating was lowered to BB- from BB+ by S&P, according to
a statement today. The outlook remains negative, according to
the statement.  A meeting of EU leaders in Brussels on March 25 affirmed a
decision earlier this month to ease the terms of 110 billion-
euro ($155 billion) in emergency loans granted to Greece last
year in return for a program of budget cuts. The leaders also
agreed that repayment of loans granted through the European
Stability Mechanism, the region’s permanent debt crisis
mechanism from 2013, would take a priority in the event of a
debt restructuring. S&P said on March 15 that the agreement
would be “detrimental” to existing bondholders.  The March 25 statement “confirms our previously published
expectations that sovereign-debt restructuring is a potential
pre-condition to borrowing from the ESM,” according to S&P. The
rating company also cited concerns that senior unsecured
government debt will be subordinated to ESM loans.  To contact the reporter on this story:
