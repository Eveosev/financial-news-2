The youth wing of  South Africa ’s
ruling  African National Congress  denied that its leader,  Julius
Malema , criticized President  Jacob Zuma  about supporting a no-
fly zone in  Libya .  Malema “never mentioned President Zuma” in a speech this
weekend, as reported by Johannesburg-based The Star newspaper
today, the ANC Youth League said in an e-mailed statement. The
youth league said it instructed lawyers to demand Independent
News & Media Plc, which publishes the newspaper, to retract the
story.  The Star reported today that Malema told a youth league
conference in the north eastern province of Limpopo that Zuma
was surrounded by “bad advisers” and that he was “dismayed”
by some of the government’s decisions.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
