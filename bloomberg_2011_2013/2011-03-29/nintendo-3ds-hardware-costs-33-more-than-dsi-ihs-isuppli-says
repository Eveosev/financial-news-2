Nintendo Co.’s component costs for
the new 3DS handheld player are at least 33 percent higher than
with the preceding DSi model because of the 3-D display, extra
memory and motion-sensors, researcher IHS Inc.’s ISuppli said.  The total cost of the 3DS hardware is $100.71, compared
with $75.58 for DSi based on prices at the time of the earlier
model’s introduction more than two years ago, the industry
researcher said in a  statement  yesterday. Yasuhiro Minagawa, a
spokesman at Kyoto-based Nintendo, declined to comment.  The 3DS, which plays 3-D images without the need for
special glasses, went on sale in the U.S. and  Europe  in the past
week. The player sold about 371,000 units in two days following
its debut in Japan on Feb. 26, according to Tokyo-based
researcher Enterbrain Inc.  Nintendo fell 1.4 percent to 21,540 yen as of the 11 a.m.
trading break on the Osaka Securities Exchange. The shares have
lost 9.6 percent this year, after climbing 8.1 percent in 2010.  The 3DS screens are crisper and larger, raising the cost of
the displays to $33.80, from $21.95 for the DSi, IHS ISuppli
said. Both models use displays made by Sharp Corp., it said.  Nintendo also increased memory storage eightfold to 16
gigabytes, costing $8.36, compared with $3.61 for the DSi,
according to the report. The inclusion of a gyroscope and
accelerometer increased the cost of user-interface parts to
$6.81 from $3.98, it said.  The cost assessment doesn’t include manufacturing,
software, licensing and royalty costs, IHS ISuppli said. At
current costs, the difference between the materials bill for the
two models would be even greater, the researcher added.  To contact the reporter on this story:
