Kenyan lenders rallied after the
East African nation’s  central bank  said the banking industry
will probably see increased profit this year as credit to
businesses expands.  Kenya Commercial Bank Ltd. (KNCB) , country’s biggest lender by
outlets, advanced 1.1 percent to 23.25 shillings, a three-week
high, by the 3 p.m. close in Nairobi.  Barclays Bank of Kenya
Ltd. (BCBL) , the country’s second-biggest lender, rose 0.9 percent to
58 shillings, the strongest close in a week.  Commercial banks forecast that lending to private industry
may surge by as much as 20 percent over the rest of this year,
Governor Njuguna Ndung’u said in an e-mailed statement
yesterday. The banks lent 41.3 billion shillings ($490.5
million) to businesses in January and February, the same amount
that was issued in the entire fourth quarter, he said.  Bank earnings in East Africa’s largest economy grew last
year as accelerating economic growth spurred more Kenyans to
take out loans, open bank accounts and demand other financial
services. The industry’s combined pretax profit surged 46
percent to 66 billion shillings in the 11 months through
November 2010 on loan growth and higher income from fees and
commissions, the  Central Bank of Kenya  said on Feb. 11.  To contact the reporter on this story:
