The U.S. Northeast, particularly
 Boston , may end the week and start the month with snow. It’s too
early to determine whether  New York City  will get more snow from
the system, according to the  National Weather Service .  The storm would arrive 14 years after another March 31-
April 1 system left 25.4 inches (64.5 centimeters) in Boston and
33 inches (84 centimeters) in neighboring Worcester,
Massachusetts, according to the weather service.  New York ’s snowfall will be “zero to some,” said Lauren
Nash, a weather service meteorologist in Upton, New York. “We
can’t put an amount on it yet.”  A low-pressure system will strengthen off the Atlantic
coast and move up past the U.S. Northeast, said Matt Doody, a
weather service meteorologist in Taunton,  Massachusetts . The
snowfall may be a few flakes or 10 inches, depending on the
storm’s track and the amount of cold air that descends over the
region, he said.  Doody said the storm will probably start as snow and then
change to rain before changing back to snow. How long it rains
will also determine how much snow stays on the ground, he said.  Since December, 61.9 inches of snow has fallen in Central
Park, making this the third-snowiest year on record, according
to the weather service. The top season was 1995-96, when 75.6
inches of snow fell in Central Park.  Boston has had 79.5 inches of snow, according to the
weather service.  To contact the reporter on this story:
