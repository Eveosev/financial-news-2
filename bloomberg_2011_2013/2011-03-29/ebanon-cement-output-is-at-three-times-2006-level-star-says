Cement production in Lebanon is
running at three times the level of 2006, when it amounted to 2
million tons, the  Daily Star  reported, citing information given
by caretaker Industry Minister Apraham Dedeyan at a conference.  Three manufacturers produce most of Lebanon’s cement; 5
million tons a year are used locally and 1 million tons are
exported, the  newspaper  said.  Syria and  Iraq  take the bulk of Lebanon’s cement exports,
the  newspaper  reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
