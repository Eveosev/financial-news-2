Hochschild Mining Plc (HOC) , a producer
of silver in  Peru , said full-year profit rose 60 percent after
silver prices surged.  Net income climbed to $156.6 million in 2010 from $98.1
million a year earlier, the company said today in a statement.
Sales advanced 39 percent to $752.3 million.  Silver prices have increased as global demand gains and
inventories of the metal shrink. Prices averaged $20.24 an ounce
in the period, compared with $14.70 an ounce a year earlier.
Silver for immediate delivery has advanced for eight consecutive
quarters and rose to a 31-year high last week.  Hochschild plans to boost spending on exploration by 40
percent this year as it seeks new projects to reverse declining
silver output. The company, which produced 26.4 million so-
called attributable silver equivalent ounces in 2010, forecast
that output will fall to 22.5 million ounces this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
