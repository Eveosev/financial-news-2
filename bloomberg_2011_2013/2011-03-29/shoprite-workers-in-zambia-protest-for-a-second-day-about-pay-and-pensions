Shoprite Holdings Ltd. (SHP)  workers
protested outside stores in Zambia for a second day to demand
improved pay and working conditions, said Seth Paraza, an
industry labor union official.  As many as 3,000 employees remained on strike after failed
talks between the company, government and unions yesterday,
Paraza, the general secretary of the National Union of
Commercial and Industry Workers, said in a phone interview today
from Lusaka, the capital. The minister of labor is meeting
unions again today, a spokesman for Labour and Social Security
Minister Austin Liato said by phone. Calls to Shoprite in Lusaka
today weren’t answered.  “If the standoff continues and Shoprite management does
not agree to our demands, it may take a long time before our
3,000 members can go back to work,” Paraza said.  Shoprite,  Africa ’s largest food retailer, operates 18
stores in the southern African country. The union is demanding
an increase in the minimum monthly wage, a better pension and a
for workers to be given permanent jobs, Paraza said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
