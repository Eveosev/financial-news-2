The trustee liquidating  Bernard Madoff ’s firm won approval of an agreement that would allow a
sale of Madoff’s $7 million yacht “Bull” to benefit the con-
man’s investors.  U.S. Bankruptcy Judge  Burton Lifland  in Manhattan approved
the arrangement today.  Under the deal struck by trustee  Irving Picard , Financiere
Meeschaert SA will pay $500,000 to Madoff Securities
International Ltd., the U.K. arm of Madoff’s firm, and will drop
its claim to the yacht, according to a February court filing.
That will allow Picard to stake a claim to the proceeds of a
sale of the boat on behalf of investors.  At Meeschaert’s request, French authorities seized the 27-
meter-long (89-foot) vessel in the harbor of Cap D’Antibes in
April 2009. The firm, which invested in Madoff’s  Ponzi scheme ,
sued in France for control of the vessel to return money to its
clients, its lawyer said last year.  In November 2009, the U.S. Marshals Service sold another of
Madoff’s yachts, a 55-foot 1969 Rybovich Sportfish, also called
“Bull,” for $700,000.  “Sitting Bull,” a 38-foot 2003 Shelter Island Runabout
Sport, went for $320,000. “Little Bull,” a 24-foot 2000
center-console boat from Maverick Boat Co., brought in $21,000.
The marshals were responsible for Madoff’s assets in the U.S.  Madoff, who pleaded guilty to fraud charges, is serving 150
years in prison for the largest Ponzi scheme in U.S. history.
Investors lost about $20 billion in principal, Picard has said.
Authorities have collected almost $10 billion for victims.  The case is Securities Investor Protection Corp. v. Bernard
L. Madoff Investment Securities LLC, 08-01789,  U.S. Bankruptcy
Court , Southern District of  New York  (Manhattan).  To contact the reporters on this story:
