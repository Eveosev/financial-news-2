Mauritius’s central bank will cap
commercial banks’ holdings of Treasury bills from April, Bank of
Mauritius Governor Rundheersing Bheenick said.  The limit will start at 20 percent of a bank’s rupee
deposits, Bheenick told reporters today in  Port Louis , the
capital. The decision will lead commercial banks to lend more to
the public and create a secondary market, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
