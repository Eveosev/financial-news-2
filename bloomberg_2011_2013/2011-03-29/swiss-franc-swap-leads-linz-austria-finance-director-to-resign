Werner Penn, the finance director
of  Austria ’s third biggest city, Linz, resigned today after he
entered into a 195 million Swiss franc ($211 million) swap
contract without getting approval from city agencies.  The swap, which was entered into in 2007 to secure a Swiss
franc bond, was provided by Bawag PSK Bank, the City of Linz
said in an OTS statement today. Bawag didn’t inform Linz about
the potential risks of the swap, according to the statement.  Disputes over swap agreements typically used by municipal
agencies to lower interest payments have spread through Europe
with lawsuits in Germany, Italy and the U.K.  Deutsche Bank AG (DBK)  on
March 22 lost a case over swaps in the first ruling by Germany’s
highest court concerning sales of the products  Linz’s senate will vote on March 31 on whether to file a
lawsuit seeking to annul the swap agreement and the municipal
council will vote on the suit on April 7.  “Bawag PSK rejects Linz’s claims vehemently,” the bank
said in an e-mailed statement today. Penn is on sick leave,
according to Waltraud Haslinger, a spokeswoman for the office of
Linz’s finance chief.  To contact the reporter on this story:
