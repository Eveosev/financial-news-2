Rwanda  plans to establish an early-
warning system for extreme weather to help boost revenue from
farming, said John Ntaganda Semafara, director of meteorology at
the Infrastructure Ministry.  Improved  weather forecasts  may help farmers in coffee- and
tea-growing regions of the East African country, Semafara said
in an interview yesterday in Kigali, the capital.  “Agriculture is the backbone of the economy,” he said.  Rwanda relies on farming to generate about 42 percent of
its economic output and 90 percent of its employment, according
to the  CIA World Factbook . The country plans to boost coffee
production by 10 percent to 22,000 metric tons this year, while
tea output may increase 18 percent to 26,000 metric tons,
according to the industry regulators.  Starbucks Corp. (SBUX) , the
world’s largest coffee-shop chain, is the biggest buyer of
Rwanda’s coffee.  Felix Kizito Mugabo, general manager of the Rubaya tea
estate, a grower for  Rwanda Mountain Tea , said the government
faces challenges in setting up the early-warning system as it
will need to train farmers and acquire equipment including a
radar system to predict hail storms. Unexpected frosts and hail
can damage the crop, he said in an interview.  “Once frost bite has affected an area, you may lose
production for up to 1 ½ months,” he said.  Rwanda is rebuilding its economy after a genocide in 1994
that left 800,000 people dead following 100 days of ethnic
fighting.  To contact the reporter on this story:
