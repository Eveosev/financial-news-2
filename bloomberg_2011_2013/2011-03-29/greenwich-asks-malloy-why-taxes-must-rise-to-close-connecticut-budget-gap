Connecticut  Governor Dannel Malloy
went to Greenwich yesterday to take questions on his revenue-
raising plans from residents of the town that paid the most in
2009 income taxes of any community in the state.  “Can we trust your word?” asked Peter Crumbine, 72, a
former Greenwich selectman, who reminded Malloy, a Democrat,
that he had promised not to impose new levies on property. The
governor’s plan puts new taxes on high-priced cars and boats,
and ends a $500 property-tax credit.  A statewide levy on real estate wouldn’t get his support,
Malloy, 55, said. The first-term governor’s budget proposal for
the fiscal year that begins in July counts on $1.5 billion from
tax increases on earnings and retail sales.  Connecticut, the wealthiest U.S. state, collected $612.7
million in income taxes from Greenwich residents in 2009, or
about 13 percent of the total and the most from any community,
Revenue Department figures  show . Merchants in the town of more
than 60,000 people collected $36.1 million in sales and use
taxes in 2007, or about 2.4 percent of statewide receipts.  “There is a high price associated with taxing high income
earners,” said Representative Lile Gibbons, a Greenwich
Republican, to cheers and whistles from the audience. As for the
luxury taxes, she said that she believes they will result in
lower state revenue.  Motive to Move  “What is my incentive to live here?” asked Julia
Chiappetta, a small-business owner and Greenwich resident. “Why
not move to  Florida ?” she asked, to laughter and applause in
the packed auditorium at the Eastern Middle School.  “I think Greenwich is a lot nicer than Florida,” Malloy
said in response. “I think Greenwich is a great place to live
and I think you do, too.”  Greenwich, about 30 miles (48 kilometers) northeast of
midtown  Manhattan , has attracted about 100  hedge funds . It is
home to industry leaders including  Paul Tudor Jones , founder of
Tudor Investment Corp., and  Steven A. Cohen , the billionaire who
runs SAC Capital Advisors LP.  In his budget plan, Malloy wants to raise the retail-sales
levy to 6.25 percent from 6 percent, drop exemptions for
clothing and tax services such as dog grooming, car washes and
haircuts. He would also add a retail-store surcharge of 0.1
percentage point to benefit local communities.  An additional 3 percentage-point levy would be charged on
sales of so-called  luxury goods  such as cars valued at $50,000
or more, $100,000 boats and $1,000 clothing. The increase would
make the top rate for some items 9.35 percent.  ‘Crushing’ Blow  “It will be crushing to Greenwich business,” Terry
Betteridge, who owns Betteridge Jewelers in the town’s central
retail district, said by telephone before the meeting. “I voted
for him. I like him a lot. But this is crazy.”  A Quinnipiac University  survey  of 1,693 registered voters
statewide showed 51 percent disapproved of Malloy’s handling of
the budget, while 32 percent approved, according to figures
released March 9. The Hamden-based school’s poll also showed
that two-thirds of respondents said his plan would increase
taxes too much. The telephone survey was conducted March 1-7.  “Across the state, people feel just the same way we do,”
 Jim Campbell , the Republican Town Committee chairman, said by
telephone before the meeting. “People don’t think this is the
time for big tax hikes.”  Budget Proposal  Malloy asked the Democrat-controlled Legislature on Feb. 16
to pass a $17.9 billion general-fund budget for the 12 months
that begin in July and an $18.4 billion plan for the following
year. To close a $3.3 billion gap projected for fiscal 2012, the
governor also seeks $1 billion in  savings  and concessions from
state workers and $758 million of spending cuts.  The governor  plans  17 public meetings to gather suggestions,
according to Colleen Flanagan, a spokeswoman. The Legislature in
Hartford is also holding  hearings  on the plan.  Malloy also has proposed a more progressive income tax,
currently 5 percent for joint filers with incomes of $20,000 to
$1 million. The governor would increase the levy on those making
$100,000 to $200,000 to 5.5 percent.  He would add five new brackets, with the tax rising to 5.75
percent for those earning as much as $400,000, 6 percent for
incomes topping out at $600,000, 6.25 percent for up to $800,000
and 6.5 percent for as much as $1 million. Couples reporting
more than $1 million would pay 6.7 percent.  Fur coats, bow ties and pearls dotted the Greenwich crowd.  Alfred D. Morgan, 94, a former Lehman Brothers Holdings
Inc. executive who arrived with his chauffeur, came to support
Malloy.  “He has to do what is, unfortunately, the necessity in
this state,” Morgan said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
