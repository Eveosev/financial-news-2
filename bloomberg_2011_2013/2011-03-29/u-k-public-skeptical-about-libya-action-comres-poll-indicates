Forty-seven percent of the U.K.
public think the government was wrong to send British forces to
attack  Libya ’s President  Muammar Qaddafi , against 43 percent who
approve of the decision, according to a ComRes opinion poll
carried out for the Independent.  Seventy-one percent of those who responded said they’re
concerned that the military action might embroil Britain in a
prolonged war such as that in  Iraq , against 24 percent who
aren’t worried, the newspaper reported.  The poll indicated that the Labour opposition is favored by
41 percent of the public, against 35 percent for the
Conservatives and 13 percent for the Liberal Democrats, who
together make up the coalition government, the newspaper said.   ComRes telephoned a random sample of 1,000 adults between
March 25 and March 27; figures were weighted so as to be
representative of all adults and by past vote recall, the
Independent reported.  Click here for web link  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
