KGHM Polska Miedz SA (KGH)  will probably
decide on a dividend payout in May after the Polish sole copper
producer’s supervisory board didn’t discuss it yesterday,
 Rzeczpospolita  reported, without saying where it got the
information.  KGHM supervisors yesterday approved the company’s 2010
earnings, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
