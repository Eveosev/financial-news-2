Macedonia’s state-run power
producer  Elektrani na Makedonija AD  said its newest
hydroelectric plant, St. Petka near the capital Skopje, will be
connected to the grid by the end of 2011, two years behind
original schedule.  The 36.4-megawatt facility on the Treska River will be
completed at the planned cost of 64.2 million euros ($90.7
million), with projected annual generation of 66 gigawatt-hours
once the building contractor, Slovenian RIKO Group, finishes the
double-arch dam housing two Francis-type turbines, ELEM
spokesman Mirce Kotevski said.  “It’s a turn-key contract, and we are confident that the
plant will be online by the end of the year,” Kotevski said.  The investment that began in 2005 comprises ELEM’s own 23.2
million euros a 41 million-euro loan from Dublin-based Depfa
Bank, a unit of German commercial-property lender Hypo Real
Estate Holding AG.  St. Petka will become ELEM’s second hydro plant on the
Treska after the 80-megawatt Kozjak plant, and eighth in all.
The company also has two thermal plants, Bitola and Oslomej,
along with three coal mines.  ELEM’s total annual output of around 5,000 gigawatt-hours
accounts for 96 percent of all electricity generation in the
former Yugoslav republic.  To contact the reporter on this story:
