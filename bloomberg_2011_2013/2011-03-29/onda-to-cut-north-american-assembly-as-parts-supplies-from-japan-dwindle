Honda Motor Co., which makes more
than 80 percent of the automobiles it sells in the U.S. at North
American plants, plans to reduce output on the continent
starting tomorrow as parts supplies from  Japan  dwindle.  Employees were told today that the Tokyo-based company will
cut production temporarily by varying levels at factories in the
U.S.,  Canada  and  Mexico , said Ron Lietzke, a spokesman based in
Marysville, Ohio. Honda doesn’t know how long the reductions
will be needed, he said.  “It’s a fluid situation,” Lietzke said. The company
relies on Japan for “a small number of critical parts,”
including some needed for engines and electronics, he said,
without being more specific.  The magnitude-9 quake and tsunami that struck Japan on
March 11, leaving  more than 27,000 people dead or missing , has
temporarily hobbled auto and parts production there, with Honda,
 Toyota Motor Corp. (7203)  and Nissan Motor Co. idling most factory
lines. Honda previously suspended orders from U.S. dealers for
Japanese-built Honda and Acura models because of the temporary
shutdown of two auto-assembly plants there.  The company declined to say how much North American
production would be lost as a result of the cuts. As shifts are
canceled or reduced, workers may do non-production assignments
with pay, use vacation time or take time off without pay and
without a penalty to their monthly attendance bonuses, Lietzke
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
