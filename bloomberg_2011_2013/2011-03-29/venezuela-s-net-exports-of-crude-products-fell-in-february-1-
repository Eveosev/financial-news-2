Venezuela ’s net exports of crude
and refined oil products fell 0.9 percent in February from a
year earlier to 2.12 million barrels a day, according to the
country’s Oil & Energy Ministry.  Exports were about 17 percent lower than January’s
shipments, according to records e-mailed today from the
ministry.  The ministry didn’t publish production information and said
it would stop releasing certified export data. The country hired
contractor Inspectorate Venezuela SCS in 2009 to audit net
exports because of conflicting production reports.  “From this month on, we shall no longer be commissioning
or publishing export/import data or domestic market
certificates,” the ministry said, without specifying a reason.  Petroleos de Venezuela SA, the Caracas-based state oil
company, is currently producing about 3 million barrels of oil a
day, Oil Minister  Rafael Ramirez  said on March 27. OPEC
 estimated  the country’s total production in February at 2.39
million barrels a day.  Telephone calls and e-mails to the ministry and
Inspectorate Venezuela SCS were not immediately returned.  To contact the reporter on this story:
