The Philippine peso fell to a one-
week low as investors sold Asian stocks after Goldman Sachs
Group Inc. cut its economic growth forecast for  Japan .  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index of regional shares dropped by
the most in two weeks after Goldman Sachs lowered its estimate
for Japanese growth for the year starting April 1 to 0.7 percent
from 1.3 percent and said the nation’s economy will shrink next
quarter. Japan, which was struck by its strongest earthquake on
record and an ensuing tsunami on March 11, is the Philippines
biggest export market.  “Worries about oil and uncertainty in the Middle East and
Japan are negatively impacting equities,” said Rafael Algarra,
treasurer at Security Bank Corp. in Manila.  The peso declined 0.3 percent to 43.580 per dollar as of
10:53 a.m. in Manila, the weakest level since March 18,
according to Tullett Prebon Plc. The currency has rallied 0.5
percent this quarter.  Foreign funds sold $20 million more Philippine shares than
they bought in the three trading days through yesterday,
according to exchange data.  The government may pursue additional foreign borrowings
this year, Finance Secretary Cesar Purisima said today. The
decision will depend on market offers and cost, he said.  The yield on the 6.25 percent bond due January 2014 was
unchanged at 5.05 percent, according to Tradition Financial
Services.  To contact the reporter for this story:
