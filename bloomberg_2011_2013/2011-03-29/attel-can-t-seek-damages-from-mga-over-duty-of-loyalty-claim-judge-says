Mattel Inc. (MAT) , the maker of Barbie
dolls, can’t seek damages from rival toymaker MGA Entertainment
Inc. for claims MGA aided and abetted Mattel employees to breach
their duty of loyalty, a federal judge ruled.  U.S. District Judge David Carter in Santa Ana, California,
granted MGA’s request for a ruling that Mattel’s claim in the
dispute over the origins of MGA’s Bratz doll line fails as a
matter of law.  “In California, there is no tort for ‘breach of duty of
loyalty’ that is distinct from the recognized tort of ‘breach of
fiduciary duty,’” the judge said in a ruling today.  A group of former Mattel seamstresses and sample makers as
well as an intern, who Mattel says were induced to do work for
 Van Nuys , California-based MGA while still employed by Mattel,
weren’t fiduciaries, the judge said. The breach of duty of
loyalty claims involving Bratz designer  Carter Bryant  are
superseded by Mattel’s trade-secret theft claims, the judge
said.  Mattel and closely held MGA have been in trial since
January 18 on Mattel’s allegations that MGA stole the idea for
the pouty, multiethnic Bratz doll in 2000. The case returned to
court after a $100 million verdict in favor of Mattel was
overturned on appeal.  Lisa Marie Bongiovanni, a spokeswoman for El Segundo,
California-based Mattel, had no immediate comment on the ruling.  The case is Bryant v. Mattel, 04-09049, U.S. District
Court, Central District of  California  (Santa Ana).  To contact the reporter on this story:
