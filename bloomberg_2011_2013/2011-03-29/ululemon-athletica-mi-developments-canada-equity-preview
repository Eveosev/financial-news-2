Canadian stocks rose, led by banks
and precious-metals shares, as investors took advantage of lower
prices after the Standard & Poor’s/TSX Composite Index fell near
its average level over the past 50 days.  Toronto-Dominion Bank (TD) , the country’s second-largest bank,
gained 0.6 percent.  Goldcorp Inc. (G) , the world’s second-biggest
gold producer by market value, advanced 1 percent as the metal
fluctuated after three days of losses.  Cameco Corp. (CCO) , the world’s
second-largest uranium producer, decreased 2 percent as the
owner of  Japan ’s stricken Tokyo Electric Power Co. nuclear power
plant said it found plutonium in nearby soil samples.  The Standard & Poor’s/TSX Composite Index increased 44.5
points, or 0.3 percent, to 13,937.23 at 12:07 p.m. in Toronto.
The index had fallen as much as 0.4 percent to 13,843.38,
approaching the 50-day moving average of 13,811.74.  “There’s a lot of stranded capital that missed most of the
rally from the beginning of September that was looking to get in
on any pullback,” said  Bob Decker , who helps oversee C$5.5
billion ($5.6 billion) as a money manager at Aurion Capital
Management in Toronto. “There’s a good technical underpinning
given the demand for equities.”  The index had fallen 1.7 percent this month through
yesterday after eight-straight months of gains. Uranium
producers and insurers dropped after the March 11 earthquake and
tsunami in Japan, and energy producers declined from a 30-month
high reached at the outbreak of the war in  Libya .  Healthy Bounce  An index in a healthy stock market should bounce off moving
averages, according to technical analysts, who study charts of
trading patterns and prices to predict changes in a security,
commodity, currency or index.  The S&P/TSX Banks Index rose for the first time in four
days. TD gained 0.6 percent to C$84.52.  Bank of Montreal (BMO) ,
 Canada ’s fourth-largest lender by assets, advanced 0.6 percent
to C$62.45.  National Bank of Canada (NA) , the No. 6 bank in the
country, increased 1 percent to C$77.05.  Twenty-one of 34 S&P/TSX gold companies climbed. Goldcorp
rose 1 percent to C$47.81.  New Gold Inc. (NGD) , which mines in  Mexico ,
the U.S. and  Australia , surged 3.9 percent to a four-year high
of C$11.27. Silver reseller  Silver Wheaton Corp. (SLW)  gained 1.8
percent to C$42.41.  Extending Plunge  Cameco fell 2 percent to C$28.60, extending its March
plunge to 28 percent. Ian Parkinson, an analyst at Canadian
Imperial Bank of Commerce, reduced his share-price estimate on
Cameco to C$43 from C$46. In a note to clients, Parkinson cited
“headline risk over the coming weeks as events in Japan unfold
and revised plans are announced in developed countries.”  Diamond producer  Harry Winston Diamond Corp. (HW)  climbed 4.6
percent to C$14.80 after Edward Sterck, an analyst at BMO,
raised his rating on the shares to “outperform” from “market
perform.” In a note to clients, Sterck cited “a robust outlook
for rough diamonds and the luxury goods sectors.”  Ritchie Bros. Auctioneers Inc., which calls itself the
world’s largest industrial auctioneer, rallied 4.4 percent to a
16-month high of C$26.64 after Ben Cherniavsky, an analyst at
Raymond James Financial Inc., boosted his rating on the stock to
“outperform” from “market perform.”  To contact the reporter on this story;
