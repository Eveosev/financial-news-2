Global Dairy Holdings Ltd. (1007)  hired
Bank of America Corp. and Macquarie Group Ltd. to help it sell
so-called synthetic bonds that are denominated in yuan and
settled in U.S. dollars.  Global Dairy, based in Heilongjiang,  China , plans to use
money raised from the bonds to develop 25 dairy farms in Wuchang
and Zhaoyuan, and buy or build a feed processing plant and raw
milk processing facilities, it said in a statement to the Hong
Kong stock exchange today.  The company will meet with investors in Hong Kong,
 Singapore  and  London  ahead of the sale, according to a person
familiar with the matter, who asked not to be identified because
the details are private.  To contact the reporter on this story:
