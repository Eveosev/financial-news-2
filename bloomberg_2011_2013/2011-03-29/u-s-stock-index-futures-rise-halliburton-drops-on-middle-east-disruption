U.S. stocks advanced, sending the
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index to a three-week high, as  Home Depot
Inc. (HD)  drove consumer companies higher and energy shares rose amid
speculation production will increase in the Middle East.  Home Depot rose 2.9 percent, the most in the  Dow Jones
Industrial Average , as the largest U.S. home-improvement
retailer sold $2 billion in bonds to help finance buybacks.
Rowan Cos. and  Schlumberger Ltd. (SLB)  rallied more than 4.4 percent
as oil gained 0.8 percent.  AK Steel Holding Corp. (AKS)  gained 5.2

there’s clear economic momentum being driven by the jobs
market,” said  James Paulsen , chief investment strategist at
Minneapolis-based Wells Capital Management, which oversees about
$340 billion. “Any other week, these downgrades of Greece and
Portugal would knock the market down.”  Four Times  The  S&P 500  fell below 1,306.11 -- its 50-day average as of
yesterday’s close -- at least four times today, and rebounded
within three minutes each time, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The benchmark measure of U.S. shares closed at a 32-
month high of 1,343.01 on Feb. 18.  “There are a lot of technical factors also playing out,”
Paulsen said. “You’re bowling through the 50-day moving average
and zeroing in on a run at whether we’ll get to that 1,345
level” on the S&P 500, he said.  The S&P 500 fell as much as 0.4 percent earlier after S&P
reduced Portugal and Greece’s debt ratings, bolstering
speculation  Europe ’s debt crisis will hamper the global economy.
Portugal’s sovereign credit ratings were cut to the lowest
investment grade of BBB- and Greece was shifted to BB- at S&P,
which said more reductions are possible.  “The market is not surprised by the Portugal and Greece
cuts,” said Liam Dalton, president of Axiom Capital Management
Inc. in New York, which oversees $1.2 billion. “It’s really
more a factor of the market having a sharp move upward and
consolidating those gains rather than reacting in a harsh way to
the news of Portugal and Spain.”  Home Depot, Energy  Home Depot rose 2.9 percent to $37.70 after it sold $2
billion of 10- and 30-year bonds. The Atlanta-based company will

deposit outside  China , jumped 7.5 percent to $59.65.  JPMorgan

Deutsche Bank AG, which estimated a 9 percent drop.  “The market is resilient because investors are realizing
that stocks are the more compelling game in town after we’ve
moved into a more consistent growth phase in the economy,” said
