Scheduled natural gas deliveries to
U.S. households slipped for a second day on forecasts of higher
temperatures in the Great Lakes area that may reduce demand for
the heating fuel.  A sample of scheduled deliveries to homes in the U.S. and

to receive 14.9 million dekatherms of gas, down 4.6 percent from
yesterday, Bloomberg data show.  Scheduled shipments for U.S. power plants dropped 1.9
percent to 12.9 million dekatherms.  The low temperature in Columbus, Ohio, early today was 24
degrees Fahrenheit (minus 4 Celsius), 11 below normal, according
to  Weather Underground  in Ann Arbor, Michigan. The overnight low
may be 27 degrees, 8 below normal.  Wholesale gas delivered into Columbia Gas Transmission in
Ohio, Kentucky,  Pennsylvania ,  West Virginia , Virginia and New
York, which is the pricing point for Columbus, fell 8.37 cents,
or 4.7 percent, to $4.4096 per million British thermal units on
the  Intercontinental Exchange  at 12:30 p.m. today.  Gas at the Henry Hub in Erath, Louisiana, the delivery
point for futures traded on the  New York Mercantile Exchange ,
