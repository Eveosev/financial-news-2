European Central Bank council
member Jozef Makuch said it is “highly probable” that the bank
will raise interest rates next week.  “A change in rates is highly probable, but not certain,”
Makuch, who also heads the National Bank of Slovakia, said at a
press conference in Bratislava today. He declined to comment on
how much rates might be changed and whether it could be the
start of a series of moves.  ECB President  Jean-Claude Trichet  said earlier this month
that the bank may raise its benchmark interest rate from a
record low of 1 percent at its April 7 policy meeting. Since
then, officials have signaled the impact of the Japanese
earthquake will not deter them from lifting borrowing costs for
the first time in almost three years.  Makuch also said the situation in  Portugal  is “serious”
and has been complicated by the country’s political crisis.
Asked about a potential spillover to  Spain , he said: “There is
always a risk of contagion, but I see no reason for panic.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
