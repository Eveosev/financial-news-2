If  Serbia  joins NATO, the alliance
will want to install long-range missiles in its territory, which
Russia may see as a threat to its own security, Danas newspaper
reported, citing Russian Ambassador to Belgrade Alexander Konuzin.  Konuzin said Serbia, which declared military neutrality in
2007 while being in NATO’s Partnership for Peace program,
remains free to join any organization it chooses, “but we count
that Belgrade will respect our thinking that entering NATO would
represent a threat to Russia’s security,” the newspaper quoted
Konuzin as saying.  Russia would have to “take military measures to remove
such threats. The measures would not be against Serbia, but
against the missiles,” Konuzin reportedly said in the
interview, following last week’s visit to Belgrade by Premier
 Vladimir Putin .  To contact the reporter on this story:
