Indian stocks climbed for a sixth
straight day, extending the biggest weekly rally in 20 months,
as a decline in oil prices for a fourth day allayed concerns
energy costs will fan inflation.  Hero Honda Motors Ltd. (HH) , the nation’s biggest motorcycle
maker, jumped 2.9 percent as its founder got approval to raise
funds from overseas.  Bharti Airtel Ltd. (BHARTI) , the top mobile-phone
operator, jumped to near a six-month high. JPMorgan Chase & Co.
raised its rating on the stock to “overweight” from
“neutral” yesterday. Oil &  Natural Gas  Corp., the largest
state explorer, advanced 1.7 percent as it won 10 fields in the
nation’s ninth auction of energy assets.  “The decline in crude prices, which has been accompanied
by an appreciation in the  Indian rupee , bodes well for the
government’s import bill,” said Gurunath Mudlapur, director at
Atherstone Capital Markets Ltd., an investment bank in Mumbai.
“Fresh buying by foreign funds near the end of the quarter has
also spurred gains for stocks.” He recommends shares of large
capitalization auto and capital goods companies.  The Bombay Stock Exchange’s Sensitive Index, or Sensex,
gained 177.66, or 0.9 percent, to 19,120.80 at the 3:30 p.m.
close in Mumbai, the highest level since Jan. 24. The S&P CNX
Nifty Index on the National Stock Exchange rose 0.9 percent to
5,736.35. The BSE 200 Index added 0.8 percent to 2,341.59, its
best close since Jan. 25.  Overseas investors bought a net 15.2 billion rupees ($340
million) of Indian stocks on March 25, a fourth straight day of
purchases, reducing their outflow from equities this year to
55.3 billion rupees, according to the  website  of the  Securities
and Exchange Board of India .  ‘Nifty Breakout’  Indian shares, Asia’s second-worst performers this year,
may rally after indexes crossed their 200-day moving averages,
according to Angel Broking Ltd. The Nifty Index surpassed its
200-day moving average of 5,691 as of yesterday’s close, while
the Sensex topped the average of 18,959.  “The Nifty is likely to target 5,800 and 5,850 in the
breakout near-term,” Vasudeo Mileen Kamlakant, a technical
analyst at Angel Broking in Mumbai, said by telephone.  Hero Honda  paced gains among auto stocks, climbing 2.9
percent to 1,544.6 rupees, its highest close since Feb. 7. The
government approved Hero Investments Pvt.’s proposal to raise 45
billion rupees from overseas investors.  Maruti Suzuki India Ltd. (MSIL) , the largest carmaker, gained 3
percent to 1,237.95 rupees, while  Tata Motors Ltd. (TTMT) , the biggest
truck-maker, added 1.3 percent to 1,239.45 rupees.  Bharti Airtel rose for a sixth day, jumping 3.7 percent to
360.6 rupees, its highest close since Oct. 1. Smaller rival
 Reliance Communications Ltd. (RCOM)  rallied 4.2 percent to 109.7
rupees, a three-week high. Oil & Natural Gas advanced 1.7
percent to 283.85 rupees, its highest close since Feb. 7.  Crude Falls  The Sensex jumped 5.2 percent last week, the most since the
five days ended July 17, 2009. Still, the gauge is set for its
first quarterly decline in nine as concerns that rising interest
rates will crimp economic growth and corporate profits dragged
stocks lower. Companies on the benchmark trade at an average 18
times estimated earnings, compared with 21.5 times in March
2010, after the measure dropped 7 percent this year, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Crude oil extended losses in  New York  after Libyan rebels
advanced against Muammar Qaddafi’s troops, raising speculation
the conflict may be resolved soon. May-delivery futures dropped
as much as 0.9 percent to $103.08 a barrel.  India’s currency strengthened against the  U.S. dollar . The
rupee rose 0.1 percent to 44.77 per dollar today. It touched
44.61 on March 25, the strongest level seen since Jan. 4. A
stronger currency makes imports of commodities denominated in
dollars cheaper.  Oil Challenge  India faces a challenge in managing the impact of rising
 oil prices  on its economic growth and inflation, the  Reserve
Bank  of India Governor Duvvuri Subbarao said in Colombo today.
The nation imports about 75 percent of its energy needs.  Subbarao raised borrowing costs eight times in the past
year, as he seeks to combat inflation that accelerated to 8.31
percent in February, cutting purchasing power in a nation where
the  World Bank  says more than 75 percent of people live on less
than $2 a day. The  Finance Ministry  forecasts the $1.3 trillion
economy may expand as much as 9.25 percent in the fiscal year
starting April 1.  India’s economic expansion and corporate earnings lured
foreign investors to purchase a record $29.4 billion of local
equities last year and made the Sensex the best performer and
most expensive among the world’s 10 biggest markets.  To contact the reporter on this story:
