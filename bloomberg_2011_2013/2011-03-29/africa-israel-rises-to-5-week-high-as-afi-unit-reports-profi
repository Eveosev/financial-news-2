Africa-Israel Investments Ltd. (AFIL) 
climbed to the highest level in more than five weeks after Lev
Leviev’s holding company’s  AFI Development Plc (AFID)  unit posted a
profit in 2010 as real-estate prices rebounded.  The shares increased 3.5 percent to 30.10 shekels at 10:15
a.m. in  Tel Aviv , the highest intraday level since Feb. 21.  AFI, the Russian property developer, posted net income of
$25.9 million for 2010 after reporting a $2.7 million loss the
previous year as an asset revaluation led to a gain of $93.9
million.  To contact the reporter on this story:
