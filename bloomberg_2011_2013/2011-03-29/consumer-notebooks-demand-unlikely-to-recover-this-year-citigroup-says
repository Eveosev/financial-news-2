Consumer notebooks are “unlikely”
to “stage a big comeback” in the second half of this year,
given continuing “strong demand” for smartphones and tablet
PCs, Citigroup Inc. said.  The brokerage cut its price estimates for the following
companies in the report by analysts led by Kevin Chang and dated
yesterday:  Acer Inc. (2353)  to NT$49 from NT$60;  Asustek Computer Inc. (2357) 
to NT$230 from NT$245;  Compal Electronics Inc. (2324)  to NT$34 from
NT$39;  Quanta Computer Inc. (2382)  to NT$48 from NT$53; and  Pegatron
Corp. (4938)  to NT$30 from NT$35. Citigroup maintained its “sell”
rating on the five companies.  Citigroup also lowered its rating on Chicony Electronics
Co. to ‘hold’ from ’buy’ and reduced its price estimate to NT$55
from NT$78.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
