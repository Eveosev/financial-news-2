India ’s 11-year bond yields were
near the lowest level this year on speculation banks will buy
the notes to comply with a central bank order on debt holdings
before the fiscal year ends this month.  Lenders have to invest 24 percent of their deposits in
finance ministry notes and approved securities and declare the
assets to the  Reserve Bank  of India. Deposits rose to a record
51.4 trillion rupees ($1.1 trillion) as of March 11, according
to central bank data issued on March 25.  “Bond prices are staying high due to sustained demand from
banks before the financial year close,” said R.S. Chauhan, head
dealer of fixed income and  currency trading  in Mumbai at  State
Bank  of Bikaner & Jaipur. “These levels may be sustained for a
couple of days more.”  The rate on the 8.08 percent note due August 2022 was
little changed at 8.03 percent as of 9:42 a.m. in Mumbai, near
the lowest since Dec. 16, according to the central bank’s
trading system.  The cost of one-year interest-rate swaps, or derivative
contracts used to guard against fluctuations in borrowing costs,
decreased. The rate, a fixed payment made to receive floating,
dropped four basis points to 7.41 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
