Valero Energy Corp. (VLO)  said a fire
occurred March 26 at its refinery in Port Arthur, Texas, after a
leak at a crude unit exchanger.  The fire “was quickly extinguished” without material
impact to production,  Bill Day , a company spokesman, said in an
e-mail. The restart of the crude unit, which is being returned
to production after a turnaround that began on Feb. 2, was
slowed while the leak was repaired, he said.  The crude unit and the coker, which also shut in February
for work, have restarted and are increasing toward planned
rates, Day said. The refinery, about 90 miles east of Houston,
has a capacity of 310,000 barrels a day, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
