Sun Life Financial Inc. (SLF) ,  Canada ’s
third-largest insurer, awarded Chief Executive Officer Donald Stewart C$8.27 million ($8.47 million) in total compensation for
2010, more the double the prior year.  Stewart received a salary of C$1.1 million, share and
option awards totaling C$5.5 million and an annual incentive
plan of C$1.68 million, the Toronto-based insurer said today in
a regulatory filing. Stewart received C$3.84 million in
compensation for 2009 and wasn’t given share awards or an annual
bonus. Sun Life also said Stewart, 64, qualifies as a
“retiree” because of his age and years of service.  To contact the reporter on this story:
