U.K. stocks pared losses as
investors awaited reports on U.S. consumer confidence and
residential real-estate prices.  Wolseley Plc, the world’s largest supplier of heating and
plumbing products, advanced 1.8 percent after reporting a jump
in fiscal first-half earnings. BP Plc slid 2.4 percent as
federal prosecutors in the U.S. considered whether to pursue
manslaughter charges against some of the company’s managers.  The benchmark FTSE 100 Index lost 2.34, or less than 0.1
percent, to 5,902.15 at 12:58 p.m. in  London . The benchmark
measure had earlier declined as much as 0.3 percent. The FTSE
All-Share Index slid 0.1 percent today, while Ireland’s ISEQ
Index fell 0.5 percent.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
