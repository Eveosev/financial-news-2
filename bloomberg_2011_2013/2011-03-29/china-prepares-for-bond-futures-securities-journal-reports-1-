China  has begun preparations for
trading of government bond futures after they were halted 16
years ago because of a trading scandal, the China Securities
Journal  reported  today, citing an unidentified person.  Preparation work has already started, the Beijing-based
newspaper reported, without giving more details. Hu Ji, a China
Securities Regulatory Commission spokesman, didn’t immediately
answer calls to his mobile phone today seeking comment.  China last year introduced credit-default swaps and stock
index futures in a bid to give domestic investors more hedging
tools, with China Securities Regulatory Commission Chairman
Shang Fulin calling this month for a “paced” expansion of the
nation’s futures trading as a market stability measure. Sales of
 government bonds  rose 9.8 percent to 1.78 trillion yuan ($271
billion) last year, according to clearing house Chinabond.  Trading in bond futures was halted in 1995 after a scandal
that prompted the merger of former Shanghai International
Securities Co. with Shenyin Securities Co. Guan Jingsheng, then
president of Shanghai International, was jailed for 17 years for
his role in the trading misdeeds.  --  Henry Sanderson . Editors:  John Liu , Stephanie Wong  To contact Bloomberg News staff on this story:
