China ’s overseas mining deals fell
to $4.5 billion last year because of increased rivalry from
 India  and  Brazil , Ernst & Young LLP said.  The drop from a record $10 billion of deals in 2009
reflects “tougher” competition for Chinese investment, Eleanor
Wu, an Ernst & Young partner on transaction advisory services,
told reporters today in Beijing, after releasing a report on
China’s mining acquisitions for 2010.  India surpassed China for the first time in 2010 with $4.6
billion overseas deals, mainly in coking coal, the report said.
China’s deals included Jinchuan Group Ltd.’s $878 million
takeover of South African platinum explorer Wesizwe Platinum
Ltd., and China Railway Construction Corp. group’s C$679 million
($696 million) purchase of  Canada ’s Corriente Resources Inc.  “We expect sustained and moderate growth this year in
Chinese outbound deals because of the imbalance of supply,
shortage of resources and the country’s economic growth,” Wu
said, without giving a forecast.  Global mining and energy deals are poised for the biggest
first quarter since 2008, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. Global mining deals rose 89 percent to $113.7 billion
in 2010, according to the Ernst & Young report.  Chinese investors shifted focus from Australia and Canada
to higher-risk destinations including Brazil, Ecuador and  Africa ,
targeting exploration companies, Paul Murphy, head of Asia
Pacific Mining & Metals at Ernst & Young, said today.  Mining deals in China, including outbound and inbound,
dropped 20 percent last year from a year earlier, the report
said. Domestic deals surged 89 percent to $8 billion, driven by
state-led restructuring in coal and steel sectors, it said.  --Xiao Yu. Editors: Indranil Ghosh, Abhay Singh  To contact the reporter on this story:
