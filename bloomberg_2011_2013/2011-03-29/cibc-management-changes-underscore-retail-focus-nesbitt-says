Canadian Imperial Bank of
Commerce’s management changes underscore a focus on  consumer
lending  to boost revenue, said Richard Nesbitt, the head of
 investment banking .  The change “really allows us to focus on the retail
business as our core driver of growth,” Nesbitt, group head of
wholesale, international and technology operations, said today
during a National Bank Financial conference in  Montreal .  Nesbitt, 55, was promoted yesterday to a position that
includes responsibility over treasury and international
operations. He is the leading candidate to replace Chief
Executive Officer Gerald McCaughey when he retires, according to
a report today by the Globe and Mail, citing people it didn’t
identify.  CIBC said in September it set an annual profit goal of
C$3 billion ($3.1 billion) for consumer lending within three
years, up from C$2.2 billion in 2010.  Canadian banking head Sonia Baxendale quit when she learned
she wouldn’t become CEO, the Globe and Mail said. Chief
Financial Officer David Williamson will take over most of
Baxendale’s responsibilities as group head of retail and
business banking, Toronto-based CIBC said yesterday. Kevin
Glass, who joined the company in 2009, was named CFO.  To contact the reporter on this story:
