A unit of  ThyssenKrupp AG (TKA)  lost its
bid at the European Union’s highest court to overturn a 3.17
million-euro ($4.5 million) antitrust fine levied for fixing
stainless steel prices.  The European Commission, the 27-nation region’s antitrust
regulator, was entitled to fine the unit for violations before
the old rules expired in 2002, the EU  Court of Justice  in
Luxembourg ruled today.  ThyssenKrupp Nirosta GmbH, formerly known as ThyssenKrupp
Stainless AG, challenged the December  2006  fine after
an earlier penalty had been partly overturned by an EU court.  “It would be contrary to the objectives and the
coherence” of EU law if the Brussels-based commission didn’t
have the power to ensure the rules from the old law, “which
continue to produce effects,” are applied, even though that law
has expired, the court said.  Yves Bot, an advocate general at the EU court, said in a
non-binding opinion last October that the court should overturn
the fine because regulators took too long to make a decision to
fine the unit.  “The  European Court  of Justice did not follow this
opinion” and “the company will of course respect this final
judgment,” Essen, Germany-based ThyssenKrupp said in an e-
mailed statement.  ThyssenKrupp Stainless, which took over Thyssen Stahl AG’s
flat stainless-steel business in 1995, was among eight companies
accused by the EU antitrust agency in 1998 of almost doubling
the price of stainless steel from January 1994 to March 1995.  The case is: C-352/09 P, ThyssenKrupp Nirosta (anciennement
ThyssenKrupp Stainless) v. Commission.  To contact the reporter on this story:
