Continental AG,  Europe ’s second-
largest car-parts maker, agreed to arrange 6 billion euros ($8.4
billion) of loans with more than 35 banks in a deal that cut its
borrowing costs.  The package includes term loans due in 2012 and 2014 and a
three-year revolving credit facility, the Hanover, Germany-based
company said in a statement today. Proceeds will refinance
credit lines coming due next year.  A surge in global car sales to Chinese and U.S. customers
helped lift Continental’s earnings in 2010. The company, which
is also Europe’s second-biggest tiremaker, beat analyst
estimates for sales and profit and forecast that more business
in  Asia  will outweigh costs from higher rubber prices this year.  “On the basis of our good results for 2010 and our
positive outlook, we were able to achieve the better conditions
that we intended,” Continental’s Chief Financial Officer
Wolfgang Schaefer said in the statement. The deal was
“significantly oversubscribed,” Continental said.  Continental agreed to pay initial interest of 300 basis
points more than the euro interbank offered rate on the 2.88
billion-euro three-year term loan, a margin of 250 basis points
to draw funds under the 2.5 billion-euro three-year revolving
credit facility, and 275 basis points for the term loam maturing
next year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. A basis
point is 0.01 percentage point.  Extending Debt Repayment  Continental has been extending its debt repayment schedule
and reduced net liabilities to 7.3 billion euros at the end of
2010 from 8.9 billion euros a year earlier. It sold 1.1 billion
in new shares last year, followed by a total of 3 billion euros
in bonds.  Schaeffler Group , the company’s majority shareholder,
yesterday sold 1.8 billion euros of Continental shares held for
Schaeffler by two German banks, to cut its own debt. The deal
reduced the holding it controls to 60.3 percent from 75.1
percent, positioning Continental for a return to  Germany ’s
benchmark  DAX index (DAX)  because of a higher free float.  Continental aims to lower the ratio of net debt to equity
to about 70 percent from the Dec. 31 figure of 118 percent, and
return to an investment grade rating by 2012.  Standard & Poor’s rates Continental’s debt B, or five steps
below investment grade. Moody’s Investors Service ranks it one
step higher at B1. Both have a stable outlook on the ratings.  One part of the credit coming due is a 4.06 billion-euro
term loan. The other is a forward-start credit line of 2.5
billion euros signed in December 2009. Continental agreed to pay
interest of between 475 basis points and 500 basis points more
than benchmark lending rates for the loans, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  The debt stems from Continental’s 2007 acquisition of
Siemens AG’s VDO unit for 11.4 billion euros.  The company was offered about 8.5 billion euros by banks,
two people familiar with the talks said March 26.  To contact the reporter on this story:
