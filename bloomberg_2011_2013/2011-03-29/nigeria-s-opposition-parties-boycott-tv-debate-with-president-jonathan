Nigeria ’s leading opposition
candidates in next month’s presidential election pulled out of a
televised debate with President Goodluck Jonathan scheduled to
take place today in Abuja, the capital.  Muhammadu Buhari of the Congress for Progressive Change,
Nuhu Ribadu of the Action Congress of Nigeria and Ibrahim
Shekarau of the All Nigeria Peoples Party, will not participate
in the debate to protest Jonathan’s failure to join a debate
last week organized by NN24 TV, a local network, according to a
joint statement.  “Our principals will not honor any debate session with
President Goodluck Jonathan in the 2011 elections as he has
arrogantly shunned the credible debate for which we made
ourselves available,” the candidates said.  Nigeria,  Africa ’s most populous nation, is set to hold
presidential elections on April 9. Jonathan, a southern
Christian who is the candidate of the ruling People’s  Democratic
Party , faces challengers including Buhari, a northern Muslim and
former military ruler, Ribadu, the former head of the country’s
anti-graft agency, and Shekarau, a Muslim and current governor
of northern Kano State.  The ruling party has governed Nigeria, the continent’s top
oil producer, since the West African nation returned to civilian
rule in 1999.  To contact the reporter on this story:
