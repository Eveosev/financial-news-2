Japan ’s bonds fell, extending a
loss this quarter, on speculation the yen’s decline against the
dollar and euro will brighten the earnings outlook for exporters
and damp demand for the relative safety of debt.  Bond futures slid as stocks rose and a report showed
industrial production unexpectedly rose in February. Local bonds
also followed a decline in Treasuries before data today forecast
to show U.S. companies increased jobs in March, adding to signs
the global economic recovery is gathering momentum.  “Economic fundamentals have been solid overseas, and
central banks abroad are starting to see an exit in their
monetary policies,” said  Tatsushi Shikano , a senior economist
in  Tokyo  at Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley Securities Co., a unit
of Japan’s largest bank. “Yields should go up, as the global
economy remains resilient.”  The yield on the 1.3 percent bond maturing in March 2021
rose one basis point to 1.24 percent as of 3:12 p.m. in Tokyo at
Japan Bond Trading Co., the nation’s largest interdealer debt
broker. The price fell 0.090 yen to 100.531 yen. A basis point
is 0.01 percentage point.  Ten-year bond futures for June delivery dropped 0.21 to
139.57 as of the afternoon close at the Tokyo Stock Exchange.
The  Nikkei 225 (NKY)  Stock Average advanced 2.6 percent.  Ten-year yields have dropped 1.5 basis points this month
and gained 13 basis points in the quarter that ends tomorrow.  The yen touched 83.01 per dollar today, the lowest since
March 11, and reached 116.96 per euro, the weakest since May 14.  Factory Output  Japan’s factory output increased 0.4 percent in February
from January, climbing for a fourth month, the Trade Ministry
said in Tokyo today. The median estimate of economists surveyed
by Bloomberg News was for a 0.1 percent drop.  Treasury 10-year yields advanced six basis points to 3.49
percent yesterday. Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis President
 James Bullard  said the U.S. central bank may need to trim about
$100 billion from its plan to buy $600 billion in  Treasury
securities  because the U.S. recovery has gained strength.  U.S. firms added 208,000 workers in March after an increase
of 217,000 the previous month, according to the median estimate
of economists in a Bloomberg News survey before ADP Employer
Services reports the data today.  Nuclear Plant  Losses in Japan’s bonds may be limited on concern
conditions will worsen at a nuclear plant crippled by an
earthquake and tsunami on March 11.  Japanese Prime Minister  Naoto Kan  said yesterday that the
Fukushima Dai-Ichi nuclear plant’s tsunami defenses were
inadequate, while reassuring the public that radiation leaks
pose no health threat beyond a 20-kilometer (12.4 mile)
evacuation zone.  “As external conditions deteriorate, bonds should
weaken,”  Kazuhiko Sano , chief strategist at Tokai Tokyo
Securities Co., wrote in a research note today. “Movement in
the market continues to be limited as investors want to see
through the impact of the earthquake.”  Yields on Japan’s 40-year government bonds have risen to
the highest relative to two-year notes since March 2010,
signaling that investors are more concerned about the rising
cost to rebuild after this month’s earthquake.  Yields on the longer-maturity bonds are 2.37 percent, or
2.17 percentage points more than those available on two-year
notes, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. That’s the
widest since March 2010.  To contact the reporter on this story:
