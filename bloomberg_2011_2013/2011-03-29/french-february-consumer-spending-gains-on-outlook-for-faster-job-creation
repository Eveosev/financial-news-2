French  consumer spending  on
manufactured goods rose in February, lifted by prospects for
accelerating growth and job creation.  Spending advanced 0.9 percent from January, when it fell a
revised 0.3 percent, national statistics office Insee said in a
statement today in Paris. Economists predicted a 0.5 percent
gain, the median of 11 forecasts gathered by Bloomberg News
showed. Spending advanced 5.5 percent from a year earlier.  Jobless claims fell for a second month in February and
sentiment among manufacturers rose to a three-year high in March
as a revival in export orders spurred hiring. The Bank of France
predicts that  Europe â€™s second-largest economy will expand 0.8
percent in the first quarter, double the pace of the previous
three months.  To contact the reporter on this story:
