CPP Group Plc (CPP) , which provides
protection against credit-card and identity theft, fell the most
since its shares began trading in March 2010 after saying it
will immediately stop selling identity protection in the U.K. in
its own voice channels following talks with the Financial
Services Authority.  The shares slumped 46 percent in London trading. The FSA
investigation “relates to such of the group’s products as are
sold into the U.K. and specifically to alleged failings in sales
calls with customers,” the company said in a regulatory
statement released after market closed yesterday.  More than 70 percent of the company’s revenue comes from
the U.K., Michael Donnelly, an analyst at Cannacord Genuity,
said today in a telephone interview. The market reaction to the
announcement is “probably an accurate reflection of the
potential risks to the U.K. business,” Donnelly said. He cut
his recommendation on the stock to ‘sell’ from ‘hold.’  “This is going to take quite a long time to resolve,”
Donnelly said. “The market hates uncertainty. It is almost
impossible to figure out what the business will look like in 12
months time.”  CPP said it plans to develop and design a non-insurance
identity protection product. “Revenues will be deferred over
the one-year term of the product,” the company said.  CPP fell 130 pence to close at 150 pence at 4:30 p.m. in
 London , giving the company a market value of 256 million pounds
($409.1 million).  To contact the reporter on this story:
