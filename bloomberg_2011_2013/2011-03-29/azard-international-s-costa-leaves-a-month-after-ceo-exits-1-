Ken Costa, chairman of  Lazard
Ltd. (LAZ) ’s international unit, will step down a month after the
division’s chief executive officer quit.  Costa, 61, will leave the largest independent merger
adviser at the end of March, a spokesman for the firm in London
said by telephone today. His departure follows that of Naguib Kheraj in February after less than two months in the job.  Lazard, based in Hamilton,  Bermuda , advised on about $200
billion in mergers and acquisitions globally last year, ranking
10th, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The firm plans to
hire more investment bankers and may add entire units from
rivals, Chief Financial Officer Michael Castellano said last
month, after cutting the number of managing directors last year.  Costa was involved in advising the Al-Fayed family trust on
its sale of  London  department store Harrods Ltd. to Qatar
Holding LLC for $2.2 billion last year. A 31-year veteran of UBS
AG and its predecessors, Costa joined Lazard in 2007 to oversee
the adviser’s U.K. investment banking business. He didn’t return
calls and an e-mail seeking comment when contacted today.  Financial News reported Costa’s departure earlier today.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
