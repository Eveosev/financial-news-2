Barclays Plc (BARC)  hired  Morgan Stanley (MS) ’s
Josh Connor, an investment banker to airlines and railroads, to
oversee services for transportation companies worldwide.  Connor will work in New York and start in July, London-
based Barclays said in a statement today. He worked at Morgan
Stanley for 15 years and was most recently co-head of the
transportation and infrastructure group, Barclays said.  Connor advised Continental Airlines Inc. on its merger with
UAL Corp. last year and  Canadian Pacific Railway Ltd. (CP)  on its
$1.5 billion takeover of Dakota Minnesota & Eastern Railroad
Corp. in 2007. He also worked on initial public offerings of
 JetBlue Airways Corp. (JBLU)  and  Ryanair Holdings Plc (RYA) , Barclays said.  Connor will report to John Miller, head of industrials
investment banking, Barclays said.  Barclays, the world’s fourth-biggest merger adviser last
year, has been hiring to bolster its market share with
industrial companies. Last year the London-based bank added
Larry Hamdan from  Credit Suisse Group AG (CSGN)  as head of industrials
mergers and acquisitions, and Reid Marsh from  Citigroup Inc. (C)  as
chairman of industrials.  To contact the reporter on this story:
