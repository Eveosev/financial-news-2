Diamond Bank Plc (DIAMONDB) , a Nigerian
lender, declined to the lowest in more than five months after
reporting that full-year profit missed analysts’ expectations.  The stock retreated 4 kobo, or 5 percent, to 6.7 naira by
the 2:30 p.m. close in Lagos, the lowest since Oct. 4. That
extended its drop this year to 11 percent, compared with a 0.1
percent decline in the Nigerian Stock Exchange All-Share Index.  The bank said net income for the year through December was
1.3 billion naira ($8.3 million) in 2010 compared with a loss of
16.8 billion naira in the previous year, according to an e-
mailed statement. The median estimate of six analysts was for
profit of 8.33 billion naira, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. Revenue fell 16 percent to 91 billion naira.  The “shares are likely to experience selling pressure and
consensus estimates are likely to be revised lower,” CSL
Stockbrokers Ltd. analysts Gbenga Sholotan, Tunde Abidoye and
Guy Czartoryski said in an e-mailed note to clients today.  Nigerian lenders reported losses or reduced income after a
debt crisis in 2008 and 2009 threatened the industry with
collapse.  Central Bank  of Nigeria fired the chief executives of
eight of the country’s 24 lenders, and bailed out the industry
with 620 billion naira. Diamond was not one of the recipients of
the bailout.  Diamond reduced its non-performing loan ratio to 14.8
percent in 2010, from 18.3 percent a year earlier.  To contact the reporter on this story:
