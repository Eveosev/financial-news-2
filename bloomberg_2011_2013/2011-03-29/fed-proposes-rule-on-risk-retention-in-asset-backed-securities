The  Federal Reserve   proposed  a rule
that would require sponsors of asset-backed securities to retain
at least 5 percent of the credit risk of the assets underlying
the securities.  The rule will be proposed with other federal agencies,
including the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Federal
Deposit Insurance Corp., the Fed said today in a statement in
Washington.  Regulators “sought to ensure that the amount of credit
risk retained is meaningful, while taking into account market
practices and reducing the potential for the rule to negatively
affect the availability and cost of credit to consumers and
businesses.”  The proposed rule provides exemptions, including for asset-
backed securities guaranteed by the U.S. government, and for
mortgage-backed securities that are composed exclusively of
“qualified residential mortgages,” a term that will be defined
in the proposal, the central bank said.  Comments on the proposed rules must be received by June 10.  To contact the reporter on this story:
