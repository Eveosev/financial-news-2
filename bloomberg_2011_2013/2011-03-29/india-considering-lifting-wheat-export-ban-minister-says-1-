India , the world’s second-largest
wheat grower, may end a ban on exports of the grain as
production is expected to exceed forecasts, a minister said.  “We are expecting a bumper wheat output,” junior farm
minister Arun Yadav said to reporters in  New Delhi  today.
Production will be more than the government’s last estimate of
81.47 million metric tons, he said.  India banned wheat exports in early 2007 to bolster
domestic supplies. Record harvests in the years since then and
purchases from farmers boosted stockpiles of rice, wheat and
other grains to 46 million tons in state warehouses as of March
1, according to data from the Food Corp. of India.  “We are thinking of allowing exports,” Yadav said. A
decision will be taken at the end of April or the first week of
May, he said. “By then a clear picture about output will
emerge.”  ---With assistance from Madelene Pearson in Mumbai. Editor:
