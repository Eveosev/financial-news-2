Mauritius’s government will cut  oil
prices  as of midnight to help the central bank reduce the
inflation rate, which has risen to the highest in 28 months.  Gasoline prices will fall 3.9 percent to 49.3 rupees
($1.45) a liter, while diesel drops 5.3 percent to 41.2 rupees,
Finance Minister Pravind Jugnauth said today in an e-mailed
response to a parliamentary question.  “It’s important to have a synergy to ensure growth and
create jobs,” Jugnauth told reporters today in the capital,
Port Louis. “Economic stability should prevail.”  The announcement comes one day after the central bank
increased its benchmark interest rate by half a percentage point
to 5.25 percent to tackle inflation that accelerated to 6.8
percent in February on rising fuel and food costs. Inflation
will reach 7.8 percent by June if monetary and economic policies
remain unchanged, the Monetary Policy Committee said in a
statement on the central bank’s website.  “The only way to combat inflation is the concerted action
of the Treasury and the central bank,” Governor Rundheersing
Bheenick told reporters in  Port Louis  today. “We need to get
ahead of the inflation curve.”  The MPC may meet before its next scheduled meeting of June
13, if the need arises, he said.  The “relatively low magnitude” of the increase in repo
rate leaves room for further rises over the next three months,
CIM Stockbrokers said in an e-mailed note to clients today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
