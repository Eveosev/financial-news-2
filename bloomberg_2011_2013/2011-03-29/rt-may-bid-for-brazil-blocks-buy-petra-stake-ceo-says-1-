HRT Participacoes em Petroleo SA (HRTP3) ,
the oil company that raised $1.5 billion in an initial public
offering last year, may bid for exploration blocks in Brazil and
buy out its partner in the Amazon to expand in the country.  Partner Petra Energia is waiting for drilling results in
June to decide whether it will sell its 45 percent stake in 21
exploration blocks in the Solimoes basin, HRT Chief Executive
Officer Marcio Rocha Mello told reporters today at the Bloomberg
Brazil Economic Summit in  Sao Paulo . HRT owns the rest of the
blocks and runs operations.  HRT will invest $2.5 billion in Brazil over the next three
years to search for light oil and natural gas in the Amazon
region, near the countryâ€™s second-largest gas field, he said.
The company also has exploration assets in  Namibia , where it
will start exploratory drilling next year, he said.  HRT, which has no proven reserves or production, is
expanding investments as Brazil aims to double oil output over
the next 10 years to become the largest producer in Latin
America. Brazil plans to auction exploration areas onshore and
off its northern coast this year to boost production.  To contact the reporters on this story:
