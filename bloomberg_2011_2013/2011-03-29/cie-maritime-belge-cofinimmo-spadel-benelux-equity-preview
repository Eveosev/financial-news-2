The Netherlands’  AEX-Index (AEX)  rose
1.96, or 0.5 percent, to 367.87 at the close 5:30 p.m. close in
Amsterdam, the highest level since March 4.  Belgium ’s Bel20
Index added 0.6 percent to 2,684.35.  The following were among the most active stocks in Benelux
markets today. Symbols are in parentheses.  Dutch Stocks:  Akzo Nobel (AKZA NA) gained 1.3 percent to 48.40 euros
after peer PPG Industries Inc. forecast that first-quarter
earnings will exceed analysts’ estimates. Profit will climb to
$1.30 to $1.35, from 69 cents a year earlier, the Pittsburgh-
based company said in a statement today. That would beat the
average estimate of 11 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg for profit
of $1.12.  Fornix BioSciences NV (FORBI)   advanced 2.4 percent to
2.51 euros, erasing yesterday’s drop. Shareholders in the former
maker of allergy treatments approved the sale of its Laprolan
unit.  ING Groep NV (INGA)   plunged 2.5 percent to 9.14 euros,
its second day of declines. The biggest Dutch financial-services
company said its capital strength may weaken once the Basel III
rules come into force. If ING had applied the  Basel Committee on
Banking Supervision ’s standards at the end of last year, the
firm’s core Tier 1 ratio would have fallen by 130 basis points.
At the end of its third quarter, ING said introducing the rules
would have cut its capital strength by 70 basis points. A basis
point is one hundredth of a percent.  SBM Offshore NV (SBMO)   jumped 1.8 percent to 20.22
euros, its lowest price since July 2008. The world’s largest
supplier of floating oil and gas rigs signed a letter of intent
with OSX Brasil SA to build a platform.  Spyker Cars NV (SPYKR)  , the owner of Saab Automobile,
sank 2.6 percent to 4.15 euros, paring an earlier decline of as
much as 21 percent. Spyker and Saab applied for permission to
bring in Russian businessman Vladimir Antonov as a shareholder
and financier for the Swedish carmaker, Spyker Chief Executive
Officer Victor Muller said. Spyker and Saab need approval from
 Sweden ’s National Debt Office and the  European Investment Bank .  Belgian stocks:  Cie. Maritime Belge SA (CMB BB) climbed 1.1 percent to
21.03 euros, paring three days of declines. The owner of dry-
bulk shipping line Bocimar International NV reported that 2010
net income rose 1 percent to 120.9 million euros ($170.5
million) and increased its final gross dividend to 1.08 euros
per share.  Nyrstar (NYR)  , the world’s biggest zinc producer, gained
1.1 percent to 10.03 euros.  ArcelorMittal (MT)  , the biggest
steelmaker, advanced 0.9 percent to 25.94 euros.  Recticel SA (REC)   surged 4 percent to 7.75 euros,
extending yesterday’s increase. The Belgian maker of foam, car-
interior trim and Lattoflex mattresses was rated “buy” in new
coverage at ING Groep NV.  To contact the reporter on this story:
