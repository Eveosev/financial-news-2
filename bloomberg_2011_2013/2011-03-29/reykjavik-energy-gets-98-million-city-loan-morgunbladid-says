Reykjavik’s city council has agreed
to lend Reykjavik Energy, Iceland’s second-largest energy
utility, 11.3 billion kronur ($98 million),  Morgunbladid 
reported, without saying how it got the information.  The loan was granted on the condition that  Reykjavik Energy 
prepares to sell all assets not related to the company’s core
operations, the newspaper said today. The city will pay out 7.4
billion kronur on April 1 and a further 3.7 billion kronur in
the first quarter of 2013, Morgunbladid said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
