SABMiller Plc (SAB)  has applied to have
an antitrust case brought against it by a liquor retailer in
 South Africa  dropped because it says the complaint has changed
from the one initially filed, Business Day said, citing Harald
Harvey, SABMiller’s strategy director.  The case was filed by Port Elizabeth-based liquor
wholesaler Big Daddy’s in 2004, the Johannesburg-based newspaper
said. Big Daddy’s said some customers were getting preferential
treatment.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
