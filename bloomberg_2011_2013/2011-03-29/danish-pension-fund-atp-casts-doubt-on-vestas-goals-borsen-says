Denmark’s state-backed pension fund
ATP said investors are skeptical Vestas Wind Systems A/S can
achieve its goal of sales of 15 billion euros and a margin of 15
percent by 2015, Borsen reported, citing Claus Wiinblad, the
fund’s head of equities.   The skepticism arises from the company’s investment
program, the Copenhagen-based newspaper said, citing Wiinblad
who spoke at Vestas’ general meeting yesterday. Vestas invested
17 billion kroner over the last five years, yet free  cash flow 
rose just 2 billion kroner, so capital increases funded the
investment, Borsen quoted Wiinblad as saying.  Click here for web link  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
