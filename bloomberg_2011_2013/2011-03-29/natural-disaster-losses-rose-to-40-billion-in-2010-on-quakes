The cost to insurers of natural
disasters rose 76 percent to $40 billion last year because of
higher losses from earthquakes including those that struck  Chile 
and  New Zealand , Swiss Reinsurance Co. said.  Earthquakes accounted for about a third of catastrophe
losses and will also be “above average” this year, the Zurich-
based reinsurer said in an e-mailed statement. Swiss Re
estimates total insured claims from the February 2011 temblor in
Christchurch, New Zealand, to be between $6 billion and $12
billion, while the March 11 quake that struck Sendai,  Japan , is
expected to trigger “significant” insured losses.  Insured losses from the 8.8-magnitude quake that struck
Chile in February 2010 are estimated at  $8 billion , making it
the costliest disaster last year, according to the world’s
second-biggest reinsurer. September’s earthquake in New Zealand
cost $4.45 billion, while storm Xynthia, which also hit in
February, may cost insurers $2.75 billion, Swiss Re said.  “2010 was not only characterized by severe earthquakes
that ranked among the deadliest, costliest and most powerful in
history, but also by a series of extreme weather events, such as
major floods,” said Thomas Hess, chief economist of Swiss Re.  Man-made disasters triggered additional losses of about $3
billion, including $1 billion of property claims from the
Deepwater Horizon explosion in the  Gulf of Mexico , Swiss Re
said. Insured losses from natural catastrophes in 2010 were just
below the $44 billion reported in 2008, when claims were boosted
by hurricanes Ike and Gustav.  Insured losses from the deadliest event last year, the
earthquake that killed 222,570 people in  Haiti , were minimal,
Swiss Re said. The total economic cost of natural disasters more
than tripled to $218 billion, while the 304,000 people who lost
their lives was the highest number since 1976, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
