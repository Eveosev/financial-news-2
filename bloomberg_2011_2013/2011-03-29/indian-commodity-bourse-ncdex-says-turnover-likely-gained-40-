India ’s  National Commodity &
Derivatives Exchange Ltd. , the country’s biggest bourse for
trading agricultural futures, said turnover likely climbed about
40 percent in the fiscal year ending this month.  Turnover probably advanced to about 46 billion rupees
($1.02 billion) in the 12 months ending March 31, R. Ramaseshan,
chief executive officer of the exchange, said today in Mumbai,
without giving a figure for the previous year.  “This would probably be one of the highest turnovers in
the exchange’s history,” he said. He declined to give a
forecast for the next fiscal year.  ---Editors: Matthew Oakley, Jarrett Banks  To contact the reporter on this story:
