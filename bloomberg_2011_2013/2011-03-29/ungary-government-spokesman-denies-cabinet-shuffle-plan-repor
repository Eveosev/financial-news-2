Hungarian Prime Minister  Viktor Orban  doesn’t plan to shuffle his Cabinet, his spokesman  Peter Szijjarto  said on public television  MTV  today, denying a
newspaper report.  "There is no reason to make any changes," Szijjarto said,
according to a video clip of the interview on MTV’s  website .  Mihaly Varga, Orban’s chief of staff, may be named finance
minister after the country’s turn holding the rotating European
Union presidency runs out at the end of June,  Nepszava  reported
today without citing anyone.  Orban may break up the Economy Ministry, which includes the
previously separate finance portfolio, and name Varga to head
the latter, the Budapest-based newspaper said today. Foreign
Minister Janos Martonyi and Development Minister Tamas Fellegi
and Miklos Rethelyi, who is in charge of health, culture and
sports, will also leave office, according to Nepszava.  Fellegi may be replaced by Istvan Fodor, who headed
Ericsson AB’s local unit for 17 years, Nepszava said. Rethelyi’s
portfolio would also be broken up to create a separate Health
Ministry, the newspaper said.
