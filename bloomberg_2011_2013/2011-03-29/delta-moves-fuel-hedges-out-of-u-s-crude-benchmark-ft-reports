Delta Air Lines Inc. (DAL)  has moved
almost all its aviation fuel hedges away from the U.S.’s West
Texas Intermediate crude oil benchmark, which is no longer seen
as a reliable tool for managing energy costs, the Financial
Times reported, citing Edward Bastian, Delta’s president.  In the past, Delta and other carriers have bought contracts
for WTI crude; this year, however, the U.S. benchmark has lagged
behind the 27 percent rise in jet fuel, the newspaper said.  Bastian, speaking at a conference last week, said Delta has
converted almost all its WTI positions to  Brent crude  or heating
oil, according to the newspaper.  To contact the reporter on this story:
