Kimi Raikkonen, the 2007 Formula
One champion, is considering an offer to join a team in the
Nascar auto-racing series, his agent  David Robertson  said.  Robertson declined to identify the team the 31-year-old
Finn was talking to.  “Negotiations are ongoing but nothing is guaranteed,”
Robertson said by telephone. “Somebody had come to us with an
offer and we are considering it.”  Raikkonen is set to join a new team, ICE1 Racing, in the
Truck series before moving to the Nationwide and Sprint Cup
categories, Autosport.com reported, citing  Finland ’s Turun
Sanomat newspaper.  One of the team’s partners is Foster Gillett, the son of
 George Gillett , according to  Autosport.com . George Gillett is
the former owner of the Liverpool soccer team and the Montreal
Canadiens ice hockey team.  Raikkonen was the top-earning athlete after golfer  Tiger Woods  in 2008 with $45 million in income, according to Forbes
magazine.  He was dropped by Ferrari after the 2009 season and left
Formula One to compete in the World Rally Championship for
Citroen last year. Raikkonen remains committed to his contract
in the rally series, Robertson said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
