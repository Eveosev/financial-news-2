Singapore Telecommunications Ltd. (ST) ,
 Southeast Asia ’s biggest phone company, sold HK$620 million
($79.5 million) of seven-year, 3.32 percent notes, according to
a statement to the Singapore stock exchange.  The bonds were issued under the company’s S$10 billion
($7.9 billion) medium-term note program with help from Barclays
Plc, and proceeds will be used in its “ordinary course of
business,” the statement said.  The sale was SingTel’s first in the Hong Kong currency

percent, 10-year notes, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
SingTel has about S$9 billion of bonds and loans maturing before
the end of 2031, the data show.  To contact the reporters on this story:
