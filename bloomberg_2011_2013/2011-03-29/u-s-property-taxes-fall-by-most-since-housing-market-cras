U.S. state and local property-tax
collections dropped in the last three months of 2010 by the most
since  home prices  peaked more than four years ago, slowing the
overall growth in government revenue.  Real-estate-tax collections, a main source of income for
 cities,  slid $5.3 billion, or 2.9 percent, from a year earlier
to $177.1 billion, the  Census Bureau reported  today. The drop
exceeded a 2.5 percent decline in the first quarter of 2010, the
data show.  The slide in realty taxes restrained the growth of state
and local revenue during the fourth quarter to 1.6 percent, less
than in the previous two quarters, the Census Bureau said.  Moodyâ€™s Investors Service said March 17 it expects the
taxable value of housing to drop through much of 2011. It said
this year would be the toughest for local governments struggling
to balance their budgets since the onset of the recession in
2007.  Property-tax collections continued to rise after the
housing-market decline because of the lag between when prices
change and when values are reset by local tax authorities.  To contact the reporters on this story:
