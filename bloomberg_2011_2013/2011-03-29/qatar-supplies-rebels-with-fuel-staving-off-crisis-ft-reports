Qatar provided Libyan rebels with
petroleum, diesel oil and cooking gas and sent two tankers
filled with 3,800 tons of liquefied petroleum gas to opposition-
held towns in eastern  Libya , the FT reported, without
attribution. The fuel shipments have staved off a cooking gas
crisis in rebel areas, the FT said, citing Magdi Raid, general
manager at Brega Marketing Co., the state-owned distributor of
oil products in Libya.  To contact the reporter on this story:
