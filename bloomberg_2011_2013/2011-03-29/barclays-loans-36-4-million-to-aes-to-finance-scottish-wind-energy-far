Barclays Plc (BARC) , the U.K.’s third-
largest bank, loaned the U.S. power company  AES Corp. (AES)  22.8
million pounds ($36.4 million) to finance a Scottish wind
project that will supply enough energy for 14,000 homes.  AES will begin construction in April on the 28.6-megawatt
Drone Hill wind farm in southeast Scotland, the Arlington,
Virginia-based company said today in an e-mailed statement.  Drone Hill is expected to cost 38.6 million pounds. AES
supplied 15.8 million pounds of equity for it, according to the
statement. The 15-year loan will cover the remainder and was
completed March 22.  The project will use turbines from the German supplier
 Nordex SE (NDX1) , and is expected to go into commercial operation in
August 2012, according to the statement. AES inherited Drone
Hill in April when its AES Wind Generation unit purchased Your
Energy Ltd., a U.K.-based renewable energy company.  Statkraft AS, the Norwegian utility, signed a 15-year
power-purchase contract for Drone Hills’s electricity, according
to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
