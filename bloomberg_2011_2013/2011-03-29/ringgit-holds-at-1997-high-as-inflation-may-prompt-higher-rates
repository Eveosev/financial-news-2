Malaysia ’s ringgit traded near a
13-year high on speculation policy makers will raise  interest
rates  or allow more currency appreciation to tackle inflation.  Bank Negara Malaysia  signaled last week that it would
counter rising prices and won’t limit the ringgit’s advance to
protect exporters. Consumer prices in Southeast Asia’s third-
largest economy rose by the most since April 2009 last month.
The ringgit has rallied 1.2 percent so far this quarter.  “The market expects more measures to tighten liquidity and
higher interest rates” which should support the ringgit, said D.
Sivadass, a currency forwards trader at EON Capital Bhd. in
Kuala Lumpur.  The ringgit was little changed at 3.0285 per dollar as of
9:38 a.m. in  Kuala Lumpur , according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. It reached 3.0210 on March 25, the highest level
since October 1997. The currency has strengthened every quarter
since March 2009.  Bank Negara has kept its overnight rate at 2.75 percent
since July, after raising it three times earlier in 2010. Its
next policy meeting is on May 5.  Inflation in Malaysia accelerated to 2.9 percent in
February from a year earlier, compared with 2.4 percent in
January, the government said on March 25.  “Monetary policy in 2011 has the flexibility to remain
accommodative, although the degree of accommodation may need to
be adjusted to ensure that economic growth in the medium term
will not be damaged by higher inflation,” the central bank said
in its annual report published on March 23.  To contact the reporter on this story:
