Several big quantitative  hedge
funds , which employ mathematical strategies fed into computers,
have suffered severe losses as a result of the Japanese
earthquake and tsunami, the Financial Times reported.  The $4 billion flagship fund of Connecticut-based Graham
Capital Management LP lost $300 million, almost 8 percent of its
value, in the first two weeks of the month, and its other funds
lost about 5 percent each, the newspaper said, citing an
unidentified investor.  Winton Capital Management Ltd., which manages $17 billion,
saw its flagship fall 3.6 percent in the middle of the month,
the FT said.  Other such funds have suffered smaller losses, depending on
the trading models they use; BlueTrend, run by BlueCrest Capital
Management Services Ltd., was down only 1.24 percent in the
middle of the month, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
