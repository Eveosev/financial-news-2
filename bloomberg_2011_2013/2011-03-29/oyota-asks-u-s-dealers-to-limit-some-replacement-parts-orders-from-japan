Toyota Motor Corp. (7203)  asked U.S.
dealers to limit replacement-parts orders to those that are
"critically needed" because supplies of some components from
 Japan  likely will be disrupted.  “Damage sustained by certain Japanese parts suppliers will
interrupt their normal production,” the Toyota City, Japan-
based company said in an e-mail to dealers today. While
replacement-part inventories are adequate for now, about 233
components have been placed on controlled allocation out of more
than 300,000 in use, Toyota said.  Toyota, the world’s largest automaker, has suspended most
auto and parts production in Japan since the magnitude-9
earthquake and tsunami that has left more than 27,000 people
dead or missing. The company said last week it expects some
North American auto production to be reduced because of likely
parts shortages.  Toyota’s U.S. sales unit is based in Torrance, California.  To contact the reporter on this story:
