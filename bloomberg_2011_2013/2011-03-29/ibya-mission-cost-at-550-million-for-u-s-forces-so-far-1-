The U.S. cost of the Libya mission
has reached $550 million, mostly for bombs and missiles
including  Raytheon Co. (RTN)  Tomahawk cruise missiles, and may total
$800 million by the end of September if the U.S. continues
operations until then, according to the Defense Department.  The rate of spending will drop quickly as NATO takes over
the mission, which began March 19. The next three weeks, until
April 16, will cost an estimated $40 million, according to
Pentagon “talking points” provided to the  U.S. Congress .  The decline reflects what the Pentagon projects will be a
“sharp” drop in the use of U.S. fighter jets, aerial tanker
refueling and intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance
flights.  If the operation continues at the reduced level after April
16, the Pentagon expects a monthly cost of about $40 million,
according to an e-mail statement by Navy Commander Kathleen
Kesler, a Pentagon spokeswoman.  The document provided to Congress estimates the total cost
of $800 million if the operation lasts through the end of fiscal
2011 on Sept. 30. The caveat that the Pentagon offered Congress
is that “future costs are highly uncertain.”  The Defense Department is funding the  Libya  operations by
using money “designated for other national security purposes”
and drawing from its munitions inventory, according to the
document provided to Congress.  The Pentagon is being funded through a stopgap measure at
fiscal 2010 levels. Congress has yet to approve a Pentagon
spending bill for fiscal 2011, which started last Oct. 1.  No Supplemental Request  President  Barack Obama  isn’t expected “at this time” to
request supplemental funding to cover the costs of the Libya
operation, according to the Pentagon document.  Out of the approximately $550 million cost for the first 10
days of the operations -- March 19 through March 28 -- the
Pentagon said about $340 million was for munitions, mostly
Raytheon Tomahawk missiles, which cost $1.5 million apiece.  The U.S. launched 192 Tomahawks in the first 10 days, for a
cost of about $288 million, according to Bloomberg calculations.
The remainder of the $550 million, or $210 million, covers
operating costs for primarily aircraft and partly for ships,
according to the talking points.  The U.S. has more than 4,000 personnel involved in the
Libya mission and is using about 175 aircraft. The U.S. aircraft
include the  Lockheed Martin Corp. (LMT)  F-16CJ fighters,  Boeing Co. (BA) ’s
AV-8B Harrier aircraft, EA-18G Growler electronic-jamming jets
and KC-135 refueling tankers, as well as Lockheed Martin’s and
Boeing’s AC-130U close-air-support plane.  One Boeing F-15E crashed over Libya on March 22. One of
those planes costs $79.2 million. The Pentagon in the document
provided to Congress said a similar fighter jet can no longer be
purchased. The loss of the jet wasn’t counted in the cost
estimate.  -- Editors: Steven Komarow, Bob Drummond  To contact the reporter on this story:
