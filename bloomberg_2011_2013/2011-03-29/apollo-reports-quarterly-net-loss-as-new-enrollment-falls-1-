     March 29 (Bloomberg) --  Apollo Group Inc. (APOL) , operator of the
University of Phoenix and the biggest U.S. for-profit college,
fell the most since January in New York trading, after
projecting declines in new student enrollment and revenue.  Apollo expects to report revenue of $4 billion to $4.25
billion in the year ending August 2012 and operating income, not
including special items, of $675 million to $800 million, the
Phoenix-based company said today in a statement. Analysts had
estimated $4.55 billion in revenue and $1.1 billion in operating
profit, according to a survey by Bloomberg.  Apollo’s new student enrollment may decline for the next
several quarters as the company institutes a program that lets
students sample classes before enrolling, Co-Chief Executive
Officer Greg Cappelli told investors today in a conference call.
Apollo is changing its approach as the U.S.  Education Department 
and Congress question the student-loan defaults, dropout rates
and debt levels of those attending for-profit colleges.  “We’re not making any excuses,” Cappelli said. “This has
been a very challenging year. But we’re absolutely committed to
always doing the right thing for our students.”  Apollo reported a net loss of $64 million, or 45 cents a
share, in the second quarter ended Feb. 28, compared with a
profit of $92.6 million, or 60 cents, a year earlier, according
to the statement.  The company fell $1.80, or 4.3 percent, to $40.55 at 4 p.m.
in Nasdaq Stock Market composite trading after dropping as much
as $4.35, or 10 percent, to $38, the biggest intraday decline
since Oct. 14.  New Enrollment  New student enrollment at the  University of Phoenix  fell 45
percent to 48,200 from a year earlier, Apollo said in the
statement. Analysts had expected the figure to decline by 42
percent.  Apollo reported a loss primarily because it reduced the
value of its U.K.-based BPP business, which had larger-than-
expected enrollment declines, the company said in a conference
call. That item and others reduced profit by about $222 million.
Without these items, the company said income was $118.2 million,
or 83 cents a share. The average estimate of 19 analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg was 69 cents a share.  The Bloomberg U.S. For-Profit Education Index of 13
companies fell 1.5 percent.  ITT Educational Services Inc. (ESI) , based
in Carmel,  Indiana , fell $2.30, or 3.3 percent, to $68.37 in New
York Stock Exchange trading.  Strayer Education Inc. (STRA) , based in
Arlington, Virginia, fell $6.61, or 5 percent, to $127.06 in
Nasdaq composite trading.  To contact the reporter on this story:
