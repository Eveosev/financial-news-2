Gold prices rose, ending the
longest slump in 10 weeks, as fighting in  Libya  and mounting
European debt concerns spurred demand for an investment haven.  Libyan rebels retreated under fire from Muammar Qaddafi’s
troops as President Barack Obama and U.K. Prime Minister David
Cameron said they may consider sending arms to the opposition
forces. Standard & Poor’s yesterday cut credit ratings for
Greece and Portugal. Gold futures reached a record of $1,448.60
an ounce on March 24 amid turmoil in northern Africa and the
Middle East and the escalating earthquake disaster in Japan.  “It is certainly the geopolitical factors which are still
playing a role,” said  Peter Fertig , the owner of Quantitative
Commodity Research Ltd. in Hainburg, Germany. “The situation in
Libya is quite open and far from over.”  Gold futures for June delivery rose $7.40, or 0.5 percent,
to settle at $1,424.90 at 1:38 p.m. on the Comex in  New York .
This quarter, the price has climbed 0.3 percent, heading for a
10th straight gain.  The metal dropped in the previous four sessions, the
longest slide since early January, as signs that the U.S.
economy is improving spurred bets that  interest rates  will
increase.  The  Federal Reserve ’s “highly accommodative” monetary
policy is partly to blame for rapidly increasing global
commodity prices, Kansas City Fed President  Thomas Hoenig  said
today. He called on colleagues to raise the benchmark rate
toward 1 percent soon.  Silver futures for May delivery rose 52.4 cents, or 1.4
percent, to $37.511 an ounce. This quarter, the price has surged
21 percent, heading for the ninth straight advance.  Palladium futures for June delivery gained $5.15, or 0.7
percent, to $758.10 an ounce. The price has dropped 5.6 percent
this quarter.  Platinum futures for July delivery climbed $30, or 1.7
percent, to $1,774.10 an ounce, the biggest gain since March 1.
The metal has dropped 0.2 percent this quarter.  To contact the reporter on this story:
