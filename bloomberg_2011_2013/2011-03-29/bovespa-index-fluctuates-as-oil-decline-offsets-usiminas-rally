The Bovespa stock index fluctuated
between gains and losses as  oil prices  dropped, dimming the
outlook for producers, and offsetting a rally for Usinas
Siderurgicas de Minas Gerais SA.  Voting shares of Usinas Siderurgicas led gains for the
index as rival Cia. Siderurgica Nacional SA may buy a bigger
stake in the company. Oil company OGX Petroleo & Gas
Participacoes SA tumbled.  The Bovespa stock index was little changed at 67,214.61 at
9:50 a.m. New York time. Forty-one stocks fell on the index,
while 27 gained. The measure is down 3 percent this quarter, the
biggest three-month decline since the quarter ended June 30,
2010. The real rose 0.3 percent to 1.6588 per  U.S. dollar .  Crude oil dropped to the lowest price in a week in  New York 
as the advance of Libyan rebels against Muammar Qaddafi’s troops
spurred hope that the conflict in Africa’s third-largest oil
producer may soon end.  OGX declined 0.9 percent to 19.48 reais.  Cia. Siderurgica said it may buy more shares in Usinas
Siderurgicas to alter its rival’s management or control
structure. CSN, as the Rio de Janeiro-based company is known,
bought voting shares of Usiminas between Jan. 26 and March 21 to
increase its stake to 8.62 percent from 5.03 percent, the
company said late yesterday in a document on its website.  Voting shares of Usiminas gained 2.5 percent to 29.52
reais.  The Bovespa has retreated this year as homebuilders and
banks fell on concern faster inflation will limit growth,
outweighing gains in oil and steel producers. The index trades
at 10.7 times analysts’ earnings estimates, according to weekly
data compiled by Bloomberg. That compares to a ratio of 14 for
the Shanghai Composite Index, 7.5 for  Russia ’s Micex, and 17.8
for  India ’s Sensex.  To contact the reporter on this story:
