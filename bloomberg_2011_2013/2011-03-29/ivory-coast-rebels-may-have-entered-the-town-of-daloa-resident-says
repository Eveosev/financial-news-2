Ivory Coast rebels who back
 Alassane Ouattara , recognized by the  United Nations  as the
winner of a disputed election last year, may have entered the
town of Daloa, Ibrahima Coulibaly, a resident of the town, said
by phone today.  Troops who appear to be rebel forces are on the streets of
the town and have been firing warning shots, he said.  President Larent Gbagbo has refused to cede power to
Ouattara.  To contact the reporter on this story:
