Egypt  is ready to “open a new
page” with  Iran , with which it hasn’t had full diplomatic
relations since 1979, Foreign Minister Nabil el-Arabi said,
according to the state-run Middle East News Agency.  “The Egyptian government doesn’t consider Iran to be an
enemy state,” MENA cited el-Arabi as saying. “We’re opening a
new page with all countries, including Iran.”  Restoring full diplomatic ties depends on the Iranian side,
he said, according to MENA.  Egypt has accused Iran in the past of using proxy groups
such as the Lebanese Shiite Hezbollah movement to increase its
influence in the Middle East. The two countries haven’t had full
diplomatic relations since 1979, when former Egyptian President
Anwar Sadat gave refuge to the deposed Iranian shah, Reza
Pahlavi.  To contact the reporter on this story:
