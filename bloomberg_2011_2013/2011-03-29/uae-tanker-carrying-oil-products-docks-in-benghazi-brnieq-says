A United Arab Emirates tanker
carrying 20,838 metric tons of gasoline and 10,843 tons of other
oil products docked in Benghazi port on Sunday,  Brnieq  reported,
citing Khalifa al-Warfali, the harbor’s office manager.  The information published on the Libyan newspaper’s website
could not be immediately verified because Bloomberg could not
get through by telephone to officials in Benghazi, the
stronghold of rebels opposing Libyan leader  Muammar Qaddafi .  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
