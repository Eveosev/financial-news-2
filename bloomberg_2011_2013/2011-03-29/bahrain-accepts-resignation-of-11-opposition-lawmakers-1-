Bahrain’s parliament accepted the
resignation of 11 members of the largest Shiite opposition
party, al-Wefaq, which has refused dialogue with the government
after more than a month of unrest.  Abduljalil Khalil, the leader of Al-Wefaq, was among
the lawmakers to resign, the official Bahrain News
Agency reported today. A vote on whether to accept the
resignation of another seven members of parliament was delayed,
the official Bahrain News Agency said today.  About a dozen people have been killed in more than a month
of protests led by Shiites calling for increased civil rights
and democracy in the Sunni-led country. The government declared
a three-month state of emergency on March 15 after troops from
 Saudi Arabia  and other Arab Gulf states arrived to support the
administration.  Al-Wefaq last month rejected an offer of talks with Crown
Prince Salman bin Hamad Al Khalifa aimed at resolving the
conflict. Khalil said his party would only enter into dialogue
when tanks were withdrawn from the streets. Khalil has also said
that “no one will accept outside involvement” in Bahrain.  Shiites make up about 70 percent of Bahrain’s population
and many retain cultural and family ties with  Iran  as well as
with Shiites in Saudi Arabia, a minority of about 10 to 15
percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
