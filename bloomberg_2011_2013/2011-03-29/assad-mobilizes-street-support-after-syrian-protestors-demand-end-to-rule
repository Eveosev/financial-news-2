Supporters of Syrian President
Bashar al-Assad staged rallies across the country to shore up a
leader facing the strongest challenge since he came to power 11
years ago.  State-run television showed live footage of hundreds of
thousands pouring onto the main streets of Damascus, Aleppo,
Hama and al-Hassakah today.  The pro-regime marches are a response to protests in
several Syrian cities and towns since mid-March to demand
political reforms, including an end to a 48-year-old emergency
law. More than 90 people were killed as the government cracked
down on dissent, according to reports cited by  Amnesty
International .  The Syrian demonstrations marked the latest extension of
the political turmoil that has engulfed the Middle East and
North Africa this year. Popular uprisings have toppled Tunisia’s
Zine El Abidine Ben Ali and  Egypt ’s Hosni Mubarak, and
threatened the rule of  Muammar Qaddafi  in  Libya .  The government of Syrian Prime Minister Muhammad Naji Otri
may resign today, to be replaced by a new cabinet that Assad
will appoint within 24 hours,  Agence France-Presse  said, citing
an unidentified Syrian official.  Unconfirmed reports say 37 people were killed in Damascus,
the capital, and other towns including Latakia, Daraa and Homs
since March 25, Amnesty International said on its website
yesterday. In the Daraa governorate, which is in the south-west
of the country near the border with Jordan, at least 55 people
died last week, according to credible sources, Amnesty said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
