(Corrects story originally published March 28 to show
profit decreased in second paragraph.)  Cia. Siderurgica Nacional,  Brazil ’s
third-largest steelmaker, said fourth-quarter profit fell 39
percent on lower iron-ore sales.  Net income decreased to 450 million reais ($270.6 million),
from 743 million reais during the same period in 2009, the
company said today in a regulatory filing.  Iron-ore sales including those of its Namisa unit fell 8
percent during the quarter to 6.4 million metric tons. Total
crude steel production climbed 4 percent to 1.23 million metric
tons in the quarter, CSN said.  “For the upcoming quarters, we expect steel mills to
reduce their discounts, given the increase in steel prices in
the international market,” Raphael Biderman, an equity analyst
at Banco Bradesco BBI SA in Sao Paulo, said in a note to clients
March 25.  CSN rose 0.4 percent to 26.55 reais at the market close in
 Sao Paulo  today. The Bovespa index was down 0.9 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
