Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) ’s consumer unit
recalled 750,000 bottles and packages of Tylenol and other over-
the-counter drugs that may have been produced on improperly
cleaned equipment or tainted by a musty odor.  The McNeil Consumer Healthcare unit is recalling 34,000
bottles of Tylenol 8-hour Extended Release Caplets in the U.S.
made before a  Fort Washington ,  Pennsylvania , plant was shut down
last April, Bonnie Jacobs, a spokeswoman for  New Brunswick , New
Jersey-based J&J, said today in an e-mail. McNeil also added
717,696 bottles and packages to a Jan. 14 recall of Tylenol,
Benadryl and Sudafed that may have been made on unclean
equipment, Jacobs said.  J&J, the world’s second-biggest seller of medical products,
pulled more than 40 consumer brands last year, among them
varieties of children’s and infants’ Tylenol, Motrin and St.
Joseph Aspirin. The withdrawals cost the company $900 million in
lost sales in 2010 and led to a consent decree giving U.S.
regulators more oversight at three McNeil plants.  The Tylenol 8-hour recall resulted from McNeil’s “ongoing
surveillance and monitoring program” following the odor
problems, Jacobs said. “As a result of these enhanced
surveillance efforts, we identified a small number of complaints
and following a comprehensive investigation, we determined the
cause of the complaints and took action to recall” one lot of
the product.  Wooden Pallets  The smell has been traced to trace amounts of 2,4,6-
tribromoanisole and 2,4,6-trichloroanisole, the company said in
a  statement  today. The chemicals are related to a fire retardant
and pesticide used to treat wooden storage pallets, the U.S.
 Food and Drug Administration  said last year.  “This voluntary action is being taken as a precaution and
the risk of adverse medical events is remote,” the statement
said.  Customers have complained of nausea, vomiting and diarrhea
from the odors, J&J has said in previous statements.  J&J fell 2 cents to $59.22 at 4 p.m. in composite New York
Stock Exchange trading and has lost 8.6 percent in the past 12
months. New York-based  Pfizer Inc. (PFE)  is the biggest maker of
medical products by sales.  The expansion of the Jan. 14 recall includes 180,288
bottles of Tylenol Arthritis Pain extended-release geltabs;
108,336 packages of Tylenol Sinus medicine; 207,288 bottles of
Tylenol 8-hour Extended-Release; 87,216 bottles of Benadryl
Allergy Sinus Headache medicine; and 134,568 packages of Sudafed
PE Cold/Cough Multisymptom, Jacobs said.  The withdrawal covers 10 lots at the wholesale level,
McNeil said in its statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
