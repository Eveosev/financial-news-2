Williams Companies Inc. filed for
international arbitration against  Venezuela , seeking
compensation for two natural-gas compression facilities taken by
President  Hugo Chavez  in 2009.  Williams filed for arbitration with the  International
Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes  on March 25, said
Jeff Pounds, a spokesman for the Tulsa, Oklahoma-based pipeline
operator. He declined to comment on how much the company is
seeking in compensation.  Williams joins  Tidewater Inc. (TDW) ,  Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) ,
 ConocoPhillips (COP)  and other companies going to court after failing
to reach an agreement with Chavez and state-owned Petroleos de
Venezuela SA on the seizures.  Chavez ordered the seizure of more than 60 oil-services
companies in 2009 as part of a drive to bring the economy under
state control. Venezuela seized Williamsâ€™s El Furrial and PIGAP
II gas compression facilities as part of the nationalizations.  PDVSA ran up debts with oil services firms of as much as
$7.5 billion in 2009 before the asset seizures. Chavez also took
assets from John Wood Group Plc and rigs from  Helmerich & Payne
Inc (HP)  last year.  Not including the Williams case, Venezuela is currently
facing 16 arbitration cases from companies in the energy,
cement, agriculture and mining industries, according to the
website of Washington-based International Centre.  To contact the reporters on this story:
