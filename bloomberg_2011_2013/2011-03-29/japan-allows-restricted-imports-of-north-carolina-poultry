Japan  is allowing imports of North
Carolina poultry slaughtered before Feb. 9, according to the
U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Food Safety and Inspection
Service.  Poultry processed on or after that date is not eligible for
export to the Asian nation, the service said today in a  report 
on its website. The USDA’s Animal and Plant Health Inspection
Service last week said that Japan halted imports of poultry from
the state.  To contact the reporter on this story:
