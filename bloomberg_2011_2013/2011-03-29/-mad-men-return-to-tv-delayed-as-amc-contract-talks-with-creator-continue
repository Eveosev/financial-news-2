AMC, a cable channel owned by
 Cablevision Systems Corp. (CVC) , is delaying the fifth season of “Mad
Men” as it negotiates a contract with the show’s creator.  The fifth season will be delayed until early 2012 to give
AMC and “key non-cast negotiations” more time, the network
said today in an e-mailed statement. The  New York  Times reported
earlier AMC is in talks with show creator Matthew Weiner.  The delay leaves AMC without a high-profile program that
won the Emmy for best drama for three straight years. It also
means the show, about the 1960s New York advertising industry,
won’t air until after Bethpage, New York-based Cablevision plans
to spin off its cable channels into a separate company called
AMC Networks Inc. in the middle of this year.  Keith Addis, Weiner’s manager, didn’t respond to a call or
e-mail seeking comment.  Lions Gate Entertainment Corp. (LGF) , based in
Vancouver and run from  Santa Monica , California, is the show’s
production company.  AMC, based in New York, wants to shrink each “Mad Men”
episode by several minutes to provide more commercial time and
to cut two cast members to save money, Deadline.com and News
Corp.’s The Daily reported yesterday. Weiner objects to both
proposals, the publications said.  Cablevision declined 3 cents to $34.32 at 4:01 p.m. in New
York Stock Exchange composite trading. The shares have risen 1.4
percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
