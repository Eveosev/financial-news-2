Groupe Lactalis Deputy General
Manager and Lactalis President in Italy Antonio Sala said he is
concerned about the effect Italy’s plans to change its laws on
foreign control of companies will have on overseas investors,
the Financial Times reported, citing an interview.  Italy can’t “change the rules halfway through the game,”
Sala said, according to the FT.  To contact the reporter on this story:
