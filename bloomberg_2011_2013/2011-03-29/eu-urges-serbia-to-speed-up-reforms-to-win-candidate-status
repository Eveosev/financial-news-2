The European Commission’s
enlargement chief urged  Serbia  to “get serious” about reforms
it needs to implement to become an official candidate for
European Union membership.  Serbia’s tasks include improving its judiciary to fight
organized crime and corruption, tighter control of political
party financing, changes to its electoral law, restitution of
property seized under the former Communist regime and capturing
two remaining war-crime suspects, Deputy Prime Minister Bozidar Djelic and Enlargement Commissioner Stefan Fule said after talks
in Belgrade today.  “It is time for all the stakeholders in Serbia to get
serious about reforms” needed before the country’s 2009
application for EU membership can be accepted, Fule said.
Seventeen out of 27 EU states have ratified the bloc’s
Stabilization and Association Agreement with Serbia, he said.  Serbia hopes to win the candidate status this year, even
after its failure to arrest Bosnian Serb wartime commander Ratko Mladic, indicted for genocide in the 1990s Balkan wars.  “You deliver on reforms, and the EU delivers on your
progress, Fule said. “You are given this chance this year.”  He also dismissed concerns about enlargement fatigue in the
EU, saying it was “a myth, like the yeti -- it is often
discussed, but never seen.”  The Balkan country recently filled a 2,483-point EC
questionnaire on its political, economic and social reforms. Its
 EU Integration Office  said it is currently responding to 629
additional questions from Brussels.  To contact the reporter on this story:
