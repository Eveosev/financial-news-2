Turkish central bank deputy
governor Erdem Basci said the bank’s main concern is crisis-
prevention, Bloomberg HT reported without providing further
details.  The central bank wants to slow credit growth, Basci said,
according to the Istanbul-based news channel. The current
account deficit last year exceeded 6.5 percent of economic
output, he said.  The bank in Ankara has raised  reserve requirements  for the
nation’s banks three times since the start of December and cut
the benchmark interest rate to a record low in moves it says
will help deter short-term capital inflows and a credit bubble
that may threaten to destabilize the economy.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
