Taiwan ’s 10-year government bonds
gained, ending a three-day loss, as worsening radiation leaks at
a nuclear power plant in  Japan  spurred demand for the safest
assets.  Radiation levels that can prove fatal were detected outside
reactor buildings at Japan’s Fukushima Dai-Ichi plant, signaling
a partial fuel meltdown and complicating efforts to contain the
worst nuclear disaster since Chernobyl. The Central Bank of the
Republic of  China  (Taiwan) will meet on March 31 and all but one
of 18 economists in a Bloomberg survey forecast the monetary
authority will raise its discount rate on 10-day loans by 12.5
basis points to 1.75 percent.  “Japan’s radiation risk had some impact on Taiwan’s bonds
today,” said Ivy Leung, a Taipei-based fixed-income trader at
Polaris Securities Co. “But volume is very thin. Investors are
still waiting for the central bank to hold its quarterly rate
meeting.”  The yield on the 1.375 percent bond due March 2021, the
most-traded government security, fell one basis point, or 0.01
percentage point, to 1.36 percent as of its 1:30 p.m. close,
according to Gretai Securities Market.  Taiwan’s dollar appreciated 0.1 percent to NT$29.477,
according to Taipei Forex Inc. It touched NT$29.440 on March 25,
the strongest level since March 10, and has appreciated 3
percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
