Norway’s government should spend
less than 4 percent of the nation’s sovereign wealth fund in the
next few years, as it takes into account the country’s economic
expansion, the finance minister said.  The government will return to the fiscal spending rule this
year, Sigbjoern Johnsen wrote today in an article published in
Aftenposten.   The rule requires the government to limit spending to the
average return on the country’s oil fund, estimated at an annual
4 percent.   Click here for web link  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
