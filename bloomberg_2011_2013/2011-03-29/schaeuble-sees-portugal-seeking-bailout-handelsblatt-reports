German Finance Minister  Wolfgang Schaeuble  expects debt-strapped  Portugal  to seek an
international bailout by June, Handelsblatt reported, citing an
unidentified ministry official.  Portugal is reluctant to tap the European Unionâ€™s bailout
fund out of concern that the  International Monetary Fund  will
impose spending cuts on the government as a condition for aid,
the Dusseldorf, Germany-based  newspaper  reported today.  Germany 
would insist that the IMF negotiate the austerity program,
Handelsblatt said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
