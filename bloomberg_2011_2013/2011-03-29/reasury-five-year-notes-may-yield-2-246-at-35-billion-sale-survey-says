The Treasury’s $35 billion sale of
five-year notes may draw a yield of 2.246 percent, according to
the average forecast of 8 of the  Federal Reserve ’s 20 primary
dealers surveyed by Bloomberg News.  The securities, which mature in March 2016, yielded 2.245
percent in pre-auction trading. Bids are due by 1 p.m. New York
time.  Today’s offering is the same size as the past six monthly
five-year debt auctions. The last sale of the maturity, on Feb.
23, drew a yield of 2.19 percent, up from 2.041 percent the
month before.  The February sale’s bid-to-cover ratio, which gauges demand
by comparing the amount bid with the amount offered, was 2.69,
down from 2.97 at the January offering. The average for the past
10 sales is 2.79.  Indirect bidders, an investor class that includes foreign
central banks, purchased 34.2 percent at the February sale and
an average of 40.9 percent for the past 10 auctions.  Direct bidders, non-primary dealers that place their bids
directly with the Treasury, purchased 7.7 percent of the
securities at the last sale, compared with an average of 10.5
percent at the past 10 offerings.  Five-year notes returned 6.8 percent last year, compared
with a loss of 0.04 percent this year, according to Bank of
America Merrill Lynch indexes. Treasuries overall gained 5.9
percent last year and have lost 0.1 percent this year.  The Fed’s primary dealers trade  government securities  with
the central bank and are obligated to participate in U.S. debt
auctions.  The Treasury auctioned $35 billion of two-year notes
yesterday at a yield of 0.789 percent, the highest level since
April 2010. The department will sell $29 billion of seven-year
debt tomorrow.  To contact the reporter on this story:
