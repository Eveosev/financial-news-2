Foreign investors are leading
buying in Turkish bonds after yields returned to “attractive
levels” due to a decision by the central bank to raise  reserve
requirements  for banks, Gurol Ozer, head of fixed-income trading
at Denizbank AS said.  Ozer recommended selling Turkish benchmark two-year bonds
at 8.50 percent and buying at 9.10 percent. He spoke in a
telephone interview from Istanbul today. Yields on the bonds
fell 7 basis points to 8.93 percent at 4:37 p.m. today.  “Yields are now falling thanks to foreign investor
interest,” he said. “Yields around 9 percent are quite
reasonable for foreigners, while 6.5-7 percent levels were not
very attractive,” Ozer said.  Two-year bonds weakened the most in 16 months on March 23
as the central bank increased reserve requirements to 15 percent
on lira deposits of less than one month from as low as 10
percent. The yield fell to a record low of 6.90 percent on Jan.
5 and traded at a nine-month high of 9.11 percent on March 8.  “The central bank steps were negative for Turkish banks
but they are positive for the lira and for foreign investors
because this is monetary tightening,” said Ozer.  The central bank’s increase in reserve requirements last
week, which will go to into effect on April 15, will withdraw
19.1 billion liras ($12.2 billion) of liquidity from the market,
the bank said on March 23.  Foreign investors sold a net $261 million in  government
bonds  in the week ending March 18, reducing their total stock to
$37.65 billion, central bank data published on March 24 showed.
Overseas investors bought a total of $4.25 billion in the
preceding five weeks.  Turkish banks have been selling bonds to provide more
liquidity, central bank governor Erdem Basci said in an
interview in  Prague  today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
