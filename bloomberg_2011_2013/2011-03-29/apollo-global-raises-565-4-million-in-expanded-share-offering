Apollo Global Management LLC raised
$565.4 million, 13 percent more than it sought, pricing its
share sale at the top end of the marketed range and increasing
the number of shares sold.  The private-equity firm founded by  Leon Black  sold 29.8
million shares at $19 each, the company said yesterday in a
statement. Apollo fell 28 cents to $18.72 at 10:22 a.m. in New
York Stock Exchange composite trading.  Apollo is one of four scheduled U.S. offerings seeking to
raise a total of $1.08 billion this week after the earthquake in
 Japan  earlier this month caused global markets to slump and
share sales in the U.S.,  Europe  and Asia were shelved or
scrapped. Successful deals may signal renewed confidence in the
U.S. market for initial public offerings, where companies this
year have raised more than triple the amount in the first
quarter of 2010.  Apollo had offered 26.3 million shares at $17 to $19
apiece, according to a filing with the U.S. Securities and
Exchange Commission. Proceeds will be used for general corporate
purposes and “to fund growth initiatives,” the prospectus
showed.  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) ,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM)  and  Bank of
America Corp. (BAC)  led Apollo’s offering. The shares will start
trading today on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol
APO.  Underwriter Option  Apollo, based in New York, sold 21.5 million shares in the
sale. It had planned to offer 18 million, according to the
original terms. Selling stockholders including Goldman Sachs
offered the remaining 8.26 million shares. The underwriters may
buy 4.46 million additional shares from Apollo by exercising an
overallotment option, the company said.  Qihoo 360 Technology Co., the Chinese provider of computer
anti-virus products and Web browsers, raised $175.6 million, 16
percent more than originally sought, in its U.S. initial public
offering yesterday.  UBS AG of Zurich and New York-based Citigroup Inc. led
Qihoo 360’s offering. The ADRs will trade on the  New York  Stock
Exchange under the symbol QIHU.  To contact the reporter on this story:
