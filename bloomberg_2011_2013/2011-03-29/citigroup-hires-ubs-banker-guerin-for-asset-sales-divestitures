Citigroup Inc. (C) , the third-largest
U.S. bank by assets, hired former  UBS AG (UBSN)  European mergers co-
head Pat Guerin to advise clients on asset sales.  He will be based in London and report to European M&A chief
Wilhelm Schulz, New York-based Citigroup said in an internal
memorandum to employees. A spokeswoman in London confirmed the
contents of the document today.  Citigroup said in February that it planned to hire as many
as 20 senior corporate and investment bankers in  Europe  in the
first half of 2011 as it rebuilds a team weakened by departures.
The New York-based firm has about 1,000 investment and corporate
bankers in Europe, the Middle East and  Africa . Citigroup is the
ninth-ranked adviser on European mergers this year above UBS,
which is in 11th place, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  UBS, Switzerland’s largest bank, yesterday named Liam Beere
and Cary Kochman joint global heads of mergers and acquisitions,
and appointed Alison Harding-Jones and Jonathan Rowley co-heads
for European mergers.  Separately, Citigroup also hired Stuart Popham, a former
senior partner at law firm Clifford Chance, as a vice chairman
of Europe, Middle East and Africa banking. He will work with the
bank’s largest U.K. clients, according to the firm.  Popham “brings an array of top-tier relationships, forged
during his 34 years at Clifford Chance,” Philip Robert-Tissot,
head of U.K. broking and banking, said in the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
