The U.S. Defense Department said it
expects to spend as much as $80 million in humanitarian
assistance for  Japan .  U.S. Navy ships and helicopters have been involved in
rescue efforts following the 9.0 magnitude earthquake and
subsequent tsunami that hit Japan’s Tohoku region on March 11
and crippled the Tokyo Electric Power Co.’s Fukushima Dai-Ichi
nuclear plant.  The Pentagon will pay for humanitarian assistance out of
the so-called overseas humanitarian, disaster assistance and
civic aid account, according to Pentagon talking points provided
to Congress.  The Pentagon is currently funded under stopgap legislation
at 2010 budget levels, including $110 million in that account.  According to the information provided to Congress, the
Defense Department also expects to pay between $50 million and
$175 million for the voluntary evacuation of dependents of U.S.
military personnel stationed in Japan.  The U.S. military has about 38,000 personnel stationed in
the region, dispersed among 85 facilities on Honshu, Kyushu and
Okinawa, according to U.S. Forces Japan. There are an additional
11,000 service members on Navy ships.  The eventual cost depends on whether an estimated 6,000
dependents will evacuate or as many as 21,000 dependents, which
is estimated to be the total number of dependents residing in
Honshu, Japan, according to the document. The Pentagon said that
its “current best estimate” is 6,000.  -- Editors: Steven Komarow, Bob Drummond  To contact the reporter on this story:
