Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S.
Bernanke  told lawmakers that the central bank won’t be able to
meet its congressional deadline of April 21 for issuing final
rules limiting debit card ‘swipe’ fees.  Still, Bernanke, in a letter sent today to the House
Financial Services Committee and Senate Banking Committee, said
the Fed is “committed” to finishing the rules before July 21,
when the cap on fees is required to become effective under the
Dodd-Frank regulatory overhaul.  To contact the reporter on this story:
