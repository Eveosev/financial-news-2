Posco (005490) , the world’s second-biggest
maker of stainless steel, will increase domestic prices of the
alloy used in home appliances and cars by about 5 percent next
month because of rising raw material costs.  Prices of the 400-series hot-rolled coil will climb by
100,000 won a metric ton to 2.04 million won ($1,833) in April,
Chung Jae Woong, a spokesman for the Pohang, South Korea-based
company, said today by phone. He didn’t give details about scrap
costs. The 300-series hot-rolled products, used mostly in
buildings, will drop by 100,000 won a ton to 4 million won after
prices of nickel, a key raw material, fell, he said.  Nickel for delivery in three months dropped about 10
percent this month on the London Metal Exchange. The price was
little changed at $26,200 a ton at 3:02 p.m.  Seoul  time.  Stainless steel products contributed about 13 percent of
Posco’s sales in 2009, according to the company’s filing.  Posco shares gained 0.2 percent to close at 517,000 won in
Seoul trading, the highest price since Oct. 12. The benchmark
 Kospi index (KOSPI)  advanced 0.8 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
