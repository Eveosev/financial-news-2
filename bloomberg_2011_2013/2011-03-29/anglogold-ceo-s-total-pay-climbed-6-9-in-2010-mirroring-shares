AngloGold Ashanti Ltd. (ANG) , Africa’s
largest miner of the metal, raised Chief Executive Officer Mark Cutifani’s total payments and benefits 6.9 percent last year as
the company’s share price climbed by almost the same amount.  Cutifani received total payments of 22.4 million rand ($3.3
million), including an 11.4 million rand salary and bonus of 8.5
million rand, Johannesburg-based AngloGold said in the company’s
 annual report  published on its website today.  AngloGold rose 6.7 percent in Johannesburg trading last
year, and has declined 2.9 percent so far in 2011.  To contact the reporter on this story:
