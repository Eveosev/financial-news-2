Vale SA (VALE5) , the world’s largest iron
ore producer, would handle potential management changes in
accordance with its shareholders’ agreement, Standard & Poor’s
said.  “If a change in Vale’s top management occurs, it will be
done taking into account corporate rules and a shareholders’
agreement,”  Milena Zaniboni , Sao Paulo-based managing director
for corporate and government ratings at S&P, said today at the
Bloomberg Brazil Economic Summit in Sao Paulo.  Brazil’s government is pushing to replace Vale’s Chief
Executive Officer Roger Agnelli in a dispute over domestic
investments. Vale is currently underperforming peers in Brazil’s
bond market.  Dollar bonds for Vale due in 2020 lost 1 percent in the
week until March 28, compared with a return of 0.4 percent for
Brazilian companies and a 0.2 percent increase for emerging
market corporate debt, according to JPMorgan Chase & Co.’s CEMBI
Index.  Vale is rated BBB+, the third-lowest investment grade, by
 Standard & Poor’s  and Fitch. Moody’s Investors Service rates it
one step lower at Baa2.  To contact the reporters on this story:
