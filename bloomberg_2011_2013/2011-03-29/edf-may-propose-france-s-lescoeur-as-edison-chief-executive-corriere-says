EDF SA (EDF)  may propose Bruno Lescoeur
to replace Umberto Quadrino as chief executive officer of  Edison
SpA (EDN) ,  Corriere della Sera  reported, without saying where it got
the information.  EDF, through an agreement among the owners of the holding
that controls Edison, has the right to name the CEO, Corriere
said. Italian shareholders, who can name the company’s chairman,
may nominate ex-Milan Mayor Gabriele Albertini, Corriere said.  EDF controls about 50 percent of Edison, Italy’s second-
biggest power generator, through direct and
indirect stakes.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
