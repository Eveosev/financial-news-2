Nigeria  is in talks with Korean
Electric Power Corp. over the sale of majority stake in the
Egbin Power Plant, located in the western Lagos state, The
 Nation  reported, citing Nuhu Wya, minister of state for power.  The power station is the biggest in the country with a
capacity of 1,320 megawatts, the Lagos-based newspaper reported.  The Nigerian government last year decided to cede its
controlling stakes in electricity generation and distribution
companies to private investors. Blackouts are common in Nigeria,
 Africa â€™s most populous nation, as demand for power outstrips
supply.  To contact the reporter on this story:
