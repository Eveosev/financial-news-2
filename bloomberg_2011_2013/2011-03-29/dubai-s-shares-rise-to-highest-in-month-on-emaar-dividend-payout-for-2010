Dubai shares rose, sending the
benchmark index to the highest level in more than a month, after
 Emaar Properties PJSC (EMAAR) , the builder of the world’s tallest tower,
unexpectedly approved a 10 percent cash dividend.  Emaar surged as much as 4.4 percent to the highest intraday
level since Feb. 13. Emirates Integrated Telecommunications Co.,
the phone company known as Du, advanced for the first time in
three days. The  DFM General Index (DFMGI)  rose as much as 1.4 percent to
the highest since Feb. 20, before trimming gains to 0.4 percent
at 11:27 a.m. in Dubai. The measure is up for a sixth day, the
longest winning streak since September. It has lost 4.1 percent
this quarter as popular uprisings swept across the Middle East.  “The Emaar dividend came as a surprise to the market, as
initially they were expecting no dividend,” said Mahdi Mattar,
head of research at Dubai-based Capm Investment PJSC.
“Investors, and mainly local retail investors, are happy to see
the return of a dividend payout at Emaar.”  Emaar’s management, which wasn’t planning a dividend for
2010, bowed to pressure from shareholders after a three-hour
meeting yesterday in Dubai. The company’s fourth-quarter net
income tumbled 62 percent to 273 million dirhams ($74 million)
compared with 720 million dirhams in the year-earlier period.  ‘Geopolitical Risk’  Emaar rose as high as 3.32 dirhams. The shares last traded
at 3.26 dirhams.  Deyaar Development (DEYAAR)  PJSC, another Dubai-based
real-estate developer, gained 0.9 percent to 23 fils. Du
increased 1 percent to 3.12 dirhams.  Gulf stocks have declined this quarter with the BGCC 200
Index falling 3.7 percent. Protests, which have led to the
ouster of presidents in Tunisia and  Egypt , spread to countries
including Bahrain, Yemen, Libya, Oman and Syria. “Geopolitical
risk and the resulting volatility is the main theme,” Mattar
said.  Abu Dhabi ’s  ADX General Index (ADSMI)  gained 0.1 percent and
Qatar’s  QE Index (DSM)  added 0.2 percent. Oman’s benchmark stock index
fell 0.6 percent, Bahrain’s gauge lost 1.5 percent and the
Kuwaiti benchmark was little changed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
