Portugal  won a challenge against a
European Union decision forcing it to pay a fine of more than
3.6 million euros ($5.1 million) for failing to meet a deadline
to bring its public procurement laws into line with an EU rule.  The European Commission “was not entitled to decide” that
Portugal had failed to bring its law into line with earlier
court rulings and “then draw conclusions from this for the
calculation of the penalty payment,” ruled the EU General
Court, the region’s second-highest tribunal, according to an e-
mailed statement from the Luxembourg-based court today.  The European Commission, the 27-nation region’s executive
agency, decided in 2008 that Portugal had failed to comply with
a court ruling ordering it to pay 19,392 euros for every day it
delayed complying with the EU law.  Portugal challenged the commission’s decision to demand a
fine payment from the day of the court ruling, Jan. 10, 2008,
until July 18, 2008. Portugal argued its national law was in
compliance as of Jan. 30, 2008 and it should only be charged a
fine for the 20 days before that date.  Chantal Hughes, a spokeswoman for the commission in
Brussels, declined to immediately comment.  The case is: T-33/09, Portugal v. European Commission.  To contact the reporter on this story:
