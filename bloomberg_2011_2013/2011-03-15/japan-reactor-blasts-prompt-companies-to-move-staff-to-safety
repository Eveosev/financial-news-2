Workers at  Blackstone Group LP (BX) ,  Bayerische Motoren Werke AG (BMW)  and  BNP Paribas (BNP)  SA are leaving Japan
as the government battles to cool nuclear reactors damaged by
last week’s record earthquake.  Blackstone, the world’s largest private equity firm, closed
its Tokyo office for a week and offered the 28 employees there
to move to another place of their choice with their families on
a temporary basis, a person with knowledge of the matter said.
BNP Paribas, France’s biggest bank, sent around 10 workers in
Japan to  Hong Kong  and Singapore, spokesman Daniel Boyd said.  As Prime Minister Naoto Kan called for calm in the wake of
Japan’s worst disaster since World War II, expatriates and their
employers were left trying to assess whether efforts to prevent
a nuclear spill would be successful.  Citigroup Inc. (C)  is among
companies getting requests from employees to relocate, while BMW
and  ICAP Plc (IAP)  have taken steps to move workers to safe locations.  “I sent my family to the Philippines this morning,” said
Tokyo-based Curtis Freeze, founder of Prospect Asset Management
Inc., which manages $280 million and has been investing in Japan
for more than two decades. “At least there is peace of mind
this way.”  Freeze, whose wife is Filipino and who owns a house in the
country, said he’ll stay in Tokyo to work.  The death toll from the earthquake and the tsunami it
unleashed rose to 3,676 as of 8 a.m. local time, according to
official police figures.  Core Damage  Companies are moving to ensure the safety of workers after  Tokyo  Electric Power Co.’s stricken nuclear power plant 135
miles (220 kilometers) north of the capital was rocked by
explosions. A fire broke out at the Fukushima Dai-Ichi plant
today, and  Tokyo Electric  said it can’t rule out the possibility
of damage to the cores of two reactors at the facility.  Citigroup has received requests from several senior
employees at its trading operations in Tokyo to relocate out of
Japan, a person with knowledge of the matter said. ICAP, the
world’s largest broker of transactions between banks, is
allowing expatriates in Tokyo with families to relocate on a
temporary basis to Hong Kong and Singapore, another person said.  New York-based Citigroup isn’t planning to move staff out
of the country, spokeswoman Naomi Watanabe said in an interview.  “We have contingency plans, and if the situation changes
this may involve moving some staff to other locations as needed
to ensure business continuity,” Watanabe said. “We are in
constant touch with local government officials.”  A spokeswoman at ICAP in  London  didn’t immediately return a
call seeking comment.  Business as Usual  Major financial firms in Japan are operating “business as
usual,” the International Bankers Association, which represents
companies including  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) , Citigroup and Bank
of America Corp., said in a  statement  on its website.  WestLB AG, the German state-owned lender bailed out during
the financial crisis, has offered its remaining 20 or so
employees in Tokyo the option of working from abroad in other
locations, Armin Kloss, a spokesman for the company, said via
telephone. BMW and  Continental AG (CON)  said they’re moving expatriate
employees out of Japan.  Terrence Giang, who’s studying Japanese in Yokohama near
Tokyo, said he isn’t taking any chances. Giang, who worked as an
analyst at Warren Lichtenstein’s Steel Partners Japan in  New
York  until last year, said he booked an American Airlines Corp.
flight leaving for Los Angeles today. He had earlier planned to
leave  Japan  on March 18.  “Earthquakes are one thing but when it comes to something
like radiation poisoning, it’s something to some extent that you
have to be very concerned about,” said Giang, 31.  France Evacuates  France began evacuating nationals, Prime Minister Francois Fillon said, while Germany advised citizens to leave Japan.
About 100 Germans live in the Tohoku area, where a magnitude 9
quake struck Japan on March 11, while 2,600 are in Tokyo and 900
in the Kanagawa area, Mari Shindo, a spokeswoman at the embassy,
said in an interview.  Deutsche Lufthansa AG,  Europe ’s second-biggest airline, has
suspended flights to and from Tokyo and is rerouting planes to
Nagoya and  Osaka , spokesman  Thomas Jachnow  said.  Qantas Airways Ltd., Australia’s biggest carrier, hasn’t
experienced any significant increase in demand for travel out of
Japan since the earthquake. The company has about 3,000 seats
available on outbound flights in the next three weeks, spokesman
Luke Enright said by phone today.  Unlike  France  and Germany, the U.S. hasn’t recommended its
citizens leave Japan. John Roos, U.S., ambassador to Japan, said
today that countries must make their own decisions and the U.S.
will do so based on the safety of Americans.  Peter Cooper, a 26-year-old Tokyo-based English language
teacher from Toronto who’s lived in Japan for five months, said
he’s moving to Osaka for a few days.  “My parents back home have been in contact with me,
basically screaming at me to leave the country,” Cooper said as
he waited for a train at the Tokyo Station yesterday. “Half of
me is terrified, and the other half is ready to wait and see
what happens.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
