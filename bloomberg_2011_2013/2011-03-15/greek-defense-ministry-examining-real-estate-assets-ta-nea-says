  Greece ’s  Defense Ministry  is
drawing up a list of land and buildings it owns for possible
development, Ta Nea reported, without citing anyone.  A government committee on state asset sales has begun the
process of selecting consultants to assess the property owned by
the country’s armed forces, the Athens-based newspaper said. The
real estate portfolio of the Defense Ministry includes dozens of
apartments and land in both urban and rural areas, the newspaper
said. Income from the military’s real estate could cover 2
percent of spending on armaments, according to previous
calculations, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
