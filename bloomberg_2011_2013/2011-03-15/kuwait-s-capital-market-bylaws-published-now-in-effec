The bylaws for Kuwait’s Capital
Markets Law were published March 13 in the weekly official
Gazette and are now in effect, according a statement on the
Kuwait Stock Exchange website today.  The country’s  Capital Markets Authority  is likely to start
operating this month after its bylaws are published, Yousuf al-
Ali, a member of the authority’s board, said in an interview
March 7.  Kuwait’s parliament approved a bill in February 2010 to
create the authority, the country’s first stock market
regulator. Lawmakers said at the time that the bill would bring
more transparency to the Kuwait Stock Exchange, which has lacked
regulation and affected small investors.  The authority’s responsibilities would include regulating
bourse activity “so that it is fair, competent, competitive and
transparent,” according to the bill. It will also supervise
public and private subscriptions, and regulate and oversee
acquisitions and mergers.  To contact the reporter on this story:
