  Air Liquide SA (AI) , the world’s biggest
producer of industrial gases, said some production units have
been affected by the earthquake and subsequent tsunami in  Japan .  The company’s main oxygen production unit in the North
Western part of the country is still running, Corinne Estrade- Bordry, a spokeswoman at Paris-based Air Liquide, said in a
telephone interview today. It’s too early to provide more
details about the fallout from the disaster, she said.  Air Liquide is working to provide its most critical
customers such as hospitals and home-care patients with oxygen,
and nitrogen used to preserve the safety of industrial
processes, she said.  All 2,700 employees based in Japan are safe, the
spokeswoman said. The company’s local headquarter in  Tokyo  is
temporarily closed, and operations are run from a facility near
Osaka. Air Liquide had about 1.2 billion euros ($1.7 billion) of
revenue in Japan in 2010, according to Estrade-Bordry,
accounting for about 8.9 percent of total sales.  To contact the reporter on this story:
