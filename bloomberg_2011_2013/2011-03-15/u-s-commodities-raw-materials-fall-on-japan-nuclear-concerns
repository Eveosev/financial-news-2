Wheat plunged the most in seven
months and agriculture prices tumbled on concern that the
earthquake and nuclear crisis in  Japan  will slash raw-material
demand. A gauge of commodities dropped the most in four months.  Corn, soybeans, cotton, cattle, rice, oats and soybean oil
dropped the most allowed by exchanges in Chicago and  New York .
Crude oil had the largest decline in almost five months.
Equities in Japan had the biggest two-day drop since the 1987
crash as the risk of radiation leaks north of  Tokyo  escalated.
U.S. Treasuries surged.  “Increasing levels of radiation have people dumping
positions in stocks and commodities and piling assets into
cash,” said Alan Brugler, the president of Brugler Marketing &
Management LLC in Omaha,  Nebraska . “There’s increased  risk
aversion  until the situation stabilizes in Japan.”  The UBS Bloomberg Constant Maturity Commodity Index dropped
3.4 percent, the most since Nov. 16, to 1,661.23. The gauge was
down for the seventh straight session, the longest slide since
September 2005. On March 7, the measure of 26 energy, metal and
agriculture prices climbed to a record. Today, only natural gas
posted a gain.  Wheat futures for May delivery dropped 53 cents, or 7.4
percent, to $6.6775 a bushel on the  Chicago  Board of Trade, the
biggest decline since Aug. 6.  Corn futures for May delivery fell by the CBOT limit of 30
cents, or 4.5 percent, to $6.36 a bushel, the lowest since Jan.
20. Soybean futures for May delivery declined the by the maximum
of 70 cents or 5.2 percent, to $12.70 a bushel, the lowest since
Dec. 13.  Japan is the world’s leading buyer of corn, the third-
largest importer of soybeans and the fifth-biggest purchaser of
wheat.  Crude oil  Oil futures for April delivery dropped $4.01, or 4 percent,
to $97.18 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange, the
lowest settlement since Feb. 28. The price fell the most since
Oct. 19.  Japanese concerns outweighed speculation that supply
disruptions in the Middle East will increase. Bahrain declared a
state of emergency as a second contingent of troops from Gulf
nations poured into the kingdom, while Libyan government forces
moved against rebels. A third explosion and fire struck Tokyo
Electric Power Co.’s Fukushima nuclear plant.  “The unrest in  Libya  has been pushed to the back burner by
the tragedy in Japan,” said  Gene McGillian , an analyst at
Tradition Energy in  Stamford ,  Connecticut . “The third fire at
the Fukushima plant is a sign that we’re looking at a longer-
term problem, which will have a considerable impact on the
Japanese economy.”  Gold  Gold dropped the most in 10 weeks as some investors sold
the metal to raise cash after equities tumbled. Palladium and
platinum slipped on concern that industrial demand will wane.  Toyota Motor Corp., the world’s largest automaker, and
other car manufacturers closed plants after Japan quake and
tsunami. Platinum and palladium are used to make pollution-
control devices in vehicles.  “It is all related to the situation in Japan and some
people might have to sell whatever they can to raise funds,”
said  Peter Fertig , the owner of Quantitative Commodity Research
Ltd. in Hainburg,  Germany . “With carmaker plants closed, there
is less demand.”  Gold futures for April delivery fell $32.10, or 2.3
percent, to $1,392.80 on the Comex in New York, the biggest drop
since Jan. 4.  Palladium futures for June delivery fell $43.30, or 5.8
percent, to $704.90 on the  New York Mercantile Exchange . The
metal was down for the ninth straight session, the longest slide
since July 2008.  Platinum futures for April delivery slipped $46.70, or 2.7
percent, to $1,705.60 an ounce.  Commodities settled as follows:  Precious metals:
