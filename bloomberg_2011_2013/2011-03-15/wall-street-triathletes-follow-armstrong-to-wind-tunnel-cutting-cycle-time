Martin Gilmore , a partner at BB&T
Capital Partners, aims to compete again in the  Ironman World
Championship  in  Hawaii  later this year thanks to a high-speed
wind tunnel in Mooresville, North Carolina.  Gilmore was aboard his $6,000 carbon-fiber 2006  Cervelo  P3
model last week trying to make himself and his bike less wind-
resistant for the 112-mile leg of July’s  Ironman Lake Placid 
race, where he hopes to qualify for October’s triathlon
championship in Kona, Hawaii.  The two-hour session inside the  A2 Wind Tunnel , built by
former General Motors Corp. aerodynamicist Gary Eaker, cost
about $1,000 and resulted in what could be a 15-minute
difference in Gilmore’s ride time during the Lake Placid,  New
York , race.  “Fifteen minutes is huge,” Gilmore, 50, said during an
interview while pedaling inside the tunnel. “When you look at
the available Kona slots, it comes down to a couple minutes. So,
you just can’t describe the impact that 15 minutes could have.”  Gilmore, who has qualified for the Kona race on three other
occasions, is part of a fast-growing group of amateur
triathletes descending on the tunnel, which has been used by top
U.S. cyclists including  Lance Armstrong  and George Hincapie.
Last year, about 250 cyclists and triathletes -- who swim, bike,
and run in their races -- bought time in the tunnel, up from
about 100 in 2007, according to Mike Giraud, 38, the tunnel’s
operator and bike specialist.  Six-fold Growth  Since 2000, when triathlon first appeared in the Olympics,
membership in USA Triathlon, the sport’s governing body in the
U.S., has soared more than six-fold to 135,000 in 2010 from
20,000 a decade earlier. Competitors in Ironman races have an
average annual income of $161,000, according to World Triathlon
Corp., which is owned by Providence Equity Partners Inc., a
Providence, Rhode Island-based buyout firm.  “I get tons of those people,” Giraud said. “It’s
definitely the demographic that I most deal with.”  They are anxious to spend some of their income for some
time inside Eaker’s five-year-old tunnel, a smaller version of
his AeroDyn Wind Tunnel, built next door and used primarily by
Nascar racing teams.  About 80 percent of the tunnel’s time is booked for bike
testing, according to Giraud. The tunnel, which cost about
$500,000 to build, is also used by lower-budget race car
enthusiasts and was used for the U.S. bobsled team before the
2010 Winter Olympics.  Hincapie Visit  The tunnel’s first bike customer was Steve Hed, whose
aerodynamic, carbon wheels are used by many Tour de France
winners, including Armstrong and  Alberto Contador . Hed brought
Hincapie to the tunnel with him for that first visit and then
showed up with German national time trial champion  Bert Grabsch .  “At A2, you have the benefit of using a good tunnel and
you also get Mike, who really knows what he’s doing,” said Hed,
55. “It’s the ideal combination.”  The tunnel is becoming so popular among high-spending
cyclists, Norcross, Georgia-based  Blue Competition Cycles  offers
a  free one-hour session  in the tunnel for anybody purchasing its
custom-made triathlon bikes, which cost between $4,500 and
$11,500.  While Gilmore will never be confused for Armstrong, who has
said he will compete in the 2011 Hawaii Ironman, that hasn’t
stopped him from trying.  Top Finisher  In his first full Ironman-distance race in 2001, Gilmore
was the top finisher in the 40-44 age group at 10 hours, 45
minutes. He most recently qualified and raced in Hawaii in 2006,
finishing 43rd out of 166 in the 45-49 age group at 10:37:18.
Like most Ironman triathletes, his training requires countless
hours away from his family. “It can be a very selfish sport,”
said Gilmore, who works in Winston-Salem,  North Carolina , where
BB&T is headquartered.  When his teenage daughter was diagnosed with Type 1
diabetes in 2007, Gilmore began using competitions to raise
awareness and money for the  Juvenile Diabetes Research
Foundation . He raised $40,000 when he competed in Hawaii in 2006
and said his  goal  is to surpass that total for the  2011 race .  In the seven Ironman-distance races he has completed,
Gilmore’s best time was 9:52 at Ironman Florida in November
2008, an effort that also qualified him for Hawaii in 2009. It
also left him in the post-race medical tent wondering if he
wanted to go through it all again 11 months later. He decided
not to.  “As I lay there, I could not see myself going to Kona,”
he said. “The guy next to me looked like the exorcist with the
stuff he was throwing up.”  After giving up his 2009 Hawaii spot, Gilmore said he’s
hoping his visit to the wind tunnel helps him earn a return
trip.  Reducing Drag  “The environment is so electric that it’s just something I
want to experience again,” he said.  While inside the tunnel, Giraud lowered Gilmore’s
handlebars and brought his elbows closer to his body, reducing
the  coefficient of drag  his body produced by about 16 percent.
(3.06 to 2.63). As a result, Gilmore was able to generate 58
more watts of pedaling power, allowing him to travel 1 mile per
hour faster while using the same effort. At that rate, Gilmore
could cover the 112-mile course 15 minutes and 41 seconds faster
than in his previous riding position.  “Based on the improvements, I think it’s going to be money
very well spent,” Gilmore said. “The magnitude of the changes
is beyond what I had expected. I’m very pleased.”  In addition to reducing his drag coefficient, there was one
other simple reason Gilmore wanted to visit the tunnel.  “It’s really cool,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story: Michael Buteau in
