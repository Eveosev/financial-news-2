Hurricane Fly, the 11-4 favorite
ridden by Ruby Walsh, won the Champion Hurdle, the main race on
the opening day of the centenary Cheltenham horseracing festival.  The seven-year-old, trained by Ireland’s Willie Mullins,
came with a late surge to overhaul Peddlers Cross (9-2), which
finished second, and Oscar Whisky (7-1) in third. The two-mile,
110-yard race in western  England  carried a top prize of 211,000
pounds ($338,000).  “He never settled really and ran keen but we knew he has
the speed and the class,” Walsh told Channel 4. “He’s got
unbelievable speed and class, and a big heart. I got to the
front sooner than I wanted, thank God he won.”  The previous favorite for this year’s race, 2010 winner
Binocular, was withdrawn two days ago after testing positive for
a medication.  Other races today were won by Al Ferof (10-1), ridden by
Walsh, Captain Chris (6-1), Bensalem (5-1) and Sizing  Australia 
(13-2). Quevega (5-6 favorite) completed a training double for
Mullins and a treble for Walsh, and Divers (10-1) took the last
race.  The Cheltenham festival, one of the main events in the U.K.
jumps-racing calendar, ends on March 18.  To contact the reporter on this story:
