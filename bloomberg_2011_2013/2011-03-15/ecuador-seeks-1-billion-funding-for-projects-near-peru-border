  Ecuador  is seeking about $1 billion
in financing for infrastructure projects to boost growth near
its border with  Peru , the country’s planning secretariat said.  Ecuador needs about $700 million through 2013 for public
works, including dredging the Port of Jeli to improve access for
exporters in the country’s southern mining and agricultural
region, Marcelo Torres, executive director of Plan Binacional,
the national planning secretary’s border development authority,
said.  A further $300 million is required for drinking water
projects in towns along the Peruvian border, Torres said today
in an interview in Quito.  The South American country is seeking financing from local
and foreign investors, governments including Spain, Germany and  Italy , and multilateral lending agencies, Torres said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
