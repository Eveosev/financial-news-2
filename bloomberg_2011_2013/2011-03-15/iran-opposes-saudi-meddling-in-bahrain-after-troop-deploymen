Iran’s Foreign Ministry accused  Saudi Arabia  and other Gulf countries of interfering in
Bahrain’s domestic affairs by sending troops to help quell
protests by mostly Shiite Muslim opposition groups.  “The presence of foreign troops and meddling into
Bahrain’s internal affairs will only further complicate the
issue,” Foreign Ministry spokesman  Ramin Mehmanparast  said in a
Tehran press conference today. Bahrain protesters “have certain
demands that are being expressed peacefully. Their demands need
to be met and any kind of violence should be avoided,”  Mehmanparast, whose comments were aired live by state
television, spoke after Saudi Arabian troops moved into Bahrain
yesterday as part of a regional force from the Gulf Cooperation
Council. Their deployment, the first cross-border intervention
since a wave of popular protests began to spread across the Arab
world two months ago, followed escalating protests by Bahrain’s
Shiite-led opposition.    Iran  is Shiite-ruled and has a mainly Shiite population.
Bahrain’s Shiites comprise as much as 70 percent of the
population, and they have been demonstrating since Feb. 14,
demanding democracy through free elections from their Sunni
ruler. King Hamad bin Isa Al Khalifa’s offer of a “national
dialogue” hasn’t appeased the protesters, some of whom are now
demanding the overthrow of the monarchy.  At least seven people have been killed since the protests
in Bahrain started, and more than a hundred were injured in
fighting with security forces on March 13.  To contact the reporter on this story:
