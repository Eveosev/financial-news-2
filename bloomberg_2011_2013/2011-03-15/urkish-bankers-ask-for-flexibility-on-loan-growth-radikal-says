Turkish banks asked Deputy Prime
Minister  Ali Babacan  for more flexiblity in implementing a 25
percent limit on loan growth this year, Radikal newspaper
reported.  Members of the Banks Association of  Turkey  met Babacan in
Istanbul and argued that some types of lending do more to widen
the current-account deficit than others, the newspaper said.
They requested the lifting of the limit on some credit types, it
said, without giving details.  Babacan did not "categorically reject" the request and
asked for more information, Radikal said, citing unidentified
bankers at the meeting.  Click here for web link  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
