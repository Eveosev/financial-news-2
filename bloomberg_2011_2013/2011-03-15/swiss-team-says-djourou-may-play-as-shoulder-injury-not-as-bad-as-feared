Johan Djourou may play again this
season after his national team said the Arsenal defender’s
shoulder injury might not be as bad as first feared.  Djourou, 24, was taken from the field on a stretcher during
last weekend’s F.A. Cup loss to Manchester United. After the
game, manager  Arsene Wenger  said Djourou would miss remainder of
the season.  The Swiss federation said on its website today that
preliminary tests showed Djourou’s injury isn’t as bad as first
feared. It said he hadn’t suffered any fractures and the
ligaments around the shoulder weren’t badly strained.  Switzerland plays a European Championship qualification
match with Bulgaria on March 26 and “every effort” is being
made to ensure Djourou is ready for the game.  News that the defender could play again would be a major
boost for Arsenal, which can only go for the Premier League
after being eliminated from the League Cup, F.A. Cup and
Champions League in the last two weeks. The Gunners trail leader  Manchester United  by three points having played one match fewer.  To contact the reporter on this story:
