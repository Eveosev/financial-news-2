U.S. stocks pared losses after the  Federal Reserve  said the economy was on a “firmer footing” and
concern eased that a nuclear accident outside of Tokyo will
result in catastrophic losses.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index lost 1.1 percent to
1,282.64 at 2:52 p.m. in  New York  after sinking as much as 2.7
percent earlier. The  Dow Jones Industrial Average  retreated
124.16 points, or 1 percent, to 11,869.00.     Stocks began paring losses earlier after Japan’s Chief
Cabinet Secretary Yukio Edano said radiation readings outside
reactors rocked by explosions were falling below harmful levels,
while a fire at a separate unit appeared to have been put out.
Earlier, Edano said the steel unit containing the radioactive
core of one reactor had been damaged and warned of dangerous
contamination.  Equities continued to trim declines as the Fed affirmed
plans to buy $600 billion of Treasuries through June and said
the recovery is gaining strength.    “The economic recovery is on a firmer footing, and overall
conditions in the labor market appear to be improving
gradually,” the  Federal Open Market Committee  said today in its
statement after a one-day meeting in Washington. The effects of
higher fuel and commodity costs on inflation will be
“transitory,” and officials “will pay close attention to the
evolution of inflation and inflation expectations,” the Fed
said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
