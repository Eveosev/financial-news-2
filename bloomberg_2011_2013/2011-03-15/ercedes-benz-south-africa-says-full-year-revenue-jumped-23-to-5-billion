Mercedes-Benz South Africa Ltd., a
unit of Daimler AG, said full-year revenue rose 23 percent to
34.7 billion rand ($5 billion).  “While it’s clear we can’t expect an ‘overnight’ return to
our 2006/2007 peak, we could possibly be right up there again in
two years’ time,” Hansgeorg Niefer, chief executive officer of
the Pretoria-based company, said in an e-mailed statement today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
