  Barclays Plc (BARC) , Britain’s third-
largest bank, said regulators are considering making the bank
include $10.8 billion of debt managed by Protium Finance LP in
its financial statements.  “The ongoing review of Barclays’s financial statements by
regulators includes consideration of the non-consolidation of
Protium,” Barclays said in its  annual report  published late
yesterday. “Barclays continues to conclude that it is
appropriate not to consolidate Protium within the group
financial statements.”  Barclays sold the debt in 2009 to Protium, a fund run by  Stephen King , former head of the bank’s principal mortgage
trading group, and Michael Keeley, who was a member of Barclays
Capital’s management committee, to reduce losses linked to
credit market volatility. Barclays at the time said the assets
would remain on its balance sheet for regulatory purposes. The
bank took a 532 million-pound ($853 million) charge last year
against a $12.6 billion loan provided to Protium.  “The group’s results would not be materially different if
Protium were to be consolidated,” the bank said.  A spokesman for London-based Barclays didn’t immediately
return a call. The  Times newspaper  reported the story earlier.  To contact the reporter on this story:
