  Gilead Sciences Inc. (GILD)  and units of
patent-partner  Roche Holding AG (ROG)  sued Indian generic drugmaker  Natco Pharma Ltd. (NTCPH)  for allegedly infringing a U.S. patent for the
 Tamiflu  influenza medication.  Gilead, which gets royalties from Roche Holding for the
drug, asked for a court order to block other versions of Tamiflu
until the 1998 patent expires in 2017, according to a filing
yesterday in federal court in Wilmington, Delaware.  “This action arises because of Natco’s efforts to gain
approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to market
generic copies” while claiming the Gilead patent isn’t valid,
according to the complaint filed by Maryellen Noreika, a lawyer
for the plaintiffs.  In February, Natco became the first company to file an
application with U.S. regulators for a generic version of
Tamiflu, which logged about $1 billion in U.S. sales in 2009.  Rajeev Nannapeneni, chief operating officer of Natco in
Hyderabad, said in a phone interview that he didn’t know about
the lawsuit and couldn’t comment further.  Gilead, based in  Foster City , California, fell 70 cents or
1.7 percent, to $40.06 at 1:18 p.m. New York time in Nasdaq
Stock Market trading.  The case is Gilead v. Natco, 11cv221, U.S. District Court,
District of Delaware (Wilmington).  To contact the reporter on this story:
