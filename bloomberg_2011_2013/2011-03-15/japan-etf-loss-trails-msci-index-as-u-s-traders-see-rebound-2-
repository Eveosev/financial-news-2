Trading in an exchange-traded fund
linked to Japanese stocks shows investors expect shares in the
world’s third-largest economy to rebound when trading resumes.  The  iShares MSCI Japan Index Fund (EWJ)  tracking 323 securities
fell 1 percent to $9.95 at 2:51 p.m. in New York after earlier
reaching $9.24, its lowest intraday level since July. That
compares with the 9.1 percent plunge in the MSCI  Japan  Index
earlier, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  “It’s trading with a lot of premium,” said Scott Burns,
director of ETF analysis at Morningstar Inc. in  Chicago . “That
happens with mistimed ETFs when the underlying market is closed.
Typically the market price is a leading indicator for what would
happen tomorrow when the market opens there, and it’s especially
true when we see more severe dislocations.”  The Nikkei-225 Stock Average posted its biggest two-day
drop since 1987, falling 11 percent today to 8,605.15 on concern
a nuclear accident would cripple the economy. The Nikkei Stock
Average Volatility Index, a measure derived from the cost of
insuring Japanese stocks against losses with options, jumped to
the highest level since December 2008, data compiled by
Bloomberg show.  Call Trade  In the U.S. options market, an investor bought 102,500
April $11 calls to buy the ETF while selling the same number of
April $8 puts to sell the ETF at about 11 a.m.  New York  time,
according to Pipeline Trading Systems LLC.  “It’s somebody picking a spot in the sand here, drawing
the line and saying, ‘At these levels, I definitely want to be
long.’” said Etai Friedman, head derivatives trader at MKM
Partners LP in  Stamford ,  Connecticut .  The trade profits if the ETF rises above $11.02 when next
month’s options expire April 15. The last close above that level
was March 9, and the ETF’s highest close this year was $11.61 on
Feb. 17.  “It’s a very bullish bet,” said Brett Marcus, an options
trader at Needham & Co. in New York. “It’s an interesting way
to play a rebound in Japan because by structuring this trade
using this strategy they cushion their downside considerably
more than if they own the shares.”  April $11 Calls  Almost 351,400 calls changed hands, 15 times the four-week
average and 1.2 times the number of puts. The most-traded
contracts were the April $11 calls, which accounted for four-
tenths of all call volume and jumped 60 percent to 16 cents.  Elsewhere in the options market, investors made bets on  Hong Kong  and Korean ETFs.  Call volume for the  iShares MSCI Hong Kong Index Fund (EWH) 
jumped to 29 times the four-week average and 3.4 times the
number of puts. The most-traded contracts were the April $19
calls, which accounted for more than half of all call volume and
dropped 47 percent. A total of 3,502 April $19 calls traded for
a contract that had an open interest of 106 before today. The
ETF dropped 2.4 percent to $18.19.  Put trades for the  iShares MSCI South Korea Index Fund (EWY)  rose
to a 10-month high after two trades with a strike price 8.1
percent below yesterday’s close. A block of 12,985 March $54
puts traded for 19 cents apiece at 13:02, after another 6,000 of
the same options changed hands for 18 cents each at 11:29 a.m.
Open interest for the contracts was 1,509 before today. The
contracts will expire at the end of this week.  Almost 30,000 puts traded, 9.5 times the four-week average
and 21 times the number of calls. The March $54 puts were the
most-active contracts and accounted for more than eight-tenths
of all put volume. The ETF fell 2 percent to $57.59.  Calls give the right to buy a security for a certain
amount, the strike price, by a set date. Puts convey the right
to sell. Investors use options to guard against fluctuations in
the price of securities they own, speculate on share-price moves
or bet that volatility, or stock swings, will rise or fall.  To contact the reporters on this story:
