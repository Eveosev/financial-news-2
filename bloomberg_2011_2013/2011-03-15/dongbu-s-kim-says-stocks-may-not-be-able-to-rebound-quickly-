Kim Il Hyuk, an analyst at Dongbu
Securities Co., comments on stocks amid growing concern about
the safety of  Japan ’s nuclear plants damaged by the country’s
worst earthquake on record.  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index sank as much as 7.5 percent
while Japan’s Topix index tumbled as much as 14 percent, its
worst intraday loss since the 1987 stock market crash.  On  market sentiment :  “The shock seems to be pretty big. Foreign investors are
selling heavily, and there are a lot of jitters that they may be
getting out of the Asian market altogether.  ‘‘People had thought the earthquake may not have long-term
impact on the Japanese economy, but now they’re thinking this
will be a factor that can drag down the economy for a while.  ‘‘Japan plays an important role in the industrial value
chain, so people are concerned it will affect industries of
other countries.’’  On the outlook for stocks:  ‘‘The market may not be able to rebound quickly. It’ll take
some time for the market to trend upward again.  ‘‘We need some time to decide whether the drop is a
reflection of worries about the economy or a temporary shock.’’  To contact the reporter on this story:
