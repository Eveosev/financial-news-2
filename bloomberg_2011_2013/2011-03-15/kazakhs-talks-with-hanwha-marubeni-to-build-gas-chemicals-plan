  Kazakhstan  is in talks with  South
Korea ’s Hanwha Chemical Corp.,  Japan ’s  Marubeni Corp. (8002)  and the
investment arm of the Abu Dhabi government as it seeks financing
for a 645 billion tenge ($4.4 billion) polyethylene plant.  The Caspian Sea state is also negotiating with  China
Petroleum & Chemical Corp. (600028) , the Hong Kong-listed company known
as Sinopec, and with LG Chem Ltd., South Korea’s biggest
chemicals maker, which it seeks as a partner on a “parity
basis,” according to the Oil & Gas Ministry’s  plan  published
today in Kazakhstanskaya Pravda, the official newspaper.  Sinopec last March won a contract to build a 300 billion-
tenge polypropylene plant in western Kazakhstan. The
polypropylene plant will form part of a  gas chemicals complex ,
which will be able to produce 500,000 metric tons of
polypropylene a year and 800,000 tons of polyethylene, the main
chemical in plastics, once it reaches full capacity in 2015, the
ministry said.  Sinopec agreed to buy and export all the polypropylene
produced at the facility, Kazakh Deputy Oil and Gas Minister
Aset Magauov said in March last year. The Export-Import Bank of  China  will provide a $1.26 billion loan for the project, he
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
