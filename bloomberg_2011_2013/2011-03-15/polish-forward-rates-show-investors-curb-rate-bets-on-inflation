Polish interest-rate derivatives
show investors pared bets the central bank will raise borrowing
costs next month after a report showed consumer prices grew at a
slower pace in February than analysts expected.  Forward-rate agreements fixing three-month interest costs
one month from today fell after the inflation report to 4.29
percent as of 2:20 p.m. in Warsaw from 4.32 percent yesterday.  Polish inflation rose an annual 3.6 percent, matching the
downwardly revised January figure, the Warsaw-based  Central
Statistical Office  said today. The result was below the 3.9
percent median estimate of 24 economists polled by Bloomberg.
Prices increased 0.2 percent from a month earlier.  To contact the reporter on this story:
