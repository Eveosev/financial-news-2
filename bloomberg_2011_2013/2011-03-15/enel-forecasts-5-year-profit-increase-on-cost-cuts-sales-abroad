  Enel SpA (ENEL) , Italy’s biggest energy
company, said profit will rise 31 percent in the next five years
as the company reduces debt and increases sales abroad.  Enel forecast net ordinary income of 4.5 billion euros
($6.3 billion) in 2011, 4.9 billion in 2013 and 5.8 billion in
2015, from 4.4 billion euros in 2010, according to a statement
through the Italian exchange today. The Rome-based company also
said it had met its 2010 net debt target of 45 billion euros.  Enel, which became  Europe ’s most-indebted power company
after the purchase of Spain’s  Endesa SA (ELE) , has cut costs and sold
assets to improve its finances. The company said 2010 sales in
Latin America,  Russia  and Romania increased, helping to offset
weaker results at its market division and generation and energy
management division.  The power generator also posted a 21 percent decline in
2010 net income after an increase in financing expenses and a
decline in financial income after a one-time gain wasn’t
repeated.  In the next five years, Enel said it plans to invest around
31 billion euros and to continue to dispose of non-core assets.
The company proposed a dividend of 0.28 euros per share.  Analysts at Mediobanca today confirmed their outperform
rating on Enel shares.  The company reiterated its intention to invest in nuclear
energy in Italy as part of the country’s return to nuclear power
two decades after a referendum led to the dismantling of
reactors. Enel serves 61 million customers in 23 countries and
produces 72 percent of its energy outside of  Italy .  To contact the reporter on this story:
