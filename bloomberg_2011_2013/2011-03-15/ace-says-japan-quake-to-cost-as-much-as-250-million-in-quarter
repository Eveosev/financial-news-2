  Ace Ltd. (ACE) , the insurer that has
offices in more than 50 countries, said last week’s earthquake
in  Japan  will reduce earnings by $200 million to $250 million in
the first quarter.  “The loss estimates for the Japanese earthquake event are
preliminary, given details are still unfolding,” the Zurich-
based insurer said today in a statement distributed by  Business
