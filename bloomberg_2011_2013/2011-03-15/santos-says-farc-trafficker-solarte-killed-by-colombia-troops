Colombian troops killed Oliver
Solarte, one of the Andean nation’s biggest drug traffickers,
in southern Putumayo province, President  Juan Manuel Santos  said
in a  statement .  Solarte, a commander of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of
Colombia, known as the FARC, was considered by Colombian
intelligence as the drug-funded group’s chief contact with
Mexican drug cartels, Santos said in the e-mailed statement.  “He managed all of the drug and arms trafficking for the
southern block of the FARC,” Santos said.  Santos, who took office in August, has weakened Latin
America’s oldest guerrilla group with military strikes that in
September killed Mono Jojoy, the rebels’ military chief and
second-in-command.  As defense minister under former President Alvaro Uribe
from 2006 to 2008, Santos oversaw the rescue of 15 rebel-held
hostages, including French-Colombian politician  Ingrid Betancourt , and an air strike into Ecuador that killed  Raul Reyes , another top rebel commander.  To contact the reporter on this story:
