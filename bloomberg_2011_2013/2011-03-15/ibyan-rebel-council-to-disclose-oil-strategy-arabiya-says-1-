  Libya ’s rebel council, which France
recognizes as the OPEC country’s legitimate government, will
announce a strategy for the  energy industry  within days, Ali
Tarhuni, the council’s oil adviser, told Al Arabiya television.  Oil and natural-gas resources in eastern Libya “will be
channeled to support the battle for liberation,” Tarhuni said
in the interview broadcast today.  While priority will be given to new oil and gas agreements,
the Benghazi-based Interim National Council will respect
contracts already signed with foreign companies, he said.
Tarhuni is a member of the council’s consultative committee for
economy and energy.  Eastern Libya is home to most of the country’s 44.3 billion
barrels in oil reserves, the largest in  Africa , according to BP
Plc’s Statistical Review of World Energy. These eastern reserves
have come under the control of rebels demanding an end to leader
Muammar Qaddafi’s four-decade rule, following mass
demonstrations that began on Feb. 17.  The opposition, which the council represents, claims
territory stretching from the North African country’s border
with Egypt to an area east of Brega, an oil hub along the
central coast.  Libya’s crude output has dropped by an estimated 1.3
million barrels a day because of the conflict, the Paris-based  International Energy Agency  said today in its monthly Oil Market
Report. The country produced 1.385 million barrels a day in
February, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
