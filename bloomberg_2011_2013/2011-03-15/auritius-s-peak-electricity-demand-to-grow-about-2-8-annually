Mauritius’s peak electricity demand
will probably grow at about 2.8 percent a year to reach 533
megawatts by 2020, said Shyam Thanoo, the Central Electricity
Board’s officer-in-charge.  The Indian Ocean island nation’s demand for power rose to
404 megawatts last year, Thanoo said in an e-mailed response to
questions today.  The state-owned company, based in Curepipe, about 20
kilometers (12.5 miles) south of the capital  Port Louis ,
generates 45 percent of Mauritius’s electricity and is
responsible for distribution. It plans to spend 2.7 billion
rupees ($93 million) to install four new diesel generators at
one of its plants, Thanoo said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
