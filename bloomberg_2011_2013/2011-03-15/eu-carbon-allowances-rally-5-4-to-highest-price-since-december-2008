European Union carbon permits
surged to their highest price since December 2008 after  Germany 
said it will halt its seven oldest nuclear reactors, increasing
demand for replacement power from fossil fuels.   EU permits for December jumped as much as 5.4 percent to
17.49 euros ($24.30) a metric ton on the ICE Futures Europe
exchange in  London . They were at 17.48 euros as of 12:48 p.m.   To contact the reporter on this story:
