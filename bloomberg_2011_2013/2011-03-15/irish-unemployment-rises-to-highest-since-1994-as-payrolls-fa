Irish payrolls fell an annual 3.4
percent in the fourth quarter, led by the  construction industry ,
pushing the  unemployment rate  to the highest since 1994.  The number of people in work declined to 1.823 million
people, and the jobless rate rose to 14.1 percent from 13.9
percent in the previous three months, the  Central Statistics
Office  said in a  report  released in Dublin today. The payrolls
decline was the smallest since the third quarter of 2008.  Prime Minister  Enda Kenny , who took power last week, has
said creating jobs is his priority as he seeks to revive
economic growth after a recession that cost jobs at drugmakers,
banks and builders and led to the near collapse of the financial
system. Jobs in the building industry plunged 19.6 percent in
the fourth quarter from a year earlier, while employment in the
financial and real-estate sector dropped 8.3 percent.  Employment in 10 of 14 economic sectors fell in the fourth
quarter, today’s report showed. There were small increases in
the number of jobs in education, retail and transport.  On a seasonally adjusted basis, the jobless rate in the
fourth quarter rose to 14.7 percent from 13.7 percent.
Unemployment has more than doubled since 2008 as the country’s
10-year property boom burst, saddling banks with bad loans.  The number of people unemployed for a year or more
accounted for 52 percent of the total without jobs in the fourth
quarter. That’s the first time since the late 1990s that long-
term unemployed exceeded those out of work for less than a year,
according to the statistics office. Construction employment has
fallen 109,900, or almost 60 percent, since its peak in the
second quarter of 2007.  To contact the reporter on this story:
