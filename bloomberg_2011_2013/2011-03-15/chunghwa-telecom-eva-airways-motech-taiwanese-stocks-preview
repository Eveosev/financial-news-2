Stocks of the following companies
had unusual moves in Taiwan trading. Stock symbols are in
parentheses and prices are as of 1:30 p.m. close.  The Taiex Index fell 285.24, or 3.4 percent, to 8,234.78,
the lowest level since Oct. 22. The gauge closed almost 10
percent below its high this year on Jan. 28.    Unimicron Technology Corp. (3037)  (3037 TT) and  Kinsus
Interconnect Technology Corp. (3189)  (3189 TT) both slid by the 7
percent daily limit, the most since May 21, on speculation they
may face a shortage of components following the earthquake in  Japan , said Bonny Weng, an analyst at KGI Securities Co.  Unimicron slumped to NT$48, while Kinsus dropped to
NT$83.70. The quake has no major impact on the two companies’
operations and they are monitoring their imports of raw
materials from Japan, they said in separate exchange statements
yesterday.    EVA Airways Corp. (2618)  (2618 TT) slid 6.9 percent to NT$22.95,
the most since May 12, 2009. Taiwan’s second-largest carrier
expected a 10 percent decline in passengers to and from Japan
for the next “few days,” EVA said in an e-mailed reply to
questions. The carrier said it didn’t expect a major impact on
cargo.    Motech Industries Inc. (6244)  (6244 TT) gained 4.3 percent to
NT$122.50, the most since Feb. 24. The island’s largest solar-
cell maker will form a venture with  Green Energy Technology Inc. (3519) 
(3519 TT) and Taiwan Poly-Silicon Corp. to produce polysilicon
wafers, Motech said in a statement to the stock exchange
yesterday. Green Energy was unchanged at NT$151.  Young Fast Optoelectronics Co. (3622 TT) slumped 7 percent
to NT$207, the lowest level since April 6, 2009. The maker of
touch screens was cut to “reduce” from “neutral” at Nomura
Holdings Inc., which cited a “rapid decline” in demand for so-
called resistive touch. The brokerage lowered its share-price
forecast to NT$197 from NT$346, analysts led by Anne Lee wrote
in a report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
