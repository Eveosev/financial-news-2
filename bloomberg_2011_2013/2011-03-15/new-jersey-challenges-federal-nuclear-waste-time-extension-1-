New Jersey challenged the U.S.  Nuclear Regulatory Commission ’s extension of the time allowed
for storing spent nuclear fuel at power plants to 60 years from
30, saying the agency failed to consider health and safety
risks.  Governor  Chris Christie  today asked the U.S. appeals court
in Washington for permission to join a lawsuit brought last
month by  New York , Vermont and Connecticut. The states claim the
government didn’t produce an environmental impact statement
before changing the standard.  “The federal government has an obligation to develop a
permanent plan for nuclear waste storage, and cannot avoid an
answer by extending the time that radioactive waste is allowed
to remain on sites in New Jersey and across the nation,” Bob
Martin, commissioner of the  New Jersey  Environmental Protection
Department, said in an e-mailed statement.  The 60-year rule would apply to waste generated at four
reactors in New Jersey, the statement said. They are Oyster
Creek in Lacey Township, Hope Creek in Lower Alloways Creek, and
two units at the Salem Nuclear Generating Station, also in Lower
Alloways Creek.  The Oyster Creek site is schedule to close in 2020,
according to court papers.  The Nuclear Regulatory Commission published the rule change
on Dec. 23.  Nana Efua Embil, a Justice Department spokeswoman, didn’t
immediately return a telephone call seeking comment.  The case is New York v. U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission,
11-1045, U.S. Court of Appeals for the  District of Columbia 
(Washington).  To contact the reporter on this story:
