Qihoo 360 Technology Co., the
Chinese security software maker that had a dispute with  Tencent
Holdings Ltd. (700) , is seeking as much as $200 million from a U.S.
initial public offering to boost product development.  The proposed share sale is expected to take place in the
first quarter, Beijing-based Qihoo 360 said in a regulatory
filing to the Securities and Exchange Commission yesterday. UBS
AG and Citigroup Inc. are managing the offering, it said.  Tencent,  China ’s biggest Internet company, in November
asked users of its QQ instant messaging service to uninstall
software made by Qihoo 360 after a dispute involving products
offered by the companies. The conflict initially led to a loss
of users at Qihoo 360 before subscriber numbers “quickly”
recovered to prior levels, according to the filing.  A product made by Qihoo 360 disrupted the malware-detection
features of QQ, Tencent said in November. The dispute was the
biggest crisis faced by Tencent, Ma Huateng, chairman at the
Shenzhen, south China-based company, said at the time.  Tencent filed an unfair competitive practices claim against
Qihoo 360 in a court in Beijing in October, before the company
sued Tencent for defamation in another court in the city,
according to the filing. Both cases are pending.  Qihoo 360’s “360 Safe Guard” had 301 million monthly
active users as of January, according to the regulatory filing.
The company will use proceeds from the proposed IPO for research
and development, as well as possible acquisitions, it said.  Qihoo 360 had net income of $8.5 million last year from
$57.7 million in sales. It competes with Tencent in the market
for online advertising and Internet value-added services,
according to the filing.  To contact the reporter on this story:  Mark Lee  in  Hong Kong  at
