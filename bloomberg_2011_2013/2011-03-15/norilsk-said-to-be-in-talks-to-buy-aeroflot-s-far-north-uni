OAO GMK Norilsk Nickel, the world’s
largest nickel producer, is in talks to buy a unit of Russian
carrier OAO Aeroflot to transport workers to and from remote
production sites, said three people familiar with the matter.  Norilsk is seeking to acquire 100 percent of Nordavia,
which operates flights between Moscow and Arkhangelsk and
Murmansk, said the people, who declined to be identified because
the talks are private.  Erzhena Mintasova, a spokeswoman for Norilsk, declined to
comment, as did Aeroflot spokesman Andrey Sogrin. Norilsk
already has its own airline, Nordstar, which operates flights
between Norilsk’s headquarters in the Arctic and Moscow.  Nordavia carried 1.4 million passengers last year on 15
Boeing Co. 737s and four Antonov An-24s, making it the country’s
16th largest carrier.  To contact the reporter on this story:
