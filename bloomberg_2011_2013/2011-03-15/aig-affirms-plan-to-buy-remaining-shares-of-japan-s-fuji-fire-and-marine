  American International Group Inc. (AIG) ,
the bailed-out U.S. insurer, affirmed its commitment to buying
the shares of Fuji Fire and Marine Insurance Co. that it doesn’t
already own.  “We have been doing business in  Japan  since 1946 and remain
strongly committed to its people,” said Mark Herr, a spokesman
for New York-based AIG, in an e-mail today. “We also remain
committed to the Fuji transaction.”  Fuji Fire fell to 139 yen today in Tokyo on speculation AIG
wouldn’t follow through with its plan to pay 146 yen. Prior to
last week’s earthquake in Japan, the insurer had closed every
day within one yen of AIG’s offer since it was announced in
early February.  AIG’s Chartis unit owned about 55 percent of Fuji Fire as
of Feb. 10. The company said that day it would pay about 47
billion yen ($569 million) to acquire the rest by March 24.  To contact the reporters on this story:
