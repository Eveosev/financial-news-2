Japanese Finance Minister  Yoshihiko Noda  said the plunge in the stock market may be
temporary and currency and bond markets are “relatively calm”
since the country’s most powerful earthquake struck last week.  “I will continue to monitor closely developments in the
stock market as it’s declining on temporary factors” such as
the impact of the quake and concerns about damage to a nuclear
plant, Noda said at a news conference in  Tokyo  today.  Nikkei 225 Stock Average futures contracts traded in  Singapore  plunged 12 percent after Prime Minister  Naoto Kan  said
the risks to public health stemming from the crippled nuclear
plant in Fukushima, northern Japan, are increasing. Noda said
it’s too early to determine the size of an economic package in
response to the disaster and he pledged to seek fiscal
discipline given the country’s record debt.  The government will consider fiscal goals　“after we
measure the quake’s impact, how much spending it will require
and how we will secure funds,” Noda said. “We shouldn’t forget
that markets and some people at home and abroad are closely
watching how  Japan  charts a course toward fiscal health.”  The Topix fell 7 percent at the lunch break in Tokyo,
before Kan spoke, to 787.90, heading for the lowest close since
March 31, 2009. The yen was little changed against the dollar,
trading at 81.59 at 11:44 a.m. in Tokyo. The yield on Japan’s
10-year bond fell 3.5 basis points to 1.165 percent as investors
sought the relative safety of the securities.  To contact the reporter on this story:
