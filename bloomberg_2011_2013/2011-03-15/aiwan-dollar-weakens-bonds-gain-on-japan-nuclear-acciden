Taiwan’s dollar fell and  government
bonds  gained, pushing benchmark 10-year yields to the lowest in
four months, as  Japan ’s earthquake and nuclear accident prompted
investors to favor less-risky assets.  The currency fell for a third time in four days as global
funds sold $390 million more local shares than they bought
today, exchange data showed. The government sold NT$40 billion
($1.4 billion) of 10-year bonds at 1.381 percent yesterday, the
second-lowest yield paid at an auction for debt of that
maturity, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  “Taiwan bonds are in high demand as seen at yesterday’s
auction,” said Eric Hsing, a debt trader at First Securities
Inc. in Taipei. “The nuclear accident in Japan has caused a lot
of uncertainty, especially when  Taiwan  is so close to the
country.”  Taiwan’s dollar closed 0.2 percent weaker at NT$29.559
against its U.S. counterpart as of 4 p.m. local time, according
to Taipei Forex Inc. Tokyo Electric Power Co.’s stricken nuclear
power plant was today rocked by two further explosions and a
fire as workers struggled to avert the risk of a meltdown.  The yield on Taiwan’s 1.375 percent bond due March 2021
fell five basis points, the most since Dec. 30, to 1.326 percent
as of the 1:30 p.m. close, according to Gretai Securities
Market. That was the lowest rate for a benchmark 10-year
security since Nov. 16.  To contact the reporter on this story:
