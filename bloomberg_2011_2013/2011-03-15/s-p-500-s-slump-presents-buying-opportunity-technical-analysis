The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index’s
decline since Feb. 18 presents a buying opportunity because the
pullback will be “modest,” according to Bank of America
Corp.’s Mary Ann Bartels.  The  S&P 500  has “key” support at 1,270, and “there is no
technical evidence to suggest an end to the cyclical bull-market
rally that began in March 2009,” Bartels, the head of U.S.
technical analysis, said. The benchmark gauge for U.S. stocks
fell 1.1 percent to 1,281.87 in  New York  after sinking as much
as 2.7 percent earlier.  “We continue to believe that this will be a modest
pullback and a buying opportunity,” Bartels wrote in a note
dated yesterday. “The U.S. equity market remains resilient
despite ongoing concerns about the European periphery, Middle
East, higher crude  oil prices  and fears of global economic
growth slowing.”  The S&P 500 rallied 99 percent from its March 2009 low
through Feb. 18, boosted by positive corporate earnings,
improving economic data and asset purchases by the  Federal
Reserve  intended to stoke growth. The index fell 3.5 percent
through yesterday as unrest in the Middle East and northern
Africa threatened to limit the supply of oil and a 9.0-magnitude
earthquake and subsequent tsunami in  Japan  raised uncertainty
about the health of the third-largest economy.  Technical analysts study charts of trading patterns and
prices to predict changes in a security, commodity, currency or
index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
