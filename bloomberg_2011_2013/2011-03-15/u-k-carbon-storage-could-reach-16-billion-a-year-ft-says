Initiatives to collect carbon
dioxide emissions and store them beneath the  North Sea  could
generate 13,000 jobs in  Scotland  and a further 14,000 elsewhere
in the U.K. within the next nine years, the Financial Times
reported, citing a report issued by the Scottish government
yesterday.  The U.K.â€™s share of the carbon capture market could reach a
value of more than 10 billion pounds ($16 billion) a year by
2025, the FT said, citing Scottish Carbon Capture and Storage,
an Edinburgh-based research group.  To contact the reporter on this story:
