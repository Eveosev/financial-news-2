The  National Bank of Belgium  may
propose Mathias Dewatripont and Pierre Wunsch as directors to
replace Luc Coene and Peter Praet,  Le Soir  reported, without
saying where it got the information.  The Belgian government would need to approve the
nominations, according to the newspaper. Coene is set to replace
Guy Quaden as head of the central bank, while Praetâ€™s
appointment to the executive board of the  European Central Bank 
will free up another board seat at the bank, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
