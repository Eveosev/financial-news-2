Sixth Avenue Electronics City Inc. ,
with more than 15 locations in  New York , New Jersey,
Pennsylvania and  Delaware , was sued by a financing affiliate of  General Electric Co. (GE)  seeking to collect $9.6 million in debt.  GE Commercial Distribution Finance Corp. contends it
provided inventory financing for Springfield, New Jersey-based
Sixth Avenue beginning in 2007, and that the electronics
retailer is in default of payments.  “Borrower has failed and refused to remit the past-due
payments,” and GE “is lawfully entitled to possession of the
inventory,” GE lawyers said in a complaint filed yesterday in
federal court in Wilmington, Delaware.  A company spokesman, William Pereira, said in an e-mailed
message that Sixth Avenue has no comment “at this time.”  The company was started by members of the Temiz family on
Sixth Avenue in New York in 1984, according to its website. The
business later expanded into  New Jersey , Long Island, New York,
and the Philadelphia area.  Billy Temiz, one of the company’s founders, ran a chain of
high-fashion boutiques in Istanbul in the 1970s before moving to
the U.S. and turning to electronics, according to the website.  The case is Capital Solutions v. Sixth Avenue Electronics
City Inc., 11cv219, U.S. District Court, District of Delaware
(Wilmington).  To contact the reporter on this story:
