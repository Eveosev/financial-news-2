(Corrects Kan’s comment in first paragraph.)  Japanese Prime Minister  Naoto Kan 
said the risks of further radiation leaks are increasing after
an explosion at a nuclear power plant in Fukushima.  Citizens living within a 30-kilometer (19 miles) radius of
Tokyo Electric Power Co.’s Daiichi plant should stay indoors,
Kan said during a nationally televised press conference.  To contact the reporter on this story:
