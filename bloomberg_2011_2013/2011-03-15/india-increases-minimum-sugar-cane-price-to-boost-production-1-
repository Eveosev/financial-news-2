  India , the biggest sugar consumer,
raised the minimum price mills must pay cane growers as it seeks
to increase production, said a government official.  Farmers will receive at least 145 rupees per 100 kilograms
(220 pounds) in the year starting Oct. 1, from a 139.12 rupees
in the 2010-2011 season, the official said in  New Delhi , asking
not to be identified as he’s not allowed to speak to the media.  Higher output may leave the second-biggest producer with
more sweetener to sell overseas. Raw sugar prices in New York
have jumped 36 percent in the past year on concern that global
production may lag behind rising demand.  India’s output in the season that began Oct. 1, 2010, may
exceed 25 million metric tons,  Narendra Murkumbi , president of
the  Indian Sugar Mills Association , said March 10. This compares
with 24.5 million tons forecast by the government, and an output
of 18.9 million tons in the previous season.  To contact the reporter on this story:
