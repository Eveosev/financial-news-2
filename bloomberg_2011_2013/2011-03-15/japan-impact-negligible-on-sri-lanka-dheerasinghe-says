Central Bank of  Sri Lanka  Deputy
Governor Dharma Dheerasinghe comments on the impact on the South
Asian island’s economy from the March 11 earthquake and tsunami
in  Japan . Dheerasinghe spoke in a telephone interview from the
Sri Lankan capital, Colombo.  On trade, investment, aid and markets:  “As far as Sri Lanka is concerned, the impact is
negligible. The quake has not affected a large part of the
country and the Japanese administration and financial system
continues to operate.  ‘‘We are a net importer from Japan. But a lot of the
imports, including Japanese motor vehicles, are produced and
shipped from other countries. It is not a big export destination
for us.  ‘‘Japan is a large investor in Sri Lanka, but there is no
threat to it as this kind of disaster doesn’t have an impact on
Japan’s potential to invest outside of the country. They will
continue to do so.  ‘‘We have a lot of foreign-exchange dealings with Japan.
But our counterparties operate from various locations with
backup sites, and market activities continue uninterrupted with
little risk.  ‘‘We are also a big beneficiary of Japanese aid, but this
does not take place on a daily basis. I don’t see a threat to
this as the Japanese government is functioning.’’  To contact the reporter on this story:
