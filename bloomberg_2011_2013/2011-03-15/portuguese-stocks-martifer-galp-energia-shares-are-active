gauge’s fourth decline in five days.  The following are among the most active stocks in the
Portuguese market today.    Galp Energia SGPS SA (GALP)  , Portugal’s biggest oil
company, declined 2.2 percent to 15.01 euros. Crude oil dropped
to a two-week low in New York as investors speculated that

metal structures for stadiums and windmills, advanced 7.3
percent to 1.48 euros. Equipment manufacturers for solar power
and wind energy climbed for a second day on speculation that
