The Serbian opposition party of
former Premier Vojislav Kostunica handed over to the government
100,000 signatures collected to stop the sale of Telekom Srbija
AD, Beta news agency said.  The party, calling the phone company the “best resource  Serbia  has,” also asked the parliamentary speaker to call a
special session for lawmakers and the government to debate
“reasons and consequences” of the sale of a 51 percent stake
for at least 1.4 billion euros ($1.95 billion).  Trade unions plan a protest on March 19, asking the
president and the government to stop the sale, saying that
global crisis had pushed down prices of all assets around the
world and Telekom Srbija is worth “a lot more,” the president
of the company’s trade union, Slavoljub Kandic, said on March
10. The government has kept the bid submission date for March
21, giving potential buyers access to data room until March 20.  -- Editor: James M. Gomez  To contact the reporter on this story:
