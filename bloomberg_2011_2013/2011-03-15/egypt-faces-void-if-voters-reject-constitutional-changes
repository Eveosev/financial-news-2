  Egypt  faces a “legislative void”
if voters reject proposed constitutional changes in a referendum
this weekend, the head of the judicial committee supervising the
vote, Mohammed Attia, said today.  Egyptians will head to the polls on March 19 for the first
time since last month’s ouster of President  Hosni Mubarak  to
vote on amendments that would limit presidential terms and ease
restrictions on presidential candidates. A number of opposition
leaders have rejected the proposed changes, saying they don’t go
far enough in advancing democracy.  If voters reject the amendments, the country’s military
rulers would likely issue a decree outlining the next stages in
the political process, Attia told reporters in Cairo. “This
would be a constitutional declaration for a limited,
transitional period to allow for the transfer of authority to a
modern and civilian state,” he said.  Civil society organizations are welcome to observe the
referendum, Attia said. Elections under Mubarak were marred by
violence and numerous accusations of vote-rigging.  The ruling military council suspended the constitution
after it took interim authority from Mubarak.  To contact the reporter on this story:
