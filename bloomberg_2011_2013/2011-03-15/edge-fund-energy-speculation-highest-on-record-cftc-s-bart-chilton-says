  Hedge funds  and other speculators
have increased their positions in energy markets by 64 percent
since June 2008 to the highest level on record, according to
data released by U.S.  Commodity Futures Trading Commissioner 
Bart Chilton.  Speculative positions accounted for more than one million
energy futures equivalent contracts as of January, according to
the data. Positions in metals and agricultural contracts have
increased about 20 percent, Chilton said in a speech prepared
for delivery today at the  Annual Structured Trade and Export
Finance in the Americas Conference  in  Coral Gables ,  Florida .  Chilton said the data shows the need for the CFTC, as part
of the Dodd-Frank financial overhaul, to curb speculation on raw
materials such as oil, natural gas and wheat.  “We were given new authority to place limits on
speculation as part of the new financial reform law, but we
haven’t done that yet and we need to pronto,” he said in a
statement before the speech.  The CFTC missed the Dodd Frank Act’s mid-January deadline
to enact curbs on speculation. The commission voted Jan. 13 to
put out for comment a proposal that would restrict the number of
contracts one firm can hold. There is no schedule for the agency
to take a final vote on the rules.  CFTC Chairman  Gary Gensler  told lawmakers the commission
wouldn’t meet the deadline because it doesn’t yet have
sufficient data. The agency will begin collecting that
information in the third quarter of 2011, according to the
filing.  To contact the reporter on this story:
