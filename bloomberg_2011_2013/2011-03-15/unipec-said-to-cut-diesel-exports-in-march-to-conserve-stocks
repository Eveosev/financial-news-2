  China  International United
Petroleum & Chemical Corp., the nation’s biggest oil trader,
will cut diesel exports this month to conserve stockpiles, said
two company officials with knowledge of the plan.  Unipec, as China International is known, will ship two
cargoes totaling 70,000 metric tons compared with 80,000 tons
last month, said the officials, who declined to be identified
because they aren’t authorized to speak to the media. A cargo is
typically about 30,000 or 40,000 tons.  The trading company resumed diesel exports in February
after a two-month halt because of a shortage in China. Unipec
may ship as many as three cargoes in April, according to one of
the officials.    Huang Wensheng , a Beijing-based spokesman at Unipec’s
parent  China Petroleum & Chemical Corp. (600028) , declined to comment on
the diesel export plan.  China Petroleum, the country’s largest refiner known as
Sinopec, will maintain oil-product stockpiles at a
“reasonable” level in the second quarter to ensure stable
domestic supply, according to a company statement on March 10.  --Winnie Zhu. Editors: Ryan Woo, Clyde Russell.  To contact the reporter on this story:
