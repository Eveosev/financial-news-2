St. Ives Plc, a U.K. printing
company, lost money in its fiscal first half because of an
unprofitable unit.  The net loss in the 26 weeks to Jan. 28 was 10.3 million
pounds ($16.6 million) compared with a profit of 6.7 million
pounds in the year-earlier period, the London-based company said
in a Regulatory News Service statement today. Sales fell 1
percent to 149.4 million pounds.  St. Ives said yesterday that it’s agreed to sell its
magazine-printing business to Walstead Newco3 Ltd. for 20
million pounds. The total first-half loss from discontinued
operations widened to 19.2 million pounds, from 1.18 million
pounds a year earlier.  “We do not see an immediate improvement in the general
economic climate in this financial year and there remain some
significant structural and cyclical challenges,” Chief
Executive Patrick Martell said in the statement. “The proposed
disposal of the loss-making magazine printing business will
further strengthen the group’s financial performance.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
