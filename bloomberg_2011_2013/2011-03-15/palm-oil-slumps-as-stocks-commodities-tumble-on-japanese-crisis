  Palm oil  gained for the first time
in four days as investors bought the commodity after the price
tumbled to more than a three-month low on concern that the quake
and tsunami in  Japan  may shrink demand for raw materials.  The May-delivery contract climbed 1.5 percent to close at
3,385 ringgit ($1,103) a metric ton after sliding 2.6 percent to
3,250 ringgit, the lowest level since Nov. 26. Prices shed 8
percent last week amid prospects for higher output in Malaysia
and Indonesia, the top producers.  “It’s short-covering after the recent selloff,” said  Ben
Santoso , a plantation analyst at DBS Vickers Securities. “The
selloff was too fast as supply is still tight until production
comes out around April to May,” he said from  Singapore .  Asian stocks plummetted, with the Topix index posting its
worst two-day drop since 1987, and Japan’s default risk jumped
as Prime Minister  Naoto Kan  said the danger of further leaks
from a nuclear power plant damaged by the nation’s biggest quake
was increasing. Commodities including crude oil, gold, copper
and corn declined.  Today’s gain in palm oil may not be sustained because
“lots of supply will be coming to the market,” Arhnue Tan, a
senior investment analyst at ECM Libra Investment Bank, said by
telephone from  Kuala Lumpur .  Indonesia, the top palm-oil producer, may increase output
and shipments, the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Foreign
Agricultural Service said in a report yesterday. The country may
produce 25.4 million tons in the year that begins Oct. 1, from
an estimated 23.6 million in the current year. Exports may rise
to 19.35 million tons from 17.85 million tons, the agency said.  Malaysian Shipments  Malaysia’s production in February climbed 3.5 percent to
1,094,473 tons, the first gain after three months of declines.
Stockpiles rose 4.2 percent to 1,478,793 tons, the country’s
palm oil board said March 10. Exports fell 17 percent in the
first 15 days of March to 526,407 tons, surveyor Intertek said
today. Rival Societe Generale de Surveillance said shipments
fell 14.7 percent in the period.  May-delivery  soybean oil  gained 0.3 percent to 55.54 cents
a pound in  Chicago  at 5:08 p.m. in Singapore after falling as
much as 1.1 percent earlier. Soybeans for delivery in the same
month dropped 0.2 percent to $13.375 a bushel.  September-delivery palm oil on the  Dalian Commodity
Exchange  gained 0.8 percent to close at 9,058 yuan ($1,378).
Soybean oil for delivery in the same month added 0.6 percent to
9,940 yuan. CME Group Inc.’s most-active June palm-oil contract,
pegged to the Malaysian benchmark price, rose 2.5 percent to
$1,106 at 4:24 p.m. Singapore time.  To contact the reporter on this story:
