The  United Auto Workers  union will
hold its quadrennial bargaining convention in  Detroit  next week
to create its strategy for negotiating a new contract with U.S.
automakers.  UAW President  Bob King , who was elected the union’s leader
in June, will lead the convention from March 22 to March 24 at
the Cobo Center in Detroit, Michele Martin, a spokeswoman, said
today in an e-mail.  King, 64, will negotiate new contracts this year with  General Motors Co. (GM) ,  Ford Motor Co. (F)  and Chrysler Group LLC. While
the agreements don’t expire until September, King has said
workers must be rewarded for sacrifices they made to help the
automakers survive. He said UAW members each gave $7,000 to
$30,000 in concessions since 2005.  “All the sacrifices that our members made to turn these
companies around were part of the process that’s really led to
this amazing turnaround,” King said in a January interview.
“We want our membership to share in a very meaningful way in
the upside of these companies.”  To help the automakers survive, the union surrendered
raises, bonuses and cost-of-living adjustments. The UAW also
agreed to a two-tier wage system, in which new hires earn about
$14 an hour, half the amount paid to senior production workers.  GM, which reorganized in bankruptcy in 2009, earned $6.17
billion last year. Ford, the only major U.S. automaker to avoid
bankruptcy, had net income of $6.56 billion last year, the most
since 1999. Chrysler, which also reorganized in 2009, posted a
net loss of $652 million last year and forecast net income of as
much as $500 million this year.  King also is seeking to organize the U.S. factories of
Asian and German automakers such as  Toyota Motor Corp. (7203)  and  Daimler AG. (DAI)  King has said he expects to organize at least one
non-union automaker this year.  Through organizing and hiring at the U.S. automakers, King
has said he hopes this year to reverse the UAW’s three-decade
decline in membership. UAW membership has fallen to 355,000
members from a peak of 1.5 million in 1979.  To contact the reporter on this story:
