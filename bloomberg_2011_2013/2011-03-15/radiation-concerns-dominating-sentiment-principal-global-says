concern about the safety of  Japan ’s nuclear plants damaged by
the country’s worst earthquake on record.  Japan’s Topix index tumbled as much as 14 percent, its
worst intraday loss since the 1987 stock market crash, while the
MSCI Asia Pacific Index sank 7.5 percent:  On investor sentiment:  “There’s a panic that has crept in because of what’s
happening there. People are worried about the potential impact
of radiation and that is dominating sentiment at this point.  ‘‘As things get clearer, markets will settle down. You just
hope the danger doesn’t spread. If you do not have another day
of negative news of leaking radiation and such, things will
start settling down.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
