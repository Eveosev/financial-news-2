Yahoo! Inc. fell the most in almost
eight months in Nasdaq trading after  Yahoo Japan Corp. (4689) , its
joint venture in  Japan , declined on concern about the effects
last week’s earthquake will have on the nation’s economy.  Yahoo, which owns about one-third of Yahoo Japan, slid 98
cents, or 5.7 percent, to $16.33 at 4 p.m. New York time on the
Nasdaq Stock Market, the biggest drop since July 21. The shares
have lost 1.8 percent this year.  The owner of the largest U.S. Web portal derives about one-
fourth of its market value from Tokyo-based Yahoo Japan, which
it co-owns with Softbank Corp., said Clay Moran, an analyst at
Benchmark Co. Japan’s benchmark Nikkei 225 stock index posted
its biggest two-day drop since 1987 following the temblor and
three explosions at a stricken nuclear power plant.  “It’s certainly safe to say it’s the macro issues in
Japan,” said Moran, who is based in  Boca Raton , Florida. He has
a “hold” rating on Yahoo shares and doesn’t own any.  A secondary concern for investors may be how the situation
in Japan affects what Yahoo does with its stake in Yahoo Japan,
Moran said. Yahoo has held talks to dispose of the holding, two
people familiar with the matter said this month.  Yahoo Japan plunged 8.3 percent in Tokyo trading today, the
largest one-day drop in two years. That followed a 5.4 percent
decline yesterday.  Yahoo, based in Sunnyvale, California, gets about one-third
of its after-tax earnings from Yahoo Japan,  Jordan Rohan , an
analyst at Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., said today in a research
note.  To contact the reporter on this story:
