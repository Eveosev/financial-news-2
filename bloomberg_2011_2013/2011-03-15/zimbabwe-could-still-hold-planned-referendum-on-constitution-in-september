Zimbabwe may still hold a
referendum on a new constitition in September even though the
process is behind schedule, said Munyaradzi Mangwana, a co-
chairman of the country’s inter-party parliamentary committee.  “We lost one month but still think it’s possible,”
Mangwana told reporters today in Harare, the capital. ‘‘When we
came up with September, we took the shortage of funds into
account, so we should still be able to meet the deadline.’’  A constitution must be agreed to before elections can take
place, according to a power-sharing agreement between President  Robert Mugabe ’s Zimbabwe African National Union-Patriotic Front
and Prime Minister  Morgan Tsvangirai ’s Movement for Democratic
Change.  To contact the reporter on this story:
