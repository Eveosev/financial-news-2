The yen rose against all of its 16
major counterparts as Japan’s Prime Minister  Naoto Kan  said the
danger of further radiation leaks from a crippled nuclear power
station is increasing, boosting speculation domestic investors
will repatriate overseas assets.  The dollar advanced as a safe haven as Kan appealed for
calm in a televised address and said his government was doing
its utmost to contain the radioactive leak at Tokyo Electric
Power Co.’s Fukushima Dai-Ichi plant following last week’s
earthquake and tsunami. The greenback also rose versus most of
its peers before reports this week forecast to show an expansion
in industrial production.  “The developments in Japan are clearly yen-positive
because you have the normal reaction of Japanese investors
taking money home,” said  Thomas Harr , Singapore-based head of
Asian foreign-exchange strategy at Standard Chartered Plc. “The
dollar is benefiting against emerging-market currencies because
it’s a safe haven.”  The Japanese currency advanced 0.3 percent to 113.94 per
euro as of 11:57 a.m. in  Tokyo . The yen was little changed at
81.61 yen per dollar. The dollar rose to $1.3949 per euro from
$1.3992 in  New York  yesterday.  To contact the reporters on this story:
