  Lesotho , the mountainous African
kingdom, said it’s considering investments from textile
companies that are threatening to close down factories in South
Africa because of an increased minimum wage.  The Lesotho National Development Corp. is studying
applications from 380 companies which are considering moving to
Lesotho or Swaziland, said Lesa Makhoalibe, an official at the
investment agency, in an e-mailed response to questions today.  “Any kind of  job creation  is an advantage to the country,
especially in the labor intensive clothing and textile sector,”
she said. Lesotho will have to be “very selective” about which
investments is approves because it doesn’t have the
infrastructure to accommodate a large number of companies, she
wrote.  Some Chinese and Taiwanese-owned factories at Newcastle, in  South Africa ’s KwaZulu-Natal province, temporarily halted
operations last year amid a dispute over minimum wages. Both
Lesotho and Swaziland, which border South Africa, rely on income
from a regional customs union for the bulk of their budget
revenue.  While the factories will have to meet Lesotho’s minimum
wage standards, the country has lower cost structures than South
Africa, Makhoalibe said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
