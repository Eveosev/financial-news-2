Cephalon Inc., maker of the
painkiller Fentora, asked a federal judge to block the sale of a
competitor’s generic version of the drug, alleging it is
potentially dangerous.  The drugmaker sued the U.S. government today in federal
court in  Washington  seeking to revoke the Food and Drug
Administration’s approval of the generic, made by  Watson
Pharmaceuticals Inc. (WPI) , saying the product contains “a novel salt
form” never approved by the agency.  “Barring an injunction, FDA’s actions will usher into the
marketplace a generic drug of untested safety and efficacy,”
Cephalon, based in Frazer,  Pennsylvania , said in its complaint.  The FDA lawsuit was filed four days after a federal judge
msgin Delaware ruled the generic made by Corona, California-
based Watson didn’t infringe on two patents exclusively licensed
to Cephalon.  Cephalon sued Watson for patent infringement in June 2008
after the California company filed applications to produce the
generic form of the drug. Watson is barred from selling the
generic until U.S. District Judge Sue Robinson rules on a third
patent being challenged.  Cephalon said a ruling on that patent is “imminent.”  Karen Riley, an FDA spokeswoman, said the agency doesn’t
comment on pending litigation. A phone call to the investor
relations department at Watson Pharmaceuticals wasn’t
immediately returned.  The case is  Cephalon Inc. (CEPH)  v. Sebelius, 11-cv-00542, U.S.
District Court,  District of Columbia  (Washington).  To contact the reporter on this story:
