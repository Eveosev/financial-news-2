Oilseed meal shipments from  India 
to Japan, the South Asian nation’s biggest market for the feed,
will likely slow as demand wanes after last week earthquake and
tsunami, according to a processors’ group.  “There may be a temporary setback for about a month but
ultimately they have to buy from us to make poultry feed,” B.V.
Mehta, executive director of  Solvent Extractors’ Association ,
said in a telephone interview. “The loss in sales now will be
covered up later.”  Japan’s imports of meals made from soybeans and rapeseed
from India more than doubled to 1.1 million metric tons in the
11 months ended Feb. 28, from 426,775 tons in the year-earlier
period, according to the group. Shipments may not be less than
400,000 tons this month, compared with 400,000 tons to 500,000
tons expected previously, even if demand from  Japan  cools,
according to the  Soybean Processors Association of India .  Zen-Noh, Japan’s top corn buyer, yesterday said operations
to unload U.S. corn at Kashima and other northern ports were
suspended because of power outages. The Asian country is the
biggest buyer of U.S. corn, second-biggest buyer of wheat and
third-largest purchaser of American soybeans. The March 11
temblor caused an estimated 10,000 deaths, shutting down power
plants, factories and oil refineries.  “The concern right now is we don’t know what will happen
to ships that are on the way,” said Rajesh Agrawal, a spokesman
for the soyabean association. “We are waiting for the situation
to normalize.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
