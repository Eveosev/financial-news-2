German stocks advanced for the
first time in six days amid speculation that a 10 percent slide
in stocks in the past month has left markets underestimating the
outlook for economic and earnings growth.  Munich Re, the world’s largest reinsurer, climbed 2.5
percent as Bank of America Corp. upgraded the shares following
an 11 percent five-day slump through yesterday.  SAP AG (SAP)  fell 1
percent as the world’s biggest business software company
suspended operations from its office in  Tokyo  in the wake of the
earthquake.  The benchmark  DAX Index (DAX)  rose 44.34, or 0.7 percent, to
6,692 at 1:28 p.m. in  Frankfurt , having earlier swung between
gains and losses. The gauge had tumbled 10 percent from this
year’s high on Feb. 18 through yesterday amid concern that
higher  oil prices  prompted by Arab revolts would curb global
economic growth and as  Japan ’s Prime Minister  Naoto Kan  said the
danger of further radiation leaks from the earthquake-damaged
Fukushima plant had increased. The broader HDAX Index today
gained 0.5 percent.  “The worldwide economic recovery remains on track and we
expect markets to recover, once the true local impact of this
tragedy becomes clearer,” said Lothar Mentel, who oversees
about $3.2 billion as the London-based chief investment officer
at Octopus Investments Ltd.    Munich Re  advanced 2.5 percent to 107.90 euros. BofA
Merrill Lynch said the price decline is overdone and the shares
have the potential to rally 40 percent in the next 12 months, as
the broker upgraded the shares to “neutral.”  SAP, E.ON  SAP retreated 1 percent to 40.08 euros, the biggest drop
among companies in the DAX.    ADVA AG Optical Networking (ADV)  rallied 13 percent to 6.05
euros. The company may be taken over or merged with its partner  Juniper Networks Inc. (JNPR) , DAF Deutsches Anleger Fernsehen reported,
citing an interview with ADVA’s Chief Executive Officer Brian Protiva.    E.ON AG (EOAN) ,  Germany ’s largest utility, gained 3.2 percent to
21.93 euros, rebounding from a two-day slump.    Gildemeister AG (GIL)  rose 6.6 percent to 15.28 euros as the
German maker of cutting tools said it will raise some 83 million
euros by selling 4.56 million new shares to Japan’s Mori Seiki
Co.  To contact the reporter on this story:
