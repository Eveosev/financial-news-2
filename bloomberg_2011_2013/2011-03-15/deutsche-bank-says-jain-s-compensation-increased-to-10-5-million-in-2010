  Deutsche Bank AG (DBK) ,  Germany ’s biggest
bank, said Anshu Jain earned more than Chief Executive Officer  Josef Ackermann  last year after his corporate and investment
banking unit reported record revenue.  Jain, 48, was paid about 12 million euros ($16.7 million)
in salary, upfront and deferred bonuses and benefits, the
Frankfurt-based company said in its full-year  financial report 
today. Ackermann, 63, was paid 8.99 million euros last year,
compared with 9.55 million euros in 2009.  Jain, a potential successor to Ackermann who took over as
sole head of the corporate and investment bank in July, boosted
net revenue at the unit to a record 20.9 billion euros ($29
billion) last year, or 73 percent of the group total. Global
banks are under pressure from lawmakers and the public to show
restraint on pay after some lenders received taxpayer bailouts
during the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression.  Deutsche Bank’s entire management board earned 45.6 million
euros last year, up from 2009. Net income fell 54 percent to 2.3
billion euros last year on costs related to the takeover of
retail lender Deutsche Postbank AG. The company, which didn’t
require government aid, aims to double pretax profit at its
operating businesses to 10 billion euros this year from 2009
levels.    Barclays Plc (BARC)  gave Robert Diamond as much as 10.1 million
pounds ($16.5 million) in salary, bonuses and stock, making him
the U.K.’s top-paid bank CEO. This included a 6.5 million-pound
bonus for 2010 and a further 2.25 million pounds depending on
the lender’s performance, the bank said last week.  Dimon, Blankfein  UBS AG,  Switzerland ’s biggest bank, cut compensation for
investment-banking head Carsten Kengeter by 29 percent in 2010
after the unit’s earnings slumped in the second half of the
year. Kengeter, 43, received 9.32 million Swiss francs ($10.1
million), including a base salary of 874,626 francs, the Zurich-
based bank said in its annual report today. He was the highest-
paid member of the executive board for the second consecutive
year after getting 13.2 million francs in 2009.    Jamie Dimon , CEO of  JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) , was awarded $17.4
million in restricted stock for 2010, according to a Feb. 17
filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.  Goldman
Sachs Group Inc. (GS) , the securities firm that set a Wall Street pay
record in 2007, gave Chairman and CEO Lloyd Blankfein a $12.6
million stock bonus for 2010.  Deutsche Bank Shares  It’s not unusual for investment banking heads to earn more
than company chief executives. Diamond of Barclays, when he was
still head of the investment bank, earned more than then-CEO
John Varley, and  HSBC Holdings Plc (HSBA) ’s Stuart Gulliver earned more
when he was head of the bank’s securities unit than then-CEO  Michael Geoghegan .    Bank of America Corp. (BAC)  gave $15.2 million in bonuses to its
investment banking chief Thomas K. Montag, a reward 68 percent
bigger than that of his boss, CEO  Brian T. Moynihan , it reported
in February.  Deutsche Bank shares fell 13 percent in Frankfurt trading
in 2010, while the Bloomberg  Europe  Banks and Financial Services
Index of 48 financial companies declined 9.5 percent.  Ackermann earned less than his counterpart Martin Winterkorn at Volkswagen AG, Europe’s biggest carmaker, who had
compensation of 9.33 million euros in fixed salary, bonuses and
profit incentives.  Variable Pay  Deutsche Bank’s 81,702 employees, which excluded acquired
retail lender  Deutsche Postbank AG (DPB) , received total compensation
of 10.2 billion euros last year, 42 percent of which was
variable pay, according to the company’s  remuneration report .  Under new compensation rules, Deutsche Bank also published
pay for so-called “regulated employees,” which it defined as
168 people whose work has a “major influence” on overall risks
at the firm, such as top management, division executives and
certain investment bankers.  Those employees earned 655.7 million euros last year, 90
percent of which was variable pay that includes upfront and
deferred awards as well as money that can be clawed back, the
company said. The corporate and investment bank had 129
employees that received 536.2 million euros in pay, including
494.5 million euros in bonuses.  Deutsche Bank didn’t provide comparative figures for 2009.  To contact the reporter on this story:
