The Egyptian Museum issued a final
 list  of more than 50 ancient artifacts, including three gilded
wooden statues of King Tutankhamun, which are missing after
looters broke into the building in Cairo during anti-government
protests in January.  Small statues make up the majority of the 54 items listed,
which range from coral beads to a figure of the boy-pharaoh
throwing a harpoon. The list was compiled after checking
displays against the museum’s official registers, the
institution’s director, Tarek el-Awady, said in an e-mailed
statement today.  Egyptian archeologists appealed to the government last week
to protect the country’s tombs and storehouses from
looting following the revolution that ousted President  Hosni Mubarak  last month. Storage magazines were broken into,
including one belonging to the Metropolitan Museum of Art’s
expedition in Dahshur,  Zahi Hawass , the then antiquities
minister, said on March 3.  The black market in looted art and artifacts is worth as
much as $6.3 billion a year, according to  Global Financial
Integrity , a Washington-based group that promotes transparency
in international finance.  To contact the reporter on this story:
