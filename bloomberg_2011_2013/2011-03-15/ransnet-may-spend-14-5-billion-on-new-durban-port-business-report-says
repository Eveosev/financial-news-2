Transnet Ltd. may spend 100 billion
rand ($14.5 billion) building a new port in Durban,  South
Africa , Business Report said, citing Mafika Mkwanazi, the
chairman of the state-owned company.  Construction of the port may start in 2015 and its first
phase may be ready in 2019, the Johannesburg-based newspaper
said, citing Mkwanazi.  The container capacity of the facility will be 6 million
twenty-foot equivalent units, about twice the capacity of the
current port, the newspaper said. Transnet will seek private
participation in its construction, Business Report said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
