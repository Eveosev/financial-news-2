Japan’s March 11 earthquake may
help politicians come together in the wake of the crisis,
according to  Fitch Ratings .  “In the near term, it seems likely that the disaster will
break the gridlock in parliament over the issue of the
financing bill, which is near-term positive,”  Andrew Colquhoun ,
head of Asia-Pacific sovereigns at the credit-rating company,
said in an interview on Bloomberg Television today.  “But the impact on the longer-term debate over fiscal
consolidation” is still uncertain, he said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
