What follows are opening calls for
U.S. oilseed and grain markets.  -- Soybean futures may open 15 cents to 20 cents a bushel lower
on the Chicago Board of Trade on concern that the nuclear
disaster in  Japan  will reduce demand, said Alan Brugler, the
president of Brugler Marketing & Management LLC in Omaha,
Nebraska. Soybean-oil futures are expected to open 0.6 cent to
0.7 cent a pound lower, and soybean-meal futures may open down
$2 to $4 for 2,000 pounds of the  animal feed .  -- Wheat futures may open 18 cents to 22 cents a bushel lower on
the CBOT, the Kansas City Board of Trade and the  Minneapolis
Grain Exchange  as the earthquake and nuclear crisis in Japan
spurs concern that demand for raw materials, including
investment assets, will shrink, Brugler said.  -- Corn futures are called to open 10 cents to 15 cents a bushel
lower in  Chicago  as investors unwind bets on higher prices and
producers of ethanol, animal feed and food made from the grain
wait to increase purchases, Brugler said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
