(Corrects dates in second paragraph in story first
published on March 15.)  European Central Bank  Executive
Board member Gertrude Tumpel-Gugerell said a mandatory date
should be set for banks to adopt  Europe ’s common electronic
payments system as progress has been slower than anticipated.  The Single European Payments Area, or SEPA, “cannot be
deemed a full success,” Tumpel-Gugerell, who oversees payment
systems at the ECB, said in a speech in Stuttgart today.
European lawmakers should tell banks to migrate to SEPA credit
transfers “by the end of 2012” and to SEPA direct debits “by
the end of 2013,” she said.  SEPA enables customers to make euro payments across borders
within Europe using a single payment account and a single set of
payment instruments. Currently, 32 European countries are
participating in SEPA. More than 4,400 banks have joined the
SEPA credit transfer scheme, and more than 3,000 banks have
signed up for the direct debit scheme.  “There are a number of reasons why the SEPA implementation
has been slow,” Tumpel-Gugerell said. She cited “market
uncertainty, a difficult economic environment,” and
“resistance to migrate to the new system as long as there is no
binding and definitive end point.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
