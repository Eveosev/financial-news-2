Jet fuel in New York rose to a 29-
month high over heating oil futures amid tight supplies on the  Colonial Pipeline , the largest conduit delivering oil products
from Gulf Coast refiners to East Coast markets.  Deliveries to the U.S. Northeast and the Linden,  New
Jersey , storage hub “have been brisk,”  Steve Baker , a Colonial
spokesman, said in an e-mail. Colonial froze nominations for the
first three shipping cycles of 2011 and the line has been
allocated ever since, he said.  The premium for spot jet fuel versus futures traded on the
New York Mercantile Exchange at 1:58 p.m. rose 6 cents to 31
cents a gallon, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. It’s
the highest level since September 18, 2008. Prompt delivery
slipped 1.83 cents to $3.2955 a gallon.  Colonial also froze nominations between Greensboro,  North
Carolina , and Linden on line 3, which delivers jet fuel, for the
last two five-day shipping cycles of 2010, Baker said.  The premium for ultra-low-sulfur diesel versus Nymex
heating oil futures in the Gulf Coast increased 0.95 cent to 3.2
cents a gallon.  Petroleos de Venezuela, the state-owned oil company known
as PDVSA, reported no “major damage” to the Amuay refinery in
northwestern Venezuela after extinguishing a fire that broke out
today.  The fire started in the refinery’s HD4 hydroprocessing
unit, PDVSA said in a statement posted on its website. The plant
continues to process crude, and the distillation and conversion
units were unaffected by the fire, according to PDVSA.  To contact the reporter on this story:
