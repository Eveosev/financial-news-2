Rough diamond prices may surge more
than 25 percent this year driven by “almost insatiable” demand
from China,  India  and the U.S.,  Gem Diamonds Ltd. (GEMD)  said.  “Most people in the industry continue to be surprised by
the voracious appetite from the Chinese consumer for diamonds,”
Chief Executive Officer Clifford Elphick said in an interview.
“I would be surprised if we don’t achieve plus 25 percent.”  De Beers, the largest diamond miner by sales, said last
month it may raise output by 21 percent to full capacity by the
end of 2012 to meet “extraordinary” demand from China and
India. Global prices of rough, or unpolished, diamonds gained 26
percent last year, surpassing pre-recession highs, according to
data compiled by  WWW International Diamond Consultants Ltd.   The U.S. remains the biggest market for diamond jewelry,
buying about 38 percent of the total last year,  De Beers  said.  “Prices have continued to rise substantially,” Elphick
said by phone. “Demand is almost insatiable. The American
consumer is coming back with much greater confidence, Chinese
demand is extremely strong and India demand is very strong.”  Price gains are also underpinned by a long-term decline in
output as the world’s largest mines are exhausted.  Gem, based in  London  and operating in southern Africa and
Australia, said in a statement today full-year net income rose
to $20.2 million, from $15.5 million as prices increased. It
estimates output of 300,000 carats this year, up from 257,641
carats last year, and 500,000 carats by 2013 on expansion of
Lesotho’s Letseng mine and development of a new Botswana mine.  De Beers said last month demand from  China  and India gained
by 25 percent and 31 percent respectively in 2010, and forecast
that by 2015 China,  Hong Kong , Taiwan, India and the Gulf would
account for almost 40 percent of global demand.  To contact the reporter on this story:
