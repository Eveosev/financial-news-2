  Shane Oliver , head of investment
strategy in Sydney at AMP Capital Investors Ltd., which manages
about $98 billion, comments on  stock trading  today amid growing
concerns about the safety of Japanese nuclear plants damaged by
the country’s worst earthquake on record.    Japan ’s Topix index tumbled as much as 14 percent, its
worst intraday loss since the 1987 stock market crash, while the
MSCI Asia Pacific Index sank 7.5 percent:  “There’s global concern about a major nuclear accident in
Japan, which could turn a very bad situation into a terrible
one. The economic implications could be severe. If there’s
widespread economic disruption in Japan, that would have a
serious economic impact on commodities and materials generally.  ‘‘Yesterday was a fairly conventional reaction to the
earthquake. But today, markets are taking the lead from the
problem of the nuclear reactor crisis.  ‘‘We don’t know which way this would go. On the one hand
this could settle down, and radiation leaks could be limited. If
we end up with a full scale meltdown, things could be a lot
worse. The nuclear thing has really got investors worried.’’  To contact the reporter on this story:
