Explosions at reactors at the
Fukushima Dai-Ichi power plant in  Japan  haven’t changed
radiation levels in neighboring  South Korea , according
to the Korea Institute of Nuclear Safety.  Levels on Ulleung island, 900 kilometers away from
the crippled nuclear power station in Fukushima, are normal, Lee
Dong Myung, an official at the state-run agency, said by phone
today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
