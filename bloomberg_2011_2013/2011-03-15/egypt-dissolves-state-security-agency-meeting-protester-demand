  Egypt ’s Interior Ministry said it
will dissolve the state security agency, an organization
targeted by protesters who blamed it for spying on activists and
violating human rights.  The ministry will establish a new unit in charge of
national security and fighting terror that will act “in
accordance with constitutional articles, laws and human
rights,” it said on its Facebook page. The new body will carry
out its duties “without intervening in the lives of citizens or
the practice of their political rights.”  Dissolving the security agency has been one of the main
demands of the protesters who toppled President  Hosni Mubarak 
last month. They accuse the agency of spying on activists and
committing wide-ranging human rights violations including
torture and arbitrary arrests.  “This is one of the achievements of the revolution,” said
Nasser Abdel Hamid, a member of The Alliance of the Youths’
Revolution, a coalition of protesting groups. Activists will
monitor how the new body will operate, he said in a phone
interview in Cairo. “You can change the name but keep the old
ways.”  Protesters had stormed a number of state security offices
after hearing reports that incriminating documents were being
shredded and burned inside.  To contact the reporter on this story:
