The bankruptcy case against Mexican
glassmaker Vitro SAB brought by third-party creditors was
rejected in a report prepared by a court-appointed official, the
Monterrey newspaper El Norte said.  Alejandro Sanchez, Vitro’s legal director, said the company
and the creditors will have 10 working days to comment on the
report, according to El Norte. Vitro didn’t qualify for
bankruptcy, El Norte said, citing the report.  At least 35 percent of a company’s debt must be past due
for at least 30 days to qualify, it showed. Vitro doesn’t meet
the requirement when counting intercompany loans of $1.9
billion, the paper said.  Vitro defaulted on more than $1.2 billion of bonds in 2009.  To contact the reporter on this story:
