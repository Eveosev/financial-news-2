Don Higson, fellow at the
Austrasian Radiation Protection Society and former adviser at
the  International Atomic Energy Agency  on nuclear safety
criteria in the 1980s, comments on the risks of using nuclear
power after leaks from plants in  Japan  following the nation’s
biggest earthquake. He spoke today in a telephone interview.  “We all know that these things don’t happen all the time.
It’s a very unlikely event. You could have a meteorite hit a
plant, that’s not unlikely. But you can’t say that now you will
not build a plant unless it can withstand a meteorite risk.  ‘‘Every time you go out the front door, you accept some
risk. You couldn’t function without some risk. So far the
experience of the industry has been very good.  ‘‘In due course, everyone will realize how safe nuclear
power is. You have this disastrous event, not many people are
going to get hurt. My opinion is that no one is going to get
hurt by radiation except workers on the plant. There’s always
occupational risk.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
