European drivers are shifting back
to cars that run on gasoline and away from those fueled by
diesel, halting a 12-year trend that began in 1995, the  International Energy Agency  said.  “The exponential growth of both diesel registrations and
cars in use observed from 1995 to 2007 is indeed unlikely to
resume,” the Paris-based IEA said in its monthly report today.  In 2009, for the first time since 2003, diesel car
registrations fell to 46.3 percent in  France ,  Germany , Italy,  Spain  and the U.K. Gasoline car sales were boosted by government
scrapping plans to support car manufacturers, the IEA said.  The popularity of diesel cars may wane because the vehicles
are likely to become more expensive as stricter European
emissions standards are enforced by 2014.  “This could add as much as 5 percent to the cost of a new
diesel car, also reducing its  fuel efficiency , and making it
uncompetitive for motorists driving less than 60,000 kilometers
(37,300 miles) over the first three years of the car’s life,”
the agency said.  Diesel’s “retail price advantage” is also shrinking, the
IEA said. The fuel is about 10 percent cheaper than gasoline,
compared with a discount of 15 percent in 2009.  “Should dieselization be drawing to an end, the European
refining industry, where distillate yields account for roughly
half of total production, would be affected,” the group said.
“Refiners would face a shrinking market amid higher supply
competition from other regions.”  About two-thirds of the European car fleet currently in use
is gasoline-based, according to the IEA.  To contact the reporter on this story:
