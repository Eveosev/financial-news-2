A Mauritania court sentenced
Mohamed Abdallahi Ould H’ Mednah to death for the murder of 
American aid worker Christopher Leggett.  Two accomplices, Didi Ould Bezeid and Mohamed Mahmoud Ould
Khouna, were ordered to 12 years and 3 years of imprisonment. Al
Qaida in the Islamic Maghreb had claimed responsibility for
Leggett’s death.  It would be the first time the death penalty is employed in
the country since the early 1980s.  To contact the reporter on this story:
