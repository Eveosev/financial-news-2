Turkeyâ€™s February budget produced a
surplus of 988 million liras ($627 million), after a deficit of
2.3 billion liras a year earlier, as the cost of supporting the
health and pensions systems fell, the  Finance Ministry  said.  Excluding interest payments on debt, the budget produced a
surplus of 7.2 billion liras, compared with a surplus of 2.3
billion liras a year earlier, the ministry in Ankara  said  in a
statement on its website today. The cumulative ex-interest
surplus in the first two months was 12 billion liras, or 86
percent of the full-year target, it said.  The government is aiming for a budget deficit of 33.5
billion liras this year, or about 2.8 percent of gross domestic
product, after beating its budget goals in 2010. The economy
probably grew more than 8 percent last year, faster than the
revised estimate of 6.8 percent, according to officials
including central bank Governor Durmus Yilmaz.  Tax revenue climbed 31 percent to 21.1 billion liras in
February from a year earlier.  Non-interest spending declined 1.8 percent from a year
earlier, helped by a drop in budget transfers to the health and
pensions system, the ministry said. Spending on interest rose 35
percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
