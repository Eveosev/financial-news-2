The U.K. granted 10 million pounds
($16 million) for three research projects for low carbon vehicle
development as part of the government’s effort to tackle
emissions blamed for  climate change .  The Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council, a
government body, is providing funds for the projects based at
three British universities, according to a statement from the
Department for Business, Innovation and Skills. The projects
were developed by the  EPSRC  and the Technology Strategy Board.  Loughborough University won 3 million pounds to research
subsystems including battery packs and electric motors for
hybrid electric vehicles, Victoria McGuire, a spokeswoman at the
EPSRC said in an e-mail.  Warwick University was awarded the same sum for optimising
the performance of electric motors and power electronics while
Brunel University won 4 million pounds for research into the use
of recycled and recyclable materials in vehicles, McGuire said.  “The coalition government is absolutely committed to low
carbon growth, tackling climate change and making our  energy
supply  more secure,” Mark Prisk, a government business
minister, said in the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
