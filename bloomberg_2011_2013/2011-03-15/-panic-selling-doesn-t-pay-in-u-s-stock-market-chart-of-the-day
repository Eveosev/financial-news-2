U.S. stock investors who avoid
“panic selling” are likely to be rewarded for their patience,
according to a study by Bank of America Merrill Lynch.  This conclusion is based on a comparison of the Standard &
Poor’s 500 Index with an adjusted version, calculated by the
firm. The latter assumes an investor sells on a day when the
benchmark falls 2.5 percent or more, stays away from stocks for
at least 20 trading days, and returns only after the initial
loss has been recouped.  The CHART OF THE DAY compares the  S&P 500  with index
readings derived from Merrill’s data, which goes back to 1960.
The adjusted benchmark would have finished last year at 459.46,
about 63 percent lower than its actual close.  “As tempting as it can be to exit the market after a sell-
off in an attempt to buy back at a lower price, timing re-entry
is very difficult,”  David Bianco , chief U.S. equity strategist
at the firm, wrote yesterday in a report. “The market’s best
days tend to come very close to the worst days.”  Staying invested is a more rewarding strategy as long as
the earnings outlook is intact and stocks aren’t too expensive,
Bianco wrote. He sees profits climbing 11 percent this year at
S&P 500 companies and expects the index to finish the year at
1,400, a gain of 8 percent from yesterday’s close.  There have been 29 years since 1960 in which the S&P 500
had at least one daily decline of 2.5 percent or more, according
to Merrill. The panic-selling strategy did better than the index
in only six of them, most recently in 2008.  (To save a copy of the chart, click here.)  To contact the reporter on this story:
