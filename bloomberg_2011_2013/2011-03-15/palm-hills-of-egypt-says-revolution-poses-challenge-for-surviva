  Palm Hills Developments SAE (PHDC) , the
second-biggest publicly traded real-estate developer in  Egypt ,
said 2011 will “pose challenges” to its survival in the wake
of a revolution in the country last month.  “Our message today is mixed: 2010 was the best year for
sales in PHD’s history, and was marked by a number of impressive
achievements,” Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Yasseen
Mansour said in an e-mailed statement today. “That said, this
coming year is going to pose challenges for our continuing
survival.”  Palm Hills warned that it would make “low to no new
reservations” in the first half of the year as the economy
remains disrupted after the revolution that toppled President  Hosni Mubarak  in February. Spending on construction will be
reduced by 50 percent to 1 billion Egyptian pounds ($168.7
million) in 2011, the Cairo-based company said in the statement.  The company is also facing a case for an allegedly illegal
land sale. A panel of Egyptian judges recommended this month the
annulment of a 966,000 square-meter land sale to  Palm Hills  by
the government because the plot wasn’t sold at an auction.
Disputed land sales represent less than 7.5 percent of its total
land bank, Palm Hills said in today’s statement.  Fourth-quarter net income declined to 181.2 million pounds,
from 185.1 million pounds a year earlier. The value of new
reservations almost doubled to 1.12 billion pounds in the fourth
quarter, it said.  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
