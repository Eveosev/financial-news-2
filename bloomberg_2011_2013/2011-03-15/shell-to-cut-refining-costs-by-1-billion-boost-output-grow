  Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA) ,  Europe ’s
largest oil company, pledged extra cost cuts in refining and
marketing costs as it seeks to accelerate production growth
through 2014.  The company plans to reduce costs by $1 billion by the end
of next year, The Hague-based Shell said today in a statement.
It reiterated a target to increase oil and gas production to 3.7
million barrels of oil equivalent a day in 2014, an increase of
12 percent from 2010.  “We are on track to deliver our three-year plan, which we
outlined last year,” Chief Executive  Peter Voser  said in a
Bloomberg Television interview. “We increased our cash flow
substantially into 2011 and we are on track to deliver the
production and  cash flow  growth by 2012.”  Shell plans to invest $100 billion in projects in four
years through 2014, to maintain output growth through 2020. The
company is examining plans to tap 10 billion barrels of oil
equivalent resources and is assessing 30 projects with
production potential of more than 1 million barrels a day.  Shell is developing 20 new projects to add more than
800,000 barrels of oil equivalent a day to raise daily output to
3.5 million barrels in 2012, a 6 percent gain from 2010.  The explorer added 1.37 billion barrels of oil equivalent
of proved oil and gas reserves before production, raising the
total to 14.249 billion barrels net to Shell at the end of 2010.
Reserves increased by 117 million barrels from the end of 2009,
after taking into account last year’s production figures.  To contact the reporter on this story:
