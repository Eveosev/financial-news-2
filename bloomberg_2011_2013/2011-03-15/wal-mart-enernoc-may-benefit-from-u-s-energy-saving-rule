  Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (WMT)  and  EnerNOC
Inc. (ENOC)  may benefit from a new U.S. regulation aimed at encouraging
electricity conservation in wholesale energy markets.  The  Federal Energy Regulatory Commission  approved today, on
a vote of 4-to-1, a rule requiring power-grid operators to pay
users that cut back on energy consumption the market price of
electricity when it is cost-effective to do so. Commissioner
Philip Moeller dissented, calling the decision a “misguided
attempt” to manage power reductions.  Wal-Mart, the world’s largest retailer based in
Bentonville, Arkansas, and Boston-based EnerNOC, which sells
smart-grid technologies, are among the companies that supported
a commission proposal for grid operators to pay the full market
price at all hours. Power producers such as Chicago-based  Exelon
Corp. (EXC)  said such a proposal was too generous to users and would
skew market prices.  The revised rule adopted today orders grid operators to
determine by July 22 when payment of the market price would be
beneficial for users.  “Today’s final rule is about bringing benefits to
consumers,” FERC Chairman Jon Wellinghoff said in a statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
