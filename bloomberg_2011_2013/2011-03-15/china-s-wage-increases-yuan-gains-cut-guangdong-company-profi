Wage increases in  China  and the
appreciation of the yuan have reduced the profitability of small
industrial companies in the southern province of Guangdong, the
National Bureau of Statistics said.  The profit margin for so-called small-scale industrial
companies fell to 3.9 percent last year, a decline of 0.2
percentage points from a year earlier, the statistics bureau
said on its website. Small-scale industrial companies are those
that derive less than 20 million yuan ($3 million) of annual
revenue from their core businesses, the stats bureau said.  Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao’s goals of bolstering the
spending power of the nation’s consumers and narrowing the
wealth gap are squeezing margins for labor intensive industries.
Appreciation of the yuan, which helps curb inflation by allowing
China to import goods at lower prices, is also making goods
produced by domestic manufacturers more expensive overseas.  “As market competition intensifies after the global
financial crisis, Guangdong can’t solely rely on export
processing for sustainable economic growth,” the statistics
bureau said in its statement.  In Guangdong, the average monthly wages rose to 1,924 yuan
last year from 1,694 yuan in the previous year, the stats bureau
said. The Chinese currency has risen 3.9 percent against the
dollar since the start of 2010.  To contact the reporter on this story:
