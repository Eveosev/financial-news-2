Demand for commodities will remain
intact after  Japan ’s biggest earthquake as rebuilding efforts
will outweigh a decline in industrial production,  Mark Mobius ,
chairman of Templeton Asset Management’s Emerging Markets Group,
said in an interview with CNBC today.  “We don’t think there’s going to be a significant change
in the longer-term trend,” Mobius said. “We haven’t moved to
buy or sell. There is tremendous spending that has to be done,
and that will boost the demand for steel, iron ore and the rest
of it.”  Copper fell to a three-month low in New York on concern
that Japanese demand for industrial metals will slow after last
week’s earthquake and tsunami forced factories and smelters to
close. Aluminum, tin, zinc, lead and nickel also fell in  London .  Templeton’s Mobius said commodities are dropping as
investors “want to get into cash and wait to see what
happens,” and “some of it is just panic.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
