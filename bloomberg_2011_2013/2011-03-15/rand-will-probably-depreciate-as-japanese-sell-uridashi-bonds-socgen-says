The rand should be sold against the
dollar as it will probably depreciate on  risk aversion  as
Japanese households sell uridashi bonds to hold cash for coping
with the aftermath of the March 11 quake, Societe Generale SA
said.  Investors should sell the rand at 6.8750 per dollar and buy
the U.S. currency on speculation the rand will weaken to 7.3500
per dollar, the French bank wrote in a research report dated
today. The other two currencies most “at risk” are the Turkish
lira and the Brazilian real, it said.  Uridashi bonds are debt issued in the euromarket and sold
mainly to Japanese individual investors.  To contact the reporter on this story:
