  India ’s oil-product sales in
February rose for the fourth consecutive month as the world’s
second-fastest growing major economy used more diesel and
gasoline to fuel vehicles and factories.  Sales climbed 3.7 percent from a year earlier to 11.82
million metric tons, according to preliminary government data.
Diesel, which accounts for about 40 percent of fuel sales, rose
5.6 percent to 4.91 million tons. Gasoline use increased 6.9
percent to 1.13 million tons.  India’s industrial output grew 3.7 percent in January, more
than analysts expected. The $1.3-trillion economy may expand as
much as 9.25 percent in the financial year starting April 1, the
fastest pace since 2008, compared with an estimated 8.6 percent
gain in the current year, the  finance ministry  said last month.  Jet-fuel sales climbed 11 percent to 421,400 tons and
liquefied petroleum gas, used as cooking fuel and to power
vehicles, grew 6.7 percent to 1.21 million tons.  Sales of liquefied natural gas climbed 27 percent to
717,400 tons, while bitumen, used in  road construction , grew 6.3
percent to 500,900 tons.  Sales of kerosene declined 2.8 percent to 750,000 tons
while naphtha, used as chemical feedstock, fell 6.3 percent to
648,900 tons.  To contact the reporter on this story:
