  Edisun Power Europe AG (ESUN) , a Zurich-
based solar power producer, surged 58 percent to 79 francs
today, its biggest gain since September 2008, following Japan’s
nuclear-reactor disaster.  The company is among the solar project developers in  Europe 
that are expected to benefit in the aftermath of the nuclear
accidents in Japan. Edisun, with a market value of 27 million
francs ($30 million), said in November that it operated 71 solar
power facilities with a total capacity of 9.6 megawatts in
Switzerland, Germany, Spain and France.  Edisun, which develops, finances and operates solar power
plants through much of Europe, has risen 39 percent this year.
The shares surged as much as 70 percent in today’s trading.  To contact the reporter on this story:
