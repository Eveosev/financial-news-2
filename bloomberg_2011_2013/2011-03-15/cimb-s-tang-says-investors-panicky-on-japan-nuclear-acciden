Raymond Tang, who oversees $6.4
billion as chief investment officer at CIMB-Principal Asset
Management Bhd. in  Kuala Lumpur , comments on the impact on
stocks of  Japan ’s nuclear accident following its strongest
 earthquake .  Japanese Prime Minister Naoto Kan said the risk of further
radiation leaks is rising after a third explosion rocked the
Fukushima power plant north of Tokyo and he warned people living
within 30 kilometers to stay indoors.  “Markets are getting very nervous over what’s happening in
Japan. People are being risk averse and panicky as the fear-
mongering passes on to the general population and are fed to the
markets.  ‘‘I don’t know how much fear is gripping everything now,
this is something I’ve never experienced before. I’m still
analyzing” what action to take.  To contact the reporter on this story:
