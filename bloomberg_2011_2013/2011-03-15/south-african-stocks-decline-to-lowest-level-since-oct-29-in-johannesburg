  South Africa ’s FTSE/JSE  Africa  All
Share Index fell 684.63, or 2.2 percent, to 30,193.95 by the 5
p.m. close in Johannesburg, the lowest since Oct. 28.  The following were among the most active stocks in the
South African market today.    Anglo American Plc (AGL)  , part-owner of the world’s
biggest platinum and diamond producers, tumbled 5.10 rand, or
1.5 percent, to 337.50 rand, the weakest since Dec. 20. Copper
fell to a three-month low in  New York  on concern that Japanese
demand for industrial metals will slow after last week’s
earthquake and tsunami forced plants and smelters to close.  BHP
Billiton Plc (BIL)  , the world’s largest mining company,
retreated 2.44 rand, or 1 percent, to 250.60 rand.    AngloGold Ashanti Ltd. (ANG)   declined for a second day,
losing 3.51 rand, or 1.1 percent, to 315.50 rand. The largest
South African producer of the metal said first-quarter output
will miss its target of 1.04 million ounces by about 20,000
ounces because of heavy rains at its Sunrise Dam mine in  Australia . Its full-year production forecast of 4.55 -4.75
million ounces is unchanged, it said.  Cie. Financiere Richemont SA (CFR SJ), the world’s largest
jewelry maker, dropped 1.01 rand, or 2.7 percent, to 36.73 rand,
the lowest in four months. Some of the company’s units,
including the Chloe fashion label, count  Japan  as their largest
market. Japan is the world’s second-largest market for  luxury
goods  after the U.S., accounting for 11 percent of total sales,
according to consulting firm Bain & Co.    Gold Fields Ltd. (GFI)  , Africa’s second-biggest
producer, fell for the first day in three, slipping 2.35 rand,
or 2 percent, to 117.25 rand. Gold declined to the lowest level
in more than three weeks in New York as some investors sold the
metal to raise cash as other commodities and equities dropped.    Iliad Africa Ltd. (ILA)  , a producer of building
supplies, retreated 30 cents, or 4.3 percent, to 6.71 cents, its
lowest since Oct. 15. The company said the 2011 trading
environment will be ‘challenging’.    Investec Ltd. (INL)  , an investment and private banking
company, dropped 2.11 rand, or 4.1 percent, to 49.49 rand, its
lowest closing price since July 2009. Investec said it delayed
the listing of rand perpetual preference shares on
Johannesburg’s stock exchange until it has clarified tax
implications on dividends.    JSE Ltd. (JSE)  , the operator of Johannesburg’s stock
exchange slipped the most in more than two years, losing 4.50
rand, or 6 percent, to 70 rand. The company said earnings per
share excluding one-time items fell to 4.36 cents in 2010 from
4.56 rand a year earlier.    Mvelaphanda Group Ltd. (MVG)  , a commercial services
provider, retreated 11 cents, or 3.5 percent, to 3 rand, the
lowest in almost three months. The company said it expects to
report a loss per share of between 51 cents and 56 cents for the
six months ended Dec. 31, compared with a profit of 117.3 cents
per share in the year-earlier period. The company said it had
entered into talks, which, if successfully concluded, may affect
its share price.  SacOil Holdings Ltd. (SCL SJ), an oil and natural gas
exploration company, extended yesterday’s 8.1 percent loss,
falling 4 cents, or 2 percent, to 2 rand. SacOil yesterday
denied a complaint by shareholder Kevin van der Walt that it
published incorrect or misleading information related to the
sale of a 60 percent stake in an oil block in the Democratic
Republic of Congo to Total SA.    Uranium One Inc. (UUU)  , the producer of the uranium
mineral used to make nuclear fuel, fell for a fourth day,
dropping 6.35 rand, or 20 percent, to 25.25 rand, after
yesterday’s 24 percent decline. Uranium-oxide concentrate prices
fell 9.8 percent to $60 a pound in the seven days through
yesterday after Japan’s biggest earthquake on record damaged
reactors at a power plant operated by Tokyo Electric Power Co.,
Ux Consulting Co. said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
