  Sempra Energy (SRE) ’s liquefied-natural-
gas terminal in Louisiana is scheduled to receive a cargo March
27, according to vessel tracking data compiled by Bloomberg.  Valencia Knutsen, the tanker carrying the cargo, can move
as much as 173,400 cubic meters of LNG, or about 3.73 billion
cubic feet of natural gas, equivalent to 5.9 percent of
estimated daily U.S. gas production.  Sempra operates the Cameron terminal, which can send about
1.5 billion cubic feet of gas a day into connecting pipelines,
according to  the company.  The facility is near  Lake Charles ,
Louisiana, about 130 miles west of  Baton Rouge .  Natural gas scheduled for delivery to Louisiana residents
fell 6 percent today to 206,922 dekatherms, or about 0.2 billion
cubic feet, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  LNG is gas that’s cooled to a liquid for transport by ship
to markets not connected by pipelines. The fuel is received at
import terminals and converted back to a gas.  To contact the reporter on this story:
