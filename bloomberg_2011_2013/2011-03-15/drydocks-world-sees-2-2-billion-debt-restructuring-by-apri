Drydocks World LLC, the ship-repair
unit owned by state-controlled Dubai World, expects to reach a
deal on restructuring $2.2 billion of debt with creditor banks
by the end of April, Chairman Khamis Jumaa Buamin said.  “We are in final discussions and that’s what we are hoping
for,” Buamin said in a telephone interview from Dubai today.
“We have not requested any support from the government.”  Drydocks World borrowed $1.7 billion for three years in
August 2008 from a group of banks at 170 basis points over the
London interbank offered rate to fund an acquisition, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg. It borrowed another $500 million
the same month for five years at 190 basis points over Libor, to
fund another deal, according to the data. A basis point is 0.01
percentage point.  Drydocks World’s parent, Dubai World, one of the emirate’s
three main state-owned holding companies, roiled credit markets
in November 2009 when it sought to delay payments on debt. The
company will sign a deal to restructure its debt within a week,
Chairman Sheikh Ahmed bin Saeed  Al Maktoum  said on March 9.  Buamin declined to elaborate on the terms of the deal.  To contact the reporters on this story:
