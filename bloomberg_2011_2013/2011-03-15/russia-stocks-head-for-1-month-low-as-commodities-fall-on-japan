Russian stocks headed for their
lowest close in more than a month as the risk of radiation leaks
after  Japan ’s earthquake worsened, spurring concern the global
recovery may falter and prompting a selloff in commodities.  The Micex Index retreated 2.4 percent to 1,685.08 by 1:53
p.m. in Moscow. Oil producer OAO Gazprom Neft plunged 4.7
percent. OAO Rostelecom,  Russia ’s dominant long-distance phone
company, dropped 4 percent. OAO Sberbank, the country’s largest
lender, fell 2.8 percent. The dollar-denominated RTS Index lost
2.7 percent to 1,892.37.  Crude oil retreated as much as 3.3 percent to $97.81 a
barrel in  New York . Asian stocks tumbled after two further
explosions rocked the Fukushima Dai-Ichi nuclear plant and Prime
Minister  Naoto Kan  said the risk of further radiation leaks is
rising. The March 11 temblor caused a death toll estimated at
more than 10,000 and shut down factories  “The whole market is getting whacked from what’s happening
in Japan,” said Doug Rohlfs, a sales trader at UralSib
Financial Corp., in e-mailed comments. “Pretty much everything
is down heavily today.”  Russian steelmakers OAO Novolipetsk Steel lost 2.6 percent
and OAO Magnitogorsk Iron & Steel dropped 2.5 percent after
rallying yesterday on speculation sales will rise as Japanese
rivals halt production following the earthquake.  Copper for three-month delivery slid as much as 2.6 percent
in  London .  Lead, zinc, tin and nickel also fell.  To contact the reporter on this story:
