Nikhil Vora, managing director of
research at IDFC Securities Ltd., comments on the impact of the
earthquake and the nuclear accident in  Japan  on the country’s
foreign investments and trade with  India .  The Bombay Stock Exchange’s Sensitive Index, or Sensex,
slumped as much as 2.8 percent to 17,920.55 and traded at 18,221
at 11:04 a.m. in Mumbai.  “India’s trade with Japan has not been of extremely high
order, both import and exports. To that extent, it will not
cause a drastic impact. What could impact us in an indirect
manner is that Japan is a fairly large international investor.
It is one of the financiers for a lot of global trade. Given the
damage that they’ve had in recent times, a lot of liquidity will
be required within Japan, which means their external funding
will be under some constraint. That could lead to some amount of
spike in inflation rates and  interest rates .”  “Japan is an exporter of steel and one of the largest
copper converters. This is negative for companies which have
yen-dominated loans, positive for players like copper smelters
or steel producers because Japan used to be an exporter and now
it won’t be.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
