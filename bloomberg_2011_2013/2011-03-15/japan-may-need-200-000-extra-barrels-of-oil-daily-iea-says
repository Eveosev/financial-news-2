Oil demand in  Japan  may climb by
about 200,000 barrels a day if the country makes up the
shortfall in nuclear power with crude-fired generation, the  International Energy Agency  said.  Japan shut 11 atomic reactors totaling about 9.7 gigawatts
of capacity after being struck on March 11 by its largest
recorded earthquake. The country has enough spare oil-fired
plants to make up the loss, using only 30 percent of the crude
generation units in 2009, the IEA said in its monthly Oil Market
Report today.  Increasing the country’s natural gas-fired generation may
also replace the lost nuclear plants, the agency said. Japan’s
gas plants are currently running at only 55 percent of capacity.  “If the shortfall were met entirely by oil, consumption
would increase by roughly 200,000 barrels a day on an annual
basis,” the report said. “The generation of an extra 60
terawatt-hours using only gas would require plants to operate at
near 70 percent of capacity, implying an additional 12 billion
cubic meters of liquefied natural gas a year.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
