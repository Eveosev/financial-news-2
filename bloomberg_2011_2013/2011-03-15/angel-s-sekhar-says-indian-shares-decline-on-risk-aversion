P. Phani Sekhar,  fund manager  at
the portfolio management service of Angel Broking Ltd., comments
on the outlook for  India ’s stocks amid concern about the safety
of nuclear plants damaged by  Japan ’s earthquake last week.
Sekhar spoke in a phone interview today.  The Bombay Stock Exchange’s Sensitive Index, or Sensex,
slumped 1.4 percent to 18,189.20 at 10:47 a.m. in Mumbai.  “There is likely to be some change in the investment
decisions, but today the size of the catastrophe isn’t yet
clear.  ‘‘The decline in markets is a combination of kneejerk
reaction and fundamental concerns. This is a situation where
nobody has a living memory of what has happened, and sentiment
overpowers rationale in such a scenario.  ‘‘Also, there is a question of allocation of capital and  risk aversion  on the fundamental side.’’  ‘‘It is clear that irrespective of what happens in Japan,
India is going to be affected but not to do the same degree as
what the markets are showing. In the near term, in such events,
the markets will always overshoot themselves on the downside.
But it is very difficult to predict what the level will be.’’  To contact the reporter on this story:
