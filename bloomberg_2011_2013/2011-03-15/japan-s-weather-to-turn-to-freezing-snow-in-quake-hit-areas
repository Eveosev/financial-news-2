Rain and snow are forecast for
areas of northern  Japan  ravaged by a record earthquake on March
11 as rescue workers struggle to reach thousands of people and
others huddle in emergency shelters.  In tsunami-ravaged Miyagi prefecture, where officials say
the death toll may reach 10,000, there is a 70 percent chance of
rain this evening in the capital of Sendai, according to the
 Japan Meteorological Agency . The precipitation is expected to
turn to snow tomorrow morning as the temperature drops to 1
degree Celsius (33.8 degrees Farenheit) and below freezing in
other areas.  In Fukushima prefecture, where workers are battling to
avoid a nuclear meltdown, the forecast was also for afternoon
rain turning to snow with the temperature dropping tomorrow to a
low of minus 3 degrees Celsius in some areas.  About 1.3 million households were without power in Japan
and 1.4 million had no running water, according to a government
report on the earthquake. The temblor was upgraded yesterday to
a magnitude of 9 from 8.9 by the  U.S. Geological Survey .  Rescue teams have had trouble reaching about 24,000 people
stranded in northeastern Japan, according to public broadcaster
NHK, and more than 310,000 are in emergency shelters and heating
systems are short of fuel.  About 120,000 blankets, 120,000 bottles of water, 100,000
packages of instant noodles, 10,000 diapers and 130 portable
toilets were en route to the most devastated areas, according to
a statement on the prime ministerâ€™s website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
