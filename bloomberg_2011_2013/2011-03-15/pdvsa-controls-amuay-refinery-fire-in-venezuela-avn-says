  Petroleos de Venezuela , the state
oil company, controlled a fire that broke out this morning at
the Amuay refinery in northwestern  Venezuela , state news agency
AVN reported.  PDVSA, as the Caracas-based company is called, is working
to extinguish the fire at the refinery, where crude processing
is operating at normal levels, AVN  said  today on its website.  “The principal units were not damaged,” Jesus Luongo,
general manager of the Paraguana refining complex, told AVN.
Luongo said the fire’s cause is unknown.  The 635,000-barrrel-a-day refinery is part of the Centro
Refinacion Paraguana, the largest refining complex in the world.
PDVSA operates the adjacent Cardon refinery, which had a fire in
March, and was shut by an electrical storm in December.  Today’s explosion may have originated in a distillation
unit and was felt in adjacent municipalities, television station
Globovision said on its  website .  A spokesman for the Paraguana complex wasn’t available to
comment by telephone.  Crude oil for April delivery fell $3.89 to $97.30 a barrel
at 9:49 a.m. on the  New York Mercantile Exchange . Futures are up
about 23 percent from a year ago.  To contact the reporter on this story:
