Porsche SE, the German automaker,
was sued by hedge funds Greenlight Capital Inc., Tiger
Management LLC and other funds over $1 billion in short-selling
losses.  The funds accused Porsche of fraud, saying it hid its plan
to corner the market in  Volkswagen AG (VOW)  shares, according to a
complaint filed today in  New York  State Supreme Court. The funds
had shorted, or bet against, Volkswagen stock and suffered
losses when Porsche revealed its holdings.  “Porsche lured the plaintiffs into a trap, making
plaintiffs believe VW shares were overvalued while hiding from
plaintiffs the risk of a massive short squeeze that would send
the price skyrocketing several hundred percent,” they said in
court papers.  Porsche was sued in federal court in New York over the same
allegations and won dismissal of the lawsuits last year.  Albrecht Bamler, a spokesman for Stuttgart, Germany-based
Porsche, didn’t immediately return an e-mail seeking comment
after normal business hours.  The case is Glenview Capital LP v.  Porsche Automobil
Holding SE (PAH3) , 650678-2011, New York State Supreme Court
  Manhattan ).  To contact the reporter on this story:
