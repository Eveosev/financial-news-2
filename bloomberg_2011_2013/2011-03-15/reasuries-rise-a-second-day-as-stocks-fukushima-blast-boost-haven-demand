Treasuries advanced for a second
day after Japanese stocks fell and  Tokyo  Electric Power Co.
confirmed a third explosion at its Fukushima nuclear plant.  Investors sought the relative safety of government debt as  Japan  suffered aftershocks following an earthquake and tsunami
last week, officials battled to avert a meltdown at the power
plant and Saudi Arabian troops moved into Bahrain. Yields
indicate investors are cutting bets on inflation.  “Temporarily, yields will go down,” said Kei Katayama,
leader of the foreign fixed-income group in Tokyo at Daiwa SB
Investments Ltd., which has the equivalent of $41.8 billion
under management. “There are earthquakes even while I’m
sleeping.”  Ten-year rates declined three basis points to 3.33 percent
as of 10:29 a.m. in Tokyo, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The 3.625 percent note maturing in February 2021 rose
7/32, or $2.19 per $1,000 face amount, to 102 15/32.  The level of radiation at the Fukushima plant rose above
the legal limit after the latest explosion,  Kyodo News  reported.
In the Middle East, more than 100 military vehicles crossed into
Bahrain, Al-Jazeera television reported, in response to protests
in the nation.  Inflation Bets  The difference between yields on 10-year notes and Treasury
Inflation Protected Securities, a gauge of trader expectations
for consumer prices over the life of the debt, narrowed to 2.44
percentage points from 2.57 percentage points a week ago. It is
still more than the five-year average of 2.08 percent.  Japan’s  Nikkei 225 (NKY)  Stock Average fell as much as 6.6
percent, after a 6.2 percent slide yesterday.  “Everyone’s going into short-term Treasuries right now,”
said  Michael Franzese , managing director and head of Treasury
trading at Wunderlich Securities Inc. in  New York . “It’s the
capital-preservation trade.”  All of the 101 economists in a Bloomberg News survey expect
the  Federal Reserve  to hold its target rate for overnight
lending at zero to 0.25 percent, where it has been since
December 2008, at a meeting today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
