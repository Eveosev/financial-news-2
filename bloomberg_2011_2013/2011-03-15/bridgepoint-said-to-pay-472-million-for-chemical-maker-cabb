Bridgepoint Capital Ltd. agreed to
buy a German chemicals company from AXA Private Equity for about
340 million euros ($472 million), a person with knowledge of the
situation said.  The buyout firm has arranged leveraged loans, underwritten
by  DZ Bank , Commerzbank AG and Societe Generale SA, another
person familiar with the deal said.  CABB, based in Sulzbach near  Frankfurt , extends
Bridgepoint’s foray into chemicals. The company manufactures
monochloroacetic acid, used in products spanning herbicides,
drugs and foods. Bridgepoint will seek to build on CABB’s market
share with bolt-on acquisitions, Graham Oldroyd, a partner at
the London-based buyout firm, said in a statement.  “CABB fits the Bridgepoint investment criteria well,”
said Uwe Kolb, who oversees Bridgepoint’s investment activities
in German-speaking countries. “The company has leading
positions in its markets, a solid cash-flow as well as the
potential to realize further growth by means of a globalization
strategy.”  Greenhill & Co., Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer LLP,  Clifford Chance  advised Bridgepoint on the transaction. CABB
hired Rothschild to manage the sale.  To contact the reporter on this story:
