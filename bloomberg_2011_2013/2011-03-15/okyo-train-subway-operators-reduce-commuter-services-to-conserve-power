  Japan ’s biggest subway and train
operators reduced services on commuter lines for a second
weekday to conserve power after the March 11 earthquake
crippled a nuclear power plant north of the capital Tokyo.    East Japan Railway Co. (9020) , which runs Tokyo’s busiest
above-ground system, is operating limited services on 22 of
its commuter lines and three bullet trains, according to its
website. Tokyo Metro Co., the city’s biggest subway network,
was operating all nine of its lines at about 50 percent of
the normal schedule, it said on its website.  Tokyo’s central business district appeared less
congested than usual as companies asked some employees to
work from home. At about 10 a.m. a line of eight taxis were
waiting for riders in front of  Tokyo Station ’s Marunouchi
south exit, a reversal from March 11, when train stoppages
left commuters to wait in 200 meter lines for a cab.  Express train services to Narita International Airport,
the nation’s busiest international hub, were still suspended.  JR East , as East Japan Railway is known, was not operating
its Narita Express service today, while Keisei Electric
Railway Co. halted operations on its Skyliner express to the
airport in Narita.  Tokyo Monorail Co., a venture with JR East, was
operating its line on a curtailed schedule from Hamamatsucho
Station in central Tokyo to Haneda Airport,  Asia ’s second
busiest.  Below is a list of Tokyo area train lines and their
status of operations as of 11 a.m. local time:  To contact the reporter on this story:
