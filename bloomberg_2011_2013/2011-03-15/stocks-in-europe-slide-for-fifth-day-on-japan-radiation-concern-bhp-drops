European stocks slid for a fifth
day as concern grew that a Japanese nuclear power plant will
leak radiation. U.S. futures and Asian shares both plunged.  BHP Billiton Ltd. and Rio Tinto Group both sank more than 2
percent, leading a selloff in basic-resource shares as metal
prices retreated. Clean energy companies extended yesterdayâ€™s
gains.  The benchmark Stoxx Europe 600 Index slumped 1.9 percent to
267.26 at 8:03 a.m. in  London , the largest decline in four
months.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
