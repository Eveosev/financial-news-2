Armed men from Al Shabwan tribe in
the central Yemeni province of Marib attacked an oil pipeline
yesterday evening that carries the oil from Marib to Ras Eisa
port on the  Red Sea , local news  website  Marib Press reported.  An explosion damaged the pipeline, which pumps 120,000
barrels a day, and production from two  oil fields  has been
