The number of Greeks working in
agriculture rose by 38,000 over 2008-2009 as more people swapped
urban for rural lifestyles,  Kathimerini  reported, citing a study
by the  Panhellenic Confederation of Agricultural Co-Operative
Unions .  The increase represented a 7 percent rise in agricultural
workers, with the biggest growth coming in the 45 to 64 age
group, the Athens-based newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
