Canadian heavy oil exports face a
“classic bottleneck,” and the nation needs a pipeline to its
western coast to open sales to Asia, said Lawrence Eagles,
global head of oil research at  JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM)     Canada  needs more than one buyer,” Eagles said at the
 World Heavy Oil Congress  in Edmonton,  Alberta . “You need to
transit oil to the Pacific coast.”  Producers of oil taken from sands in northeastern Alberta
have limited pipeline capacity to refineries in the U.S. That
leads to a discount to other crudes that could be narrowed with
a line serving Asian markets. Demand for crude has producers to
transportation alternatives including trains and barges.  “People are finding ways every day to get more oil out of
the region and down to the  Gulf Coast ,” Eagles said. “If price
is there, oil will find a way.”  The impact of last week’s earthquake and tsunami in  Japan 
on oil demand will depend on how the disasters affect economic
growth, the New York-based Eagles said. If growth remains
constant, there could be an increase in requirements for power-
generating fuels in that nation.  “There are power-generation needs that will need to be
filled,” he said. “Japan has a lot of spare capacity in the
power sector that can use liquefied natural gas or oil.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
