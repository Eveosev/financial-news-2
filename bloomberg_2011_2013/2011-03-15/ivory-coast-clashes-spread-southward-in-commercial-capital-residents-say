Clashes in  Ivory Coast  between an
armed group backing President-elect  Alassane Ouattara  and forces
loyal to incumbent  Laurent Gbagbo  spread southward in the
commercial capital, Abidjan, residents said.  Gunfire resumed this morning in the neighborhood of
Williamsville, where a police barracks is based, after residents
said they heard sustained machine-gun fire yesterday evening.
The group backing Ouattara is known as the “invisible commando.”  “We think that the ‘invisible commando’ attacked the
barracks,” Williamsville resident Alphonse Yeo said by phone
today. “We hardly slept and nobody dares to go outside.”  Ivory Coast, the world’s top cocoa producer, is on the
brink of civil war, with almost 400 people killed since a
disputed Nov. 28 election, according to the  United Nations .
Gbagbo retains the loyalty of the armed forces, while Ouattara
has set up his rival administration in the Golf hotel in Abidjan
protected by UN peacekeepers.  “We can’t live in this neighborhood anymore,” Christelle
Kla said by phone. “They are fighting 300 meters from our
doorstep.”  Ouattara, the internationally recognized winner of the
election, extended a ban on cocoa exports until the end of the
month, Malick Tohe, an adviser to his administration, said
yesterday.  Cocoa Ban  “The ban has been extended until March 31,” Tohe said in
an interview from Abidjan. Ouattara imposed the ban on Jan. 24
to cut off  tax revenue  to incumbent Gbagbo, who refuses to step
down.  All major cocoa exporters in  Ivory Coast  have heeded the
ban. About 440,000 metric tons of cocoa are currently stored in
exporters’ warehouses near the port of Abidjan, said Tohe.  European industry group Caobisco, the European Cocoa
Association and the Federation of Cocoa Commerce Ltd. expressed
“increasing concern” today about the situation in Ivory Coast.  “We deeply regret that a political solution has not been
found yet, and we continue to commend efforts for a speedy
restoration of peace,” the groups said in a  statement . “Our
members’ operations in Côte d’Ivoire in terms of procurement and
processing of cocoa are severely hindered, while exports of
cocoa have come to a standstill.”  Export Taxes  In a bid to collect export taxes and resume shipments,
Gbagbo on March 7 said he took control of cocoa purchases and
exports. Four days later, the Gbagbo-controlled national cocoa
management committee in a statement warned exporters that
undeclared cocoa bean stocks would be seized.  In London, cocoa futures for May delivery fell 44 pounds,
or 2 percent, to 2,140 pounds ($3,428) a ton as of 11:07 a.m.  Many offices and shops in downtown Abidjan remained closed
today as office workers were told they should stay at home for
security reasons.  “Nobody is going to the office today,”said Ghislaine
Kouassi, a manager for a telecommunications company. “It’s too
dangerous. You don’t know where they are going to start fighting
next.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
