(Corrects tourism data in fourth paragraph.)    Vietnam ’s benchmark stock index
fell for a second day, as construction companies dropped after
the government said transportation project funding will be
slashed and tourism operators sank on concern an earthquake and
tsunami in Japan will reduce visitors.  The Ho Chi Minh City Stock Exchange’s VN Index slid 2.3
percent to 468.74 at 11 a.m. local time close, the lowest since
March 7.    Descon Construction Corp. (DCC) , a construction and real estate
development company, lost 4.8 percent to 19,700 dong. The
Ministry of Transportation will cut disbursement for
construction projects to 11 trillion dong ($527 million) this
year from an earlier plan of as much as 25 trillion dong,
Transportation Minister Ho Nghia Dung said in a statement filed
on the government’s website yesterday.  Vinpearl Joint-Stock Co., the owner of a resort, tumbled
the maximum 5 percent to 67,000 dong, after Thoi Bao Kinh Te
Vietnam newspaper said the number of tourists from  Japan  may
slump by about 30 percent this year, citing tourism companies.
Vietnam had forecast 5.5 million overseas visitors this year,
the report said, without specifying a figure for Japan.  Investors are concerned that investment “into Vietnam will
shrink as Japanese investors take their funds to rebuild their
home country,” Michel Tosto, director for institutional sales
and brokerage at Ho Chi Minh City-based Viet Capital Securities,
wrote in an e-mail today. “Less foreign direct investment from
Japan means less factory construction in Vietnam and a lot less
travelers from Japan.”  Construction Joint-Stock No. 5, which also distributes
building materials, slumped 4.9 percent to 29,400 dong, the
lowest level since May 11, 2009.  Royal International Corp. (RIC) ,
which provides villa and room rentals, fell 4.2 percent to
13,600 dong, the most since Feb. 21.  “Japan is among the top 10 countries that travel to
Vietnam and the earthquake will definitely affect the number of
tourists since they will have to prioritize spending to rebuild
their lives,” Nguyen Manh Cuong, deputy head of Vietnam
National Administration of Tourism, said by phone today.  --Nguyen Kieu Giang. With assistance by Uyen Nguyen in Hanoi.
