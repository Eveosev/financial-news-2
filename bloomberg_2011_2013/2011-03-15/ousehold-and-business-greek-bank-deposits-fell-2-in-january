Deposits held by businesses and
households in Greek banks fell by 4.1 billion euros ($5.7
billion) in January as the country’s economy contracted and
incomes declined.  Deposits by businesses and households were 204.8 billion
euros in January from 208.9 billion euros in December, a 2
percent decline, the Athens-based  Bank of Greece  said in a
statement posted on its website today. Deposits held by
households decreased 2.9 billion euros, or 1.7 percent, to 170.6
billion euros. Business deposits fell 3.5 percent to 34.2
billion euros.    Greece ’s economy contracted 4.5 percent last year as the
government slashed wages and pensions and raised taxes as part
of conditions for a 110 billion-euro European Union-led bailout
of the country’s debts. Household and business deposits dropped
12 percent through the year.  In December deposits increased to 208.9 billion euros from
208.5 billion euros in November.  To contact the reporter on this story:
