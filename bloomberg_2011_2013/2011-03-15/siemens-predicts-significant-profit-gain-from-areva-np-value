  Siemens AG (SIE) , Germany’s largest
engineering company, predicted a “significant positive
contribution” to quarterly profit from the sale of its stake in
a nuclear-power venture to French partner  Areva SA. (CEI)   An independent expert appointed by Munich-based Siemens and
Areva determined the value of Siemens’s 34 percent share in the
Areva NP SAS partnership at 1.62 billion euros ($2.26 billion),
Siemens said in an e-mailed statement today. The company has a  put option  to sell the stake to Areva by the end of January 2012
at the latest, according to the company.  Siemens announced its end to the participation in the
venture in 2009. The business, called Framatome at the time, is
the world’s biggest maker of nuclear reactors and was formed in
2001 when Paris-based Areva and Siemens merged their nuclear
reactor businesses in  France , Germany and the U.S.  The German company’s announcement of a value for its stake
comes as Japan faces the threat of a nuclear catastrophe after
an earthquake last week damaged atomic  power plants . As a
reaction to the escalating crisis in Japan, German Chancellor
Angela Merkel yesterday put plans to extend the life of
Germany’s reactors on hold for three months.  Areva is the world’s biggest builder of nuclear power
stations. The company has reactors under construction in
Finland, China and its home country of France, which boasts the
largest number of nuclear stations outside the U.S. France gets
more than 75 percent of its power from nuclear energy.  To contact the reporter for this story:
