  MedAssets Inc. (MDAS) , a provider of
services to health-care companies to manage supply chains and
costs, withdrew a $635 million loan refinancing, as about $4
billion in bank deals have been pulled in less than a week.  The MedAssets transaction, which was to refinance a $635
million term loan it got in November to back its acquisition of
the Broadlane Group, was pulled due to market conditions,
according to a person with knowledge of the deal, who declined
to be identified because the terms are private.  MedAssets follows Toys "R" Us and at least two other
companies that have pulled loans that would cut borrowing costs
as leveraged loan prices in the U.S. suffered their largest drop
last week since July. Global stocks plunged today amid a concern
that a damaged nuclear power plant in  Japan  and turmoil in the
Middle East may cripple the global economy.  “When MedAssets was first announced it might have looked
good, but now it looks out of context given the sell-off we’ve
had over the last week,” said George K. Goudelias, a money
manager at Seix Investment Advisors LLC, which has $12.9 billion
in leveraged assets under management. “The sell-off we’ve seen
in debt and equity will allow the market to reassess relative
value in the new-issue market.”  The Standard & Poor’s/LSTA U.S. Leveraged Loan 100 Index,
which tracks the 100 largest dollar-denominated first-lien
leveraged loans, has fallen for three consecutive weeks and rose
0.01 cent yesterday to 95.53 cents on the dollar. On Feb. 14, it
closed at 96.48 cents on the dollar, the highest level since
November 2007 and up from a low of 59.2 cents on Dec. 17, 2008,
three months after Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. collapsed.  Stocks Plunge  The  MSCI World (MXWO)  Index of developed nations fell 2.3 percent
at 12:11 p.m. in  New York  after the  Nikkei 225 (NKY)  index sank 10.6
percent to the lowest since April 2009. The  S&P 500 Index (SPX) 
tumbled 1.5 percent.  Bahrain declared a three-month state of emergency today and
Gulf Arab states  sent  troops to the island nation to maintain
security.  The average bid level for the most liquid North American
leveraged loans is 96.54 cents today, down from 97.18 yesterday,
according to information provider Markit Group Ltd.  The proposed interest rate on the MedAssets transaction was
3 percentage points to 3.25 percentage points more than the
London interbank offered rate with a 1 percent minimum on the
lending benchmark, said the person. The loan was expected to
price at par.  Barclays Plc was arranging the financing, according to the
person. The existing six-year  term loan  was sold to investors in
November at 99 cents on the dollar, with an interest rate of
3.75 percentage points over Libor, with a 1.5 percent Libor
floor, according to Bloomberg data.  Toys "R" Us Loan  Toys “R” Us, the world’s biggest toy retailer, canceled a
$1.1 billion loan transaction yesterday; Advantage Sales &
Marketing Inc., the Irvine, California-based provider of sales,
marketing and merchandising services, pulled plans to refinance
$1.225 billion in loans last week; and Swift Transportation Co.,
the biggest truckload carrier in  North America , withdrew a bid
to refinance a $1.01 billion term loan.  To contact the reporter on this story:
