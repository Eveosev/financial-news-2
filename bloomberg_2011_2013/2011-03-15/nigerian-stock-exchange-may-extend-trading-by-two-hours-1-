The  Nigerian Stock Exchange , sub-
Saharan  Africa ’s second-biggest, may extend trading by a further
two hours, Interim Administrator Emmanuel Ikazoboh said.  “If volumes are increasing, we will increase the time
further,” he said in Lagos today. Monitoring will take place
over the “next two months.”  The West African nation’s bourse added two hours to
trading, setting 2:30 p.m. as the close, on Dec. 6. That led to
an advance in the volume of shares traded, Ikazoboh said.  The exchange, which today inaugurated a call center, will
respond to customer complaints within 24 hours, Ikazoboh said.  The center is “to ensure that all complaints are addressed
within 24 hours, or depending on how complex the issues are,
within 48 hours,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
