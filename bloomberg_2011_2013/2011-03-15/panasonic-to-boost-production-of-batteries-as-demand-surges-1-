  Panasonic Corp. (6752) ,  Japan ’s biggest
maker of batteries, plans to boost production of disposable
batteries to meet surging demand after last week’s earthquake.  The Osaka-based company may raise output at its factory
there as well as those in  China , Thailand and Indonesia, Akira Kadota, a Tokyo-based spokesman, said by phone today.  “We haven’t finalized details of the plan yet,” he said.  Japanese consumers, facing electricity disruptions after
the March 11 record earthquake, are rushing to stores to snap up
daily necessities such as water, food and batteries as the risk
of nuclear radiation leaks north of Tokyo escalates. Prime
Minister  Naoto Kan  appealed for calm as he said the danger of
further radiation leaks was rising at  Tokyo  Electric Power Co.’s
nuclear facility in Fukushima.  Stores in Tokyo and its suburbs ordered about 10 times more
water than usual March 13-14, said Nobuo Saito, a spokesman for
the government’s Consumer Affairs Agency. Food retailers sold
about 9 times more chicken on those days than they did before
the earthquake, he said.  About 1.3 million households were without power and 1.4
million had no running water, according to a government report.
More than 310,000 people are in emergency shelters and heating
systems are short of fuel, the state broadcaster reported.  Panasonic, whose facilities in northern Japan halted
operations because of earthquake damage, fell 11 percent to 866
yen in Tokyo trading today. The benchmark Nikkei 225 Stock
Average also declined 11 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
