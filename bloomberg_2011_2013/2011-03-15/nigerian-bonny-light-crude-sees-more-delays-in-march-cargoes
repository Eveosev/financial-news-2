Loadings of benchmark Nigerian
Bonny Light crude have been delayed further with two more
cargoes deferred to April from March, according to a revised
April loading program obtained by Bloomberg News.  This will bring the total cargoes for loading in April to
seven, including four new shipments and one earlier deferral,
the plan showed. Each cargo is 950,000 barrels.  One month ago, shipments of Bonny Light for March were
deferred by eight to 10 days, with one of them postponed to
April. Royal Dutch Shell Plc said Feb. 16 its Nigerian unit
“advised new crude oil loading dates for February and March
2011 due to operational reasons.”  A London-based Shell official, who declined to be
identified, said today that the company’s statement still
reflected its position.  A revised loading schedule for March is not available. The
original plan showed seven cargoes to be loaded this month.  Bonny Light’s premium to Dated Brent, the benchmark for
European and African crude, fell by 2 cents to $3.15 from
yesterday’s two-year high of $3.17 a barrel, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
