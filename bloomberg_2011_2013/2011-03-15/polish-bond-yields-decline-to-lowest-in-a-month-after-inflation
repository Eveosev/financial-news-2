Polish bonds rallied, pushing two-
and five-year yields to their lowest in a month, after a report
showed inflation in February was slower than analysts expected.  The yield on the government note maturing in April 2016
fell 5 basis points to 5.799 percent as of 4:05 p.m. in Warsaw,
its lowest since Feb. 14. Zero-coupon securities due in January
2013 yielded 5.048 percent, also 5 basis points down and the
lowest since Feb. 14.  Polish inflation was unchanged at 3.6 percent in February,
matching a revised January reading, the Warsaw-based  Central
Statistical Office  said in a statement today. That compares with
the 3.9 percent median estimate of 24 economists surveyed by
Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
