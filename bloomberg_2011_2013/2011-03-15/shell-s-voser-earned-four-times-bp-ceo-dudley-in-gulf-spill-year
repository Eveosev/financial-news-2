  Peter Voser , chief executive
officer of  Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA) , earned four times as much as  BP Plc (BP/)  CEO  Robert Dudley  last year as BP suffered from the Gulf
of Mexico oil spill.  Voser earned $7.3 million in 2010 in salary and bonus as
 operations exceeded targets  and the company achieved its best
safety record, Shell’s annual report showed today. Dudley earned
$1.7 million, foregoing his bonus after the company took
responsibility for the Macondo well disaster that killed 11
workers and started the worst U.S. spill.  Shell aims to increase output of oil and gas by 12 percent
by 2014 while BP this year declined to set production targets
following more than $20 billion asset sales to help pay for the
spill.  Tony Hayward , the BP CEO who lost his job following the
accident, was paid $6 million in 2009, more than Voser.  “2010 was a good year for Shell,” Voser wrote in the
report. “We are delivering on our strategy, which is based on
performance now, growth from new projects and creating options
for the future.”  Voser’s pay last year almost doubled from the $4.6 million
he received in 2009, when he was promoted to CEO. Simon Henry,
Voser’s successor as chief financial officer, saw his earnings
double to $3.8 million as he rose from an executive vice-
president position.  Shell froze management salaries in 2009 after shareholders
objected to pay awards in which executives received bonuses even
after performance targets were missed. Voser and Henry will
receive salary increases of 3.3 percent and 4.7 percent
respectively this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
