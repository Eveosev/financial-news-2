  Japan ’s earthquake and tsunami were
partially to blame for a 60 percent drop in Hollywood’s
international box office last weekend, according to one Wall
Street analyst.  Tuna Amobi, an analyst with Standard & Poor’s, said in a
research note that DreamWorks Animation SKG Inc.’s superheroes
comedy “Megamind” was “seemingly dislocated” and didn’t open
as planned in Japan.  Japan’s $2.7 billion box office represents about 9.5
percent of the international market, Amobi estimated. Among
other movies “with possible disaster-related fallout” are  Walt
Disney Co. (DIS) ’s animated “Tangled,”  News Corp. (NWSA) ’s third
installment of the Fox fantasy film “The Chronicles of Narnia”
and Weinstein Co.’s Oscar-winning “The King’s Speech,” he
wrote.  Paul McGuire, a Warner Bros. spokesman, confirmed a Los
Angeles Times report that the studio, a unit of  Time Warner
Inc. (TWX) , withdrew its Anthony Hopkins supernatural drama “The
Rite,” which was scheduled to debut in Japan on March 19.  It also pulled Clint Eastwood’s “Hereafter” from
theaters, as it opens with a scene depicting a tsunami. The
Times reported that Sony Corp. was considering delaying the
opening of its science-fiction epic “Battle: Los Angeles”
because it features an alien destruction of the Los Angeles
coastline.  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
