corporate bonds from non-payment rose the most in more than two
years, according to traders of credit-default swaps.  The Markit iTraxx Japan index jumped 35 basis points to
145.5 basis points as of 10:04 a.m. in  Tokyo , according to
prices from Deutsche Bank AG. The risk benchmark is on course
for its biggest one-day increase since Feb. 17, 2009, prices
