The following is the text of the
U.S. import and export  price index  report from the Bureau of
Labor Statistics.  U.S. IMPORT AND EXPORT PRICE INDEXES - FEBRUARY 2011  U.S. import prices rose 1.4 percent in February, the  U.S.
Bureau of Labor Statistics  reported today, following a similar
1.3 percent advance in January. The price index for U.S.
exports increased 1.2 percent in February after rising 1.3
percent the previous month. Higher agricultural and
nonagricultural export prices each contributed to the overall
advance in February.  Imports
All Imports:  Prices for imports rose 1.4 percent in February,
continuing a five-month trend of monthly increases greater
than 1.0 percent. Import prices advanced 6.9 percent for the
year ended in February, driven by a 7.0 percent jump for the
index over the past five months. The year-over-year rise in
February was the largest 12-month advance since an 8.5 percent
increase for the year ended in May 2010. Higher prices for
both fuel and nonfuel import prices contributed to the
increase in February and over the past year.  Fuel Imports:  Fuel prices increased 4.0 percent in February following a
3.5 percent advance the previous month. Rising prices for both
petroleum and natural gas factored into the February increase,
advancing 3.7 percent and 12.1 percent, respectively. Fuel
prices rose 18.6 percent over the past 12 months, led by a
20.6 percent jump in petroleum prices. Despite rising 23.4
percent over the past two months, however, natural  gas prices 
declined 10.9 percent between February 2010 and February 2011.  All Imports Excluding Fuel:  Nonfuel import prices advanced 0.3 percent in February
after a 0.7 percent increase in January. Higher prices for
nonfuel industrial supplies and materials; foods, feeds, and
beverages; and each of the major finished goods categories all
contributed to the rise in nonfuel prices in February. The
price index for nonfuel imports increased 3.6 percent the past
year, the largest 12-month advance since a 4.8 percent
increase between October 2007 and October 2008. The current 12-
month rise was mostly driven by a 12.9 percent advance for
nonfuel industrial supplies and materials prices and a 15.8
percent increase for foods, feeds, and beverages prices.  Exports
All Exports:  Export prices rose 1.2 percent in January following a 1.3
percent advance the previous month. The index has risen at
least 0.6 percent every month since a 0.2 percent decline in
July 2010. The price index for overall exports increased 8.6
percent over the past year, the largest 12-month advance since
a 10.2 percent rise for the year ended in July 2008.  Agricultural Exports:  Agricultural exports advanced 4.4 percent in February and
33.5 percent over the past 12 months. The price index for
agricultural exports is at the highest level since the index
was first published in March 1985, and the year-over-year
increase in February was the largest since a 39.7 percent
surge for the July 2007-08 period. Rising cotton prices, up
15.7 percent in February and 153.5 percent over the past year,
had the largest contribution to both the February and 12-month
advances for agricultural prices. Prices for corn, wheat, and
soybeans, which rose 7.9 percent, 11.0 percent, and 3.4
percent, respectively, in February, also continued an upward
trend.  All Exports Excluding Agriculture:  Nonagricultural prices increased 0.9 percent in February
following a 1.0 percent advance the previous month. Rising
prices in February for nonagricultural industrial supplies and
materials prices and  consumer goods , up 2.6 percent and 0.5
percent, respectively, more than offset a 0.3 percent drop in
capital goods prices. The price index for nonagricultural
exports increased 6.2 percent for the year ended in February.  SELECTED FEBRUARY HIGHLIGHTS  Import Prices
