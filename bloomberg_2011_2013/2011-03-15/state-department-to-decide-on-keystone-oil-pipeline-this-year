The U.S. State Department plans to
decide by the end of the year whether to approve a  TransCanada
Corp. (TRP)  pipeline that would deliver crude oil from the oil sands
of Canada to the U.S. Gulf Coast.  The department, in a news release today, said it plans to
seek public comment in mid-April on a supplemental environmental
impact study for the Keystone XL oil pipeline. The 1,700-mile
pipeline would cut through Montana,  South Dakota , Nebraska,
Kansas, Oklahoma and Texas.  Republicans in Congress have pushed for swift approval of
the pipeline, which they said would help keep energy costs down
and help create 118,000 jobs.  Environmentalists and some Democrats have opposed the
project.  Friends of the Earth, an environmental group, said it is
concerned the State Department won’t allow time for a thorough
review of the pipeline’s impact. Among its concerns, the group
said in an e-mail, is the pipeline’s effect on air pollution,  greenhouse gases , and an aquifer in Nebraska that provides
drinking water for 2 million people.  James Millar, a TransCanada spokesman, said the company was
preparing a statement about the State Department announcement.  Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said in October that the
department was “inclined” to approve the pipeline to reduce
reliance on crude from the Middle East.  Keystone XL would be the third leg of a $12 billion, 3,800-
mile network to move crude from western Canada to the U.S.
Midwest and Gulf Coast.  To contact the reporter on this story:
