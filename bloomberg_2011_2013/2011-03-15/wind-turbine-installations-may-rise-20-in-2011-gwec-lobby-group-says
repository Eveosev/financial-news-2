Wind turbine installations may rise
20 percent this year worldwide and double by 2015, the Global
Wind Energy Council said in a statement today.  Capacity to produce electricity from the wind may rise by
40 gigawatts in 2011 from 294.4 gigawatts at the end of last
year, the lobby group said in a statement from Brussels. By
2015, it forecasts 450 gigawatts.  “2010 was a tough year for our industry, but 2011 is
looking up,” said Steve Sawyer, secretary general for GWEC.
“We’ve paid the price for the 2008 and 2009 financial crisis.
Now we’re back on track.”  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
