  India ’s benchmark stock index fell
the most in a week as investors withdrew from riskier assets
after  Japan  said the danger of further leaks from a nuclear
plant damaged by the nation’s biggest earthquake was increasing.  Tata Power Co., the nation’s largest non-state electricity
generator, sank 2.8 percent, the most in more than five weeks.
Japanese Prime Minister  Naoto Kan  appealed for calm as he said
the danger of more leaks was rising at the crippled facility.
Investment into India from Japan may be hurt in the aftermath of
the temblor, Chakravarthy Rangarajan, head of the Indian
premier’s Economic Advisory Council, said.  Maruti Suzuki India
Ltd. (MSIL) , a unit of Japan’s Suzuki Motor Co., lost 3.6 percent.  The Bombay Stock Exchange’s Sensitive Index, or Sensex,
lost 245.72, or 1.3 percent, to 18,193.76, according to
preliminary closing prices at 3:30 p.m. in Mumbai, poised for
its steepest decline since March 7. The S&P CNX Nifty Index on
the National Stock Exchange dropped 1.3 percent to 5,460.80,
while its March futures settled at 5,463. The BSE 200 Index
retreated 1.4 percent to 2,234.30.  To contact the reporter on this story:
