Great Wall Motor Co., China’s
largest maker of  pickup trucks , said profit last year more than
doubled as government incentives stoked demand for vehicles.  Net income rose to 2.7 billion yuan ($411 million), or 0.99
yuan a share, from 1.02 billion, or 0.37 yuan, in 2009 according
to a Hong Kong stock exchange filing yesterday evening. Sales
gained 79 percent to 22.2 billion yuan. The company proposed a
final dividend of 0.2 yuan a share.  Sales at Great Wall, maker of the Hover H sport-utility
vehicle, were boosted last year by government subsidies and tax
cuts in the world’s largest auto market. The incentives helped
China’s vehicle sales climb 32 percent to a record 18.06
million, according to the  China  Association of Automobile
Manufacturers.  “Sport-utility vehicles have been selling very well,
outperforming the market, and Great Wall has been able to enjoy
good growth in other key products, such as pickup trucks and
sedans,” Alice Leung, Hong Kong-based deputy head of research
at ICBC International Research Ltd., said before the statement.  The Baoding, Hebei province-based company said unit sales
last year increased 73 percent to 363,482 vehicles.  Great Wall said this month it plans to spend 3 billion yuan
over the next five years to develop more than 30 new models,
adding to its existing lineup of Voleex C30 cars and Wingle
pickups. The company, China’s third-largest vehicle exporter,
sold 55,000 units overseas last year, according to its website.  Buy Local  General Manager Wang Fengying, a member of the advisory
body to China’s National People’s Congress, said March 6 that
government agencies should take the lead in buying more locally
developed automobiles to boost  consumer confidence  in domestic
brands. She also called on the government to give financial
support to auto exporters to offset a rising yuan that is making
them less competitive.  Great Wall, which exports to regions including the Middle
East,  Africa  and  South America , had said it planned to sell
60,000 vehicles overseas last year. It will start a 4.2 billion
yuan passenger-car plant in the northern Chinese city of Tianjin
that will raise production capacity by 300,000 vehicles by 2015.  Great Wall fell 3.2 percent to HK$12.22 in Hong Kong
trading yesterday, before the announcement. The stock has risen
27 percent this year, compared with a 1.6 percent drop in the
benchmark  Hang Seng  index.  --Liza Lin. Editor: Chua Kong Ho, Joshua Fellman  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
