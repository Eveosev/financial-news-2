A lawyer for a defunct ballet
dancers’ union was accused of performing a pas de deux with its
checkbook and stealing about $150,000.  Leonard Leibowitz, 72, was charged in federal court in  New
York  with embezzling from the Independent Artists of America by
writing checks from its coffers to himself, his law firm and his
ex-wife, according to a press release from the office of
Manhattan U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara.  The union, which Leibowitz helped start, represented
American Ballet Theatre dancers from 1994 until 2007. The
dancers are now part of the  American Guild of Musical Artists ,
which trumpeted the arrest with its own press release.  Leibowitz currently represents striking  Detroit Symphony
Orchestra  musicians. His lawyer, Jeffrey Rabin, didn’t return a
call for comment last night.  The checks Leibowitz wrote totaled $350,000 over eight
years, exceeding earnings due to him from a monthly retainer by
about $150,000, the prosecutors’ release said.  Leibowitz also was charged with falsifying annual reports
in connection with signatures that were allegedly forged at his
request, the release said. The reports listed the money advanced
to him as a loan.  When confronted by the union’s leadership, Leibowitz said
he needed the funds because he owed the government money and
because his children attended private school, according to the
prosecutors. He told the union leadership that he realized by
2000 he borrowed more than he could repay, the release said.  Charges filed in 2009 over the same check writing were
dismissed. Carly Sullivan, a spokeswoman for the U.S. Attorney’s
office, declined to discuss why because the information isn’t
public.  The case is U.S. v. Leibowitz, 11-cr-191, U.S. District
Court, Southern District of New York   Manhattan ).  To contact the writer on this story:
