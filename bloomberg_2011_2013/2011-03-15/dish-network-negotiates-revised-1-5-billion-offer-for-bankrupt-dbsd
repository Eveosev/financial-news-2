  Dish Network Corp. (DISH) , the satellite-
television provider, negotiated a revised offer to acquire DBSD
North America Inc., a satellite communications company, after
DBSD sought competing bids.  DBSD, which is reorganizing in bankruptcy, will seek court
approval today for the Dish investment, valued at $1.5 billion,
Reston, Virginia-based DBSD said in a filing today with the U.S.
Bankruptcy Court in  New York .  The Dish investment provides the “best possible terms of a
transaction,” DBSD said in court papers. DBSD had valued the
earlier agreement with Englewood, Colorado-based Dish at about
$1 billion.  U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Robert Gerber on March 2 postponed a
hearing on DBSD’s request for approval of the previous Dish
agreement after Harbinger Capital Partners and Solus Alternative
Asset Management said they wanted to acquire the company.  DBSD got a competing proposal on March 10 from another
bidder that it didn’t name for a $1.14 billion investment in the
company, according to court papers. The bid was later improved,
DBSD said.  DBSD said it negotiated improvements to the earlier Dish
agreement. The changes include $325 million to be paid to DBSD’s
parent, Kirkland, Washington-based ICO Global Communications
(Holdings) Ltd., according to court papers.  ICO said in a statement that it has agreed to support
Dish’s investment.  The case is In re DBSD North America Inc., 09-13061,  U.S.
Bankruptcy Court , Southern District of New York   Manhattan ).  To contact the reporter on this story:
