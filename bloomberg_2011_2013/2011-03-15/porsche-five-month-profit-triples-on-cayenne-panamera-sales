Porsche SE’s car-making division
tripled profit in its shortened 2010 fiscal year as deliveries
of the Cayenne sport-utility vehicle and Panamera sedan surged.  Earnings before interest and tax for the August to December
period rose to 688 million euros ($960 million) from 227 million
a year earlier, the Stuttgart, Germany-based company said in an
e-mailed statement today. Five-month revenue increased 59
percent to 3.87 billion euros.  Chief Executive Officer  Matthias Mueller  aims to double
global sales to about 200,000 cars and SUVs by 2018, taking
advantage of resources at  Volkswagen AG (VOW)  following a planned
combination with  Europe ’s biggest automaker. The German sports-
car maker’s five-month deliveries rose 57 percent to 40,446
vehicles, Porsche said Feb. 28.  “Porsche is blessed with rising demand from around the
world,”  Daniel Schwarz , a Commerzbank AG analyst in  Frankfurt 
who recommends buying Porsche stock, said before today’s
release. “Production is running close to capacity limits.”  Five-month sales of the Cayenne, Porsche’s best-selling
model, doubled to 20,770 SUVs following the introduction last
year of the third generation of the model. Deliveries of the
four-door Panamera advanced 44 percent to 9,385, while the 911
model increased 13 percent to 6,255.  Porsche is reporting five-month results to shift in 2011 to
calendar-year reporting to align its operations with Wolfsburg,
Germany-based Volkswagen. Porsche’s fiscal year previously ended
on July 31.  Cajun Model  Porsche’s next model, the Cajun compact SUV, will be based
on the platform of VW’s Audi Q5 model and may come to market by
about 2014. The carmaker’s supervisory board is meeting today
and will vote to build the Cajun at Porsche’s Leipzig factory, a
person familiar with the matter said last month.  Volkswagen gave Porsche authority last November to run
sports-car development across the group. Adding Porsche as its
10th brand may help Volkswagen in its effort to overtake  Toyota
Motor Corp. (7203)  in sales and profitability by 2018, Commerzbank’s
Schwarz said.  “VW’s vast technology creates new opportunities that
Porsche would otherwise not have,” according to Schwarz. “The
Cajun may not yield the margin of a Cayenne but Porsche will
still make it profitable.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
