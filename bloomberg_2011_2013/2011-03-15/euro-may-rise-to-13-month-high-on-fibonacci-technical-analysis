The euro may rise to a 13-month
high against the dollar after crossing a key Fibonacci level,
according to GaitameOnline Co.  The shared currency closed at $1.3992 yesterday, above the
$1.3958 level that represents a 50 percent Fibonacci retracement
of the currency’s decline from $1.6038 on July 15, 2008, to
$1.1877 on June 7, 2010.  “It’s very important whether the euro will break that
level,” said Masakazu Sato, a Tokyo-based foreign-exchange
adviser at the foreign exchange margin company. A break above
$1.3958 signals the euro may continue gains toward the 61.8
percent Fibonacci retracement point at $1.4448, he said.  The 17-nation currency hasn’t traded above $1.4448 since
Jan. 15, 2010. The euro was at $1.3997 as of 9:25 a.m. in  Tokyo .
That level is also close to the currency’s 200-day average on a
weekly chart, which is another bullish sign, Sato said.  Fibonacci analysis is based on a theory that prices rise or
fall by certain percentages after reaching a high or low. A
break above resistance, or below support, indicates a currency
may move to the next level.  In  technical analysis , investors and analysts study charts
of trading patterns and prices to forecast changes in a
security, commodity, currency or index.  To contact the reporters on this story:
