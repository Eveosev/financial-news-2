  Lazard Ltd. (LAZ) , the largest
independent merger adviser, hired Yan Lan as a managing director
and head of greater  China  investment banking.  Yan was previously at  Gide Loyrette Nouel , a Paris-based
law firm, where she advised on mergers and acquisitions and
foreign direct-investment projects in China, Lazard said today
in a statement. She also advised Chinese companies on investment
projects in Africa and Europe and was a partner in charge of the
Beijing office, Lazard said.  Lazard entered China in 2001 when it opened an office in  Hong Kong  and expanded to Beijing in 2006, according to the
statement. Hamilton, Bermuda-based Lazard has provided advice on
$50.9 billion of deals this year, ranking it seventh on the
financial advisory league tables, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  “There is now an increasing demand for independent
financial advice from Chinese companies seeking overseas
expansion, as well as from foreign companies looking to invest
in China,” Lazard Chief Executive Officer Kenneth M. Jacobs
said in the statement.  Yan received a doctorate in political science from the
Graduate Institute of International Studies, Geneva, and a
master of laws in international law from Beijing University,
according to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
