U.K. Parliament Energy and Climate
Committee Chairman  Tim Yeo  told Sky News in an interview that
Germany is “panicking” and has “overreacted” by closing its
nuclear power plants, and he said it wouldn’t be “sensible”
for the U.K. to do the same.  The U.K.’s decision to keep its nuclear reactors running
was the “right” and “responsible” decision because the
circumstances that caused the “apocalyptic” situation in  Japan 
“couldn’t possibly occur” in the U.K., Yeo said today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
