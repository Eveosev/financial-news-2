Malawi, the world’s biggest
producer of burley tobacco, opened the 2011 season
yesterday with President Bingu wa Mutharika asking buyers
to offer better prices.  “This year we have very good rains and with good care
of the crop, we are sure of getting more revenue,”
Mutharika said on MBC Radio during a live broadcast of the
opening ceremony in the capital, Lilongwe. “The buyers
should realize that farmers can only continue growing
tobacco if they are paid prices beyond the cost of
production,” said Mutharika.  Tobacco earnings fell 5 percent to $410.6 million in
the year through Nov. 19 because of a drop in sales, the
Bank of Malawi said Dec. 8. Prices averaged $1.90 per
kilogram(2.2 pounds), higher than the $1.88 received in
2009, with prices declining in the second half of the
season because of delayed confirmation from the buying
companies’ customers and increased production in  Zimbabwe .  Minimum prices for burley have been set at $1.80 per
kilogram, down from $2 a kilogram set last year, Daily
Times reported yesterday, citing Tobacco Control Commission
Chief Executive Officer Bruce Munthali. The price reduction
follows a drop in demand for the leaves by buyers, Munthali
told the Blantyre-based newspaper.
Malawi began setting minimum prices for the various grades
of tobacco in 2007, after accusing merchants of putting
growers out of business by offering them lower prices.  Tobacco is Malawi’s biggest foreign-exchange earner,
accounting for 60 percent of all revenue earned from
abroad.  To contact the reporter on this story:
