The Australian dollar was little
changed after the  Reserve Bank  said it kept the overnight cash
rate unchanged this month as slower borrowing by households and
businesses offsets a mining investment boom.  The currency was at $1.0087 as of 11:33 a.m. in Sydney from
$1.0092 before the RBA published minutes from the March 1
meeting.  To contact the reporter on this story:
