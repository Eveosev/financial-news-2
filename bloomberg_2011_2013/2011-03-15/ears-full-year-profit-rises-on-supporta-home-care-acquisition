  Mears Group Plc (MER) , which maintains
low-income housing for U.K. government clients, said profit rose
5.7 percent last year as it added people-care contracts through
the acquisition of Supporta Plc.  Net income was 14.76 million pounds ($23.7 million), or
16.57 pence per share, compared with 13.96 million pounds, or
17.94 pence, in 2009, the Gloucester, England-based company said
in a statement.  Mears acquired Supporta in February 2010 to expand in home
care, a move that also gave it more business in central  London .
Further government contracts were taken on from collapsed
companies such as Connaught Plc.  The Supporta acquisition “gives us coverage inside the
M25” London orbital road, Chief Executive Officer  David Miles 
said in a telephone interview. “It also gives us national
coverage.”  The company’s shares fell 21.75 pence, or 7.2 percent, to
280.25 pence at the 4:30 p.m. close in London. They have
declined 7.5 percent so far this year, giving the company a
market value of 238 million pounds.  Miles said Mears expects 10 million pounds in revenue this
year from its venture with  Centrica Plc (CNA) ’s British Gas unit for
energy-efficiency projects such as heat-pump and solar-panel
installation in social housing. The agreement was signed last
September.  Miles, formerly the chief operating officer, became chief
executive in November.  Social-housing sales gained 7 percent to 379.4 million
pounds, while home-care revenue increased 67 percent to 100.4
million pounds, the company said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
