  CEZ AS (CEZ) , the biggest power utility
in the  Czech Republic , rallied the most in almost two months as
electricity prices in neighboring Germany climbed after the
government decided to shut some nuclear reactors.  The state-run company rose 2.1 percent, the most since Jan.
21, to 819.9 koruna at its 4:24 p.m. close in  Prague . The gain
helped the PX index, where CEZ has a 25 percent weighting, pare
earlier losses and close down 0.1 percent.  Electricity prices jumped to the highest in more than two
years in Germany after Chancellor Angela Merkel said the
country’s seven oldest reactors will stay off line for three
months following explosions at an atomic plant in  Japan .  “CEZ could benefit from the shutdown of German reactors,
and investors were also reassured by the industry minister’s
words,” Miroslav Adamkovic, an analyst at Komercni Banka AS,
the unit of Societe Generale SA in Prague, wrote in a report
today.  Czech Industry and Trade Minister Martin Kocourek told
reporters in Prague today radiation leaks in Japan should have
no impact on plans to expand CEZ’s Temelin nuclear power plant.  To contact the reporter on this story:
