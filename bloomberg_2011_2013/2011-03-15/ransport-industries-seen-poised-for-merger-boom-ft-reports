Transport businesses are about to
see a boom in mergers and acquisitions, spurred by cheaper debt,
higher fuel prices and the drive to achieve global scale,
according to an analysis by KPMG, the Financial Times reported.  Targets include Virgin Atlantic Airways Ltd., where
Deutsche Bank AG is carrying out a strategic review and  Richard Branson , the main shareholder, has indicated readiness to cede
control, and BAA, the operator of Londonâ€™s Heathrow Airport, of
which  Ferrovial SA (FER) , the Spanish owner, plans to sell 10 percent,
the newspaper said.  The number of transactions in global transport and
logistics rose 13 percent last year, to 892, and their value
more than tripled, to $892 billion, according to figures from
Dealogic, the FT said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
