Australian mortgage delinquencies
will climb in the first quarter of 2011, driven up by the impact
of households’ Christmas spending and a November interest rate
increase,  Fitch Ratings  said.  Mortgages that were more than 30 days delinquent rose to
1.37 percent in the fourth quarter from 1.3 percent in the
previous three months, according to the ratings company’s Dinkum
Index, released today. Mortgage payments that were more than 90
days late climbed to 0.54 percent in the last three months of
2010 from 0.48 percent the previous quarter, driven by
stagnation in the Perth and Brisbane housing markets, Fitch said.  “Arrears unexpectedly increased in Q410, mainly as a
result of more delinquent borrowers migrating into the 90+ days
arrears bucket, as they were unable to cure their delinquent
status,” James Zanesi, associate director for structured
finance at Fitch, wrote in an e-mailed release.  The central bank’s November rate increase, which hasn’t yet
affected mortgage performance, floods in Queensland state in
January and holiday spending are expected to contribute to
higher delinquencies in the first quarter, Zanesi said.  Australian home loan approvals fell in January by the most
in a year, as the  Reserve Bank  of  Australia ’s seven interest
rate increases since October 2009, the floods and expectations
of a carbon tax took their toll on potential borrowers. Property
prices in Perth fell a seasonally adjusted 1.9 percent in the
fourth quarter, and Brisbane prices dropped 0.5 percent,
according to real estate researcher  RP Data .  Still, overall, the Australian residential mortgage-backed  securities market  remains stable, with employment,
serviceability of mortgages and  home prices  holding up, Fitch
said. A  stress test  conducted by the company last year found
that Australian banks and insurers can weather a 30 percent drop
in home prices and a mortgage default rate of as much as 6
percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
