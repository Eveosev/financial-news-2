U.S. stocks escaped the brunt of a
global selloff that sent Tokyo shares to their worst two-day
decline since 1987, paring losses as Japanese officials made
progress in stabilizing damaged nuclear reactors and the  Federal
Reserve  said the American economy is improving.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index fell 1.1 percent at 4 p.m.
New York time, rebounding from a 2.7 percent slump, even as the
MSCI All-Country World Index of shares in 45 nations lost 2.3
percent. The benchmark measure for U.S. equities retreated to
its lowest level of the day six minutes after trading began.
Raw-material, energy and industrial shares in the  S&P 500 
advanced more than 2.2 percent from that point.  “The more positive tone of the Fed brought some relief
especially on a jittery day like this one,” said  Richard Sichel , who oversees $1.5 billion as chief investment officer at
Philadelphia Trust Co. “Still, there’s an overhang from
exogenous factors. Yes, we’ve had a big drop, but I wouldn’t
jump in right away. I would wait until the market calms down to
take a fresher look at some stocks and industries.”  The S&P 500 closed at 1,281.87. The  Dow Jones Industrial
Average  slid 137.74 points, or 1.2 percent, to 11,855.42 after
plunging 296.91 points. Japan’s  Nikkei 225 (NKY)  Stock Average fell 11
percent today and is down 16 percent this week, the biggest two-
day drop since the October 1987 stock market crash.  GE Slumps    General Electric Co. (GE) , which is in talks to sell reactors to  India , fell 1.6 percent.  Dow Chemical Co. (DOW)  and  Anadarko Petroleum
Corp. (APC)  slumped at least 1.7 percent.  Intel Corp. (INTC)  slid 3.2
percent, the most in the Dow, after Nomura Holdings Inc. cut its
rating for the chipmaker.  Aflac Inc. (AFL) , the insurance company
which gets most of its revenue in Japan, sank 5.6 percent.  U.S. stocks pared losses as radiation readings fell below
harmful levels at reactors in Japan and as the Fed said the
American economy is on “firmer footing,” while reaffirming
plans to buy $600 billion of Treasuries through June. Thomas Lee, U.S. equity strategist at JPMorgan Chase & Co., and Mary Ann Bartels of Bank of America Corp. both said the slide in the
S&P 500 may be a buying opportunity.  The  iShares MSCI Japan Index Fund (EWJ)  tracking 323 securities
fell 0.2 percent to $10.03, paring an earlier drop of 8.1
percent. That compares with the 9.1 percent plunge in the MSCI
Japan Index earlier, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  ‘Black-Swan Events’  “We’re getting black-swan events almost every week now,”
said  Jeffrey Saut , chief investment strategist at Raymond James
& Associates in  St. Petersburg ,  Florida , who helps manage $252
billion. “The risks stemming from the Japanese nuclear disaster
to the Middle East turmoil are unquantifiable. What happens if
we have a meltdown?,” he said. Volatility is on the rise.’’  The Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility Index, or
VIX, which measures the cost of using options as insurance
against declines in the S&P 500, surged 15 percent to 24.32, the
highest level since Aug. 31. The index’s 2011 closing low was
15.46 on Jan. 14, as the S&P 500 advanced to its highest level
in two years.  The S&P 500 has fallen 4.6 percent since rising to this
year’s high on Feb. 18 amid unrest in Libya and the Middle East
and concern about the aftermath of  Japan ’s worst earthquake. The
decline pared the gain in 2011 to 1.9 percent. Still, the
measure has risen 89 percent from its March 2009 low amid
government stimulus measures and as corporate earnings beat
analysts’ estimates for eight straight quarters.  Six Reactors       GE sank 1.6 percent to $19.61. The Fukushima plant consists
of six reactors based on GE designs, three of which were built
by the company, according to its  website .  Energy and raw-materials producers in the S&P 500 declined.
The S&P’s GSCI spot index of 24 commodities dropped 3.8 percent,
falling for a fourth day, the longest losing streak since Aug.
24. Oil tumbled the most in almost five months, closing at
$97.18 a barrel.  Dow Chemical, the largest U.S. chemical maker, declined 1.8
percent to $35.96. Anadarko fell 1.7 percent to $75.87.  Intel retreated 3.2 percent to $20.18. The world’s largest
chipmaker was cut to “neutral” from “buy” at Nomura, which
cited weak personal-computer demand.  Aflac led declines among the 22 companies in the S&P 500
Insurance Index. Aflac declined 5.6 percent to $50.89.  Hartford
Financial Services Group Inc. (HIG)  dropped 4.6 percent to $25.60.  Stock-index futures maintained losses before exchanges
opened even as a report showed that manufacturing in the New
York region accelerated in March at the fastest rate in nine
months. The Federal Reserve Bank of New York’s general economic
index rose to 17.5 from 15.4. Economists projected an increase
to 16.1, based on the median forecast in a Bloomberg News
survey. Readings greater than zero signal expansion in the so-
called Empire State Index.  Separately, the Labor Department said that prices of goods
imported into the U.S. rose more than forecast in February, led
by gains in crude oil and food. The 1.4 percent increase in the
import-price index exceeded the 0.9 percent median forecast in a
survey and followed a 1.3 percent rise in January. Prices
excluding fuel rose 0.3 percent. Food costs over the past 12
months posted the biggest gain since records began in 1977.  To contact the reporter on this story:
