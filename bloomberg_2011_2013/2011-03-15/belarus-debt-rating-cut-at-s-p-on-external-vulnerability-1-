Belarus’s debt rating was cut by  Standard & Poor’s  by one notch to B, five steps below investment
grade, from B+ as dwindling reserve holdings increased its
“external vulnerability.” The outlook is negative, S&P said.  “The rating actions reflect the country’s heightened
vulnerability to negative external financing trends because of
the deterioration in usable reserves,” S&P analysts led by Ana Mates in  London  said in a statement today. Belarus faces
“uncertainties” with its “external funding gap in 2011 and
the corresponding pressures on the exchange rate.”  The former Soviet republic, wedged between European Union
member Poland and  Russia , has seen its foreign reserves dwindle
to $3.4 billion in December, a decrease of 36 percent from a
high of $5.3 billion in April 2010, International Monetary Fund
data compiled by Bloomberg show. The IMF agreed to lend Belarus
$3.5 billion in 2009 after export revenue tumbled during the
global financial crisis.  Belarus sold its debut dollar bonds last year, offering a
total of $1 billion, and borrowed $800 million in seven-year
debt in January. The yield on 2018 securities today jumped 62
basis points to a record high of 10.643 percent.  The country’s 2012 bonds denominated in Russian rubles
fell, pushing the yield 49 basis points higher to 9.94 percent,
the highest since the notes were sold in December.  Sufficient Resources  The central bank said today it has sufficient resources to
ensure “gradual moves and predictability” of the Belarusian
ruble, adding it has no plans for a “sharp”  currency
devaluation . The regulator devalued the domestic currency by
about a fifth in January 2009.    Fitch Ratings  cut the debt rating outlook for seven
Belarusian banks yesterday after the country’s finances
“weakened significantly.”  The Washington-based IMF urged policy makers in Belarus on
March 9 to curb spending and boost  interest rates  to narrow a
current account deficit that reached 16 percent of GDP.  The IMF  expects  the Belarusian economy to expand at a
slower pace this year, gaining 6.9 percent compared with an
estimated 7.6 percent in 2010, as consumer-price growth surges
to an average of 11 percent.  Belarus will probably continue to finance itself this year
through foreign direct investments and external borrowing,
according to S&P. The nation’s total sovereign debt, including
state guarantees, reached 39 percent of gross domestic product
at the end of last year and may continue to gain 5 percent to 6
percent of GDP a year, the ratings service estimates.  External Financing Gap  “Beyond 2011, a more flexible  exchange rate  and tighter
fiscal and monetary policies likely will be necessary to narrow
the external financing gap and retain external investor
confidence,” S&P analysts wrote.  The Eurasian Economic Community, a grouping of post-Soviet
nations, will lend $400 million to Belarus from its anti-crisis
fund to help overhaul the nation’s road network and may provide
another loan to help finance its current-account deficit,
Interfax reported today, citing Sergei Shatalov, the fund’s
managing director.  To contact the reporter on this story:
