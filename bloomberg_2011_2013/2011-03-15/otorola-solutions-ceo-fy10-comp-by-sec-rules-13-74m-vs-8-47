Motorola Solutions Inc. and
Motorola Mobility Holdings Inc., the two companies that split
from each other this year, increased the pay of the chief
executive officers who oversaw the separation.    Greg Brown , who runs Motorola Solutions, a maker of bar-
code scanners, walkie-talkies and other emergency-communication
equipment, earned $13.7 million in 2010, up from $8.47 million
in 2009, according to a regulatory filing today. Motorola
Mobility CEO Sanjay Jha, whose business makes mobile phones,
earned $13 million in 2010, up from $3.79 million a year ago.  The company, formerly called Motorola Inc., announced its
plans to split in March 2008 under pressure from billionaire
investor  Carl Icahn . Icahn argued the mobile-phone division,
which makes smartphones that run on Google Inc.’s Android
software, was undervalued. He pushed for it to be separated to
stem customer losses to Apple Inc. and BlackBerry maker  Research
In Motion Ltd. (RIMM)   Motorola Solutions, based in Schaumburg,  Illinois , fell 48
cents, or 1.2 percent, to $40.51 in New York Stock Exchange
composite trading at 4 p.m. Motorola Mobility, based in
Libertyville, Illinois, declined $1.23, or 5 percent, to $23.46.  To contact the reporter on this story:
