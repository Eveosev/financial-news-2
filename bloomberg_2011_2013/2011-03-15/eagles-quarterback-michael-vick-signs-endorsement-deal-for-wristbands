Philadelphia Eagles quarterback  Michael Vick  picked up his second sponsorship deal in three
months, signing on as endorser for the Core Synergy titanium-
infused silicone wristband.  Vick, 30, joins fellow National Football League players
Maurkice Pouncey of the Pittsburgh Steelers and A.J. Hawk of the
Super Bowl champion  Green Bay Packers  as representatives for
Lutte Licensing Group, which makes and distributes the  Core
Synergy  bands.  Vick lost sponsors including Nike Inc., the world’s largest
athletic shoemaker, after pleading guilty to federal dog-
fighting charges in 2007. He was voted the NFL’s Comeback Player
of the Year in 2010 after regaining a starting job in his second
season with the Eagles since serving an 18-month jail sentence.  Vick in January signed a multiyear endorsement contract
with Unequal Technologies to serve as a spokesman for the
company’s products, including thigh pads that he wore last
season. Vick completed 63 percent of his passes for 3,018 yards
and 21 touchdowns, all career highs. He also rushed for 676
yards and nine touchdowns.  To contact the reporter on this story:
