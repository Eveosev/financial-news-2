  China  will start reporting quarter-
on-quarter economic data including gross domestic product from
April, said  Ma Jiantang , head of National Bureau of Statistics.  The State Council, or cabinet, has given its approval for
first quarter figures to be published based on comparisons with
the previous quarter, Ma said in an interview with the official
China Information News that was posted on the bureau’s  website 
today. The bureau currently only gives comparisons with the same
period a year earlier.  Industrial production, fixed-asset investment and retail
sales figures for the January to March period will also be
covered by the change, he said.  The statistics bureau is due to publish economic data for
the first quarter next month.  --Sophie Leung, Zheng Lifei. Editors: Nerys Avery,  John Liu   To contact the reporter on this story:
