the biggest increase since Oct. 27. Rising Nonferrous Metals
Share Co. (600259 CH) surged 10 percent to 75.83 yuan.    China , which controls about 95 percent of global shipments
of rare earths, may start importing some of the material to meet
rising domestic demand, Liu Junhua, the deputy secretary for
Baotou Rare Earth High-Tech Industrial Development Zone

earths has increased as much as 200 percent in the last 12
months, with almost half of that increase coming since the start
of the year, he said.  Aluminum Corp. of China Ltd. (601600 CH), the nation’s
biggest producer of the metal, gained 10 percent to 11.48 yuan,
the most since Sept. 28. It snapped a six-day, 7.5 percent drop.
Aluminum futures for three-month delivery rose 0.9 percent on
London Metal Exchange, the biggest increase since March 8.
“It’s a rebound after the markets overreacted globally,” said
Wu Kan, a  fund manager  at Dazhong Insurance Co., which oversees
$285 million.  Dongfang Electric Corp. (600875 CH) rose 1.9 percent to
30.77 yuan, the biggest gain since March 7. Dongfang’s parent

biggest life insurer, gained 1.4 percent to 50.15 yuan, the most
since March 7. China Life Insurance Co. (601628 CH), the largest
insurer, added 0.9 percent to 21.10 yuan. Moody’s said in a
statement it expects “strong” premium growth will continue over
the next 12 months to 18 months, spurred by China’s economic
expansion. Higher  interest rates  will also boost investment
income from deposits, analyst led by Sally Yim said.  --Irene Shen. Editor: Allen Wan  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
