  Edisun Power Europe AG (ESUN) , a Zurich-
based solar power producer, climbed as much as 32 percent to 66
francs today, its highest since October, following Japanâ€™s
nuclear-reactor accident.  The company is among the solar project developers in  Europe 
that are expected to benefit in response to the nuclear
situation in Japan. Edisun, with a market value of almost 23
million francs ($25 million), said as of mid-2010 that it
operated 70 solar power facilities with a total capacity of 8.7
megawatts in Switzerland, Germany, Spain and France.  Edisun, which develops, finances and operates solar power
plants through much of Europe, has risen 16 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
