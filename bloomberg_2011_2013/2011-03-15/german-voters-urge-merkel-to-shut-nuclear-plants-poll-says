About half of Germans want the
nation’s nuclear-power stations shut down after the explosions
at a Japanese plant, according to a survey.  Underscoring public dissatisfaction with  Chancellor Angela Merkel ’s energy policy, 53 percent said they want all 17 German
reactors closed “as soon as possible.” Opposition calls to
shut  Germany ’s seven oldest plants were backed by 72 percent of
respondents in the Infratest poll for ARD television.  Eighty percent oppose the decision by Merkel’s coalition in
2010 to extend the use of nuclear power by an average of 12
years past the previous phase-out date of about 2022, ARD said
in a statement late yesterday. Merkel yesterday suspended the
extension for three months for a review of reactor safety.  The poll of 909 people conducted yesterday has a margin of
error of as many as 3.3 percentage points, ARD said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
