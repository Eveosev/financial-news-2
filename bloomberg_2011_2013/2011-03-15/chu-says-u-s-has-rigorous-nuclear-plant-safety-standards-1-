Energy Secretary Steven Chu said
the American people should have confidence in the safety of
domestic nuclear power plants, as  Japan  struggles to contain
reactors damaged in last week’s earthquake and tsunami.  The U.S. nuclear industry operates under rigorous safety
regulations, Chu said today in testimony to a House
appropriations subcommittee.  Power-plant developers are required by regulators to design
plants that can survive worst-case scenarios, such as
earthquakes and tsunamis, Chu said. The administration has sent
Japan monitoring equipment and nuclear experts to provide advice
and technical assistance, and was also “determined to learn”
from the nuclear crisis, Chu said.  “We need to take a hard look at any lesson learned from
this tragedy that can further improve the safety of our
reactors,” Chu said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
