Shashank Khade, who manages about
$200 million at Kotak Securities Ltd., comments on the outlook
for  India ’s stocks amid concern about the safety of nuclear
plants damaged by  Japan ’s earthquake last week. Khade spoke in a
phone interview from his office in Mumbai today.  The Bombay Stock Exchange’s Sensitive Index, or Sensex,
fell 1.6 percent to 18,153.23 at 11:21 a.m. in Mumbai.  “India’s exposure to Japan is not substantial. It is the
third-largest economy in the world so it definitely creates
turbulence in terms of flows coming from Japanese investors.  ‘‘Today’s fall is clearly panic.  ‘‘From our point of view it is status quo. We haven’t
really made many changes in our investment decisions, but this
fall is definitely a good point to enter the market.’’  To contact the reporter on this story:
