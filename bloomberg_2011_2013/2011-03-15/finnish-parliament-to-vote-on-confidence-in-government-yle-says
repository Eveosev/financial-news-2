  Finland ’s Parliament will today
hold a no-confidence vote in government, state-owned broadcaster
YLE reported.
  The opposition called the motion over whether Finland’s
liabilities increased from the extension of the euro area
bailout fund, YLE said. 
  Today’s parliamentary session will be the last before the
April 17 elections, which means the no-confidence vote will have
to take place today after the parliamentary debate ends, YLE
said.  Click here for web link in Finnish  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
