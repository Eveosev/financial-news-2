  Kazakhstan , the biggest energy
producer in central  Asia , plans to raise natural-gas production
by 12 percent this year.  Gas output in the Caspian Sea state will rise to 42 billion
cubic meters in 2011 from 37.4 billion cubic meters last year,
according to the Oil & Gas Ministry’s  plan  published today in
Kazakhstanskaya Pravda, the official newspaper. Output in 2012
is projected at 42.5 billion cubic meters, the ministry said.  Exports of the fuel may rise to 9.2 billion cubic meters
this year from 9.1 billion last year, the ministry’s figures
show. The nation exported 7 billion cubic meters of gas in 2009.  Kazakhstan accounted for 1 percent of global gas production
in 2009, according to BP Plc. Four producers accounted for
almost 90 percent of the nation’s output that year, the ministry
said. These were CNPC-AktobeMunaiGaz, Tolkynneftegaz LLP,  Chevron Corp (CVX) .-led TengizChevroil LLP and Karachaganak Petroleum
Operating BV, the venture led by  Eni SpA (ENI)  and  BG Group Plc. (BG/)   Kazakh gas output will be bolstered by ramped-up production
at the Karachaganak, Tengiz, Zhanazhol, Tolkyn and Kashagan
fields, the ministry said.  Russia shipped 48 billion cubic meters of gas across
Kazakhstan, while Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan shipped 11.9
billion and 13.4 billion respectively in 2009, it said.  Abzal Nurkasymov, a spokesman for the Astana-based Oil &
Gas Ministry, declined to comment immediately on gas transits.  The following table shows the ministry’s estimates for
Kazakhstan’s gas production. All figures are in billions of
cubic meters unless otherwise specified.  To contact the reporter on this story:
