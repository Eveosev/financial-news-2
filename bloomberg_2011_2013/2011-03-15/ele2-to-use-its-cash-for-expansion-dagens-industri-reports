  Tele2 AB (TEL2B) , Swedenâ€™s second-largest
phone company, will use its cash and low debt to further expand
in Russia and other countries,  Dagens Industri  reported, citing
Chief Executive Officer Mats Granryd.  Tele2 will buy licenses or companies, focusing on
mismanaged firms it can get cheap and turn around, in countries
such as Slovenia, the Czech Republic, Albania, Ukraine,
Azerbaijan and Georgia, the newspaper quoted Granryd as saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
