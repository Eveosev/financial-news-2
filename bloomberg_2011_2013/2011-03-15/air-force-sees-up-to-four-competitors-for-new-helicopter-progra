As many as four companies may
compete to build a new  U.S. Air Force  helicopter that would
protect missiles and evacuate government officials in an attack,
the service’s top uniformed weapons buyer said.  An acquisition strategy will be released soon for the 93-
helicopter program, Lieutenant General  Mark Shackleford  told a
House Armed Services Committee panel today in  Washington ,
without giving a timetable. The new aircraft would replace Bell
Helicopter Textron UH-1N Hueys, Shackleford said.  The Air Force wants to replace the Hueys with a “Common
Vertical Lift Support Platform” and asked in its fiscal 2012
budget for $5.4 million for development and $52.8 million to buy
the first two new copters. Three or four companies are qualified
to build the craft, said Shackleford, who didn’t identify them.  “We have a lot of options as we finalize the acquisition
plan,” he said. “I expect it to be a competitive strategy.”  While the Air Force could invoke a 1932 law called the
Economy Act to justify a single supplier, “we are leaning
strongly towards competition,” Shackleford said in an interview
after the hearing.  New choppers would have “needed carrying capability,
speed, range and endurance currently not provided by the UH-1N
fleet,” Schackleford said in a statement. Duties would include
supporting the transport of intercontinental ballistic missiles
and so-called continuation-of-government missions in Washington
if the capital were under attack, according to the  Air Force .  To contact the reporter on this story:
