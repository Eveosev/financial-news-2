PetroChina Co., the nation’s
second-largest refiner, plans to cut daily oil processing at its
Dalian plant by 10 percent this month because of refining losses,
said an official at the refinery.  The plant, PetroChina’s biggest, will refine 1.55 million
metric tons of crude in March, or about 366,500 barrels a day,
compared with 408,386 barrels a day in February, the official
said by telephone from Dalian today. The refinery has a daily
processing capacity of 410,000 barrels.  PetroChina isn’t making any refining profit at its plants
as the breakeven crude price is $90 a barrel, Chairman Jiang
Jiemin said on March 5. Oil futures dropped 1.9 percent to
$99.23 a barrel in electronic trading in  New York  as of 3:08 p.m.
