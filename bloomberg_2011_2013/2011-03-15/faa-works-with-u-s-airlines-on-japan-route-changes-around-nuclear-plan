The  Federal Aviation Administration 
is working with U.S. airlines to ensure that flights to  Japan 
comply with airspace restrictions around a stricken nuclear
power plant.  Japanese officials limited air traffic near the Fukushima
Dai-Ichi facility because of “potentially hazardous” radiation
leaks from three reactors damaged by last week’s earthquake and
tsunami, Diane Spitaliere, an FAA spokeswoman, said in an
interview today.  United Continental Holdings Inc .,  Delta Air Lines Inc. (DAL)  and
American Airlines haven’t made changes, spokesmen said today.
Germany’s  Deutsche Lufthansa AG (LHA)  rerouted Tokyo flights to other
Japanese cities and joined European peers in using Seoul as an
overnight crew base instead of Japan, citing the radiation risk.  “We want to make sure U.S. carriers are aware of and
complying with the restrictions,” Spitaliere said.  United Continental, Delta and  AMR Corp. (AMR) ’s American are the
largest U.S. airlines by traffic across the Pacific. All three
are waiving fees for passengers holding tickets to or from Japan
who want to change their reservations.  To contact the reporter on this story:
