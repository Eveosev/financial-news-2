The yen traded 0.2 percent from a
four-month high against the dollar after  Tokyo  Electric Power
Co. confirmed a new fire at its stricken nuclear power plant,
prompting speculation Japanese investors will repatriate assets.  The yen and dollar climbed against  Australia  and  New
Zealand ’s currencies after a global equity slump spurred demand
for the safest assets. The euro fell versus 11 of its 16 most-
traded peers as Moody’s Investors Service cut  Portugal ’s long-
term ratings to A3 from A1, with a negative outlook.  “The market is very sensitive to the nuclear problem,”
said Tomokazu Matsufuji, a dealer in Tokyo at SBI Liquidity
Market Co., a unit　of financier SBI Holdings Inc. “As stocks
fall, investors can’t take risk and are unwinding long positions
of various currencies against the yen.  Risk aversion  is clearly
pushing up the yen.”  The yen traded at 80.76 per dollar as of 7:38 a.m. in Tokyo
from 80.72 in  New York  yesterday, when it reached 80.61, the
strongest since Nov. 9. The Japanese currency touched 80.22 on
Nov. 1, the strongest since April 1995, when it reached a
postwar record of 79.75.  The yen was at 112.89 per euro from 112.99 yesterday, when
it touched 111.97, the highest since Feb. 28. The euro slipped
to $1.3978 from 1.3998.  Tokyo Electric Power said a fire broke out at the No. 4
reactor of the Fukushima Dai-Ichi nuclear power plant today. The
fire, at the same place as a blaze yesterday, was reported by a
worker at about 5:45 a.m. local time today, a company spokesman
said on public broadcaster NHK television. High levels of
radiation are preventing the company from approaching the fire,
NHK reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
