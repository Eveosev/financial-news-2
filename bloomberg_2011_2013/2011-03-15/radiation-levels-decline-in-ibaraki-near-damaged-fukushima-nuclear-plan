Radiation levels fell in Ibaraki
prefecture, south of Tokyo Electric Power Co.’s damaged nuclear
plant in northeastern  Japan , according to a statement by the
regional government.  Radiation readings in Kitaibaraki city, about 43 miles (70
kilometers) south of the Fukushima nuclear plant, fell to 821
nanosieverts per hour as of 3 p.m., from 3,560 nanosieverts at
8:10 a.m., the Ibaraki government said in the  release  today.
That compares with 50 nanosieverts as of 9:30 a.m. on March 13,
when the measurements began, according the statement.  “The radiation levels are above normal, but at most only
about one-10th of a chest X-ray and are not harmful to the
health,” the government said in a separate statement today.  Prime Minister Naoto Kan today said the danger of further
radiation leaks was rising at the crippled nuclear facility,
135 miles north of  Tokyo , and urged citizens living within a
18-mile radius of the plant to stay indoors. The power plant
today was rocked by its fourth explosion since the March 11
earthquake that left more than 2,400 dead in Japan.  Radiation levels in central Tokyo jumped to as much as
0.809 microsieverts per hour this morning, before falling to
0.072 microsieverts as of 4 p.m., according to the  website  of
Tokyo Metropolitan Institute of  Public Health . Readings in the
area over the past four years averaged 0.079 microsieverts,
according to the agency.  Radiation Exposure  A nanosievert is a billionth of a sievert, one thousandth
of a microsievert and a million times less than a millisievert.
A dose of 100 millisieverts a year is the lowest level at which
any increase in cancer is evident, according to the  World
Nuclear Association .  The wind near the Fukushima plant was blowing from the
east-north-east at noon, away from Tokyo, the  Japan
Meteorological Agency  said.  As of 10:22 a.m. local time, 400 millisieverts of
radiation were detected at the No. 2 and No. 3 reactors of the
Fukushima plant, Japan’s Chief Cabinet Secretary Yukio Edano
said at briefing today.  Exposure to 1 sievert of radiation can cause hemorrhaging,
4 sieverts can cause death within two months, and 2,000
sieverts can cause loss of consciousness within minutes and
death within hours, according to the U.S.  Environmental
Protection Agency .  The death toll from the 9-magnitude earthquake and tsunami
rose to 2,414, Japan’s  National Police Agency  said today. The
earthquake was the fourth-largest since 1900 and the largest in
Japan since modern instrumental recordings began 130 years ago,
according to the  U.S. Geological Survey .  To contact the reporter on this story:
