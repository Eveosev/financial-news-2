European Union energy ministers
will discuss a proposal for stress tests on nuclear-power plants
today as engineers in  Japan  battle to prevent a meltdown at a
nuclear facility following the recent earthquake and tsunami.  “This is an idea that needs to be considered and should be
debated,”  Marlene Holzner , spokeswoman for Energy Commissioner
Guenther Oettinger, told reporters in Brussels today.  Energy ministers, power companies and regulators are
meeting to discuss nuclear-plant safety in  Europe  after the
Japanese disaster and will explore what measures might need to
be taken to prevent such an incident happening in the EU. The
purpose of the meeting will be take stock and gather
information, Holzner said.  Japan is facing its worst nuclear disaster since World War
II with radiation leaks and the prospect of a meltdown at
reactors at its Fukushima plant following a record 8.9-magnitude
temblor and a tsunami. Austrian Environment Minister Nikolaus Berlakovich yesterday called for stress tests on European
nuclear plants.  “It’s necessary to give security to the European people,”
Berlakovich said in Brussels. “We need stress tests for our
nuclear  power plants . That is absolutely necessary.”  Holzner today called the prospect of a similar earthquake
in Europe “highly unlikely.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
