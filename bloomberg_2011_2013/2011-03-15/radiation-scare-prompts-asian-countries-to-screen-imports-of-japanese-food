Asian countries moved to screen
food imports from  Japan  following explosions at the stricken
Fukushima nuclear plant that raised radiation levels at the
complex to harmful levels.    South Korea ,  Indonesia , Thailand,  Malaysia , Singapore and
the Philippines all took steps to check fruit, vegetables, meat
and seafood from Japan for nuclear material. Radiation at
Fukushima’s No. 3 reactor today reached 400 millisieverts per
hour, Japan’s Chief Cabinet Secretary Yukio Edano said. A
radiation dose of 100 millisieverts a year is the lowest level
at which any increase in cancer is evident, the World Nuclear
Association said on its website.  Edano later said radiation readings outside the power plant
were falling below levels that are harmful.  “We will use the same measures that we used during
Chernobyl in 1986,” Pipat Yingseree, secretary-general of  Thailand ’s  Food and Drug Administration , told reporters in
Bangkok today. “If it becomes clear that there is radioactive
contamination, we will ask for cooperation from operators to
delay food imports from Japan, and we will implement serious
checks by seizing all products and inspecting all of them.”  Concerns over contaminated food and other exports may
hinder Japan’s economic recovery following the biggest two-day
stock sell-off since 1987. The world’s fourth-strongest
earthquake since 1900 and the ensuing tsunami may have claimed
more than 10,000 lives, according to police estimates.  Japanese food and beverage companies that earn more than 20
percent of their revenue overseas fell today, mirroring the 10.6
percent decline in the  Nikkei 225 (NKY)  index.  Kikkoman Corp. (2801) , Japan’s
biggest soy-sauce maker, dropped 17.5 percent, while Kameda
Seika Co., a maker of rice cakes, shed 11 percent.  Radioactivity Tests  South Korea plans to strengthen radioactivity tests on
livestock and marine products from Japan, the Ministry for Food,
Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries said in an e-mailed
statement today. South Korea imported 527 metric tons of
livestock products, mostly dairy, and 84,018 tons of marine
products from Japan last year, it said.  “As a precautionary measure, samples of fresh produce
exported from Japan after 11 March 2011, such as seafood,
fruits, vegetables and meat, are being tested for radioactive
contaminants with immediate effect,” the Agri-Food and
Veterinary Authority of  Singapore  said in a statement.  Indonesia planned to ask Japan to certify that packaged
foods are free of radioactive materials and will check the
location of each manufacturer before allowing imports,
Kustantinah, head of the  National Agency of Drug and Food
Control , said by phone today in Jakarta. About 3 percent of food
items sold in the Indonesian market come from Japan, she said.  Malaysia, Philippines  “If they came from an area close to the disaster region,
we may not accept them,” said Kustantinah, who uses one name.
“We have to anticipate; we don’t want any health risks.”  Malaysia will check food items including fish, fruit,
cereal, beverages, canned food and meat, the New Straits Times
reported, citing Health Minister Liow Tiong Lai. Malaysia
imported more than 48,000 tons of such food from Japan last
year, according to the newspaper.  The  Philippines  will also inspect food coming from Japan,
President  Benigno Aquino ’s spokesman Ricky Carandang said today.  Atomic bomb tests in  Nevada  during the 1950s and 1960s
released radioactive iodine, or I-131, into the atmosphere that
was blown thousands of miles away. Animals grazing on pastures
contaminated with I-131 had the radioactive material in their
milk, which poisoned some children,  according to  the  U.S.
Department of Health  and Human Services.  After the 1986 reactor accident at Chernobyl, governments
in  Europe  condemned some agricultural lands, removed
contaminated pasture grasses from animal diets and monitored
milk for radiation levels, according to a 2005 World Health
Organization  report .  They also banned consumption of game meat, berries and
mushrooms in forests. Concerns about the levels of radioactive
material in milk, meat and plant foods persisted two decades
after the accident, the report said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
