The U.S. passed  France  as the
world’s largest wine-consuming nation for the first time, lifted
by its larger population and an interest in wine-and-cheese
culture among young Americans.  Wine shipments to the U.S. climbed 2 percent to 329.7
million cases last year, according to Gomberg, Fredrikson &
Associates, a wine-industry consulting firm in Woodside,  California . That compares with 320.6 million for France.  While the French still eclipse Americans in per-capita
consumption, the U.S. wine industry is benefiting from a
domestic population of almost  311 million people  -- five times
the size of  France’s  -- and a surge of young people becoming
interested in the drink. Marketers also are using social media
to reach a new generation of consumers, said Jon Fredrikson, the
firm’s president.  “Wine is really gaining traction in the U.S. -- it’s
becoming an accepted part of everyday life,” Fredrikson said in
an interview. “That’s a radical change over the past two
decades.”  The retail value of U.S. wine sales rose 4 percent to $30
billion in 2010, according to Gomberg Fredrikson. California’s
output accounted for 61 percent of the volume. The state’s
worldwide wine shipments climbed 2 percent to 241.8 million
cases.  “With the U.S. being the biggest, it means we’re a target
for everyone in America and around the world that produces
wine,” Fredrikson said. “Everyone wants to be here.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
