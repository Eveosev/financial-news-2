  UBS AG (UBSN) ,  Switzerland ’s biggest bank,
cut compensation for investment-banking head Carsten Kengeter by
29 percent in 2010 after the unit’s earnings slumped in the
second half of the year.  Kengeter, 43, received 9.32 million Swiss francs ($10.1
million), including a base salary of 874,626 francs, the Zurich-
based bank said in its  annual report  published today. He was the
highest-paid member of the executive board for the second
consecutive year after getting 13.2 million francs in 2009.  Chief Executive Officer  Oswald Gruebel , 67, who decided to
forgo a bonus again in 2010 because UBS shares didn’t rise, last
month described the investment bank’s performance as “not yet
satisfactory.” UBS cut its total 2010 bonus pool by 11 percent
to 4.25 billion francs as pretax profit at the securities unit
fell 66 percent in the fourth quarter from the year-earlier
period, following a loss in the third quarter.  “Significant progress was made in positioning the
investment bank for the future,” UBS said in its compensation
report, adding that 88 percent of Kengeter’s 2010 bonus was
deferred into future years.  Kengeter, who joined UBS from  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)  in
2008 and has co-headed the investment bank since April 2009,
became the unit’s sole CEO in November when Alexander Wilmot- Sitwell moved to  Hong Kong  to co-head the company’s Asia-Pacific
business.  Earnings Adjustment  Fourth-quarter net income was adjusted up by 373 million
francs today after changes to the investment carrying amount of
a subsidiary resulted in higher tax benefits and the amount of
total bonuses was reduced by 74 million francs. The net income
for 2010 was raised to 7.53 billion francs, the bank’s first
annual profit after three consecutive years of losses.  “In 2011 we are confident that we can consolidate the
progress already made throughout the firm, helping to deliver
our goal of long-term sustainable profitability for our
shareholders,” Gruebel and Chairman Kaspar Villiger said in the
letter to shareholders today.  UBS has gained 11 percent in Swiss trading this year, after
the shares fell 4.4 percent in 2010. That compares with a 5.2
percent increase this year and a 9.5 percent decline in 2010 in
the 48-company Bloomberg Europe Banks and Financial Services
Index.  The investment bank reported its first annual pretax profit
in 2010 after 57.1 billion francs in cumulative losses over the
previous three years. Last year’s earnings of 2.2 billion francs
are still short of the 6 billion francs the unit aims to achieve
by 2014.  ‘Sensible Opportunities’  Gruebel told Swiss Bilanz magazine last week that he
underestimated how long it would take to rebuild business at the
investment bank. The unit tries to increase risk-taking to boost
profit “only when sensible opportunities arise,” which has not
been the case over the past few months, he told the magazine.  The company’s 13-person executive board as a whole received
total compensation of 91 million francs for 2010, compared with
68.7 million francs for the previous year. Gruebel’s
compensation amounted to 3 million francs in base salary and
25,600 francs of benefits in kind. Villiger received total
compensation of 1.49 million francs.  To contact the reporters on this story:
