  Hong Kong  & China Gas Co., the
piped-fuel supplier controlled by billionaire Lee Shau-kee,
posted a 5.9 percent gain in profit last year, beating estimates,
as earnings from its mainland business rose.  Net income increased to HK$5.6 billion ($718 million), or
77.8 Hong Kong cents a share, from HK$5.3 billion, or 73 Hong
Kong cents a share, the previous year, the company said in a
statement to the Hong Kong stock exchange today. That compares
with a mean estimate of HK$4.9 billion in a Bloomberg survey of
eight analysts.  The fuel supplier, Hong Kong’s first public utility founded
in 1862, has invested in property and gas and water projects in
China to counter slowing fuel sales in the city. Net income at
its mainland unit Towngas  China  Co. increased 64 percent to
HK$435.8 million, according to a statement released yesterday.  “The mainland economy maintained strong momentum in 2010,
benefiting the group’s city-gas and natural-gas businesses,”
Hong Kong & China Gas said in today’s statement.  Revenue at Towngas China increased 47 percent in 2010 to
HK$3 billion, according to yesterday’s earnings statement.  Hong Kong & China Gas shares rose 3.3 percent in Hong Kong
trading in the past 12 months compared with a 7.6 percent gain
in the benchmark  Hang Seng  index. The stock fell 2.4 percent to
HK$17.56 today, ahead of the earnings announcement.  The shares are rated a “hold” by eight out of 15 analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg, while one rates the stock a “buy.” Six
recommend selling.  Net income may reach HK$5.3 billion this year, according to
a mean estimate of eight analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  --John Duce and  Wang Ying . Editors: Ryan Woo, Tan Hwee Ann.  To contact the reporter on this story:
