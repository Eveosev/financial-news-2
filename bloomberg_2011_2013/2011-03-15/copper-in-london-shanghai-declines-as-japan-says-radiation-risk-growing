Copper declined as equities slumped
after the Japanese prime minister warned the risk of further
radiation leaks from the damaged nuclear power plant at
Fukushima is increasing. Zinc and lead also fell.  The metal for three-month delivery dropped as much as 1.6
percent to $9,039 a metric ton on the  London  Metal Exchange and
traded at $9,042 at 3:07 p.m.  Shanghai  time. Copper for June
delivery on the Shanghai Futures Exchange dropped 1.2 percent to
68,600 yuan ($10,441) a ton.  Japanese Prime Minister  Naoto Kan  said today in a
nationally-televised press conference that the risks of further
radiation leaks are increasing after explosions at the plant in
northern  Japan . Emergency cooling systems failed following last
week’s massive earthquake and tsunami, resulting in the
explosions.  “The Japan earthquake is the theme,” Wang Ning, an
analyst at Xiangyu Futures Co., said by phone from Shanghai.
“It has a broader impact on financial markets and copper won’t
be immune.”  Kan said his government was doing its utmost to contain the
radioactive leakage from the plant. Blasts have occurred at
three of the station’s six reactors since March 12 and a fire
was discovered a fourth unit’s building today. The level of
radiation at the plant climbed above the legal limit after the
latest explosion,  Kyodo News  reported.  Shares Plummet  Japan’s shares tumbled, with the Topix index completing its
worst two-day plunge since 1987, as concern grew about the
safety of nuclear plants damaged by the country’s worst
earthquake on record. The index sank 9.5 percent to 766.73. The
MSCI Asia Pacific Index fell as much as 7.5 percent to 121.69.  The  U.S. Geological Survey  increased the magnitude of the
March 11 earthquake that hit Japan to 9 from 8.9, according to a
statement on its website. Manufacturers including Sony Corp. and
Toyota Motor Corp. closed plants yesterday.  Aluminum in London fell 1.3 percent to $2,525.25 a ton,
zinc dropped 1.1 percent to $2,303.50 a ton, and lead lost 1
percent to $2,494 a ton. Nickel declined 1.1 percent to $25,531
a ton, and tin gave up 1.3 percent to $29,500 a ton.  -  Helen Sun . Editors: Bloomberg News, Jake Lloyd-Smith  To contact the Bloomberg News staff on this story:
