  Close Brothers Group Plc (CBG) , a British
investment bank founded in 1878, said fiscal first-half profit
fell 68 percent after it wrote down the value of a fund
administration unit it sold.  Net income dropped to 14.6 million pounds ($23.5 million)
in the six months to the end of January from 46.1 million pounds
a year earlier, the London-based firm said in a statement today.  The firm last week sold a unit that administers offshore
funds and trusts to Kleinwort Benson Channel Islands Holdings
Ltd. for 29.1 million pounds. Close Brothers recorded an
estimated loss of 24.7 million pounds on the sale.  “We wrote down the business because the proceeds we sold
it for were less than we valued it at,” Chief Executive Officer
Preben Prebensen said in an interview today.  Close Brothers’ three biggest units are banking, asset
management and securities trading. The size of the firm’s loan
book increased 9 percent to 3.2 billion pounds from July to
January. Funds under management advanced 20 percent to 8.3
billion pounds.  “Given the banking division’s loan book growth in the
first half, it expects a good performance in the second half of
the year with a modest improvement in bad debts for the
financial year as a whole,” the company said in the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
