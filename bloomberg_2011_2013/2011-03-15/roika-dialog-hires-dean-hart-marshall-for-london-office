Troika Dialog, the Russian
brokerage being acquired by OAO Sberbank, said it is rehiring
Graham Dean Hart to head equity trading in  London , and
recruiting Guy Marshall for a senior equity-sales role.  Dean Hart last worked as head of cash equity in Moscow
before leaving Troika last year, according to a statement e-
mailed by the brokerage today. Marshall, who will also be based
in London, joins from Consumer Equity Research, an independent
research boutique.  Sberbank, Russiaâ€™s biggest lender, agreed to buy Troika
Dialog on March 11 as it moves into  investment banking . A day
before the deal, Citigroup Inc. said it hired four former Troika
Dialog bankers, including its chief strategist Kingsmill Bond.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
