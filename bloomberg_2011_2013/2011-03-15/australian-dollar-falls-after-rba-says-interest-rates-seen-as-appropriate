The Australian dollar declined
after the  Reserve Bank  said it considered the overnight cash
rate is at an appropriate level, in minutes from the March 1
meeting when policy makers held borrowing costs unchanged.  The currency declined to $1.0067 as of 11:53 a.m. in Sydney
from $1.0097 yesterday in  New York .  To contact the reporter on this story:
