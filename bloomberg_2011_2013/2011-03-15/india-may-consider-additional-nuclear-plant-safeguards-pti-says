  India  may consider placing
additional environmental safeguards for nuclear plants proposed
to be built at Jaitapur, the Press Trust of India reported,
citing Environment Minister Jairam Ramesh.  A decision may be taken after the Nuclear Power Corp. of
India completes a review of safety systems and designs following
the earthquake in  Japan , according to the report.  Areva SA and Nuclear Power Corp. signed a preliminary
agreement in December for the construction of two reactors, the
first of a series of six at Jaitapur in western India. The
complex will have a total capacity of 9,900 megawatts, the
largest atomic project in the country, according to the  website 
of Nuclear Power Corp.  -- Editors: John Chacko, Sam Nagarajan  To contact the reporter on this story:
