the largest producer of the grain on the continent, as the rand
weakened against the dollar, making imports more expensive for
local millers.  White corn for July delivery, the most active contract on
the South African Futures Exchange, rose 23 rand, or 1.5
percent, to close trade at 1,543 rand ($221) a metric ton in
Johannesburg. Meal made from the grain is the countryâ€™s staple
food.  The rand traded at 6.9834 to the dollar at 12:19 p.m.
Johannesburg time, compared with 6.8718 at the close of grain
trading at noon yesterday.  In South Africa, yellow corn for July delivery gained 36
rand, or 2.3 percent, to 1,600 rand a ton. The country mainly
uses the grain as  animal feed . Wheat for May delivery increased
