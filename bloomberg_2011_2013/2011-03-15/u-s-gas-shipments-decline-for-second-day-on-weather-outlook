Natural gas for next-day delivery
in the U.S. Midwest declined on forecasts of moderating
temperatures that may reduce demand for the heating fuel.  Gas at the NGPL Midcontinent hub, which transports the fuel
to the Midwest from the 9,800-mile NGPL pipeline, slipped 12.08
cents, or 3.2 percent, to $3.6706 per million British thermal
units on the  Intercontinental Exchange .  The pipeline  is owned by
Myria Holdings Inc. and Kinder Morgan Inc.  Gas at the  Henry Hub  in Erath, Louisiana, the delivery
point for futures traded on the  New York Mercantile Exchange ,
dropped 8.99 cents, or 2.3 percent, to $3.8078 per million Btu
on the exchange.  Natural gas shipments scheduled for delivery to U.S.
households slipped for a second day. Scheduled deliveries to
homes in the U.S. and Canada fell 7.7 percent to 31.7 million
dekatherms (30.8 billion cubic feet), according to data compiled
by Bloomberg. That was the lowest level since Nov. 16.  Residences in a region including the Great Lakes and parts
of the mid-Atlantic were to receive 12.9 million dekatherms of
gas, down 8.8 percent from yesterday, Bloomberg data show.  Scheduled shipments for U.S. power plants were down 3.3
percent to 11.3 million dekatherms, the first drop in three
days.  The low temperature early today in Columbus,  Ohio , was 37
degrees Fahrenheit (3 Celsius), 5 degrees above normal,
according to Weather Underground in  Ann Arbor , Michigan. The low
tomorrow may be 38 degrees, 9 degrees above normal.  To contact the reporter on this story:
