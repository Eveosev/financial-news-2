  Ipopema Securities SA (IPE) , Poland’s
biggest non-bank brokerage, agreed to buy Credit Suisse AG’s
Asset Management Polska unit to expand its fund-management
business, it said in a regulatory statement today.  The transaction, which will help Ipopema increase its fund-
management operations by about 60 percent, must be approved by
regulators, the Warsaw-based brokerage said. It didn’t give
financial details of the deal.  Credit Suisse said the sale will allow it to focus on  investment banking  and private banking in Poland. The country
“remains a key market” for the bank in the region, Michael Ruediger, head for central and eastern Europe at Credit Suisse,
said in an e-mailed statement.  Credit Suisse is adding services, expanding its brokerage
business and hiring employees for its service center in Wroclaw,  Poland . It will boost its workforce in the center to 800
employees this year from 500 at the end of 2010, the bank said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
