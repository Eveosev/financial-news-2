European stocks slumped the most in
four months as concern grew that a Japanese nuclear power plant
damaged by last week’s earthquake will leak radiation.  Carmakers and chemical shares led losses on the Stoxx  Europe  600 Index as all 19 industry groups lost at least 1.5
percent. Utilities  E.ON AG (EOAN)  and  RWE AG (RWE)  sank more than 2 percent,
while renewable-energy companies rallied as  Germany  said it will
halt its seven oldest nuclear reactors as part of a safety
review.  BHP Billiton Ltd. (BHP)  led a selloff in basic-resource shares
as metal prices retreated.  The Stoxx 600 tumbled 2.3 percent to 266.32 at the 4:30
p.m. close in  London , sliding below its 200-day moving average
for the first time since August. The  VStoxx Index (V2X) , which
measures the cost of protecting against declines in the Euro
Stoxx 50 Index, climbed 16 percent to 31.01, the largest gain
since November.  “‘We’re still heavily depressed by developments in  Japan ,” said  Michael Koehler , head of strategy at Landesbank
Baden-Wuerttemberg in Mainz, Germany. “As long as we don’t find
a solution for power plants, equity markets won’t be rising.”  Japan’s  Nikkei 225 (NKY)  Stock Average slumped 11 percent, the
third-biggest decline in its history, as concern grew that the
nuclear reactors damaged by the country’s worst earthquake on
record will suffer a meltdown. A third explosion and fire struck
Tokyo Electric Power Co.’s Fukushima plant today.  State of Emergency  The Stoxx 600 has retreated 8.5 percent from this year’s
high on Feb. 17 as the Japanese disaster added to concern that
popular revolts in the Middle East and North Africa will further
disrupt oil supplies. Bahrain declared a three-month state of
emergency today as a second contingent of troops from other Gulf
states arrived in the country to quash a month of anti-
government protests.  The decline has pushed the Stoxx 600’s valuation to its
cheapest level relative to its companies’ estimated earnings
since April 2009.  National benchmark indexes fell in all of the 18 western
European markets today. The U.K.’s FTSE 100 Index lost 1.4
percent, Germany’s DAX Index sank 3.2 percent and  France ’s CAC
40 Index retreated 2.5 percent.  Chemical shares and carmakers led declines in Europe, with
both industry groups falling more than 3 percent.  Renault SA (RNO) ,
which has a 43 percent stake in Japan’s Nissan Motor Co., lost
1.6 percent to 37.55 euros.  Volkswagen AG (VOW) , Europe’s largest
carmaker, retreated 3.8 percent to 108.95 euros, the lowest
price in four months.  BASF SE (BAS) , the world’s biggest chemical
company, slid 4 percent to 55.46 euros, while  Rhodia SA (RHA) , a
French specialty chemicals maker, lost 3.2 percent to 19.01
euros.  E.ON, RWE Sink  E.ON and RWE, Germany’s biggest utilities, sank 2.8 percent
to 21.25 euros and 3.6 percent to 44 euros, respectively. German
chancellor  Angela Merkel  said that production will stop at all
nuclear power plants that began operation before the end of 1980
while officials conduct a three-month safety review.  Electricite de France SA, Europe’s biggest power generator,
lost 1.4 percent to 28.56 euros. The stock was cut to “sell”
from “buy” at Aurel BGC, which predicted that regulators will
rewrite the rules governing nuclear power stations in the
aftermath of the Fukushima plant’s inability to withstand March
11’s tremor and the subsequent tsunami.  Clean-energy companies rose for a second day amid
speculation that they will benefit from increased demand for
alternative energy. Wind-turbine maker  Nordex SE (NDX1)  jumped 19
percent to 8.15 euros, while  SolarWorld AG (SWV)  soared 23 percent to
10.64 euros.  Q-Cells SE (QCE)  surged 17 percent to 3.50 euros.    BHP Billiton , the world’s biggest mining company, lost 1.7
percent to 2,250.5 pence. Copper, lead, nickel, tin and zinc all
fell on the London Metal Exchange.  Pandora, Burberry  Pandora A/S sank 22 percent to 238.40 kroner, the biggest
drop since its initial public offering in October, as the Danish
jewelry-maker forecast that its sales in 2011 will miss most
analyst estimates.  Other luxury-goods companies also retreated, extending
yesterday’s losses as investors speculated that their Japanese
sales will suffer. Cie. Financiere Richemont SA tumbled 3.7
percent to 49.19 Swiss francs.    Deutsche Boerse AG (DB1)  dropped 2 percent to 51.93 euros, the
lowest price this year. Nasdaq OMX Group Inc. has talked to
lenders about funding a possible bid for NYSE Euronext to
counter  Deutsche Boerse ’s more than $9 billion offer for the

matter.    Deutsche Bank AG (DBK)  slid 3.8 percent to 41.03 euros, leading
European banking shares lower. Germany’s biggest bank reiterated
its target of 10 billion euros ($14 billion) for 2011 profit
before taxes from its Corporate & Investment Bank, Private
Clients and Asset Management units.  Bank of Ireland  Bank of Ireland Plc slid 3.5 percent to 30.1 euro cents,
paring yesterday’s advance. Ireland can’t seek to re-negotiate
the terms of its rescue package until the central bank completes
stress tests to determine whether the nation’s lenders need new
capital, Finance Minister  Michael Noonan  said.    Nyrstar (NYR)  NV slid 4.8 percent to 9.55 euros, its lowest price
in three weeks. The world’s biggest producer of refined zinc
said that shareholders took up 95 percent of the 490.1 million
euros of discounted stock that the company sold today to fund
