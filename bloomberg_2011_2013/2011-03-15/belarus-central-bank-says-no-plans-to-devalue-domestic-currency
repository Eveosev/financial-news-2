Belarus’s central bank said it has
no plans for a “sharp” currency devaluation, according to a
 statement  on its website today.  The regulator pledged to maintain its present currency
management regime throughout this year, ensuring “gradual moves
and predictability” of the Belarusian ruble, the Natsionalnyi
Bank Respubliki Belarus said in the capital Minsk. The bank has
sufficient resources to do so, it said.  The currency will be allowed to fluctuate within 8 percent
of 1,057.04 rubles, the value of its target basket at the start
of the year, the bank said. The basket is divided equally into
dollars, euros and Russian rubles.   The central bank devalued its currency by about a fifth in
January 2009.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
