  Kenya ’s shilling slumped for the
ninth day as concern about radiation leaks from a Japanese
nuclear plant increased, reducing demand for frontier-market
assets and as dollar demand by importers outstripped supply.  The currency of East  Africa ’s biggest economy weakened as
much as 0.8 percent to 86.80 per dollar, the lowest since March
1994, and was little changed at 86.10 at 11:27 a.m. in Nairobi
from a close of 86.15 yesterday.  Much of Kenya, the world’s biggest black-tea exporter, will
probably receive below-normal rainfall during the March-to-May

Nairobi based Commercial Bank of Africa, said in a phone
interview today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
