The U.K. government will have to
increase taxes by as much as 17 percent to cover the cost of a
growing elderly population, according to a report co-written by  Bank of England  policy maker  Martin Weale .  Taxes need to rise by between 15.4 percent and 17.1 percent
to close a projected long-term budgetary shortfall, Weale and
David McCarthy and James Sefton said in the National Institute
of Economic and Social Research study, published on the group’s
website today.  “The key finding from this work is that forthcoming
demographic change should be expected to have substantial
budgetary implications,” the authors said. “But even if
retirement is delayed and health spending is related to
mortality rather than to age, it does seem likely that
substantial further tax increases and spending cuts will
be needed for the public finances to be sustainable.”  They added that as the adjustments are required over the
“very long term,” they have “little or no implication for
fiscal policy” in the short term.  To contact the reporter on this story:
