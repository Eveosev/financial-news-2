Rubber futures in  Tokyo  plunged 8
percent to 353.5 yen a kilogram at 9:04 a.m. local time. The
contract yesterday tumbled to the lowest level in more than four
months after the worst earthquake on record in  Japan  caused
power-supply disruptions, forcing carmakers to halt production,
raising concern demand may slump.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
