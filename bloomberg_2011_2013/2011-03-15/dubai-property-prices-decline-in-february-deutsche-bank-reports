Dubai property prices declined at a
monthly rate of 1.7 percent in February, driven mainly by new
supply, Deutsche Bank AG said.  Real-estate prices in the Persian Gulf emirate may face
“further downward pressure” this year, the bank said in a
research report dated yesterday.  “Although the pace of decline has reduced lately, we still
do not see any improvement in fundamentals that could trigger a
recovery,” the bank said.  Dubai home price slumped 62 percent from their peak in
mid-2008 after the global credit crisis caused mortgage lending
to dry up and speculative demand waned, Deutsche Bank said on
Feb. 14.  In neighboring Abu Dhabi, prices slid 45 percent, Jones
Lang LaSalle Inc. estimated.  To contact the reporter on this story:
