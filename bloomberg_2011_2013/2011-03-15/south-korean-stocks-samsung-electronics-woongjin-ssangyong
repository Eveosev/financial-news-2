Shares of the following companies
had unusual moves in  South Korea  trading. Stock symbols are in
parentheses, and prices are as of the 3 p.m. close in  Seoul .  The  Kospi index (KOSPI)  fell 2.4 percent to 1,923.92.  Chipmakers fell. Samsung Electronics Co. (005930 KS), the
world’s largest maker of memory chips, fell 4.4 percent to
860,000 won, while  Hynix Semiconductor Inc. (000660)  (000660 KS) dropped
4.7 percent to 28,700 won. Demand for chips from Japanese
electronics makers may decrease, while supplies of semiconductor
components may be disrupted after the earthquake in Japan last
week, said Jay Kim, an analyst at Mirae Asset Securities Co.  “The problem is we don’t have accurate information about
the situation in Japan,” he said. “The market is moving both
ways just on speculation.”  Makers of wind and solar power parts rose, led by Woongjin
Energy Co. (103130 KS), which advanced 3.9 percent to 14,800 won.
Taewoong Co. (044490 KS) climbed 3.8 percent to 48,700 won. The
stocks gained on speculation demand for renewable energy may
increase after the earthquake in  Japan  highlighted the risks of
nuclear power, said Cho Seung Yeon, an analyst at HMC Investment
Securities Co.  Ssangyong Cement Industrial Co. (003410 KS), South Korea’s
biggest cement maker, jumped by the maximum 15 percent for a
second day, to 8,990 won. “It’s driven by expectations that
their cement exports will increase” amid recovery work in Japan,
said Han Jong Hyo, an analyst at Shinyoung Securities Co. in
Seoul.  Samsung Fine Chemicals (004000 KS), a chemicals maker, rose
3.3 percent to 68,000. A potential shortage of naphtha will
lower production at Japanese chemical factories, while a power
shortage and port shutdowns may delay shipments, analysts led by
Lee Min Hee at Dongbu Securities Co. said in a note yesterday.    NCSoft Corp. (036570)  (036570 KS) rose 0.8 percent to 243,000 won.
