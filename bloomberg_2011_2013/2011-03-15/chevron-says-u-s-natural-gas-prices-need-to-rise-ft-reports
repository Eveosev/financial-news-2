George Kirkland, who heads oil and
gas exploration and production at  Chevron Corp. (CVX) , said U.S.
natural-gas prices need to rise substantially for the industry
to be viable in the long term, the Financial Times reported.  The increase in production of gas from shale rock and other
sources has pushed prices down to about $4 per million British
thermal units, the newspaper said.  Kirkland, speaking as Chevron set out a plan for a 20
percent increase in oil and gas production by 2017, said prices
“in the sixes and sevens” are needed in the long term to cover
investment costs, according to the FT.  To contact the reporter on this story:
