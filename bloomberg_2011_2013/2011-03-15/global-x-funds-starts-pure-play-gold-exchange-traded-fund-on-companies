Global X Funds , an exchange-traded
fund company with $1.5 billion under management, started a gold
ETF that provides a way to invest in companies that get almost
all their revenue from mining the metal.  The Global X Pure Gold Miners ETF tracks the Solactive
Global Pure Gold Miners Total Return Index, which includes
companies that got more than 95 percent of revenue last year
from mining gold, the New York-based company said in a statement
today. The biggest index components as of March 10 were  Gold
Fields Ltd. (GFI) , OAO Polyus Gold and  Kinross Gold Corp. (K) , Global X
said, citing index owner Structured Solutions AG.  Gold prices have gained 28 percent in the past year and
reached a record $1,445.70 an ounce on March 7 as oil topped
$106 a barrel amid escalating violence in the Middle East and
northern  Africa . Global X said its new fund intends to offer a
more targeted investment in gold since other indexes such as the
NYSE Arca Gold Miners Index include silver producers.  “Not all gold-miner ETFs are created equal and Global X
Funds is the first to provide one which is a pure play,” Bruno Del Ama, chief executive officer, said in the statement.  Gold futures for April delivery rose yesterday by $3.10, or
0.2 percent, to settle at $1,424.90 an ounce on the Comex in  New
York .  To contact the reporter on this story:
