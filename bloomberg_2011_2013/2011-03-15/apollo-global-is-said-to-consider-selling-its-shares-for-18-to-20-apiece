Apollo Global Management LLC is
considering a price range of $18 to $20 a share for its stock
offering, said one person with knowledge of the matter.  The private equity firm is unlikely to start marketing the
share sale today after the crisis in  Japan  spurred a plunge in
global markets, said two people, who declined to be identified
because the matter isnâ€™t public and no formal decision has been
made. New York-based Apollo, led by  Leon Black , has said it
plans to list shares on the New York Stock Exchange.  Market conditions will determine when Apollo will schedule
its roadshow to market the share sale, the people said.  Reuters reported earlier today Apollo plans to sell 26
million shares for as much as $20 each. Carolyn Sargent, a
spokeswoman for Apollo, declined to comment.  Apollo has filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission to register stock on behalf of investors who
purchased shares from the company through private transactions.
Apollo also plans to raise money through an initial public
offering, after which its shares will trade on the NYSE.  Goldman Sachs Group Inc., JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Bank of
America Corp. are the lead underwriters for the offering,
Reuters reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
