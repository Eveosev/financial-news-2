  Iraq  asked Syria to allow it to
join a regional power grid in order to import electricity from
Turkey, state-sponsored Iraqiya television said today.  The regional grid connects Syria, Iraq, Lebanon, Jordan,
Turkey, Egypt, Libya and the Palestinian territories.  Iraq has been facing violent street protests demanding
better living conditions and better electricity supply. The Arab
country, home to the worldâ€™s fifth-largest oil reserves, is
struggling to raise power supplies, which are currently at half
of its domestic demand of about 12,000 megawatts.  Output has suffered from insurgent attacks and a lack of
investment since the 2003 U.S.-led invasion that ousted the
regime of former President  Saddam Hussein .  To contact the reporter on this story:
