Fed funds, the U.S. overnight
inter-bank lending rate, is projected to open in a range of 0.16
percent to 0.19 percent, within the  Federal Reserve ’s target of
zero to 0.25 percent.  Fed funds closed at 0.25 percent yesterday after trading
from 0.10 percent to 0.25 percent and averaging 0.14 percent,
ICAP Plc, the world’s largest inter-dealer broker, said in an e-
mailed statement. ICAP’s monthly average is 0.143 percent.  The  Federal Open Market Committee , led by Chairman Ben S. Bernanke, holds a one-day meeting today in  Washington  and will
issue a statement at about 2:15 p.m. Two years after they first
pledged to keep the benchmark interest rate near zero for an
“extended period,” Fed policy makers will retain that language
today, according to 45 respondents in a Bloomberg News survey.  To contact the reporter on this story:
