  Athens  International Airport said
flights to  Greece â€™s largest city will probably increase by 7
percent this summer because of new incentives offered to
airlines.  A total 944 flights per week from 65 airlines are expected,
according to an e-mailed statement from the airport. Seven
airlines will start flying to Greece including TAP Air Portugal,
Transavia Netherlands and Belgium-based Belle Air. The summer
tourist season in Greece is from March 25 to Oct. 27.  Passengers in Lisbon, Beijing, Bologna, Edinburgh and
Dubrovnik, Croatia, will also be able to fly direct to Athens
with flights by low-cost carriers projected to increase by 14
percent, the airport said.  Greece is entering its third year of recession after
raising taxes and cutting wages to meet the conditions of a 110
billion euro ($153.4 billion) bailout package from the  International Monetary Fund  and European Union last May. Tourism
accounts for 16 percent of gross domestic product and about one
in five jobs, according to the  World Travel and Tourism Council ,
an industry group.  To contact the reporter on this story:
