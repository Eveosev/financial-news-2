The holders of rights to the late
Ansel Adams’s photographs settled a trademark-infringement
lawsuit against a Fresno,  California , man who sold prints and
posters made from negatives he claimed were created by Adams.  Rick Norsigian said in court papers that the 65 glass
negatives he bought at a garage sale in 2000 were the
photographer’s lost works. The Ansel Adams Publishing Rights
Trust disputed in its suit that the photographs were Adams’s and
accused Norsigian of “improperly and unlawfully trading” on
the photographer’s name and likeness.  In court papers filed in federal court in San Francisco
yesterday both sides said wanted to avoid “the distraction and
expense of continuing to pursue or defend” the lawsuit and a
counterclaim brought by Norsigian in December.  The settlement agreement itself is confidential, the
document said.  Bob Steinberg, an attorney representing the Adams Trust,
and Arnold Peter, a lawyer representing Norsigian, didn’t
immediately return voice-mail messages left seeking comment.  The case is Ansel Adams Publishing Rights Trust v. PRS
Media Partners LLC, 3:10-cv-03740, U.S. District Court, Northern
District of California   San Francisco ).  To contact the reporter on this story:
