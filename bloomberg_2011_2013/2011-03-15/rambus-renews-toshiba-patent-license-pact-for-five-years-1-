  Rambus Inc. (RMBS) , a seller of technology
used in computer memory, said it renewed an agreement that lets  Toshiba Corp. (6502)  license patents covering certain computer chips.  The five-year agreement governs Toshiba chips that provide
so-called dynamic random-access memory, Sunnyvale, California-
based Rambus said today in a statement. DRAM chips are used in
personal computers and servers, which control websites and
corporate networks.  “Toshiba is a recognized leader of the global semiconductor
industry,” Sharon Holt, a senior vice president at Rambus, said
in the statement.  Toshiba became Rambus’s first licensee after its founding,
Holt said. Ties to the Tokyo-based electronics and power-
equipment maker have helped make Japan the second-largest market
for Rambus, accounting for 36 percent of 2010 sales. Other
Japanese customers include Elpida Memory Inc. and Sony Corp.,
said Jeff Schreiner, an analyst at Capstone Investments Inc.  The license agreement covers SDR, DDR, DDR2, DDR3 and other
DRAM technology, according to the statement. Rambus will receive
royalty payments based on shipment of memory controllers, the
company said.  Rambus has declined 2.8 percent since March 10, the day
before  Japan  was jolted by a 9.0-magnitude earthquake and
resulting tsunami that have left thousands of people dead.
Toshiba halted operations yesterday at its plants and offices in
areas affected by rolling power outages.  Rambus fell 41 cents, or 2.1 percent, to $18.77 at 4 p.m.
in Nasdaq Stock Market trading.  To contact the reporter on this story:
