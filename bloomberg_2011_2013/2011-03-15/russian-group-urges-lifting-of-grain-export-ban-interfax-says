Russia should lift a ban on grain
exports temporarily for southern regions to stimulate spring
sowing, Interfax cited Arkady Zlochevsky, president of the
Russian Grain Union, as saying.  Southern regions have between 5 million and 6 million
metric tons of grain that can be exported, leaving space for the
new harvest, he said, according to the news agency. He also said
Russiaâ€™s grain harvest may rise to at least 80 million tons,
without ruling out changes after spring sowing. The  union 
estimates the harvest at 83 million to 86 million tons.  To contact the reporter on this story:
