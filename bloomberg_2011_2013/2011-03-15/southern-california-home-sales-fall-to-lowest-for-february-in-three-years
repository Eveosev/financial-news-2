  Southern California  home sales fell
to the lowest level for a February in three years as high
unemployment in the state discouraged potential buyers,
according to  DataQuick Information Systems Inc.   A total of 14,369 houses and condominiums sold last month
in Los Angeles, Riverside,  San Diego , Ventura, San Bernardino
and Orange counties, down 6.4 percent from a year earlier and
the lowest for a February since 2008, the San Diego-based data
seller said today in a statement.  California’s unemployment rate is  12.4 percent , compared
with the 8.9 percent national rate, according to data from the
state’s Employment Development Department. Property sales in
Southern California declined as “many potential homebuyers
stayed on the sidelines,” DataQuick said.  The median paid last month was $275,000, up 1.9 percent
from January and unchanged from a year earlier. Cash buyers were
32 percent of all purchasers, the highest portion in DataQuick’s
statistics going back to 1988 and more than double the 10-year
average of 13 percent. In January, the share was 30 percent.  “What the past two months do tell us is that lots of
people have bet, often with cash, that housing at today’s prices
will prove a solid investment,”  John Walsh , DataQuick’s
president, said in the statement.  An “abundance” of distressed properties drew investors
into the market and accounted for more than half of the month’s
total sales. Foreclosures made up 37 percent and short sales,
where the price is less than the amount owed, were about 20
percent, DataQuick said.  ‘Right Time’  “Lots of people have been waiting for the right time to
buy," Walsh said. "But they’ve got to feel more confident in
their jobs, they’ve got to qualify for a loan and, for some,
they need to be convinced prices are at or near bottom.”  Sales fell from a year earlier in five of six counties, led
by an 11 percent drop in  Riverside . Sales fell 5.9 percent in  Los Angeles , 5.8 percent in San Bernardino, 5.5 percent in San
Diego and 4.2 percent in Orange. Ventura rose 0.7 percent, the
only increase.  The median price fell 4.3 percent to $308,000 in San Diego,
1.7 percent to $410,000 in Orange, 1.4 percent to $345,000 in
Ventura and 1 percent to $195,000 in Riverside. Prices were
unchanged at $315,000 in Los Angeles and at $150,000 in San
Bernardino, said DataQuick, which compiles county records and
supplies data to public agencies, lenders and title companies.  To contact the reporter on this story:
