  Boeing Co. (BA) , the world’s second-
biggest planemaker, expects commercial-jet orders to rise this
year in dollar terms because of demand for the new 747-8 and
other widebody aircraft.  747-8 Intercontinental sales will pick up this year as
potential buyers have been waiting to see progress before
signing deals, the company’s commercial sales chief, Marlin Dailey, said in an interview in Phoenix yesterday. The 747-8
Intercontinental, the passenger version of Boeing’s biggest ever
jumbo jet, is due to fly for the first time this weekend.  “This is the year of the 747,” Dailey said. Demand for
the new plane will help widebodies account for 50 percent of
orders in dollars this year, up from 20 percent last year, he
said. The Chicago-based planemaker is due to begin deliveries of
the new 747 in the fall, about a year behind schedule.  Airlines recovered from the recession more quickly than
expected, helping Boeing book twice as many as orders in 2010 as
it had expected at the beginning of the year, Commercial
Airplanes President  Jim Albaugh  said yesterday. The total number
of orders tripled from a year earlier to 530, with a list value
of about $49.5 billion, led by a surge in demand for the single-
aisle 737.  “This year won’t achieve those numbers, but we’ll do
better in terms of dollars,” Dailey said in the interview at a
meeting in  Arizona  of the International Society of Transport
Aircraft Trading.  737s may also account for a smaller percentage of sales
because production slots are sold out through about 2016,
Albaugh said at the conference. The company is considering
boosting production of the plane by 11 percent, to 42 a month,
he said. Workers assemble 31.5 a month now at the factory in
Renton,  Washington , and will be increasing output in two steps
to 38 a month by 2013.  Boeing has already won 43  net orders  this year for its
bestselling 737. Its widebody deals include five 747-8s, which
are awaiting government approval from  China , seven 767s and 29
777s. Those orders countered the cancellation of 12 787s.  To contact the reporter on this story:
