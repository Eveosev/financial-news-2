  AngloGold Ashanti Ltd. (ANG)  said it’s
maintaining its full-year production guidance of 4.55 million
ounces to 4.75 million ounces even as heavy rains at its Sunrise
Dam gold mine in  Western Australia  reduce output.  “First quarter guidance of 1.04 million ounces will be
negatively impacted by approximately 20,000 ounces with a
consequential impact on unit total cash costs,” the company
said in a statement today.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
