Sun Biofuels Ltd.  aims to expand
its cultivation of jatropha plants in Mozambique and Tanzania
almost fivefold by 2018, Business Development Director Harry
Stourton said.  The company intends to raise sown areas in the two
countries to 20,000 hectares (49,421 acres) from 4,500 hectares,
he said yesterday in an interview in the Mozambican capital of
Maputo. It now grows jatropha on 2,500 hectares in the central
Mozambican province of Chimoio and on 2,000 hectares in
Tanzania’s Kisarwe district, west of  Dar es Salaam , he said.  “We would like to increase our planted area to 10,000
hectares in each country, and this will produce 40,000 tons of
oil,” said Stourton. “We expect to have the first commercial
press in  Mozambique  on 1,000 hectares next year, where we expect
300 tons of oil.”  Sun Biofuels is backed by  Trading Emissions Plc , a London-
listed fund focused on environmental assets that first invested
in the company in 2006. The oil pressed from 4 kilograms (8.8
pounds) of jatropha seeds can make 1 liter (0.3 gallon) of
biodiesel, according to the Renewable Energy U.K. website.  In Mozambique, Sun Biofuels has signed a memorandum of
understanding to supply state-owned Petroleos de Mocambique SA.
The London-based company also has prospects for exports to  Europe  and India, Stourton said.  “People are asking us every day if they can buy our
fuel,” he said.  A regulation governing mixing of biofuels and fossil fuels
was before ministers for approval, Salvador Namburete,
Mozambique’s energy minister, said Feb. 27.  To contact the reporter on this story:
