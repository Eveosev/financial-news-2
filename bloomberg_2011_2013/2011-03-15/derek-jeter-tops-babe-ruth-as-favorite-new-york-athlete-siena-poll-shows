Shortstop  Derek Jeter  was named the
greatest New York athlete of all time, besting fellow Yankee  Babe Ruth , according to a Siena College poll.  Two other Yankees, outfielders  Joe DiMaggio  and  Mickey Mantle , and Jets quarterback Joe Namath filled out the top five
in the polling of 801 New York state residents, followed by the
Knicks’ Patrick Ewing and Carmelo Anthony, the Siena Research
Institute said in a statement.  Jeter, who needs 74 hits to become the only player to tally
3,000 career hits all while in a Yankees uniform, received 14
percent of the vote, including 17 percent of the female vote and
10 percent of the male vote. Ruth, the Hall of Fame home run
hitter and one-time pitcher who retired in 1935, received 11
percent of the overall vote and topped Jeter among  New York  men
with 14 percent.  Major League Baseball ’s DiMaggio and Mantle,
and the  National Football League ’s Namath all garnered 4
percent.  Jeter, who has spent his entire career with the Yankees,
and Anthony, who grew up in Brooklyn and joined the Knicks in a
trade from the Denver Nuggets last month, had their strongest
support in the 18-to-34 age range. Ruth, who died in 1948, was
backed most by 50- to 64-year-olds.  The poll was conducted by the Loudonville, New York,
college between Feb. 22 and March 1. It has a plus or minus 3.5
percent margin of error.  While football narrowly topped baseball as the favorite
sport of New Yorkers by a margin of 23 percent to 22 percent,
the Yankees were the favorite team with 30 percent of the vote.
In second were the Mets and  National Basketball Association ’s
Knicks, with 11 percent, followed by the Jets (9 percent),
Giants (8 percent), Syracuse Orange (6 percent), Buffalo Bills
and Buffalo Sabres (5 percent), New York Rangers (3 percent) and
New York Islanders (0 percent, with 1 percent male vote).  Current Issues  In sports questions relating to current events, voters

labor dispute with league owners; a majority supported opponents
of the legalization of mixed martial arts in New York (41
percent to 39 percent); and 54 percent supported the expansion
