Irish Prime Minister  Enda Kenny 
said he won’t pump more money into banks until there is clarity
on how the burden of losses will be shared between the
government and bondholders.  There will be “no further monies” beyond existing
commitments for Ireland’s banks until “responsibilities” for
the costs are agreed with European partners, Kenny said in the
parliament in Dublin today. It is “gross unfairly to expect
Ireland to fork out 100 percent.”  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
