The following is the text of
Canada's business sector labor productivity report for
the fourth quarter released by  Statistics Canada .  The labour productivity of Canadian businesses rose
0.5% in the fourth quarter, after advancing 0.4% the
previous quarter.  Businesses boosted their real output (+0.9%) at a
faster pace in the fourth quarter compared with the
previous two quarters. Service-producing businesses were
the main contributor to the growth. For the first time
since the third quarter of 2009, growth in the output of
the service sector outpaced that of the goods sector.  At the same time, hours worked rose 0.4%, after edging
down 0.1% the previous quarter. Employment was unchanged
in the fourth quarter, while hours worked per job grew by
0.4%.  Services-producing businesses were responsible for the
overall increase in business productivity, as their
productivity rose 0.8% during the quarter, led by retail
trade (+2.1%), wholesale trade (+1.7%), and finance,
insurance and real estate (+0.9%).  Productivity among goods-producing businesses declined
0.3% in the fourth quarter. Productivity decreases in
manufacturing and construction were partly offset by
productivity gains in mining, oil and gas extraction and
utilities.  Business productivity was up 1.4% in 2010, after rising
0.4% in 2009. This was the largest annual advance since
2005. The 3.2% increased in the real gross domestic
product of businesses was composed of the 1.4% increase in
productivity and a 1.8% gain in hours worked. In contrast,
there were sharp declines in business output (-4.0%) and
hours worked (-4.4%) in 2009.  In the  United States , the labour productivity of
businesses increased 0.6% in the fourth quarter, the same
rate as in the previous quarter. Productivity growth in
the United States was 3.8% in 2010, a pace comparable with
that in 2009.  Labour costs per unit of production rose 0.6% for
Canadian businesses in the fourth quarter. This was
similar to the increase in each of the previous two
quarters (+0.5%).  Average compensation per hour worked once again grew
faster than productivity, advancing 1.1% in the fourth
quarter.  The average value of the Canadian dollar against the
American currency rose 2.6% in the fourth quarter.
Canadian unit labour costs measured in US dollars
increased 3.2%, after falling by 0.6% in the third
quarter.  By comparison, American businesses' unit labour costs
edged down 0.1% in the fourth quarter, after remaining
unchanged the previous quarter.  For 2010 as a whole, average hourly compensation grew
at much the same pace in Canadian and American businesses.
However, the somewhat stronger productivity performance in
the United States widened the gap in labour costs per unit
of production, which increased 0.6% in  Canada  and fell
1.5% in the United States. With the appreciation of the
Canadian dollar in 2010, the gap became even wider, as
Canadian unit labour costs in US dollars rose 11.1%.  The labour productivity figures for the fourth quarter,
released today, were revised back to the first quarter of
2010.  Note: The term "productivity" in this release refers to
labour productivity. For the purposes of this analysis,
labour productivity and related variables cover the
business sector only. Labour productivity is a measure of
real gross domestic product (GDP) per hour worked. Unit
labour cost is defined as the cost of workers' wages and
benefits per unit of real GDP.  This release includes the current year (2010) revisions
of Labour Force Survey estimates published on January 28.
Revisions for the period from 1981 to the present will be
incorporated with the June 2011 release of first quarter
2011 data. The 2010 revisions led to a 0.3 percentage-
point downward revision in the annual growth rate of
employment and hours worked for the entire economy.  To contact the reporter on this story:
