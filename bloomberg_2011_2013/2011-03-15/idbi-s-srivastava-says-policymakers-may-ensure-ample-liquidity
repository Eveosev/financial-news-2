Aneesh Srivastava, who oversees
about $355 million of assets as chief investment officer at IDBI
Federal Life Insurance Co., comments on the outlook for  India ’s
stock markets after  Japan  warned that the danger of radiation
leaks from a nuclear power plant damaged by the nation’s biggest
earthquake was increasing.  Srivastava spoke in a telephone interview from Mumbai.  “Policymakers may keep ample liquidity in the financial
system to support the markets’ recovery. The macro-economic
environment will have to be supported to bring stability to the
markets.  “Asian markets may halt the slide in the next few days
even as the volatility and uncertainty remains.  “For India, the immediate impact is going to be on the
trade with Japan. We will see weaker export numbers for the next
few quarters.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
