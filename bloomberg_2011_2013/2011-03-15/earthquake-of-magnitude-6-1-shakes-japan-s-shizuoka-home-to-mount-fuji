A 6.1-magnitude  earthquake  struck
close to  Japan ’s  Mount Fuji  late yesterday, triggering blackouts
less than a week after the nation’s worst temblor on record
killed at least 2,734 people.  The quake occurred at 10:31 p.m. local time, 42 kilometers
(26 miles) north-northeast of Shizuoka, according to the U.S.
Geological Survey. There was no tsunami threat, an official at
the  Japan Meteorological Agency  said at a midnight briefing
televised by public broadcaster NHK.  Japan’s Honshu island has been rocked by multiple
aftershocks since a March 11 quake and subsequent tsunami that
Prime Minister  Naoto Kan  described as the country’s worst crisis
since World War II. Kan yesterday called for calm as the
government battled to prevent further radiation leaks from three
quake-damaged nuclear reactors in Fukushima, 210 kilometers
north of  Tokyo .  Chubu Electric Power Co.’s Hamaoka nuclear plant in
Shizuoka prefecture was unaffected by the latest quake,
according to a notice posted at Kan’s office in Tokyo. Officials
were seeking further information on possible casualties and are
prepared to redeploy rescue workers as necessary, the notice
said.  Japanese stocks had earlier plunged, sending the benchmark
Topix index to its worst two-day slide since 1987. Losses
widened after a third explosion at Tokyo Electric Power Co.’s
Fukushima nuclear plant.  To contact the reporter on this story:
