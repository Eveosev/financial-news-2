Vetri Subramaniam, head of equities
at Religare Asset Management Co., comments on the outlook for
India’s stocks amid concern about the safety of nuclear plants
damaged by  Japan ’s earthquake last week, the worst on record.
Religare Asset had $2.3 billion in assets under management at
the end of December. Subramaniam spoke in a phone interview
today.  The Bombay Stock Exchange’s Sensitive Index, or Sensex,
lost 2.4 percent to 17,990.89 at 9:36 a.m. in Mumbai.  “To the extent to which uncertainty builds, then all risk
assets, whether it be Indian equities or any other equities,
might come a little bit under pressure.  “Purely from an economy point of view, we don’t see too
much of a fallout” for India, he said.  On market outlook:  The market could face “a little bit more of headwinds over
the next three to six months” because of “domestic factors”
such as inflation and further interest-rate increases,
Subramaniam said.  “Valuations have been looking reasonable in  India  for the
first time in two years. There are a lot of stock-picking
opportunities available.”  “If the cost of the re-construction is going to be very
significant” and events “cause the Japanese problem of debt to
come to the forefront, it will have repercussions on all markets
worldwide,” he said.  “Short-term, we will be a little cautious.”  On investment strategy:  Subramaniam said he is not altering his investment strategy.  “Our overweight positions have been more in  information
technology  and other globally-aligned areas such as oil
refiners.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
