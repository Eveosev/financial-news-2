Three U.S. private equity funds are
in talks with institutional and public investors to buy holdings
in  G Willi-Food International Ltd. (WILC) , the financial daily
Calcalist said, without saying where it got the information.   The funds are offering to buy the holdings in a deal that
will value the company at $150 million, or about 50 percent more
than its current value is on the Nasdaq Stock Market, Calcalist
said.  A call made to the offices of major shareholder  Willi Food
Investments Ltd. (WLFD)  before office hours was not immediately
answered.    To contact the editor responsible for this story:
