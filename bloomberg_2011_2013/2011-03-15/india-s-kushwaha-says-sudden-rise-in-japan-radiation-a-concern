H.S. Kushwaha, who retired as
chairman of the safety council at  India ’s  Bhabha Atomic Research
Centre  last year, comments on Tokyo Electric Power Co.’s nuclear
plant in  Japan  that is seeking to avert a meltdown. Kushwaha
spoke in a telephone interview today:  “The contamination is very, very low. The issue is not the
current levels of radiation because it’s not very much. The
concern is why has it increased by 10 times. Why has it
increased so quickly?”  “What we need to know is whether the radiation is going up
or down and why. People are concerned because this situation
should never have happened. If the emergency core cooling system
wasn’t working, then seawater cooling should’ve been sufficient.
But it appears it’s not sufficient. This is one thing they have
to explain.”  “It’s an old design. Maybe it’s the pipeline that is
connected wasn’t sufficient. Maybe it’s because it’s an old
design that assumed the core cooling system would always work.
These questions have to be answered because this is not
satisfactory.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
