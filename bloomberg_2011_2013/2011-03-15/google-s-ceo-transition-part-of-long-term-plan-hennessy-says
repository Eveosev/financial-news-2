  Google Inc. (GOOG) ’s move to put co-
founder Larry Page back in charge as chief executive officer in
April is part of a broader plan, said John L. Hennessy,
president of Stanford University.  “This should really be viewed as something that the
company was moving to over the long term,” said Hennessy, who
sits on the board of Google, owner of the largest Internet
search engine. “The time has come, I think, when Larry’s ready
to step up to that role -- and really help lead the company and
help integrate the product strategy together with the business
strategy.”    Eric Schmidt , who has been CEO of Google since 2001, did an
“incredible job” in helping lead the company over the past
several years, Hennessy said in an interview on “Bloomberg
West” today. Mountain View, California-based Google announced
in January that Schmidt will step down and become executive
chairman.  To contact the reporter on this story:
