  Ormat Industries (ORMT)  Ltd. climbed the
most in more than five weeks after the U.S. unit of the builder
and operator of geothermal plants,  Ormat Technologies Inc. (ORA) ,
signed a 20-year power-purchase agreement with NV Energy.  The shares gained as much as 3 percent, the biggest
intraday increase since Feb. 7, to 25.40 shekels and traded 1.5
percent higher at 1:43 p.m. in Tel Aviv.  Ormat Technologies will supply 30 megawatts of “clean,
renewable energy generate from the Dixie Meadows geothermal
project," the company said in a PR Newswire statement today.  The TA-25 Index of Israel’s 25 biggest companies dropped to
the lowest level in four months losing 1.9 percent to 1,230.49
as global stocks fell on concern a Japanese nuclear power plant
will leak radiation.  To contact the reporter on this story:
