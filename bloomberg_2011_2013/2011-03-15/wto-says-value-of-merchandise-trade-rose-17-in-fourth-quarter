The value of world merchandise
trade climbed 17 percent in the fourth quarter, with goods
exports up 22 percent in the full year, the  World Trade
Organization  said.  Statistics from about 70 economies representing 90 percent
of world commerce show that trade in goods slipped in December,
mainly as a result of seasonal variations, the Geneva-based WTO
 said  on its  website  yesterday. “Nonetheless, this year-end
value is above the comparable pre-crisis level of December
2008,” the trade arbiter said.  South and Central America enjoyed the fastest growth in the
quarter, with exports increasing 25 percent and imports up 30
percent from a year earlier. Exports from  Asia  advanced about 23
percent while imports grew 22 percent on the year, the WTO said.  WTO Director-General  Pascal Lamy  forecast in September that
the volume of world trade would rise 13.5 percent in 2010,
raising his March forecast for 9.5 percent growth. The figures
released yesterday refer to current U.S. dollars, meaning they
don’t take inflation into account and aren’t seasonally
adjusted.  The trade arbiter will release a more comprehensive
analysis of 2010 as well as the latest trends and a forecast for
2011 in early April.  To contact the reporter on this story:
