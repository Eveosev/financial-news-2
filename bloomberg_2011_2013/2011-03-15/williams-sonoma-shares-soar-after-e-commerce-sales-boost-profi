  Williams-Sonoma Inc. (WSM) ’s stock jumped
13 percent, its biggest one-day gain in almost two years, after
a surge in e-commerce sales helped the gourmet-cookware retailer
top fourth-quarter profit estimates.  Net income climbed 28 percent to $113.4 million, or $1.05 a
share, from $88.4 million, or 81 cents, a year earlier, the San
Francisco-based company said today in a statement. Analysts in a
Bloomberg survey had projected profit of 98 cents a share in the
period, which ended Jan. 30.  The company -- owner of Pottery Barn and West Elm, in
addition to the Williams-Sonoma stores -- is relying on Internet
orders to pull out of a sales slump. E-commerce has become
Williams-Sonoma’s fastest-growing area, as well as its most
profitable, Laura Alber, president and chief executive officer,
said on a conference call. That’s benefiting all of its chains.  “Each of our brands ended the year stronger than it
began,” she said on the call.  Williams-Sonoma’s stock rose $4.40 to $39.38 in New York
Stock Exchange composite trading, marking the biggest gain since
April 2009. The shares are trading at their highest level since
May 2006.  Direct-to-customer sales, including e-commerce and catalog
orders, rose 19 percent to $1.45 billion last year, representing
about 42 percent of all revenue. This year, Williams-Sonoma
expects the figure to reach $1.58 billion to $1.62 billion.  Total revenue climbed at a slower pace last year, rising 13
percent to $3.5 billion. Sales rose 9.7 percent in the fourth
quarter to $1.2 billion.  The company had posted two years of shrinking sales as the
recession spurred consumers to cut back on high-end housewares.  To contact the reporter on this story:
