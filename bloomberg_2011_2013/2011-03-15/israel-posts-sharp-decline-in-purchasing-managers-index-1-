  Israel ’s Purchasing Managers Index
showed a “sharp” drop in February and declined to a level that
signals contraction, following six months of expansion.  The index fell to 48 in February from 58.5 in the previous
month, Bank Hapoalim Ltd. said in an e-mailed statement today.
Figures below 50 indicate contraction, while readings above 50
signal expansion. The drop contrasted with the global trend,
which rose to its second highest ever, according to the report,
which cited a global measure published by JPMorgan Chase & Co.  “The sharp change in direction in the purchasing managers
index in February was quite surprising,” Hapoalim said in the
statement from  Tel Aviv . “It’s too early to conclude that
industrial activity has moved to a declining trend.”  Israel recovered from the global recession faster than many
developed economies, with growth accelerating to 7.7 percent in
the last quarter of 2010, the fastest pace in four years. The
economy may grow 4.3 percent this year, Harel Insurance
Investments and Financial Services Ltd. said on March 2.  The results of the survey were probably influenced by the
continuing increase in the price of commodities and energy,
Hapoalim said. Purchases for inventory dropped to 35.2 from
50.2, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
