  James Cameron , the Oscar-award
winning director of blockbuster movies such as “Avatar” and
“Titanic,” said having separate production teams for content
filmed in 2-D and then converted into 3-D isn’t efficient.  Speaking at the Abu Dhabi Media Summit, Cameron urged
studios to film in the more expensive 3-D format. Overall box
office revenue has risen because of the higher price of tickets
for 3-D films, even as fewer tickets have been sold, he said.  In an on-stage interview with  James Murdoch , the head of
New Corp.’s European and Asian operations, Cameron said 3-D adds
to the value of entertainment, including sporting events and
drama. Cameron said he opts to make big-screen films such as 3-D
flicks that must be watched in a movie theater.  “I think it will be difficult in a few year’s time for
photographers and filmmakers to say that 3-D is too tricky to
figure out,” and then the process will become much more
mainstream, Cameron said.  Murdoch and Cameron opened the second annual  Abu Dhabi 
Media Summit, which features speakers including Nokia Chief
Executive Officer Stephen Elop, Ericsson CEO Hans Vestberg and
Google Inc. Chief Business Officer Nikesh Arora.  Avatar is the world’s top-grossing film, having taken about
$2.8 billion since its December 2009 release, according to Box
Office Mojo, a website for the  movie industry .  --Editors: Robert Valpuesta, Simon Thiel.  To contact the reporter on this story:
