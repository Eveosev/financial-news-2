  Finland  may need to increase
guarantees to the European bailout fund as European leaders seek
ways to let the facility utilize its full 440 billion-euro
capacity, Finland’s Finance Minister Jyrki Katainen said, state-
owned broadcaster reported today.
  Finland seeks to assess all the options before deciding on the
guarantees, Katainen told YLE. The options could include
lowering the facility’s AAA credit rating, earmarking income to
pay for debt received from the fund or increasing capital
available to the fund, Katainen said according to Helsinki-based
YLE. 
  The exact measures will be agreed on by the summer, YLE said.  Click here for web link in Finnish  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
