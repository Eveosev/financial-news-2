Carbon allowances in the European
Union’s emissions-trading system rose to their highest level in
more than 10 months as power and natural gas advanced and  Barclays Capital  said it was “bullish” on emissions prices.  EU permits for delivery in December gained as much as 1.9
percent to 16.91 euros a metric ton, the strongest intraday
level since May 4, and traded at 16.85 euros as of 8:06 a.m. on
the ICE Futures Europe exchange in  London .  To contact the reporter on this story:
