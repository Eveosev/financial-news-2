The German BDI industry federation
regards the closure of several of the country’s nuclear reactors
as “justifiable,”  Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung  reported,
citing Hans-Peter Keitel, the head of the federation.  The temporary shutdown of the reactors is “manageable”
for the country’s power supply, the German newspaper cited
Keitel as saying in an article that will be published tomorrow.  German  Chancellor Angela Merkel  said today the country
will halt nuclear reactors accounting for 25 percent of its
atomic energy capacity as part of a safety review after
explosions at reactors in  Japan . It will keep its seven oldest
nuclear reactors offline as part of a nationwide safety review
to run through June, Merkel told reporters in Berlin.  To contact the reporter on this story:
