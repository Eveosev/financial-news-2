  Vietnam ’s sovereign bonds declined
after the government forecast economic growth would be slower
this quarter than in the three months through December.  Gross domestic product will increase 5.4 percent to 5.6
percent in the first quarter from a year earlier, the government
said in a  statement  on its website today. That would be slower
than the 7.3 percent expansion in the fourth quarter. The
economy “has not yet stabilized” and growth is expected to
slow this quarter, the statement said.  Five-year bond yields climbed three basis points to 11.90
percent as of 4:50 p.m. in Hanoi, according to a daily fixing
from banks compiled by Bloomberg. A basis point is 0.01
percentage point.  Lending rates are still at high levels and prices continue
to fluctuate, “impacting production and people’s lives,” the
statement said.  The  consumer price index  will rise 1.8 percent to 2.2
percent in March from the month before, the government forecast
today. Prices advanced 2.1 percent in February and 1.7 percent
in January, according to figures from the General Statistics
Office in Hanoi.  The dong was unchanged at 20,868 per dollar, according to
prices from banks compiled by Bloomberg. The central bank set
the  reference rate  at 20,663, the same as yesterday, its website
showed. The currency is allowed to trade up to 1 percent on
either side of that rate.  --Nguyen Dieu Tu Uyen. With assistance from Diep Pham in Hanoi.
