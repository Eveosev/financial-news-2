Amit Nigam, a  fund manager  at BNP
Paribas Asset Management India Private Ltd. in Mumbai, which
manages $1 billion in assets, comments on the outlook for global
stocks after  Japan ’s Prime Minister  Naoto Kan  said the danger of
further leaks from a damaged nuclear power plant was increasing.  The Bombay Stock Exchange’s Sensitive Index, or Sensex,
slumped 382.90 points, or 2.1 percent, to 18,056.58 as of 10:06
a.m. in Mumbai, set for its steepest drop since Feb. 24  “As and when we are able to evaluate and estimate the
impact on Japan, it will lead to some stability. The situation
is very unpredictable, which is leading to so much volatility.
The market will start stabilizing the moment we are able to
assess the damage.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
