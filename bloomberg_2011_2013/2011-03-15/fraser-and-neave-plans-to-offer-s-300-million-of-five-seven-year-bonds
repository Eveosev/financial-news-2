  Fraser and Neave Ltd. (FNN) , the
Singapore-based drinks maker and brewer, hired DBS Group
Holdings Ltd. and CIMB Group Holdings Bhd. to help it raise
S$300 million ($235 million) from a sale of bonds.  The company plans to offer S$150 million of five-year, 2.48
percent bonds and the same amount of seven-year notes with a
3.15 percent coupon, it said in a  Singapore  stock exchange
statement today.  The sale would be Fraser and Neave’s largest in Singapore
dollars since June 2007, when it issued S$300 million of 3.405
percent, five-year notes, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The company, whose  brands  include Magnolia milk and
ICE Mountain water, has S$250 million of bonds due this year and
S$670 million of bonds and loans due in 2012, the data show.  Fraser and Neave reported a 15 percent rise in first-
quarter profit to S$157 million last month. About one third of
sales are generated in Singapore, one fifth in  Malaysia  and the
rest in  Southeast Asia  and the Pacific, Bloomberg data show.  The company’s S$200 million of 6 percent, 10-year notes
sold in April 2009 are trading at 114.46 cents on the dollar to
yield 3.903 percent, Standard Chartered Plc prices show. Its
3.405 percent notes are trading at 102.18 cents to yield 1.603
percent.  DBS is the sole arranger of the offer while DBS and CIMB
are joint underwriters and joint lead managers of the placement,
the statement said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
