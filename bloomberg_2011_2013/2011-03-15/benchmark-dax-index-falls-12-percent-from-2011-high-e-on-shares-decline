German stocks tumbled the most in
almost nine months, sending the benchmark  DAX Index (DAX)  down 10
percent from this year’s high, led by a selloff in utilities as
the government halted the nation’s oldest nuclear reactors.    E.ON AG (EOAN)  and  RWE AG (RWE)  declined for a second day as Germany
conducted a nationwide safety review following explosions at
earthquake damaged reactors in Japan.  Munich Re , the world’s
largest reinsurer, fell to five-month low while  Daimler AG (DAI)  and  Volkswagen AG (VOW)  led carmakers lower.  The DAX Index dropped 3.2 percent to 6,647.66 at the 5:30
p.m. close in Frankfurt, sending the benchmark down 10 percent
from its Feb. 18 high, a level that signifies a correction to
some investors. The broader HDAX Index dropped 3 percent today.  “Nuclear represents a significant profit center for E.ON
and RWE, potential early closures create downside risks to
earnings and valuations,” wrote Deborah Wilkens, a London-based
analyst at Goldman Sachs Group Inc. in a report to clients.
“The government’s changed view on the outlook for nuclear
lifetimes creates uncertainties.”  German stocks have declined 7.2 percent since  Japan ’s
largest earthquake on record struck off the country’s north-east
coast on March 11, shaking buildings violently in Tokyo and
triggering a tsunami that that engulfed towns north of the
capital.  Tokyo Electric Power Co.’s stricken nuclear power plant in
Fukushima was today rocked by more explosions and a fire as
workers struggled to avert the risk of a meltdown.  E.ON, RWE  Prime Minister  Naoto Kan  appealed for calm as he said the
danger of further radiation leaks was rising at the crippled
nuclear facility, 135 miles (220 kilometers) north of Tokyo. Sea
water is being pumped to cool the reactors and prevent the
uncontrolled release of radioactive material.  E.ON,  Germany ’s largest utility, lost 2.8 percent to 21.25
euros while RWE, which today said it is taking its Biblis Block
A nuclear reactor in Germany offline to undertake security
checks, retreated 3.6 percent to 43.995 euros.  German Chancellor Angela Merkel halted the reactors as part
of the safety review. She today said in a meeting in Berlin that
facilities “that began operation before the end of 1980 are
being stopped for duration of the moratorium.”  Germany’s 17 nuclear reactors accounted for 23 percent of
the power generated in Germany last year, according to the BDEW
utility industry lobby group.  Alternative energy companies extending yesterday’s gains.
SolarWorld AG surged 23 percent to 10.64 euros while Q-Cells SE
jumped 17 percent to 3.50 euros. Wind-turbine maker  Nordex SE (NDX1) 
rallied 19 percent to 8.15 euros.  Daimler, Volkswagen, BMW  Daimler AG, which owns Japanese truckmaker Mitsubishi Fuso,
retreated for a fourth day, falling 4 percent to 45.28 euros.
Volkswagen AG retreated 3.8 percent to 108.95 euros, while
Bayerische Motoren Werke AG slid 2.7 percent to 54.29 euros.  Munich Re lost 2.5 percent to 105.3 euros, tracking a
retreat in European reinsurers amid concern the industry may
face claims of as much as 2.8 trillion yen ($34 billion) related
to the earthquake in Japan.  Hannover Re , the world’s third-
biggest reinsurer, fell 1.9 percent to 37.13 euros.  To contact the reporter on this story:
