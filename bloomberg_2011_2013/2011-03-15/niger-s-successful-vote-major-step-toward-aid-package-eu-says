Niger’s successful presidential
election on March 12 marked a “major step” in a process that
will lead to the complete resumption of development aid to the
West African nation by the European Union, the EU  said .  The EU congratulated opposition leader Mahamadou Issoufou,
who won the runoff election with 58 percent of the vote,
according to preliminary results from Niger’s electoral
commission.  “The poll was a major step towards the restoration of full
cooperation between Niger and the European Union,” said a joint
statement from EU foreign policy chief Catherine Ashton and
Commissioner for Development Andris Piebalgs.  The EU is scheduled to give Niger 458 million euros ($635
million) in development aid between 2008 and 2013.  The EU suspended some aid following a February 2010 coup
that toppled former President Mamadou Tandja. In July 2010 the
European Commission proposed  restoring  part of the aid package
after the military junta proposed a plan to return the country
to civilian rule.  Issoufou, 60, takes the helm of  Africa ’s second-largest
uranium producer as an al-Qaeda-linked group has stepped up
attacks targeting foreigners in the country of 16 million. A
drought from 2009 to 2010 left one in five of the nation’s
children under five years of age malnourished, according to the  World Food Programme .  To contact the reporters on this story:
