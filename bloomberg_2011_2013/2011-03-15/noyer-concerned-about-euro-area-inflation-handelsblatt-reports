Bank of France Governor  Christian Noyer  is concerned about inflation in the euro area and said
that continued increases in oil and raw material prices may
raise inflation expectations,  Handelsblatt  reported, citing an
interview.  Noyer also commented on the stress tests for European banks
that the new European Banking Authority is preparing, saying
that different  capital ratios  for different countries wouldnâ€™t
be allowed,  Handelsblatt  reported. The EBA will do everything it
can to make sure ratios are harmonized, the German newspaper
cited Noyer as saying in an article that will be published
tomorrow.  To contact the reporter on this story:
