The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index
reached its low for 2011 when the 9-magnitude earthquake in
Japan earlier sent the benchmark to 1,261.12, according to  JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) ’s  Thomas Lee .  The gauge for U.S. equities has declined as much as 3.3
percent this week after Japan’s biggest earthquake on record
struck March 11. The  S&P 500  ended the day down 1.1 percent to
1,281.87, paring its 2011 advance to 1.9 percent and extending
the retreat since Feb. 18 to 4.6 percent, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  The benchmark index will rise to 1,425 by the end of the
year, with  oil prices  retreating from their highs and global
growth benefiting from Japan’s rebuilding, according to Lee’s
year-end estimate. His forecast compares with the average of
1,400 from 13 strategists surveyed by Bloomberg News.  “The unfortunate events in  Japan  have brought us to our
estimated low for the year,” Lee wrote today. “In a nutshell,
we see the sell-off as creating potentially a very bullish
opportunity.”  The Nikkei 225 Stock Average plunged 11 percent earlier
today, bringing its loss since yesterday’s open to 16 percent.
The Nikkei and Topix index fell as much as 14 percent earlier,
the biggest intraday retreats since October 1987, on concern a
nuclear accident would cripple the economy.  Oil’s Surge  Oil surged as much as 28 percent this year to a high of
$106.95 a barrel as political unrest in Egypt and Libya
threatened to curtail supplies. Since then, the price has
dropped 9.1 percent, settling at $97.18 a barrel today on the  New York Mercantile Exchange .  The retreat is a positive for stock investors, as oil was
“the biggest risk to  consumer spending ,” the world economy and
earnings, Lee wrote. S&P 500 companies are forecast to grow
profits 16 percent this year, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  Global growth may also benefit when Japan, the world’s
third-largest economy, begins to rebuild and other countries
increase their production and output where Japan’s drops, he
added.  To contact the reporter on this story:
