The German Embassy  in  Tokyo  said it
recommended its citizens in  Japan  consider leaving the country
following last week’s earthquake and explosions at Tokyo
Electric Power Co.’s nuclear power plant in Fukushima.  About 100 Germans live in the Tohoku area, where a
magnitude 9 quake struck Japan on March 11, while 2,600 people
are in Tokyo and 900 in the Kanagawa area, said Mari Shindo, a
spokeswoman at the embassy.  Families with small children should especially consider
leaving, the embassy said on its website. The power plant, where
four of six reactors have been damaged by explosions, is 135
miles (220 kilometers) north of Tokyo.  The death toll from the earthquake and tsunami rose to
2,478 at 2 p.m., according to the  National Police Agency  in
Tokyo.  To contact the reporters on this story:
