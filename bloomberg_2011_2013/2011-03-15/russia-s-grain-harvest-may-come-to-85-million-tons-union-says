The Russian grain harvest may reach
85 million metric tons this year, including at least 40 million
tons of wheat, said Arkady Zlochevsky, president of  Russia ’s
Grain Union.  The estimate assumes sowing of cereals on 31 million
hectares (76.6 million acres) this spring, he said today at a
press conference in Moscow. The harvest may include 16.5 million
tons of feed barley, according to Zlochevsky.  Russia will need to import about 1 million tons of grain in
the coming marketing season, Zlochevsky said. The  union 
increased its forecast for carryover stockpiles to between 17
million and 18 million tons from 15 million tons, he said.  Crop losses for winter grains are estimated at between 1.5
million and 1.6 million hectares of the total 15.5 million
hectares that were seeded, Zlochevsky said.  A lack of finance for farmers is the main risk to the scale
of spring sowing, according to Zlochevsky. Farmers have
permission to extend loans only until April, he said.  Only 76 percent of seeds available for planting meet
requirements, which may reduce yields, Zlochevsky said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
