Former Manhattan Borough President  Andrew Stein  was sentenced to three years’ probation and ordered
to perform 500 hours of community service after failing to pay
his 2008 income taxes.  Stein was arrested in May along with investment adviser
Kenneth  Ira Starr  and charged with committing a tax crime and
with lying to investigators. In December, he pleaded guilty to a
misdemeanor charge of failure to pay taxes.  “I was irresponsible in my financial affairs in not paying
my taxes when I should have,” Stein told U.S. Magistrate Judge
Ronald Ellis at his sentencing in Manhattan federal court today.
“It was wrong.”  Stein, who faced a possible jail sentence, said after the
hearing that he was grateful for being sentenced to probation
and community service. Stein also served as  New York  City
Council president from 1985 to 1993. The position was abolished
in 1994.  The government originally alleged that Starr routed
investor funds to entities including  Wind River  LLC, a shell
company created by Stein. At a hearing in May, Assistant U.S.
Attorney William Harrington said prosecutors were probing
Stein’s use of Wind River when they came across Starr’s alleged
fraud.  Starr, whose celebrity clients included actors Sylvester Stallone and Wesley Snipes, pleaded guilty to defrauding his
clients out of $33.3 million and was sentenced March 3 to 7 1/2
years in prison.  The case is U.S. v. Stein, 1:10-cr-01171, U.S. District
Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
