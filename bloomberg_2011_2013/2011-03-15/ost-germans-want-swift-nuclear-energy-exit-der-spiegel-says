The majority of Germans are in
favor of a swift exit from nuclear power,  Der Spiegel  reported,
citing a survery conducted for ARD television by Infratest.  More than two-thirds, or 70 percent, said an incident
similar to the situation in  Japan , where workers are struggling
to avert the risk of a meltdown at the Fukushima Dai-Ichi power
plant following last weekâ€™s earthquake and tsunami, is possible
in  Germany , according to the poll.  Fifty-three percent of those surveyed said German reactors
should be inactivated as soon as possible, according to the
report.   Click here for web link  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
