The Australian dollar fell to a
six-week low against the yen after the  Reserve Bank â€™s latest
minutes damped speculation interest rates will rise and as a
nuclear accident in  Japan  curbed demand for riskier assets.  The Aussie fell 1.1 percent to 81.57 yen as of 1:59 p.m. in
Sydney, after weakening to 81.01 yen, the weakest since Jan. 31.  To contact the reporter on this story:
