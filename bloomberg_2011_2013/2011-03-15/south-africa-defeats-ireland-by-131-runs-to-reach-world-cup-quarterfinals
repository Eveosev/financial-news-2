  South Africa  beat Ireland by 131
runs to reach the quarterfinals of the Cricket  World Cup  and
eliminate the Irish.  Ireland won the toss and decided to field. JP Duminy’s 99
led the  South Africans , who looked in trouble at 95-4 when
Jacques Kallis was run out for 19. Duminy combined with Colin
Ingram for 87 runs and Johan Botha for 65 to settle the victors,
who finished their 50 overs on 272-7.  The Irish couldn’t match South Africa’s batting. They fell
to 51-4 at one point, and finished 141 all out after 33.2 overs.
Morne Morkel took 3 wickets for 33 runs for the South Africans.  South Africa moves past  India  to the top of the Group B
after today’s win at Eden Gardens in Kolkata, India. South
Africa has 8 points from 5 games, with India on 7 points from 5.
The West Indies is on 6 after 4 games, tied with Bangladesh,
which has played 5 matches. England is in fifth on 5 points
after 5 games, and wouldn’t make the quarterfinals. That would
send them home along with Ireland, on 2 points, and the
Netherlands, which has no points.  The top four teams in each of seven-member groups make the
quarterfinals. The event ends April 2.  To contact the reporter on this story:
