European employment increased in
the fourth quarter as companies in  Germany , France and  Italy 
boosted hiring, offsetting declines in debt-strapped nations.  Payrolls in the euro region rose 0.1 percent from the third
quarter, when they stalled, the European Union statistics office
in Luxembourg said today. From a year earlier, payrolls
increased 0.3 percent after declining 0.2 percent in the
previous three months.  In Germany,  Europe ’s largest economy, employment rose 0.2
percent from the third quarter, while French and Italian
payrolls increased 0.2 percent and 0.4 percent respectively. In
Spain, which is struggling to lower the region’s third-largest
budget shortfall, employment dropped 0.3 percent, today’s report
showed. Portuguese payrolls slipped 0.6 percent.  In 2010, employment fell 0.5 percent both in the euro
region and the European Union, the statistics office said. In
the currency region, an estimated 144.8 million people were
employed in the fourth quarter.  To contact the reporter on this story:
