OAO  Raspadskaya (RASP)  slid to its lowest
intraday level in more than three months after Russia’s Anti-
Monopoly Service said the coal producer broke antitrust rules by
charging different prices for coking-coal concentrate depending
on the customer.  The stock lost as much as 3.8 percent to 182.69 rubles, its
lowest intraday level since Nov. 26, and traded down 1.1 percent
at 187.86 rubles as of 11:14 a.m. in Moscow.  The company faces fines of between 1 percent and 15 percent
of last year’s sales, the watchdog said on its website last
yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
