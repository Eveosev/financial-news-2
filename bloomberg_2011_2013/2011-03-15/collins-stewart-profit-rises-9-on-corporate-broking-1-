  Collins Stewart Plc (CLST) , Britain’s
largest stockbroker, posted a 9 percent increase in full-year
profit, fueled by gains at its corporate broking and mergers
advisory business.  Profit rose to 14.6 million pounds ($23.5 million) last
year from 13.4 million pounds a year earlier, the London-based
firm said today in a statement.  “The first two months of this year are showing good growth
compared with the same period last year,” Chairman Tim Ingram
said in the statement. The company is also proposing to change
its name to Collins Stewart Hawkpoint Plc, it said.  Collins Stewart will pay a final dividend of 1.7 pence
a share.  To contact the reporters on this story:
