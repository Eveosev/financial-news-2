Intercontinental Exchange Inc.
doesn’t need to make acquisitions to remain successful, Chief
Executive Officer Jeff Sprecher said at a conference in  Florida .  “We’ve been really prudent in our M&A. You wouldn’t know
it from reading the papers today,” Sprecher said at the Futures
Industry Association meeting in  Boca Raton . “We don’t have to
do anything to remain successful for our shareholders.”    Nasdaq OMX Group Inc. (NDAQ)  is working with Atlanta-based ICE,
the world’s largest credit-swaps clearinghouse, on a possible
bid for  NYSE Euronext (NYX)  to counter an offer from  Deutsche Boerse
AG (DB1) , a person familiar with the talks said yesterday.  Sprecher declined to comment on a potential joint bid for
NYSE Euronext.  To contact the reporter on this story:
