OPEC’s compliance with record
supply cuts rose in February as violent clashes in  Libya  cut the
country’s oil production, the  International Energy Agency  said.  The producer group’s 11 members bound by quotas pumped
27.37 million barrels a day last month, implying compliance of
40 percent, the Paris-based IEA said today in its monthly
report. That’s up from a two-year low in January of 37 percent.  Supply from all 12 nations of the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting countries, including Iraq, decreased by about 90,000
barrels a day to 30.05 million barrels, the IEA said. Production
declined in Libya,  Angola ,  Nigeria  and Venezuela.  “Output in February was down marginally in the wake of
civil unrest in Libya and the shut-in of around two thirds of
the country’s oil production by early March,” the IEA said.  Other OPEC members, including  Saudi Arabia , boosted output
to offset lost Libyan production, the agency said. “With Libya
now effectively in a state of full-scale civil war and
production down to a trickle, other OPEC countries may need to
further ramp up production in the weeks and months ahead to
offset lost output of 1.5 to 1.6 million barrels a day,” the
IEA said.  OPEC, responsible for about 40 percent of world crude
supply, announced its biggest-ever supply cuts in late 2008 as
global demand collapsed. The decision set a cap at 24.845
million barrels a day for 11 of its members. Adherence to the
reduction eased last year and in 2009 as prices rebounded.  The compliance percentages are calculated based on the 11
nations targeting a 4.2 million barrel-a-day reduction from a
base production rate of 29.045 million barrels a day in
September 2008.  Saudi Arabia, OPEC’s largest producer, pumped 8.9 million
barrels a day in February, up 100,000 barrels a day from
January, the IEA estimated.    Iraq ’s daily output grew to 2.68 million barrels a day last
month, the highest in more than two decades.  OPEC’s 12 members are Algeria, Angola, Ecuador,  Iran , Iraq,
Kuwait, Libya, Nigeria, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab
Emirates and Venezuela. Iraq is exempt from the quota system.  To contact the reporter on this story:
