DP World Ltd. (DPW)  expects full-year
Ebitda to be in line with analysts’ estimates of $1.31 billion
as the world’s third-largest port operator manages costs and
benefits from lower net financing charges.  Container volumes rose 2.4 percent to 56.1 million twenty-
foot equivalent units across it operations last year, DP World
said  in a statement  to Nasdaq Dubai today. Adjusting for
divestment of four joint-venture terminals, like-for-like gross
container volume growth was 3.7 percent.  “After a strong start to the year we had a challenging
second half,” Chief Executive Officer Mohammed Sharaf said in
the statement. “Our tight focus on cost management and higher
quality revenue mean we still expect to achieve Ebitda in line
with expectations for 2012. Lower net financing charges will
benefit reported profit before tax.”  The  mean estimate  of 11 analysts is for earnings before
interest, taxes depreciation and amortization of $1.31 billion,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. DP World said growth in
gross container volumes was driven by the Americas, Asia Pacific
and Middle East regions, where the company focused on delivering
improved efficiencies and productivity.  ’Exciting Year’  DP World, which operates more than 60 terminals in six
continents, said it is on track to open new capacity in Santos
in  Brazil , Jebel Ali in the  United Arab Emirates  and London
Gateway in the U.K. this year.  “2013 is an exciting year for us,” Sharaf said. “Whilst
there remains much uncertainty in the macro economy, we believe
we are well-positioned to make further progress in 2013.”  DP World shares gained 21 percent last year. The stock
closed at $13.05 in Dubai yesterday, taking the increase this
month to 12 percent. The company expects to announce preliminary
results on March 20.  To contact the reporter on this story:
