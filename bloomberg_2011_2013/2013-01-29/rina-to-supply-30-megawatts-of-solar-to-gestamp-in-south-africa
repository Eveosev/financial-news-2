Trina Solar Ltd. (TSL) , the third-biggest
solar cell maker, won a contract to supply 30 megawatts of
modules to Gestamp Corp.’s solar unit for two projects in South
Africa.  Trina will deliver the modules in the third quarter for
projects in the towns of Prieska and De Aar, the Changzhou,
China-based company said today in a statement. Gestamp Solar is
a closely held developer based in Madrid.  This is the first major order for Trina in South Africa as
it seeks to expand beyond European markets where governments
have reduced incentives for renewable energy.  The order “will enable us to strengthen our presence in
this market, where the solar sector is booming,” Trina Chairman
and Chief Executive Officer Gao Jifan said in the statement.  JA Solar Holdings Co. and  Suntech Power Holdings Co. (STP)  are
the two largest solar cell makers by production capacity.  To contact the reporter on this story:
