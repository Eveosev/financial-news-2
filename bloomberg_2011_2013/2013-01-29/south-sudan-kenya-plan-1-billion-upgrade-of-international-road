Kenya , East Africa’s largest
economy, and neighboring South  Sudan  will upgrade a 960-
kilometer (597-mile) road connecting the two nations to boost
trade, Kenyan Roads Minister Franklin Bett said.  The route linking the western Kenyan town of Eldoret with
South Sudan’s capital, Juba, will be upgraded to international
standards, he said at a conference in Nairobi today. The  World
Bank  will coordinate syndicated loans for the project, which
will cost $1 billion, according to a statement from Bett and
Gier Aluong, his South Sudanese counterpart, published in the
Daily Nation newspaper.  The East African countries are developing road, rail and
pipeline links to boost trade in the region. Last year, Kenya
and  South Sudan  agreed to build a 2,000-kilometer pipeline to
the Kenyan coastal town of Lamu. In March, construction began on
a deepwater port that will serve Kenya’s underdeveloped north,
South Sudan, Ethiopia and Uganda.  South Sudan plans to build almost 5,000 kilometers of roads
over 10 years at a cost of $6.6 billion, Aluong said in a
statement handed to reporters in Nairobi.  The majority of South Sudan’s 7,000 kilometers of roads are
unpaved and in disrepair, according to the U.S. Central
Intelligence Agency’s World Factbook. South Sudan became
Africa’s newest nation when it seceded from Sudan in July 2011.  To contact the reporter on this story:
