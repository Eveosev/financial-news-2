South African corn futures gained
for a second day on concern that there won’t be enough rain in
the coming days in one of the country’s main growing regions.  Yellow corn for delivery in July, the most active contract,
rose 0.3 percent to 2,098 rand ($232) a metric ton by the close
on the South African Futures Exchange in Johannesburg. The white
variety increased 0.1 percent to 2,188 rand a ton.  Rain has been predicated for today and tomorrow for
Bothaville in the Free State, where 40 percent of the nation’s
grain is produced. There will be no rain on Jan. 31 and Feb. 1,
the  South African Weather Service  said on its website.  “There are concerns that there won’t be enough rain in the
Free State, so that affects prices,” Theo Venter, an analyst at
Klerksdorp, South Africa-based Senwes Ltd., said by phone.  South Africa  is the the continent’s largest producer of
corn, also called maize. Yellow corn is mainly used as  animal
feed  while the white variety is a staple food.  Wheat for delivery in March gained 0.3 percent to 3,660
rand a ton.  To contact the reporter on this story:
