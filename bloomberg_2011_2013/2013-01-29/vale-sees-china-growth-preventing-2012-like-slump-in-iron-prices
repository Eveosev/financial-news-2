Vale SA (VALE3) , the biggest iron-ore
producer, said prices of the steel-making ingredient are
supported by prospects of China growing 6 percent to 7 percent.  Vale is optimistic on prices as China is set to build up
steel stockpiles that are below average and increase spending on
infrastructure and construction, Investor Relations Director
Roberto Castello Branco told a gathering of investors today in
 Rio de Janeiro , where the company is based.  China growing at 7 percent is “fantastic” and prices
shouldn’t fall as they did last year, he said. Vale expects
world industrial production to grow 2.8 percent in 2013 while
the U.S. and Chinese economies may exceed forecasts, he said.  China grew 7.9 percent in the fourth quarter after slowing
in the previous seven periods, government data showed Jan. 18.
The expansion will accelerate over the next nine months,
according to as many as 43 economists surveyed by Bloomberg.  Iron ore  for immediate delivery was unchanged today at
$148.40 a metric ton, according to a  price index  compiled by The
Steel Index Ltd. The gauge has rallied 71 percent from a three
year-low of $86.7 on Sept. 5.  To contact the reporter on this story:
