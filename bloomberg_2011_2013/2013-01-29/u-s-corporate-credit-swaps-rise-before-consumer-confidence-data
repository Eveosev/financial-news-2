A gauge of U.S. corporate credit
risk increased for a second day as  consumer confidence  fell to
the lowest level in more than a year.  The Markit CDX North American Investment Grade Index, a
credit-default swaps benchmark that investors use to hedge
against losses or to speculate on creditworthiness, added 0.4
basis point to a mid-price of 86.2 basis points at 5:35 p.m. in
 New York , according to prices compiled by Bloomberg.  The Conference Board’s consumer confidence index decreased
to 58.6, the weakest since November 2011, from a revised 66.7 in
December, figures from the New York-based private research group
showed today. Softening economic data may stoke investor concern
that a slowdown will reduce companies’ ability to repay debt.  The  Federal Open Market Committee  will issue its policy
statement tomorrow and is expected to keep the U.S. federal
funds target unchanged at between zero and 0.25 percent, a
Bloomberg survey projects. Investors are also waiting for jobs
figures scheduled to be released later this week.  “I would put the FOMC and employment data way ahead of
everything else. They will have a huge impact on spreads and
show at what growth the economic engine is running,”  William Larkin , a fixed-income  money manager  who helps oversee $500
million at Cabot Money Management Inc., said in a telephone
interview from Salem,  Massachusetts .  The credit-swaps index typically rises as investor
confidence deteriorates and falls as it improves. The contracts
pay the buyer face value if a borrower fails to meet its
obligations, less the value of the defaulted debt. A basis point
equals $1,000 annually on a contract protecting $10 million of
debt.  Berkshire Bonds  Warren Buffett ’s  Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (BRK/A) , which its 82-
year-old chairman built into a $241 billion company in market
value with takeovers and stock picks, sold $2.6 billion of bonds
in four parts to pay down debt due next month.  Berkshire issued $300 million of 0.8 percent, three-year
notes to yield 37.5 basis points more than similar-maturity
Treasuries, $800 million of 1.55 percent, five-year securities
at a spread of 70 basis points, $500 million of 3 percent, 10-
year bonds at a spread of 110 basis points and $1 billion of 4.5
percent, 30-year debt at a spread of 140 basis points, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The  risk premium  on the Markit CDX North American High
Yield Index decreased 0.1 basis point to 433.4 basis points,
Bloomberg prices show.  The average relative yield on junk-rated debt rose 2 basis
points to 459 basis points or 4.59 percentage points, led by
spreads on the bonds of industrial companies, which increased
5.1 basis points to 485 basis points, Bloomberg data show.  High-yield, high-risk debt is rated below Baa3 by Moody’s
Investors Service and lower than BBB- at  Standard & Poor’s . A
basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  To contact the reporter on this story:
