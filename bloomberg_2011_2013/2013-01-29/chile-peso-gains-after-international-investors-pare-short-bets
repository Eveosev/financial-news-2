Chile’s peso rose after
international investors reduced bets against the currency to a
16-month low.  The peso appreciated 0.2 percent to 471.90 per  U.S. dollar 
at the close in Santiago, extending its rally since the end of
2011 to 10 percent, the most among major Latin American
currencies tracked by Bloomberg.  International investors in the Chilean peso forwards market
had a $1.2 billion short peso position on Jan. 25, the lowest
since September 2011, according to data published today by the
central bank. A short is a bet an asset will lose value.  “The underlying trend is for appreciation,”
appreciation and carry is a fundamental part of it,” said Matias
 Madrid , chief economist at Banco Penta in Santiago. He said he
expects the peso will strengthen beyond 470 in “coming days.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
