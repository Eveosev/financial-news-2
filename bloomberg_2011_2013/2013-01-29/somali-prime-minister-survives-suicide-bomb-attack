Somali Prime Minister Abdi Farah Shirdon Saaid survived a suicide bomb blast outside his home in
the capital, Mogadishu, lawmaker Abdullahi Omar Abdshir said.  “The prime minister is safe and unharmed, but five
security guards” may have been killed in the explosion today,
Abdshir said in a phone interview from the city.  Somalia has had 10 different prime ministers over the past
decade as it has sought to bring stability to the country after
21 years of civil war. African troops are fighting alongside the
government to win back territory from Islamist militants.  Over the past 12 months, troops with the African Union
Mission in Somalia, or Amisom, and the Ethiopian military have
removed al-Shabaab, a militia linked to al-Qaeda, from key areas
including Mogadishu, the port of Kismayo and Baidoa, the
nation’s second-largest city.  Somali lawmakers in September elected Hassan Sheikh Mohamoud as president. Shirdon Saaid became prime minister in
October.  To contact the reporters on this story:
