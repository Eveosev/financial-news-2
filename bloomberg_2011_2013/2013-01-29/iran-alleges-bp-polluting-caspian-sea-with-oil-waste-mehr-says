Iran  is threatening to sue  BP Plc (BP/) ,
accusing the London-based energy company of polluting the
 Caspian Sea , the  Mehr  news agency reported, citing an Iranian
environmental official.  BP produces oil offshore in neighboring Azerbaijan and
discharges waste into the Caspian instead of injecting it
underground, said Abdolreza Karbasi, the deputy head of Iran’s
 Department of Environment , according to the state-run agency.
The waste forms oily patches that foul Iran’s coast and kill
marine life, Karbasi said in the report today.  BP is the operator of the Azeri-Chirag-Gunashli oil field
and Shah Deniz natural gas field off Azerbaijan’s Caspian coast,
the company said in an e-mailed statement today. BP is a
“responsible operator in the Caspian” and has “rigorous”
health, safety and environmental procedures in place that are in
line with international standards, including environmental
impact assessments of all implemented projects, it said.  Iran’s state-run Press TV reported Jan. 27 that Karbasi,
the environmental official, noted frequent oil slicks from
 Azerbaijan  in recent years. The latest occurred four months ago
and required authorities to clean up some 25 metric tons of
crude oil from Iranian shores, the broadcaster said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
