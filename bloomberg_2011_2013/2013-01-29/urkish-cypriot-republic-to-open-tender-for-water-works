The breakaway Turkish Cypriot state
in northern Cyprus will soon open bids for the distribution of
water through a 480-kilometer (300-mile) network,  Turkey ’s
state-run Anatolia news agency said today, citing officials.  Turkey started construction three months ago on a pipeline
under the  Mediterranean Sea  to supply fresh water to northern
Cyprus. The 107-kilometer (67-mile) pipeline will run from
Alakopru dam near Anamur on the Mediterranean coast of Turkey to
a dam that will be built in Gecitkoy in northern Cyprus.  “God willing, we will be able to provide fresh drinking
water to our people with the help of Turkey in 2014,” Anatolia
quoted Ali Cetin Amcaoglu, agriculture and natural resources
minister of the self-declared Turkish Cypriot state, as saying.  When done, the Turkish pipeline could also supply water to
the southern Greek Cypriot side should the island be unified,
the Turkish government has said. The line is designed to carry
75 million cubic meters (19.8 billion gallons) of water a year.  The construction of part of the pipeline in Cyprus between
Guzelyurt and Gecitkoy has begun and authorities plan to open a
tender soon to upgrade the water distribution network in 2013 to
prevent piracy and losses, he said.  Amcaoglu said the laying of underwater pipelines will take
about three months, with the work starting when weather is
suitable, according to Anatolia. Cyprus has been divided between
the Republic of Cyprus and Turkish-held north since 1974.  To contact the reporter on this story:
