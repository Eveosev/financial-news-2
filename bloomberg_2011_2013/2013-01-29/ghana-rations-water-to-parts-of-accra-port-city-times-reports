Ghana  has resorted to rationing
water to parts of the capital Accra and biggest port of Tema for
six months after defects were found in filters at a water
treatment plant, the Ghanaian Times said, citing Ghana Urban
Water’s communications manager.  Stanley Martey told the newspaper that structural defects
were found in four of 12 filters at Weija’s treatment plant
that’s west of the capital, requiring filters to be redesigned
and reconstructed and affecting water supplies to Accra
residents and in Tema to the east.  To contact the reporter on this story:
