U.S. stocks were little changed
after a report showed confidence among consumers fell in
January.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index fell 0.1 percent to
1,499.42 at 10:04 a.m. in  New York . The equity benchmark has
gained 5.1 percent this month as lawmakers agreed on a budget
compromise and companies reported better-than-estimated
earnings.  The Conference Board’s index decreased to 58.6, the weakest
since November 2011, from a revised 66.7 in December, figures
from the New York-based private research group showed today. The
January reading was lower than the most pessimistic forecast in
a Bloomberg survey, which had a median estimate of 64.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
