International Paper Co (IP) , the world’s
largest manufacturer of cardboard shipping containers, plans to
ask the company’s board to raise the dividend later this year.  Chief Executive Officer John Faraci said he expects the
company will have sufficient cash flow to approve the higher
payout. He spoke today in a telephone interview after the
Memphis-based company reported its fourth-quarter earnings.  To contact the reporter on this story:
