Peabody Energy Corp. (BTU) , the largest
U.S. coal producer, forecast a first-quarter loss that is wider
than analysts estimated on expectations of higher costs at its
Australian operations.  The company will have a loss excluding one-time items of 4
cents to 26 cents, St. Louis-based Peabody said today in a
statement. Analysts projected a loss of 3 cents, the average of
16  estimates  compiled by Bloomberg.  “Targets reflect expectations of higher Australian costs
related to the timing of additional overburden removal and
startup costs associated with the transition to owner operator;
lower realized metallurgical coal pricing; and lower U.S. sales
and pricing,” Peabody said in the statement.  In the fourth quarter, the company had a  net loss  of $1.01
billion, or $3.78 a share, which compares with net income of 
$222.4 million, or 82 cents, a year earlier, Peabody said. Sales 
fell to $2.02 billion from $2.23 billion, beating the $1.91 
billion average of nine estimates.  Peabody ships metallurgical coal, used in steelmaking, to
Asian customers from its Australian mines. It also produces
thermal coal, burned by  utility companies  to generate
electricity at its Australian and U.S. mines.  (Peabody scheduled a conference call starting at 11 a.m.
 New York  time, accessible at +1-800-230-1074.)  To contact the reporter on this story:
