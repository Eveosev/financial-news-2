France ’s  Electricite de France SA 
and Iberdrola Renovables SA’s Greek unit, Rokas Renewables, are
the top producers in  Greece ’s wind energy market, which grew 7
percent in 2012, according to the Hellenic Wind Energy
Association.  Total installed capacity increased by 115.2 megawatts to
1,749.3 MW last year, compared with a 24 percent advance the
year earlier, according to a statement on the Athens-based
association’s website today. EDF produced 17 percent of that, or
298.8 megawatts, while Iberdrola accounted for 14 percent.  “The wind energy market is dynamic and has important
prospects,” the association said. “Political stability and a
stable investment environment are prerequisites” for growth in
the industry.  Prime Minister Antonis Samaras has said that taking steps
to attract investments is a key to the recovery of Greece’s
economy, which is expected to contract for a sixth year in 2013.
The economy is seen shrinking 4.2 percent this year, according
International Monetary Fund forecasts released on Jan. 18.  Terna Energy SA (TENERGY) ,  Enel Green Power SpA (EGPW)  and  Ellaktor SA (ELLAKTOR)  are
the other top-five producers in the Mediterranean country.
Investments in the industry stood at 150 million euros ($201.6
million) last year, with total renewable energy investment
reaching 2.5 billion euros, according to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
