AC Milan will buy Manchester City
striker  Mario Balotelli , a director of the Italian soccer club
said today on Twitter.  The 22-year-old will have a medical exam tomorrow and then
sign a contract through 2017, Milan’s Umberto Gandini said today
on his page on the social media site.  Balotelli has played 20 times for City this season, scoring
three goals. The Italian’s future with the Premier League
champion has been the subject of speculation following
controversies since his transfer from  Inter Milan  in August
2010.  Earlier this month, he had a dispute with manager  Roberto Mancini  at practice in which Mancini was photographed grabbing
and pushing the player before the two were separated. Other
incidents include his throwing a dart at a teammate, brawling
with City’s Micah Richards and collecting four red cards.  Balotelli has scored 20 times for City and provided the
pass which set up  Sergio Aguero ’s injury-time goal that won the
club’s first Premier League title on the final day of last
season.  He then went on to score three goals at the 2012 European
Championship, tying for the tournament lead, in helping Italy
reach the final.  The European transfer period ends at 11 p.m. U.K. time on
Jan. 31.  To contact the reporter on this story:
