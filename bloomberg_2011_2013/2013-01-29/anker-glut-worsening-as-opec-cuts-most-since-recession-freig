OPEC’s deepest output cut since the
global recession in 2008 is creating the biggest surplus of  oil
tankers  in the Persian Gulf in at least three years and lowering
earnings for Frontline Ltd. and other ship owners.  The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries reduced
daily supply by almost 1 million barrels in the four months
through December, equal to one fully loaded supertanker every
two days, data compiled by Bloomberg show. Saudi Arabia,  Iran 
and  Iraq  led the retreat, leaving 24 percent more ships than
cargoes in the world’s largest oil-producing region, the most
for the time of year since at least 2010, according to weekly
surveys of shipbrokers and owners by Bloomberg.  The group supplies 40 percent of the world’s oil. It had
raised supply by 4.8 million barrels a day since the first
quarter of 2009, diminishing a surplus of ships and lifting
rates above what owners need to break even. Output is now
falling as the U.S. meets the highest proportion of its own
needs in two decades. Tanker earnings slid 62 percent since
November and  shares (FRO)  of Frontline will drop 13 percent in a year,
the average of 14 analyst estimates shows.  “This cut in OPEC production highlights the slump in
tanker demand and absolutely caps potential growth in earnings
for owners,” said Erik Nikolai Stavseth, an analyst at Arctic
Securities ASA in Oslo whose recommendations on the shares of
shipping companies returned 18 percent in a year. “Owners
usually count on a busy start to the year, so 2013 is already
shaping up to be challenging.”  Crude Carriers  Daily rates for very large crude carriers dropped 53
percent to $14,090 this year, according to  Clarkson Plc (CKN) , the
world’s biggest shipbroker. Earnings will average $19,500 in
2013, according to the median of 10 analyst estimates. They were
forecasting $25,000 in October. Frontline, founded by
billionaire  John Fredriksen , says it needs $23,400 to break even
across its fleet of 33 VLCCs.  The Hamilton, Bermuda-based company will report a net loss
of $103 million for this year, widening from $87.4 million for
2012, according to the mean of 13 estimates. The analysts were
predicting a 2013 loss of $67.2 million three months ago, data
compiled by Bloomberg show. Shares of Frontline fell 34 percent
to 19.5 kroner in the past year and will drop to 16.88 kroner in
12 months, according to the forecasts.  Shipbuilding Surge  The number of  surplus tankers  in the Persian Gulf climbed 9
percentage points since the start of the year and is the highest
since September, according to Bloomberg’s weekly surveys of
shipbrokers and owners. The number of available cargoes hasn’t
exceeded shipping capacity since November 2010. The surplus is a
consequence of a surge in shipbuilding that began in 2007 and
2008, when rates rose as high as $229,000, Clarkson data show.  Strengthening demand in other regions may help ease the
glut of tankers once more.  China , the biggest destination for
laden VLCCs, imported 8 percent more crude in December, customs
data show. The nation ended seven straight quarters of slowing
economic growth in the final three months of 2012 and will keep
accelerating through at least the end of September, according to
the mean of estimates from 32 economists compiled by Bloomberg.  Global oil demand will advance 0.9 percent to a record 90.5
million barrels a day in 2013, the Paris-based International
Energy Agency estimates. World trade will increase 3.8 percent
this year, up from 2.8 percent in 2012, according to the
 International Monetary Fund , located in  Washington .  Record Scrapping  Fleet growth is slowing, with outstanding orders at ship
yards equal to 6.8 percent of existing capacity, from 13 percent
a year ago and 47 percent in 2008, according to  IHS Inc. (IHS) , an
Englewood, Colorado-based research company. Owners will scrap
VLCCs with capacity of 2.6 million deadweight tons in 2013,
about the same as last year, Clarkson estimates.  The excess supply extends across most of the shipping
industry after owners ordered too many vessels when rates surged
before the global recession, the worst since World War II. The
Baltic Dry Index, a measure of the cost of hauling coal and iron
ore, plunged 60 percent last year and the Baltic Dirty Tanker
Index, reflecting oil-shipping rates, retreated 18 percent.  VLCCs were earning 50 percent more a year ago because of a
surge in demand from countries seeking to stockpile crude as the
27-nation European Union prepared to impose sanctions on Iran
over its nuclear program. Rates rose as high as $51,413 in
April, and the oversupply of tankers in the  Persian Gulf  fell as
low as 4.5 percent.  Losing Money  Charter rates for VLCCs plying the benchmark Saudi Arabia-
to-Japan voyage were unchanged today at 30.44 industry-standard
Worldscale points, or 30.44 percent of the nominal Worldscale
rate for that voyage, figures from the London-based Baltic
Exchange showed. The ships are losing $6,409 a day on the route,
against daily earnings of $16,509 at the start of the year.  Saudi Arabia, the largest crude exporter, boosted output to
a record 9.9 million barrels a day in May to compensate for
slumping Iranian shipments.  Brent crude ,  Europe ’s benchmark, had
closed as high as $126.22 a barrel in March, 44 percent more
than the five-year average. Prices fell as low as $104.76 by
November and  Saudi Arabia ’s production was pared back to the
lowest level in more than a year the following month.  The decline is compounding weaker demand from the U.S., the
largest importer, where domestic oil output is the highest since
1993 and natural-gas production the most ever, Energy Department
data show. Imports averaged 8.65 million barrels a day last
year, the smallest since 1999.  LNG Vessels  Mitsui O.S.K. Lines Ltd. is the largest owner of VLCCs,
with 38, according to Clarkson. The Tokyo-based company, which
also operates ships carrying liquefied natural gas and dry-bulk
commodities, will lose $262 million in its fiscal year ending in
March, the mean of 13  analyst estimates  shows.  Frontline, once the biggest VLCC operator, split in two in
December 2011 to avoid running out of cash amid the lowest rates
since 1999. The new Frontline 2012 Ltd. is investing in ships
carrying oil, liquefied petroleum gas and  iron ore .  “A cut in OPEC production normally spells fewer cargoes
and lower tanker earnings,” said Dag Kilen, an analyst at
Fearnley Consultants A/S, part of  Norway ’s second-largest
shipbroker. “Fewer cargoes with the market already oversupplied
with tankers will push rates down.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
