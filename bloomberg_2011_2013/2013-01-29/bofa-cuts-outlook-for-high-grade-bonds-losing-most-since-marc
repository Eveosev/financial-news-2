Bank of America Corp. cut its
outlook for returns on investment-grade bonds in the U.S. this
year as the debt loses the most since March.  “We now consider it most likely that total returns will
fall short of our low 1.6 percent target,” wrote New York-based
credit strategist Hans Mikkelsen in a Jan. 28 report. “The risk
of the rotation out of bonds, into equities starting in 2013,
has increased enough to become our base case.”  Investment-grade bonds are losing 0.6 percent in January
after gaining 55.6 percent in the four years after 2008 as the
 Federal Reserve ’s policy of holding benchmark  interest rates  at
record lows pushes investors into riskier assets. The notes have
declined 0.7 percent since October, even as speculative-grade
bonds gain 4.4 percent and the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index has
returned 6.9 percent with dividends reinvested.  “A disorderly rotation out of bonds, into equities --
where interest rates increase significantly, leading to massive
outflows from high grade bond funds and much wider credit
spreads -- is the biggest risk to investment grade this year and
the one we are getting increasingly concerned about,” Mikkelsen
wrote.  To contact the reporter on this story:
