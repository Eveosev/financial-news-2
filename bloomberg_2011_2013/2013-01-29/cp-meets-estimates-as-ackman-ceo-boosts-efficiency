Canadian Pacific  Railway Ltd. posted
fourth-quarter earnings that matched analysts’ estimates as the
chief executive officer backed by investor  William Ackman 
targets profitability goals set during a proxy fight.  Excluding some items, profit was C$1.28 a share, in line
with the average of 28 estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Profit
on that basis in the same period a year ago was C$1.11. Revenue
rose 6.7 percent to C$1.5 billion ($1.49 billion), Calgary-based
Canadian Pacific said today in a statement.  Chief Executive Officer  Hunter Harrison  is working to rid
Canadian Pacific of its status as  North America ’s least
efficient railroad, based on operating ratio. Harrison, a former
CEO of rival Canadian National Railway Ltd., took over June 29
after Ackman, a hedge-fund manager and activist investor, won
his proxy campaign to remove then-CEO  Fred Green .  “We continue to expect material improvement in efficiency,
productivity and earnings, but the share price move has gone
beyond that,”  Walter Spracklin , an analyst at  RBC Capital
Markets  in Toronto, said yesterday in a telephone interview.  On an adjusted basis, the operating ratio, an industry
benchmark that compares expenses to sales, improved to 74.8
percent from 78.5 percent a year earlier, Canadian Pacific said.  Revenue Forecast  Canadian Pacific predicted a revenue increase “in the high
single digits” this year. Operating ratio will probably be “in
the low 70s,” while diluted per-share earnings climb by more
than 40 percent. That implies a forecast of C$6.08 a share,
based on 2012 results, topping analysts’ estimates of C$5.78 a
share.  “This was driven entirely by a material reduction in the
company’s pension-expense assumptions,” Spracklin said in a
note to clients today. “We are at this point uncertain as to
how much value the market will ascribe to the change in pension
expense assumptions -- which we note are set at the discretion
of management.”  Canadian Pacific rose 3.1 percent to an all-time closing
high of C$116.22 in Toronto. The stock has gained 15 percent
this year, outpacing an advance of 3.2 percent by  Canada ’s
benchmark  Standard & Poor’s/TSX Composite Index. (SPTSX)   Forecasts for 2013 assume that fuel will cost $3.45 a
gallon, on average, the company said. Canadian Pacific expects
to pay a tax rate of 25 percent to 27 percent.  Pension expenses will probably be C$50 million to C$60
million this year and next, before rising to C$90 million to
C$110 million in 2015 and 2016, Canadian Pacific said.  Including C$39 million in workforce-reduction expenses,
C$111 million to write down investments such as the Powder River
Basin coal reserve’s rail network and other items, net income
fell 93 percent to C$15 million, or 8 cents a share, from C$221
million, or C$1.30, a year earlier. The operating ratio on that
basis was 96 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
