China ’s benchmark money-market rate
rose to a three-week high on speculation banks will hoard cash
to meet demand before the Lunar New Year holiday next month.  The People’s Bank of China sold 80 billion  yuan  ($12.9
billion) of seven-day reverse-repurchase contracts today,
according to a trader required to bid at the auctions. The yield
was kept at 3.35 percent, unchanged from the previous sale, the
trader said. China’s financial markets will be shut from Feb.
11-15 for the weeklong holiday.  “Liquidity will be a bit tight before holiday,” said Wang
Huane, a senior bond trader at Qilu Bank Co. in Jinan, the
capital of Shandong province. “The reverse-repo operations will
help prevent money-market rates from rising too high.”  The seven-day  repurchase rate , which measures interbank
funding availability, gained 16 basis points to 3.14 percent as
of 10:06 a.m. in  Shanghai , according to a weighted average
compiled by the National Interbank Funding Center. It touched
3.16 percent earlier, the highest level since Jan. 8.  The one-year interest-rate swap contract, the fixed cost
needed to receive the floating seven-day repurchase rate, rose
one basis point to 3.19 percent, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
