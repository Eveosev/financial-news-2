Chancellor of the Exchequer  George Osborne  said the U.K. received the first payment under a 5
billion-pound ($7.9 billion) agreement with  Switzerland  to
recoup tax owed to the British Treasury.  Switzerland paid the U.K. tax agency, Her Majesty’s Revenue
& Customs, 340 million pounds from individuals escaping the
British tax system by hiding money in Swiss bank accounts. The
agreement, signed between both countries in October 2011, came
into force on Jan. 1.  “I can confirm last night that HMRC received 340 million
pounds from the Swiss government, the first installment of the
deal we have struck and the first time in our history that money
due in taxes has flowed from Switzerland to the U.K. instead of
the other way round,” Osborne told the House of Commons in
 London  today.  Osborne is seeking to placate lawmakers and voters by
preventing rich individuals and large corporations from
minimizing tax bills as he drives through the biggest budget
cuts since World War II to narrow the nation’s fiscal deficit.
The U.K. will put  tax avoidance  at the top of the agenda of the
Group of Eight under its chairmanship of the organization this
year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
