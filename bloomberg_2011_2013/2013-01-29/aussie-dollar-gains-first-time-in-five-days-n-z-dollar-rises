Australia ’s dollar gained versus
against its U.S. counterpart for the first time in five days as
investor risk appetite swelled and commodities and stocks rose.  The Aussie strengthened against the majority of its 16
most-traded peers as the nation’s business confidence rebounded
in December by the most in more than a decade.  New Zealand ’s
dollar, nicknamed the kiwi, advanced versus the greenback as the
nation’s annual trade deficit unexpectedly narrowed.  Australia’s dollar gained 0.6 percent to $1.0475 in  New
York  trading yesterday and rose 0.4 percent to 95.01 yen.  The  New Zealand dollar  advanced 0.7 percent to 83.95 U.S.
cents. The kiwi was up 0.5 percent to 76.15 yen.  Standard & Poor’s GSCI Index of 24 raw materials gained as
much as 0.9 percent, the largest intraday jump since Jan. 17.
The  S&P 500 Index  advanced 0.5 percent.  National Australia Bank’s Ltd.’s  confidence index , based on
a survey of more than 500 companies, rose to a reading of 3 last
month from negative 9 the previous month, according to a report
released yesterday. The increase is the biggest improvement in
sentiment since October 2001. The business conditions gauge, a
measure of hiring, sales and profits, improved to negative 4
from a revised negative 6.  In New Zealand, imports exceeded exports by NZ$1.21 billion
($1 billion) in 2012, compared with a revised NZ$1.39 billion
shortfall in the year through November, the statistics office in
Wellington said yesterday. Economists in a Bloomberg News survey
forecast a gap of NZ$1.87 billion. Home-building approvals rose
9.4 percent in December, more than forecast, data showed.  The Australian dollar rose 0.8 percent over the past month
among the 10 developed-nation currencies monitored by the
Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes. The kiwi gained 2.2
percent. The  U.S. dollar  fell 0.3 percent, and the yen tumbled
6.2 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
