Suncorp Group Ltd. (SUN)  fell the most in
five months in Sydney trading on concerns claims from floods
caused by ex-tropical cyclone Oswald that lashed Queensland and
New South Wales states would reduce earnings.  Suncorp, which gets more than a quarter of its premiums
from Queensland, fell as much as 4.9 percent and was down 2.2
percent at 11:40 a.m. in Sydney.  Insurance Australia Group Ltd. (IAG) 
dropped 1.5 percent and  QBE Insurance Group Ltd. (QBE)  slid 2.3
percent.  Floods have forced the  Insurance Council  of Australia,
whose members sell more than 90 percent of the country’s
premiums, to declare a catastrophe for parts of Queensland,
where waters upturned cars and flooded streets. About 5,050
claims have been made so far with estimated insurance losses of
A$43 million ($44.9 million), it said on Jan. 27.  Suncorp has received 4,500 claims from storms and flooding
associated with the cyclone, the Brisbane-based company said in
a statement today. Spokesmen for IAG and QBE didn’t immediately
reply to messages seeking comment.  Queensland and NSW, which account for about half the
nation’s economy, experienced about A$9 billion in lost output
when they were hit by flooding and Cyclone Yasi in 2011.  To contact the reporter on this story:
