Russian economic growth slowed to a
new low since the country climbed out of a downturn in 2010,
Deputy Economy Minister  Andrei Klepach  said, warning that
investment is the “Achilles heel” of the economy.  Gross domestic product expanded 2.2 percent in the fourth
quarter from a year earlier, Klepach said, citing preliminary
data, down from 2.9 percent in the third quarter and 4 percent
three months earlier. GDP is forecast to grow about 3.5 percent
over the full-year, he said.  “Our growth potential is higher and we could increase it,
including through investment,” Klepach told journalists in
Moscow today. “Investment remains the Achilles heel of our
economy.”  Russian  investment  unexpectedly contracted in December from
a year earlier, dropping for the second time in four months, as
the dimming economic outlook prompted businesses to cut back
spending.  Less spending is compounding the effects of weak external
demand in choking the economy of the world’s largest energy
exporter. Real wages grew at the slowest pace in more than three
years, suggesting the  consumer spending  that accounts for about
half of Russian gross domestic output may be stumbling.  To contact the reporter on this story:
