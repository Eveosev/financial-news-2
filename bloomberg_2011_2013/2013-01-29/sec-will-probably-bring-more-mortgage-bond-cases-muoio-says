The U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission is likely to continue filing cases tied to
residential-mortgage-backed securities, said Reid Muoio, deputy
head of its structured and new products unit.  The agency has so far filed approximately 80 enforcement
actions involving “wrongdoing generally associated with the
financial crisis,” Muoio said today at the American
Securitization Forum’s annual conference in Las Vegas. That
included settlements last year with Credit Suisse Group AG and
JPMorgan Chase & Co. over RMBS, he said.  “There’s probably almost certainly more to come in that
space,” he said.  The agency yesterday filed a lawsuit against former
Jefferies & Co. mortgage-bond trader Jesse Litvak in federal
court in  Connecticut , accusing him of defrauding investors in
more than 25 trades from 2009 to 2011. Litvak, who also faces
criminal charges, denies wrongdoing, according to a statement
from Patrick J. Smith, an attorney with DLA Piper in New York
who is representing him.  The alleged lying to clients used by Litvak in his trading
is probably “fairly commonplace, fairly widespread,” Muoio
said. “I’ve been told that today by actually a number of
different industry participants.” He said that he couldn’t
comment on whether his agency would pursue similar cases.  The SEC is “looking to wrap up our financial crisis-
related enforcement efforts this calendar year,” Muoio said  To contact the reporter on this story:
