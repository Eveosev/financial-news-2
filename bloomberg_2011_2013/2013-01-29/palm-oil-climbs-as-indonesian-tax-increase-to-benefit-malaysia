Palm oil  gained on speculation that
exports from  Malaysia  may increase after Indonesia, the world’s
largest-producer, raised taxes on February shipments.  The contract for delivery in April advanced as much as 1.1
percent to 2,471 ringgit ($803) a metric ton on the Malaysia
Derivatives Exchange, and ended the morning session at 2,464
ringgit. Futures are heading for a 1.1 percent gain this month.
Financial markets in Malaysia were closed yesterday.  Indonesia will  raise  taxes on crude palm oil exports to 9
percent from 7.5 percent in January, the Trade Ministry said
yesterday, potentially curbing shipments as rival Malaysia
maintains a zero-tariff policy for a second month. The base
price to calculate the levy will be increased to $744 a ton from
$709, it said. This is the first increase in taxes since May,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The Indonesian tax increase is “in favor of the Malaysian
producers,” said Ryan Long, vice president of futures and
options at OSK Investment Bank Bhd. in  Kuala Lumpur . “We can
expect higher exports in the month of February. They have lost
their competitiveness.”  Record  inventories  of 2.63 million tons at the end of
December in Malaysia may drop with a recovery in exports and
decline in output, Long said.  Refined palm oil for delivery in September declined 0.4
percent to 7,002  yuan  ($1,124) a ton on the  Dalian Commodity
Exchange .  Soybean oil  for delivery in the same month retreated
0.7 percent to 8,688 yuan a ton.  Soybeans for March delivery dropped 0.2 percent to $14.4475
a bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade. Soybean oil for March
delivery was little changed at 51.91 cents a pound.  To contact the reporter on this story:
