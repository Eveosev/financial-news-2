Treasuries fell for a fourth day as
the U.S. sold $35 billion of five-year notes at the highest
yield since March amid concern the  Federal Reserve  may provide
guidance tomorrow on when it will slow bond purchases.  Benchmark 10-year notes yielded 2 percent for a second day,
the highest level since April, amid better-than-forecast
economic data. The five-year notes drew a yield of 0.889
percent, versus an average forecast of 0.887 percent in a
Bloomberg News survey of seven of the Fed’s primary dealers.
Investors increased bets to the highest level since 2011 that
the price of Treasuries will drop, a JPMorgan Chase & Co.
surveyed showed. Trading in options that profit if Treasury
yields rise surged yesterday to the highest since 2007.  “There’s a shift in sentiment on where the next level is
in the marketplace,” said  Scott Graham , head of government bond
trading at  Bank of Montreal (BMO) ’s BMO Capital Markets unit in
 Chicago , one of the 21 primary dealers required to bid at U.S.
debt auctions. “This 2 percent level will be a meaningful buy
level for accounts.”  The 10-year  note  yield rose four basis points, or 0.04
percentage point, to 2 percent at 5 p.m. in New York, according
to Bloomberg Bond Trader prices. The price of the 1.625 percent
security due in November 2022 fell 10/32, or $3.13 per $1,000
face value, to 96 21/32. The yield climbed to 2.004 percent
yesterday, the highest since April 18.  The current  five-year note  rose 2 basis points to 0.88
percent.  Foreign Bid  Trading in options that profit if yields rise surged
yesterday to the most in more than five years. About 73.9
percent of the volume in options on all Treasury note futures
was in puts, the highest level since June 8, 2007, according to
data from CME Group Inc., the world’s largest futures exchange.
Puts gain in value if the underlying futures price falls.  At today’s five-year note sale, the bid-to-cover  ratio ,
which gauges demand by comparing total bids with the amount of
notes offered, was 2.88 at today’s auction, versus 2.72 last
month and an average of 2.86 at the past 10 sales.  “The big selloff brought only modest buying to the most
important auction of the week -- the street had been optimistic,
but that optimism was misplaced,”  Jim Vogel , an interest-rate
strategist at FTN Financial, said in a telephone interview from
 Memphis ,  Tennessee . “To bring in size-buying at risk requires
some cheaper yields, at least until the Fed speaks tomorrow.”  Indirect bidders , an investor class that includes foreign
central banks, purchased 39.7 percent of the notes, compared
with an average of 41.2 percent at the past 10 sales. They
bought 32.4 percent of the notes at the December auction.  Market Losses  Direct bidders , non-primary dealer investors that place
their bids directly with the Treasury, purchased 16.8 percent of
the notes, after buying 30.4 percent of the notes in December,
the highest since Sept. 2004. That compares with the 10-auction
average of 12.7 percent.  U.S. five-year Treasury notes have fallen 0.77 percent this
year, compared with 0.95 percent loss for the broader Treasury
market, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch.  The U.S. sold $35 billion of two-year notes yesterday and
will auction $29 billion of seven-year securities tomorrow.  Central-bank policy makers said at their last meeting they
may end purchases of  government securities  sometime in 2013,
with members divided between a mid- or end-of-year finish,
according to the minutes of the  Federal Open Market Committee ’s
Dec. 11-12 gathering.  Short Bets  “Bernanke may clarify that they are committed to QE --that
sets the stage for stability and a move lower in rates,” said
Rajiv Setia, head of U.S. rates research in New York at Barclays
Plc. “The selloff is an attractive buying opportunity. Our
target for year-end is 1.60 percent. We think this is a good
opportunity to buy the dip.”  Investors  raised bets  to the highest level since July 5,
2011, that the price of the securities will drop, according to
JPMorgan.  The percentage of shorts in the firm’s “all clients”
survey rose to 25 percent in the week ending yesterday, up from
19 percent the previous week. Longs, or bets Treasuries will
rise, increased to 13 percent from 7 percent the previous week.  The proportion of net shorts remained steady at 12
percentage points, according to JPMorgan. About 62 percent of
the clients surveyed were neutral, down from 74 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
