Morgan Stanley (MS) ’s Tokyo-based credit
strategist Takashi Miura will leave the bank, according to two
people familiar with the matter.  Miura, an executive director who covers  Japan ’s credit
markets including corporate bonds and credit-default swaps at
Morgan Stanley MUFG Securities Co., resigned earlier this month
and will leave the firm later this year, said the people who
asked not to be identified as the details are private.  The growth of Japan’s corporate bond market has stalled as
the economy shrank in the second and third quarters of last
year. Morgan Stanley ranked Japan credit as “the least
attractive global credit market” in a note to clients last
month. The report, titled “2013 Credit Outlook,” pointed out
tight spreads, mixed balance sheet quality and a forecast for a
“meaningful” rise in the government bond yields.  Miura, who joined the bank in May from Goldman Sachs Group
Inc., wasn’t available to comment when Bloomberg News called him
at his office. Mika Watanabe, a Tokyo-based spokeswoman at
Morgan Stanley, declined to comment.  To contact the reporters on this story:
