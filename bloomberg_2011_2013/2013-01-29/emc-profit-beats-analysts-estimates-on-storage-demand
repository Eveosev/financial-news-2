EMC Corp. (EMC) , the world’s biggest maker
of storage computers, fell the most in more than six months
after forecasting full-year profit that trailed analysts’
estimates and as  VMware Inc. (VMW) , the software maker it mostly owns,
said it’s facing a tough first half of the year.  EMC declined 4 percent to $24.18 at the close in New York,
for the biggest one-day drop since July 6. The stock gained 17
percent last year, while the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index
advanced more than 13 percent. VMware tumbled 22 percent to
$77.14, for the steepest single-session decline since July 2008.  VMware yesterday projected sales that missed estimates amid
cutbacks from corporate customers and said it will cut 900 jobs,
exit some business lines and consolidate facilities. EMC today
forecast 2013 earnings of $1.85 a share excluding certain
restructuring charges and the amortization of VMware’s software
from prior periods. Analysts had estimated $1.90.  The shares are down because of “poor guidance provided by
their wayward child VMware,” Brian Freed, an analyst at
Wunderlich Securities Inc., said via e-mail. He cut his rating
on VMware to hold from buy today.  VMware is the biggest maker of software that lets computers
run multiple operating systems.  Sales will be $23.5 billion for 2013, EMC said in a
statement. That compared to an average analyst estimate of
$23.63 billion.  ‘VMware as of yesterday still represents 60 percent of
EMC’s value,’’ said Jeffrey Fidacaro, an analyst at Monness
Crespi Hardt & Co.  EMC’s fourth-quarter net income rose 4.6 percent to $869.9
million, or 39 cents a share, from $832 million, or 38 cents, a
year earlier, the Hopkinton, Massachusetts-based company said.
Excluding some costs, profit was 54 cents, beating the 52-cent
average of analysts’  estimates  compiled by Bloomberg. Sales rose
8.2 percent to $6.03 billion, compared with the $5.98 billion
projection.  To contact the reporter on this story:
