Russia  revised its crude export
program for February from Novorossiysk to include four shipments
from this month after storms and a pipeline leak disrupted
operations at the Black Sea port.  Novorossiysk will ship 3.222 million metric tons of crude
in February, or 843,000 barrels a day, according to a final
loading program obtained by Bloomberg. That includes 450,000
tons previously scheduled for this month.  Shipments from the port were delayed this month by a week
of bad weather and a leak from a OAO Transneft pipeline last
weekend. Flows were restored today, Igor Dyomin, a spokesman for
Transneft, said by phone. Novorossiysk will handle three 80,000
ton cargoes of Siberian Light crude and 27 lots of Urals blend,
according to the final plan.  Daily crude shipments from Russia’s Baltic Sea ports will
fall 8.3 percent in February as planned pipeline maintenance
reduces flows to Primorsk. The repairs will take place in mid-
February, Dyomin said yesterday.  A total of 4.3 million tons, or 1.13 million barrels a day,
of Urals will be shipped from the port of Primorsk, according to
the schedule, with no shipments planned from Feb. 13 to Feb. 16.
That compares with 1.28 million barrels a day in January.  Ust-Luga will export 15 Urals lots of 100,000 tons each, or
393,000 barrels a day, up 3.8 percent from planned daily
shipments this month. That is two 100,000 ton shipments more
than in a preliminary plan obtained Jan. 25.  Loading programs are monthly schedules of crude shipments
compiled by field operators to allow buyers and sellers to plan
their supply and trading activities.  To contact the reporter on this story:
