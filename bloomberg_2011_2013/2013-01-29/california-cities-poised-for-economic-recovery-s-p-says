Most  California  cities will be
recovering this year from the lingering effects of the longest
recession since World War II and those with revenue gains will
probably see credit quality improve, Standard & Poor’s said.  Cities in the largest U.S. state by population hit a low
point in the municipal economic cycle last year, the New York-
based rating company said. Of 202 cities that S&P rates, 22 were
downgraded, including four to speculative grade from investment
grade.  Communities in California have struggled to stay afloat by
cutting staff and services to make up for a drop in sales levies
and property tax revenue in the wake of the 18-month recession
that ended in 2009. Stockton, San Bernardino and Mammoth Lakes
filed for bankruptcy protection.  “Despite the trio of bankruptcy protection filings in the
state last year, most California cities absorbed the impact of
the Great Recession and preserved their credit quality,” S&P
said in a report today. “The small number of municipal
bankruptcies is a testimony to the resilience of local
governments and their ability and willingness to scale back
expenditures and align them with lower revenues.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
