Loomis AB (LOOMB) , the cash-handling unit
spun off from  Securitas AB (SECUB) , dropped the most in almost 12 weeks
in  Stockholm  trading after SEB AB downgraded the shares and said
Loomis probably saw falling volumes in the fourth quarter.  Loomis  fell  as much as 3.2 percent, its steepest intraday
drop since Nov. 9, and declined 3 percent to 105.25 kronor as of
11:19 a.m. in Stockholm. Trading volume was at 36 percent of the
daily average in the past three months.  The company’s “strong price performance over the past
three months has reduced the upside,” Stefan Andersson, a
Stockholm-based analyst at SEB, said in a note to clients today,
adding he was downgrading the rating on the stock to hold from
buy. Sales from Loomis’s existing operations probably declined
in the fourth quarter because of a lost contract in France and
difficult market conditions in Spain, he said.  Loomis is expected to report fourth-quarter net income of
196 million kronor ($30.6 million) when it reports earnings on
Feb. 6.  “For 2013 we see prospects of growth again, driven by
Loomis gaining a significant contract in France, gaining some
market share in Sweden, and from annual price increases at the
start of the year,” Andersson said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
