Posco,  Asia ’s third-biggest
steelmaker by output, forecast sales may fall this year after
reporting worse-than-estimated fourth-quarter profit as waning
orders from carmakers and shipbuilders lowered prices.  Sales on a parent basis may slip to 32 trillion won ($29
billion) in 2013 from 35.7 trillion won in 2012, the Pohang,
South Korea-based company said in a regulatory filing today. Net
income was 513 billion won in the three months ended Dec. 31,
compared with 767 billion won a year earlier, missing the 592.6
billion won average of 18 analyst  estimates  compiled by
Bloomberg.  China ’s economic slowdown and  Europe ’s fiscal crisis have
reduced demand for steel used in houses, cars and ships,
squeezing profits at global steelmakers.  Posco (005490)  today said an
“unprecedented slump” in the worldwide steel market cut prices
and hurt profits last year. The company also forecast its crude
steel output may decline this year.  “Steel companies including Posco will have to accept the
new normal -- lower demand, lower price and narrower margin,”
said Kim Hag Ju, chief investment officer at Woori Asset
Management Co., which oversees $19 billion in assets. “We won’t
see the steel boom era that we’ve watched in the past decade
spurred by China’s growth.”  Posco fell 0.1 percent to 355,500 won at the close in Seoul
today, while the local benchmark  Kospi index  gained 0.8 percent.
The stock has climbed 1.9 percent this year, compared with a 2.1
percent drop in  Kospi. (KOSPI)  The earnings announcement came after the
stock market closed.  ’Severe Competition’  “We expect global competition to be the most severe this
year,” Posco Chairman Chung Joon Yang told investors today.
“While people expect a gradual recovery in the global economy,
uncertainties are still there. We will try to turn this crisis
into an opportunity by securing profitability as well as
growth.”  Global steel demand may grow 3 percent this year, with
consumption in China, the world’s top consumer and producer of
steel, gaining at the same pace, according to a company
presentation at a press conference today. Demand in  Korea , where
it sold more than half its products last year, may remain
largely unchanged.  Prices Posco charged for steel fell by 103,000 won per
metric ton to 883,000 won in 2012, compared with the previous
period. Operating margin slipped to 7.8 percent last year from
11 percent in 2011 and 15 percent in 2010, it said in the
presentation.  Better Future  Full-year net income fell 22 percent to 2.5 trillion won,
missing the 2.54 trillion won average of of 20 analyst estimates
compiled by Bloomberg. Operating profit fell 36 percent to 2.79
trillion won.  Chung was optimistic of future performance saying first-
quarter earnings may improve from the preceding period on lower
raw-material costs.  Posco forecasts spot  iron ore  prices will average $135 a
ton this year and hard coking coal prices $185 a ton.  The Korean company forecast 2013 crude  steel output  at 37
million tons, compared with 37.99 million tons last year. Sales
may fall to 34 million tons this year from 35 million tons last
year, it said in the presentation.  Posco’s capital expenditure for this year will increase to
4 trillion won from 3.6 trillion won last year because of
capacity expansions. The spending plan won’t affect its
finances, said Chief Financial Officer Park Ki Hong.  To contact the reporter on this story:
