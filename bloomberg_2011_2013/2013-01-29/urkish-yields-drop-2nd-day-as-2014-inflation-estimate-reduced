Turkey ’s benchmark lira bond yields
fell for a second day after the central bank cut its inflation
forecast for next year.  Yields on benchmark two-year notes fell for a second day,
down three basis points, or 0.03 percentage point, to 5.82
percent at the 5 p.m. close in Istanbul. The lira appreciated
0.1 percent against the dollar to 1.7705, recovering from its
lowest level in almost three weeks yesterday.  Turkey’s inflation will stabilize at 5 percent in the
medium-term, central bank Governor Erdem Basci said at a news
conference in Ankara while releasing the bank’s inflation report
today. He reduced the 2014 inflation estimate to 4.9 percent
from an earlier estimate of 5 percent and maintained this year’s
forecast at 5.3 percent. The central bank will not stay
“indifferent” to currency volatility and faster-than-planned
loan growth that may endanger inflation targets, Basci said.  Basci “sounded more confident on inflation target,”
Bulent Topbas, a fund manager at Strateji Menkul Degerler AS in
Istanbul, said in e-mailed comments. “Inflation target can be
met as the lira is on an appreciation trend.”  The  inflation  rate in 2012 fell to a 15-month low of 6.2
percent in December, compared with 11.1 percent in April, its
highest level since October 2008, as the nation received its
first investment-grade ranking in 18 years. The Ankara-based
bank lowered its overnight lending and borrowing rates by 25
basis points each on Jan. 22.  “The prevailing expectation in the bond market is that
short-term rates will come down as the central bank cut rates
and the cost of funding declines,” Arinc Yurtkuran, a fixed-
income trader at ING Bank AS in Istanbul, said in e-mailed
comments.  The central bank reduced the  average cost of funding  for
lenders to 5.63 percent yesterday from 10.83 percent on May 25
as economic growth fell to 1.6 percent in the third quarter, the
lowest economic expansion since 2009.  To contact the reporter on this story:
