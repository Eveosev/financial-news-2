Wheat rose for a third straight
session as the worst U.S. drought since the 1930s eroded  crop
conditions  in  Kansas , the biggest producer of winter varieties.  Fields in Kansas were rated 20 percent good or excellent as
of Jan. 27, down from 24 percent on Dec. 30, according to a U.S.
Department of Agriculture report yesterday. Parts of the state
have received  little rain  in the past 90 days, National Weather
Service data show. Crops “will deteriorate further” when they
emerge from winter dormancy, forecaster Telvent DTN said today.  “The rains are all too far east to help” and prices will
rise, Darrell Holaday, the president of Advanced Market Concepts
in Wamego, Kansas, said by telephone. “It’s tough out here.
It’s as dry as I ever remember it being for this long.”  Wheat futures for March delivery gained 0.5 percent to
$7.835 a bushel at 10:43 a.m. on the Chicago Board of Trade. The
price has jumped 21 percent in the past year, partly as the
drought in the U.S., the world’s biggest exporter of the grain,
threatened crops.  In the U.S., wheat is the fourth-largest crop, valued at
$14.4 billion in 2011, behind corn, soybeans and hay, government
data show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
