President  Francois Hollande ’s
popularity improved for the first time since he took office
after he sent French troops to Mali to battle Islamist rebels.  Hollande’s approval rating gained 4 points to 44 percent, a
 BVA poll  for L’Express magazine and France Inter radio showed.  Plagued by rising joblessness and a stalled economy,
Hollande’s popularity has plummeted since he took office last
May, reaching a low of 40 percent in December, according to the
BVA series. The Mali deployment, which came the same week that
Hollande won an agreement with unions to increase worker
flexibility, has helped the Socialist president counter
perceptions that he is indecisive and lacked authority.  This foreign-policy move “has helped Hollande address his
personality weaknesses, his decisiveness and his authority,”
Celine Bracq, a BVA pollster, said in a webcast on BVA’s
website. “The intervention in  Mali  is strongly supported by a
majority of French. That’s broadening his basis of support.”  Even so, within his own Socialist base, Hollande’s actions
have come under fire, Bracq said. Fifty-seven percent of those
surveyed said the president’s policies are unjust and 72 percent
said they are ineffective.  “He needs to strengthen himself with the left, where he’s
increasingly fragile,” Bracq said. His own supporters
“consider him not sufficiently socialist.”  BVA interviewed 1,136 voters by Internet on Jan. 24 and
Jan. 25. The poll has a margin of error of 2.5 percentage
points.  To contact the reporter on this story:
