Total SA failed to buy  North Sea 
Forties crude for a fifth session even after raising its bid by
10 cents. Gunvor Group Ltd. bid unsuccessfully for Russian Urals
grade for a second day.  Russia plans to increase crude exports in February from
Novorossiysk after four cargoes scheduled for this month were
delayed because of storms and a pipeline leak that disrupted
operations at the Black Sea port.  North Sea  Total sought to buy Forties at 75 cents a barrel more than
Dated Brent for loading Feb. 9 to Feb. 11, a Bloomberg survey of
traders and brokers monitoring the Platts pricing window showed.
That’s 10 cents more than yesterday’s bid and is the highest
since Jan. 24. Total bought cargoes on Jan. 22 at premiums of 35
cents and 40 cents.  The Paris-based company also sought the grade for loading
from Feb. 17 to Feb. 23 at 55 cents more than the benchmark, the
survey showed. Chevron Corp. was also unsuccessful with its bid
at a 55 cent premium for Feb. 19 to Feb. 23 loading crude.  Reported crude trading typically occurs during the Platts
window, which ends at 4:30 p.m.  London  time. Forties loading in
10 to 25 days fell 9 cents to 63 cents a barrel more than Dated
Brent, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Brent for March settlement traded at $114.28 a barrel on
the ICE Futures Europe exchange in London at the close of the
window, compared with $113.14 in the previous session. The April
contract was at $113.21, a discount of $1.07 to March.  The Buzzard oilfield’s share of Forties fell to 43 percent
in the week to Jan. 27, from 46 percent in the previous week,
according to data published on BP Plc’s website.  Mediterranean/Urals  Gunvor Group Ltd. bid unsuccessfully for 100,000 metric
tons of Urals at a 90 cent discount to Dated Brent on a
delivered basis to Rotterdam, 5 cents more than yesterday and
the same level as a Jan. 25 trade, the Platts survey showed.  There were no bids or offers in the Mediterranean for a
second session, according to the survey.  The Urals differential to Dated Brent in the Mediterranean
narrowed by 8 cents a barrel to minus 28 cents, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. In northwest  Europe , the  discount 
shrank to 86 cents from 94 cents yesterday, the data showed.  Novorossiysk will ship 3.222 million tons of crude in
February, or 843,000 barrels a day, according to a final loading
program obtained by Bloomberg. That includes 450,000 tons
previously scheduled for this month.  Daily crude shipments from Baltic Sea ports will fall 8.3
percent due to planned pipeline maintenance at Primorsk, which
will be 4.3 million tons. Ust-Luga will export 15 Urals lots of
100,000 tons each, or 393,000 barrels a day, up 3.8 percent from
planned daily shipments this month.  OAO Surgutneftegas issued a tender to sell two 100,000-ton
cargoes of Urals for loading next month from Ust-Luga, according
to three traders who participate in the market.  The company is offering the shipments for Feb. 13 and Feb.
14 and from Feb. 15 to Feb. 16, the people said, asking not to
be identified as the information is confidential. The tender
closes tomorrow, they said.  PKN Orlen is seeking to buy 100,000 tons of Urals crude via
an informal closed tender, according to two people with
knowledge of the matter.  Orlen plans to buy the blend from either Ust-Luga or
Primorsk ports for loading on Feb. 15 to Feb. 19, the people
said, asking not to be identified because the information is
confidential.  West Africa  Benchmark Nigerian Qua Iboe blend rose 9 cents to $2.16 a
barrel more than Dated Brent, Bloomberg data show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
