Colombia’s peso bonds rose, pushing
yields down toward a record, after the central bank cut the
benchmark rate yesterday to its lowest level among major Latin
America economies to boost the nation’s growth.  The peso rose for the first time in three days on
speculation policy makers’ decision to boost daily dollar
purchases to at least $30 million and buy $3 billion between
February and May won’t be enough to stem appreciation. The
currency rallied 9.7 percent in 2012, the most among major Latin
American currencies, making the nation’s coffee, flower and
banana exporters less competitive.  Yields on the government’s 10 percent peso-denominated debt
due in 2024 fell one basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, to
5.27 percent at 10:19 a.m. in Bogota, according to the central
bank. The price rose 0.067 centavo to 139.974 centavos per peso.
Yields closed on Jan. 25 at 5.23 percent, the lowest level since
the securities were first issued in 2009.  “The market had already priced in a cut, so we’re going to
see a very calm market,” said Jorge Cardozo, an analyst at
Bogota-based brokerage Corredores Asociados. “The gains will
continue, but we’re seeing a break after the strong rally in the
past month.”  Yields have tumbled 40 basis points in January in what
would be their eighth monthly drop as traders anticipated the
central bank’s fifth rate cut in seven meetings.  Banco de la Republica reduced its benchmark rate by a
quarter-percentage point to 4 percent yesterday, as forecast by
31 of 33 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  The peso strengthened 0.2 percent to 1,775.92 per dollar,
paring its drop in January to 0.6 percent.  “The measures won’t be enough to get the weaker exchange
rate that the government in seeking,” Cardozo said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
