Stocks in Switzerland  fell, with the
benchmark  Swiss Market Index (SMI)  slipping from a 4 1/2-year high,
before a report that may show U.S.  consumer confidence  continues
to decline.  UBS AG (UBSN)  slid 0.9 percent after a U.S. court order required
the bank to give records relating to Wegelin & Co. as part of a
probe into  tax evasion .  Novartis AG (NOVN)  dropped as a ruling
prevented its Sandoz unit from selling a generic drug in the
U.S. until August 2014.  The Swiss Market Index lost 0.6 percent to 7,439.45 at
10:35 a.m. in Zurich. The gauge has still rallied 9 percent in
2013, the best start to a year since the measure was formed in
1988. The broader Swiss Performance Index also retreated 0.6
percent today.  A report at 10 a.m. in  New York  may show confidence among
U.S. consumers declined for a third month. The Conference
Board’s index of sentiment fell to 64 in January from 65.1 in
December, economists said before the report.  American Home prices increased 5.5 percent in the 12 months
through November, the most since 2006, economists projected a
report from S&P/Case-Shiller will show.  In  Germany , consumer confidence will increase in February
due to a stable labor market and higher income expectations, Gfk
SE said. The Nuremberg-based market research company forecast
today that its  consumer-sentiment index , based on a survey of
about 2,000 people, will rise to 5.8 from a revised 5.7 in
January.  UBS fell 0.9 percent to 16.16 Swiss francs. U.S. District
Judge William H. Pauley III authorized the  Internal Revenue
Service  to serve a summons on UBS. The tax agency seeks records
of Wegelin’s correspondent account at UBS. Wegelin admitted on
Jan. 3 that it helped taxpayers hide more than $1.2 billion in
assets from the IRS.  Novartis AG,  Europe ’s biggest drugmaker, fell 0.6 percent
to 62.30 francs as a gauge of the region’s health-care stocks
slid for a fourth day.  Allergan Inc. won a U.S. appeals court ruling yesterday
that prevented Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. and Novartis
AG’s Sandoz unit from selling a generic version of the glaucoma
treatment Lumigan until August 2014.  To contact the reporter on this story:
