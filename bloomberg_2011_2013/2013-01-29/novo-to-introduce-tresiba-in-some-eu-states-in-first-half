Novo Nordisk A/S (NOVOB) , the world’s
biggest insulin maker, will start introducing its Tresiba
diabetes medicine in  Europe  during the first half this year.  Novo will make Tresiba available in all European Union
countries, Katrine Rud von Sperling, a spokeswoman for the
Bagsvaerd, Denmark-based company, said in e-mailed comments.  The “timing of the launch will be dependent on pricing and
reimbursement negotiations, with expected first launches during
the first half of 2013,” she wrote.  The once-a-day insulin Tresiba, also known as degludec,
obtained the European Commission’s marketing authorization on
Jan. 21. Novo’s Chief Scientific Officer Mads Krogsgaard Thomsen
said in a Nov. 9 interview the company was planning for U.S.
approval of the medicine for the first half this year, following
the backing of an advisory panel to the  Food and Drug
Administration .  Novo will give an update on the U.S. regulatory process
when it releases full-year results on Jan. 31, Rud von Sperling
said.  In  Japan , the medicine has been approved and Novo is
negotiating a price with the authorities there, she said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
