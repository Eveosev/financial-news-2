Pentair Ltd. (PNR) , a water filtration and
flow-control company, fell the most in three months after
forecasting first-quarter earnings lower than analysts’
estimates.  Shares fell 2.8 percent to $51.35 at the close in New York,
the most since Oct. 23.  Pentair, which was formed when Pentair Inc. merged with
 Tyco International Ltd. (TYC) ’s flow-control unit last year, sees
first-quarter revenue of $1.8 billion, or adjusted earnings-per-
share of 54 to 56 cents, according to a statement today. This is
below the $1.86 billion, or 68 cents a share, average  estimate 
of eight analysts compiled by Bloomberg.  “The fourth quarter results were in line with expectations
and marked the end of a historical transformational year for
Pentair,” Chairman and Chief Executive Officers Randall Hogan
said in the statement.  Fourth-quarter revenue more than doubled to $1.75 billion
from $866 million a year ago taking into consideration the Tyco
flow-control deal, according to the statement. Revenue for 2012
increased 28 percent to $4.4 billion compared with a year
earlier. The company said 2013 sales would be about $7.6
billion.  Pentair is incorporated in Switzerland for tax reasons and
has its main offices in  Minneapolis .  To contact the reporter on this story:
