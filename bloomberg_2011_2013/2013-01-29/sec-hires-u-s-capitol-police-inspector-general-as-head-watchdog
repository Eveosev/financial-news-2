The U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission today named the inspector general of the U.S. Capitol
Police as its top internal watchdog.  Carl W. Hoecker is a certified public accountant who began
his career as an Army military policeman, according to an SEC
announcement. He served as deputy assistant inspector general
for the Treasury Department from 2003 to 2006. The Capitol
Police provide security on the grounds of the U.S. Capitol.  Hoecker replaces H.  David Kotz , who quit a year ago. Kotz
had faced criticism of his investigations and possible conflicts
of interest, including his decision to accept tickets to a
Philadelphia Eagles football game from a radio broadcaster. The
office has been run temporarily by the inspector general of the
Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.  “I am deeply honored to have been selected for this
position,” Hoecker said in a statement. “The SEC has an
extremely important mission and I look forward to working with
the Commissioners, the SEC staff, and the SEC stakeholders as I
carry out my responsibilities under the Inspectors General
Act.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
