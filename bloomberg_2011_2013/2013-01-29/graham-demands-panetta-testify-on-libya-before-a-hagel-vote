Republican Senator Lindsey Graham
said he opposes voting on former Senator Chuck Hagel’s
nomination as defense secretary until current Secretary Leon Panettatestifies to Congress about the deadly attack on the
U.S. mission in Benghazi, Libya.  “I want to hear Panetta on Benghazi before confirming a
new defense secretary,” Graham of South Carolina told reporters
at the Capitol today. “I just want to find out what Panetta did
and what the president did as commander in chief” in responding
to the Sept. 11 attack that killed U.S. Ambassador Chris Stevens
and three other Americans.  Pentagon spokesman George Little said today that Panetta
will respond to Graham’s request. Departing Secretary of State
Hillary Clintontestified on the Benghazi attack last week, an
appearance some Republicans had demanded before they would agree
to a Senate vote on the nomination of Democratic Senator John Kerry of Massachusetts to succeed her.  The Senate is scheduled to vote on Kerry later today. The
Senate Armed Services Committee is set to consider the
nomination of Hagel, a former Republican senator from Nebraska,
on Jan. 31.  To contact the reporter on this story:
