Serbian police are questioning Milan Beko, the former Yugoslav privatization minister, for his role
in the sale of a company in Belgrade and his links with Miroslav Miskovic,  Serbia ’s richest man, web portal B92 said.  Serbia has stepped up its fight against corruption as part
of effort to convince the European Union it’s fit to start
membership talks. The government is reviewing the past sale of
24 companies after criticism from the European Parliament,
including the sale of  Luka Beograd AD , the company operating a
river port in Belgrade.  Beko’s Luxembourg-based Worldfin fund bought 40 percent of
Luka Beograd AD in 2005 from the Serbian state-run Share Fund
and later purchased stake from small shareholders at a price the
Serbian  anti-corruption watchdog  estimated to have been 2.5
times below the market value. Beko, who served as privatization
minister during the rule of former Serbian strongman  Slobodan
Milosevic , oversaw the sale of a minority stake in Telekom
Srbija AD to Greek and Italian buyers in 1997.  Police arrested Miskovic on Dec. 12 on fraud allegations,
after having him questioned twice, starting Dec. 3, 2012.  To contact the reporter on this story:
