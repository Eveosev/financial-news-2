Apollo Global Management LLC (APO)  and
 Oaktree Capital Group LLC (OAK)  won control of Nine Entertainment Co.,
 Australia ’s second-most watched television network, with a
federal judge giving final approval to a reorganization plan.  Federal Court Justice Peter Jacobson in Sydney today
approved the company’s plan to convert A$3.4 billion ($3.5
billion) of debt to equity, with the two U.S. firms given the
right to appoint five members of the nine-member board in the
first year.  CVC Capital Partners Ltd., the London-based buyout firm
which spent A$5.75 billion acquiring Nine Entertainment
beginning in 2006, ends up with A$4.5 million and a 0.75 percent
stake in the restructured company.  The plan won the support of 96.6 percent of the company’s
creditors in a vote, Jacobson said. The judge said he was
satisfied that since “no opposition to the scheme has been
made, that the scheme is one that appears to be fair and
reasonable.”  Nine has A$2.2 billion of senior debt, according to court
filings, which is due to mature Feb. 7. Apollo and Oaktree hold
A$893 million of the debt.  Nine also owns Australia’s largest indoor music venue and
Ticketek, an event ticketing company. Its most popular
television programs include the Australian version of Big
Brother, British motoring show “Top Gear,” and  CBS Corp. (CBS) ’s
crime drama the “Mentalist.”  The case is In the Matter of Nine Entertainment Group.
