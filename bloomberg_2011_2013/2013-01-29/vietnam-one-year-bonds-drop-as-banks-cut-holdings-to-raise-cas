Vietnam ’s one-year bonds fell the
most in seven months on speculation banks pared holdings to
raise cash to meet withdrawals before the Lunar New Year
holiday. The dong was steady.  The State Treasury sold 2.29 trillion dong ($109 million)
of 364-day bills at an average 7.90 percent yesterday, according
to the Hanoi Stock Exchange  website , compared with 7.65 percent
on Jan. 21. The yield rose as banks preferred holding cash,
paring demand for the notes, said Pham Tri Hieu, a fixed-income
trader at  Military Commercial Joint-Stock Bank (MBB)  in Hanoi. Vietnam
will celebrate the week-long Lunar New Year holiday, known as
Tet, starting Feb. 9.  “In two weeks we have the Tet holiday, so banks have to
reserve more money to prepare,” Hieu said.  The yield on one-year bonds rose 19 basis points, or 0.19
percentage point, to 8.05 percent, according to a daily fixing
rate from banks compiled by Bloomberg. That’s the biggest
increase since June 25. The yield on benchmark five-year bonds
was unchanged at 9.05 percent.  The dong traded at 20,848 per dollar as of 2:55 p.m. in
Hanoi, compared with 20,843 yesterday, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. The  State Bank  of Vietnam set its
 reference rate  at 20,828, unchanged since December 2011,
according to its website. The currency is allowed to trade up to
1 percent on either side of the rate.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
