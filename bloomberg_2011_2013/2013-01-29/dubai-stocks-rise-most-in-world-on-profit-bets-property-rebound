Dubai stocks advanced the most in
the world as a real estate recovery in the sheikhdom spurred
bets companies including  Emaar Properties PJSC (EMAAR)  will post
stronger full-year earnings and dividends.  Emaar, developer of the world’s tallest tower, surged to
the highest level since October 2009.  Emirates NBD PJSC (EMIRATES) , the
biggest United Arab Emirates bank by assets, soared 8.6 percent
on volume of more than six times the three-month daily average.
The benchmark DFM General Index jumped 1.8 percent to 1,853.17,
the strongest since April 2010, at the close in Dubai. The gain
was the biggest among 94 global indexes tracked by Bloomberg.  Dubai’s property industry recovered last year after a crash
sent prices plunging 65 percent from mid-2008 peaks. Emaar,
which has the heaviest weighting on Dubai’s measure, rose 7.4
percent since saying Jan. 27 that a luxury hotel project in
central Dubai sold out all units available in the first
offering. The developer’s 2012 profit probably rose 16 percent,
the average estimate of  11 analysts  compiled by Bloomberg shows.  “Long-term investors have returned to the market amid
strong economic and earnings fundamentals, particularly for
bigger companies such as Emaar and Emirates NBD,” said Dubai-
based Waleed Al Khateeb, senior finance manager at Daman
Securities LLC. “Sentiment for the real estate sector is strong
and investors expect the recovery to continue this year as new
projects are announced and the worst is behind us.”  Faster Growth  Dubai’s economy may have expanded 5 percent in 2012, the
fastest pace since 2007, according to government forecasts. In
November, the emirate announced plans to develop a new district
with the world’s largest mall, 100 hotels and gardens larger
than  London ’s Hyde Park. The sheikhdom also plans to build five
theme parks for $2.7 billion.  Emaar shares surged 3.7 percent to 4.81 dirhams today,
while Emirates NBD gained the most since April 2011 to 3.8
dirhams. The bank’s  fourth-quarter profit  may more than double
to 517 million dirhams ($141 million), according to the average
estimate of six analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. The stock’s
three-day gain of 17 percent is the biggest since October 2007.  “Volumes have improved and foreigners who were put off are
coming back in,” Al Khateeb said. “They’re going to be in for
a while.”  About 240  million shares  traded in Dubai today, compared
with a 12-month daily average of 182 million shares. The  DFM
General Index (DFMGI) ’s 14-day  relative strength index  rose to 83 today.
A reading above 70 indicates to some analysts that a security or
index is poised to decline. The measure was the Gulf Cooperation
Council’s best performer last year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
