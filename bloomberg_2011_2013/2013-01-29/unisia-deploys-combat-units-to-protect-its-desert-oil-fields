Tunisia has deployed military units
to protect  oil fields  along its desert borders with Algeria and
 Libya , the official TAP news agency reported.  “The army has deployed special combat units in different
important sites in the Tunisian desert to protect oil and gas
fields,” TAP said, citing security officials who weren’t
identified by name. The move is aimed at preventing “any
terrorist attacks against these fields, especially near the
Tunisian-Algerian border.”  The step comes after militants stormed a natural gas
complex in neighboring Algeria on Jan. 16, taking dozens of
foreigners hostage. The four-day siege left at least 38
foreigners and 32 militants dead.  To contact the reporter on this story:
