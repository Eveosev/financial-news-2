Canadian crudes strengthened against
domestic benchmark West  Texas  Intermediate after Valero Energy
Corp. said it’s considering using barges and rail to move more
Canadian oil to the Gulf Coast.  “We are bringing some heavy sour Canadian crudes into Port
Arthur,” Texas, where the company has a refinery, Valero
President Joe Gorder said on an earnings call. “We want heavy
sour crude in the Gulf Coast.”  Syncrude, a synthetic light crude produced from bitumen,
strengthened 75 cents to a $1 discount to WTI, at 2:06 p.m. New
York time, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Western
Canada Select, a heavy bitumen blend, gained 25 cents to trade
at a $31.75 discount.  Gulf Coast crudes were mixed. Thunder Horse weakened 25
cents to a $14.75 premium, while Southern Green lost 25 cents to
trade at $12.75 above WTI. Poseidon’s premium was unchanged at
$12.25 a barrel over WTI.  Light Louisiana Sweet gained 10 cents to $17.45 a barrel
above WTI. Heavy Louisiana Sweet’s premium gained 10 cents to
$17.40 a barrel.  To contact the reporter on this story:
