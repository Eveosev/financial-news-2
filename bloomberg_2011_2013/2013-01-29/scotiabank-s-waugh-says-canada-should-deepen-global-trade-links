Increasing trade links with foreign
countries should be a priority for Canadian firms,  Bank of Nova
Scotia  Chief Executive Officer  Richard Waugh  said.  “We need to reach out to new markets, strengthen ties
abroad and find new customers and partners beyond our borders,”
said Waugh, according to the text of a speech he’s scheduled to
give today at a  Toronto Board of Trade  event. “It’s more than
just a call for action. It’s making it a top Canadian
priority.”  Increasing international trade helps companies become more
efficient and productive, said Waugh, 65, a vice chairman of the
 Institute of International Finance . Toronto-based Scotiabank,
the country’s third-largest lender by assets, has operations in
about 55 countries and posted record  profit  of C$6.47 billion
($6.43 billion) in the year ended Oct. 31.  Canada needs to continue pushing “to deepen trade links
and provide the resources and policies to support these and
future initiatives at all levels of government,” Waugh said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
