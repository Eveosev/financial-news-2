Hidili Industry International
Development Ltd. (1393) , a Chinese mining company and producer of
coking coal, said a lawsuit was filed against it in Hong Kong
seeking to void a conversion of bonds into new stock.  The two plaintiffs said notices to convert 104.6 million
 yuan  ($16.8 million) of bonds into shares were mistakenly
issued, rather than notices to redeem the bonds, according to
Hidili’s filing yesterday to Hong Kong’s stock exchange. The
suit alleges the company “knew or ought to have known” that
the plaintiffs intended to file for redemption and therefore the
conversion notices are void, according to the filing.  Hidili said it will seek to verify that it has been served
with the writ, filed in Hong Kong’s High Court on Jan. 28, and
will seek legal advice and make further statements as necessary.
The convertible bonds are yuan-denominated, U.S. dollar-settled
1.5 percent notes issued in 2010 and maturing in 2015.  Hidili, based in Panzhihua, Sichuan,  China , gained 4
percent to close at HK$2.31 yesterday in Hong Kong, before the
announcement. The shares have fallen 21 percent in the past
year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
