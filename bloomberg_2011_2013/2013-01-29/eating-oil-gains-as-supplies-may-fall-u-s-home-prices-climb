Heating oil advanced on speculation
that distillate fuel inventories fell last week and as November
home prices rose by the most in six years, indicating a stronger
economy.  Futures gained as the Energy Information Administration
will probably report tomorrow that stockpiles of heating oil and
diesel fell 500,000 barrels last week, according to the median
estimate of nine analysts in a Bloomberg survey. The S&P/Case-
Shiller property values  index  climbed 5.5 percent from November
2011, the biggest year-over-year jump since August 2006.  “The market continues to be supported by positive economic
headlines, giving confidence the economy will continue to grow
and worldwide demand will increase,” said  Andy Lipow , president
of Lipow Oil Associates LLC in Houston.  Heating oil for February delivery rose 3.84 cents, or 1.3
percent, to $3.10 a gallon at 1:12 p.m. on the  New York 
Mercantile Exchange. Volume was 7.4 percent above the 100-day
average for the time of day.  February heating oil and gasoline contracts will expire at
the close of floor trading Jan. 31. The more actively traded
March contract advanced 3.51 cents to $3.0894 a gallon.  The March heating oil crack spread increased 56 cents to
$32.40 a barrel on the exchange. The discount of February
heating oil to gasoil on the ICE Futures Europe exchange
increased 0.61 cent to 3.61 cents a gallon at 1:10 p.m., based
on the Bloomberg fair-value index data.  EIA Inventories  The EIA is scheduled to report last week’s inventories at
10:30 a.m. tomorrow in  Washington . The report will probably show
that supplies of the gasoline rose 1 million barrels, according
to the survey.  Gasoline for February delivery climbed 2.23 cents, or 0.8
percent, to $2.9571 a gallon the exchange, the ninth consecutive
increase. Volume was 22 percent above the 100-day average for
the time of day. March gasoline increased 1.93 cents to $2.9602
a gallon.  Today’s gain follows a 2.1 percent jump for February
gasoline yesterday after  Hess Corp. (HES)  said it will shut the Port
Reading,  New Jersey , refinery at the end of February and sell
its 19 East Coast storage terminals. The 70,000-barrel-a-day
refinery’s fluid catalytic cracker makes gasoline and components
for blending heating oil.  The announcement comes as refineries in Padd 1, which
includes New York Harbor, the delivery point for Nymex futures,
have units down for repairs and maintenance planned.  Refinery Work  Philadelphia Energy Solutions will shut the Girard Point
section of its plant, the largest near the harbor, this month
for sixty days of work. A fluid catalytic cracker at  Delta
Airlines Inc. (DAL) ’s Trainer,  Pennsylvania , refinery has been shut
for repairs since December.  “The Trainer cat cracker is still offline and by this
weekend, Philadelphia Energy Solutions be going into maintenance
and by the end of February the  Port Reading  refinery will be
shut,” Lipow said.  The  retail price  for regular gasoline, averaged nationwide,
rose 1.5 cents to $3.364 a gallon, the highest level since Dec.
6, AAA said today on its website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
