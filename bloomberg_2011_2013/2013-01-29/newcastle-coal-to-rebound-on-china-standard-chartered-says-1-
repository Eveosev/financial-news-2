Power-station coal at the Australian
port of Newcastle, a benchmark grade for  Asia , will rebound this
year amid rising demand from  China , according to  Standard
Chartered  Plc.  Newcastle prices will rise to $100 a metric ton in 2014
after averaging $95 a ton this year, Serene Lim, an analyst at
the bank, said at a conference in Singapore today. The coal
benchmark slid to $94.29 a ton in 2012 from more than $120 in
2011, according to data from IHS McCloskey.  “ China’s economy  will improve as the year progresses,”
said Lim, forecasting China’s economic growth will be 8.3
percent this year, up from 7.8 percent in 2012. “We saw last
year, Chinese seaborne demand was the key.”  China’s coal consumption may rise as much as 6 percent this
year amid investments in infrastructure, Hao Xiangbin, the head
of marketing at the China Coal Transportation and Distribution
Association, said at the same conference today.  Coal slid last year as slower economic growth in China and
 Europe  cut demand while supply to Asia from Colombia, the U.S.
and other exporters climbed. It was at $91.05 a ton on Jan. 25.  The fuel may average $98 a ton this year and increase to
$108 next year, Andrew Shaw, a commodities analyst at Credit
Suisse AG, said at the conference. Prices will range from $90 to
$95 a ton this year and rise to $105 in 2014, according to
Isnaputra Iskandar, the vice president of equity research at PT
Nomura Indonesia.  To contact the reporters on this story:
