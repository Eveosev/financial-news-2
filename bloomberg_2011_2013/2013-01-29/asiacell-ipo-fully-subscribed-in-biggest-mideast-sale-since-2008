Asiacell Communications PJSC’s share
sale, the  Middle East ’s biggest initial public offering since
2008, was fully subscribed before its closing date, according to
the Iraqi IPO’s organizer.  “The offering is now comfortably covered with a good mix
of retail and institutional demand from within Iraq as well as
institutional and high net worth demand from abroad,” Shwan Ibrahim Taha, chairman of Rabee Securities, said in an e-mail to
 Bloomberg News  today. Asiacell Chief Executive Officer Diar
Ahmed confirmed the subscription in a phone interview.  Asiacell, majority-owned by  Qatar Telecom QSC, (QTEL)  planned to
raise 1.49 trillion dinars ($1.3 billion), the most for an IPO
in the Middle East and North Africa since  Saudi Arabian Mining
Co.’s (MAADEN)  share sale more than four years ago, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. The IPO will help double the market value
of the Iraq Stock Exchange, Chief Executive Officer Taha Ahmed
Abdul-Salam al-Rubaye said in a Jan. 7 interview.  Asiacell offered 67.5 billion shares, or 25 percent of its
share capital, in the IPO that opened Jan. 3. The offering will
close Feb. 2 and shares are due to start trading Feb. 3 in
 Baghdad .  The phone operator obtained a 15-year mobile
telecommunications license in 2007 and had 43 percent market
share by revenue at the end of September, with 9.9 million
individual and corporate subscribers, it said last month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
