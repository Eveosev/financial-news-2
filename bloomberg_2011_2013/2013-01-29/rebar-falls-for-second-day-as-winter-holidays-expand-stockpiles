Steel reinforcement-bar futures
dropped for a second day on speculation that inventories will
climb in  China  as construction slows during the winter and ahead
of the Lunar New Year holidays.  Rebar for delivery in May fell as much as 0.6 percent to
4,043 yuan ($650) a metric ton on the Shanghai Futures Exchange
and was at 4,060 at the 11:30 a.m. midday break. The most-active
contract reached 4,085 yuan on Jan. 25, the highest price since
July 6.  “There are very few sporadic purchases in the  spot market 
as most of the construction sites are gradually halting
activities approaching the Chinese New Year,” Yongan Futures
Co. said in a report today. “There will also be less liquidity
in the futures market as some investors chose to close out
positions and leave the market before the holidays.”  Rebar steel inventory  in China gained for a fifth week to
6.26 million tons, according to the Shanghai Steelhome
Information. The Chinese markets will be closed for the week-
long New Year break, which commences Feb. 9 this year.  Spot  iron ore  at Tianjin port was little changed at $148.40
a dry ton yesterday, according to The Steel Index Ltd. The
average spot  price  for rebar was 3,733  yuan  a ton yesterday,
according to data from Beijing Antaike Information Development
Co.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
