Indofood Agri Resources Ltd. (IFAR) , a
Singaporean agriculture company, plans to acquire a 50 percent
stake in the Brazilian sugar-cane processor Cia. Mineira de
Acucar e Alcool Participacoes as the South American nation
prepares to boost domestic consumption of ethanol.  Indofood will pay 143.4 million reais ($72 million) for the
stake in CMAA, which owns a mill in the municipality of Uberaba
capable of processing 3 million metric tons of cane a year,
according to a stock filing with the Singapore stock exchange.  Brazil  will raise in June the rate for blending ethanol
with gasoline to 25 percent from 20 percent. That will increase
annual demand for the renewable fuel by 1.9 billion liters (500
million gallons), according to Salim Morsy, an analyst at
Bloomberg New Energy Finance’s  Sao Paulo  office.  “Mills will have a broader domestic market,” Morsy said
today in an interview.  The deal is expected to close in the second quarter,
Indofood said in the Jan. 28 filing. CMAA’s mill produces sugar
and ethanol, as well as electricity from burning crop residues,
and its annual capacity may eventually be expanded to 3.8
million tons.  To contact the reporter on this story:
