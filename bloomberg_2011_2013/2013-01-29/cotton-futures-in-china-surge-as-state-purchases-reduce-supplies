Cotton futures traded in  China ’s
Zhengzhou climbed the most in a year after government purchases
reduced the supply in the local market.  Cotton for May delivery advanced 2.6 percent to 20,385  yuan 
($3,273) a metric ton on the Zhengzhou Futures Exchange, the
biggest gain at close since Feb. 1, 2012. The most-active
contract is headed for a 7.6 percent gain this month, the most
in two years.  The Chinese government bought record quantities of cotton
in the last two years to protect domestic farmers, according to
 the China Cotton Association . The country stockpiled 5.83
million tons from the current harvest, about 85 percent of the
total output, as of Jan. 22, the group said. Purchases in 2011
were 3.12 million tons, the government said.  “The government purchases have led to a bizarre shortage
with about 90 percent of local cotton that meets the standards
of deliverable stocks to Zhengzhou exchange ending up in
government warehouses,”  Du Ying , an analyst at Wanda Futures
Co., said by phone from Urumqi today.  Cotton output this year may reach 7.41 million tons, up 1.8
percent from a year earlier, the association said today.  “Don’t mistake the shortage of the deliverable stocks as a
real shortage in the  spot market ,” Wanda’s Du said. “Apart
from those that can be delivered to the exchange warehouses, the
market is awash with all kinds of local and imported cotton and
the demand from textile industry remains anemic.”  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
