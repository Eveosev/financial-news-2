German  consumer confidence  will
increase in February due to a stable labor market and higher
income expectations,  Gfk SE (GFK)  said.  The Nuremberg-based market research company forecast today
that its  consumer-sentiment index , based on a survey of about
2,000 people, will rise to 5.8 from a revised 5.7 in January.
Economists expected a gain to 5.7 from the initial January
reading of 5.6, according to the median of 34 estimates in a
 Bloomberg News survey .  The Bundesbank said last week that  Germany ’s economy,
 Europe ’s largest, is already rebounding from a contraction in
the final quarter of 2012. Business and investor confidence both
rose more than economists forecasts this month, and a gauge of
activity in  service industries  climbed to a 19-month high.  “Germans are once again focusing on the generally pleasing
domestic state of affairs,” GfK said in an e-mailed statement.
“The labor market is stable and inflation is moderate.
Consequently, both income expectations and willingness to buy
have risen quite considerably.”  A measure of economic expectations rose to minus 11.3 in
January from minus 17.9 in December, GfK said. A gauge of income
expectations climbed to 36 from 21.2, and an index measuring
willingness to buy jumped to 35.3 from 20.1.  Metro AG (MEO) , Germany’s biggest retailer, on Jan. 16 said same-
store sales at its consumer-electronics unit rose more than 3
percent in Germany in the fourth quarter.  Unemployment increased less than economists forecast in
December and the  jobless rate  held steady at 6.9 percent, close
to a two-decade low.  Still, the government forecasts economic growth will slow
to just 0.4 percent this year from 0.7 percent last year and 3
percent in 2011 as a recession in the euro area damps demand for
German exports.  To contact the reporter on this story:
