U.S.  natural gas  futures fell for a
sixth day as forecasts for unusually mild February weather
signaled reduced demand for the heating fuel.  Gas dropped 1.9 percent as forecasters including MDA
Weather Services in Gaithersburg,  Maryland , said above-normal
temperatures in the central U.S. next week will sweep into the
East from Feb. 8 through Feb. 12. The futures have declined 11
percent from a six-week high on Jan. 22 as fuel demand dropped
because of above-average temperatures.  “We have a whole wave of warm weather coming in,” said
Bob Yawger, director of the futures division at Mizuho
Securities USA Inc. in  New York . “We had a spike on the cold
weather that we had last week so we are getting the retracement
off of that.”  Natural gas for February delivery fell 6.3 cents to $3.226
per million British thermal units on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange , the lowest settlement price since Jan. 10. The futures
have slipped 3.7 percent this month.  The February gas contract expired today. The more active
March futures fell 4.7 cents, or 1.4 percent, to $3.258.  Gas trading volume was 237,601 contracts at 2:47 p.m., 18
percent below the 100-day average for the time of day. Open
interest yesterday dropped to 1.156 million contracts, the least
since Dec. 28.  March $3 puts were the most active gas options in
electronic trading. They were 0.6 cent higher at 3.1 cents per
million Btu on volume of 1,283 contracts as of 3:06 p.m. Puts
accounted for 53 percent of options volume.  Stockpile Report  U.S. gas inventories  totaled 2.996 trillion cubic feet in
the week ended Jan. 18, 12 percent above the five-year average
for the period, the Energy Information Administration said last
week. The next report from the Energy Department’s statistical
arm, due Jan. 31, may show a  decline  205 billion cubic feet,
based on the median of eight  analyst estimates  compiled by
Bloomberg. The average decline for the week 178 billion.  Gas production  in the contiguous states climbed to a record
in October as more of the fuel was pumped from shale formations
in the Northeast and  North Dakota , the EIA said Jan. 7. Output
increased 0.4 percent to 73.54 billion cubic feet a day from a
revised 73.22 billion the previous month, the administration
said in its  EIA-914 report . The next update is due Jan. 31.  The number of  rigs drilling  for gas totaled 434 last week,
down 42 percent from a year earlier, according to Baker Hughes
Inc. in Houston.  Gas Production  “Even with the falling rig count, production remains at
records levels, although some reports are beginning to emerge
about some output declines,”  Mike Fitzpatrick , editor of the
Energy OverView newsletter in New York, wrote today.  Total U.S. marketed gas output will increase 0.9 percent to
69.84 billion cubic feet a day 2013, setting a record for the
sixth consecutive year, EIA estimates show.  Excess supplies of ethane because of strong production
growth and limiting processing capacity “has emerged as an
important factor supporting U.S. natural gas supply in recent
months,” Johan Spetz, an analyst with Goldman Sachs Group Inc.
in New York, said in a note to clients yesterday.  “The petrochemical industry will struggle to absorb all
the ethane production growth until new large-scale crackers
start operations in 2017-2018,” he said. Processing plants are
selling ethane as part of gas supply used to fuel electricity
generators, rather than separating ethane as gas liquid used in
manufacturing.  This “ethane rejection” of about 200,000 barrels a day is
contributing to about 300 million cubic feet a day of gas
supply, Spetz said.  Fading Momentum  Momentum in gas prices is fading after the mid-January
rally, based on a technical indicator called the moving average
convergence-divergence, or MACD, said  Chris Kostas , senior power
and gas analyst for Energy Security Analytics Inc. in Andover,
 Massachusetts .  MACD tracks changes in price momentum based on the
difference between the 12-day and 26-day moving averages of gas
futures. Today’s settlement below $3.24 per million Btu means
the MACD line crossed below a line charting the nine-day moving
average, which is a bearish signal, he said.  “Good support seems to exist between $3.10 and $3.20,”
Kostas said. “It may be too early to slice through those
support levels in the short-term.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
