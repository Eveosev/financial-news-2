Hungary  has made “significant
progress” on reforms to the country’s judicial and media laws,
the Council of Europe said.  “We have been able to change fundamentally the laws
regarding two indispensable institutions in a system of checks
and balances and rule of law, namely the judiciary and the
media,” Thorbjoern Jagland, secretary general of the
intergovernmental group, told a press briefing in Brussels
today.  The reforms will result in fewer powers and more
accountability for the president of the National Judicial Office
in Hungary, including an agreement that the president can no
longer be re-elected, Jagland said. The NJO president also may
not initiate legislation, only make suggestions, he said.  Jagland said discussions with Hungary also led to several
proposed amendments to the nation’s media law, including
limiting the mandate of the president of the media authority and
media council to one nine-year term. In addition, journalistic
sources are now adequately protected in Hungarian law in line
with the European Convention on Human Rights, the Council of
 Europe  said.  Cooperation between Hungary and the council will continue
on media law “to further improve the legislation,” the council
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
