The Cayman Finance trade group,
which represents the country’s financial services industry,
named Gonzalo Jalles as chief executive officer.  Jalles, formerly CEO of HSBC Cayman, had previously worked
at the bank’s offices in London, Bermuda and  Argentina , Cayman
Finance said in an e-mailed statement today. He founded a
financial services company, Javelin Group, last year and had led
the  Cayman Islands  Bankers’ Association from 2009-2012,
according to the statement.  The Cayman Islands, a British Overseas Territory, is home
to the highest number of  hedge funds  in the Caribbean and has
historically attracted companies such as Bain Capital LLC and
Medtronic Inc.  Jalles will lead the trade group as the island government
proposes tighter regulations for hedge funds, including listing
directors for the first time.  The nation had 10,841 funds registered at the end of last
year, down from 10,979 on Sept. 30, according to the country’s
monetary authority.  To contact the reporter on this story:
