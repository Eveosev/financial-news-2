Soybeans gained for the third
session, the longest rally in seven weeks, and corn rose on
speculation that dry, warm weather in early February will reduce
Argentina crop prospects, boosting U.S. exports demand.  As much as 0.75 inch (1.9 centimeters) of rain from Feb. 1
to Feb. 10 won’t ease crop stress from a month of below-normal
precipitation, and moisture deficits will increase, Kyle Tapley,
a meteorologist at Gaithersburg, Maryland-based MDA Information
Systems Inc., said in a telephone interview. Argentina is the
world’s biggest shipper of soy-based animal feed and vegetable
oil  “The forecasts are less promising for any relief from
dryness, and that is helping to lift prices,” Bill Nelson, a
senior economist at Doane Advisory Services Co. in St. Louis,
said in a telephone interview. “Plants are beginning to suffer,
and dry weather into the first half of February could cause
yield losses.”  Soybean futures for March delivery gained 0.3 percent to
close at $14.5175 a bushel at 2 p.m. on the Chicago Board of
Trade. The price climbed for the third-straight session, the
longest rally since Dec. 6.  Corn futures for March delivery rose less than 0.1 percent
to $7.295 a bushel. The grain has jumped 4.5 percent this month
after the U.S. government said domestic inventories on Dec. 1
fell to the lowest in nine years.  The U.S. was the largest producer and exporter of both
crops last year. Corn is the nation’s biggest crop, valued at
$76.5 billion in 2011, followed by soybeans at $35.8 billion,
government figures show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
