Manchester United  is the first
sports franchise in the world worth more than $3 billion,
according to  Forbes magazine , which puts the record 19-time
English soccer champion’s value at $3.3 billion.  Manchester United is owned by the Glazer family, which in
August sold 16.7 million shares in the team -- equal to a 10
percent stake -- for $14 each in an initial public offering.
With the stock price rising to almost $17, Manchester United’s
enterprise value has pushed past $3 billion, Forbes said.  The National Football League’s Dallas Cowboys are the
second-most valuable team in sports, worth $2.1 billion,
according to Forbes.  To contact the reporter on this story:
