Marathon Petroleum Corp. (MPC)  will shut a
crude unit and a coker at the Garyville  refinery , the second-
biggest in  Louisiana , in October for planned maintenance, a
person familiar with the schedule said.  The units will be shut for about 30 days of repairs, said
the person, who asked not to be identified because the
information isn’t public. The coker wasn’t part of a $3.9
million expansion at the plant completed in January 2010, the
person said.  Shane Pochard, a Marathon spokesman based at the company’s
headquarters in Findlay,  Ohio , declined by e-mail to comment on
the work.  The Garyville plant can process 490,000 barrels a day and
runs primarily heavy, sour crude oils, according to Marathon’s
website.  Crude units heat oil and divide its ingredients according
to the temperatures at which they boil. Cokers use thermal
processing to convert heavy refinery streams, such as vacuum
bottoms, into lighter products such as naphtha and heating oil.  To contact the reporter on this story:
