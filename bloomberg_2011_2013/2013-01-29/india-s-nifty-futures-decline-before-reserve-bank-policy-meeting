India ’s benchmark stock index fell
by the most in a week even after the central bank cut  interest
rates  for the first time since April. Telecommunication and
energy companies led the declines.  The BSE India Sensitive Index, or Sensex, slid 0.6 percent
to 19,990.90 at the close, the steepest drop since Jan. 22.
 Bharti Airtel Ltd. (BHARTI) , the nation’s largest mobile-phone operator,
sank 2.2 percent, the most since Dec. 21.  Reliance Industries
Ltd. (RIL) , the owner the world’s largest oil-refining complex, fell
for the fourth day, losing 1.6 percent.  Stocks fell even as the  Reserve Bank  of India cut its key
 repurchase rate  by 25 basis points to 7.75 percent, an outcome
predicted by 30 of 35 analysts in a Bloomberg survey, and pared
the  cash reserve ratio  to 4 percent from 4.25 percent. The
Sensex, which closed at a two-year high of 20,103.53 on Jan. 25,
trades at 15.9 times estimated earnings, the highest level since
February last year, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  “As we move toward multi-year highs on the index, there
would be a tendency to sell,” Aneesh Srivastava, who oversees
$475 million as the chief investment officer at Mumbai-based
IDBI Federal Life Insurance Co., said by phone. “The policy
event is behind us, without really throwing any surprises. The
25-basis point cut was priced in.”  The Sensex has advanced 2.9 percent in 2013, extending last
year’s 26-percent jump, as foreign funds bought Indian shares
amid government efforts to curb subsidies, allow higher foreign
investment in the retail and airline sectors and speed up
infrastructure projects in a bid to revive  economic growth .  Foreigners  bought  $24.5 billion of local shares in 2012,
the most among 10 Asian markets tracked by Bloomberg. The flows
helped the Sensex to its biggest  annual advance  in three years.
Offshore funds have plowed $3.5 billion into Indian stocks this
month, surpassing the previous January record of $2.18 billion
set last year.  Telecom Stocks  Bharti declined 2.2 percent to 349.5 rupees. Reliance
Communications Ltd.,  India’s (SENSEX)  third-largest mobile-phone company
by subscribers, sank 3.9 percent to 81 rupees. The stock, which
is not part of the Sensex, was among the worst performers on the
 MSCI Emerging Markets Index (MXEF)  today.  Reliance Industries dropped 1.6 percent to 882.85 rupees,
the biggest decline since Oct. 8. The company’s KG-D6 and NEC-25
fields are among 14 oil and gas blocks that have been declared
“no-go” areas by India’s defense ministry, barring any
exploration or production activity,  Press Trust of India 
reported yesterday, citing people it didn’t identify.  Lenders Drop  HDFC Bank Ltd. (HDFCB) , the nation’s second-largest private lender,
slumped 2.7 percent to 652.45 rupees, the most since June 1.
 State Bank of India (SBIN) , the largest lender, slid 1.2 percent to
2,462.45 rupees.  Tata Motors Ltd. (TTMT) , the owner of Jaguar Land
Rover, fell 1.4 percent to 304.25 rupees, ending a two-day
rally. Motorcycle maker  Bajaj Auto Ltd. (BJAUT)  tumbled 2.6 percent to
2,031.85 rupees, the largest drop since Aug. 29.  India became the first major Asian economy to cut funding
costs in 2013, after  inflation  moderated to a three-year low of
7.18 percent in December. The reading is still the highest in
the so-called BRIC group of major emerging nations. The RBI
lowered its inflation estimate to 6.8 percent from 7.5 percent
and said price gains are likely to stay around current levels
going into 2013-2014.  “The message that we are trying to give is that as much as
there is some space, it’s going to be quite limited and we are
going to use it with a lot of judgment, on both the timing and
the quantum,” Governor  Duvvuri Subbarao  said at a meeting today
in Mumbai. The RBI cut its growth forecast for the year to March
to 5.5 percent from 5.8 percent. That would be the slowest since
2002-2003.  ‘Hawkish Stance’  “The policy had nothing dramatically positive for the
stock market,” U.R. Bhat, managing director of Dalton Capital
Advisors India Pvt. in Mumbai, said by phone. “RBI’s stance is
relatively hawkish and it will not be able to bring down key
interest rates until inflation comes under control.”  Sterlite Industries (India) Ltd. (STLT) , the nation’s top copper
producer, had its first drop in three days after reporting group
net income of 11.9 billion rupees ($222 million) for the quarter
ended December, which missed the 13.9 billion-rupee median of
analysts’ estimates in a Bloomberg survey. The stock lost 0.7
percent to 113.25 rupees.  Three out of 14, or 21 percent, of Sensex companies that
have reported December-quarter  earnings  have missed forecasts,
compared with 40 percent in the previous two quarters, data
compiled by Bloomberg show.  The S&P CNX  Nifty Index (NIFTY)  on the National Stock Exchange of
India fell 0.4 percent to 6,049.90 while its January futures
settled at 6,049.40. India VIX, which gauges the cost of
protection against losses in the Nifty, slid 4.6 percent, the
most in three weeks, to 14.47, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
