Canadian farmers are expected to
reduce their planting of the oilseed canola by 10 percent this
spring in favor of wheat, Oil World said.  Canola may be sown on 7.7 million hectares (19 million
acres), down from a record 8.61 million hectares in the spring
of 2012, the Hamburg-based industry researcher wrote.  The reasons for the expected lower plantings include
disappointing canola yields last year, disease problems due to
lack of crop rotation, higher wheat prices and increased soybean
planting, according to Oil World.  “There is a high probablility that Canadian farmers will
sharply reduce canola plantings this spring, mainly in favor of
wheat,” Oil World wrote. “Wheat prices have become relatively
more attractive than canola prices.”  Canola for delivery in November, after this year’s harvest,
has advanced 7.7 percent in Winnipeg in the past 12 months,
compared to a 15 percent increase for December-delivery wheat
traded in  Chicago .  “The drought in the U.S. winter-wheat areas as well as in
 Australia  has fueled concern about next season’s global supply
and contributed to the recent strength of wheat prices,” Oil
World said.  Canada ’s canola harvest fell to an estimated 13.9 million
tons in 2012 from 14.6 million tons the previous year after dry
and hot weather in July, according to Oil World. Under normal to
favorable conditions, Canadian farmers might still harvest
between 14.5 million and 15 million tons this year, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
