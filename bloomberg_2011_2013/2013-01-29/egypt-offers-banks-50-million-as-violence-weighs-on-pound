Egypt ’s central bank will offer $50
million at a currency auction today as the pound weakens amid an
escalation of unrest since the second anniversary of the Jan. 25
uprising. The benchmark dollar bonds fell for a third day.  The regulator will auction $50 million to local lenders,
which are able to bid for as much as $7 million each, according
to its announcement on Bloomberg. The central bank sold $48.1
million of the U.S. currency at a Jan. 27 auction, the smallest
amount since it started the sales on Dec. 30 in a bid to
conserve foreign reserves. Banks received about 28 percent of
what they sought that day.  The pound, which has weakened 7 percent in the past month,
was unchanged at a record 6.6565 a dollar as of 10:30 a.m. in
Cairo. The currency’s depreciation accelerated after the last
auction as clashes in several Egyptian provinces killed more
than 50 people, according to Health Ministry estimates.  The yield on the government’s 5.75 percent dollar-
denominated 2020 bonds rose three basis points, or 0.03 of a
percentage point, to 5.73 percent, taking its three-day advance
to 17 basis points, according to prices compiled by Bloomberg.
That’s the highest level on a closing basis in more than three
weeks.  Thousands of people marched in Suez Canal cities last night
in defiance of a curfew and state of emergency declared in their
region by President Mohamed Mursi. The nation’s biggest
opposition bloc rejected yesterday’s round of talks with the
government.  The central bank will also offer 5 billion Egyptian pounds
($751 million) of seven-day repurchase agreements today. The
contracts allow government-debt holders to sell securities back
to the regulator for access to temporary funds at 9.75 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
