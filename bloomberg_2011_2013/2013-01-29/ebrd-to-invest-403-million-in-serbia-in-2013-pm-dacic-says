The European Bank for Reconstruction
and Development plans to invest 300 million euros ($402.8
million) this year in  Serbia  to help it improve public companies
and to sell some state assets, Prime Minister  Ivica Dacic  said.  The London-based lender will invest the funds “in 20
projects in Serbia this year and plans to increase investment in
the private sector development,” Dacic said in an e-mailed
statement today, after meeting with Matteo Patrone, the EBRD’s
resident representative.  Serbia seeks a new loan deal with the  International
Monetary Fund  to shore up confidence that government policies
will bolster macroeconomic stability after the fiscal deficit
hit a record 7.2 percent of gross domestic product in June. The
government has said it won’t need IMF cash, only a standby loan
program.  To contact the reporter on this story:
