Gold probably will stay above $1,630
an ounce in the next several months and may rally to at least
$1,800 before starting a decline in the second half of this
year, according to  technical analysis  by Societe Generale SA.  The $1,630 area consists of the highs reached last summer,
support levels from a declining trend channel since October and
a rising support line since May, the bank said. If prices climb
above the $1,703-$1,706 area, they’ll probably rally and peak
between $1,800 and $1,921 in the second half, before starting a
gradual decline to as low as $1,500 by next year, it predicts.  Bullion rose a 12th straight year in 2012, the best run in
at least nine decades, as central banks from  Europe  to  China 
pledged more stimulus to bolster economic growth. While gold
failed to set a new all-time high last year for the first time
since 2007, investors are holding a near-record amount in
exchange-traded products. Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Credit
Suisse Group AG are among banks that say prices will probably
peak this year as economies improve.  “All the technical indicators are not calling for a big
correction yet,” said Stephanie Aymes, a technical analyst at
 Societe Generale  in London. “The trend is starting to become
mature. There should be a final rise, and in this final rise
that will attract fresh sellers.”  Bullion for immediate delivery fell 0.8 percent to
$1,661.34 an ounce in London this year, after adding 7.1 percent
in 2012, the smallest gain in four years. The metal set a record
$1,921.15 in September 2011 and traded as high as $1,796.05 last
year. ETP holdings at 2,610 metric tons are about 0.8 percent
below the Dec. 20 all-time high, data compiled by Bloomberg
show.  Bearish Channel  The $1,703-$1,706 area consists of the top of the bearish
channel since October, Aymes said. Prices peaked near $1,800 in
November 2011 and in February and October last year. Since the
end of 2011, the metal traded in a $273 range, with the mid-
point being about $1,659.  “We’ve been in a range for more than a year and now we’re
in the middle of that range,” Aymes said. Prices above $1,800
means there is a “significant risk of a plummet,” she said.  In technical analysis, investors and analysts study charts
of trading patterns and prices to predict changes in a security,
commodity, currency or index. Common indicators analyzed range
from moving averages to Fibonacci levels to Ichimoku charts, as
well as previous highs and lows and trend channels.  Gold generally only earns returns for investors through
price gains. The  Bank of Japan (8301)  said Jan. 22 it will buy about 13
trillion yen ($143 billion) in assets per month from January
2014. Federal Reserve minutes released Jan. 3 showed some policy
makers favored ending $85 billion in monthly bond purchases this
year. The  U.S. economy  will accelerate from the second quarter
through the start of 2014, economists’ forecasts compiled by
Bloomberg show.  Goldman Outlook  Goldman said Jan. 18 that it expects gold to climb to
$1,825 in the next three months, while restating a forecast for
prices to peak this year and be weaker in the second half.
Credit Suisse expects the metal will average a record $1,740
this year, before declining in 2014.  The drop of as much as 9.5 percent in the three months
through Jan. 4 pushed gold below its 200-day moving average last
month for the first time since August. Prices slid about 10
percent in seven weeks after falling below the measure in March.
They swung above and below the average since December, and are
now about $2 below it.  “Moving averages help investors profit during trending
markets because they have a trend to follow,” said Jim Stellakis, founder of research company Technical Alpha Inc. in
Greenwich,  Connecticut  and a chartered market technician. “In
sideways markets they are useless. In just the past month, gold
has round-tripped the widely-followed moving average four
times.”  Moving Average  The metal closed below the 200-day moving average on Jan.
25. That scenario would increase the likelihood of further
declines toward the 2012-13 support line at about $1,632 and the
January low of about $1,626, Commerzbank AG analysts wrote in a
Jan. 23 report. Staying above that area would be “key” for the
medium-term trend, and a drop lower means prices could slide
below $1,600, it said.  A gain above the downtrend channel resistance level of
about $1,703 means prices could reach the mid-December high of
about $1,723 and then $1,731, Commerzbank said. That’s the 61.8
percent retracement of the October-to-January decline, a level
singled out in so-called Fibonacci analysis.  Fibonacci analysis is based on the theory that prices rise
or fall by certain percentages after reaching a high or low.  To contact the reporter for this story:
