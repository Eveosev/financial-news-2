Akbank TAS (AKBNK) , the Turkish lender part-
owned by Citigroup Inc., is selling the country’s first lira-
denominated bonds to foreign investors, according to a person
with knowledge of the deal.  The lender is offering five-year debt to investors abroad
at a yield about 7.60 percent, said the person, who asked not to
be identified because the information isn’t public yet. Akbank
hired Bank of America Merrill Lynch, Deutsche Bank AG,
Citigroup, HSBC Holdings Plc and JPMorgan Chase & Co. for the
sale, the person said.  The benchmark-sized bonds will be sold tomorrow after the
end of a roadshow today, according to the person. Akbank applied
to  Turkey ’s market regulators in December for a sale of as much
as $1 billion of notes in dollars, foreign currency or liras.  The sale announcement comes as Central Bank Governor Erdem Basci’s variable interest rates policy has succeeded in making
the Turkish lira the least volatile among eight major currencies
in emerging  Europe , the Middle East and Africa, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. That’s boosted appetite for lira
debt and helped Turkey win its first investment-grade rating in
18 years when  Fitch Ratings  upgraded the country in November.  To contact the reporter on this story:
