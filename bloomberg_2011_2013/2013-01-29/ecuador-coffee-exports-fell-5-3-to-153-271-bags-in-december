Coffee exports from  Ecuador , South
Americaâ€™s second-biggest producer of Robusta beans, dropped 5.3
percent to 153,271 bags in December from the year earlier, the
National Coffee Council said today.  The shipments declined from 161,862 bags in December 2011,
the council, known as Cofenac, said today in an e-mailed
response to questions from  Bloomberg News . A bag weighs 60
kilograms, or 132 pounds.  Ecuador exported 132,387 bags in November, less than the
138,991 bags shipped in the same month a year earlier, according
to the council.  To contact the reporter on this story:
