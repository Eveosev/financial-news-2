Japan ’s Ministry of Economy, Trade
and Industry will more than double the budget for developing
clean energy in the year starting April 1 to boost renewables.  Of a total 97.7 billion yen ($1 billion), 25 billion yen
will go toward power grids including a network in Hokkaido,
northern Japan, to spur wind power, according to a summary of
the budget distributed to reporters. The Cabinet today approved
the first cut in total  government spending  in seven years. The
budget needs to be approved by the Diet, Japan’s parliament.  METI will spend 14.5 billion yen on developing wind power,
including a floating project being developed offshore Fukushima,
where a 2011 earthquake and tsunami caused a nuclear meltdown.  It will spend 4.4 billion yen to develop large batteries to
store power and help match volatile energy generation from wind
and solar sources to demand from consumers. The clean energy
budget in the year ending March 31 was 43.5 billion yen.  To contact the reporter on this story:
