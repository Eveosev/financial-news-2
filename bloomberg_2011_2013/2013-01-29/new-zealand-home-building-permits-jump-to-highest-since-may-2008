New Zealand  building approvals
surged to a 4 1/2 year high in December led by apartments and
retirement village units as well as more consents in the
earthquake-devastated Canterbury region.  Permits for dwellings rose 9.4 percent from November to
1,566, the most since May 2008, Statistics New Zealand said in
Wellington. Excluding apartments and units, they fell 1 percent.  A rise in planned construction adds to signs of a revival
in the  property market , led by low  interest rates  and rebuilding
in Christchurch city and the surrounding Canterbury district
after earthquakes in 2010 and 2011. Central bank Governor Graeme Wheeler will probably leave the official cash rate unchanged at
a record-low 2.5 percent tomorrow.  “There are emerging trends that are beginning to argue for
less in the way of cash rate stimulus,”  Craig Ebert , senior
economist at Bank of New Zealand Ltd., said in a Jan. 28 note.
“There is accumulating evidence of a construction rebound.”  Economists expected a 6 percent gain, according to the
median of five forecasts in a Bloomberg News survey. New
Zealand’s dollar was little changed after the report, buying
83.92 U.S. cents at 10:48 a.m. in Wellington.  Approvals in the three months through December rose 7.5
percent from the July-September period, today’s report showed.
Excluding apartments, approvals rose 10 percent.  New Zealand’s effective home-lending rate in November was
the lowest since records began in 1998, according to the  Reserve
Bank  of New Zealand. The central bank has kept the official cash
rate at 2.5 percent since March 2011. Seven of 16 economists
surveyed by  Bloomberg News  forecast Wheeler will raise borrowing
costs this year.  Approvals rose 24 percent in 2012 from 2011 to a four-year
high, the statistics agency said, citing unadjusted figures.
Consents in Canterbury surged 69 percent and Auckland permits
jumped 21 percent, it said.  Editors: Chris Bourke, Michael Heath  To contact the reporter on this story:
