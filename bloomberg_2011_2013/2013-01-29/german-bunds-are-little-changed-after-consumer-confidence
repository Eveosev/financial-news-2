Italy’s two-year notes rose for the
first time in five days as the nation’s borrowing costs dropped
to the lowest in almost three years at a sale of 8.5 billion
euros ($11.4 billion) of debt due in six months.  Ten-year Italian yields also fell before a sale of as much
as 6.5 billion euros of the debt and five-year notes tomorrow.
Italy sold 4.75 percent bonds due in September 2028 on Jan. 16
through banks. Austria’s two-year notes rose as Standard &
Poor’s lifted the outlook on the country’s credit rating.
Financial institutions borrowed 124.1 billion euros for seven
days in the  European Central Bank ’s main refinancing operation
today, down from 125.3 billion euros last week.  “There is a positive stance from investors towards Italian
debt,” said Alessandro Giansanti, a senior rates strategist at
ING Groep NV in Amsterdam. “I expect tomorrow’s sale will go
fine on the back of the successful 15-year auction this month.”  Italian two-year  yields  fell five basis points, or 0.05
percentage point, to 1.51 percent at 4:23 p.m.  London  time. The
6 percent note maturing November 2014 rose 0.08, or 80 euro
cents per 1,000-euro face amount, to 107.87. Yields on similar-
maturity Spanish debt fell six basis points to 2.48 percent.  The ECB’s pledge to buy bonds is providing an effective
backstop even amid rising political concern before Italians go
to the polls to elect their next premier on Feb. 24-25.  The Treasury in  Rome  today sold 181-day bills at 0.731
percent, the lowest since March 26, 2010 and down from 0.949
percent at the previous auction of similar-maturity debt Dec.
27. At today’s auction, investors bid for 1.65 times the amount
of securities allotted, up from 1.57 times last month.  Austria Outlook  Standard & Poor’s  raised its outlook on Austria’s credit
rating to stable from negative, saying it sees the country
sticking to debt-cutting plans and banks bolstering their weak
capital basis.  The outlook for the Alpine republic’s AA+ rating was lifted
as its economy is expected to remain resilient to the negative
impact of Europe’s debt turmoil, S&P said in a statement today.
Austria was stripped of its top rating a year ago.  Two-year Austrian  yields  fell three basis points to 0.30
percent. German two-year yields fell two basis points to 0.28
percent.  A total of 278 banks will return 137.2 billion euros
tomorrow, the first opportunity for early repayment of the
initial three-year loans under the credit-boosting Longer-Term
Refinancing Operations, the Frankfurt-based ECB said last week.
That’s more than the 84 billion euros economists predicted in a
Bloomberg News survey.  ‘Front-end Selloff’  “The front-end selloff had been quite aggressive,” said
Mohit Kumar, head of  Europe  and U.K. rates strategy at Deutsche
Bank AG in London, referring to shorter-dated maturities.
“Before today’s move, it was pricing in about 500 billion euros
of repayments from the LTRO and that seemed a bit aggressive.”  Volatility on Portuguese bonds was the highest in euro-area
markets today, followed by those of the Netherlands and  Belgium ,
according to measures of 10-year or similar-maturity debt, the
yield spread between two- and 10-year securities, and credit-
default swaps.  German securities have handed investors a gain of 1.9
percent this month through yesterday, according to indexes
compiled by Bloomberg and the European Federation of Financial
Analysts Societies. German bunds dropped 2 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
