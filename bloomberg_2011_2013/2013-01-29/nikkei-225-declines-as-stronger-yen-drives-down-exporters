Japanese  shares  gained, with the
 Topix (TPX)  Index closing at its highest level since the 2011
earthquake, on optimism about corporate earnings.  Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group Inc. (8316) ,  Japan ’s second-
biggest bank by market value, increased 4.4 percent after the
Nikkei newspaper said the lender’s net profit may reach a
record. KDDI Corp. rose 2.8 percent after the mobile operator
raised its operating-profit forecast and announced a stock
split. Sony Corp., the maker of the PlayStation 3, dropped 1.6
percent after the Oriental Morning Post said  China ’s culture
ministry denied a report it will lift a ban on game consoles.  The Topix, the country’s broadest equity measure, climbed
0.8 percent to 920.76 in  Tokyo , its highest close since March
10, 2011, the day before a record earthquake triggered a tsunami
and the worst nuclear crisis in 25 years. The  Nikkei 225  Stock
Average added 0.4 percent to 10,866.72.  “As investor sentiment is generally positive, they are
quick to buy on good news, such as earnings,” said  Naoki Fujiwara , chief  fund manager  at Shinkin Asset Management Co.,
which oversees about 498 billion yen $5.5 billion. “The market
is likely to keep following the movements of the yen, and there
may be some investors who are looking to take profits.”  The Topix rose 26 percent from Nov. 14, when elections were
announced, through yesterday on optimism Prime Minister Shinzo
Abe’s new government will take the necessary steps to fight
deflation. The gauge is trading at 1.08 times  book value ,
compared with 2.07 for the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index and 1.5
for the Stoxx Europe 600 Index.  Lenders Surge  Banks provided the  biggest support  to the Topix.  Sumitomo
Mitsui  Financial jumped 4.4 percent to 3,450 yen, its highest
close since Oct. 2009. Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group Inc.,
Japan’s biggest lender, gained 3.8 percent to 497 yen. Mizuho
Financial Group Inc., the third-largest bank, advanced 2.9
percent to 175 yen.  Sumitomo Mitsui Financial and Mitsubishi UFJ Financial are
each likely to report more than 500 billion yen in nine-month
net income, the Nikkei reported, citing the rising value of the
lenders’ stock holdings. Mizuho Financial may report profit of
400 billion yen, the report said, without saying where it got
the information.  Goldman Sachs raised its outlook for financial shares,
saying they will rise an average 16 percent in the next 12
months as earnings are lifted by a weaker yen and gains by
equity holdings, analysts Katsunori Tanaka and Taichi Noda wrote
in a report today. They named Sumitomo Mitsui as their top pick
among the banks, while reiterating their attractive rating on
the three-biggest Japanese lenders.  KDDI Lifts Forecast  KDDI (9433)  rose 2.8 percent to 6,530 yen, its highest close since
August 2008. The mobile operator increased its operating profit
forecast to 505 billion yen and said it would conduct a 2-for-1
stock split on April 1.  Among shares that fell, Sony dropped 1.6 percent to 1,385,
paring yesterday’s 9.1 percent surge. Nintendo Co., the maker of
the Wii console, lost 0.5 percent after gaining 3.4 percent
yesterday.  China’s culture ministry denied a China Daily report
yesterday that the country would lift a 12-year ban on the sale
of video-game consoles, according to the Oriental Morning Post
which cited an unidentified person from the ministry.  Futures on the  S&P 500  climbed 0.2 percent today. The
measure slid 0.2 percent yesterday as a decline in pending home
sales outweighed a gain in durable-goods orders. The gauge
closed at its highest level since October 2007 on Jan. 25 after
capping its longest daily win streak since 2004.  Volume on the Nikkei 225 was about 11 percent above its 30-
day average for the time of day. The  Nikkei Stock Average
Volatility Index (VNKY)  fell 4.7 percent to 22.70, indicating traders
expect a swing of about 6.5 percent on the benchmark gauge over
the next 30 days.  To contact the reporter on this story:
