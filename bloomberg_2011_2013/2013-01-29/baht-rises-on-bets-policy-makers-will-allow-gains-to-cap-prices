Thailand’s baht rose by the most in
two weeks on speculation policy makers will tolerate currency
gains to counter inflation. Government bonds were steady.  Finance Minister Kittiratt Na-Ranong said last week the
central bank should avoid fighting market forces to stem baht
appreciation. International investors bought $3.7 billion more
local sovereign debt than they sold this month through yesterday
and poured a net $487 million into equities, official data show.
Inflation accelerated to 3.63 percent in December, the fastest
in 13 months, government figures showed Jan. 2.  “The baht has received support from the perception that
Thai authorities are more amenable to currency appreciation,”
said Sacha Tihanyi, senior foreign-exchange strategist at
Scotiabank in Hong Kong. “This has helped encourage portfolio
flows. Domestic economic conditions may cause price pressures,
while baht gains can help contain imported inflation.”  The baht climbed 0.4 percent, the biggest gain since Jan.
16, to 29.85 per dollar as of 8:23 a.m. in Bangkok, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. It has advanced 2.5 percent this
year, the most among Asia’s 11 major currencies.  One-month implied volatility, a measure of expected moves
in exchange rates used to price options, fell three basis
points, or 0.03 percentage point, to 5.42 percent.  The yield on the 3.125 percent government bonds due
December 2015 was little changed at 2.94 percent, data compiled
by Bloomberg show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
