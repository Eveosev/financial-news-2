Serbian support for European Union
membership fell to the lowest level since the Balkan nation
began to measure the sentiment in 2002, the Belgrade newspaper
 Danas  said.  The support fell 8 percentage points between June and
December 2012 to 41 percent, Danas cited a survey conducted in
December, which the Serbian  Office for European Integrations 
will present later this week.  To contact the reporter on this story:
