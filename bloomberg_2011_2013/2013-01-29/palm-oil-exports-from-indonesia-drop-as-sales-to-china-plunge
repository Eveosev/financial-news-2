Palm oil  shipments from  Indonesia ,
the world’s largest producer, fell for the first time in three
months in December as demand from China and  Europe  tumbled, a
growers’ group said.  Exports, including palm and kernel oils, dropped 4 percent
to 1.9 million metric tons last month from 1.98 million tons in
November, according to data from the Indonesian Palm Oil
Association today. That compares with the median estimate of
1.55 million tons in a Bloomberg survey last month and 1.51
million tons shipped in December 2011.  Declining exports may increase inventories and accelerate a
20 percent drop in futures in Kuala Lumpur in the past year.
Shipments may extend the decline to 1.54 million tons this month
and stockpiles may gain to 3.5 million tons from 3.25 million
tons in December, according to the median of estimates from two
plantation companies, a refiner and an analyst compiled by
Bloomberg.  “It’s a slowdown in trade” due to December holidays,
Joelianto, a Jakarta-based trader at PT Sinar Mas Agro Resources
and Technology, said in mobile-phone text message.  Exports to  China  plunged 40 percent to 210,260 tons and
sales to the European Union countries dropped 39 percent to
361,030 tons, according to data from the growers group known as
Gapki. Shipments to  India , the world’s largest buyer, jumped 26
percent to 670,820 tons in December from a month earlier.  Exports of palm oil and its by-products represented about
93 percent of the month’s total shipments, or 1.77 million tons,
Gapki data showed. The drop in December exports was the first
decline since September, the data showed.  Tax Increase  Indonesia will raise taxes on crude palm oil exports to 9
percent for February from 7.5 percent in January, the Trade
Ministry said yesterday. That may help  Malaysia , which will
maintain a zero-tariff policy for a second month in February to
help clear record stockpiles, boost exports, said Ryan Long,
vice president of futures and options at OSK Investment Bank
Bhd. in  Kuala Lumpur .  The contract for delivery in April advanced 1.4 percent to
2,478 ringgit ($805) per ton on the Malaysia Derivatives
Exchange at 4:32 p.m. in Kuala Lumpur. The most-active contract
is set for a 1.7 percent gain this month.  Indonesia exported 18.2 million tons of palm oil last year,
a 3.4 percent increase from a year earlier, Gapki data showed.
Shipments from the country may climb to a record 20 million tons
this year, the group said Jan. 8. Output may expand 5.7 percent
to 28 million tons, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
