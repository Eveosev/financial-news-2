Stefan Kudelski, the inventor of the
first portable professional sound recorder, died. He was 84.  Kudelski created the Nagra in 1951, and the invention was
used by the radio, movie and television industries, the
Cheseaux, Switzerland-based  Kudelski Group (KUD)  said in a statement
yesterday. He began his career by selling the device to Radio
Luxembourg,  Italy ’s RAI and the British Broadcasting Corp., as
well as ABC, NBC and CBS in the U.S., according to the Nagra
Audio  website .  “Stefan Kudelski was one of those personalities who
contributed to the international reputation of Switzerland,”
Vice Chairman Claude Smadja said in the statement. “Anyone who
knew him could only be impressed by his sharpness, his
incredible culture, his curiosity and his permanent sense of
humor.” He died on Jan. 26, the company said.  The Kudelski Group spun the Nagra audio unit off in January
2012 and now focuses on technology for digital television. It
also owns a unit that makes access systems for parking lots and
ski resorts.  Kudelski was born in Warsaw on Feb. 27, 1929, and his
family fled  Poland  in 1939 as World War II started. The
Kudelskis fled to Hungary and  France  before arriving in
Switzerland in 1943.  Stefan Kudelski’s son Andre is chairman and chief executive
officer of Kudelski Group, having taken over from his father in
1991. Marguerite Kudelski, the daughter of the inventor, is also
on the company’s board.  To contact the reporter on this story:
