U.K. currency-trading volumes fell
to an average $1.92 trillion a day in October, 5 percent lower
than six months earlier, the  Bank of England  said today, citing
its twice-a-year  surveys .  Average trading volumes in the U.S. and  Canada  also
declined in October from six months earlier, while those in
Japan increased, separate surveys from foreign-exchange
committees in these countries showed. The euro strengthened
against all except two of its 16 major counterparts in October
as the region’s sovereign-debt crisis eased.  The proportion of foreign-exchange trades in the U.K.
involving the dollar as one of the currencies rose to 87.6
percent in October from 86.6 in April, the Bank of England’s
survey showed. Those including the euro fell to 41.7 percent
from 43.4 percent, and those with the pound dropped to 16.6
percent to 17.2 percent.  Thirty banks participated in the October survey, which was
carried out for the Foreign Exchange Joint Standing Committee,
the Bank of England said.  Average trading volumes in the  U.S.  declined to $794
billion a day in October from $860 billion in the previous
survey in April, the Federal Reserve Bank of  New York  said.  Currency transactions executed by traders in Canada dropped
14 percent to $51 billion in October from April, according to
the Canadian Foreign Exchange Committee. Volumes in  Tokyo 
climbed 6.3 percent to $301 billion in October versus six months
earlier, Japan’s Foreign Exchange Market Committee said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
