The Algerian and Tunisian
governments announced plans to boost security at oil and gas
installations following the attack earlier this month on
Algeria’s In Amenas facility that left dozens dead.  Tunisia has deployed military units along its desert
borders with Algeria and  Libya , the official TAP news agency
reported today, citing unidentified security officials.  Abdelhamid Zerguine, chief executive officer of Algeria’s
state-run Sonatrach, said security measures will be revised in
collaboration with the security services, in an interview today
with national radio. Sonatrach jointly operates An Amenas with
London-based  BP Plc (BP/)  and  Statoil ASA (STL)  of Norway. The four-day
siege at the plant left at least 38 foreigners dead.  Libya last week announced its own plans to reinforce
security at oil and gas installations near its southern border.
Measures include sending extra forces to the area and the
construction of security perimeters around sites.  To contact the reporters on this story:
