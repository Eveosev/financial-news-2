Russia may model its financial
district after London’s  Canary Wharf  and  Deutsche Boerse (DB1)  by
basing the planned hub outside central Moscow and luring
foreigners with tax incentives, government officials said.  Foreign companies may get tax breaks and office space at
low rents if they move to the area selected by the government,
Prime Minister  Dmitry Medvedev ’s spokeswoman, Natalya Timakova,
told reporters outside Moscow today. The Cabinet hasn’t decided
on the location.  Medvedev, who served as head of state from 2008 to 2012
after Vladimir Putin completed the maximum two consecutive terms
allowed by the constitution, has courted heads of Western banks
on transforming Moscow into a global financial center. Russia
yesterday hired Goldman Sachs Group Inc. to boost its image with
investors abroad.  The government needs to outline plans to offer interested
companies and investors a “set of carrots” to encourage them
to relocate,  Alexander Voloshin , the head of the government
working group overseeing the creation of a financial center,
said at the  meeting . Medvedev said another working group will be
formed to oversee development of the hub’s infrastructure.  Putin, who’s been either prime minister or president for
more than 13 years, ordered the government last year to improve
Russia’s standing in the World Bank’s Doing Business rating to
20th by 2018.  To contact the reporter on this story:
