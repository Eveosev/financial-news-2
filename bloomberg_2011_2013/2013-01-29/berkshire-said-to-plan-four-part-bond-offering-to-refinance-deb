Warren Buffett ’s  Berkshire Hathaway
Inc. (BRK/A)  sold $2.6 billion of bonds in four parts to pay down debt
due next month.  Berkshire, which its 82-year-old chairman built into a $241
billion  company  in market value with takeovers and stock picks,
issued $300 million of 0.8 percent, three-year debt to yield
37.5 basis points more than similar-maturity Treasuries and $800
million of 1.55 percent, five-year notes to yield 70 basis
points more than benchmarks.  The company also sold $500 million of 3 percent, 10-year
securities at a spread of 110 basis points and $1 billion of 4.5
percent 30-year debt at 140 basis points, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  Proceeds from the deal will repay $1.2 billion of floating-
rate notes and $1.4 billion of 2.125 percent fixed-rate
securities, both due Feb. 11, according to a person with
knowledge of the transaction, who asked not to be identified
because terms weren’t set.  Berkshire, which has $5.6 billion of debentures  maturing 
this year, last issued new bonds in May, selling $1.6 billion of
debt in three parts with a record low five-year coupon. Its 1.6
percent securities due in May 2017, which were increased to
$1.35 billion from the initial $750 million, traded at 102.7
cents on the dollar to yield 0.95 percent Jan. 25, according to
Trace, the bond-price reporting system of the Financial Industry
Regulatory Authority.  The new debt may be rated Aa2 by Moody’s Investors Service,
the person said. Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and  Wells Fargo & Co .
managed the sale for the Omaha, Nebraska-based company.  To contact the reporter on this story:
