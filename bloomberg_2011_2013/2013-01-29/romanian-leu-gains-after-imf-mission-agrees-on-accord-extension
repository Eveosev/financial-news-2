The Romanian leu gained for the
first time in three days after an International Monetary Fund
mission extended a review of the country’s loan accord by three
months to allow time for the government to complete asset sales.  The currency appreciated 0.5 percent to 4.3735 per euro by
5 p.m. in Bucharest. Yields on  Romania ’s euro-denominated bonds
due 2019 fell three basis points, or 0.03 percentage point, to
3.84 percent.  The IMF extended a review of Romania’s 5 billion-euro ($6.7
billion) precautionary pact until the end of June after Prime
Minister Victor Ponta asked for more time to complete asset
sales, Mission Chief Erik de Vrijer said in Bucharest today. The
IMF board will meet in June to decide on Romania’s progress
under the accord.  “The messages were in a positive tone,” Florentina Cozmanca, a Bucharest-based economist at Royal Bank of Scotland
Group Plc, said in an e-mail today.  The leu has appreciated 1.7 percent against the euro this
year, the best performance among emerging currencies in  Europe ,
the  Middle East  and  Africa  tracked by Bloomberg.  The Banca Nationala a Romaniei raised a cap on funding for
commercial banks via weekly  repurchase agreements  to 9 billion
lei ($2.8 billion) yesterday, from 6 billion lei a week earlier.
The central bank has restricted leu sales at its repo auctions
since October to help prop up the currency.  To contact the reporters on this story:
