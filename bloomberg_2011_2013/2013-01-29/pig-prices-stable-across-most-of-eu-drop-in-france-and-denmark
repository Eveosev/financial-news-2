Pig prices were stable in Germany
and  Spain , the European Union’s largest pork suppliers, and fell
in France, according to industry group Interessengemeinschaft
der Schweinehalter Deutschlands e.V.  Hog prices in Germany, the bloc’s biggest producer, were
unchanged for a second week at 1.596 euros ($2.15) a kilogram
(2.2 pounds), Damme, Germany-based ISN wrote in a  report  on its
website today. In Spain, the price was unchanged for a fourth
week at 1.725 euros a kilogram.  EU consumers eat more pork than any other meat. Per-capita
consumption of pork in the 27-nation bloc is set to fall to
40.26 kilograms this year from 41.15 kilograms in 2012 due to
the economic downturn and high levels of unemployment, the EU
forecast this month.  “The market for slaughter-ready pigs in the center and
south of the EU is increasingly stabilizing,” ISN wrote. In
 Germany , “the offer of slaughter-ready pigs is decreasing and
resulting in a further stabilization of the market,” it said.  Dutch, Belgian, Austrian and Italian pig prices were also
unchanged. French prices fell to 1.568 euros a kilogram from
1.58 euros, while in Denmark the price of a kilogram of pork
slipped to 1.629 euros from 1.657 euros.  To contact the reporter on this story:
