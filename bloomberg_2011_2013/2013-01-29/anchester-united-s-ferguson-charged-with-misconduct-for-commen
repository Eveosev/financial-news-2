Manchester United manager  Alex
Ferguson  was charged with misconduct by England’s Football
Association after implying a match official was motivated by
bias in a soccer game against Tottenham.  Referee Chris Foy didn’t award a penalty to United, the
league leaders, when  Wayne Rooney  felt he was fouled in the Jan.
20 game, which finished 1-1 when Spurs scored late. The manager
criticized linesman Simon Beck in post-match comments, saying
he’d failed to make rulings that support United in several
games.  The F.A. today charged Ferguson, who has until Feb. 1 to
respond, the governing body said today in an e-mailed statement.
The coach could face a fine or a ban.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
