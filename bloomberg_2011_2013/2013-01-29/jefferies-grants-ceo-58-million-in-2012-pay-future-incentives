Jefferies Group Inc. (JEF) , the investment bank that agreed to sell itself to  Leucadia National Corp. (LUK) , paid Chief Executive Officer  Richard Handler  $19 million for fiscal 2012 and approved $39 million in restricted stock awards for the next three years.  Jefferies boosted Handler’s annual pay 36 percent for the year ending Nov. 30, with a package that includes a $5 million cash bonus, $13 million in stock and a $1 million salary, according to a regulatory filing by the New York-based firm today. The three-year plan is similar to an incentive program enacted in 2010, maintaining annual payouts of restricted stock units at about $13 million through 2015, the filing shows.  The compensation packages -- worth $58 million combined -- follow a 48 percent jump in the company’s stock during the 12 months ended Nov. 30 as net income remained little changed at $282 million. Leucadia, Jefferies’s biggest shareholder, agreed in November to a $2.8 billion takeover that will make Handler CEO of the combined firm.  The compensation committee decided to pay Handler, 51, a bonus of $8.1 million for 2012. He volunteered for that figure to be cut by $3.1 million, according to the filing. The bonus is subject to a 100 percent forfeiture for one year.  Handler’s annual pay compares with a $21 million package awarded to  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)  CEO  Lloyd Blankfein  for 2012. Blankfein got $13.3 million in restricted stock that comprises about 70 percent of his total bonus, a person with knowledge of the matter said this month. On that basis, the total bonus is about $19 million, including $5.7 million in cash. Blankfein, 58, also receives a $2 million salary.  Friedman’s Pay  The  JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM)  board of directors cut CEO  Jamie Dimon ’s pay for 2012 to $11.5 million, according to a Jan. 16 report that gives him the “ultimate responsibility” for the bank’s biggest ever trading loss.  Brian Friedman , 57, chairman of Jefferies’s executive committee who is set to become president of the combined company, received a $14.3 million pay package for 2012. That consisted of a $750,000 base salary, a $3.75 million cash bonus and $9.75 million in long-term equity incentives.  Jefferies told employees in December it would pay year-end bonuses in immediately available cash in an attempt to distinguish itself from its larger bank-holding company rivals. The firm said it will maintain clawback policies on year-end compensation if an employee leaves for a competitor, which was a provision established in 2011.  For 2011 pay, Jefferies gave its employees the option of taking their bonuses in stock or in cash at a 25 percent discount. Handler and other executives declined fiscal 2011 bonuses after a year in which the firm faced investor scrutiny about its holdings in European debt.
