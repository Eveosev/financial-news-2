Zambia’s kwacha slid the most this
year amid speculation that foreign investment was withdrawn from
the country, making the currency the world’s worst performer.  The kwacha retreated 1.6 percent to 5.375 a dollar as of
4:01 p.m. in Lusaka, the biggest decline since Dec. 27 on a
closing basis and the weakest level since May 2009.  The depreciation was probably the result of a “big
offshore player” exiting a position in  government securities ,
Mwewa Kyamulanda, a Lusaka-based currency trader with  Investrust
Bank Plc (INVESTRU) , said by mobile phone. The kwacha will probably
strengthen if the central bank of  Africa ’s biggest copper
producer intervenes in the market, as it did yesterday, he said.  “The Bank of Zambia don’t seem to like these levels,”
Kyamulanda said.  Kanguya Mayondi, a spokesman for the central bank, wasn’t
reachable on his mobile phone and didn’t immediately respond to
an e-mail seeking comment.  The kwacha will probably strengthen to around 5.30
following an intervention, according to Kyamulanda. If the
central bank doesn’t sell some of the $2.5 billion in foreign
reserves it has access to, the local currency could retreat to
5.40, he said.  Zambia rebased its currency on Jan. 1, removing three
zeros.  To contact the reporter on this story:
