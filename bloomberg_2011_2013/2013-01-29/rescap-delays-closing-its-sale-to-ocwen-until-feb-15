Residential Capital LLC, the
mortgage company liquidating assets in bankruptcy, delayed
closing the $3 billion sale of its main business to Ocwen Loan
Servicing LLC to Feb. 15, a lawyer said today.  The extra time will allow ResCap and government-owned
mortgage investor  Freddie Mac  to complete a proposed agreement
needed to clear the last major obstacle to the sale, ResCap
lawyer Todd M. Goren said in federal court in Manhattan today.  The company expects to close on Jan. 31 the part of sale
involving Green Tree Servicing LLC, a unit of  Walter Investment (WAC) 
Management, Goren said. Ocwen and Green Tree won an auction for
ResCap’s loan servicing unit last year with a bid of $3 billion.  When the Green Tree part of the sale closes, ResCap will
repay $400 million owed on a so-called debtor-in-possession loan
the company took out to fund its bankruptcy, Goren said. The
closing will also “bring in hundreds of millions of dollars,”
Goren told U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Martin Glenn in a hearing
today.  New York-based ResCap filed bankruptcy in May to with plans
to sell its major assets and resolve legal claims related to
 mortgage loans . The company is owned by  Ally Financial Inc. (ALLY) , a
Detroit-based auto lender majority owned by U.S. taxpayers.  The $1.5 billion sale of ResCap’s main loan portfolio to
 Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (BRK/A)  should also close as planned on Jan. 31,
Goren said.  The case is In re Residential Capital LLC, 12-12020,  U.S.
Bankruptcy Court , Southern District of New York (Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
