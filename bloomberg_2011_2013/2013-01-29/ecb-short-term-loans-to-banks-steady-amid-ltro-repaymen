Euro-area banks kept short-term
borrowing from the European Central Bank steady as they prepare
to repay longer-term emergency loans.  Financial institutions took 124.1 billion euros ($167
billion) in the ECB’s  main refinancing operation  today, down
from 125.3 billion euros last week. Banks pay 0.75 percent
interest for the 7-day funds.  Some 278 financial institutions will return 137.2 billion
euros tomorrow, the first opportunity for early repayment of the
initial three-year loan, a so-called longer-term refinancing
operation, the Frankfurt-based central bank said last week.
That’s more than the 84 billion euros economists predicted in a
Bloomberg News survey.  “It seems that periphery banks are using the repayment
option for three-year loans more than we expected,” said
Juergen Michels, chief euro-area economist at Citigroup Inc. in
London. “It is possible that banks from these countries swap
part of the three-year LTRO funding into main refinancing
operations or three-month loans.”  The ECB will allot fresh three-month funds tomorrow.  To contact the reporter on this story:
