The cost of insuring corporate bonds
rose in Japan and  Australia , according to traders of credit-
default swaps.  The Markit iTraxx Japan index climbed one basis point to
135.5 basis points as of 9:08 a.m. in  Tokyo , Deutsche Bank AG
prices show. The measure is on track to rise for a second day,
according to data provider CMA.  The Markit iTraxx Australia index also advanced one basis
point to 116.5 as of 11:06 a.m. in Sydney, according to Westpac
Banking Corp. prices. The benchmark is set for the highest close
since Jan. 24, according to CMA, which is owned by McGraw-Hill
Cos. and compiles prices quoted by dealers in the privately
negotiated market.  The Markit iTraxx Asia index of 40 investment-grade
borrowers outside  Japan  was little changed at 106 as of 8:05
a.m. in Hong Kong, Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc prices show.
The gauge is down from 113.4 at the end of last year, according
to CMA.  Credit-default swap indexes are benchmarks for insuring
bonds against default and traders use them to speculate on
credit quality. A drop signals improving perceptions of
creditworthiness, while an increase suggests the opposite.  The swap contracts pay the buyer face value in exchange for
the underlying securities if a borrower fails to meet its debt
agreements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
