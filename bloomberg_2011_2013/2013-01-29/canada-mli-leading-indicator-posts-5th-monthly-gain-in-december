Canada’s MLI Leading Economic
Indicator recorded a fifth straight gain in December, as
Canadians benefited from rising stock prices and a U.S. rebound.  The index, published by the Ottawa-based Macdonald-Laurier
 Institute , rose 0.2 percent in December, the same gain as in
November. Housing was the only component recording a drop during
the month, registering a 1.9 percent decline, the institute said
in a statement.  “The gradual improvement in the leading index, from no
growth in July to diffuse gains by year-end, points to a pick-up
in economic growth as 2013 unfolds,” the institute said in a
statement.  Statistics Canada stopped publishing its composite leading
economic indicator last year as part of government spending-
reduction efforts, with the last reading, for April, being
published May 23. The MLI began to publish its own index in
October.  The increase in December was led by a 1.3 percent gain in
the country’s benchmark stock index, gains in U.S. leading
indicators and a narrowing interest-rate gap between public and
private debt.  To contact the reporter on this story:
