European Union carbon permits
dropped to a record as the bloc’s lawmakers considered whether
to support the regulator’s plan to temporarily withhold supply
through 2015 to fix a supply glut.  Carbon permits for December declined 4.6 percent to close
at 3.99 euros ($5.38) a metric ton, according to data from the
ICE Futures Europe exchange in London. Certified Emission
Reduction credits for December fell 1 cent to close at 36 euro
cents a ton.  Finland today backed the European Commission’s rescue plan
for the market as Denmark said the situation was unsustainable,
highlighting the need for governments to tackle the record
surplus of allowances. The U.K. last week set conditions for
supporting the measure and some nations don’t have a formal
stance on the plan yet. EU Climate Commissioner  Connie Hedegaard 
said Jan. 24 the alternative to the single market was as many as
27 different systems and taxes.  “It is clear that any alternatives to a community-wide
market, like a return to the patchwork of national policies
foreshadowed by Hedegaard if backloading fails or the U.K.’s
possible exit from the EU, are highly improbable,” Daniel Rossetto, managing director of Climate Mundial Ltd. in London,
which advises in emission markets, said today by e-mail. “A
viable solution for reforming the EU emissions trading system
and dealing with the EU allowance glut has yet to emerge, but is
surely on its way.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
