MetLife Inc. (MET)  said it is negotiating
to buy AFP Provida SA, Chile’s largest private pension fund
administrator, from  Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria SA (BBVA)  as the
insurer seeks to add fee income outside the U.S.  MetLife, the largest U.S. life insurer, disclosed the
discussion after majority owner BBVA said in a  statement  it was
in advanced talks with the company over a possible deal,
following reports in the media. Provida has a market value of
about $2.4 billion.  MetLife Chief Executive Officer Steven Kandarian is
expanding outside the U.S. as low interest rates and slow
economic growth weigh on results at the New York-based company.
Kandarian has set a goal of generating at least 20 percent of
operating earnings from  emerging markets  like Chile by 2016 as
he targets return on equity of 12 percent or more.  “No agreement has been reached and there are no assurances
that an agreement will be reached,” MetLife said in a
statement, which didn’t disclose potential pricing.  BBVA has sought buyers for its pension-fund assets in
Chile, Mexico, Peru and Colombia as it attempts to recover from
Spain’s real estate slump. The Bilbao, Spain-based company
agreed in November to sell the Mexican operation to a group of
local buyers for $1.6 billion.  MetLife purchased American Life Insurance Co. for about $16
billion from  American International Group Inc. (AIG)  in 2010 to expand
beyond the U.S. The unit had about 12,500 employees and
operations in more than 50 countries at the time.  To contact the reporter on this story:
