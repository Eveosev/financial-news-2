Crude oil options volatility fell
while the underlying futures climbed to a four-month high.  Implied volatility for at-the-money options expiring in
March, a measure of expected price swings in futures and a gauge
of options prices, was 19.56 percent at 5:10 p.m. on the  New
York Mercantile Exchange , down from 19.82 yesterday.  Crude oil for March delivery rose $1.13 to $97.57 a barrel
on the Nymex, the highest settlement since Sept. 14, after the
S&P/Case-Shiller  index of property values  in 20 U.S. cities
climbed the most in more than six years.  Home prices  increased 5.5 percent in November from the
year-earlier period, the biggest year-over-year gain since
August 2006. A  median  gain of 5.6 percent was projected by 30
economists surveyed by Bloomberg. The index is based on a three-
month average, which means the November data were influenced by
transactions in October and September.  The most active options in electronic trading today were
March $100 calls, which gained 16 cents to 55 cents a barrel on
volume of 3,582 contracts. The second-most active, with 2,747
lots exchanged, were April $100 calls, which advanced 32 cents
to $1.75 a barrel.  Bets that prices would fall, or puts, accounted for 52
percent of electronic trading volume.  The exchange distributes real-time data for electronic
trading and releases information the next business day on open-
outcry volume, where the bulk of options activity occurs.  In the previous session, puts accounted for 50 percent of
volume.  June $120 calls were the most active options yesterday,
with 6,116 contracts trading as they rose 3 cents to 27 cents a
barrel. April $80 puts slipped 3 cents to 18 cents a barrel on
4,279 lots.  Open interest was highest for March $110 calls with 40,633
contracts. Next were March $85 puts at 32,447 and March $90 puts
at 28,659.  To contact the reporter on this story:
