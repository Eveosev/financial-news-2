Turkiye Halk Bankasi AS (HALKB) , Turkey’s
biggest listed state lender, is selling its first dollar bonds
in six months, according to a person with knowledge of the deal.  The lender is issuing $750 million of seven-year dollar
bonds at a yield 255 basis points above the benchmark mid-swap
rate, said the person, who asked not to be identified because
the information isn’t public yet. The initial spread guidance
today was 270 basis points, or 2.7 percentage points.  The Turkish lender has hired  Commerzbank AG (CBK) , Goldman Sachs
Group Inc., JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Standard Chartered Plc to
arrange investor meetings in  Europe  and the U.S. for selling a
total of $2 billion of bonds in various maturities, the lender
said in a statement to Istanbul stock exchange on Jan. 23.  “The new issue offers value at current spread,” Neslihan Yilmaz, a trader at Maxis Securities, the London-based unit of
 Turkiye Is Bankasi (ISCTR) , said in an e-mailed note. “The yield on the
bond is good.”  The rate on Halkbank’s planned seven-year dollar bond
corresponds to a 4.04 percent yield, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg. Similar notes from  Turkiye Garanti Bankasi AS (GARAN) ,
Turkey’s biggest private lender, yield 3.86 percent.  Halkbank’s dollar bonds due 2017 sold in July at a yield of
4.875 percent traded at 3.38 percent by 6:42 p.m. in Istanbul.
Moody’s Investors Service left Turkey’s credit rating unchanged
at Ba1 yesterday, one step below investment grade, citing risks
to the country’s current-account deficit as one of the factors
influencing its decision.  The lira gained 0.3 percent to 1.7680 per dollar, after
weakening as much as 0.4 percent yesterday.  Turkey ’s ISE
National 100 Index dropped 4.2 percent yesterday, the steepest
plunge since Sept. 2011. The benchmark gauge rose 1.3 percent
today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
