Corning Inc. (GLW) , the maker of glass for
flat-panel televisions, phones and tablets, rose as much as 6.1
percent in premarket trading after fourth-quarter profit and
sales exceeded analysts’ estimates.  The Corning, New York-based company posted earnings of 34
cents a share last quarter, excluding some items. Sales climbed
14 percent to $2.15 billion. Analysts had projected earnings of
32 cents and revenue of $2.06 billion on average, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  Corning’s Gorilla Glass, the damage-resistant material used
in smartphones and tablets, topped $1 billion in sales last year
for the first time. Larger televisions also have helped improve
the company’s performance after a slump in liquid-crystal-
display prices.  “It’s a strong sign that’s we’re beginning to come to the
end of these LCD price declines, which we believe will be
moderate all year,” Chief Financial Officer Jim Flaws said in
an interview. “We’re seeing the large-size televisions grow
very nicely.”  The stock climbed as high as $12.89 in early trading. The
shares had dropped 2.8 percent last year.  Corning still faces shrinking profit margins amid a
competitive market and sluggish economy. Its gross margin was 42
percent last quarter, compared with 44 percent a year earlier.  To contact the reporter on this story:
