CTC Media Inc. (CTCM) , the Russian
television company posting its best ever start to a year, is
narrowing its discount to emerging-market media peers as  new
programs  cement gains in audience share.  Shares of CTC jumped 2.3 percent to $10.5 yesterday in New
York, bringing the TV channel owner’s surge this year to 35
percent, the biggest gain among the 14 most-traded Russian
stocks in the U.S. CTC traded for 11.19 times estimated
earnings, 51 percent below the MSCI  Emerging Markets  Media
index’s valuation and the narrowest gap since May 29. The
 Bloomberg Russia-US Equity Index (RUS14BN)  rose 0.1 percent to 104.89,
while RTS stock index  futures  gained 0.3 percent to 162,940.  CTC TV regained its position as Russia’s fourth most-
watched channel in the week to Jan. 20 for the first time since
March as the Moscow-based company debuted new programming aimed
at younger viewers including ‘Boarding School,’ ‘The Eighties’
and ‘Kitchen.’ The Nasdaq-traded stock has broken a key level of
$9.63 and may climb another 15 percent, Trading Central SA said,
citing technical indicators.  “CTC Media’s discount is unjustified and should shrink
further,” Sergey Libin, an analyst at ZAO Raiffeisen Bank who
rates CTC buy, said by phone from Moscow yesterday. “We’re
seeing a turnaround in terms of how their new shows are being
received by audiences.”  The  Market Vectors Russia ETF (RSX) , the largest dedicated
Russian exchange-traded fund, rose 0.1 percent to $30.97
yesterday, the highest level since Sept. 14. The RTS Volatility
Index, which measures expected swings in the  stock futures ,
increased 1.8 percent to 20.42.  Audience Share  CTC is reversing its 11 percent slump in 2012, when it was
relegated to fifth place among Russian TV channels and posted
the first quarterly sales drop since 2009 in the April-June
period of the year. CTC TV’s share of viewers aged 4 years and
older was at 6 percent in the week to Jan. 20, TNS Global said
in an emailed report on Jan. 24.  CTC’s audience share of viewers aged 6 to 54 years
increased to 9.4 percent in the fourth quarter, from 8.7 percent
in the third quarter, the company said on its website, citing
TNS Global data. CTC’s share of viewers aged between 10 and 45
years rose to 11 percent in the fourth quarter from 10.1 percent
in the previous period, the data show.  The channel, which contributed 62 percent of CTC’s 2011
revenue, plans to expand production of local programming
featuring some of  Russia ’s most popular actors, such as  Marat
Basharov  and Dmitriy Nagiev, Vyacheslav Murugov, CTC TV’s
general director, said Jan. 28, according to his interview with
Ogonek weekly posted on CTC’s website.  Trading Volumes  The media company’s shares will rally to as high as $12.1
should they not retrace and settle below $9.30, Clement Hirson,
a technical strategist at Trading Central in Paris, said by e-
mail on Jan. 28. Trading volume in CTC Media’s stock was 3.5
times the average daily volume for the past three months.  Russia’s gross domestic product will climb 3.5 percent in
2013, unchanged from the estimated pace of economic expansion in
2012, Deputy Economy Minister  Andrei Klepach  said in Moscow
yesterday. The economy is seen growing 3.4 percent, according to
the median of 25 economists’s estimates in a Bloomberg survey
last month.  “CTC is sensitive to economic data and benefits from
faster economic growth,” Libin said.  Ad Spending  Total spending on Russian TV ads is expected to increase to
 $5.9 billion  in 2014, the biggest market in  Europe , from $4.4
billion in 2011, CTC Media said on its website, citing estimates
by industry think-tanks, including Zenith Optimedia and Video
International.  Proceeds from advertising accounted for more than 97
percent of company revenue in 2011, the highest level since
2005, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  OAO Gazprom Neft (GZPFY)  increased 0.9 percent to $24.17 in New
York after shares in Moscow lost 0.5 percent to 144.51 rubles,
or the equivalent of $4.81. One ADR equals five shares. UBS AG
reiterated its buy rating on the stock yesterday, while lowering
the price estimate to $6 from $6.5.  Crude for March delivery gained 1.2 percent to $97.57 a
barrel on the  New York Mercantile Exchange  yesterday, the
