Nokia Oyj (NOK1V) , the struggling Finnish
phonemaker, plans to invest $250 million in a fund that will
provide venture funding for mobile communications companies
worldwide, with an increased focus on China.  Nokia Growth Partners, the venture-capital arm of Nokia,
will continue to invest in companies in the U.S., Europe and
 Asia , Espoo, Finland-based Nokia said today in a statement. This
is the third fund for Nokia Growth Partners.  The manufacturer is seeking to spur demand for its Lumia
smartphones, which run Microsoft Corp.’s Windows Phone operating
system and compete against Apple Inc.’s iPhone and devices
running Google Inc.’s Android software. Last week, Nokia
reported its seventh straight drop in quarterly revenue and
skipped annual dividend for the first time in at least 143 years
to help it retain cash to fuel a comeback.  David Tang, who previously was vice chairman of Nokia
 China , will join Nokia Growth Partners as a managing director,
while Lu Guo joins from Keystone Ventures, where he was
responsible for mobile and Internet investments. Both will be
based in Beijing, according to the statement.  Last year, Nokia’s venture capital business led a $10.7-
million investment round in Luminate Inc., a  Mountain View ,
California-based company that makes software that links images
to information on the Internet. The fund also invested in
Voddler, a Stockholm-based video-on-demand service, in 2011.  Nokia  shares  rose 1 percent to 3.14 euros at 12:47 p.m. in
Helsinki. They’ve declined for the past five years, dropping 22
percent in 2012.  To contact the reporter on this story:
