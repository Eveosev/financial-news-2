Zambia’s competition regulator
rejected an application from  Toyota Tsusho Corp. (8015) , the trading
arm of Japan’s biggest carmaker, to merge its local operations
with those of  CFAO SA (CFAO) , the auto-part and drug distributor.  The merger would have created a company controlling about
75 percent of Zambia’s new car market, Hanford Chaaba, spokesman
for the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission, said by
phone from Lusaka, the capital.  “The new motor vehicle market would be highly
concentrated,” with a substantial lessening of competition as a
result, he said. A phone call to Toyota’s headquarters in Lusaka
wasn’t answered outside normal business hours.  Toyota Tsusho owns about 98 percent of CFAO, based in
France, after buying the 70 percent of the company it did not
already own in a 1.62 billion-euro ($2.15 billion) deal last
year. The acquisition, Toyota’s largest since 2005, was part of
a plan to expand in  Africa .  To contact the reporter on this story:
