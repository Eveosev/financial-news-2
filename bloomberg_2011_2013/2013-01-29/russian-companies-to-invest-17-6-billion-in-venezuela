Russian oil companies will invest
$17.6 billion in  Venezuela  by 2019 and quadruple output,
expanding cooperation to offshore areas and oil services, said
the petroleum minister of South America’s largest oil producer.  OAO Rosneft (ROSN) ,  Russia ’s state-run producer, has signed a
preliminary deal for the second phase of the Mariscal Sucre gas
project off the coast of Venezuela, which will produce 600
million cubic feet a day of gas and 20,000 barrels a day of
condensate, oil minister Rafael Ramirez told reporters in
Caracas today.  In 2011 Venezuela entered a joint venture with Russian
banks as the ruling socialist party sought to replace private
oil investment with bilateral deals with allied governments such
as China and Russia. Projects with Russian oil companies in
Venezuela will produce 930,000 barrels a day by 2019, four times
the current volume, said Ramirez.  “We’ll finance the works with loans from Russian banks and
credit lines from international banks,” Rosneft Chief Executive
Officer Igor Sechin told reporters in Caracas today with
Ramirez.  Rosneft will assume leadership of the the Russian
consortium developing the heavy-oil Junin 6 block after buying
out the stake held by  OAO Surgutneftegaz. (SGGD)  Petroleos de
Venezuela, known as PDVSA, will continue to operate the block
with a 60 percent stake, Ramirez said.  PDVSA, based in Caracas, will also create a joint company
with Russian partners to assemble drilling rigs in Venezuela,
following a model established with Chinese oil companies, said
Ramirez.  Other Russian oil companies operating in Venezuela include
OAO Lukoil and OAO Gazprom Neft.  To contact the reporters on this story:
