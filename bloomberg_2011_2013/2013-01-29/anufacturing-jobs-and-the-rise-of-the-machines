The story of how technological progress is affecting employment — whether, in other words, the robots are eating our jobs — is clearly an important one. But who's telling it correctly? I believe that technological unemployment (and underemployment) is a real and growing phenomenon. But since  Erik Brynjolfsson  and I appeared on  60 Minutes  in January for " March of the Machines ," a story that examined the labor force implications of advanced digital technologies like robots and other forms of automation, we've been accused of being unclear on the concept.  For example, the  Association for Advancing Automation said in response  that we "are missing the bigger picture" by not recognizing that American companies are "successfully implement[ing] automation technologies instead of going out of business or sending manufacturing overseas." They add: "American manufacturing's embrace of robotics will ensure a new manufacturing renaissance in this country." If the A3, or anyone else, thinks that lots more manufacturing jobs will accompany this renaissance, they're just dead wrong. The facts are too clear, and they all point in the other direction. For example: Fair enough, but what if those other companies are also automating? One of the most striking phenomena of recent years is the encroachment of automation into tasks, skills and abilities that used to belong to people alone. As we document in  Race Against the Machine , this includes driving cars, responding accurately to natural language questions, understanding and producing human speech, writing prose, reviewing documents and many others. Some combination of these will be valuable in every industry. Previous waves of automation, like the mechanization of agriculture and the advent of electric power to factories, have not resulted in large-scale unemployment or impoverishment of the average worker. But the historical pattern isn't giving me a lot of comfort these days, simply because we've never before seen automation encroach so broadly and deeply, while also improving so quickly at the same time.  I don't know what all the consequences of the current wave of digital automation will be — no one does. But I'm not blithe about its consequences for the labor force, because that would be ignoring the data and missing the big picture.
