Apple Inc. (AAPL)  asked a federal judge to
order  Google Inc. (GOOG)  to comply with a subpoena issued in connection
with its litigation involving the search engine company’s
Motorola Mobility unit.  Apple said it’s seeking information to help its fight
against Motorola Mobility in a patent-infringement lawsuit in
federal court in Miami, according to the request filed yesterday
in  San Jose , California. In the Florida case, Apple claims that
Motorola Mobility mobile phones and tablets infringe seven of
its patents, according to the filing.  Google, based in Mountain View, California, made a $12.4
billion purchase of smartphone-maker Motorola Mobility Holdings
last year. In August, Google said it would cut 4,000 Motorola
Mobility jobs and close about a third of its 90 facilities.
 Arris Group Inc. (ARRS)  agreed to buy the Motorola Home unit for $2.35
billion in December.  Apple’s filing cites that acquisition, arguing that it
involved information about the valuation of Motorola Mobility’s
patent portfolio that it licensed as part of the deal, according
to the filing.  “Apple’s subpoena to Google concerns these issues and
Google’s noncompliance impairs Apple’s ability to develop its
infringement and damages case against Motorola,” the Cupertino,
California-based company said in the filing.  A Google representative didn’t immediately respond to an e-
mail seeking comment on Apple’s filing.  The case is Apple Inc. v. Google Inc., 13-cv-80019, U.S.
District Court, Northern District of California (San Jose).  To contact the reporter on this story:
