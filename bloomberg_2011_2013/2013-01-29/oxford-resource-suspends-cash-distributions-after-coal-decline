Oxford Resource Partners LP (OXF) , a
producer of coal in the Northern Appalachian and Illinois Basin
regions of the U.S., suspended cash distributions to investors
for the fourth quarter after a decline in the price of the
commodity.  Oxford may sell some surplus mining equipment and is trying
to refinance its credit facility, the Columbus, Ohio-based
company said today in a statement. Oxford didnâ€™t say when it
might resume the distributions.  To contact the reporter on this story:
