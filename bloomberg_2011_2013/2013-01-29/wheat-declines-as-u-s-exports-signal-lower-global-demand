Wheat futures fell for the first
time in three sessions as export data in the U.S., the world’s
biggest shipper, signaled lower global demand.  From June 1 through Jan. 17,  exports  were 14.5 million
metric tons, down 12 percent from a year earlier, U.S.
Department of Agriculture data show. Prices headed for a monthly
decline after tumbling 14 percent in the fourth quarter, the
most since mid-2011.  “Everybody was saying what great wheat demand we were
going to have, and it never did happen,”  Tom Leffler , the owner
of Leffler Commodities LLC in Augusta,  Kansas , said in a
telephone interview. “We’re in the second half of the marketing
year, and it’s still not happening.”  Wheat futures for March delivery fell 0.3 percent to settle
at $7.77 a bushel at 2 p.m. on the Chicago Board of Trade.
Earlier, the price gained as much as 0.7 percent.  In the U.S., wheat is the fourth-largest crop, valued at
$14.4 billion in 2011, behind corn, soybeans and hay, government
data show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
