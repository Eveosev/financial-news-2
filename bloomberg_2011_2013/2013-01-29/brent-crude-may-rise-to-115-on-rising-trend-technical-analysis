Brent crude  may climb to almost $115
a barrel in the next two weeks after the most recent closes were
above the previous highest levels, according to technical
analysis by Futurestechs.com Ltd.  “The initial trends so far this year have been for prices
to steadily rise before posing resistance at $112.40,” Liam Roberts, technical analyst at the Billericay, England-based
researcher. “Now we have had consecutive closes above this
level. The next upside target is $114.95, where we saw a number
of highs in mid-October.”  The contract for March delivery was little changed at
$113.39 a barrel on the ICE Futures Europe exchange as of 9:33
a.m. in  London . It closed yesterday at $113.48, which was the
highest in more than three months.  “We are backing the bulls at the moment, as you have
resistance levels being passed and on top of that open interest
is rising, which is a sign that long positions are increasing
too,” Roberts said.  In  technical analysis , investors and analysts study charts
of trading patterns and prices to predict changes in a security,
