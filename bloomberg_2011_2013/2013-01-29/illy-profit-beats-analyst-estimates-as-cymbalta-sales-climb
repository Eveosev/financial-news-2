Eli Lilly & Co. (LLY)  reported fourth-
quarter earnings that beat analyst estimates as sales of its
top-selling drug, the Cymbalta depression treatment, increased
20 percent, helped by higher prices in the U.S.  Earnings excluding one-time items of 85 cents a share beat
by 6 cents the average of 17 analyst  estimates  compiled by
Bloomberg. Net income fell 4 percent to $827.2 million, or 74
cents a share, Indianapolis-based Lilly said in a statement.  Lilly has struggled to boost earnings as generic copies
take sales from its schizophrenia drug Zyprexa, which generated
$5 billion in annual revenue before losing patent protection in
October 2011. Chief Executive Officer  John Lechleiter  has said
profit won’t grow again until after 2014, when Cymbalta loses
market exclusivity.  “2013 is the eye of the storm between Zyprexa and
Cymbalta, so we’ll see,” said Judson Clark, an analyst with
 Edward Jones  in a phone interview. “Their pipeline needs to
step up.”  Lilly said it has 13 drugs in the final stages of testing
and expects to seek regulatory approval this year for two new
cancer medicines and three new diabetes treatments.  Revenue fell 1 percent to $5.96 billion, beating analysts’
 average  estimate of $5.8 billion, helped by its  animal health 
unit’s 18 percent increase in sales to $554.1 million.  Animal Health  Lilly Chief Financial Officer Derica Rice said the company
has no plans to sell or spin off its animal health unit despite
a similar move by rival  Pfizer Inc. (PFE) , which is planning to break
off its animal division.  Lilly raised its 2013 forecast by 7 cents a share to $3.82
to $3.97, excluding certain items, due to a delayed research tax
credit. The company previously forecast $3.75 to $3.90 a share.  Lilly rose 3.2 percent to $54.32 at 4 p.m.  New York  time.
The shares have  gained  39 percent in the past 12 months.  Sales of Zyprexa fell 49 percent to $384.8 million in the
quarter after losing patent protection in the same quarter a
year earlier. That loss was partly offset by revenue from the
antidepressant Cymbalta, which increased to $1.42 billion.  Sales of the diabetes treatment Humalog fell 7 percent to
$616 million and the cancer therapy Alimta gained 7 percent to
$684.3 million.  To contact the reporter on this story:
