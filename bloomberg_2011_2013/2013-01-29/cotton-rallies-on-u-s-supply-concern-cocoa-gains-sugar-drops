Cotton rallied, heading for the
biggest monthly gain in almost two years, on mounting concern
that output will drop in the U.S., the world’s biggest exporter.
Cocoa, coffee and orange juice also gained, while sugar fell.  Planting of cotton in the U.S. probably will plunge 16
percent this year to 10.32 million acres as farmers shift to
more-profitable crops, including corn and soybeans, according to
a Bloomberg survey. While cotton futures are up 28 percent since
reaching a 31-month low in June, prices are still less than half
of the record reached in 2011 because of a global surplus.  “Farmers are going to have to commit soon to what they are
planting down south, so we may get caught with short supplies,”
Sterling Smith, a futures specialist at Chicago-based Citigroup
Global Markets Inc., said in an e-mail.  Cotton for March delivery rose 1.7 percent to 82.39 cents a
pound at 2:30 p.m. on ICE Futures U.S. in  New York . Prices are
up 9.6 percent since Dec. 31, heading for the biggest monthly
gain since February 2011.  Also in New York, cocoa futures for March delivery climbed
1.6 percent to $2,195 a metric ton. Arabica-coffee futures for
March delivery were up 0.5 percent to $1.498 a pound.  Orange-juice futures for March delivery gained 0.2 percent
to $1.143 a pound.  Raw-sugar futures for March delivery fell 1.9 percent to
18.38 cents a pound, the biggest drop since Jan. 3.  To contact the reporters on this story:
