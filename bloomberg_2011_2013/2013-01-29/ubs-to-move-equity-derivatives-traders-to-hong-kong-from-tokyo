UBS AG (UBSN) , Switzerland’s biggest bank,
said it will relocate its equity derivatives trading team from
 Tokyo  to  Hong Kong .  The brokerage has begun moving the traders, according to
spokeswoman Eiko Noda, who declined to specify the number of
people affected or when the move will be completed. Separately,
Tokyo-based communications and IT services analyst Kohei Kajimoto has left the investment bank, Noda said.  “Centralization of this effort in a single place will
allow us to deliver higher quality service to our clients across
Asia Pacific, including in Japan,” Trevor Hill, head of
Japanese equities for UBS Securities Japan Co., said in an e-
mail today. “We continue to be active in all equity and equity-
aligned derivatives products on behalf of clients.”  UBS said last year that it was “reshaping” to meet the
needs of the market. The investment bank is cutting 30 fixed-
income positions in  Japan , two people with knowledge of the
matter said in October. UBS had 768 employees in Japan as of
March 31, down from 868 a year earlier, according to a filing
with the Financial Services Agency.  Calls and an e-mail to Kajimoto went unanswered.  To contact the reporters on this story:
