Victims found shot at point-blank
range on the banks of Quweiq River in the Syrian city of Aleppo,
the opposition Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said in an e-
mail.  The group said the men were mostly 20-30 years old and had
bullet wounds to the head. It said some had their hands tied.  Another activist group, the Local Coordination Committees,
said 80 bodies were recovered from the scene.  To contact the reporter on this story:
