Italy  sold 8.5 billion euros ($11.4
billion) of six-month Treasury bills as rates dropped to the
lowest in almost three years as the  European Central Bank ’s
pledge to buy bonds continues to provide an effective backstop
even amid rising political concerns.  The Treasury in  Rome  today sold the 181-day bills at 0.731
percent, the lowest since March 26, 2010 and down from 0.949
percent at the previous auction of similar-maturity debt Dec.
27. At today’s auction investors bid for 1.65 times the amount
of the debt offered, up from 1.57 times last month. The sale was
probably helped by 9.78 billion euros in redemptions this week.  Investors continue to shrug off the political risk of a
hung parliament after Italy’s Feb. 24-25 national vote. Support
for frontrunner Pier Luigi Bersani’s Democratic party declined
1.1 percent to 30.7 percent after a derivatives scandal at  Banca
Monte dei Paschi di Siena SpA  emerged last week, according to an
EMG poll conducted Jan. 24-25 for La7 television. Support for
outgoing premier  Mario Monti ’s coalition fell 0.7 percent to
14.5 percent, while former Prime Minister  Silvio Berlusconi ’s
People of Liberty party rose 1 percent to 20 percent.  Weak Majority  Should the trend continue, it may prevent the center-left
bloc from winning an outright majority in both houses of
Parliament even if it strikes an alliance with outgoing premier
Mario Monti’s centrists.  While “markets, as in any other country, would like to see
a solid majority”, even if this doesn’t happen, it wouldn’t
represent a major problem as the next government will likely
continue on the reform path of the Monti administration, Mario Spreafico, chief investment officer at Schroders Private Banking
in Milan, said by phone after the auction.  Finance Minister  Vittorio Grilli  is due to testify at 3
p.m. today on Monte Paschi’s 3.9 billion-euro rescue as
lawmakers question whether the lender deserves aid after hiding
losses.  Italy’s 10-year bond yield was little changed at 4.2
percent after the sale at 11:56 a.m. in Rome. Italy returns to
the market tomorrow with the sale of longer-maturity bonds.  To contact the reporter on this story:
