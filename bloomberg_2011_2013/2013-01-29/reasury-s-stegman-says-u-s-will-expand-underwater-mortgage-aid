The Obama administration will work
to refinance mortgages for so-called underwater borrowers with
loans in private-label securities, U.S. Treasury Department
official Michael Stegman said today in a Las Vegas speech.  Treasury may act unilaterally to aid borrowers who owe more
than their homes are worth if Congress doesn’t pass legislation
provide assistance, Stegman, a Treasury counselor on housing
policy, said in remarks prepared for an American Securitization
Forum conference.  “Legislation would facilitate a refinance, whereas under
our existing authority, Treasury could only modify the most
deeply underwater loans and pay investors for some amount of
forgone interest,” Stegman said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
