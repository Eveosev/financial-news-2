Diesel fuel in  Chicago  rose to the
highest price in almost eight weeks on speculation that a
narrowing spread to Gulf Coast prices will limit  supplies .  Prompt delivery for  Chicago diesel  gained 4.93 cents to
$3.0836 a gallon at 4:11 p.m. New York time, the highest level
since Dec. 5, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The price
was 0.31 cent below diesel fuel on the Gulf, compared with a gap
of 6.75 cents on Jan. 2.  When diesel is priced higher in the Gulf than the Midwest,
“it discourages a lot of would-be shippers,” said Hannah
Hauman, Houston-based manager of supply and distribution at
Mansfield Oil Co. That’s helped boost prices in Chicago and
narrow the fuel spread between the regions, she said.  The discount of  ultra-low-sulfur diesel  in Chicago to  New
York  Mercantile Exchange heating oil futures strengthened 0.5
cent to 1.5 cents a gallon, the narrowest gap since Dec. 14.
Supplies of distillates including heating oil and diesel in the
Midwest totaled 31.4 million barrels last week, the  lowest  level
for this time of year since 2010, according to Energy
Information Administration data.  The  3-2-1 crack spread , a measure of refining profitability
based on West Texas Intermediate and ultra-low-sulfur diesel,
gained 0.4422 cent to $23.509 a barrel at 4:21 p.m. That’s the
sixth consecutive advance and the highest since Dec. 19, data
compiled by Bloomberg show.  The 3-2-1 spread on the Gulf Coast, using WTI in Cushing
and spot prices for distillates and gasoline, rose $1.325 to
$23.52 a barrel, the highest since Jan. 9. The spread based on
Light Louisiana Sweet oil grew $1.4822 to $5.4868 a barrel.  Ultra-low-sulfur diesel  on the U.S.  Gulf Coast  declined
2.53 cents to 2.25 cents below futures. The same fuel in the
 Group 3 region  fell 0.25 cent to trade at a discount to futures
of 2.75 cents.  To contact the reporter on this story:
