Lithuania sold 600 million litai
($234 million) in a private placement, increasing the Baltic
nation’s proceeds from debt sales at home and abroad this week
to about $800 million.  The government placed the litai-denominated bonds this
week, Vytautas Lenkutis, a spokesman at the Finance Ministry in
the capital, Vilnius, said today by phone, declining to give
more details.  Newspaper Verslo Zinios reported on Jan. 10 the government
was considering placing debt with administrators for bankrupt
lender Bankas Snoras AB so money recovered for creditors could
be invested. Snoras plans to invest about 600 million litai in
government securities, Tomas Vaisvila, a spokesman for the
lender, said in a phone interview today.  Lithuania raised 400 million euros ($539 million) in a tap
of its 2018 euro bonds yesterday, at a price to yield 2.631
percent. It also sold 60 million litai of January 2016 bonds at
an auction with an average yield of 1.95 percent.  Lithuania’s borrowing costs have plunged as it enjoys one
of  Europe ’s fastest economic growth rates and is reducing its
budget deficit to qualify for euro adoption as soon as 2015. The
government needs to repay a 1 billion-euro bond on March 5 that
it first issued in 2003.  Yields on the 2018 bonds rose to 2.675 percent in trading
today, having been more than 5 percent a year ago, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
