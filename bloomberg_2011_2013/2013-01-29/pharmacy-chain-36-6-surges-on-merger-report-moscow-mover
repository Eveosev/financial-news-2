OAO Pharmacy Chain 36.6 rallied the
most in three months on a report  Russia ’s biggest drugstore
chain may issue new shares to merge with another pharmacy group.  The stock jumped as much as 13 percent and was 12 percent
higher at 36.78 rubles by 3:21 p.m. in Moscow, the biggest
intraday advance since Nov. 2. The volume of shares was 2.3
million, equivalent to about 16 times the three-month average,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  36.6 may issue new shares to raise as much as $300 million
for a possible merger with A5 Pharmacy Chain,  Kommersant 
reported today, citing Sergey Solodov, an A5 shareholder, and a
person close to 36.6 who it didn’t identify. The merged company
will control 25 percent of the Moscow pharmaceutical market,
according to an e-mailed report from RYE, Man & Gor Securities
in Moscow.  “The combined company may utilize increased economies of
scale and take advantage of a strong market position, which
could allow the company to bargain for better purchasing and
payment terms with suppliers,” Marat Ibragimov, an analyst at
UralSib Capital in Moscow, said in an e-mailed note. “The
equity-financed structure of the deal may improve the free-float
and support the stock’s liquidity, which should be positively
received by equity investors.”  36.6 shares lost 17 percent last year.  Calls and e-mails to 36.6’s spokesman Artyom Baybuz in
Moscow weren’t immediately returned. An e-mail to A5 wasn’t
immediately returned.  To contact the reporter on this story:
