The rupee traded near the lowest
level in more than a week before the  Reserve Bank  of India
reviews  interest rates  today.  An economic-policy overhaul in the past four months by the
government may give more room to spur growth, the central bank
said in a report yesterday, while signaling scope for monetary
easing is limited by inflation of more than 7 percent and a
record current-account deficit. The RBI will cut its benchmark
repurchase rate to 7.75 percent from 8 percent, according to 25
of 29 economists surveyed by Bloomberg. Three predict a
reduction to 7.5 percent and one sees no change.  “The RBI’s mention of suppressed inflation and a widening
current-account deficit as reasons to continue its calibrated
stance on easing indicates” the greater possibility of a 25
basis point rate cut rather than a reduction of 50, Tushar
Poddar, a Mumbai-based economist at Goldman Sachs Group Inc.,
wrote in a report today. The rupee will appreciate gradually
over the “medium-term” as the shortfall narrows, he wrote.  The currency was little changed from yesterday at 53.9250
per dollar as of 9:27 a.m. in Mumbai, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg. It touched 53.9600 earlier, the weakest level
since Jan. 18. One-month implied volatility in the rupee, a
gauge of expected moves in the  exchange rate  used to price
options, was steady at 10 percent.  The shortfall in the current account, the broadest measure
of trade, widened to $22.3 billion in the quarter through
September, the latest official data show. Goldman predicts the
deficit will narrow to 3.6 percent of gross domestic product in
2013 from an estimated 4.5 percent in 2012. The rupee will
advance to 52 in 12 months, the bank forecasts.  Three-month onshore rupee forwards traded at 55.00 per
dollar, compared with 54.90 yesterday, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. Offshore non-deliverable contracts were
at 54.75 versus 54.78. Forwards are agreements to buy or sell
assets at a set price and date. Non-deliverable contracts are
settled in dollars.  To contact the reporter on this story:
