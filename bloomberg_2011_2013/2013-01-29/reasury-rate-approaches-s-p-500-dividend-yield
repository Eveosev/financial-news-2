Treasuries were little changed
following three days of losses before the U.S. sells $35 billion
of five-year notes, the second of three auctions of coupon-
bearing debt this week totaling $99 billion.  U.S.  10-year yields  were at almost the highest level since
April as Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  and policy
makers start a two-day meeting after minutes of the December
gathering indicated officials began debating an end to bond
buying, known as quantitative easing, as early as this year.
Investors increased bets to the highest level since 2011 that
the price of Treasuries will drop, a survey by JPMorgan Chase &
Co. showed.  “Bernanke may clarify that they are committed to QE --
that sets the stage for stability and a move lower in rates,”
said Rajiv Setia, head of U.S. rates research in New York at
Barclays Plc. “The selloff is an attractive buying opportunity.
Our target for year-end is 1.60 percent. We think this is a good
opportunity to buy the dip.”  The 10-year note  yielded  1.97 percent at 11:31 a.m. in  New
York , according to Bloomberg Bond Trader prices. The 1.625
percent security due November 2022 traded at 96 29/32. The yield
climbed to 2.004 percent yesterday, the highest since April 25.  The yield, which dropped to a record 1.379 percent in July,
has averaged 3.64 percent during the past decade.  The current  five-year note  yielded 0.87 percent.  Short Bets  Investors  raised bets  to the highest level since July 5,
2011, that the price of the securities will drop, according to
JPMorgan.  The percentage of shorts in the firm’s “all clients”
survey rose to 25 percent in the week ending yesterday, up from
19 percent the previous week. Longs, or bets Treasuries will
rise, increased to 13 percent from 7 percent the previous week.  The proportion of net shorts remained steady at 12
percentage points, according to JPMorgan. About 62 percent of
the clients surveyed were neutral, down from 74 percent.  The five-year notes being sold today yielded 0.88 percent
in pre-auction trading, compared with 0.77 percent at the
previous sale of the securities on Dec. 18.  Direct bidders , non-primary dealer investors that place
their bids with the Treasury, purchased 30.4 percent of the
notes, the second highest after 32.1 percent in September 2004,
based on records going back to 2003.  ‘Very Attractive’  “With the backup in the marketplace, the five-year is very
attractive for investors and people trying to get back into the
marketplace,” said Thomas di Galoma, a managing director at
Navigate Advisors LLC, a brokerage for institutional investors
in  Stamford ,  Connecticut .  The U.S. sold $35 billion of two-year notes yesterday and
will auction $29 billion of seven-year securities tomorrow.  Treasuries have handed investors a 1 percent loss in
January through yesterday, heading for the worst monthly
performance since March, according to Bank of America Merrill
Lynch indexes.  Ten-year Treasury rates were 18 basis points below the
dividend yield on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index, the narrowest
spread since Sept. 14, based on closing prices. The  yield  on the
 S&P 500 Index  has dropped to 2.14 percent from last year’s high
of 2.29 percent reached in November.  The Fed purchased $3.357 billion in Treasuries maturing
from February 2020 to November 2022 today as part of its plan to
cap borrowing costs. The central bank is purchasing $85 billion
of government and mortgage debt each month.  Fed Buying  Central-bank policy makers said at their last meeting they
may end the purchases sometime in 2013, with members divided
between a mid- or end-of-year finish, according to the minutes
of the  Federal Open Market Committee ’s Dec. 11-12 gathering.  Fed Chairman Ben S. Bernanke’s latest round of bond buying
will reach $1.14 trillion before he ends the program in the
first quarter of 2014, according to median estimates in a
Bloomberg survey of economists.  Bernanke will push on with purchases of $40 billion a month
of mortgage bonds and $45 billion a month of Treasuries,
according to the survey of 44 economists, even as some Fed
officials warn his unprecedented balance-sheet expansion will
impair efforts to tighten policy when necessary.  A report today showed  home prices  in 20 U.S. cities rose in
November from a year earlier by the most in more than six years.
The S&P/Case-Shiller index of property values increased 5.5
percent from November 2011, the biggest year-over-year gain
since August 2006. The median projection of 30 economists
surveyed by Bloomberg called for a 5.6 percent advance.  The Conference Board’s index of consumer sentiment fell to
58.6 this month from a revised 66.7 in December. The median
forecast of economists surveyed by  Bloomberg News  was for a drop
to 64.  U.S. employers added 160,000 workers in January, after a
155,000 increase in December, according to a Bloomberg News
survey before a Feb. 1 report from the Labor Department.  To contact the reporters on this story:
