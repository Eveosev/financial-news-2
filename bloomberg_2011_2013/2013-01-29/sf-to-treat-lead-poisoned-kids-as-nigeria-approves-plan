Medecins Sans Frontiers, the
international medical charity, said it’s set to start treatment
of 1,500 children affected by lead-poisoning in  Nigeria  after
President Goodluck Jonathan released funds for a clean-up.  At least 400 children have died since 2009 when a gold rush
in Nigeria’s northern Zamfara state exposed thousands of
children of cottage miners to lead poisoning in what MSF said
may be the worst such crisis in history. Treatment had been
delayed while funds were sought to rid contaminated soil of
lead.  “As soon as the first neighborhood is remediated then we
can begin the treatment of children,” Hosanna Fox, MSF project
coordinator in Nigeria, said today by phone from Abuja, the
capital. “We’ll be in a position to start screening for blood
lead levels and we’ll be able to know the severity of the
situation.”  Funds worth 480 million naira ($3.1 million) released by
the government will be used to clean the soil of the village of
Bagega in Zamfara, the last of eight contaminated settlements to
be rid of lead, to enable effective treatment of as many as
1,500 affected children, according to MSF.  Residents in Zamfara started artisanal gold-mining in lead-
rich ore as the price of gold increased. Miners returned with
ores to their villages and homes to grind, spreading lead dust
into households and poisoning mostly crawling toddlers,  who
have more hand-to-mouth activity than adults, according to MSF.
Long-term consequences for the children include learning
disabilities and damaged organs.  To contact the reporter on this story:
