Ingenico SA (ING) , a French provider of
payment terminals and services, agreed to buy online-payment
company Ogone for 360 million euros ($484 million) as part of a
push to expand outside  Europe .  Acquiring closely held Ogone, which makes software for
electronic transactions over the Internet, will boost profit
from 2014, Paris-based Ingenico said today in an e-mailed
statement. Savings will add 20 million euros in earnings before
interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization in 2015, it said.  “We’ll look to make a push outside Europe,” Chief
Executive Officer Philippe Lazare said on a conference call.
“This year will be dedicated to integrating Ogone. Once that’s
done, we’ll ask ourselves what geographies we can expand our
business to.”  The deal will add Ogone’s operations in countries including
India, Germany and the U.S. Customers of the company, which
focuses on facilitating Web transactions and preventing fraud,
include  Kraft Foods Group Inc. (KRFT) , Ikea and Japan Airlines Co.,
according to the company’s  website .  Ingenico shares rose as much as 2.2 percent to 46.93 euros
and advanced 1.2 percent at 9:27 a.m. in Paris. The stock jumped
47 percent in the 12 months through yesterday, giving the
company a market value of 2.4 billion euros.  Ingenico, which competes with  VeriFone Systems Inc. (PAY) , said
it plans to finance the deal using 120 million euros in cash and
240 million euros in loans.  Ogone, based in Brussels and owned by investment fund
Summit Partners LP, had revenue of 42 million euros last year
and an Ebitda margin of 30 percent, Ingenico said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
