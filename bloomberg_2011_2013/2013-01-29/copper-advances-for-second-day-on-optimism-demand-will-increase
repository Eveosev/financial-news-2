Copper climbed for a second day on
optimism that demand will rise with manufacturing gains in  China 
and the U.S., the world’s biggest users of industrial metals.  The metal for three-month delivery climbed as much as 0.5
percent to $8,089 a metric ton on the London Metal Exchange and
was at $8,061.50 at 12:02 p.m. in  Tokyo . Futures for delivery in
May was little changed at 58,580  yuan  ($9,409) a ton on the
Shanghai Futures Exchange.  Orders for durable goods in the U.S. rose in December for
an unprecedented fourth consecutive month, indicating
manufacturing will keep improving in 2013. Standard Chartered
Plc yesterday  raised  its forecast for China’s growth to 8.3
percent in 2013 from 7.8 percent previously.  With the rise in U.S. durable goods orders, “sentiment
towards China is also improving,” said Nick Trevethan, senior
commodities strategist at Australia & New Zealand Banking Group
Ltd. in  Singapore .  The Chinese Academy of Sciences forecast economic growth
this year will accelerate to 8.4 percent, according to its
annual outlook published on Jan. 26. China’s gross domestic
product increased 7.8 percent last year, the least since 1999,
according to government data.  “Still copper is facing some headwinds, in particular in
terms of rising supply,” Trevethan said.  Copper output in  Chile , the world’s biggest producing
nation, will rise 3 percent to 5.6 million tons this year,
exceeding a record 5.56 million tons set in 2007, according to
estimates released yesterday by the government’s copper
commission  Cochilco .  The contract for delivery in March was little changed at
$3.666 a pound on the Comex in  New York . On the LME, aluminum,
lead and zinc were little changed while nickel fell.  To contact the reporter on this story:
