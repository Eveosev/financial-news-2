Paintings by  Gerhard Richter  and
 Jean-Michel Basquiat  will push the value of London arts sales
next month through $200 million as sellers try to capitalize on
growing demand for works by bankable contemporary artists.  Christie’s International will be auctioning the two works
with hammer-price estimates of more than 7 million pounds ($11
million) on Feb. 13.  Sotheby’s (BID) , Christie’s and Phillips raised a
record $1.1 billion with fees at contemporary-art events in  New
York  in November as wealthy U.S. individuals, nervous of
possible tax rises, sunk money into tangible assets.  “There was a lot of American buying triggered by what was
potentially going to happening in December,” Francis Outred,
Christie’s European head of contemporary art, said in an
interview. U.S. clients represented 72 percent of the buyers at
Christie’s in November, he said. “It will be interesting to see
if that momentum is maintained in  London  in February.”  The formal estimate for the three auction houses’ evening
auctions of contemporary art next month in London is at least
132 million pounds, according to Bloomberg calculations, an
increase of 37.5 percent on the minimum value put on the
equivalent sales last year.  Christie’s event is estimated to raise at least 57.2
million pounds. The bumper offering of 74 lots includes
Basquiat’s 1983 text-packed acrylic, oilstick and paper collage
“Museum Security (Broadway Meltdown)” and Richter’s red, pink
and green 2004 “Abstraktes Bild,” numbered “889-14.”  Blue Bacon  Bacon’s 1954 painting “Man in Blue VI” is re-offered at 4
million pounds to 6 million pounds. The work failed to sell at
Christie’s in February 2009, when the previous contemporary art-
market boom ended, with a low estimate of 4 million pounds.  Damien Hirst’s 1995 sheep-in-formaldehyde piece “Away from
the Flock (Divided)” is priced at 1.8 million pounds to 2.5
million pounds. The only bifurcated example from an edition of
four, this previously appeared at auction in May 2006, when it
sold for $3.4 million.  Lots selling for more than $1 million accounted for 88
percent of the total value of evening sales in 2012, according
to the London-based analysts  ArtTactic .  “Between 25 and 30 artists account for the lion’s share of
the market place at auctions,”  Anders Petterson , the founder of
ArtTactic, said in an interview. “That’s what the buyers feel
safe with. They’re holding art as protection against financial
volatility, if not actually making a profit, and they’re gaining
social status.”  ArtTactic Confidence  ArtTactic’s twice-yearly “U.S. & European Contemporary Art
Market Confidence Indicator” is at 59.4, up 25 percent since
June 2012. A jump in the Economic Confidence Indicator to 47.2
from 18.1 was the main factor in the change of mood, said the
report, based on the responses of 127 experts, to be published
tomorrow.  Two more Basquiat paintings will headline  Phillips’s  first
contemporary art sale in London under its new branding, without
its charismatic auctioneer, Simon de Pury.  Basquiat’s desirably dated 1982 painting-on-paper
“Untitled,” showing a mask-like face with a halo, is valued at
1.8 million pounds to 2.5 million pounds. The 1985 canvas “For
B.A.M.,” featuring a free-floating head and potted plant, is
priced at 1.2 million pounds to 1.8 million pounds.  A 1964  Andy Warhol  silk-screened “Brillo Soap Pads Box,”
wrapped in its original plastic, is estimated to fetch between
600,000 pounds and 800,000 pounds. Back in 2006, this same piece
sold for $710,400 at auction. None of these three works is
guaranteed, said the New-York based auction house.  Highly Valued  Phillips’s Feb. 14 event will comprise 36 lots with a low
estimate of 12.7 million pounds, more than double the 4.7
million-pound minimum valuation of February 2012.  Sotheby’s  Feb. 12 auction of contemporary works is the most
highly valued of the week, with a minimum estimate of 62.1
million pounds.  Bacon’s 1980 “Three Studies for a Self-Portrait” is the
only work in this London series with an eight-figure estimate.
One of 11 such smaller-scale triptychs, and painted when the
artist was 71 years of age, it has been entered by a European
collector with a low valuation of 10 million pounds.  Muse highlights include  Martin Gayford  on art and  Craig
Seligman  on books.  To contact the writer on the story:
