U.S. residential vacancy rates
declined in the fourth quarter as housing demand improved amid
job gains, the Census Bureau reported.  The rate for  rented homes  dropped to 8.7 percent from 9.4
percent a year earlier, while vacancies for  owner-occupied 
houses fell to 1.9 percent from 2.3 percent. The share of
Americans who  own their homes  was 65.4 percent, matching the
lowest level since 1997.  The pace of U.S. household formation is accelerating as
 employment  improves.  Housing starts  jumped last year to the
fastest rate since 2008 as builders worked to meet growing
demand from buyers seeking to take advantage of low  interest
rates  and from renters who can’t afford to buy or don’t want to
own a residence, Commerce Department data showed on Jan. 17.  “The tight vacancy comes from having relatively little
construction in the past few years,”  Jed Kolko , chief economist
of San Francisco-based  Trulia Inc. (TRLA) , which operates an online
property-listing service, said in a telephone interview. “And
one effect of the improving job market is the increase in
household formation, which means that more people are setting
out and forming their own households rather than doubling up
with parents and roommates. That’s another sign of recovery.”  Payrolls in the U.S. rose by 155,000 workers in December
following a 161,000 advance the previous month, Labor Department
figures showed. The unemployment  rate  held at 7.8 percent,
matching the lowest since January 2009.  The number of occupied homes increased to 115 million in
the fourth quarter from an estimated 114.1 million a year
earlier, according to the Census Bureau.  The homeownership rate dropped from 66 percent a year
earlier and 65.5 percent in the third quarter. It matched the
65.4 percent rate from the first quarter of 2012, the lowest
since 1997. The rate peaked at 69.2 percent in July 2004,
spurred by easy credit.  To contact the reporter on this story:
