Ethanol weakened a sixth day against
gasoline as the motor fuel rose on speculation that refinery
shutdowns will tighten supplies, while the biofuel was little
changed because of a supply glut.  The spread widened 3.66 cents a day after Hess Corp. said
it will shut the Port Reading, New Jersey, refinery at the end
of February. Ethanol’s streak of losses versus gasoline is the
longest since 2010.  “Production continues to idle back, but maybe it still
needs to,” said Mike Blackford, a consultant at INTL FCStone in
Des Moines,  Iowa . Ethanol hasn’t tracked gasoline closely
because of the oversupply, he said.  The grain-based additive was 56.84 cents cheaper than
gasoline, based on prompt-month contracts, the widest gap since
Jan. 8. Denatured ethanol for February delivery added 0.2 cent
to $2.405 a gallon on the Chicago Board of Trade. Prices have
advanced 9.8 percent this year.  Gasoline for February delivery rose 3.86 cents, or 1.3
percent, to $2.9734 a gallon on the New York Mercantile
Exchange. The contract covers reformulated gasoline, which is
made to be blended with ethanol.  Ethanol  stockpiles  totaled 20.1 million barrels as of Jan.
18, up 1.4 percent from a year earlier, the highest for this
time of  year  since the U.S. Energy Information Administration
began tracking weekly data in June 2010.  Corn Prices  Corn for March delivery gained 0.25 cent to $7.295 a bushel
in  Chicago . One bushel makes at least 2.75 gallons of ethanol.  Based on March contracts, producers are losing 23 cents on
each gallon of the fuel, unchanged from yesterday, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. The figures exclude the revenue that
can be made from the sale of dried distillers’ grains, a
byproduct of ethanol production that can be fed to livestock.  White Energy Inc., a U.S. ethanol producer, said today that
it idled a distillery in Plainview,  Texas , because of high corn
prices.  Demand for ethanol to be blended with gasoline hasn’t been
robust enough to alleviate the glut and raise prices enough to
where producers can absorb the higher corn costs.  Ethanol-blended gasoline made up about 88 percent of the
total U.S. gasoline pool in the week ended Jan. 18, compared
with 90 percent the previous week, an EIA report showed.  Companies have also faced higher competition from Brazilian
grades of the fuel, which uses sugar cane as a feedstock.  Ethanol Imports  Imports of the biofuel jumped to 67,000 barrels a day in
the week that ended Jan. 18 from 27,000 the previous week and
none a year earlier.  Spot ethanol in Sao Paulo cost $2.13 a gallon in the week
ended Jan. 25, data compiled by Bloomberg show, about 11 percent
cheaper than today’s U.S. futures price.  In spot market trading, ethanol in  New York  harbor at
$2.495 a gallon was 9 cents  more  than in Chicago, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. Ethanol on the Chicago spot market
has traded at about an 8.4 cent discount to New York harbor in
the past year.  Ethanol on the West Coast cost $2.595, the highest in the
U.S., and 13.5 cents more expensive than in the U.S. Gulf. Gulf
Coast ethanol yesterday traded at a 19 cent discount to the West
Coast market, the steepest since July 23.  To contact the reporter on this story:
