Berlin police removed cordons from
six bus stops near the Alexanderplatz area that were sealed off
early today after workers putting up posters at the sites found
a suspicious fluid and complained of breathing problems.  Police and technical staff from the city’s BVG transport
company who examined the bus stops found no evidence of
poisonous substances in the fluid and were unable to account for
the physical complaints of the two workers, police spokesman
Dirk Stoewhase said in an interview.  “Vandals often etch glass with acid but we found none in
the spilled liquid and signs of damage to the bus stops were
clearly old,” said Stoewhase. “We cannot at this stage explain
the workers’ symptoms.” Police reopened the bus stops to the
public at about 9 a.m. after about two hours, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
