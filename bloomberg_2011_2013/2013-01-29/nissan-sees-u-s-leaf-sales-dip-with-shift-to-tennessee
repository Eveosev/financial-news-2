Nissan Motor Co. (7201) , the biggest seller
of electric cars, said U.S. sales of Leaf hatchbacks will drop
temporarily as the company shifts production for the region to
its Tennessee plant.  Leaf deliveries averaged 1,500 units a month in 2012’s
fourth quarter, according to an e-mailed statement. That was up
from about 579 units a month through September. With vehicle and
lithium-ion battery production just starting in Smyrna,
Tennessee, it will take until March to boost supplies, Nissan
said today.  Sales “grew significantly in the fourth quarter, which
resulted in dealers starting January with an even more limited
supply of the electric vehicles than we anticipated,” Brendan
Jones, Nissan’s director of electric vehicle marketing and sales
strategy, said in the statement. The company began 2013 with
fewer than 900 2012 model Leafs, and expects to sell more than
80 percent of them this month, Jones said.  Japan ’s second-largest carmaker sold 9,819 Leafs in the
U.S. last year, less than half of Chief Executive Officer Carlos Ghosn’s 20,000-unit goal. The Yokohama, Japan-based company
expects higher sales of the car, powered solely by batteries, to
grow because of lower prices and improved recharge time.  Previously all Leafs sold in the U.S. were imported from
Japan. Nissan this month said the new 2013 S trim Leaf being
built in Smyrna has a $28,800 base price, down from $35,200 for
the previous entry-level model. The car averages 73 miles (117
kilometers) per charge and also qualifies for a $7,500 federal
tax credit.  Nissan, with U.S. headquarters in Franklin,  Tennessee , is
to release January sales results on Feb. 1.  To contact the reporter on this story:
