Germany ’s  Lena Duerr  won the World
Cup parallel slalom city event in Moscow as American teenager
 Mikaela Shiffrin  extended her lead in the discipline’s standings
by finishing third.  Duerr, 21, beat Slovakia’s Veronika Velez Zuzulova over two
runs for her first World Cup victory. Shiffrin, 17, edged out
Wendy Holdener of Switzerland in the third-place race.  The Moscow event was held on a ramp in the north of the
city with two skiers going head-to-head in races that lasted
around 20 seconds.  Competing in her first full season on the World Cup
circuit, Shiffrin has already won three events. She extended her
advantage in the slalom standings to 33 points over overall
leader Tina Maze of Slovenia, who finished fifth.  In the men’s race,  Marcel Hirscher  of  Austria  defeated
Sweden’s Andre Myhrer for his sixth title of the season, with
Slovenia’s Ivica Kostelic finishing third.  Hirscher, 23, increased his lead in the overall standings
to 214 points over  Norway ’s Aksel Lund Svindal, and also
extended his slalom lead to 184 points over Felix Neureuther of
Germany.  Four-time overall World Cup champion Lindsey Vonn, former
Olympic champion Julia Mancuso and giant slalom World Cup leader
Ted Ligety, all from the U.S., didn’t race in Moscow in order to
prepare for next week’s ski world championships in Schladming,
Austria.  To contact the reporter on this story:
