French  consumer confidence  was
unchanged as jobless claims rose to a 15-year high.  Household sentiment held at 86 in February, national
statistics office Insee said today in a release from Paris.
That’s in line with the median of forecasts from eight 
economists gathered by  Bloomberg News .  French jobless claims rose last month to 3.17 million, the
labor ministry said yesterday. The increase brought such claims
close to the country’s historic peak in January 1997, when they
stood at 3.21 million.  To contact the reporter on this story:
