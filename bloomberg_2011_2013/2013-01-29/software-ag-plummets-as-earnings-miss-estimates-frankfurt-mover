Software AG (SOW) ,  Germany ’s second-
biggest software maker, declined the most in more than a year 
after forecasting lower profit as fourth-quarter sales fell 
short of analyst estimates.  Revenue in the three months through December dropped 5.9
percent to 276.7 million euros ($372 million), missing the
average analyst estimate of 289.4 million euros in a Bloomberg
survey. Earnings per share will fall to 1.70 euros to 1.80 euros
this year, the company forecast today, citing increasing
investment for future growth. That compares with an average
estimate of 2.15 euros.  The shares slumped as much as 16 percent to 29.39 euros
today, the biggest drop since Jan. 10 last year, and were down
15 percent as of 11:43 a.m. in  Frankfurt , paring the stock’s
advance to 21 percent in 12 months. The  volume  of shares traded
today was more than nine times the three-month daily average.  “The fourth-quarter miss is disappointing, but Software
AG’s strategy of focusing on higher-margin and faster-growing
business is and should continue to pay off,” JPMorgan Chase &
Co. analyst Claudia Lane wrote in a note to clients today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
