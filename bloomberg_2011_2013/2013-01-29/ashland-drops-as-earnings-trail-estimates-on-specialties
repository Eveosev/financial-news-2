Ashland Inc. (ASH) , the biggest producer
of specialty paper-making chemicals, fell the most in four
months after posting earnings that trailed analysts’ estimates
after sales volumes fell at its specialty-ingredients unit.  Ashland dropped 6 percent to $80.43 in  New York , the biggest
decline since Sept. 25.  Earnings excluding a benefit from an insurance settlement
and other items were $1.12 a share in the fiscal first quarter,
which ended Dec. 31, Covington, Kentucky-based Ashland said
today in a statement. That compares with the $1.36 average of
eight estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  Ashland had a $31 million loss on straight guar, including
an inventory writedown because of lower prices, which exceeded
the company’s December forecast for a $25 million loss. Guar is
a plant derivative used as a thickener in foods and in drilling
fluids. Lower December sales volumes for coatings and
construction products led to a 28 percent decline in earnings
before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization at the
specialty ingredients unit, the company said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
