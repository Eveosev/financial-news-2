The ruble gained for the first time
in three days against the central bank’s dollar-euro basket as
oil,  Russia ’s chief export, headed for its highest level in more
than four months.  The currency appreciated 0.3 percent against the target
basket to 34.7715 by 7 p.m. in Moscow, weaker than the 34.65
level at which traders say the central bank intervenes to curb
gains that can be detrimental to export competitiveness. It
added 0.4 percent to 30.0595 versus the dollar and 0.1 percent
to 40.5305 relative to the euro.  Crude oil rose 0.6 percent in  New York  trading to $97.05
per barrel, its highest level on a closing basis since Sept. 14.
 Home prices  in 20 U.S. cities climbed by the most in more than
six years, signaling the country’s economic rebound is gaining
traction. Deputy Finance Minister Sergei Storchak said in Davos
last week that settlement through Euroclear may become available
by Jan. 30.  Investors should buy the ruble and Russia’s local currency
bonds as the country moves toward direct local debt settlement
through Euroclear Bank SA and Clearstream International SA,
Simon Quijano-Evans, an analyst at  ING Groep NV (INGA) , wrote in an e-
mailed note today. Russia will “still able to benefit from a
jump in flows as Euroclear and Clearstream enters into force,”
he said.  Euroclear Hostage  Yields on Russian government ruble notes advanced as some
investors took profit before Euroclear is introduced. The rate
on notes, known as OFZs, maturing in February 2027 rose two
basis points, or 0.02 percentage point, to 6.98 percent.  “Some people who bought bonds in November and December may
be taking profits,” Dmitry Trenin, the chief trader at Otkritie
Financial Corp., said by phone from Moscow.  The  Finance Ministry  will offer 20 billions rubles ($665
million) of OFZs maturing in January 2023 at 6.70 percent to
6.75 percent, according to guidance released today. The bonds
yielded 6.75 percent today. The ministry will also offer 7.3
billion rubles of debt due February 2019 at a 6.27 percent to
6.32 percent yield. It traded at 6.34 percent.  “The domestic  debt market  remains a hostage to the
Euroclear decision,” Sberbank CIB analysts said in an e-mailed
note. The analysts still expect settlement to start in the first
10 days of February.  Bank Rossii bought 4.62 billion rubles of foreign currency
on Jan. 24 and Jan. 25 to curb the ruble’s gain, according to
central bank data. That is in addition to about 15.3 billion
rubles it spent at the start of the year, the data show. Ruble
futures for March settlement showed the Russian currency at
30.37 per dollar.  “We don’t expect drastic changes in the ruble rate,” Anna
Bogdyukevich, an analyst at Aton Capital, said by phone from
Moscow. “We see the level around 30 rubles” to the dollar in
the near future, Bogdyukevich said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
