Fidelity Investments, the second-
biggest U.S. mutual-fund company, raised $700 million in senior,
unsecured long-term debt.  Fidelity sold $400 million in 20-year bonds paying 4.95
percent interest at an issue price of 99.874, and $300 million
in 30-year bonds paying 5.15 percent at an issue price of
99.848, Vincent Loporchio, a spokesman for the Boston-based
company, said today in an interview. Proceeds will be used for
general corporate purposes including continued investment in
existing businesses and potential acquisitions.  Led by Chief Executive Officer Edward C. “Ned” Johnson III, 82, and his daughter Abigail Johnson, 51, Fidelity has lost
market share in recent years to rivals including Valley Forge,
Pennsylvania-based Vanguard Group Inc., known for its index-
based funds, and Pacific Investment Management Co. in Newport
Beach, California, home of bond picker  Bill Gross . Abigail
Johnson became the clear successor to her father in August when
she was promoted to president.  Fidelity last tapped the debt market in 2010, Loporchio
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
