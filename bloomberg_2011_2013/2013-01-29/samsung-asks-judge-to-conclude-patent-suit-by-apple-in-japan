Samsung Electronics Co. (005930) , the world’s
largest smartphone maker, asked a judge in  Japan  to dismiss
 Apple Inc. (AAPL) ’s appeal in a patent-infringement case won by the
South Korean company in August.  Samsung and Apple representatives made their first oral
arguments before Judge Shuhei Shiotsuki at the Intellectual
Property High Court in Tokyo today. The next round will be held
March 21, the judge said.  The case is one of  dozens  in which the world’s two largest
smartphone makers are using their patents to try to force each
other into changing products or removing some models from store
shelves. They are fighting for increased share of a mobile
device market that researcher Yankee Group expects to double to
$847 billion by 2016.  In August, the  Tokyo  District Court ruled that Suwon, South
Korea-based Samsung’s smartphones and a tablet computer didn’t
infringe on an Apple invention for synchronizing music and video
data with servers. Apple, the Cupertino, California-based maker
of iPhones, claimed that the Galaxy S, Galaxy Tab and Galaxy S
II infringed the patent on synchronization, and sought 100
million yen ($1.1 million) in damages, according to court
documents.  To contact the reporters on this story:
