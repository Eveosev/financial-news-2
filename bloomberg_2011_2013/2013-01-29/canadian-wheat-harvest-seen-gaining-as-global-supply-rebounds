Wheat production in  Canada , poised
to be this year’s third-largest shipper, will climb 4.8 percent
in 2013-2014 as planting expands, helping to increase global
supplies, according to government forecasts.  The country’s total harvest will rise to 28.5 million
metric tons in the year from Aug. 1, Agriculture & Agri-Food
Canada said in a report e-mailed today. That will be the second-
highest output, according to data from the  U.S. Department of
Agriculture . World supply will rise 31 million tons to 862
million tons in 2013-2014, the Canadian department said.  The Canadian government’s outlook adds to forecasts that
global supplies are poised to expand, potentially helping to
curb prices that rallied 21 percent in  Chicago  over the past
year as inventories dropped. World wheat production may rebound
to 694 million tons in 2013-2014,  Rich Nelson , chief strategist
at Allendale Inc., said on Jan. 26. The USDA has yet to issue
its outlook for the next harvest.  “The overall condition of the world winter-wheat crop in
the northern hemisphere is mostly good, with the major exception
of the U.S. hard-red winter crop, which is worse than a year ago
due to drought,” analyst Stan Skrypetz wrote in the report.
“Canadian wheat prices are forecast to decrease.”  The U.S. winter-wheat crop, dormant since November, is in
its worst  condition  since at least 1985, when record-keeping
began, amid persistent drought. The country is the world’s
largest wheat shipper.  Grain Shortage  Futures soared 19 percent in Chicago last year as meat
producers switched to using wheat in  animal feed , replacing corn
because of a global grain shortage. Wheat for delivery in March
traded little changed at $7.785 a bushel on the Chicago Board of
Trade at 3:08 p.m. in Singapore, while red spring wheat fell 0.3
percent to $8.6375 a bushel on the  Minneapolis Grain Exchange .  Canada’s  canola  production, the world’s largest after the
European Union, will rise 16 percent to 15.5 million tons in
2013-2014 as higher yields offset a decline in acreage, the
agency said in the report. Exports from the largest shipper,
will jump 14 percent to 8.2 million tons compared with a year
earlier, it said.  Barley output will expand to 9 million tons from 8 million
tons a year earlier, the department said. Exports will drop to
2.1 million tons from 2.3 million tons a year earlier as
domestic use increases, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
