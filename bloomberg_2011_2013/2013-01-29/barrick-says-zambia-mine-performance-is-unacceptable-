Barrick Gold Corp. (ABX)  said the Lumwana
copper mine, acquired as part of its C$7.3 billion ($7.4 billion)
takeover of Equinox Minerals in 2011, has disappointed because
of production costs.  “The short-term performance has been unacceptable,” Chief
Executive Officer Jamie Sokalsky said today at a conference in
Toronto organized by TD Securities Inc. “The initial
indications are that the life-of-mine costs are higher than
initially anticipated.”  Sokalsky, who took over as CEO in June, said the company is
updating its long-term plan for the Zambian mine and will
discuss its guidance on Feb. 14, when Barrick reports fourth-
quarter earnings.  Barrick may take a writedown on Lumwana for the quarter,
according to Greg Barnes, an analyst at TD Newcrest Inc. in
Toronto. The company has $3.5 billion of goodwill on its balance
sheet that’s associated with the Equinox deal, he said in a note
Jan. 18.  “We need to make sure the mine that we bought, the asset
that we bought, can deliver to the extent that we thought it
would when we bought it,” Sokalsky said to reporters after his
presentation.  “It’s not just about the short term,” he said. “This is
a 30-year plus mine life.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
