Brisbane faces water shortages after
floods muddied supplies, forcing the main treatment plant for
 Australia ’s third-most populous city to close.  The Mount Crosby Water Treatment Plant is off-line due to
“record turbidity levels” in the Brisbane River following the
passage of remnants of Tropical Cyclone Oswald, Seqwater Chief
Executive Officer Terri Benson said today in a  statement  on the
agency’s website. Seqwater is the government authority
responsible for managing water supplies in southeast Queensland.  The plant is the region’s largest, supplying the bulk of
drinking water for Brisbane, Ipswich and Logan. About 2.15
million people reside in the metropolitan Brisbane area.
Seqwater and Queensland Premier Campbell Newman urged residents
to conserve water supplies and use only what’s necessary.  “This water situation is serious,” Newman said today on
his  Twitter feed , which was linked to the Queensland
government’s website. “We are doing everything possible to
bring water in but we need the community’s help to save water.”  The turbidity in Queensland’s capital may take two days to
subside, according to Seqwater, which said high levels of
manganese in the water may cause discoloration. Newman’s team
posted a tweet on the premier’s feed saying while the water may
taste “different,” it is “safe to drink.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
