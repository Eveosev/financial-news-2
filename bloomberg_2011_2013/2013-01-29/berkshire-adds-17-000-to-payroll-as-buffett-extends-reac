Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (BRK/A)  added about
17,000 employees since the end of 2011 as Chairman and Chief
Executive Officer  Warren Buffett  expanded manufacturing, media,
insurance and retail operations.  Berkshire and its more than 70 operating subsidiaries have
about 288,000 workers, the Omaha, Nebraska-based firm said
yesterday in a regulatory filing. That’s 6.3 percent higher than
the 270,858 disclosed in the 2011  annual report .  Buffett’s willingness to invest in a variety of industries
has reduced Berkshire’s reliance on  insurance operations  and
made the firm one of the largest U.S. employers. Companies that
primarily sell insurance, such as  Travelers Cos. (TRV)  and  Chubb
Corp. (CB) , have trimmed staff in the five years through the end of
2011 as they returned capital to shareholders. Berkshire pays no
dividend and went decades without buying back shares.  Buffett has become more focused on “hard assets and older-
fashioned business,” such as railroads and manufacturing, said
Meyer Shields, an analyst at Stifel Nicolaus & Co.  Berkshire’s workforce has soared from about 147,000 a
decade ago as Buffett, 82, has made some of his largest
acquisitions, including the 2010 purchase of railroad Burlington
Northern Santa Fe for $26.5 billion and 2011’s addition of
chemical maker Lubrizol Corp. for about $9 billion.  “When you’re buying a company with a market value in the
billions or tens of billions, then you’re going to get
significant headcount associated with that,” Shields said.  Buffett also has empowered deputies to make deals to expand
their businesses. Berkshire managers including Lubrizol CEO
James Hambrick and Victor Mancinelli, who leads farm-product
unit CTB Inc., announced deals last year to expand operations in
the U.S. and Europe. Such “bolt-on” purchases cost Berkshire
about $1.8 billion in the nine months ended Sept. 30.  Party Supplies  Buffett also  acquired  more than 60 newspapers including the
Richmond Times-Dispatch and bought Oriental Trading Co., the
seller of party supplies. The billionaire has said he  prefers
buying companies  outright to investing in their stock.  The expansion means Buffett employs a growing share of U.S.
workers. There were about 134 million U.S. employees on non-farm
payrolls at the end of last year, compared with 130.2 million 10
years earlier, according to Labor Department data.  Job growth in the U.S. economy was 1.4 percent last year,
matching the gain of 2011. It was the best back-to-back reading
since 2005-2006.  Berkshire has advanced 9.3 percent this year in New York
trading, beating the 5.7 percent gain in the Standard & Poor’s
500 Index. Buffett’s company rallied 17 percent last year while
the index climbed 13 percent.  Real Estate  A rebounding U.S. residential real estate market has helped
Berkshire’s subsidiaries that make carpet, bricks, insulation
and other building products. Housing starts climbed to a  954,000
annual pace  in December, the highest level since 2008, Commerce
Department figures show.  Buffett cut the workforce in 2009 by more than 20,000 as
manufacturing and retail operations slumped amid a U.S.
recession.  “We will be adding people at some point, but we won’t do
it until we see the demand come back,” Buffett said in a 2009
interview conducted by the CEO of Business Wire, the Berkshire
unit that posts corporate press releases. “It’ll be a little
slow because we don’t want to go through what we did before.
Although, I will guarantee you that three years from now, our
brick companies, our carpet company, and our insulation company
will all be employing far more people than now.”  The latest disclosure, in a filing tied to  debt issuance ,
didn’t break down employment by unit. The 2011 annual report,
issued February of last year, showed 39,000 workers at the
railroad, more than 27,000 at Fruit of the Loom, about 26,000 at
auto-insurer Geico and 22,650 at carpet maker Shaw.  Geico said in December that it was planning to hire more
than 4,000 new employees in 2013 after expanding its payroll by
almost 20 percent in the last five years.  To contact the reporter on this story:
