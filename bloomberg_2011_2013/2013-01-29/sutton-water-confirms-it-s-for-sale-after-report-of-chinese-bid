Sutton & East Surrey Water Plc , a
utility based in southeastern  England , confirmed it was for sale
after a U.K. newspaper reported  China ’s Beijing Water Authority
may buy the company.  “Our shareholders expect to attract interest from
investors with a similar outlook seeking to invest for the long
term,” Anthony Ferrar, managing director of the utility, said
today by e-mail.  Citigroup Inc. (C)  is managing the sale, he said,
declining to comment on any interest from potential buyers.  The Sunday Times said Jan. 27 that the Beijing Water
Authority is poised to buy the Redhill-based utility for 300
million pounds ($472 million). The Chinese company has hired
HSBC Holdings Plc to advise on the purchase, the newspaper
reported, without saying where it got the information.  HSBC and Citigroup declined to comment, and a call to
Beijing Water wasn’t answered after regular business hours.  Sutton & East Surrey Water has 655,000 customers in east
Surrey, West Sussex, west Kent and south  London . Investors in
the closely held company comprise a “small number” of pension
funds and asset managers, Ferrar said.  China already invests in the U.K. water industry through
China Investment Corp.’s 9 percent stake in Thames Water, the
U.K.’s biggest water provider by customers. Hong Kong-based
billionaire  Li Ka-shing  agreed to pay 645 million pounds for
Wales & West Utilities Ltd. in July and led the $3.9 billion
acquisition of Northumbrian Water Group Plc in 2011.  To contact the reporter on this story:
