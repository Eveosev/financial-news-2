Poland’s economy grew at the slowest
pace in three years in 2012 as the euro-area slump damped
 consumer spending , increasing pressure on the central bank to
keep cutting  interest rates .  Gross domestic product  advanced  2 percent from a year
earlier, when it climbed 4.3 percent, the  Central Statistical
Office  said in a preliminary report in Warsaw today. That
matched the median estimate of 36 economists surveyed by
Bloomberg. The annual pace was the slowest since 2009, when GDP
rose 1.6 percent.  Consumer spending, responsible for 62 percent of GDP, is
weakening as companies cut jobs and wages amid a recession in
the 17-nation euro area, where the European Union’s largest
eastern economy sells most of its exports. While the central
bank has  reduced rates  by 75 basis points in the last three
months, it’s signaled a possible pause in the easing even as its
forecasts GDP slowing to 1.5 percent this year, the weakest
since 2002.  Today’s data “masks a slump in domestic demand toward the
end of last year that has seen household spending drop to its
slowest rate since the early 1990s,”  Neil Shearing , chief
emerging-markets economist at Capital Economics Ltd. in London,
said in an e-mailed note. “This strengthens the case for
further policy easing.”  Zloty Weakens  The zloty touched a four-year low against the euro last
week after the central bank cut its benchmark to 4 percent on
Jan. 9. The currency, which has weakened 2.7 percent since the
start of 2013, traded at 4.2007 at 11:31 a.m. in Warsaw, little
changed on the day.  Consumer spending increased 0.5 percent last year from 2.5
percent in 2011, the weakest since at least 2001, today’s report
showed. In December, employment fell for a second month,
industrial output had its biggest slump in more than three years
and retail sales fell the most since 2005. The  jobless rate  rose
to 13.4 percent, the highest in almost a year.  Exports increased 4.1 percent in the 11 months through
November, compared with a 13.3 percent gain a year earlier.
Exports to the euro area shrank to 52 percent of total foreign
sales from 54.3 percent a year earlier.  Poland ’s central should continue to lower borrowing costs
and the zloty won’t weaken much as the economy picks up in the
second half of 2013, Anna Zielinska-Glebocka, a member of the
Monetary Policy Council, said in an interview today on TVN CNBC
television. Fourth-quarter GDP growth slowed to between 0.5
percent and 0.6 percent, she said on TVN CNBC.  Job Losses  Fiat SpA, Italy’s biggest manufacturer, announced on Dec. 7
it will dismiss 1,500 Polish workers as Europe’s car market
heads toward a 17-year low. Tauron SA, Poland’s second-biggest
utility, said last week it will seek 3,180 jobs by 2015. TPSA,
the largest telecommunications company in Poland, plans to cut
760 jobs, according to a Jan. 15 report on website Telepolis.pl.  The slowdown will be “worse” and last “a little longer”
than in 2009, when Poland was the only economy in the EU to
avoid a recession, MPC member  Jerzy Hausner  said Jan. 24.  Elsewhere today,  India  lowered interest rates for the first
time since April and cut the amount of deposits lenders must set
aside as reserves, easing policy to revive growth as inflation
cools and the government curbs the  budget deficit .  The  Reserve Bank  of India reduced the repurchase rate to
7.75 percent from 8 percent, as predicted by 30 of 35 analysts
in a Bloomberg News survey. Governor Duvvuri Subbarao also cut
the  cash reserve ratio  to 4 percent from 4.25 percent, effective
Feb. 9, adding 180 billion rupees ($3.4 billion) into the
banking system.  Rate Cuts  India becomes the first major Asian economy to ease
borrowing costs in 2013, after inflation moderated to a three-
year low and the government called for cheaper credit as it vows
prudence in next month’s budget to damp price pressures. The
central bank cut the inflation forecast to 6.8 percent and said
there’s space, “albeit limited,” to support a faltering
economy. It estimated a record current-gap will widen further.  Growth will be 5.5 percent in the year through March 2013,
below an earlier estimate of 5.8 percent, the Reserve Bank said.
That would be the slowest since 2002-2003.  In  New Zealand , a government report showed the nation’s
annual trade deficit unexpectedly narrowed in December. In
 Australia , a private report showed business confidence for
December rebounded by the most since 2001.  A report in  Spain  showed a further decline in retail sales
last month. In  Germany ,  consumer confidence  will climb in
February due to a stable labor market and higher income
expectations, market research company  Gfk SE (GFK)  said.  In the U.S., private reports may show  home prices  in
November posted their biggest year-on-year advance since 2006,
while  consumer confidence  as measured by the New York-based
Conference Board likely weakened in January for a third straight
month, according to surveys.  To contact the reporter on this story:
