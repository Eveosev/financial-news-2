Trinidad and Tobago will allow
onshore oil bids next month as it seeks to ramp up production on
the Caribbean island, Energy Minister Kevin Ramnarine said.  At least three blocks will be opened up for auction by the
middle of February, Ramnarine said yesterday in a speech in Port
of Spain.  “The land based bid round is the first since the late
1990s and is a key component in our strategy to arrest the
decline in oil production,” Ramnarine said, according to a
transcript of the  speech  posted on the Ministry’s website today.
