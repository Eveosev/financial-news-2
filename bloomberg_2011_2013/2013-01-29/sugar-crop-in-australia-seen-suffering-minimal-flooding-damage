Sugar production in  Australia , the
world’s third-biggest exporter, will not be significantly
affected even as some areas sustained damage from floods caused
by ex-tropical cyclone Oswald, according to a producers’ group.  Some crops in the Bundaberg, Maryborough and Childers areas
in Queensland state may have been damaged, Canegrowers Chief
Executive Officer Steve Greenwood said in an e-mailed  statement 
today. Other regions are reporting the rain provided much-needed
moisture for this year’s crop, he said.  Australia harvested about 30 million metric tons of cane in
2012 as production rebounded from cyclone damage and wet weather
that had curbed output for two seasons, according to the
Brisbane-based group. The 2013  harvest  may total as much as 32
million tons, it said Dec. 20. Raw sugar exports may gain 12
percent in the year started July 1, the Australian Bureau of
Agricultural and Resource Economics and Sciences estimates.  “Early indications suggest that even though individual
areas and farms have been ravaged, Australia’s production
overall is not expected to be significantly downgraded,” said
Greenwood. “With the flood waters still up, it is still too
early to determine the full extent of the damage.” Canegrowers
represents about 80 percent of the Australia’s growers.  To contact the reporter for this story:
