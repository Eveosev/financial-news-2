National Bank of Abu Dhabi PJSC , the
United Arab Emirates’ second-biggest lender by assets, plans to
sell bonds after reporting a higher-than-expected increase in
fourth-quarter profit.  Net income rose to 1.12 billion dirhams ($305 million) from
724 million dirhams a year earlier, the Abu Dhabi-based bank
said today in a statement. That beat the median 878 million-
dirham estimate of six analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. Full-year
profit climbed 17 percent to 4.3 billion dirhams, it said.  “Our growth was a result of the success of our diversified
business model, investment gains driven by favorable financial
market conditions and successful hedging strategies,” Chief
Executive Officer Michael Tomalin said in the statement.  Banks in the U.A.E. are recovering from the credit crisis,
which slowed lending, hurt investment banking and sparked a
crash in property prices. National Bank reported full-year
investment gains of 537 million dirhams, while impairment
charges fell 24 percent to 365 million dirhams in the fourth
quarter.  Net interest income and net income from Islamic financing
for the year rose 5 percent to 6.1 billion dirhams. National
Bank’s non-performing loans increased to 3.4 percent of total
lending, or 5.8 billion dirhams by the end of 2012.  Lending was “slower than anticipated” and grew 3.2
percent to 164.6 billion at the end of the year, it said.  Bond Sales  National Bank will seek shareholder approval on March 12
for the sale of $500 million of convertible bonds, it said in a
separate statement today. The lender will also seek approval to
raise the size of its euro medium-term note program to $7.5
billion from $5 billion, the size of its Malaysian ringgit
program to 5 billion ringgit ($1.6 billion) from 3 billion
ringgit and its samurai program to 150 billion yen ($1.7
billion) from 40 billion yen.  In December, the bank registered to sell as much as 40
billion yen of Samurai bonds and the same amount of uridashi
bonds, according to filings with Japan’s Finance Ministry.  The board proposed a 35 fils amsg share cash dividend and a
stock dividend of one bonus share for every 10 held for 2012.
National Bank’s shares were suspended today pending the earnings
announcement. They have gained 7.8 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
