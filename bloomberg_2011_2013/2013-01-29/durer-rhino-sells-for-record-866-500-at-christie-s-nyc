A 1515 woodcut by Albrecht Durer
titled “The Rhinoceros” sold for $866,500 at Christie’s in  New
York  today, setting an auction record for the German Renaissance
artist.  The sale toppled a record set minutes earlier for a circa-
1501 engraving titled “Saint Eustace” that went for $722,500.  The previous record for Durer was 409,250 pounds ($653,336
at the time) for a work titled “Adam and Eve” that sold in
2011.  The latest works were part of a 62-lot sale of Durer prints
consigned by an anonymous European collector who put it together
over four decades.  “He really assembled the collection piece by piece, with a
lot of passion and knowledge and also with a lot of money, it
has to be said,” said Tim Schmelcher, director of Christie’s
prints department in  London . “He always bought the very best he
could obtain. Money was no object.”  Christie’s offered the seller of the collection an
undisclosed amount, guaranteeing the sale.  Muse highlights include  Craig Seligman  on  books ,  Rich
Jaroslovsky  on  technology .  To contact the reporters of this story:
