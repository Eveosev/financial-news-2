Egypt  will spend $1.5 billion to
revamp its refineries over the next two years and increase
annual fuel output by as much as 6 million metric tons, Oil
Minister Osama Kamal said.  Actual production from the nation’s refineries is 24
million to 25 million metric tons a year compared with maximum
processing capacity of 36 million to 37 million tons, Kamal said
at a media conference Jan. 27. While half of that unused output
could be upgraded, the other half is outdated and can’t be made
operational, he said.  “After some incidents took place, urgent funds of $500
million have been earmarked to enact safety-operation
procedures,” Kamal said. “Between 5 to 6 million tons of
production could be added to ease the situation over the next
two years with investments of $1 billion.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
