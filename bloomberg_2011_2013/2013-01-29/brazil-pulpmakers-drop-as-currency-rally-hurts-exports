Fibria Celulose SA (FIBR3)  and  Suzano Papel
& Celulose SA (SUZB5) , Brazil’s two largest pulpmakers, led losses in
Sao Paulo on expectation a strengthening currency will reduce
profit from exports.  Suzano slumped 3.6 percent to 7.29 reais at 12:15 p.m. in
Sao Paulo after declining 4.5 percent, the most intraday since
Dec. 13. Fibria, the world’s largest pulp producer, slid 2.3
percent to 24.09 reais. The benchmark Bovespa index fell 0.1
percent.  The Brazilian real rallied yesterday beyond 2 per U.S.
dollar for the first time in almost seven months amid central
bank efforts to shore up the currency and tame inflation.  “Pulpmakers rely heavily on exports, and the current
scenario suggests exports won’t be as competitive as previously
expected,” Luiz Roberto Monteiro, a broker at Renascenca DTVM,
said in a telephone interview from  Sao Paulo .  Fibria gets about 85 percent of its revenue from exports
and Suzano’s shipments abroad account for more than half its
sales, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
