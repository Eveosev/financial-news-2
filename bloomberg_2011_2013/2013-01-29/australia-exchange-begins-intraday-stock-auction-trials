ASX Ltd. (ASX) , the operator of
 Australia ’s biggest exchange, has introduced intra-day  stock
auctions  for some less actively traded companies, according to a
statement from the exchange.  The auctions will use computer algorithms to match as many
buyers and sellers of stocks at a specific time in the same way
opening and closing prices are determined at the exchange. They
will be held from noon to 12:05 p.m. and 2 p.m. to 2:05 p.m. for 
38 companies .  The auctions, intended to narrow spreads by bringing buyers
and sellers together at a specific time, are part of several
reforms ASX has made to its trading platform since Chi-X
Australia Pty became its first competitor in 2011. Traditional
exchanges worldwide are losing market share to so-called dark
pools and other alternative trading venues.  “Instead of having liquidity spread over the full day with
very sparse trading and sometimes missed opportunities,
investors can now look to specific points in time with hopefully
greater trading activity,” Ofir Gefen, head of Asia Pacific
electronic brokerage and analytics at New York-based broker
Investment Technology Group Inc., said in an e-mail Jan. 28.
“That would lead to lower spreads and better price discovery
for these sparsely traded stocks,’  If the three-month trial is successful, ASX will consider
expanding the program to all companies not included in the
 S&P/ASX 300 Index. (AS52)  The London Stock Exchange already holds
intra-day auctions for less-traded stocks, hosting four a day.  To contact the reporter on this story:
