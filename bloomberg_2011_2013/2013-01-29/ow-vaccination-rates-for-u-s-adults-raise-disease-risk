Vaccination rates for diseases
including pneumonia, shingles and human papillomavirus are
“unacceptably low” among adults, U.S. health authorities said.  About 20 percent of U.S. adults younger than age 65 are
vaccinated against pneumococcal diseases, the Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention said today in a report. The
illnesses killed about 50,000 people in 2010. About 16 percent
of adults 60 and older are vaccinated against shingles.  Rates aren’t much better for vaccination against human
papillomavirus, which can cause cervical cancer in women and
malignancies of the penis and anus in men. About 30 percent of
women ages 19 to 26 have received the HPV vaccine and 2.1
percent of men in the same age group. The CDC is calling for
greater public education about vaccines and for health-care
providers to more frequently recommend them to patients.  “Too few adults are taking advantage of protection from
vaccines, leaving themselves and those around them at greater
risk for vaccine-preventable diseases,” said Howard Koh,
assistant secretary for health at the  Department of Health  and
Human Services.  The CDC wants 60 percent of adults -- and 90 percent of
those older than 65 -- to be vaccinated against pneumonia, said
Carolyn Bridges, associate director for adult immunization at
the agency.  HPV Shots  There was “little progress” in adult vaccine rates from
2010 to 2011, Bridges said, except for HPV. There was a nine-
percentage-point increase in the number of young women
vaccinated against the virus in 2011, she said. HPV causes about
70 percent of cervical cancers, she said.  The government didn’t recommend HPV vaccination for males
until late 2011.  There were an estimated 42,000 U.S. cases of pertussis,
known as whooping cough, in 2012, the most since 1955, Koh said.
Eighteen people died of the disease, most of them infants. About
13 percent of adults younger than 65 have received a combined
vaccine for tetanus and pertussis, according to the CDC.  “When the source is identified, four out of five babies
who got whooping cough caught it from someone in their home,”
Koh said today during a conference call.  The 2010 health-care law, the Affordable Care Act, allows
people with insurance to receive government-recommended vaccines
at no out-of-pocket cost, Koh said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
