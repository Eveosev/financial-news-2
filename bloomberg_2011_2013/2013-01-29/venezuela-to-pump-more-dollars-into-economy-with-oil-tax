Venezuela will channel more
resources from its oil exports to the central bank this year as
it seeks to alleviate a shortage of dollars that has crimped
imports, Oil Minister  Rafael Ramirez  said yesterday.  The government plans to reduce levies on the oil industry
by changing rules on the so-called windfall tax that will now
only be triggered on  oil prices  above $80 a barrel, instead of
$70 a barrel. The move will reduce funding to President  Hugo Chavez ’s off-budget development fund known as Fonden and pump
more dollars into the central bank, Ramirez said. The changes
need to be approved by Congress.  The measure is part of an economic growth plan approved by
Chavez as he undergoes treatment for an undisclosed type of
cancer in Cuba, the minister said. A shortage of foreign
currency led to a 53 percent plunge in the bolivar to 18.35 per
 U.S. dollar  in the black market in the past year, stoking
inflation and fueling shortages of staple goods such as chicken,
milk and corn flour.  “We are making every effort to make an adjustment to the
distribution of foreign currency to attend to the demands of our
country,” Ramirez said yesterday at a news conference in
Caracas. The measure was taken to “increase the availability of
foreign currency and relieve tension on our currency created
principally by the speculative sector.”  ‘Timid Measures’  Yesterday’s announcement shows that the government will
enact only timid economic measures and isn’t likely to devalue
the bolivar given the country’s political uncertainty, analysts
at Eurasia Group, a New York-based consulting company, wrote in
a report. While the measure should help reduce shortages and
rein in inflation, they won’t improve the state oil company’s
cash flow or ability to invest.  “The measures announced imply that the government has no
political incentives to make any material economic adjustments
and instead will maintain the current system, potentially
tweaking policy at the margin,” Eurasia Group analysts Risa Grais-Targow and  Daniel Kerner  wrote in a report yesterday.  The tax changes will increase state oil company Petroleos
de Venezuela SA’s cash flow by $1.42 billion this year and
increase the amount of dollars it sells to the central bank by
$2.47 billion, Ramirez said. Fonden received about $15.5 billion
last year from PDVSA, as the Caracas-based company is known, and
will get about $12.6 billion this year with the updated tax
plan.  PDVSA will sell a total of about $49 billion to the central
bank this year, Ramirez said, adding that he would not comment
on the country’s exchange rate policy.   The state oil company “and its partners are unlikely to
benefit from the reform, since PDVSA will not have more funds
with which to invest and, rather than benefitting from a
devaluation,” will have to sell dollars at the regulated rate,
Eurasia Group’s Grais-Targow and Kerner said.  Black Market  Venezuelans use the black market when they can’t get access
to the central bank’s Sitme exchange, which sells dollars to
businesses for 5.3 bolivars, or the so-called Cadivi system that
sells dollars at 4.3 bolivars for priority imports.  The tax changes will allow PDVSA to increase inflows of
currency as well as oil output, said Jose Luis Saboin, an
economist with Caracas-based financial consultancy Ecoanalitica.  “In the short term, the central bank will have more room
for maneuver and a better capacity to provide funds to Cadivi,”
he said in a telephone interview.  Venezuela  has also proposed payment changes to the
Petrocaribe accord that provides subsidized oil to Central
American and Caribbean countries, Ramirez told reporters
yesterday in Caracas without providing additional information.  PDVSA has no plans to issue dollar bonds this year, Ramirez
told reporters, adding that the company had previously issued
dollar bonds to supply the Sitme market.  No Bonds  “We’re not selling any bonds,” said Ramirez. “It doesn’t
make economic sense for us to continue issuing debt in dollars
to obtain bolivars. It’s a mechanism to supply the Sitme, and
we’re not going to keep doing it. Sitme forces us to issue at a
rate that makes international loans more expensive.”  Venezuela will maintain its preference for issuing local
over foreign debt in 2013, Finance Minister  Jorge Giordani  said
last month. The country hasn’t offered bonds denominated in
dollars since 2011, when it issued a total of $7.2 billion,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. PDVSA,  South America ’s
largest oil producer, last sold dollar-denominated debt in May.  PDVSA said Jan. 22 that its total debt climbed 15 percent
to $40 billion last year. The company’s debt soared 40 percent
in 2011 when it issued $10 billion of dollar bonds.  China, Russia  Venezuela needs oil at around $100 a barrel because of
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries’ production
quotas, Ramirez told reporters yesterday in Caracas.  The South American country is developing plans to expand
its gold  mining industry  and is in talks with  China ’s Citic
Group Corp and South African companies to do so, Ramirez said.
Chavez approved the transfer of areas holding 81.3 million
ounces of gold to a state mining company controlled by PDVSA,
the company said in a statement yesterday.  PDVSA will host a trade delegation of Russian  oil companies 
today including  Igor Sechin , the Chief Executive Officer of
 Rosneft OAO (ROSN) , he said.  Ramirez denied a Bloomberg News report published Jan. 25
that said foreign oil companies were slowing investments in the
country over the uncertainty surrounding Chavez’s health.  “Ask Sechin. It’s false. Everyone is here, and we’re all
working,” said Ramirez. “The oil business has never been easy,
but there’s always a pulse because it’s a great business. The
resource is ours, and we’ll enforce our laws. People can decide
to invest here or elsewhere. Let everyone take their own
risks.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
