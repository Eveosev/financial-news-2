The International Monetary Fund is
likely to pare its forecast for South Korea’s economic growth
for 2013, catching up with reductions by the nation’s central
bank and finance ministry.  The full-year expansion may be about 3 percent, compared
with a 3.9 percent estimate in September last year, country
mission chief Hoe Ee Khor said in an interview in Seoul after
meeting with South Korean officials last week. He didn’t say
when a new estimate may be released.  South Korea’s government is frontloading budget spending in
the first half of this year to spur the nation’s expansion as
gains in the won and a slide in the yen threaten to crimp
exports. Paring the forecast would bring the IMF closer to the
central bank’s prediction of 2.8 percent growth and the finance
ministry’s 3 percent estimate.  The won has gained more than 21 percent against the yen in
the past year, aiding Japanese exporters of cars and electronics
that compete with South Korean companies. The won traded at
12.03 per yen as of 9:27 a.m. in Seoul today.  Khor said Asia’s fourth-biggest economy remains “very
strong” and less vulnerable to shocks than in the past.  Growth was 1.5 percent in the fourth quarter from a year
earlier, matching a third-quarter pace that was the slowest
since 2009.  To contact the reporter on this story:
