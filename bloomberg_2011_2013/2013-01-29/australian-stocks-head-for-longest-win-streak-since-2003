Australian stocks rose, with the
benchmark poised for its longest winning streak since 2003, as
higher metals prices boosted mining companies. Japanese stock
futures were little changed.  BHP Billiton Ltd. (BHP) , the world’s largest mining company,
gained 0.9 percent. American Depositary Receipts of Komatsu Ltd.
lost 2.6 percent as the world’s second-biggest maker of
excavators and dump trucks cut its full-year earnings forecast
on slumping sales in Southeast Asia and China.  Softbank Corp. (9984) 
shares may gain after Dish Network Corp. said it won’t seek
regulatory action to block its purchase of Sprint Nextel Corp.
Yahoo Japan Corp. shares may be active after increasing sales
and profits forecasts.  Futures on Japan’s  Nikkei 225 Stock Average (NKY)  expiring in
March closed at 10,900 in Chicago yesterday, up from 10,890 at
the close in  Osaka . They were bid in the pre-market at 10,890 in
Osaka at 8:05 a.m.  Australia ’s  S&P/ASX 200 Index (AS51)  gained 0.2
percent, gaining for a tenth day. New Zealand’s NZX 50 Index
gained 0.4 percent.  “The pain trade is fear that you are going to miss out on
the rally,” said Bob Van Munster, head of Australian equities
at Tyndall Investment Management Ltd. in Sydney, which oversees
about $24 billion. “Corporates will still be very circumspect
and cautious. The market can’t push on without earnings
upgrades.”  Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 is poised for its longest rising
streak since October 2003. Investors are moving into equities as
the Reserve Bank of Australia undertakes the most aggressive
interest-rate cuts among advanced economies, sapping the allure
of bonds as yields decline. The S&P/ASX 200’s forecast dividend
yield of 4.5 is the highest among the world’s 10 largest equity
markets, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Futures on the  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index (SPX)  were little
changed today. The gauge yesterday climbed 0.5 percent and the
Dow Jones Industrial Average advanced to a five-year high as
companies including Pfizer Inc. and Valero Energy Corp. beat
earnings estimates.  The  Bloomberg China-US Equity Index (CH55BN)  of the most-traded
Chinese shares in the U.S. rose 0.9 percent to 100.61 in New
York yesterday.  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index, the benchmark regional
equities gauge, traded at 14.4 times average estimated earnings
compared with 13.6 for the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index and 12.3
for the Stoxx Europe 600 Index, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
