Canaccord Financial Inc. (CF) ,  Canada â€™s
largest non-bank brokerage, fell the most in five months after a
Bank of Nova Scotia analyst downgraded the shares.  Canaccord fell 6.4 percent to C$7.15 at 1:23 p.m. in
Toronto. Earlier it touched C$7.02, the biggest intraday drop
since Aug. 9. About 117,000 shares changed hands, 61 percent of
the three-month daily average.  Phil Hardie, an analyst at Scotiabank Global Banking and
Markets, downgraded the shares of Toronto-based Canaccord to
sector perform, the equivalent of a hold. Hardie, the No. 1-
ranked analyst on the stock according to the Bloomberg Absolute
Return Rank, declined to immediately share the research report,
citing company policy.  Canaccord will post  results  for its fiscal third quarter on
Feb. 6. The brokerage posted its third straight quarterly loss
in November as it absorbed costs from closing wealth-management
offices as equity-trading volumes slumped.  Canaccord is  expected  to earn 15 cents a share in the third
quarter, the average estimate of three analysts polled by
Bloomberg. That compares to 1 cent a share in the previous
period.  Scott Davidson, a Canaccord spokesman, declined to comment
on the stock decline.  To contact the reporters on this story:
