Index of 24  raw materials  rose 0.8 percent to settle at 670.51
at 3:53 p.m. New York time, led by cotton.  The UBS Bloomberg CMCI gauge of 26  prices  advanced 0.5
percent to 1,601.43.  SOFT COMMODITIES  Cotton rallied, heading for the biggest monthly gain in
almost two years, on mounting concern that output will drop in
the U.S., the world’s biggest exporter.  Planting in the U.S. probably will plunge 16 percent this
year to 10.32 million acres as farmers shift to more-profitable
crops, including corn and soybeans, according to a Bloomberg
survey. While cotton futures are up 28 percent since reaching a
31-month low in June, prices are still less than half of the
record reached in 2011 because of a global surplus.  On ICE Futures U.S. in  New York , cotton for March delivery

since Jan. 15.  Silver futures for March delivery rose 1.3 percent to

in 20 U.S. cities climbed, signaling that the country’s economic

rally since July 2009, on speculation that U.S. East Coast
refinery shutdowns will tighten supplies.  On the Nymex, gasoline futures for February delivery
climbed 1.3 percent to $2.9734 a gallon. Prices have advanced
9.9 percent since Jan. 15.  Heating-oil futures for February delivery gained 1.6
percent to $3.1092 a gallon.  GRAINS, OILSEEDS  Soybeans gained for the third straight session, the longest
rally in seven weeks, and corn rose on speculation that dry,
warm weather in early February will reduce Argentina crop

percent to $3.226 per million British thermal units, the lowest
settlement since Jan. 10.  U.K. gas fell for the second day as warmer-than-average

p.m. London time. Month-ahead gas fell 1 percent to 66.35 pence
a therm. That’s equivalent to $10.45 per million Btu.  To contact the reporter on this story:
