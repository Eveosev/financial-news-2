industry wide internal rate of return between 15%-25% over the
next 5 yrs

Asean Economic Community

relatively small population and higher proportion of “sub-scale
and domestically oriented manufacturing companies”

Community by the end of 2015, where members will eliminate trade
barriers for goods and services
