Fraser & Neave Ltd. (FNN)  said its entire
board plans to resign from the property and soft-drink company
after the close of Thai billionaire Charoen Sirivadhanabhakdi’s
takeover offer.  The directors are “committed” to an orderly transition
and will consult with Charoen’s TCC Assets to appoint three
additional board members when the bid becomes unconditional,
Singapore-based F&N said in a filing today. The offer is due to
close at 5:30 p.m.  Singapore  time on Feb. 4.  Charoen’s TCC Assets raised its bid for F&N to S$9.55 a
share on Jan. 18, valuing the company at S$13.8 billion ($11.2
billion), to top an an offer led by  Overseas Union Enterprise
Ltd. (OUE) , which later decided not to increase its S$9.08 a share
proposal. TCC Assets yesterday said it owned 45.61 percent of
the company.  F&N Chairman Lee Hsien Yang, the younger brother of
Singapore Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong, and three other
directors plan to sell their shares to TCC after adviser
 JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM)  said the offer was “fair.”  The four directors are the only members of the nine-person
board to directly hold shares in the company, according to
Elaine Lim, a spokeswoman for F&N in Singapore.  To contact the reporters on this story:
