Sterlite Industries (India) Ltd. (STLT) ,
the nation’s top copper producer, failed to meet analysts’
forecast for its third-quarter profit because of higher costs
and lower income from selling the metal used to make cables.  Group  net income  rose to 11.9 billion rupees ($222
million), or 3.54 rupees a share, in the three months ended Dec.

the  Vedanta Resources Plc (VED)  unit said today in a statement to
 stock exchanges . The median profit of 26 analyst estimates
compiled by Bloomberg was 13.9 billion rupees. Sales gained 4.2
percent to 106.9 billion rupees.  Sterlite’s raw material costs jumped 14 percent to 54.6
billion rupees, while total expenses increased 2.9 percent to
90.1 billion rupees in the period. The profit before tax from
its copper business fell 54 percent to 1.6 billion rupees. A 6.6
percent drop in aluminum prices also affected profitability.  On Jan. 18, Sterlite unit  Hindustan Zinc Ltd. (HZ) , the nation’s
largest producer of the metal, reported a 27 percent gain in
profit in the last quarter on higher silver and lead production.  Sterlite  fell  0.7 percent to 113.25 rupees at close in
