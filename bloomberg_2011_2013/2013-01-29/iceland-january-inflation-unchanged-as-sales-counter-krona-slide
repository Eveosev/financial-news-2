Icelandâ€™s annual inflation rate was
unchanged this month as seasonal sales prevented a continued
slide in the krona from raising prices, reducing pressure on the
central bank to boost interest rates.  Inflation held at an annual 4.2 percent in January,
Reykjavik-based  Statistics Iceland  said today on its website.
Consumer prices rose 0.3 percent in the month, the agency said.  The  central bank  last month kept its benchmark rate at 6
percent as policy makers try to support the krona while they
scale back currency restrictions. The bank, which targets 2.5
percent inflation, forecasts that inflation will average 3.6
this year and slow to 2.7 percent in 2014.  Iceland imposed currency restrictions in 2008 following the
failure of  Kaupthing Bank hf ,  Glitnir Bank hf  and  Landsbanki
Islands hf  after the krona sank 80 percent against the euro
offshore. Arion Bank hf, the state-created successor to
Kaupthing, has estimated the controls are stopping as much as $8
billion in offshore krona assets from being sold.  To contact the reporter on this story:
