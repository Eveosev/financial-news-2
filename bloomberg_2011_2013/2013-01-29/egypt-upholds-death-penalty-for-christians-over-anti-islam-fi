An Egyptian court has upheld death
sentences in absentia for seven Coptic Christians on charges
linked to an anti-Islam film that sparked riots in parts of the
Muslim world.  The Florida-based American pastor Terry Jones was sentenced
to five years in jail, also in absentia and in connection with
the film, though his role in it wasnâ€™t specified, the criminal
court in Cairo said in a faxed statement today.  The defendants were found guilty in November of harming
national unity and insulting and publicly attacking Islam.  To contact the reporter on this story:
