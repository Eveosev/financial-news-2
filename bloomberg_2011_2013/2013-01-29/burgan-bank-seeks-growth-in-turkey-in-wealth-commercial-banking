Burgan Bank SAK (BURG) , Kuwait’s third-
largest lender by assets, is seeking to expand in Turkey, Chief
Executive Officer Eduardo Eguren said.  “The opportunity to grow inorganically will come when we
have a profitable proposition,” he said in an interview in
Istanbul yesterday.  Burgan Bank SAK is also interested in acquisitions in the
Asian market, Eguren said. The bank bought 99.3 percent of
Istanbul-based Eurobank Tekfen AS from  Greece ’s Eurobank
Ergasias SA on Dec. 21 in a 627 million-lira ($353.7 million)
deal. Burgan is also seeking to boost its loan book by 24
percent to 25 percent this year in Turkey to 4.5 billion liras,
concentrating on small and-medium-sized businesses,  wealth
management  and commercial banking, Eguren said.  Persian Gulf lenders are seeking opportunities to expand in
 Turkey . Commercial Bank of Qatar QSC started talks to buy 75
percent of Turkey’s Alternatifbank AS and aims to complete
discussions in March, the lender said. Qatar National Bank SAQ,
the Middle East’s biggest lender, may be targeting Finansbank
AS, owned by National Bank of Greece SA, according to analysts
