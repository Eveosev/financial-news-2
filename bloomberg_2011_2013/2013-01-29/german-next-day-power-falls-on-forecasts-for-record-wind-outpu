German electricity for next-day
delivery fell as wind generation is forecast to rise to a record
tomorrow.  Baseload German day-ahead power, for delivery around the
clock, slid as much as 19 percent as  Meteologica SA  predicted
wind generation to climb to about 25,000 megawatts tomorrow.  The contract declined as much as 6.25 euros to 26.25 euros
($35.27) a megawatt-hour and was at 27.75 euros at 9:56 a.m.
Berlin-time, according to broker data compiled by Bloomberg.  Wind generation was at 18,872 megawatts today compared with
a  record  22,299 megawatts on Jan. 3, 2012, according to data
from European Energy Exchange AG on Bloomberg.  German February power fell as much as 3.2 percent to a
record 42.75 euros while the French contract dropped as much as
1.7 percent to 50.70 euros a megawatt-hour.  RWE AG (RWE)  had an unplanned halt at its Gersteinwerk K2 coal-
fed power plant because of a boiler fault. The 608-megawatt unit
is scheduled to start tomorrow, the company said on its website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
