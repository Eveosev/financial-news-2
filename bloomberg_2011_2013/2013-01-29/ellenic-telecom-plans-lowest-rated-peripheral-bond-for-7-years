Hellenic Telecommunications
Organization SA (HTO)  is planning to sell the lowest-rated bonds from
a company in  Europe ’s periphery for at least seven years.  Greece ’s largest phone company, known as OTE, hired banks
for an investor call today ahead of an issue of five-year bonds
in euros, a person familiar with the deal said. The company’s
rated Caa1 at Moody’s Investors Service, seven steps below
investment grade.  OTE wants to sell debt so that it can redeem a 1.25
billion-euro ($1.7 billion) issue of notes coming due in August
and 500 million euros of securities due in 2014, the person
familiar with the deal said. The transaction is being marketed
as the cost of insuring junk debt climbed to the highest in two
weeks in the credit-default swaps market.  “Risk appetite is there, even for Greek names,” said
Dimitris Dalipis, a  fund manager  at Alpha Trust Mutual Fund
Management SA in  Athens , who owns OTE bonds. “There aren’t many
bonds you can find at decent yields these days, even in the
corporate high-yield space.”  OTE’s proposed deal will be the lowest rated from a non-
financial peripheral borrower since at least 2006, according to
Bloomberg data tracking benchmark-sized issues. The company has
four bonds outstanding, with one due to mature each year until
2016, Bloomberg data show.  Existing Bonds  Its 4.625 percent 2016 notes yield 492 basis points more
than the benchmark midswap rate, the lowest premium since June
2011, Bloomberg data show. Its 7.25 percent 2015 bonds yield 550
basis points more than swaps, the lowest since June 2011.  “Judging from their tender price and where the bond due
2016 is trading at the moment, the spread offered will have to
be quite above those to make it attractive,” said George Satlas, the Athens-based head of investments at Mutual Funds of
Postal Savings Bank and Hellenic Post.  Kelda Finance, a  division  of Bradford-based Kelda Group
Ltd., increased the size of its seven-year bond offering by 45
million pounds to 200 million pounds ($315 million), which it
may price tomorrow. Infinis Group, an  investment company  owned
by  Guy Hands ’s Terra Firma Capital Partners Ltd., will issue 350
million pounds ($550 million) of six-year high-yield notes after
a London roadshow Jan. 31. The Northampton, England-based
company is ranked B1 by Moody’s.  Cirsa Gaming  Cirsa Gaming Corp SA’s funding division Cirsa Funding
Luxembourg is marketing a 100 million-euro tap of the company’s
8.75 percent notes due 2018, while the European Financial
Stability Facility, the region’s temporary bailout fund, will
price 5 billion euros of five-year bonds to yield 17 basis
points more than the benchmark swaps rate, people with knowledge
of the deals said.  In credit derivatives markets, the Markit iTraxx Europe
Index of 125 companies with investment-grade ratings rose 3
basis points to 110 at 3:30 p.m. in  London , the highest level
this year.  The Markit iTraxx Crossover Index of credit-default swaps
on 50 companies with mostly high-yield ratings increased 12
basis points to 434. The Markit iTraxx Financial Index linked to
senior debt of 25 banks and insurers added four basis points to
reach 141.  A basis point on a credit-default swap protecting 10
million euros of debt from default for five years is equivalent
to 1,000 euros a year. Swaps pay the buyer face value in
exchange for the underlying securities or the cash equivalent
should a borrower fail to adhere to its debt agreements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
