European gasoline’s crack, or
premium to Brent crude, dropped after reaching a four-month high
yesterday on news of the planned closure of Hess Corp.’s Port
Reading refinery in New Jersey next month.  Gasoil advanced for the seventh session in eight on the ICE
Futures Europe exchange in London.  Light Products  Gasoline’s  crack , a measure of refining profit, dropped to
$12.04 a barrel as of 11:02 a.m. local time, according to PVM
Oil Associates Ltd., a London-based broker. The gap surged to
$13.45 yesterday, which was the highest since Sept. 28. The
crack remains above the  five-year average  for this time of year.  Prices in the U.S. and Europe rallied after Hess said it
will close the 70,000 barrel-a-day facility in New Jersey by the
end of February and seek a buyer for its 19 storage terminals
located along the U.S. East Coast.  “We would also expect to see this news translating into a
positive for European gasoline,” analysts at JBC Energy GmbH, a
researcher in Vienna, said in a note today. The U.S. is  Europe ’s
main export market for the fuel.  Gasoline in the Amsterdam-Rotterdam-Antwerp oil hub traded
from $1,037 to $1,038 a metric ton, according to a Bloomberg
survey of traders and brokers monitoring the Argus Bulletin
Board. That compares with deals from $1,020 to $1,048 yesterday,
when prices rose to the highest since Oct. 12.  For the fifth day, Gunvor Group Ltd. and Total SA sold the
Eurobob grade, to which ethanol is added before being sold at
the pump. BP Plc, Trafigura Beheer BV and Cargill Inc. bought
barges, which typically comprise 1,000 and 2,000 tons.  Naphtha’s crack , or discount to Brent, widened to $7.61 a
barrel, versus $6.75 yesterday, PVM data showed. That’s the
biggest loss in more than a week.  Middle Distillates  Gasoil for February delivery rose $3.50, or 0.4 percent, to
$974.25 a ton on the ICE exchange as of 12:18 p.m.  London  time.
The contract’s premium, or backwardation, to March futures was
unchanged at $8.75 a ton. The market structure may signal
declining near-term supplies or increasing demand.  Gasoil’s  crack  was at $16.25 a barrel, up from $16.03 as of
4:30 p.m. yesterday. Brent fell 12 cents to $113.36 a barrel.  Residues  Fuel oil bookings for cargoes from Western countries
arriving in Asia in February rose 6 percent from a week ago to
3.4 million tons, shipping data compiled by Bloomberg show.  At least 19 tankers, including seven very large crude
carriers, are scheduled to arrive from Europe, the U.S. and the
Caribbean, according to data from shipbrokers including Poten &
Partners Inc. and information from traders. That’s up from 3.2
million tons reported last week. Some fixtures are provisional
and may be changed or canceled.  Refineries  Cia. Espanola de Petroleos SA, Spain’s second-largest
refiner known as Cepsa, halted a hydrocracker and a distillation
unit at its 190,000 barrel-a-day  Huelva plant  for planned
maintenance, according to a company official.  The work on the units started over the weekend of Jan. 19
and Jan. 20 and will probably end in the middle of next week,
the official said by phone yesterday, asking not to be
identified because of company policy. The turnaround reduced the
plant’s capacity by 80,000 barrels a day, the official said.  Libya’s largest oil refinery at Ras Lanuf has been closed
down since Jan. 24 due to technical issues, including a power
failure, Abduljalil Mayuf, a spokesman for the state-run Arabian
Gulf Oil Co., said yesterday.  Workers at the 220,000 barrel-a-day plant have been on
strike since Jan. 25 to demand better pay, Mayuf said by phone
from Benghazi.  To contact the reporter on this story:
