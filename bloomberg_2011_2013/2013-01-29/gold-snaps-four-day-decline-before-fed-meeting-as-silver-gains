Gold rose the most in two weeks on
speculation that the  Federal Reserve  will expand U.S. stimulus
measures, boosting demand for the metal as a store of value.
Palladium extended a rally to a 16-month high.  The central bank, starting a two-day meeting today, will
continue to buy debt until the first quarter of 2014, according
to Bloomberg survey of economists. Gold touched a four-month low
on Jan. 4, after minutes of a Fed meeting showed some policy
makers favored ending monthly bond purchases this year.  “The consensus is that the Fed will continue with the
easing until the growth gains traction,” Chuck Butler, the
president of EverBank World Markets, said in a telephone
interview from  St. Louis .  Gold futures for April delivery climbed 0.5 percent to
settle at $1,662.70 an ounce at 1:38 p.m. on the Comex in  New
York , the biggest increase for a most-active contract since Jan.
15.  The metal gained 7 percent last year as U.S., Europe and
Japan announced stimulus programs.  Silver futures for March delivery rose 1.3 percent to
$31.184 an ounce on the Comex, ending a three-session slide.  The  U.S. Mint  resumed sales of American Eagle silver coins
after transactions were suspended for more than a week because
of a lack of inventory.  On the  New York Mercantile Exchange , palladium futures for
March delivery gained 1.2 percent to $749.75 an ounce. Earlier,
the metal reached $750.90, the highest since Sept. 9, 2011.  Platinum futures for April delivery rose 1 percent to
$1,678.90 an ounce on the Nymex.  To contact the reporters on this story:
