Fox News  hired media critic Howard Kurtz, who recently came under fire for errors in his reporting,
as an anchor of a new version of “Fox News Watch.”  Kurtz will also serve as a media analyst on several other
programs and write a regular column on FoxNews.com, the  News
Corp. (NWSA)  subsidiary said in a statement. CNN currently features
Kurtz on its “Reliable Sources” program, which will continue
to air with other hosts after his last show on June 30.  Kurtz, who spent 29 years at the Washington Post before
serving as Washington bureau chief for the Daily Beast and
Newsweek, has drawn scrutiny for errors in his reporting. On May
2, the Daily Beast  retracted  a blog post about NBA player Jason
Collins that claimed the player wasn’t forthcoming about his
engagement. Kurtz left the Daily Beast after the retraction.  In November 2010, Kurtz  apologized  to readers for posting a
story that appeared to be an interview with Republican
Congressman  Darrell Issa , when in fact he had only been
communicating with one of his spokesmen.  To contact the reporter on this story:
