Groupe Fnac, (FNAC)  the French DVD, books
and video-games chain, fell on its first day of trading in Paris
after being spun off from Gucci-owner  Kering (KER)  SA.  The shares, priced at 22 euros apiece, retreated to 19
euros today, giving the retailer a market value of 315.3 million
euros ($416 million). Kering was seeking a valuation of about
400 million euros for Fnac, people familiar with the situation
have said.  Kering spun off Fnac as part of a plan to focus on luxury
and sporting goods, which are more profitable and have stronger
growth prospects. The company has started talks with industrial
buyers and private-equity funds over the sale of online and
mail-order fashion retailer La Redoute, it said this week.  Fnac is midway through a turnaround plan to “stabilize”
sales and profitability by 2016 as  Europe ’s debt crisis weighs
on demand in the region and shopping for books, music, film,
video-games and computer hardware shifts online, Finance
Director Matthieu Malige said in an interview this week.  Fnac sales fell 2.4 percent to 4.1 billion euros in 2012.
The retailer, founded in 1954, gets about 70 percent of revenue
from  France , which is mired in recession, and more than half
from electronics. It had 170 stores as of Dec. 31, including in
Spain, Portugal, Brazil, Belgium, Switzerland and Morocco.  The business, which had a net loss of 141.7 million euros
last year, agreed to sell its Italian operations in November.  To contact the reporter on this story:
