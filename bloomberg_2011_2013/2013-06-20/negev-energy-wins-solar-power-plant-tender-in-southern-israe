Negev Energy, a partnership between
 Shikun & Binui Renewable Energy (SKBN)  and a unit of  Abengoa SA (ABG) , won a
tender to build and operate a solar plant in southern Israel.  The 121-megawatt Ashalim facility is due to start operating
in the second half of 2017 and will sell power at 0.76 shekel a
kilowatt-hour, Israelâ€™s  Finance Ministry  said today in an e-mailed statement. The cost of the project is $1.1 billion,
Shikun & Binui said in a separate filing to the stock exchange.  Israel is expanding its solar industry to meet electricity
demand while reducing reliance on fossil fuels. The country
installed 41 megawatts last year, increasing capacity to about
226 megawatts amid plans to source 10 percent of its power from
renewables by 2020, Bloomberg New Energy Finance data show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
