South Africa has identified
investments made on a “commercial basis” by the Libyan
government domestically, including the Michelangelo Towers in
Johannesburg.  South Africa’s government will work with Libyan authorities
to locate other assets, Finance Minister  Pravin Gordhan  said
today in an e-mailed statement. The Libyan government will have
to decide what it wants to do with the assets and funds, he
said.  Libya wants overseas assets to be returned to help
replenish its sovereign wealth fund. The Libyan Investment
Authority’s value has dropped to about $57 billion from $61
billion in 2008, according to Mohsen Derregia, the outgoing head
of the fund. Former President  Muammar Qaddafi , who ruled Libya
for four decades, was ousted in 2011 after eight months of
fighting to overthrow him.  Any allegations of “dubious” investments made in South
Africa during Qaddafi’s reign should be directed to the  United
Nations  and the Libyan government, Gordhan said.  “ South Africa  will continue to engage with the legitimate
Libyan authorities on this matter and in support of our
international obligations,” the minister said. “All the
relevant institutions that report to the Ministry of Finance
will cooperate with other government departments and agencies to
trace and verify any funds and assets.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
