Gold miners including  Barrick Gold
Corp. (ABX) , the largest by sales, fell to a four-year low after the
U.S. Federal Reserve said it may phase out stimulus and the
metal dropped below $1,300 an ounce for the first time since
2010.  The 53-company Standard & Poor’s/TSX Global Gold Sector
Index  dropped  7.3 percent to 166.98 points at the close in
Toronto. The index has declined 45 percent this year. Toronto-based Barrick fell 6.9 percent to C$17.27, the lowest since
August 1992, while  Goldcorp Inc. (G) , the second-largest Canadian
producer by sales, fell 7.9 percent to C$24.81.  Gold futures for August delivery plunged 6.4 percent to
settle at $1,286.20 at 1:42 p.m. on the Comex in New York. In
electronic trading after the market settled, prices touched
$1,275.40, the lowest since September 2010.  Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said yesterday
stimulus may be reduced. The metal’s decline was the biggest
since April 15, when gold ended the day down 9.3 percent, the
most in three decades. The central bank, which buys $85 billion
of Treasury and mortgage debt each month, may begin reducing
purchases this year and end the program in 2014 should the
economy continue to improve, Bernanke said.  “The gold producers have just been devastated.” Michael O’Brien, who helps manage C$204 billion at TD Asset Management
Inc., said by phone from Toronto today. “You’ll have a heck of
a time having anybody build a new mine or get financing in this
environment.”  Perseus Mining Ltd. (PRU) , an Australian gold producer with
operations in Africa, declined 25 percent in Toronto, to 57
Canadian cents a share, while  OceanaGold Corp. (OGC) , which mines in
 New Zealand  and the Philippines, dropped 12 percent to C$1.26.  Holdings in the SPDR Gold Trust, the world’s largest
exchange-traded product backed by bullion, fell yesterday below
1,000 metric tons for the first time in four years.  To contact the reporter on this story:
