Medtronic Inc. (MDT) , the largest maker of
heart rhythm and spinal devices, increased its stock buyback
program by 80 million shares and boosted its quarterly cash
 dividend  to 28 cents per share.  The increase brings Medtronic’s annual dividend to $1.12
per share for a current yield of 2.2 percent, the Minneapolis-based company said today in a statement. Medtronic has raised
its dividend each year for the past 36 years. The share
repurchase program accounts for about 8 percent of the company’s
outstanding common stock.  Medtronic is committed to returning 50 percent of its  free
cash flow  to investors each year through dividends and share
repurchases, Omar Ishrak, chief executive officer of the
Minneapolis-based company, said in the statement. The dividend
is payable July 26 to shareholders of record at the close of
business on July 5. Share repurchases will be made on the open
market, the company said.  The policy “still gives us ample flexibility to make
necessary investments for sustainable growth,” Ishrak said.  Medtronic said it has bought more than 142 million shares
for $5.6 billion in the last five years.  To contact the reporter on this story:
