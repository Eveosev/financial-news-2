Alcatel-Lucent SA (ALU) ’s strategic shift
unveiled yesterday will result in workforce “adjustments,”
said Chief Executive Officer  Michel Combes , who’s preparing to
meet with unions in the coming weeks.  The French network-equipment vendor is planning departures,
staff reallocations and hiring some people with skills it is
missing, Combes said in an interview in Alcatel-Lucent’s Bell
Labs France research facilities in Villarceaux, near Paris. The
company announced the 1 billion-euro ($1.3 billion) cost-reduction plan yesterday to stem losses.  “It’s clear that a 1 billion-euro cost reduction will
trigger labor adjustments in different countries around the
world,” Combes said. “We need to see how we can reallocate
competences and hire people with new competences. The plan will
probably also mean a few departures.”  Alcatel-Lucent, which has 72,000 employees worldwide,
yesterday outlined a three-year plan to sell more than 1 billion
euros of assets and cut costs to return to profit after seven
years of restructuring and two CEO changes failed to revive the
company.  Alcatel-Lucent shares rose 2.2 percent to 1.53 euros at 4
p.m. in Paris, more than double what they were worth when they
hit a 23-year low in October.  To contact the reporter on this story:
