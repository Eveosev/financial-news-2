Syria ’s Foreign Ministry said edicts
issued by Arab Muslim scholars that call for jihad, or holy war,
“complete the bloody approach” adopted by regional and Western
countries toward Syria, the state-run SANA news agency said.  In a  letter  to the United Nations, the Foreign Ministry
singled out several scholars, including Egyptian-born cleric
Yusuf al-Qaradawi and Saudi Mohammad Al-Areefi, for urging Sunni
Muslims to take up arms against loyalists of Syrian President
Bashar al-Assad, whose Alawite sect is an offshoot of Shiite
Islam, and its Lebanese ally, the Shiite militant group
Hezbollah.  These calls “aim to justify all acts of systematic murder,
rape, massive killing, terrorist bombings” targeting Syrians
and the demolition of the country’s infrastructure with the aim
of destroying Syria and its culture, SANA said.  Syria holds those “scholars of sedition and instigation”
and the governments that support them “directly responsible for
the shedding of Syrians’ blood,” the ministry said in the
letter, according to SANA.  Al-Qaradawi has called on Sunnis from his base in Qatar to
fight a holy war in Syria while Al-Areefi gave a sermon in a
Cairo mosque this month urging Sunnis to take up arms against
Assad and Hezbollah.  To contact the reporter on this story:
