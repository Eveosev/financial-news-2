The European Union should ease
controls on genetically modified crops in order to meet future
food demand, and the U.K. should take a leading role in
expanding research, Environment Secretary Owen Paterson said.  EU rules banning farmers from cultivating most genetically
modified crops mean the bloc “is missing out” on technology
that would boost yields and cut use of chemicals and fertilizer,
Paterson said today at Rothamsted Research in Harpenden,
 England , according to a copy of the speech posted  online  by the
Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs. The EU has
given approval for farmers to grow one GM crop in the bloc in
the last 14 years, while more than 40 products can be imported
for food and feed use, primarily for livestock, he said.  Cultivation of GM crops developed by companies including
 Monsanto Co. (MON)  and  Syngenta AG (SYNN)  is common in the U.S., Brazil and
Argentina, the world’s top exporters of corn and soybeans. The
United Nations has said global  food production  should  double  by
2050 to meet rising demand. Worldwide, GM crops are grown on 170
million hectares (420 million acres), and less than 0.1 percent
of that land is in the EU, Paterson said.  “While the rest of the world is plowing ahead and reaping
the benefits of new technologies,  Europe  risks being left
behind,” Paterson said. “We cannot afford to let that happen.
The use of GM could be as transformative as the original
agricultural revolution. The U.K. should be at the forefront.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
