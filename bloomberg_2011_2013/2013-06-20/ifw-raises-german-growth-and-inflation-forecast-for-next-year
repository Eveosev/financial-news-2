The IfW economic institute raised
its German growth forecast for 2014 while lowering its 2013
forecast to 0.5 percent from 0.6 percent.  Gross domestic product in  Europe â€™s largest economy will
expand by 1.8 percent next year, more than the 1.5 percent
forecast by the Kiel-based institute on March 14, according to
an IfW report published today.  The consumer price index will probably increase by 2.1
percent in 2014 from a forecast 1.7 percent inflation rate this
year, the IfW report said.  The German government will probably post a surplus of
almost 3 billion euros ($4 billion) next year, IfW said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
