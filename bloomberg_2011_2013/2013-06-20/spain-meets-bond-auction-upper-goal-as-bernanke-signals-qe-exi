Spain  met its maximum target at a
bond auction even as its 10-year borrowing costs rose after U.S.
Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said yesterday that
policy makers may end asset purchases in mid-2014.  The Madrid-based  Treasury  sold 4.02 billion euros ($5.31
billion) of debt, in line with its maximum target of 4 billion
euros. A five-year note was sold to yield 3.592 percent, down
from 3.598 percent at a sale on April 4. Its nine-year benchmark
yielded 4.353 percent, down from 4.477 percent on April 4, and a
10-year bond fetched 4.765 percent, up from 4.517 percent on
June 6.  Spanish  government bonds  have fallen in the past month amid
volatility on financial markets as investors wait to see at what
pace the Fed withdraws liquidity, while the  Bank of Japan 
supplies more. The yield on  Spain’s 10-year benchmark  bond was
58 basis points higher than a month ago at 4.778 percent at
10:57 a.m. in Madrid.  Demand for Spain’s 2018 notes was 2.15 times the amount
sold, down from 4.09 in April. The bid-to-cover ratio was 1.96
for the 2021 securities, down from 2.06, and 1.84 for the 2023
bonds, down from 2.52 in June.  “Binary debates on the degree of liquidity supply from
central banks are bringing a considerable degree of
volatility,” said  Richard McGuire , a senior fixed-income
strategist at Rabobank International in London. “We can’t
assume therefore that every auction from here will be a positive
for peripheral countries.”  Real-Estate Crash  European Central Bank President  Mario Draghi ’s pledge to do
“whatever it takes” to defend the euro has shielded Spain from
seeking more European aid after it was granted access to as much
as 100 billion-euro a year ago to support its banks following a
real-estate crash.  The yield on its 10-year benchmark bond fell below 4
percent in May for the first time since 2010, compared with a
euro era high of 7.75 percent on July 25. The Treasury last week
said it had covered 60 percent of its mid-and long-term gross
funding needs for 2013. as the spread with similar German
securities has narrowed about 325 basis points since July 2012.  To contact the reporters on this story:
