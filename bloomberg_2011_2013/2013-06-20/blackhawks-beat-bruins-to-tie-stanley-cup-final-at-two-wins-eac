The  Chicago Blackhawks  won 6-5 in
overtime at the Boston Bruins to tie the Stanley Cup Final at
two games apiece.  Game 5 in the best-of-seven National Hockey League
championship series is scheduled for June 22 in Chicago.  The Bruins snapped a 39-year wait for a sixth championship
in 2011, a year after the Blackhawks ended a 49-year wait for a
fourth NHL title.  After the teams combined to score 12 goals in the first
three games of the series, 11 goals were shared in Game 4, the
third to go to overtime.  It was tied at 1-1 at the end of the first period at TD
Garden in Boston. Michal Handzus scored a shorthanded goal for
Chicago after six minutes, 48 seconds and  Rich Peverley  tied it
for Boston on a power play eight minutes later.  Jonathan Toews  restored Chicagoâ€™s lead 6:33 into the second
period and  Patrick Kane  made it 3-1 two minutes later. Less than
a minute after Milan Lucic got a goal back for the Bruins,
Marcus Kruger scored to give the Blackhawks a 4-2 lead. Patrice
Bergeron then got the fifth score of the period on a power play
with 2:38 remaining.  Bergeron scored again 2:05 into the third period to tie it
at four goals each.  Patrick Sharp  made it 5-4 to the Blackhawks
with his postseason-best 10th goal, only for Johnny Boychuk to
tie it again 55 seconds later.  Brent Seabrook got the winning goal 9:51 into overtime.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
