Natural gas futures fell in  New York 
for the first time in four days after U.S. stockpiles rose more
than forecast.  Gas dropped 2.2 percent as the Energy Information
Administration said inventories expanded by 91 billion cubic
feet in the week ended June 14 to 2.438 trillion cubic feet.
Analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg showed an expected gain
of 89 billion.  Supply increases  have exceeded the five-year
average for three consecutive weeks as mild weather reduced
demand from  power plants .  “We are certainly getting outsized injections at this
point and that is a function of a lack of demand,” said  Stephen Schork , president of Schork Group Inc., a consulting group in
Villanova,  Pennsylvania . “As we go into the hottest part of the
summer, people in New York,  Chicago  and  Boston  are finally going
to turn on their air conditioners next week. You are going to
see injections over the next two months start to pull back.”  Natural gas for July delivery fell 8.6 cents to settle
$3.877 per million British thermal units on the  New York
Mercantile Exchange . Trading was 2.8 percent below the 100-day
average at 2:40 p.m. Gas is up 16 percent this year.  The discount of July to October futures widened 0.6 cent
from yesterday to 3.1 cents.  Gas Options  July $3.85 puts were the most active options in electronic
trading. They were 1.2 cents higher at 2.6 cents per million Btu
on volume of 1,391 at 3:08 p.m. Puts accounted for 55 percent of
trading volume. Implied volatility for at-the-money options
expiring in August was 28.74 percent at 3 p.m., compared with
29.59 percent yesterday.  The stockpile increase was bigger than the five-year
average gain for the week of 80 billion cubic feet, department
data show. A  deficit  to the five-year average narrowed to 1.9
percent from 2.4 percent the previous week. Supplies were 18.7
percent below  year-earlier inventories , down from 20 percent in
last week’s report.  “We are now seeing that build in cooling demand, and that
will likely curb the industry’s restocking ability,” said Teri Viswanath, director of commodities strategy at BNP Paribas SA in
New York.  Gas futures had rebounded since dropping to a three-month
low last week on the outlook for hotter weather that would boost
demand for the power-plant fuel to run air conditioners.  Hotter Weather  Temperatures across most of the lower 48 states will be
above normal from June 25 through July 14, according to MDA
Weather Services in Gaithersburg,  Maryland . The high in Boston
on June 24 may be 90 degrees Fahrenheit (32 Celsius), 11 higher
than usual, and Houston may reach 99 degrees on July 2, 8 above
normal, said  AccuWeather Inc.  in  State College , Pennsylvania.  Electricity generators, the largest consumers of U.S. gas,
will account for 32 percent of demand in 2013, according to the
EIA.  U.S. gas output will rise to an all-time high for the sixth
straight year as new wells come online at shale formations, such
as the Marcellus in the Northeast. Marketed gas production will
average a record 70.01 billion cubic feet a day this year, up
1.2 percent from 69.18 billion in 2012, the EIA said June 11 in
its monthly  Short-Term Energy Outlook .  “After stabilizing in 2013, gas output will rise
strongly” from 2014 through 2018 as higher prices spur drilling
and expanded infrastructure allows more shale supplies to reach
the market, the  International Energy Agency  said in its Medium-Term Market Report, released today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
