German financial regulator Bafin
established a committee to safeguard the rights of private
investors, advancing its push to boost transparency and curtail
financial markets.  The body, composed of consumer and investor protection
groups, arbitration groups, labor unions, scientists and
 Germany ’s consumer ministry, will advise Bafin from a consumer
perspective, the Bonn-based regulator said in an e-mailed
statement today.  The move follows the introduction of financial regulation
reforms in October empowering Bafin to defend private investors
and make financial advisers and institutions more accountable.
Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeublehas taken steps, including
short-selling restrictions, to tighten controls on the  capital
markets  after bailing out banks in the aftermath of the
financial crisis.  “It’s good that we have reliable and efficient financial
markets, but it’s just as important that these operate with
clear rules and frameworks,” Schaeuble said in the statement.
“Without these, they would destroy themselves, and without
constant monitoring and controls, the risk arises that the
citizen, as a private investor or borrower, would become a
victim of non-sustainable business models.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
