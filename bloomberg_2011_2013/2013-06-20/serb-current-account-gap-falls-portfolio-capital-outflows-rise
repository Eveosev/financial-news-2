Serbia ’s current-account deficit
shrank in April amid rising exports and remittances even as
portfolio investors pulled out of Serbian assets for the first
time since last July.  The gap of 135.5 million euros ($179.03 million) in April
was 37 percent lower than in the same month last year and fell
59 percent from a revised 331.3 million euros in March. The
four-month cumulative gap fell 46 percent on year to 757.8
million euros, according to data published by the National Bank
of Serbia on its website today.  Portfolio investors withdrew a net 304.2 million euros in
April, selling government debt for the first time since July
2012. Other outflows included a repayment of 128 million euros
in trade financing and a 173.8 million-euro drop in cash and
deposits at banks, the balance of payments figures show.  Exports grew 24 percent in the first four months while
imports rose 3.7 percent on year. Remittances were 19 percent
higher on the year at 683.9 million euros. Net foreign direct
investments stood at a four-month total of 217.3 million euros,
compared with a minus 240 million euros in the same period last
year.  The central bank sees this year’s current account gap at
8.5 percent of gross domestic product, up from initially
forecast 8.1 percent of GDP, to reflect a higher-than-planned
fiscal deficit. The current account deficit stood at 10.5
percent of GDP in 2012.  To contact the reporter on this story:
