Global liquefied natural gas markets
will face “unprecedented” tightness this year and next as
incremental LNG demand from  Asia  exceeds new supply, according
to the  International Energy Agency .  Supply of the chilled fuel will increase by 2018 as new
projects start in Australia, boosting global LNG trade by 31
percent from 2012 levels, the Paris-based IEA said in its
Medium-Term Gas Report released today.  About 138 billion cubic meters a year of LNG production was
under construction as of mid-2013, bringing total capacity to at
least 500 billion cubic meters by 2018, according to the IEA. Of
the new supply, almost 86 billion cubic meters will be sold to
Asia and more than 80 percent has been contracted on a long-term
basis, according to the report.  “There are many uncertainties about medium-term trends on
the global LNG market,” including the direction of Japanese
nuclear policy, Chinese purchases, delays at  Australia ’s
liquefaction projects and the number of U.S. LNG export plants
that will be approved, the IEA said. “Given these
uncertainties, LNG buyers are changing their procurement
strategy towards the introduction of new price mechanisms and
away from the traditional oil price linkage, in addition to
espousing stable supplies and reducing procurement costs.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
