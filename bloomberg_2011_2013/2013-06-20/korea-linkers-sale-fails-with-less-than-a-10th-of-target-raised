South  Korea  raised less than a 10th
of the amount planned in an auction of inflation-linked bonds as
a cash squeeze and moderating outlook for consumer-price gains
sapped demand for the securities.  The Finance Ministry sold 55.6 billion won ($49 million) of
10-year linkers, having offered 600 billion won of the
securities, according to a statement today on its website. The
first coupon of 1.125 percent compares with a May inflation  rate 
of 1 percent that was the lowest since 1999.  More than $2 trillion has been pulled from global markets
since May 22, when Federal Reserve Chairman Ben S. Bernanke
signaled the possibility of tapering measures that have fueled
demand for emerging-market assets. The Federal Open Market
Committee yesterday said “downside risks to the outlook for the
economy and the labor market” have diminished.  “Demand for linkers, as well as bonds across the board,
crashed because concerns over capital outflows or liquidity
shortages intensified after the Fed’s comments,” said Lee Jung
Bum, a fixed-income strategist at Korea Investment & Securities
Co. in  Seoul . “We don’t see inflation picking up.”  The so-called breakeven rate, or the rate of price
increases traders are expecting over the life of the securities
in Korea, declined to 2.03 percent yesterday from this year’s
high of 2.61 percent in January, according to  data  compiled by
Bloomberg. Barclays Plc said in a report this week that
inflation-linked bonds in Korea are not attractive.  The yield on the government’s 2.75 percent conventional
bonds due March 2018 jumped 18 basis points today to 3.16
percent, the highest level for a benchmark five-year security
since July 2012, prices from Korea Exchange Inc. show. A March
28 level of 2.51 percent was the lowest in  data  going back to
August 2000.  South Korea first introduced inflation-linked bonds in
March 2007 that pay interest twice yearly, with the coupon and
final principal redemption amount linked to the headline
inflation rate.  To contact the reporter on this story:
