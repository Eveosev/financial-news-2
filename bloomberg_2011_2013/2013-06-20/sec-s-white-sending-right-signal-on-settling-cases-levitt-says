(Corrects Levitt’s position at Promontory in fourth
paragraph.)  U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission Chairman Mary Jo White is sending the right signal by
saying the agency will seek more admissions of wrongdoing in
enforcement cases, said  Arthur Levitt , a former SEC chairman.  “Mary Jo did exactly what she should have done,” Levitt,
82, said today in an interview on Bloomberg radio. “She’s going
to be selective in terms of egregious cases where she’s really
going to go for the gold.”  White, a former Debevoise & Plimpton LLP partner who took
over the SEC in April, said on June 18 that the regulator would
seek more admissions of misconduct as a condition of settling
cases. Typically, the SEC allows subjects to neither admit nor
deny wrongdoing, a practice that has drawn fire from lawmakers,
consumer groups and jurists.  “What’s she saying is, we’re going to pick a case and make
an example of it,” said Levitt, who is an adviser to Promontory
Financial Group LLC and a Bloomberg LP board member. “I don’t
think that means that 50 percent of cases will get litigated, we
may be talking about 2 or 3 percent. She’s sending exactly the
right signal.”  White said that admissions of wrongdoing could be useful in
sending “as strong a deterrent message out there as you
possibly can.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
