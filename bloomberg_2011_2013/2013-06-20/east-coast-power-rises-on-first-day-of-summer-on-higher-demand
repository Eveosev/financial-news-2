Spot wholesale electricity gained on
East Coast hubs as higher temperatures lifted demand above
forecasts.  The Northeast and mid-Atlantic states will see sunny skies
with more seasonable weather today following cooler readings,
according to WSI Corp. in Andover, Massachusetts. Power
consumption was above forecasts in  New York , New England and the
grid operated by PJM Interconnection LLC, which stretches from
 New Jersey  into North Carolina and  Illinois .  “We saw very weak load for the first part of June with
mild weather but now, with the heat that is coming in, the load
is reacting as expected,” said Kate Trischitta, director of
trading at Consolidated Edison Inc.’s wholesale energy trading
division in New York. “Prices are going to be higher.”  New York City spot power climbed $10.30, or 30 percent, to
$44.77 a megawatt-hour during the hour ended at 3 p.m. from the
same time yesterday, according to grid data compiled by
Bloomberg. Boston prices rose $9.35, or 30 percent, to $40.06.  Electricity at PJM’s benchmark  Western hub , which includes
prices from Washington to Erie,  Pennsylvania , jumped $8.40, or
23 percent, to $45.40 a megawatt-hour during the same hour.  The high in New York City today will be 80 degrees
Fahrenheit (27 Celsius), 1 below normal, after dropping to 3
below at 77 yesterday, according to AccuWeather Inc. in  State
College , Pennsylvania. The high in Washington will be 4 below
normal at 82 degrees, after dipping to 78 yesterday.  Electricity demand in the U.S. peaks in the summer, when
hot weather drives air-conditioner use.  New York  Consumers  in Manhattan and neighboring boroughs were using
7,760 megawatts of electricity at 1:45 p.m., 5.5 percent higher
than the  forecast  for the hour, according to the New York
Independent System Operator Inc.’s website. PJM said  demand  on
its 13-state grid was 109,930 megawatts at 2:05 p.m., 2.5
percent higher than its day-ahead outlook.  Power demand  on the six-state grid from  Maine  to
Connecticut was 17,073 megawatts at 2:15 p.m. versus the
forecast of 16,980 megawatts, ISO  New England  Inc.’s website
showed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
