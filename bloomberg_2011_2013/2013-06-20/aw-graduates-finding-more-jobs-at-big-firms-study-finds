More U.S. law school graduates are
finding jobs at large firms even as legal hiring remains well
below pre-recession highs, the  National Association for Law
Placement  said in a report.  The number of jobs taken at firms with more than 500
lawyers rose 27 percent for the class of 2012 over the previous
year’s levels, according to the study. The number of jobs, more
than 3,600, is still less than the more than 5,000 jobs filled
in 2009. Offers from the smallest firms, those with less than 10
lawyers, remained unchanged as percentage of total hiring,
according to the study.  “The jobs picture is improving, if only slightly,” NALP
Executive Director James Leipold said in a statement. “This
class found more jobs -- and more jobs in private practice --
than the previous class, but because the national graduating
class was so much bigger, the overall employment rate continued
to fall.”  Employment for graduates fell to 84.7 percent from 85.6 the
previous year, the fifth year in a row it has declined since
2008, according to the study. The employment rate is the lowest
since 1994, the NALP said. The employment rate has fallen more
than seven percentage points since reaching a 24-year high of
91.9 percent in 2007, according to the report.  The class of 2011 “represented the absolute bottom of the
curve on the jobs front,” Leipold said in the statement. “The
results for the class of 2012 bear that out, showing as they do,
a number of improving markers.”  The national median salary for the new  law firm  hires rose
to $90,000 from $85,000 the previous year. Salaries of about
$160,000 accounted for 29 percent of law firm pay, according to
the report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
