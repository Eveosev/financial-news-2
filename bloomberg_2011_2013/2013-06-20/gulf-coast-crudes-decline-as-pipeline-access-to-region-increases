Offshore Gulf Coast oils weakened
against the benchmark West Texas Intermediate toward the end of
trading for July delivery, as pipeline projects are prepared to
increase supplies of onshore crudes in the region.  Poseidon fell $1.05 a barrel against WTI at 3:51 p.m. to a
60-cent-a-barrel premium, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The pipelines include Sunoco Logistics Partners LP’s
Permian Express project, planned for the second quarter, and
Royal Dutch Shell Plc’s expansion of its reversed Houston-to-Houma, Louisiana pipeline to 250,000 barrels a day by early
2014.  “We’re basically just about finished trading July barrels
and are moving to August,” said  Andy Lipow , president of Lipow
Oil Associates LLC in Houston. “The Sunoco Permian Express
pipeline is expected to start up in July, which is right around
the corner.”  Mars Blend’s premium to WTI lost 60 cents to $1.50 a
barrel. Southern Green Canyon weakened by 20 cents to a premium
of 80 cents a barrel.  The premium for  Thunder Horse , which has a lower sulfur
content than Mars, Poseidon and Southern Green Canyon, weakened
by 10 cents to $4.75 a barrel.  Light Louisiana Sweet strengthened by 25 cents a barrel to
a premium of $8.25 over WTI and Heavy Louisiana Sweet’s premium
to WTI widened 5 cents to $7.80.  To contact the reporter on this story:
