The yields on Polish  government
bonds  surged the most since October 2008 after Federal Reserve
Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said the U.S. central bank may curb
stimulus this year that helped feed a global rally in
securities.  The  yield  on Poland’s 10-year notes jumped 33 basis points
to 4.19 percent at 1:45 p.m. in Warsaw, the highest since
November last year. The premium over similar German bonds rose
22 basis points to a two-month high of 252 basis points. The
zloty weakened 1.1 percent to 4.3097 against the euro, after
falling as much as 2 percent earlier today, the deepest slump in
19 months.  The Fed may taper its monthly purchases of $85 billion in
assets later this year and halt them around mid-2014 as long as
the world’s largest economy performs in line with its
projections, Bernanke said yesterday.  Poland  may abstain from holding bond sales in July and
August as it has met 88 percent of its this year’s borrowing
needs of 145 billion zloty, deputy Finance Minister Wojciech Kowalczyk said in Warsaw today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
