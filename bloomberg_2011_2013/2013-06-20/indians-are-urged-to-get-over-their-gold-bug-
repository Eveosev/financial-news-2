At a news conference last week, India's harassed finance minister, P. Chidambaram, addressed the issue of the rising current account deficit and the  fall of the rupee  against the dollar. His message to his countrymen:  Please stop buying so much gold . Chidambaram has a point. India is the world's biggest consumer of gold, accounting for a little more than one-third of world demand. Traditionally, gold in India has served a double purpose of consumption (it's often the single biggest expense at a wedding) and investment, because it is seen as a more reliable hedge against inflation than savings in financial instruments. Urban and rural Indians differ in their habits in many other spheres, but they are united in their trust in gold. A recent report showed that gold accounted for as much as  10 percent  of total household savings in 2011.  Unfortunately, almost no gold is produced domestically, and so rising demand for the precious commodity severely affects the balance of payments. Gold is now the second-largest expense on India's  import bill, after crude oil . One would have thought that rising gold prices -- a jump of more  500 percent  since 2000 -- would have had the effect of curbing demand, but that's not been the case. As  this graph shows , India's demand for gold remained between 550 and 800 metric tons annually from 1997 to 2009, even as prices kept going up.  Here's a market, then, that appears to be price inelastic -- but apparently only when prices are rising. When prices fell  to a two-year low  in April, gold demand shot up to record levels, with monthly imports averaging  152 tons  in the first two months of the new fiscal year, more than twice the monthly average of 70 tons from the previous year. To suppress demand, the government has already raised the import duty on gold twice this year, from 4 percent to 6 percent in January and then from 6 percent to 8 percent  in June . Last week, Chidambaram delivered  a small homily  on gold that was part economics lesson, part supplication: Chidambaram is right, as  this graph  calculating India's trade deficits with and without gold demonstrates. He is by no means the first finance minister to try and persuade his countrymen not to park their money into gold. Last year, his predecessor Pranab Mukherjee, was quoted as  saying  that the: This is, however, a long-term project. India's gold-buying culture is deeply entrenched. As Leif Eskesen, chief economist for India and Southeast Asia at HSBC Holdings Plc, wrote in his report  "India Perspectives: The Love Affair With Gold"  published earlier this year: Arguing that investing in gold was for many Indians a perfectly logical decision, Monika Halan  wrote  in the business newspaper Mint: As the late Indian economist IG Patel, who  wrote extensively  in the 1950s on India's gold obsession and ways in which to mobilize the hoarded wealth,  once said : “In prosperity as in the hour of need, the thoughts of most Indians turn to gold.” The evidence from the last few years suggests that when steeply rising prices, and a debilitating current account deficit that raises the cost of other goods, come up against a powerfully entrenched cultural reflex, it's not always the laws of economics that win out.
