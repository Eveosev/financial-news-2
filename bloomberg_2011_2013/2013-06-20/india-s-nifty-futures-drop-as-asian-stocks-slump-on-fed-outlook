Indian stock-index futures declined
as overseas investors extended a sell-off of local shares and
the U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said bond
purchases may be cut.  SGX CNX Nifty Index futures  for June delivery dropped 1.1
percent to 5,752 at 9:47 a.m. in Singapore. The underlying CNX
 Nifty (NIFTY)  Index on the National Stock Exchange of India Ltd. rose
0.2 percent to 5,822.25 yesterday. The S&P BSE Sensex gained 0.1
percent to 19,245.70. The Bank of  New York  Mellon India ADR
Index of U.S.-traded shares lost 1.5 percent.  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index slumped today after Bernanke
said the U.S. central bank may start reducing bond purchases
later this year if risks to the U.S. economy abate. The Sensex
has lost 4.1 percent since Bernanke first signaled on May 22
that the Fed could consider paring its $85 billion-a-month
stimulus program. Foreign funds were net sellers of  Indian (SENSEX) 
stocks for a sixth day on June 18.  “The sooner-than-expected winding down of U.S. stimulus is
weighing on market sentiment,” Kishor Ostwal, managing director
at CNI Research Ltd., said by phone today. “Commodity stocks
and consumer plays are likely to be hit the most.”  Foreigners sold a net $96 million of local shares on June
18, data from the regulator show. That reduced this year’s net
purchases to $14.8 billion, still a record for the period, data
compiled by Bloomberg show.  The Sensex has dropped 0.9 percent this year and trades at
13.2 times  projected 12-month profits  compared with the MSCI
 Emerging Markets  Index’s 9.6 times, the cheapest since July.  To contact the reporter on this story:
