Enerkem Inc. (NKM) , the Montreal-based
biofuel company that last year withdrew plans to raise as much
as $137.8 million in an initial public offering, raised C$50
million ($48.2 million) to commercialize its waste-to-ethanol
technology.  Investissement Quebec joined existing equity investors that
include Waste Management Inc., Braemar Energy Ventures and The
Westly Group, which all increased their stakes, according to a
statement today.  Enerkem in January sold a C$37 million stake in an Alberta
plant itâ€™s building that will convert municipal waste into
biofuels and chemicals. The facility initially will make
methanol, which will be sold to Methanex Corp., until ethanol
production begins next year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
