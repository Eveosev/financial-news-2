Serbia is expected to harvest 21.8
percent more wheat this summer than last year, according to a
Statistics Office preliminary report.  The total wheat output is seen at 2.3 million tons, or 18.5
percent more than the 10-year average, the Belgrade-based office
said on its website today, citing the state of the crop through
May 25.  The greater output, which compares with 1.91 million tons
in 2012, will reflect “expanded planted area and higher
yields,” the office said.  Serbian farmers planted 557,396 hectares (1.42 million
acres) to wheat, compared with 480,539 hectares in the previous
season. Yields are expected to rise to 4,177 kilograms per
hectare, from 3,977 kilograms per hectare last year.  The statistics office also said the area sown to corn fell
7.3 percent to 1.19 million hectares, while sugar beet plantings
dropped 4 percent to 62,377 hectares and the area sown to
soybeans fell 1.6 percent to 160,865 hectares. Sunflower
plantings increased 11.8 percent to 186,556 hectares.  To contact the reporter on this story:
