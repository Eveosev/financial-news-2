U.K. stocks  dropped for a second day
after Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said the central
bank may consider ending bond purchases next year and as data
showed a contraction in Chinese manufacturing accelerated.  Randgold Resources Ltd. (RRS)  and Rio Tinto Group led losses
among mining companies, each falling more than 3 percent.  ARM
Holdings Plc (ARM)  dropped 4 percent, after sliding yesterday on U.S.-
based Nvidia Corp.’s plans to license technology to other
processor makers. Ashtead Group Plc rose 2.8 percent after
posting earnings that beat estimates and raising its dividend.  The  FTSE 100 Index (UKX)  fell 103.03 points, or 1.6 percent, to
6,245.79 at 8:52 a.m. in London. The gauge has lost 8.7 percent
 since  Bernanke first said May 22 the Fed could scale back
stimulus if the economy improves. The broader FTSE All-Share
Index slid 1.5 percent today and Ireland’s ISEQ Index declined
0.5 percent.  Stocks tracked a selloff in U.S. equities after Bernanke
said in Washington yesterday that the Fed will probably taper
its stimulus measures later in 2013 and halt bond purchases
around mid-2014 as long as the economy performs in line with Fed
projections. He was speaking after a two-day meeting of the
 Federal Open Market Committee .  The central bank said it will keep buying bonds at a pace
of $85 billion a month, and repeated that it’s prepared to
increase or reduce the pace of purchases depending on the
outlook for the job market and inflation.  A gauge of London-listed  mining companies  dropped 3.4
percent as China’s manufacturing shrank in June, for a second
successive month. A preliminary reading of 48.3 for a purchasing
managers’ index released today by HSBC Holdings Plc and Markit
Economics compared with the 49.1 median estimate in a Bloomberg
News survey of 15 economists.The final reading of 49.2 in May
was the first below 50 since October, indicating contraction.  To contact the reporter on this story:
