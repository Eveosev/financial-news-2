Toronto Mayor Rob Ford’s conflict-of-interest case won’t be heard by the country’s top court,
leaving intact a lower court’s decision saying that he can stay
in office.  The Ottawa-based court made the  decision  today.  The dispute is over donations Ford allegedly solicited
using city resources as a councilor in 2010 for a charity at a
high school football team he used to coach. Ford also voted on a
motion relieving himself of the responsibility to repay the
donations. The first judge to review the case said he had to
step down, a decision that was overturned in a January appeal.  To contact the reporter on this story:
