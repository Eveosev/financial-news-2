Jay-Z, the entertainer who started
an athlete-representation firm in April, has been certified by
the National Basketball Association and Major League Baseball
players’ unions to negotiate contracts.  Robert Gadson, director of security and agent
administration at the National Basketball Player’s Association,
and MLB Players Association spokesman  Greg Bouris  said the
certifications had been granted.  Jay-Z, whose real name is Shawn Carter, met with Ron Klempner, the NBPA’s acting executive director, and the
organization’s legal staff, Gadson said in an interview
yesterday.  Carter, an investor in the NBA’s Brooklyn Nets, has won 17
Grammy Awards and sold more than 33 million albums, according to
answers.com.  Under NBA rules, Carter must sell his interest in the team
to represent players in contract talks. NBA spokesman Mike Bass
said Carter has submitted an application to the league office to
sell his stake in the Nets and the league’s review process is
under way.  “Upon successful completion of the transfer of his
ownership interest, there will be no prohibition from him
representing NBA players,” Bass said in an e-mailed statement.  Roc Nation’s clients include  New York  Yankees second
baseman Robinson Cano and New York Jets rookie quarterback Geno Smith.  Roc Nation operates in a partnership with Creative Artists
Agency.  To contact the reporter on this story:
