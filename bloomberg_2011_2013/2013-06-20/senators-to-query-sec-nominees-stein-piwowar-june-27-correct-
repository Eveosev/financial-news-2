(Corrects name in headline.)  Two U.S. Senate aides nominated to
join the Securities and Exchange Commission will get a
confirmation hearing before the Senate Banking Committee on June
27, according to a Senate announcement today.  Michael S. Piwowar and Kara M. Stein will face questions
posed by their current and former bosses on the committee.
Piwowar, a Republican, is the chief economist for the
committeeâ€™s Republican members. Stein worked for the committee
under Senator  Jack Reed , a Rhode Island Democrat who previously
led a securities subcommittee.  A vote on their nominations will be held at a subsequent
hearing, the banking committee said in a news release. Full
Senate approval could come as early as July.  To contact the reporter on this story:
