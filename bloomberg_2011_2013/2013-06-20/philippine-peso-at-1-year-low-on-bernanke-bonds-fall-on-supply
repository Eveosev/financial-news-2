The Philippine peso fell to its
lowest level in more than a year on speculation U.S. policy
makers will scale back stimulus measures.  Government bonds 
dropped on concern the supply of local debt will increase.  The Southeast Asian nation’s financial markets slumped
after Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said yesterday
the central bank may taper its bond purchases this year if the
 U.S. economy  improves further, and a gauge of manufacturing in
China fell more than analysts estimated. Philippine Treasurer
Rosalia de Leon said this week she’s in talk with banks on a
plan to sell local-currency bonds to individuals.  “The main concern is due to the Fed tapering,” said
Ryanna Berza-Talan, who helps manage about $20 billion in assets
at  BDO Unibank Inc. (BDO)  in Manila, the nation’s largest lender.
“There’s also speculation about an upcoming retail-bond sale.”  The peso fell 1.1 percent to 43.67 per dollar as of 11:41
a.m. in Manila, according to data from Tullett Prebon Plc. The
currency touched 43.675, its weakest level since June 1, 2012.
One-month implied volatility, a measure of expected moves in the
 exchange rate  used to price options, fell two basis points, or
0.02 percentage point, to 8.30 percent.  The yield on the 8 percent bond due August 2018 rose 20
basis points to 3.15 percent, its highest level since March 4,
according to Tradition Financial Services prices.  The Philippines sold a record 188 billion pesos ($4.3
billion) of 25-year retail bonds in October 2012. The Treasury
will release its third-quarter auction plan before month-end.  To contact the reporter on this story:
