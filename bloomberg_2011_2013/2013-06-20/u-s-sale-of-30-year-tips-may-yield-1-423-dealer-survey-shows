The government’s auction of $7
billion of 30-year Treasury Inflation Protected Securities will
draw yield of 1.423 percent, according to the average forecast
of six of the  Federal Reserve ’s 21 primary dealers in a
Bloomberg News survey.  The sale is the 10th 30-year TIPS offering since auctions
of the security resumed in February 2010 after the Treasury
stopped selling them in 2001. The bonds, which mature in
February 2043, yielded 1.395 percent in pre-auction trading.
Bids are due by 1 p.m. New York time.  The securities yielded 0.639 percent on Feb. 21 at the last
sale after drawing a record auction low of 0.479 percent at the
Oct. 18 offering.  The February sale’s bid-to-cover ratio, which gauges demand
by comparing the amount bid with the amount offered, was 2.47,
versus an average of 2.69 at the nine auctions since 2010.  Indirect bidders, a category of investors that includes
foreign central banks, bought 54.5 percent of the securities at
the February sale, higher than the average of 42.4 percent at
the past nine auctions.  Direct bidders, non-primary-dealer investors that place
their bids directly with the Treasury, purchased 14 percent of
the securities at the February sale, versus a 17.7 percent
average at the past nine auctions.  The sale will raise $7 billion of new cash, as the public
holds no maturing securities, according to the Treasury.  Inflation-indexed notes pay interest at lower rates than
nominal Treasuries on a principal amount that’s linked to the
Labor Department’s consumer price index.  TIPS have lost 6.9 percent this year after returning 7.3
percent in 2012, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch’s
U.S. Inflation-Linked Treasury Index. The broader Treasury
market has fallen 1.9 percent this year, compared with a 2.2
percent gain in 2012, the indexes show.  The Fed’s primary dealers trade Treasuries with the central
bank and are obligated to participate in Treasury sales.  To contact the reporter on this story:
