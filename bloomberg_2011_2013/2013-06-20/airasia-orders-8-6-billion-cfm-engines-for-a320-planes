AirAsia Bhd. (AIRA) , the region’s biggest
budget carrier, selected an engine venture between  General
Electric Co. (GE)  and  Safran SA (SAF)  to power 100 new planes it ordered in
December.  The order for CFM International engines is valued at $8.6
billion at list prices, Sepang, Malaysia-based AirAsia said in
an e-mailed statement yesterday. The airline already operates
more than 120 Airbus  A320s  powered by the venture’s products.  AirAsia, Airbus’s biggest customer for single-aisle planes
in Asia, has ordered more than 300 aircraft since 2011 as
economic growth spurs  travel demand  in the region. Some 15 low-fare carriers started flying in the past decade across Asia-Pacific, the most profitable region worldwide for at least the
fourth consecutive year, according to the  International Air
Transport Association .  AirAsia’s deal also includes a 20-year agreement that CFM
will guarantee maintenance costs on a dollar per engine flight
hour basis, according to the statement.  AirAsia’s order in December included 36 current-generation
A320s and 64 fuel-efficient A320neos.  To contact the reporter on this story:
