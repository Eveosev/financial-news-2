The  California Public Employees’
Retirement System , the largest U.S. public pension, reported a
14.3 percent gain on invested assets for the first 10 months of
its fiscal year as stocks soared to records.  The fund’s performance through April, announced yesterday
by Theodore Eliopoulos, the senior investment officer for real
assets, means the $261.6 billion fund is set to beat its assumed
7.5 percent rate of return for a second consecutive year. Its
assets gained 13.3 percent in fiscal 2012, which ended June 30.  The increase so far this year “reflects very strong
performance of public equity over the last 10 months,”
Eliopoulos said at a meeting of the fund’s board in  Sacramento .
The  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index (SPX)  of U.S. stocks had a total
return of about 17 percent in the same period, touching 1,597.57
on April 30, a record that has since been eclipsed.  The pension, known as Calpers, in May passed its pre-recession high of $260.6 billion in assets, five years after the
global financial crisis wiped out more than a third of its
value. Local governments and state agencies have been forced to
help make up the loss to cover benefits promised to public
employees. The system serves about 1.7 million members.  Separately, the board approved rate increases averaging
about 3 percent for members’ health-care insurance in 2014.  Calpers, fully funded when the recession began in December
2007, had about 74 percent of the money needed to meet long-term
commitments as of June 2011, the most recent figure available.  Eliopoulos, 49, took over day-to-day investment operations
from Chief Investment Officer  Joe Dear , 62, who is being treated
for prostate cancer, the fund said June 14.  To contact the reporter on this story:
