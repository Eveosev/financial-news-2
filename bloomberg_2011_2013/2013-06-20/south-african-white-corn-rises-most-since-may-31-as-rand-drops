South African white-corn futures
rose the most in almost three weeks after the rand declined for
a fifth day, making imports of the grain more expensive.  White corn for delivery in July, the most active contract,
gained 3.5 percent to 2,372 rand ($231) a metric ton by the
close on the South African Futures Exchange in Johannesburg. The
advance was the biggest since May 31. Yellow corn added 3.5
percent to 2,339 rand a ton. Both varieties of the grain climbed
by the 80-rand daily limit.  The currency in  Africa ’s biggest economy dropped after a
report showed manufacturing in  China , the biggest buyer of South
African raw materials, shrank at a faster pace this month.  “The substantially lower rand moved corn prices up by
limits today,” Lindy van Blommestein, a trader at Johannesburg-based Farmwise Grains (Pty) Ltd., said by phone.  A meal made from white corn is a staple food in  South
Africa , the continent’s largest producer of the grain. The
yellow variant is mainly used to feed animals.  Wheat for delivery in July gained 2.6 percent to 3,650 rand
a ton.  To contact the reporter on this story:
