Citigroup Inc. (C) , the third-largest
U.S. bank by assets, named Moscow-based Zdenek Turek as head of
its Western Europe unit to replace James Cowles.  Czech-born Turek is currently in charge of Central and East
Europe, Denis Denisov, a spokesman said in an interview in St.
Petersburg.  “Zdenek will continue to split his time between London and
Moscow until we find a replacement,” Denisov said.  Citigroup Chief Executive Officer  Michael Corbat  overhauled
the firm’s operations outside the U.S. in January, naming Cowles
his successor as head of Europe, the  Middle East  and Africa. In
February, the firm hired former Credit Suisse Group AG banker
Luigi de Vecchi for the new position of chairman of continental
Europe for corporate and investment banking.  From 2005 to 2008, Turek was country officer for the bank
in South Africa and Hungary. He joined the lender in 1991 in
Prague, where he held corporate banking positions before moving
to Citigroup in Romania in 1998 as country head.  To contact the reporter on this story:
