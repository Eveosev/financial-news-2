Nissan Motor Co. (7201) , seeking to be the
biggest mass-market seller of electric vehicles, said it will
offer an option to U.S. owners of its Leaf hatchback to upgrade
to the latest lithium-ion battery technology.  Starting in the first half of 2014, the Yokohama, Japan-based automaker will set up the program for customers to
exchange battery packs, charging about $100 a month, Nissan said
in an e-mailed statement. Currently, the automaker guarantees to
replace or fix Leaf battery packs that fall below a certain
performance level within the first five years of ownership, or
60,000 miles (96,540 kilometers).  “Technology is evolving and battery prices are projected
to decline as EVs become increasingly mainstream,” Erik
Gottfried, Nissan’s director of North American electric vehicle
sales, said in the statement. The optional program “affords
more flexibility for the future so that customers can both
upgrade to the latest available technology for their Leaf and
enjoy more predictable vehicle operating costs.”  The evolving battery vehicle market has forced carmakers to
be flexible in how they sell their models.  Honda Motor Co. (7267) 
recently cut the lease price for its electric Fit and Nissan
repriced the Leaf model line for 2013, adding a modified
lithium-ion pack that recharges faster and has improved range.
 Tesla Motors Inc. (TSLA) , which led North American electric car sales
in the first quarter, is building a U.S. network of supercharger
devices to let customers recharge in about 30 minutes.  Leaf Sales  Nissan said details of the battery replacement program are
still being worked out.  Leaf sales have almost tripled this year to 7,614 through
May, according to the company. The company has declined to say
how many of the cars it plans to sell this year, after falling
short of initial volume targets in 2011 and 2012.  The base model Leaf, now built in Smyrna,  Tennessee , costs
$28,800, down from $35,200 for the previous entry-level model.
The car averages  75 miles per charge , up from 73 miles
previously, and qualifies for a $7,500 federal tax credit. The
2013 Leaf can be repowered in three hours using a 240-volt
electric outlet, half the time previously required, the company
has said.  Nissan’s North American unit is based in Franklin,
Tennessee.  To contact the reporter on this story:
