Spanish bonds led a decline in
European  government securities  after Federal Reserve Chairman
 Ben S. Bernanke  said U.S. policy makers may end asset purchases
in mid-2014, sparking a global rout in fixed-income investments.  Spain’s 10-year yields surged the most in 11 months after
demand fell at an auction of 4 billion euros ($5.28 billion) of
debt. Italian and Portuguese bonds also slumped. German 10-year
yields climbed to the highest level since February after
Bernanke said yesterday that the Fed may “moderate” its $85
billion in monthly purchases this year if growth is consistent
with the Fed’s forecasts.  “The Fed move makes the price of most asset classes look
wrong,” said  Harvinder Sian , a senior fixed-income strategist
at Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc in  London . “Higher-yielding
European assets like  Portugal  are getting hurt and Italy and
 Spain  aren’t far behind. In a world where they’ve been doing
well it doesn’t take a lot to shake the market.”  Spain’s  10-year yield  climbed 33 basis points, or 0.33
percentage point, to 4.87 percent at 4:37 p.m. London time, the
biggest increase since July 5. The 5.4 percent bond maturing in
January 2023 fell 2.61, or 26.10 euros per 1,000-euro face
amount, to 104.  Spanish yields are still down from a euro-era record 7.75
percent on July 25. Spanish securities handed investors a return
of 6.1 percent this year, according to Bloomberg World Bond
Indexes. German bonds have lost 0.9 percent and Italian bonds
earned 3.3 percent in the same period.  The rate on Italian  10-year (GDBR10)  debt increased 29 basis points
to 4.55 percent. Portugal’s  10-year yields  jumped 34 basis
points to 6.41 percent.  Fed Purchases  The Fed will probably start to reduce its $85 billion in
monthly bond buying this year and halt purchases around mid-2014
as long as the world’s largest economy performs in line with Fed
projections, Bernanke said to reporters yesterday in  Washington 
after a two-day meeting of the  Federal Open Market Committee .  Euro-area government securities fell with 10-year
Treasuries even as an industry report showed services and
manufacturing output in the region shrank less than economists
forecast in June. U.S. 10-year yields climbed to as high as 2.47
percent, the highest since August 2011.  “Markets are likely to remain volatile and investors risk-averse,” Gary Dugan, Singapore-based chief investment officer
for  Asia  and the  Middle East  at Coutts & Co., wrote in an e-mailed note to clients. “The  Federal Reserve  is determined to
taper quantitative easing before the end of the year.”  Spain Sale  Spain allotted 1.52 billion euros of 4.4 percent bonds
maturing in October 2023 at an average yield of 4.77 percent. It
last sold 10-year securities on June 6 at 4.517 percent, the
 lowest level  for that maturity since September 2010. Investors
bid for 1.84 times the amount on offer, down from 2.52 times
last month. Spain also sold debt maturing in 2018 and 2021.  Spain has raised 76.8 billion euros through mid- and long-maturity debt issuance as part of its 2013 funding program, the
nation’s economy ministry said in a statement.  The  composite index  of euro-area services and
manufacturing, published by Markit Economics and based on a
survey of  purchasing managers , rose to 48.9 this month from 47.7
in May. The median of estimate in a Bloomberg News survey was
for an increase to 48.1. A reading below 50 signals contraction.  Germany ’s 10-year bund yield climbed 10 basis points to
1.66 percent after rising to 1.68 percent, the highest since
Feb. 20. Two-year German yields increased eight basis points to
0.24 percent. They touched 0.25 percent, the most since Feb. 4.  Treasuries underperformed their euro-area counterparts this
week, with the  extra yield  investors demanding to hold 10-year
U.S. securities instead of German ones widening to 73 basis
points, up from 62 basis points last week.  Most Volatile  Volatility on Belgian bonds was the highest among euro-region markets today followed by those of Spain and the
Netherlands, according to measures of 10-year debt, the yield
spread between two- and 10-year securities, and credit-default
swaps.  Belgian 10-year yields  increased 19 basis points to 2.54
percent, while similar-maturity Dutch rates rose 15 basis points
to 2.07 percent.  France  sold 3.3 billion euros of three-year notes at an
average yield of 0.5 percent, up from 0.21 percent at a previous
sale on May 16. It also auctioned 4.1 billion euros of five-year
debt at 1.24 percent. That compares with a rate of 0.74 percent
at a prior sale on May 16.  France also auctioned inflation-linked securities, while
Ireland sold 91-day bills.  To contact the reporters on this story:
