Samsung C&T Corp. (000830) , South Korea’s
second-biggest construction company, reduced by C$2 billion
($1.9 billion) a planned investment in Canada’s renewable-energy
industry.  Samsung is leading a group that will invest C$5 billion to
develop 1,369 megawatts of renewable-energy capacity in the
province by 2016, it said today in a statement. The Seoul-based
company pledged in 2010 to spend C$7 billion to develop 2,500
megawatts of wind and solar projects.  Marcus Staviss, a Samsung spokesman, and Ontario Energy
Ministry spokeswoman Beckie Codd-Downey declined to give a
reason in phone interviews today.  They both said the change was unrelated to a World Trade
Organization ruling May 6 upholding a complaint filed by the
European Union and Japan against Ontario. The province offers
above-market rates for electricity from renewable-power projects
that use components produced in the province. The WTO said the
policy violates its rules requiring imported goods to be treated
the same as domestic goods.  The decision to re-negotiate the contract was “related
specifically to our agreement with the government of Ontario,”
Staviss said.  Samsung is developing solar projects in Ontario as well as
wind farms in partnership with Pattern Energy LP and  Capital
Power Corp. (CPX)  Its suppliers include CS Wind Corp.,  Siemens AG (SIE)  and
 SMA Solar Technology AG. (S92)   To contact the reporter on this story:
