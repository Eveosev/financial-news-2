Palestinian Prime Minister Rami Hamdallah submitted his resignation to President  Mahmoud Abbas 
today, quitting two weeks after taking office, according to a
statement posted on the website of the official Wafa Palestinian
news agency.  Hamdallah stepped down because he felt he was being given
insufficient authority, Ihab Besieso, a spokesman for the prime
minister’s office, said in a telephone interview.  Hamdallah, 54, who was previously president of An-Najah
University in the West Bank city of Nablus, had been appointed
by Abbas to replace Salam Fayyad, who resigned in April.  While often clashing with Abbas, Fayyad won the trust of
bankers and foreign donors because of his campaign to root out
corruption and build the governing foundations for a Palestinian
state. The  International Monetary Fund , where Fayyad worked for
14 years, said in March that the Palestinian Authority’s ability
to govern was being eroded by its financial difficulties.  Without foreign aid, Abbas’s government would face a budget
deficit of more than 7 percent of gross domestic product at a
time when  government borrowing  from local banks is, according to
the  World Bank , “at the limit that the banking sector can
sustain.” Foreign aid accounts for about 14 percent of GDP,
while public-sector jobs are 22 percent of total employment,
according to the World Bank.  To contact the reporters on this story:
