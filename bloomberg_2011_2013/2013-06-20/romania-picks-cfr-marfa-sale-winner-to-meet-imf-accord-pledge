Romania selected private railway
operator  Grup Feroviar Roman SA  as the winner in the bidding for
rail freight company CFR Marfa SA, meeting a deadline set under
the country’s international bailout agreement.  Grup Feroviar Roman offered about 905 million lei ($264
million) for a 51 percent stake by today’s deadline agreed with
the  International Monetary Fund , Transport Minister Relu
Fenechiu told reporters in Bucharest today. The bidder also
offered to invest about 900 million lei in the unprofitable
company, he said.  The sale of CFR Marfa is part of Romania’s 5 billion-euro
($6.6 billion) precautionary loan agreement with the European
Union and the IMF, whose board of directors is scheduled to
discuss the country’s progress  on June 26 . Romania is trying to
complete its second accord by the end of June after asking for a
three-month extension.  “We’ve completed the actions needed before the IMF board
meeting and we’ve shown our commitment, so I’m optimistic about
the results,” Prime Minister Victor Ponta said on Realitatea TV
today. “We can talk about another agreement afterwards, if the
European Commission agrees to it.”  The leu lost 0.4 percent to 4.5231 per euro by 7:27 p.m. in
Bucharest, weakening for the third day. The benchmark BET stock
index fell 0.9 percent to 5,327.66, its biggest decline this
month.  Romania  raised 315 million lei from the sale of a 15
percent stake in Transgaz SA in April and paid overdue debt to
companies, one of the conditions to complete its agreement for
the IMF loan, from which it hasn’t drawn any money so far.  To contact the reporter on this story:
