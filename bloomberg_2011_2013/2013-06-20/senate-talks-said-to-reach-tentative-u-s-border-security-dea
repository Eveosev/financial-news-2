Bipartisan U.S. Senate negotiators
agreed on a proposal to strengthen border-security provisions in
a proposed comprehensive revision of immigration law, a
congressional aide said.  The agreement would double the size of the U.S. Border
Patrol and require 700 miles of border fencing, said the aide,
who spoke on condition of anonymity to describe the private
talks.  The Senate plans to vote today on a separate proposal by
Texas Republican  John Cornyn  that would require the government
to show it is apprehending 90 percent of people illegally
crossing the border from  Mexico  before undocumented immigrants
could gain permanent legal residency. Democrats and some
Republicans say that plan could scuttle bipartisan support for
the legislation.  To contact the reporter on this story:
