Chinese power companies and Japanese
trading houses are emerging as major financiers of African
renewable energy projects, which saw investment quadruple to
$9.3 billion last year, Baker & McKenzie LLP said.  “Asian investors are increasingly targeting African
renewable energy projects,” attracted by better returns and
strong wind and solar resources on the continent, the Chicago-based law firm said in report today based on a global survey of
140 industry executives.  Recent deals include the 20-billion-yen ($205 million)
Dorper wind farm in South Africa that sold a 60 percent stake to
 Sumitomo Corp. (8053)  and was partially debt financed by Sumitomo
Mitsui Banking Corp., it said. The Export-Import Bank of China
also provided $315 million of loans for a 360-megawatt
hydropower station in  Zambia , according to the report.  Last year, Asia-Pacific companies and investors announced
$6 billion of acquisitions of renewable energy assets outside of
their region, compared with $1.9 billion in 2011, according to
the report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
