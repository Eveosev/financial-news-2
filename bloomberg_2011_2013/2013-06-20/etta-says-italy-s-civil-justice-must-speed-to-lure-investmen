Italian Prime Minister Enrico Letta
said he’d seek to speed up the civil-justice system and crack
down on informal associations that undermine the rule of law.  “My goal, possibly my primary goal, is to work for a
trustworthy  Italy ,” Letta said today at Rome’s Foreign Press
association. “The issue of the slowness of civil justice is one
of the key questions determining the trustworthiness or
otherwise of a country.”  Letta, installed in April with support from former premier
Silvio Berlusconi, announced a bill last week to increase
mediation of pending cases and boost court staffs with interns.
The administration will also seek to eliminate what Letta called
“shortcuts,” which allow insiders to skirt the rules.  “The shortcut is the way in which some people who have
friendships and connections can obtain results,” Letta said.
“The word shortcut must be eliminated from our vocabulary.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
