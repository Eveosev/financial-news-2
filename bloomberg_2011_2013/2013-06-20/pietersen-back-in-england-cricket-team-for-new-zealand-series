Kevin Pietersen will return to the
 England  cricket squad for the two-match Twenty20 series against
New Zealand at the Oval in  London .  Eoin Morgan will be captain for the series, which starts
June 25, with the second game taking place two days later.
Pietersen is returning from a knee injury, and hasn’t played for
the national team since March.  He won’t play in the first match, but will be back for the
second game should he successfully play for Surrey June 21, the
England and Wales Cricket Board said today on its website.  Yorkshire batsman Gary Ballance and Warwickshire bowler
Boyd Rankin were named to an England squad for the first time.  England defeated New Zealand 2-0 in their Test series, and
the visitors won the one-day series, 2-1. The teams have been
participating in the International Cricket Council’s Champions
Trophy, with England reaching this weekend’s final.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
