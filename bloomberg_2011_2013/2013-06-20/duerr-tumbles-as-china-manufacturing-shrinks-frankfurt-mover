Duerr AG (DUE)  fell the most in 2 1/2
months after a report showed  China ’s manufacturing industry, a
key market for the German maker of painting plants for the
automobile industry, shrank more than economists had predicted.  Shares in Bietigheim-Bissingen, Germany-based Duerr  dropped 
as much as 7.3 percent, the most since April 5, and were trading
3.9 percent lower at 46.87 euros as of 9:42 a.m. in Frankfurt.
About half the three-month daily average number of shares
traded.  “Some 30 percent of Duerr’s business is in China, so while
the manufacturing decline isn’t a game changer for them, it has
an impact on the market’s sentiment,” Hamburg-based Hauck &
Aufhaeuser analyst Philippe Lorrain, who has a hold rating on
Duerr stock, said by telephone.  Chinese manufacturing slipped to 48.3 in the preliminary
reading of a  Purchasing Managers’ Index (EC11FLAS)  released today by HSBC
Holdings Plc and Markit Economics, less than the 49.1 median
estimate of 15 economists in a Bloomberg News survey.  Of the 680 million euros ($859 million) in new orders the
118-year-old German company received in the first quarter, 45
percent came from China, driven by rising demand for passenger
cars, Duerr said last month.  Duerr, which counts  General Motors Co. (GM) , Bayerische Motoren
Werke AG and  Toyota Motor Corp. (7203)  among its customers, reported a
22 percent increase in first-quarter earnings before interest
and taxes to 36 million euros in May. Sales slipped 3.5 percent
to 543 million euros.  To contact the reporter on this story:
