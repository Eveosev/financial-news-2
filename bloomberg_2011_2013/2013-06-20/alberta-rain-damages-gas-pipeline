Heavy rain in southern  Alberta  is
probably the cause of a ruptured natural  gas pipeline  and
threatens flooding in the city of Calgary, home to  Canada ’s oil
industry.  Calgary has imposed a state of emergency with residents in
low-lying areas near the Elbow River being evacuated, the city’s
 website  said. The town of High River, 48 kilometers (30 miles)
south of Calgary, experienced “extremely dangerous and rapid
flooding,” while further west near the town of Turner Valley a
pipeline owned by  Legacy Oil & Gas Inc. (LEG)  leaked hydrogen sulfide,
the Alberta Emergency Management Agency said on its  website .  Emergency responders evacuated 39 people from Turner Valley
after the natural gas leak, Alberta Energy Regulator spokeswoman
Cara Tobin said in a phone interview from Calgary. The cause of
the leak hasn’t been determined, but there’s a “high
probability” that it was caused by the flood, she said.  Residents in the area near the pipeline were being
evacuated by emergency responders due to the risk of exposure to
toxic gas from the leak, according to the agency. No dangerous
levels of hydrogen sulfide were detected by air monitoring
equipment, Tobin said.  Canadian broadcaster CBC reported that about half of High
River, with a population of about 13,000 people, had been
flooded.  To contact the reporters responsible for this story:
