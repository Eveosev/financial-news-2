Steel reinforcement-bar futures in
 Shanghai  declined, snapping a five-day rally, on renewed concern
that  China ’s supply may outpace demand as steelmakers added
output and as manufacturing slows.  Rebar for delivery in October on the Shanghai Futures
Exchange lost as much as 1.1 percent to 3,486  yuan  ($569) a
metric ton and was at 3,493 yuan at 10:56 a.m. in Beijing.
Futures have retreated 12 percent this year.  China’s daily crude steel output rose 0.1 percent to 2.16
million tons in early-June versus late-May, Hu Yanping, an
analyst at Custeel.com, said yesterday, citing data from the
China Iron & Steel Association. Output from major steel
companies rose 1.3 percent during the same period.  “The rebounding output reminded market participants that
the chronically oversupplied steel market isn’t about to get
better,” Ren Xinlei, an analyst at Luzheng Futures Co., said
today by phone from Jinan. Cash-market transactions also cooled
yesterday as the market turned “downbeat,” he said.  The preliminary reading of 48.3 for a  Purchasing Managers ’
Index released today by HSBC Holdings Plc and Markit Economics
compares with the 49.1 median estimate in a Bloomberg News
survey of 15 economists. May’s final reading of 49.2 was the
first below 50 since October, indicating contraction.  Iron ore  prices for immediate delivery at Tianjin port in
China yesterday gained 2 percent to $120 a dry ton, rising for a
fifth day, according to The Steel Index Ltd. The raw material is
a key ingredient for steel production.  The average  spot price  for rebar in China was unchanged at
3,387 yuan a ton yesterday, according to data from Beijing
Antaike Information Development Co.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
