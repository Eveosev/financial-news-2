  Shanghai  Donghai Wind Power Co.
expects to begin building the second phase of its Donghai Bridge
wind farm near Shanghai at the end of the year.  The 100.8 megawatt offshore facility will cost 1.9 billion
 yuan  ($310 million), Vice General Manager Zhang Kaihua said in
an interview in Shanghai. The project, which will take 20 months
to build, will use 28 turbines from  Shanghai Electric Group Co. (601727) 
capable of producing 3.6 megawatts each, he said.  “The project is subject to approval from the Shanghai
Development and Reform Commission,” Zhang said yesterday.  China’s goal of boosting offshore wind power capacity to 30
gigawatts by 2020 has spurred interest among developers ranging
from  China Longyuan Power Group Corp. (916)  to China Datang Corp.
Renewable Power Co. Some 3.95 gigawatts of offshore projects
have been approved so far, according to data from the China
Renewable Energy Engineering Institute.  Shanghai Donghai began operating a 102-megawatt offshore
farm adjacent to the Donghai Bridge, also known as the East
China Sea Bridge, in 2010. The 32.5 kilometer (20 mile)
crossing, one of the longest cross-sea bridges in the world,
connects mainland Shanghai and the offshore Yangshan deep-water
port.  To contact the reporter on this story:
