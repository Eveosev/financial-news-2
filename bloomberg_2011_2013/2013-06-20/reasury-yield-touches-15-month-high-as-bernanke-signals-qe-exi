Treasury  10-year (USGG10YR)  note yields climbed
to a 22-month high as  government bonds  tumbled from  Germany  to
New Zealand after Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said
policy makers may end bond purchases in mid-2014.  The U.S. yields pared the advance as riskier assets slid
and the high rate levels drew investors. Yields surged the most
since 2011 yesterday, when Bernanke said the Fed may slow its
$85 billion in monthly buying under quantitative easing later
this year if growth is in line with its forecasts. A Bloomberg
survey said it will cut purchases by $20 billion in September. A
sale of U.S. inflation-linked debt drew below-average demand.  “Bernanke made it clear that tapering QE was on the
table,” said  Ian Lyngen , a government-bond strategist at CRT
Capital Group LLC in  Stamford ,  Connecticut . “The fact that a QE
story has taken out a lot of the bid for stocks has on the
margin kept the Treasury sell-off from exacerbating, but in the
wake of the Bernanke press conference, the bearish sentiment in
the Treasury market appears likely to be with us for a while.”  The 10-year Treasury yield increased six basis points, or
0.06 percentage point, to 2.41 percent at 5 p.m.  New York  time
and reached 2.47 percent, the highest since Aug. 8, 2011,
according to Bloomberg Bond Trader prices. It jumped 17 basis
points yesterday, the most since October 2011. The price of the
1.75 percent security due in May 2023 dropped 17/32, or $5.31
per $1,000 face amount, to 94 6/32.  The  30-year bond  yield rose above 3.5 percent for the first
time since September 2011, reaching 3.55 percent before trading
at 3.51 percent.  Volume Jumps  Treasury trading  volume  at ICAP Plc, the largest inter-dealer broker of  U.S. government debt , increased 21 percent to
$567 billion, the highest level since May 31. The 2013 average
is $316 billion.  Yields on 30-year Treasury Inflation Protected Securities
climbed to 1.38 percent in daily trading before an auction of
the bonds, the highest level since August 2011.  A U.S. sale of $7 billion in 30-year TIPS drew a yield of
1.42 percent, the highest in two years. The bid-to-cover ratio,
which gauges demand by comparing the amount bid with the amount
of securities sold, was 2.47, versus an average of 2.69 percent
at the previous nine offerings since 2010.  “The TIPS auction was pretty awful given the concession
that we had,” said Aaron Kohli, an interest-rate strategist at
BNP Paribas SA in New York, one of 21 primary dealers that are
obligated to bid at U.S. debt auctions. “There just isn’t any
inflation pressure, and the markets aren’t buying that there
will be any inflation.”  Inflation Outlook  The yield  gap  between 30-year Treasuries and TIPS, a gauge
of traders’ expectations for consumer prices over the life of
the debt that’s called the 30-year break-even rate, shrank below
2.1 percentage points for the first time since May 2012,
reaching 2.099. The 10-year break-even rate touched 1.97
percentage points, the least since January 2012.  The Treasury Department said it will sell $99 billion of
notes next week: $35 billion in two-year securities on June 25,
an equal amount of five-year debt the next day and $29 billion
in seven-years on June 27.  Stocks slid, with the  Standard & Poor’s 500 (SPX)  Index dropping
2.5 percent and the MSCI World Index tumbling 3.5 percent.  Bill Gross , manager of the world’s biggest bond fund at
Pacific Investment Management Co., said 10-year yields may not
be able to maintain their increase.  A yield of “2.40 percent on the 10-year is a significant
barrier of support,”   Newport Beach , California-based Gross
said during a radio interview on “Bloomberg Surveillance” with
 Tom Keene  and  Michael McKee . “I don’t think it will last long
here.” Support is a chart level where orders may be clustered.  Bunds, Gilts  German bund yields rose 12 basis points to touch a four-month high of 1.68 percent, while U.K. five-year gilt yields
jumped as demand fell at a sale of the securities. The  gilt 
yields climbed as much as 24 basis points to 1.48 percent, the
highest level since Oct. 28, 2011.  New Zealand ’s 10-year  rate 
surged 30 basis points to 4.09 percent, the biggest jump since
October 2008.  The Fed will cut its monthly bond purchases to $65 billion
at its Sept. 17-18 policy meeting, according to 44 percent of
economists in a Bloomberg survey after a press conference by
Bernanke yesterday. In a June 4-5 survey, only 27 percent of
economists forecast tapering would start in September.  The central bank has been buying $45 billion of Treasuries
and $40 billion of mortgage securities each month to put
downward pressure on borrowing costs in its third round of asset
purchases. It has kept its  target rate  for overnight lending
between banks at zero to 0.25 percent since December 2008 to
support the economy.  Fed Statement  After a meeting of the  Federal Open Market Committee  that
ended yesterday, the Fed left unchanged its statement that it
plans to hold its target interest rate at almost zero as long as
unemployment remains above 6.5 percent and the outlook for
inflation doesn’t exceed 2.5 percent. Officials lowered
estimates for unemployment and inflation, while characterizing
the recent drop in consumer prices as transitory.  Policy makers now expect a jobless rate of 7.2 percent to
7.3 percent this year, according to forecasts released
yesterday, compared with 7.3 percent to 7.5 percent in their
March estimates. They predict unemployment will fall to 6.5
percent to 6.8 percent in 2014.  Rate Bets  The probability the central bank will increase its
benchmark rate target by at least a quarter-percentage point by
October 2014 was 39 percent, Fed funds futures showed. The
likelihood was 33 percent on June 18.  The excess return investors demand for holding longer-term
Treasuries surged above zero for the first time in 20 months
after Bernanke said policy makers may end bond buying next year.  The so-called term premium on Treasury 10-year notes turned
positive this week for the first time since October 2011,
according to a Columbia Management Investment Advisers LLC
model. The premium, which reached an all-time low of minus 0.64
percent last July, has been held down by Fed bond buying,
inflation about half what it was two decades ago, and global
demand for safe assets.  To contact the reporter on this story:
