Indonesia ’s rupiah forwards plunged
to the biggest discount to the spot rate in 21 months after
Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said the  Federal Reserve  is prepared to
begin phasing out its stimulus program.  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index of stocks dropped 2.6 percent
after Bernanke said yesterday the Fed will probably taper its
$85 billion in monthly bond buying later this year and halt
purchases around mid-2014 as long as the  U.S. economy  performs
in line with its estimates. The Indonesian government will raise
fuel prices this month and that will strengthen the rupiah so it
achieves the budget assumption for a 9,600 per dollar average
rate in 2013, Finance Minister Chatib Basri said yesterday.  “Offshore prices are affected by sentiment from comments
from the Fed that they plan to reduce bond-buying,” said
Suriyanto Chang, head of treasury at PT Bank QNB Kesawan in
Jakarta. “Just as Basri said, past experience shows that after
raising fuel prices the rupiah’s reaction is significantly
positive, so we expect the same to happen.”  One-month non-deliverable forwards for the rupiah declined
2.8 percent to 10,533 per dollar as of 9:34 a.m. in Jakarta and
touched 10,566, the weakest level since August 2009, data
compiled by Bloomberg show. The contracts traded as much as 6
percent weaker than the onshore spot rate, which fell 0.2
percent to 9,924, prices from local banks show.  One-month implied volatility in the rupiah, a measure of
expected moves in the  exchange rate  used to price options,
surged 1.74 percentage points to 14.92 percent.  ‘Assumption Isolated’  The local currency has averaged 9,723 so far this year,
which means it would need to trade at an average of around 9,477
for the rest of 2013 to meet the budget estimate. The nation
last increased fuel prices on May 24, 2008, after which the
rupiah gained 3 percent over the next 10 weeks. The nation also
raised prices twice in 2005, Basri said.  “The assumption is rather isolated,” said Andy Ji, a
foreign-exchange strategist at  Commonwealth Bank of Australia (CBA)  in
 Singapore , referring to the average rupiah estimate in the
budget. “Dollar demand will continue for a while as the market
is repricing the effect of the Fed tapering its stimulus.”  The yield on the 5.625 percent sovereign bonds due May 2023
was little changed at 6.69 percent, the highest level since
November 2011, prices from the Inter Dealer Market Association
show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
