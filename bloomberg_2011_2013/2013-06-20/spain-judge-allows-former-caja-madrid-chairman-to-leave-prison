A Spanish judge allowed Miguel Blesa, the former chairman of savings bank Caja  Madrid , to leave
jail.  Judge Elpidio-Jose Silva, who ordered Blesa be put behind
bars on June 5, authorized his release following a petition from
his defense lawyer and the public prosecutor, a spokesman for a
regional court in Madrid said by telephone today. Blesa may
leave the Soto del Real jail outside Madrid, where he was being
held without bail, he said.  The Provincial Court of Madrid yesterday annulled the
decision by Silva last year to re-open a probe into a loan made
by Caja Madrid to Gerardo Diaz Ferran, a former head of the
Spanish business lobby who was also a board member of the
lender. In its ruling, the Provincial Court said the probe had
become a “general cause to seek those responsible” for the
country’s economic crisis.  Silva had ordered Blesa’s imprisonment as he investigated
losses resulting from Caja Madrid’s purchase of a bank in
 Florida  in 2008. Caja Madrid was merged with Bancaja and five
other savings banks in 2010 to form  Bankia. (BKIA)  The banking group
needed a 22 billion-euro rescue ($29 billion) last year that led
Spain to seek bailout funds from Europe to salvage the industry.  To contact the reporter on this story:
