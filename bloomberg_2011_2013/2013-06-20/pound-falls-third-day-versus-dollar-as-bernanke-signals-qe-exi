The pound declined for a third day
versus the dollar after Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke 
said yesterday U.S. policy makers could next year end asset
purchases that have debased the U.S. currency.  Sterling dropped to the lowest level in two weeks against
its U.S. peer after Bernanke said the Fed may “moderate” its
$85 billion in monthly purchases, known as quantitative easing,
later this year if economic growth is consistent with its
forecasts. The U.K. currency was little changed versus the euro
before a report that economists said will show  retail sales 
increased in May. The U.K. Debt Management Office is due to
auction 4.75 billion pounds ($7.3 billion) of five-year gilts.  The pound dropped 0.3 percent to $1.5433 at 7:46 a.m.
London time after sliding to $1.5427, the lowest since June 6.
Sterling traded at 85.81 pence per euro after touching 85.91,
the weakest since May 30.  U.K. retail sales including fuel rose by 0.8 percent last
month after slipping by 1.3 percent in April, according to the
median estimate of 23 economists in a Bloomberg News survey.  A gauge of  manufacturing orders  rose to minus 12 this month
from minus 20 in May, the  Confederation of British Industry  will
say today, according to the median forecast of 13 analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg.  Sterling has strengthened 3.3 percent in the past three
months, the best performer after the euro among 10 developed-market currencies tracked by Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted
Indexes.  Europe ’s common currency gained 3.5 percent and the
dollar advanced 0.8 percent.  The U.K. last sold five-year debt on May 14 at an average
yield of 0.967 percent. That compares with a  record-low  0.787
percent, set at an auction on Nov. 20.  U.K. gilts have handed investors a loss of 1.8 percent this
year through yesterday, according to Bloomberg World Bond
Indexes. German bonds dropped 0.9 percent and Treasuries
declined 1.8 percent, the indexes show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
