Blackstone Group LP (BX) ,  Bank of America
Corp.  and  Citigroup Inc. (C)  agreed to pay a total of
$10.2 million to settle litigation over the buyout of hotel
owner Extended Stay.  Blackstone and the two banks were among defendants sued in
2011 by a trust established to recover money for creditors of
Extended Stay, which was sold by Blackstone in 2007 and filed
for bankruptcy about two years later.  The settlements were reached after court rulings in other
cases became an “impediment” to recovering damages, lawyers
for the trustee said in papers filed today in U.S. Bankruptcy
Court in Manhattan.  “The likelihood of the plaintiffs successfully obtaining
any recoveries against Citigroup, the Blackstone defendants and
Bank of America defendants through litigation is doubtful,” the
lawyers said.  The creditor trust claimed the buyout by  Lightstone Group 
left Extended Stay insolvent and that the hotel owner’s assets
were depleted by more than $100 million after the deal through
improper distributions, according to court papers. Lightstone
was also sued.  Under the settlement, Blackstone will pay $10 million to
the trust and Citigroup will pay $200,000, according to the
court filing. Both companies are based in New York. Bank of
America, based in Charlotte, North Carolina, and Citigroup were
advisers on the buyout.  The cases are Extended Stay Litigation Trust v. Blackstone
Group LP, 11-02254 and 11-02255,  U.S. Bankruptcy Court , Southern
District of New York (Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
