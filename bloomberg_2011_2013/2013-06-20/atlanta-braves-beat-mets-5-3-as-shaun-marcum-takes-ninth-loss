Chris Johnson  hit a three-run homer
and Jordan Schafer scored on a wild pitch as the Atlanta Braves
defeated the  New York  Mets 5-3 and handed starter Shaun Marcum
his ninth straight loss.  Johnson put the Braves ahead 3-0 in the fourth inning last
night and Schafer went home in the fifth as Marcum became the
third pitcher in Mets history to start the Major League Baseball
season with nine straight losses.  Atlanta’s Kris Medlen (4-7) gave up three runs on six hits
and struck out seven in seven innings at Turner Field in Atlanta.  Marcum surrendered five runs on six hits, walked four and
struck out six in 4 2/3 innings.  The Mets scored three runs to tie the game in the fifth
inning when Marlon Byrd and  Lucas Duda  got runs on a throwing
error by Medlen and Kirk Nieuwenhuis hit a run-scoring single.
The Braves recovered the lead in the bottom of the fifth.  Marcum’s record is the worst for a Mets pitcher since
 Anthony Young  (1-16) lost his first 13 decisions in 1993. The
other pitcher to begin a season with as many as nine consecutive
losses was Bob Miller, who started 0-12 in 1962 before winning
his final decision.  To contact the reporter on this story:
