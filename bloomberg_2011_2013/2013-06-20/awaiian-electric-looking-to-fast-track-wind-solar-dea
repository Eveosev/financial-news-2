Hawaiian Electric Industries Inc. (HE) ,
owner of the state’s largest utility, has asked regulators to
waive competitive bidding rules and allow it to negotiate
directly with the owners of five renewable-energy projects.  Hawaiian Electric will buy power from the solar and wind
projects under 20-year contracts at an average price of 15.9
cents a kilowatt hour, the current cost of generating
electricity from oil, the Honolulu-based company said late
yesterday in a statement. That’s about one-third lower than
prices paid to existing solar and wind-energy projects in Oahu,
according to the statement.  Under Public Utilities Commission rules, Hawaiian Electric
must hold a competitive bidding process for power-supply
contracts larger than 5 megawatts. The utility is asking to
waive those rules as it looks to meet state requirements to get
 15 percent  of its power from renewable sources by 2015.  “These projects represent an important first step as we
are starting to see lower market prices for renewable energy,”
Scott Seu, Hawaiian Electric vice president for Energy resources
and operations, said in the statement.  The five projects, with a combined capacity of 64
megawatts, may cut generation costs in the most  oil-dependant  of
U.S. states by about $7.4 million a year, Hawaiian Electric
said. Hawaiian Electric plans to have the projects producing
power by 2015.  To contact the reporter on this story:
