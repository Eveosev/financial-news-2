(Corrects name of clean technology investment company in
sixth paragraph.)  Billionaire Roman Abramovich’s
Ervington Investments Ltd. reached an agreement with an
Australian developer of gas-to-liquid fuel technology,  Linc
Energy Ltd. (LNC) , to study projects in  Russia .  Linc will study the use of technology known as underground
coal gasification with Ervington Investments’ LLC YakutMinerals
unit to make liquid fuels in northeastern Russia, the Brisbane-based company said today in a statement.  Linc, which has a UCG plant in  Uzbekistan , and the
Ervington Investments unit plan to cooperate on a project to
produce less-polluting liquid fuels to help the Chukotka region
of Russia decrease its reliance on imports, assuming they find
suitable coal resources, Linc said. Linc said in December that
it was in talks with Abramovich, owner of Chelsea Football Club.  Shares of Linc  dropped 2.1 percent to A$1.16 in Sydney
trading today as of 11:04 a.m. local time.  Australia ’s benchmark
index fell 1.2 percent.  Oxford Catalysts Group Plc (OCG) , a U.K. developer of small-scale
gas-to-liquid fuel technology, sold a 3.5 percent stake to
Abramovich earlier this year to help commercialize its process.  Ervington Investments, housed within Abramovich’s
investment company Millhouse LLC, was set up to fund clean
technology.  Underground coal gasification involves burning coal deep
underground, tapping stranded reserves to produce gas for use in
fuel production, electricity generation or as a material in
chemicals, according to Linc’s website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
