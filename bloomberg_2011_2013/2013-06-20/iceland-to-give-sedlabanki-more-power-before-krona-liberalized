Iceland introduced a bill to give
the central bank more power to conduct stress tests and impose
fines on financial institutions not complying with rules on
capital adequacy and liquidity in kronur and foreign currencies
prior to lifting  capital controls .  “It’s important that Sedlabanki has a clear overview over
liquid assets and the foreign exchange balance” of Icelandic
lenders,  according to the bill  posted on the parliament’s
website late yesterday. Once passed, the central bank will be
“able to gather the information it deems necessary to conduct
stress tests and other analysis in the run up to removing
capital controls.”  Iceland’s new government, which took office after winning
the April 27 elections, has set removing capital controls as a
key goal. The restrictions are blocking as much as $8 billion in
kronur-denominated assets from leaving the economy.  To contact the reporter on this story:
