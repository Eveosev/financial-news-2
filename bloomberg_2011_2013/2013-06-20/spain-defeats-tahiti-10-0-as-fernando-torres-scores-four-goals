Diego Forlan scored in his 100th
game for Uruguay to give his country a 2-1 win against Nigeria
at soccer’s Confederations Cup.  Forlan fired a rising left-foot shot past Nigeria
goalkeeper Vincent Enyeama in the 51st minute after John Obi Mikel had tied Diego Lugano’s 19th-minute opener at the Arena
Fonte Nova in  Salvador , Brazil.  Uruguay joined Nigeria on three points in Group B at the
eight-team tournament, a warmup for next year’s World Cup in
Brazil. World champion Spain tops the group with six points
after earlier routing  Tahiti  10-0.  Fernando Torres scored four times, David Villa got a hat
trick and David Silva added two goals at Rio de Janeiro’s
Maracana stadium as Spain racked up the biggest victory margin
in the competition’s history. The previous record was Brazil’s
8-2 defeat of Saudi Arabia in 1999.  Group B play ends June 23, when Spain faces Nigeria in
Fortaleza and Tahiti meets Uruguay in Recife. The top two in
each four-team pool advance to the semifinals.  Brazil  and Italy
have already secured a berth in the final four from Group A.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
