GEA Group AG (G1A)  is evaluating ways to
divest its heat exchangers unit as the German maker of food-processing equipment seeks to focus on its main business.  GEA will dispose of the unit in the “medium term” as it
sees limited potential for synergies with the rest of its
business, the Dusseldorf-based company said in a statement. GEA
expects to complete the separation by the end of 2014, a
spokeswoman said by telephone. A share offering, spin off and
sale are among options being considered.  “An intensive evaluation of all business units showed that
our technologies for the foodstuffs industry and their
application in alternative sectors have great growth
potential,” Chief Executive Officer Juerg Oleas said in the
statement. “We have to focus to grow our business.”  GEA, which was founded in 1881 as a metals trading company
and today makes milking machines and beer-brewing kit, is facing
declining sales in  Europe , its biggest market with 35 percent of
the total, as clients cut spending amid the region’s debt
crisis. Sales in western Europe slipped 3 percent in the first
quarter, while increasing 14 percent in  North America  and 5
percent in the Asia-Pacific region.  Operating earnings before interest and taxes at the heating
exchangers unit declined 26 percent to 18 million euros in the
first quarter as total operating Ebit slipped 2.2 percent to
73.1 million euros.  The company wants to increase the contribution of revenue
from the  food industry  to 70 percent to 75 percent of the total,
it said today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
