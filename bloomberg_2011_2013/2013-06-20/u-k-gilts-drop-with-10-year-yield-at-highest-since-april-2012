U.K. government bonds slumped,
pushing  10-year (USGG10YR)  yields to the highest in more than a year, after
Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said yesterday that
policy makers may end monetary stimulus as early as mid-2014.  Five-year gilt yields climbed to the  highest  in more than
19 months as investor demand for the securities declined to the
lowest since June 2012 at a 4.75 billion-pound ($7.3 billion)
auction of the debt.  Two-year (GUKG2)  rates jumped as a report showed
 retail sales  increased more than economists forecast in May,
weakening the case for further asset purchases by the  Bank of
England . The pound strengthened from the lowest level in three
weeks versus the euro.  “Yields are rising everywhere,” said  Orlando Green , a
fixed-income strategist at Credit Agricole Corporate &
Investment Bank in  London . “The gilt market is following on
that front. There’s still a lot of uncertainty around about how
much central banks will deliver going forward in terms of
keeping this ultra-loose monetary policy.”  Benchmark 10-year gilt yields rose 17 basis points, or 0.17
percentage point, to 2.30 percent at 4:44 p.m. London time,
after increasing to 2.32 percent, the  highest  since March 27,
2012. The 1.75 percent bond due September 2022 tumbled 1.335, or
13.35 pounds per 1,000-pound face amount, to 95.48.  Two-year yields climbed six basis points to 0.5 percent
after reaching 0.57 percent, the  most  since Nov. 3, 2011.  Bernanke said the Fed may “moderate” its $85 billion in
monthly purchases, known as quantitative easing, later this year
if economic growth is consistent with its forecasts.  Treasury Yields  The yield on Treasury 10-year notes rose as much as 12
basis points to 2.47 percent, the highest since Aug. 8, 2011.
The rate jumped yesterday by the most since October 2011.  Gilts, together with Treasuries and German bunds, have been
supported since the financial crisis erupted in 2007 as
investors sought haven assets. They extended gains after
 Greece ’s admission in 2010 that it had understated its  budget
deficit  sparked a bond selloff in the euro area.  Central banks from the Fed to the  Bank of Japan  cut
 interest rates  to record lows. The Bank of England has a 375
billion  target  for asset purchases.  The U.K. 10-year gilt yield, which fell to a record low
1.41 percent in July, is still about 1.59 percentage point less
than its average over the past decade. It rose as high as 5.56
percent in July 2007.  Treasury 10-year yields are about 1.20 percentage point
below their mean level since June 20, 2003. Similar-maturity
German  bunds  yielded 1.67 percent today, compared with a 10-year
average of 3.26 percent.  Gilt Auction  The U.K. sold five-year gilts at an average yield of 1.422
percent today, the Debt Management Office said. Investors bid
for 1.33 times the amount of securities on sale, down from a
bid-to-cover ratio of 1.78 at a previous auction on May 14.
That’s the  lowest  since June 12, 2012, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  The securities were allotted at 0.967 percent in May,
compared with a  record-low  0.787 percent set at an auction on
Nov. 20.  Five-year gilt yields climbed 21 basis points to 1.44
percent after reaching 1.48 percent, the highest level since
Oct. 28, 2011.  “It was very disappointing, and is a reflection of the
current negative sentiment,” said  Nick Stamenkovic , a fixed-income strategist at RIA Capital Markets Ltd. in Edinburgh,
referring to the auction result. “The hawkish statement by
Bernanke has clearly unnerved markets and we’ve seen as U.S.-
driven selloff.”  Sales Climb  U.K.  sales  including auto fuel jumped 2.1 percent from
April, when they fell a revised 1.1 percent, the  Office for
National Statistics  said. The median forecast of 23 economists
in a Bloomberg News survey was for a 0.8 percent increase.  The data add to signs the economic recovery is under way,
though consumers remain under pressure as inflation outpaces pay
growth and government spending cuts bite.  Bank of England policy makers voted 6-3 to keep their
asset-purchase target unchanged this month, the minutes of their
June 5-6 meeting published yesterday showed.  U.K. gilts have handed investors a loss of 1.8 percent this
year through yesterday, according to Bloomberg World Bond
Indexes. German bonds dropped 0.9 percent and Treasuries
declined 1.8 percent, the indexes show.  The pound gained versus all but two of its 16 major
counterparts.  The U.K. currency strengthened 0.5 percent to 85.44 pence
per euro after depreciating to 85.91, the weakest since May 30.
Sterling fell 0.2 percent to $1.5452 after sliding to $1.5415,
the lowest since June 6.  The pound has appreciated 4.4 percent in the past three
months, the best performer among 10 developed-market currencies
tracked by Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes. The euro
gained 4.1 percent and the dollar advanced 1.8 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
