Centum Investment Co.,  Kenya ’s
largest publicly traded investment group, snapped a four-day
losing streak and headed for the biggest gain in more than two
months as the company’s valuation lured buyers.  The stock jumped 4.9 percent to 21.50 shillings by the
close in the capital, Nairobi, the largest increase since May 2.
More than 280,000 shares traded, equal to 89 percent of the
three-month daily average.  During the four-day fall, the stock lost 11 percent,
cutting its price-to-earnings ratio to 5.83, compared with 14
for the  Nairobi Securities Exchange All-Share Index (NSEASI) ,  Africa ’s
third-best performing gauge this year, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. The NSE 20-Share Index, which measures
the biggest companies by market value and trading volume, has a
ratio of 16.4.  The “ratio is very attractive and after that drop we are
starting to see strong underlying demand,” Ted Macharia, a
research analyst at Nairobi-based AIB Capital Ltd., said by
phone.  Centum’s  profit  jumped to 2.51 billion shillings ($29.3
million) in the 12 months through March from 1.19 billion
shillings a year earlier, it said on June 5. Investment income
more than tripled to 3.91 billion shillings.  Shares of the company that invests in banks, breweries and
food processing have surged 74 percent this year, making it the
fifth-best performer on the all-share  index (KNSMIDX) , which gained 26
percent in the period. The measure is the eighth-best performer
globally in 2013 among 94 gauges tracked by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
