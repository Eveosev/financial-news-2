Peruvian stocks slumped, extending
the world’s worst decline in 2013, as metals dropped after the
 Federal Reserve  said it may pare monetary stimulus.  The  Lima General Index (IGBVL)  fell 5 percent to 15,739.83 at 1:33
p.m. in Peru, extending its decline this year to 24 percent.
Brazil’s Ibovespa has dropped 23 percent in the same period.  “Mining companies are leading the drop in the local
market,” Marco Contreras, an equity analyst at Lima-based
Kallpa Securities, said in a phone interview. “Companies linked
to domestic demand are also suffering from the comments made by
the Fed.”  Copper fell as much as 3.3 percent today in New York and
gold tumbled 5.2 percent after the Fed said it may reduce bond
purchases that have fueled gains globally. The two metals
account for half of Peru’s exports.  Rio Alto Mining Ltd. (RIO)  led losses among the Lima index’s
members, falling 16 percent to $1.98. Soc. Minera Cerro Verde
SAA slid 11 percent to $24.40.  Credicorp Ltd. (BAP) , which controls
Peru’s largest lender, retreated 4.1 percent to $124.58.  To contact the reporter on this story:
