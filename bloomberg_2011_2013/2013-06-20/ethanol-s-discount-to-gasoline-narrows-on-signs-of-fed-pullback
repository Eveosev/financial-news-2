Ethanol’s discount to gasoline
narrowed as the motor fuel plunged the most since April on
concern that the Federal Reserve will reduce economic stimulus.  The spread, or price difference, tightened 7.62 cents to
33.12 cents a gallon, a day after Fed Chairman Ben S. Bernanke
indicated the central bank may begin reducing bond buying this
year should risks to the economy abate.  “Global markets are in risk-off mode” following
Bernanke’s comments, said Justin Dirico, manager of the biofuels
desk at Eagle Energy Brokers LLC in New York.  Denatured ethanol for July delivery fell 2.9 cents, or 1.2
percent, to $2.456 a gallon on the  Chicago  Board of Trade.
Prices are up 12 percent this year.  Gasoline for July delivery tumbled 10.52 cents, or 3.6
percent, to $2.7872 a gallon on the New York Mercantile
Exchange. The contract covers reformulated gasoline, made to be
blended with ethanol before delivery to filling stations.  U.S. refiners must use 13.8 billion gallons of ethanol this
year under a 2007 energy law known as the Renewable Fuels
Standard, or RFS.  Output has averaged 827,000 barrels a day so far this year
through June 14, or about 12.7 billion gallons on an annualized
basis, data from the Energy Information Administration, the
Energy Department’s analytical arm, showed yesterday.  Production Cut  Companies across the Midwest tempered ethanol operations
after last year’s U.S. drought, the worst since the 1930s,
lifted corn prices and eroded returns to make the biofuel.  Corn for July delivery decreased 9 cents to $6.7325 a
bushel in Chicago. The corn crush spread, or the cost difference
between a gallon of ethanol and the corn needed to make it, was
unchanged at 1 cent, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Compliance with the ethanol blending law is tracked by
Renewable Identification Numbers, or RINs, certificates attached
to each gallon of biofuel that refiners can submit to the
government or trade.  Corn-based ethanol RINs  rose 2 cents to 93 cents and
 advanced RINs , which cover Brazilian sugarcane-based ethanol and
biodiesel, climbed 3 cents to $1.02.  Lower production of the fuel has led to record low seasonal
 supply  of the fuel, data compiled by Bloomberg show. Inventories
rose 2.9 percent to 16.5 million barrels last week, according to
EIA data, 22 percent lower than a year ago.  Spot Prices  In cash market trading, ethanol in Chicago sank 10.5 cents
to $2.44 a gallon; on the West Coast prices decreased 8.5 cents
to $2.745; in the U.S. Gulf the additive lost 7.5 cents to $2.54
and in New York the biofuel dropped 6.5 cents to $2.54 a gallon,
data compiled by Bloomberg show.  West Coast ethanol’s premium over the U.S. Gulf narrowed 1
cent to 20.5 cents, while Chicago’s discount to New York
expanded 4 cents to 10 cents.  The U.S.  imported  65,000 barrels a day of ethanol last
week, the first time the country has made foreign purchases of
the fuel since May 24, EIA data show.  Anhydrous ethanol in Sao Paulo cost $2.29 a gallon last
week, the lowest price since Nov. 9, data compiled by Bloomberg
show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
