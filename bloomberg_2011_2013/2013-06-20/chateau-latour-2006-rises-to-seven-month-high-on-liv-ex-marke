A case of 2006 wine from  Chateau
Latour , a first-growth Pauillac estate, sold for 4,200 pounds
($6,500) on the Liv-ex market this week, a seven-month high and
6 percent above its 2013 low.  The vintage fetched as much as 5,750 pounds a case on
London-based Liv-ex in September 2011 as appetite for Bordeaux
wines peaked and dropped as low as 3,800 pounds last August
after demand cooled. This week’s trade took place on June 18.  The Liv-ex Fine Wine 50 Index has risen 5 percent this
year, with an 8 percent gain in the 10 weeks to mid-March, pared
by a 3 percent decline since then. Price cuts on Bordeaux 2012
futures over the past two months have weighed on prices of other
vintages from the region.  The 2005 vintage is the second cheapest Latour of the last
seven years available on the market, ahead of only the 2007,
according to merchant data collated by  Liv-ex  on its Cellar
Watch website.  The vintage was awarded a 95 rating by U.S. wine critic
 Robert Parker , above the 2007 but below his ranking for the
following three vintages.  Latour has 78 hectares (193 acres) of vineyards in
production, of which 47 hecares around the chateau itself
qualify for its main wine, according to its  website . It is
planted with about 80 percent Cabernet Sauvignon grapes, 18
percent Merlot and 2 percent Cabernet Franc and Petit Verdot.  Since last year the estate no longer sells its wine in the
futures market, unlike most Bordeaux estates, opting instead to
mature it in its own cellars for subsequent release. The estate
is owned by French billionaire  Francois Pinault  and managed by
Latour’s President Frederic Engerer.  Editors: Peter Torday, Sheldon Reback  To contact the reporter on this story:
