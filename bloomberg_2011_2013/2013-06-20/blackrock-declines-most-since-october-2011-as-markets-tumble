BlackRock Inc. (BLK) , the world’s largest
asset manager, declined the most in more than 20 months, as
stocks and bonds worldwide fell after Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke 
said the  Federal Reserve  may start reducing fixed-income
purchases.  BlackRock fell as much as 6.7 percent, the biggest drop
since Oct. 31, 2011, and traded 5.5 percent lower at $253.80 by
11:42 a.m. in  New York  trading. Shares of New York-based
BlackRock hit a record high of $291.69 last month.  BlackRock, which manages $3.94 trillion for clients,
generates fees based on assets it oversees. Investors have been
pulling money from bonds as fixed-income markets worldwide have
declined on concerns the Fed will scale back its unprecedented
stimulus. Clients have also been fleeing emerging-market stocks
at the fastest pace in two years on the prospect of slowing
economic growth.  The firm’s $21 billion iShares iBoxx Investment Grade
Corporate ETF, which owns investment-grade corporate bonds,
plunged as low as $112.79 today, the lowest since December 2011.
BlackRock’s iShares MSCI  Emerging Markets  Index fell 3.3 percent
today to $37.33, the lowest in almost a year.  Bernanke said yesterday the central bank could start
reducing bond purchases later this year and end them in the
middle of 2014 if the economy continues to improve as the
central bank forecasts. The U.S. unemployment rate will fall to
6.5 percent to 6.8 percent by the end of 2014, Fed officials
predicted, possibly reaching the central bank’s stated threshold
to raise the benchmark lending rate.  To contact the reporter on this story:
