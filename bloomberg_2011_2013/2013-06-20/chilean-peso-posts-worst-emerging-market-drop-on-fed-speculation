Chile’s peso plunged to a one-year
low and swap rates surged after Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S.
Bernanke  said policy makers may begin scaling back U.S. monetary
stimulus this year.  The peso dropped 2.6 percent to 512.85 per dollar at 9:57
a.m. in Santiago, the steepest sell-off since September 2011.
The two-year swap rate rose 11 basis points to 4.81 percent.  Chile’s peso, which closed in local market trading
yesterday before Bernanke’s statement, led declines among
emerging-market currencies today as copper, the country’s main
export, plunged as much as 2.8 percent. Bernanke said yesterday
that the Fed may begin to phase out this year the bond-buying
program that has injected cash into the  U.S. economy  and fueled
demand for emerging-market assets.  “Bernanke clarified that the stimulus will clearly end by
mid-2014,” said Eugenio Cortes, head of currency forwards at
EuroAmerica Corredores de Bolsa SA in Santiago. “The market is
pricing that in and it’s hitting everything, especially in
 emerging markets .”  Forward points, which measure the gap between the spot peso
price and prices in the non-deliverable forwards market jumped
higher today. The three-month forward point rose to 7.35 pesos
per dollar, the highest since January 2009.  Foreign investors in the Chilean peso forwards market had a
$13.4 billion net short peso position on June 18, an increase
from $13 billion a day earlier, according to central bank data
published today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
