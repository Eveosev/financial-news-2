A rule that would require backup
cameras in new cars sold in the U.S. is being delayed until 2015
as regulators consider giving incentives in their safety ratings
to vehicles containing that technology.  U.S. Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood, who plans to step
down once his replacement is confirmed, announced the delay
today in a letter to Senate Commerce Committee Chairman  Jay Rockefeller , a West Virginia Democrat.  More analysis of the rule’s cost, which the agency had said
would be $2.7 billion or as much as $18 million per life saved,
is necessary before issuing the mandate, LaHood said in the
letter. The agency had previously delayed the rule three times,
most recently missing a Dec. 31 deadline.  Automakers have complained about the rule’s cost and that
as proposed it would apply to all vehicles, while they say it
makes sense only for larger ones.  The rule was required by a 2008 auto-safety law, signed by
President  George W. Bush , that was named for a  New York  boy who
died after his father accidentally backed over him.  To contact the reporter on this story:
