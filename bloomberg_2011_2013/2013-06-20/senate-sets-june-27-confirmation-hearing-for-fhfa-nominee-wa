The Senate Banking Committee will
hold a confirmation hearing on June 27 for North Carolina
congressman Mel Watt to lead the Federal Housing Finance Agency.  President  Barack Obama  nominated Watt, a Democrat, to head
the agency that oversees  Fannie Mae (FNMA)  and Freddie Mac, the
mortgage companies seized by the government in 2008.  It’s unclear how soon Watt’s nomination might get a vote on
the Senate floor. Watt’s record for assistance to struggling
homeowners has put him at odds with Senate Republicans whose
votes he’ll need to win confirmation.  If confirmed, Watt would replace Edward J. DeMarco, the
current head of the Fannie Mae regulator who has clashed with
Democrats over whether the agency should permit principal
reductions for struggling borrowers.  To contact the reporters on this story:
