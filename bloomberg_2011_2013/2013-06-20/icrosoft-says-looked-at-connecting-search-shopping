Microsoft Corp. (MSFT)  recently canceled an
early stage project looking at ways to combine its Bing Web
search with shopping, the company said without explaining why
the effort was abandoned.  “The project was a small scale incubation effort to enable
a more direct commerce model between customers and brands and
merchants,” the largest software maker said in a statement.
“The project was recently canceled, but we remain committed to
finding new and differentiated ways to enable a richer, more
task-oriented approach to e-commerce and online advertising.”  Microsoft’s Bing search engine, which lags market-dominating rival  Google Inc. (GOOG) , has experimented for several years
with shopping programs, including an effort that ended in 2010
which gave customers cash back on purchases. Besides increasing
search traffic, Microsoft has looked at options for bolstering
an ailing display advertising business.  The project, called Brazil, and its cancellation were
reported earlier by the Wall Street Journal, which described it
as effort to compete with online retailer  Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN)  and
Web marketplace  EBay Inc. (EBAY)   Microsoft, based in Redmond, Washington, said in its
statement that it’s “inaccurate to characterize Project Brazil
as conceived to compete with Amazon or EBay.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
