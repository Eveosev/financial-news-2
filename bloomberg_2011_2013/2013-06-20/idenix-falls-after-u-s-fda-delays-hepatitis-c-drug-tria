Idenix Pharmaceuticals Inc. (IDIX) , a U.S.
drugmaker that stopped development of two hepatitis C therapies
this year, plunged the most in almost three years after
regulators asked for more safety data on another experimental
treatment.  Idenix dropped 31 percent to $3.55 at the close in New
York, the biggest single-day decline since September 2010. Food
and Drug Administration officials said they needed more safety
information about IDX20963 for hepatitis C before allowing human
clinical trials to begin, the Cambridge Massachusetts-based
company said yesterday in a statement.  Idenix is among companies including  AbbVie Inc. (ABBV)  and  Gilead
Sciences Inc. (GILD)  seeking new medicines for the viral disease that
attacks the liver and affects an estimated 170 million people
worldwide. Analysts estimate the market for such new drugs is
$20 billion. The request for more data is expected to delay the
start of the clinical program for IDX20963, Idenix said.  “There is a lot more uncertainty right now in terms of
when it’s going to Phase 1, if at all,” said  Geoffrey Meacham ,
a JPMorgan Chase & Co. analyst who today lowered the rating on
the company to neutral from overweight. “I think it will, but
it could be a delay of three months or more,” he said in a
telephone interview.  Idenix in February stopped development of two experimental
hepatitis C therapies after a drug in the same class of
compounds from Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. was linked to heart
risks.  The company has declined 66 percent in the past 12 months.  To contact the reporter on this story:
