The cost of insuring corporate and
sovereign bonds in the Asia-Pacific region against non-payment
surged to the highest in more than ten months, according to
credit-default swap traders.  The Markit iTraxx Asia index of 40 investment-grade
borrowers outside  Japan  soared 19 basis points to 159 basis
points as of 8:26 a.m. in  Hong Kong , Australia & New Zealand
Banking Group Ltd. prices show. The benchmark is headed for its
highest close since Aug. 2 and biggest daily increase since
Sept. 20, according to data provider CMA.  The Markit iTraxx Australia index jumped 13.5 basis points
to 141 as of 10:34 a.m. in Sydney, according to Citigroup Inc.
prices. The measure is on track for its sharpest rise since
March 20 and to close at the highest level since Nov. 19,
according to CMA, which is owned by McGraw-Hill Cos. and
compiles prices quoted by dealers in the privately negotiated
market.  The Markit iTraxx Japan index increased 7.5 basis points to
116 as of 9:28 a.m. in  Tokyo , according to Citigroup. The gauge
is poised to close at the highest since March 5, CMA prices
show.  Credit-default swap indexes are benchmarks for insuring
bonds against default and traders use them to speculate on
 credit quality . A drop signals improving perceptions of
creditworthiness, while an increase suggests the opposite.  The swap contracts pay the buyer face value in exchange for
the underlying securities if a borrower fails to meet its debt
agreements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
