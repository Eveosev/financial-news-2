U.K. Environment Secretary Owen Paterson said the public should drop its decade-long opposition
to genetically-modified crops and allow the country to take a
lead in researching the subject.  Opposition to the technology when it was developed at the
end of the last century means there are no commercial GM crops
grown in Britain, according to the  BBC . Paterson said this meant
the country was missing out on environmental benefits such as
reduced use of pesticides, as well as the chance to develop new
science.  The Environment Secretary told BBC Radio 4’s “Today”
program that the U.S., which uses GM widely, had effectively
been taking part in “the biggest field trial in human
history,” with no harm to health.  “What’s the real evidence that this technology could
endanger life or limb?” Paterson asked. “I want to make sure
that the U.K. is leading the world going forward on the next
generation.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
