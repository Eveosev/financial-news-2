Copper on the London Metal Exchange
will probably fall as much as 9 percent in the next two months,
according to  technical analysis  from TransGraph Consulting Pvt.  Metal for delivery in three months may decline to as low as
$6,200 a metric ton, analyst Saumendra Satapathy said in an e-mail today. Copper, which entered a  bear market  in April, has
slumped 14 percent to $6,827.75 a ton this year.  “Prices are undergoing a downside corrective phase since
the year 2011 high of $10,190,” Satapathy said. The momentum in
the 14-week relative strength index, or RSI, and the weekly
moving average convergence-divergence, or MACD, has been weak,
hovering well below the equilibrium, he said.  The MACD indicator is a gauge of momentum derived by
subtracting a 26-day exponential moving average from the 12-day
average. A second measure, called the signal line, uses the
nine-day moving average of the MACD indicator. The RSI measures
the velocity of price changes to identify overbought or oversold
conditions and turning points.  In technical analysis, investors and analysts study charts
of trading patterns and prices to predict changes in a security,
commodity, currency or index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
