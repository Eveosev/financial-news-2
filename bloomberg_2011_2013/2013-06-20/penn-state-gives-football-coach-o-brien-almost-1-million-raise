Penn State football coach Bill O’Brien is getting a raise of almost $1 million in base pay
after leading the team to an 8-4 record in the aftermath of the
Jerry Sandusky child sex-abuse scandal and the death of coach
 Joe Paterno .  In his first season at the  State College , Pennsylvania-based school, O’Brien was selected the 2012 Big Ten Coach of the
Year and was named the Bear Bryant, Maxwell Football Club and
ESPN Coach of the Year nationally. The Nittany Lions went 8-4,
the most wins by a first-year coach in their 126 years.  “In the face of great adversity, Bill did a tremendous job
with all facets of the Penn State football program,” Athletic
Director Dave Joyner said in a statement on the school’s
 website . “This rightly recognizes Bill’s outstanding
achievements in guiding our student-athletes on and off the
field.”  O’Brien’s raise is $982,779, boosting his salary to $1.9
million, according to the contract. He was hired in January 2012
and was paid a base salary of $950,000 last season, the first
year of a four-year postseason ban for  Penn State  imposed by the
 National Collegiate Athletic Association  in reaction to the
Sandusky scandal. The NCAA also reduced football scholarships at
Penn State and fined the school $60 million.  When income from radio and television and a Nike contract
is included, O’Brien’s contract for the year beginning July 1
will be worth $3.3 million, according to a copy of the contract
posted to the school’s website. He is eligible for an additional
$200,000 in bonuses.  Penn State returns 16 starters and 38 letter winners for
the 2013 season, which begins Aug. 31 vs. Syracuse at MetLife
Stadium in  East Rutherford ,  New Jersey .  Sandusky is serving a minimum 30-year prison term after
being convicted of abusing 10 boys over a 15-year period.  Paterno, who set records for on-field success as the coach
of Penn State, died on Jan. 22, 2012, at the age of 85. He was
fired in November 2011 after 46 seasons at the university,
following criticism that he failed to contact police when told
of an abuse case involving Sandusky, an ex-assistant.  To contact the reporter on this story:
