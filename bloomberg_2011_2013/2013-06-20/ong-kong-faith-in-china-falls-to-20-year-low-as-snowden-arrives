Hong Kong residents’ disapproval of
the “one country, two systems” system that gives their city
autonomy from  China  rose to the highest level since before the
territory reverted to Chinese rule in 1997, a poll showed.  Some 47.2 percent of people participating in the  poll  said
they weren’t confident in the arrangement, compared to 47.1
percent who said they were, the  highest  level of dissatisfaction
since 1994, according to today’s survey by the Public Opinion
Program at Hong Kong University.  The survey was carried out June 10-13, around the time news
broke that former National Security contractor Edward Snowden
had fled to Hong Kong and revealed a secret U.S. surveillance
program. While Hong Kong Chief Executive Leung Chun-ying said
the city will handle any U.S. extradition request according to
the law, the case has raised concern that China will dictate
Snowden’s fate.  Thirty-two percent of respondents  said  they trusted the
Hong Kong government, down 12 percentage points from a March
survey, while 25 percent trusted the central government in
Beijing, also a 12 percentage point decline.  Hong Kong’s residents enjoy civil liberties such as freedom
of speech and freedom of assembly that people in the mainland
don’t have. They were guaranteed those rights for 50 years from
the 1997 handover from U.K. control.  The telephone survey of 1,055 people had a margin of error
of plus or minus four percentage points.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
