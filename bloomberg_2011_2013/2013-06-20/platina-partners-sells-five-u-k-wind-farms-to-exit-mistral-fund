Platina Partners LLP, a London-based
 investment company  with about 500 million euros ($659 million)
of equity under management, sold five U.K. wind farms to an
investor it didnâ€™t name.  The sale comprised the 20-megawatt Burton Wold park, the
15-megawatt Garves plant, the Pates Hill and Milton Keynes
farms, each with 14 megawatts, and the 6-megawatt Winscales Moor
venture, it said today in an e-mailed statement without
disclosing terms.  With the sale Platina closed the Mistral Windfarm 1 fund it
set up in 2005 to develop wind projects in the U.K. and  France .
The fund delivered a gross internal rate of return of more than
40 percent for investors, it said. Platina will continue to make
acquisitions for its current funds, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
