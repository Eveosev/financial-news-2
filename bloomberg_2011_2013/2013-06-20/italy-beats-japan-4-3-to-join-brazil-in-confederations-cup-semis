Italy rallied from two goals down to
beat Japan 4-3 and join tournament host Brazil in advancing to
the semifinals of soccer’s Confederations Cup.  Sebastian Giovinco’s 86th-minute goal broke a 3-3 tie in
Recife minutes after Japan twice struck the frame of the goal.
The Asian champion had led 2-0 on first-half goals from Keisuke
Honda and Shinji Kagawa before  Daniele De Rossi ’s header and an
own goal by Atsuto Uchida either side of the break made it 2-2.
 Mario Balotelli ’s 52nd-minute penalty kick then put Italy ahead
before Shinji Okazaki tied it with 20 minutes left.  Italy joined Brazil, which earlier beat Mexico 2-0, with
six points from two matches in Group A at the eight-nation
tournament, a warm-up event for next year’s  World Cup . The top
two in each four-team pool advance to the semifinals.  Neymarearlier scored the first goal and set up the second
in Brazil’s victory in Fortaleza.  In the second round of games in Group B tomorrow, world and
European champion Spain plays tournament newcomer  Tahiti  in Rio
de Janeiro and Nigeria takes on Uruguay in Salvador.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
