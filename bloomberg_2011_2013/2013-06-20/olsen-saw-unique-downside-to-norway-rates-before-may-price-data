Norway central bank Governor
Oeystein Olsen signaled that policy makers were preparing to cut
 interest rates  today before a report released earlier this month
showed inflation was higher than estimated in May  “It was uniquely on the downside at some point -- except
for the krone -- and then came these price figures which point
in the opposite direction, so in balance we ended up where we
were,” Olsen said today in an interview. Policy makers didn’t
consider cutting the rate today, he said.  Norges Bank decided to hold its benchmark deposit rate at
1.5 percent and signaled an increased chance for a cut this year
amid weakening economic growth in western  Europe ’s largest oil
producer.  Underlying consumer prices rose an annual 1.4 percent in
May, faster than the 1.03 percent estimated by the central bank,
a report on June 10 showed.  After cutting twice, Olsen has kept the benchmark unchanged
for more than a year while saying the bank is ready to act to
prevent krone gains from undermining its inflation target and
the economy. The krone has slid 7 percent this year versus the
euro as the bank also in March warned rates may be cut. It’s
still up 19 percent since the end of 2008.  Norway’s $480 billion economy is starting to suffer from
the fallout of the euro area’s shrinking economy, pushing
unemployment to the highest since May 2010 as companies also
struggle with a surging krone and manufacturing labor costs that
are nearly 70 percent higher than the European Union average.  To contact the reporter on this story:
