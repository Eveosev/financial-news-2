(Corrects sales in fourth paragraph of story originally
published June 21.)  Archer-Daniels-Midland Co. (ADM) , the
world’s largest corn processor, is in talks to sell its cocoa
unit, which swung to an operating loss in the first quarter amid
a squeeze on processing margins.  “We regularly evaluate strategic options and maintain
ongoing dialogue with other agribusiness companies to explore
opportunities,” Jackie Anderson, an ADM spokeswoman, said
yesterday in a statement. “These discussions are ongoing, and
there can be no assurance that they will result in the signing
of a transaction or definitive agreement.”  The cocoa unit posted a $22 million operating loss in the
first quarter, compared with profit of $159 million a year
earlier. Processing margins were lower because of an increase in
the industry’s grinding capacity, lower cocoa-powder prices and
customers using up inventories, the Decatur, Illinois-based
company said May 1.  ADM’s cocoa business is part of its oilseeds-processing
division and accounted for $833 million of sales, or 3.8 percent
of the company’s total first-quarter revenue, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  ADM paid $470 million for W.R. Grace & Co.’s cocoa business
in 1996, its largest acquisition prior to the A$2.2 billion ($2
billion) takeover bid for of  Australia ’s  GrainCorp Ltd. (GNC) 
announced in October.  To contact the reporter on this story:
