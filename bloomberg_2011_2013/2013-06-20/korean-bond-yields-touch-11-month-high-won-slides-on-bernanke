The South Korean won plunged to an
11-month low and the five-year government bond yield surged to
the highest since July 2012 after the Federal Reserve said it
may ease its stimulus that boosted flows to  emerging markets .  The Federal Open Market Committee yesterday left the
monthly bond purchases unchanged at $85 billion, with Chairman
Ben S. Bernanke saying the Fed may start tapering the program
later this year if the U.S. economy performs in line with
central bank projections. Foreign investors sold more South
Korean stocks than they bought for a 10th day, the longest run
of  net sales  in almost three months, while an offering of
inflation-linked government bonds this week raised less than a
10th of the planned 600 billion won ($524 million).  “The market reacted to the possibility of the Fed reducing
its bond-buying program, and on fears of outflows from emerging
markets,” said Jeon Seung Ji, an analyst at Samsung Futures
Inc. in  Seoul . “If the won weakens too much, the government
could step in to curb volatility.”  The currency fell 1.3 percent to 1,145.63 per dollar in
Seoul, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. It touched
1,146.55, the weakest level since July 26, 2012.  The yield on the 2.75 percent sovereign bonds due March
2018 rose 18 basis points to 3.16 percent, the highest level for
a benchmark five-year security since July 11, 2012, prices from
Korea Exchange Inc. show.  Bond Sale  South Korea sold 55.6 billion won of 10-year inflation-linked bonds, falling short of the planned amount of 600 billion
won, according to a statement posted on the Finance Ministry’s
website.  South Korea is closely monitoring financial markets and
preparing a contingency plan for the Fed’s early exit from
quantitative easing, a finance ministry official said in Seoul
today, asking not to be named due to government policy.  Separately, the Finance Ministry said there was no bond
sell-off by foreigners today. The rise in yields is a spillover
effect from U.S. Treasuries following Bernanke’s comments
yesterday, Kim Jin Myung, a director at the ministry’s treasury
bureau, said by phone.  One-month implied volatility, a gauge of expected moves in
the exchange rate used to price options, rose 106 basis points,
or 1.06 percentage points, to 11.78 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
