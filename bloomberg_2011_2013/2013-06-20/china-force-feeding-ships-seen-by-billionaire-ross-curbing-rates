Chinese shipbuilders will prolong a
glut of container ships and dry-bulk carriers because low
freight rates help the country’s development, according to
billionaire  Wilbur Ross .  Chinese companies control about 20 percent of the world’s
container ships delivering manufactured goods and build 40
percent of new vessels, the founder of WL Ross & Co. said in an
interview on Bloomberg TV’s “The Pulse” with Anna Edwards
today. The country wants to preserve jobs in the industry and
make its exports competitive by keeping transportation costs
low, he said.  “ China  has an incentive to keep rates down because it
facilitates their exports,” Ross said. “There’s a great danger
in those segments like container, and maybe bulk, that China
will continue to force-feed vessels and hold those rates down.”  Earnings slumped after owners ordered too many ships before
the global recession. The capacity of commodity carriers swelled
68 percent since 2009, more than double the pace of trade
growth, according to Clarkson Plc, the world’s largest
shipbroker. The container fleet expanded 45 percent while trade
advanced 20 percent, figures show.  Ross was among investors who bought a fleet of 30 tankers
hauling gasoline and diesel two years ago in a $900 million
transaction. His company also has a majority stake in  Navigator
Holdings Ltd. (NVIGF) , which controls one-third of the world’s midsized
carriers of liquefied petroleum gas.  To contact the reporter on this story:
