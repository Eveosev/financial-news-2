Morgan Stanley (MS)  will exit power and
natural gas trading in Bulgaria, the Czech Republic and Poland
as it scales back in commodities, a person with direct knowledge
of the matter said.  The bank, based in New York, will leave markets in eastern
Europe where it doesn’t have a competitive advantage, said the
person, who asked not to be identified because the plans are not
public. It will continue to trade western European power and
carbon permits, according to the person. Charles Rankin, the
bank’s London-based head of European commodities, declined to
comment on job cuts today when reached by phone.  “We will reduce our footprint in EU power and gas by
exiting some Eastern European markets,” the bank said today in
a memo to employees from Colin Bryce and  Simon Greenshields , co-heads of the unit, obtained by  Bloomberg News . “The commodities
revenue pool available to firms in our sector has fallen by
almost 50 percent from the peak years of 2007 to 2009.”  Morgan Stanley is cutting jobs in its commodities business,
one of the three biggest on  Wall Street , after Chief Executive
Officer  James Gorman  said last week the unit’s revenue in the
past two quarters was among its worst in 18 years. The latest
round of commodity redundancies will eliminate 30 to 35 jobs, or
about 10 percent of its workforce, the person said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
