Japan ’s  Topix index  fell for the
first time in five days on concern the Federal Reserve will
reduce stimulus if the U.S. economy continues to improve and as
data suggested  China ’s manufacturing shrank more than expected.  Developers and energy explorers lost the most among the
Topix’s 33 industry groups. Fanuc Corp., which supplies robotics
to Chinese factories, slid 3.2 percent. Most exporters fell,
with Toyota Motor Corp., Canon Inc. and Bridgestone Corp.
dropping at least 1 percent even as the yen weakened for a
fourth day.  Mizuho Financial Group Inc. (8411) , Japan’s third-largest
lender by market value, added 0.5 percent after it was upgraded
to buy at Goldman Sachs Group Inc.  The  Topix (TPX)  lost 1.3 percent to 1,091.81 at the close of
trading in Tokyo, with volume about 36 percent below the 30-day
average. All but five of its industry groups retreated. The
Nikkei 225 declined 1.7 percent to 13,014.58.  “The Fed announcement yesterday was within expectations,”
said Tomoichiro Kubota, a market analyst at online brokerage
Matsui Securities Co. “But there are concerns about the outlook
for global liquidity and foreign investors are withdrawing
capital, leading to a triple drop in stocks, bonds and the yen
in Japan.”  Japan’s 10-year bond yield added 3 basis points to 0.85 as
of 3:49 p.m. in Tokyo, while the yen weakened 1 percent to 97.45
per dollar. Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index fell 0.5
percent. The gauge yesterday lost 1.4 percent in New York, the
most in two weeks.  Reduce Pace  Stocks fell as Fed Chairman Ben S. Bernanke said yesterday
the central bank may reduce bond purchases later this year and
end them by mid-2014 “if the incoming data are broadly
consistent” with forecasts. The Federal Open Market Committee
left bond buying unchanged at $85 billion, while saying downside
risks to the economy and labor market have diminished.  “Ben is preparing the market and, as ever, scribes will go
over his every word and punctuation mark,” said Stuart Beavis,
head of institutional equity derivatives at Vantage Capital
Markets in Hong Kong. “We could easily see a reversal in market
fortunes. He has stopped the uncertainty that markets hate. Just
be prepared, Bernanke is telling us over a two-year view there
is a real chance of higher rates.”  In another drag on shares, data today suggested China’s
manufacturing contracted more than expected, adding to signs the
country’s slowdown is deepening. The preliminary reading for a
Purchasing Managers’ Index released by HSBC Holdings Plc and
Markit Economics was 48.3, compared with the 49.1 median
estimate of 15 economists surveyed by Bloomberg News. A number
below 50 indicates contraction.  China Data  Fanuc (6954) , which counts Asia excluding Japan as its biggest
market, dropped 3.2 percent to 14,200 yen, the second-biggest
drag on the Nikkei 225.  Hitachi Construction Machinery Co., which gets 12 percent
of its revenue in China, slumped 5.3 percent to 2,065 yen.  Toyota dropped 1 percent to 5,810 yen, Canon slipped 1.1
percent to 3,215 yen and Bridgestone fell 1.5 percent to 3,270
yen. Electrical appliance producers and carmakers were the
biggest drags on the Topix even after the yen weakened.  Mizuho gained 0.5 percent to 195 yen after Goldman Sachs
raised the lender to buy from neutral, citing improved capital
adequacy and moves to reduce strategic shareholdings.  Most regional gauges fell. The MSCI Asia Pacific Index
dropped 3.5 percent to 128.46 as of 3 p.m. in  Tokyo , its lowest
since Dec. 26. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index tumbled 2.7 percent,
heading for a nine-month low. The Hang Seng China Enterprises
Index of mainland stocks listed in the city slipped 3 percent.  Mothers Climbs  The Tokyo Stock Exchange Mothers Index of smaller companies
bucked the trend, adding 1.3 percent after retreating 3.6
percent yesterday.  The Topix has fallen about 14 percent from an almost five-year high on May 22. Shares have declined amid a strengthening
yen, disappointment about Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s growth
strategy and concern global stimulus will be reduced.  The Topix has swung an average of about 3.2 percent daily
since May 22. The gauge’s 30-day  historic volatility  was at
41.23 today, near its highest level since the 2011 earthquake
and tsunami.  Even after the recent fall, the Nikkei 225 and Topix are
still up more than 25 percent this year, retaining Japan’s
position as the best-performing major equity market.  The Topix may rise to 1,300 by the end of the year,
according to the median estimate of 17 strategists surveyed by
Bloomberg. Earnings for companies on the gauge will jump 53
percent this fiscal year to 78.85 yen a share, according to
analyst  estimates  compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporters on this story:
