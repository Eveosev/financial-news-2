Commodities tumbled as everything
from gold to crude oil and copper dropped on concern that the
 Federal Reserve  may phase out stimulus and as  China ’s cash
crunch worsened.  The Standard & Poor’s GSCI Index lost 3 percent to 616.46,
capping the biggest drop since December 2011. All 24 raw
materials tracked by the gauge declined. Gold futures slid below
$1,300 an ounce to the lowest in more than 2 1/2 years, and
silver plunged as much as 9.7 percent, while nickel touched the
lowest price since 2009.  Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said yesterday that the Fed may
start tapering bond purchases that have fueled gains in markets
globally. The central bank could end the program next year
should risks to the economy abate, he said. Benchmark money-market rates in China, the world’s biggest user of energy and
metals, climbed to records, and a private report showed
manufacturing shrank at a faster pace, spurring concern that
raw-material demand is slowing.  “Investor sentiment has turned negative,” Sterling Smith,
a futures specialist at Citigroup Inc. in  Chicago , said in a
telephone interview. “The idea that the quantitative easing,
sooner or later, is going to have to end, that has made
inflation-oriented assets, commodity assets, very, very
nervous.”  Bernanke said the U.S. central bank, which currently buys
$85 billion of Treasury and mortgage debt each month, may begin
reducing purchases this year in measured steps through the first
half of next year and end buying around the middle of 2014.  Shedding Gold  Gold futures for August delivery tumbled 6.4 percent to
$1,286.20 on the Comex in  New York . Prices touched $1,275.40,
the lowest for a most-active contract since September 2010.
Prices through yesterday were down 18 percent this year, heading
for the first annual decline since 2000. Today’s decline in gold
sent options carrying the right to sell bullion at $1,300 in
July up 1,091 percent to $26.20.  Holdings in the SPDR Gold Trust, the world’s largest
exchange-traded product backed by bullion, fell below 1,000 tons
yesterday for the first time in four years, wiping $30 billion
from the value of the fund in 2013. Prices reached a record
$1,923.70 in September 2011 on speculation that economic
stimulus by the world’s central banks, including the Fed, would
spur inflation.  A Chinese Purchasing Managers’ Index released today by HSBC
Holdings Plc and Markit Economics showed a preliminary reading
of 48.3, compared with the 49.1 median estimate in a Bloomberg
News survey of 15 economists. May’s final reading of 49.2 was
the first below 50 since October, indicating contraction.  Illegal Capital  China’s seven-day  repurchase  rate, a gauge of interbank
funding availability, rose to the highest since at least 2006
today as slowing economic growth, a crackdown on illegal capital
inflows and efforts to rein in shadow banking contributed to
increased borrowing costs. China’s central bank has refrained
from using reverse-repurchase agreements to inject funds into
the  interbank market  since Feb. 7.  Copper futures for September delivery declined as much as
3.4 percent to $3.0455 a pound on the Comex, the lowest for a
most-active contract since May 1. On the  London  Metal Exchange,
nickel for delivery in three months slid as much as 3.7 percent
to $13,680 a metric ton.  Arabica-coffee futures tumbled as much as 5.8 percent to
the lowest since July 2009 on ICE Futures U.S. in New York,
while raw-sugar futures dropped the most in eight months. Corn,
wheat and soybeans declined on the Chicago Board of Trade.  Energy Falls  Crude oil for July delivery declined 2.9 percent to $95.40
a barrel on the  New York Mercantile Exchange , after touching
$94.89, the lowest for the contract since June 12. Brent crude
futures in London slid 3.7 percent to $102.15 a barrel.  “It’s not surprising that oil is lower when you look at
the rubbish Chinese PMI data from last night,”  Michael Hewson ,
a London-based market analyst for CMC Markets Plc, said by
telephone today. “Added to that, you have Mr. Bernanke’s
stimulus withdrawal that may affect growth in the U.S., and
these two factors are enough to pull down prices.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
