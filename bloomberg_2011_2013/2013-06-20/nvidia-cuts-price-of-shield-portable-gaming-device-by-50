Nvidia Corp. (NVDA) , the largest maker of
chips for graphics cards in personal computers, cut the price of
its Shield hand-held gaming device to $299 from $349, citing
feedback from consumers.  The company announced the change today in a posting on its
 website . The Android-based machine, which Nvidia announced in
January, will be available June 27.  “We’ve heard from thousands of gamers that if the price
was $299, we’d have a home run,” the  Santa Clara , California-based company said. “We want to get Shield into the hands of as
many gamers as possible.”  Nvidia began taking orders last month for Shield, which is
built on the company’s Tegra processor. It’s aimed at boosting
sales of other devices using Tegra by increasing the use of
games designed for that platform, Chief Executive Officer Jen-Hsun Huang said in an interview last week.  “The reception has been great,” said Huang at the time.
“If we sell some, that’s fantastic as well, but it’s not the
fundamental purpose. The fundamental purpose is to get great
games on Android on Tegra.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
