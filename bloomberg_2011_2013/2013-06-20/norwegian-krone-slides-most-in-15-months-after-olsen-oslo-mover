The Norwegian krone slid the most in
15 months against the euro after Norges Bank Governor Oeystein Olsen said the key policy rate will be at the “current level,
or somewhat lower, in the year ahead.”  Norway’s currency declined the most since November 2011
against the dollar. The central bank kept its benchmark rate at
1.5 percent at its meeting today, as forecast by 21 of the 22
economists surveyed by Bloomberg. The central bank predicted the
key rate would be 1.38 percent in the fourth quarter of this
year, versus an earlier forecast of 1.45 percent.  “The price action has been quite extreme,” said Michael Sneyd, a currency strategist at BNP Paribas SA in  London . “The
language showed a bias towards the prospects of a rate cut. A
lot of the market was expecting the Norges Bank to remove this
scope, so that was a big surprise.”  The krone slumped 1.6 percent to 7.7988 per euro at 11:15
a.m. in London, the biggest one-day drop since March 14, 2012.
It slid to 7.8023, the weakest since December 2011. Norway’s
currency fell 2.4 percent to 5.9145, the largest decline since
Nov. 9, 2011.  The krone has weakened 2 percent this year, according to
the Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes that track 10
developed-market currencies. The euro and the dollar both
strengthened 4.8 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
