(Corrects most to lowest level in first paragraph.)  U.S.  Gulf Coast  gasoline
strengthened versus futures in New York while crack spreads
narrowed to the lowest level in more than 17 months.  The  discount  for conventional, 85-octane Gulf gasoline
shrank by 0.75 cent to 21.25 cents a gallon below futures on the
 New York Mercantile Exchange  at 12:03 p.m.,  rebounding  from the
lowest level since May 24, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  The 3-2-1 crack spread on the Gulf Coast, a rough measure
of refining margins for gasoline and diesel fuel based on West
Texas Intermediate oil in Cushing,  Oklahoma , slid $1.76 to
 $18.88 a barrel  at 1:42 p.m., the smallest differential since
January 2012, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The same
spread based on Light Louisiana Sweet oil fell $1.43 to $10.48.  The differentials narrowed after the Energy Information
Administration said Gulf Coast refiners processed 8.15 million
barrels a day of crude in the week ended June 14. That’s about
91 percent of area capacity and the  highest level  since Dec. 14,
according to EIA data.  “When you get up that high, refiners are really very close
to running at maximum capacity and cracks start to
deteriorate,” Tom Finlon, director of Energy Analytics Group
Ltd., said by phone from Jupiter,  Florida . The return of
refineries in the Midwest, or PADD 2, may also be pressuring
cracks, he said.  Phillips 66 (PSX)  said today that there is no planned maintenance
under way at the Wood River,  Illinois , plant.  Rich Johnson , a
company spokesman, said June 6 that scheduled work was being
carried out on unspecified units.  ‘Way Up’  Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) ’s  Joliet, Illinois, refinery  this month
returned from a plantwide turnaround that began in April, while
 BP Plc (BP/)  was said to be completing maintenance at the Whiting,
Indiana, plant.  “PADD 2 refineries coming back means gasoline production
will go way up,” Finlon said. “That should narrow cracks.”  Refiners in the U.S. Midwest processed  3.21 million  barrels
a day of crude last week, the most since May 3, according to EIA
data.  Gasoline inventories  in the area climbed 507,000 barrels
to 49.8 million during the same time period.  Conventional gasoline, or CBOB, in  Chicago  gained 10.5
cents to  21.5 cents under  futures on the Nymex, one day after
reaching the biggest discount since March 1, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  The  3-2-1 crack spread  in the region widened $2.03  to
$16.94 a barrel, the first increase in five days.  To contact the reporter on this story:
