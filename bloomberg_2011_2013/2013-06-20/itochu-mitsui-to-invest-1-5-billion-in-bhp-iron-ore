Itochu Corp. (8001)  and Mitsui & Co. agreed
to invest $1.5 billion in  BHP Billiton Ltd. (BHP) ’s Jimblebar mining
unit, extending the Japanese traders’ interests in the company’s
Western Australian iron-ore operations.  Itochu will invest about $800 million and Mitsui about $700
million in equity and loans, Melbourne-based BHP said yesterday
in a statement. The deal is subject to approval from the
Australian Foreign Investment Review Board and is expected to be
completed in the third quarter.  A new mine under construction at Jimblebar will have an
initial production capacity of 35 million metric tons a year,
bringing BHP’s West Australian iron-ore operations’ capacity to
220 million tons, according to the statement. Itochu and Mitsui
have a combined 15 percent stake in the operations.  BHP, the world’s biggest mining company, fell 0.6 percent
to A$31.97 as of 12:46 p.m. in Sydney trading. The benchmark
S&P/ASX 200 index fell 0.4 percent.  The Melbourne-based producer, which previously owned 100
percent of the Jimblebar operation, said in 2011 it will spend
$3.3 billion to develop the mine and rail links.  Itochu and Mitsui’s investment includes a contribution to
the development costs, Itochu said in  a statement , without
specifying a figure.  To contact the reporter on this story:
