Copper declined to a seven-week low
as industrial metals dropped after Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben
S. Bernanke  said bond purchases may be reduced and as China’s
manufacturing is slowing. Nickel fell to the lowest since 2009.  Copper for delivery in three months fell as much as 1
percent to $6,888.25 a metric ton on the London Metal Exchange,
the lowest since May 3, and was at $6,902 at 10 a.m. in Shanghai.
Metal for delivery in September on the Comex in  New York  dropped
0.9 percent to $3.1225 per pound.  Bernanke said the central bank may start dialing down its
unprecedented bond-buying program this year and end it entirely
in mid-2014. The  Federal Open Market Committee  left the monthly
pace of bond purchases unchanged at $85 billion for now.  “Now that the Fed has given a rather clear timetable, it
may be difficult for copper to find support at the current
level,” Lian Zheng, an analyst at Xinhu Futures Co., said by
phone from  Shanghai . “One of the drivers for high copper prices
in past few years was the liquidity, or a relatively weak dollar,
but things are changing.”  China’s manufacturing is shrinking at a faster pace this
month, adding to signs that a growth slowdown is deepening in
the world’s second-largest economy.  The preliminary reading of 48.3 for a  Purchasing Managers ’
Index released today by HSBC Holdings Plc and Markit Economics
compares with the 49.1 median estimate in a Bloomberg News
survey of 15 economists. May’s final reading of 49.2 was the
first below 50 since October, indicating contraction.  Copper for delivery in October on the Shanghai Futures
Exchange fell 2 percent to 49,910  yuan  ($8,140) a ton.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
