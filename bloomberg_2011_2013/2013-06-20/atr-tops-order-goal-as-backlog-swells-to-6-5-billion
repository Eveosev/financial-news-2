Avions de Transport Regional, the
world’s largest maker of turboprop airliners, has already
eclipsed its 2013 target for firm orders as purchases from
lessors helped swell its backlog to a record $6.5 billion.  Orders and commitments total 173 this year, with a list
value of $4.1 billion, Chief Executive Officer Filippo Bagnato
told reporters today at the  Paris Air Show . Those agreements
include 83 firm purchases to exceed a goal of 80, he said.  Bookings were bolstered by sales to leasing companies at
the expo, the industry’s largest trade event, that include 91
planes for Nordic Aviation Capital and five today to  Air Lease
Corp. (AL)  Toulouse, France-based ATR is a joint venture between
European Aeronautic, Defence & Space Co. and  Finmeccanica SpA. (FNC)   “It is a strong sign of the lessor interest,” Bagnato
said. Lessors have increased purchases of regional planes
sixfold in the past three years, with ATR securing 75 percent of
the aircraft sold, Bagnato said.  With about 3 1/2 years of production in the backlog, ATR is
boosting output from 80 planes this year to 90 in 2014 and
possibly going beyond that pace in 2015, Bagnato said. Some
production slots remain available, he said.  ATR, whose planes now range in size from 48 to 70 seats,
continues to work on plans for a new 90-seat plane with a
planned market entry for 2018 or 2019, Bagnato said. A business
plan has been delivered to shareholders who are reviewing to
determine whether to go ahead, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
