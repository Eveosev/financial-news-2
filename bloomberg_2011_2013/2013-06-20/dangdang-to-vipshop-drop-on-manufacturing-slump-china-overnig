Chinese stocks sank in New York,
pushing the benchmark index to a 20-month low, after data
signaled the manufacturing slowdown in Asia’s biggest economy is
worsening.  The Bloomberg China-US Equity Index of the most-traded
Chinese stocks in the U.S. tumbled 3.6 percent to 83.14, the
lowest close since October 2011.  E-Commerce China Dangdang Inc. (DANG) ,
the country’s biggest online bookseller, plunged 10 percent as
fashion retailer  Vipshop Holdings Ltd. (VIPS)  tumbled amid intensifying
competition in the e-commerce sector. American depositary
receipts of Cnooc Ltd. traded at the widest discount to the Hong
Kong shares since November 2011.  A preliminary reading of 48.3 for the Chinese Purchasing
Managers’ Index released by HSBC Holdings Plc and Markit
Economics yesterday showed manufacturing slowing faster than
analysts surveyed by Bloomberg had estimated. Equities slumped
globally after Federal Reserve Chairman Ben S. Bernanke said
yesterday the U.S. central bank may end its bond buying program
in the middle of 2014 as the economy strengths. Twelve-month
 yuan  forwards weakened the most in six weeks in New York.  “ China  PMI continues to show contraction and we continue
to see uneven economic data globally,” Timothy Ghriskey, the
chief investment officer at Solaris Group LLC in New York, which
manages more than $1.5 billion in assets, said in a telephone
interview. “A weak stock market in China or the U.S. weighs
directly on consumers as they cut back purchases.”  The  iShares FTSE China 25 Index Fund (FXI) , the largest Chinese
 exchange-traded fund  in the U.S., plunged 4.2 percent to $32.21,
the lowest close since September. The Standard & Poor’s 500
Index tumbled 2.5 percent to 1,588.19, the biggest slump since
November 2011.  Repurchase Rate  The HSBC PMI reading compared with a 49.1 median estimate
of 15 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. China’s seven-day
repurchase  rate , a measure of interbank funding availability,
surged 2.7 percentage points to 11.2 percent yesterday, the
highest level in data going back to 2003.  Beijing-based E-Commerce, known as Dangdang, tumbled to
$6.90, sinking the most since May 2012. Trading volume on
Dangdang was three times the daily average over the past three
months, data compiled by Bloomberg showed.  Vipshop, which sells branded fashion online at discounts,
dropped 8.8 percent to $26.44, the lowest close since March.
 Short interest  on its stock jumped to a record 16 percent of its
outstanding shares, data from Markit showed.  Logistics Center  Vipshop agreed to invest a total 1.6 billion yuan ($260
million) in building a logistics center in China’s central Hubei
province, according to a report June 19 on the technology news
website of Tencent Holdings Ltd.  The company confirmed the report, according to a note
yesterday by Hong Kong-based 86Research Ltd. The project “will
benefit VIPS’s expansion in the long run, but adversely impact
 cash flows  in the short term,” analysts wrote. “As the
competition intensifies in flash sales, we expect to see more
brand marketing impacts its profit.”  Yingli Green Energy Holding Co., the world’s second-biggest
solar cell maker, fell 10 percent to $2.82.  Trina Solar Ltd. (TSL) ,
the fourth-largest, dropped 9.3 percent to $5.44 in a third day
of slump.  Average cell spot price declined the most since Dec. 12 in
the past week, data compiled by Bloomberg showed.  Cnooc Discount  Cnooc, the biggest offshore oil explorer, sank 5 percent to
$164.07, the lowest level since October 2011. Its ADRs, each
representing 100 underlying shares in the Beijing-based company,
traded 2.4 percent below its Hong Kong shares.  ADRs of PetroChina Co., the nation’s biggest oil producer,
declined 3.2 percent to $103.06, the lowest level since May
2010. China Petroleum and Chemical Corp., Asia’s biggest oil
refiner, tumbled 4.9 percent to $87.34, the lowest price since
July 2012.  West Texas Intermediate crude futures for July delivery
dropped 2.9 percent, the most in seven months, to settle at
$95.40 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange.  The Hang Seng China Enterprises Index in Hong Kong dropped
3.3 percent to 9,265.30, the biggest loss in 13 months. The
 Shanghai Composite Index (SHCOMP)  slumped 2.8 percent to a six-month low
of 2,084.02.  To contact the reporter on this story:
