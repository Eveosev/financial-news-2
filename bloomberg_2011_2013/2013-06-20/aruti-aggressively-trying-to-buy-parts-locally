Maruti Suzuki India Ltd. (MSIL) , India’s
biggest automaker by sales volume, will increase local content
in its cars as the rupee’s decline pushes up the cost of
imported components.  “The rupee’s fall is adversely affecting us as we’re a net
importer,” Ajay Seth, chief financial officer at the New Delhi-based company, said in a telephone interview. “We will continue
to aggressively localize sourcing; it’s not going to happen
overnight.”  India’s rupee plunged to a record low after the  Federal
Reserve  signaled it is prepared to start phasing out its
stimulus program that has boosted inflows to emerging markets.
The automaker, whose import costs were equivalent to about 20
percent of its sales, has currency hedges only till the end of
June, according to Seth.  Shares of the Indian unit of  Suzuki Motor Corp. (7269)  fell 2
percent to 1,512.70 rupees as of 11:39 a.m. in Mumbai trading.  To contact the reporters on this story:
