CME Group Inc. increased the margin
requirements on gold trading after prices fell to the lowest
since September 2010.  The minimum  cash deposit  for gold futures will rise 25
percent to $8,800 per 100-ounce contract at the close of trading
tomorrow, Chicago-based CME said in a statement. For platinum,
the initial margin was raised to $3,465 from $3,080.  The CME’s Comex unit is making it more expensive for
speculators to trade after gold fell as much as 7.2 percent
today and prices entered a  bear market  in April. Bullion has
declined 23 percent this year as some investors lose faith in it
as a store of value. Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke 
said yesterday that the central bank, which buys $85 billion of
Treasury and mortgage debt each month, may begin reducing
purchases this year and end the program in 2014 should the
economy continue to improve.  “The CME is trying to keep a lid on volatility,”  Michael Smith , the president of T&K Futures & Options Inc. in  Port St.
Lucie , Florida, said in a telephone interview. “They’re always
going to do that with the kind of selloff we’re seeing. Once the
volatility starts to go sideways, you’ll see margins come back
down.”  Gold futures for August delivery plunged 6.4 percent to
settle at $1,286.20 on the Comex in  New York . In electronic
trading after the market settled, prices touched $1,275.40, the
lowest since Sept. 21, 2010.  The metal’s 60-day implied volatility, a gauge for future
price swings, touched 31.866, the highest since November 2011.  Investors sold 520.7 metric tons from gold-backed exchange-traded  products  this year. The price slump hurt billionaire
hedge fund manager  John Paulson  and producer Newcrest Mining
Ltd. Bullion rose for 12 straight years through 2012 as global
central banks expanded record stimulus programs, boosting the
appeal of precious metals as alternative assets.  Platinum futures for July delivery declined 4.2 percent to
$1,363.80 an ounce, the lowest close since Nov. 12, 2009.  To contact the reporter on this story:
