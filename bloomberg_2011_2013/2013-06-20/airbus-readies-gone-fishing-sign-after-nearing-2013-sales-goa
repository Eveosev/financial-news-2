Airbus SAS came within reach of its
annual order target after adding almost $15 billion in sales on
the fourth day of the  Paris Air Show , prompting its sales chief
to quip that he might take the rest of the year off.  The European manufacturer pulled in deals worth almost $70
billion at the annual trade fair, including firm orders for 241
planes and agreements for 225 more, it said today. Airbus’s
target for the whole of 2013 is 800 orders, a goal the company
said it’s confident of exceeding, having booked 758.  “I’m going fishing,”  John Leahy , head of sales and chief
operating officer, said at a press conference with Chief
Executive Officer Fabrice Bregier. “People at Boeing are
actually suggesting it.”  Airbus won 69 orders and commitments for its new A350 wide-body, which flew for the first time last week and will make a
fly-by appearance at the event tomorrow. Boeing Co. introduced a
stretched version of its 787 Dreamliner to take on the A350,
signing up buyers including  Singapore Airlines Ltd. (SIA)  and leasing
company  Air Lease Corp. (AL)   By volume, the A320 single-aisle family pulled in the most
business in Paris, with 371 orders and commitments. Bregier said
suppliers are still struggling to meet rising output.  The company has sold most of the remaining classic A320s it
plans to make as it prepares to put a more fuel-efficient
version, the Neo, into service in 2015.  Japan Target  Airbus has an order backlog of more than 2,400 A320neos,
which dominated the air show two years ago and prompted Boeing
to also equip its 737 model with new engines. Airbus claims a
lead of 61 percent in the re-engined single-aisle market.  Leahy said he’s still “hammering away” at winning
business in  Japan , a market dominated by Boeing. Toulouse,
France-based Airbus is confident it will eventually also sell
its A380 superjumbos to the largest Japanese carriers, he said.  Bregier said the second flight of the A350 prototype went
smoothly yesterday, as the crew took the airliner close to its
maximum altitude and speed limits. Even with thousands of test-flight hours remaining in the next year, the CEO said he’s
confident the plane will deliver on its efficiency promises.  Airbus is focused on marketing the larger A350-900 and
-1000 versions, and is “looking at” the first-flight plan of
the smallest -800 variant, Leahy said. There are no intentions
to drop the model outright, he said and Airbus will honor
contracts for airlines that want the plane.  Some customers, including Qatar Airways Ltd., have already
dropped the smallest A350 variant in favor of larger types,
leaving Airbus with just 89 sales on the model, compared with
more than 600 for the program overall.  Leahy said the planemaker is encouraging remaining buyers
to upgrade by offering “attractive” terms. Among airlines with
A350-800 on order are USAirways Group Inc., Aeroflot Russian
Airlines,  Asiana Airlines Inc. (020560)  and Hawaiian Airlines Inc.  The June 14 maiden flight of the A350 “gives us a lot of
credibility” and should help spur sales, Leahy said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
