  Cia. Paranaense de Energia , a
Brazilian utility known as Copel, agreed to buy wind-energy
company Salus Fundos de Investimento em Participacoes for 286.1
million reais ($128 million).  Salus Fundos owns seven projects with a total of 183.6
megawatts of capacity that won contracts to sell power in two
government-organized auctions in 2010 and 2011, Curitiba,
Brazil-based Copel said yesterday on its  website . The purchase
marks “the company’s effective entry into the wind generation
segment.”  The board also approved the acquisition of 30 percent of
