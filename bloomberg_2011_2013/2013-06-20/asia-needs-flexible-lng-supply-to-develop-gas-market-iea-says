Asia  needs flexible liquefied
natural gas supply as well as increased shipping availability
and terminal access to develop a competitive natural gas market,
according to the  International Energy Agency .  Such a market is needed if the region wants to develop a
reliable natural gas price to move away from the long-term, oil-linked LNG contracts predominant in Asia, the Paris-based
adviser to 28 oil-consuming nations said in its medium-term gas
market report released today.  “Governments in the Asia-Pacific region will need to
signal their willingness to facilitate competition further
downstream,” the IEA said. “The North American and European
experience shows that competitive natural gas markets will not
develop overnight, and will not necessarily lead to a lower
price.”  Asia’s buyers may reap the benefits of increased portfolio
flexibility from the development of a liquid, well-traded gas
market in the region, the IEA said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
