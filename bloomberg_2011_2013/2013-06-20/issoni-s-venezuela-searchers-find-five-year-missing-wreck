Venezuela ’s search for vanished
fashion scion Vittorio Missoni resulted in the discovery of an
aircraft that disappeared five years earlier.  The Czech-made Let-410 operated by carrier Transaven was
found 900 meters below  sea level  off Los Roques archipelago, the
public prosecutor’s office said in a statement late yesterday.
Los Roques lie about 170 kilometers north of the Venezuelan
mainland.  The Let crashed on Jan. 4, 2008 with all 14 people on board
presumed dead. Italian citizen Missoni and five other passengers
and crew took off from Los Roques on the same day this January
in a twin-engine Diamond DA42. The plane remains missing. The
joint Venezuela-Italian search mission made yesterday’s
discovery with the U.S-registered Sea Scout survey ship.  Missoni, 58, was in charge of the eponymous Italian fashion
house known for its zig-zag knitwear worn by celebrities
including Madonna and  Jennifer Lopez .  Founded in the 1950s by Vittorio’s parents Ottavio and
Rosita, Missoni SpA is run by Vittorio’s siblings Luca and
Angela and non-family member chief executive officer Alberto Piantoni.  To contact the reporter on this story:
