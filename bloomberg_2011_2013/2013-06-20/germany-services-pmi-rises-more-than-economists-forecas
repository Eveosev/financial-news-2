Germany ’s services industry expanded
at the fastest pace in four months in June, while the nation’s
manufacturing industry continued to contract.  An index of the services industry based on a survey of
purchasing managers rose to 51.3 this month from 49.7 in May,
London-based Markit Economics said today. That is the highest
reading since February and exceeded the median estimate of 50.0
in a Bloomberg News survey of 29 economists. A reading above 50
indicates expansion.  A gauge of German manufacturing fell to 48.7 in June from
49.4 in the prior month, Markit said in the same report.
Economists had projected a reading of 49.9 for that index.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
