LPL Financial Holdings Inc. (LPLA) , the
brokerage fined last month for systemic failures and
misstatements, has hired the former head of the U.S. Securities
and Exchange Commission’s Boston office as its general counsel.  David Bergers, who starts work on Aug. 5, will also serve
as managing director for legal and government relations at LPL,
which specializes in the technology and service businesses, the
firm said in a statement today. He will also be a member of the
management and risk oversight committees.  In recent years, LPL Financial has been faulted by the
brokerage industry’s self-regulator as well as by securities
regulators from at least seven states, according to public
filings with the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority.  The hiring of Bergers, 45, comes about one month after
Boston-based LPL agreed to pay $9 million to resolve Finra
claims that it failed to supervise employees’ e-mails and made
misstatements to investigators. LPL said it regretted the lapses
and that the firm had taken steps to redesign its compliance
program.  “We are fortunate to have someone of David’s caliber and
expertise in regulatory and other matters joining  LPL Financial 
to head our legal and government relations functions,” Mark Casady, the firm’s chairman and chief executive officer, said in
the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
