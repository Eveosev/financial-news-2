Repsol SA (REP) , Spain’s biggest oil
company, may begin exploring for natural gas off the country’s
southern coast in the  Mediterranean Sea  as early as February,
after winning a two-year  extension  of its prospecting permit.  The company, which won the renewal in a law published last
month, has spent about 19 million euros ($25 million) on seismic
studies and authorizations and now expects drilling to cost 41
million euros, spokesman Kristian Rix said in an interview. Rix
said he couldn’t estimate exactly when work will begin.  Repsol is one of more than a dozen national and foreign
companies seeking approvals to prospect in Spain, which imports
about 99 percent of the oil and gas that’s consumed in  Europe ’s
fourth-largest economy. The  Siroco gas project  lies about 10
kilometers (6 miles) off Mijas, between Malaga and Marbella.  After winning its first exploration permits for Siroco in
2004, the Madrid-based company won environmental approval in
2011. That called for drilling only between February and April,
to avoid conflicts with mating and migration of sea animals and
the high season for tourism in July and August in Malaga, one of
Spain’s most visited provinces by foreign tourists.  To contact the reporter on this story:
