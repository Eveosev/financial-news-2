Rubber declined as data showed
China’s manufacturing shrank at a faster pace this month,
raising concern that demand from the largest consumer may
weaken.  The contract for delivery in November on the  Tokyo 
Commodity Exchange fell as much as 0.8 percent to 235.3 yen a
kilogram ($2,434 a metric ton) and was at 235.8 yen at 11:40
a.m. Futures extended losses for this year to 22 percent.  The preliminary reading of 48.3 for a  Purchasing Managers ’
Index released today by HSBC Holdings Plc and Markit Economics
compares with the 49.1 median estimate in a Bloomberg News
survey of 15 economists. May’s final reading of 49.2 was the
first below 50 since October, indicating a slowdown is deepening
in the world’s second-largest economy.  “Concerns about Chinese demand increased, leading to sales
of rubber futures,” Takaki Shigemoto, an analyst at research
company JSC Corp. in Tokyo, said by phone.  Today’s data adds to evidence that China’s growth is
slowing for a second quarter after exports, industrial output
and bank lending trailed estimates for May. China consumed 3.85
million tons of natural rubber last year, representing 34
percent of global consumption, according to the International
Rubber Study Group.  The contract for September delivery on the Shanghai Futures
Exchange lost 2.4 percent to 17,865  yuan  ($2,915) a ton. Thai
rubber free-on-board gained 1.2 percent to 86.50 baht ($2.80) a
kilogram yesterday, according to the Rubber Research Institute
of  Thailand .  To contact the reporter on this story:
