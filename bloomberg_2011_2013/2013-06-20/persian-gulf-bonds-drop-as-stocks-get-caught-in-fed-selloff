Persian Gulf bonds and  stocks  fell,
with Qatari debt headed for a record drop, after the  Federal
Reserve  said it may reduce monetary stimulus this year, sparking
a global sell-off in emerging-market assets.  Qatar’s 2020 bond yield soared 31 basis points, or 0.31 of
a percentage point, to 3.1 percent, while Bahrain’s 2022 notes
yielded 5.88 percent, up 37 basis points. Oman’s benchmark  MSM
30 Index (MSM30)  fell the most in almost three months, leading declines
in the six-nation GCC, where Qatar’s QE Index also retreated 1.1
percent. The BGCC200 Index of regional stocks lost 0.3 percent
at 1:21 p.m. in Dubai.  Equity indexes in the oil-exporting GCC, which are among
three of the top-five best performers in the world this year,
succumbed to some of the selling pressure that drove the MSCI
 Emerging Markets  Index down the most since November 2011 today.
Fed Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said yesterday the central bank may
start reducing bond purchases and end the program in 2014 should
risks to the  U.S. economy  abate.  “Given the rally in the past year or so, spreads were
tight and it is understandable that they are widening today,”
Jean-Michel Saliba, London-based economist at Bank of America
Merrill Lynch, said by e-mail, referring to Qatari bonds. “Most
immune GCC bonds in the short-term would probably be short-dated
Islamic bonds such as Dubai’s because of strong support from
local investors and the higher yield cushion.”  Fund Reallocation  The yield on Dubai’s 6.45 percent sukuk maturing in 2022
gained two basis points to 5.01 percent.  Oman’s MSM 30 Index dropped the most since March 27 as the
nation’s biggest bank, Bank Muscat SAOG, retreated 3.1 percent.
Qatar National Bank SAQ, the largest lender in the  Middle East ,
fell 0.7 percent, the biggest decliner by index points on the
BGCC200 Index.  The “Fed’s plans to reduce the bond-buying program means
lower equity fund flows to emerging markets,” said Santhosh Balakrishnan, Muscat-based equity analyst at United Securities
LLC. Stocks are being affected “as foreign investors reallocate
funds to safe havens,” he said.  Elsewhere in the Middle East, Dubai’s DFM General Index
decreased 0.8 percent and  Abu Dhabi ’s ADX General Index fell 0.2
percent.  Egypt ’s gauge fell for a second day.  Israel’s TA-25 Index lost 0.9 percent, set for the lowest
close since May 13, while the yield on the nation’s benchmark
4.25 percent bonds maturing in 2023 advanced 12 basis points to
3.91 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
