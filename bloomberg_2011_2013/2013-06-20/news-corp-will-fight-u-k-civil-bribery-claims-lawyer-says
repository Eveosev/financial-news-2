News Corp. (NWSA) ’s U.K. unit won’t offer
compensation to anyone suing it over bribery of public officials
by journalists at the company’s tabloid newspapers.  News International will “resist” any claims stemming from
the bribery investigations by U.K. police, Dinah Rose, the
company’s lawyer, said at a London court hearing today. Lawyers
for the victims of phone hacking said there were as many as 10
possible lawsuits waiting to be filed.  News Corp. newspapers have been at the heart of wide-ranging investigations over the past three years that have
uncovered alleged bribery and phone hacking at two tabloids.
News Corp. Chairman  Rupert Murdoch  closed the News of the World
after revelations journalists had illegally accessed messages on
the mobile phone of a murdered school girl.  “There are a number of law firms who have done very well
out of this litigation,” Rose said in court. “There is a
certain amount of ambulance chasing going on.”  Rebekah Brooks, the former chief executive officer of News
International pleaded not guilty at a London hearing June 6 to
charges she conspired to commit misconduct in a public office.
The criminal and civil proceedings are running in parallel.  News Corp. has resolved around 95 percent of the claims
made against it by victims of voice-mail interception through
court-approved settlements and an out of court process created
by the company, Rose said. There are 26 cases remaining,  Hugh Tomlinson , the victims’ lawyer, said today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
