Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM)   is shutting the
crude distillation unit at the Torrance, California, refinery
for a week or two of repairs related to a metallurgical issue, a
person familiar with the operations said.  The rest of the units at the 150,000-barrel-a-day plant
near  Los Angeles  will operate at about half of normal rates
while the crude unit is out of commission, said the person, who
asked not to be identified because the information isn’t public.  Gesuina Paras, an Exxon spokeswoman at the refinery, didn’t
immediately respond to an e-mail requesting comment.  The crude unit returned to full rates earlier this month
after parts were shut for a planned turnaround that also
included work on a coker and alkylation unit, two people
familiar with the schedule said at the time.  The Torrance refinery, which processes mostly heavy crude
from California’s San Joaquin Valley, makes almost 10 percent of
the state’s gasoline and provides jet fuel to Los Angeles
International Airport by pipeline, Exxon’s website shows.  To contact the reporter on this story:
