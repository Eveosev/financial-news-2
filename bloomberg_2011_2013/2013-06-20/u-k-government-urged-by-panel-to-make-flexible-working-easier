U.K. employees should have the right
to request flexible working patterns from their first day
instead of waiting six months, a panel of lawmakers said.  In a report on women in the workplace, Parliament’s
Business Committee said letting staff ask to work part-time
or do job shares made it easier for mothers to return after
having children. At present, employers have to consider requests
from workers after they’ve been in the job six months.  “Flexible working is not a women’s issue; it affects all
employees with caring responsibilities,” committee chairman,
Adrian Bailey, said in an e-mailed statement. “We must dispel
the myth that it is problematic and cannot work.”  The committee also called on the government to introduce
equal pay audits for large employers to highlight companies
where women earned less. Business Secretary Vince Cable has yet
to do so. His current focus is on removing regulations around
employers.  To contact the reporter on this story:
