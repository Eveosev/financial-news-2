U.S. natural gas production will
accelerate from 2014 through 2018 as higher prices spur drilling
and expanded infrastructure allows more shale supplies to reach
the market, according to the  International Energy Agency .  Gas output will reach 797 billion cubic meters by 2018, 17
percent higher than last year’s total of 681 billion, the IEA
said in its Medium-Term Market Report, released today.  “After stabilizing in 2013, gas output will rise strongly
over the rest of the forecast period,” the Paris-based agency
said. “As in the five previous years, shale gas continues to be
the key driver behind this growth.”  U.S. shale production increased sixfold to 265 billion
cubic meters last year from 45 billion in 2007, the IEA said.
More than 75 percent of the current shale output is coming from
the Marcellus, Barnett, Fayetteville and Haynesville deposits,
the agency said.  Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM)  and  Chesapeake Energy Corp. (CHK) , the two
largest gas producers in the U.S., have both been “radically
shifting” their onshore drilling focus from gas deposits toward
oil and other liquids, the IEA said. Output of the resulting
associated gas has exceeded production from dry gas plays over
the last two years, according to the report.  Associated gas will account for 54 percent of U.S. gas
production in 2014, up from 51 percent last year and 49 percent
in 2011, the agency said.  Gas prices  above $4 per million British thermal units in
the U.S. “should foster additional gas production growth”
until 2018, the IEA said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
