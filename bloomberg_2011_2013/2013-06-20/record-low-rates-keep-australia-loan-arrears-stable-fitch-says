Australian mortgage arrears, already
low relative to other nations, will remain stable in 2013,
helped by record-low interest rates and steady employment, Fitch
Ratings said.  The proportion of prime home loans between 30 and 59 days
late was at 0.59 percent, the lowest post-Christmas level since
March 2006, the ratings company said in a statement today.
Mortgages more than 30 days late rose to 1.48 percent in the
first three months of 2013 from 1.46 percent in the fourth
quarter of 2012, it said.  Australia ’s “macroeconomic environment will continue to
remain stable in 2013 due to low levels of unemployment and
strong gross domestic product,” analysts led by Hai Duong Le in
Sydney wrote in the report. “Low interest rates will continue
to assist borrowers’ serviceability and ease the debt burden.”  The Reserve Bank of Australia lowered  borrowing costs  by 2
percentage points since November 2011 to 2.75 percent, and the
 unemployment rate  fell to 5.5 percent in May from 5.6 percent in
April. Almost half of all borrowers surveyed by  QBE Insurance
Group Ltd. (QBE) ’s lenders’ mortgage insurance unit were able to get
ahead on repayments last year, thanks to the central bank’s rate
cuts, the company said this week.  Self-employed borrowers are lagging others, with
delinquencies rising to 7.57 percent in the quarter ending March
31 from 7.05 percent in the prior three months.  Those with low documentation “have taken longer to adjust
their spending and cure arrears due to the lumpy nature of the
cash flows,” Fitch said. “Fitch believes this will continue.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
