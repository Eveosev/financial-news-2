Deputy Prime Minister  Nick Clegg 
defended the force-feeding of one of the most infamous
murderers in British history to keep him alive in a psychiatric
hospital, saying he could see why it is being carried out.  Ian Brady with his then girlfriend Myra Hindley murdered
five children in the 1960s, burying some of them on moors in the
area around Manchester, northern  England . He wants to be
released from hospital, where he is being force-fed to keep him
alive, in order to be able to die in prison in his native
 Scotland . On June 17, Brady appeared at a mental health tribunal
to seek the move.  Asked in an LBC Radio interview today if it is right to
keep Brady alive by force-feeding, Clegg said “I can see why
that is being done. I have no sympathy for him on any
Level.” Brady has not said where some of the victims are buried
despite the pleas of their families.  “I personally feel no equivalence at all, morally or
otherwise, between what is being provided to Ian Brady and the
barbaric torture he inflicted on others,” Clegg said.  Hindley died in jail in 2002.  To contact the reporter on this story:
