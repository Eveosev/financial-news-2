The cost of insuring European
corporate bonds against losses surged to the highest in more
than two months after the  Federal Reserve  confirmed it will
begin withdrawing stimulus if the economy continues to improve.  The Markit iTraxx Europe Index of credit-default swaps on
125 companies with investment-grade ratings rose 8.6 basis
points to 116 at 8:13 a.m. in  London , the highest level since
April 5, Bloomberg data show. The Markit iTraxx Crossover Index
of contracts on 50 high-yield companies increased 34 basis
points to 477, the biggest jump since March 20.  Fed Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said the central bank could
start winding down its $85 billion in monthly bond purchases
later this year and will end them completely by mid-2014 as long
as the worldâ€™s largest economy performs in line with its
projections. Credit risk began rising in May as Bernanke
signaled a potential tapering of the stimulus that drove credit-default swaps on European corporate debt to the lowest in more
than three years.  The Markit iTraxx Financial Index linked to senior debt of
25 banks and insurers rose 11 basis points to 165, while the
subordinated index climbed 15 basis points to a one-week high of
242. An increase signals deterioration in perceptions of  credit
quality .  A basis point on a credit-default swap protecting 10
million euros of debt from default for five years is equivalent
to 1,000 euros ($1,326) a year. Swaps pay the buyer face value
in exchange for the underlying securities or the cash equivalent
should a borrower fail to adhere to its debt agreements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
