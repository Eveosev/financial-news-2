The Los Angeles Clippers resumed
negotiations today to get  Kevin Garnett  and coach  Doc Rivers 
from the Boston Celtics, ESPN said, citing people familiar with
the talks.  The deal, which could be set as early as tonight, would
have the Celtics getting DeAndre Jordan and two first-round
draft picks, the network said.  Rivers met today with Danny Ainge, the president of
basketball operations for the Celtics, to discuss his future
with the club, ESPN said.  Although the Clippers are still interviewing candidates to
be their next coach, they have said they would pay Rivers $7
million a year for the next five years, ESPN said, citing a
person with the National Basketball Association.  To contact the reporter on this story:
