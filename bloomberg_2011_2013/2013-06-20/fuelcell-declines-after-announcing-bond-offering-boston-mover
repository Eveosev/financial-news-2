FuelCell Energy Inc., (FCEL)  the Danbury,
Connecticut-based manufacturer of fuel-cell power plants, fell
the most in a year after announcing plans to offer $38 million
in debt.  FuelCell slumped 13 percent to $1.18 at the close in New
York, the most since June 6, 2012.  The 8 percent senior notes will mature June 2018 unless
theyâ€™re earlier converted into FuelCell common shares each worth
$1.55, according to a statement today. Lazard Ltd. is managing
the offer, which is expected to close June 25.  FuelCell, which makes systems that convert natural gas into
electricity through a chemical process, said it will use the
funds for general corporate purposes.  To contact the reporter on this story:
