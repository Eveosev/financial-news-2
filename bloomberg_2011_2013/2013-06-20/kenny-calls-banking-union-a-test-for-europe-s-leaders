Irish Prime Minister Enda Kenny said
progress on a European banking union marked a “credibility
test” for the the bloc’s leaders as finance ministers gathered
to move the project forward.  Asked whether German Chancellor Angela Merkel was standing
by her government’s reservations on measures such as a unified
supervisory and bank-resolution mechanisms due to campaign
pressure in an election year, Kenny said European leaders must
follow through on the decision they made a year ago.  “The decision was made by everybody and it was agreed by
everybody, and the point now is to implement it and make it
work,” Kenny told reporters at a meeting of the European
People’s Party in Vienna. “Everybody understands that this is a
fundamentally important part of the financing” of the EU.  Germany  has resisted elements of a banking union that was
agreed upon at a June 2012 summit, including a centralized
mechanism to wind down failed banks. German Finance Minister
Wolfgang Schaeuble said yesterday that he’ll “fight with all my
strength” so that the resolution authority won’t be considered
by EU leaders.  To contact the reporters on this story:
