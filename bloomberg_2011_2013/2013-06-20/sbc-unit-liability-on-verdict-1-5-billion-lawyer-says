The  HSBC Holdings Plc (HSBA)  unit once
known as Household International Inc. is liable for about
$1.5 billion in damages to shareholders who a  Chicago  federal
court jury found in 2009 were misled by the company and three
executives, a plaintiffs’ attorney said.  The lawyer, Michael J. Dowd, told U.S. District Judge
Ronald A. Guzman at a hearing today in Chicago that an
independent claims examiner reviewed and approved investor
claims approaching that amount, for which the attorney seeks
entry of a partial judgment.  That $1.48 billion in allowed claims from about 10,000
stockholders may be augmented by pre-judgment interest in the
11-year-old lawsuit or wiped out by post-trial motions, Dowd
said in an interview outside the courtroom. Still more claims
remain to be resolved, he said.  Noting the litigation has gone on “for years and years,”
Guzman said from the bench, “it’s got to come to an end.”  Household stockholders sued the company in 2002, alleging
the company and three executives made misleading statements
about its mortgage lending practices. The lender had earlier
agreed to pay $484 million in fines to settle claims lodged by
more than a dozen states.  Jurors in May 2009 decided the company, former Chief
Executive Officer William Aldinger and two other people made
recklessly misleading comments 16 times and in one instance
involving Aldinger, did so knowingly.  Shareholder Losses  While the jury determined that stockholder losses from
March 23, 2001, to Oct. 11, 2002, could be as much as $23.94 a
share, it made no lump-sum award. The ensuing claims evaluation
process has lasted four years.  Guzman today told defense lawyer R. Ryan Stoll he can
update post-trial briefs filed in 2009 with developments in the
law since then while barring him from raising new legal issues.
Final briefing from all sides is due in September, Guzman said.  Household was acquired by London-based HSBC in March 2003
for $15.5 billion.  The case is Lawrence E. Jaffe Pension Plan v. Household
International Inc., 1:02-cv-05893, U.S. District Court, Northern
District of  Illinois  (Chicago).  To contact the reporter on this story:
