Vietnam ’s defense chief visited the
Pentagon yesterday, a milestone 40 years after the end of U.S.
military action in the once-divided nation.  Senior Lieutenant General Do Ba Ty, chief of the general
staff of the People’s Army of Vietnam, was escorted by Army
General Martin Dempsey, chairman of the U.S. Joint Chiefs, into
the Joint Chief’s meeting room, known as the Tank.  “This was the first-ever visit by a Vietnamese chief of
defense to the Pentagon,” Navy Commander Scott McIlnay, a
Dempsey spokesman, said in an e-mailed statement.  Among regional issues discussed by Dempsey and Ty was the
Obama administration’s “rebalance to the Asia-Pacific region,”
McIlnay said. The Pentagon announced plans last year to shift
more attention and military assets to the region.  Ty’s visit also reflects improving relations between the
former combatants in a war that ended when communist forces
seized Saigon in 1975. The U.S. and Vietnam resumed diplomatic
relations in 1995.  Ty visited a day after the 40th anniversary of
congressional approval of the Case-Church amendment that
prohibited further U.S. military action in Vietnam effective
August 15, 1973. The provision was named for Republican Senator
Clifford Case of  New Jersey  and Democratic Senator Frank Church
of  Idaho .  For Related News and Information:
