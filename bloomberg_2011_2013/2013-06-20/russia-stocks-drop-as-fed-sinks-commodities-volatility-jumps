Russia ’s  Micex Index (INDEXCF)  sank for a
second day as commodities slumped after the U.S. Federal Reserve
said it may curb stimulus this year, paring appetite for stocks
in the world’s biggest energy exporter.  The country’s benchmark equities gauge lost 1.6 percent to
1,302.05 by 12:20 p.m. in Moscow. The Russian Volatility  Index (RTSI$) 
climbed 14 percent to 32.73, the biggest jump since May 23. OAO
Sberbank, Russia’s largest lender, dropped 3.1 percent to 91.60
rubles, poised for a Nov. 30 low. VTB Group declined 2.9 percent
to 4.75 kopeks. Russia’s stocks have the cheapest valuations
among 21 emerging markets tracked by Bloomberg.  Standard & Poor’s  GSCI Commodities (SPGSCI)  Index slumped 1.7
percent, the most since May 10, after Fed Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said the regulator will probably taper its $85 billion
in monthly bond buying later in 2013 and halt purchases around
mid-2014 as long as the world’s largest economy performs in line
with projections. More than $2 trillion has been lost from
global markets since May 22, when Bernanke signaled the asset-buying program may be trimmed.  “We might see new lows” before stock prices start
recovering, Victor Bark, who oversees about $2.8 billion as the
head of asset management at Alfa Capital in Moscow, said by
phone. “The market is overreacting to the Fed comments, at some
point in the next few days we’ll see a rebound.”  The conclusion to record U.S. stimulus may take years to
complete as the Fed’s forecasts showed most officials don’t
expect to begin raising the benchmark lending rate out of its
lowest-ever range of zero to 0.25 percent until 2015.  Oil Falls  Commodities also dropped after a report showed  China ’s
manufacturing shrank at a faster pace this month. Crude oil,
Russia’s chief export earner, dropped 2 percent to $96.31, a
second day of declines. Brent for August settlement tumbled 1.7
percent to $104.30 a barrel in  London . Urals crude lost 0.5
percent to $104.48.  OAO  Mechel (MTLR) , a steelmaker and Russia’s biggest coking coal
producer, retreated 2.8 percent to 94.50 rubles. Most metals
fell in London.  The dollar-denominated RTS Index, which entered a  bear
market  on June 5, dropped 3 percent to 1,252.93. Financial
stocks were the biggest decliners among nine industry groups on
the Micex, trading down 1.1 percent on average.  The 14-day  relative strength index  on the Micex fell to 40
after sliding to 31.4 last week, the closest since April to a
level of 30, which signals a rebound to some analysts. On the
Micex, 4 stocks increased and 46 dropped. The volume of shares
traded on the gauge was 3.5 percent below the 30-day average,
while 10-day price swings surged to 27.017, the highest since
May 31.  Cheapest Valuations  Out of 50 stocks on the Micex, one closed yesterday at a
 52-week low  and none at highs, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. Twenty-two stocks, or 44 percent, were trading above
their  50-day moving average .  The Micex trades at 4.9 times its 12-month estimated
earnings, having lost 12 percent this year, compared with a
multiple of 9.4 for the MSCI  Emerging Markets  Index, which is
down 13 percent.  The Bloomberg Russia-US Equity Index of the most-traded
Russian companies in the U.S. dropped 2.2 percent to 85.06
yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
