French  gross domestic product  will
probably drop this year after stalling in 2012 as households
trim spending and companies slash investment, national
statistics office Insee predicted.  Europe ’s second-largest economy is set to shrink 0.1
percent in 2013, Insee said. After dropping 0.2 percent in the
first quarter, GDP will rise 0.2 percent in the second and hold
steady in the third before increasing 0.1 percent in the fourth,
the Paris-based statistics office estimated.  The forecast is the latest to suggest that President
 Francois Hollande ’s expectation of 0.1 percent growth this year
may be optimistic as consumers and companies digest roughly 50
billion euros ($66 billion) of  tax increases  voted by his
government and his predecessor’s over the past two years.  “The business climate in  France  remains poor,” Insee
said. “Investment by non-financial enterprises should continue
to fall over the forecasting period. The context is likely to
remain unconducive to any expansion of production capacities.”  Lack of growth may make it harder for Hollande to keep
promises to boost employment and cut the  budget deficit .  Non-farm payrolls are likely to shrink by 114,000 in all of
2013, while the unemployment rate climbs above 11 percent, Insee
said.  That will further weigh on  consumer spending , which will
probably drop 0.1 percent in the full year. A drop in investment
by non-financial corporations will likely accelerate to a 2.6
percent drop in 2013 from a 1.2 percent decline in 2012, Insee
said.  Foreign trade will probably contribute a 0.1 percent boost
to GDP, the forecasts show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
