Jesse Hermann, a managing director
at Thomas H. Lee Partners LP, has left the Boston-based company
for another buyout firm.  Hermann, who joined private-equity firm THL in 2011 after
more than 20 years in various management roles at manufacturing
companies and consulting firms, focused on analyzing and
improving operations at portfolio companies, he said by
telephone. He is set to join Court Square Capital Partners LP,
which is based in New York, next week as an operating partner.  THL in April agreed to buy CompuCom Systems Inc., an
information-technology services provider, from Court Square for
an undisclosed amount.  “It was for personal reasons that I decided to leave,”
Hermann said. “They’re good guys” at THL.  Hermann was previously a senior director at advisory and
restructuring firm Zolfo Cooper, chief executive officer at
software company Icarz Inc. and CEO of switches and locks maker
 General Automotive Co. (GNAUQ) , according to a biography that was on
THL’s website before being removed. He graduated from Amherst
College in  Massachusetts  and Stanford Graduate School of
Business.  Matt Benson, a spokesman for THL at public-relations firm
Sard Verbinnen & Co., didn’t return a message seeking comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
