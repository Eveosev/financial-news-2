Empresas ICA SAB (ICA*) , Mexico’s largest
construction company, will sell its minority stake in a Mexican
tollway operator to partner  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)  and use the
proceeds to pay short-term debt.  The Mexico City-based builder said it expected to receive
5.07 billion pesos ($380 million) from the sale of its 18.7
percent stake in Red de Carreteras de Occidente, which is
majority-owned by Goldman Sachs. The deal needs approval by
Mexico’s antitrust regulator and the Ministry of Communications
and Transportation, ICA said in an e-mailed statement today.  ICA shares have tumbled more than 30 percent since May 16,
the day before Moody’s Investors Service downgraded the
company’s credit rating citing its high leverage and delays in
public-works spending by President Enrique Pena Nieto. The
company’s sales dropped 27 percent in the first quarter while
debt climbed 14 percent to 54.2 billion pesos from its Dec. 31
level.  “We are significantly strengthening our financial
position,” ICA Chief Executive Officer Alonso Quintana said in
the statement. “The sale of ICA’s investment in RCO is a clear
example of our strategy of selective recycling of capital in our
asset portfolio and creating value for ICA’s shareholders.”  ICA fell 2.8 percent to 21.28 pesos at 9:18 a.m. in  Mexico 
City as Mexico’s benchmark IPC index dropped 2.5 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
