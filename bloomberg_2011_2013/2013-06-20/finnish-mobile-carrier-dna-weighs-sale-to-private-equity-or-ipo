DNA Oy, a Finnish wireless carrier,
is weighing a sale to a private-equity firm and an initial
public offering as options to broaden its ownership.  DNA, owned by a group of Finnish regional phone carriers
led by Finda Oy, said its plans will become clearer within the
next few months, according to a statement today. Keeping the
current ownership structure is an option, the Helsinki-based
company said.  A sale would provide the shareholders with cash, while
potentially strengthening DNA against larger rivals  Elisa Oyj (ELI1V) 
and  TeliaSonera AB. (TLSN)  The IPO could be the biggest in Finland,
home of  Nokia Oyj (NOK1V)  and “Angry Birds” maker Rovio Entertainment
Oy, since 2005.  DNA’s market value is probably about 1.1 billion euros
($1.5 billion),  Mikko Ervasti , an analyst at Evli Bank Oyj in
Helsinki, said in March. Though the company’s profitability has
trailed rivals, it will probably boost margins this year and
next as it adds subscribers and curbs costs, according to the
analyst.  DNA’s sales increased 5.7 percent to 769 million euros last
year and earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and
amortization rose 1.2 percent to 191 million euros, according to
its website. DNA’s wireless service covers more than 5 million
Finns and the company also owns a cable-television network in
the Helsinki area.  To contact the reporter on this story:
