Sugar, cocoa and coffee fell in New
York as commodities declined the most in more than a month after
the dollar advanced on concern the  Federal Reserve  will reduce
stimulus measures should the economy continue to improve.  The Standard & Poor’s  GSCI index  of 24-raw materials fell
as much as 2 percent, the biggest intra-day drop since May 10.
The U.S. dollar index gained for a second day to the highest
level since June 10 after Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said the Fed
may start reducing bond purchases that fueled gains in markets
globally, and end the program known as quantitative easing in
2014 should risks to the  U.S. economy  abate. China’s
manufacturing is shrinking at a faster pace this month.  “What we are seeing is a broad sell-off across all
commodities, led by precious metals,”  Carsten Fritsch , an
analyst at Commerzbank AG in Frankfurt, said by e-mail today.
Bernanke’s comments yesterday sent the dollar and bond yields
higher, reducing the appeal of commodities, and Chinese
manufacturing data led to further deterioration, Fritsch said.  Raw sugar for delivery in October declined 2 percent to
16.94 cents a pound by 5:53 a.m. on ICE Futures U.S. in New
York, reversing a rally yesterday. Arabica coffee for September
delivery was down 1.5 percent to $1.2255 a pound, while cocoa
for September delivery slid 1.5 percent to $2,183 a ton on.  The preliminary reading of 48.3 for a Chinese  Purchasing
Managers ’ Index released today by HSBC Holdings Plc and Markit
Economics compares with the 49.1 median estimate in a Bloomberg
News survey of 15 economists. May’s final reading of 49.2 was
the first below 50 since October, indicating contraction.  Sugar Surplus  Sugar climbed as much as 2.1 percent yesterday after
research firm Datagro Ltd. said the global sugar surplus could
drop to a four-year low because of rising demand for ethanol in
 Brazil , the world’s leading producer of the sweetener.  Sugar output will exceed demand by 430,000 tons in the
2013-14 season starting Oct. 1, compared with a previous
estimate of 6.18 million tons, Plinio Nastari, president of
Datagro, told reporters in  Sao Paulo  yesterday.  In London, white, or refined, sugar for August delivery
fell 1.4 percent to $489 a ton on NYSE Liffe. Robusta coffee for
September delivery retreated 1.4 percent to $1,770 a ton, while
cocoa for delivery in September declined 0.3 percent to 1,444
pounds ($2,232) a ton.  To contact the reporter on this story:
