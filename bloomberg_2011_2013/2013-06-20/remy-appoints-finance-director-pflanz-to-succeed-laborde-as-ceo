Remy Cointreau SA, the maker of Remy
Martin cognac, said finance chief Frederic Pflanz will succeed
Jean-Marie Laborde as chief executive officer.  Pflanz, who joined as finance director in 2010 after a
previous career at  Lâ€™Oreal SA (OR) , will take the reins from October,
Paris-based Remy said today in a statement. Since December, he
has worked alongside Laborde as chief operating officer.  Laborde has been CEO of the distiller since 2004.  To contact the reporter on this story:
