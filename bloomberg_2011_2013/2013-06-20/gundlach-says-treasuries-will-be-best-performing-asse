Jeffrey Gundlach , manager of the
top-ranked DoubleLine Total Return Bond Fund, said U.S.
Treasuries will be the best-performing asset class for the next
few months.  “Government bonds are also caught up in price deflation of
assets and commodities, but I just think if bond yields rise
further then it seems crystal clear to me then equities and
commodities will tank,” Gundlach said in a telephone interview
today. “Therefore, you’ll lose less in Treasuries if rates rise
than many other asset classes.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
