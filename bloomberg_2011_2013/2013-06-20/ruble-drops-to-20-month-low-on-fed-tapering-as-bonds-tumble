The ruble tumbled to its weakest
level in 20 months and Russia’s bonds retreated after the
 Federal Reserve  said it may curb stimulus this year, paring
appetite for emerging-market assets.  The ruble dropped 0.8 percent against the central bank’s
dollar-euro basket to 37.5214 by 1:46 p.m. in Moscow, the lowest
level since October 2011. The yield on Russia’s Eurobonds due
March 2030 jumped 49 basis points to 4.16 percent, the highest
in more than a year. The ruble slid 1.1 percent to the dollar to
32.8130, the worst performance after India’s rupee among 24
emerging-market currencies tracked by Bloomberg.  The Russian currency and bonds joined a global market rout
after Fed Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said the regulator may start
reducing bond purchases that have fueled asset-price gains, and
end the program in 2014 should risks to the  U.S. economy  abate.
Brent oil tumbled 2 percent to $104.04 per barrel. Crude and
natural gas provide about 50 percent of Russian state revenue.  “There are no hysterics, but all bids in long-term bonds
are lower,” Yury Nefedov, fixed income trader at  Renaissance
Capital  in Moscow, said in e-mailed comments. “There some
buyers, mostly closing short positions.”  Investors are pulling money from  emerging markets  at the
fastest pace in two years. More than $19 billion left funds
investing in developing-nation assets in the three weeks to June
12, the most since 2011, according to EPFR Global.  Least Exposed  The ruble may weaken a further 3.2 percent to 33.90 against
the dollar on a new wave of outflows from Russia after
Bernanke’s comments, Anton Zakharov, a foreign exchange analyst
at OAO Promsvyazbank, said in e-mailed comments.  “The ruble is actually one of the least exposed to the Fed
tightening among emerging markets,” Vladimir Kolychev, head of
research at OAO  Rosbank (ROSB) , said in e-mailed comments. “Except for
local  government bonds , there was no build-up of foreign
positioning on local markets whatsoever, so there are not many
positions to be cleaned up as opposed to  Latin America  or
Asia.”  The ruble’s three-month volatility rose 39 basis points to
11.4525, the highest since October 2012, data compiled by
Bloomberg show. The yield on benchmark ruble bonds due 2027
jumped 29 basis points, or 0.29 percentage point, to 7.96
percent.  The central bank started buying rubles on May 29 to slow
its slide. Bank Rossii, which reports currency intervention data
with a delay,  spent  the equivalent of 6.17 billion rubles ($188
million) of foreign currency on June 18.  To contact the reporter on this story:
