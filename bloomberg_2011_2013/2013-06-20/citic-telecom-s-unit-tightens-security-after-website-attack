Citic Telecom International Holdings
Ltd. (1883) ’s Hong Kong unit said it implemented security measures
after its website was hacked and about 2,500 customers’
information may have been leaked. The stock declined.  ComNet Telecom (HK) Ltd. was informed by the Hong Kong
police on June 18 of the detection of an attack by hackers,
according to Veron Ng, the company’s external spokesman at
Strategic Financial Relations Ltd. Citic Telecom shares fell 5.2
percent in the morning session, compared with a 2.5 percent drop
in the benchmark Hang Seng Index.  Hong Kong authorities have been following up on claims by
former U.S. National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden
in a South China Morning Post report that computers in the city
have been the target of U.S. attacks since 2009. China has
called on the U.S. to explain the allegations.  ComNet Telecom shut down its website and is performing
further security tests, Ng said. The company conducted an audit
of its external servers and hasn’t detected unusual activities,
she said. As of this morning, ComNet’s website displays only a
message saying “we’re performing some maintenance at the
moment,” and contents are not accessible.  The company asked customers to change their passwords as a
precaution, and is keeping contact with the local police,
according to an e-mailed statement yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
