Caterpillar Inc. (CAT) , the worldâ€™s
largest maker of construction and mining equipment, said global
retail sales dropped at a slower pace in the three months
through May as Latin America improved.  Total machine retail sales fell 7 percent from the same
period a year earlier, smaller than the 9 percent drop in the
three months through April, the Peoria, Illinois-based company
said today in a filing.  Retail machine sales declined in every region except Latin
America, where they rose 22 percent, according to the filing.
Sales fell 16 percent in North America; 14 percent in the Asia-Pacific region; 2 percent in Europe, Africa and the Middle East;
and 2 percent in the rest of the world.  To contact the reporter on this story:
