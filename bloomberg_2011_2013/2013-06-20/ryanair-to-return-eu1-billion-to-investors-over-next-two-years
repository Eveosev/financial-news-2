Ryanair Holdings Plc (RYA) ,  Europe ’s
biggest discount airline, said it will return 1 billion euros
($1.3 billion) to shareholders over the next two years. The
shares rose to a record.  Ryanair plans to repurchase at least 400 million euros of
stock in the current fiscal year through March 2014, with as
much as 600 million euros to be paid out in the following 12
months in further buybacks or a  special dividend , the Dublin-based company said today in a statement. The second part of the
payout is subject to recent fuel, yield and profitability trends
continuing, it said.  Ryanair Chief Executive Officer  Michael O’Leary  is boosting
returns as he seeks to accelerate the carrier’s annual traffic
growth to 7 percent over coming years from 5 percent. That will
take the passenger total to 110 million by fiscal 2019, 10
million more than previously targeted, according to the company,
which is briefing investors in  London .  The shares rose as much as 5.1 percent, the biggest
intraday increase since May 20, and closed at 7.06 euros, the
highest since their listing.  Ryanair said yesterday a team that it set up to evaluate
 Boeing Co.’s (BA)  737 Max model will report back by the end of
September, paving the way for an order that might run to more
than 200 of the narrow-body planes. The carrier wants to seal
terms including price by the end of this year as it seeks to
swell the fleet to more than 500 aircraft, O’Leary said
yesterday after concluding a deal for 175 current-model
737-800s.  The company already returned 1.53 billion euros to
shareholders since 2008 through 538 million euros in share
buybacks and two special dividends totaling 992 million euros,
according to a  presentation .  To contact the reporter on this story:
