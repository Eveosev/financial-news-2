New York  Times Co. will limit the
number of free stories that people can read through its mobile
software to three articles per day, part of its effort to coax
more readers into signing up for online subscriptions.  Beginning on June 27, any mobile user of New York Times
applications can view three stories in all sections, blogs and
slideshows, the company said today in a statement. Previously,
nonsubscribers could read all articles in the “Top News”
section, though they couldn’t get any material from other areas.  Times Co., facing an industrywide advertising slump, is
relying more heavily on subscription fees. Last year, revenue
from subscriptions surpassed ad sales -- turning the typical
business model for newspaper publishers on its head.  “They’re trying to make the online product more
valuable,” said  Edward Atorino , an analyst at Benchmark Co. in
New York. “Any step to get more digital subscribers is
important because that’s the way the industry’s going as print
circulation is going down.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
