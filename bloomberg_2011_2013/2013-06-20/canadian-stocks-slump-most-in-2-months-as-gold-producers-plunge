Canadian  stocks  plunged to a two-month low, joining a global rout in equities and commodities,
after the U.S. Federal Reserve said it may phase out stimulus
and manufacturing in  China  contracted.  All 10 industries in the  Standard & Poor’s/TSX Composite
Index (SPTSX)  retreated, led by a 5.7 percent decline among raw-materials producers. OceanaGold Corp. lost 12 percent as gold
plunged to a 2 1/2 year low. First Quantum Minerals Ltd. slid
6.4 percent as copper skidded to the weakest in seven weeks.
TransGlobe Energy Corp. fell 13 percent as oil retreated 2.9
percent.  The S&P/TSX lost 299.72 points, or 2.4 percent, to
11,968.57 at 4 p.m. in Toronto, as 94 percent of the gauge’s 237
members retreated. The index is down 3.7 percent this year.
Trading volume was 55 percent higher than the 30-day average.  “The reason why the market reaction today is noticeably
strong is because people had set themselves up for a more dovish
message than they received,” Michael O’Brien,  fund manager  with
TD Asset Management Inc., said from Toronto. He helps manage
C$204 billion ($197 billion) at the firm. “It’s a healthy
shakeup in that we had a one-way trade in bonds, dividend-paying
stocks and financial assets in general. The market is
recalibrating, with the view of ’Maybe we shouldn’t have taken
everything up together, maybe we’ll sort out the wheat from the
chaff.’”  The MSCI All-Country World Index slipped 3.4 percent today,
the most since September 2011. Asian stocks tumbled to the
weakest in 21 months and European shares plunged 3 percent to a
19-month low. The  S&P 500  plunged 2.5 percent for its worst
decline since 2011.  Stimulus, Yields  Fed Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said yesterday the central
bank may begin reducing its $85 billion in monthly bond
purchases this year and end the program in 2014 should the  U.S.
economy  continue to improve.  Canadian 10-year government bond yields have risen about 65
basis points since May 2 to 2.33 percent, driving investors away
from high dividend-paying stocks. The S&P/TSX Telecommunications
and Utilities indexes, which yield higher dividends than the
broader index, have fallen at least 9 percent in the past month
for the worst performance in the benchmark gauge. Utilities
stocks have plunged 6.9 percent in the last two days to the
lowest level in almost three years.  A Chinese manufacturing gauge released today by HSBC
Holdings Plc and Markit Economics reached 48.3 this month, from
49.2 in May. A reading below 50 indicates contraction. China,
the world’s biggest consumer of industrial metals and energy, is
 Canada ’s second-largest trading partner behind the U.S.  Commodity Rout  The S&P GSCI Index, which tracks a basket of global
commodities prices, slid 3.1 percent as gold sank below $1,300
an ounce for the first time since September 2010. Silver plunged
8.3 percent to settle at $19.823 an ounce in  New York . In
trading after the settlement, silver touched $19.56, the lowest
since September 2010. Platinum slumped 4.2 percent and copper
declined 2.5 percent. Crude for July delivery slid the most in
seven months, losing 2.9 percent to settle at $95.40 a barrel.  Raw-materials producers extended their decline in June to
15 percent, falling to the lowest level since January 2009.
OceanaGold tumbled 12 percent to C$1.26 and Detour Gold Corp.
plunged 16 percent to C$8.41 to pace losses among producers of
the precious metal. Barrick Gold Corp., the world’s largest
producer, sank 6.9 percent to C$17.27.  Copper Miners  First Quantum, a copper and gold miner, sank 6.4 percent to
C$15.48 for a two-month low. The company fired 500 workers after
it was ordered to stop building a dam at its Sentinel copper
project in Zambia due to rights issues.  Teck Resources Ltd., Canada’s largest diversified miner,
lost 2.6 percent to C$22.51.  TransGlobe Energy slumped 13 percent to C$6.32 and
Athabasca Oil Corp. declined 8.7 percent to C$6.61 as oil and
gas stocks dropped 2.3 percent as a group.  Manulife Financial Corp. (MFC) , Canada’s largest insurer, gained
1.5 percent to C$16.80, its highest close since July 2011. Tom Mackinnon, analyst with BMO Capital Markets, yesterday raised
the stock to outperform, the equivalent of a buy, from market
perform, equal to a hold, with a target price of C$19 a share.  To contact the reporter on this story:
