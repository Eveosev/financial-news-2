BDC Venture Capital, a Montreal-based company with more than $1 billion under management, plans
to invest C$100 million ($96.3 million) in energy and cleantech
companies in  Canada .  BDC will target “capital-efficient ventures” rather than
large-scale renewable-energy projects such as utility-scale
solar and wind farms, according to a statement today.  “In the energy-efficiency market, there’s so much low-hanging fruit, and substantial room for growth,” Tony Van Bommel, senior managing partner of the company’s
Energy/Cleantech Fund, said today in an interview. “These are
still extremely big opportunities, but they have the capability
to scale.”  The fund has invested in companies developing energy-efficiency technology, biomass power, water-treatment systems
and semiconductors.  To contact the reporter on this story:
