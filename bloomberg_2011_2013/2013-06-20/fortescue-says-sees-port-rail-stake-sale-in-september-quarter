Fortescue Metals Group Ltd. (FMG) ,
 Australia ’s third-largest iron-ore producer, said any potential
sale of a stake in its port and rail assets will likely be
announced in the September quarter.  The sale process is “substantially advanced”, Perth-based
Fortescue said today in a statement. More time is needed to
study offers for the assets because of the level of interest
received, it said.  Fortescue started talks in December to sell a minority
stake in the rail and port operations in Western Australia state
and hired  Lazard Ltd. (LAZ)  and Macquarie Group Ltd. as financial
advisers. Talks to sell the asset stakes may be concluded by the
end of June, Chief Financial Officer Stephen Pearce said on
April 18.  “We are very pleased with the progress to date, having
shortlisted potential investors and advanced to the next phase
of the commercial process,” Chief Executive Officer Neville Power said in the statement.  Share of Fortescue fell 5.7 percent to A$3.17 at 12:29 p.m.
in Sydney trading, set for the biggest decline in two months.
The  stock  is down 32 percent this year.  Fortescue could net as much as $5 billion from its plan to
sell a stake in the infrastructure assets, Credit Suisse Group
AG said June 6.  “Based on the current status, if sanctioned, any
transaction is likely to be announced in the September 2013
quarter,” the company said. “Fortescue is not under pressure
to conclude a sale of an interest in its rail and port assets.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
