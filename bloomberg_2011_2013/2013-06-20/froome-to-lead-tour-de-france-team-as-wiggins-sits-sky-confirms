Chris Froome will lead Team Sky’s
Tour de  France  lineup as Bradley Wiggins won’t defend his title,
the British cycling squad confirmed today.  Froome, 28, won the Tour de Romandie and Criterium du
Dauphine in the buildup to the French race, the biggest event on
the sport’s calendar. The team will be made up of Richie Porte,
Edvald Boasson Hagen, Peter Kennaugh, Vasil Kiryienka, David
Lopez, Kanstantsin Siutsou,  Ian Stannard  and Geraint Thomas, Sky
said today in an e-mailed statement.  Froome finished second behind Wiggins last year. Wiggins
dropped out of the Giro de Italia in May with a knee injury and
a lung infection, and on May 31, the Englishman said he wouldn’t
take part in the French race, which starts June 29.  Last October, Wiggins said he intended to target the
Italian race as a priority and assist teammate Froome at the
Tour de France. In April, he appeared to change plans when he
said he could challenge to win the French race, according to
the  Daily Telegraph .  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
