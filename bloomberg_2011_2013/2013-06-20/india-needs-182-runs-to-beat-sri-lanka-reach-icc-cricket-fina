Shikhar Dhawan and Virat Kohli hit
half-centuries to lift  India  to an eight-wicket win against  Sri
Lanka  and into the final of cricket’s Champions Trophy against
tournament host  England .  Chasing 182 for the victory in yesterday’s semifinal in
Cardiff,  Wales , India only lost its opening batsmen in reaching
the target with 15 of its 50 overs to spare. Dhawan hit 68 off
92 balls to take his tally to a tournament-leading 332 runs and
Kohli added an unbeaten 58 off 64 deliveries. Sri Lanka was
restricted to 181-8 at Sophia Gardens after being put in to bat.  “The bowlers started it off really well,” India captain
MS Dhoni said in televised comments. “It was a good toss to
win.”  India, the world champion in cricket’s 50-overs-per-side
format, will face England for the title in three days at
Edgbaston in Birmingham. England has never won a 50-over global
competition.  India reduced Sri Lanka to 41-3 after Dhoni chose to field
in the rain-delayed second semifinal of the eight-team
International Cricket Council event. Sri Lankan opening batsman
 Tillakaratne Dilshan  also retired with a calf injury in the
fifth over.  Captain Angelo Mathews top scored with 51 and  Mahela
Jayawardene  added 38 as Sri Lanka fought back, though India’s
spin bowlers extracted turn from the pitch to keep the total
under 200. Dilshan returned at the end of the innings and
finished 18 not out. Ishant Sharma took 3-33 and Ravichandran
Ashwin claimed 3-48 to lead India’s bowlers.  “The batters were finding it really hard to find
momentum,” Mathews said. “We didn’t play well. The credit
should go to the India bowlers, they played really well.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
