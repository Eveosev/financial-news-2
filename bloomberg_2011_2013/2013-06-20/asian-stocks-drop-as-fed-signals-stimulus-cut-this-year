Asian  stocks  slumped the most in
almost two years amid concerns a credit crunch in  China  is
worsening and the  Federal Reserve  will reduce stimulus should
the  U.S. economy  continue to the improve.  The MSCI  Asia  Pacific Index dropped 4.1 percent to 127.66
as of 7:33 p.m. in  Tokyo , heading for its biggest loss since
Sept. 11, 2011. Almost nine shares fell for each that rose. Hong
Kong’s  Hang Seng Index (HSI)  erased all gains since Sept. 13, when the
Fed pledged to keep buying assets until it saw “ongoing,
sustained improvement” in the U.S. labor market.  Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said yesterday the central bank
may start dialing down its stimulus effort this year if the
economy achieves the sustainable growth the Fed has sought since
the recession ended in 2009. Markets across the region tumbled,
with declines deepening after China’s interbank interest rates
climbed and a preliminary survey showed a slump in
manufacturing.  “Many investors were hopeful that the party of cheap, easy
money will go on for the next two years and here’s the Fed
signaling the bar will close soon,” said  Jonathan Ravelas ,
chief market strategist at Manila-based BDO Unibank Inc., the
biggest Philippine lender by assets. “A contraction in China is
going to worsen the hangover.”  Japan ’s  Topix index  slipped 1.3 percent, while the Nikkei
225 Stock Average decreased 1.7 percent. South Korea’s Kospi
index declined 2 percent, while Taiwan’s Taiex index slid 1.4
percent. Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 Index dropped 2.1 percent and
New Zealand’s NZX 50 Index lost 1.1 percent.  Regional Rout  The benchmark index in  Colombo ,  Sri Lanka , was the only
major Asia-Pacific measure to advance today, by less than 0.1
percent. Jakarta’s  Composite Index (JCI)  retreated 3.7 percent,
Thailand’s SET Index slumped 2.5 percent and the S&P BSE India
Index slid 2.7 percent.  Industrial & Commercial Bank of China Ltd., Asia’s biggest
lender by market value, dropped 3.8 percent in  Hong Kong , pacing
declines among Chinese lenders.  Samsung Electronics Co. (005930) , the
world’s No. 1 smartphone maker, slipped 2.9 percent in Seoul.
BHP Billiton Ltd., Australia’s top oil producer and the world’s
biggest mining company, sank 2.6 percent as oil and metal
futures decreased.  Manufacturing Slump  China’s Shanghai Composite Index fell 2.8 percent as a
survey from HSBC Holdings Plc and Markit Economics added to
signs of a deepening slowdown in the world’s second-largest
economy. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index slumped 2.9 percent, the
most since July 23, to the lowest since Sept. 13. The Hang Seng
China Enterprise Index, a gauge of mainland companies in the
city, plunged 3.3 percent.  The nation’s one-year interest-rate swap, which is used to
exchange fixed payments for the floating seven-day repurchase
rate, surged as much as 58 basis points to 5.05 percent, the
highest since Bloomberg started tracking the data in May 2006.
The  seven-day repurchase rate , which measures interbank funding
availability, also climbed to a seven-year high.  “There is a credit crunch in the near term,” said  Ben Kwong , chief operating officer at Hong Kong-based KGI Asia Ltd.
“It’s reflecting the government’s effort to clean up
outstanding financial issues. The expectation of a China
slowdown is already building up. Few people will be confident
that the Chinese government will be able to maintain 7.5 percent
growth this year unless it introduces some stimulative
measures.”  Factory Decline  The preliminary reading of 48.3 for a China Purchasing
Managers’ Index released today by HSBC compares with the 49.1
median estimate in a Bloomberg News survey of 15 economists.
May’s final reading of 49.2 was the first below 50 since
October, indicating contraction.  Shares on the MSCI Asia Pacific Index yesterday traded at
12.8 times average estimated earnings compared with 14.8 for the
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index and 13 times for the Stoxx Europe
600 Index, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The Hang
Seng China Enterprises Index is trading for 6.9 times projected
profit, compared with the three-year average of 9.5.  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index fell 0.8 percent
today, indicating the gauge may extend yesterday’s 1.4 percent
retreat, the biggest decline this month.  Chinese Lenders  Chinese lenders and developers tumbled. ICBC, as China’s
biggest lender is known, sank 3.8 percent to HK$4.57, heading
for its lowest close since Oct. 8. The country’s No. 1 lender
hasn’t advanced since May 31.  China Construction Bank Corp. (939) 
slumped 5.2 percent to to HK$5.15. China Overseas Land &
Investment Ltd., the largest mainland real-estate company traded
in Hong Kong, fell 6.2 percent to HK$19.14.  Exporters dropped. Samsung Electronics slipped 2.9 percent
to 1.329 million won in Seoul. Canon Inc., the world’s biggest
camera maker, fell 1.1 percent to 3,215 yen in Tokyo.  James
Hardie Industries SE (JHX) , a building materials supplier that gets
about 70 percent of sales from the U.S., tumbled 2.8 percent to
A$9.37 in Sydney.  Energy companies and raw-material producers were among the
biggest losers of the 10  industry groups  in the MSCI Asia
Pacific Index, all of which fell at least 2.9 percent today.
Crude oil headed for a second day of decline after U.S.
stockpiles unexpectedly increased. Copper fell to a seven-week
low, while gold slid to the lowest level in a month.  BHP Billiton  sank 2.6 percent to A$32.15 in Sydney. Inpex
Corp., Japan’s biggest energy explorer, plunged 3.7 percent to
417,500 yen. Zijin Mining Group Co., China’s largest gold
producer, dropped 1.8 percent to HK$1.68 in Hong Kong.  To contact the reporters on this story:
