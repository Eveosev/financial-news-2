Toyota Motor Corp. (7203) , the world’s
largest automaker by vehicle sales, said it’s investing $200
million at three U.S. plants.  The spending includes $150 million at a Huntsville,
Alabama, engine plant, according to an e-mailed statement
yesterday. Toyota is also investing at factories in Troy,
Missouri, and Jackson,  Tennessee , which supply the Alabama
facility.  The  automaker , based in Toyota City,  Japan , saw its U.S.
vehicle sales rise 5.2 percent this year through May, less than
the 7.3 percent industrywide sales increase. Toyota has spent
about $2 billion in North American manufacturing investments the
past two years.  The plans disclosed today are to boost machining capacity
and engine part output for V-6 engines. Toyota will complete an
expansion of the engine plant by early 2014. The machining
project announced today is scheduled to be completed by July
2015.  To contact the reporter on this story:
