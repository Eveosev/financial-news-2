Zambia held “fruitful” talks with
 Gemfields Plc (GEM)  this week over allowing emeralds to be auctioned
offshore as well as in the country, the mining minister said.  “We are working very hard to make sure we do the best for
the industry and the government,” Minister Christopher Yaluma
said in an interview yesterday in the nation’s capital of
Lusaka. “We are willing to talk and explore.”  Zambia, the third-biggest emerald producer, in April said
it wanted all auctions of the green stones held in the country.
Gemfields, the nation’s biggest producer of the gems, has said
that the company’s sales would be hurt by such an arrangement. A
sale in Singapore due on June 10-14 was postponed as Gemfields
sought clarification on the rules, it said June 10. The producer
held its first and so far only Zambian auction in April.  Talks with Yaluma, who replaced Yamfwa Mukanga as minister
this month, have been positive, Sean Gilbertson, an executive
director at the company, said in an interview yesterday.  “Both sides hope that we will have a win-win in the not
too distant future,” he said. The minister discussed possibly
holding some auctions in Zambia and some abroad, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
