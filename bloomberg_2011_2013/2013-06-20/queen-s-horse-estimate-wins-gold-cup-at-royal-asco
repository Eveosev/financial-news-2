Queen Elizabeth II’s Estimate won
the Gold Cup today at Royal Ascot, the first time a horse
carrying the colors of a reigning monarch won the race.  The four-year-old filly, trained by Michael Stoute and
ridden by  Ryan Moore , won the 2-1/2 mile event with Simenon and
Top Trip pressuring her at the end. Estimate was the favorite,
at 7-2 odds. That means a successful $2 bet brings in $7 plus
the original wager.  The Queen has had 21 winners at Ascot before today’s event,
the first being Choir Boy in the 1953 Royal Hunt Cup. She
watched the race from a box in the grandstand, wearing a purple
hat and jacket.  Five-day Royal Ascot, held in Berkshire west of  London , is
Britain’s richest race meeting, with prize money of 4.5 million
pounds ($7 million).  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
