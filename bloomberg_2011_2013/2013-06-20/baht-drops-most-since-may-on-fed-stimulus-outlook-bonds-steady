Thailand ’s baht fell the most in
almost six weeks after Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke 
said the central bank may taper stimulus measures this year if
the  U.S. economy  improves further. Government bonds were steady.  The Federal Open Market Committee yesterday left the
monthly pace of bond purchases unchanged at $85 billion, while
saying that “downside risks to the outlook for the economy and
the labor market” have diminished. Global funds  pulled  $2.7
billion from Thai bonds and equities since May 22, when Bernanke
signaled a reduction in measures know as quantitative easing
that have spurred demand for emerging-market assets. The Bank of
Thailand can handle capital outflows given the size of foreign
 reserves , Governor Prasarn Trairatvorakul said June 17.  The baht slumped 1.1 percent to 31.05 per dollar as of 8:35
a.m. in Bangkok, the biggest slide since May 10, data compiled
by Bloomberg show. The currency reached 31.08 earlier, within
0.4 percent of a nine-month low of 31.19 level touched on June
12. One-month implied volatility, a measure of expected moves in
the  exchange rate  used to price options, climbed 13 basis
points, or 0.13 percentage point, to 8.08 percent.  “Bernanke hinting at the timing of the reduction in the
quantitative easing is leading to dollar purchases across the
board,” said Kozo Hasegawa, a Bangkok-based foreign-exchange
trader at Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corp. “But concern about
intervention is growing if the baht weakens sharply beyond 31.”  Governor Prasarn said last week the central bank sold “a
certain amount of dollars.” The authority’s reserves stood at
$176.5 billion on June 7, up 2.7 percent from a year earlier,
Bank of Thailand data show.  The government sees no need to implement measures to stem
outflows, Somchai Sujjapongse, director-general of the finance
ministry’s fiscal policy office, said June 14. Money will
eventually flow back, he said.  The yield on the 3.625 percent  government bonds  due June
2023 was little changed at 3.78 percent, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
