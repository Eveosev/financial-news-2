Derivatives traders eliminated $48.7
trillion of contracts in the over-the-counter  derivatives market 
last year amid efforts to curb risk by tearing up duplicative
trades, according to the  International Swaps and Derivatives
Association .  Traders have cut $214.3 trillion of notional value in
offsetting contracts during the past five years in the privately
negotiated market, the New York-based industry lobby group said
today in a statement.  Banks,  hedge funds  and asset managers in the U.S. are
adapting to changes mandated by the 2010 Dodd-Frank Act,
including a requirement to process most swaps with a
clearinghouse to cut the risk that the failure of a major
counterparty in the market triggers a cascade of losses. At
year-end, the notional value of contracts outstanding was $565.2
trillion, up from $529.7 trillion in 2007, according to ISDA.  “The industry has made great strides to reduce
counterparty credit risk and help make the derivatives markets
safe and efficient through netting, collateralization, portfolio
compression and central clearing,”  Robert Pickel , ISDA chief
executive officer, said in the statement. “While the increase
in compression continues to impact adjusted OTC derivatives
volumes, underlying market activity remains robust.”  About $173.2 trillion of OTC derivatives were cleared by
the end of last year, including 54 percent of all interest-rate
derivatives, ISDA said. Clearing increases the market’s size
because one bilateral trade is broken into two cleared trades,
ISDA said. Adjusting for that, the notional value of outstanding
OTC derivatives, excluding foreign exchange contracts, fell 10.9
percent at the end of last year from year-end 2011, ISDA said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
