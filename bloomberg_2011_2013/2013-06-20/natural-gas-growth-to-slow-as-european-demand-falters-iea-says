Natural gas demand for power
generation will slow in the next five years as European
consumption falters and  Africa  and the Middle East struggle to
boost production, according to the International Energy Agency.  Global consumption of the fuel will rise by 2.4 percent a
year until 2018, down from last year’s forecast for 2.7 percent
annual growth, the Paris-based agency said in its medium-term
gas market report published today.  Europe’s gas use fell 1.6 percent last year amid the
region’s second recession since 2008 and a 16 percent drop in
carbon prices that encouraged power production from coal instead
of cleaner-burning gas. Exporters from  Egypt  to  Indonesia  have
started importing the fuel as domestic production fails to keep
pace with local demand growth.  “European demand and Middle Eastern production are
indicative of the obstacles that gas has to overcome as it
expands its role in the global energy system,” Maria van der Hoeven, executive director of the IEA, said in the report.  World gas demand will rise to 3,962 billion cubic meters in
2018 from 3,427 billion in 2012, according to the IEA. The
increase is equivalent to current Middle Eastern gas output, or
1.7 times global LNG trade, the adviser to 28 nations said in
its report.  European natural gas consumption will fall to 506 billion
cubic meters next year from 513 billion in 2012, before rising
to 525 billion in 2018. Chinese use will almost double to 295
billion cubic meters in 2018 after 13 percent growth last year,
and will account for about 30 percent of the increase in global
demand, the IEA said.  U.S. Shale  The use of natural gas as a fuel in road transport will
rise to 2.5 percent of total demand in 2018 from 1.2 percent in
2012, spurred by  China ’s need for less-polluting fuel and the
conversion in the U.S. of long-haul heavy trucks to LNG from
diesel, according to the IEA.  Growth of unconventional shale gas in the U.S. will
“dwarf” unconventional developments outside North America, the
IEA said. U.S. shale will provide more than a fifth of the
global increase in gas production to 2018 as the nation’s output
rises 17 percent from 2012 levels to 797 billion cubic meters,
the IEA said.  World gas output will climb 15 percent in the period to
3,959 billion cubic meters, according to the report. Australian
production will rise 156 percent to 141 billion cubic meters.  To contact the reporter on this story:
