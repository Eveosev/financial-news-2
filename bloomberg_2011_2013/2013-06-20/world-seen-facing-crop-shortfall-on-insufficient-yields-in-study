World grain and soybean yields are
not growing fast enough to double harvests by 2050, meaning
output may fail to meet rising demand without clearing more land
for farming, according to a University of Minnesota study.  Based on yield gains in the 20 years through 2008, global
corn production may climb 67 percent through 2050, while rice
output would rise 42 percent, wheat 38 percent and soybeans 55
percent, researchers led by Deepak Ray at the university wrote
in a study  published  via online journal Plos One.  Estimates for how much agricultural production needs to
increase to feed the world in 2050 range from 60 percent to 110
percent, the researchers wrote. Doubling farm output by 2050
would translate into crop production climbing an average 2.4
percent a year, Ray and his colleagues said.  “Clearly, the world faces a looming agricultural crisis,
with yield increases insufficient to keep up with projected
demands,” study co-author Jon Foley was cited as saying in a
 statement  on the university’s website.  The researchers found the global average rate of yield
growth for corn has been 1.6 percent a year, while for rice it
was 1 percent. Wheat yields on average rose 0.9 percent a year,
while for soybeans, productivity grew 1.3 percent annually.  “Current growth in global crop yields will be insufficient
to feed the world in 2050,” according to the University of
Minnesota.  More efficient use of arable lands and increasing yield
growth rates by sharing best-management practices may help lift
production, the study authors wrote. Changing to more plant-based diets and reducing food waste could reduce the large
expected growth in demand, according to the researchers.  Environmental Costs  “A portion of the production shortfall could also be met
by expanding croplands, but at a high environmental cost to
biodiversity and carbon emissions,” the authors said.  Based on yield trends, corn productivity would rise to 8.6
metric tons per hectare (2.47 acres) in 2050 from 5.2 tons per
hectare in 2008, the study showed. Production could climb to
1.02 billion tons in 2025 and 1.34 billion tons in 2050,
resulting in a shortfall of 247 million tons by 2050 compared to
a rate that doubles production, according to the researchers.  For rice, the projected shortfall compared to doubling
output would be 394 million tons in 2050, while for wheat it
would be 388 million tons and for soybeans 107 million tons,
according to the study.  To contact the reporter on this story:
