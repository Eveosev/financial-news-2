Robert Downey Jr. will return as
 Iron Man  in two “Avengers” sequels for Walt  Disney (DIS)  Co.’s
Marvel after helping make the original the No. 3 top-grossing
movie in history.  Downey will play the billionaire inventor Tony Stark, who
doubles as the superhero Iron Man, in “Marvel’s The Avengers
2” and “Marvel’s The Avengers 3,” Burbank, California-based
Disney, said today on its  website .  The deal adds two more potentially lucrative films to a
Disney/Marvel lineup that already includes individual “Iron
Man” movies and pictures with other characters such as Thor and
the Hulk. The original “Avengers,” released in 2012, had
worldwide ticket sales of $1.5 billion. This year’s “Iron Man
3” is fifth on the  best-selling list  $1.2 billion, according to
researcher Box Office Mojo.  Joss Whedon, who wrote and directed “Marvel’s The
Avengers,” will return for “Marvel’s The Avengers 2,”
scheduled for release in May 2015, the company said. Whedon told
Entertainment Weekly in an interview published on June 6 that he
wouldn’t do another “Avengers” film  without Downey.  The “Avengers” movies unite Iron Man with other
characters from Marvel comics to battle villains. The first film
included The Hulk, Thor, Hawkeye and Black Widow.  Disney fell 3.7 percent to $61.98 at 4 p.m. in New York,
making it the biggest loser in the  Dow Jones Industrial Average (INDU) 
today. The stock has gained 24 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
