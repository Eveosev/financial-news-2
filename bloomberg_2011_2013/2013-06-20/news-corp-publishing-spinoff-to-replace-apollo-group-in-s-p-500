News Corp. (NWSA) ’s publishing spinoff will
replace  Apollo Group Inc. (APOL)  in the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index
after the media company splits itself later this month, S&P said
in a statement today.  News Corp. will become two publicly traded companies -- a
move that followed shareholder pressure to separate the faster-growing TV and movie assets from the publishing business. The
entertainment operation will be called 21st Century Fox, while
the publishing business will take the News Corp. name.  The spinoff will be added to the S&P 500 on June 28, as the
transaction is expected to be completed on or about that date,
S&P said. The renamed 21st Century Fox will remain in the S&P
100 and 500 indexes.  Apollo Group, the largest for-profit college chain, will
take  Forest Oil Corp. (FST) ’s spot in the S&P MidCap 400 Index, while
Forest Oil will replace  Enzo Biochem Inc. (ENZ)  in the SmallCap 600
Index. The changes will take place after the close of trading on
June 28, the statement said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
