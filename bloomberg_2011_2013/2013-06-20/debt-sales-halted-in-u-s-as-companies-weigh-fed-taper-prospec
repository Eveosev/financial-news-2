Corporate bond  sales  in the U.S.
have all but halted after the Federal Reserve said this week
that it’s prepared to taper its stimulus program later this
year, prompting the biggest increase in investment-grade yields
in 21 months.  Solar Star Inc. was the only borrower said to be marketing
bonds yesterday, with a $1 billion issue, following $330 million
in offerings June 19. The slowdown is trimming a daily average
of $7 billion as of June 18 that put 2013 on pace for a record
year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Offerings dwindled in anticipation of the Federal Open
Market Committee’s meeting this week, at which policy makers
declared “diminished” downside risks to the economy and stated
they will probably begin tapering $85 billion in monthly bond
buying later in 2013, provided the economy performs in line with
Fed projections. The statements put fixed-income investors “on
notice” for a potential rise in interest rates, said Anthony Valeri at LPL Financial Corp.  “It’s a really illiquid environment right now and nobody
wants to step in,” Valeri, a San Diego-based market strategist,
said in a telephone interview. “There’s uncertainty over the
dollar amount of tapering, and the fact that the Fed was bullish
opens up the possibility of a late 2014 rate hike,” he said,
referring to the Fed’s benchmark interest rate, which has been
kept between zero and 0.25 percent since December 2008.  Yields Surge  Yields on investment-grade debt rose 11 basis points to
3.22 percent June 19, the biggest one-day climb since an
identical increase on Sept. 23, 2011, according to the Bank of
America Merrill Lynch U.S. Corporate Index. Borrowing costs are
the highest since July 9, 2012, when they reached 3.23 percent.  The extra yield investors demand to hold the debt instead
of similar-maturity Treasuries decreased 1 basis point June 19
to 157 basis points, down from this year’s high of 159 basis
points on June 13, index figures show.  “If the incoming data are broadly consistent with this
forecast, the committee currently anticipates that it would be
appropriate to moderate the pace of purchases later this year,”
Fed Chairman Ben S. Bernanke said in a press conference in
 Washington  following the FOMC’s June 18-19 meeting. If later
reports meet the Fed’s expectations, “we will continue to
reduce the pace of purchases in measured steps through the first
half of next year, ending purchases around mid-year.”  Utopia Disrupted  Offerings of $785.2 billion this year exceed the $675.7
billion issued in the similar period in 2012, when issuance
reached an unprecedented $1.48 trillion, Bloomberg data show.
Sales are decelerating with the $44.1 billion issued this month
on pace to fall below the  $81.8 billion  in June 2012.  “Credit investors will have to experience some disruption
to the prior years’ utopian conditions, namely rising Treasury
prices and equity prices,” analysts led by Matthew Mish at UBS
AG wrote in a research report yesterday. “It appears this
phenomenon could play out sooner rather than later.”  Solar Star, an under-construction California solar power
plant linked to Berkshire Hathaway Inc., sold 5.375 percent
bonds due June 2035 to yield 296 basis points more than
benchmarks, Bloomberg data show. Proceeds from the offering,
rated Baa3 by Moody’s Investors Service, will be used to help
fund construction, according to a June 7 statement from the
ratings company.  To contact the reporter on this story:
