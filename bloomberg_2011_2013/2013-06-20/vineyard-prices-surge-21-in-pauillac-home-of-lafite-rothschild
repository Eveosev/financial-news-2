Vineyard prices in Pauillac, the
Bordeaux wine region home to Chateau Latour and Lafite
Rothschild, jumped 21 percent last year, pushing the cost of a
plot of vines the size of a rugby field to $2.6 million.  Pauillac wine property changed owner for 1.2 million euros
($1.6 million) to 2.5 million euros a hectare (2.47 acres) in
2012,  France ’s  Agriculture Ministry  wrote in an online  report 
today. Average prices rose to 2 million euros from 1.65 million
euros in 2011.  The price of wine real estate in Pauillac jumped sixfold in
10 years, and in France only some grand cru properties in
Burgundy carry higher prices at 3.8 million euros a hectare,
according to the Paris-based ministry. In the Champagne region,
buying vines in the most expensive Cote de Blancs appellation
costs 1.5 million euros a hectare, it said.  “Five  appellations , Pomerol, Margaux, Saint-Estephe,
Saint-Julien and Pauillac, positioned on high-end markets and
export oriented, don’t seem to have experienced the crisis of
wine property,” the ministry wrote, referring to Bordeaux
appellations known in French as the “five sisters.”  A case of 2006 wine from  Chateau Latour  sold for 4,200
pounds ($6,500) on the Liv-ex market in  London  this week, the
highest in seven months.  Buying all wine real estate in the Aquitaine region that
includes Bordeaux would cost 11 billion euros at 2012 prices,
according to the report.  Saint-Emilion  The seven Bordeaux wine-growing areas where real estate
costs more than 200,000 euros a hectare, including the “five
sisters” as well as Saint-Emilion and Pessac-Leognan, account
for 1/10 of the region’s vineyards and almost three-quarters of
its value, the report showed. That compared with less than half
of the value in 2000 and a third in 1991.  Property prices in Margaux and Saint-Julien tripled in a
decade, while doubling in Saint-Estephe and Pessac-Leognan and
rising 50 percent in Pomerol, according to the report.  In Pomerol, which contains  Chateau Petrus , average vineyard
prices were unchanged at 900,000 euros a hectare, with
transactions valuing wine property between 550,000 euros and
2.35 million euros a hectare last year, the report showed.  Prices in the Saint-Julien and Margaux appellations fell 9
percent to 1 million euros a hectare, the ministry said. In
Pessac-Leognan, vineyard costs jumped 21 percent to an average
470,000 euros a hectare.  82,000 Euros  Average prices for wine real estate in Aquitaine climbed
3.3 percent in 2012 to 82,000 euros a hectare, driven by gains
for more expensive properties, according to the report.  “The real-estate price development is only due to the rise
for high-end vineyards,” the ministry said. “Transaction
prices for the remainder of the vineyards, after 10 very
difficult years, are stabilizing, or continue to fall for a
small number of appellations.”  One hectare in Pauillac would buy two hectares of vines in
Margaux, 10 in Saint-Emilion or 40 in Sauternes, according to
the ministry. Twenty years ago, wine property in Pauillac was 10
percent to 30 percent more expensive than in the other three
areas, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
