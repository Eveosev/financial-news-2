GameStop Corp. (GME) , the largest video-game specialty retailer, rose to its highest price in more than
four years after  Microsoft Corp. (MSFT)  reversed a policy that would
have curbed trading and reselling of used games on its Xbox One
unit.  GameStop, based in Grapevine,  Texas ,  jumped  6.3 percent to
$40.94 at the close, its highest price since Sept. 12, 2008. The
stock has risen 63 percent this year compared with an 11 percent
gain for the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index.  Microsoft said yesterday it will drop curbs on reselling,
trading and lending used titles and the need for regular
Internet connections on its Xbox One in order to play disc-based
games. Sony Corp.’s rival new PlayStation 4 console doesn’t have
any game transaction limits.  Pre-owned games, which GameStop customers trade in for new
versions, were 31 percent of first-quarter revenue, while new
ones represented more than 37 percent.  The Xbox One and the PlayStation 4 will go on sale in the
U.S. in the fall.  To contact the reporter on this story:
