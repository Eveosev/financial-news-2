Morocco’s state-owned Royal Air
Maroc should forge a strategic partnership that may involve the
sale of a stake, Transport and Infrastructure Minister Aziz Rabbah said,  Royal Air Maroc, or RAM, also plans to purchase as many as
20 medium-haul aircraft and five long-haul aircraft, Rabbah said
in a telephone interview. With a fleet dominated by  Boeing Co. (BA) 
jets, the carrier’s most recent major purchase was in 2001, when
it ordered four medium-haul Airbus SAS aircraft.  The timing of the tender and delivery of the planes
“depends on how the situation of RAM evolves,” Rabbah said.  In 2011, the government provided Royal Air with a $180
million bailout, and the airline dismissed 30 percent of its
workforce. A partial sale of RAM has been on the table for
decades but never came about as it struggled to sustain
profitability, despite a monopoly status on domestic flights.  Royal Air Maroc is expected to play a key role in “helping
the government achieve its tourism development strategy,”
Rabbah said. “It should cover  Latin America ,  Asia ,  Russia  and
 Africa .”  Morocco’s government said in 2010 it hoped to double the
number of tourist visitors to 20 million by 2020 and more than
double tourism receipts to 140 billion dirhams.  “We restructured the firm to help it accommodate the
tourism development strategy,” Rabbah said. “RAM has every
interest in striking a strategic partnership” with a major
airline, “and even sell a stake of its capital if this helps
the partnership,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
