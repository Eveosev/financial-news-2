Rona Inc. (RON) ,  Canada ’s largest home-improvement store chain, agreed to sell its commercial and
professional unit to EMCO Corp. for C$215 million ($207.8
million) as it focuses on its retail operations.  The sale will result in a pretax loss of about C$125
million, mostly to write down the division’s goodwill,
Boucherville, Quebec-based Rona said today in a statement.  Chief Executive Officer Dominique Boies has been trying to
boost profit by cutting jobs and selling underperforming units
while reinvesting in stores. The commercial business, which Rona
acquired in its 2007 purchase of Noble Trade Inc., sells
plumbing, heating and air-conditioning systems to contractors
under the Noble, Don Park and MPH Supplies names.  “We need to focus on what’s really core,” Boies said in a
telephone interview from Toronto. “Noble represented a low
contribution to overall sales, and this transaction frees up
capital to Rona.”  The C$215 million from the sale initially will be used to
pay down debt, Boies said.  EMCO, based in  London , Ontario, will add the unit to its
Talisker Plumbing Corp. subsidiary.  Rona fell 1.4 percent to C$10.10 at 10:54 a.m. in Toronto.
The  shares  had dropped 4 percent this year through yesterday,
compared with a 1.3 percent decline for the Standard &
Poor’s/TSX Composite Index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
