Mexico ’s peso fell to an 11-month
low and bond yields surged after Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said the U.S. central bank may phase out stimulus that
has bolstered demand for the Latin American country’s assets.  The currency slid 1.6 percent to 13.4533 per  U.S. dollar  at
9:58 a.m. in Mexico City. A close at that level would be the
weakest since July 25. Yields on peso bonds due in 2024 rose 38
basis points, or 0.38 percentage point, to 5.89 percent,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg, the largest one-day
increase since February 2009.  “It’s amazing,” Alejandro Urbina, a portfolio manager who
helps oversee about $800 million in emerging-market assets at
Silva Capital Management, said in a telephone interview from
 Chicago . “The move in Mexico certainly has been very dramatic
over the past few weeks.”  The peso’s 4 percent drop in two days is the most in
 emerging markets  after Bernanke said yesterday that the Fed may
start reducing the $85 billion in monthly bond purchases that
have boosted demand for Mexico’s debt. Policy makers could end
the asset buying next year if economic risks in the U.S.,
Mexico’s biggest trading partner, abate, Bernanke said.  Yields on the benchmark debt touched a record low 4.48
percent on May 9 before Bernanke said May 22 that the Fed may
reduce the pace of asset purchases if there was sustainable
improvement in U.S. employment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
