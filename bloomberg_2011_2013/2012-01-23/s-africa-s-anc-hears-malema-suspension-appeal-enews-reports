Officials from  South Africa ’s 
ruling African National Congress started hearing an appeal by
 Julius Malema , the leader of the party’s Youth League, against
his five-year suspension, the eNews Channel reported, without
saying where it got the information.  Malema is arguing that members of the disciplinary panel
who suspended him for undermining party unity were bias and he
was denied an opportunity to present argument in mitigation of
sentence, the Cape Town-based broadcaster said.  ANC spokesman Keith Khoza declined to comment, while Floyd Shivambu, a spokesman for the Youth League, didn’t answer calls
to his mobile phone.  To contact the reporter on this story:
