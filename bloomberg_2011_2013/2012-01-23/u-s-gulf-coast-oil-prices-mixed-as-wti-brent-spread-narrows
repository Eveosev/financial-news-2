U.S. Gulf Coast oil premiums were
mixed as the discount narrowed for West Texas Intermediate oil
compared to Brent, the European benchmark.  The gap between the two oils decreased 10 cents to $11.43
at 12:39 p.m. in  New York  based on the contracts for March
delivery, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  When Brent decreases versus WTI, it weakens the value of
low-sulfur U.S. grades that compete with West African oil priced
against the European benchmark.  In the U.S. Gulf Coast,  Light Louisiana Sweet (USCSLLSS) ’s premium to
WTI added 40 cents to $11.30 a barrel.  Heavy Louisiana Sweet (USCSHLSE) 
decreased 65 cents to $12.85 over the U.S. benchmark.  Thunder Horse’s premium narrowed 20 cents to $11.25. Mars
Blend increased 15 cents to $8.65 over WTI.  Poseidon (USCSPOSE) ’s premium
added 55 cents to $8.60.  Southern Green Canyon (USCSSGCN)  increased 65 cents to $7.50 over WTI.
 West Texas Sour (USCSWTSM) ’s discount widened 20 cents to $1.85 a barrel.  Syncrude (USCSSYNS) ’s discount was unchanged at $3.20 a barrel.
Syncrude is a light, low-sulfur synthetic oil derived from the
 tar sands  in  Alberta .  Western Canada Select (USCSWCAS) ’s discount to WTI was unchanged at
$21.  To contact the reporter on this story:
