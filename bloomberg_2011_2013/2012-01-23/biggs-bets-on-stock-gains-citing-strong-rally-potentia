Barton Biggs , who increased bets on
U.S. equities before the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index rallied
last month, said he remains bullish even amid concerns over
progress in solving Europe’s debt crisis.  “I’m terrified I’m not long enough if we’re going to have
a strong rally here, which we could,” he said during an
interview on Bloomberg Television’s “In the Loop” with Betty Liu today. Biggs said his net-long position in equities is 65
percent. At the same time, “I’m terrified I’m too long if the
apocalypse is coming in Europe,” he said.  The founder of Traxis Partners LP said on Dec. 12 that he
was investing in U.S. and Asian stocks. Biggs said at the time
that equities might rise or fall 20 percent because of concern
about budget negotiations and  Europe . The  S&P 500  has increased
6.4 percent since then through Jan. 20.  His optimism on stocks has fluctuated along with the
market. Biggs reduced the net-long position, a gauge of bullish
versus bearish investments, in the Traxis Global Equity Macro
Fund to about 40 percent at the end of September before
increasing it to 65 percent on Oct. 17 and 80 percent on Oct.
31, according to interviews with Bloomberg. On Nov. 21, he said
he cut the level to less than 40 percent. On Dec. 2, he said he
boosted it to about 60 percent.  U.S. stocks have  risen  for three weeks, the longest streak
since October, as better-than-estimated economic data and
company earnings boosted confidence in American growth. The  S&P
500  gained 4.6 percent in 2012 through last week, the best start
to a year since 1997. The benchmark gauge for U.S. equities rose
0.1 percent to 1,316 at 4 p.m. New York time today.  To contact the reporters on this story:
