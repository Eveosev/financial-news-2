The cost of insuring against default
on European corporate and sovereign debt fell, according to
traders of credit-default swaps.  Contracts on the Markit iTraxx Crossover Index of 50
companies with mostly high-yield credit ratings fell 17.5 basis
points to 630, the lowest since Oct. 28, according to JPMorgan
Chase & Co. at 3 p.m. in London. A decline signals improvement
in perceptions of  credit quality .  The Markit iTraxx Europe Index of 125 companies with
investment-grade ratings decreased 6.5 basis points to 147.5
basis points. The Markit iTraxx Financial Index linked to senior
debt of 25 banks and insurers dropped 10 basis points to 219.5
and the subordinated index fell 17 to 403.  The Markit iTraxx SovX Western Europe Index of swaps on 15
governments decreased six basis points to 331.  A basis point on a credit-default swap protecting 10
million euros ($13 million) of debt from default for five years
is equivalent to 1,000 euros a year. Swaps pay the buyer face
value in exchange for the underlying securities or the cash
equivalent should a borrower fail to adhere to its debt
agreements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
