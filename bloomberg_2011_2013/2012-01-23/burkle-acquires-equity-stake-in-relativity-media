Billionaire  Ron Burkle  acquired an
equity stake in Relativity Media LLC, the independent film and
television studio led by Ryan Kavanaugh, his second investment
in the entertainment industry this month.  The purchase follows an investment in the company’s debt
that Burkle made last year, according to an e-mailed statement
today from Relativity and Yucaipa Cos. The price of the equity
stake and the name of the seller weren’t disclosed.  Burkle agreed to buy Elliott Management Corp.’s minority
stake in the studio, two people with knowledge of the situation
said on Jan. 6. Elliott, a New York-based hedge fund, will
continue to hold a small investment in Relativity, one of the
people said at the time.  The purchase marks Burkle’s second entertainment
acquisition this month. On Jan. 5, Y Entertainment Corp., a unit
of Yucaipa, bought Artist Group International, the New York-
based company that books concerts for Billy Joel,  Rod Stewart 
and Metallica.  Relativity has produced or co-produced films including
“The Fighter,” winner of last year’s Academy Awards for best
supporting actor and actress. The studio’s “Mirror, Mirror,” a
retelling of the Snow White legend, will be released in March,
according to the Internet Movie Database.  To contact the reporter on this story:
