AB Klaipedos Nafta (KNF1L) , which operates
Lithuania’s oil terminal on the  Baltic Sea , picked Norway’s
Hoegh LNG to supply a vessel for the country’s planned floating
liquefied-natural-gas terminal.  Hoegh will provide a floating storage regasification unit,
maintenance and a vessel crew, the Klaipeda-based company said
today in a statement to the stock exchange. Operations are
planned to start at the end of 2014, it said.  The Baltic nation is building a gas terminal to diversify
its imports from Russia’s OAO Gazprom, its sole supplier. The
country imports all of its gas from Russia.  Lithuania will lease the vessel from Hoegh for 10 years and
then will have the right to buy the regasification unit,
according to the statement. Klaipedos Nafta, which is 70.6
percent owned by the state, is expected to conclude the deal
with Hoegh in February.  Hoegh LNG ordered new floating storage and regasification
units from Hyundai Heavy Industries with a capacity of 170,000
cubic meters of LNG, according to a  statement  on the company’s
website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
