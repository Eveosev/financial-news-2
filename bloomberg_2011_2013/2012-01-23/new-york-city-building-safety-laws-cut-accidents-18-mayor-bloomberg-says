New York City construction accidents
decreased by 18 percent last year, and those resulting in injury
fell by 7.8 percent, declines Mayor  Michael Bloomberg  attributed
to safety measures the city has enacted since 2008.  Five accidents last year resulted in deaths, one more than
in 2010, because of violations of safety procedures, the mayor
said. Construction-related accidents fell to 128 last year from
157 in 2010, and mishaps that caused injury fell to 152 from 165
in 2010, the mayor said.  “Even as construction activity rose by nearly 8 percent
last year, the number of construction-related accidents fell,”
Bloomberg told reporters at a construction site in Queens. Rules
prohibiting smoking have reduced fires, and “cocoons” used
around work areas have prevented materials from falling and
causing injury, he said.  The city Buildings Department issued more than 5,100 stop-
work orders last year to violators of the safety rules, the
mayor’s office said in a statement.  The city began instituting new laws and rules in 2008 after
crane accidents killed three workers in two accidents within
three months, and after a 2007 fire during demolition of the
Deutsche Bank building in  Lower Manhattan  killed two
firefighters.  The mayor is founder and majority owner of Bloomberg News
parent Bloomberg LP.  To contact the reporters on this story:
