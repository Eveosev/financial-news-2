Iraq , which is seeking to boost
crude exports to rebuild its economy, said oil shipments climbed
3.7 percent in December to 66.5 million barrels, generating the
highest revenue in four months, $7.06 billion.  Daily crude exports in December averaged 2.15 million
barrels,  Asim Jihad , a spokesman for the Oil Ministry in
 Baghdad , said today in an e-mailed statement. Iraq exported 64.1
million barrels of crude in November, yielding $6.83 billion,
according to the State Oil Marketing Organization’s website.  Iraq, the third-largest producer among the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries, plans to boost output capacity
this year to 3.4 million barrels a day and export capacity to
2.6 million barrels, Oil Minister Abdul Kareem al-Luaibi said on
Jan. 18. Exports will benefit from four new offshore loading
facilities in the  Persian Gulf  that will go into service by
2013. Each can handle 850,000 barrels a day, he said.  The first mooring unit will start pumping oil for tankers
in the Persian Gulf on Jan. 27, the ministry said in an e-mailed
statement.  Revenue in December from the southern oil center of Basra
rose to $5.72 billion on 53.7 million barrels in exports, Jihad
said. Sales from the northern hub of Kirkuk were $1.34 million
on shipments of 12.8 million barrels, he said. The average price
of oil was $106.18 a barrel in December, Jihad said.  Petronas, Japex  Iraq has granted 15 oil and gas licenses since the 2003
U.S.-led invasion. The Oil Ministry plans a new round of
licenses for oil and natural-gas exploration on April 11-12.  The country holds the world’s fifth-largest crude deposits,
according to BP Plc data. Production is rising after stagnating
for years due to wars, economic sanctions and a lack of
investment.  Petroliam Nasional Bhd. (PET)  and  Japan Petroleum Exploration Co. (M1662) 
will start producing crude from the Gharraf oil field in
southern Iraq by September, said Sattar Mahdi, head of field
development. Gharraf will initially produce about 35,000 barrels
a day and will gradually increase capacity to 230,000 barrels a
day by 2017, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
