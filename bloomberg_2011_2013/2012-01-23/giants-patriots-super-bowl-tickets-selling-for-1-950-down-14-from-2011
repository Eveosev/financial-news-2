(Corrects face value of tickets in second paragraph.)  Tickets for the Super Bowl rematch
between the  New York Giants  and the  New England Patriots  are
selling for as much as $1,950 on the secondary market, a drop
from last year’s prices.  Sale prices for the  National Football League ’s championship
game this morning were down 13.7 percent from prices paid to get
into last year’s game between the  Green Bay Packers  and
Pittsburgh Steelers in  Dallas , according to  TiqIQ , an event
ticket aggregator that tracks listings from StubHub, EBay,
TicketNetwork and TicketsNow. The tickets have a face value of
$800 to $1,200, TiqIQ said, up from $600 to $1,200 last year.  This year’s title game is set for Feb. 5 in Indianapolis.  The average asking price on the secondary market is $4,054,
with the most expensive listing at $15,343 for a seat in Row 3,
Section 113 of Lucas Oil Stadium, Chris Matcovich, a spokesman
for TiqIQ said, in a telephone interview.  Most tickets are being sold in “zones,” or large areas of
similar seats, so it’s often difficult to determine exact
individual seat prices, he said. As the game approaches, ticket
prices may rise for individual buyers due to the lack of tickets
available.  “The Super Bowl has become so corporate, a lot of these
tickets don’t go to actual fans of the teams,” Matcovich said.
“There are only so many tickets available on the secondary
market.”  The current secondary market selling price is 41 percent
higher than the $1,378 ticket price for the 2010 game between
the  New Orleans Saints  and  Indianapolis Colts  in Miami. The
average asking price is 11 percent higher than the $3,650 price
asked for tickets a year ago, according to TiqIQ.  Giants’ Fans  Prices may also rise as New York fans seek to witness a
repeat of the 2008 championship, when the Giants upset the
undefeated Patriots as 12-point underdogs.  “Giants fans are pretty rabid and they travel pretty
well,” Matcovich said. “So I wouldn’t be surprised that people
will be willing to pay a high price to go to Indianapolis. If
you have income to spend, people are willing to spend anything
to go to this game.”  Along with individual seats, a suite with at least 25
tickets is currently being offered for $800,000, Matcovich said.  The Patriots, winners of 10 straight games, are favored by
three points against the Giants this year, oddsmakers said. The
Giants also were underdogs in their past two wins this
postseason, including yesterday’s 20-17 overtime victory over
the 49ers in  San Francisco  for the National Football Conference
championship.  Favorites Win  The oddsmakers’ favorite has won the  Super Bowl  73 percent
of the time, with victories in 33 of 45 games, according to RJ
Bell, founder of Las Vegas-based handicapping information
website Pregame.com. This year’s three-point spread indicates
the Patriots have a 59 percent chance to win, said Bell, who
estimates that more than $10 billion will be wagered on the
Super Bowl worldwide.  New  England , which won Super Bowl titles after the 2001,
2003 and 2004 seasons, is 15-3 this season after yesterday’s 23-
20 win against the  Baltimore Ravens  in the American Football
Conference championship game.  The Giants, who also have three Super Bowl victories, have
a 12-7 record, winning six of their last seven games, including
five in a row.  To contact the reporter on this story:
