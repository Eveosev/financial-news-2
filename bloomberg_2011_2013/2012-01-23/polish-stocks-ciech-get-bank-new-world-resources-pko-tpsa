or 0.2 percent, to 2,265.75 in Warsaw, rising for a sixth day.  The following were among the most active stocks on the
 Warsaw Stock Exchange  today. Stock symbols follow company names.  Ciech SA (CIE)   lost 1 percent to 18.82 zloty, the lowest

tumbling 6.6 percent to 24.2 zloty after the Czech Republic’s

percent from the previous quarter.  PKO Bank Polski SA (PKO)   climbed the most in three weeks
on a closing basis, gaining 2.6 percent to 34.16 zloty. Poland’s
largest lender expects profit to “stabilize” this year after
rising to a record in 2011, Chief Executive Officer Zbigniew
Jagiello said in an interview with PAP newswire.  Telekomunikacja Polska SA (TPS)   retreated for the first
time in four days, losing 1.7 percent to 17.6 zloty as the
