The New York Giants lead the  San
Francisco  49ers 10-7 at halftime of the National Football
Conference championship game.  Lawrence Tynes  kicked a 31-yard field goal with two seconds
left in the first half at San Francisco’s rainy Candlestick
Park. Bear Pascoe caught a 6-yard touchdown pass from Eli Manning for the Giants in the second quarter, while  Vernon Davis 
had a 73-yard touchdown reception for the 49ers.  The NFC champion will face the  New England Patriots  in the
Super Bowl on Feb. 5 in Indianapolis.  The Patriots beat the Baltimore Ravens 23-20 in the
American Football Conference championship game today in
Foxborough,  Massachusetts . The Patriots (15-3) held on for their
fifth Super Bowl appearance in 11 years as Baltimore’s Billy Cundiff missed a 32-yard field goal with 11 seconds left that
would have tied the game.  The Giants are seeking to reach the  Super Bowl  for the
first time since they upset the previously undefeated Patriots
17-14 after the 2007 season.  The 49ers made the last of their five Super Bowl
appearances -- all wins -- after the 1994 season.  San Francisco took a 7-0 lead on their second possession as
Davis caught a pass from Alex Smith down the right sideline and
outraced the Giants’ defense to the end zone. Davis, a tight
end, caught two touchdown passes in last week’s playoff victory
against the New Orleans Saints, including the game-winner with
nine seconds left.  The Giants also got a touchdown from their tight end to tie
the score with 11:21 left in second quarter. Pascoe’s first
career NFL touchdown came seven plays after Manning connected
with with Victor Cruz for a 36-yard completion on a 3rd-and-6
play.  Cruz had eight catches for 125 yards in the first half,
including four on the final drive of the half, to help set up
Tynes’s go-ahead field goal.  To contact the reporter on this story:
