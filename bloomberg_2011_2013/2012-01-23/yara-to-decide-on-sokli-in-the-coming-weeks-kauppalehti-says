Yara International ASA (YAR) , the
Norwegian fertilizer producer, will soon decide whether to
transport phosphate ore from Sokli, Finland for refining via
pipeline or train, Kauppalehti reported today.  Reports on both options to supply a refinery in Kovdor,
 Russia  will be finished in the coming weeks, said Eero Hemming,
Yaraâ€™s spokesman, according to the Helsinki-based newspaper.
Transporting the ore will be challenging due to temperatures
which drop as low as minus 45 degrees Celsius (minus 49 degrees
Fahrenheit), said  Kauppalehti .  Sokli is estimated to contain 120 million tons of rich 15-
percent phosphate ore, which would last for 20 years,
Kauppalehti said. Deposits of 4-percent ore may last as long as
100 years at the Lapland site, which could be operational in
2015 at the earliest, Kauppalehti reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
