Delta Air Lines Inc. (DAL)  sued the
Greenbrier luxury resort accusing it of failing to pay the
airline a guaranteed minimum to fly visitors to a nearby
airport.  Greenbrier had the case moved to federal court Jan. 18
after Delta sued on Dec. 19 in Fulton County Superior Court in
Atlanta, where the airline is based. Delta is asking for
$4 million and said in its complaint that it will draw on a
$1 million letter of credit until the resort meets its
obligations.  The  Greenbrier  guaranteed Delta a minimum payment to fly
guests from Atlanta and  New York  to the national landmark golf
resort in the mountains of  West Virginia , according to the
complaint. Delta said its revenue from the service was less than
what Greenbrier guaranteed under the contract.  “The parties recognize that there is an inherent risk that
the bookings on scheduled service may not be sufficient to
generate the minimum revenues required to avoid the payment of
the revenue guarantees,” Delta said. The resort was “willing
to assume that risk in order to induce Delta to enter into this
agreement,” according to the airline.  Barry Hunter, an attorney for the Greenbrier, had no
immediate comment on the lawsuit.  The case is Delta Air Lines Inc. v. Justice Family Group
LLC, 12-cv-00173, U.S. District Court, Northern District of
 Georgia  (Atlanta).  To contact the reporters on this story:
