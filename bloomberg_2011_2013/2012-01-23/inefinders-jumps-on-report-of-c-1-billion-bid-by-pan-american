Minefinders Corp. (MFL) , which operates
the Dolores gold and silver mine in Mexico, surged the most in
almost three years in Frankfurt trading after The Globe and Mail
reported it agreed a takeover of about C$1 billion ($988
million) by  Pan American Silver Corp. (PAA)   The accord, agreed yesterday, is expected to be announced
before trading starts in Toronto this morning, the newspaper
reported, without saying where it got the information.  Minefinders (MFX)  rallied 13 percent, its biggest one-day gain
since March 2009, to 9.988 euros by 10:47 a.m. in Frankfurt, the
highest since Nov. 16. The Vancouver-based company, which is
also building the La Bolsa operation in Mexico, closed at
C$11.50 in Toronto on Jan. 20, valuing it at C$954 million.  Pan American  Silver is the worldâ€™s second-largest primary
silver producer. It owns three mines in Peru. The stock closed
at C$25.02 in Toronto on Jan. 20.  To contact the reporter on this story:
