Related Cos., the developer of
 Manhattan ’s Time Warner Center, said it closed its first
distressed real estate fund after raising $825 million.  The fund is investing primarily in the debt on residential
and office properties in New York, Chicago,  Los Angeles ,  San
Francisco , Boston and Florida, according to Related President
Jeff Blau. The company began raising money for the fund last
January and exceeded its goal by $75 million, the New York-based
developer said in a statement.  Related’s strategy is to purchase distressed debt on
properties with the goal of taking ownership of the buildings
“through a consensual transaction,” according to  Joanna Rose ,
a spokeswoman. The company’s ability to handle construction,
sales, management, leasing and other real estate services on its
own will be a competitive advantage, Blau said.  “Our whole idea was to do all those deals that require
heavy execution where there’s less competition so pricing is
better,” he said today in a telephone interview. “From the
investor’s perspective, they know who is doing the work and they
have confidence in our abilities as an operator.”  Related has spent 25 percent of the fund, or about $200
million, Rose said. The fund has made investments in residential
properties including 111 West Wacker Drive in  Chicago , Oasis in
Fort Myers, Florida, and One Madison Park and 225 Rector Place
in Manhattan, according to the statement. It also acquired a New
York office building, 511-541 West 25th St.  To contact the reporter on this story:
