Carolina Panthers quarterback Cam
Newton will replace  Eli Manning  on the National Football
Conference Pro Bowl team.  Manning will skip the Jan. 29 all-star game because his New
York Giants will be preparing to take on the New England
Patriots in the Super Bowl a week later.  Newton, 21, the top pick in last yearâ€™s NFL draft, set a
rookie record with 4,051 passing yards for the 6-10 Panthers.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
