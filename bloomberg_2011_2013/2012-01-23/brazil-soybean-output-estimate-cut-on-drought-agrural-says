Soybean output in  Brazil , the
worldâ€™s second-largest producer after the U.S., will drop more
than expected after a drought parched crops in the southern
region, crop research firm AgRural Commodities Agricolas said.  Production will decline to 70.2 million metric tons from
75.3 million tons last year, AgRural said today in an e-mailed
statement. That compares with 73.1 million tons initially
expected, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
