Barry Callebaut AG (BARN)  rose the most in
more than two months in Zurich trading after signing an
agreement to supply Unilever with 70 percent of its cocoa and
chocolate requirements.  The accord will almost double the amount of cocoa and
chocolate that Zurich-based  Barry Callebaut , the world’s largest
maker of bulk chocolate, provides to Unilever, the companies
said today in a  statement . Financial details weren’t disclosed.  Barry Callebaut rose as much as 23.50 Swiss francs, or 2.7
percent, to 904.5 francs, the biggest intraday gain since Nov
16, and was up 1.4 percent at 11:19 a.m. The stock has gained 18
percent in the past 12 months.  The Swiss company said it will invest about 22 million
francs ($23.5 million) in the capacity needed to supply
Unilever, the world’s second-biggest consumer-goods company, and
will need about a year to increase volume. Barry Callebaut has
collaborated on the development of its London- and Rotterdam-
based partner’s Magnum ice-cream brand.  The agreement “is a positive sign for the overall
outsourcing trend and secures visibility of continued high
volume growth” in 2013 and 2014,  Claudia Lenz , an analyst at
Bank Vontobel in Zurich, wrote in a research note. The supply
contract may amount to about 30,000 tons a year, according to
Lenz, who has a “hold” recommendation on the stock.  Barry Callebaut sold its European consumer-products unit to
 Belgium ’s Baronie Group in September. The Swiss company will
also provide Baronie with 25,000 metric tons of liquid chocolate
each year and provide an additional supply of  cocoa beans  and
semi-finished products, it said in July.  To contact the reporter on this story:
