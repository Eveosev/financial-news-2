Peru’s benchmark  borrowing costs  in
dollars fell for a fourth day, heading for the longest streak of
declines in three months, as optimism European leaders will
contain the region’s debt crisis boosted demand for higher-
yielding assets.  The extra yield investors demand to own Peruvian  government
bonds  instead of U.S. Treasuries fell two basis points, or 0.02
percentage point, to 212 at 11:02 a.m. Lima time, according to
JPMorgan Chase & Co. The last time the spread narrowed for four
straight days was in mid-October.  European officials are crafting a long-term plan today to
tackle the region’s debt crisis as talks on a Greek debt swap
entered a second week. Negotiations on Greek debt are making
“tangible progress,” French Finance Minister  Francois Baroin 
told reporters in Paris. German Finance Minister  Wolfgang Schaeuble  said he’s confident the discussions will be completed.  “There’s been a improvement in risk appetite since the
beginning of the year,” said Felipe Hernandez, an analyst at
RBS Securities Inc. in  Stamford , Connecticut. “As the rally in
asset prices has extended over the last two weeks, funds and
investors on the sidelines with plenty of cash are starting to
react.”  The yield on the nation’s benchmark 7.84 percent sol-
denominated bond due August 2020 fell one basis point to 5.71
percent, according to prices compiled by Bloomberg.  The sol was little changed at 2.6910 per  U.S. dollar , from
2.6915 on Jan. 20, according to Deutsche Bank AG’s local unit.  To contact the reporter on this story:
