The first of four new Iraqi single-
point mooring facilities will start pumping oil for tankers in
the  Persian Gulf  on Jan. 27, the Oil Ministry said in an e-
mailed statement today.  The offshore facility was due to start operating on Jan.
25; the ministry decided to delay the inauguration ceremony in
Basra for a further two days, it said.  The government plans to install three more offshore loading
facilities in the Persian Gulf by 2013, Oil Minister Abdul Kareem al-Luaibi said Jan. 18. Each of them will add 850,000
barrels a day of capacity, he said.  Iraq , which holds the worldâ€™s fifth-largest crude deposits,
according BP Plc data, wants to raise production and exports to
promote economic growth. It has granted 15 oil and gas licenses
since the U.S.-led invasion in 2003 and plans a new round on
April 11-12.  To contact the reporter on this story:
