Gijima Group Ltd. (GIJ) , a South African
computer-services company, fell the most in a month in
Johannesburg trading after  South Africa ’s  anti-corruption agency 
started a probe into a government contract.  The stock declined as much as 6.3 percent to 60 cents, the
biggest drop on a closing-price basis since Dec. 22, as of 10:26
a.m. in Johannesburg. Gijima will cooperate with a probe by the
Public Protector into a 2.3 billion-rand ($290 million) contract
awarded to it by the Department of Home Affairs, the company
said in a statement.  Gijima executives learned from Johannesburg’s  City Press 
newspaper that the Public Protector is investigating the June
2008 contract, Chief Executive Officer Jonas Bogoshi said in the
statement. Centurion-based Gijima won an order to upgrade the
department’s information technology systems in 2007. The
department later canceled the contract, saying it was invalid,
and accused the company of corruption.  “This matter has already been settled between Gijima and
Department of Home Affairs in 2011, and all issues relating to
the contract have already been aired,” the company said.  Gijima reached a settlement agreement with the department
in December 2010.  To contact the reporter on this story:
