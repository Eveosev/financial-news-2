Erste Group Bank AG (EBS)  jumped the most
since May 2010 in Czech trading after  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) 
said the valuation of the Austrian lender’s shares relative to
its peers represents a buying opportunity.  The stock surged for an eighth day, the longest rally since
March 2009, rising 12 percent to 425 koruna at the 4:24 p.m.
close in Prague. Almost 1.4 million shares changed hands today,
or 269 percent of the three-month daily average. The  PX (PX)  index,
where the bank has a 21 percent weighting, rose 2.3 percent.  Erste’s eight-day, 34 percent rally still leaves the stock
down by more than half compared with a year ago. That’s cut the
price to 7.8 times expected earnings from 11 and lowered the
market value to 6.5 billion euros ($8.4 billion). The market
value of the Czech Republic’s  Komercni Banka AS (KOMB) , which last
traded at 10.2 times expected earnings, has declined 18 percent
in the past 12 months to 134.5 billion koruna ($6.9 billion).  “A valuation opportunity has arisen in our view, with
Erste’s total market cap now broadly similar to that of
Komercni,” Goldman analysts led by Heiner Luz in  New York  said
in a report to clients today. The U.S. bank kept its “buy”
rating on Erste shares, according to the report.  In Vienna, its home market, Erste shares last traded up 11
percent to 16.875 euros.  European stocks and the euro rallied as finance ministers
gathered in Brussels to discuss new budget rules and a Greek
debt swap. Bondholders negotiating the swap with  Greece  have
made their “maximum” offer, leaving it to the European Union
and International Monetary Fund to decide whether to accept the
deal, said  Charles Dallara , managing director of the Institute
of International Finance, who represents the private creditors.  “The financial sector has benefited from reports that
talks between the Greek government and its creditors on debt-
restructuring terms are successfully progressing,” Miroslav Adamkovic, an analyst at Prague-based Komercni Banka, wrote in a
report to clients today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
