AMR Corp. (AMR) ’s  American Airlines  will
take a $713 million non-cash charge to reduce the value of some
 Boeing Co. (BA)  757 aircraft and related assets as the carrier
reorganizes in bankruptcy.  American wrote down the value of the  planes  that fly in
domestic markets after reassessing a portion of its fleet for
planning purposes, the airline said today in a U.S. regulatory
filing.  Fort Worth , Texas-based AMR didn’t say how many of its
124 Boeing 757s were covered by the charge.  American said separately that it hasn’t decided the future
of its pension plans and assured workers that most of them would
continue to receive benefits even if the programs are frozen or
terminated in bankruptcy.  The future of AMR’s pensions has become a point of
contention since the company’s Nov. 29 bankruptcy filing, with
the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corp. saying about $1 billion in
benefits would be lost if all four plans are terminated. The
federal agency, which insures pensions, has asked the  bankruptcy
court  to order AMR to produce financial documents related to the
funds.  For workers who are vested in American’s defined-benefit
pension program, more than 90 percent would see no cut in
benefits accrued before the company filed for bankruptcy
protection if the plans are ended and payments begin at normal
retirement age, Jeff Brundage, senior vice president of human
resources, said in a letter to employees.  If the plans are frozen, current accrued pension benefits
wouldn’t be reduced, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
