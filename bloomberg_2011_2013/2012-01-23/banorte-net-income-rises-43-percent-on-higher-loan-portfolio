(Corrects Banorte’s ranking among Mexican lenders in first
paragraph.)  Grupo Financiero Banorte SAB (GFNORTEO) ,
Mexico’s third-largest lender, said fourth-quarter profit rose
43 percent as an acquisition boosted its loan portfolio.  Net income climbed to 2.51 billion pesos ($191 million)
from 1.76 billion pesos a year earlier, Banorte said today in an
e-mailed statement. That beat the 2.33 billion-peso average
estimate of five analysts polled by Bloomberg. Outstanding loans
gained 33 percent to 350 billion pesos.  The integration of Ixe Grupo Financiero SAB, acquired by
Banorte last year, helped boost the loan portfolio. Commercial
lending climbed 38 percent and business lending rose 34 percent,
the company said.  Banorte  shares  rose 2.3 percent to 51.96 pesos in Mexico
City trading today before the results were announced.  To contact the reporters on this story:
