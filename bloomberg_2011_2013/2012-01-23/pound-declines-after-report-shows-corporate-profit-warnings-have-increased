The pound fell after an industry
survey showed company profit alerts surged last quarter, adding
to signs the U.K. economy is losing momentum.  Sterling dropped against 12 of 16 major counterparts
tracked by Bloomberg amid speculation  Bank of England  minutes
this week will signal policy makers are leaning toward further
asset purchases, known as quantitative easing. The pound dropped
against the euro and gilt yields rose to a six-week high as
French Finance Minister  Francois Baroin  said negotiations on
Greek debt are making “tangible progress.” Thirty-year bonds
slid before a sale of 2052 bonds through banks this week.  “Recent data out of the U.K. is not encouraging, and the
latest survey on profit warnings doesn’t help,” said  Neil Jones , head of European hedge fund sales at Mizuho Corporate
Bank Ltd. in London. “People in the market are betting that the
Bank of England will soon expand its quantitative-easing program
and that would mean more sterling supply for the market” and
put pressure on the pound, he said.  The pound weakened 0.8 percent to 83.66 pence per euro at
5:01 p.m.  London  time. Sterling was little changed at 119.87 yen
and $1.5580.  The pound has depreciated 1.3 percent this year, according
to Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes, which track 10
developed-nation currencies. The dollar dropped 1.6 percent, and
the euro fell 0.9 percent.  Earnings Outlook  Profit alerts increased by more than 70 percent in the
final quarter of 2011 at U.K.-listed companies, the biggest jump
since the first three months of 2001, according to Ernst & Young
LLP. Retailers issued the most, 39 in 2011, more than the whole
of 2009 and 2010 combined.  The upward trend may continue this year if European finance
leaders don’t resolve the sovereign debt crisis or growth in
 China  slows or demand from the U.S. weakens, Alan Hudson, head
of Ernst & Young’s U.K. restructuring practice, said in a
statement.  Futures traders increased their bets that the British pound
will decline against the  U.S. dollar . The difference in the
number of wagers by  hedge funds  and other large speculators on a
decline in the pound compared with those on a gain -- so-called
net shorts -- was 41,634 on Jan. 17, compared with 35,853 a week
earlier, data from the Chicago-based Commodity Futures Trading
Commission showed.  Greece  Talks  Bondholders negotiating a debt swap with Greece have made
their “maximum” offer, leaving it to the European Union and
 International Monetary Fund  to decide whether to accept the
deal, said  Charles Dallara , managing director of the Washington-
based Institute of International Finance, who’s representing
private creditors in the talks.  Gilts dropped on speculation that an agreement on the debt
talks will be reached soon, damping demand for the relative
safety of AAA government bonds.  The  yield  on the 10-year gilt climbed five basis points, or
0.05 percentage point, to 2.16 percent, after reaching 2.20
percent, the most since Dec. 8. The 3.75 percent bond due
September 2021 fell 0.46 or 4.6 pounds per 1,000-pound face
amount, to 113.71. Two-year yields rose two basis points to 0.43
percent while 30-year gilt yields advanced four basis points to
3.16 percent.  Gilts handed investors a 0.7 percent loss this year,
compared with a decline of 0.6 percent on German  government
bonds , according to indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the
European Federation of Financial Analysts Societies.  To contact the reporter on this story:
