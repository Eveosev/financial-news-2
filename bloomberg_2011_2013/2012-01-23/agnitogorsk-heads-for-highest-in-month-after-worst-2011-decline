OAO Magnitogorsk Iron & Steel , which
sank the most among Russian steelmakers last year, headed for
its strongest level in more than a month as investors bet losses
were overdone.  The shares jumped as much as 2.3 percent and traded up 0.7
percent at 13.65 rubles as of 1:14 p.m. in Moscow, poised for
their best close since Dec. 8. Magnitogorsk sank 62 percent in
2011, while  OAO Severstal (CHMF)  and  OAO Novolipetsk Steel (NLMK)  dropped 27
percent and 55 percent, respectively. Magnitogorsk has gained 11
percent so far this year.  “Magnitogorsk lost more than any other Russian steelmaker
last year,”  George Buzhenitsa , an analyst at Deutsche Bank AG
said by phone today. “Now its value seems to start
recovering.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
