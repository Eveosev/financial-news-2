Five-time champion  Serena Williams 
lost in the fourth round of the Australian Open to 56th-ranked
Ekaterina Makarova, ending her 17-match winning run in
 Melbourne .  Williams, the No. 12 seed from the U.S., was beaten 6-2,
6-3 by the lowest-ranked female player to have reached the round
of 16 at this year’s tournament.  Williams, a 13-time Grand Slam singles champion, last
failed to reach the quarterfinals at Melbourne Park in 2006,
when she lost in the third round. She won back-to-back titles in
2009 and 2010 before missing last year’s event because of
injury.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
