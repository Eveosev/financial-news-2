Egypt  could save as much as $58
billion a year if it used state assets better and phased out
subsidies on energy and food over five years, Ahmed Heikal, the
chairman of  Citadel Capital SAE (CCAP) , wrote in the Financial Times.  $20 billion could be used for cash payments to qualified
welfare beneficiaries and $38 billion for health, education, job
creation and cutting the  budget deficit , Heikal said. Subsidies
are the main source of inequality in Egypt, he added.  To contact the reporter on this story:
