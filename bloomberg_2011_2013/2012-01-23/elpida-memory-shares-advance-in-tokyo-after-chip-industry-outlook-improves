Elpida Memory Inc. (6665) , the Japanese
chipmaker, rose to the highest in more than two weeks in Tokyo
trading after chip-related companies including  ASML Holding NV (ASML) 
said industry orders may increase.  Elpida rose to as much as 368 yen, the highest level for
the Tokyo-based company since Jan. 5, and traded 6.1 percent
higher at 366 yen as of 10:28 a.m. Japan’s benchmark Nikkei 225
Stock Average advanced 0.3 percent.  Investor sentiment on the chip industry improved as ASML,
Europe’s biggest maker of semiconductor equipment, and  Taiwan
Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (2330) , the world’s largest contract
manufacturer of chips, predicted a rebound in demand last week.  “Their announcements have been boosting optimism for the
chip sector,”  Toshihiko Matsuno , senior strategist at SMBC
Friend Securities Co. in Tokyo, said today by phone.  To contact the reporter on this story:
