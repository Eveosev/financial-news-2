Colombia ’s peso rose to a four-month
high amid gains in oil, the nation’s biggest export, and on
speculation European officials will advance plans to tackle the
region’s debt crisis.  The peso climbed 0.8 percent to 1,809.10 per  U.S. dollar  at
9:42 a.m. in Bogota, from 1,823.90 on Jan. 20. Earlier it
touched 1,808.85, its strongest level since Sept. 12. The peso
has jumped 7.2 percent in 2012, the best performance among all
currencies tracked by Bloomberg.  “There’s a lot of news expected to come out this week and
markets remain pretty optimistic,” said Camila Estrada, head
analyst at Bogota-based Helm Bank SA. “Gains in commodities are
also helping Latin American currencies” including the peso, she
said.  European Union finance ministers are meeting today in
Brussels to discuss new budget rules, a financial firewall to
protect indebted states and a Greek debt swap. French Finance
Minister  Francois Baroin  said negotiations between Greece and
its private creditors are making “tangible progress.”  Global leaders, including European Central Bank President
 Mario Draghi  and German Chancellor  Angela Merkel , will gather in
Davos, Switzerland, this week to discuss tackling the crisis
without depressing the economy.  Oil, which accounts for about 40 percent of Colombia’s
exports, rose as the EU announced a phased-in embargo of Iranian
crude in an effort to contain the Islamic Republic’s nuclear
program.  The yield on Colombia’s 10 percent bonds due in July 2024
was little changed at 7.38 percent, according to the stock
exchange. The bond’s price rose 0.035 centavo to 120.859
centavos per peso.  To contact the reporter on this story:
