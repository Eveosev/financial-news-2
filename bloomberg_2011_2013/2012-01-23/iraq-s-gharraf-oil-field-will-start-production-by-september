Petroliam Nasional Bhd. (PET)  and  Japan
Petroleum Exploration Co. (M1662)  will start producing crude from the
Gharraf oil field in southern  Iraq  by September, said Sattar
Mahdi, head of field development.  Gharraf will initially produce about 35,000 barrels a day
by the end of the third quarter of this year and will gradually
increase capacity to 230,000 barrels a day by 2017, Mahdi said
in an e-mailed statement from Baghdad today. The companies
recently drilled four wells in Gharraf and will drill another 13
in the next six months, he said.  The Iraqi government signed a contract with Petronas and
Japex in January 2010 to develop the Gharraf oil field. Iraq,
which holds the world’s fifth-largest crude deposits, according
BP Plc data, wants to raise production and exports to promote
economic growth. It has granted 15 oil and gas licenses since
the U.S.-led invasion in 2003, and plans a new round on April
11-12.  To contact the reporters on this story:
