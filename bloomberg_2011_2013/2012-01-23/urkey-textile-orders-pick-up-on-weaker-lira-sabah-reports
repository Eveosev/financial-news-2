Turkish textile producers’ order-
intake has risen by 20 percent as a weaker lira makes prices
more attractive and the crisis in  Europe  makes brands wary of
ordering large quantities of goods from Asia,  Sabah  reported.  The 12 biggest clothing brands with offices in  Turkey  will
place $5 billion of orders with Turkish producers this year,
including $1 billion from  Inditex SA (ITX) ’s Zara, the newspaper said,
citing Cem Negrin, the president of the Turkish Clothing
Industrialists’ Association.  Europe’s crisis has given Turkish producers an advantage
over Chinese competitors as European retailers seek more
flexibile production and smaller order sizes, Sabah said, citing
Turkish clothing exporters association chief Ismail Gulle.
Brands including Hennes & Mauritz and Next are in talks about
production in Turkey and the country may regain some of the
customers it’s lost since 2009, Sabah said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
