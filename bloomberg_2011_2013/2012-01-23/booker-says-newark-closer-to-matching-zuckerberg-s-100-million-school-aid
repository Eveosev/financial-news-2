Newark (9982MF)  Mayor  Cory Booker  said the
city is “about halfway” to matching a $100 million donation
from Facebook Inc. founder  Mark Zuckerberg  to schools in New
Jersey’s largest city.  “We are about halfway through that and I actually have
been working for the past weeks to get more of that matched,”
Booker said in an interview on Bloomberg Television in New York.
“We should see some pretty big amounts of other people stepping
up to match that money.”  Booker and donors such as William Ackman, founder and chief
executive officer of Pershing Square Capital Management LP, and
Ravenel Curry, co-founder of Eagle Capital Management, announced
in September 2010 they had raised $40 million to match the
grant.  The  district  of about 40,000 students is home to 38 of the
state’s 164 chronically failing schools. Booker and Governor
 Chris Christie , a Republican, have both said they favor
expanding charter schools and other measures to improve inner-
city education.  To contact the reporters on this story:
