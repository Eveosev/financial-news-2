German  Chancellor Angela Merkel  said
she doesn’t see any need for interim financing for  Greece 
because she expects the country to complete talks for a debt
swap on schedule.  “The question of a bridge loan isn’t on my agenda,”
Merkel told reporters in Berlin today. It’s “high time to work
on the new Greece program,” and the outcome of talks involving
European officials and the  International Monetary Fund  will be
known “very soon.”  “I expect that the negotiations with the private creditors
and the new Greece program can be completed simultaneously and
soon enough that no new bridge loan whatsoever will be needed,”
Merkel said in response to a reporter’s question at a news
conference with Belgian Prime Minister Elio di Rupo after the
two leaders met in Berlin.  To contact the reporter on this story:
