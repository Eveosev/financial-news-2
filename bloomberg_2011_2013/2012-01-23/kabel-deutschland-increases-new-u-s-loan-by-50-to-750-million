Kabel Deutschland Holding AG, (KD8) 
 Germany ’s largest cable television operator, said it increased
its new U.S. term loan by 50 percent to $750 million because of
“significant” demand from investors.  The seven-year loan was priced at 98.5 cents on the dollar
and pays interest of 3.25 percentage points more than the London
interbank offered rate, the Munich-based company said today in a
statement. The facility has a 1 percent Libor floor.  Kabel Deutschland  is also seeking lender approval by Feb. 1
to extend the maturities of its existing term loan A and term
loan C to March 2017 from 2014, according to the statement.
Loans designated A are sold primarily to banks, while C credits
are mainly bought by non-bank lenders.  Goldman Sachs Group Inc., BNP Paribas SA, Deutsche Bank AG,
JPMorgan Chase & Co., Morgan Stanley and Royal Bank of Scotland
Group Plc are managing the loan order book and the extension
request.  To contact the reporter on this story:
