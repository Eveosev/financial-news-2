The  New York Yankees  completed the
four-player trade with the  Seattle Mariners  to bring them right-
handed pitcher Michael Pineda.  The Yankees got Pineda and pitcher Jose Campos for 22-year-
old catcher Jesus Montero and pitcher Hector Noesi, 24.  Pineda, 23, was 9-10 with a 3.74 earned-run average in his
rookie season with the Mariners last season. He made 28 starts.  The agreement was reached a week ago, pending the players
passing physicals.  To contact the reporter on this story:
