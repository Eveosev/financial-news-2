Rockhopper Exploration Plc (RKH)  surged in
London trading following a report that  Anadarko Petroleum Corp. (APC) 
is in talks with the only company to have made a commercial oil
discovery off the Falkland Islands.  Rockhopper advanced 5.5 percent to 340.25 pence as of the
market close, the highest since February last year. The shares
have increased 43 percent in the past six months.  The Sunday Times reported yesterday that Anadarko, a U.S.-
based explorer, is in talks with Rockhopper that may lead to a
takeover of the company. Anadarko executives last week met
managers of the U.K. company, according to the report.  Patrick dâ€™Ancona, a spokesman for Rockhopper, declined to
comment, as did a spokesman for Anadarko.  Rockhopper Chairman Pierre Jungels said last month the
company has a range of options for the Sea Lion prospect and
that it will open a data room to seek partners. The company
needs about $2 billion to develop the find off the islands that
 Margaret Thatcher  went to war to keep British in 1982.  Desire Petroleum Plc, which owns acreage next to
Rockhopper, advanced 10 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
