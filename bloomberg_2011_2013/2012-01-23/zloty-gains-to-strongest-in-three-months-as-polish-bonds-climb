The zloty gained to its strongest in
more than three months against the euro and Polish  government
bonds  extended last week’s rally as optimism Greece will agree
to a debt swap boosted demand for riskier assets.  The Polish currency added 0.8 percent to 4.2805 by 5:15
p.m. in Warsaw. Bonds climbed, cutting five-year  yields  by three
basis points, or 0.03 percentage point, to 5.07 percent, the
lowest since Nov. 8, according to generic bond indexes compiled
by Bloomberg.  Global stocks and the euro rose as European Union finance
ministers gathered in Brussels to discuss new budget rules and a
Greek debt swap. Poland’s economy grew about 4.2 percent last
year and the “balance of risks” for the 2.5 percent forecast
this year is “positive,” Deputy Finance Minister  Ludwik
Kotecki  told PAP newswire today.  “Central European currencies today gained hand in hand
with the strengthening of the euro,”  Jan Vejmelek , an economist
at Komercni Banka in Prague, wrote in a report to clients. The
zloty “is also helped by comments from Deputy Finance Minister
Ludwik Kotecki, who said the Polish economy last year grew 4.2
percent, up from an earlier estimate of 4 percent.”  Bondholders negotiating the swap with Greece have made
their “maximum” offer, leaving it to the European Union and
International Monetary Fund to decide whether to accept the
deal,  Charles Dallara , managing director of the Institute of
International Finance, who represents the private creditors,
said today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
