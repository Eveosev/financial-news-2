Global Investment House KSCC (GLOBAL) , the
Kuwaiti investment bank that restructured $1.73 billion of debt
in 2009, cut about 17 percent of its workforce last week,
according to a person familiar with the matter.  Sixty employees were made redundant Jan. 19 as part of the
bank’s plans to restructure and cut operating costs, said the
person, who declined to be identified because the decision has
not been officially announced.  A company spokesman declined to comment when contacted by
Bloomberg News today. Al-Qabas newspaper  reported  the job cuts
on Jan. 20.  To contact the reporter on this story:
