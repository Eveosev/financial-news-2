Kazakhstan expects to reach an
agreement soon with the international partners in the Kashagan
oil field about expanding the project, Prime Minister Karim
Massimov said in an  interview  published today in Kommersant.  Negotiations on Kashagan’s second phase were slowed because
of parliamentary elections and the formation of a new cabinet
this month, and will resume now that Massimov has been
reappointed and Oil and Gas Minister Sauat Mynbayev kept his
post, the Russian newspaper said, citing the Kazakh premier.  Parliamentary elections were held Jan. 15, and the new
legislature expressed confidence in the government on Jan. 20.
Kashagan, once touted as the world’s biggest discovery in four
decades, is scheduled to start its first-phase production in
June 2013 “at the latest,” former Deputy Oil and Gas Minister
Lyazzat Kiinov said in December.  To contact the reporter on this story:
