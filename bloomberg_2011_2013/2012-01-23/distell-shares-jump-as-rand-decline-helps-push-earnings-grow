Distell Group Ltd. (DST)  jumped the most
in a month in Johannesburg trading as  South Africa ’s largest
wine and spirits producer said first-half earnings rose because
of higher sales and a declining rand.  Distell gained as much as 3.1 percent to 74.98 rand at 4:26
p.m., the biggest intraday advance since Dec. 28. That pared the
stock’s 12-month decline to 0.2 percent.  Earnings per share for the six months through December
probably rose by as much as 25 percent from a year earlier as
volume increased and rand fell against major currencies, the
Stellenbosch-based maker of  Bisquit cognac and Klipdrif brandy 
said in a statement today.  The currency of Africa’s biggest economy dropped by 22
percent against the dollar in the year through December,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
