J.C. Penney Co. (JCP) , run by  Apple Inc. (AAPL) ’s
former retail chief, is cutting seasonal employees and some
full-time jobs as part of a plan to overhaul the retailer.  Positions involved with re-ticketing merchandise are being
eliminated with the majority being seasonal workers, Rebecca
Winter, a spokeswoman for the Plano, Texas-based retailer, said
today in an e-mail. She declined to say how many would be cut.  Chief Executive Officer  Ron Johnson , who took over in
November, is reviewing products, pricing and promotional
strategies to revive sales. Earlier this month, J.C. Penney cut
its fourth-quarter profit forecast, citing declining sales and
deeper discounts than anticipated during the holiday season. The
company is scheduled to host a two-day event starting Jan. 25 in
 New York  to announce Johnson’s plans.  The New York Post reported the job cuts earlier today as
part of the chain’s plan to shift from traditional sales and
clearance events to everyday low prices, citing people it didn’t
name. Johnson is being encouraged to cut jobs by the company’s
largest shareholders, William Ackman and Steve Roth, the
newspaper said.  J.C. Penney  declined  0.3 percent to $34.97 at the close in
New York. The shares rose 8.8 percent last year.  To contact the reporters on this story:
