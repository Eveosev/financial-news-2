The Czech Republic’s  PX (PX)  stock index
climbed to its highest since Oct. 27, advancing 2.3 percent to
957 at its 4:28 p.m. close in Prague.  The following were among the most active equities in the
Czech market today. Stock symbols follow company names.  Erste Group Bank AG (EBS)   increased the most since May
2010 after Goldman Sachs Group Inc. said in a report today the
valuation of the Austrian lender’s shares represents a buying
opportunity. The stock jumped 12 percent to 425 koruna for an
eighth day of gains, the longest winning streak since March
2009.  New World Resources Plc (NWR)  , the biggest Czech coking-
coal producer, dropped from its highest in almost three months
after saying it cut first-quarter delivery prices of the fuel.
The shares slid 1.7 percent to 144.5 koruna.  To contact the reporter on this story:
