Trading (MVOLUSE)  in U.S. stocks fell to the
lowest level since at least 2008 amid mutual fund withdrawals
and Wall Street job cuts.  An average of  6.69 billion  shares changed hands on U.S.
exchanges in the 50 days ended Jan. 18, the fewest on record in
Bloomberg data starting three years ago that excludes over-the-
counter venues. On the  New York  Stock Exchange, volume has
tumbled to the lowest level since 1999, the data show.  The slowdown in trading shows that investors remain
skittish after five years of withdrawals from mutual funds that
buy U.S. equities and one of the most volatile years on record
for the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index. While the benchmark index
is having its best  January rally  since 1997, securities firms
around the world cut more than 200,000 jobs last year.  “Investor confidence is shaky at the very least,” Mark Turner, head of U.S. sales trading at Instinet Inc. in New York,
said in a telephone interview on Jan. 20. His firm handles about
4 percent of the total daily U.S. equity volume. “We need to
see the  U.S. economy  improve. We need to see some sort of a plan
in place to deal with  Europe ’s debt crisis before the market
gains some confidence. At that point, we’ll start to see an
increase in volume.”  Daily equity trading approached 12 billion shares in May
2009, near the start of a three-year  bull market  in which the
S&P 500 has almost doubled. The  total  is based on the 50-day
average volume on venues including those run by NYSE Euronext,
Nasdaq OMX Group Inc., Bats Global Markets Inc. and Direct Edge
Holdings LLC.  Share Value  This month’s 4.6 percent rise in the S&P 500 has failed to
offset the decline in volume. About 6.85 billion shares worth
$209.6 billion have  changed hands  each day this year, down 16
percent and 12 percent, respectively, from the same period in
2011, Bloomberg data show. The  S&P 500  rose to an almost six-
month high of 1,315.38 last week.  The  New York Stock Exchange (MVALNE)  has fared worst among the
biggest venues. Trading on the Big Board slumped to the lowest
level since 1999, with the 50-day average reaching 847.5 million
shares last week, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Based
on value traded, the average stood at $25.1 billion, a level not
seen since at least 2005.  On the Nasdaq Stock Market, the 50-day average dropped to
1.72 billion shares, the lowest in six years. Daily value of
stock transactions has been $45.1 billion, the lowest since
2010,  the data  show.  Biggest Venues  Trading is declining faster on the biggest venues, which
hosted almost all U.S. equity volume as recently as 2000,
following the spread of alternative venues such as  Jersey City ,
New Jersey-based Direct Edge and Bats in Lenexa,  Kansas . Direct
Edge and Bats now account for more than 20 percent of
transactions.  More than 40  equity venues , including electronic
communications networks such as Citigroup Inc.’s LavaFlow and
so-called dark pools such as Goldman Sachs Group Inc.’s Sigma X,
make up the American stock market today.  Individuals withdrew cash from mutual funds for a fifth
year and money managers suffered losses in 2011 amid widening
price swings. The S&P 500 moved 1.3 percent a day between April
and December, compared with 50-year average of 0.6 percent
before 2008.  They started pulling money in 2007, just as securities
related to subprime mortgages started to plunge, causing $2
trillion in global bank writedowns and losses tied to subprime
loans and spurring the worst  bear market  since the 1930s.
Withdrawals continued as concern  Greece  would default pushed the
Stoxx Europe 600 Index down 26 percent last year between Feb. 17
and Sept. 22.  ‘Not Willing’  “Investors are not willing to take a lot of risk,
especially after a bad year in 2011,” Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou,
a London-based analyst who studies fund flows at JPMorgan Chase
& Co., said in an e-mail.  While the S&P 500 was virtually unchanged last year,  55
stocks  lost more than 30 percent compared with a total of 13 in
the prior two. The  Dow Jones Industrial Average  alternated
between gains and losses of more than 400 points on four days
for the first time ever in August. Daily share swings in the S&P
500 averaged 2.2 percent that month, the most for any August
since 1932, Bloomberg data show.  Equity mutual funds focused on large companies had their
worst year since 1997, with only 17 percent beating the S&P 500
in 2011, data from Chicago-based Morningstar Inc. show.  Losing Money  Hedge funds , largely unregulated investment pools that aim
to make money whether markets rise or fall, lost 4.9 percent
last year, according to the Bloomberg aggregate  hedge-fund
index . Managers have cut leverage, or money borrowed for
trading, to 2.54 times this month, suggesting reduced
activities, according to a Jan. 17 note by Credit Suisse Group
AG. Leverage peaked in 2011 at above 2.7 in April, the firm
estimates.  Volume is decreasing even as  data  suggest the American
economy is recovering. Sales of previously owned U.S. homes rose
in December to the highest level since January 2011 and claims
for U.S. jobless benefits fell to the lowest level in almost
four years, reports showed last week. The economy is projected
to grow 2.3 percent this year, according to the median forecasts
from 72 economists surveyed by Bloomberg.  Decreasing volume threatens to curb the rally that has
added more than $700 billion to U.S. share values this year,
according to Brian Jacobsen of Wells Fargo Advantage Funds. The
S&P 500 has jumped 20 percent from a 2011 low in October.  Rational Decision  “Traders have rationally been sitting on their hands
knowing there are some pretty big events coming up that could
pull out the rug from underneath this rally,” Jacobsen, who
helps oversee about $219 billion as chief portfolio strategist
at Wells Fargo in  Menomonee Falls ,  Wisconsin , said in a Jan. 20
telephone interview. “With the low volume, it doesn’t give me a
lot of conviction.”  The slowdown has been worsened by cuts at banks that are
under regulatory pressure to reduce costs and curb risky trading
in the wake of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc.’s 2008 bankruptcy,
Jay Lefkowicz, a strategist at Concept Capital Markets LLC in
New York, said in a Jan. 19 phone interview.  Morgan Stanley, owner of the world’s largest brokerage,
said last month it plans to cut about 1,600 jobs. New York-based
WJB Capital Group Inc., with 100 employees, is shutting its
brokerage operation.  “You are taking players out of the game,” Lefkowicz said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
