U.S. Ambassador to the North
Atlantic Treaty Organization Ivo Daalder said international
navies will keep the  Strait of Hormuz  open in the face of
Iranian threats to close the shipping channel.  European Union foreign ministers agreed today to ban oil
imports from  Iran  starting July 1 as part of measures to ratchet
up the pressure on the nation’s nuclear program. Iran has
threatened to close the Strait of Hormuz, the Persian Gulf
passageway for about 20 percent of globally traded oil, if the
EU and the U.S. expand sanctions.  “I have not looked at the exact military contingency
plannings that there are and how long that would take,” Daalder
told BBC Radio 4’s “Today” show, asked about NATO’s capability
to keep the strait open. “But of this I am certain: the
international waterways that go through the Strait of Hormuz are
to be sailed by international navies including ours, the British
and the French and any other navy that needs to go through the
Gulf; and second, we will make sure that that happens under
every circumstance.”  U.S., British and French warships sailed as a group through
the strait “to underline the unwavering international
commitment to maintaining rights of passage under international
law,” the U.K. defense ministry said in an e-mailed statement
today.  “I am convinced that the Straits of Hormuz need to remain
open and that we need to maintain this as an international
passageway and we will do what needs to be done to ensure that
is the case,” Daalder told the  BBC .  To contact the reporter on this story:
