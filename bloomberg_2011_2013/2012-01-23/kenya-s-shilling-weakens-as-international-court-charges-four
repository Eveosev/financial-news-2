Kenya ’s shilling depreciated after
the  International Criminal Court  ruled that four Kenyans
including Finance Minister  Uhuru Kenyatta  will be tried at The
Hague on crimes against humanity.  The currency of East Africa’s biggest economy weakened as
much as 0.9 percent to 86.85 per dollar and traded 0.1 percent
lower at 86.13 at 4:34 p.m. in Nairobi, falling for a second
day.  “The weakening of the shilling is tied to market
nervousness over the ruling by the international criminal court,
with buyers seeking to buy dollars in advance,” Duncan Kinuthia
a dealer at Nairobi-based Commercial Bank of Africa Ltd., said
in a phone interview today.  The court in The Hague ordered the Kenyans, including
Kenyatta and fellow presidential candidate  William Ruto , to face
charges related to post-election violence in 2008.  Francis Muthaura, the 65-year-old head of Kenya’s civil
service, and radio presenter Joshua Arap Sang, 36, will also go
on trial as suspected perpetrators of the clashes, Presiding
Judge Ekaterina Trendafilova told the court today in a 2-1
decision.  The clashes killed 1,500 people and displaced 300,000 in
East Africa’s largest economy.  Tanzania’s shilling weakened for the first time in four
days on increased dollar demand from oil importers.  The currency of the second-largest East African economy
depreciated 1.1 percent to 1,602.10 per dollar and was trading
0.6 percent lower at 1,595 at 4:04 p.m. in the capital Dar es
Salaam.  “We have seen demand coming in from oil importers today
and that explains depreciation of the shilling today,” Eric
Chijoriga, a trader with National Bank of Commerce, ABSA Group’s
Tanzanian unit, said by phone from  Dar es Salaam .  Uganda ’s currency strengthened for a third day, gaining 0.4
percent to 2,383 at 4:04 p.m. in the capital Kampala.  To contact the reporter on this story:
