OAO Lukoil (LKOH) ,  Russia ’s second-largest
oil producer, expects to invest about $1.3 billion from 2012 to
2022 in its Arctic venture with  OAO Bashneft (BANE) .  Lukoil, which in December bought a 25 percent stake in the
project to develop the Trebs and Titov oil fields in northern
Russia from Bashneft, expects the deposits to produce 228
million barrels of crude over the next decade, Deputy Chief
Executive Officer  Leonid Fedun  said today on a conference call.  The infrastructure developed at Trebs and Titov will help
Lukoil develop its smaller licenses in the region, he said.  “Thanks to this project we can successfully start
production at fields located near Trebs and Titov,” Fedun said.
“There are several that on their own, without the
infrastructure that will be created, would be inaccessible.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
