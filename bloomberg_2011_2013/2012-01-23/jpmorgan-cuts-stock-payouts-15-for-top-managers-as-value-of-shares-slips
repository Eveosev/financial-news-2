JPMorgan Chase & Co. , the biggest
and most profitable U.S. bank, cut the stock awarded to Chief
Executive Officer  Jamie Dimon ’s operating committee 15 percent
as the value of the firm’s shares fell.  Dimon’s top 13 executives collected $60.9 million in
restricted shares plus  stock options  for their performance in
2011, according to regulatory filings. That compares with $71.4
million of stock granted to 14 people who served on the
committee in 2010.  The restricted stock averaged $4.7 million per executive as
of the Jan. 18 award date, compared with $5.1 million a year
earlier when New York-based JPMorgan’s shares were higher.  The reductions show JPMorgan’s top managers aren’t immune
from pay cuts being felt across  Wall Street , said Frank Glassner, chief executive officer of  Veritas Executive
Compensation Consultants  in  San Francisco .  Morgan Stanley is cutting pay for senior investment bankers
and traders an average of 20 percent to 30 percent, people with
knowledge of the decision said last week. Goldman Sachs Group
Inc. reduced its compensation and benefits expense 21 percent to
$12.2 billion in 2011 as revenue slid 26 percent.  JPMorgan fell 22 percent in 2011, outperforming the 25
percent decline in the KBW Bank Index. Goldman Sachs and Morgan
Stanley, both based in  New York , dropped more than 40 percent.  Dimon, whose 2011 pay held steady at about $23 million,
shrank the size of his operating committee by one as Jay Mandelbaum and  Heidi Miller  stepped down to pursue other
interests.  Charlie Scharf , the former retail division CEO, was
removed in June when his duties were reassigned and he was
transferred to the private-equity unit.  Petno, Hogan  Doug Petno, who now runs commercial banking, and John Hogan, Dimon’s new chief risk officer, joined the committee when
they were promoted.  JPMorgan’s board increased restricted shares awarded to the
committee to 1.71 million from 1.63 million in 2010 and boosted
options to 2.05 million from 1.62 million, filings show.  Restricted shares encourage executives to stay at a firm
while minimizing the chances of their compensation being wiped
out, Glassner said. Options, which let executives buy shares at
pre-set prices, are riskier because they can lose all value if
the stock falls.  The following table shows stock awards for Dimon’s current
operating committee and the value of their restricted stock
based on the average price on the dates the grants were made.  To contact the reporter on this story:
