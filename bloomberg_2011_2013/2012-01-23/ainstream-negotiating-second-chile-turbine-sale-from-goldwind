Mainstream Renewable Power Ltd., an
Irish developer, may use turbines from  Xinjiang Goldwind Science
& Technology Co. (2208)  at a 240-megawatt wind farm it’s building in
northern Chile, its second project in the country to use
equipment from the Chinese supplier.  Mainstream may complete the deal by March, Jose Ignacio
Escobar, general manager at the Dublin-based company’s Chile
office, said today in a telephone interview. Mainstream received
approval for the Ckani wind farm in the Antofagasta region last
year.  Mainstream agreed in December to buy 23 of Goldwind’s GW87
1.5-megawatt turbines for its Negrete Cuel project in central
Chile.  To contact the reporter on this story:
