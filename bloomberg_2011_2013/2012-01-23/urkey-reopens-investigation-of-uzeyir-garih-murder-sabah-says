president of  Alarko Holding AS (ALARK) , Sabah newspaper  reported .  The inquiry will be led by the special prosecutor who is in
charge of probes into alleged coup plots against Prime Minister
 Recep Tayyip Erdogan , the newspaper said, without specifying how
it got the information. The Garih investigation will be
