Patrick Cescau, the former chief
executive officer of Unilever, became the third  Tesco Plc (TSCO) 
director to buy shares in the U.K.’s biggest supermarket owner
since the grocer trimmed profit estimates this month.  Cescau, who became a non-executive director of Tesco in
February 2009, purchased 18,340 shares on Jan. 20, the Cheshunt,
England-based company said today in a statement. Fellow non-
executive Ken Hydon bought 30,000 shares last week, while
Chairman Richard Broadbent acquired 30,149 on Jan. 12.  Tesco  shares  fell the most since at least 1988 on Jan. 12
after the retailer said full-year profit will be at the “low
end” of estimates, while next year will see “minimal” growth
in earnings. The announcement raised concern that competitors
will continue to eat into the company’s 30 percent share of the
U.K. grocery market with promotions and fresh food offers.  Moody’s Investors Service said Jan. 20 it has begun
reviewing whether to downgrade Tesco’s A3 long-term senior
unsecured rating. The retailer has had the fourth-lowest
investment-grade rating at Moody’s since July 30, 2008.  To contact the reporter on this story:
