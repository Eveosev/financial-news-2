Impala Platinum Holdings Ltd. (IMP)  fell
for the first time in three days after saying about 5,000 rock-
drill operators stopped work at its Rustenburg operation, the
world’s biggest platinum group metals mine.  The second-largest platinum producer dropped 1.1 percent to
176.01 rand by the close of trading in Johannesburg. The
stoppage began on Jan. 20 and is related to salary grievances,
the Johannesburg-based mining company said in a statement today.
Larger rival Anglo American Platinum Ltd. rose 0.6 percent.  “A court order has declared the strike illegal and the
company will follow due legal process with all employees who do
not report for duty on Tuesday,” the company said.  Impala Platinum agreed a wage deal with  South Africa ’s
National Union of Mineworkers that will see pay increased by as
much as 10 percent,  Bob Gilmour , a company spokesman, said on
Oct. 7.  Inflation (SACPIYOY)  in the country, the continent’s biggest
economy, was 6.1 percent in December, matching the previous
month’s reading, the highest since January 2010.  Gross platinum output declined 12 percent to 388,000 ounces
in the first quarter through September compared with a year
earlier, the company said on Nov. 17. Three workers died at the
company’s Rustenburg operation in the period.  To contact the reporter on this story:
