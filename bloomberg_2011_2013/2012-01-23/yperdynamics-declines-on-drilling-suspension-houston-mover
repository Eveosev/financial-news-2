Hyperdynamics Corp. (HDY) , an oil and
natural gas producer based in Houston, rebounded from an
intraday decline of 26 percent to close little changed. The
shares fell after the company said it suspended drilling at a
well off the coast of  Guinea .  Hyperdynamics rose 1 cent to $3.41 at 4:15 p.m. on the New
York Stock Exchange after touching $2.52. The shares have
declined 38 percent in the past year.  The company said the suspension for equipment repair would
probably last a week. The well was drilled to a depth of 2,304
meters (7,559 feet), the company said.  Hyperdynamics is expected to release second-quarter
earnings on Feb. 14.  To contact the reporter on this story:
