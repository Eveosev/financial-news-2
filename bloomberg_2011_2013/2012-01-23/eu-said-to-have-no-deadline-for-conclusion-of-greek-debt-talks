The European Union has no deadline
for concluding negotiations with  Greece  and private bondholders
on details of a debt swap that was broadly agreed to in October,
according to two euro-region officials.  There is also no talk that the official sector might add
more public money to the deal, which aims to slice 100 billion
euros ($130 billion) from the 205 billion euros of privately
owned Greek debt, said the officials, who declined to be
identified because the discussions are private.  The failure to wrap up the debt-reduction accord over
the weekend helped drive Greek two-year yields to a record high
of 206 percent earlier today. While German Chancellor  Angela Merkel  said that the talks can be completed “soon enough” and
French Finance Minister  Francois Baroin  noted “tangible
progress,” neither of them specified a timetable.  The October deal calls for investors to accept a 50 percent
loss in the face value of their holdings. It includes 30 billion
euros of public money for incentives to encourage investors to
take part.  A formal offer on the terms of the voluntary debt swap is
due by Feb. 13, according to the Greek finance ministry.  To contact the reporters on this story:
