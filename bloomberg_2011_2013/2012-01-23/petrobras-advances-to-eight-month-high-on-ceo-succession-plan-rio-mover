Petroleo Brasileiro SA, the world’s
fifth-biggest oil producer by market value, rose to an eight-
month high on plans to replace its chief executive officer with
Maria das Gracas Foster, currently head of the natural-gas and
energy division.  Petrobras (PETR4) , as the state-run  oil company  is known, surged
3.8 percent to 25.13 reais in  Sao Paulo , the highest since May
4. The benchmark Bovespa index rose 0.1 percent.  “The market seems relieved that Petrobras has not been
subject to political whims, but rather has chosen a career
employee with technical skill to be CEO,” Christopher Palmer,
who helps manage $2.5 billion of assets as director of global
emerging markets for Henderson Global Investors Ltd., said in a
e-mailed response to questions today. “This indicates that
execution of projects is now a top priority.”  Foster, 58, will be nominated to replace Jose Sergio Gabrielli, 62, in a Feb. 9 board meeting, Petrobras said in a
regulatory statement today. She will be nominated for the
position by Petrobras chairman and Finance Minister  Guido Mantega , according to the filing.  Gabrielli is departing to run for political office, Energy
Minister Edison Lobao told reporters today, without elaborating.  To contact the reporter on this story:
