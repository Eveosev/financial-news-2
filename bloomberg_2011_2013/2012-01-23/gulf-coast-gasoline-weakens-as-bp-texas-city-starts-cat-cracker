Gulf Coast  gasoline weakened for a
fourth day after  BP Plc (BP)  started a fluid catalytic cracker at the
Texas City refinery in Texas.  The startup of the No. 1 FCCU may cause the plant to flare
gases through today, the company said in a Jan. 22 filing with
the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality.  The discount for conventional, 87-octane gasoline in the
 Gulf Coast (MOSGC87P)  widened 0.25 cent to 3.25 cents a gallon versus
futures traded on the  New York Mercantile Exchange  at 12:10
p.m., according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Prompt delivery
fell 0.49 cent to $2.7495 a gallon.  The Texas City refinery can process 475,000 barrels of
feedstock a day, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The catalytic cracker tripped offline at 11:23 a.m. Jan. 20
“due to the loss of a blower,” BP said in a separate filing
with the commission.  Chicago  gasoline weakened to the lowest level in almost
three years on rising inventories in the region.  The discount for conventional, 87-octane gasoline in
 Chicago (CHCG87PC)  increased 2 cents to 31 cents a gallon versus futures.
It’s the largest discount since March 4, 2008.  Gasoline inventories in the Midwest, known as the Padd 2
region, rose 2.3 percent last week to 54.7 million barrels, the
Energy Department reported yesterday. Supplies have climbed six
of the past seven weeks to the highest level since Feb. 25.  To contact the reporter on this story:
