Alpha Natural Resources Inc. (ANR)  and
 Patriot Coal Corp. (PCX)  were among U.S. miners of the fuel that rose
after Chesapeake Energy Corp., the country’s second-largest
natural-gas producer, said it would cut production.  Alpha gained 4.3 percent to $20.76 in New York. Patriot
jumped 7.3 percent and  James River Coal Co. (JRCC)  climbed 7.1 percent.  Investors see rising gas prices boosting sales of coal
burned by  utility companies  to generate electricity, said Lucas Pipes, an analyst at Brean Murray Carret & Co. in New York.  “Thermal coal comparatively looks a little better today,”
Pipes said in a telephone interview. Investors are betting “the
worst might be over” for coal producers, he said.  Natural-gas futures climbed as much as 10 percent after
Chesapeake said today it will “immediately curtail” 500
million cubic feet a day of output and reduce planned
investments in gas fields by 70 percent from 2011 levels.  To contact the reporter on this story:
