The U.S. Energy Department cut its
estimate for natural gas reserves in the Marcellus shale
formation by 66 percent, citing improved data on drilling and
production.  About 141 trillion cubic feet of gas can be recovered from
the Marcellus shale using current technology, down from the
previous estimate of 410 trillion, the department said today in
its  Annual Energy Outlook . About 482 trillion cubic feet can be
produced from shale basins across the U.S., down 42 percent from
827 trillion in last year’s outlook.  “Drilling in the Marcellus accelerated rapidly in 2010 and
2011, so that there is far more information available today than
a year ago,” the department said. The estimates represent
unproved technically recoverable gas. The daily rate of
Marcellus production doubled during 2011.  The estimated Marcellus reserves would meet U.S. gas demand
for about six years, using 2010  consumption  data, according to
the Energy Department, down from 17 years in the previous
outlook.  The Marcellus Shale is a rock formation stretching across
the U.S. Northeast, including  Pennsylvania  and New York. Shale
producers use a technique known as hydraulic fracturing, which
involves pumping water, sand and chemicals underground to
extract gas embedded in the rock.  Geological Data  The  U.S. Geological Survey  said in August that it would
reduce its estimate of undiscovered Marcellus Shale natural gas
by as much as 80 percent after an updated assessment by
government geologists.  Shale gas will probably account for 49 percent of total
U.S. dry gas production in 2035, up from 23 percent in 2010, the
Energy Department said today.  Gas’s share of electric power generation will increase to
27 percent in 2035 from 24 percent in 2010, the report showed.  The department also said the U.S. may become a net exporter
of liquefied natural gas in 2016 and a net exporter of natural
gas in 2021. U.S. LNG exports may start with a capacity of 1.1
billion cubic feet a day in 2016 and increase by an additional
1.1 billion cubic feet per day in 2019, the department said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
