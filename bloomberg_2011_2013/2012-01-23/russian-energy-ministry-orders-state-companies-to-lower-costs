Russia ’s Energy Ministry gave state-
owned energy companies, including the world’s largest gas
producer  OAO Gazprom (GAZP)  and the country’s leading oil company  OAO
Rosneft (ROSN) , a month to prepare cost-cutting plans.  The state companies were ordered to prepare a unified
system for accounting for the cost of goods and services and
measures of efficiency, the ministry said in a statement on its
website today, following a Jan. 20 meeting with ministry and
company officials. Management from Russia’s oil pipeline
operator  OAO Transneft (TRNFP) , overseas oil company  OAO Zarubezhneft (ZRNFT) 
and power grid operator Federal Grid Co. also attended the
meeting.  President  Dmitry Medvedev  last year ordered state energy
companies to reduce the annual average cost of a purchased good 
or service by 10 percent within three years, accounting for
inflation. Medvedev and Prime Minister  Vladimir Putin  are also
pushing state energy companies to disclose information about
offshore affiliates and managers’ incomes as they seek to fight
graft.  To contact the reporter on this story:
