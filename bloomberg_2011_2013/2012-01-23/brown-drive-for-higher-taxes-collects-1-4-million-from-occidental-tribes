  California (STOCA1)  Governor  Jerry Brown ’s
campaign for a ballot measure to bridge a deficit with higher
sales and income taxes collected $1.45 million from  Occidental
Petroleum Corp. (OXY) , American Indian gaming interests, hospitals and
a building-trades union, reports show.  Occidental, the fourth-largest U.S. oil producer by market
capitalization, gave $250,000 to support the voter initiative,
according to  reports  filed with the secretary of state as of
Jan. 21. The California Association of Hospitals and Health
Systems’ political arm gave $500,000, while that of the State
Building & Construction Trades Council of California contributed
$250,000. Indian tribes and gaming interests added $303,100, the
reports show.  If the campaign gathers enough signatures to qualify the
initiative for the November ballot, Brown would ask voters to
pass a temporary sales-tax increase to 7.75 percent from 7.25
percent, and to boost rates for individuals with annual incomes
of more than $1 million a year to 12.3 percent from 10.3
percent.  Melissa Schoeb, a spokeswoman for Los Angeles-based
Occidental, didn’t immediately respond to a telephone call
seeking comment on the company’s contribution.  Brown, a 73-year-old Democrat, is pitching his tax plan to
narrow a budget deficit of $9.2 billion. If voters reject the
proposal, Brown has said he would cut $4.8 billion from schools,
the equivalent of taking three weeks from the academic year.  To contact the reporters on this story:
