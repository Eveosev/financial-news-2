The U.S. will become a net exporter
of liquefied natural gas in 2016 as hydraulic fracturing boosts
domestic supplies, the Energy Information Administration said.  U.S. will sell abroad 1.1 billion cubic feet of  LNG (LNG)  a day
in 2016, and add 1.1 billion cubic feet three years later, the
agency said today in its annual forecast. The U.S. will also
sell more natural gas to  Mexico  via pipelines, according to the
agency, a part of the Energy Department.  “With supply growing faster than consumption over the next
decade, natural-gas production exceeds domestic consumption,”
Howard Gruenspecht, acting administrator for the Energy
Information Administration, said during a conference in
Washington. The surplus will be exported “primarily to Mexico
and overseas,” he said.  Cheniere Energy Inc. in May won Energy Department approval
to export natural gas as a liquid using ships.  Sempra Energy (SRE) ,
and Freeport LNG in partnership with  Macquarie Group Ltd. (MQG)  are
seeking similar export permits.  Manufacturers using natural gas, supported by Democrats
including Representative  Edward Markey  of Massachusetts and
Senator  Ron Wyden  of Oregon, oppose exports, citing concerns it
would raise prices at home.  Hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, is a process of
extracting natural gas from shale rock by injecting millions of
gallons of water mixed with chemicals. Fracking will boost gas
supply 20 percent to 26.1 trillion cubic feet in 2025, from 21.7
trillion cubic feet in 2010, according to the report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
