Columbia Laboratories Inc. fell the
most in almost five years after a panel advising U.S. regulators
didn’t back the company’s gel to prevent preterm births.  Columbia Labs (CBRX)  plunged 55 percent to 71 cents at the close
in  New York , the biggest one-day decline since February 2007.
The medicine, called Prochieve, is being developed with
Parsippany, New Jersey-based  Watson Pharmaceuticals Inc. (WPI)  Watson
 shares  fell 1.6 percent to $57.21.  The advisory panel to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration
voted at a Jan. 20 meeting that trial data didn’t prove the
progesterone gel prevented mid-trimester births in women with
short cervixes. The regulator is scheduled to decide whether to
approve the treatment by Feb. 26 and isn’t required to follow
the panel’s recommendations. The panel said a new study might be
needed before it could recommend the medicine.  “The path forward for Prochieve is highly uncertain,”
 Michael Tong , a senior analyst with Wells Fargo & Co. in New
York, said in a note to clients today. “We believe WPI could
even elect to terminate development of Prochieve,” he wrote.  Columbia, based in Livingston,  New Jersey , had  $45.7
million  in 2010 revenue, and has five products on the market,
according to its website. Columbia’s management had suggested
peak sales in preterm birth prevention may reach as high as $275
million, Tong said on Jan. 17.  To contact the reporter on this story:
