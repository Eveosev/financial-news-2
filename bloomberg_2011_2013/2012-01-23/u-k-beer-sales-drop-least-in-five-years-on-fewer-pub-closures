U.K. beer sales declined the least
in five years in 2011 as fewer pub closures offset the steepest
decline in sales at supermarkets in more than a decade.  The volume of beer sold fell 3.5 percent to 26 million
barrels, after 2010’s 3.8 percent drop, according to the  British
Beer and Pub Association . That’s 275.3 million pints, or 956,000
barrels, fewer than in 2010, Bloomberg calculations show.  So-called off-trade sales, or the amount of beer sold by
stores, declined 3.7 percent after rising 0.7 percent in 2010,
the association said. The drop was the steepest since at least
1998. Sales in pubs and bars, which represented 53 percent of
beer purchases, fell 3.4 percent, the least since 2004.  Government cuts to address a record budget deficit and weak
 consumer confidence  are weighing on beer sales, as is increased
competition from wine and spirits. Beer sales support about 1
million jobs and generate more than 8 billion pounds ($12.4
billion) in  tax revenue , according to the BBPA.  A barrel holds 164 liters of beer, or 288 pints, according
to the London-based  BBPA , which represents the U.K. brewing and
pub industry. Its members account for 96 percent of beer brewed
in the country and about half of Britain’s 51,500 pubs.  To contact the reporter on this story:
