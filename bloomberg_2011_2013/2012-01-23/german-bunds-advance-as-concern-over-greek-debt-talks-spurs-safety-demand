Italian and Spanish bonds gained,
outperforming bunds, on speculation European Union finance
ministers meeting today in Brussels will make progress on
measures to help resolve the region’s sovereign debt crisis.  Ten-year Italian  yields  dropped for a sixth day, falling to
the lowest level in more than six weeks, as European stocks
gained, increasing demand for higher-yielding assets. Greek 10-
year bonds advanced as French Finance Minister  Francois Baroin 
said talks between the nation and its private creditors were
moving forward. German 10-year bunds fell for a third day.  A possible Greek debt deal “and the EU meetings in the
evening, in combination is something that is giving some
positive sentiment to the market,” said Niels From, chief
analyst at Nordea Bank AB in Copenhagen. “We’ve seen bunds
under significant pressure.”  The 10-year Italian yield dropped 14 basis points, or 0.14
percentage point, to 6.11 percent at 4:49 p.m. London time, the
least since Dec. 8. The 5 percent bond due March 2022 advanced
0.965, or 9.65 euros per 1,000-euro ($1,304) face amount, to
92.38.  The extra yield investors demand to hold  Italy ’s 10-year
securities instead of German bunds, the region’s benchmark
securities, shrank 19 basis points to 413 basis points.  EU finance ministers are meeting to discuss new budget
rules, a financial firewall to protect indebted states and the
Greek debt swap, with leaders racing to put together a firm
rescue response in the coming weeks. The Greek negotiations in
 Athens  were making “tangible progress,” Baroin said at a press
conference in Paris.  EU Meeting  FT Deutschland reported that negotiators for  Greece  and the
 Institute of International Finance  broadly agreed on the terms
of a debt swap over the weekend. The deal on private-sector
involvement, or PSI, may be concluded in the next few hours, the
newspaper said.  “The market is quite binary; it has worked out that if
there isn’t a deal via the PSI there will be a default, so
there’s a lot of brinkmanship going on,”  Steven Major , global
head of fixed-income research at HSBC Holdings Plc in London,
said in an interview on Bloomberg Radio. “I don’t think that
you should believe too much in terms of the stories about there
being a default. It’s more like a negotiating tactic on behalf
of the Greek authorities.”  The Stoxx Europe 600  Index (SXXP)  of shares gained 0.5 percent.  German bunds underperformed most of their euro-area peers.
The extra yield investors receive for holding the 10-year
securities of Portugal,  Spain , Greece,  Belgium , Ireland,
 Finland ,  Austria  and the Netherlands instead of bunds declined.  Greek Bonds  The yield on the benchmark 10-year  bund  increased four
basis points to 1.97 percent.  Volatility on Greek debt was the highest in euro-area
markets today followed by  Portugal , according to measures of 10-
year bonds, two- and 10-year yield spreads and credit-default
swaps. The move in the spread was 6.9 times the 90-day average.  The yield on Greece’s benchmark 5.9 percent bonds maturing
in October 2022 fell 59 basis points to 33.57 percent, with the
price climbing to 21.10 percent of face value. The two-year note
yield dropped 1,199 basis points to 168.43 percent. It earlier
surged to a record 206.86 percent.  Portuguese 10-year bonds gained for the first time in four
days, with the yield dropping 40 basis points to 14.22 percent.
That narrowed the yield spread over bunds by 44 basis points to
12.24 percentage points.  Vigilantes Eye Portugal  “The market wants to believe in a positive outcome” from
the Greek talks, said  Matteo Regesta , a senior interest-rate
strategist at BNP Paribas SA in  London . “Portugal is
significantly tighter and that is the next market being closely
watched by the bond vigilantes because of the strong fundamental
problems it is currently facing.”  Greek debt returned 0.8 percent this year, while Italian
bonds made 3.3 percent, according to indexes compiled by
Bloomberg and the European Federation of Financial Analysts
Societies. German securities lost 0.6 percent after returning
9.7 percent last year.  French bonds declined as the nation auctioned 8.2 billion
euros of 91-, 168- and 350-day bills.  The 10-year yield gained six basis points to 3.14 percent,
while two-year yields were little changed at 0.81 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
