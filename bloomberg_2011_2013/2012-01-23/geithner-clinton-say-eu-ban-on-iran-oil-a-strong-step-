U.S. Treasury Secretary  Timothy F. Geithner  and Secretary of State  Hillary Clinton  said the
European Union’s agreement to ban oil imports from Iran and to
freeze assets of the Iranian central bank are a “strong step”
to “dramatically increase the pressure on Iran” and are
consistent with steps the U.S. has taken.  “Taken in combination with the many other sanctions on
Iran that continue to be implemented by the United States and
the international community, this new, concerted pressure will
sharpen the choice for Iran’s leaders and increase their cost of
defiance of basic international obligations,” Geithner and
Clinton said in a joint statement today.  To contact the reporters on this story:
