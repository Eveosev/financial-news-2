OAO Rosneft (ROSN)  increased proved
hydrocarbon reserves 16 percent last year, boosted by a
reassessment of its biggest  gas field , as well as high oil
prices and lower export duties.  Total reserves were 17.62 billion barrels of oil equivalent
as of Dec. 31, based on U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission
methodology, the Moscow-based company said today in a statement.
Proved oil reserves rose 3.9 percent to 14.29 billion barrels.  High prices and the government’s decision to lower the rate
of crude export duty in October allowed Rosneft to book reserves
that weren’t previously economical, said  Alexander Nazarov , an
oil and gas analyst at OAO Gazprombank.  Continued exploration at Rosneft’s Vankor field in East
Siberia may have also contributed, Nazarov said. “The more you
drill at a young field like Vankor, the more you explore, which
can lead to a reassessment of the field’s reserves,” he said.  Russia’s biggest oil producer replaced 162 percent of its
crude reserves last year. Gas reserves more than doubled,
Rosneft said, following a review of Kharampurskoye, its largest
field.  Rosneft reported 18.35 billion barrels of oil reserves,
according to Petroleum Resources Management System standards, up
from 18.11 billion barrels on the same basis the previous year.  SEC standards apply stricter commercial criteria to qualify
reserves as proven than more geologically oriented Petroleum
Resources standards.  To contact the reporter on this story:
