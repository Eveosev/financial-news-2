Canadian natural gas rose along with
New York futures after  Chesapeake Energy Corp. (CHK)  announced plans
to reduce production.  Alberta gas rose 6.9 percent after Oklahoma City-based
Chesapeake said it will pare production immediately by 500
million cubic feet a day and cut investment in gas fields this
year. The company accounts for about 9 percent of U.S. gas
output.  “It’s not the first company that’s come out and said they
would cut production,” said Eric Bickel, a natural gas analyst
at Summit Energy Services in Louisville,  Kentucky . “Chesapeake
is the largest so far.”  Alberta gas for February delivery rose 14.75 cents to
C$2.30 a gigajoule ($2.16 per million British thermal units) at
3:05 p.m. New York time on  NGX , a Canadian Internet market. NGX
 Alberta  gas has slipped 20 percent this month.  Gas traded on the exchange is shipped to users in  Canada 
and the U.S. and priced on TransCanada Corp.’s Alberta system.  Natural gas for February delivery on the  New York
Mercantile Exchange  rebounded from a 10-year low. It rose 18.2
cents, or 7.8 percent, to settle at $2.525 per million Btu.  Spot gas at the Alliance delivery point near  Chicago  jumped
20.97 cents, or 8.6 percent, to $2.6493 per million Btu on the
 Intercontinental Exchange . Alliance, an express line, can carry
1.5 billion cubic feet a day to the Midwest from western Canada.  Spot Prices  At the Kingsgate point on the border of  Idaho  and British
Columbia, gas rose 11.26 cents, or 4.7 percent, to $2.5312,
according to ICE. At Malin, Oregon, where Canadian gas is traded
for California markets, gas was up 14.7 cents, or 5.9 percent,
to $2.6311.  Volume on TransCanada’s Alberta system, which collects the
output of most of the nation’s gas wells, was 16.6 billion cubic
feet, 194 million below target.  Gas was flowing at a daily rate of 2.22 billion cubic feet
at Empress, Alberta. The fuel is transferred to TransCanada’s
main line at Empress.  At McNeil, Saskatchewan, where gas is transferred to the
Northern Border Pipeline for shipment to the Chicago area, the
daily flow rate was 2.16 billion cubic feet.  Available capacity on TransCanada’s British Columbia system
at Kingsgate was 312 million cubic feet. The system was forecast
to carry 1.71 billion cubic feet today, or 85 percent of its
capacity of 2.02 billion.  The volume on  Spectra Energy’s  British Columbia system,
which gathers the fuel in northeastern British Columbia for
delivery to Vancouver and the Pacific Northwest, totaled 3.09
billion cubic feet at 1:35 p.m.  To contact the reporter on this story:
