Science parks in Catalonia are
seeking to extend the maturity of 300 million euros ($387
million) of debt they may have difficulty paying back this year,
 La Vanguardia  reported today.  Catalonian authorities are already in negotiations with the
Spanish government, the scientific parksâ€™ biggest creditor, to
capitalize and extend the maturities of the debt, the newspaper
said, citing Josep Maria Martorell, general director for the
regional scientific center Recerca.  To contact the reporter on this story:
