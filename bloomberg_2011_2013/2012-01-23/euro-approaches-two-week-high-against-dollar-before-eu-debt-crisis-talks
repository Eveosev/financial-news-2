The euro approached its strongest
level in more than two weeks against the dollar before European
officials meet to push ahead with plans to tackle the region’s
debt crisis.  The 17-nation currency erased declines against the dollar
and the yen as European  stocks  advanced. It earlier weakened on
concern that Greece will struggle to reach an agreement with
creditors to ease its debt burden.  “The negotiations are continuing to focus the mind of the
market,” said Jeremy Stretch, head of currency strategy at
Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce in London. “It looks likely
that a deal will be cobbled together today.”  The euro was less than 0.1 percent higher at $1.2940 at
8:32 a.m. London time, after erasing a 0.6 percent drop. It
reached $1.2986 on Jan. 20, the highest level since Jan. 4. The
euro was also little changed at 99.69 yen.  To contact the reporter on this story:
