Central European Media Enterprises
Ltd. (CETV)  said 2011 Oibda, or operating income before depreciation
and amortization, rose 60 percent from a year ago, Chief
Executive Officer Adrian Sarbu told  Hospodarske Noviny  in an
interview.  The company has a “sufficient” liquidity of $200 million
in cash and a debt payment of $130 million due next year is not
a problem, Sarbu told the newspaper.  Sarbu’s recent stock sell-offs were linked with the needs
of his other private business activities, the executive added.  To contact the reporter on this story: Lenka Ponikelska in
