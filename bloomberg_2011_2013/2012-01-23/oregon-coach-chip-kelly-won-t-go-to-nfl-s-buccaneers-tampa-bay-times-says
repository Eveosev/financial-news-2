University of Oregon  coach Chip Kelly ended negotiations with the  Tampa Bay Buccaneers  and will
remain in college football, where he is 34-6 in three years with
the Ducks, the Tampa Bay Times reported today.  Kelly, who interviewed with the Buccaneers last week,
informed the National Football League team that he plans to
return to Oregon, the newspaper reported, citing Tampa Bay
General Manager Mark Dominik. The 48-year-old coach has led the
Ducks to three Bowl Championship Series postseason games in
three years as coach, including a 45-38 victory over the
 University of Wisconsin  in the  Rose Bowl  this month.  “His heart is with college football and Oregon and he’s no
longer being considered,” Dominik told the newspaper today.  Kelly and the NFL team were close to a deal yesterday, the
newspaper said. Buccaneers spokesman Jonathan Grella didn’t
immediately return a message left at his office seeking comment
on the Times’ report. Dave Williford, a spokesman for  Oregon ,
didn’t return an e-mail seeking comment on Kelly’s intentions.  Kelly served two years as the Ducks’ offensive coordinator
before being named coach prior to the 2009 season. Oregon has
finished in the top 10 in scoring each of the last three
seasons.  To contact the reporter on this story:
