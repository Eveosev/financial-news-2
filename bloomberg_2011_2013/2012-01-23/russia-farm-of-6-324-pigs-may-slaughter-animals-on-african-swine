(Corrects farm ownership in second paragraph.)  All of the 6,324 hogs at a private
farm in  Russia ’s southern Krasnodar region may be slaughtered
after African swine fever was found in some pigs there, the food
safety watchdog said in a statement today.  “All necessary measures are being taken,”
Rosselkhoznadzor, Russia’s federal food safety service, said in
the e-mailed statement. The farm in the Krasnoarmeisky district
is run by OOO Kolos. There are another 25,000 pigs on private
farms in the area, the watchdog said, without specifying if
other hogs would have to be slaughtered.  More than 30,000 pigs were killed at another farm in
Krasnodar region earlier this month, to deal with Russia’s
biggest ASF outbreak.  To contact the reporter on this story:
