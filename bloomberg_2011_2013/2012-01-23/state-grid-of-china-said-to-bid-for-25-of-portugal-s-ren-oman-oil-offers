State Grid International of  China 
offered to buy 25 percent of Portuguese power-grid operator REN-
 Redes Energeticas Nacionais (RENE)  SA, said two people with knowledge
of the potential deal. Oman Oil Co. separately made a bid for 15
percent of REN, one of the people said.  Portugal  is planning to sell as much as 40 percent of REN,
which runs the country’s electricity and gas grids, as a
condition for receiving an aid package from the European Union
and the  International Monetary Fund . Bidders were required to
put in proposals to buy between 5 percent and 25 percent. The
state owns 51 percent of REN.  An official at the  Finance Ministry  declined to comment.  State Grid, a unit of  China’s largest power distributor , is
offering about 2.90 euros a share for 25 percent of REN and Oman
Oil Co. is offering about 2.70 euros a share for 15 percent,
Portuguese newspaper Jornal de Negocios reported today.  State Grid offered a premium of more than 40 percent over
the Jan. 20 closing share price of 2.07 euros and Oman Oil
offered a premium of more than 30 percent, one of the people
familiar said.  REN rose as much as 4.8 percent and traded at 2.13 euros,
up 3 percent, at 2:10 p.m. in Lisbon, where the company is
based.  Oman Oil wasn’t immediately available to comment. An
external spokesman for State Grid declined to comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
