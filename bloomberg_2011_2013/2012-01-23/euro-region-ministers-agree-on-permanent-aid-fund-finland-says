Euro-area finance ministers
completed plans to set up a permanent rescue fund for the
region, according to  Finland ’s  Finance Ministry .  The ministers meeting in Brussels today agreed on all
aspects of the European Stability Mechanism in a deal to be
signed on Jan. 30, Martti Salmi, an aide at the Finance Ministry
in Helsinki, said by telephone after the ministry posted a
statement on its website containing some details.  Luxembourg Prime Minister  Jean-Claude Juncker , who chairs
the group of euro region finance ministers, will announce
further details of the agreement later today, Salmi said.  Under the new rules, majority voting can only be used to
authorize ESM loans and can’t be employed to increase countries’
liabilities, according to the Finnish statement. The agreement
will also allow for the creation of an emergency reserve fund
when a majority decision is taken, the statement said.  Finnish Finance Minister Jutta Urpilainen said on Dec. 9
that her country would refuse to back the fund if unanimous
decision making was eliminated.  To contact the reporter on this story:
