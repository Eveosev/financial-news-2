At least one ticket to the  Super
Bowl  rematch between the  New York Giants  and the  New England
Patriots  has sold for $11,883, according to the  National
Football League ’s official resale site.  The price is the highest so far for the Feb. 5 game at
Lucas Oil Stadium in Indianapolis for a secondary-market ticket
sold on the NFL Ticket Exchange, according to data released by
the company. The exchange didn’t disclose how many tickets have
been sold.  The average price for Super Bowl tickets sold on the
 website  is $4,183, about the same as for last year’s
championship game between the  Green Bay Packers  and Pittsburgh
Steelers, when sales averaged $4,140, according to a statement
from the exchange. Fans from Australia, Belgium and  Guam  are
among the buyers.  The average asking price on the secondary market is $4,054,
with the most expensive listing at $15,343 for a seat in Row 3,
Section 113, according to TiqIQ, an event ticket aggregator that
tracks listings from StubHub, EBay, TicketNetwork and
TicketsNow. The tickets have a face value of $800 to $1,200,
TiqIQ said, up from $600 to $1,200 last year.  Most tickets are being sold in “zones,” or large areas of
similar seats, so it’s often difficult to determine exact
individual seat prices, said Chris Matcovich, a spokesman for
TiqIQ. As the game approaches, ticket prices may rise for
individual buyers due to the lack of tickets available.  ‘So Corporate’  “The Super Bowl has become so corporate, a lot of these
tickets don’t go to actual fans of the teams,” Matcovich said.
“There are only so many tickets available on the secondary
market.”  There are 6,900 ticket listings from 15 different ticket
companies, according to FanSnap.com, a  Palo Alto , California-
based Internet search engine that compares prices at the 24
ticket-reselling websites that have seats.  Prices may also rise as New York fans seek to witness a
repeat of the 2008 championship, when the Giants upset the
undefeated Patriots 17-14 as 12-point underdogs.  “Giants fans are pretty rabid and they travel pretty
well,” Matcovich said. “So I wouldn’t be surprised that people
will be willing to pay a high price to go to Indianapolis. If
you have income to spend, people are willing to spend anything
to go to this game.”  Along with individual seats, a suite with at least 25
tickets is currently being offered for $800,000, Matcovich said.  Patriots Picked  The Patriots, winners of 10 straight games, are favored by
three points against the Giants this year, oddsmakers said. The
Giants also were underdogs in their past two wins this
postseason, including yesterday’s 20-17 overtime victory over
the 49ers in  San Francisco  for the National Football Conference
championship.  The oddsmakers’ favorite has won the Super Bowl 73 percent
of the time, with victories in 33 of 45 games, according to RJ
Bell, founder of Las Vegas-based handicapping information
website Pregame.com. This year’s three-point spread indicates
the Patriots have a 59 percent chance to win, said Bell, who
estimates that more than $10 billion will be wagered on the
Super Bowl worldwide.  New  England , which won Super Bowl titles after the 2001,
2003 and 2004 seasons, is 15-3 this season after yesterday’s 23-
20 win against the  Baltimore Ravens  in the American Football
Conference championship game.  The Giants, who also have three Super Bowl victories, have
a 12-7 record, winning six of their last seven games, including
five in a row.  To contact the reporters on this story:
