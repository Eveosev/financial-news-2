Canada and the U.S. have agreed to
extend their softwood lumber accord for two years, according to
two people familiar with the matter.  U.S. Trade Representative  Ron Kirk  and Canadian Trade
Minister Ed Fast will announce today in  Washington  that the
agreement will be extended to 2015, the people said on condition
they not be identified because the extension has been publicly
announced.  After two decades of legal fights and diplomatic discord
over Canadian lumber exports to the U.S., the two governments
negotiated an export-tax system in 2006 that includes limits on
Canadian subsidies to domestic lumber producers.  To contact the reporter on this story:
