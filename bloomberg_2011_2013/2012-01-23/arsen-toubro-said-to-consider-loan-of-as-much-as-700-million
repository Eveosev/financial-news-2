Larsen & Toubro Ltd .,  India â€™s
biggest engineering company, may borrow as much as $700 million
to fund a mass transit rail project in the southern city of
Hyderabad, according to a person with direct knowledge of the
matter.  The company, based in Mumbai, will determine whether to
seek the loan after  Hyderabad Metro Rail Ltd ., the planned
operator of the railway system, decides on importing coaches and
other fixed assets, the person said, asking not to be identified
because the details are private. The borrowing may have a
maturity of as much as 12 years, the person said.  Deepak Morada, a spokesman at Larsen & Toubro, declined to
comment when contacted on his mobile phone.  L&T Metro Rail Hyderabad, a unit of Larsen & Toubro, last
year began marketing a 114.8 billion rupee ($2.28 billion) loan
maturing in 2026, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The
rupee-denominated facility, arranged by  State Bank of India ,
offers an interest rate of 10.5 percent, the data show.  Larsen & Toubro has $4.95 billion of debt  due  by the end of
2025, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
