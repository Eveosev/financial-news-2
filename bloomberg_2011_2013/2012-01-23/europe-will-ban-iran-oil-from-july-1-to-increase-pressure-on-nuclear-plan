European Union foreign ministers
agreed to ban oil imports from  Iran  starting July 1 as part of
measures to ratchet up the pressure on the Persian Gulf nation’s
nuclear program, Dutch Foreign Minister Uri Rosenthal said.  “As of July 1, we have a ban on the import of oil and oil
products from Iran,” Rosenthal said in Brussels today. He said
the EU was looking at ways to help limit damage from the ban on
countries like  Greece  that are dependent on the oil imports from
Iran and that possible “compensation” would have to be decided
before the full ban comes into force.  Iran has threatened to close the Strait of Hormuz, the
Persian Gulf passageway for about 20 percent of globally traded
oil, if the EU and the U.S. impose stricter sanctions.  Saudi
Arabia , Iran,  Iraq , the United Arab Emirates, Qatar and Kuwait
ship crude and liquefied natural gas through the strait.  “We can keep the Strait of Hormuz open and we will do what
is necessary to achieve that,” Ivo Daalder, the U.S. ambassador
to NATO, said in a BBC Radio 4 interview today.  Brent oil for March settlement advanced as much as 59
cents, or 0.5 percent, to $110.45 a barrel on the London-based
ICE Futures Europe exchange. It was at $110.38 a barrel at 9:46
a.m. London time.  To contact the reporters on this story:
