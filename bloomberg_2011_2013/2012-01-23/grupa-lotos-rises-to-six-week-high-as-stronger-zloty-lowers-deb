Grupa Lotos SA (LTS) , Poland’s second-
largest oil refiner, jumped to a six-week high after a
strengthening zloty helped lower the company’s foreign-
denominated debt.  Lotos shares climbed 4.3 percent to 25.35 zloty at 5:13
p.m., the highest since Dec. 8 on an intraday basis, valuing the
company at 3 billion zloty ($911 million). The Polish currency
rose 0.8 percent against the euro to 4.2805, its strongest in
more than three months, after the country’s government bonds
extended last week’s rally.  “For months Lotos underperformed due to the weak zloty
because investors feared the company will pay significantly more
to manage its loans in currencies other than the zloty,” Tomasz
Kasowicz, an analyst at Warsaw-based Erste Group Bank AG, said
by phone today.  Lotos had a $1.5 billion loan on its books at the end of
June 2011, according to the company’s results for the first half
of 2011. Its total net debt as of June last year was 6.8 billion
zloty.  To contact the reporter on this story:
