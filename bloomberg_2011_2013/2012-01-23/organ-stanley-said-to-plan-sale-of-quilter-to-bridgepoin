Morgan Stanley (MS)  is in talks to sell
U.K. wealth manager Quilter Holdings Ltd. to buyout firm
Bridgepoint Capital Ltd., two people with knowledge of the plan
said.  An announcement is likely to be made this week, one of the
people said, declining to be identified as the transaction has
yet to be completed. Quilter has about 7.6 billion pounds ($11.8
billion) of funds under management and targets charities,
trusts, private clients and pension funds, according to its
 website .  Spokesmen for London-based Bridgepoint, Morgan Stanley and
Quilter declined to comment today. Sky News reported earlier
that Bridgepoint may beat competition from Permira Advisers LLP
to get control of Quilter for approximately 180 million pounds.
A spokesman for Permira wasnâ€™t immediately available to comment.  Quilter is owned by Morgan Stanley Smith Barney, the
brokerage joint venture between the New York-based firm and
 Citigroup Inc. (C)  Morgan Stanley, the sixth-biggest  U.S. bank  by
assets, bought control of the venture in 2009. Morgan Stanley is
seeking to sell the unit because the bank plans to focus on so-
called ultra-high-net-worth clients in  wealth management , one of
the people said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
