Larsen & Toubro Ltd .,  India ’s
biggest builder of power networks and airports, posted a better-
than-expected third-quarter profit as it won more projects and
boosted income from financial investments.  Net income  rose 18 percent to 9.92 billion rupees ($198
million) in the three months ended Dec. 31, from 8.41 billion
rupees a year earlier, the company said in a statement today.
That beat the 8.69 billion-rupee median of 23 analyst  estimates 
compiled by Bloomberg.  Larsen aims to boost  business  in the hydrocarbon and
infrastructure sectors in the  Middle East  and South East Asia as
higher costs and a slowing economy affect projects at home. The
company, which cut its order-book growth forecast in October, is
sticking to that projection as it hasn’t had any cancellations,
said R. Shankar Raman, chief financial officer.  “We’re going to see improvement in infrastructure starting
with softening of  interest rates ,” said Amit Srivastava, a
Mumbai-based analyst at Nirmal Bang Institutional Equities.
“It’s a good time for investing in infrastructure companies and
L&T is definitely in a better position.”  Growth in India’s  industrial production  slowed to 3.8
percent in the eight months to November, compared with 8.4
percent in the same period a year earlier, as the nation’s
central bank raised interest rates 13 times since March 2010.
The  Reserve Bank  of India will keep the repurchase rate at 8.5
percent at its review tomorrow, according to all 20 economists
polled in a Bloomberg News survey.  Financial Investments  Larsen rose 0.2 percent to 1,277.30 rupees, the highest
since Dec. 7, at the close in  Mumbai  trading, reversing an
earlier drop of as much as 3.8 percent. The benchmark Sensitive
Index gained 0.1 percent.  Larsen (LT)  slumped 50 percent in 2011.  Other income, including gains from financial investments,
during the quarter surged 79 percent to 4.49 billion rupees. New
contracts in the period gained 28 percent to 171 billion rupees,
Larsen said in the statement.  Sales in the quarter rose 23 percent to 140 billion rupees
and total order book reached 1.46 trillion rupees as of Dec. 31.
In the year ending March 31, sales may increase 25 percent,
Raman said at a press conference today.  The company, based in Mumbai, expects to win orders worth
300 billion rupees in the  fourth quarter , he said. Credit Suisse
Group AG said Jan. 4 that Larsen has to earn new orders worth
299 billion rupees in the period to meet its 5 percent order-
inflow growth guidance.  “The environment is getting challenging and the economy is
moving slowly,” Raman said. “So it’s going to be tough and
challenging to lift the order book.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
