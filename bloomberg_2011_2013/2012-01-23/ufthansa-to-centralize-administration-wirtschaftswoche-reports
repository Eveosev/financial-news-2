Deutsche Lufthansa AG (LHA)  will
centralize subsidiariesâ€™ information technology, purchasing,
auditing and human-resources departments in a 1.5 billion-euro
($1.93 billion) cost-saving plan, WirtschaftsWoche  reported ,
citing unidentified people at the carrier.  Chief Executive Officer Christoph Franz will present
details of the profit-improvement program, which will also
eliminate superfluous routes, to management on Feb. 6, the
magazine said.  The greatest effect will be on the purchasing abilities of
the Austrian Airlines, Swiss, Germanwings, Lufthansa Technik and
Lufthansa Cargo units, WirtschaftsWoche said.  Andreas Bartels, a spokesman for Cologne, Germany-based
Lufthansa, declined to comment on the report, saying the savings
program is still being evaluated.  To contact the reporter on this story:
