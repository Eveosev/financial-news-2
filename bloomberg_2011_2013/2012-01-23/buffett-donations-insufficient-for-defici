Warren Buffett , the billionaire who
promised to match lawmakers’ voluntary contributions to the U.S.
Treasury, said donations are insufficient to solve the budget
deficit.  “What is effective is changing the law,” Buffett told
Bloomberg Television’s Betty Liu in an interview today. Buffett,
a supporter of President Barack Obama, has called for lower
government spending and higher taxes on the wealthiest
residents.  To contact the reporter on this story:
