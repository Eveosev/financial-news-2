Helios, the hospital unit of
 Fresenius SE (FRE) , expects more industry privatization this year than
last year,  Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung  reported, citing
Francesco De Meo, head of the unit.  With one out of five German hospitals in debt,
privatization will be unavoidable even if the public is
skeptical about it, De Meo told the newspaper in an interview.  To contact the reporter on this story:
