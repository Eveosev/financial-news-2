The European Union threatened to
renew tariffs on  Dow Chemical Co. (DOW)  and other U.S. makers of
ethanolamines, a chemical used for detergents and textiles, to
limit competition for EU producers including  BASF SE. (BAS)   The EU said it would review whether to let lapse the duties
of as much as 111.25 euros ($144.60) a metric ton on imports
from the U.S. of the product, also used for herbicides and
cement. The 12-year-old levies punish U.S. exporters for selling
ethanolamines in  Europe  below cost, a practice known as dumping.  The current anti-dumping duties have been in force since
mid-2000 and were last renewed for two years in January 2010.
The levies range from 59.25 euros a ton for Dow Chemical to
111.25 euros a ton for manufacturers including  Huntsman Corp. (HUN)   The review “will determine whether the expiry of the
measures would be likely, or unlikely, to lead to a continuation
of dumping and a continuation of injury,” the European
Commission, the 27-nation EU’s trade authority in Brussels, said
on Jan. 21 in the  Official Journal . The duties were due to
expire today and will now stay in place during the probe, which
can last as long as 15 months.  BASF,  Sasol Germany GmbH  and Ineos Europe AG, which account
for more than half the EU’s production of ethanolamines, filed a
request on Oct. 21 for the expiry review, according to the
commission. The companies argued that an end of the duties would
probably lead to further dumping by U.S. competitors and injury
to the European industry, the commission said.  Market Share  The U.S. share of the EU ethanolamine market dropped to 14
percent in the 12 months through September 2008 from almost 24
percent in 2005, the bloc said when renewing the anti-dumping
duties two years ago. The combined European market share of
other exporting countries including  Russia ,  Mexico ,  Iran  and
 Taiwan  rose to more than 7 percent from about 4 percent over the
period, the EU said.  A different form of EU anti-dumping duties on U.S.
ethanolamines existed in the 1990s. The bloc introduced variable
levies based on minimum sales prices in 1994 and switched to the
current fixed-rate tariffs as part of a July 2000 decision to
maintain anti-dumping protection for five more years.  When the duties were due to lapse in July 2005, the EU
began an expiration investigation that led to an initial two-
year extension in October 2006. The subsequent two-year renewal
in January 2010 followed a 15-month probe that prevented the
levies from lapsing as previously scheduled in October 2008. The
two-year renewals were a concession to the U.S. industry and
European ethanolamine users because the EU normally extends such
measures for five years.  To contact the reporter on this story:
