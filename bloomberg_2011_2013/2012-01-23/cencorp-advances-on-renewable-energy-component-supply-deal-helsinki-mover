Cencorp Oyj (CNC1V) , the Finnish maker of
electronic equipment, climbed the most since April 2009 in
Helsinki trading as it won a 50 million-euro order ($64.7
million) to deliver components to the renewable  energy industry .  The stock gained 50 percent, or 0.04 euros, to 0.12 euros
at 10:35 a.m. in Helsinki today, rising to its highest in six
months. The share’s trading volume was more than 25 times the
three-month average.  The agreement has had a “significant” impact on the
development of its 2011 outlook, the Lohja, Finland-based
company said in a statement today. The share has gained 33
percent this year after falling 39 percent last year, giving it
a market value of 41.1 million euros.  “We have identified renewable energy applications as one
of our strategic growth areas,” Mats Eriksson, Chief Executive
Officer, said in the statement. The value of the framework
agreement on the delivery of flexible circuits for renewable
energy solutions may exceed 50 million euros over three years,
the company said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
