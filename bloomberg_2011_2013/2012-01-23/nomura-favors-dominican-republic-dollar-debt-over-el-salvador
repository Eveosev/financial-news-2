(Corrects to say investors should switch into  Dominican
Republic  bonds and out of El Salvador debt in second paragraph
of story originally published Jan. 23)  Nomura Securities Inc. recommends
buying Dominican Republic’s dollar bonds and selling securities
from El Salvador as the Caribbean country limits spending to
qualify for funding from the  International Monetary Fund .  Boris Segura , a New York-based strategist, advised
investors to switch into the Dominican Republic’s dollar bonds
due in 2021 and out of El Salvador bonds due in 2019, as the
yield gap between the securities may narrow.  Dominican Republic “authorities are likely to be careful
about putting further pressure on the external accounts by
running a lax fiscal policy in coming months,” Segura wrote in
a note to clients today.  The Dominican Republic has to reduce its fiscal deficit to
qualify for lending from the IMF, Segura said. Nomura forecasts
the fiscal deficit was 2.8 percent of gross domestic product in
2011, compared with a 1.6 percent target set by the IMF.  The yield on the 7.5 percent bonds from the Dominican
Republic fell 23 basis points, or 0.23 percentage points to 7.39
percent, the lowest in two months, at 3:33 p.m. New York time,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The yield on  El
Salvador ’s notes fell one basis point to 6.09 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
