Pan American Silver Corp. (PAA) , a miner
of the metal in  Latin America , agreed to buy Minefinders Corp.
for about C$1.5 billion ($1.49 billion) to expand production and
add reserves in Mexico.  Minefinders investors will get 0.55 of a Pan American share
and C$1.84 in cash, or 0.6235 of a share, or C$15.60 in cash,
the companies, both based in Vancouver, said today in a joint
statement. At C$15.60 a share, the offer represents a 36 percent
premium to Minefinders’ closing price on Jan. 20.  “This acquisition is logical and consistent with Pan
American’s vision to become the largest, low-cost primary
producer of silver in the world,” Pan American Chief Executive
Officer Geoff Burns said in the statement.  Minefinders owns the Dolores mine, which it plans to
expand, and the La Bolsa project, both in  Mexico . Pan American
has seven silver mines in Peru, Mexico,  Argentina  and Bolivia.  Minefinders directors and management holding 3.5 percent of
the company’s shares have entered into voting agreements to
support the deal, the companies said.  Shares of Minefinders rose 27 percent to C$14.59 as of 8:41
a.m. in Toronto.  Pan American’s financial adviser on the deal is CIBC World
Markets Inc. Scotia Capital provided a fairness opinion to the
company’s board of directors. Minefinders’ financial adviser is
BMO Capital Markets.  To contact the reporter on this story:
