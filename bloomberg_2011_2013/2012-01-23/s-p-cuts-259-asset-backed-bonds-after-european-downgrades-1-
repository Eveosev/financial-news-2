Standard & Poor’s  downgraded 259
European asset-backed securities after the New York-based
ratings firm cut the ranking of countries including France,
Italy and  Spain .  S&P cut 159 bonds backed by Italian loans, 81 tied to
Portuguese assets, 17 linked to French borrowers and two on
Spanish debt, it said in a statement today.  Banks create asset-backed securities by pooling home and
consumer loans and selling them to investors as notes with
varying ratings and returns. The bonds’ rankings can’t be more
than six steps higher than the sovereign rating if the country
is investment grade, or five levels for speculative-grade
nations, according to S&P.  “Following the rating actions that we took on 16 eurozone
sovereigns on Jan. 13, 2012, the maximum structured finance
ratings that we would assign under our criteria have changed for
Italy and  Portugal ,” S&P said in the statement.  Italy’s credit rating was cut two levels to BBB+ by S&P
this month, while Portugal was downgraded to junk status.  S&P confirmed ratings on 81 portions packaging assets
exposed to Belgium,  Germany , Ireland and the Netherlands.  To contact the reporter on this story:
