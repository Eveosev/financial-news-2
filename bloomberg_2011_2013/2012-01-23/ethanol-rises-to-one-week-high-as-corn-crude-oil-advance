Ethanol futures rose to the highest
price in more than a week in  Chicago  as corn and crude oil each
gained on supply concerns.  Futures increased a third day as corn, the primary
ingredient used to make the biofuel in the U.S., climbed on
speculation that inclement weather damaged crops in  South
America  and as oil jumped after the European Union agreed to ban
imports from  Iran .  “Corn and crude were both up,” said Matt Janney, a trader
at Citigroup Global Markets Inc. in Chicago. “Everyone’s
watching the weather in South America right now.”  Denatured ethanol for February delivery advanced 2.1 cents,
or 1 percent, to $2.153 a gallon on the Chicago Board of Trade.
Prices have fallen 7.7 percent in the past year.  In cash market trading, ethanol in  New York  gained 3 cents,
or 1.4 percent, to $2.24 a gallon and in the U.S. Gulf the
additive climbed 1.5 cents, or 0.7 percent, to $2.21, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Ethanol on the West Coast added 1.5 cents, or 0.7 percent,
to $2.23 a gallon and in Chicago the biofuel rose 1 cent, or 0.5
percent, to $2.11.  Corn for March delivery increased 8.5 cents, or 1.4
percent, to $6.20 a bushel in Chicago. One bushel makes at least
2.75 gallons of ethanol.  Oil for March delivery climbed $1.25, or 1.3 percent, to
settle at $99.58 a barrel on the  New York Mercantile Exchange .
Prices have increased 12 percent in the past year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
