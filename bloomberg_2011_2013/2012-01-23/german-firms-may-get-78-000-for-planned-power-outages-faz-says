Large German industrial users may be
reimbursed by as much as 60,000 euros ($78,072) a year for
agreeing to have their electricity shut off if necessary,
 Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung  reported, without saying where it
got the information.  The economy ministry estimates the cost of the program
wonâ€™t exceed 102 million euros per year, the newspaper said in
an e-mailed preview of an article to be published tomorrow.  To contact the reporter on this story:
