Ukraineâ€™s  economic growth  slowed to
4.2 percent from a year earlier in the last three months of 2011
as production of export products such as metals and chemicals
fell amid dwindling foreign demand, the central bank said.  The economy probably expanded about 5 percent during the
whole of last year, the regulator, based in the capital, Kiev,
said today in a  statement  on its website.  Gross domestic product grew 6.6 percent from a year earlier
in the third quarter, according to data from the state
statistics service.  To contact the reporter on this story:
