Serbia will probably hold
parliamentary elections on May 6 after the ruling coalition
completes its four-year term in office,  Vecernje Novosti 
reported, citing Parliament Speaker Slavica Djukic-Dejanovic.  President  Boris Tadic  will announce the election date on
March 11, allowing less than two months of campaigning before
the ballot, according to the Belgrade-based newspaper. Municipal
elections across the country will be held on the same day, it
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
