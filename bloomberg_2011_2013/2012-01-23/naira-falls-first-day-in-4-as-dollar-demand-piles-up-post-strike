The naira weakened for the first
time in four days amid concern the accumulated demand for
dollars in the aftermath of a nationwide strike won’t be met and
after the central bank’s marginal rate declined at a currency
auction.  The naira declined 0.2 percent to 161.320 per dollar by
3:30 p.m., according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Nigeria ’s
central bank sold $250 million today with the marginal rate,
also used as the prevailing exchange rate, falling 0.1 percent
to 157 naira compared with 156.85 naira at a previous foreign-
currency sale on Jan. 18, the bank said in an e-mailed
statement.  Labor unions in  Africa ’s biggest oil producer began a
nationwide strike on Jan. 9, which limited trading in
currencies, shut banks, businesses and ports after the
government scrapped fuel subsidies on Jan. 1. Gasoline prices
more than doubled from 65 naira ($0.40) a liter after cutbacks
were announced. The workers suspended industrial action on Jan.
16 after President  Goodluck Jonathan  restricted gasoline-price
increases to 97 naira a liter (0.3 gallon).  “There are fears the central bank will not be able to
clear the foreign exchange demand that piled up during the
strike,” Tunde Ladipo, chief executive officer of Valuechain
Investment Ltd., said by phone today. “Retaining the subsidy,
even by a half, might affect reserves and the ability of the
central bank to intervene in the market.”  Ghana ’s cedi rose for a second day, advancing 0.5 percent
to 1.6971 per dollar as of 3:40 p.m. in Accra, the capital,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
