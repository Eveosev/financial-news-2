Dividends in the U.K. increased to a
record 67.8 billion pounds ($105.6 billion) in 2011, surpassing
their previous high in 2008, as BP Plc resumed payments and
mining companies boosted theirs.  Payouts by British companies to shareholders climbed for
the first full year since 2008 as dividends advanced in all four
quarters, increasing 19 percent from 2010 to set a nominal
payout record, Capita Registrars said in an e-mailed statement
today, citing data from Exchange Data International.  BP Plc paid 3.6 billion pounds in 2011 as  Europe’s second-
biggest oil producer  resumed its dividends. The international
 oil company  paid out 1.8 billion pounds more last year than it
did in 2010, accounting for one-sixth of the total increase in
dividend payments by U.K. companies, Capita said. BP canceled
its payouts in 2010 after the blowout of its Macondo well in the
 Gulf of Mexico  led to the world’s largest accidental oil spill.  “Record dividends are providing a real bright spot for
investors against a very gloomy backdrop of crisis in the  euro
zone  and a stalling economic recovery in the U.K.,” Charles Cryer, chief executive officer of Capita Registrars, said in a
statement. “Expanding dividends mean the yield on equities
looks remarkably attractive at present, although there are
clearly risks to capital in holding shares.”  Shell, Vodafone  Royal Dutch Shell Plc retained its position as the largest
payer of dividends, distributing 6.7 billion pounds in 2011,
one-tenth of all payments. Capita predicted that mobile-phone
operator  Vodafone Group Plc (VOD)  will overtake Shell in 2012, paying
out 7 billion pounds including a 2 billion-pound special
dividend next month.  Mining companies boosted their payouts by 88 percent to 4.8
billion pounds last year as  Antofagasta Plc (ANTO) , the copper producer
controlled by  Chile ’s Luksic family, and Fresnillo Plc made
special dividends. Anglo American Plc, which runs six projects
in Chile, made a full year of dividend payments in 2011,
compared with one payout in 2010.  Gas, water and utility companies increased their payments
by 97 percent to 4.4 billion pounds as International Power Plc
made an extraordinary payment of 1.6 billion pounds.  Capita forecast that U.K. dividends will climb to 75
billion pounds in 2012, giving the benchmark  FTSE 100 Index  a
dividend yield of 4.5 percent.  Novartis AG, SAP AG and Ericsson AB are among 13 companies
in the  Stoxx Europe 600 Index  that may increase their dividends
this week, while Nokia Oyj and Banco de Sabadell SA may decrease
their payouts, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
