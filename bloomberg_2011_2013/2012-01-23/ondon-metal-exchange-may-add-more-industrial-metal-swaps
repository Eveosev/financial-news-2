The London Metal Exchange is
considering adding industrial metal swaps settled against
various periods, in addition to the monthly ones which were
introduced today.  Swaps for aluminum, two aluminum alloys, zinc, tin, nickel,
copper and lead, were made available on the LME today, the
exchange said in a statement. None of them have been traded on
the exchange’s LMESelect electronic platform yet, according to
 Chris Evans , head of business development.  The swaps will be settled in cash against the monthly
average settlement price based on a calendar month. The exchange
may also introduce swaps settled against the average prices for
a non-calendar month, Evans said.  “As we expand our scope in clearing, that would be a
product that we would look at,” Evans said by phone in London
today, adding there were no immediate plans for the expansion.
The LME is “researching” introducing steel billet swaps, he
said.  The swaps will be traded on LMESelect and the telephone and
cleared by LCH.Clearnet Group, which handles other LME
contracts.  The swaps “have been launched in response to the push from
regulators to get over-the-counter swaps done through
clearing,” Evans said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
