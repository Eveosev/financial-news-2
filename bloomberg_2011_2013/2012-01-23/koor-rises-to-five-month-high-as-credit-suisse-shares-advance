Koor Industries Ltd. (KOR)  climbed to the
highest level in almost six months as the shares of  Credit
Suisse Group AG (CSGN) , the Swiss lender in which the Tel Aviv-based
company holds a stake, rallied.  Koor gained 4.1 percent to 50.99 shekels at the 4:30 p.m.
close in Tel Aviv, the highest since Aug. 4. That brought the
five-day surge to 14 percent. Credit Suisse  shares  have gained
16 percent in  Switzerland  over that period. Koor said in
November it owns 30.32 million shares of the Swiss bank.  “The fortunes of Koor are linked to those of Credit
Suisse,” Noam Pincu, an analyst at Psagot Investment House Ltd.
in Tel Aviv said by telephone.  A gauge of European banks was the best performer of the  19
industry groups  in the Stoxx Europe 600 Index today as European
officials forge ahead with crafting a long-term plan to tackle
the region’s debt crisis. Koor, which is  70.11 percent-owned  by
 Discount Investment Corp. (DISI) , reported a loss of 2.85 billion
shekels ($757 million) in the first nine months of 2011 as the
value of its investment in Credit Suisse declined.  The yields on the bonds of  IDB Holding Corp. (IDBH) , the
controlling shareholder of Koor through its ownership of
Discount and IDB Development Corp., reached record highs in
December amid investor concern about how the holding company
will meet its obligations.  “A stronger recovery in Credit Suisse may help lower the
yields because it will raise the net asset value of Koor,
Discount Investment and IDB Development,” Pincu said. “But it
has to be a bigger recovery than this.”  Discount Investment shares  advanced 2 percent to 26.85
shekels. IDB Holding shares gained 0.6 percent to 44.47 shekels.  To contact the reporter on this story:
