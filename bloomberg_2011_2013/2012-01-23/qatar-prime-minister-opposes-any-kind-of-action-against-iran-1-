Qatar Prime Minister said he
wouldn’t like  “any kind of action against  Iran ” and hopes the
conflict over the nation’s nuclear program can be resolved
diplomatically after the European Union agreed to ban oil
imports from the Islamic Republic.  “We here, in Qatar, are very keen to see the diffusing of
this tension, we are working for that,” Hamad Bin Jasim Bin Jaber al Thani told reporters in the Qatari capital Doha.  European Union foreign ministers agreed to ban oil imports
from Iran starting July 1 to pressure the  Persian Gulf  nation to
curtail its nuclear program, the 27-nation bloc said in a
statement. European countries and the U.S. accuse Iran of
seeking to develop atomic weapons. Iran says its nuclear program
is strictly for energy.  Iran has threatened to close the Strait of Hormuz, a seaway
linking the Persian Gulf with the  Indian Ocean , if sanctions are
imposed on its oil. Qatar, the world’s biggest producer of
liquefied natural gas, ships nearly all its LNG and crude oil
through the strait to markets around the world.  “Hormuz is an international passageway and I think it’s in
the benefit of all that this passage stays open for the economy,
for the world,” the prime minister said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
