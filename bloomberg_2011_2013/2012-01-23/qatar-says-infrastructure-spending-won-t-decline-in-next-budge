Qatar’s next budget will include the
same amount for infrastructure as the previous budget, Prime
Minister Hamad Bin Jasim Bin Jaber al Thani said.  The country set aside 40 billion riyals ($11 billion) for
infrastructure projects in the last budget, he told reporters in
the Qatari capital Doha. If spending this year is “not more, it
won’t be less.”  Qatar’s next budget starts in April.  To contact the reporter on this story:
