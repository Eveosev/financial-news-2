The Bundesbank said economic growth
in Germany,  Europe ’s largest economy, may have come to a
“standstill” in the fourth quarter of 2011.  “After the strong rise in economic performance during the
summer, even slightly negative growth can’t be ruled out,” the
Frankfurt-based central bank said in its monthly report today.
“Growth may have come to a standstill in the last quarter of
2011.” Manufacturing “in particular has suffered from the
slowing global economic dynamic and the disruption from the debt
crisis in the euro area.”  European finance ministers meet in Brussels today to try
and forge a long-term solution to the region’s sovereign-debt
crisis, now in its third year. While Germany’s economic
expansion has powered the euro-region economy, it is edging
toward a recession as budget cuts across the 17-member currency
area curb demand for its export goods.  While the Bundesbank forecast a recovery in 2013, with
gross domestic product projected to rise 1.8 percent, the
economy may expand 0.6 percent this year, it said. “For the
beginning of 2012, the indications are that the economy will
move sideways,” according to the report.  Germany ’s statistics office said on Jan. 11 the economy
probably shrank “roughly” 0.25 percent in the final three
months of last year. Growth slowed to 3 percent in 2011 from 3.7
percent in 2010, which was the most since German reunification
two decades ago.  To contact the reporter on this story:
