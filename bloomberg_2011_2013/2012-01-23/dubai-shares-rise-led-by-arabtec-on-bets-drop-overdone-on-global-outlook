Dubai’s benchmark advanced to the
highest in almost three weeks on speculation declines in the
past month prompted by concerns over  Europe ’s debt crisis were
overdone given the outlook for growth.  Arabtec Holding Co. (ARTC) , the United Arab Emirates’ biggest
construction company, gained 4.1 percent.  Dubai Financial Market (DFM) 
PJSC rose for a second day. The  DFM General Index (DFMGI)  increased 0.5
percent to 1,340.70 at the 2 p.m. close in the emirate, the
highest since Jan. 5. Dubai’s shares slumped to the lowest since
May 2004 on Jan. 16, while  Abu Dhabi ’s fell to the lowest in
three years. Abu Dhabi’s  ADX General Index (ADSMI)  rose 0.5 percent.  “The recent decline was overdone and last week we reached
new lows,” said Sebastien Henin, who helps oversee $100 million
at The National Investor in Abu Dhabi. “We are in a gray zone.
We know that valuations are good, but we suffer from a lack of
visibility on the local and international levels.”  Emerging market stocks rose today as increasing home sales
in the U.S. added to signs the world’s biggest economy is
recovering, outweighing uncertainties over continuing debt
negotiations in  Greece . Economic growth in the U.A.E. will
accelerate to 3.8 percent this year from 3.3 percent in 2011,
according to International Monetary Fund forecasts.  The  31 companies in Dubai’s benchmark index  are valued at
about  7.9 times  estimated earnings, data compiled by Bloomberg
show. That compares with 10 times for the  MSCI Emerging Markets
Index. (MXEF)  About 118 million shares were traded  in the emirate
today , compared with a 12-month daily average of about 100
million shares.  Arabtec rose to 1.79 dirhams, the highest close since
November 2010. Dubai Financial Market, the only publicly traded
Gulf Arab stock market, advanced 0.7 percent to 72.5 fils.  The  Tadawul All Share Index (SASEIDX)  advanced 0.2 percent. Oman’s
 MSM 30 Index  increased 0.1 percent, while Kuwait’s  KWSE Price
Index (KWSEIDX)  declined 0.2 percent. Bahrain’s  BB All Share Index (BHSEASI)  was
little changed, while Qatar’s  QE Index (DSM)  retreated 0.4 percent and
the  Bloomberg GCC 200 Index  slipped less than 0.1 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
