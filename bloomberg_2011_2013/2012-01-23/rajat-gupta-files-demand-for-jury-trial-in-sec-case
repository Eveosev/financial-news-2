Rajat Gupta , the former  Goldman
Sachs Group Inc. (GS)  director charged with insider trading as part
of the Galleon Group LLC probe, filed a demand for a jury trial
in the civil case brought against him by the U.S. Securities and
Exchange Commission.  The SEC claims Gupta, 63, gave Raj Rajaratnam, the
convicted Galleon co-founder, information about  Berkshire
Hathaway Inc. (BRK/A) â€™s $5 billion investment in Goldman Sachs. The
agency also alleges that Gupta told Rajaratnam about quarterly
earnings of Goldman Sachs and Procter & Gamble, where Gupta was
also a director.  Gupta, who faces related criminal charges in a separate
case, has denied wrongdoing.  The SEC filed an administrative proceeding against Gupta in
Washington on March 1, claiming he passed illegal inside
information to Rajaratnam. The agency later withdrew that action
and sued Gupta in federal court in  Manhattan , after Gupta
claimed the administrative proceeding improperly deprived him of
procedural protections, including the right to have a jury,
rather than a judge, determine the case.  Rajaratnam, 54, was found guilty in May of 14 criminal
counts of conspiracy and securities fraud. He is serving an 11-
year sentence in a federal medical prison in Massachusetts.  The case is Gupta v. SEC, 11-cv-01900, U.S. District Court,
Southern District of New York (Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
