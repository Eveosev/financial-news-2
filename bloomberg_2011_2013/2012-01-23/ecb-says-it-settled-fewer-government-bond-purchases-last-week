The  European Central Bank  bought
fewer government bonds last week.  The Frankfurt-based ECB said it settled 2.24 billion euros
($2.9 billion) of bond purchases in the week through Jan. 20,
down from 3.77 billion euros the previous week. The ECB will
take seven-day term deposits tomorrow to absorb the 219 billion
euros of liquidity created since its Securities Markets Program
started in May 2010, a practice it employs to ensure the
purchases don’t fuel inflation.  Italian borrowing costs fell last week and ECB President
 Mario Draghi  said there are “tentative” signs of stabilization
in the economy even as the sovereign debt crisis poses downside
risks.  Standard & Poor’s  on Jan. 13 downgraded nine euro-area
nations including France and  Austria , saying efforts to combat
the crisis are falling short.  The ECB has refused to ramp up its bond program to help
indebted nations, saying the purchases are aimed solely at
ensuring monetary-policy transmission and it’s up to governments
to solve the crisis. European finance ministers are meeting in
Brussels today to agree new fiscal rules to win back investor
confidence in the monetary union.  Euro-region  government bonds  returned 0.6 percent so far
this year, after posting a 4 percent gain in December, the best
month since before the creation of the single currency,
according to indexes compiled by Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
