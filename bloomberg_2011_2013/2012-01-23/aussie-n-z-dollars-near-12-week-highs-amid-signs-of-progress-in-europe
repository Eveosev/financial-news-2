The Australian and New Zealand
dollars traded near 12-week highs on speculation European Union
finance ministers meeting in Brussels are making headway on
measures to resolve the region’s sovereign-debt crisis.  The so-called Aussie and kiwi rose yesterday after French
Finance Minister  Francois Baroin  said negotiations between
 Greece  and its private creditors are making tangible progress.
Demand for the higher-yielding currencies increased before U.S.
data this week forecast to show economic growth is accelerating.  “There’s certainly a lot of hope and a reasonable amount
of optimism that deals will be forthcoming” in  Europe , said
 Robert Rennie , Sydney-based chief currency strategist at Westpac
Banking Corp. “The Australian dollar is starting to look
overpriced on most, if not all metrics, but it’s not clear to me
if there’s any catalyst out there that is going to push it
lower.”  The Australian currency traded at $1.0525 as of 10:47 a.m.
in Sydney, unchanged from yesterday’s close in  New York . It
yesterday climbed as high as $1.0573, the strongest since Oct.
31. The Aussie was at 81.03 yen from 81.06 yesterday, when it
advanced for a fifth-straight day.  New Zealand’s dollar fetched 81.11 U.S. cents from 81.01
yesterday, when it reached 81.42, also the highest since Oct.
31. It was at 62.44 yen from 62.41.  U.S. gross domestic product increased at a 3 percent annual
rate in the fourth quarter, according to the median forecast of
economists in a Bloomberg News survey before the Commerce
Department’s Jan. 27 report. That compares with a 1.8 percent
advance in the previous three-month period. Other reports this
week may show gains in new-home sales and durable goods orders,
separate polls show.  Gains in the South Pacific currencies were limited as a
technical indicator signaled recent gains may have been
excessive. The  New Zealand  dollar’s 14-day relative strength
index against the greenback yesterday reached the 70 level that
some traders see as a signal that an asset may be about to
reverse direction. The index for the Aussie is at 68.  -- Editors: Benjamin Purvis, Naoto Hosoda  To contact the reporter on this story:
