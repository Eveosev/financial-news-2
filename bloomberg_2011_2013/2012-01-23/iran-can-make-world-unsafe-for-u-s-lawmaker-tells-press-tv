Iran will make the world unsafe for
the U.S. if it intervenes militarily in the  Strait of Hormuz ,
lawmaker Mohammad Kowsari said, according to state-run Press TV.  The Islamic Republic will shut the Persian Gulf passageway,
route for about 20 percent of globally traded oil, if there is a
disruption in the sale of Iranian oil, Kowsari said, Press TV
reported.  The U.S. and its allies won’t be able to reopen the
strategic waterway, said Kowsari, deputy head of parliament’s
national security and foreign policy committee, Press TV
reported on its website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
