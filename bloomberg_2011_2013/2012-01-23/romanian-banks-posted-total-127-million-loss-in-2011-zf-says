Romaniaâ€™s banks posted a total loss
of 430 million lei ($127 million) at the end of 2011 because of
bad-loan provisions,  Ziarul Financiar  reported today, without
saying where it got the information.  The loss narrowed from 2010, when the Romanian banking
industry posted a combined loss of 516 million lei, after the
banks reduced provisions and cut costs firing people in
December, saving around 400 million lei, the Bucharest-based
newspaper said today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
