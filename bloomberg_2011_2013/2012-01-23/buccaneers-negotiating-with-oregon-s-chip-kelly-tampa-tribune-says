The  Tampa Bay Buccaneers  are in
negotiations to hire University of Oregon coach Chip Kelly, who
won three straight conference titles, according to the  Tampa
Tribune , which cited a person with knowledge of the talks.  Kelly’s Oregon team this year won the Rose Bowl 45-38 over
the  University of Wisconsin  and finished ranked fourth in both
the coaches’ and writers’ polls with a 12-2 record. His teams
are known for running a “spread” offense which focuses on
speed and not giving the defense time to adjust from one play to
the next. He’s been the Ducks’ head coach for three seasons,
compiling a 34-6 record.  The Buccaneers fired coach Raheem Morris after finishing
4-12 this season.  Tampa Bay  was 3-13 in Morris’s first season in
2009, and improved to 10-6 in 2010, the greatest single-season
turnaround in franchise history.  To contact the reporter on this story:
