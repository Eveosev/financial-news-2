Central European Media Enterprises
Ltd. (CETV)  jumped the most in three months after a report that the
company’s 2011 Oibda, or operating income before depreciation
and amortization, probably rose 60 percent from a year ago.  The shares of CME, as the broadcaster is known, surged 7.2
percent to 141.5 koruna at the close in Prague, its biggest one-
day rally since Oct. 21. The company’s U.S.-traded shares
climbed 5.2 percent to $7.14 by 11:47 a.m. in New York.  CME has a “sufficient” liquidity of $200 million in cash,
and a debt payment of $130 million due next year is not a
problem, Chief Executive Officer Adrian Sarbu told Hospodarske
Noviny in an interview published today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
