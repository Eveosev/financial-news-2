Greece  will pursue talks on a debt
swap with private creditors after euro-area countries lent their
support to the effort, the  Finance Ministry  said.  The goal of the negotiations is the “full implementation”
of a late-October agreement among European leaders seeking to
lower Greece’s debt to 120 percent of gross domestic product by
2020, the ministry said late yesterday.  A formal offer on the terms of the voluntary debt swap is
due by Feb. 13, according to the ministry.  At a meeting of euro-area finance chiefs in Brussels
yesterday, discussions also addressed the latest on the
sustainability of Greece’s debt in order to ensure it reaches
the 2020 target, the ministry said.  “A critical factor from this perspective is the rate of
growth of the  Greek economy  as well as of course to a degree the
interest rate on the coupons of the new bonds,” the ministry
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
