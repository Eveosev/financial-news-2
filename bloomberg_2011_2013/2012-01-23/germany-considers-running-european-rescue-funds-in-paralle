The German government is considering
proposals to run the temporary and permanent European rescue
funds in parallel if needed, potentially creating a bigger
firewall against the debt crisis.  European Union leaders are due in Brussels on Jan. 30 for a
summit and “we can talk about all those things at that
meeting,” Steffen Seibert, chief government spokesman, told
reporters in Berlin today, when asked about the funds running in
tandem. “I’m not going to give away any German negotiating
position. You should just know that we have been anticipating a
sequencing and we see no reason to change that.”  EU leaders agreed at their last summit in December to bring
forward introduction of the 500 billion-euro ($650 billion)
permanent fund known as the European Stability Mechanism by a
year. The ESM is now intended to replace the 440 billion-euro
European Financial Stability Facility in mid-2012.  Running the funds in parallel “is being discussed,”
 Norbert Barthle , the budget spokesman in parliament for
 Chancellor Angela Merkel ’s  Christian Democratic Union , said in
an interview in Berlin today. The funds would only be run
together “in an emergency,” he said.  Germany  doesn’t believe that  Europe ’s rescue funds for
indebted countries need increased firepower, Seibert said at the
same briefing.  Germany “currently is not of the conviction that the ESM
has to be doubled,” Seibert said in response to a question.  To contact the reporter on this story:
