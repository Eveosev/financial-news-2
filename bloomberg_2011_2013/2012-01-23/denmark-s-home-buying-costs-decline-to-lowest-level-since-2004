Danish home mortgages’ share of
family income fell to its lowest level since 2004 as  house
prices  and  interest rates  fell,  Realkredit Danmark A/S (DANSKE) , the
country’s second-largest mortgage lender, said.  Monthly mortgage payments for a fixed loan fell to 14
percent of an average income for a family with children,
Realkredit, the home-lending arm of Danske Bank A/S, the
country’s largest lender, said today in an e-mailed statement.
Mortgage payments for an adjustable-rate loan fell to 3 percent.  “The continuing weak economic development and the recent
period of uncertainty on the financial market have sent interest
rates down,” Christian Heinig, chief economist at the bank,
said in the statement.  Realkredit Danmark introduced a new index to measure
average home-buying costs based on monthly payments for an
average 140-square-meter house that costs 1.67 million kroner
($290,460). Monthly payments were 5,430 kroner, if financed with
a 3.5 percent fixed-rate loan, and 1,240 kroner if financed with
a mortgage that adjusts yearly, the lender said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
