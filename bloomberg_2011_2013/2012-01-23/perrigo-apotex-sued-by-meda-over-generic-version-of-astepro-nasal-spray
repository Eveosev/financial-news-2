Generic drugmakers  Perrigo Co. (PRGO)  and
Apotex Inc. were sued by  Meda Pharmaceuticals Inc. (783447Q)  and accused
of infringing a U.S. patent for the nasal spray  Astepro , used to
treat allergies.  Meda, based in Somerset,  New Jersey , contends Perrigo,
based in Allegan, Michigan, and Apotex, of Toronto, plan to
market copies of the drug before its U.S. patent expires in
2028. It filed a complaint Jan. 19 in federal court in Trenton,
New Jersey.  “Perrigo is committed to making quality health care more
affordable for our customers,” Chief Executive Officer Joseph C. Papa said today in a statement.  An Apotex spokesman, Elie Betito, didn’t immediately reply
to voice and e-mail messages seeking comment on the lawsuit.  Meda is a unit of Solna, Sweden-based  Meda AB. (MEDAA)   The case is Meda v. Apotex, 12-cv-361, U.S. District Court,
