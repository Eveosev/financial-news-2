Mitsubishi Tanabe Pharma Corp. (4508) ,
discoverer of the multiple sclerosis treatment Gilenya, fell the
most in 10 months in Tokyo trading after U.S. and European
regulators said they are reviewing the safety of the medicine.  Mitsubishi Tanabe dropped as much as 9.2 percent, the most
on an intraday basis since March 15, to 1,048 yen and traded at
1,065 yen as of the midday break.  Japan ’s benchmark Topix Index
rose 0.3 percent.  The European Medicines Agency and the U.S.  Food and Drug
Administration  are reviewing the drug after the European
regulator said Jan. 20 it found 11 deaths among patients using
the treatment sold by Mitsubishi Tanabe’s partner  Novartis AG. (NOVN) 
The review came about 16 months after the drug’s initial U.S.
approval.  “Few people probably expected that the drug would be
reviewed again at this time,” Hiroshi Tanaka, a health-care
analyst at Mizuho Securities Co. in  Tokyo , said by telephone
today. “Also, there was a sudden jump in the number of deaths
from what the market knew about in December.”  Novartis said last month a patient died Nov. 23 after
starting treatment with Gilenya, the first oral drug for
multiple sclerosis. Ten other deaths have been reported,
including six unexplained deaths, three heart attacks and one
due to disruption of heart rhythm, the London-based EMA said. It
isn’t clear what role if any Gilenya had in the deaths, it said.  Osaka-based Mitsubishi Tanabe forecasts operating profit to
increase 47 percent over four years to 100 billion yen by March
2016, led by products including Gilenya. The drug generated $291
million in sales for Novartis in the first nine months of 2011.
More than 30,000 patients worldwide have now taken the medicine,
according to the EMA.  Julie Masow, a spokeswoman for Novartis, said in a Jan. 20
e-mail the death rate is in line with the broader expected death
rates based on the 30,000 multiple sclerosis patients who have
been treated with Gilenya to date.  To contact the reporter on this story:
