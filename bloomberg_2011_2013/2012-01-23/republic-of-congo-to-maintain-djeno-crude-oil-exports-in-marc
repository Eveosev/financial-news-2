The Republic of Congo will export
six 920,000 barrel-cargoes of Djeno crude in March, unchanged
from February, according to a loading program obtained by
Bloomberg News.  The country also plans to keep its N’Kossa grade shipments
for March stable at two consignments of 950,000 barrels each,
the plan showed. Total SA,  France ’s largest oil producer,
operates the two fields.  Loading programs are monthly schedules of crude shipments
compiled by field operators to allow buyers and sellers to plan
their supply and trading activities.  To contact the reporter on this story:
