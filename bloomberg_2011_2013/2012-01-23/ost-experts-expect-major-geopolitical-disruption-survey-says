A  survey  of 345 “global experts”
from business, government, international organizations and
academia found most expect a “major geopolitical disruption”
in the next year, according to the World Economic Forum.  The percentage expecting a major disruption rose to 54
percent from 36 percent three months ago, the Geneva-based forum
said today in an e-mailed statement. A geopolitical disruption
refers to a political clash that has international implications,
such as a territorial conflict, terrorist act or civil war.  Most respondents remained pessimistic about the global
economy and 60 percent lack confidence in global governance, or
the ability of political leaders to deal with risks, unchanged
from three months earlier, the survey found.  “The possibility of a geoeconomic disruption, such as
sovereign default, is to some degree reflected in the market,
but a major geopolitical disruption clearly is not,” Lee
Howell, managing director of the  World Economic Forum 
responsible for the annual meeting and the Global Risks Report
2012, said in a statement.  The respondents are members of the forum’s  Network of
Global Agenda Councils , which includes policy makers, academics
and business leaders.  To contact the reporter on this story:
