A lighter side of  Andy Warhol 
appears at  Manhattan ’s L&M Arts in 27 ink-and-watercolor
drawings of hats, each identified with a famous name.  Cleopatra’s is a pink-and-green construction that suggests
a theater stage.  George Washington  and Napoleon’s head-pieces,
both dark blue and of similar shape, could be confused if it
weren’t for the French flag’s colors on the emperor’s chapeau.
Scarlett O’Hara gets a pert bonnet trimmed with flowers and
ribbon.  The “Who’s Who in Holiday Hats?” series was created in
1958 and then published in the December 1964 issue of McCall’s.
With tongue in cheek, the magazine suggested cutting them out to
make party favors.  You can buy the set for $1.8 million.  Also on view are drawings of shoes from the 1955 Warhol
portfolio “A la Recherche du Shoe Perdu,” inspired by Proust’s
seven-volume novel, as well as its illustrated cover. Prices
range between $18,000 and $42,000; the cover is $90,000.  The show is at 45 E. 78th St., through Feb. 18.

about 400 paintings. One batch came after an inspiring 1930
visit to Mondrian’s atelier in Paris that plunged the American
into three weeks of abstract work, according to the  Calder
Foundation .  Works from this period are included among a group of 30 in
“Alexander Calder: The Painter” at the Helly Nahmad Gallery.
Though they recall the Dutch painter’s lines and squares,
Calder’s Mondrian-inspired canvases are warmer and his colors
gentler.  The later “My Shop,” painted in 1955, shows the artist’s
Roxbury,  Connecticut , studio filled with completed and
unfinished works, some of which are on view in the show. The
1925 “The Flying Trapeze,” shows hundreds of spectators, all
identically painted with a blot of pink and some black around
it.  Prices range between $650,000 and $2 million, though most
works are not for sale. The show is at 975 Madison Ave., through
Jan. 28. Information: +1-212-879-2075; hellynahmadgallery.com.  ‘Great Moments’  Even a seasoned equestrian can get thrown. It happened to
Jackie Kennedy in 1969, and photographer Marshall Hawkins
immortalized the mortification.  The vintage print is on view at Keith De Lellis Gallery for
the show “Current Events: Great Moments in 20th Century Press
Photography.”  Owner De Lellis has been gathering images of events from
the past century for more than five years. He bought them from
newspapers, as well as from private collectors.  The show arranges the photographs chronologically and
thematically. The former First Lady’s fall is shown with her
fashion styles, and a wounded U.S. soldier in South Vietnam in
1965 shares a frame with young boys from an orphan village near
Long Thanh.  Other events include the 1960 Democratic National
Convention, Mussolini speechifying in 1938, and crowds stunned
by the 1929 Wall Street stock-market crash.  Prices range between $350 and $9,000. The show is at 1045
Madison Ave., through Jan. 26. Information: +1-212-327-1482;
