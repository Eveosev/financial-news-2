Joseph Granville, whose “sell
everything” call in 1981 sparked a decline in U.S. stocks, said
the  Dow Jones Industrial Average (INDU)  will drop toward 8,000 this
year because of waning momentum and volume.  “Volume precedes prices,” Granville, 88, a technical
analyst who has been publishing the Granville Market Letter from
 Kansas City ,  Missouri  for about 50 years, said in an interview
on “Street Smart” on Bloomberg Television. “You are seeing
much lower volume. That tells you that prices are going to go
much lower, much lower than most people think possible and very
few people have projected.”  The Dow average has gained 4 percent this year to 12,708.82
at 4 p.m. in New York. The  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index  has
climbed 4.6 percent this month, its best start to a year since
1997, as economic data on housing, manufacturing, and employment
bolstered confidence in the world’s largest economy.  Trading in U.S. stocks fell to the lowest level since at
least 2008 amid mutual fund withdrawals and Wall Street job
cuts. An average of  6.69 billion shares  changed hands on U.S.
exchanges in the 50 days ended Jan. 18, the fewest on record in
Bloomberg data starting three years ago that excludes over-the-
counter venues. On the  New York  Stock Exchange, volume has
tumbled to the lowest level since 1999, the data show.  Granville told newsletter readers to “Sell Everything” on
Jan. 6, 1981. The Dow fell 2.4 percent the next day. He
correctly forecast the bear market of 1977-78 and the burst of
the Internet bubble that began in 2000. In March 2008, Granville
said the Dow would end the year near 9,000, more than 27 percent
below its level of 12,392.66 at the time. The gauge finished the
year at 8,776.39.  His predictions proved less prescient during some of the
previous bull markets. He failed to foresee the rally that
started in 1982 and lasted for five years. He also called for
losses in 1995 while the  S&P 500  rose every year till 2000.  To contact the reporter on this story:
