Acerinox SA (ACX) , the world’s largest
stainless-steel producer, rose the most in 11 months after rival
 ThyssenKrupp AG (TKA)  discussed merging its Inoxum stainless unit with
 Finland ’s Outokumpu Oyj.  Acerinox climbed 4.9 percent to 10.89 euros, valuing the
Madrid-based company at 2.71 billion euros ($3.53 billion).
Options for Inoxum include an initial public offering, spinoff
or sale, Essen, Germany-based ThyssenKrupp said today in a
statement.  “This could be a significant step in the long-awaited
consolidation of the European stainless-steel sector, marked by
a structural overcapacity,” Manuel Coelho, an analyst at Banco
BPI based in Porto,  Portugal , wrote in a note to investors
today. “We note however that the combination of Inoxum and
Outokumpu should raise antitrust hurdles.”  European stainless producers have struggled for years with
overcapacity, sliding profit and rising costs while failing to
agree on mergers. Moody’s Investors Service said in August the
companies had been unable to value their assets at levels that
allowed deals to go ahead. Combinations may also be opposed by
European Union antitrust authorities, the ratings company said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
