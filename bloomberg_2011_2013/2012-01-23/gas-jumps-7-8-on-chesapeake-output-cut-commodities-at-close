The Standard & Poor’s GSCI Spot
Index of 24  raw materials  advanced 1.1 percent to close at
658.85 at 4:04 p.m. in  New York , led by natural gas and base
metals.  The UBS Bloomberg CMCI  index  of 26 prices gained 1.3
percent to 1,581.656.  NATURAL GAS  Natural gas, the worst-performing commodity in 2012, rose
the most in two years in New York after Chesapeake Energy Corp.,
the second-largest U.S. producer, said it will cut production
and reduce spending.  Futures climbed 7.8 percent after Chesapeake said it will
“immediately curtail” output of 500 million cubic feet a day
and lower planned investment in gas fields by 70 percent from
2011 levels to $900 million.  Hedge funds  and other large
speculators last week cut bets that gas would fall as it traded
at its lowest levels since 2002, a government report showed.  On the  New York Mercantile Exchange , gas for February
delivery rose 18.2 cents to settle at $2.525 per million British
thermal units. The percentage increase was biggest since Dec.
10, 2009. The futures are down 16 percent this year.  Gross production at Chesapeake wells will be cut by as much
as 1 billion cubic feet a day as gas-well completions are
deferred wherever possible, the Oklahoma City-based company said
in a statement today. The reduction equals about 1.5 percent of
U.S. marketed gas output in 2011, Energy Department data show.  The company will idle half of its drilling rigs by the
second quarter in fields that produce only gas, including
Barnett Shale of Texas, the Marcellus Shale and the Haynesville
Shale.  BASE METALS  Copper futures rose as European Union finance ministers
took steps to tame the region’s debt crisis, improving prospects
for metal demand.  Ministers were to discuss new budget rules, a financial
firewall to protect indebted states and a Greek debt swap.
Copper also advanced as imports by  China , the world’s biggest
consumer, climbed to a record, and speculators turned bullish
for the first time in four months.  On the Comex, copper futures for March delivery rose 1.4
percent to settle at $3.7985 a pound. The price has climbed 11
percent this month.  On the  London  Metal Exchange, copper for delivery in three
months gained 1.8 percent to $8,365 a ton ($3.79 a pound).  Aluminum, lead, zinc and tin also climbed in London, while
nickel declined.  PRECIOUS METALS  Gold futures jumped to a six-week high as the dollar
dropped against the euro, enhancing the appeal of the precious
metal as an alternative asset.  Gold for February delivery gained 0.9 percent to close at
$1,678.30 an ounce on the Comex after touching $1,681.80, the
highest price for a most-active contract since Dec. 12. The
precious metal has advanced 7.1 percent this month.  Silver futures for March delivery advanced 1.9 percent to

$688.85 an ounce, after rising to $689, the highest price for a
most-active contract since Dec. 7.  CRUDE OIL  Oil rose for the first time in four days after the European
Union agreed to ban crude imports from Iran, raising concern
that retaliation from the Islamic Republic may disrupt oil
supply from the  Middle East .  Futures gained 1.3 percent as the 27-nation bloc said it
would implement the crude embargo starting July 1 to pressure
the country over its nuclear program. Iran has threatened to
close the  Strait of Hormuz , the transit point for about a fifth
of global oil, if its exports are banned.  On the Nymex, oil for March delivery climbed $1.25 to

the past year.  Brent oil for March settlement advanced 72 cents, or 0.7
percent, to $110.58 a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures
 Europe  exchange.  OIL PRODUCTS  Heating oil rose on speculation that Europe will import
more diesel from the U.S. as European Union foreign ministers
agreed to ban oil from  Iran  starting July 1 and European
refiners shut plants.  On the Nymex, February-delivery heating oil advanced 2.14
cents to settle at $3.0098 a gallon after touching $3.0356.

$2.7779 a gallon on the exchange, the third consecutive decline
since the Jan. 19 Energy Department report on inventories.  GRAINS, OILSEEDS  Corn and soybeans rose to the highest prices in more than a
week on speculation that weekend rains in Argentina were too
light to revive crops hurt by weeks of dry weather, increasing
demand for supplies from the U.S.  Corn futures for March delivery increased 1.4 percent to
close at $6.20 a bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade after
touching $6.2125, the highest price for a most-active contract
since Jan. 12. The grain rose 2 percent last week on
