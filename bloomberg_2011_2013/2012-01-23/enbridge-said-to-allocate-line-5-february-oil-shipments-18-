Enbridge Inc. (ENB)  has apportioned
February crude-oil shipments on Line 5 by 18 percent, two people
with knowledge of the plans said.  The people declined to be identified because the
information isn’t public. Enbridge apportioned Line 5 by 22
percent for January shipments, the Calgary-based company said on
Dec. 20.  Line 5 runs from Superior, Wisconsin, to Sarnia, Ontario,
and can carry 491,200 barrels a day of oil, according to the
