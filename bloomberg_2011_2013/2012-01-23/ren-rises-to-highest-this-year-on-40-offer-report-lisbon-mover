REN-Redes Energeticas Nacionais SA
climbed the highest this year after  State Grid International of
China  and Oman Oil Co. offered to buy 40 percent from  Portugal .  REN gained 1.9 percent to 2.109 euros, the  highest  closing
level since Dec. 30. State Grid offered a more than 40 percent
premium to the Jan. 20 close of 2.07 euros, and Oman Oil more
than 30 percent, said a person familiar with the matter.  “A high premium for a stake in REN is bolstering its
shares today,” Pedro Oliveira, a trader at Go Bulling in
Oporto, northern Portugal, said in an interview.  State Grid bid about 2.90 euros a share for 25 percent and
Oman Oil about 2.70 euros for 15 percent, the Jornal de Negocios
newspaper reported today without citing anyone. Portugal aims to
sell as much as 40 percent after seeking a European Union and
International Monetary Fund bailout last year. An official at
the  Finance Ministry  declined to comment on the sale of REN.  The stock’s trading  volume  of 484,480 shares today was more
than four times the daily average for the past three months.  To contact the reporter on this story:
