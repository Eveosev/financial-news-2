J.C. Penney Co. (JCP) , run by Apple Inc.’s
former retail chief, will cut thousands of jobs as part of a
plan to overhaul the company, the New York Post reported.  Chief Executive Officer  Ron Johnson  is eliminating
positions that involve re-tagging merchandise and putting up
temporary signs and displays, the Post  said , citing people it
didn’t name. The reductions will affect employees at almost all
of J.C Penney’s 1,200 stores in the U.S.  The job cuts are part of a strategy to replace the
company’s traditional sales and clearance events to offer
everyday low prices, the newspaper said. J.C. Penney is holding
an event on Jan. 25 to announce Johnson’s plans.  The Post said Johnson is being encouraged to cut jobs by
J.C. Penney’s largest shareholders,  William Ackman  and Steve
Roth.  Kate Coultas, a spokeswoman for J.C. Penney, didn’t return
a phone call and e-mail seeking comment before business hours.  To contact the reporter on this story:
