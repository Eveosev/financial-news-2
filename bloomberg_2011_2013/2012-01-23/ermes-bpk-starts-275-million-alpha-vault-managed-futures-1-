 Hermes BPK Partners LLP, an
advisory and fund of hedge funds manager with $2.3 billion
assets under management, said it launched a $275 million
account.  The Alpha Vault Managed Futures account uses five funds to
invest in  futures markets , the company, owned by the BT Pension
Scheme, said in a statement today. Hermes BPK will start
marketing the account, which will be run by Mark Barker and
Gregory Knott, in the first quarter, Matteo Dante Perruccio,
chief executive officer of Hermes BPK, said in a telephone
interview from  London  today.  “Everybody is feeling over-exposed, they don’t feel
confident with their risk profiles,” Perruccio said. “We built
this solution for one investor, but we are going to make it
available to other investors. We think it has huge potential.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
