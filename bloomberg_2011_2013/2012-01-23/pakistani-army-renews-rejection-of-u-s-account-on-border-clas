Pakistan ’s armed forces issued a
newly detailed rejection of last month’s report by the U.S.
military that said both armies had made mistakes that led to the
Nov. 26 border clash between them.  The Pakistan military press office posted on its website a
25-page account of its disagreements with the U.S. investigation
of the fight, in which American air strikes killed 24 Pakistani
soldiers.  The “fundamental cause” of the incident was “the failure
of U.S./ISAF to share its near-border operation with Pakistan at
any level,” the account said, using the acronym for the U.S.-
led International Security Assistance Force in Afghanistan.  Pakistan’s army spokesman, Major General Athar Abbas,
voiced his command’s rejection of the report immediately after
it was issued on Dec. 22. Since the clash, Pakistan has closed
its border to U.S. military supplies being sent to  Afghanistan 
and suspended much of its military and intelligence cooperation
with the U.S. government.  To contact the reporter on this story:
