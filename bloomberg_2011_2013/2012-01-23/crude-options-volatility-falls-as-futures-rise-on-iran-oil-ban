Crude oil options volatility fell
for the first time in three days as underlying futures rose
after the European Union agree to ban oil imports from  Iran .  Implied volatility for at-the-money options expiring in
March, a measure of expected price swings in futures and a gauge
of options prices, was 29.8 as of 3:30 p.m. in  New York , down
from 30.3 on Jan. 20. March crude oil rose as much as 1.9
percent in intraday trading before settling 1.3 percent higher.  “We rallied back so volatility came off,” said Fred
Rigolini, vice president of Paramount Options Inc. in New York.  Crude for March delivery rose $1.25 to settle at $99.58 a
barrel on the  New York Mercantile Exchange , the first increase
in four days.  The most active options in electronic trading today were
March $90 puts, with 4,005 lots changing hands at 3:44 p.m. They
fell 31 cents to 45 cents a barrel. March $95 puts, the second-
most active option, lost 52 cents to $1.30 with 1,855 lots
trading. One contract covers 1,000 barrels of crude.  Puts accounted for 55 percent of electronic trading volume
and were the four most-active contracts.  “There’s been a lot of downside put buying, March $80 and
$90 puts and April $63 puts, with people squaring positions that
might have been short,” Rigolini said. “There was some selling
of March $115 calls. But there were no real directional plays.”  Previous Session  The exchange distributes real-time data for electronic
trading and releases information on floor trading, where the
bulk of options trading occurs, the next business day.  The five most active options Jan. 20 were puts. Bearish
options accounted for 54 percent of volume. March $90 puts were
