The European Union’s decision today
to impose sanctions against the purchase of oil from Iran allows
customers time to find alternative supply, the  International
Energy Agency  said.  “The EU embargo may not impact upon actual physical
supplies until around the middle of 2012, which gives existing
customers of Iranian oil some time to line up alternative
supplies,” the Paris-based agency said in a statement received
by e-mail. The IEA “welcomes statements by key Gulf producers
that they will continue to meet existing and any incremental
demand from their customers,” it said.  The IEA requires that its 28 member nations maintain
emergency stockpiles in the event of a supply shock. Fatih Birol, the agency’s chief economist, said on Jan. 19 that there
is no reason to take any action to release inventories amid
concern that tensions over  Iran ’s nuclear program and sanctions
may disrupt exports of Middle East oil.  To contact the reporter on this story:
