The  University of Kentucky  regained
the top spot in the Associated Press college basketball poll
this week following  Syracuse University ’s first loss of the
season.  The Wildcats (19-1), who were ranked No. 1 for two weeks
earlier this season, received 61 of the 65 first-place votes. A
Final Four participant in last year’s National College Athletic
Association tournament,  Kentucky  lost its top ranking following
a Dec. 10 loss to  Indiana .  Missouri (18-1) is ranked second and Syracuse (20-1), which
lost 67-58 to Big East-rival Notre Dame on Jan. 21, is third.
Both the Tigers and Orange received two first-place votes. Ohio
State University (17-3) and the University of Kansas (16-3)
round out the Top 5.  Murray State University, at 20-0 the only undefeated team
left in the NCAA’s top division, moved up one spot to No. 11.
The Racers beat Memphis, then No. 21, on Dec. 11 in their only
game against a ranked opponent this season.  Florida State (13-6), which lost to the Ivy League’s
 Harvard University  and  Princeton University  this season, re-
entered the rankings at No. 23.  The Big Ten leads all conferences with five ranked teams --
Ohio State, No. 10 Michigan State (16-4), Indiana (16-4), No. 20
Michigan (15-5) and No. 25 Wisconsin (16-5).  To contact the reporter on this story:
