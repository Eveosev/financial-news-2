Olympus Corp. (7733) , the Japanese camera
maker that admitted an accounting fraud, rose the most in almost
two weeks in  Tokyo  trading after it was allowed to keep its
stock-market listing.  The shares gained 7.4 percent to 1,288 yen as of 10:04 a.m.
on the Tokyo Stock Exchange, after jumping as much as 9.6
percent, the biggest intraday advance since Jan. 10. The stock
was the largest gainer among members of  Japan ’s benchmark Nikkei
225 Stock Average, which slid 0.1 percent.  Olympus, the world’s biggest maker of endoscopes, was fined
10 million yen ($130,000) and told to submit annual reports on
efforts to improve management, the stock exchange said Jan. 20.
The exchange had put the Tokyo-based company on a watchlist to
be delisted last year after admitting to inflating fees to
advisers on the $2.1 billion acquisition of Gyrus Group Plc in
2008 and overpaying for three Japanese companies.  “Investors are reacting positively to the announcement,”
said  Mitsushige Akino , who oversees $600 million at Ichiyoshi
Investment Management Co. in Tokyo. “It’s also expected that
Olympus will now be able to make progress on capital alliance
talks.”  Olympus had been reeling since  Michael Woodford  blew the
whistle on inflated takeover costs after he was fired as chief
executive officer Oct. 14. The allegations forced the company to
reveal a 13-year, $1.7 billion scheme to conceal soured
investments dating back to the 1990s and raised concerns among
investors and lawmakers over Japan’s corporate governance rules.  To contact the reporter on this story:
