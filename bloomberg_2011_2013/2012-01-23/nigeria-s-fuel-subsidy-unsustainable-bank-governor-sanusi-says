The Nigerian government’s fuel
subsidies aren’t “sustainable” because they foment corruption
and deplete government coffers, central bank Governor Lamido Sanusi said.  Labor unions in  Africa ’s biggest oil producer began a
nationwide strike Jan. 9, shutting banks, businesses and ports,
as gasoline prices more than doubled from 65 naira ($0.40) a
liter after the government scrapped fuel subsidies. The strike
was suspended on Jan. 16 after President  Goodluck Jonathan 
restricted gasoline-price increases to 97 naira a liter.  The subsidies cost the government $8 billion last year,
equivalent to all the revenue it received from the oil industry,
Sanusi said today during a speech in  London . Gasoline costs
three times as much in neighboring countries, allowing residents
there to take the advantage of the price differences by crossing
the border to buy fuel and adding to expenses for the Nigerian
government, he said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
