Better Place LLC, a U.S. start up
developing charging stations, started its first commercial roll-
out with 100 electric cars to Israeli customers.  Better Place, founded by former  SAP AG (SAP)  executive Shai Agassi, is in partnership with Renault SA to build and operate
electric-car charging networks and battery-exchanging stations,
starting in  Israel (ILCO)  and then in Denmark.  “The first wave of electric cars is the ultimate proof
that the change is here,” Chief Executive Officer Moshe Kaplinsky of Better Place  Israel  said in an e-mailed statement.  The delivery process in Israel will be in stages, Better
Place said in yesterday’s statement.  Plug-in hybrids and all-electric vehicles have the
potential to make up 9 percent of auto sales in 2020, according
to Bloomberg New Energy Finance. That could rise to 22 percent
of sales by 2030, or four million vehicles.  To contact the reporter on this story:
