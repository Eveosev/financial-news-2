Belarus  gold reserves  rose to 1.21
million ounces in December from 1.028 million ounces in
November, according to data on the International Monetary Fund
website.  The Natsionalny Bank Respubliki Belarus bank has 1.2
million ounces of gold on its website for December.  “Gold reserves are replenished as a result of the central
bank purchasing gold” and receiving interest payments that are
converted into gold, Mikhail Zhuravovich, a spokesman for the
Natsionalny Bank Respubliki Belarus, said by phone from Minsk.
The value of the gold has gone up as  gold prices  climbed, he
said. The country’s central bank won’t comment on any future
gold purchases or why the gold was bought, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
