KiWi Power Ltd ., an electricity
demand-management company in London, has joined Britain’s
biggest project to help develop a smarter energy network.  “KiWi Power’s participation in this trial will help us to
understand how new commercial innovation may avoid the need to
physically upgrade the network,” Jim Cardwell, head of
regulation & strategy at Northern Powergrid Holdings Co., one of
the companies’ leading the smart grid trials, said in an e-
mailed statement.  The distribution company, which flows electricity to 3.8
million homes, won 26.8 million pounds ($41.6 million) from
Ofgem’s so-called Low Carbon Networks Fund for its network
project in northern England. The company is trialing new
agreements as part of its  Customer-Led Network Revolution . That
may save 8 billion pounds and 43 million metric tons of CO2 by
accelerating the use of renewable energy and demand response,
according to the e-mailed statement.  Britain is chasing a target to reduce  carbon emissions  to
34 percent below 1990 levels by 2020 and improve  energy
efficiency  to help curb costs for energy consumers. Changing use
of electricity can reduce power demand and limit the need to
build more cables, reducing costs and curbing carbon dioxide
emissions, a greenhouse gas blamed for  climate change .  The 54 million-pound project, backed by Centrica Plc’s
British Gas unit and Durham University, is known as the
Customer-Led Network Revolution. It will study the effects of
reducing energy consumption at times of peak demand, as well as
the use of solar panels, heat pumps and electric cars on the
power network.  To contact the reporter on this story:
