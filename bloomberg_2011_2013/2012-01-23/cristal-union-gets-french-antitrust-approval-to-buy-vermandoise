Cristal Union, a French sugar maker,
said it received antitrust approval to buy competitor Groupe
Vermandoise and create the country’s second-largest producer of
the sweetener.  France ’s Competition Authority approved the takeover
unconditionally on Jan. 20, Cristal Union, based in Villette-
sur-Aube, said today in an e-mailed statement. The authorization
will allow the transfer of control of Vermandoise to Cristal
Union “in the coming days,” the company said.  Tereos is the country’s biggest sugar producer.  To contact the reporter on this story:
