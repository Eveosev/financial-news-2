Washington (STOWA1)  state backers of a bill
to allow same-sex marriage may have enough votes in the
Legislature to become the seventh U.S. state to legalize the
practice.  State Senator Mary Margaret Haugen, a Democrat from Camano
Island, issued a  statement  yesterday saying she’d back the
measure, giving it the 25 votes needed to pass that chamber. The
Washington Senate has 49 members.  “My choice is to allow all men and women in our state to
enjoy the same privileges that are so important in my life,”
Haugen said in the statement. “I know this announcement makes
me the so-called 25th vote, the vote that ensures passage.”  The legislation was requested by Governor Christine Gregoire, 64, a Democrat who isn’t seeking re-election. The
proposal was already expected to pass the House, which is
controlled by her party, said Guy Bergstrom, a spokesman for
House Democrats.  New York lawmakers legalized the practice last year,
joining Massachusetts,  Connecticut , Iowa,  New Hampshire , Vermont
and the District of Columbia in granting same-sex couples the
right to marry, according to the governor’s office.  Haugen said she was swayed by an amendment to the bill that
would allow a church to refuse to marry a couple if it would
contradict religious doctrine.  To contact the reporter on this story:
