Japan’s  Topix (TPX)  Index edged higher for
a fifth day, its longest winning streak since September, after
rising U.S. home sales boosted investor confidence even as
Greece struggles to reach a deal with creditors on its debt.  Taiheiyo Cement Corp. (5233)  climbed 3.7 percent after Nomura
Holdings Inc. said demand will rise as the U.S. economic
recovery spurs construction.  Daiwa Securities  Group Inc. and
Dai-ichi Life Insurance Co. gained after Bank of America Merrill
Lynch raised the sector’s rating.  Olympus Corp. (7733) , which has lost
$4 billion in market value amid an accounting scandal, soared
8.2 percent after being allowed to keep its stock market listing.  Japan’s  Topix (TPX)  added 0.2 percent to 756.79 at the 3 p.m.
close in Tokyo, extending last week’s 2.8 percent advance. The
 Nikkei 225 Stock Average  was little changed at 8,765.90 today
after swinging betweens gains and losses.  “People are more willing to buy homes and the housing
market can help lift the whole  U.S. economy ,” said  Masaru Hamasaki , Tokyo-based chief strategist at Toyota Asset
Management Co., which oversees the equivalent of $24 billion.
The Greek negotiations are “an unpleasant topic and the fact
they are dragging on is of course a negative, but they have
until late March to resolve this.”  Futures on the  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index  fell 0.2 percent
today. The gauge added 0.1 percent in  New York  on Jan. 20,
erasing a loss in the final minutes of trading, as banks gained
and earnings reports from IBM Corp. and  Intel Corp . boosted
technology shares.  U.S. Housing  Japanese stocks advanced after  sales  of previously owned
U.S. homes rose for a third month in December to the highest
level since January 2011. The increase signals that the U.S.
housing market, which triggered the global recession, is
entering this year with positive momentum.  Taiheiyo Cement (5233)  gained 3.7 percent to 169 yen after Nomura
raised the stock price estimate for the cement maker to 200 yen
from 180 yen, maintaining its “buy” rating. The U.S. market
for the building material is poised to recover on rising demand
for new housing and infrastructure projects, the brokerage said
in a report dated Jan. 20.  Daiwa Securities (8601)  advanced 2.9 percent to 281 yen, while
Dai-ichi Life Insurance rose 2.8 percent to 83,400 yen after
Merrill Lynch boosted the sector rating to “ neutral” from
“underweight,” citing improving market conditions.  Olympus gained the most on the  Nikkei 225 (NKY) , jumping 8.2
percent to 1,297 after the Tokyo Stock Exchange allowed the
optics maker to keep its market listing. The bourse fined the
company 10 million yen ($130,000) and ordered it to submit
annual reports to improve management.  ‘There’s Still Time’  In  Europe , Greek officials and private creditors continued
negotiations on a deal that’s crucial to lowering the country’s
debt and freeing up a second round of international aid before
it faces a 14.5 billion-euro ($188 million) bond payment on
March 20. The two sides are struggling to agree on the  interest
rate  and maturity of new bonds, which would determine losses for
investors.  “They still have time,” Toyota Asset’s Hamasaki said.
“That means this isn’t going to weight too heavily on the
market.”  The  Topix (TPX)  tumbled 19 percent last year amid concern U.S.
growth is sputtering and Europe’s debt crisis will damage the
banking system, damping demand in two of  Japan ’s biggest export
markets. The decline has cut the price of shares on the index to
0.9 times book value. That compares with 2.1 times for the
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index in the U.S. and 1.4 times for the
Europe Stoxx 600 Index in Europe.  Exporters Fall  Exporters to Europe declined today after the shared
currency fell against the yen.  Canon Inc. (7751) , a camera maker that
depends on Europe for about a third of its sales, dropped 1.2
percent to 3,390 yen. Shimano Inc., a maker of bicycle parts
that counts the region as its biggest market, slid 0.9 percent
to 3,690 yen.  The euro weakened to as low as 98.92 yen today in Tokyo,
compared with 100.01 yen at the close of trading on Jan. 20,
cutting the value of Japanese companies’ sales to Europe. The
dollar fell to 76.92 yen today from 77.15 yen.  Oil companies  declined after crude prices dropped to a one-
month low.  Inpex (1605)  lost 1.8 percent to 506,000 yen and refiner JX
Holdings Inc. sank 2.8 percent to 460 yen.  To contact the reporter on this story:
