Georgia ’s cargo-transportation
industry’s growth slowed in 2011 as the former Soviet republic’s
ports handled less bulk freight.  Volume rose 1 percent to 48.9 million tons, slowing from an
increase of 7 percent in 2010, the prime minister’s office said
today in an e-mailed statement from the capital, Tbilisi. Total
seaport handling fell 2.4 percent to 22.1 million tons, with the
decline held back by a 32 percent gain in container numbers.  Road transport accounted for the largest share of the
country’s freight shipments, gaining 1.1 percent to 28.8 million
tons, the government said.  Transportation and communications accounted for 11 percent
of Georgia’s third-quarter gross domestic product, which grew by
an annual 7.5 percent, according to government statistics.  To contact the reporter on this story:
