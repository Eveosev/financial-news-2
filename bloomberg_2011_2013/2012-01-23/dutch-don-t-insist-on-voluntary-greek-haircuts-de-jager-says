Finance Minister  Jan Kees de Jager 
said the Dutch government has never insisted that bondholder
losses in a Greek debt swap be voluntary.  “We have never opposed a  credit event  or doing it in
another way than purely voluntary,” de Jager told reporters in
Brussels today before a meeting with his euro-area counterparts.
“For us it has never been an absolute condition to have it done
voluntarily. We hope that the banks contribute voluntarily.”  De Jager said it’s up to Greece and the banks to ensure
that the country’s debt load is sustainable. “I’m not going to
lend money if the risks regarding repayment are too large.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
