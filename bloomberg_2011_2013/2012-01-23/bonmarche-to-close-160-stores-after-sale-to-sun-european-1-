Bonmarche,  the U.K. clothing chain
owned by Peacock Group Plc, will close about 160 out of 390
stores after the retailer was sold to an affiliate of Sun
European Partners by administrators  KPMG  LLP.  The business will keep operating 230 outlets after the
transaction, securing about 2,400 of 3,800 jobs, the buyer said
today in an e-mailed statement.  KPMG had been seeking a buyer for Bonmarche since being
appointed this month as administrator to Peacock, which also
owns Peacock’s Stores Ltd., a U.K. budget clothing chain.
Peacock’s is the latest U.K. retailer to fall foul of a slump in
 consumer spending . Lingerie chain La Senza closed 84 stores and
18 concessions this month, while gift retailer Past Times said
last week it shut 46 outlets and appointed KPMG as
administrators.  Bonmarche caters to women aged over 45 and was acquired by
Peacock Group in 2002, 20 years after it was founded.  Sun European is “ confident in putting a sustainable
growth program in place and working with the management team to
develop the business successfully,” Vice President Matthias
Gundlach said in the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
