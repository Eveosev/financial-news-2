Italy ’s top Roman Catholic cardinal
said financial speculation has made politics “irrelevant” as
global investors dictate policy, weakening the sovereignty of
elected governments.  “When the highest, easiest and fastest profit is the goal,
then profit is no longer right, but becomes an end in itself by
playing with people’s lives,” Cardinal Angelo Bagnasco, head of
Italy’s Bishops Conference, told the group in a speech in  Rome 
today. “It’s not possible to live each day in the grip of
invisible iron hands, voluptuously lording over the world.”  At the same time, Bagnasco called on Italian political
parties to support efforts to overhaul the country’s economy and
crack down on rampant  tax evasion . “Tax evasion is a sin,” the
cardinal said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
