Former  New York  Jets offensive
coordinator Brian Schottenheimer was named to the same position
with the  St. Louis Rams .  The Rams also hired Gregg Williams as their defensive
coordinator, the team said in an e-mailed statement. Williams is
a former coach of the Buffalo Bills and previously led four
other National Football League defenses.  Jeff Fisher was named Rams coach this month, replacing
Steve Spagnuolo, who led the team to a 2-14 record this season.  Schottenheimer, 38, announced on Jan. 10 that he wouldn’t
return to the Jets for a seventh season leading their offense.
The Jets lost their last three games of the season to finish
with an 8-8 record and coach  Rex Ryan  was among those who
questioned the offensive play-calling.  Williams, 53, spent the last three seasons as the New
Orleans Saints’ defensive coordinator. He’s also held the
position with the Tennessee Titans, Washington Redskins and
Bills, where he was coach from 2001 to 2003, going 17-31.  To contact the reporter on this story:
