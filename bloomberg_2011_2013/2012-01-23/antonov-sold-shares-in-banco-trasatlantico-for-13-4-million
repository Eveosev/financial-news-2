Vladimir Antonov , a former  Bankas
Snoras AB (SRS1L)  shareholder, sold his stake in Banco Trasatlantico SA
to minority shareholders from Panama for $13.36 million.  Antonov sold his 14,000 shares, or 85.16 percent, in  Banco
Trasatlantico  in exchange for the bank’s investment portfolios
worth $13.36 million at Geneva-based financial firm  Multiassets
SA , according to a  filling  on the Panamanian banking regulator’s
website. The regulator, the Superintendency, authorized the sale
on Dec. 14.  Lithuanian authorities are trying to locate and freeze
assets by former Snoras shareholders and people related to them.
Antonov, who’s fighting extradition to Lithuania, was arrested
on Nov. 24 in  London  after Lithuanian authorities issued an
European arrest warrant over claims of fraud and embezzlement.
He denies any wrongdoing.  The Lithuanian central bank alleged that some missing
assets at Snoras may have been transferred to private accounts
of people related to former owners.  To contact the reporter on this story:
