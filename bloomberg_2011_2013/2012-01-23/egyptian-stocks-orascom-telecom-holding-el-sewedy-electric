Egypt ’s benchmark  EGX 30 Index 
climbed 2.4 percent, the most since Nov. 29, to 4,014.27 at the
2:30 p.m. close in Cairo.  The following were among the most-active equities on the
Egyptian Exchange today. Stock symbols follow company names.  El Sewedy Electric Co. (SWDY)   gained 0.8 percent to
22.09 Egyptian pounds, the highest since Dec. 15. Egypt’s
biggest publicly traded manufacturer of electric cables said one
of its units won a $59 million contract to sell and install
high-voltage cables in  Kuwait .  Orascom Telecom Holding SAE (ORTE)   surged for a second
day, gaining 9.2 percent to 2.86 pounds. Investors are
speculating the Cairo-based mobile phone company is undervalued
after it split into two entities.  “The stock is still seen as undervalued and there’s
speculation that a lot more value will be unlocked as the Djezzy
problem comes to an end,” said Ashraf Akhnoukh, senior equity
sales trader at Cairo-based Commercial International Brokerage.
Algeria signed an agreement to buy Orascom Telecom Holdings’
local unit, Djezzy.  Orascom Telecom Media and Technology Holding SAE , the
split-off entity, rose 2.2 percent to 92 piasters. The shares
lost 28 percent yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
