The  U.S. Supreme Court (1000L)  refused to
block an Ohio investor group from suing Venezuela over
potentially $900 million in bank notes that the South American
country says are forgeries.  The justices today turned away an appeal from Hugo Chavez’s
Venezuelan government, which sought to invoke a U.S. law that
immunizes foreign sovereigns from some lawsuits in American
courts. The  Supreme Court  acted after the Obama administration
urged rejection of the appeal.  The suit by DRFP LLC, which does business under the name
Skye Ventures, may be the first of several claims over the
disputed bearer bonds, according to Venezuela’s appeal.  The notes were allegedly issued in 1981 by the Banco de
Desarrollo Agropecuario, then a state-owned Venezuelan bank also
known as Bandagro.  The two Skye Ventures notes have a face value of $50
million apiece. The investor group said in 2010 that, with
interest, the bonds were worth as much as $900 million.  Skye Ventures says it acquired its two notes only after the
Venezuelan attorney general issued a 2003 opinion declaring them
valid. The investor group then demanded payment in Columbus.
When  Venezuela  refused, Skye sued.  A federal appeals court in Cincinnati ruled in 2010 that
Venezuela isn’t shielded by the U.S. Foreign Sovereign
Immunities Act. The court left open the possibility that
Venezuela could win dismissal of the case using a different line
of argument.  The case is Republica Bolivariana de Venezuela v. DRFP,
10-1144.  To contact the reporter on this story:
