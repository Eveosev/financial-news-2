The New York Giants’ 20-17 overtime
win over the  San Francisco  49ers drew the best preliminary
television rating for any National Football League conference
championship game since 1995.  The New England Patriots’ 23-20 win over the Baltimore
Ravens, which also was decided in the closing seconds, had the
highest rating for an afternoon American Football Conference
championship since 1994.  Yesterday’s Giants-49ers National Football Conference title
game at Candlestick Park in San Francisco was seen on Fox in
33.4 percent of homes in the top 56 U.S. television markets,
Ileana Pena, a spokeswoman for the  News Corp. (NWSA)  network, said in
an e-mail.  That makes it the highest-rated conference title game since
the 49ers beat the Dallas Cowboys 38-28 in January 1995, which
drew a major-market rating of 34.2.  The Giants’ victory drew an 11 percent better rating than
last year’s NFC championship between the  Green Bay Packers  and
 Chicago Bears , which earned a 30 rating while airing earlier in
the day.  New York topped the 49ers 7:54 into overtime on a 31-yard
field goal by  Lawrence Tynes . The kick came after the Giants
recovered a fumbled punt by Kyle Williams at the 49ers’ 24-yard-
line.  The Patriots’ 23-20 win over the Ravens earned a 29.1
major-market rating on CBS. That’s the highest such rating for
an afternoon AFC championship since a 1994 meeting between the
Kansas City Chiefs and Buffalo Bills that drew a 29.5, according
to CBS Corp.  Patriots Win  The Patriots won yesterday’s game after Baltimore kicker
Billy Cundiff missed a 32-yard field goal with 11 seconds left.  The Giants and Patriots will meet in the Feb. 5  Super Bowl 
in a rematch of the 2008 title game, which  New York  won 17-14.
Last year’s Super Bowl, won by the Packers over the Pittsburgh
Steelers, was the most-watched program in U.S. television
history, drawing an average of 111 million viewers.  The 2008 Super Bowl drew an average of 97 million viewers -
- at the time a record for the event -- and a 43.1 rating,
according to Nielsen Holdings NV.  To contact the reporter on this story:
