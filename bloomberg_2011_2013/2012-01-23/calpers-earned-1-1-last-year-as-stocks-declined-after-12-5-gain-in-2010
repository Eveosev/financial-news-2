The  California Public Employees’
Retirement System (32617) , the largest U.S. public pension, earned 1.1
percent in 2011 as its stock holdings slumped, said  Joe Dear ,
its chief investment officer.  Global stocks, which compose about half of the fund’s
assets, were down about 8 percent during the calendar year.
Private equity was up 12.4 percent, as were bonds, while real
estate returned almost 10 percent.  The earnings are down from 2010, when the $229.5 billion
 retirement plan  returned 12.5 percent. The  Standard & Poor’s  500
 index  of stocks returned 2.1 percent last year.  “The year was marked by extraordinary volatility,” Dear
said at a board meeting today in Monterey. “Overall, we eked
out a meager return.”  Rising retiree obligations are straining the budgets of
states such as  California  and cities across the U.S. still
grappling with income- and sales-tax revenue slammed by the
longest recession since the Great Depression. A weak recovery
has churned up a backlash against the pay and benefits of public
workers nationwide as taxpayers see their own job prospects and
401(k) retirement funds shrink.  Blunting Annual Swings  In the fiscal year ended June 30, Calpers earned 20.7
percent, its best result in 14 years, led by gains in stocks and
private equity. In the first six months of the current fiscal
year, the fund is down 4.5 percent, Dear told the board in a
report. Calpers assumes it will earn an average 7.75 percent
annually to meet its obligations.  The pension fund spreads losses and gains over 15 years to
blunt the impact that annual swings may have on the amount of
money it charges taxpayers to finance retirement benefits for
more than 1.6 million government workers and their families.  Calpers estimates that it has about 70 percent to 75
percent of the money it needs to cover benefits promised to
state and local public workers, said  Brad Pacheco , a spokesman.  That differs from a Stanford University  report  released in
December that said Calpers was only 58 percent funded. That
calculation was based on the fund realizing a 6.2 percent annual
return on investments, rather than the 7.75 percent rate used by
Calpers.  California’s pensions in 2010 had 80.7 percent of what they
needed to pay promised benefits, down from 86.6 percent in the
preceding year, according to an annual study by Bloomberg
Rankings. The median for all states was 74.6 percent.  California (STOCA1)  Governor  Jerry Brown  has proposed cost-cutting
reforms to the state’s public pensions, such as raising the
 retirement age  to 67 from 55 for most state employees,
forbidding abuses known as pension spiking and double dipping,
and adding two outsiders to the Calpers board.  To contact the reporter on this story:
