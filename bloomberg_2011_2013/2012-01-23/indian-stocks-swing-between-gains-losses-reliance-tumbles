Indian stocks held near a six-week
high on speculation the central bank may cut interest rates to
boost growth, and after some company earnings beat estimates.  Larsen & Toubro Ltd. , the nation’s largest engineering
company, and  Maruti Suzuki India Ltd. (MSIL) , the biggest carmaker,
erased losses after their earnings report.  ICICI Bank Ltd. (ICICIBC) , the
second-biggest lender, advanced for the third day.  Reliance
Industries Ltd. (RIL) , the owner of the world’s largest oil-refining
complex, fell the most in three weeks.  The BSE India  Sensitive Index (SENSEX) , or Sensex, rose 0.1 percent
to 16,751.73 at the 3:30 p.m. close in Mumbai, after changing
direction at least 30 times. Inflation slowed in December to a
two-year low after seven  interest-rate  increases in 2011 cooled
demand, giving the central bank scope to keep rates on hold for
a second straight meeting tomorrow. The Sensex lost 25 percent
last year on concern a falling rupee and high borrowing costs
will exacerbate the effects of the European crisis on earnings.  “Growth will bottom out and start improving, interest
rates will start to come down, the rupee has begun appreciating
and inflation has started cooling off,” Nilesh Shah, president
strategic initiatives at  Axis Bank Ltd. (AXSB)  in Mumbai, said in an
interview with Bloomberg UTV today. “This macro environment
will be positive for earnings going forward.”  The  Reserve Bank  may keep the benchmark repurchase rate at
8.5 percent tomorrow, all 21 economists in a Bloomberg survey
said. It raised the rate by a record 13 moves from March 2010
before pausing in December. While benchmark inflation slowed to
a two-year low of 7.47 percent last month, it is still higher
than the so-called BRIC nations.  Taming Inflation  “While everyone is saying that there should be a cut in
the interest rate, my feeling is that collectively the market
will be willing to give three-to-six months time to the Reserve
Bank before the actual cuts begins,” Axis’s Shah said. “ Core
inflation  is still running and it is too early to pronounce a
victory” over consumer-price increases, he said.  The S&P CNX  Nifty (NIFTY)  Index on the National Stock Exchange of
India Ltd. decreased 0.1 percent to 5,046.25. The  BSE 200 Index 
rose less than 0.1 percent.  Reliance, which has the biggest weighting on the Sensex,
retreated 2.7 percent to 771.55 rupees, halting a four-day, 11
percent rally. Profit fell 14 percent to 44.4 billion rupees
($884 million) in the December quarter as a global economic
slowdown curbed fuel demand. Earnings missed the 45.6 billion
rupee median estimate of 29 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  The company plans to buy back 120 million shares at 870
rupees each, for a total of as much as 104.4 billion rupees.  “Investors are disappointed with the results but we don’t
see a big fall due to the buyback announcement,” Alex Mathews,
head of research at Geojit BNP Paribas Financial Services Ltd.,
said by phone from Kochi.  ‘Worst Over’  Maruti Suzuki advanced 5.2 percent to 1,160.65 rupees,
reversing a slide of as much as 3 percent, after its earnings
report. Third-quarter profit plunged 64 percent to 2.06 billion
rupees, the smallest since the quarter ended September 2004 and
less than the 2.17 billion-rupee median of 32  analyst estimates 
compiled by Bloomberg.  “The worst is over and we will surely improve from these
levels,” Chief Financial Officer Ajay Seth told analysts today.  Larsen & Toubro, the biggest builder of power networks and
airports, added 0.2 percent to 1,277.3 rupees, reversing a fall
of as much as 3.8 percent. Third-quarter  profit  rose 18 percent
to 9.92 billion rupees, beating the 8.69 billion-rupee median of
23 analyst  estimates  compiled by Bloomberg.  Sterlite Industries (India) Ltd. , the nation’s biggest
copper producer, plunged 5.4 percent to 107.9 rupees after it
unexpectedly reported a 17 percent decline in third-quarter
profit because of higher costs, declining metal prices and a
foreign-exchange loss.  ‘Looking Backward’  Six out of 13 Sensex companies that have posted December
quarter earnings missed analyst estimates. Forty percent lagged
in the September quarter and 47 percent in the previous three
months. Forecasts for Sensex companies for the year to March
have declined 8.7 percent to 1,150 rupees per share, the most
since the year ended March 2009, the data.  “When analysts say that there will be no growth they’re
probably looking far more backward than forward,” said Axis’s
Shah. “At some point, analysts will start becoming positive and
start looking forward. That’s when the earnings upgrades can
occur. It can happen over the next six to 12 months.”  ICICI Bank climbed 1.7 percent to 856.75 rupees, extending
its three-day rally to 11 percent.  State Bank of India  gained
0.4 percent to 1,940.5 rupees, advancing for a tenth day.  Foreign  funds  bought a net $ 138.7 million  of Indian stocks
on Jan. 19, increasing their investment in equities so far this
year to $1.2 billion, data from the  regulator  show. They sold
$512 million of equities in 2011, compared with a record inflow
of $29.4 billion in 2010.  “Foreign funds have pumped in almost the double the amount
they withdrew last year and these kind of flows would not have
happened unless their outlook towards  India  has changed,” said
Axis’s Shah. “They are realizing that probably things in India
are not as bad as they sound and are putting money where their
mouths are.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
