Australia â€™s dollar was little
changed after a government report showed producer prices climbed
by 0.3 percent in the fourth quarter from the previous three-
month period, less than economists had forecast.  The Australian currency fetched $1.0462 at 11.32 a.m. in
Sydney from $1.0464 before the release and $1.0484 on Jan. 20 in
 New York .  The median projection in a Bloomberg News survey of
economists was for a gain in producer prices of 0.4 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
