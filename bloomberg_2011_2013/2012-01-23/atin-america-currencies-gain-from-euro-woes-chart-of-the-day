Latin American currencies are
beating their high-yielding European peers as improving U.S.
economic data benefits assets with links to the world’s largest
economy and sheltered from the euro-region debt crisis.  The CHART OF THE DAY shows that while the Colombian peso
has jumped 6.1 percent since Dec. 30 and the Chilean currency
gained 5.6 percent, the Swedish krona rose 1.6 percent and the
Norwegian krone advanced 0.9 percent. The MSCI World Index of
shares rallied 4.9 percent this year, spurring appetite for
riskier assets.  “The most interesting trend in 2012 is the strength of the
Latin American currencies,” said Bernd Berg, an emerging
markets currency strategist at Credit Suisse Group AG in Zurich.
“On the back of stronger U.S. data and a general reduction of
 risk aversion  in global markets they have significantly
outperformed European currencies which have been hit by the
impact of the sovereign debt crisis.”  Sweden  and Norway’s central bank interest rates are both at
1.75 percent, compared with 1 percent in the  euro zone  and zero
in the U.S. Chile’s benchmark rate is 5 percent, and  Colombia ’s
is 4.75 percent.  Swedish manufacturing shrank for a fifth month in December,
as the euro-region debt crisis crimped exports, a Swedbank AB
purchasing managers index showed on Jan. 2. U.S. initial jobless
claims slid to the lowest in almost four years, the Labor
Department said on Jan. 19.  To contact the reporter on this story:
