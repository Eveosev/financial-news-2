The  International Atomic Energy
Agency  is considering establishing a permanent office in
Fukushima in Japan, the site of the worst nuclear disaster since
Chernobyl in 1986, an IAEA official told reporters.  The Japanese government asked the IAEA to set up the office
and the request will be given “careful consideration,” James
Lyons, the agency’s nuclear installation safety director, said
at a news conference today in Tokyo.  He didn’t say how close the office would be located to
 Tokyo Electric Power Co. (9501) ’s Fukushima Dai-Ichi nuclear plant,
where three reactors had meltdowns after the March 11 earthquake
and tsunami.  To contact the reporter on this story:
