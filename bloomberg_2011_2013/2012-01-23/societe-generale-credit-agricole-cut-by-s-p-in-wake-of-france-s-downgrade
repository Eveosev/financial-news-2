Societe Generale SA (GLE)  and  Credit
Agricole SA (ACA)  were among French banks to have their credit grades
cut by Standard & Poor’s after France was stripped of its top
rating earlier this month.  Societe Generale and Credit Agricole’s ratings were
downgraded to A from A+, S&P said today in statements. Caisse
des Depots et Consignations was cut to AA+ from AAA.  European nations are grappling with a debt crisis now in
its third year as they seek to restore budget order. France lost
its AAA rating Jan. 13 amid downgrades that left Germany the
sole nation in the euro area with a stable rating that high.  “The downgrade of some of these banks follows the
downgrade of  France ,” S&P wrote in a statement today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
