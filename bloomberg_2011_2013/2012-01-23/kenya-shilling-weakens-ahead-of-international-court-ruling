Kenya ’s shilling depreciated for a
second day before a ruling by the  International Criminal Court 
on whether six Kenyans, including top politicians, will be tried
at The Hague.  The currency of East Africa’s biggest economy weakened as
much as 0.9 percent to 86.85 per dollar and traded 0.6 percent
lower at 86.55 at 12:24 p.m. in Nairobi.  “The weakening of the shilling is tied to market
nervousness over the ruling by the international criminal court,
with buyers seeking to buy dollars in advance,” Duncan Kinuthia
a dealer at Nairobi-based Commercial Bank of Africa Ltd., said
in a phone interview today.  The ICC is expected to decide today whether to confirm
crimes against humanity charges against the Kenyans, including
Finance Minister  Uhuru Kenyatta , for their alleged role in
spurring violence after a disputed presidential election in
2007-08.  The clashes killed 1,500 people, displaced 300,000 and
slowed growth in  East Africa ’s largest economy.  Tanzania’s shilling weakened for the first time in four
days against the dollar, declining 0.5 percent to 1,593 while
Uganda’s currency strengthened for a third day, gaining 0.4
percent to 2,385.  -- Editors: Peter Branton, Linda Shen  To contact the reporter on this story:
