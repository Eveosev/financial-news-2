The following companies had unusual
price changes in Chilean trading. Stock symbols are in
parentheses and prices are as of the close in Santiago.  The  Ipsa (IPSA)  index fell 0.7 percent to 4,248.17. The  MSCI Chile (MXCL) 
index retreated 0.2 percent to 2,435.62.  Cia. Sud Americana de Vapores SA  (VAPORES CC) fell 0.7
percent to 102.25 pesos.  Latin America ’s largest container
shipping company has lost 2.2 percent in the past two days since
it started to take orders for as many as 1 billion new shares as
part of a $1.2 billion capital increase.  Coca-Cola Embonor SA (EMBONOB)  (EMBONOB CC) advanced 1.2 percent to
860 pesos, the biggest increase in three weeks. Chile’s second-
largest Coca-Cola bottler reported Jan. 20 an 11 percent
increase in sales in the fourth quarter from a year earlier.  Multiexport Foods SA (MULTIFOO)  (MULTIFOO CC), a Chilean salmon
farmer, slid 1 percent 145.6 pesos. High levels of supply and
the prospect of lower European demand may lead to increased
competition in the U.S. salmon market, creating an unfavorable
outlook for Chilean farmers, El Mercurio reported today, citing
analysts at brokerages including IM Trust.  To contact the reporter on this story:
