European Union Economic and Monetary
Affairs Commissioner  Olli Rehn  said Greek talks with bondholders
should conclude “shortly.”  “The talks have been moving well on a technical level and
I’m certain we will take stock of the PSI talks concerning
 Greece ” in a meeting of euro-area finance ministers in Brussels
today, Rehn said. “I’m confident we can conclude negotiations
shortly, preferably in the course of this week.”  Rehn told reporters before the meeting that ministers will
assess the economic policies of the Italian and Spanish
governments, “which have both made significant progress.”  “Whereas last year was about containing the crisis, this
year will be the year when we need to resolve the debt crisis
and return to a path of sustainable growth,” Rehn said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
