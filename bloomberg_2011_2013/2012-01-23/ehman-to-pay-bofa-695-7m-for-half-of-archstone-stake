Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. (LEHMQ)  will
pay Bank of America Corp. $695.7 million for half of its stake
in real estate company Archstone, while Barclays Plc will get
$628.5 million for a smaller stake, according to a regulatory
filing. The payments will be reduced by certain expenses, Lehman
said.  The two banks together own 53 percent of Archstone, with
Bank of America holding a slightly larger piece. Lehman has said
this first purchase of 26.5 percent of Archstone from the banks
will be followed by a later purchase of their remaining stake.  To contact the reporter on this story:
