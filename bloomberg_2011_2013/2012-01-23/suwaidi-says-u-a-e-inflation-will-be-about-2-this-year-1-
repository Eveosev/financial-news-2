Governor Sultan bin Nasser al-Suwaidi expects an inflation rate
of about 2 percent this year.  “The sources of inflation in the U.A.E. are under
control,” he told reporters today in Muscat, Oman. “Real-
estate prices and rents are stable, so there’s no domestic
reason for it to rise.”  Annual  consumer-price inflation  was 0.2 percent in 2011
after hitting a high last year of 1.7 percent in June, according
to the National Bureau of Statistics. Inflation in the U.A.E.
will probably remain moderate because rents, which account for
40 percent of the inflation basket, are declining, the
 International Monetary Fund  said last May.  The IMF forecasts an annual average inflation rate of 2.5
percent in the Persian Gulf country this year, according to the
World Economic Outlook published in September.  Housing prices  fell 4.7 percent from a year earlier in
November, according to the statistics bureau.  To contact the reporter on this story:
