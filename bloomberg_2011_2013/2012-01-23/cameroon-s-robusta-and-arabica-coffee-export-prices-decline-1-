Prices for both robusta and arabica
coffee exports from Cameroon declined in the week through Jan.
22, according to the nation’s Cocoa and Coffee Board.  The average export price for robusta, which is used in
instant coffee and espresso, decreased 0.6 percent to 859  CFA
francs  ($1.70) a kilogram (2.2 pounds) from 864 francs a week
earlier, Richard Adzogo, an official at the Douala-based board’s
information department, said in a mobile-phone text message
today.  The price for arabica fell 9 percent to 2,317 francs per
kilogram, Adzogo said. Cameroon has shipped 36 metric tons of
arabica since the season began in October, according to the
board’s data. Robusta exports have reached 29,557 tons since the
December start of the harvest period.  To contact the reporter on this story:
