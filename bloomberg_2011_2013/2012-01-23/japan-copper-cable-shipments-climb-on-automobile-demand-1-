Japan ’s copper wire and cable
shipments increased 2.9 percent in December from a year earlier
as demand from the auto and construction industries climbed, an
industry group said.  Shipments, including exports and to the domestic market,
rose to 58,400 metric tons from 56,739 tons, the  Japanese
Electric Wire & Cable Makers’ Association  said in an e-mailed
statement today. Deliveries totaled 60,429 tons in November,
down 0.4 percent from a year earlier.  “Strong demand from the  auto industry  lent support and
pushed the data higher,” said Nobuyuki Goto, deputy general
manager at the association’s research department.  Shipments were little changed at 680,600 tons in 2011 from
680,941 tons in the previous year, the group said. Deliveries to
the auto and construction industries rose 21 percent and 4.3
percent in December, while shipments to the power, electric
machinery and exports areas fell 13 percent, 4.4 percent and 6.5
percent, it said.  The country’s output of copper and copper-alloy fabricated
products, including sheets and tubes, slumped 12 percent to
60,530 tons in December from a year ago, falling for a seventh
month as export demand slowed, the Japan Copper & Brass
 Association  said Jan. 20, citing preliminary data.  Output fell 4.9 percent to 824,500 tons in 2011 from a year
earlier, the association said. In December, production for
domestic consumption declined 8.2 percent to 52,038 tons, while
output for exports plunged 30.3 percent to 8,492 tons, it said.  Copper for three-month delivery was little changed at
$8,217 per ton on the London Metal Exchange at 1:04 p.m. Tokyo
time.  To contact the reporter on this story:
