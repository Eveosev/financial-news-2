The cost for European banks to
borrow in dollars held near the lowest level in more than five
months, according to a money-market indicator.  The three-month cross-currency  basis swap , the rate banks
pay to convert euro interest payments into dollars, was at 76
basis points below the euro interbank offered rate at 8:22 a.m.
in London, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. That’s the
lowest since Aug. 8.  The one-year basis swap was unchanged from Jan. 20 at 68.5
basis points less than Euribor, the lowest since Dec. 7. A basis
point is 0.01 percentage point.  A measure of banks’ reluctance to lend to one another in
 Europe  fell. The Euribor-OIS spread, the difference between the
borrowing benchmark and overnight index swaps, was at 84 basis
points from 85 on Jan. 20.  Overnight deposits  increased at the  European Central Bank ,
as lenders parked 492 billion euros ($636 billion) with the
Frankfurt-based ECB on Jan. 20, compared with 421 billion euros
the previous day.  To contact the reporter on this story:
