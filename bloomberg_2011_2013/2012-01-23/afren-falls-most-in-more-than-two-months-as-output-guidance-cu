Afren Plc (AFR) , the U.K. explorer focused
on Africa and the  Middle East , fell the most in more than a
month after lowering its output guidance for this year and
announcing delays to its project in  Iraqi Kurdistan .  The shares  declined 5.4 percent, the most since Dec. 14, to
117.9 pence in London. The stock is up 38 percent since the
start of the year.  Afren expects to pump 42,000 to 46,000 barrels of oil
equivalent a day this year, the London-based company said today
in a statement. The reduction “factors in downtime related to
ongoing development drilling at the Ebok field and possible
early drilling at Okoro East from the main field well-head
platform,” it said today on its  website . On Jan. 3 it announced
“net working interest production” of 55,400 barrels of oil
equivalent going into 2012.  The company now expects is Barda Rash field in Kurdistan to
start pumping in August, at least a month later from the
previous guidance of mid-2012 made in November.  “Even after the rally, we still see 34 percent upside
potential,” Stuart Joyner, an Investec Securities Ltd. analyst,
wrote in an e-mailed report. He cut Afren’s share-price estimate
to 167 pence from 192 pence mostly on the Barda Rash project
valuation.  Afren plans to invest from $450 million to $500 million in
projects this year, down from $550 million last year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
