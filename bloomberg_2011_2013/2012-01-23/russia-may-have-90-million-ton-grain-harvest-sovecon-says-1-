Russia ’s grain harvest may reach 90
million metric tons in 2012, SovEcon said.  “Such a crop is not bad,” Andrei Sizov Jr., managing
director of the Moscow-based agriculture researcher, said today
by phone in the Russian capital today. “The figure is an early
estimate, not the forecast, given the weather develops
normally.”  The estimate is based on the assumption that about 14.6
million hectares (36.1 million acres) of fields will produce
good winter crops this year, Sizov said. Russian farmers planted
15.1 million hectares with winter grains in 2011.  Winter crop loss was estimated at about 6 percent at the
end of 2011, Sizov said. SovEcon will give this year’s crop
forecast in early March, after the government releases data on
actual winter crop losses, he said.  In 2011, Russia harvested 93.9 million tons of grains after
drying and cleaning and can export about 25 million tons,
according to Agriculture Ministry data. Grain exports are
nearing 20 million tons, SovEcon  said  today on its website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
