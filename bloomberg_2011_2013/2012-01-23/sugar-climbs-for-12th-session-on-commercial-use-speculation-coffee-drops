Arabica-coffee futures fell the most
in a week on signs of increasing worldwide supplies. Sugar and
cocoa prices rose.  Global coffee output will be 132.4 million bags in the
season that started in October, up 3.8 million bags from the
December estimate, the  International Coffee Organization  said
last week. Harvests are accelerating in Central America,
Hernando de la Roche, the director of futures at INTL FCStone in
Miami, said in a telephone interview. A bag weighs 60 kilograms,
or 132 pounds.  Producers “have coffee to sell against March and May
futures, and the industry may be waiting for prices to fall
further” before buying, de la Roche said.  Arabica coffee for March delivery fell 2.6 percent to
settle at $2.1945 pound at 2 p.m. on ICE Futures in New York,
the biggest drop for a most-active contract since Jan. 13. The
commodity has declined 3.3 percent in January.  The market has been unable “to hold onto anything to the
upside,” Drew Geraghty, a broker at ICAP Futures LLC in  Jersey
City ,  New Jersey , said in a telephone interview. “There seems
to be short selling from funds,” or bets that prices will drop,
he said.  Raw-sugar futures for March delivery rose 0.3 percent to
24.96 cents a pound in New York. The price advanced for the
sixth straight session, the longest rally since November 2010.
The commodity has climbed 7.1 percent in January.  On NYSE Liffe in  London , refined-sugar futures rose for the
12th straight session, the longest rally since 1989.  Cocoa futures for March delivery advanced 0.4 percent to
$2,269 a metric ton in New York. The price has climbed 7.6
percent this month.  In London, robusta-coffee futures and cocoa dropped.  To contact the reporter on this story:
