Iran  can shut the  Strait of Hormuz 
and won’t let the West undermine its national interest with
sanctions, Press TV said, citing lawmaker Heshmatollah
Falahatpisheh.  Iran has a “right” to shut down Hormuz, the Persian Gulf
passageway for about 20 percent of globally traded oil, and the
U.S. is aware that it won’t be able to control global
developments that may lead to such an action, Falahatpisheh  said 
today, Press TV reported.  European Union foreign ministers agreed today to ban oil
from Iran starting on July 1 and petrochemical imports as of May
1, and to freeze central bank assets, to put pressure on the
country’s nuclear program. President  Barack Obama  signed a bill
on Dec. 31 tightening sanctions on Iran by denying access to the
U.S. financial system to any foreign bank that conducts business
with the Central Bank of Iran.  “Tehran will not grin and bear it when its interests are
undermined,” Alaeddin Boroujerdi, a lawmaker who heads the
national security and foreign policy committee in Iran’s
capital,  said  yesterday, according to Press TV.  To contact the reporter on this story:
