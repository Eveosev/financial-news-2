Connecticut (STOCT1) , which had its general-
obligation bond rating cut last week, will raise its pension
contributions to save $5.8 billion through the next two decades,
Governor Dannel Malloy said.  The stepped-up payment rate is intended to avoid a one-time
obligation estimated at $4.5 billion in fiscal 2032, Malloy said
yesterday in a statement. The sum, about four times the state’s
annual contribution in recent years, was projected based on
continuing along that path.  “What we’re announcing today is basically like starting a
401(k) when you’re young, and getting some of the work done
earlier,” said Malloy, a Democrat elected in 2010. He said the
changes will boost the state’s annual payment by $125 million.
Benjamin Barnes, secretary of the policy and management office,
said by telephone that the change won’t increase workers’ costs.  In 2014, Malloy’s plan calls for an additional
appropriation to bring the State Employee Retirement System up
to the 80 percent funded level, generally regarded as a
benchmark minimum, by 2025. The 56-year-old governor’s plan also
calls for eliminating provisions of labor contracts that were
used to cut the government’s payment by more than $105 million
in fiscal 2011, according to a state report in October 2010.  Low Funding Ratio  Connecticut ’s main pension fund, covering about 40,000
workers, has less than 48 percent of the assets needed to meet
future obligations, according to the statement. The state had
the second-widest gap between assets and liabilities, based on
2010 information, trailing only  Illinois , according to data
compiled by Bloomberg in October. The ranking put Connecticut at
about 53 percent funded, with Illinois at 45 percent. The
average level was about 74 percent.  Moody’s Investors Service cut Connecticut’s general-
obligation bond rating to Aa3 from Aa2 on Jan. 20, citing debt
costs and retirement benefits that are consuming a rising share
of the budget. The reduction to the company’s fourth-highest
grade affected about $14.6 billion in debt, Moody’s said.  Malloy, who raised income taxes the most in state history
last year, said last week that receipts haven’t met estimates,
leading to a projected shortfall of $94.9 million for the
current fiscal year and $139 million in 2013.  To contact the reporter on this story:
