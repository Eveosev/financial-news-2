Denmark-based fund that manages about $25 billion, plans to
invest $370 million in farmland globally, said Jens Henrik
Staugaard Johansen, a portfolio manager.  “We plan to make the commitment by April 2012,” Johansen
said today at a conference in  New York . “We will look at owning
and operating the farmlands.”  The fund is looking at acquiring farmland in Africa, the
Oceania region,  Latin America  and Central and Eastern Europe,
Johansen said. Pensionskassernes manages funds on behalf of
pension funds with 250,000 members.  To contact the reporter on this story:
