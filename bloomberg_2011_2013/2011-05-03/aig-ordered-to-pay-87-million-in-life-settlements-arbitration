American International Group Inc. (AIG) , the
bailed-out U.S. insurer, was ordered by an arbitration tribunal
to pay $86.7 million to Lonsdale LLC in a dispute over life
settlements.  AIGâ€™s Lexington Insurance Co. was in breach of contract,
Leo Milonas and Edward Panelli of the American Arbitration
Association Commercial Arbitration Tribunal said in a decision
last month. Diane Nergaard, of the Tribunal, dissented.  The Wall Street Journal reported the decision on New York-
based AIG earlier.  To contact the reporter on this story:
