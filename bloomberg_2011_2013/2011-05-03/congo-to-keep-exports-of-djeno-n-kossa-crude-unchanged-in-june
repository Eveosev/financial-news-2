The Republic of the Congo plans to
keep exports of its Djeno and N’Kossa crude unchanged in June,
according to loading programs obtained by Bloomberg News.  The June program comprises six Djeno and two N’Kossa
shipments, unchanged from May, the plans showed.  Chad  will export four cargoes of Doba crude in June, while
 Ghana  will ship two Jubilee consignments, according to the
schedules. All grades are 950,000 barrels each except Djeno,
which is 920,000 barrels per shipment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
