Asia gasoline advanced for an eighth
day, the longest rising streak since December, on signs U.S.
demand is recovering. Brightoil Petroleum Holdings Ltd. bought
 fuel-oil  cargoes in Singapore, the region’s biggest oil-trading
center.  Light Distillates  Benchmark 92-RON gasoline increased 0.5 percent to $136.85
a barrel, the highest since July 16, 2008, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. Prices climbed 13 percent last month.  Open-specification naphtha for delivery to  Japan  gained 0.1
percent to $1,094 a metric ton, Bloomberg data showed. The
premium of Japan-delivered naphtha to Brent, or the crack
spread, increased to $158.58 a ton from $150.07 at the end of
Asian trading April 29.  Gasoline’s premium to naphtha rose 50 cents to $17.30 a
barrel today from April 29. A wider reforming margin signals
that the profit from making gasoline over naphtha is increasing.
There was no trading on the Platts pricing system in  Singapore 
yesterday because of a public holiday.  Royal Dutch Shell Plc bought 50,000 barrels of 97-RON
gasoline for loading May 23 to May 27 from Trafigura Beheer BV
at $142.50 a barrel.  Shell purchased 50,000 barrels of 97-RON for loading May 18
to May 22 from PetroChina Co. at $143 a barrel and a second 97-
RON cargo for the same loading period from Total SA at $143 a
barrel.  ConocoPhillips sold 50,000 barrels of 95-RON gasoline for
loading May 18 to May 22 to Vitol Group at $138.50 a barrel.  U.S. gasoline supplies were probably unchanged at 205.6
million barrels after sliding for 10 weeks to the lowest level
since August 2009 in the period ended April 22, a Bloomberg News
survey showed.  Fuel Oil  Benchmark 180-centistoke fuel oil gained 25 cents to
$683.50 a ton, according to Bloomberg data. The price of 380-
centistoke fuel oil, mainly used as marine fuel, was up $1.50,
or 0.2 percent, at $673.50.  In Singapore, Brightoil Petroleum bought four cargoes of
180-centistoke fuel oil from BP Plc, traders said. The company
paid $2 a ton over benchmark quotes for two cargoes and $683.50
and $684 a ton for the rest. It also purchased 20,000 tons of
380-centistoke grade from PetroChina at a premium of $2.50. All
the cargoes are for loading from May 18 to May 22.  Fuel oil’s discount to Dubai crude narrowed for the first
time in a week to $12.45 a barrel, based on Bloomberg data. A
narrowing gap signals losses from turning oil into residual
products are decreasing.  The premium of 180-centistoke fuel oil to 380-centistoke
grade lost $1.25 to $10 a ton, Bloomberg data showed. This
viscosity spread is at the narrowest since April 6.  Middle Distillates  Gasoil, or diesel, with 0.5 percent sulfur declined 25
cents, or 0.2 percent, to $138.35 a barrel, according to
Bloomberg data.  Jet fuel  dropped 40 cents, or 0.3 percent, to
$139.95. Each product decreased for a second day.  In Singapore, Hin Leong Trading Pte bought 150,000 barrels
of 0.5 percent sulfur gasoil from Shell for a second day, paying
parity to benchmark quotes, traders said. Shell purchased a
similar-sized gasoil cargo with 500 parts-per-million of sulfur
from Vitol Group at $2.20 a barrel over quotes, up from a $2
premium it paid on April 28.  Gasoil’s premium to Asian benchmark Dubai crude rose 99
cents to $20.47 a barrel at 5:30 p.m. Singapore time, based on
data from PVM Oil Associates, a broker. This crack spread, a
measure of refining profit, climbed the most since March 15.  Jet fuel’s premium to gasoil was unchanged after rising on
April 29 to $1.55 a barrel, PVM said. This regrade widened 72
percent last month, indicating it was more profitable to produce
 aviation fuel  over diesel.  Hin Leong bought 100,000 barrels of jet fuel from China
Aviation Oil Singapore Corp. at parity to benchmark quotes,
traders said. Last week’s eight transactions were at a premium
of 20 cents.  To contact the reporters on this story:
