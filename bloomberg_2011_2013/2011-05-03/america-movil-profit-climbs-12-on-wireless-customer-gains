America Movil  SAB, the largest
wireless carrier in the Americas, said first-quarter profit
climbed 12 percent as mobile-phone subscriber additions topped
analysts’ estimates.  Total wireless subscribers reached 231 million with the
addition of 5.87 million in the quarter, compared with the 5.1
million average estimate of five analysts polled by Bloomberg.
The gains included 1.8 million users in Brazil and 1.5 million
in Mexico.  America Movil, controlled by billionaire  Carlos Slim , is
offering free smartphones in  Mexico  and  Brazil , its two largest
markets, to encourage users to spend more for wireless data
service. Earnings held up well even with the handset discounts
and other costs associated with acquiring users, said Gregorio Tomassi, an analyst at Banco Santander SA in  Mexico  City.  “They were able to maintain Ebitda even with the net
additions as high as they were,” said Tomassi, who recommends
buying the shares, in a phone interview from Mexico City. He was
referring to earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and
amortization, a measure of profit.  Tomassi had expected wireless subscriber additions of 4.4
million, including 1.2 million in Brazil.  America Movil fell 1.07 pesos, or 3.3 percent, to 31.5
pesos at 4 p.m. New York time in Mexico City trading. The shares
have fallen 11 percent this year.  Net income rose to 23.5 billion pesos ($2.04 billion) from
21 billion pesos a year earlier, Mexico City-based America Movil
said yesterday. Sales rose 6.3 percent to 156.2 billion pesos.  Ebitda, Profit Margin  Ebitda was 62.1 billion pesos, 1 percent below Tomassi’s
forecast. Profit margin, measured with Ebitda, was 39.8 percent,
compared with 42.4 percent a year earlier.  “I liked the subscriber additions, but I didn’t like the
Ebitda,” said Martin Lara, an analyst at Corp. Actinver SAB in
Mexico City.  Ebitda margin in  Brazil  fell to 28.5 percent from 33.9
percent. Increased spending on advertising and costs to acquire
new subscribers contributed to the decline, Chief Executive
Officer Daniel Hajj said today on a conference call. Programming
costs for the company’s Brazilian satellite-TV business also cut
into profit and should subside as more customers sign up, he
said. The company had 1.4 million Brazilian satellite TV users,
up from 440,000 a year earlier.  “Our main focus in Brazil today is growth,” Hajj said.  New Competition  The Mexican Ebitda margin dropped to 52.5 percent from 54
percent because of a 10 percent decline in the fixed-line unit,
Telefonos de Mexico SAB. The wireless business can keep margins
at more than 50 percent this year, Hajj said.  America Movil has maintained market share of 25 percent in
Brazil for the past year, second place behind Vivo Participacoes
SA’s 29 percent, according to regulator Anatel. Two other
companies, Tim Participacoes SA and Tele Norte Leste
Participacoes SA, have market share of at least 19 percent,
creating a competitive industry.  While America Movil has 71 percent of Mexico’s market, it
is facing new competition there. Telefonica SA and NII Holdings
Inc. are introducing high-speed Internet plans, and broadcaster
Grupo Televisa SA is entering the market by acquiring half of
Grupo Iusacell SA.  Mexican customers paid an average of 160 pesos a month,
down 2.7 percent from a year earlier, even as their minutes of
airtime increase 8.1 percent to 217, according to the filing
with Mexico’s stock exchange. In Brazil, clients paid 18 reais
($11) a month, 10 percent less than a year earlier, and airtime
minutes dropped 2.4 percent to 90.  Mexican revenue, including sales from the Telmex fixed-line
unit, represented 40 percent of America Movil’s sales, while the
Brazilian mobile and fixed-line businesses made up about 25
percent.  America Movil may be ready to start introducing fourth-
generation, or 4G, wireless service next year to provide faster
Web download speeds to customers in some countries, Hajj said.  (The company held a conference call earlier today. To
