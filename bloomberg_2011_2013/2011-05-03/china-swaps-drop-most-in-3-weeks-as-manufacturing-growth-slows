China ’s interest-rate swaps dropped
the most in three weeks after manufacturing growth slowed in
April, spurring speculation policy makers will have less of a
need to rely on interest-rate increases to cool the economy.  The Purchasing Managers’ Index was at 52.9, from 53.4 in
March, China’s logistics federation and the statistics bureau
said on May 1. Swap contracts fell from a one-week high as the
People’s Bank of China said it kept the yield on one-year bills
unchanged in an auction at 3.3058 percent for a fourth week.  “The smaller PMI figure prompted the market to speculate
that space for further interest-rate hikes will be limited,”
said  Frances Cheung , a senior strategist at Credit Agricole CIB
in  Hong Kong .  The one-year interest-rate swap contract, the fixed cost
needed to receive the floating seven-day repurchase rate,
dropped three basis points to 3.43 percent as of 10:41 a.m. in
 Shanghai , according to data compiled by Bloomberg. That was the
biggest decline since April 12. China’s financial markets were
closed for a holiday yesterday.  The seven-day repurchase rate, which measures interbank
funding availability, gained two basis points to 2.96 percent,
according to a weighted average rate compiled by the National
Interbank Funding Center.  The central bank sold 52 billion yuan ($8 billion) of one-
year bills and 33 billion yuan of 28-day  repurchase agreements ,
according to a statement on its website today.  The yield on the 3.83 percent government bond due March
2021 dropped two basis points to 3.85 percent, according to the
Interbank Funding Center. A basis point is 0.01 percentage
point.  -- Judy Chen . Editors: Ven Ram, Judy Chen  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
