The death of Osama  bin Laden  is a
“tremendously important step” because the al-Qaeda leader was
a symbol who attracted funds for the terror group, a U.S.
Treasury official said.  Bin Laden was “a symbol that was helpful in raising
money,”  David Cohen , the Obama administration’s nominee for
Treasury undersecretary for terrorism and financial crimes, told
the Senate Banking Committee today. “But our assessment is that
it’s by no means the end of the road in terms of going after the
financing.” Cohen, 47, has been assistant secretary for
terrorist financing.  Cohen said the U.S. has been working with Gulf region
governments “to identify the networks where the money is raised
and money is moved into  Pakistan , and it has really put a fair
amount of pressure, financial pressure on al-Qaeda.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
