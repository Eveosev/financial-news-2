The world’s population is likely to
grow to 10.1 billion by the end of this century, from the
current total of about 7 billion, according to the first United
Nations forecast for the year 2100.  The projection has “serious implications” for the ability
to provide food, water, energy, education and employment for
millions of people in the world’s poorest nations, according to
Hania Zlotnick, director of the population division of the UN
Department of Economic and Social Affairs, which released the
report today in  New York .  “Much of this increase is projected to come from the high-
fertility countries, which comprise 39 countries in  Africa , nine
in  Asia , six in Oceania and four in  Latin America ,” the report
said.  The UN presented three scenarios, including a less likely
“high projection variant” that foresees an increase in the
world population to 10.6 billion in 2050 and 15.8 billion in
2100. The lowest projection, also considered unlikely, is based
on a reduction in the global birth rate and foresees a decline
in the world population to 6.2 billion in 2100.  “We are raising the alarm that even though the population
of the world has reduced its growth rate enormously, current
growth rates are too high,” Zlotnick said. “And you could have
even more billions than our most likely scenario. That is where
we see a danger.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
