Prestbury Investment Holdings Ltd.,
the vehicle of U.K. real-estate entrepreneur Nick Leslau, may
have offered last week to buy the St. Katharine Docks marina and
office complex near the Tower of  London  for 167.5 million pounds
($278 million), the London-based Times reported, without saying
where it got the information.  Leslau, who confirmed that he’s “expressed serious
interest” in the complex “on the right terms,” is in talks
with F&C Reit Asset Management and AREA Property Partners LP,
which manage St. Katharine Docks on behalf of investors, the
newspaper reported.  Redevelopment proposals have been blocked by the local
authority in the past, amid strong protests by the marina’s
residents and neighbors, the Times said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
