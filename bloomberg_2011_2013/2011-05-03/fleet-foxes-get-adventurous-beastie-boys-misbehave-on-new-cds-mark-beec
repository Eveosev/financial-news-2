Fleet Foxes’ second album,
“Helplessness Blues,” demonstrates even more polish and
assurance than its predecessor.  The title is meant as a joke, though there’s serious stuff
going on. Songwriter  Robin Pecknold’s  separation from his
girlfriend inspires the eight-minute “The Shrine/An Argument.”
The track veers off into free-form jazz.  There’s less of the May Day paeans to birdsong and summer
sunshine this time around, while the harmonies remain an
inspired mix of Baroque, Beach Boys and Crosby, Stills and Nash.
The lyrical sweep is clear from titles such as “Bedouin Dress”
and “Montezuma.”  Pecknold used his  credit card  to pay for the first album’s
recording. He was happy if the music pleased just himself and
friends. The 2008 disc shone out amid the mediocrity in my
review pile and I gave it a top-star rating. This latest CD
should please more than a few chums in  Seattle  -- if you like
 Arcade Fire , you’ll want it. Rating: *****.  With a name like the Beastie Boys, you may wonder if the
trio is ever going to grow up and get manners.  The boys certainly don’t on their eighth studio collection.
They urge the world to party hard, make noise, upset the
neighbors and rock da house -- the same clarion calls the group
has been making for 30 some years.  The record was going to be called “Hot Sauce” until it
was delayed by a cancer scare for Adam “MCA” Yauch. Now
cheekily retitled “Hot Sauce Committee Part Two,” it has
humor. Hip-hop star Nas is featured on a track called “Too Many
Rappers.” Ad-Rock declares: “Oh, my God, just look at
me/Grandpa been rapping since ‘83!” Rating: ****.  After several years on side projects, producing and
soundtracking, members of Brooklyn indie group TV on the Radio
have found time to make “Nine Types of Light.”  This is a more accessible affair than 2008’s “Dear
Science.” They yell “I’m optimistic, on overload” on the
track “Caffeinated Consciousness.”  The band canceled shows after the death last month of
bassist  Gerard Smith , who had  lung cancer . This record is a fine
memorial to him. Rating: ***.  Damon Albarn’s group Gorillaz put together an album called
“The Fall” over 32 days while touring from  Montreal  to
 Vancouver  last year. The material was offered to members of the
Gorillaz fan club as a download on Christmas Day 2010, and is
now a physical release for the rest of us. It’s more inventive
than most other records in the charts, yet still not a patch on
the exceptional “Plastic Beach.” Rating: ***.  The members of London quartet the Vaccines are
frighteningly sure of themselves, titling their debut “What Did
You Expect From the Vaccines?”  The 33-minute disc doesn’t sustain the momentum of the
riotous single “Wreckin’ Bar (Ra Ra Ra)” though it’s packed
with catchy riffs that sound like imitations of the Strokes.
Rating: **.  The Fleet Foxes’ CD is on Bella Union/Sub Pop, Beastie Boys
on Capitol, TV on the Radio on Fiction/Polydor, Gorillaz on
Parlophone. The CDs are priced from $8.99 in the U.S. and 9.99
pounds in the U.K.  The Vaccines CD is out May 31 on Columbia in the U.S.,
priced at $13.24. Download fees vary across services.  Information:  http://www.tvontheradio.com/splash/ ,
