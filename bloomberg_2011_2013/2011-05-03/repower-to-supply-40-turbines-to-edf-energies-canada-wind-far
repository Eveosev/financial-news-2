Repower Systems AG (RPW) , the Hamburg-based
unit of  Suzlon Energy Ltd. (SUEL) , will deliver, install and maintain
40 turbines at a Quebec wind project being developed by EDF
Energies Nouvelles Canada Inc.  Construction of the 80-megawatt Saint-Robert-Bellarmin wind
park will start this summer at a site between Lac-Megantic and
Saint-Georges-de-Beauce, Repower said today in a  statement .
Repower will provide its MM92 CCV model, it said.  The contract is the second part of an agreement that
Repower signed with the unit of  EDF Energies Nouvelles SA (EEN) , a
French producer of clean electricity, for as many as 954
megawatts in November 2009. Repower declined to disclose the
financial details when contacted by phone.  The wind farm was one of the projects chosen after
government-owned Hydro-Quebec opened bidding for the
installation of 2,000 megawatts of wind energy, according to the
statement.  Repower said in the same statement that it signed a
contract to supply 15 turbines to two wind projects in Ontario
by  Wind Works Power Corp. (WWPW) , a developer of wind farms in the
U.S., Germany and Canada.  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
