1,677.01, its lowest level in two weeks.  Grupo Aval Acciones y Valores (AVAL)  SA, Colombia’s
biggest financial holding company, fell for a second day, by 1.1
percent to 1,330 pesos as investors awaited delayed results of
the company’s share issue, said Mauricio Restrepo Del Toro,
research director at brokerage Bolsa y Renta.  Grupo Nutresa SA (NUTRESA CB), Colombia’s largest food
producer, formerly known as Grupo Nacional de Chocolates, fell
0.8 percent to 22,520 pesos. Cost of goods sold were higher-

in an e-mailed report today.  Textiles Fabricato Tejicondor SA (FABRI)  , Colombia’s
biggest textile maker, rose for a second day to the highest in

free trade agreement with the U.S. and Venezuelan payments of
overdue debt, said Carlos Esteban Santiago, analyst at Alianza
Valores SA.  The stock gained 4.4 percent to 47.4 pesos, the biggest
gain in almost a month.  Oil companies  dropped as crude oil fell for a second day as
the dollar strengthened on concern the death of  Osama bin Laden

company , fell 1.6 percent to 3,780 pesos.  Pacific Rubiales (PREC CB) fell 0.9 percent to 52,640
