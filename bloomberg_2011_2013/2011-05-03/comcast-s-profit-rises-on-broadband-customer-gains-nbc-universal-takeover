Comcast Corp. (CMCSA) , the largest U.S. cable
company, reported an increase in first-quarter revenue and
profit with the addition of broadband subscribers and the
completion of a deal for control of NBC Universal.  Net income was $943 million, or 34 cents a share, compared
with $866 million, or 31 cents, a year earlier, the company said
in a statement today. Revenue rose to $12.1 billion, from $9.2
billion a year ago, when it didn’t control NBC Universal.  Comcast, based in Philadelphia, added 639,000 new Internet,
video and voice subscribers, an 8.3 percent increase from a year
earlier. The company added 418,000 high-speed Internet
subscribers and lost 39,000 video subscribers, less than the
123,000 loss projected by  Matthew Harrigan , an analyst at
Wunderlich Securities in Denver,  Colorado .  “The video losses were a big improvement,” said Harrigan.
“Overall subscribers was also a really good number.”  NBC Universal  made up about 30 percent of Comcast’s revenue
for the quarter. NBC’s revenue was $4.35 billion compared with
$4.92 billion a year ago. Excluding the Olympics, which brought
in $782 million in the first quarter of 2010, NBC revenue rose
5.2 percent. Revenue from Comcast’s cable assets was $9.08
billion, a 5.8 percent increase from a year ago.  Revenue from cable networks, including Bravo, CNBC and
 MSNBC , rose 13 percent to $2.02 billion. Ratings increased for
all cable stations other than USA, said Tom Eagan, an analyst at
Collins Stewart LLC in  New York . Broadcast television revenue
was $1.35 billion, down from $2.08 billion when results included
the Olympics.  NBC Value  “Bondholders can take a lot of comfort in the results,”
said  Joel Levington , a managing director in New York at
Brookfield Investment Management Inc., in an e-mail. “We
believe that Comcast is very well positioned within its credit
ratings.”  Comcast is rated Baa1 by Moody’s Investors Service and an
equivalent BBB+ by  Standard & Poor’s .  This is the first time Comcast has released a detailed
outline of NBC’s financials. The market hasn’t correctly priced
in the studio and network assets of NBC to the valuation of
Comcast shares, according to Harrigan.  “When the deal was announced, I think a lot of analysts
gave NBC-U a stale valuation,” said Harrigan. “I think it’s
worth well north of $40 billion at this point.”  Comcast and  General Electric Co. (GE)  said the assets of NBC
Universal were valued at $30 billion when the deal was announced
on Dec. 3, 2009. Media companies have “significantly”
increased in value since then, said Harrigan.  Comcast fell 7 cents to $26.61 at 4 p.m. in Nasdaq Stock
Market trading. Shares have risen 21 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
