German power for next-day delivery
advanced to its highest level this year as production from wind
was forecast to remain below average through at least May 13 and
reactor halts cut capacity in  Europe ’s biggest market.  Output from  wind turbines , a less predictable source of
energy than nuclear, coal or gas-fired generation, will decline
tomorrow to about 3,000 megawatts from almost 4,000 megawatts
today, Berlin-based  Markedskraft Deutschland GmbH  said in an e-
mailed report. The average for this time of year is 6,000
megawatts. Wind produced 6.8 percent of Germany’s power in 2009.  Prices are also gaining as utilities halt nuclear reactors
for regular maintenance after the government in March ordered
the closure of the country’s oldest plants. E.ON AG closed its
Grohnde reactor yesterday until May 28 and RWE AG on May 1 shut
its Gundremmingen B reactor until at least May 23.  “We are expecting an increasing impact of the maintenance
periods in  Germany  and  France  these days, which is adding upward
price pressure to the current market situation,” analysts at
Markedskraft said today in the report.  Baseload day-ahead electricity gained 1.85 euros, or 3.1
percent, to 61.85 euros ($92) a megawatt-hour, the highest level
since Dec. 20, according to broker data compiled by Bloomberg.
Baseload is delivered around the clock.  The corresponding day-ahead contract on the Epex Spot SE
exchange in Paris declined 2.3 percent to 59.81 euros a
megawatt-hour.  German power for next-year delivery fell for a second day
in three. The European benchmark dropped 0.9 percent to 59.34
euros a megawatt-hour, according to broker prices. The country,
Europe’s biggest economy, also gets power from lignite, natural
gas and solar stations.  Bloomberg tracks prices from brokers including ICAP Plc,
GFI Group Inc., Spectron Group Ltd. and Tullett Prebon Plc.  To contact the reporter on this story:
