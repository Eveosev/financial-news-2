Dana Gas PJSC (DANA) , an energy producer
focused on  Egypt , found  natural gas  at the South Abu El Naga-2
well in the Nile Delta region, leading to the discovery of a new
formation of hydrocarbons.  The reservoir, called the El Wastani formation, may hold
more than 60 billion cubic feet of gas reserves, Dana Gas said
in a statement today, citing preliminary estimates. The Abu Madi
Formation, the existence of which was known, may hold as much as
90 million cubic feet of gas reserves, it said.  Dana Gas drilled the South Abu El Naga-2 well to appraise
the previously announced field of the same name and produced gas
at a rate of 14.1 million cubic feet a day with 718 barrels of
condensate. The El Wastani Formation produced 5.9 million cubic
feet a day of dry gas, the company said.  The company, based in the sheikhdom of Sharjah in the
 United Arab Emirates , has a target to raise production from
deposits in Egypt and  Iraq â€™s Kurdistan region by 20 percent this
year, Chief Executive Officer Ahmed Al-Arbeed said in an
interview Jan. 31.  The company today said it will prepare a development plan
for the newly discovered hydrocarbon pool and may link the
deposit with a gas processing station by the end of the year.  To contact the reporters on this story:
