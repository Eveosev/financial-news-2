Slovenia’s Supreme Court rejected an
appeal by  Pivovarna Lasko (PILR)  Group d.d. over the country’s
competition protection office decision to stop the planned sale
of a 23.3 percent stake in  Mercator Poslovni Sistem (MELR)  d.d.  The Slovenian brewer commented on the court’s rejection in
a statement to the Ljubljana stock exchange today. The anti-
monopoly watchdog stopped the sale on April 26.  Pivovarna Lasko needs to sell the Mercator holding as it
struggles to repay debt amounting to about 400 million euros
($593 million), according to chief executive officer Dusan
Zorko.  Agrokor d.d. of  Croatia , Warburg Pincus LLC and Mid Europa
Partners Ltd. placed bids for the stake of Mercator retailer on
March 10. The Croatian company increased the offer to 221 euros
per share on April 19, President Ivica Todoric has said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
