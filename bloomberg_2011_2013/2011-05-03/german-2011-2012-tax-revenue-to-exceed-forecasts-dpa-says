German tax revenue this year and next
will exceed a November estimate by as much as 36 billion euros
($53.2 billion),  Deutsche Presse-Agentur  reported, citing
members of a tax estimate group it didn’t name.  Germany’s economic recovery together with legal changes
will boost tax revenue at the federal government, the 16 states
and cities and towns by between 14 billion euros and 18 billion
euros in 2011 over the group’s November estimate, DPA said. Next
year, the intake will beat the forecast by between 13 billion
euros and 18 billion euros, DPA said.  The government’s tax estimate group, attached to the
 Finance Ministry  and founded in 1955, will meet next week in the
town of Fulda, Germany, DPA said. Finance Minister  Wolfgang Schaeuble  has already included higher-than-forecast tax revenue
in his budget for 2012, DPA said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
