OAO OGK-4 dropped to its lowest in
almost a year after Deutsche Bank AG said the Russian power
producer may be excluded this month from the MSCI Russia Index
on “liquidity grounds.”  The stock fell 4.3 percent to 2.3102 rubles by the 6:45
p.m. close in Moscow, the weakest since May 25. Deutsche Bank
analysts made the comments in a note e-mailed on April 28. The
Russian market was closed for a holiday yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
