International Coal Group Inc. (ICO) , the
company that yesterday agreed to be bought by  Arch Coal Inc. (ACI)  for
$3.4 billion, said a court held that it’s liable for $104.1
million after it breached a coal supply contract.  Wolf Run, a subsidiary of Scott Depot, West Virginia-based
International, breached a coal supply contract with Allegheny
Energy Supply and Monongahela Power Company when it declared
force majeure and temporarily idled a mine in the third quarter
of 2006, a trial court ruled.  International said that it has enough cash on hand and
credit to appeal the case and that it doesn’t expect the ruling
to derail the merger with Arch, to be completed by June 30.  “I don’t think a $100 million ruling is going to stop Arch
from going through with a multibillion-dollar merger,” said
 Jeremy Sussman , an analyst at Brean Murray & Co. in  New York .  International was unchanged at $14.43 at 9:46 a.m. today in
New York Stock Exchange composite trading. Yesterday the shares
rose $3.40, or 31 percent, after the announcement that it would
be acquired by Arch. The shares have gained 86 percent this
year.  To contact the reporters on this story:
