China  won’t determine its exchange-
rate policy based on temporary concerns such as changes in the
cost of imported goods, according to a former deputy chief of
the nation’s currency regulator.  The yuan exchange-rate policy is a “managed float” and
won’t change due to “temporary factors” like imported inflation,
Wei Benhua, former deputy head of the State Administration of
Foreign Exchange, told reporters in Hanoi today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
