German sugar output fell 18 percent in
the current crop year on lower beet deliveries, figures from
industry organization  Wirtschaftliche Vereinigung Zucker  showed.  Production dropped to 3.44 million metric tons for the
season started in October, down from 4.2 million tons a year
earlier, Bonn-based WVZ said in a report dated yesterday.  Sugar beet deliveries slid 13 percent to 22.4 million tons,
while yields dropped 8.6 percent to 65.1 tons per hectare (2.47
acres), it said in the report. Sugar content in the beets came
in at 17.3 percent, down from 18.2 percent in the same period a
year earlier, according to figures from the organization.  Germany  is the European Union’s second-largest sugar-beet
producer after France, the world’s largest grower of the root,
according to Eurostat, the EU’s statistical office based in
 Luxembourg .  To contact the reporter on this story:
