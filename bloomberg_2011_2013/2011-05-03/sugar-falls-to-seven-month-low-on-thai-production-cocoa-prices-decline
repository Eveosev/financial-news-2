Arabica coffee rose to the highest
price in almost 14 years as adverse weather threatened crops in
 Colombia , the world’s biggest producer after  Brazil . Sugar
gained, while cocoa declined.  Colombia’s Agriculture Ministry on May 1 said a lack of
sunshine will hurt coffee crops over the next few months.
Plantations also have been damaged by rain and landslides and
weather experts predict the worse is “yet to come,” Hamburg-
based broker  Eugen Atte GmbH  said April 28 in a report. Prices
have more than doubled in the past year.  “With concern of excessive rains in Colombia and steady
demand, coffee will continue to go even higher,” said Sterling Smith, an analyst at Country Hedging Inc. in  St. Paul ,
 Minnesota . “The scenario is very bullish.”  Arabica coffee for July delivery rose 1.05 cents, or 0.3
percent, to settle at $3.0615 a pound at 2 p.m. on ICE Futures
U.S. in  New York . Earlier, the price touched $3.089, the highest
since May 1997.  Strong demand, record-low inventories and production
disruptions in major growing countries are supporting the
market, Bjarne Schieldrop, chief commodity analyst at SEB AB,
Sweden’s third-biggest bank by market value, wrote in a report
today. “The situation originated with three consecutive
disappointing Colombian crop years.”  In London, robusta-coffee futures for July delivery rose
$56, or 2.2 percent, to $2,611 a metric ton on NYSE Liffe.  Raw-sugar futures for July delivery rose 0.18 cent, or 0.8
percent, to 22.05 cents a pound on ICE. Refined-sugar futures
for August delivery fell $5.60, or 0.9 percent, to $609.50 a ton
on NYSE Liffe.  Cocoa futures for July delivery dropped $20, or 0.6
percent, to settle at $3,271 a ton in New York. In  London , cocoa
futures for July delivery rose 3 pounds, or 0.2 percent, to
