Barcelona defeated Real  Madrid  3-1
over two games to reach soccer’s Champions League final for the
third time in six seasons.  A 1-1 home tie tonight, after a 2-0 win in Madrid last
week, sent three-time European champion Barcelona to the title
game against Manchester United or Schalke at Wembley Stadium in
London on May 28.  Barcelona’s Pedro Rodriguez opened the scoring at the Nou
Camp stadium in the 54th minute and Marcelo got Real’s goal 10
minutes later. It was the fourth game in 18 days between the
rivals with each team winning once and two draws.  Barcelona won on its past two visits to the final, against
Arsenal in 2006 and  Manchester United  two years ago. The Spanish
team will be making its seventh appearance in the title game.  Manchester United takes a 2-0 lead into the second game of
its semifinal tomorrow night at Old Trafford.  To contact the reporter on this story:
