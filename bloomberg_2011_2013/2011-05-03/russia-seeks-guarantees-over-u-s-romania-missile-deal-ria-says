Russia  wants the U.S. to guarantee
that a European anti-missile system is not directed against its
nuclear arsenal, the RIA Novosti news service  reported  today,
citing a Foreign Ministry statement.  Romanian President Traian Basescu said today that a site
had been chosen for a planned U.S. missile interceptor, which
would be part of a shield covering  Europe .  “In this situation, getting legal guarantees from the U.S.
that the anti-missile system they are developing in Europe is
not directed against Russia’s strategic nuclear forces is even
more relevant,” RIA cited the ministry as saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
