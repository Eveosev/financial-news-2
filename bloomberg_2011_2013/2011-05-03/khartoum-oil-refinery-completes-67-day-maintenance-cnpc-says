Khartoum Refinery Co., a venture
between China National Petroleum Corp. and the Sudanese
government, completed a maintenance program at its 100,000
barrel-a-day facility last week, the Chinese company said.  The work lasted 67 days, eight fewer than originally
planned, and concluded on April 28, China National said in a
statement on its website today. The repair was the fifth
complete shutdown of the plant, according to state-run China

process 100,000 barrels of oil a day, according to data compiled
