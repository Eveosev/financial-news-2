U.K. citizens with billions of pounds
in undeclared bank accounts in  Switzerland  will pay tax at a
rate of 50 percent in a deal negotiated between the British and
Swiss governments, the Financial Times reported, citing a person
with knowledge of the matter. The agreement, which may be
announced this month, is expected to raise 3 billion pounds ($5
billion) during the term of the current parliament, the
newspaper said.  A Treasury spokesman declined to comment on whether an
agreement between the U.K. and Switzerland had been reached when
contacted by Bloomberg News.  “Discussions are ongoing and have been positive,” the
spokesman said by telephone today.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
