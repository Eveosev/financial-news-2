The interim ruling military council
urged Egyptians to be aware of “calls for sedition” that it
says are promoted by people using Internet accounts outside the
country.  A number of Facebook accounts and websites are “inciting
sectarian sedition and violence and spreading rumours that can
destabilize the homeland,” the Supreme Council of the Armed
Forces said on its Facebook page. The accounts are operated from
abroad to be harder to track, it said without providing further
details.  To contact the reporter on this story:
