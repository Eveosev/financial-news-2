Silver futures tumbled, capping the
biggest two-day slide since October 2008, after margin
requirements on the Comex increased for the second time in less
than a week. Gold fell the most since mid-March.  The minimum amount of cash that must be deposited when
borrowing from brokers to trade silver futures will rise to
$16,200 per contract at the close of business today from
$14,513, CME Group Ltd., Comex’s owner, said yesterday. A year
ago, the margin was $4,250. The metal, which tumbled 12 percent
in two days, has doubled in the past 12 months.  “Margin-requirement hikes usually translate into people
liquidating positions,” said Bernard Sin, the head of currency
and metal trading at MKS Finance SA in Geneva. “The exchange is
trying to calm the market down. It’s been overheating.”  Silver futures for July delivery fell $3.499, or 7.6
percent, to settle at $42.585 an ounce at 2:07 p.m. on the Comex
in  New York , the biggest drop for a most-active contract since
Dec. 1, 2008. The price dropped 5.2 percent yesterday. The two-
day slump was the largest since Oct. 16, 2008.  The Comex margin went up 13 percent at the close of
business on April 29. In April, the price gained 28 percent, the
most since January 1983.  “You’ve got another margin raise, and a lot of people are
trading with a hope and a prayer,” said  Frank McGhee , the head
dealer at Integrated Brokerage Services LLC in  Chicago .  After rising to a record $50.35 in January 1980, the metal
dropped 78 percent in four months. This year, silver has climbed
38 percent, the most among 24 raw materials in the Standard &
Poor’s GSCI Index. The price reached $49.845 on April 25.  Gold Record  Gold futures for June delivery fell $16.70, or 1.1 percent,
to $1,540.40 an ounce, the biggest decline for a most-active
contract since March 15. Yesterday, the metal rose to a record
$1,577.40. The price has gained 30 percent in the past year.  “Between gold and silver, silver has the bigger downside
risk, since it’s been outperforming gold since August,” said
Tom Pawlicki, an analyst at MF Global Holdings Ltd. in Chicago.  Palladium futures for June delivery fell $1.70, or 0.2
percent, to $782.40 ounce on the  New York Mercantile Exchange .  Platinum futures for July delivery declined $15.20, or 0.8
percent, to $1,860.50 an ounce.  To contact the reporters on this story:
