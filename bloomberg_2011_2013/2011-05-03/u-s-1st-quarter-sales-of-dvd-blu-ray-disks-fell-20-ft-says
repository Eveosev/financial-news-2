U.S. first-quarter sales of film-
related packaged goods, including DVD and Blu-ray disks, fell by
almost a fifth, from $2.6 billion to $2.1 billion, the Financial
Times reported, citing Digital Entertainment Group, which
represents film studios and consumer electronics companies.  The figures suggest that people are shifting their spending
away from buying films to streaming them online or watching them
via film subscription services, the newspaper said.  Expenditure on renting DVDs from stores fell 36 percent, to
$440 million, according to the group, the FT reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
