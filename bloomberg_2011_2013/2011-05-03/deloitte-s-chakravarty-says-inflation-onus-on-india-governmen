Anis Chakravarty, an economist at
Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu  India  Pvt. comments on India’s interest
rates. The  Reserve Bank  of India today raised the repurchase
rate by half a percentage point to 7.25 percent. Only seven of
25 economists in a Bloomberg News survey had predicted the move,
while the remaining expected a quarter-point increase.  Chakravarty spoke in a phone interview.  “There need to be a bold move to address inflation. The
100 basis points increase in rates this year has hardly caused a
dent to headline inflation. This raises a question whether the
policy is effective.  ‘‘Maybe there are different facets to tackle inflation. The
Reserve Bank has done enough and now it is the government, which
has to handle the supply-side pressures.  ‘‘The government has to come out and get to the root cause
of the problem. Further rate increases won’t help in bringing
headline inflation to more manageable levels. The onus is on the
government.’’  To contact the reporter on this story:
