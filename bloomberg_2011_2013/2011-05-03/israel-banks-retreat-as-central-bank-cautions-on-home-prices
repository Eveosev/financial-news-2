Bank Leumi Le-Israel Ltd. and Bank
Hapoalim Ltd. dropped, pushing the  Tel Aviv Banking Index (TABANK)  to the
lowest in almost two months, after central bank Governor Stanley
Fischer warned rising home prices may hurt lenders’ stability.  The shares of Leumi, the country’s largest bank by assets,
retreated 1 percent to 16.88 shekels at 3:42 p.m. in  Tel Aviv ,
the lowest level since March 15. Hapoalim, the second biggest
bank, slid 1.3 percent to 17.04 shekels, the lowest level since
March 24. The banking index dropped 0.9 percent to 1,308.05, the
lowest since March 17.  A housing market bubble must be avoided, Fischer said today
at a parliamentary committee meeting in Jerusalem, reiterating
an earlier warning that financial crises in other countries
began with problems due to housing credit.  Home prices  rose 16.1
percent in the 12 months through February, the Bank of Israel
said in its April 24 interest rate decision.  The central bank on April 27 issued a draft directive
limiting variable-rate mortgages to one-third the value of the
total loan, aiming to limit risks to borrowers and the banking
system as  interest rates  increase.  To contact the reporter on this story:
