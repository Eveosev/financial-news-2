Canada ’s dollar slid for a second day
as a drop in global stocks overshadowed national election
results that gave Conservative Prime Minister Stephen Harper a
majority of seats in Parliament for the first time.  The loonie, as the currency is nicknamed, also fell as
commodities dropped before a report tomorrow forecast to show
U.S. supplies of crude oil rose to a six-month high last week.
America is Canada’s biggest trading partner.  “The Canadian dollar has the tendency to be steered by
global markets, and that’s what’s happening today,” said  Mary Nicola , a currency strategist at BNP Paribas SA in New York.  The loonie depreciated 0.2 percent to 95.26 cents versus
the greenback at 5:06 p.m. in Toronto, from 95.06 cents
yesterday, after gaining as much as 0.5 percent and sliding 0.4
percent. One Canadian dollar buys $1.0498. The currency touched
94.46 cents on April 29, the strongest since November 2007.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index dropped 0.3 percent, and
the S&P/TSX Composite Index slid 1.7 percent. Futures on crude
oil, Canada’s biggest export, fell 2.4 percent to $110.85 a
barrel on the  New York Mercantile Exchange .  Tomorrow’s report from the U.S. Energy Department may show
crude stockpiles climbed 2 million barrels from 363.1 million
last week, according to the median forecast of 15 analysts in a
Bloomberg News survey.  Canadian  government bonds  rose, driving the yield on the
10-year security down five basis points, or 0.05 percentage
point, to 3.15 percent. The price of the 3.5 percent security
maturing in June 2020 advanced 37 cents to C$102.72.  Election Results  Election results gave the  Conservative Party  a mandate to
secure the economic recovery with additional tax cuts and erase
the country’s deficit with curbs on  government spending .  The victory ended seven years of minority governments and
puts the Conservatives in firm control of the federal agenda for
the first time since the early 1990s.  Harper pledged to balance Canada’s budget by 2014 after
running record deficits during the recession even as he moves
ahead with personal and corporate income tax cuts to help
sustain the expansion.  The election results are “generally positive for the
Canadian dollar,” said Firas Askari, head currency trader at
Bank of Montreal in Toronto.  To contact the reporters for this story:
