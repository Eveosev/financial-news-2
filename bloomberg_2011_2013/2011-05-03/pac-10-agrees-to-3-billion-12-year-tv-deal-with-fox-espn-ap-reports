The  Pac-10  agreed to a $3 billion, 12-
year television contract with Fox and ESPN, the  Associated Press 
reported, citing an unidentified person familiar with the
agreement.  The deal quadruples the college sports conferenceâ€™s media
rights fees and allows it to start its own network, AP said. The
Pac-10 made less than $60 million in media rights this past
season, the report said.  Beginning with the 2012-13 season, the accord will be worth
$250 million annually, guaranteeing each school about $21
million a year, the report said.  The contract is expected to be announced at a news
conference in Phoenix tomorrow, AP said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
