Former Utah Governor  Jon Huntsman 
formed a leadership political action committee today, an action
that lets him raise money to hire aides and travel the country
as he weighs a bid for the 2012 Republican presidential
nomination.  Huntsman, 51, left his post as U.S. ambassador to  China  at
the end of April and is considering a run for the White House
against his former boss, President  Barack Obama . His first
public speech since leaving the administration is scheduled for
May 7 in  South Carolina , site of one of the early primaries in
the 2012 campaign.  He can’t draw on the PAC’s treasury to directly fund a
campaign, though the activities it funds can help lay the
groundwork for a presidential run.  Other Republicans, including former Massachusetts Governor
Mitt Romney and former Minnesota Governor  Tim Pawlenty , also had
leadership PACs before they formed exploratory committees and
began raising money for a presidential campaign.  “This is simply an organizational step that allows
Governor Huntsman to travel the country to discuss the issues he
cares about as well as support Republican candidates,” said
spokesman Tim Miller.  Another prospective 2012 Republican presidential candidate,
former Senator Rick Santorum of Pennsylvania, said today in an
e-mail to supporters that a committee he formed last month to
raise money for a possible campaign will become an official
exploratory effort filed with the  Federal Election Commission .  To contact the reporter on this story:
