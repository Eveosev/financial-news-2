Portugal  reached an agreement with
officials preparing its European Union-led bailout that will
provide as much as 78 billion euros ($116 billion) in aid and
allow more time to reduce the country’s budget deficit.  The three-year plan set goals for a budget deficit of 5.9
percent of gross domestic product this year, 4.5 percent in 2012
and 3 percent in 2013, Prime Minister Jose Socrates said in
Lisbon today. The government in March targeted a deficit of 4.6
percent this year, 3 percent in 2012 and 2 percent in 2013.  “The government was able to obtain a good agreement,”
Socrates said in comments broadcast live from his official
residence. “Naturally there are no programs of financial
assistance that are not demanding and that do not imply a lot of
work. That does not exist.”  Portugal in April became the third euro-region country to
request EU aid after Greece and Ireland. Officials from the
 International Monetary Fund , European Commission and  European
Central Bank  arrived in Lisbon last month to prepare a rescue
package. That hasn’t prevented Portuguese bond yields from
climbing to euro-era records.  The difference in yield that investors demand to hold
Portugal’s 10-year bonds instead of German bunds reached a euro-
era record of 6.48 percentage points yesterday. The 10-year bond
yield reached 9.76 percent on April 29, the highest since the
euro was adopted in 2000.  Tax Increases  Portugal has already raised taxes and is implementing the
deepest spending cuts in more than three decades as it tries to
narrow its budget gap and curb debt.  Socrates today said the agreed plan does not involve more
cuts in public-sector wages or in the minimum wage. State
workers will not be fired and the government will not sell
shares in state-owned savings bank Caixa Geral de Depositos SA
as part of the agreement, he said.  Consultations with Portuguese political parties will now
follow, Socrates said. He did not provide details on the
interest rate that Portugal will be charged for its aid plan.  EU finance ministers said in an April 8 statement that the
program for Portugal will include “an ambitious fiscal
adjustment,” an “ambitious privatization program” and
measures to maintain the liquidity and solvency of the financial
sector.  Portugal on April 23 revised its 2010  budget deficit  to 9.1
percent of GDP from 8.6 percent after the government added three
highways to its accounts.  Deficit Target  The government in March reported an 8.6 percent deficit for
2010, missing its target of 7.3 percent. Accounting changes
ordered by Eurostat, the European Union’s statistics agency,
forced the state to add more than 2 billion euros to the 2010
deficit for impairment costs stemming from the 2008 seizure of
Banco Portugues de Negocios SA and also for charges linked to
the public-transportation system.  Portugal’s public debt swelled to 93 percent of GDP in 2010
from 68 percent in 2007. The country’s statistics institute on
March 31 estimated public debt will reach 97.3 percent of GDP
this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
