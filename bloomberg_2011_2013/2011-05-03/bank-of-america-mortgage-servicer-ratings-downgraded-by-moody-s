Bank of America Corp. (BAC) , the biggest
U.S. lender by assets, had its servicer-quality ratings cut by
Moody’s Investors Service after delaying foreclosures amid
concerns that it mishandled mortgage paperwork.  Moody’s cited deterioration in the company’s collections
and loss-mitigation, according to a report today by the ratings
firm. The lender’s ratings “remain on review for possible
further downgrade due to irregularities in Bank of America’s
foreclosure process,” Moody’s said in the report.  Bank of America expanded its staff by 2,700 in the first
quarter to bolster the servicing business, and by more than
20,000 to deal with loan servicing “over the last several
quarters,” Chief Executive Officer  Brian T. Moynihan  said last
month.  Attorneys general  in 50 states are investigating
mortgage-servicing and foreclosure practices at the nation’s
largest lenders.  Moody’s lowered Bank of America NA’s grade to SQ2 from SQ1
as a primary servicer of prime residential  mortgage loans  and to
SQ2- from SQ1- as a primary servicer of subprime residential
mortgage loans, according to the report. The servicer-quality
ratings reflect the ability of a firm managing mortgage loans to
prevent or mitigate losses in a securitization.  To contact the reporter on this story:
