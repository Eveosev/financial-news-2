Turkey ’s benchmark stock index rose to
levels beyond 70,000 points for the first time in almost six
months after  Turkiye Halk Bankasi AS (HALKB)  posted earnings for the
first quarter that exceeded estimates, raising expectations of
similar performances from other banks.  The main ISE National 100 climbed 0.8 percent to 70,072.02
at 5:30 p.m. in Istanbul. That was the highest since Nov. 11.
Halkbank climbed 45 kurus, or 3.4 percent to 13.55 liras, the
biggest gain in four weeks.  “Optimistic sentiment emerged because of Halkbank and the
expectation that others may post similar results,” Nezihi Abay,
head of trading at Global Securities, said by telephone.  Turkish banks are seeking to offset increases in  reserve
requirements  by the central bank that are designed to curb loan
growth by increasing revenue from other sources such as fees and
commissions. The central bank has increased reserves on deposits
four times since December, narrowing banks’ margins.  The MSCI Emerging Markets Index slumped 1.7 percent to
1,186.58, the biggest decline in two weeks.  Net income at state-run Halkbank unexpectedly rose an
annual 1.8 percent to 524.7 million liras ($343 million.) That
beat the average of four analysts’ estimates compiled by
Bloomberg, which predicted a decline to 453 million liras. Fees
and commission income gained 18 percent and income from trading
jumped 62 percent, it said.  HSBC Holdings Plc and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. are among
foreign banks which have cut their ratings and estimates for
Turkish lenders, citing the increase in reserve requirements.
The government and central bank say banks should cap loan growth
at 25 percent this year compared with about 35 percent annual
growth in the week ending April 22.  Turkiye Garanti Bankasi AS (GARAN)  advanced 20 kurus, or 2.5
percent, to 8.18 liras. Garanti is due to report first-quarter
earnings in two days time. Yapi & Kredi Bankasi AS, part-owned
by Italy’s UniCredit SpA, rose 11 kurus, or 2.3 percent, to 4.87
liras.  To contact the reporter on this story:
