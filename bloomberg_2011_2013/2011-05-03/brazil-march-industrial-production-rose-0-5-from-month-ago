Brazil ’s industrial output slowed less
than economists expected in March, raising concern that Latin
America’s biggest economy is still expanding at a pace that
stokes inflation.  Output rose 0.5 percent in March from the previous month,
the national statistics agency said today in Rio de Janeiro.
That’s more than the 0.2 percent median forecast in a Bloomberg
survey of 31 analysts. Production fell 2.1 percent from a year
ago, the first year-on-year decline since 2009.  “It’s not a good number for the central bank,” said  Andre Perfeito , chief economist at Sao Paulo-based Gradual
Investimentos. “The central bank is betting that activity will
slow down, and you don’t see that in these numbers.”  Latin America ’s biggest economy is slowing at an uncertain
pace after expanding 7.5 percent in 2010, the fastest in two
decades, the central bank said in the minutes to its April 19-20
policy meeting. With industry close to full capacity, and
unemployment near a record low, inflation in April likely
exceeded the 6.5 percent upper limit of the bank’s target range,
a Bloomberg News survey shows.  “I can guarantee that we won’t return to the levels of
inflation we have seen in the past,” Finance Minister Guido
Mantega told lawmakers in Brasilia today. “Brazil will
certainly be victorious.”  ‘Above Expectations’  Mantega repeated his forecast that Brazil will grow 4.5
percent this year. “We have succeeded in combining higher rates
of growth with lower inflation,” he said.  The yield on the interest rate futures contract maturing in
January 2012, the most traded in  Sao Paulo  today, was unchanged
at 12.33 percent at 11:15 a.m.  New York  time.  Yields on contracts maturing the next two years rose,
pushing the January 2014 contract up 4 basis points, or 0.04
percentage point, to 12.65 percent. The real fell 0.1 percent to
1.5874 per  U.S. dollar .  “Output was good, above expectations, and that just adds
to consumer demand growth that doesn’t look like its letting
up,” said Alexandre Sant’anna, chief economist at Rio de
Janeiro-based BNY Mellon Arx, which manages 12 billion reais
($7.2 billion).  A 10.1 percent expansion in the production of electronics
and communications equipment led 13 of 27 industries that saw
output expand during the month. Production of capital goods, a
barometer of investment, rose 3.4 percent.  March’s output results compare with a 6.9 percent year-on-
year rise in February, and a 1.9 percent monthly gain.  Reduced Forecasts  Analysts covering the Brazilian economy cut their forecasts
for industrial output growth for a second straight week in an
April 29 central bank  survey  of about 100 economists. Industry
will expand 4.04 percent this year and 4.25 percent in 2012,
down from the previous week’s forecasts of 4.06 percent and 4.65
percent, the survey showed,  The central bank raised its benchmark interest rate by a
quarter-point to 12 percent on April 20, after half-point
increases in January and March. Consumer price inflation
accelerated to 6.44 percent in the year through mid-April, its
fastest pace since November 2008. The central bank targets
inflation of 4.5 percent plus or minus two percentage points.  Brazil’s economic activity index, a proxy for gross
domestic product, rose 6.8 percent in February, its fastest pace
since August. Brazil’s economy grew “a little more” than 4
percent in the first quarter, Finance Minister  Guido Mantega 
said April 18 in New York.  Manufacturers used 83.6 percent of installed capacity in
February, the highest level in three years, according to the
National Industrial Confederation.  Retailer Earnings  First-quarter earnings for retailers reported last week
shows no slowdown in demand. Cia. Hering, a clothing
manufacturer and retailer, said quarterly profit rose 74 percent
from a year earlier, according to a regulatory filing. Lojas
Renner SA, Brazil’s biggest publicly traded apparel retailer,
said profits surged 29 percent in the first quarter.  Brazil’s retail sales fell 0.4 percent in February, the
first contraction in 10 months.  Traders are wagering that the central bank will raise
borrowing costs by 25 basis points, or 0.25 percentage point, to
12.25 percent on June 8, interest-rate futures contracts show.  Analysts expect the real to end 2011 at 1.62 per U.S.
dollar, according to the weekly central bank survey, from 1.6613
at the end of 2010.  To contact the reporter on this story:
