The  Boston Bruins  recovered from an
early two-goal deficit to defeat the  Philadelphia Flyers  3-2 in
overtime and take a 2-0 lead in games in their National Hockey
League playoff series.  David Krejci scored after 14 minutes of overtime at the
Wells Fargo Center in Philadelphia last night to win the game
for the Bruins, who captured the first two games of the second-
round series on the road.  James van Riemsdyk scored twice in the first 10 minutes of
the opening period for the Flyers. Boston responded with goals
by  Chris Kelly  and Brad Marchand in an 85-second span midway
through the first period, and the teams then remained scoreless
until overtime.  The best-of-seven series resumes tomorrow with Game 3 at TD
Garden in  Boston .  Tonight, the Tampa Bay Lightning seek to take a 3-0 lead in
games against the top-seeded Washington Capitals in the Eastern
Conference, while the Vancouver Canucks and Nashville Predators
are tied at a game apiece ahead of Game 3 in their Western
Conference series.  To contact the reporter on this story:
