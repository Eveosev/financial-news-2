Macarthur Coal Ltd. (MCC) , the biggest
exporter of pulverized coal used by steelmakers, said full-year
profit may rise as much as 64 percent because of record coal
prices and a one-time gain on an asset sale.  Net profit after tax is likely to be in the range of A$185
million ($201 million) to A$205 million in the 12 months ending
June 30, compared with A$125 million a year earlier, the
Brisbane-based company said today in a statement.  The company cut its output target to a range of 3.8 million
metric tons to 4.0 million tons, compared with a previous
forecast of 4.1 million to 4.3 million tons after record rains
in Queensland’s Bowen Basin.  “The effects of the significant wet weather conditions
across the Bowen Basin, although disappointing, have resulted in
record pricing being achieved for metallurgical coal in the
April-June Quarter,” Nicole Hollows, chief executive officer,
said in the statement.  Macarthur fell 2.3 percent to A$11.14 at the 4:10 p.m.
close of Sydney trading yesterday.  Kobe Steel Ltd.,  Japan ’s fourth-largest steelmaker, agreed
in March to pay Rio Tinto Group a record quarterly price for
coking coal after supply from  Australia  was disrupted by the
heavy rain and floods.  Kobe will pay about $330 a ton for the three months from
April 1, compared with $225 a ton during the previous quarter.  To contact the reporter on this story:
