Egypt  may extend the ban of  fuel oil 
imports beyond June 30 and rely instead on domestic supplies of
natural gas for its power stations, an official at the state-run
Egyptian General Petroleum Corp. said today.  “This will depend on summertime demand for power,” Deputy
Chief Executive Officer for Operations Mohamed Shoeib said in a
phone interview from Cairo. “But our aim is to maximize the use
of the locally produced natural gas in generating electricity.”  The North African country stopped imports of fuel oil in
February after purchasing about 2 million metric tons of the oil
product annually in the past, according to Shoeib.  Egypt has 78 trillion cubic feet (2.2 trillion cubic
meters) of gas reserves and produces more than 6 billion cubic
feet a day, according to the Egyptian Oil Ministry.  To contact the reporter on this story:
