United Co. Rusal, the world’s biggest
aluminum producer, gained the most in a month after Deutsche
Bank AG said the company may be included in the MSCI Russia
Index.  The stock added 2.5 percent to HK$12.18 by the close in
 Hong Kong , its biggest gain since April 4. Its Moscow-traded
shares climbed 0.9 percent to 426.39 rubles by the 6:45 p.m.
close.  “Rusal is likely to be included into the index once MSCI
confirms that the Russian Depositary Receipts issued in December
are indeed a Russian listing representing a solid domestic
investor base,”  Yaroslav Lissovolik , chief strategist at
Deutsche Bank in Moscow, wrote in a report dated April 28.  The review is scheduled for May 16, Lissovolik said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
