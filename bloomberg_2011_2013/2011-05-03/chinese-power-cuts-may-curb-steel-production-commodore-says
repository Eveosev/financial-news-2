Chinese  steel mills  may cut production
of the alloy as the country’s government diverts power away from
industrial users to private citizens in the coming months,
Commodore Research & Consultancy said.  “There is a considerable chance that steel mills will
receive reduced electricity allocations due to Chinese
electricity production in the summer simply being unable to come
close to meeting demand,” Jeffrey Landsberg, president of the
New York-based shipping researcher Commodore, wrote in an e-
mailed report today. “This would result in a decline in steel
production and lower  iron ore  demand.”  Iron ore is the biggest source of demand for dry-bulk
shipping, estimates Clarkson Plc, the world’s largest
shipbroker. Coal generates the second-most demand for commodity
transporters.  To contact the reporter on this story:
