The death of al-Qaeda leader Osama bin
Laden is a “major development” in anti-terror efforts,
according to the  African Union , even as the continent
“continues to pay a heavy toll” to terrorism.  Citing attacks in  Somalia ,  Uganda  and throughout northern
 Africa , the Addis Ababa-based African Union told regional
governments to “intensify their efforts” to combat terrorism,
according to an e-mailed statement today.  Al-Qaeda is believed responsible for bombings in Kenya and
Tanzania in 1998, the African Union said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
