The shekel dropped the most in more
than two weeks after central bank Governor Stanley Fischer said
rising  home prices  could affect banks’ stability, spurring
demand for the relative safety of the dollar. Bonds gained.  A housing-market bubble must be avoided, Fischer said today
at a parliamentary committee meeting in  Jerusalem , reiterating
an earlier statement that financial crises in other countries
began with problems due to housing credit. Home prices rose 16.1
percent in the 12 months through February, the Bank of  Israel 
said in its April 24 interest rate decision.  “The central bank is warning the market that if the
housing problem is not dealt with, banks may suffer, which could
undermine the economy’s strength,” said Moshe Nir, a currency
trader at Mercantile Discount Bank Ltd. in Tel Aviv. “Banks are
buying dollars.”  The shekel dropped 0.4 percent to 3.3828 against the dollar
as of 4:43 p.m. in  Tel Aviv . The currency earlier slumped 0.9
percent, the biggest decline since April 18. The yield on the
benchmark Mimshal Shiklit bond due January 2020 fell 2 basis
points to 5.33 percent at the 4:30 p.m. close.  The  Bank of Israel  issued a draft directive on April 27
limiting variable-rate mortgages to one-third the value of the
total loan, saying the measure aims to limit risks to borrowers
and the banking system as  interest rates  increase.  The central bank, which left its benchmark lending rate at
3 percent on April 24, has increased rates by 2.5 percentage
points since August 2009, in an attempt to tame inflation that
accelerated to 4.3 percent in March. The economy is likely to
expand 4.5 percent this year and 4 percent in 2012, the central
bank forecast in March.  To contact the reporter on this story:
