The Dollar Index held onto yesterday’s
gains on speculation U.S. reports will show employers added jobs
for a 15th month and growth in  service industries  quickened,
underpinning the appeal of American assets.  The yen weakened versus all of its 16 major counterparts as
signs that the U.S. recovery remains on track sapped demand for
 Japan ’s currency as a refuge. The pound traded 0.2 percent from
a one-week low versus the dollar before a U.K. report that may
show a construction index fell for a third month, supporting the
case for the Bank of England to keep  interest rates  low.  “The U.S. data that is coming out is starting to paint a
bit better picture,” said  Matthew Brady , executive director for
foreign exchange at JPMorgan Chase & Co. in Sydney. “I’m
starting to get a little bit bullish for the dollar at the
moment.”  The Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against the
currencies of six major U.S. trading partners was at 73.126 as
of 8:25 a.m. in  Tokyo  from 73.124 in  New York  yesterday. It fell
to 72.722 on May 2, the lowest level since July 2008. The U.S.
currency traded at 81.03 yen from 80.94 yen.  The euro fetched $1.4830 from $1.4825 yesterday. The single
currency bought 120.17 yen from 119.99 yen. The pound was at
$1.6490 from $1.6487 yesterday, when it declined to $1.6464, the
weakest since April 27.  U.S. employment increased by 198,000 workers in April,
after a 201,000 increase March, according to a Bloomberg News
survey of economists before today’s report from ADP Employer
Services. The Institute for Supply Management’s index of non-
manufacturing companies rose to 57.5 in April from 57.3 in
March, a separate Bloomberg survey showed before today’s data.  To contact the reporter on this story:
