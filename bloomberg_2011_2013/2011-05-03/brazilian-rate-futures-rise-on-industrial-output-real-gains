Yields on most Brazilian interest-rate
futures contracts due after 2012 rose after industrial output
slowed less than analysts expected, spurring speculation policy
makers may boost borrowing costs to contain inflation.  Yields on futures contract due in January 2015 headed for
their first increase in six days, rising four basis points, or
0.04 percentage point, to 12.64 percent at 11:37 a.m. New York
time. The yield on contracts maturing in January 2021 climbed
three basis points.  Industrial output rose 0.5 percent in March from the
previous month, the national statistics agency said today in  Rio
de Janeiro . The median forecast in a Bloomberg survey of 31
analysts was for a 0.2 percent increase. The report is “not
very good” for the central bank as it moves to contain consumer
price increases, said  Andre Perfeito , chief economist at Sao
Paulo-based Gradual Investimentos.  “The central bank knows that it is working with a bad
scenario for inflation” during the first half of the year, he
said by phone.  The real reversed earlier losses and gained 0.3 percent to
1.5849 per dollar, from 1.5893 yesterday.  To contact the reporters on this story:
