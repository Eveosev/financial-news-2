DAB Bank AG (DRN) , the German online broker
controlled by  Italy ’s  UniCredit SpA (UCG) , said first-quarter profit
was little changed as lower financial income offset higher fees.  Net income in the three months ended March 31 totaled 5.9
million euros ($8.8 million), the Munich-based company said in
an e-mailed statement today. Commission income rose 8.9 percent
to 24.5 million euros, while the financial result, which
includes net interest income, and earnings from trading and
investments, declined 19 percent to 13.8 million euros.  UniCredit, Italy’s biggest bank, bought a majority holding
in DAB Bank through its 2005 acquisition of Munich-based lender
HVB Group.  Comdirect Bank AG, the German online broker controlled by
Commerzbank AG, said last week that first-quarter net income
rose 16 percent to 18.2 million euros.  To contact the reporter on this story:
