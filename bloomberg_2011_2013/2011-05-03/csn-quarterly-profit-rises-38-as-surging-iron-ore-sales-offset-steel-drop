Cia. Siderurgica Nacional,  Brazil â€™s
third-largest steelmaker, said first-quarter profit rose 38
percent as surging iron-ore sales offset a drop in steel output.  Net income, which excludes minority interests, rose to
617.5 million reais ($389 million) from 448.9 million reais a
year earlier, the steelmaker said today in a regulatory filing.
The Rio de Janeiro-based company, known as CSN, was expected to
post a profit of 677 million reais on an adjusted basis, the
average estimate of six analysts in a Bloomberg survey.  Iron-ore sales more than doubled to 1.2 billion reais from
a year earlier, offsetting a drop in steel output and prices.
CSN said crude-steel production fell 4 percent to 1.13 million
metric tons, while rolled-steel output declined 14 percent.  CSN is expanding its  iron-ore  mining business after prices
for the mineral almost tripled in the past two years, with the
unit accounting for 31 percent of net sales in the first
quarter, compared with 24 percent last year. The company expects
to produce about 40 million tons of iron ore in 2012, CSN Chief
Financial Officer Paulo Penido said March 29.  Total net revenue rose 19 percent to 3.79 billion reais
from 3.18 billion reais a year earlier, CSN said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
