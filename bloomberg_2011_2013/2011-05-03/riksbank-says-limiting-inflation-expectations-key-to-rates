Sweden ’s central bank said keeping
inflation expectations in check is important to allow policy
makers to stick to their forecast interest rate increases,
minutes of the latest rate decision meeting showed.  “One important condition for not adjusting the repo-rate
path upwards is that the currently high CPI inflation doesn’t
make a more significant impact on various agents’ long-term
inflation expectations and on wage formation,” the bank said in
the minutes of the April 19 meeting published today.  The bank last month raised its benchmark repo rate for a
sixth time since July to 1.75 percent and stuck to a forecast
that the rate will reach 2.5 percent by the end of the year as
it strives to cool  Europe ’s fastest economic rebound and ease
credit and house-price growth.  Sweden’s economy may grow more than twice as fast as the
average for the 27-member European Union in 2011, as a second
year of recovery pushes down unemployment and fuels consumer
spending, the government said last month. The revival has
outpaced the central bank’s forecasts and Swedish headline
inflation reached 2.9 percent in March, exceeding the 2 percent
target for a fourth month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
