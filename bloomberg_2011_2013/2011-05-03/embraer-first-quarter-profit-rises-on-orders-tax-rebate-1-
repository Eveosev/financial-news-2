Embraer SA (EMBR3) , the world’s fourth-largest
planemaker by sales, said first-quarter profit rose almost four-
fold on new orders and a tax rebate.  Net income increased to 174.3 million reais ($109.7
million) from 44.1 million de reais a year earlier, the  Sao Jose
dos Campos , Brazil-based company said today in a regulatory
filing. The mean estimate of three analysts compiled by
Bloomberg was for profit of 179.7 million reais. Sales fell 1.5
percent to 1.76 billion reais. The company received a tax rebate
of 4.2 million reais after paying 88.1 million reais a year
earlier.  “Embraer’s product portfolio supports stronger customer
orders and deliveries,” Chicago-based Zacks Investment Research
said in an April 19 note. The company is “experiencing strong
orders for Embraer 190, having delivered 20 aircrafts to CDB
Leasing Co. since January 2011; the company has received orders
for another 10 aircraft.”  The planemaker said last month it delivered 28 aircraft in
the first quarter, and that its backlog was at $16 billion.  To contact the reporter on this story:
