India 's central bank asked lenders in
the South Asian nation to increase provisioning for bad loans.  Banks will need to set aside 25 percent of the secured
portion of loans which have remained ``doubtful'' for a year from
20 percent earlier, the  Reserve Bank  of India said in its annual
policy statement today. Credit classified as ``doubtful'' for
three years will attract 40 percent provisioning, according to
the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
