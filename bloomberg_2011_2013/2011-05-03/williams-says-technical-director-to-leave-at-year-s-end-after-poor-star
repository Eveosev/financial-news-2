The Williams Formula One team said
technical director Sam Michael and chief aerodynamicist Jon
Tomlinson will resign at the end of 2011 after the team failed
to gain any points in the season’s first three auto races.  Williams is tied with three other teams in last place in
the Formula One standings. Former McLaren chief designer Mike
Coughlan will join as chief engineer in June, when he leaves
Nascar team Michael Waltrip Racing, Williams said today in an e-
mailed statement. Coughlan was fired by McLaren in 2008 for his
role in a spying scandal that cost the team a $100 million fine.  To contact the reporter on this story:
