Venezuela ’s  central bank  is stepping
up oversight of local banks’ bond trading in an effort to slow
capital flight, Nelson Merentes, the bank’s president, said.  The central bank on March 30 ordered banks to register
their securities within 10 working days and to transfer bonds,
whether they’re held abroad or locally, to the Caracas-based
institution, which will act as their custodian.  “We’re holding the securities under custody at the central
bank to avoid capital flight and financial engineering that
allowed banks to register the value of the bonds below market
price,” Merentes told reporters today in Caracas. “We aren’t
going to regulate the sale of these bonds, but the central bank
will monitor the operations to avoid losses.”  President  Hugo Chavez  has cracked down on the financial
industry since closing an unregulated  currency market  last year,
shuttering brokerages and forcing commercial banks to sell part
of their bond holdings through a central bank-administered
currency market at a fixed  exchange rate . Merentes declined to
say how much the local banks hold in dollar-denominated
securities.  The banks won’t “necessarily” be forced to sell the bonds
held under custody at the central bank through the Sitme
currency market, Merentes said.  “Banks have already begun to transfer their bonds from
international institutions,” he said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
