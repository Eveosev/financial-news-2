PepsiCo Inc., the world’s largest
snack-food maker, sold $1.75 billion of two- and five-year
notes, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Proceeds will be used for general corporate purposes, the
Purchase, New York-based company said in a regulatory filing.
PepsiCo earlier marketed only five-year notes.  PepsiCo is taking advantage of yields on investment-grade
corporate bonds at about the lowest in five months after
reporting a 27 percent gain in first-quarter sales and profit
that exceeded analysts’ estimates. Its bonds returned 1.2
percent last month, trailing the broader investment-grade debt
market’s 1.7 percent return, according to Bank of America
Merrill Lynch index data.  The $750 million of two-year notes pay 8 basis points more
than the three-month London interbank offered rate and the $1
billion of five-year, 2.5 percent debt yields 57 basis points
above similar-maturity Treasuries, Bloomberg data show.  A basis point is 0.01 percentage point. Three-month Libor,
a lending benchmark, was set today at 0.27 percent.  Bank of America Corp., Citigroup Inc. and Royal Bank of
Scotland Group Plc managed the sale, according to the filing.
The bonds are rated Aa3 by Moody’s Investors Service and are
expected to be ranked A- by  Standard & Poor’s .  In its previous bond offering on Oct. 19, PepsiCo issued
$2.25 billion of three-, 10- and 30-year securities, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Yields on investment-grade U.S. corporate bonds averaged
3.89 percent yesterday after touching 3.86 percent on April 29,
the lowest level since November, Bank of America Merrill Lynch
index data show.  PepsiCo’s first-quarter sales rose to $11.9 billion,
compared with the $11.8 billion average of estimates compiled by
Bloomberg. Excluding items such as integration costs and hedges,
profit was 74 cents, compared with the 73-cent analyst average.  To contact the reporter on this story:
