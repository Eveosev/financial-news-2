Finance Minister  George Papaconstantinou  said a restructuring of  Greece ’s debt, causing
losses for bondholders, would lock the country out of markets
for a decade or more.  “A restructuring, a debt haircut, would be a huge mistake
for the country,” Papaconstantinou said in an interview on
state-run NET TV today. “It would have a tremendous cost, with
no benefit. Greece would be out of markets for 10, 15 years.”  Greece, which received a 110 billion-euro ($163 billion)
bailout last year, can rely on emergency loans from the euro
area and the  International Monetary Fund  as well as Treasury-
bill sales to meet its funding needs through 2011. Under the aid
plan, Greece is supposed to regain  market access  next year and
refinance at least three-quarters of its maturing medium- and
long-term debt. Greece’s 10-year bond yield was at 15.5 percent
as of 8:44 a.m. in  London .  In March, euro-area leaders decided to let the  European
Financial Stability Facility  purchase bonds directly from
governments in an aid program. The plan to let the EFSF buy debt
from governments depends on Greece sticking to the program to
reduce its deficits, Papaconstantinou said.  “We must do what we said we would and what we should be
doing anyway,” he said. He reiterated that any future decision
by the EU and the IMF to further extend the repayment period of
the bailout loans would be welcome.  Funding Needs  Greece’s financing needs for 2011 total 58 billion euros
and are fully covered by the bailout and bill sales, the  Finance
Ministry  said on March 13. In 2012, borrowing needs total 66
billion euros, with 24 billion euros to come from the aid
package, 2 billion euros from state-asset sales and 13 billion
euros from bill sales. That leaves 27 billion euros in funding
that must be covered by investors or the Luxembourg-based EFSF.  Greece’s deficit reached a euro-area record of 15.4 percent
of gross domestic product in 2009. It dropped to 10.5 percent of
GDP last year and is targeted to fall to 7.4 percent this year
and to within the European Union’s 3 percent limit in 2014.  Greece’s economy, in its third year of a recession, is
forecast by the government to shrink 3 percent this year before
returning to growth in 2012. The country’s debt is projected to
peak at 159 percent of GDP in 2012.  To contact the reporter on this story:
