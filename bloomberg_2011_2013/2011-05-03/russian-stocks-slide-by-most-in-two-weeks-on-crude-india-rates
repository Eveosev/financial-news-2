Russian stocks dropped the most in
more than two weeks as oil declined and emerging-market stocks
retreated after the  Reserve Bank  of  India  raised  interest rates 
more than expected.  The Micex Index slid 2.9 percent to 1,691.45 by the 6:45
p.m. close in Moscow, its biggest loss since April 18. OAO
Rosneft, Russia’s biggest oil producer, and OAO Gazprom, the
country’s gas export monopoly, both fell more than 3 percent.
OAO GMK Norilsk Nickel and Magnitogorsk Iron & Steel both
slumped by at least 5 percent. The dollar-denominated RTS Index
lost 2.8 percent to 1,976.74.  India’s central bank increased its repurchase rate by half
a percentage point, a move forecast by only seven of 25
economists in a Bloomberg News survey, and predicted inflation
will stay at about 9 percent until September. Oil slid for a
second day.  “ Russia  is going with the emerging-markets flow,” Marco
Casas, a Moscow-based vice-president for equity sales at
Otkritie Financial Corp., said in e-mailed comments.  The MSCI Emerging Markets Index slumped 1.5 percent to
1,190.56, its steepest decline since April 18. India’s Bombay
Stock Exchange Sensitive Index dropped the most since Feb. 24,
losing 2.4 percent.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
