Demand for Swedish and Norwegian
companies helped boost private equity investments in Nordic
countries amid “sustainable” economic growth in the region,
 Argentum Fondsinvesteringer AS  said.  Nordic private equity investments rose to 2.7 billion euros
($4 billion) in the first quarter from 1.6 billion euros a year
earlier, the Bergen, Norway-based asset manager said in a report
today. Exits by private equity funds increased during the first
three months of 2011, with international firms showing strong
interest in Norwegian companies, Argentum said.  “Most of the Nordic managers raised funds before the
financial crisis,” Maria Borch Helsengreen, head of business
development at the asset manager, said by phone. “After three
or four years they are now invested and the managers are coming
back to raise money for their next investments.”  A “substantial” proportion of private-equity funds in
 Europe  will be raised in  Sweden , Norway, Denmark and Finland
this year as their economies have shown “resilience to
financial troubles and can point to sustainable economic growth
rates,” according to Argentum.  To contact the reporter on this story:
