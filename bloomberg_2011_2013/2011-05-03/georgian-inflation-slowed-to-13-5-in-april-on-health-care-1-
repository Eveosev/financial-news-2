Georgian consumer-price growth slowed
to an annual 13.5 percent in April, mainly on lower
communication and health care prices, the statistics office in
Tbilisi said in an e-mailed statement today.  Inflation slowed from 13.9 percent a month earlier,
according to the statement, even as food-price growth continued
to accelerate, the office said.  In the month, prices declined 0.1 percent, the first drop
since July 2010.  To contact the reporter on this story:
