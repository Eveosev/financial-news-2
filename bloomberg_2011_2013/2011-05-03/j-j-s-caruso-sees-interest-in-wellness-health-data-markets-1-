Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) , the world’s second-
biggest seller of health products, is exploring a move into the
wellness and prevention and health-information technology
markets, Chief Financial Officer Dominic Caruso said.  The company has been studying whether to expand beyond its
core businesses of pharmaceuticals, medical devices and consumer
products and decided wellness and technology are “two areas we
could actually make a difference in and would be close enough to
our current forte,” Caruso said in a presentation at a Deutsche
Bank AG conference in Boston today.  J&J generated $61.6 billion in revenue last year, second
among medical companies only to New York-based  Pfizer Inc. (PFE)  New
Brunswick, New Jersey-based J&J said on April 27 that it was
buying orthopedic-device maker  Synthes Inc. (SYST)  for $21.3 billion in
the biggest acquisition in its 125-year history.  To contact the reporter on this story:
