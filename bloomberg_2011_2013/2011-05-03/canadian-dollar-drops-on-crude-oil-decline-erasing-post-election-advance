The Canadian dollar fell as crude oil
declined, erasing gains in the currency that came after Prime
Minister Stephen Harperâ€™s  Conservative Party  won a majority of
seats in Parliament for the first time.  The loonie, as the currency is known, depreciated 0.2
percent to 95.26 cents against the U.S. dollar at 6:21 a.m. in
Toronto, from 95.06 yesterday. It earlier advanced as much as
0.5 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
