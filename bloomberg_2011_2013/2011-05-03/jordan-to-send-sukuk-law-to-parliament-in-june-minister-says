Jordan aims to submit a draft law
paving the way for the sale of sukuk, or Islamic bonds, to
parliament in June, the country’s finance minister said.  “Once it’s ratified, we will then take a decision based on
our needs as to if we will issue conventional bonds like we did
last year or sukuk,” Mohammad Abu Hammour said at a conference
in Amman, Jordan today. He said the sale amount “won’t be less
than $500 million, but if we see there is an appetite and market
conditions are favourable we may go higher.”  The kingdom sold $750 million of five-year bonds in
November to help finance the budget gap.  To contact the reporter on this story:
