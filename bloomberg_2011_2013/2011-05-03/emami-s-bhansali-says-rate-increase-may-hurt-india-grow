N. Bhansali, chief financial officer
at consumer and health-care products maker Emami Ltd., comments
after the  Reserve Bank  of  India  today raised borrowing costs by
50 basis points, a decision predicted by seven of the 25
economists surveyed by Bloomberg. The rest expected a quarter-
point increase.  Bhansali spoke over the phone from Kolkata.  “Most of our funds, raised for expansion, are in foreign
currencies. There may be a small hit in our Indian borrowings
but overall our expansion and borrowing plans will not be
impacted. Ideal currency for us is the dollar because we have
the advantage of enjoying falling dollar rates.  ‘‘Liquidity tightening will hurt Indian economic growth to
some extent. It may also slow sales and profitability of
companies but the Reserve Bank doesn’t have a choice as it has
to contain inflation.  ‘‘There may not be a big impact on the purchasing power of
our consumers. It is more of a psychological pressure.’’  -- With assistance from Subramaniam Sharma in  New Delhi . Editor:
