ProLogis (PLD)  European Properties,  Europe ’s
biggest warehouse operator, said its management and independent
board members have rejected as “inadequate” last month’s
takeover bid by ProLogis.  ProLogis European, or PEPR, made the announcement in a
statement today. ProLogis offered 6.10 euros for each ordinary
unit of PEPR, valuing the fund at 1.2 billion euros ($1.8
billion).  PEPR was created in 1999 as a closed-end real estate
investment fund externally managed by a subsidiary of Denver-
based ProLogis, the world’s largest investor in warehouses. The
U.S. company, PEPR’s largest shareholder, made its bid on April
14 after receiving an approach from APG Algemene Pensioen Groep
NV and  Goodman Group. (GMG)   “Neither the independent members of the PEPR board nor the
managers of the management company intend to accept the offer in
respect of their own holdings of units,” the Luxembourg-based
company said in the statement.  ProLogis has received for tender or purchased on the open
market 8,818 ordinary units of PEPR, the company said in a
separate statement. That gives the U.S. company a 39 percent
stake in PEPR, little changed since the April 22 offer was made.  ProLogis will “continue to fulfill its obligations as a
significant owner and manager of  ProLogis European Properties (PEPR) ,”
it said in an additional statement following PEPR’s release.  PEPR was little changed at 6.14 euros as of 11:14 a.m. in
Amsterdam, giving the company a market value of 1.17 billion
euros.  Not Full Value  “Based on our strategy, business plans and the quality of
our portfolio, we believe that the offer does not reflect the
full value potential of PEPR,” Peter Cassells, the company’s
chief executive officer, said in the statement.  ProLogis and APG have clashed over the legal structure of
the fund, which owns 232 properties across Europe with a value
of 2.8 billion euros.  APG is the Amsterdam-based manager of Europe’s biggest
retirement plan and Sydney-based Goodman is  Australia ’s biggest
industrial real estate investment trust by market value. Both
they and ProLogis offered less than PEPR’s net asset value of
6.37 per unit in the three months through March.  Third Avenue Management LLC sold its 5.49 percent stake to
ProLogis, which meant that under Luxembourg takeover rules, the
company had to make a bid for all of the units after its stake
exceeded the 33.33 percent threshold.  Fir Tree Partners, a New-York based investment firm that
owns 4.3 percent of PEPR said on April 27, that it opposes the
tender offer.  ProLogis also offered 6.10 euros for each convertible
preferred unit.  To contact the reporters on this story:
