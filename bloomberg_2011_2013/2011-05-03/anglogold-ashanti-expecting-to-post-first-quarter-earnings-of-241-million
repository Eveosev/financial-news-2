AngloGold Ashanti Ltd. (ANG) , the world’s
third-largest gold miner, expects to report a fourfold jump in
profit for the first quarter as it ended forward sales and
prices rose to a record.  Earnings attributable to shareholders probably gained to
about $241 million, or 62 cents a share, from $56 million, or 15
cents, in the prior three months, Johannesburg-based AngloGold
said in a statement. Output is forecast at 1.04 million ounces,
within earlier guidance, and costs at $706 an ounce, higher than
the previous estimate of $700 as  oil prices  and royalties rose.  AngloGold and Barrick Gold Corp., the largest producer of
the metal, have canceled forward sales of gold to benefit from
prices, which climbed to a record $1,437.40 an ounce last
quarter. AngloGold will release its earnings on May 11.  AngloGold may post adjusted earnings excluding one-time
items of 53 U.S. cents, after a $1.99 loss in the previous
quarter, according to the statement. Analysts who track South
African mining companies measure quarter-on-quarter profit.  The company declined 10.78 rand, or 3.2 percent, to 322
rand by the 5 p.m. close of trading in Johannesburg.  Newmont
Mining Corp. (NEM)  is the world’s second-largest gold producer.  To contact the reporter on this story:
