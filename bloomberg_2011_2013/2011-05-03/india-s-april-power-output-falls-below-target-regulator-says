Indian power utilities generated 8
percent less electricity than a state-mandated target amid a
shortage of coal, the Central Electricity Authority said in a
 report  on its website.  Electricity production from April 1 to April 29 was 63,655
million kilowatt-hours compared with a targeted 69,237 million,
according to the regulator.  There were 28 coal-fired generators with fuel stockpiles at
a “critical” level of less than seven days’ supply and 11
generators with a “super critical” level of less than four
days’ inventory on April 28, according to the Central
Electricity Authority. That compares with typical stocks of 25
to 30 days, the regulator said.  India added record power capacity in the year ended March
31, expanding output by 15,795 megawatts. The increase was led
by NTPC Ltd., Adani Power Ltd., Reliance Power Ltd. and Tata
Power Co.,  India  Coal Market Watch said last month, citing Power
Minister Sushil Kumar Shinde.  To contact the reporter on this story:
