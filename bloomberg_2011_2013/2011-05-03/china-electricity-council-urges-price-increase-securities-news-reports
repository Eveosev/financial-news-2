The  China  Electricity Council has
asked the government to “appropriately” increase power prices
to help ease supply shortages, the Shanghai Securities News
reported today. It didn’t say if the increase was urged for
retail or on-grid prices.  The council has also asked that the government approve the
start of more large hydropower projects, the Shanghai-based
newspaper reported. China should also build some new coal-fired
power plants, the newspaper reported, citing the council.  These projects would help China avoid possible shortfalls
in the supply of electricity during the five years through 2015,
according to the report.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
