Czech ruling coalition parties
disagree on details of the planned pension-system overhaul,
which is aimed at strengthening private savings for retirement,
 Hospodarske Noviny  reported, citing party officials.  The TOP09 party opposes a demand by the Public Affairs
party that the one of the pension funds managing retirement
savings has to be guaranteed by the state, Hospodarske quoted
Finance Minister Miroslav Kalousek, a TOP09 member, as saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
