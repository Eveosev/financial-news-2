President  Barack Obama ’s televised
address to the nation announcing U.S. military forces had killed
al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden drew 56 million viewers, Nielsen
Co. said.  The 9-minute speech, which started at 11:35 p.m. New York
time on May 1, was carried live by nine networks including  CNN ,
ABC and  Fox News , New York-based Nielsen said today in an e-
mailed statement.  The audience was more than double the size of Obama’s March
28 address on Libya, Nielsen said. His August 2010 speech on
 Iraq  was seen by more than 29 million people, and his December
2009 address on Afghanistan attracted 40.8 million viewers,
Nielsen said.  Bin Laden was killed in a firefight by U.S. naval commandos
who raided his hideout in a high-security compound in
Abbottabad,  Pakistan , 55 kilometers (35 miles) north of
Islamabad. The Saudi-born bin Laden, 54, helped found al-Qaeda
in 1988, the group responsible for terrorist acts including the
Sept. 11, 2001 attacks on the World Trade Center and the
Pentagon.  To contact the reporter on this story:
