Canadian government bonds strengthened
after Conservative Prime Minister Stephen Harper won a majority
government for the first time, allowing him to pursue plans to
erase the  budget deficit  and cut corporate taxes.  The yield on the nation’s 10-year debt fell as much as six
basis points, or 0.06 percentage points, to 3.148 percent, the
lowest since March 18. The price of the 3.5 percent bonds due in
June 2020 climbed 32 cents to C$102.69 at 9:55 a.m. in Toronto.  “Tax changes for the corporations will remain in place,
which will clearly please the investing public,” said Andrew Parkinson, a  money manager  at Van Arbor Asset Management Ltd. in
 Vancouver , which manages about C$50 million ($53 million).  The Canadian dollar rose against more than half of its 16
major peers, climbing the most, 0.9 percent, against the British
pound. Canadian stocks dropped along with shares worldwide.  The Conservatives won 167 districts, above the 155 seats
needed to form a majority in the House of Commons,  Elections
Canada  data show. A majority government doesn’t require the
support of opposition parties to pass laws. Harper garnered the
first Conservative wins in central Toronto, the nation’s biggest
city, since 1988.  The  New Democratic Party , led by  Jack Layton , won 102
seats, and will be the Official Opposition for the first time.
The NDP displaced the  Liberal Party , which was reduced to 34
seats, the lowest total in its history. The NDP also won almost
all of the ridings previously held by the separatist  Bloc
Quebecois , which shrunk to four seats from 49 in 2008.  Erase Deficit  Harper, 52, oversees the economy with the fastest growth
and among the lowest deficits of the Group of Seven nations. The
loonie has been the strongest in the G-7 over the past two
years. Finance Minister  Jim Flaherty , who was re-elected in his
riding near Toronto, has said the government plans to eliminate
the deficit by the 2014-2015 fiscal year.  Two-year  government bonds  also increased, pushing the yield
down 2 basis points to as low as 1.679 percent, the least since
March 23. The price of the 1.75 percent bonds due in March 2013
gained 4 cents to C$100.12.  The Canadian dollar erased initial gains versus its U.S.
counterpart, trading little changed at 95.21 cents. It earlier
reached 94.59 cents, near last week’s three-year high of 94.46.
One Canadian dollar buys $1.0502.  Favorite Party  “The Conservatives are always the favorite party for
financial markets, so it should be a positive result for
Canadian assets,” said Charles St-Arnaud, Canadian economist
and foreign exchange strategist at Nomura Securities
International in  New York . “The fact that he will pass the tax
cuts for corporations, that’s something investors appreciate,
also a strong commitment to a balanced budget.”  Canadian government bonds have returned 5.2 percent over
the past year as of yesterday, according to Bank of America
Merrill Lynch index data, compared with a 2.8 percent average
for the G-7.  “It will be relatively positive for government bonds,”
said Hosen Marjaee, senior managing director at Manulife Asset
Management in Toronto, which oversees about C$16 billion in
fixed-income assets. “The Conservatives had a plan to balance
the budget. They are going to be able to stay on the plan
without extra spending being introduced in the program.”  To contact the reporters for this story:
