The crude-oil tanker market will be
stronger in the second half of 2011 than in the first as demand
picks up, Overseas Shipholding Group Chief Executive Officer
Morten Arntzen said.  Increasing production from the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries and rising oil consumption from  Japan  to
replace output from damaged nuclear plants will raise demand for
tankers, Arntzen said today in an earnings conference call.  To contact the reporter on this story:
