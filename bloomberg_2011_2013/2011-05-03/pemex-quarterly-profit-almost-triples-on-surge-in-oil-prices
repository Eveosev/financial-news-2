Petroleos Mexicanos , Latin America’s
largest oil producer, said quarterly profit rose to the highest
since June 2008 as crude prices increased.  Net income almost tripled to 4.21 billion pesos ($365
million) from 1.44 billion pesos in the year-earlier period, the
Mexico City-based company said yesterday in a statement. Revenue
increased 15 percent to 352.7 billion pesos.  The state-owned company, headed by Chief Executive Officer
 Juan Jose Suarez Coppel , is benefiting from a 20 percent rally
in the average price of New York-traded oil futures in the first
quarter compared with a year earlier. The Mexican crude mix, a
basket of different grades of oil that the nation exports,
traded at its smallest average discount ever in the quarter to
West Texas Intermediate, the U.S. benchmark mix.  The company said April 14 that its petrochemicals business
had first-quarter net income of 32 million pesos, the unit’s
first quarterly profit in at least a decade. Exports from Pemex
Petroquimica, as the unit is known, doubled to 1.2 billion
pesos, according to yesterday’s earnings filing.  Oil exports from  Mexico , the second-largest supplier to the
U.S. after  Canada , climbed 9.9 percent to 1.37 million barrels a
day in the first quarter from 1.25 million barrels a year
earlier, the  oil company  known as Pemex said on April 28.  Pemex said net debt as of March 31 dropped 1.1 percent to
525 billion pesos. The company expects to increase total debt by
as much as $1.5 billion this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
