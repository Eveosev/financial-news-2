South Africa  sold seven-year bonds at
the lowest yield since January amid signs a weak economic
recovery may allow the central bank to hold borrowing costs at a
30-year low this year.  The Reserve Bank sold 1.3 billion rand of the 8 percent
securities maturing in 2018 at an average yield of 8.38 percent
at its weekly auction, the lowest yield since the auction on
Jan. 14. Investors bid for 1.91 times the amount on offer, the
Pretoria-based central bank said on its Bloomberg page. The bank
also auctioned 800 million rand of 10.5 percent notes due 2026
at an average yield of 8.67 percent, the lowest since the
auction on Feb. 18, with investors bidding for 4.09 times the
amount on offer.  Money supply and credit growth in  Africa ’s biggest economy
unexpectedly slowed in March, the  Reserve Bank  said on April 29.
The purchasing managers’ index fell in April, Kagiso Securities
Ltd. said today, indicating a weak recovery in manufacturing,
while the jobless rate increased to 25 percent in the first
quarter, according to the Pretoria-based government statistics
agency.  The data indicates that “domestic demand is still weak and
rate hikes are not an option at this juncture,” BNP Paribas
analysts led by London-based Paul Mortimer-Lee said in an e-
mailed research note before the bond auction. Lower  interest
rates  boost the returns of fixed-interest bonds relative to
cash.  To contact the reporter on this story:
