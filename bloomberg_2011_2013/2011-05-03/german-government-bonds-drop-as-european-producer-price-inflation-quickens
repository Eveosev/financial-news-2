German 10-year bonds declined after
European producer-price inflation unexpectedly accelerated to
the fastest in 2 1/2 years in March.  The 10-year yield rose three basis points to 3.28 percent
as of 10:04 a.m. in  London . The two-year yield increased one
basis point to 1.82 percent.  Factory-gate prices in the euro region jumped 6.7 percent
from a year earlier, the fastest since September 2008, after a
6.6 percent gain in February, the European Unionâ€™s statistics
office in Luxembourg said today. Economists had projected a
March increase of 6.6 percent, according to the median of 13
estimates in a Bloomberg news survey. In the month, prices
advanced 0.7 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
