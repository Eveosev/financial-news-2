Kenya ’s security forces remain on high
alert following the killing of al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden,
said police spokesman Eric Kiraithe.  Kenyan police warned two weeks ago that Somalia’s al-
Shabaab militia, which the U.S. accuses of having links to al-
Qaeda, threatened to carry out attacks in Kenya over the Easter
weekend through April 25. No attack took place.  “We will retain the high security for a while as we monitor
the situation, though the situation is generally calm,” Kiraithe
told reporters today in the port city of Mombasa.  In August 1998, at least 213 people died in an attack on
the U.S. Embassy in downtown Nairobi. Al-Qaeda claimed
responsibility for the bombing.  To contact the reporter on this story:
