China’s stocks climbed, driving the
benchmark index to its biggest two-day increase in four weeks,
on the prospect slowing manufacturing growth may allow the
central bank to delay further increases in  interest rates .  A gauge of consumer staples rose the most among 10 industry
groups as inflation concerns eased after the Purchasing
Managers’ Index fell to 52.9 in April from 53.4 in March.
 Huaneng Power International Inc. (600011)  paced gains for utility stocks
for a second day on speculation the government may allow power
producers to boost prices. A measure of small-company stocks
advanced the most since February, led by technology companies.  The manufacturing data are “positive in that the figures
are showing that China’s series of tightening moves may finally
be paying off,” said Lim Chang Gue, a  fund manager  in Seoul at
Samsung Asset Management Co., which oversees about $29 billion.  The Shanghai Composite Index, which tracks the bigger of
China’s stock exchanges, advanced 20.7 points, or 0.7 percent,
to 2,932.19 at the 3 p.m. close. The two-day gain of 1.6 percent
is the most since April 6. The  CSI 300 Index (SHSZ300)  increased 0.6
percent to 3,211.13 and the CSI Smallcap 500 Index added 1.7
percent. China’s markets were closed yesterday for a holiday.  The Shanghai Composite has slid 4.1 percent from a five-
month high on April 18 amid concern the government will add to
10 increases in lenders’ reserve requirements and four rises in
interest rates to cool inflation. The drop has pared the stocks
gauge’s advance this year to 4.4 percent.  Manufacturing Growth  The manufacturing data from the logistics federation and
statistics bureau on May 1 trailed a median forecast of 53.9 in
a Bloomberg News survey of 20 economists. A level above 50
signals expansion.  China’s interest-rate swaps dropped the most in three weeks
after manufacturing growth slowed in April, spurring speculation
policy makers will have less of a need to rely on interest-rate
increases to cool the economy.  The one-year interest-rate swap contract, the fixed cost
needed to receive the floating seven-day repurchase rate,
dropped three basis points to 3.43 percent as of 10:41 a.m. in
 Shanghai , according to data compiled by Bloomberg. That was the
biggest decline since April 12.  “The smaller PMI figure prompted the market to speculate
that space for further interest-rate hikes will be limited,”
said  Frances Cheung , a senior strategist at Credit Agricole CIB
in  Hong Kong .  Credit Suisse Group AG cut its forecast for consumer price
inflation to 5.4 percent from 5.6 percent for this year, analyst
Dong Tao wrote in a report. The nation’s inflation rate rose to
5.4 percent in March, exceeding the government’s full-year
inflation target of 4 percent.  Consumer Staples  A gauge of consumer staples in the CSI 300 rose 2.1
percent. Kweichow Moutai Co., China’s largest maker of baijiu
liquor, added 2 percent to 185.86 yuan.  Chongqing Brewery Co. (600132) ,
the second-biggest brewer, jumped 2.9 percent to 60.74 yuan.  Rising material prices have hurt consumer staples producers
as they have had difficulty passing on higher costs to
consumers. The nation’s top planning agency held meetings with
major liquor makers about price controls on March 31, Caixin
reported April 7.  A gauge of  utility companies  in the CSI 300 Index climbed
1.2 percent, the second most among the 10 industry groups.
Huaneng Power, the listed unit of China’s largest power group,
advanced for a second day, jumping 4.1 percent to 6.34 yuan. GD
Power Development Co. advanced 1.2 percent to 3.40 yuan.  China may face a summer power shortage of 30 million
kilowatts as supply lags behind demand growth, the  China 
Electricity Council said April 28.  Coal Stocks  “If the shortage lasts for more than one year, China may
need to approve more coal-fired power projects, but before tha
they need to raise tariffs more so that independent power
producers will be willing to spend on additional capital
expenses,” Dave Dai, an analyst at Securities Capital Markets,
said in an e-mailed response to questions.  China Shenhua Energy Co., a unit of the country’s biggest
coal producer, rose 0.5 percent to 29.81 yuan after posting a 17
percent increase in first-quarter profit. Its share gains have
lagged those of rival Yanzhou Coal Mining Co. and thermal coal
prices may “start to fly” from the second quarter because of
high demand before the summer, UOB-Kay Hian said in a report.
China Shenhua has advanced 21 percent this year, compared with
Yanzhou’s gain of 26 percent.  Power-station coal prices at the a benchmark Qinhuangdao
port rose to 805 yuan to 820 yuan a metric ton as of yesterday,
according to data from China Coal Transport and Distribution
Association today.  SUFA Technology Industry Co., a valve manufacturer, led
gains for smallcaps, surging by the 10 percent daily limit to
28.78 yuan.  Gold Stocks  Zijin Mining Group Co., China’s largest gold miner by
market value, dropped 2.1 percent to 7.56 yuan. Zhongjin Gold
Co. plunged 3.3 percent to 35.15 yuan.  Gold dropped for a second day as Osama  bin Laden ’s death
boosted the dollar, reducing the appeal of precious metals as
alternative investments. Immediate-delivery gold fell as much as
1.3 percent to $1,525.45 an ounce and traded at $1,540.05 at
10:23 a.m. in  Singapore  after reaching a record $1,577.57
yesterday. Bullion for June in  New York  fell as much as 2.6
percent to $1,516.20.  Bin Laden, who helped found the al-Qaeda terrorist network,
was killed in  Pakistan  in a firefight with a team of U.S.
operatives who raided the compound where he had been hiding,
U.S. President  Barack Obama  said.  China said the death of bin Laden is an important event and
“positive development” for international anti-terrorism
efforts, according to a statement posted by the foreign ministry
on its website, citing spokeswoman Jiang Yu.  --Irene Shen. With assistance from Saeromi Shin in  Seoul .
