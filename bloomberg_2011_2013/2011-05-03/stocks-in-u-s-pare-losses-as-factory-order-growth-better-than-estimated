U.S. stocks pared an early drop after
government data showed factory orders climbed more than
forecast, bolstering confidence in the economy.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index slipped less than 0.1
percent to 1,360.7 at 10:04 a.m. in  New York  after retreating as
much as 0.4 percent earlier. The  Dow Jones Industrial Average 
climbed 19 points, or 0.2 percent, to 12,826.36.  Earlier losses came as a stronger dollar weighed on
commodity producers.  Stocks headed higher as bookings for manufacturers’ goods
climbed 3 percent, a fifth consecutive increase, after a 0.7
percent February advance, the Commerce Department said today.
The report also revised up estimates for capital equipment
bookings issued last week.  The  S&P 500  has risen 8.2 percent this year through
yesterday amid government stimulus measures and higher-than-
estimated corporate profits. Earnings-per-share beat estimates
at about three-quarters of the 334 companies in the S&P 500 tha
reported results since April 11, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
