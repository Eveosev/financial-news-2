Gasoline and heating oil fell as crude
oil tumbled amid expectations for higher supplies, equities
retreated and silver plunged on higher margin requirements.  Heating oil sank 1.9 percent and gasoline lost 0.6 percent
as crude oil slipped. Analysts surveyed by Bloomberg News
projected U.S. oil stockpiles rose last week to a six-month
high. Silver for July delivery declined 7.6 percent and the
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index lost 0.7 percent as of 2:33 p.m. in
 New York .  “We were very overbought,” said Ray Carbone, president of
Paramount Options Inc. in New York. “Raising the margin on some
commodities created a good excuse to take profits and now it’s
snowballing.”  Gasoline for June delivery dropped 1.85 cents, or 0.6
percent, to settle at $3.3294 a gallon on the  New York
Mercantile Exchange . That’s the first time prices have declined
for two straight days since April 19.  Silver slid as exchange owner  CME Group Inc. (CME)  raised margin
requirements for the second time in less than a week.  “There were very large trading accounts long in precious
metals and crude oil that are selling and it’s bleeding into
other markets,” said  James Cordier , portfolio manager at
OptionSellers.com in Tampa, Florida. “Raising the margins on
silver started the selloff. People are taking risk off the
table.”  June-delivery crude dropped $2.47, or 2.2 percent, to
settle at $111.05 a barrel on the Nymex.  Brent crude  for June
settlement lost $2.67 to settle at $122.45 on  London ’s ICE
Futures Europe exchange.  Manufacturing  Futures also slipped after reports indicated slower
manufacturing growth in the U.S. and China, which could reduce
fuel demand. The  Institute for Supply Management ’s manufacturing
index fell to a four-month low in April. China’s Purchasing
Managers’ index fell to 52.9 in April from 53.4 the prior month.  Gasoline supplies probably fell 500,000 barrels last week,
according to the median estimate of 15 analysts in the survey by
Bloomberg. Stockpiles were at a 20-month low in the week ended
April 22, according to Energy Department data, after falling
35.5 million barrels since Feb. 11. The department is scheduled
to report on stockpiles at 10:30 a.m. tomorrow in Washington.  “The expectation that product inventories are going to
draw based on the refining problems is the most bullish factor
today,” said  Andy Lipow , president of Lipow Oil Associates LLC
in Houston, who estimated supplies fell 1.5 million last week.
“But that might be outweighed by the bearish manufacturing
indexes here and in  China .”  Inventories of distillates, including heating oil and
diesel, likely rose 500,000 barrels, according to the survey.
Refinery rates increased 0.5 percentage point.  Regular retail gasoline rose 1.5 cents to $3.967 a gallon
yesterday, AAA said on its website. That’s the highest price
since July 26, 2008. The record was $4.114 on July 15 of that
year.  Heating oil for June delivery sank 6.13 cents, or 1.9
percent, to settle at $3.1908 a gallon on the exchange.  To contact the reporter on this story:
