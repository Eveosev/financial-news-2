Clorox Co. (CLX) , the maker of the namesake
bleach, fell the most in almost three months after cutting the
top end of its annual profit forecast, citing higher-than-
anticipated commodity costs and a challenging economy.  Earnings per share from continuing operations will be as
much as $3.95, the Oakland, California-based company said today
in a statement. In February, Clorox projected profit of as much
as $4.  Clorox, led by Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Don Knauss, also forecast 2012 earnings that fell short of analysts’
projections. The maker of Glad trash bags plans to increase
prices to help counter surging costs for materials, which have
eaten into profitability.  The shares fell $2.52, or 3.6 percent, to $67.47 at 4:01
p.m. on the New York Stock Exchange, the most since Feb. 14.
They have gained 6.6 percent this year, compared with a 7.9
percent increase in the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index.  Profit for the year ending June 2012 will amount to $4 to
$4.10 a share, Clorox said. That compares with the $4.42 average
of estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
