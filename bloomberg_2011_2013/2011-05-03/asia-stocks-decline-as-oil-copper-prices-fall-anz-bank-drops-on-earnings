Asian stocks declined, with a regional
benchmark index falling the most in three weeks, as raw material
producers fell and  Australia  &  New Zealand  Banking Group Ltd.
and Hon Hai Precision Industry Co. posted earnings that missed
analysts’ estimates.  BHP Billiton Ltd. (BHP) , the world’s biggest mining company and
Australia’s No. 1 oil and gas producer, and rival  Rio Tinto 
Group fell at least 0.7 percent after crude and copper futures
declined. ANZ Bank lost 2.1 percent. Hon Hai, the largest global
contract maker of electronics, slipped 2.3 percent in Taipei.
 HTC Corp. (2498) , the Taiwanese smartphone maker, tumbled 6.9 percent
after HSBC Holdings Plc and Credit Suisse Group AG cut their
ratings on the stock.  The MSCI Asia Pacific Excluding Japan Index dropped 1.3
percent to 502.28 at 4:40 p.m. in  Hong Kong , the worst
performance since April 12. More than two stocks declined for
each that rose. The measure lost 0.3 percent last week as
companies from Acer Inc. to LG Electronics Inc. posted earnings
that missed estimates, sparking concern global growth may not be
sustained even as the U.S. Federal Reserve renewed its pledge to
stimulate growth in the world’s biggest economy by keeping
interest rates low.  “It’s a fragile situation for markets,” Peter Elston, a
Singapore-based strategist at Aberdeen Asset Management Plc,
which oversees about $281.6 billion, told Bloomberg Television.
“In the emerging world, inflation is accelerating and in the
developed world, economies are still deleveraging. We are very
worried about inflation.”  Australia,  India  Rates  Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 Index decreased 0.8 percent as the
nation’s central bank left its benchmark interest rate unchanged
today for a fifth straight meeting, signaling a record local
dollar will help contain consumer prices until later this year.
New Zealand’s NZX 50 Index lost 0.1 percent.  India’s Sensitive Index dropped 1.6 percent after the
country’s central bank raised interest rates by half a
percentage point, more than analysts forecast, after it
predicted inflation will stay around 9 percent until September
because of higher fuel prices.  South Korea ’s  Kospi Index (KOSPI)  declined 1.3 percent, the most
among Asia-Pacific indexes. Taiwan’s Taiex Index sank 0.7
percent. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index fell 0.4 percent after
swinging between gains and losses.  China ’s Shanghai Composite
Index gained 0.7 percent, erasing losses of as much as 0.7
percent. Japanese markets are closed for a public holiday.  Futures on the U.S. Standard & Poor’s 500 Index dropped 0.2
percent today. U.S. stocks fell in  New York  yesterday from a
near three-year high as declines in commodity producers
overshadowed the killing of al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden.  U.S., China Manufacturing  The impact of bin Laden’s death on stock markets is
“absolutely miniscule,” Elston said. “There are plenty of
other forces that are driving the market that render the impact
of this development irrelevant and meaningless.”  Oil for June delivery decreased as much as 0.8 percent
cents to $112.63 a barrel in electronic trading on the  New York
Mercantile Exchange , extending its decline for a second day, on
signs U.S. economic growth may moderate and as volatility
increased on concern the killing of bin Laden may lead to
retaliatory attacks.  Copper for three-month delivery on the London Metal
Exchange fell as much as 1.1 percent to $9,219.75 a metric ton,
the lowest price since April 18.  The  Institute for Supply Management ’s U.S. manufacturing
index fell to 60.4 in April from 61.2 a month earlier, the Tempe,
Arizona- based group said yesterday. A report released on May 1
showed China’s manufacturing index unexpectedly fell after the
government raised interest rates and lenders’ reserve
requirements.  Woodside Petroleum Ltd. (WPL) , Australia’s second-largest oil and
gas producer, dipped 1 percent to A$45.85 in Sydney.  BHP
Billiton  declined 1.4 percent to A$45.50. Rio Tinto dropped 0.7
percent to A$82.11. Jiangxi Copper Co., China’s biggest producer
of the metal, slid 1.9 percent to HK$25.85 in Hong Kong.  Asia Earnings  About 42 percent of companies on the MSCI Asia Pacific
Excluding Japan Index that reported earnings since April 11 beat
analysts’ estimates. That compares with 62 percent for the MSCI
World Index of developed stock markets.  ANZ Bank, Australia’s third-biggest lender, decreased 2.1
percent to A$23.80 after saying first-half net income increased
38 percent from a year earlier to A$2.66 billion ($2.91 billion).
That missed the A$2.77 billion median estimate of six analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg News.  Fairfax Media Ltd. (FXJ) , Australia’s second-largest newspaper
publisher, plunged 8 percent to A$1.205, the worst performer in
the MSCI Asia Pacific Excluding Japan Index. The company said
earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, amortization and
one-time items will be about A$600 million in the 12 months
ending June. That compares with the A$647 million average of 12
analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  Hon Hai, HTC  Hon Hai dropped 2.3 percent to NT$106. The company said
first-quarter net income slumped 20 percent from a year earlier
to NT$14.4 billion ($503 million), missing the average profit
estimate of NT$16 billion by nine analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  HTC slumped 6.9 percent to NT$1,210 in Taipei. HSBC cut its
rating on the stock to “underweight” from “neutral,” while
Credit Suisse lowered its recommendation to “neutral” from
“outperform.”  The MSCI Asia Pacific Excluding Japan Index climbed 6.3
percent this year through yesterday, compared with gains of 8.2
percent by the S&P 500 and 2.9 percent by the Stoxx Europe 600
Index. Stocks in the Asian benchmark are valued at 13.1 times
estimated earnings on average as of the last close, compared
with 13.8 times for the S&P 500 and 11.5 times for the Stoxx 600.  To contact the reporter on this story:
