Botswanan state worker unions agreed
to extend a strike for another five days after failing to agree
on a pay deal with the government, said Andrew Motsamai,
secretary-general of the Botswana Federation of Public Service
Unions.  The unions also agreed to engage in a “go-slow” after
returning to work at the end of the strike, Motsamai said today
by phone from Gaborone, the capital.  State workers started a 10-day strike to demand a 16
percent pay rise on April 18. The state is offering a 5 percent
increase.  To contact the reporter on this story:
