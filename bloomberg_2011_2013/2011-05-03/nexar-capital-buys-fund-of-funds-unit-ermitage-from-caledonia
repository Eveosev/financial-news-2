Nexar Capital Group, a Paris-based
firm that invests client money in  hedge funds , agreed to buy
Ermitage Ltd. from Caledonia Investments Plc for an undisclosed
price.  The acquisition of London-based Ermitage, a fund of hedge
funds that customizes investment portfolios for its clients, is
subject to regulatory approval, Nexar said in a statement today.
The combined companies will manage $3.7 billion, according to a
Nexar spokeswoman.  Nexar was founded in 2009 by Arie Assayag, the former
global head of hedge funds at Societe Generale SA’s alternative
asset-management unit, with colleagues Eric Attias and Bernard Kalfon. So-called funds of funds, which charge clients money to
pick hedge-fund investments, have been considering merging with
rivals after the industry suffered redemptions in the aftermath
of the 2008 global financial crisis.  Nexar managed $3 billion after buying Allianz Alternative
Asset Management from German insurer Allianz SE in September.  London-based Caledonia is a trust started more than 80
years to oversee the wealth of the Cayzer family’s shipping
business. Caledonia rose 0.2 percent to 1,790 pence at 4:05 p.m.
in  London . The shares have risen 8 percent over the past year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
