Sesa Goa Ltd. (SESA) , the Indian iron-ore
exporter seeking shares in  Cairn India Ltd. (CAIR) , said holders of the
 oil company  tendered an 8.1 percent stake as an open offer
closed.  Cairn India’s minority investors tendered 155 million
shares for a total of $1.24 billion, Sesa Goa said today in a
statement. The open offer for as much as 20 percent, part of a
plan by parent  Vedanta Resources Plc (VED)  to gain access to India’s
biggest onshore oilfield, began April 11 and ended April 30.  Sesa Goa, based in Panaji, will make “necessary payments
of consideration for accepted tenders” by May 15, according to
the statement. It already bought a 10.4 percent stake in the oil
explorer, a unit of  Cairn Energy Plc (CNE) , from Petroliam Nasional
Bhd. on April 19. The open offer advances Vedanta’s bid for a
majority stake in Cairn India, announced last year.  Vedanta, a copper and aluminum miner with no experience in
producing oil or gas, has waited more than eight months to take
control of Cairn India as the government reviews the proposal.
Last month, the London-based company was forced to extend its
deadline to complete the deal to May 20 from April 15 after
India’s cabinet asked a panel of ministers to study the plan.  Sesa Goa offered 355 rupees a share to the minority
stockholders, after paying Malaysia’s Petroliam Nasional, or
Petronas, 331 rupees a share. Vedanta is offering Cairn Energy
405 rupees a share, including a non-compete fee of 50 rupees.  Cairn India shares fell 0.6 percent to 352.7 rupees in
Mumbai today. Sesa Goa declined 2.7 percent to 305.85 rupees.
Vedanta dropped 1 percent to 2,303 pence at the close in  London .  Vedanta said Aug. 16 it was seeking to buy 51 percent to 60
percent of Cairn India for as much as $9.6 billion. The price of
crude oil has gained 50 percent since then, boosting the target
company’s appeal. Cairn India produces about 125,000 barrels a
day from the Mangala field in the Rajasthan block.  The purchase of shares from Petronas may result in Vedanta
holding as much as 70.4 percent of Cairn India, the U.K. company
said April 19.  To contact the reporter on this story:
