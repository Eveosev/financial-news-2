Ford Motor Co. (F) ’s April U.S. light-

for an increase of 14 percent.  The figure account for Ford’s ownership of the Volvo car

excludes Volvo from its auto sales news release. Ford has also
discontinued its Mercury brand. Year-ago Mercury results are
included in Ford’s statement.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
