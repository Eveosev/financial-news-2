Colombia ’s peso rose the most in a
week on speculation measures announced last week won’t be enough
to stem the currency’s rally amid increasing foreign direct
investment.  The peso erased earlier declines, advancing 0.6 percent to
1,762.05 per  U.S. dollar  at 11:53 a.m. New York time, from 1,772
yesterday. That’s the biggest jump since April 27. The peso has
climbed 4.9 percent in the past month, the best performance
among six Latin American currencies tracked by Bloomberg.  “The measures aren’t enough,” said Omar Escorcia, an
analyst at brokerage Asesores en Valores SA in Bogota. “The
market was expecting more aggressive measures such as higher
dollar purchases by the central bank.”  Finance Minister Juan Carlos Echeverry said April 29 that
the government will create an overseas fund with as much as $1.2
billion from dollars bought in the local  spot market  through the
end of 2011, which will be used to pay foreign debt maturing in
January. The government’s dollar purchases add to the central
bank’s plans to buy a minimum of $20 million daily until “at
least” June 17. Colombia also will forgo repatriating funds
from abroad for the rest of the year, Echeverry said.  The sale of dollars in the local market by a company today
pushed the peso to 1,760.82, according to Juan Nicolas Garcia, a
currency trader at HSBC Holdings Plc’s Colombia unit.  “Once the peso broke the 1,770 level, it triggered stop
loss levels and people got scared and started selling” dollars,
said Garcia. “I don’t see the measures helping stem gains in
the peso. It’s a question of time before it gains to 1,750.”  The yield on the nation’s 10 percent bonds due July 2024
fell 2 basis points, or 0.02 percentage point, to 8.30 percent,
according to Colombia’s stock exchange. The bond’s price rose
0.158 centavo to 113.255 centavos per peso.  To contact the reporter on this story:
