Swiss stocks fell for the first time
in four days as  Swiss Life Holding AG (SLHN)  tumbled on earnings and
oil-rig operators  Transocean Ltd. (RIG)  and  Weatherford International
Ltd. (WFT)  declined.  The  Swiss Market Index (SMI)  of the biggest and most actively
traded companies lost 0.5 percent to 6,510.61 at the 5:30 p.m.
close in Zurich. The broader Swiss Performance Index slipped 0.3
percent.  “Nearing the end of this earnings season, we’re in
something of a no-man’s land with traders not reacting to much
of the macro news,” said John Plassard, director of Louis
Capital Markets in Geneva. “Investors will focus moreover on
Friday’s U.S. payrolls data.”  Swiss Life fell 4.9 percent to 150 Swiss francs, its
biggest daily decline since October 2009, as the nation’s
biggest life insurer said first-quarter premiums dropped 13
percent after it sold fewer insurance wrappers.  Gross written premiums slipped to 6.81 billion francs
($7.87 billion) from 7.85 billion francs a year earlier, the
Zurich-based company said today in a statement. That missed the
7.08 billion-franc median estimate of five analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg.  Baloise Holding AG (BALN) ,  Switzerland ’s third-largest insurer,
dropped 1.5 percent to 92.15 francs, as the company traded for
the first time without the right to the latest dividend.  Geneva-based Transocean declined 4.5 percent to 60 francs.
Weatherford slumped 4.7 percent to 17.7 francs.  Cie. Financiere Richemont SA, the owner of the Cartier
brand, dropped 1.6 percent to 55.15 francs.  Geberit AG (GEBN) , the Swiss maker of bathroom fittings, climbed
1.3 percent to 206.2 francs after reporting a first-quarter
profit of 121.4 million francs, beating analyst expectations.  To contact the reporters on this story:
