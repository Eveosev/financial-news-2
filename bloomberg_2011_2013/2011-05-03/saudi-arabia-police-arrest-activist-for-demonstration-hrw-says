Saudi Arabia , the world’s largest oil
exporter, arrested a Shiite human rights activist in the oil-
producing Eastern Province, extending a crackdown aimed at
quashing political unrest,  Human Rights Watch  said.  Fadhil al-Manasif was detained on May 1 for taking part in
peaceful demonstrations in Awwamiya, the New York-based rights
group said in a  statement  on its website today. Al-Manasif, 27,
has documented human rights violations for the past two years,
the group said. Saudi Arabia has arrested more than 160
dissidents since February,  Human Rights Watch  said April 20.  Saudi Arabia, holder of 20 percent of the world’s oil
reserves, has countered domestic political unrest, inspired by
the toppling of leaders in Tunisia and  Egypt , with arrests and
sweeping increases in  government spending , including $67 billion
on housing and funds for the military and religious groups.  The government has barred protests, marches and sit-ins,
and issued new media regulations that enable the government to
close or fine publications that hurt the kingdom’s stability or
insult Islam. Shiite Muslims in the eastern province villages of
Awwamiya and Qatif have defied authorities by holding
demonstrations this year.  “The latest arrests of peaceful dissidents brings the
climate for reform in Saudi Arabia to the freezing point,” said
 Christoph Wilcke , senior Middle East researcher at Human Rights
Watch. “The Saudi ruling family has shown no signs that it
might ease its iron grip on the right to express political
opinions.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
