Deepali Bhargava, an economist at the
Indian unit of ING Groep NV in Mumbai, comments on  India ’s
interest rates.  The  Reserve Bank  of India today raised the repurchase rate
by half a percentage point to 7.25 percent. Only seven of 25
economists in a Bloomberg News survey had predicted the move,
while the remaining expected a quarter-point increase.  “The central bank has acknowledged that inflation is going
to be high for a persistent period and this is the reason why
they have taken a big step.  ‘‘RBI is still trying to assess the impact on economic
growth. The move from here on will be calibrated, unless all the
data is completely off from the bank’s target.  ‘‘With any kind of rate tightening growth is bound to be
affected. It will moderate to some extent to a number somewhere
below 8 percent.’’  To contact the reporter on this story:
