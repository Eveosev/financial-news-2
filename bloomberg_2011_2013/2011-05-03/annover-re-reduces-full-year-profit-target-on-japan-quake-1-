Hannover Re , the world’s third-biggest
reinsurer, cut its full-year earnings forecast after quarterly
profit fell 65 percent on claims from the earthquake in  Japan .  Net income in the three months ended March 31 dropped to
52.3 million euros ($77.5 million) from 151 million euros in the
year-earlier period, the Hannover, Germany-based company said in
a statement today. That beat the 30.7 million-euro average
estimate of nine analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  The reinsurer reduced its 2011 profit target to about 500
million euros from 650 million euros previously. Hannover Re had
reiterated the forecast on March 9, two days before Japan was
struck by its worst earthquake on record. The disaster may cost
insurers and reinsurers $21 billion to $34 billion, according to
catastrophe modeler Risk Management Solutions.  “The current financial year has been dominated so far by
severe natural catastrophe events,” Hannover Re Chief Executive
Officer  Ulrich Wallin  said in today’s statement.  The company said its burden from major catastrophes since
January was 572 million euros, compared with 264 million euros
in the year-earlier period and an earmarked 530 million euros
for major claims over the course of 2011.  The first quarter has been insurers’ most costly start to a
year. Total insured losses from disasters including the Japan
quake and tsunami, floods and a cyclone in Australia and an
earthquake in  New Zealand , are expected to top $52.6 billion in
the period, compared with $40.6 billion for the whole of 2010,
 according  to Aon Benfield, the reinsurance broker of Chicago-
based Aon Corp.  Tax Gain  Hannover Re’s result was cushioned by a refund of excess
taxes of 113.5 million euros from a court ruling on provisions.
That follows a gain of 112.2 million euros from a tax ruling
that boosted earnings to a record 749 million euros last year.  Munich Re, the world’s biggest reinsurer, said on April 20
it will report a “clearly negative” first-quarter result. The
Munich-based company in March scrapped its 2.4 billion-euro
profit target for this year as it estimated about 1.5 billion
euros in claims from Japan.  Munich Re  plans to report detailed
first-quarter figures on May 9.  Hannover Re shares have risen 2.3 percent in Frankfurt
trading this year, giving the company a market value of about 5
billion euros. The gain compares with an 2.3 percent decline of
Munich Re.  To contact the reporter on this story:
