Lebanon will reissue a tender to buy
50,000 metric tons of wheat tomorrow because the original bidder
didnâ€™t comply with contract terms, the Ministry of Trade and
Industry said, without elaborating.  The tender was initially issued on April 19, the ministry
said today in an e-mailed statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
