Acerinox SA (ACX) , the world’s largest
stainless-steel producer, reported a more than six-fold increase
in first-quarter profit and forecast results will be sustained
during the following three months.  Net income rose to 67.8 million euros ($100 million) from
10.1 million euros a year earlier, the company said in a
statement in Madrid today. Net sales gained 41 percent to 1.41
billion euros as steel production increased 6.7 percent.  “Demand levels allow us to be optimistic about the second
quarter, when we expect results close to those of the first,”
Acerinox said. Signs of recovery are “limited by political and
economic global uncertainties that reduce visibility,” it said.  Acerinox advanced 0.6 percent to 13.715 euros by 9:49 a.m.
in  Madrid , while the Ibex-35 index fell 0.5 percent to 10,737.  To contact the reporter on this story:
