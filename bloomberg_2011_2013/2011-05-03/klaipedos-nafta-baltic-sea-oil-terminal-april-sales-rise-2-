AB Klaipedos Nafta, which operates
 Lithuania â€™s oil terminal on the  Baltic Sea , said sales rose 2
percent in April compared with the same period a year earlier.  Sales increased to 12.9 million litai ($5.54 million), the
Klaipeda-based company said today in a statement to the stock
exchange. Oil-product shipments fell an annual 16 percent as the
only oil refiner in the Baltic states, Orlen Lietuva AB, closed
for routine maintenance in April, Klaipedos Nafta said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
