Kamal Baheti, director of finance at
 McLeod Russel India Ltd. (MCLR) , the world’s biggest tea grower,
comments after the  Reserve Bank  of India today raised borrowing
costs by 50 basis points, a decision predicted by seven of 25
economists surveyed by Bloomberg. The rest expected a quarter-
point increase.  The central bank has raised benchmark rates nine times
starting March, 2010. Baheti spoke in a telephone interview from
Kolkata.  “Interest rates overseas have been more stable than in
India. So companies may look at borrowing overseas. The forward
cover exchange cost was hovering around 4-5 percent, which may
go up.  ‘‘Tightening liquidity in the short term may hurt the pace
of economic growth, but in the long term if inflation is down,
then growth momentum will pick up.  ‘‘Higher  interest rates  may slow expansion plans of Indian
companies. Companies may see their sales slowing, especially
sectors like white goods, manufacturing and real estate
companies.’’  To contact the reporter on this story:
