MetroPCS Communications Inc. (PCS) , the pay-
as-you-go U.S. wireless provider, jumped the most in more than
two years after reporting first-quarter subscriber additions
that beat some analysts’ estimates.  MetroPCS rose $1.67, or 10 percent, to $18.15 at 4 p.m. in
New York Stock Exchange composite trading, the biggest single-
day gain since November 2008. The shares had added 30 percent
this year before today.  Dallas-based MetroPCS said in a statement it added 725,945
users in the first quarter. That compares with estimates of
475,000 from Jason Armstrong, an analyst with Goldman Sachs
Group Inc., and 350,000 by  Todd Rethemeier , an analyst with
Hudson Square Research.  “The availability of low-priced Android smartphones on a
no-contract plan remains a key driver of strength,” said
Armstrong, referring to the  Google Inc. (GOOG)  handset software. He has
a “neutral” rating on MetroPCS shares.  The carrier reported net income more than doubled to $59.8
million from $23.3 million a year earlier, as it boosted revenue
by 23 percent to $1.05 billion.  MetroPCS  also lowered the rate
at which customers leave, known as churn, to 3.1 percent from
3.7 percent last year.  MetroPCS, which is introducing a fourth-generation network,
offers monthly plans starting at $40 offering unlimited calling
and texting. The prices include taxes and fees.  To contact the reporter on this story:
