The  Melbourne  Rebels said backs Danny
Cipriani and Richard Kingi were stood down from this week’s
Super Rugby match against the Queensland Reds for breaching team
protocol.  English fly-half Cipriani and New Zealand-born scrum-half
Kingi failed to uphold an agreement made by the squad following
the April 30 loss to the New South Wales Waratahs in Sydney,
Rebels Chief Executive Officer Ross Oakley said in a statement.  “Both players defied a team directive to abstain from
staying out late on Saturday night, given the six-day break
ahead of our next game,” Oakley said in the statement.   The Rebels added that the team’s Player Standards Group
agreed that both players should stand down for the May 6 game
against the Australian Conference-leading Reds in Melbourne.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
