Gopal Agrawal, the Mumbai-based chief
investment officer at the local unit of Mirae Asset Financial
Group, comments on the Indian central bank’s monetary policy and
the outlook for the nation’s stocks.  The  Reserve Bank  of  India  today raised  interest rates  by
half a percentage point, more than some economists predicted.
The Bombay Stock Exchange Sensitive Index, or Sensex, dropped as
much as 1.4 percent.  Agrawal spoke in a phone interview today. His firm, Mirae
Asset Global Investments (India) Pvt., managed 3.8 billion
rupees ($86 million) in assets at the end of March 31:  “The quantum of the rate hike really shows the RBI’s
concern on inflation and they’ve taken a bold step.”  On the outlook for stocks:  “The mood of the market will be decided more by the
corporate earnings and the global outlook.  ‘‘If the monsoon is good, it will definitely revive
sentiment and improve spending. People will wait and watch for
the monsoons.’’  On his investment strategy:  ‘‘We will change our weightings on certain sectors. The
final call will depend on the monsoons.  ‘‘We have reduced holdings in state-run banks. That is the
major change. We have also tweaked holdings in the auto sector
because we are seeing some signs of moderation. We have moved
more towards shares of auto-ancillary companies than those of
auto producers.’’  To contact the reporter on this story:
