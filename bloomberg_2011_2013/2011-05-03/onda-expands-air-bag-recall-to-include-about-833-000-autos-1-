Honda Motor Co.,  Japan ’s third-largest
automaker, said it will again expand a U.S. recall of Honda and
Acura brand models to fix flawed air-bag components.  The company will inspect model year 2001 to 2003 vehicles
that may have had the original driver’s air-bag module replaced
with a flawed service part, Honda said today in an e-mailed
statement. As a result, the recall now includes an additional
833,000 vehicles, the Tokyo-based company said.  Honda “determined that a number of affected service part
air bags were installed in these vehicles in the process of a
collision repair or other vehicle service,” according to the
statement. “Owners of all potentially affected vehicles are
being notified because Honda has not been able to determine
which specific vehicles received one of those parts.”  The faulty air-bag inflators are at risk of deploying too
forcefully and causing the inflator’s casing to rupture,
potentially leading to injuries or fatalities for vehicle
occupants, the company said. Customer notification is to begin
late this month.  Vehicles covered by the action include some 2001 and 2002
Accord and Civic cars; 2002 Odyssey minivans; 2002 and 2003 CR-V
sport-utility vehicles; and some 2002 and 2003 Acura 3.2 TL
sedans and 2003 Acura 3.2 CL coupes, the company said.  Honda last year recalled 437,763 Honda and Acura models to
inspect for faulty air-bag modules at risk of deploying too
forcefully. The company has said air-bag systems were supplied
by Japan’s  Takata Corp. (7312)   Honda’s U.S. unit is based in Torrance, California.  To contact the reporters on this story:
