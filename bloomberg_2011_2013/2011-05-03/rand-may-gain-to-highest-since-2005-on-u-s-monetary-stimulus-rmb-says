South Africa ’s rand may gain to the
strongest since 2005 to the dollar by the end of next year if
the U.S. Federal Reserve maintains its record stimulus to boost
the world’s biggest economy, according to Rand Merchant Bank.  “Muted demand coupled with sluggish employment gains might
well keep the Fed on hold well into 2012,” taking the rand to
5.80 per dollar, Rand Merchant Bank analysts Theuns de Wet and
Nema Ramkhelawan said in a research note. “If the Fed continues
to use monetary expansion, we could see the dollar trade well
below” 6 rand by the end of 2012, they wrote. The rand last
traded below 5.80 per dollar in March 2005.  The South African currency appreciated to a 3 1/2-year high
of 6.5437 per dollar yesterday after the Fed last week held
 interest rates  near zero and Chairman Ben S. Bernanke said the
central bank will continue reinvesting its securities holdings
when they mature even after its $600 billion bond-buying program
ends in June.  The U.S.’s benchmark rate of 0.25 percent compares with 5.5
percent in South Africa, making the rand attractive in carry
trades, where investors borrow in the currency of a nation with
low interest rates to use the proceeds for purchasing assets
where returns are higher.  Rand Merchant Bank, a unit of South Africa’s second-biggest
lender, estimates a current “fair value” for the rand of 6.55
per dollar, Johannesburg-based De Wet and Ramkhelawan wrote. The
currency traded at 6.636 per dollar at 3:35 p.m. in
Johannesburg.  If the Fed maintains its monetary easing and increases
 money supply  at 8 percent annually, higher than the historical
average of 5.5 percent, commodity prices would rise, supporting
the currencies of commodity exporters including South Africa, De
Wet and Ramkhelawan wrote.  “Under these assumptions, our regression model suggests
the dollar will be at 5.80 rand by the end of 2012,” they
wrote. If the Fed restricts the money supply to 5.5 percent, the
rand will likely weaken to 7 per dollar, they estimated.  To contact the reporter on this story:
