Jay Shankar, Mumbai-based chief
economist at Religare Capital Markets Ltd., comments on the
central bank’s interest rate action and inflation.  The  Reserve Bank of India  increased the repurchase rate by
50 basis points to 7.25 percent in today. Only seven of 25
economists in a Bloomberg News survey had predicted the move,
while the rest expected a quarter-point increase. The central
bank boosted the reverse repurchase rate to 6.25 percent from
5.75 percent.  “We still have not seen the impact of fuel prices in the
headline inflation numbers and when that comes in your inflation
number can shoot up. We see inflation peaking in September or
October at 11.5 percent to 12 percent. Inflation will average 10
percent in the six months to Sept. 30 and that will require much
faster policy tightening.”  “I believe the RBI will increase  interest rates  by another
75 basis points in 2011. The policy rate will be peaking at
around 8 percent by December.”  A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  To contact the reporter on this story:
