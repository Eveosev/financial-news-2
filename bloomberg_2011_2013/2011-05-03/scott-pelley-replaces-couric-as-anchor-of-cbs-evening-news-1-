Scott Pelley will replace Katie Couric
next month as anchor and managing editor of CBS Evening News,
network executives said.  “CBS Evening News With Scott Pelley” will begin June 6,
 CBS News  Chairman Jeff Fager and President David Rhodes said
today in an e-mail. Couric’s contract expires June 4.  Pelley, who has been at CBS for more than 21 years, has
served as chief White House correspondent and became a regular
contributor for “60 Minutes” in 2004. Pelley will continue to
report for “60 Minutes,” where Fager is executive producer.  “Scott is the ideal journalist to lead this broadcast,”
Rhodes said. “He has a body of work few in the business can
claim and will help us grow CBS News now and in the future.”  Ratings at “CBS Evening News” declined during Couric’s
tenure, falling to an all-time low in total viewers with an
average of 4.89 million during the week of Aug. 24, 2010,
according to  TVNewser .  Comcast Corp. (CMCSA) ’s NBC and  Walt Disney Co. (DIS) ’s ABC are
discussing talk shows with Couric that would start in 2012, an
executive with knowledge of the talks told Bloomberg last week.  To contact the reporter on this story:
