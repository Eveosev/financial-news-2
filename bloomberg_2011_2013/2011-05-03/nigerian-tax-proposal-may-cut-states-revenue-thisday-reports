The Nigerian government’s proposal to
cut income-tax rates would reduce revenue for state governments
by as much as 50 percent, ThisDay cited the Lagos state adviser
in charge of revenue and taxation, Adeola Ipaye, as saying.  The reduction plan, now before the National Assembly, would
be “disastrous” for states because there are no proposals to
raise revenue from other sources, the Lagos-based newspaper
cited Ipaye as saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
