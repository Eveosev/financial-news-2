Petroleo Brasileiro SA (PETR4) , the Brazilian
state-run oil producer, said it’s still “too early” to raise
domestic gasoline prices even as the company faces having to
import the fuel and resell it below cost to meet demand.  “We don’t pass through to the Brazilian market short-term
variations of the international price of oil,” Chief Executive
Officer Jose Sergio Gabrielli said in an interview. “Our policy
is a long-term policy, and it’s too early to decide what to do.”  Petrobras’s refineries are operating near capacity amid
surging economic growth, forcing the company to buy fuel abroad
even as government price caps prevent it from passing on the
full cost to consumers. Petrobras’s profit gains haven’t kept
pace with rivals such as  Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM)  after the company cut
 gas prices  by 4.5 percent in June 2009 and hasn’t raised them
since. Crude futures have surged 66 percent in the meantime.  The Rio de Janeiro-based company won’t add any significant
capacity to its domestic refining network until it completes a
new plant in 2013, Gabrielli said yesterday from Houston. The
company’s refineries supply most of the nation’s gasoline needs,
with imports accounting for a “small” portion, he said.  Petrobras imported 1.5 million barrels of gasoline in April
as economic growth boosted fuel demand and will likely also need
to import this month, according to Gabrielli. The executive said
April 12 in Beijing that prices must go up if crude stays high.  Agencia Estado newswire reported last week that the company
plans to buy an additional 1 million barrels of the fuel in May.  Stock Drop  The company fell 0.7 percent to 25.56 reais as of 12:11
p.m. in Sao Paulo trading. The stock has lost about 19 percent
in the past year, compared with a 3.2 percent decline for
Brazil’s benchmark Bovespa index.  Low  interest rates  in developed economies have allowed
speculators to drive up oil futures, making it difficult to
predict when crude prices may retreat, Gabrielli said. Global
oil demand and supply are balanced, he said.  Crude oil for June delivery fell 90 cents, or 0.8 percent,
to $112.62 a barrel at 9:30 a.m. on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange . Futures are up 31 percent from a year ago.  There is “a very clear capital in-flight to the
commodities market,” Gabrielli said. “This makes for very big
volatility.”  Inflation in Check  Brazil’s government, which owns a majority of Petrobras’s
voting shares, wants to hold gasoline prices steady to keep
inflation in check. A report to be released May 6 will show that
inflation in the 12 months through April increased to 6.59
percent, according to the median estimate of 27 economists
surveyed by Bloomberg. The government forecasts the economy will
expand 4.5 percent after growing 7.5 percent in 2010, the
fastest pace in two decades.  Brazil  may cut its fuel tax if Petrobras raises gasoline
prices, Finance Minister  Guido Mantega  told senators today. The
fuel tax cut would be “a measure for the future,” he said.  Petrobras is digging deeper in Brazil’s offshore Campos
Basin to find deposits beneath existing fields and trapped under
a layer of salt, Gabrielli said. The company has discovered
about 2 billion barrels of recoverable oil in the basin since
2009, which is easier to exploit than deep-water fields in the
nearby  Santos Basin .  “The beauty of those types of discoveries is we can
connect them to production platforms already in place,”
Gabrielli said. Petrobras has pipelines and platforms at Campos,
where it has produced for more than 30 years.  Salt Layer  A layer of salt under the seabed made it difficult for
geologists to explore the area more thoroughly until technology
such as three-dimensional seismic imaging improved. Two of
Brazil’s most-productive wells produce from so-called pre-salt
deposits in Campos, according to the country’s oil regulator.  Petrobras first found oil at Campos in 1974 and started
commercial output in 1977, according to its website. Campos
produced 1.9 million barrels a day in February, or 79 percent of
Brazil’s oil and natural gas, according to the regulator.  Petrobras is on track to increase domestic oil output 5
percent this year to an average of 2.1 million barrels a day as
the company ramps up offshore platforms, Gabrielli said.  International oil rig and platform suppliers will keep
“complaining” as Petrobras expands its own fleet and reduces
their control over the global rig market, Gabrielli said. The
company aims to operate 55 deep-water rigs by 2020, 28 of which
will be built in Brazilian shipyards, he said.  Drillers Not Happy  “The drillers are not very happy because we are increasing
the capacity of drilling rigs worldwide,” Gabrielli said. “We
can build rigs at competitive prices, international prices.”  The oil producer doesn’t plan to hold any more
international rig tenders and will contract 21 more Brazilian
rigs this year, he said. Drilling companies including Diamond
Offshore Drilling Inc., Noble Drilling Corp. and Seadrill Ltd.
rent it units.  Petrobras expects to beat its previous production targets
at Santos, reaching 613,000 barrels a day in 2015 and 1 million
barrels a day in 2017, according to a statement yesterday. About
60 percent of the output belongs to Petrobras, with the rest
controlled by partners such as BG Group Plc and Galp Energia
SGPS SA.  To contact the reporters on this story:
