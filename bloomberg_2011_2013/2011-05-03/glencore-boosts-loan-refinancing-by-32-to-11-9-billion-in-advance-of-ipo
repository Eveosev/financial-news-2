Glencore International AG, the Swiss
commodities trader planning to list shares in the biggest
initial public offering this year, said it increased a loan
refinancing to $11.88 billion on “strong demand.”  The world’s largest commodities trader signed $3.5 billion
of new financing and extended the maturity on $8.3 billion of
existing credit lines by one year to May 2014, according to a
statement today. Glencore plans to announce a price range for
its IPO tomorrow as management of the closely-held company
begins meeting potential investors, a person with knowledge of
the deal said.  The Baar, Switzerland-based company initially sought $9
billion when it appointed loan arrangers to syndicate the deal
March 29. Seventy-seven lenders joined coordinators BNP Paribas
SA, Credit Agricole CIB, Singapore’s DBS Group Holdings Ltd. and
Rabobank International, according to the statement.  Glencore agreed to pay interest of 110 basis points more
than the  London  interbank offered rate for new credit lines that
expire in 364 days, with the interest margin rising to 160 basis
points if the company decides to convert the revolving credit
into a  term loan , according to data compiled by Bloomberg. A
basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  Glencore, which changed its name from Marc Rich & Co. after
management bought out former fugitive U.S. financier Marc Rich
in 1994, plans to raise as much as $11 billion selling shares in
London and  Hong Kong  to help fund expansion and acquisitions.  Moody’s Investors Service rates Glencore’s debt Baa2 and
 Standard & Poor’s  ranks it BBB-.  To contact the reporter on this story:
