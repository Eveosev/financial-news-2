Alexander Djaparidze, the billionaire
chief executive officer of Eurasia Drilling Co., transferred
33.2 million shares, or about 23 percent of the oilfield
services provider, to Hadar Fund Ltd.  The transfer reduces his direct holding in  Russia â€™s largest
independent drilling company to about 14.5 percent, Eurasia
Drilling said in a statement published today on its website.
Eurasia shares fell 2.1 percent to $33 at 12:35 p.m. in London.
The transferred stake had a value of $1.1 billion based on the
previous closing price.  The Hadar Fund indicated it would be a long-term holder of
Eurasia shares as a strategic investor, Kim Kruschwitz, a
Eurasia Drilling vice president, said by telephone today. The
fund may increase its holding, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
