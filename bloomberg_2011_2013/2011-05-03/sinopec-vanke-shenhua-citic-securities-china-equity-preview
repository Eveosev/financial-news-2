The following companies had unusual
price changes in  China  trading. Stock symbols are in parentheses
and share prices are as of the 3 p.m. close.  The Shanghai Composite Index, which tracks the bigger of
China’s stock exchanges, rose 0.7 percent to 2,932.19. The  CSI
300 Index (SHSZ300)  gained 0.6 percent to 3,211.13.  Gold producers: Zijin Mining Group Co. (601899 CH), China’s
largest gold miner by market value, dropped 2.1 percent to 7.56
yuan, the lowest close since Feb. 17. Zhongjin Gold Co. (600489
CH) plunged 3.3 percent to 36.15 yuan.  Gold dropped for a second day as Osama bin Laden’s death
boosted the dollar, reducing the appeal of precious metals as
alternative investments. Immediate-delivery gold fell as much as
1.3 percent to $1,525.45 an ounce and traded at $1,540.05 at
10:23 a.m. in  Singapore  after reaching a record $1,577.57
yesterday.  Train makers: China CNR Corp. (601299 CH) fell 1.7 percent
to 6.88 yuan, the lowest close since Dec. 28. CSR Corp. (601766
CH) dropped 0.7 percent to 6.88 yuan, the lowest close since
Dec. 2.  The government plans to reduce investments in high-speed
railways by more than 200 billion yuan this year, the Economic
Observer said on April 30. High-speed rail investments will be
reduced to more than 400 billion yuan from a previously planned
700 billion yuan, the newspaper said, citing an unidentified
person familiar with the situation.  Bright Dairy & Food Co. (600597 CH), the country’s second-
largest listed dairy-product maker, climbed 1.3 percent to 9.61
yuan. The company’s first-quarter net income rose 5.3 percent
from the same period last year to 26.8 million yuan, according
to a statement to the  Shanghai Stock Exchange  on April 29.  China Shenhua Energy Co. (601088 CH), a unit of the
country’s biggest coal producer, rose 0.5 percent to 29.81 yuan.
The company posted a 17 percent increase in first-quarter
profit. Its share gains have lagged those of rival Yanzhou Coal
Mining Co. and thermal coal prices may “start to fly” from the
second quarter because of high demand before the summer, UOB-Kay
Hian said in a report.  --Irene Shen, Eva Woo, Huang Zhe. Editor: Allen Wan  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
