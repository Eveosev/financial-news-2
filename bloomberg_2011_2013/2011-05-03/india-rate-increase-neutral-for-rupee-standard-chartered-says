Priyanka Kishore, a Mumbai-based
foreign-exchange strategist at Standard Chartered Plc, comments
on the outlook for  India ’s rupee after the central bank raised
 interest rates  today for the ninth time since March 2010. The
 Reserve Bank  of India lifted the repurchase rate to 7.25 percent
from 6.75 percent, according to a statement in Mumbai today.
Only seven of 25 economists in a Bloomberg News survey predicted
the move, while the rest expected a quarter-point increase.  “To some extent, the bigger-than-expected rate increase is
likely to moderate investor perception of the RBI being ‘behind
the curve’ in tackling inflation. However, a 50-basis-point
addition in borrowing costs could hurt economic growth at a time
when there are already signs of a moderation in industrial
activity. Hence, the overall impact of the central bank’s policy
measures on the rupee is rather neutral.  ‘‘Short-term technical indicators suggest the rupee will
trade in a relatively small range around current levels in the
near future. We think 44.20 and 44.60 are key technical levels
to watch out for.’’  To contact the reporter on this story:
