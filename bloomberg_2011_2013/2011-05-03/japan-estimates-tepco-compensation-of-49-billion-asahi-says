Victim compensation from Tokyo
Electric Power Co.’s nuclear accident may amount to 4 trillion
yen ($49 billion), the Asahi newspaper reported, citing
government estimates.  The total assumes that the utility raises electricity
prices to help pay for the compensation, the report said,
without citing where it obtained the information. Tepco will
need to borrow additional money from a fund established by other
utilities, the report said. Public funds will also be injected
into the fund, the newspaper said.  Tepco will need to increase prices by about 16 percent to
help raise enough money, the newspaper said, citing a person it
didn’t identify by name.  Telephone calls to the Cabinet Office, the government
agency responsible for economic forecasting that released quake-
damage estimates after the March 11 temblor, were unanswered due
to a national holiday.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
