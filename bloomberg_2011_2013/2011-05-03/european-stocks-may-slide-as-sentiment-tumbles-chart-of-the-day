European business sentiment’s April
slump heralds a potential selloff in the region’s equities,
according to Christopher Street Capital.  The CHART OF THE DAY plots the benchmark Stoxx Europe 600
Index and the European Commission’s Euro Area Business Climate
Indicator. European stocks tumbled following previous peaks in
the sentiment gauge in May 2000 and April 2007.  The business climate index plunged 10 percent to 1.28 in
April, the biggest percentage drop since February 2009, figures
released last week showed. The gauge peaked at 1.45 in February.  “It is only one month worth of data, but it’s the first
time we’ve seen such a big drop,” said Conor Howell, head of
ETF trading at Christopher Street in  London . “Is the market
going to drop tomorrow? I don’t know. This is certainly not a
short-term indicator. You will want to see a couple of months of
data to build a solid case.”  The Stoxx 600 rallied 2.9 percent in April, its biggest
monthly increase so far this year, as companies reported
earnings that topped analyst estimates and the  Federal Reserve 
maintained its pledge to keep  interest rates  low for an
“extended period.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
