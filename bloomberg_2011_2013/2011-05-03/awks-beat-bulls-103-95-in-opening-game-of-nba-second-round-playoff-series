The  Atlanta Hawks  ended a 15-game
losing run in the second round of the National Basketball
Association playoffs with a 103-95 win at the top-seeded  Chicago
Bulls .  Joe Johnson scored 34 points and Jamal Crawford came off
the bench to add 22 points for the Hawks at the United Center in
Chicago. The teams return to the same venue on May 4 for Game 2
in the best-of-seven Eastern Conference series.  Derrick Rose , who will be named the NBA Most Valuable
Player tomorrow according to the  Chicago Tribune , hobbled off
the court with an ankle problem after catching the back of
Crawfordâ€™s heel on the last play of the game. Rose scored 24
points to lead the Bulls.  The Hawks lost their past three second-round series 4-0,
against the  Orlando Magic  last year, the Cleveland Cavaliers the
year before and the New York Knicks in 1999. Their last victory
at this stage of the postseason came on May 8, 1997, when they
beat the Bulls by the same 103-95 score line before losing the
series 4-1.  Also tonight, the defending champion Los Angeles Lakers get
their second-round series under way against the Dallas
Mavericks.  To contact the reporter on this story:
