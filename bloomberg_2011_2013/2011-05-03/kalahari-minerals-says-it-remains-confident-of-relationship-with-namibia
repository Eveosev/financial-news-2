Kalahari Minerals Plc (KAH) , which owns 43
percent of Namibia-focused  Extract Resources Ltd. (EXT) , said it
remains “confident” that its “strong relationship” with
Namibia’s government will “continue to bear fruit.”  Namibia, the world’s fourth-largest uranium producer, is
considering legislative changes to ensure its citizens receive
more benefit from the country’s mineral wealth, Finance Minister
Saara Kuugongelwa-Amadhila said March 9. Extract manages the
nation’s Husab uranium project.  To contact the reporter on this story:
