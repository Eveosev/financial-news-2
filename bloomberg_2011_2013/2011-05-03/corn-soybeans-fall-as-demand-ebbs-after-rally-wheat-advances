Corn and soybeans fell for the second
straight day on bets that demand for supplies from the U.S., the
world’s leading exporter, will ebb following price rallies to
the highest since mid-2008. Wheat gained.  Archer Daniels  Midland Co., the largest grain processor,
delivered 1.96 million bushels of corn against expiring May
futures, exchange data show.  Brazil , the second-biggest soybean
shipper, may harvest 72.6 million metric tons this year,
Celeres, a crop forecaster, said yesterday. That topped a
previous estimate of 70.6 million tons.  “ADM making delivery of corn was a shocker and is a sign
of slowing demand,” said  Don Roose , the president of U.S.
Commodities Inc. in  West Des Moines ,  Iowa . “Increasing supplies
in  South America  will slow demand for U.S. soybeans.”  Corn futures for July delivery fell 10.75 cents, or 1.5
percent, to close at $7.2375 a bushel at 1:15 p.m. on the
Chicago Board of Trade. Yesterday, the price dropped 2.9
percent. The most-active contract has risen 95 percent in the
past year, touching $7.8875 on April 11, the highest since June
2008.  Soybean futures for July delivery dropped 29.25 cents, or
2.1 percent, to close at $13.6375 a bushel. Yesterday, the price
declined 1 cent.  On Feb. 11, the commodity reached $14.5575, the highest
since July 2008. The oilseed used to make  animal feed  and
cooking oils has gained 38 percent in the past year.  Warm, Dry Weather  Prices also fell on speculation that warmer, drier weather
will accelerate U.S. planting that has been delayed by rain and
cold temperatures, Roose said. About 13 percent of the U.S. corn
crop was planted as of May 1, compared with 40 percent on
average the past five years, the  U.S. Department of Agriculture 
said yesterday.  Archer Daniels said today that fiscal third-quarter profit
rose 37 percent as food-ingredient demand climbed.  “Global demand for crops and agricultural products remains
strong,” ADM Chief Executive Officer Patricia Woertz said in a
statement.  Wheat futures for July delivery rose 1.5 cents, or 0.2
percent, to close at $7.9325 a bushel. The price has gained 58
percent in the past year as adverse weather reduced global
production.  Corn is the biggest U.S. crop, valued at $66.7 billion in
2010, followed by soybeans at $38.9 billion, government figures
show. Wheat is the fourth-largest, behind hay, at $13 billion.  To contact the reporter on this story:
