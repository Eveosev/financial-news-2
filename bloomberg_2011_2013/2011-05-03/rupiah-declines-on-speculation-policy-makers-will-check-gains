Indonesia’s rupiah declined, snapping
a four-day rally, on speculation the central bank will check
appreciation after inflation slowed last month. Bonds were
unchanged.  The currency retreated from a seven-year high after
consumer prices in  Southeast Asia ’s largest economy rose 6.16
percent from a year earlier after increasing 6.65 percent in
March, the  Central Bureau of Statistics  said yesterday. The
reading was less than the 6.4 percent median estimate of
economists in a Bloomberg survey.  “What  Bank Indonesia  wants to see is a stable rupiah,”
said Mika Martumpal, a currency analyst at PT Bank Commonwealth
in Jakarta. “Inflation has slowed, so the central bank seems
comfortable with the current level of the currency as long as it
doesn’t fluctuate too much.”  The rupiah dropped 0.1 percent to 8,551 per dollar as of
3:10 p.m. in Jakarta, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
The currency touched 8,540 earlier, the strongest level since
March 2004.  Policy makers next meet on May 12 to review the benchmark
lending rate. The central bank last raised the rate by 0.25
percentage point to 6.75 percent in February, the first increase
in more than two years.  The yield on  Indonesia  government’s benchmark 8.25 percent
bond due July 2021 was unchanged at 7.70 percent today,
according to midday prices from the Inter-Dealer Market
Association.  To contact the reporter on this story:
