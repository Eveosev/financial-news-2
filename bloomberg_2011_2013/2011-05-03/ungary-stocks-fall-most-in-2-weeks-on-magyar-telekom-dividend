Hungarian shares fell the most in more
than two weeks as OTP Bank Nyrt., the country’s largest lender,
dropped. The forint and government bonds weakened.  The benchmark BUX index of shares slid 2 percent to
23,794.72 by the 5 p.m. close in Budapest, the biggest slump
since April 18. OTP, which accounts for about 31 percent of the
BUX, fell 2.2 percent to 6,211 forint.  The MSCI Emerging Markets Index of stocks retreated the
most in two weeks, as investors pared holdings of riskier assets
after  India ’s central bank raised rates more than expected and
while assessing the likely impact of the May 1 killing by U.S.
forces of al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden in  Pakistan .  “The news of Osama bin Laden’s killing only kindled
markets for a moment,” analysts at Bayerische Landesbank’s MKB
Bank Zrt. unit, led by Zsolt Kondrat in Budapest, wrote in a
research report today. “Given the numerous risks around global
economic growth and financial markets, it is increasingly
difficult to believe in the market rally continuing without
disruption.”  Magyar Telekom Nyrt., which accounts for 11 percent of the
BUX, declined 49 forint to 555 forint, as the deadline passed
yesterday for investors to buy shares qualifying for a 50 forint
dividend on last year’s earnings. Adjusting for the dividend,
the stock rose 1 forint, or 0.2 percent.  The forint depreciated 0.6 percent to 265.95 per euro.
 Government bonds  maturing in 2020 slumped, lifting the yield 3
basis points to 7.08 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
