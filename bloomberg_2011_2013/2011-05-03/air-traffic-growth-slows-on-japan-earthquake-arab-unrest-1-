Growth in  air travel  slowed in March
as the Japanese earthquake and political turmoil in the Middle
East and North Africa curbed demand, the  International Air
Transport Association  said today.  International  passenger traffic  rose 3.8 percent in the
month versus a year earlier, compared with a 5.8 percent gain in
February, with the March 11 quake and Mideast unrest each
responsible for about half of the slippage, the trade body said.  Japanese domestic travel fell 22 percent, while Egypt and
 Tunisia  experienced traffic levels as much as 25 percent below
normal for March and military action in  Libya  stopped virtually
all flights to, from and within the country, IATA said. Demand
will remain depressed through the current quarter, it added.  “The profile of the recovery in air transport sharply
decelerated in March,” IATA Chief Executive Officer  Giovanni Bisignani  said in a statement. Economic growth may spur a
second-half rebound, though “the big uncertainty is the price of
oil,” which is hurting leisure travel in particular, he said.  The slowdown in traffic in March came as carriers expanded
capacity by 8.6 percent, IATA said, a combination that sent load
factors, a measure of seat occupancy, tumbling 3.5 percentage
points to 74.6 percent.  Still, cargo traffic increased 3.7 percent in the month,
accelerating from a 1.8 percent advance in February, when
shipments from parts of  Asia  were limited by plant closures
associated with the Chinese New Year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
