Direct Edge Holdings LLC, a U.S. group
of  stock exchanges , said it will extend its connections to so-
called “dark pools,” which don’t display prices and allow
anonymous trading of large blocks of shares away from public
order books, the Financial Times reported.  The connections will enable traders already linked to
Direct Edge to route trades to seven dark pools, including the
biggest, operated by Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Credit Suisse
Group AG, the newspaper said.  About 30 percent of trades in the U.S. are executed off-
exchange, 15 to 20 percent in dark pools, the FT said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
