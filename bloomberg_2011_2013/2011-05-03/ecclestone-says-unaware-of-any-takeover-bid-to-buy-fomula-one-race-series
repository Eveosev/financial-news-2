Formula One Chief Executive Officer
Bernie Ecclestone said he was unaware of any bid being made to
buy the car racing competition.  “I don’t know anything about it,” Ecclestone said today
in a telephone interview when asked about a possible bid by  News
Corp. (NWSA)  and  Exor SpA (EXO)  for Formula One. “As far as I know, it’s
certainly not for sale. CVC are not interested in selling.”  News Corp. and Turin-based Exor are working on a joint bid
for Formula One, Sky News reported today, without saying where
it got the information. Formula One is owned by CVC Capital
Partners Ltd., a London-based private equity company.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
