Opposition to the adoption of changes
to the U.K.’s electoral system has increased to give Prime
Minister  David Cameron ’s “No” campaign a lead of 66 percent to
34 percent, according to a ComRes poll for the Independent
distributed today.  The proportion of respondents saying they’ll vote against
the changes has risen since last week, when a ComRes survey
found that 60 percent of respondents would back the current
first-past-the post-system, while 40 percent planned to vote for
the introduction of the so-called Alternative Vote system, put
forward by the Liberal Democrat party led by Deputy Prime
Minister  Nick Clegg .  In the current system, voters mark their ballot for one
candidate, and the person with the most votes in each of the 650
electoral districts wins. Under the so-called Alternative Vote
system, people list candidates in order of preference. The
candidate receiving the least support in the first round of
counting is eliminated, and their votes are redistributed
according to people’s second choices. This process continues
until one candidate has more than half the votes.  The U.K. will vote in a plebiscite on electoral changes on
May 5.  The Comres survey, which polled a random sample of 1,033
adults across the U.K., found that 44 percent of respondents
were “certain to vote,” the statement said. 15 percent of
people in that group said they haven’t yet decided on how
they’ll vote, ComRes said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
