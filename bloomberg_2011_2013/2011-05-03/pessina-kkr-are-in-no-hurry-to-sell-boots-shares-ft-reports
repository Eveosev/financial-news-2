Alliance Boots Holdings Ltd. Executive
Chairman Stefano Pessina said neither he nor joint owners KKR &
Co. have a timetable for the possible sale of shares in the
drugstore chain they acquired in 2007, the Financial Times
reported, citing an interview with Pessina.  “It’s up to them, but I don’t believe they are in a
hurry,” Pessina said, according to the FT. Pessina himself is
“not a seller” and he’s “indifferent” because he’s a “long,
long-term investor,” the newspaper cited him as saying.  Alliance Boots, owner of about 2,500 stores in the U.K.,
may report trading profit of “well over” one billion pounds
($1.65 billion) in the year to March 2011, up from 1.07 billion
pounds a year earlier, the FT said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
