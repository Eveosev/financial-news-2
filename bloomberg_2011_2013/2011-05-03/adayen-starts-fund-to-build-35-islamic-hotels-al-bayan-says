Madayen Holding started a fund to
invest in building 35 Islamic hotels in the next three years,  Al
Bayan  reported, citing chairman Omer Al Thahiri.  The Abu Dhabi-based company will build 70 percent of those
hotels in  Saudi Arabia  and the rest in the United Arab Emirates.
Madayen plans to expand its two, three and four star hotels into
Turkey and  Malaysia , the newspaper said.  Islamic hotels include mosques and separate common areas
such as gymnasiums for men and women, with alcohol sales banned.  To contact the reporter on this story:
