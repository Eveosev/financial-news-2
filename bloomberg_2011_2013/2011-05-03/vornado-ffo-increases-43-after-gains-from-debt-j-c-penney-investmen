Vornado Realty Trust (VNO) , the third-
biggest U.S. real estate investment trust by market value, said
first-quarter funds from operations rose 43 percent after gains
from retiring debt and its J.C. Penney Co. investment.  FFO, which gauges a property company’s ability to generate
cash, increased to $505.9 million, or $2.64 a share, from $353.8
million, or $1.87, a year earlier, the New York-based company
said today in a statement posted on its website. Vornado was
projected to have FFO of $2.03 a share, the average estimate of
12 analysts in a Bloomberg survey.  The diversity of the company’s portfolio, which includes
stock holdings in retailers Toys “R” Us Inc. and J.C. Penney
in addition to office and retail properties, means Vornado often
has gains and losses each quarter that exceed the impact of
“the real stuff,” such as its rent revenue, Alex Goldfarb, an
analyst with Sandler O’Neill & Partners LP, said in an interview
before the report. He has a “sell” rating on the stock.  Vornado, which operates office buildings mainly in New York
and  Washington , and retail properties across the country,
reported an $83.9 million gain on extinguishment of debt tied to
the sale of its High Point,  North Carolina , furniture showrooms
in March, the company said in a regulatory filing today. The
buildings were part of the company’s Chicago-based Merchandise
Mart Properties Inc. unit.  Stopping Payments  The company ceased making debt-service payments on the High
Point properties last year due to insufficient  cash flow ,
according to earlier filings.  “The debt is being settled at a discount to its face
value,” said Goldfarb. “That discount is what they’re
recognizing.”  Vornado also recorded a gain of $10.5 million on the sale
of a mezzanine loan in Tharaldson Lodging Cos., and income of
$72.3 million on the reversal of a loan loss on 280 Park Ave.
Vornado and competitor  SL Green Realty Corp. (SLG)  in March formed a
joint venture to hold about $400 million of debt on the midtown
Manhattan tower.  J.C. Penney Investment  The company also reported a gain of $17.2 million of income
on its investment in J.C Penney, a Plano, Texas-based
department-store operator.  Excluding these items and others that affect comparability,
Vornado’s FFO fell to $338.5 million, or $1.77 a share, from
$348.6 million, or $1.84, a year earlier.  Vornado declined 98 cents, or 1 percent, to $95.86 at 4:15
p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. The stock has
gained 15 percent this year compared with a 9.9 percent increase
in the Bloomberg REIT Index.  First-quarter revenue rose 7.6 percent to $737.1 million.
Revenue from  New York  office rents increased less than 1 percent
to $210.3 million, while Washington office rental revenue fell
1.6 percent to $139.3 million. Revenue from retail rents climbed
12 percent to $118.6 million.  New York and Washington area offices accounted for more
than half of the company’s 2010 earnings before taxes and other
items, according to Vornado’s annual shareholder letter. Retail
was another 19 percent.  ‘Constructive’ on New York  “We are very constructive on New York,” Chairman  Steven Roth  said in the April 15 letter. “There is no doubt that New
York assets and Washington assets are No. 1 and 2 on global
investors’ wish list.”  Vornado’s properties in New York include 1 and 2 Penn Plaza
and 1290 Avenue of the Americas, near Rockefeller Center. Among
its Washington-area buildings are 1 and 2 Democracy Plaza in
Bethesda,  Maryland . Retail holdings include New York’s Manhattan
Mall and The Outlets at Bergen Town Center in Paramus,  New
Jersey .  The first-quarter results include fourth-quarter after-tax
FFO from Vornado’s 33 percent share of Toys “R” Us, the
world’s biggest toy merchant, of $124.5 million, down from
$137.2 million a year earlier. Toys “R” Us gets more than 80
percent of its yearly net income in the quarter, which includes
the  Christmas shopping season .  To contact the reporter on this story:
