Bridgepoint Education Inc. (BPI) , the owner
of Ashford University, rose the most in six months after it
forecast 2011 profit that topped analysts’ estimates.  Earnings per share will be $2.47 to $2.57 this year, the
San Diego-based company said today in a statement. Analysts
projected $2.26 a share, the average of estimates compiled by
Bloomberg.  The company also topped analysts’ projections for revenue
and enrollment in the first quarter, helping quell concern that
regulatory changes for the U.S. for-profit college industry
expected later this year will hurt future earnings, according to
Jeff Silber, an analyst at BMO Capital Markets in New York.  Bridgepoint gained $1.48, or 8.1 percent, to $19.87 at 4
p.m. in  New York  Stock Exchange composite trading, the biggest
advance since Nov. 2. The stock has risen 4.6 percent this year.  Net income in the first quarter jumped 81 percent to $53.9
million, or 92 cents a share, from $29.8 million, or 49 cents, a
year earlier. Sales climbed 47 percent to $229.4 million,
topping the average $217 million estimate.  Total enrollment rose to 88,252 in the period, exceeding
Silber’s estimate of 83,485.  Bridgepoint raised its total enrollment forecast for the
year to at least 82,000, from its previous prediction of at
least 81,000.  The U.S. Education Department has proposed rules for for-
profit college companies that would tie their access to federal
grants and loans to the incomes and loan-repayment rates of
their schools’ former students.  To contact the reporter on this story:
