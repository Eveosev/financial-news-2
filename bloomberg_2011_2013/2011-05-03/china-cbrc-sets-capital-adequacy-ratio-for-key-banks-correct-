(Corrects adequacy ratio for non-key banks in second
paragraph.)  Chinaâ€™s banking regulator said
systemically important banks should have capital adequacy ratio
of no lower than 11.5 percent and are required to meet the
standard by end 2013, according to a statement on its website
today.  The capital adequacy ratio for non-important banks is set
at 10.5 percent and banks should fulfill the requirement by the
end of 2016, the China Banking Regulatory Commission said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
