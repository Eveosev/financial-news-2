OAO Polymetal, the Russian silver
producer, slipped for the first day in three after futures on
the metal tumbled.  Polymetal, which also produces gold, dropped 2.1 percent to
528.7 rubles by the 6:45 p.m. close in Moscow, its steepest
decline in a week.  Silver futures for July delivery fell $2.644, or 5.7
percent, to $43.44 an ounce on the Comex in  New York . A close at
that price would be the biggest drop since Nov. 10. Yesterday,
the metal plummeted 5.2 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
