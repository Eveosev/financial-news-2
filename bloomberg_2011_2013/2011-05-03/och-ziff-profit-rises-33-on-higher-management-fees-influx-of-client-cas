Och-Ziff Capital Management Group LLC (OZM) ,
the hedge-fund run by Daniel Och, said first-quarter profit
climbed 33 percent, helped by higher management fees and clients
adding new money.  Distributable profit, a measure excluding costs related to
Och-Ziff’s 2007 initial public offering, rose to $65.2 million,
or 16 cents a share, from $49.2 million, or 12 cents, a year
earlier, the New York-based company said today in a statement.
Earnings beat the 14-cent average estimate of eight analysts in
a Bloomberg survey.  Investors deposited a net $151 million in the first
quarter, helping lift assets under management to $29 billion.
Och, 50, is seeking to add assets and fees to reverse a 50
percent slump in the share price since his firm went public in
November 2007. Hedge-fund assets exceeded $2 trillion for the
first time at the end of the first quarter as the industry
recovered from record losses during the financial crisis.  “Capital inflows into the hedge-fund industry are
accelerating as institutional investors seek to increase the
proportion of non-correlated strategies in their portfolios,”
Och said in the statement. “Our dialog with both current and
prospective fund investors is active.”  Och-Ziff’s distributable earnings don’t comply with
generally accepted accounting principles. The firm reported a
net loss of $95.5 million, or 99 cents a share, compared with a
loss of $88.6 million, or $1.07, a year earlier. Costs
associated with the IPO will cause net losses through 2012, Och-
Ziff said in the statement.  Performance Gains  Performance-related appreciation added $944 million to Och-
Ziff’s assets in the first quarter, according to the statement.  The firm’s biggest fund, the OZ Master Fund, returned 3.4
percent last quarter. The Asia Master Fund advanced 1.5 percent,
the OZ Europe Master Fund climbed 3.6 percent and the OZ Global
Special Investments Master Fund gained 4.6 percent.  Och, a former Goldman Sachs Group Inc. trader, left the
firm in 1994 to start a hedge fund for Ziff Brothers Investments
LLC, which managed the Ziff family’s publishing fortune. He
oversaw money solely for the Ziffs for five years and then
opened his fund to outside investors in 1999.  To contact the reporter on this story:
