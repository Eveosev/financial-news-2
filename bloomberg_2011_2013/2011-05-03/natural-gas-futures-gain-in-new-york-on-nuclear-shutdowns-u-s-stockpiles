Natural gas futures gained in  New York 
for the third time in four days on below-average stockpiles and
nuclear power generation that’s near the lowest level in almost
12 years.  Gas futures advanced as much as 0.5 percent on speculation
that demand for the fuel will rise with nuclear production at 68
percent of U.S. capacity, according to the  Nuclear Regulatory
Commission  and data compiled by Bloomberg. Gas supplies totaled
1.685 trillion cubic feet on April 22, 11 percent below year-
earlier levels and 0.6 percent short of the five-year average.  “The market ran to 13-month highs on smaller-than-expected
storage injections and the nuclear power outages,” said Gene McGillian, an analyst and broker at Tradition Energy in
 Stamford , Connecticut. “Traders seem reluctant to retreat.”  Natural gas for June delivery rose 0.6 cent, or 0.1
percent, to $4.699 per million British thermal units at 9:20
a.m. on the New York Mercantile Exchange. The futures have
climbed 6.7 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
