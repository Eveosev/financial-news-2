Australia  plans to open some of the
Woomera prohibited defense area in the center of the continent
to the development of resource projects that could be worth as
much as A$35 billion ($38.2 billion).  “A new management framework will be introduced to increase
use of the Woomera prohibited area in Australia’s national
interest by better balancing national security and economic
considerations,” Defence Minister Stephen Smith said today in
an e-mailed statement. Iron ore, gold and uranium projects may
be among possible developments in the next decade, he said.  Woomera, a remote area in South Australia state, was
established in the 1940s as a test site for rocket launches.
Australia blocked a A$2.6 billion bid by state-owned China
Minmetals Corp. for OZ Minerals Ltd. in March 2009 on national-
security concerns because the Prominent Hill mine was located
near Woomera. Australia later cleared the sale of most of the
rest of OZ Minerals’ assets to Minmetals.  The site will still be used for military purposes, Smith
said, releasing the results of a government report. The new
management plan will be developed over six months, he said.  “Its remoteness and size makes it a unique location for
large-scale and long-range weapons testing,” Smith said. “At
the same time, the new timeshare arrangement will allow greater
access, and greater certainty of access by the resources and
energy sectors.”  Australia produces about 20 percent of the world’s iron ore,
7 percent of its liquefied natural gas and 6 percent of its gold.  To contact the reporter on this story:
