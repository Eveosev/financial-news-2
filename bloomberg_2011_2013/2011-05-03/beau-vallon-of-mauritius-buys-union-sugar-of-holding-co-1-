Compagnie de Beau Vallon Ltd. of
Mauritius bought Trait d’Union, the holding company of Union
Sugar Estates Co., helping boost its sugarcane output and expand
into tourism, Chief Executive Officer Thierry Merven said.  The acquisition will increase Beau Vallon’s sugarcane
production as much as 45 percent to 290,000 metric tons, Merven
said by phone today from Saint-Hubert, Mauritius.  “The deal is of strategic importance as it will enable us
to diversify in the tourism sector, through the hotel and lodges
that Union owns,” he said.  The company owns a 25 percent stake in the holding company
of  Omnicane Ltd. (MTMD) , the Indian Ocean island’s third-largest
producer of the sweetener by market value, Merven said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
