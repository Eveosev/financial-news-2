A record number of  United Nations 
offset credits were used in the European Union’s emisssions
program last year because of the “attractive price spread”
between the two systems, according to Deutsche Bank AG.  The increase was also due to a “greater degree of
sophistication” of emitters and “heightened sensitivity” to
future restrictions of some credits from 2013,  Mark Lewis  and
Isabelle Curien, Paris-based analysts at the bank said in a note
dated yesterday.   To contact the reporter on this story:
