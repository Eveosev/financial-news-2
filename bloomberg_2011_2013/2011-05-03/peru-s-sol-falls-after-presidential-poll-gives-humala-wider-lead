Peru’s sol fell after a presidential
poll gave former military rebel Ollanta Humala a wider lead over
Congresswoman Keiko Fujimori than previous surveys.  The sol weakened 0.2 percent to 2.8293 per  U.S. dollar  at
12:14 p.m. New York time, from 2.8231 yesterday. The currency
has declined 1.1 percent since Humala won the April 10 first-
round vote, the second-worst performance among 25 emerging
market currencies tracked by Bloomberg after Turkey’s lira.  A poll published on May 1 by Imasen, a Lima-based research
company, gave Humala a 4.2 percentage point lead over Fujimori.
A poll issued by Datum Internacional April 29 said Humala, a
one-time ally of Venezuelan president  Hugo Chavez , led by 1.2
percentage points, the narrowest gap of four surveys since the
first-round vote.  “The market remains nervous after the poll by Imasen,
which generated demand” for dollars, said Gonzalo Navarro, the
head trader at  Banco Santander  in  Lima . “Imasen’s survey didn’t
confirm the trend and that’s caused the sol to start falling
again. There is a little more demand from foreign banks because
of the decline in the real and stocks so the central bank will
probably intervene.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
