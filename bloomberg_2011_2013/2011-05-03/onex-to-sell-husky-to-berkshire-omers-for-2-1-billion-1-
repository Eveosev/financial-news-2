Onex Corp. (OCX)  agreed to sell Husky
International to Berkshire Partners and OMERS Private Equity for
$2.1 billion.  The transaction is expected to close “early in the third
quarter,” Onex said in a statement today from Toronto. Onex had
hired Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and JPMorgan Chase & Co. to
auction Husky off to rival buyout firms, people familiar with
the situation said in December.  Onex,  Canada ’s largest private equity firm, acquired Husky
in December 2007 with an equity investment of about $622
million, the company said in today’s statement. Upon completion,
Onex will have received total net proceeds of $1.8 billion
through its investment in Husky, including a prior distribution
of $98 million.  Bolton, Ontario-based Husky makes machines that turn resin
into plastic products such as bottles and medical syringes.
Husky had earnings before interest, taxes and depreciation and
amortization of $197 million in the 12 months ended Sept. 30,
according to a statement posted on Onex’s website in December.  To contact the reporter on this story:
