Alcoa Inc. (AA)  advanced amid record
bullish options volume on speculation Rio Tinto Group will make
a takeover offer for the largest U.S. aluminum producer.  Alcoa climbed 45 cents, or 2.6 percent, to $17.67 at
4:15 p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading, giving
it a market value of $18.8 billion. More than 360,000 calls to
buy the stock changed hands, eight times the four-week average
and the fourth-largest call volume on U.S. exchanges, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Mark Kelly , an analyst at Olivetree Securities in  London ,
said he was skeptical about “unsubstantiated” speculation
today that Rio has secured a syndicated loan it may use to make
a bid for  Alcoa for $25.50 a share. Rio has “generally been
happy” to focus on smaller purchases, such as Australian coal
miner  Riversdale Mining Ltd. (RIV) , Kelly said today in a report.  “Rio shareholder feedback to us has been that they vastly
prefer the company to pursue this path than try to go back to
the days of large levered acquisitions,” Kelly said. “It would
be a surprise to see such a move.”  Rio, the world’s third-largest mining company, paid
$38.1 billion in 2007 for Canadian aluminum producer Alcan Inc.,
the industry’s largest acquisition. That deal left Rio with
almost $40 billion of debt as it headed into the global
financial crisis, forcing it to undertake a $15.2 billion rights
offer in 2009.  Market Speculation  Tony Shaffer, a London-based spokesman for Rio, and Michael Belwood, a spokesman for New York-based Alcoa, said separately
that their companies don’t comment on market speculation.  “Rumors that  Rio Tinto  could make a $25.50-a-share bid for
the U.S. company spurred speculators to the options market,”
Caitlin Duffy, an equity-options analyst at Greenwich,
Connecticut-based Interactive Brokers Group Inc., wrote in a
note today. “Both Rio Tinto and Alcoa are mum on the subject of
takeover talks as of now, but investors are making a lot of
noise in options land.”  Alcoa’s most-active options were May $18 calls, which more
than tripled to 47 cents and accounted for about a sixth of all
call trades. The next-biggest volume was in the May $20 calls,
which rose sixfold. Both contracts traded about 58,000 times,
compared with an open interest of 46,024 for the $18 calls and
12,514 for the $20 calls before today. Today’s volume for puts
to sell the stock was 89,013 contracts.  Alcoa’s implied volatility, the key gauge of option prices,
for at-the-money options expiring in 30 days surged by more than
a third to 38.79, the highest in six weeks.  To contact the reporters on this story:
