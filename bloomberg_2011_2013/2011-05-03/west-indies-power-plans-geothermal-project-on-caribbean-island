West Indies Power Holdings BV , the
Caribbean geothermal developer, is planning an 8.5-megawatt
project on the 36-square-mile island of Nevis.  West Indies Power intends to develop the project with a $55
million loan from the Export Import Bank of the  United States ,
the Charlestown-based company said in a May 1. That includes
upgrades to eight miles of transmission lines, according to the
statement.  The Nevis Island Administration has been authorized by the
islandâ€™s legislative body to guarantee the loan, which is
necessary for the lending to take place, the company said.  West Indies Power is developing projects on the islands of
Nevis and Saba through two subsidiaries, according to its
website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
