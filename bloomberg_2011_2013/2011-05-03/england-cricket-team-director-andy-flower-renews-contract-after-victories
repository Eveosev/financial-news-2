Andy Flower renewed his contract as
 England  cricket team director after seeing the side win two Test
series against  Australia  and move up the international rankings
since he started the role.  Flower took the post on a permanent basis in 2009, and
England has risen to third from sixth in the International
Cricket Council Test rankings. It’s also gone up one place to
fifth in the one-day game.  In 2009, England defeated Australia 2-1 to regain the Ashes
and in 2010-11 won an Ashes series in Australia for the first
time since 1987 with a 3-1 victory. Last year England won the
World Twenty20 title.  Flower’s contract is on continuous basis, rather than
having a fixed term. The England and Wales Cricket Board
announced its renewal in an e-mailed release.  Former Zimbabwe captain Flower, 43, was quoted as saying he
remained “fully committed to developing the side and ensuring
we are in a position to realize our objective of becoming the
No. 1 side in the world.”  England faces  Sri Lanka ,  India  and Ireland later this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
