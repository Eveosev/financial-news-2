Proposed rules that would restrict
for-profit colleges’ access to student aid have been sent to the
White House for review, bringing them a step closer to approval.  The Education Department regulations, known as “gainful
employment,” were sent to the White House’s Office of Management
& Budget yesterday, said Jane Glickman, a department
spokeswoman.  For-profit colleges and their lobbyists have fought the
proposal, which ties access to federal student grants and loans
to former students’ incomes and loan-repayment rates. Budget
office reviews are typically limited to 90 days and the OMB
expects to conclude the examination before that deadline, said
Meg Reilly, a spokeswoman for the office. This is the final step
in the government’s review before the rules are published, she
said.  Education Secretary Arne Duncan delayed issuing the rules
in September after the department received about 90,000 letters,
most of them voicing opposition to the regulations. Education
companies doubled their spending on Washington lobbying last
year to at least $6.6 million to defeat the rules, according to
 Opensecrets.org , a website that tracks lobbying and campaign
spending.  For-profit colleges have said that the rules unfairly
punish schools that serve low-income students. More than 100
U.S. lawmakers led by Democratic Representative Alcee Hastings
of  Florida  wrote President Barack Obama April 27, asking him to
“jettison” the proposal.  The Bloomberg For-Profit Education Index of 13 companies
gained less than 1 percent at 4:24 p.m. New York time.  To contact the reporter on this story:
