Kenya ’s shilling depreciated for the
first day in four as companies stepped up demand for dollars
following an extended weekend.  The currency of East Africa’s biggest economy weakened as
much as 0.5 percent to 83.67 per dollar and was trading 0.3
percent down at 83.48 by 12:02 p.m. in the capital, Nairobi.
Yesterday the markets were closed for Labor Day.  “The local unit has weakened due to residual demand
occasioned by the long weekend and it’s expected to weaken in
the coming days as oil importers seek more dollars to cover
their bills,” Chris Muiga, a senior dealer at Nairobi-based
Kenya Commercial Bank Ltd., said in a phone interview today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
