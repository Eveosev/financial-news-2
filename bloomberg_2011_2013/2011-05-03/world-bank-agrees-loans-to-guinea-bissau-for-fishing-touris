The  World Bank  said it will grant
Guinea-Bissau two loans to increase the protection of fishing
waters and nature reserves in the West African state.  An $8 million loan will fund satellite monitoring and
coastguard patrols to curb illegal fishing, Country Program
Coordinator McDonald Benjamin told reporters in Dakar, Senegal,
yesterday.  “Because of these protections, the country’s fish stock
will increase, average fish sizes will grow, and every time a
boat leaves to fish, they will catch more and better fish with
less and less effort,” Benjamin said.  A second $9.5 million loan will create three national parks
in the former Portuguese colony that will be “the basis of
tourism in the future,” he said.  Guinea-Bissau’s ambassador to  Senegal , Mario Leopoldo
Cabral, told reporters the funds would help diversify Guinea-
Bissau’s economy away from cashew nuts, its primary cash crop.  To contact the reporter on this story:
