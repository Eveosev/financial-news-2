Archer Daniels Midland Co., the
world’s largest grain processor, posted a 37 percent increase in
fiscal third-quarter profit as food-ingredient demand climbed.  Net income rose to $578 million, or 86 cents a share, in
the three months through March, from $421 million, or 65 cents,
a year earlier, the Decatur, Illinois-based company said today
in a statement. The average estimate of 12 analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg was for profit of 85 cents a share. Sales advanced 33
percent to $20.1 billion from $15.1 billion.  Operating profit in the corn processing unit jumped 96
percent to $204 million because of rising demand for food and
feed ingredients such as lysine, ADM said. Operating profit at
the oilseed-processing unit rose 26 percent to $512 million.  “Global demand for crops and agricultural products remains
strong,” Chief Executive Officer Patricia Woertz said in the
statement.  ADM dropped 79 cents, or 2.1 percent, to $36.21 as of 8:46
a.m. before the start of regular trading on the New York Stock
Exchange. The shares gained 23 percent this year through
yesterday.  (ADM will hold a conference at 9 a.m. New York time which
