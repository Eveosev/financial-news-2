Hong Kong ’s retail sales rose a more-
than-forecast 26 percent in March from a year earlier on reduced
unemployment and increased tourist numbers.  Sales climbed to HK$31.2 billion ($4 billion) after a
revised 8.5 percent gain in February, the government said today
on its website. That was more than the median 18.5 percent
estimate of eight economists in a Bloomberg News survey.  Unemployment fell to the lowest level since the global
financial crisis in the first quarter. Visitor arrivals from
 China  increased 23 percent in March from a year earlier,
according to the Hong Kong Tourism Board.  “Consumers are happy to spend their paychecks due to
better job prospects,” Joanne Yim, chief economist at Hang Seng
Bank Ltd. in Hong Kong, said before today’s data. “The strong
inflows of tourists also helped prop up the retail business.”  Hong Kong will give a handout of HK$6,000 to each permanent
resident, Financial Secretary John Tsang said last month. The
money will encourage retail spending and benefit companies
including Hutchison Whampoa Ltd. and  Lifestyle International
Holdings Ltd. (1212) , CLSA Asia-Pacific Markets said in March.  By volume, retail sales grew 20 percent in March from a
year earlier, the government said.  -- With assistance from Michael Munoz and Marco Lui in Hong Kong.
