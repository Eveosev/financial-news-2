Venezuelan President  Hugo Chavez  will
announce today the creation of a government commission that will
set maximum prices to be implemented across all sectors of the
national economy, newspaper  El Nacional  reported.  Officials will set up a central office that will monitor
production costs and set maximum profit rates that will be
adjusted every three months, the Caracas-based daily said today.  The measure will allow companies that manufacture goods in
 Venezuela  to earn higher profits than import companies, El
Nacional reported, citing Nicmer Evans, a government official
working on the law to form the commission.  To contact the reporter on this story:
