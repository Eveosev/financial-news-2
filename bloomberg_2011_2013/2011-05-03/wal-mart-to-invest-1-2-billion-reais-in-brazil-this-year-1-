Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (WMT) , the world’s
largest retailer, plans to invest 1.2 billion reais ($756
million) in  Brazil  this year, as foreign companies seek to
benefit from the expansion of Latin America’s largest economy.  “We are in a continuous rate of growth, which led to the
opening of 45 stores last year and will allow 80 new stores”
this year, Marcos Samaha, president of the company’s unit in the
South American country, told reporters today in Brasilia, after
meeting with the country’s Trade Minister Fernando Pimentel.
“We have absolute confidence in the success of this country.”  Brazil’s fastest economic expansion in more than two
decades, fueled by surges in credit and employment, is prompting
foreign companies, from supermarket chains to carmakers, to
increase investments to take advantage of the growing consumer
market.  Japan ’s  Mitsubishi Motors Corp. (7211)  said last week it will
invest about 1 billion reais to increase production at its
Brazil factory over five years.  Wal-Mart’s expansion plan includes hiring 7,000 people in
Brazil in 2011, Samaha said.  Brazil’s economy grew 7.5 percent last year and may expand
4 percent in 2011, according to the quarterly inflation report
published March 30 by Brazil’s central bank.  To contact the reporter on this story:
