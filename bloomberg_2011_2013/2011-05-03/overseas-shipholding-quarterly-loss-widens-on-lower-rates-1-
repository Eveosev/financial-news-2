Overseas Shipholding Group, the
largest U.S.-based oil-tanker owner, reported a widening first
quarter loss as shipping rates declined.  The loss increased to $34.6 million, or $1.15 a share, from
$9.35 million, or 34 cents, a year earlier, the New York-based
company said in a statement today. The average estimate of seven
analysts surveyed by Bloomberg was a loss of $1.50 a share.
Sales fell 2.3 percent to $263.7 million from $269.8 million.  Overseas Shipholding kept about 80 percent of its fleet
under spot, or single-voyage, contracts, making itself
vulnerable to declines in spot rates. The average rate for
supertankers tumbled 77 percent during the quarter, according to
the London-based  Baltic Exchange .  “They are quite exposed to the  spot market , although the
first quarter is better than the fourth quarter,” said Martin Korsvold, an analyst at Pareto Securities AS in Oslo, who has a
“sell” rating on the stock. “The crude-tanker market will
still be quite negative going forward, but the product-tanker
sector may become a bit positive.”  Overseas Shipholding gained 49 cents, or 1.8 percent, to
$28.08 in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. The stock
has dropped 21 percent this year.  Shipping Rates  Spot shipping rates of very-large crude carriers, or VLCCs,
averaged $8,533 a day during the first quarter, down from
$36,620 a day a year earlier, according to the Baltic Exchange.  The tanker owner was paid an average rate of $24,131 a day
in the quarter for its VLCCs, down from $49,931 a year earlier,
according to the statement. The ships, which can carry about 2
million barrels of oil, operate mainly between the  Persian Gulf 
and ports in Asia and the U.S.  This year “is another challenging year largely based on
supply cycle,” Chief Executive Officer Morten Arntzen said
today. “The second half of the year would be stronger than the
first and as a result we would deliver time charter rates that
were substantially on par with last year’s levels.”  About 65 percent of revenue days have been fixed this year,
Arntzen said in an earnings conference call. In 2012, 52 percent
of revenue days have been fixed with long-term contracts.  At the end of March, Overseas Shipholding owned and
operated 108 vessels, down from 110 vessels a year earlier.  To contact the reporter on this story:
