Taiwan ’s dollar trimmed its advance on
suspected intervention by the central bank to slow appreciation
of the currency that may hurt exports.  The monetary authority stepped in at the 4 p.m. close,
according to two traders, who declined to be identified as the
central bank doesn’t disclose such details. The Taiex index of
shares fell for a third day as investors favored the relative
safety of debt on concern the killing of  Osama bin Laden  will
lead to revenge attacks.  “Surely, the central bank did some adjustment at the
close,” said  Albert Lee , a fixed-income trader at Cathay United
Bank in Taipei. “Some exporters will sell their U.S. dollars if
they see a better price. People see in the long term Asian
currencies will still be in an appreciating mode.”  Taiwan’s dollar strengthened 0.2 percent to NT$28.702
against its U.S. counterpart as of its 4 p.m. close, according
to Taipei Forex Inc. It earlier touched NT$28.508, the strongest
level since October 1997. The currency was trading 0.8 percent
stronger at NT$28.540 two minutes before the end of trading.  The yield on the 1 percent note due January 2016, the most-
active government security, was little changed at 1.095 percent,
according to Gretai Securities Market.  “Bin Laden’s death has caused a flight to safety,” said
Joy Tseng, a Taipei-based fixed-income trader at Polaris
Securities Co.  To contact the reporter on this story:
