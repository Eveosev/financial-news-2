Mark Devonshire, who formerly led
Merrill Lynch’s proprietary credit trading business, has
received a 50 million-euro ($74 million) “seed” investment for
MCapital Investment Management Ltd., his new hedge fund, the
Financial Times reported, citing unidentified people familiar
with the matter.  The investment, from Advanced Capital, an Italian private-
equity fund of funds, will enable MCapital to start raising cash
from regular investors, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
