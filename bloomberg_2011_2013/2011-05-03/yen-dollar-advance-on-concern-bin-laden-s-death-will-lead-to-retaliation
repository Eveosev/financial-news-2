The yen and the Swiss franc rose
against all of their most-traded counterparts as investors
sought the currencies’ relative safety amid declines in equities
and commodities.  The dollar erased gains against the euro as stocks trimmed
losses after a report showed U.S. factory orders rose more than
forecast.  Canada ’s dollar fluctuated after rising earlier as
Prime Minister Stephen Harper’s Conservatives won a majority of
seats in Parliament for the first time.  “It’s somewhat of a risk-off day, and the more defensive
currencies are outperforming,” said  Paul Mackel , a currency
strategist at HSBC Holdings Plc in London. “Some people have
been looking at how crowded it was getting to be in terms of
short dollars, so you’re seeing some risk being taken off the
table.” A short is a bet a currency will fall.  The yen appreciated 0.1 percent to 120.33 per euro at 11:36
a.m. in New York. Japan’s currency gained 0.4 percent to 80.91
yen per dollar after appreciating to 80.70, the strongest since
March 23. The greenback fell 0.4 percent versus the European
common currency to $1.4886 after depreciating yesterday to
$1.4902, the weakest level since December 2009.  The Swiss franc gained 0.5 percent to 86.06 centimes per
dollar and strengthened 0.2 percent to 1.2803 per euro.  The dollar earlier strengthened from a 16-month low against
the euro on speculation the European currency’s gains this year
may not be sustained.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index declined 0.2 percent after
dropping 0.5 percent earlier.  Factory Orders Rise  Orders placed with U.S. factories rose 3 percent in March,
a fifth consecutive increase, the Commerce Department said
today. The median forecast of 66 economists surveyed by
Bloomberg News projected a 2 percent increase.  The yen typically strengthens in times of political,
financial and economic turmoil.  Japan ’s trade surplus makes the
currency attractive because it means the nation doesn’t have to
rely on overseas lenders. The dollar benefits as the world’s
main reserve currency. Financial markets in Japan are shut today
for a holiday.  Crude oil for June delivery was down 0.9 percent to $112.56
a barrel in New York, and the Reuters/Jefferies CRB Index of  raw
materials  fell 0.3 percent  The Canadian dollar was up 0.1 percent to 94.97 U.S. cents
after dropping as much as 0.4 percent and gaining as much as 0.5
percent. Raw materials account for about half of Canada’s export
revenue.  Earlier the Canadian currency gained 0.5 percent and rose
against most of its 16 most-active counterparts as Harper won a
majority of seats in Parliament, giving him a mandate to fund
corporate and personal income tax cuts with curbs on spending.  Brazil ’s Real  Brazil’s real erased an earlier decline of 0.4 percent to
trade at 1.5862 per dollar, up 0.2 percent.  The Australian and  New Zealand  dollars slipped for a second
day. Commodities make up a majority of exports for the two South
Pacific nations.  “With a commodity unwind, commodity currencies will come
under pressure,” said  Tim Kelleher , vice-president of
institutional banking and markets at Commonwealth Bank of
 Australia  in Auckland.  Australia’s dollar declined 0.3 percent to $1.0916 after
rising to $1.1012 yesterday, the strongest since its free float
in 1983. New Zealand’s dollar, nicknamed the kiwi, fell 0.2
percent to 80.47 U.S. cents.  The Aussie remained lower after the  Reserve Bank  of
Australia left the overnight cash rate target at 4.75 percent at
a policy meeting today. The RBA’s decision was forecast by 21 of
22 economists surveyed by Bloomberg News.  Sterling Drops  The pound was the worst performer among major currencies,
dropping as an index of U.K. manufacturing growth declined.
Markit Economics and the Chartered Institute of Purchasing and
Supply index fell to 54.6 in April from 56.7 in March.  Sterling weakened 1.19 percent to 89.98 pence per euro and
touched 90.07, the weakest since March 29, 2010. It slid 0.8
percent to $1.6528.  Bank of England  Governor  Mervyn King  said high debt levels
pose “massive” economic challenges that would be exacerbated
by increased long-term  interest rates .  “The market continues to price out the chance of a rate
hike before the end of August,” said  Stephen Gallo , head of
market analysis at Schneider Foreign Exchange in  London . The
delay in an interest rate increase will cause a “selloff in the
pound.”  Bank of England policy makers are split four ways over
monetary policy. The central bank probably will leave the key
interest rate at a record-low 0.5 percent at the next rate
meeting on May 5, according to a Bloomberg News survey.  Reprisal Concern  Refuge currencies also gained amid concern that reprisal
attacks would follow the death of  Osama bin Laden . U.S. and
other Western officials emphasized the danger from terrorism may
increase. Interpol told its 188 member countries to be on full
alert following the killing of the al-Qaeda leader in  Pakistan .  The Swiss franc rose the most over the past week among the
10 developed-nation currencies in the Bloomberg Correlation-
Weighted Currency Indexes, adding 0.8 percent. The euro rose 0.7
percent, while the dollar fell 1 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
