U.S. senators introduced a bill to
repeal a $6-billion-a-year tax break that helps the corn ethanol
industry.  Senators  Dianne Feinstein , a California Democrat, and  Tom Coburn , an Oklahoma Republican, said the 45-cent credit, which
is given to oil refiners for each gallon of ethanol they blend
with gasoline, was unjustified given the U.S. deficit.  The break is set to expire this year. Repealing it by July
1 would save about $3 billion, the senators said. The
legislation also would repeal a 54-cent tariff on ethanol
imports.  “It’s time we end subsidies that we cannot afford and
tariffs that increase gas prices,” Feinstein said in a
statement.  Matt Hartwig, a spokesman for the Renewable Fuels
Association, a trade group for ethanol producers in Washington,
said in an e-mail that the bill would increase gas prices and
oil imports.  Democratic Senators Ben Cardin of  Maryland  and James Webb
of Virginia and Republicans Richard Burr of North Carolina,
 Susan Collins  of Maine and James Risch of Idaho also support the
bill, according to the statement from Feinstein.  Coburn has also introduced the bill as an amendment to
small-business legislation the Senate is now debating, according
to John Hart, a spokesman for Coburn.  To contact the reporter on this story:
