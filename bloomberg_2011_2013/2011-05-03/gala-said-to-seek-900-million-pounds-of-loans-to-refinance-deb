Gala Coral Group Ltd., the U.K. gaming
company run by creditors led by Apollo Global Management LLC, is
seeking 900 million pounds ($1.5 billion) of loans to repay
maturing debt, two people familiar with the situation said.  Gala, which runs bingo and betting parlors, plans to raise
800 million pounds from a seven-year term loan B paying interest
of 5 percentage points more than the London interbank offered
rate, and a 100 million-pound six-year revolving credit with a
margin of 4 percentage points, said the people, who declined to
be identified because the deal is private.  Gala may issue high-yield bonds as part of the refinancing,
the people said.  Barclays Capital , Credit Suisse Group AG, Deutsche Bank AG,
Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Morgan Stanley are arranging the
financing, the people said. They will market the deal to other
lenders at a meeting in London on May 5, the people said.  A spokeswoman for Nottingham, England-based Gala couldn’t
immediately comment.  Lenders took over Gala in a debt-for-equity swap last year
as the U.K. ban on smoking in public places crimped revenue and
left it struggling to meet its debt, which starts coming due
next year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Moody’s Investors Service last month cut Gala’s rating by
one level to B3, saying the company’s operating performance in
the year ending September 2011 will be “significantly worse
than expected.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
