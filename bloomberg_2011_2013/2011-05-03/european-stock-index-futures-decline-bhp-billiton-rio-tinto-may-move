a two-month high. The gauge in April had the biggest monthly
increase so far this year as companies reported earnings that
topped analyst estimates and the  Federal Reserve  maintained its
pledge to keep  interest rates  low for an “extended period.”  “There has been a lot of speculation that a new tax on
business cars in Germany may be introduced,” said Ioan Smith, a
London-based director at Knight Capital  Europe  Ltd. “An article
came out last week on the topic but more people are trading on
the news today. It just shows how priced-to-perfection some of

European markets today. Germany’s DAX dropped 0.4 percent and

in nine days after a report commissioned by the German
environment ministry said the government should change the way
it taxes company cars.  The current system that taxes the private use of company
cars based on their list price should be replaced with a system
based on the purchase price and kilometers traveled, according
to the study by the Cologne-based Fifo economic institute posted
on its website. The revised rules should also discourage
companies from buying cars that use a lot of gasoline, it said.  Volkswagen, Europe’s biggest carmaker, slid 1.7 percent to

ago period. Revenue remained unchanged at 15.5 billion euros.  “There is a lack of positive surprises in today’s news,”
said Peter Steiner, an analyst at BHF Bank in Frankfurt.  Deutsche Bank AG declined 2.1 percent to 43.25 euros.

misrepresentations in joining a federal loan program and “years
of reckless lending practices,” according to court filings.  Man Group Plc (EMG)  led advancing shares, rallying 3.3 percent to
