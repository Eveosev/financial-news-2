HSBC Holdings Plc (HSBA) , Europe’s biggest
bank, may improve its return on equity by selling assets in the
U.S. and freeing $25 billion of capital, according to analysts
at  Barclays Capital .  The bank may seek to sell branches and its credit-card
business in the U.S., wrote analysts led by London-based Rohith Chandra-Rajan in a note to investors today.  “A reduction in the scale of these businesses could free
up about $25 billion of capital for use in the higher return and
faster growth emerging markets businesses,” wrote Chandra-
Rajan. The bank may also raise $5 billion from the sale of its
16 percent stake in Ping An Insurance (Group) Co. of  China 
“where we see the least operational overlap,” he wrote.  HSBC Chief Executive Officer  Stuart Gulliver  on May 11 is
holding a “strategy day” to tell investors about his plans for
the bank, following his promotion in January. Banks including
 Barclays Plc (BARC)  are reviewing their businesses as regulators force
lenders to hold more capital to prevent another financial
crisis.  HSBC will explain how it will reduce costs to between 48
percent and 52 percent of revenue over a two-to-three year
period, from 55 percent in 2010, the Barclays Capital analysts
said.  The bank in February cut its return-on-equity profitability
target to between 12 percent and 15 percent, instead of 15
percent to 19 percent, as full-year earnings missed estimates.  To contact the reporters on this story:
