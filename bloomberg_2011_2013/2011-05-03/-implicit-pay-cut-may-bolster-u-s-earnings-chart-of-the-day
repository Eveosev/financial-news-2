U.S. workers took “an implicit pay
cut” that will help companies sustain profitability as energy
and commodity prices rise, according to  Russ Koesterich , global
chief investment strategist for iShares exchange-traded funds.  The CHART OF THE DAY shows year-to-year percentage changes
in average hourly and weekly earnings, as compiled by the U.S.
Labor Department, after adjusting for inflation.  Both gauges dropped together in March for the first time in
a year. Real earnings fell 1 percent, the biggest decline since
September 2008, for hourly workers and 0.4 percent for weekly
employees from a year earlier.  “Earnings are likely to remain low for the rest of the
year, which supports profit margins,” Koesterich wrote
yesterday on a blog published by iShares. The  posting  was picked
up today at Seeking Alpha, a financial website.  “Companies are also benefiting from cheap capital,” he
added. U.S. corporate borrowers with Baa credit ratings are now
paying about 6 percent, less than a 7.7 percent average for the
past 20 years, the posting said.  Earnings at companies in the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index
equaled 13.5 percent of sales for the 12 months ended in March,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The margin rose for the
sixth consecutive quarter. The Thomson Reuters/Jefferies CRB
Index, a commodity-price gauge, jumped 31 percent in the period.  To contact the reporter on this story:
