Asset Management Finance LLC, an
affiliate of  Credit Suisse Group AG (CSGN) , bought a passive, minority
stake in Lucidus Capital LLP, the credit hedge fund run by
Darryl Green and Geoffrey Sherry.  The investment won’t affect the operations of the fund,
which was started in 2009 by Green and Sherry, AMF said in a
statement today from  New York . Lucidus has $1.8 billion in
notional assets under management and employs 38 people in  London 
and New York.  The stake in Lucidus is the second transaction in Europe
for AMF, which makes minority investments in asset managers. The
company said in January that it bought a minority stake in
Brigade Capital Management LLC, a New York-based credit fund
founded by Don Morgan and Pat Kelly.  “AMF continues to look for growth opportunities in
 Europe ,” Brian Finn, the company’s chief executive officer,
said in the statement.  Bruce Kovner, founder of $11 billion hedge fund Caxton
Associates, and Peter D’Angelo, Caxton’s president, will keep
their minority equity stake in Lucidus through Caxton, AMF said.  AMF is majority-owned by Credit Suisse, Switzerland’s
second-largest bank, and has invested more than $750 million in
21 firms that together manage more than $80 billion in assets.
AMF investors include National Bank Financial Inc.’s Proctor NBF
Capital Partners, and Tokio Marine & Nichido Fire Insurance Co.
