Martine Aubry , the secretary general
of the French Socialist Party, denied a report in the  Nouvel
Observateur  magazine that she won’t seek the party’s nomination
to challenge Nicolas Sarkozy in 2012 presidential elections.  Aubry and  Dominique Strauss-Kahn  agreed they won’t run
against each other, and the International Monetary Fund head
could announce his candidacy in late June, the magazine said,
without citing sources.  Francois Lamy, a spokesman for Aubry, said the article was
wrong. He declined to comment about talks with Strauss-Kahn.  To contact the reporter on this story:
