Daqo New Energy Corp., a Chinese
polysilicon manufacturer, formed a joint venture to build and
operate a solar-module plant with a Canadian partner.  The C$5 million ($5.24 million) facility is expected to go
into production in the fourth quarter, Wanzhou, China-based Daqo
said today in a statement. Daqo will pay for 85 percent of the
project, and the engineering services provider JNE Consulting
Ltd. will fund the remainder.  The plant will be in Hamilton, Ontario, where JNE is based,
and will initially have the capacity to produce 25 megawatts of
solar modules, Daqo said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
