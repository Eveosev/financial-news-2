Ecobank Ghana Ltd. (EBG) , the country’s
third-biggest lender by market capitalization, rose the most in
eight weeks after first-quarter profit increased 62 percent.  The stock gained 3 pesewas, or 0.9 percent, to 3.51 cedis
by 1 p.m. in the capital, Accra. That’s the most since March 9.  “The bank’s first-quarter profit was impressive,” Doris
Yaa Ahiati, an analyst at the stock brokerage unit of Accra-
based  Databank Financial Services Ltd. , said in a telephone
interview today.  Ecobank’s net income in the three months through March rose
to 19.4 million cedis ($13 million) as net interest income
climbed to 28.9 million cedis from 26.4 million a year earlier,
it said in a statement published in Accra-based Daily Graphic
newspaper April 29. The Ghana Stock Exchange was closed
yesterday for a public holiday.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
