Questioning the number of legal
immigrants that France admits each year is “common sense”
because of the country’s high  unemployment rate , President
 Nicolas Sarkozy  said.  “With our problems in finding a job for our citizens, and
an unemployment rate for non-Europeans of 23 percent, we must
look into the question of legal immigration,” Sarkozy said in
an interview with  L’Express  magazine that was published today.  France’s active population is growing by 110,000 annually,
he said. “I wouldn’t say the same thing if I were running
 Germany , which loses 100,000 active people each year,” Sarkozy
said. “We must adapt economic immigration to these realities
and make sure our professional training better matches the needs
of our economy.”  Interior Minister Claude Gueant, in an interview with
 Figaro  magazine a month ago, was the first government minister
to suggest that  France  reduce legal immigration and not just
tackle undocumented workers.  Political opponents, and even some members of the
government, accused Gueant of responding to a high score by the
anti-immigrant National Front in March regional elections.  To contact the reporter on this story:
