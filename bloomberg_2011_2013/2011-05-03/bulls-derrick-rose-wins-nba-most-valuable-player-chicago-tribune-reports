Derrick Rose  of the Chicago Bulls will
be named the  National Basketball Association ’s Most Valuable
Player today, the youngest winner of the league’s top individual
award,  the Chicago Tribune reported .  At 22 years, 7 months, Rose is about five months younger
than Wes Unseld, who claimed the honor in 1969 with the
Baltimore Bullets to start a Hall of Fame career, the Tribune
said, citing unidentified people.  He also is the first Bulls player to win the award since
 Michael Jordan  won for the fifth time in 1997-98.  Rose, a guard in his third season in the NBA, is the first
player since Dave Cowens in 1973 to become MVP after receiving
no votes the previous year, the Tribune said.  Rose led the Bulls with an average of 25 points in 81
regular-season games this year, with  Chicago  producing the
league’s best record, 62-20.  The Bulls lost 103-95 to the Atlanta Hawks last night in
the opening game of their second-round playoff series, with Rose
scoring 24 points. He left the court limping after injuring his
ankle on the closing play. The Bulls host the Hawks in Game 2
tomorrow night.  Rose, the No. 1 pick in the 2008 draft and the NBA Rookie
of the Year in 2008-09, is the first player since Dave Cowens in
1973 to become MVP after receiving no votes the previous year,
the  Chicago Tribune  said.  He’s also the seventh MVP to average at least 25 points,
7.5 assists and four rebounds in a season, after Oscar
Robertson,  Jerry West , Larry Bird, Jordan,  Dwyane Wade  and
 LeBron James . Rose averaged 7.7 assists and 4.1 rebounds per
game this season.  For his career, Rose has averaged 20.9 points, 6.7 assists
and 3.9 rebounds.  Coaching Award  Bulls coach Tom Thibodeau was named Coach of the Year two
days ago after guiding Chicago to a league-best 62-20 record in
his first season as a head coach.  Thibodeau, 53, became the seventh first-year coach to win
the Red Auerbach Trophy and the fourth Bulls coach to claim the
award. The most recent previous winner was Phil Jackson in 1996,
when the Bulls went on to win the NBA Finals for the fourth time
in six years. The other Chicago winners were Johnny Kerr in 1967
and Dick Motta four years later.  To contact the reporter on this story:
