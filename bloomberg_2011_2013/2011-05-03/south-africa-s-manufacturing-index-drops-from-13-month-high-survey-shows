South Africa ’s purchasing managers’
index fell in April from a 13-month high the month before,
 Kagiso Securities Ltd.  said, indicating a weak recovery in
manufacturing.  The seasonally adjusted index slid to 56.4 from 57.2 in
March, Johannesburg-based Kagiso said in an e-mailed statement
today. The PMI has been above 50, which indicates an expansion
in factory production, since November.  The central bank cut its benchmark rate three times last
year to a 30-year low of 5.5 percent to help support  consumer
spending  and boost growth in Africa’s biggest economy.
Manufacturers are still holding back on investment as demand
remains subdued, undermining  job creation .  “It remains disappointing that the improved activity
levels are to date not feeding through to increased hiring of
workers,” Kagiso consultant Theo Vorster said in the statement.  The index measuring new sales orders fell to 61.1 in April
from 62 in the previous month, while the business activity sub-
index slid 1.3 points to 58.4, Kagiso said.  Manufacturers probably shed jobs at a slower pace in April,
with the employment sub-index rising to 49 from 46.9 in March,
the survey showed.  The  Bureau for Economic Research , based at the University
of Stellenbosch near  Cape Town , and the Institute of Purchasing
and Supply South Africa conduct the PMI survey on behalf of
Kagiso.  To contact the reporter on this story:
