Factories, markets and offices were
deserted in  Pakistan ’s financial capital of Karachi after five
people were gunned down in political violence yesterday and
public buses were set ablaze by armed men across the city.  “Armed gangs on motorcycles emerged on the city’s roads
following the killing of a local politician,” Saud Mirza, the
city police chief, said by phone today. “They attacked 27 buses
and over 100 people were detained by police.”  Karachi, which is home to 18 million people and contributes
70 percent of the nation’s tax revenue, has been the scene of
frequent gun battles resulting in the killing of members of the
ruling  Pakistan Peoples Party , the  Muttahida Qaumi Movement,  a
former coalition partner, and the  Awami National Party . The
killing of the MQM’s Farooq Baig sparked yesterday’s violence.  Since January, 150 people have been shot dead in political
fighting in the city, according to Sharfuddin Memon, an adviser
on security to the provincial government of Sindh, of which
Karachi is the capital.  The benchmark Karachi Stock Exchange 100 index fell 0.2
percent to 12,011.56 at 10:30 a.m. local time and recorded a
volume of 6.7 million shares. The average daily volume since Jan.
1 has been 83.5 million shares, according to Bloomberg data.  “Production will be affected today since the security
situation has kept attendance low in factories,” said Saeed
Shafiq, president of the Karachi Chamber of Commerce and
Industry. As much as 4 billion rupees ($47 million) in factory
revenues will be lost, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
