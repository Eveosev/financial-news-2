Interconexion Electrica SA (ISA)  declined
for a second day after  Barclays Capital  said the Colombian
energy and infrastructure firm is “fully valued.”  While the company’s first-quarter earnings issued yesterday
showed higher-than-expected revenue from toll roads in Chile,
there is “limited potential” for transmission growth outside
Brazil, Barclays analysts Sergio Conti, Felipe Mattar and Bruno Pascon said in a report. The company also has a “well-below-
average” dividend yield, they said.  Interconexion trades at almost 40 times earnings, after
trading at 34 times in November 2009, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg. The Medellin-based company reported first-quarter
net income rose to 160.6 billion pesos ($91 million) from 78.5
billion pesos a year earlier, according to a statement on the
website of Colombia’s securities regulator.  The price-earnings ratio “is very high for the sector,”
said  Andres Jimenez , head of international sales at brokerage
Interbolsa SA.  Interconexion dropped 1.6 percent to 12,300 pesos in Bogota
trading at 4 p.m. New York time.  Barclays maintained its underweight recommendation on the
shares.  To contact the reporter on this story:
