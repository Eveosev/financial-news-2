Soc. Quimica y Minera de Chile SA, the
country’s biggest fertilizer producer, expects to achieve
targeted potash production of 2 million tons a year by 2013,
Deputy General Manager Patricio de Solminihac said.  SQM, as the company is known, plans to boost output from
1.7 million tons presently as it seeks to tap growing global
fertilizer demand, de Solminihac said at a Santiago conference.  Global trade in agricultural products climbed to an all-
time high in 2010, rising about 12 percent above the previous
record in 2008 on increased volumes and prices, according to the
European Union. Potash prices are rising as expanding food
demand strains global supplies of corn, soybean and wheat.  Fertilizer demand will continue to grow “like never
before” because of the need for increased food supplies, de
Solminihac said today.  Chilean businessman Julio Ponce owns a controlling stake in
SQM. Potash Corp. of Saskatchewan Inc., the world’s largest
potash producer, owns the next biggest stake in the company.  To contact the reporter on this story:
