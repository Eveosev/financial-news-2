India ’s government bonds declined
after the central bank raised  interest rates  by half a
percentage point.  Yields climbed to the highest level in almost three months
and the one-year swap rate jumped to a 30-month high as the
 Reserve Bank  of India lifted the repurchase rate to 7.25 percent,
more than most analysts surveyed by Bloomberg had forecast.
Inflation may stay around 9 percent until September because of
higher fuel prices, according to a central bank statement after
the decision.  “The economy will feel the pinch of a 50-basis point
increase more than a gradual increase,” said Pradeep Madhav,
the Mumbai-based managing director at Securities Trading Corp.
“The hike in rates anticipates a possible increase in fuel
prices, which may spur inflation.”  The yield on the 7.80 percent note due April 2021 rose
seven basis points to 8.21 percent as of 12:15 p.m. in Mumbai,
according to the central bank’s trading system. The rate is the
highest level for a 10-year security since Feb. 7. A basis point
is 0.01 percentage point.  The 10-year bond yield will likely stay between 8.30
percent and 8.35 percent through the end of June, Madhav said.  Seven of 25 economists surveyed by Bloomberg predicted the
50-basis point increase, while the rest expected a quarter-point
lift.  The cost of one-year interest-rate swaps, or derivative
contracts used to guard against fluctuations in borrowing costs,
gained 21 basis points, the most in nine months, to 8.08 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
