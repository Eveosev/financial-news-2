Philippine  government bonds  fell on
speculation the central bank will raise its benchmark interest
rate at a review this week.  Bonds dropped for a second day as economists in a Bloomberg
survey estimated inflation quickened to 4.4 percent in April
from a year earlier before official data due on May 5. The same
day, the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas will boost its overnight
borrowing rate by 0.25 percentage point to 4.50 percent,
according to 12 of 16 economists in a separate survey. One
forecast a 50-basis point increase and three predicted no
change. The peso snapped a four-day rally.  “There’s no reason to think that prices were softer in
April,” said Radhika Rao, a regional economist at Forecast Pte
in  Singapore , who predicted that inflation quickened to 4.5
percent last month. “That should support a 25-basis point hike
by the central bank.”  The yield on the 9.125 percent note due September 2016 rose
nine basis points to 5.185 percent, the highest since April 14,
according to Tradition Financial Services prices as of 4:54 p.m.  The peso fell 0.6 percent, the most since Feb. 22, to 42.90
per dollar, according to Tullett Prebon Plc.  The local units of Chevron Corp. and Royal Dutch Shell Plc
raised prices of some fuels today, ABS-CBN Corp. reported on its
website. The wage board in Manila will decide on a petition
seeking higher minimum pay on May 9, according to a
BusinessMirror report.  To contact the reporter for this story:
