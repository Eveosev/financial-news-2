Oil declined for a third day in  New
York , the longest losing streak since March, as rising U.S.
supplies and signs of slowing job growth stoked speculation fuel
demand may weaken in the world’s biggest crude consumer.  Futures dropped as much as 0.7 percent today after the
American Petroleum Institute said crude inventories climbed for
a fifth week. Stockpiles probably increased from the highest
since November, according to a Bloomberg News survey before an
Energy Department report today. Data this week may show the U.S.
generated fewer jobs in April than in March.  “We’re still continuing to see the builds” in
inventories, said  Jonathan Barratt , managing director of
Commodity Broking Services Pty in Sydney, who predicted oil will
average $100 this year. “The litmus test will be the employment
data due out on Friday.”  Crude for June delivery fell as much as 82 cents to $110.23
a barrel in electronic trading on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange . The contract was at $110.58 at 3 p.m. Singapore time.
Yesterday, it decreased $2.47, or 2.2 percent, to $111.05, the
biggest drop since April 18. Prices have advanced 34 percent in
the past year.  Brent crude  for June settlement on the London-based ICE
Futures Europe exchange slipped as much as 73 cents, or 0.6
percent, to $121.72 a barrel. Yesterday, the contract lost
$2.67, or 2.1 percent, to $122.45, the biggest drop since April
12.  U.S. Jobs  U.S. employment increased by 198,000 workers in April,
after a 201,000 gain in March, according to a Bloomberg News
survey of economists before a report today from ADP Employer
Services. Labor Department data on May 6 may show payrolls rose
by 185,000 workers last month after 216,000 a month earlier, a
separate poll showed.  Oil also declined as  China ’s central bank signaled more
tightening is possible as the country seeks to manage inflation,
the People’s Bank of China said in a monetary report published
yesterday. Concerns output may slow in the world’s second-
largest economy pushed Asian stock markets lower today.  A manufacturing index in China fell in April from March
after increases in bank reserve requirements and  interest rates .  “If this is the new trend it will certainly have an impact
on global oil demand as the emerging market world represents
about 80 percent of global oil demand growth,” Dominick Chirichella, a senior partner at the Energy Management Institute
in New York, said in a note yesterday.  Oil Supplies  U.S. crude inventories rose 2 million barrels in the week
to April 29 from 363.1 million, according to the median estimate
from 15 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg News. Gasoline stockpiles
are expected to have slipped 500,000 barrels from 205.6 million,
which would be an 11th weekly decline.  Yesterday, the industry-funded  American Petroleum Institute 
said crude stockpiles rose 3.2 million barrels and gasoline
supplies climbed 680,000 barrels.  The Energy Department will release its Weekly Petroleum
Status Report at 10:30 a.m. in  Washington .  Open interest in New York futures yesterday reached a
record for a second session. There were 1.63 million outstanding
contracts of light, sweet crude, surpassing a high of 1.608
million set on April 29, said Chris Grams, a spokesman for the
exchange. The previous record was 1.606 million on March 11.  Oil options volatility increased for a third day after the
death of al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden on May 1. Implied
volatility for at-the-money options expiring in June, a measure
of expected price swings in futures and a gauge of options
prices, was 28.9 percent today, up from 28 percent yesterday.  The killing of  bin Laden  by U.S. forces in  Pakistan  may
lead to retaliatory attacks by al-Qaeda supporters. Bin Laden
targeted oil facilities as a way to damage the U.S. and European
economies. Saudi Arabian forces foiled the biggest attempted
attack in 2006 on the Abqaiq oil-processing center, which
handles two-thirds of the kingdom’s supply.  To contact the reporter on this story:
