Royal Philips Electronics NV said Rudy Provoost is leaving as head of the lighting unit to join French
electrical equipment retailer  Rexel SA (RXL) , where he will succeed
Chief Executive Officer Jean-Charles Pauze next year.  Provoost, 51, will join Rexel’s management board in October
and will take the position of Pauze, 63, as chairman of the
panel when the company releases 2011 earnings in February 2012,
Paris-based Rexel said in a statement today.  The departure of the Provoost from Philips comes a month
after the Dutch maker of electronics came under the new
leadership of Frans van Houten. Provoost had led the lighting
unit three years, overseeing a division that is the world’s
largest in its field and had sales of 7.6 billion euros ($12.27
billion) in 2010. At Rexel, he will take the helm of a  company 
that sells switches, lighting, cables and climate control, with
12 billion euros of revenue last year and about 28,000 people.  Provoost’s “global experience in the electrical industry
will be a strong asset for Rexel,” the company said. Pauze, who
has been leading the company since 2002, “has committed to
remain at the disposal of the group through the end of 2012 to
ensure a smooth transition.”  Prior to taking over the lighting unit, Provoost had headed
the Amsterdam-based company’s consumer electronics division from
2004 to 2008. The Belgian national, who holds  degrees  in
psychology and business administration and management from the
University of Gent, started his career with  Procter & Gamble Co .
in 1984, and has held various positions at  Canon Inc. (7751)  and
 Whirlpool Corp. (WHR)  before joining Philips in 2000.  Pauze has expanded Rexel, the world’s largest distributor
of electrical equipment, through more than 30 acquisitions since
he joined the company as CEO in 2002. Deals included two major
purchases, that of GE Supply, renamed Gexpro in 2006, and most
of Hagemayer NV’s European activities in 2008.  To contact the reporter on this story:
