Ethanol futures were little changed in
 Chicago  as the fuel’s discount to gasoline buoyed demand.  The grain-based additive rose 0.2 percent on speculation
that the discount to gasoline, which exceeded 80 cents last
week, will spur refiners to blend more of the biofuel to pocket
the difference between the two and to take advantage of the 45-
cent tax credit provided for each gallon mixed in.  “From a demand standpoint, ethanol has very good
support,” said  Jason Ward , an analyst at Northstar Commodity
Investments Inc. in  Minneapolis . “It shouldn’t see less demand
at that spread.”  Denatured ethanol for May delivery rose 0.6 cent to $2.62 a
gallon on the Chicago Board of Trade. Prices are 64 percent
higher than a year ago.  In cash market trading ethanol in the U.S. Gulf slumped 2
cents, or 0.7 percent, to $2.755 a gallon and in  New York  the
additive decreased 2 cents, or 0.7 percent, to $2.73, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Ethanol in Chicago fell 2.5 cents, or 1 percent, to $2.62 a
gallon and on the West Coast the biofuel slipped 0.5 cent to
$2.755.  The additive’s discount to gasoline narrowed 2.45 cents to
70.94 cents today. The discount reached 86.68 cents on April 28,
the widest since July 22, 2008.  Gasoline for June delivery dropped 1.85 cents, or 0.6
percent, to settle at $3.3294 a gallon on the  New York
Mercantile Exchange . The contract includes reformulated
gasoline, made to be blended with ethanol before delivery to
filling stations.  Production of conventional gasoline blended with ethanol
averaged 4.83 million barrels a day in the week ended April 22,
3.9 percent higher than a year earlier, according to Energy
Department data.  Average ethanol mills in  Iowa  are losing 2 cents on every
gallon produced, while plants in  Illinois  are losing 3 cents
spot basis, according to Ag Trader Talk, an online grains
information service in Clive, Iowa.  To contact the reporter on this story:
