SeaEnergy Plc (SEA) , a Scottish renewable-
energy developer, will begin talks to sell most of its offshore
wind unit.  SeaEnergy granted a period of exclusivity to a group of
“major” European energy companies during which it intends to
negotiate a sale of its 80 percent stake in SeaEnergy Renewables
Ltd., the Aberdeen-based company said today in a statement.
Stephen Remp, the executive chairman of SeaEnergy, declined to
disclose further details when contacted by phone.  The unit has shares in three offshore wind projects being
developed off  Scotland  that have a total capacity of 3,125
megawatts, according to the statement. SeaEnergy owns 781
megawatts of those.  SeaEnergy expects to sign “formal documentation” in early
June and aims to complete the transaction at the end of that
month, subject to shareholder approval. One of the companies in
the group agreed to a loan to SeaEnergy that will be repaid by
proceeds of a sale, the company said.  SeaEnergy Renewables, through partnerships with utilities,
holds 25 percent stakes in the Beatrice demonstrator project in
the Outer Moray Firth, the Inch Cape park in the outer Firth of
Tay and the Moray Firth offshore wind project. The company,
founded in 2008, is a “leading force” for offshore wind, Remp
said. “But the time has come where somebody much bigger needs
to back it,” he said.  “We will be refocusing our attention on  SeaEnergy Marine 
and going very heavily into services for offshore marine,” Remp
said. SeaEnergy put the unit up for sale last June to develop
its marine service business.  To contact the reporter on this story:
