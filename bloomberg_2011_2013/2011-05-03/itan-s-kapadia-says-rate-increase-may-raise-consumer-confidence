K.F. Kapadia, executive vice-president
of finance at  Titan Industries Ltd. (TTAN) , comments on consumer
confidence and sales after the  Reserve Bank  of India today
raised the repurchase rate by half a percentage point to 7.25
percent. Only seven of 25 economists in a Bloomberg News survey
had predicted the move, while the remaining expected a  quarter-
point increase.  Kapadia spoke in a telephone interview.  “Our borrowings are negligible, so the direct impact on
our company would be negligible. But the overall macroeconomic
impact may be deflationary. It could result in bit of a cost
push as manufacturers and builders pass on the additional
interest cost to consumers.”  “The real impact from this would be in manufacturing. The
vast majority of manufacturing units exist on cash credit from
their bankers, so that’s straightaway going to impact them.”  On consumer demand and sales:  “Consumers are perhaps more impacted by inflation than by
 interest rates .”  “The big question is whether sales would slow down. If
sales don’t slow down, then profitability may only be minimally
impacted.”  “For sales, the key issue is consumer confidence. If
inflation is seen to be coming down, then consumer sentiment
will be positively impacted. This will have a positive impact on
consumer sales, which in turn will have a trickle-up effect on
capital goods sales.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
