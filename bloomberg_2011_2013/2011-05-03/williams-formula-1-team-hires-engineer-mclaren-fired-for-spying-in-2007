The Williams Formula One team is
hiring the car designer fired by championship rival McLaren in
2008 for spying as the team tries to get out of last place.  Mike Coughlan will join as chief engineer from Nascar’s
Michael Waltrip Racing in June, the Grove, England-based team
said. Williams said technical director Sam Michael and chief
aerodynamicist Jon Tomlinson will quit after 2011.  Williams, which failed to score a point in the first three
of this season’s 20 races, sold shares at 25 euros each in a 60
million-euro ($88.6 million) initial public offering. The shares
began trading on March 2 and lost almost one-third of their
value through April 18, the day after the last race in  China .
They rose 0.35 euro to 19.35 euros today in  Frankfurt .  Coughlan will be able to have an effect as soon as this
season, team chairman Adam Parr said.  “Having met him and talked to him, I was completely
certain he was the right man,” Parr said in a telephone
interview. “He’s learnt his lesson. It’s the kind of experience
that humbles and teaches us about things in life.”  Coughlan was fired by McLaren after police found 780 pages
of Ferrari documents at his home in July 2007. The team was
fined a record $100 million and kicked out of the 2007
constructors’ championship by Formula One ruling body Federation
Internationale de l’Automobile. Coughlan lost his job in 2008
and got a two-year ban from the sport.  Share Sale  The Williams team became the first listed Formula One team
when co-founders Frank Williams and Patrick Head sold part of
their stakes to shore up its future. Head is retiring after this
season and sold most of his 23.5 percent holding. Williams
retains a 50 percent stake.  The team, which won the last of its constructors’
championships in 1997, is sticking to a five-year plan that it
set out to prospective shareholders, Parr said. The next race is
the Turkish Grand Prix on May 8.  “The results so far have been disappointing and
negative,” Parr said. “I would ask the shareholders to judge
us not after five years but progressively.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
