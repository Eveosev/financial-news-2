Plant and machinery orders in  Germany ,
 Europe ’s largest economy, increased 18 percent in March from a
year earlier, the VDMA machine makers’ association said.  That’s down from growth rates of 38 percent in February and
46 percent in January. Both domestic orders and export orders
increased an annual 18 percent in March when adjusted for
inflation, the Frankfurt-based VDMA said in an e-mailed
statement today. In the first quarter, orders rose 32 percent
from the year-earlier period.  “As expected, we now see a normalization of growth
rates,” VDMA Chief Economist Ralph Wiechers said in the
statement. “The so-called base effect of extremely low figures
a year earlier is becoming less of an issue.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
