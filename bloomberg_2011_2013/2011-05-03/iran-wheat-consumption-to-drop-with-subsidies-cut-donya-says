Iran â€™s domestic wheat consumption is
expected to drop to 6.4 million tons in the current Iranian year
from 8.7 million the previous year, following a cut in subsidies
in December,  Donya-e-Eqtesad  reported, citing Deputy Commerce
Minister Hamid Alikhani.  The government paid some 40 trillion rials ($3.8 billion) a
year in bread subsidies, Alikhani said, according to the Tehran-
based newspaper. The start of a five-year plan to phase
subsidies including on wheat will increase competitiveness in
flour and bread production and reduce bread waste, he said.  Based on February 2010 figures, each Iranian consumes about
8.7 kilos of bread a month and some 104 kilos a year, he told
the newspaper.  To contact the reporter on this story:
