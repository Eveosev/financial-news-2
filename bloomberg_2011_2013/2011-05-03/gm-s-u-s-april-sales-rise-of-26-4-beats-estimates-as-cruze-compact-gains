General Motors Co. (GM) ’s U.S. deliveries
rose more than analysts’ estimated as increasing demand for
fuel-efficient models pushed the industry’s annual sales rate
above 13 million for the third straight month.  GM’s U.S. sales climbed 26 percent to 232,538 vehicles from
183,997 a year earlier, the Detroit-based automaker said today
in a statement. The gain topped the 14 percent increase
estimated on average by seven analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.
 Ford Motor Co. (F)  said its sales rose 13 percent to 189,778, and
 Toyota Motor Corp. (7203)  deliveries increased 1.3 percent to 159,540.  The U.S. auto sales rate in April was 13.2 million on a
seasonally adjusted annualized basis, topping the 13 million
pace that was the average estimate of 12 analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg. GM’s Chevrolet Cruze compact car set a record for
sales since its introduction last year, and Dearborn, Michigan-
based Ford’s Fiesta subcompact exceeded 9,000 deliveries for a
second consecutive month.  “Gas prices are the story,” Michelle Krebs, an analyst
for  Santa Monica , California-based Edmunds.com, said in a
telephone interview. “It looks like $4 a gallon is the magic
number to shift consumer behavior.”  Confidence among U.S. consumers rose more than forecast in
April, signaling that six straight months of job growth are
helping Americans endure the highest fuel prices in almost three
years. The average U.S. price of regular unleaded gasoline rose
37 percent in the past year to $3.97 a gallon yesterday,
according to AAA. The price peaked at $4.11 in July 2008.  ‘Vote of Confidence’  “This is a sort of vote of confidence for the recovery,”
said John Canally, an economist and investment strategist at
Boston-based LPL Financial Corp., which oversees $330.1 billion
in assets. “You have a better backdrop today than you had in
2008, when energy prices rose the way they are now. The economy
is early in the recovery rather than late and you have some
pent-up demand for autos.”  GM climbed 81 cents, or 2.5 percent, to $32.99 at 4:15 p.m.
in  New York  Stock Exchange composite trading. Ford fell 7 cents
to $15.38.  The rate for light-vehicle sales was 13.1 million in March
and 13.4 million in February, according to Autodata Corp. in
 Woodcliff Lake ,  New Jersey .  Ford’s 13 percent gain trailed the average estimate of
seven analysts surveyed by Bloomberg for a 14 percent increase.
Sales of the Focus compact car rose 22 percent to 17,265. F-
Series pickup sales rose 11 percent.  Nissan, Honda Sales  Nissan Motor Co.’s 12 percent sales gain trailed the 33
percent increase estimated on average by four analysts. The
Tokyo-based automaker today won a contract to supply New York’s
fleet of yellow taxi cabs. U.S. sales gained 9.8 percent at
Honda Motor Co., less than the 14 percent average estimate of
four analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  The increase in deliveries at Toyota, whose position as the
world’s largest automaker is under challenge by GM, trailed the
1.4 percent average estimate of four analysts.  Toyota’s Lexus, the top-selling luxury brand in the U.S.
for the last 11 years, trails Bayerische Motoren Werke AG’s
namesake brand and Daimler AG’s Mercedes-Benz by more than
6,000 vehicles through four months this year.  Mark Templin , head of U.S. Lexus sales, last month said the
brand doesn’t expect to retain its volume lead in the U.S. this
year because of supply disruptions following the March 11
earthquake. All but one Lexus model is made only in Japan.  ‘Japan’s Problems’  “We haven’t felt the biggest brunt yet of not having
enough cars in inventory due to Japan’s problems,” said  Jesse Toprak , vice president of industry trends at TrueCar.com in
Santa Monica,  California . “In May, we’re going to start seeing
this become more of an issue, and in June it’s going to become a
severe handicap for the industry.”  Less than two years after declaring bankruptcy, GM is
poised to reclaim the global auto sales lead from Toyota as the
March 11 earthquake in  Japan  disrupts supply, and reviews by
industry researchers such as  Consumer Reports  show the
automaker’s quality has slipped.  The Japan earthquake may result in “constraints” to
industry supply that will affect the industry selling rate in
the second and third quarters,  Don Johnson , GM’s vice president
of U.S. sales, said today on a conference call. The automaker
still predicts total sales for the year will be 13 million to
13.5 million, including medium- and heavy-duty trucks, as
inventory and sales may recover in the fourth quarter, he said.  Incentive Spending  GM lowered incentive spending by more than 10 percent, or
about $400 per vehicle in April from a month earlier, Johnson
told reporters yesterday in a conference call. Ford said its
discounts fell by more than double the industry average of $300,
 George Pipas , Ford’s sales analyst, said today on a conference
call.  Hyundai Motor Co. (005380) ,  South Korea ’s largest automaker, said
sales in April rose 40 percent from a year ago to 61,754
vehicles. Kia Motors Corp., Hyundai’s affiliate, reported a 57
percent U.S. sales increase. Combined, the Seoul-based corporate
partners sold a record 108,828 cars and light trucks last month.  Chrysler Group LLC, based in  Auburn Hills ,  Michigan , said
sales rose 22 percent to 117,225 vehicles. The results topped
the 18 percent average of five analysts’ estimates, as
deliveries of the Grand Cherokee sport-utility vehicle more than
doubled.  U.S. light-vehicle sales climbed to 11.6 million in 2010
from a 27-year low in 2009. Deliveries still were 31 percent
fewer than the 16.8 million annual average from 2000 to 2007,
according to Autodata. A 13 million light-vehicle sales rate
this month would be a 16 percent increase from the 11.2 million
pace in April 2010.  To contact the reporter on this story:
