The Mauritian economy is projected to
expand 4.1 percent in 2011, compared with growth of 4 percent
last year and 3 percent in 2009, the International Monetary Fund
said in a statement on its website.  “The central bank should closely monitor inflationary
pressures with a tightening bias to ensure that recent
inflationary pressures do not become engrained,” the IMF said
after its executive board concluded an Article IV consultation
with Mauritius.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
