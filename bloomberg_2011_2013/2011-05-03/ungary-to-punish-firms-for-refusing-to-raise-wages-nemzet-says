Hungary plans to punish private
companies failing to raise wages by less than the guideline set
each year in an agreement between employers, employees and the
government, Magyar Nemzet said, citing a ruling party member.  “Starting from next year we would use stricter
punishments,” Antal Rogan, head of Parliament’s Economy
Committee, told the newspaper. “Companies that fail to
implement the wage increase agreed by the Interest Conciliation
Council for low-income employees would not receive state orders
or state subsidies.”  Companies that raise the compensation of low- and medium-
income earners according to the agreement would pay less social-
security contributions, cutting budget revenue by around 10
billion forint ($56.6 million) a year, Rogan said, according to
the newspaper.  To contact the reporter on this story:
