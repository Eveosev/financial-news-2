OCI Co., Hanwha Chemical Corp. and
other South Korean chemicals companies declined in Seoul trading

Yeon Ju, an analyst at Daewoo Securities Co.  OCI, the world’s second-largest polysilicon maker, dropped
5.5 percent to 588,000 won as of 1:30 p.m. on the  Korea  Exchange
after hitting a record high of 640,000 won on April 29. Hanwha
Chemical fell 7 percent to 45,400 won after recording a record
high of 54,300 won on April 25. The 20-member Korea Energy &
Chemicals Index has advanced 32 percent this year, outperforming
a 7 percent rise in Korea’s benchmark Kospi stock index.   To contact the editor responsible for this story:
