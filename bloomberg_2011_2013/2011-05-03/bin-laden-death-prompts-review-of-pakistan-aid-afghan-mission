The death of Osama  bin Laden  prompted
immediate calls from U.S. lawmakers to re-evaluate the
relationship with Pakistan, where the al-Qaeda leader was found
and killed less than 35 miles from the capital, Islamabad.  Even as Secretary of State  Hillary Clinton  said the U.S. is
“committed to supporting the people and government” of
Pakistan, politicians and analysts raised questions about
support for the country and the need to maintain troop levels in
neighboring Afghanistan. The discovery of bin Laden’s hideaway
in Abbottabad, where Pakistan’s military academy is located and
many retired military officers live, is the latest event to
heighten U.S.-Pakistan tensions.  Pakistan’s foreign ministry issued a statement today saying
that the U.S. action that killed bin Laden was mounted without
the country’s knowledge and may undermine future cooperation.  CIA director Leon Panetta, in an  interview  with Time
magazine released today, said U.S. officials planning the raid
“decided that any effort to work with the Pakistanis could
jeopardize the mission” because “they might alert the
targets.”  Senator  Carl Levin , chairman of the Senate Armed Services
Committee, called for a “robust” reduction of U.S. troops in
Afghanistan this year and some hard questions for Pakistan.  ‘Lot of Questions’  “The Pakistani army and intelligence have a lot of
questions to answer, given the location, the length of time, and
the apparent fact that this was actually -- this facility was
actually built for bin Laden and its closeness to the central
location of the Pakistani army,” Levin, a Democrat from
 Michigan , said at a news conference.  Democratic Senator  John Kerry  of  Massachusetts , an
architect of a 2009 bill that tripled non-military aid to
Pakistan, committing $1.5 billion annually for five years,
called a new round of hearings to “assess the strategic
relationship” between the two countries and to examine how to
arrive at an “acceptable end-state” in  Afghanistan .  White House counterterrorism adviser John Brennan said
yesterday that members of Congress are “understandably”
raising questions about whether bin Laden got support from some
elements of the Pakistani government. “We are looking right now
at how he was able to hold out there for so long, and whether or
not there was any type of support system within Pakistan that
allowed him to stay there,” Brennan said.  Meeting in Pakistan  Mark Toner, a State Department spokesman, said that the
U.S. special representative to Afghanistan and Pakistan, Marc Grossman, was in meetings with Pakistani leaders scheduled
before bin Laden’s death. The U.S. “has raised questions indeed
and those questions are being asked,” Toner said.  The administration continues to view cooperation with
Pakistan as “vital” to counterterrorism efforts, he said.
“This has paid dividends and will continue to pay dividends.”  Afghanistan troop reductions are planned to begin in July,
with an unspecified number this year. The Obama administration,
which aims to have all troops out by 2014, has said repeatedly
that the drawdown will depend on conditions on the ground. Levin
is among lawmakers who are pressing President  Barack Obama  to do
more than make a “symbolic” withdrawal.  “There ought to be a significant reduction” of U.S.
troops, Levin said, to establish that Afghanistan’s security is
up to the Afghans.  Several lawmakers said yesterday that the U.S. expects
Pakistan to help defeat militants launching attacks on U.S.
troops in Afghanistan from its territory.  ‘Strings Attached’  “We clearly need to keep the pressure,” said Republican
Senator Susan Collins of  Maine , a member of the Armed Services
Committee. “One way to do that is to put more strings attached
to the tremendous amount of military aid that we give the
country.”  Obama’s 2012 budget proposes $1.2 billion in assistance for
Pakistan, largely to support counterinsurgency training for
troops posted along the border with Afghanistan.  The U.S.- Pakistan  relationship is “one of the most
fraught, complicated and difficult bilateral relationships
literally that exists in the world today,” said Richard Haass,
president of the  Council on Foreign Relations  and a former
director of policy planning at the State Department.  Levin said that lawmakers have long complained about the
Pakistani intelligence service not giving the U.S. information
about local terrorist networks, specifically the Haqqani network
allied with the Taliban, and allowing Pakistan to become the
“launching pad” for attacks on U.S. troops.  Pakistani intelligence either “looked the other way” or
“even worse” has been working with local militant groups to
create problems within Afghanistan, Levin said.  Drone Attacks  At the same time, Pakistanis have been angered by U.S.
aerial drone attacks aimed at militants that have mistakenly
killed civilians. The Jan. 27 shooting of two Pakistani men by
an American working for Central Intelligence Agency deepened
Pakistani anger.  A Pakistani diplomat said the fact that the U.S. did not
consult with or involve his country in the operation was no
reflection on ties between the two.  “In recent years, the cooperation between our governments,
militaries, and law enforcement agencies increased pressure on
al-Qaeda and the Taliban,” the diplomat said, speaking on the
condition he not be named, “and this progress must continue and
we are committed to our partnership.”  Salman Bashir, Pakistan’s foreign secretary, told reporters
in Islamabad today that it was “besides the point who did what
in this operation. The issue of  Osama bin Laden  is history, and
we should not remain mired in the past.”  Pakistani Cooperation  Christopher Davidson, a professor of Middle East politics
at Durham University in Durham,  England , said there was every
reason to doubt the extent of Pakistan’s cooperation.  “The bleak reality of all this is that the U.S. had to go
into this alone, probably staying a step ahead of the
Pakistanis,” Davidson said in a telephone interview. “The
likelihood is that some senior members of the Pakistani military
knew all along” where bin Laden was.  “The relationship between the U.S. and Pakistan can only
be more strained after this somewhat public shaming,” he said.  There are plenty of reasons for the U.S. to maintain its
relationship with Pakistan and not rush an Afghanistan
withdrawal, said  Marina Ottaway , director of the Middle East
Program at the  Carnegie Endowment for International Peace , a
Washington policy group.  “Bin Laden was only a small part of the issue,” Ottaway
said. “The Taliban has its rear bases in Pakistan. There are
all sorts of Islamist groups in the country. The tribal areas
are almost outside government control.”  Afghanistan War  In his May 1 announcement of bin Laden’s death, Obama said
that “going forward, it is essential that Pakistan continue to
join us in the fight against al-Qaeda and its affiliates.”
Brennan said yesterday that the administration also wants to
ensure that al-Qaeda can’t make Afghanistan into a home base
again.  The president will have some support for those goals from
Republicans and an independent.  Senator  Joe Lieberman , the Connecticut independent who
leads the Senate Homeland Security Committee, said the killing
of bin Laden gives the U.S. “an increased momentum in the war
in Afghanistan.” He cautioned against pulling out too early as
it could create another safe haven for the Taliban and al-Qaeda.  “Any decisions made about Afghanistan have to be made
based on the facts on the ground,” Lieberman said.  House Speaker  John Boehner , an Ohio Republican, said that
bin Laden’s death “makes our engagement in Afghanistan and
Pakistan more important, not less.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
