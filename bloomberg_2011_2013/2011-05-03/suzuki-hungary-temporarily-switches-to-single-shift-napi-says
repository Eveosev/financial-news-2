Suzuki Motors Corp.’s Hungarian unit
is temporarily switching to a single-shift work schedule because
of supply concerns,  Napi Gazdasag  reported, citing the company’s
communications director.  The change from the two-shift system is necessary to
maintain stocks until supply returns to normal after the
earthquake in  Japan , the newspaper cited Viktoria Ruska as
saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
