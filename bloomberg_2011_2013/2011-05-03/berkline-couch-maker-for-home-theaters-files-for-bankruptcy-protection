Berkline/BenchCraft Holdings LLC, a
unit of turnaround specialist Sun Capital Partners Inc., filed
for bankruptcy so the couch maker that specializes in home
theaters can liquidate.  After cutting cost, Berkline and its related companies
“have not been able to generate sufficient cash flows to meet
their continuing obligations,” Keith Cooper, the company’s
chief restructuring officer, said in court papers filed
yesterday in  U.S. Bankruptcy Court  in Wilmington.  Berkline made “feel-good massage chairs” and home theater
seats with motors to help users recline. The company blamed its
financial troubles on the housing crisis, which caused a drop in
sales.  Berkline has a $140 million, second-lien loan that is
mostly owed to its parent, SCSF Furniture LLC and other related
companies, according to court records. The parent, an affiliate
of Sun Capital, isn’t in bankruptcy.  In February, Berkline hired  FTI Consulting Inc. (FCN)  to help it
restructure and find a buyer. When Berkline was unable to sell
itself, the company decided to liquidate and file bankruptcy,
Cooper said in court papers.  The case is in re Berkline/BenchCraft Holdings LLC  11-11369, U.S. Bankruptcy Court, District of Delaware
(Wilmington).  To contact the reporter on this story:
