(Corrects to show guidance for the year was unchanged in
fourth paragraph. Story originally ran on May 3.)  First Solar Inc. (FSLR) , the world’s largest
maker of thin-film solar modules, fell after reporting first
quarter profit fell 33 percent.  First Solar was down $10.66, or 7.9 percent, to $124 a
share as of 5:21 p.m., after the close of regular trading on the
Nasdaq Stock Market.  First-quarter profit dropped 33 percent, less than analysts
expected, as higher production offset a decline in prices, the
Tempe, Arizona-based company said today in a statement. Slower-
than-expected sales during the quarter led to an increase in
First Solar’s inventory, said Chief Executive Officer Rob Gillette.  “Especially in  Italy , the market started out really slow
so there’s been some inventory build,” he said today on a
conference call with investors.  Net income declined to $116 million, or $1.33 a share, from
$172.3 million, or $2, a year earlier. The company was expected
to earn $1.13 a share, according to the average estimate of 28
analysts compiled by Bloomberg. Sales were little changed at
$567 million.  For the year, First Solar left unchanged its sales forecast
of $3.7 billion to $3.8 billion. It expects net income of $9.25
a share to $9.75 a share, unchanged from the company’s Feb. 24
estimates.  Production Costs  First Solar’s production costs were unchanged at 75 cents a
watt, the lowest in the industry. The company cut its costs by
11 percent last year by adding new manufacturing lines and
increasing the output of each panel. The modules now have an
efficiency rating of 11.7 percent, up from 11.1 percent a year
earlier. First Solar said it will be able to boost efficiency to
as much as 14 percent by 2014.  During the quarter, First Solar agreed to team with a
Chinese nuclear company to build the first, 30-megawatt phase of
a planned 1.5-gigawatt solar project in the city of Ordos in the
 China ’s Inner Mongolian desert. That month it also bought a
RayTracker Inc., a maker of solar tracking systems that increase
electricity production by tilting panels toward the sun as it
crosses the sky.  To contact the reporter on this story:
