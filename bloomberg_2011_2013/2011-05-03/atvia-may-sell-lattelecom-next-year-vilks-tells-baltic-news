Latvia may sell stakes in telephone
company Lattelecom SIA and mobile operator Latvijas Mobilais
Telefons SIA next year, Finance Minister Andris Vilks said,
according to the  Baltic News Service .  Swedish telephone company  TeliaSonera AB (TLSN) , a shareholder in
both companies, hasn’t offered a specific price to buy the
remaining stakes, Vilks said in an interview with the Riga-based
newswire.  The two Latvian companies may be sold next year after the
country’s credit ratings are increased, the economy recovers and
the government sells international bonds, Vilks told BNS.  To contact the reporter on this story:
