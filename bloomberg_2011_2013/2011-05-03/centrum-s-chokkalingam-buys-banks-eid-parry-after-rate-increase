 Chokkalingam G., chief investment
officer at Centrum Broking Pvt. Ltd., a Mumbai-based brokerage
that also manages assets for individuals, comments on the
outlook for  India ’s stock market.  The Bombay Stock Exchange Sensitive Index, or Sensex, lost
as much as 1.5 percent today after the  Reserve Bank  of India
lifted the repurchase rate to 7.25 percent from 6.75 percent.
Only seven of 25 economists in a Bloomberg News survey had
predicted the move, while the rest anticipated a quarter-point
increase. Chokkalingam spoke in a phone interview:  “It is a relative shock to us, as we were expecting an
increase of 25 basis points. The market always overreacts. The
punishment is always more than what fundamentals deserve.”  On his investment strategy:  “We are increasing our positions in the banking sector a
little, as they have corrected substantially today.  ‘‘Industry growth has corrected slightly because of the
high cost of funds. But definitely the banking industry doesn’t
get an adverse effect from the change in rates. Most of the
banks also have improved their non-performing assets. Still, the
tendency of the market is that as if it is the end of the
road.’’  Chokkalingam said they are buying stocks including  Indian
Bank (INBK) ;  Lakshmi Vilas Bank Ltd. (LVB)  and  EID Parry India Ltd. (EID) , a
fertilizer and sugar maker.  To contact the reporter on this story:
