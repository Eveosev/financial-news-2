Lawmakers in  Germany ’s 16 states back
the efforts of the federal parliament to secure influence over
the future financial arrangements of the European Stability
Mechanism, the  Handelsblatt newspaper  reported.  Senior state lawmakers from Chancellor  Angela Merkel ’s bloc
say Germany’s representative on the governing council of the
bail-out fund must reject any future ESM aid request unless it
has the backing of the lower house of the national parliament,
the newspaper said in a preview of report in tomorrow’s edition.  The newspaper cites a letter written by the state lawmakers
today. The states aren’t requesting the same direct legal rights
as sought by the federal parliament’s lawmakers in controlling
ESM bailouts, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
