Coffee exports from  Guatemala , the
largest producer in Central America, rose 8.7 percent in April,
according to the country’s National Coffee Association.  Shipments climbed to 447,265 bags of 60 kilograms (132
pounds) each from 411,357 bags a year earlier,  Anacafe , as the
association is known, said by e-mail yesterday.  Exports for the marketing season started Oct. 1 came to
1.881 million bags, down 0.7 percent from 1.895 million bags in
the previous season, data from the association showed.  Guatemala’s coffee production will reach 4 million bags in
the 2010-11 marketing season, the U.S. Department of Agriculture
estimates.  To contact the reporter on this story:
