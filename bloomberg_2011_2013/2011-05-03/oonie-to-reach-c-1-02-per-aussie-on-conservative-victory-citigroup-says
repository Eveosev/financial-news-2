The Canadian currency may strengthen
to C$1.02 per Australian dollar this week as “risk premium”
diminishes following the Conservatives’ majority victory in
yesterday’s election, according to Citigroup Inc.  The so-called loonie slid to the weakest since Feb. 2004
against  Australia ’s dollar on April 29 on speculation the  New
Democratic Party  would deny Prime Minister Stephen Harper’s
Conservatives a majority. Results today showed Harper’s party
was ahead or leading in 167 of 308 districts, ending seven years
of minority governments.  “Alongside the long-term Canadian dollar positives of this
result, there should be an important short-term benefit,” wrote
 Greg Anderson , a currency strategist at Citigroup Inc. in New
York. “When polls started to emerge on Thursday and Friday
showing the NDP with a possibility of winning the election, a
small risk premium began to emerge. That risk premium was most
evident on commodity crosses. With a clean, uncontested and
terrorism-free election, that event risk premium should also be
removed.”  The Canadian currency strengthened 0.3 percent to C$1.0370
per Australian dollar as of 11:43 a.m. in  London . The loonie
gained versus seven of its 16 most actively traded peers.  To contact the reporter on this story:
