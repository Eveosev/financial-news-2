Hochtief AG (HOT) ’s supervisory board is
open for a compromise with investor Actividades de Construccion
& Servicios SA over board seats,  Handelsblatt  said, citing
unidentified people close to the company.  ACS, which owns 43 percent of the German builder and wants
to increase to four the number of its board representatives, has
not named candidates, the newspaper said. The Spanish company
will probably have the majority of votes at Hochtief’s annual
shareholder meeting on May 12, Handelsblatt said.  While  TUI AG (TUI1)  CEO Michael Frenzel is willing to be a
candidate, the manager doesn’t want a contested vote, the
newspaper said. Candidates currently up for re-election include
former Hochtief CEO Hans-Peter Keitel as well as former CEOs
Wilhelm Simson of  E.ON AG (EOAN) , Heinrich von Pierer of  Siemens AG (SIE)  and
former  Allianz SE (ALV)  executive Detlev Bremkamp, Handelsblatt said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
