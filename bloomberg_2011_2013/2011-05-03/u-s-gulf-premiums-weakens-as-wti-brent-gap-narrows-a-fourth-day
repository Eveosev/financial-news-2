U.S. Gulf crude premiums to West  Texas 
Intermediate weakened as Brent oil’s spread versus the U.S.
benchmark shrank for the fourth consecutive day.  The gap between WTI and its European counterpart for June
delivery decreased 52 cents to $11.10 a barrel at 1:25 p.m. in
 New York . The differential for the contracts nearest to
expiration reached a record $15.94 on Feb. 16.  When Brent decreases versus WTI, it weakens the value of
low-sulfur U.S. grades that compete with West African imports
priced against the European grade.  Heavy Louisiana Sweet’s premium to WTI narrowed 10 cents to
$13.50 a barrel at 12:07 p.m. in New York, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. Light Louisiana Sweet slipped 30 cents to
$14.20 a barrel over WTI.  Among sour, or high-sulfur, grades, the premium for Mars
Blend weakened 45 cents to $5.90 a barrel. Poseidon fell 50
cents to $6.05 a barrel over WTI.  Southern Green Canyon’s premium was unchanged at $4.50 a
barrel. Thunder Horse’s premium shrank 30 cents to $10.30.  West Texas Sour’s discount narrowed 5 cents to $2.85 a
barrel. The grade has tracked more closely to its historical
average discount versus WTI because it’s delivered in Midland,
Texas, away from the  Gulf Coast  and close to Cushing,  Oklahoma ,
the delivery point for oil traded on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange .  The premium for Syncrude strengthened 25 cents to $10.25 a
barrel. Syncrude is a light, low-sulfur synthetic oil derived
from the  tar sands  in Alberta. The discount for Western Canada
Select widened 20 cents to $16 a barrel.  To contact the reporter on this story:
