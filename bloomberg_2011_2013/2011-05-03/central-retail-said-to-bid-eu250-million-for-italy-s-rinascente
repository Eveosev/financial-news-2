Central Retail Corp. Ltd.,   Thailand ’s
biggest shopping-mall operator, made a 250 million-euro ($370
million) bid for Italian department-store chain La Rinascente
Srl, according to two people familiar with the matter.  The offer comprised 205 million euros plus 45 million euros
for the retailer’s debt and was made ahead of a deadline that
expired yesterday, according to one of the people.  La Rinascente, which owns 13 department stores across
 Italy , was put up for sale this year by investors including
 Investitori Associati , an Italian private-equity firm which
holds a 46 percent stake. Deutsche Bank’s RREEF holds 30 percent
of the retailer, Italian real-estate company  Prelios SpA (PRS)  has 20
percent and Gruppo Borletti owns 4 percent.  Borletti said yesterday it wouldn’t submit a bid for La
Rinascente by the deadline because it has the right of first
refusal on the retailer as part of a shareholder agreement.
 UniCredit SpA (UCG) , Italy’s largest lender, is advising on the sale.  Chairman Maurizio Borletti, who is also an investor in
 France ’s Printemps, said in February that luxury companies
offered to help fund an acquisition of La Rinascente after they
heard of interest from Bangkok-based Central Retail.  A spokeswoman for Central Retail declined to comment. She
declined to be identified because of company policy.  The offer was reporter earlier today in Il Sole 24 Ore.  To contact the reporter on this story:
