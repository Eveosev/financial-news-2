CVC Capital Partners Ltd. confirmed it
has received a “friendly” and “very preliminary” approach
from an Exor,  News Corp. (NWSA)  group about its interest in buying
Formula One.  The group acknowledges that Formula One is privately owned
and “not currently for sale,” CVC said in an e-mailed
statement.  CVC “recognizes the quality of Exor and News Corporation
as potential investors, but any investment in Formula 1 will
require CVC’s agreement and will need to demonstrate that it is
in the interest of the sport and its stakeholders, taken as a
whole.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
