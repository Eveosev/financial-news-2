The  London  Metal Exchange warehousing
committee will meet two weeks earlier than its next scheduled
gathering to discuss a study on rules governing the withdrawal
of metal from warehouses.  The LME hired Europe Economics to examine rules about
taking metal from warehouses monitored by the exchange. Members,
warehouses and warehouse agents were asked for their views.  “We’ve received the draft report,” Miriam Heywood, a
spokeswoman for the LME in London, said today by phone. “The
warehouse committee meeting has been brought forward so that its
comments on the report can be presented to the board in June.”  The LME board is scheduled to meet on June 16, she said,
without giving the new date for the warehousing committee’s
meeting.  To contact the reporter on this story:
