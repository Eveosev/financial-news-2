German two-year government note yields
reached the highest in more than two weeks after a report showed
European producer-price inflation unexpectedly accelerated to
the fastest pace in 2 1/2 years in March.  Ten-year bunds pared an earlier decline. Factory-gate
prices in the euro region jumped 6.7 percent from a year
earlier, the biggest gain since September 2008, after a 6.6
percent increase in February, European Union statistics showed
today. Economists projected an increase of 6.6 percent in a
Bloomberg survey. Greek and Spanish two-year notes gained, while
those of  Portugal  were little changed.  “We may see the downside risks prevailing for bunds this
week,” said  David Schnautz , a fixed-income strategist at
Commerzbank AG in  London . “It’s only a matter of time before
the next rate hike from the ECB. The overall framework is still
rather bund-negative.”  The yield on the two-year note rose seven basis points to
1.88 percent as of 4:49 p.m. in London, the most since April 15.
The 1.5 percent security due March 2013 declined 0.125, or 1.25
euros per 1,000-euro ($1,481) face amount, to 99.31. The 10-year
bond yield rose three basis points to 3.27 percent.  German  government bonds  have handed investors a loss of 1.5
percent this year, according to indexes compiled by the European
Federation of Financial Analysts Societies and Bloomberg, while
Treasuries have returned 1.2 percent. Spanish securities made
2.6 percent while Portuguese debt lost 15.2 percent.  Inflation Expectations  The Greek two-year note yield decreased two basis points to
24.78 percent, while the yield on similar-maturity Portuguese
securities fell 22 basis points to 11.81 percent. Irish two-year
yields dropped 22 basis points to 11.81 percent.  Spanish 10-year bonds advanced for a fifth day. The
country’s Treasury said it aims to sell a maximum 4 billion
euros of five-year bonds at an auction on May 5. The 10-year
yield fell two basis points to 5.26 percent, while the two-year
note yield decreased five basis points to 3.31 percent.  Investors increased their expectations for German
inflation, with the 10-year breakeven rate, which anticipates
consumer-price growth in the next decade, climbing to the
highest in almost three weeks. The rate widened by three basis
points to 3.34 percentage points, the most since April 13.  ‘Return to Normality’  One of the ECB’s key challenges is to “formulate a return
to monetary policy normality,” new Bundesbank President Jens Weidmann said in a speech in  Frankfurt  yesterday after replacing
 Axel Weber  at the helm of  Germany ’s central bank. Crisis
measures “when administered as a long-term medication, can be
associated with considerable side effects,” he said.  ECB policy makers, who increased the benchmark rate by a
quarter point to 1.25 percent last month to contain inflation
that exceeded their 2 percent target, next convene on May 5 in
Helsinki. Some economists expect them to signal that another
move will come as soon as June.  Austrian bonds were little changed as the country sold 1.3
billion euros of bonds maturing in 20167 and 2026. The 2017
securities were priced to yield an average 3.14 percent while
the 15-year bonds yielded an average 3.92 percent. The 10-year
yield rose one basis point to 3.64 percent.  Fixed-income assets are facing a “major turning point”
that will push prices lower, according to Paul Duncombe, head of
multi-asset investment solutions at Schroders Plc.  “My favorite trade would just be to be short bonds,”
Duncombe said at the Euromoney Forex Forum in London today.
“We’ve had a 30-year  bull market  in bonds, we’ve got inflation,
rates can’t go any lower. I think it’s a turning point, a major
turning point.”  A short position is a bet that prices will fall. Schroders
has $308 billion under management, according to its website.  To contact the reporters on this story:
