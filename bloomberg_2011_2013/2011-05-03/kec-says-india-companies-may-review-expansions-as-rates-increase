Vardhan Dharkar, chief financial
officer at KEC International Ltd.,  India ’s second-largest maker
of power transmission towers, comments on the outlook for his
business after the rate increases by the central bank exceeded
analysts’ forecasts.  He spoke in a telephone interview from Mumbai today.  On Orders:  “New orders that power-project contractors will bid will
take higher interest outflow into account. Projects already
under execution will have to bear the extra interest costs. They
can’t be passed on.  ‘‘Power-generation companies will review expansion plans
closely. If there is a slowdown in investing in infrastructure
projects, that will definitely get reflected in the order flows
to contractors’’ including KEC, he said.  On interest-rate outlook:  ‘‘I think  interest rates  are near a peak. They may start
softening after six to eight months.’’  The  Reserve Bank  of India increased the repurchase rate to
7.25 percent from 6.75 percent. Only seven of 25 economists in a
Bloomberg News survey had predicted the move, while the rest
expected a quarter-point increase. The central bank boosted the
reverse repurchase rate to 6.25 percent from 5.75 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
