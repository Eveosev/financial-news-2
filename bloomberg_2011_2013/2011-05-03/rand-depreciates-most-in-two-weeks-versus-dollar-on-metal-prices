The rand depreciated the most against
the dollar in two weeks after commodity prices dropped for a
second day, damping demand for  South Africa ’s metal exports and
shares in the country’s mining companies.  The rand weakened as much as 1.3 percent to 6.6658 per
dollar, and traded 0.7 percent down at 6.6251 per dollar at 5
p.m. in Johannesburg, its biggest intraday decline since April
18. The South African currency slipped 0.5 percent to 9.8324 per
euro.  Copper dropped to a two-week low after data showed
manufacturing in  China  and the U.S. expanded at slower rates.
Gold, which along with platinum accounts for one-fifth of South
 Africa ’s exports, also fell. South Africa’s benchmark stock
index slid, led by mining companies including  Anglo American Plc (AGL) 
and  Impala Platinum Holdings Ltd. (IMP)   “The bias has shifted in favor of a weaker rand this
morning,”  Michael Keenan , a Johannesburg-based analyst at
Standard Bank Group Ltd., said in an e-mailed research note.
“Dollar weakness has abated, precious metals are softer and
 Wall Street  finished down yesterday.”  The rand’s decline comes after the currency advanced to
6.5437 per dollar yesterday, its strongest level since November
2007. Yesterday was a public holiday in South Africa, depressing
trading in the currency, Keenan wrote.  Bonds Advance  South African 10-year government bonds gained, driving the
yield to the lowest in more than three weeks, amid signs a weak
economic recovery may allow the central bank to hold borrowing
costs at a 30-year low this year.  The 6.75 percent securities due 2021 climbed 30 cents to
88.38 rand. The yield fell five basis points, or 0.05 percentage
point, to 8.46 percent, the lowest since April 8 on a closing
basis.  Money supply and credit growth in Africa’s biggest economy
unexpectedly slowed in March, the  Reserve Bank  said on April 29.
The purchasing managers’ index fell in April, Kagiso Securities
Ltd. said today, indicating a weak recovery in manufacturing,
while the jobless rate increased to 25 percent in the first
quarter, according to the Pretoria-based government statistics
agency.  Demand ‘Weak’  The data indicates that “domestic demand is still weak and
rate hikes are not an option at this juncture,” BNP Paribas
analysts led by London-based Paul Mortimer-Lee said in an e-
mailed research note before the bond auction. Lower  interest
rates  boost the returns of fixed-interest bonds relative to
cash.  The Reserve Bank today sold 1.3 billion rand ($196.3
million) of 8 percent securities maturing in 2018 at an average
yield of 8.38 percent at its weekly auction, the lowest yield
since the auction on Jan. 14. Investors bid for 1.91 times the
amount on offer, the Pretoria-based central bank said on its
Bloomberg page. The bank also auctioned 800 million rand of 10.5
percent notes due 2026 at an average yield of 8.67 percent, the
lowest since the auction on Feb. 18, with investors bidding for
4.09 times the amount on offer.  To contact the reporter on this story:
