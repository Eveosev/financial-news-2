Computer Sciences Corp. (CSC) , the provider
of computer services to companies and U.S. government agencies,
fell as much as 9.8 percent in early trading after saying full-
year sales and profit probably missed its forecasts.  Profit for the year through March probably was $4.75 a
share, the  Falls Church , Virginia-based company said yesterday.
In February, it forecast earnings of $5.20 a share. Sales
probably were $16.1 billion, compared with a previous forecast
of $16.2 billion.  Computer Sciences declined as much as $4.95 to $45.60 in
trading before U.S. exchanges opened, after falling 43 cents to
$50.55 yesterday in New York Stock Exchange composite trading.
The shares had climbed 1.9 percent this year before today.  The company said it plans to report full-year earnings on
May 25.  To contact the reporter on this story:
