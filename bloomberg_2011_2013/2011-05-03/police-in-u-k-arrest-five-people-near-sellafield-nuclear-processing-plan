Police arrested five people near
Sellafield Ltd.’s nuclear reprocessing site in Cumbria,  England ,
on suspicion of terrorism.  Officers specializing in nuclear security stopped a vehicle
close to the Sellafield site at 4:32 p.m. yesterday, according
to a statement on Cumbria Constabulary’s  website . The search
resulted in the arrests of five men from  London  under Section 41
of the U.K.’s Terrorism Act, police said.  The Sellafield plant is Britain’s primary center for
processing spent nuclear fuel and other cleanup work for the
U.K. Nuclear Decommissioning Authority. The company was told of
the arrests, and traffic to the site may be disrupted while the
investigation proceeds, Andrew Pearson, a spokesman at the site
in northern England, said today by telephone.  The U.K. is on “severe” alert for terrorism, and
government leaders around the world predicted retaliation after
U.S. commandos killed al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden in a May 1
raid in  Pakistan .  The U.K. probe is being led by the North West Counter
Terrorism Unit, part of Greater Manchester Police. “At this
stage we are not aware of any connection to recent events in
Pakistan,” the Manchester unit said in a separate statement
sent by e-mail.  The suspects, all in their 20s, were taken to police
custody in Carlisle overnight and are being transported to
Manchester, it said. BBC News reported on its website that the
men were Bangladeshi and were thought to have been filming. The
arrests were not a result of a long running investigation, the
broadcaster said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
