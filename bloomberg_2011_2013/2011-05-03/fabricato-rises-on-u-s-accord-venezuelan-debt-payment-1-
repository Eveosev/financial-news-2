Textiles Fabricato Tejicondor SA (FABRI) ,
 Colombia ’s biggest textile maker, advanced for a second day to
the highest in almost four years on speculation the company will
benefit from a free-trade agreement with the U.S. and Venezuelan
payments of overdue debt.  Fabricato rose 2.9 percent to 46.7 pesos in Bogota trading
at 4 p.m. New York time. It was the stock’s highest closing
price since September 2007.  To contact the reporter on this story:
