Czech stocks fell, with the benchmark
PX Index dropping the most in more than two weeks, as declining
oil prices dragged down  Unipetrol AS (UNIP)  and concern deepened
central banks may have to increase  interest rates  to curb
inflation.  The PX gauge of 15 companies lost 1 percent, its biggest
one-day slump since April 18, to 1,262.8 at the 4:28 p.m. close
in Prague. Unipetrol, the largest Czech oil refiner, slid 2.2
percent to 193.7 koruna, the most in three months, as oil
declined for a second day.  Stocks in emerging markets retreated after India raised
interest rates more more than analysts forecast and predicted
inflation will stay at an “elevated level” until September.
Investors pared riskier assets amid concern the May 1 killing of
 Osama bin Laden  by U.S. forces in Pakistan will inspire reprisal
attacks.  Unipetrol’s 7 percent rally in the previous five sessions
drove up its 14-day relative strength index to 76.6 yesterday.
Readings higher than 70 suggest to some technical analysts a
security may decline.  Austria’s  Erste Group Bank AG (EBS)  declined 1.4 percent to 831.1
koruna, ending a two-day advance, and  CEZ AS (CEZ) , the biggest Czech
power utility, retreated 1 percent, the most since April 18, to
936 koruna.  To contact the reporter on this story:
