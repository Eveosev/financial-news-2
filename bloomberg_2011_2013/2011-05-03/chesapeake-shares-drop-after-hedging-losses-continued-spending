Chesapeake Energy Corp. (CHK) , the most
active U.S. natural-gas driller, fell 5.7 percent after it
reported a $205 million loss for the first quarter.  The shares fell $1.90 to $31.33 at 4:05 p.m. in composite
trading on the New York Stock Exchange, the biggest percentage
drop since February 2010. Chesapeake earlier declined as much as
7.4 percent in intraday trading.  Chesapeake said revenue fell 42 percent to $1.6 billion
from $2.8 billion during the first three months of 2011 as gas
prices declined by 16 percent and hedging losses offset rising
oil and gas production. The company said it lost $725 million
associated with energy hedging contracts used to lock in oil and
 gas prices .  “We made $7 billion in cash hedging in the past 10 years,
so hopefully we can make that much more in the next 10 years,”
Chesapeake CEO Aubrey McClendon said in a conference call today.  The company is on track to meet its goal of reducing debt
by 25 percent this year and increasing production, McClendon
said.  Chesapeake spent $883 million to buy oil-and-gas leases
during the quarter, according to a company statement yesterday.  Eric Hagen, an analyst at Lazard Capital partners, said the
company is sending “mixed signals on capital discipline.”  Chesapeake said it plans to recoup those costs by selling
future production, “but in the interim, the balance sheet
remains strained,” wrote Hagen, who rates Chesapeake’s shares a
“sell.”  -- Editors: Susan Warren, Charles Siler  To contact the reporter on this story:
