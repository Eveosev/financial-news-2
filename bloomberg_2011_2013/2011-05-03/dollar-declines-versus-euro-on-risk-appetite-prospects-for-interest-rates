The Swiss franc rose against all of
its 16 major counterparts, reaching a record versus the dollar,
as declines in stocks and commodities damped demand for higher-
yielding assets.  The dollar erased earlier gains versus the euro amid
concern the  Federal Reserve  will trail the  European Central Bank 
in raising interest rates.  Canada ’s dollar fluctuated after
rising earlier as Prime Minister Stephen Harper’s Conservatives
won a majority in Parliament for the first time, and the
Australian and  New Zealand  dollars fell for a second day.  “To some degree it’s a risk-off environment, and that’s
keeping a pretty good footing on the Swiss,” said  Mary Nicola ,
a currency strategist at BNP Paribas SA in New York. “We’re
expecting dollar weakness to resume.”  The Swiss franc gained 0.5 percent to 86.13 centimes per
dollar at 5 p.m. in New York. It touched 85.96 centimes, the
strongest level on record, extending this year’s gain versus the
greenback to 8.6 percent. The franc strengthened 0.5 percent to
1.2770 per euro.  The dollar was little changed at $1.4825 per euro, after
rising 0.5 percent and falling 0.4 percent. It touched $1.4902
yesterday, the weakest level since December 2009. The yen, which
rose against all major peers except the franc, strengthened 0.4
percent to 80.94 per dollar, from 81.23 yesterday. It gained 0.4
percent to 119.99 per euro, from 120.45.  Stocks, Commodities  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index dropped as much as 0.9
percent, and the Thomson Reuters/Jefferies CRB Index of raw
materials fell as much as 1.1 percent, the biggest intraday drop
since April 18. Crude oil for June delivery tumbled 2.3 percent
to $110.88 a barrel in New York.  Australia ’s dollar slid 0.9 percent to $1.0845 after rising
to $1.1012 yesterday, the strongest level since its free float
in 1983. New Zealand’s dollar, nicknamed the kiwi, weakened 1
percent to 79.87 U.S. cents. Commodities make up a majority of
exports for the two South Pacific nations.  The Aussie remained lower after the  Reserve Bank  of
Australia left the overnight cash rate target at 4.75 percent at
a policy meeting. The central bank’s decision was forecast by 21
of 22 economists surveyed by Bloomberg News.  The Canadian dollar fell 0.2 percent to 95.26 U.S. cents as
oil, the nation’s biggest export, slid. The currency gained 0.5
percent earlier as Harper won a majority of seats in Parliament,
giving him a mandate to fund corporate and personal income tax
cuts with curbs on spending.  The ECB, which meets May 5, raised its benchmark interest
rate to 1.25 percent on April 7 from a record-low 1 percent.
Some economists expect it to signal another move will come as
soon as June.  Fed Stimulus  Fed Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said after a policy meeting
last week he was unsure when the U.S. central bank’s monetary
stimulus will unwind. The benchmark U.S. rate has been zero to
0.25 percent since December 2008 to support the economy. The
Fed’s program to spur growth by purchasing $600 billion in
Treasuries will end in June, as planned, policy makers decided.  The U.S. currency, which has fallen 9.7 percent versus the
euro this year, will weaken further as the Fed keeps monetary
policy loose, and the end of its bond-purchase program won’t be
enough to lift the currency, according to Aviva Investors.  The dollar “probably has room” to decline to $1.60, a
level that previously made European policy makers uncomfortable,
said Pierre Lequeux, London-based head of currency management at
Aviva, which oversees about $370 billion. The euro is being
supported by emerging economies that continue to diversify their
assets away from the dollar, he said.  ‘Fundamental Flaws’  “It still makes sense to short the dollar against the
euro,” Lequeux said in an interview at a Euromoney conference
in  London . “The  U.S. economy  seems to have fundamental flaws.”
Shorting a currency is betting it will fall.  U.S. job growth slowed in April to 185,000 positions, from
216,000 in March, economists in a Bloomberg survey forecast
before the U.S. reports the data May 6. The nation’s economy
grew at a 1.8 percent annual rate in the first quarter, versus
3.1 percent in the fourth, the government said last week.  The pound was the worst performer today among major
currencies, dropping as a measure of U.K. manufacturing growth
declined. Markit Economics and the Chartered Institute of
Purchasing and Supply index decreased to 54.6 in April, from
56.7 in March.  Sterling weakened 1 percent to 89.92 pence per euro and
touched 90.07, the weakest since March 29, 2010. It slid 1
percent to $1.6487.  ‘Massive’ Challenges  Bank of England  Governor  Mervyn King  said high debt levels
pose “massive” economic challenges that would be exacerbated
by increased long-term  interest rates . The British central bank
also meets on May 5.  Bank officials are split four ways over monetary policy.
The BOE probably will leave the key interest rate at a record-
low 0.5 percent at this week’s meeting, according to a Bloomberg
News survey.  “The market continues to price out the chance of a rate
hike before the end of August,” said  Stephen Gallo , head of
market analysis at Schneider Foreign Exchange in London. The
delay in a rate boost will cause a “selloff in the pound.”  The yen and the franc gained today amid concern that
reprisal attacks would follow the death of  Osama bin Laden .
Interpol told its 188 member countries to be on alert following
the killing of the al-Qaeda leader in  Pakistan .  The Swiss franc rose the most over the past week among the
10 developed-nation currencies in the Bloomberg Correlation-
Weighted Currency Indexes, gaining 1.2 percent. The euro rose
0.8 percent, while the dollar fell 0.6 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
