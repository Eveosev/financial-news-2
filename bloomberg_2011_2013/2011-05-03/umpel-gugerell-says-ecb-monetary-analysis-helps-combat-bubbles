European Central Bank Executive Board
member Gertrude Tumpel-Gugerell said that the bank’s practice of
analyzing money and credit growth helps prevent the formation of
asset-price bubbles.  “Work at the ECB shows that the leaning-against-the-wind
attitude embedded in the ECB’s monetary analysis has contributed
to containing the build-up of financial imbalances prior to the
financial crisis,” Tumpel-Gugerell said in Vienna today in a
speech titled “Asset-Price Bubbles: How They Build Up and How
to Prevent Them.” This “prevented a more significant fall out
in economic activity during the crisis and larger risks to
 price stability ,” she said.  “A cautious leaning against excessive money and credit
growth and building financial imbalances as part of the monetary
pillar can bring benefits not only for financial stability but
also for price stability.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
