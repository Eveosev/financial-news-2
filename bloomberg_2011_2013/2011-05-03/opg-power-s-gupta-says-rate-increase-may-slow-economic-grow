Arvind Gupta, managing director of  OPG
Power Ventures Plc (OPG) , an operator of electricity plants in India,
comments on outlook for economic growth after the  Reserve Bank 
of India today raised the repurchase rate to 7.25 percent and
the reverse repurchase rate to 6.25 percent. He spoke in an
telephone interview from Chennai.  “It will definitely hurt the pace of growth and
development of industrial growth because the banks’
profitability will be hit and new projects will suffer. New
lending will be a problem and expansion plans will get
deferred.”  “This policy is not going to have any impact on OPG. All
our current plans are fully funded.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
