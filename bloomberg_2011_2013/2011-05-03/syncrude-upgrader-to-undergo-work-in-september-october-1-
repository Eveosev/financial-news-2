The Syncrude upgrader near Fort
McMurray,  Alberta , will undergo six weeks of maintenance in
September and October,  Suncor Energy Inc. (SU) , a member of the  joint
venture  that owns the plant, said in a  statement .  Suncor has advanced some work that was originally planned
for later this year at another unit, Upgrader 2, to take place
during six weeks of work scheduled for the second quarter, the
company said. The upgrader is also near Fort McMurray.  Suncor has scheduled two weeks of planned maintenance on
equipment at the Firebag mining site in September and two weeks
near the end of the third quarter at its MacKay mining site, the
company said. The two work periods will overlap.  Terra Nova, a production field about 218 miles (350
kilometers) off the coast of Newfoundland and Labrador, will
undergo four weeks of maintenance during the third quarter. A
15-week dockside maintenance program originally scheduled for
this year is expected to be delayed until 2012.  The White Rose production field, about 218 miles (350
kilometers) east of  St. Johnâ€™s  has 16 days of planned work
scheduled for July of this year, and the work may be reduced in
duration, according to the statement.  The Buzzard field, in the Central North Sea, is expected to
undergo maintenance in the third quarter of this year, according
to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
