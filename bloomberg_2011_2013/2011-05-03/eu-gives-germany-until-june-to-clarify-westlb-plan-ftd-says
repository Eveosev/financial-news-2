The European Union has set a June
deadline for  Germany  to clarify its plans for restructuring
state-controlled lender WestLB AG, the  Financial Times
Deutschland  reported, citing the European Commission.  EU Competition Commissioner  Joaquin Almunia  welcomes the
plan of Dusseldorf-based WestLB’s owners to form a group bank
for savings banks in the state of North-Rhine Westfalia but
requires further details, the newspaper said, citing a letter
sent by the commissioner to the Federal Finance Ministry in
Berlin.  The EU will order WestLB’s owners to return bailout aid of
3.4 billion euros ($5 billion) unless adequate information is
supplied by June, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
