Korean Air  Lines Co., the country’s
largest carrier, will purchase seven new planes after it posted
a 49 percent increase in quarterly profit as earnings from
affiliates and a stronger won offset higher fuel costs.  The airline will buy two Boeing Co.  777-300ER  aircraft and
five Airbus  SAS A330-200 s, Seoul-based Korean Air said today in
a regulatory filing. The planes have a list price of about $1.57
billion and will be delivered from 2013 to 2015, it said.  Korean Air plans to increase revenue from premium class
passengers as it takes delivery of its first A380 aircraft this
month. The carrier joins Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd. and Asiana
Airlines Inc., South Korea’s No. 2 carrier, in ordering new
aircraft this year to meet rising travel demand in the region.  The airline’s net income climbed 49 percent to 282.1
billion won ($264 million) in the three months to March 31, from
a restated 188.7 billion won a year earlier, it said in the
regulatory filing, based on consolidated figures. Sales rose 7.2
percent to 2.82 trillion won.  The airline, due to receive five A380s this year, fell 0.7
percent to close at 69,300 won in Seoul trading, compared with a
1.3 percent decline for  South Korea ’s benchmark Kospi index. The
carrier has dropped 0.4 percent this year.  Earnings from affiliates jumped more than nine-fold to
137.6 billion won, the carrier said without elaboration. Korean
Air also booked currency gains of 204.6 billion won after the
won’s 3.5 percent gain against the dollar pared the repatriated
value of its U.S. currency-denominated debt.  Computer Chips  Operating profit fell 41 percent to 162.9 billion won
following a 30 percent jump in average fuel costs. Cargo traffic
dropped 1.6 percent because of weaker demand for computer chips,
flat-screen televisions and displays, the airline said.
International passenger traffic rose 3 percent, led by demand in
the U.S. and  China .  The carrier said it expects freight demand to rebound from
the current quarter, partly because customers are turning to
other suppliers following production disruptions caused by the
March 11 earthquake and tsunami in  Japan .  Korean Air owns stakes in Hanjin Shipping Holdings Co.,
parent of South Korea’s largest shipping line, and Korea Airport
Service Co., besides having an air-cargo venture in China.  The carrier reported results using Korean International
Financial Reporting Standards for the first time as part of a
nationwide switch away from the country’s generally accepted
accounting principles system.  To contact the reporters on this story:
