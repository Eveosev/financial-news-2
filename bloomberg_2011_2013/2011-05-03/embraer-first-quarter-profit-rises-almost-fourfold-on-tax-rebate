Embraer SA (EMBR3) , the world’s fourth-largest
planemaker, gained the most in 15 weeks in Sao Paulo after
first-quarter profit rose almost fourfold, showing the company
is weathering a strengthening currency.  The stock advanced 6.4 percent to 13.24 reais at the 4:15
p.m. New York time close, the most since Jan. 14. It was the
largest advance on  Brazil ’s benchmark Bovespa index, which
slipped 1.8 percent.  Net income increased to 174.3 million reais ($110.2
million) from 44.1 million reais a year earlier, the  Sao Jose
dos Campos , Brazil-based company said yesterday in a regulatory
filing. The margin on earnings before interest and taxes rose to
8.9 percent, beating the company’s 2011 projection of 7.5
percent and the margin of 7.1 percent reported in the first
quarter of 2010.  “The highlight for the quarter was profitability, which
improved considerably,” Rodrigo Goes, a Sao Paulo-based analyst
at Banco BTG Pactual SA who recommends buying the shares, wrote
in a note to clients today. “However, it is a matter of time
before foreign exchange headwinds start to have a more
noticeable drag effect on profitability.”  The real strengthened 0.2 percent to 1.5863 per dollar
today, adding to a 46 percent rally since the end of 2008.  Sales fell 1.5 percent to 1.76 billion reais, and the
company received a tax benefit of 4.2 million reais after
posting an expense of 88.1 million reais a year earlier,
according to the earnings statement. Commercial aviation
accounted for 71 percent of revenue in the quarter, up from 62
percent last year.  The planemaker said last month it delivered 28 aircraft in
the first quarter, and that its backlog was at $16 billion.  To contact the reporters on this story:
