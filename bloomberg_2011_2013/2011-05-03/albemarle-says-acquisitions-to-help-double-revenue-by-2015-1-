Albemarle Corp. (ALB) , the world’s largest
maker of oil-refinery catalysts, said mergers and acquisitions
will add $1 billion to $1.2 billion to annual sales through
2015, helping the company double revenue.  Albemarle may spend more than $2 billion on acquisitions
over five years, the  Baton Rouge , Louisiana-based company said
in  presentation  slides posted today on its website. Earnings per
share will rise to $8.40 to $9.75 with the targeted amount of
acquisitions, or $6.75 to $7.75 if none are completed, from
$3.56 last year, the company said.  “This is not a pipe dream,” Chief Executive Officer Mark Rohr said in the presentation in  New York , which was broadcast
on the Internet. “These are real numbers up here.”  Albemarle plans to increase revenue from $2.4 billion last
year to about $5 billion in 2015. Sales from existing businesses
will climb 10 percent to 13 percent a year and the remainder of
the growth will come from acquisitions, Albemarle said in the
presentation. A commercial plant for making  lithium carbonate ,
used in batteries, will start by 2013, the company said.  Earnings in 2015 are estimated to be $7.26 a share,
according to the average estimate of three analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
