Gruner + Jahr AG may sell its 37.45
percent stake in Prinovis, a printing business, to joint-venture
partner Arvato AG,  Handelsblatt  reported, citing unidentified
people close to the company.  The companies haven’t yet reached agreement on price, the
newspaper said. Bertelsmann AG, which owns both Gruner + Jahr
and Arvato, wants Gruner + Jahr to sell the stake so that
Arvato, which has a holding of similar size, can consolidate
Prinovis in its books, Handelsblatt said.  Prinovis generates more than 300 million euros ($445
million) of revenue a year and earned a “mid-one-digit”
percentage return on sales in 2010, Handelsblatt said.  Axel
Springer AG (SPR)  owns the remaining 25.1 percent, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
