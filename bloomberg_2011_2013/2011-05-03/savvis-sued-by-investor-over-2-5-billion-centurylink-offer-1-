Savvis Inc., which provides online
business data storage, was sued in Delaware Chancery Court by an
investor who contends a $2.5 billion cash-and-stock buyout offer
from phone company  CenturyLink Inc. (CTL)  is inadequate.  Stockholder Hilary Kramer claims Savvis directors violated
their duties by failing to get the best possible price and seeks
an injunction to stop the deal, according to a complaint filed
yesterday in Wilmington.  “Defendants failed to explore strategic alternatives to a
buyout notwithstanding Savvis’ bright prospects for growth and
profitability” in advanced “cloud” computer-data hosting
services, Kramer said in the filing.  Town & Country, Missouri-based Savvis, 18 percent owned by
the Welsh Carson Anderson & Stowe venture capital firm of  New
York , reported $933 million in revenue last year.  Savvis and Monroe, Louisiana-based CenturyLink announced
the buyout agreement April 27, with Savvis stockholders to
receive $30 in cash and $10 in CenturyLink shares for each of
their shares, an 11 percent premium at the time.  Savvis rose 2 cents to $39.29 at 9:41 a.m. New York time in
Nasdaq Stock Market trading. The stock has risen more than 50
percent this year.  Matt Benson, a spokesman for Savvis in  San Francisco ,
didn’t immediately return phone and e-mail messages seeking
comment on the lawsuit.  The case is Hilary Kramer v. James E. Ousley and  Savvis
Inc. (SVVS) , CA6438, Delaware Chancery Court (Wilmington).  To contact the reporter on this story:
