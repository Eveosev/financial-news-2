The U.K. government is focusing on
nuclear power and opposes extending European Union renewable
energy goals beyond a target for 2020,  Handelsblatt  said, citing
unidentified people close to the European Commission.  Individual member states have set different priorities in
their national energy strategies, making it difficult for
European Energy CommissionerGuenther Oettinger to bind
countries to uniform goals, the German newspaper reported.  Germany , which plans to exit nuclear power, should push for
the integration of  Europe â€™s electricity grid, Handelsblatt said,
citing unidentified people close to Oettinger. EU energy
ministers will meet near Budapest today, according to the
newspaper.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
