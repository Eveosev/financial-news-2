Cotton futures rose for the second
time in three sessions as adverse weather threatened crops in
the U.S., the world’s biggest exporter.  Orange juice  also
gained.  Parts of  Texas , the largest cotton-growing state, are in
extreme drought, according to the U.S. Drought Monitor in
Lincoln, Nebraska. More than half of the country, from Minnesota
to  New York , has an above-average risk of flooding this spring,
according to the  National Weather Service .  “It’s time to move into an optimal planting period, and
the Texas conditions are too dry, while many other states are
too wet,” said  Mike Stevens , an independent trader in
Mandeville, Louisiana. “That lends the market some support.”  Cotton for July delivery climbed 3.06 cents, or 2 percent,
to settle at $1.5751 a pound at 2:47 p.m. on ICE Futures U.S. in
New York. The price has gained 89 percent in the past 12 months.  Last month, the fiber tumbled 21 percent as demand eased in
 China , the leading consumer, following a price rally to a record
$2.197 in March.  Orange-juice futures for July delivery climbed 3.3 cents,
or 1.9 percent, to $1.729 a pound, capping the fifth straight
gain.  To contact the reporters on this story:
