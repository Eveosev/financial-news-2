Sameer Africa Ltd. (SAME) , a Nairobi-based
tiremaker, ordered Bridgestone Corp. tires from  Thailand  after
an earthquake and tsunami disrupted operations at Japanese auto-
parts factories,  Business Daily  reported.  Bridgestone tires account for about 10 percent of Sameerâ€™s
sales volume, while the rest of its products are manufactured
domestically under the Yana brand, the Nairobi-based newspaper
said today, citing Sameer Chief Executive Officer Michael
Karanja.  Sameer supplies tires to 10 African nations, Business Daily
said. The company will "adjust" prices this year to reflect the
rising cost of synthetic and natural rubber, and it plans to
reduce operating expenses, the newspaper cited Karanja as
saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
