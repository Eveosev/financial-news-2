Kenya will digitize records in four
government departments by next month as part of a program to
reduce corruption in the East African country, the Information
and Communications Ministry said.  The departments include the judiciary, the state-law,
motor-vehicle registration and lands offices, Bitange Ndemo,
permanent secretary in the ministry, told reporters today in
Nairobi, the capital.  “If all the information is online you don’t have to bribe
anyone” to get it, Harry Mwangi, project manager for the so-
called shared-services program, said in a phone interview.  Kenya announced plans to digitize government records in
April 2010 as part of an effort to curb graft. The country
dropped 11 places from a year earlier to 159th out of 178
countries listed on the 2010  Corruption Perceptions Index 
compiled by  Transparency International , the Berlin-based
advocacy group.  To contact the reporter on this story:
