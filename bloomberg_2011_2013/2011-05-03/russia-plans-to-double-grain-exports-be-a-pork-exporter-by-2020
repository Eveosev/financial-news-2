Russia  expects to double grain exports
by 2020 and will be producing enough pork and poultry to be a
net exporter of both meats, a government official said.  Annual grain shipments will total 40 million to 45 million
metric tons, compared with about 20 million now, Sergey Korolev,
the first deputy minister in the Agriculture Ministry, said
today at a food conference in New York. The increase will
require a jump in cultivated land of about 5 million hectares
(12.4 million acres), he said.  Russia expects to export 400,000 tons of poultry by 2020,
compared with imports of 350,000 tons now, Korolev said. As
recently as 2006, the country was importing 1.5 million tons. In
the last five years, Russia has invested in more than 400
facilities for poultry farms, he said.  “Our priority task is to substitute these imports by
domestic production,” Korolev said. “We are interested to
increase the import of investment in Russia, rather than the
import of food.”  Pork-meat imports are now 500,000 tons a year, he said. By
2020, the country will be exporting about 200,000 tons, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
