Maple Energy Plc (MPLE) , a Lima-based oil and
natural-gas producer, expects costs at an ethanol project under
construction in northwest Peru to be higher than an earlier
forecast.  Maple said in a statement the plant will be able to produce
ethanol for about $1.42 a gallon, compared with a March 2010
estimate of $1.28, citing rising prices for fertilizer to
produce sugar cane and higher diesel fuel costs, which it uses
to transport ethanol. It did not say how much fuel the factory
will be able to make when it goes into production in the fourth
quarter  Most of the initial shipments will be to the Netherlands,
Maple said today. Peru has trade agreements with the U.S. and
the European Union that permit duty-free ethanol exports. The
factory is in  Peru ’s Piura region, near an export terminal on
the Pacific coast.  The project also includes a 37-megawatt power generation
plant that will run on sugar-cane residue. A 60-kilovolt
transmission line that will let the company sell electricity to
the grid is “substantially complete,” the statement said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
