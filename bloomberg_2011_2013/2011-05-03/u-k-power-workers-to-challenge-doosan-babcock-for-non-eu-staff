U.K. power station workers will
challenge Doosan Babcock Ltd. at a meeting about workers from
outside the European Union doing maintenance at  Drax Group Plc (DRX) 
and  Scottish & Southern Energy Plc (SSE) ’s coal-fed plants.  GMB, the union for engineering construction workers, has
scheduled a third round of talks for May 6 regarding Doosan
Babcock’s hiring of more than 100 workers, including welders
from the  Far East , according to an e-mailed statement from the
union. Doosan Babcock is a unit of Korea’s Doosan Heavy
Industries and Construction Co.  “Despite several meetings with us about their legal
responsibilities, Doosan Babcock still intends to fill some of
their jobs for welders on these two sites with non-European
Union labor,” Jimmy Skivington, GMB regional officer, said in
the statement.  The union will ask that vacancies for repair in the next
several months at Drax’s 4,000-megawatt coal-fed plant and SSE’s
Ferrybridge stations in northern  England  be filled by U.K
workers. GMB questioned the legal basis for giving such jobs to
workers from outside the EU. Welding has been removed from the
U.K.’s skills shortage list, and about 500 British welders are
available for work, according to GMB.  Officials at Doosan Babcock in Crawley, England, couldn’t
immediately be reached by telephone for comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
