Vietnam  will need to build power
plants with a total capacity of more than 50,000 megawatts
through 2020, said Pham Hung, deputy director of the energy
department of the Ministry of Industry and Trade.  Vietnam will put forward policies to encourage investors to
help build more power plants, Hung said today in prepared
remarks at a meeting of the  Asian Development Bank  in Hanoi.  “The government has decided to move toward the trend of
gradually allowing power prices to follow the market,” Hung
said when asked whether prices may rise. “Starting June 1, we
will introduce a procedure that every three months, Vietnam
Electricity will consider adjusting” the price.  Vietnam’s government said in April that it would allow
power prices to be adjusted as often as once every three months,
depending on market conditions.  The policy is based on a government decision dated April 15
and signed by Prime Minister Nguyen Tan Dung, according to a
posting on the government’s website. Changes in fuel costs or
exchange rates are among the reasons for adjusting power prices.  The government increased electricity prices by about 15
percent on March 1, contributing to a 13.89 percent year-on-year
inflation rate in March. Inflation accelerated in April to 17.51
percent, the fastest pace since 2008.  To contact the reporter on this story:
