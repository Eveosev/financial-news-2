West Ham striker Andy Carroll pulled
out of the England soccer team’s first two World Cup qualiyfing
matches with a leg injury.  Carroll, who joined West Ham on loan from Liverpool earlier
this week, left the second half of today’s 3-0 Premier League
win over Fulham with a hamstring injury.  The Football Association said on its website that a
decision on a replacement won’t be made until after tomorrow’s
three Premier League games. Danny Welbeck,  Jermain Defoe  and
 Daniel Sturridge  are the other strikers on the England roster.  England opens qualifying for the 2014 World Cup in Moldova
on Sept. 7 and hosts Ukraine four days later.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
