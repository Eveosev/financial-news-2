Robinson Cano’s home run was one of
four New York hits as the Yankees rallied to beat the Baltimore
Orioles 4-3.  The win stretched the Yankees’ lead over Baltimore in the
 American League East  to three games.  Matt Wieters hit a homer in the third inning to give
Baltimore (73-59) a 3-0 lead before New York responded with four
unanswered runs. After Cano hit his 28th homer in the fourth,
the Yankees scored three in the seventh, with  Eduardo Nunez 
hitting a run-scoring single, Derek Jeter walking in a run and
Nunez scoring on an error by Baltimore shortstop J.J. Hardy.  Wei-Yin Chen (12-8) went 6 2/3 innings for the Orioles and
took the loss, allowing four runs (three earned) on four hits.
David Phelps went 4 2/3 for New York (76-56), allowing three
runs on three hits while striking out three and walking six.
 Boone Logan  (6-2) earned the win in relief and Rafael Soriano
notched his 35th save with a perfect ninth inning.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
