Researchers at Uppsala University in
Sweden are offering to name an experimental cancer drug after
anyone who donates 1 million pounds ($1.6 million) to help fund
its development, the Financial Times said.  Academics at the Swedish college are trying to raise 2
million pounds to pay for a clinical trial in as many as 20
people for the potential treatment of neuroendocrine cancer, the
newspaper said, citing comments from the university.  Steve Jobs , Apple Inc.â€™s late co-founder, died of
respiratory arrest caused by a pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor.  To contact the reporter on this story:
