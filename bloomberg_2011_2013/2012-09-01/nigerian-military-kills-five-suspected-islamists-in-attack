Nigeria ’s military said it killed
five suspected members of the Islamist Boko Haram militant group
yesterday after they attacked a military patrol vehicle in
Maiduguri, the capital of the northeastern Borno state.  “A fuel-propelled improvised explosive device was used by
the terrorists during the attack, which resulted in fires that
burnt some houses in the area,” Sagir Musa, a spokesman for the
military joint  task force  in the state, said today in an e-
mailed statement. “Two soldiers and a teenager sustained injury
in the encounter.”  Authorities in Nigeria,  Africa ’s most populous nation with
more than 160 million people, blame Boko Haram, which means
“Western education is a sin” in the local Hausa language, for
a surge in attacks in the mainly Muslim north and the capital,
Abuja, in which hundreds of people have died this year.  The Islamic sect has carried out a series of bombings and
attacks since 2009 in what it says is a campaign to establish an
Islamic state in the country.  To contact the reporter on this story:
