Swiss investment bank  Credit des
Alpes  agreed to acquire an interest in  Parinvest Group , a Miami-
based real estate broker and asset manager.  The transaction will lead to the creation of a new company,
Parinvest Asset Management Inc., that will provide property
sales and asset management services to foreign investors in
Miami,  Los Angeles  and  New York , Credit des Alpes said in an e-
mailed statement. Financial terms of the deal, which the firm
said would help it access investment
opportunities for Latin American clients, were not disclosed.  “Certain areas of the U.S. real estate market are, and
will continue to be, safe and sound investments,” Credit des
Alpes chairman Fabrizio Cerina said in the statement. “We have
seen a strong increase in interest from our Latin American
client base and we expect this trend to continue.”  Credit des Alpes and Parinvest have been collaborating to
advise clients on Miami property transactions since 2007,
according to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
