Sprinters Oscar Pistorius of  South
Africa  and Jason Smyth of Ireland were among the world record
setters yesterday at the London Paralympics, where American
Jessica Long won her third gold medal of the games.  Pistorius won his 200-meter T44 heat in a record time of
21.33 seconds to advance to tomorrow’s final.  The 25-year-old South African, who was born without fibulas
in both legs and is nicknamed “ Blade Runner ” for his J-shaped
carbon fiber legs, last month became the first amputee runner to
compete at the Olympics when he ran as part of South Africa’s
1,600-meter relay team.  Smyth broke the record in the men’s 100-meter T13 with a
time of 10.46 seconds to win by more than half a second over
Cuba’s Luis Felipe Gutierrez. The 25-year-old Smyth, who trains
with U.S. sprinter Tyson Gay in  Florida , set the previous mark
of 10.54 in yesterday’s heats.  Chinese athletes won eight gold medals yesterday -- in
swimming, judo, track cycling and track and field -- and 22 in
total to extend their lead at the top of the standings.  China  has 20 golds and 56 total, while  Australia  is second
with 11 golds among its 29 medals. Britain won five golds today
to match Ukraine with nine,  Russia  has eight and the U.S. has
six.  Long, 20, won the women’s 100-meter breaststroke SB7 gold
medal in 1 minute, 29.28 seconds, finishing more than 6 1/2
seconds ahead of Oksana Khrul of Ukraine. She now has 10 career
gold medals after winning three at the age of 12 in Athens in
2004 and four more in Beijing four years ago.  British athletes broke two world marks as swimmer Ellie
Simmonds won the women’s swimming 400-meter S6 freestyle in five
minutes, 19.17 seconds, and Neil Fachie and Barney Storey
clocked a world record of 1 minute, 01.351 seconds in the men’s
track cycling tandem one-kilometer time trial.  The games run through Sept. 9, with more than 4,000
athletes from 164 teams competing in a series of classes
depending on their impairment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
