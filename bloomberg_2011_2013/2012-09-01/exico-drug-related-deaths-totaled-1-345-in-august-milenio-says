Killings related to drug violence in
Mexico totaled 1,341 in August, the second-highest monthly rate
since President  Felipe Calderon  took office in December 2006,
newspaper Milenio reported today on its website.  Last month’s toll pushed the number of killings during
Calderon’s tenure to 55,416, according to the Mexico City-based
daily. Milenio has previously given the drug-related death toll
in July as 1,001.  During the first eight months of this year, 8,452 people
were killed in incidents related to drug violence, Milenio said
today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
