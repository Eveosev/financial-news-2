Paul Ryan , facing criticism for what fact-checkers said were false or distorted statements in his speech to the  Republican National Convention , is now qualifying another claim: his best marathon time.  The Republican vice presidential candidate, a Wisconsin congressman, said on the Hugh Hewitt Radio show Aug. 23 that his personal best for a 26.2-mile (42-kilometer) marathon was “under three, high twos. I had a two-hour-and-fifty something.”  “I was fast when I was younger, yeah,” Ryan said, according to an online transcript of the interview. “I hurt a disc in my back, so I don’t run marathons anymore.”  Related: Ryan Accused of Distortions in Convention Speech After Runner’s World magazine reported on its website it couldn’t find any marathon results by Ryan, his campaign told the publication he ran a race called Grandma’s Marathon in Duluth,  Minnesota , while he was a college student. Ryan  finished in 4 hours, 1 minute and 25 seconds in 1990, the  magazine reported yesterday.  “The race was more than 20 years ago, but my brother Tobin  -- who ran Boston last year -- reminds me that he is the owner of the fastest marathon in the family and has never himself ran a sub-three,” Ryan said in comments provided by his campaign spokesman,  Brendan Buck . “If I were to do any rounding, it would certainly be to four hours, not three.”  GM Controversy  Ryan’s most contentious statement during his Aug. 29 nomination-acceptance speech in Tampa, Florida, involved a   General Motors Co. (GM)  factory in Ryan’s hometown of Janesville,  Wisconsin. Ryan said President  Barack Obama  had promised to keep the plant open, and now it is “locked up and empty to this day.”  The plant actually closed in December 2008, according to the Janesville Gazette, and Obama didn’t take office until the following month.  PolitiFact, the non-partisan fact-checking organization, rated Ryan’s statement as false. Their term of art for such matters is “pants on fire.”  Related :  Romney Chases Obama in Swing States as Race Intensifies To contact the reporter on this story: Mark Niquette in  Charlotte ,  North Carolina , at   mniquette@bloomberg.net   To contact the editor responsible for this story: Jeanne Cummings at   jcummings21@bloomberg.net
