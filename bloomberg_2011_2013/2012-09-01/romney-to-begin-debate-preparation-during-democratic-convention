Republican presidential nominee  Mitt Romney  will begin preparing for the October presidential debates
next week as Democrats hold their national convention, a senior
adviser said.  The campaign hasn’t yet scheduled any public events for the
week, strategist  Kevin Madden  told reporters on Romney’s
campaign plane en route to a stop in Jacksonville. The former
Massachusetts governor plans to huddle in Vermont with advisers
including U.S. Senator  Rob Portman  of Ohio -- a veteran of
debate preparation for Republican presidential nominees -- to
get ready for his one-on-one sessions with President  Barack Obama , Madden said.  “We don’t have anything scheduled that’s public beyond
that,” he added, saying that is subject to change. The debate
preparations will be in Vermont, near Reading, at the home of
former Massachusetts Lieutenant Governor Kerry Healey.  Asked whether the campaign was concerned about the prospect
that Romney would surrender the media spotlight to Obama during
the Democratic convention if he took a break from campaigning,
Madden said: “We’ve spent a good deal of time on the campaign
trail. We’ll still have surrogates out.”  “I don’t think it’s going to be like a news blackout,” he
added.  Madden noted that Romney’s vice presidential running mate,
Representative  Paul Ryan , is planning to stump in North Carolina
while Democrats meet in Charlotte to formally nominate Obama for
a second term.  To contact the reporter on this story:
