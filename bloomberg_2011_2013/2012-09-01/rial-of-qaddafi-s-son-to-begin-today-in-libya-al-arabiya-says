The trial of Saif al-Islam, the son
of Libya’s late dictator,  Muammar Qaddafi , is to begin today in
a criminal court of the Libyan city of Zintan,  Al Arabiya 
television reported.  Saif al-Islam will be charged with provoking the killing of
Libyan protesters during the uprising last year that toppled
Muammar Qaddafi and led to his death, according to the network.  Qaddafi’s son may be given the death penalty if he’s
convicted, al-Arabiya said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
