Germany’s debt grew by 390 billion
euros ($490 billion) on costs related to banking bailouts and
payouts to indebted euro-area countries,  Passauer Neue Presse 
reported,  Costs related to bank bailouts increased debt by 322.5
billion euros and funding to help Greece,  Portugal  and Ireland
added 67.5 billion euros, Passauer said, citing a German
government response to a request in parliament by the Left
Party.  The rescue package for Spain wasn’t included in the
estimate because terms of the bailout haven’t been completed,
the newspaper reported, citing Hartmut Koschyk, state secretary
at the  Finance Ministry .  To contact the reporter on this story:
