U.K. 10-year  gilts  advanced for a
second week as economic reports added to evidence the U.K.
recession is deepening, fueling speculation that the  Bank of
England  will extend its monetary-stimulus program.  The gains pushed the 10-year yield to the  lowest level  in
four weeks. The central bank will expand its bond-purchase
program again this year, the British Chambers of Commerce said
yesterday, a day after the  Confederation of British Industry 
said Britain’s economy will probably shrink in 2012 for the
first time since 2009. Gilts maintained their gains after
Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said he would not rule
out a resumption of so-called quantitative easing measures.  “The overall backdrop for gilts remains fairly positive
near term as the economic picture remains poor,” said  Nick Stamenkovic , a fixed-income strategist at RIA Capital Markets
Ltd. in Edinburgh. “Clearly the Bank of England is keeping the
door open for another round of quantitative easing.”  The 10-year gilt yield fell five basis points, or 0.05
percentage point, this week to 1.48 percent at 4:28 p.m. London
time yesterday, after declining to 1.44 percent, the lowest
level since Aug. 2. The 4 percent bond due in March 2022 rose
0.49, or 4.90 pounds per 1,000-pound ($1,586) face amount, to
122.325. Two-year yields fell four basis points to 0.09 percent.  Consumer Sentiment  An  index of consumer sentiment  stayed at minus 29 in
August, GfK NOP Ltd., a London-based research group said in an
e-mailed report yesterday. The median prediction of 19
economists surveyed by Bloomberg was minus 27.  Britain’s central bank will expand its  quantitative-easing
program  to 425 billion pounds later this year from 375 billion
pounds, the London-based BCC wrote in a report yesterday.
Officials will hold it at that level until early 2014 when they
start to raise the  key interest rate , it said.  A report by the  British Retail Consortium  will show  retail
sales  fell 0.5 percent, after July’s 0.1 percent gain, according
to the median prediction of five economists surveyed by
Bloomberg before the Sept. 4 report. The Bank of England is due
to announce its latest policy decision two days later.  Gilts have returned 4.4 percent this year through Aug. 30,
according to indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the European
Federation of Financial Analysts Societies. German bunds gained
4 percent and  U.S. Treasuries  earned 2.3 percent.  The pound rose 0.3 percent in the week to $1.5862
yesterday, extending its gain this month to 1.2 percent. Against
the euro, it slipped 0.1 percent to 79.21 pence, down 1.1
percent in August.  To contact the reporter on this story:
