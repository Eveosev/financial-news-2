The  National Hockey League  and
players’ union disbanded negotiations over compensation issues
two weeks before the current contract is set to expire.  The talks stalled yesterday when the NHL Players’ Union
told the league it would not discuss a reset of player
compensation, Commissioner Gary Bettman told reporters.  “In light of the fact that they were unwilling to move
forward on the economics, there wasn’t much else to discuss,”
Bettman said.  Bettman said last month the owners would not operate the
2012-13 season without a Collective Bargaining Agreement. The
current contract expires Sept. 15.  The two sides are negotiating player compensation and
revenue sharing.  “The response that was made to us is that if the players
are not prepared to agree to an immediate reset in their
aggregate salary levels, that is to say, as we understand it, a
meaningful, absolute reduction in the players’ share in dollar
terms for next year as compared to last year, that they see no
point in discussing or responding to the proposals that we put
forward at the meeting today,” union Executive Director Donald Fehr said yesterday.  Both sides said they were willing to continue negotiations.  “Once we get past Sept. 15, I think the dynamic changes,’
Bettman said. “The damage to the business changes the dynamic
of the negotiation. So, from our standpoint, we’re hoping to
make a deal by Sept. 15.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
