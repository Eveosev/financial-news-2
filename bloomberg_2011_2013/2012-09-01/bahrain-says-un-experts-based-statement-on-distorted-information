Bahrain said a United Nations
Experts statement on the trial and verdict of a Bahraini human
rights activist is based on distorted information.  Bahrain sentenced activist Nabeel Rajab, 48, to three years
imprisonment for violating the country’s laws and not for
expressing his opinion as three UN experts said in a  statement 
on Aug. 23, the Information Affairs Authority said in an e-
mailed comment. The authority said Rajab had a fair trial and
his lawyer was present throughout the judicial process.  The UN Special Rapporteur on human rights defenders,
Margaret Sekaggya said on Aug. 23 that the sentencing of Nabeel
Rajab was “another blatant attempt by the Government of Bahrain
to silence those legitimately working to promote basic human
rights.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
