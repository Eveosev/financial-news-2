Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta
President  Dennis Lockhart  said he’s weighing the costs and
benefits of adding additional stimulus to an economy that has
“slightly” improved in the past few weeks.  “I’m trying to weigh the benefits in terms of lower
interest rates” and “how much more stimulus might achieve in
terms of a lower  unemployment rate  by the end of 2014,”
Lockhart said in an interview on Bloomberg Television today from
Jackson Hole, Wyoming. The risks from more easing include the
possibility of disrupting market functioning and complicating
the Fed’s exit from its record monetary accommodation, he said.  Speaking two weeks before the  Federal Open Market
Committee ’s next meeting, Chairman Ben S. Bernanke today
defended the central bank’s unprecedented actions and made the
case for even more stimulus. San Francisco Fed President  John Williams  called for another asset-purchasing program that’s “at
least as large” as the previous round of quantitative easing.  The Fed’s decisions are a “committee process” and any
easing may be implemented over an “extended period,” while its
effects will be felt in the economy after a delay, Lockhart said
in the interview. He would like to see a pace of job creation of
at least 150,000 per month “on a persistent basis,” he said.  “We’re on a 2 percent growth trajectory with very slow and
frustrating improvement in employment,” Lockhart said. “We’re
seeing some firming but I’m not sure that firming is enough to
really put us on a different path.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
