The University of  Notre Dame  routed
the U.S. Naval Academy 50-10 as the teams opened the college
football season in Dublin.  Theo Riddick and George Atikinson III both ran for two
touchdowns for Notre Dame. Everett Golson, making his first
start at quarterback for the Fighting Irish, threw for a
touchdown, and Stephon Tuitt returned a fumble 77 yards for
another score.  Trey Miller threw a 25-yard touchdown pass to Shawn Lynch
for Navy, while Nick Sloan kicked a 26-yard field goal.  The game drew a sellout crowd of almost 50,000 to Aviva
Stadium. It was the second time the two teams had played in
Ireland following Notre Dame’s 54-27 win at Dublin’s Croke Park
in 1996.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
