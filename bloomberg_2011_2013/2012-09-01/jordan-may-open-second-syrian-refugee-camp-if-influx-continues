Jordan  may open a second refugee
camp if the influx of people escaping conflict in  Syria 
continues at the same pace, Minister of Planning and
International Cooperation Jafar Hassan said.  The Zaatari refugee camp in Jordan has 25,000 people and is
receiving an average of about 1,500 more a day, he told
reporters in Amman, the capital, today.  Fighting between forces loyal to Syrian President Bashar al-Assad and rebels trying to end his rule has forced civilians
to seek refuge in Jordan, Lebanon and Turkey. More than 23,000
people have died since the uprising began in March last year,
according to the Syrian Observatory for  Human Rights .  Jordan will spend $160 million this year and $200 million
next year to provide services to the refugees, Hassan said. The
total number of Syrians who entered Jordan since the start of
the unrest is 177,000, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
