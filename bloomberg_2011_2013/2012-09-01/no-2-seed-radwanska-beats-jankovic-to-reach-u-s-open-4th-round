Third-seeded  Andy Murray  won three
tiebreakers and needed almost four hours to defeat Feliciano Lopez and join men’s top seed  Roger Federer  in the fourth round
of the U.S. Open tennis tournament.  While Murray won in the 84-degree (29-degree Celsius) heat
despite winning fewer points than his opponent, Federer breezed
to a straight-set win against  Fernando Verdasco .  “It was tough -- very hot, very humid,” Murray said at a
news conference. “It was physically challenging.”  American men Jack Sock,  James Blake  and  Sam Querrey  all
lost third-round matches yesterday at the National Tennis Center
in New York, leaving Mardy Fish,  Andy Roddick ,  John Isner  and
Steve Johnson as the only men from the U.S. left in the year’s
final Grand Slam tournament.  Fish, seeded 23rd, won a four-set match against 16th-seeded
 Gilles Simon  of France that lasted until 1:09 a.m. today.  Roddick, Isner and Johnson all play third-round matches
today. Roddick, the 20th seed who has announced he will retire
at the end of the tournament, will face Fabio Fognini of Italy.  Serena Williams , the women’s fourth seed, beat Ekaterina Makarova 6-4, 6-0 to avenge a defeat to the Russian at the
Australian Open in January. Williams became the last U.S. woman
left in singles when 19-year-old Sloane Stephens lost at night
to No. 12 Ana Ivanovic of Serbia.  Williams, who turns 31 on Sept. 26, would become the oldest
U.S. Open winner since Australian Margaret Court -- who was 31
when she won in 1973 -- if she claims her fourth U.S. Open
title. Williams said she has no plans to follow Roddick and
three-time U.S. Open champion Kim Clijsters into retirement
after the tournament.  No Retirement  “I definitely don’t want to end it,” the three-time U.S.
Open champion told reporters. “I feel like, if anything, I want
to be here even more and play even more.”  Williams will face Andrea Hlavackova of the Czech Republic
for a spot in the quarterfinals. Hlavackova beat  Maria Kirilenko , the No. 14 seed from Russia, 5-7, 6-4, 6-4.  Federer, 31, of Switzerland, who is looking to extend his
record of 17 major championships and win a sixth U.S. Open, beat
Verdasco, the No. 25 seed from Spain, 6-3, 6-4, 6-4.  While Federer’s win took just over two hours, Murray of
Britain needed three hours, 53 minutes to beat Lopez, the 30th
seed from Spain, winning 7-6 (7-5), 7-6 (7-5), 4-6, 7-6 (7-4).  Lopez won 162 total points in the match, eight more than
Murray.  Radwanska Advances  Women’s No. 2 seed Agnieszka Radwanska of Poland defeated
Jelena Jankovic of Serbia 6-3, 7-5. Also advancing in straight
sets to the women’s fourth round were No. 6 Angelique Kerber of
Germany and No. 10 Sara Errani of Italy.  Ivanovic won 6-7 (4-7), 6-4, 6-2 against unseeded Stephens,
who also lost in the third round of the U.S. Open last year to
Ivanovic.  Men’s sixth seed Tomas Berdych of the  Czech Republic  won in
four sets against No. 27 Querrey. Nicolas Almagro, the No. 11
seed from Spain, beat 19-year-old wild-card invitee Sock. No. 15
Milos Raonic of Canada had 29 aces in a straight-set defeat of
Blake.  To contact the reporter on this story:
