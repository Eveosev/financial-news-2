Eike Batista , Brazil’s richest man,
is in talks to sell an additional stake in  MPX Energia SA (MPXE3)  to
German utility EON AG for more than $1 billion,  Veja magazine
reported , without saying where it got the information.  EON acquired an 11.7 percent stake in MPX earlier this
year.  Separately, Batista is seeking to raise money in the Middle
East and Eastern Europe for a fund to take over Brazilian
television network SBT and buy minority stakes in big companies,
Veja said in its Radar column, without saying where it got the
information. A Tunisian executive named Aziz Ben Ammar is
serving as Batista’s new right-hand man, according to the
magazine.  EON declined to comment in an e-mailed statement. EBX’s
media office didn’t immediately have a comment when contacted by
