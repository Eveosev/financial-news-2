Deputy Prime Minister  Nick Clegg 
reiterated that the U.K. government will remain intact amid
rising discontent within the Conservative Party and Liberal
Democrats that make up the coalition, the Times of London said.  He and Prime Minister  David Cameron  are determined to
govern through 2015 when the U.K. is scheduled to hold elections
next, the newspaper said, citing an interview with Clegg.  “It was never going to be a walk in the park, certainly
not with the economy and euro zone as it is,” Clegg told the
Times. “What you don’t do at a moment like that is bale out and
lose your nerve.”  Conservative Party leader Cameron formed the coalition with
Clegg, who leads the Liberal Democrats, in 2010 after failing to
get enough votes to secure a majority in parliament.  To contact the reporter on this story:
