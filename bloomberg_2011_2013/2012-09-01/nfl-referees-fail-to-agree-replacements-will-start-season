The  National Football League  will
have replacement officials on the field when the Super Bowl
champion New York Giants open the 2012 season against the Dallas
Cowboys this week.  NFL Commissioner  Roger Goodell  ended three days of talks
yesterday with representatives of the NFL Referees Association
without reaching an agreement on a new contract. The league
locked out the officials in June.  “No further talks are scheduled,” said league spokesman
 Greg Aiello  in an e-mail. “We are proceeding with the
replacement officials.”  The league and its part-time officials are negotiating over
pay, pensions and operational issues,  Ray Anderson , the NFL’s
executive vice president of operations told the 32 teams in a
memo last week.  The season opens Sept. 5 with the Giants-Cowboys game at
Metlife Stadium in East Rutherford, New Jersey.  “We are disappointed because it means that our members
will not be back on the field for Week 1 of the regular season
due to the NFL’s continuing lockout,” said Mike Arnold, lead
negotiator for the union, in a statement. “We remain willing to
negotiate with the NFL in order to reach a fair agreement.”  The replacement officials worked the preseason games,
drawing criticism for missed calls, inaccurate spotting on downs
and general lack of skill and experience.  To contact the reporter on this story:
