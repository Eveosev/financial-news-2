Rookie Miguel Gonzalez struck out a
career-high nine batters in seven shutout innings and  Mark Reynolds  hit two home runs as the  Baltimore Orioles  beat the
American League East-leading New York Yankees 6-1 in a Major
League Baseball game.  Gonzalez (6-3) allowed four hits and walked one for the
Orioles, who improved to 73-58 to move within two games of the
Yankees (75-56) in the AL East. Baltimore is tied in the AL wild
card race with the  Oakland Athletics , who defeated the Boston
Red Sox 20-2.  “I think the adrenaline gets me going, helps me out,”
Gonzalez told reporters. “I just like pitching against a good
offensive team, I guess.”  The 28-year-old right-hander threw 66 of his 97 pitches for
strikes.  “He was just filling up the strike zone,” Yankee first
baseman  Nick Swisher  said. “He’s kind of a shorter guy, kind of
throws it right out of his ear. You’ve just got to give him
credit, man. He shut us down tonight.”  Reynolds, who drove in three runs on two homers, broke a
stretch of 38 at-bats without a home run last night at Yankee
Stadium. J.J. Hardy added a solo homer in the sixth inning.  “Keep doubting, we don’t care,” Reynolds said. “We’re
coming in, doing our jobs and doing the little things to win
baseball games.”  Curtis Granderson  hit his 34th home run of the season in
the ninth inning for the Yankees only score in the first of the
three-game series.  Hiroki Kuroda (12-10) took the loss, giving up four runs on
eight hits over 8 1/3 innings.  To contact the reporter on this story:
