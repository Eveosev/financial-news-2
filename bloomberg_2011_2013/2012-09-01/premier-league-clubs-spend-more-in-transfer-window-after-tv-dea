English Premier League clubs
exceeded last year’s spending total during the summer player
transfer period after securing a new television deal.  Clubs spent 490 million pounds ($777 million) in the period
that ended last night, according to accountant Deloitte LLP.
That was 5 million pounds more than the same time in 2011,
though 10 million pounds short of the record four years ago.  The five biggest spenders -- Chelsea, Tottenham,  Manchester
City , Manchester United and Arsenal -- each paid out at least 30
million pounds on players and combined for 55 percent of the
total spending. About 110 million pounds was spent on the final
day yesterday, up 10 million pounds from 2011.  Transfer fees to overseas clubs rose about 50 percent to
300 million pounds this year. That represented about 61 percent
of the Premier League total, compared with 42 percent in 2011,
Deloitte said in its statement.  The 20-team league in June agreed on a three-year domestic
TV contract worth a record 3.02 billion pounds through 2016. Its
global television rights were sold for 1.4 billion pounds. The
average Premier League club will gain at least an additional 25
million pounds in revenue per year starting in the 2013-14
season, Alan Switzer, a director in Deloitte’s Sports Business
Group, said in the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
