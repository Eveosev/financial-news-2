Iranian Economy Minister Shamseddin Hosseini said  India  will maintain energy ties with the country.
 Iran  held economic talks with some Arab members of the Non-
Aligned Movement during a summit last week in Tehran, the
capital, he said. Hosseini spoke in an interview late yesterday
in the city.  On India:  “Iran and India had some economic bilateral meetings
during the NAM meeting. India considers Iran as an energy-
producing source and it is so vigilant in using Iran as one of
its energy sources. The Indian government bravely announced
several times that it will constantly continue its energy trade
with Iran.”  On Arab economic talks:  “Almost all of our Arab neighbors were present at the Non-
Aligned Movement meeting in Tehran and we had economic
negotiations with them on the sidelines of the NAM meeting.
Considering the previous economic performance of Iran, all
countries had new suggestions for bilateral and multilateral
ties in various fields such as energy, oil, gas, tourism,
religious tourism, housing, and  road construction .”  “Iran didn‘t have any specific bilateral economic meeting
with Egypt on the sidelines of the NAM summit meeting.’’  On NAM economic talks:  ‘‘One of the best discussed subjects related to energy was
building  power plants , building dams and exports of
electricity.’’  To contact the reporter on this story:
