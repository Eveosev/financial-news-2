Jenson Button won his first pole
position with the McLaren team by topping qualifying for
tomorrow’s Belgian Grand Prix.  Button posted a time of 1 minute, 47.573 seconds at the Spa
Francorchamps circuit to beat out Sauber’s Kamui Kobayashi by
three-tenths of a second. The Englishman’s last pole was in
Monaco in 2009, the season he won the Formula One championship
driving for the Brawn team. He moved to McLaren in 2010.  Pastor Maldonado of Williams was third-fastest with Lotus’s
Kimi Raikkonen and Sauber’s Sergio Perez rounding out the top
five qualifiers.  Ferrari’s  Fernando Alonso  qualified sixth. The Spaniard
leads Red Bull’s  Mark Webber  by 40 points in the standings as
the Formula One season resumes following its annual summer
break.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
