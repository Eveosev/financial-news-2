Sojaprotein AD (SJPT) , the biggest soy bean
processor in the Balkans, may have to import the beans for the
first time in a decade after a drought cut the local harvest.  The Serbian company may buy as much as 15,000 metric tons
of soy beans, probably from neighboring Croatia, Romania or
 Hungary  that ban genetically-modified crops like Serbia, General
Manager Branislava Pavlovic said in an interview today.
Sojaprotein needs more than 200,000 tons a year and the drought
reduced the harvest available for all processors by 35 percent
to 284,500 tons, she said.  Victoria Group, which controls Sojaprotein, plans to almost
double annual exports after it completes a 100 million-euro
($126 million) investment program by the end of next year, Zoran Mitrovic, co-owner of the group, said after touring the plant
with the head of the European Bank for Reconstruction and
Development, Suma Chakrabarti.  “We are here long-term with you,” Chakrabarti said. “We
see huge potential in the sector.”  The EBRD controls 21.4 percent of Victoria Group and lent
10 million euros to Sojaprotein in March.  To contact the reporter on this story:
