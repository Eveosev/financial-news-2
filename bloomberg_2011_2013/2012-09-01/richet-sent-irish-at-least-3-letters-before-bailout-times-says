Former European Central Bank
President  Jean-Claude Trichet  wrote to then-Irish Finance
Minister  Brian Lenihan  at least three times in the five weeks
before the nation sought a bailout in November 2010, the  Irish
Times  reported, citing the letters.  Trichet said in a letter dated Oct. 15, 2010, that the ECB
was concerned about a rapid rise in its funding to Irish banks,
the newspaper said. On Nov. 4, he told Lenihan in a letter that
the ECB was monitoring Ireland’s commitment to its four-year
budget-cuts program, it said. Trichet urged Ireland to enter an
aid program on Nov. 19, a day after Irish Central Bank Governor
 Patrick Honohan  said a bailout was necessary, the Times said.  Trichet told Lenihan by phone on Nov. 12 that the ECB could
no longer give Irish banks unconditional support without the
state entering an aid program, the Times said. Lenihan, who died
in June last year, said in an interview aired in April 2011 on
BBC Radio 4 that Trichet wrote to him that day and “raised the
question about whether Ireland would be participating in a
program.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
