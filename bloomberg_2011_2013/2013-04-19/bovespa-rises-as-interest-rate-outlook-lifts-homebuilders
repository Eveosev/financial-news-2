The Bovespa index gained as traders
pared expectations for interest-rate increases in  Brazil ,
boosting companies that sell on credit.  Homebuilder  MRV Engenharia e Participacoes SA  gained after
reporting that revenue rose 34 percent in the three months
ending in March. Competitors  Brookfield Incorporacoes SA (BISA3)  and  PDG
Realty SA Empreendimentos e Participacoes  also advanced.  The Bovespa index added 1.2 percent to 53,802.62 at 10:24
a.m. in Sao Paulo, reducing  this week’s  slump to 2.1 percent.
Fifty-four of the 69 stocks on the gauge advanced today. The
real strengthened 0.3 percent to 2.0131 per dollar. Interbank
deposit futures rose after policy makers raised borrowing costs
less than some analysts had forecast, fueling speculation that
interest rate increases this year may be limited.  “Looks like now the market is expecting the central bank
will increase rates in small dosages, which is giving some
momentum to the Bovespa,” Hamilton Moreira, a strategist at
Banco do Brasil SA, said by phone from  Sao Paulo .  The central bank’s board this week voted 6 to 2 to raise
the target lending rate by 25 basis points to 7.50 percent from
a record low 7.25 percent. A survey by Bloomberg showed that 18
of 58 analysts forecast an increase of 50 basis points. Swap
rates on the contract due in January dropped five basis points,
or 0.05 percentage point, to 7.79 percent.  MRV jumped 4 percent to 8.89 reais. Brookfield climbed 3.3
percent to 2.18 reais. PDG Realty rose 2.5 percent to 2.48
reais.  To contact the reporter on this story:
