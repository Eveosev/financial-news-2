Belarusian president Aleksandr Lukashenko said his country wants to normalize relations with
Western powers, signaling a shift in policy two years after
coming under pressure for a violent crackdown on protesters.  “We don’t want to quarrel, we want good relations with
you, but we also don’t want to bend our knees before you”,
Lukashenko told lawmakers today in the capital, Minsk, referring
to the European Union and the U.S.  Western sanctions saddling Belarus are counterproductive,
Lukashenko said. While the former Soviet republic is willing to
maintain close relations with  Russia , he called on Moscow not to
force Belarus into auctioning off state assets.  The eastern European nation, run by Lukashenko since 1994,
is struggling to remove sanctions as it faces pressure to
refinance foreign debt and prospects dim for a new bailout loan
from the International Monetary Fund. The country’s external
debt payments will peak this year at $3.1 billion.  Lukashenko secured his fourth term in office in December
2010 as police and the KGB security service cracked down on
protesters, jailing eight presidential contenders. More than 200
officials including the foreign minister and more than 30
companies became subject to travel bans and asset freeze across
the EU.  The Belarusian government has made steps in recent months
to mend relations with the West. The Swedish charge d’affairs
was allowed to return to Belarus after a dispute last August and
Prime Minister Mikhail Myasnikovich paid an official visit to
 Lithuania  this week.  To contact the reporter on this story:
