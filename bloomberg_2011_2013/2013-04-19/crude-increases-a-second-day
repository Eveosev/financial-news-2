Crude advanced for a second day,
paring its third weekly drop, on speculation that declines were
excessive and as the euro increased against the dollar.  West Texas Intermediate oil rose 0.3 percent. Prices gained
the most in three weeks yesterday after the 14-day relative-
strength index sank below 30 on April 17, a sign the market is
oversold, data compiled by Bloomberg show. Commodities gained
with the euro after German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble
said in an interview with Wirtschaftswoche magazine that the
 European Central Bank  should reduce liquidity in the euro area.  “We’re still getting a bounce after a big price decline,”
said  Michael Lynch , president of Strategic Energy & Economic
Research in Winchester,  Massachusetts . “This isn’t an
aggressively bearish market because investors are looking at the
dips as buying opportunities.”  WTI crude for May delivery rose 28 cents to settle at
$88.01 a barrel on the  New York Mercantile Exchange . The
contract touched $85.61 in intraday trading yesterday, the
lowest level since Dec. 11. The volume of all futures was 6.1
percent below the 100-day average for this time of day at 2:44
p.m. Prices fell 3.6 percent this week and are 14 percent lower
than a year ago.  Brent Gains  Brent oil for June settlement gained 52 cents, or 0.5
percent, to end the session at $99.65 a barrel on the London-
based ICE Futures Europe exchange. The volume of all futures
traded today was 19 percent less than the 100-day average.
Futures touched $96.75 yesterday, the lowest intraday price
since July 2. Brent slid 3.4 percent this week.  The June European benchmark grade was at a premium of
$11.38 to WTI futures for the same month. The spread was $10.72
on April 17, the narrowest closing level since Jan. 25, 2012.  WTI rebounded in early March after its relative-strength
index slid below 30, a technical indication that futures have
fallen too quickly and further losses aren’t sustainable.
Today’s reading is about 33.4.  The euro rose as much as 0.6 percent against the dollar,
bolstering the appeal of raw materials denominated in the U.S.
currency as an investment. The Standard & Poor’s GSCI Index of
24 commodities was up 0.2 percent.  The  International Monetary Fund  lowered its global economic
growth forecasts for 2013 on April 16. The Washington-based fund
predicts the world will grow 3.3 percent this year, down from
the 3.5 percent estimated in January.  Growth Projections  The IMF projection for the U.S. was cut to 1.9 percent from
2 percent, while  China  was reduced to 8 percent from 8.2
percent. The U.S. and China are the world’s biggest oil-
consuming countries, accounting for a combined 32 percent of
global oil demand in 2011, according to  BP Plc (BP/) ’s Statistical
Review of World Energy.  “Concerns about a faltering global economy have been the
main driver this week,” said  Phil Flynn , senior market analyst
at the Price Futures Group in  Chicago .  U.S. oil  output  averaged 7.21 million barrels a day last
week, the most since July 1992, the Energy Information
Administration said in an April 17 report.  Brent may fall below $95 a barrel in the “near term” if
the global recovery stalls, and may slide into a range of $90 to
$100 if world economic growth weakens to 3 percent from 4
percent,  Francisco Blanch , the New York-based head of
commodities research at Bank of America, said in an e-mailed
report yesterday. Brent last traded below $95 in June.  Barclays and BNP Paribas SA are among banks that have said
this week oil’s decline is temporary.  $100 Floor  Venezuelan Oil Minister  Rafael Ramirez  said that $100 a
barrel should be the floor for  oil prices  and that he will
inquire about an extraordinary meeting of the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries. Ramirez spoke to reporters in
Caracas yesterday. The 12-member group’s next scheduled meeting
is on May 31.  “OPEC has to be concerned about the drop in prices but
their options are limited, especially given the surge in U.S.
output,” Flynn said.  Implied volatility for at-the-money WTI options expiring in
June was 25.4 percent, down from 25.6 percent yesterday.  Electronic trading volume on the Nymex was 429,489
contracts as of 2:44 p.m. It totaled 772,647 contracts
yesterday, 31 percent above the three-month average. Open
interest was 1.76 million contracts.  To contact the reporter on this story:
