A pipeline proposed for Canada’s
west coast would boost demand for tankers carrying oil exports
to the U.S. and Asia, according to E.A. Gibson Shipbrokers Ltd.  The Enbridge Northern Gateway Project would create cargoes
for 50 very large crude carriers, 120 Suezmax ships and 50
Aframaxes a year as early as 2016, the London-based shipbroker
estimated in an e-mailed report today.  “Certainly the pipeline can be viewed with some optimism
for the crude tanker market,” Gibson said in the report.  Each VLCC can hold 2 million barrels of crude, twice as
much as a Suezmax. Aframaxes carry about 650,000 barrels.  Charter rates for VLCCs on their busiest trade route to
 Japan  from  Saudi Arabia  rose 0.5 percent to 32.05 industry-
standard Worldscale points today, according to the  Baltic
Exchange , the London-based publisher of shipping costs. The
Baltic Dirty Tanker Index, which includes smaller vessels, rose
0.3 percent to 634, exchange figures showed.  Daily losses for VLCCs on the benchmark journey narrowed to
$254 from $751, according to the exchange’s assessment, which
takes no account of speed cuts aimed at using less fuel, the
industry’s biggest expense. The price of marine fuel, or
 bunkers , rose 1.8 percent to $608.58 a metric ton, figures
compiled by Bloomberg from 25 global ports showed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
