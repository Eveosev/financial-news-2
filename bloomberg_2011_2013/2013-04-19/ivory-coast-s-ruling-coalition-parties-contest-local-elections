Voters in  Ivory Coast  will cast
their ballots on April 21 in the first local elections in more
than a decade in French-speaking West Africa’s biggest economy.  Almost 700 candidates will compete for seats in about 200
towns, while 84 others are seeking regional seats. The vote will
start at 7 a.m. local time and close at 5 p.m., according to the
Independent Electoral Commission.  The election will be contested by candidates of the two
main political parties, coalition partners Rally of Republicans
of President  Alassane Ouattara  and the  Democratic Party  of Ivory
Coast, which held a political monopoly until 1993.  Ivory Coast last held local elections in July 2002. Two
months later, a failed coup against former leader  Laurent Gbagbo 
split the country into a government-controlled south and a
rebel-held north. Gbagbo was ousted in 2011 by rebel troops
aided by United Nations forces after refusing to acknowledge
defeat in presidential elections five months before.  Gbagbo’s party, the Popular Ivorian Front, is boycotting
the vote on the grounds that the government didn’t review the
composition of the electoral commission.  To contact the reporter on this story:
