The  Internal Revenue Service  will
close all of its public operations on five days from now through
August because of employee furloughs, acting commissioner  Steve
Miller  told employees in a memo today.  The tax agency will be closed and almost all employees will
be furloughed on May 24, June 14, July 5, July 22 and Aug. 30,
Miller wrote. The closing will affect operations such as the IRS
toll-free lines and taxpayer assistance centers.  As many as two more furlough days may be needed in August
and September, Miller wrote.  “We came to a decision that balances our primary mission
to serve the taxpayers and considers the effect on employees,”
he wrote. “We settled on having uniform furlough dates for
everyone and closing down agency operations entirely. This way,
the IRS can gain additional cost savings on utilities and other
services in our work locations.”  Government agencies are furloughing employees to
accommodate the budget reductions that took effect March 1.  Miller had said earlier that he wanted to delay furloughs
until after the April 15 tax-filing deadline for individuals.  Colleen Kelley , president of the National Treasury
Employees Union, which represents IRS workers, called the
furloughs a “disappointing development” and warned about the
effect on taxpayers who file on deadlines besides April 15.  “I believe this is an unprecedented event that leaves
taxpayers out in the cold,” she said in a statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
