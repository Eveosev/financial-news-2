The Obama administration, trying to
advance new gun-control measures amid resistance from Congress,
 proposed  a rule making it easier to submit names of the mentally
ill to a U.S. database of people prohibited from buying guns.  Federal law already bans mentally ill individuals from
purchasing guns, including those involuntarily committed to
psychiatric hospitals or found not guilty by reason of insanity
in trials. State authorities that decide whether people should
be committed or found insane would gain an exemption to federal
health privacy rules under the new regulation, allowing them to
report those names to the federal database, according to a
notice posted on the Federal Register’s website.  “In order to protect our children and communities, we must
ensure that information on potentially dangerous individuals who
are prohibited from possessing firearms is available to the
background check system,” Health and Human Services Secretary
 Kathleen Sebelius  said in a statement.  Records of patients’ treatment and diagnoses wouldn’t be
allowed to be disclosed, the administration said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
