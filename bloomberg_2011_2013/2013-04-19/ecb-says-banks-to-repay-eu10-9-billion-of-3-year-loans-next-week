The European Central Bank said
banks will repay 10.9 billion euros ($14.3 billion) of three-
year loans next week.  Fourteen banks will return 8.9 billion euros borrowed in
the first of the so-called Longer Term Refinancing Operation,
and 15 will repay 2.1 billion euros of the second tender, the
Frankfurt-based ECB said in a statement today. That takes the
total amount of money repaid early to 274.5 billion euros, or 27
percent of the amount lent.  The ECB’s three-year loans helped prevent a credit crunch
last year as European banks shied away from  lending  in the midst
of a worsening debt crisis. With excess  liquidity  in the
financial system still around 344 billion euros, some banks are
choosing to repay the funds, which were offered at the average
of the ECB’s benchmark rate over their duration, early.  “Considerable progress has been made since last summer in
improving the funding situation of banks, in strengthening the
domestic deposit base in stressed countries and in reducing
reliance on the Eurosystem, as reflected in repayments of the
three-year LTROs,” ECB President Mario Draghi said this month.  He also said policy makers stand ready to cut interest
rates if the economy deteriorates further, a step that would
reduce the interest banks pay on the long-term loans.  The central bank still allows banks to borrow as much money
as they want against eligible collateral for periods of one
week, one month and three months.  To contact the reporter on this story:
