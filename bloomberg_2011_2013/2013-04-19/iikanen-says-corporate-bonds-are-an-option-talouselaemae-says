European Central Bank Governing
Council member Erkki Liikanen said the ECB is looking at all
options, including corporate bond purchases, to ensure its
monetary policy is transmitted to the 17-nation euro economy,
Talouselaemae magazine reported, citing an interview.  Asked if the ECB could buy corporate bonds, Liikanen said:
“We must always be prepared to look at new options,” according
to Talouselaemae. ‘I won’t comment on any individual measures,
but we are prepared to look at all options.” Asked again if the
ECB can directly purchase corporate bonds, Liikanen replied:
“Central banks can buy corporate bonds,” the Helsinki-based
business magazine reported.  Liikanen, who is the Governor of the Bank of  Finland , said
the Helsinki-based central bank’s portfolio contains both
domestic and foreign corporate bonds.  ECB monetary policy will remain accommodative, Liikanen
said, according to Talouselaemae.  To contact the reporter on this story:
