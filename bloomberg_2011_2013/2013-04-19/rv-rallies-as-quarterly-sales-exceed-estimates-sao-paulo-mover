MRV Engenharia & Participacoes SA,
 Brazil ’s second-biggest homebuilder by market value, rose after
quarterly sales beat forecast as competition diminished.  Shares (MRVE3)  advanced 4.8 percent to 8.96 reais at the close of
trading in Sao Paulo, the biggest one-day gain since April 10.
The benchmark  Bovespa index  added 1.4 percent.  Sales jumped 34 percent to 1.1 billion reais ($547 million)
in the first quarter of 2013 from the same period in 2012,
according to a regulatory filing disclosing its preliminary
results after the close of trading yesterday. That compares with
the average estimate of 1.04 billion reais among three analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg.  The increase is the result of reduced competition in the
low-income market and better strategies to sell homes, Leonardo Correa, MRV’s chief financial officer, said in an interview in
Sao Paulo. Rivals  PDG Realty (PDGR3)  SA and  Rossi Residencial SA (RSID3)  said at
the beginning of the month that they are switching their focus
to more expensive projects.  “Those first-quarter numbers show that our strategy to
focus on the low-income market is correct,” Correa said.  About 90 percent of MRV’s houses and apartments are sold
through a federal government financing program called “My
House, My Life,” which targets families with monthly income of
as much as 5,000 reais.  To reach those consumers, MRV is expanding its own sales
team and advertising on the Internet as well, Correa said.  MRV has declined 25 percent this year while the Bovespa
fell 12 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
