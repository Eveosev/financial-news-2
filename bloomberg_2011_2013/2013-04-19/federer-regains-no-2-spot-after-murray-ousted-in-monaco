Men’s Grand Slam record holder
 Roger Federer  will regain the No. 2 ranking in tennis next week
after  Andy Murray  lost yesterday in Monte Carlo.  Murray, who rose to second on April 2 after winning the
Miami Masters, was beaten by No. 13-seed Stanislas Wawrinka, 6-
1, 6-2 on the clay courts at the Monte Carlo Masters.  Britain’s Murray, who won his first Grand Slam title at the
U.S. Open last year, is still seeking his first clay-court
title. He made 24 unforced errors against Switzerland’s
Wawrinka.  Federer, a 17-time Grand Slam champion, is on a two-month
break from the tour at home in Switzerland in preparation for
the clay-court season. The 31-year-old, who won his lone French
Open championship in 2009, will return in Madrid in early May.  The Monte Carlo event has been won a record eight straight
times by French Open champion  Rafael Nadal  of Spain, who
returned in February from a seven-month injury break. Fifth-
ranked Nadal today won his 45th consecutive match in Monaco,
defeating Bulgaria’s Grigor Dimitrov in the quarterfinals 6-2,
2-6, 6-4.  To contact the reporter on this story:
