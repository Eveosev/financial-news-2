St. Petersburg Airport in  Russia ’s
second-biggest city was closed for three and a half hours after
an anonymous phone call warned of a possible bomb explosion.  The call was received at 6 a.m. today and the police
checked the international and domestic terminals of Pulkovo
airport until 9.30 a.m in St. Petersburg, the Interior Ministry
department for transport said on its website.  “No traces of explosives were found,” the ministry said.
“The airport works as usual.”  About 1,500 people have been evacuated, RIA Novosti
reported, citing an unidentified police official.  Pulkovo is Russia’s third biggest airport by passenger
numbers. It handled 11.2 million of passengers in 2012, 16
percent more than in 2011, according to airport data.  To contact the reporter on this story:
