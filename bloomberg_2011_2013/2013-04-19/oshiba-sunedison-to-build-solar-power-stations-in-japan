Toshiba Corp. (6502) , the maker of flash-
memory chips and atomic reactors, will work with a unit of  MEMC
Electronic Materials Inc. (WFR)  to build solar plants in Japan.  Toshiba and MEMCâ€™s SunEdison LLC agreed in December to
jointly develop  power plants , Atsushi Ido, a spokesman for the
Tokyo-based company, said by phone today.  SunEdison, based in California, will be a project owner
while Toshiba will be in charge of engineering, procurement and
construction for each plant, Ido said.  The move comes after Japan introduced an incentive program
for clean energy in July following the 2011 Fukushima nuclear
accident.  Toshiba aims to develop about 100 megawatts of solar
projects with SunEdison, the Nikkei newspaper reported today
without citing a source. Toshiba does not disclose its target,
Ido said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
