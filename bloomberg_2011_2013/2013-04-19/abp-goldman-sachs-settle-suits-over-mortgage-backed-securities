Stichting Pensioenfonds ABP and
 Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)  reached a settlement in a dispute over
residential mortgage-backed securities purchased by the fund
from 2005 to 2007.  “We now are pleased to see that these cases are concluded
satisfactorily one by one,” Henk Brouwer, chairman of Heerlen,
Netherlands-based ABP, said in a statement today. “We have full
confidence that all will be completed in due course, evidencing
that all parties involved are looking to the future, leaving
past grievances and practices behind them.”  ABP sued New York-based Goldman Sachs in  New York  State
Supreme Court in January 2012. The company alleged that it
purchased certain mortgage-backed securities in reliance on
false and misleading statements and that the securities were
riskier than had been represented, backed by  mortgage loans 
worth significantly less than had been represented.  Harmen Geers, an ABP spokesman, declined to comment on the
amount of the settlement. Stampa Communications, based in
Amsterdam and representing Goldman Sachs in the Netherlands,
also declined to comment when contacted by phone today.  Pools of home loans securitized into bonds were a central
part of the housing bubble that helped send the U.S. into the
biggest recession since the 1930s. The housing market collapsed,
and the crisis swept up lenders and investment banks as the
market for the securities evaporated.  To contact the reporter on this story:
