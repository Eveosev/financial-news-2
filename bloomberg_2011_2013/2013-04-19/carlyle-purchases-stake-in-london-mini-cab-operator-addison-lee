Carlyle Group LP, (CG)  the world’s
second-biggest private-equity firm by assets, agreed to buy a
“significant” stake in Addison Lee, London’s largest mini-cab
operator, from its founders.
     Carlyle will finance the purchase from its 5.4 billion-euro
($7 billion) leveraged-buyout fund, the Washington-based firm
said in a statement that didn’t give further financial terms.
The transaction values Addison Lee at about 300 million pounds
($458 million), including debt, according to a person briefed on
the matter who asked not to be identified because the terms are
private.  The company was started in 1975 by John Griffin, who later
partnered with Lenny and Daryl Foster. Today, the firm operates
more than 4,500 vehicles and transports more than 10 million
passengers a year, according to Carlyle’s statement.  “Addison Lee is a strong business and brand with great
potential,” said Andrew Burgess, a managing director at Carlyle
in  London . “Carlyle’s experience and expertise will allow us to
support the plans to continue growing the business both in the
U.K. and internationally.”  Carlyle’s investments in the European automotive industry
include RAC Ltd., a roadside-recovery company, which it bought
from Aviva Plc for $1.6 billion. It also acquired Applus
Servicios Tecnologicos SL, a Spanish company that tests vehicle
emissions, for 1.48 billion euros, including debt, in 2007.  Officials at Carlyle and Addison Lee declined to comment
beyond the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
