 Copper slumped into a bear market
in  London  on concern slowing economies from China to the U.S.
will reduce demand as supply of the metal expands.  Copper for delivery in three months fell 1.4 percent to
$6,990 a metric ton by the close on the London Metal Exchange
today. That was below the level of $6,992 marking a 20 percent
drop from the February 2012 closing high, a common definition of
a bear market.  To contact the reporters on this story:
