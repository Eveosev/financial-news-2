South African corn futures fell to
the lowest level in more than a week after prices of the grain
in the U.S., the world’s biggest producer, dropped.  White corn for delivery in July, the most active contract,
declined 2.3 percent to 2,118 rand ($231) a metric ton, the
lowest since April 10, by the noon close in Johannesburg. The
yellow variety for delivery in the same month retreated 2.2
percent to 2,096 rand a ton.  Prices for the grain slipped for the first time in three
days on the Chicago Board of Trade yesterday, losing 1.8 percent
on forecasts for reduced U.S. drought conditions in the Midwest
and drier weather for planting crops next month.  “Chicago was down last night and that had an impact on our
markets today,” Lindy van Blommestein, a trader at Farmwise
Grains (Pty) Ltd., said by mobile phone today.  South Africa  is the continent’s largest producer of corn.
White corn is a staple food, while the yellow variety is mainly
used as  animal feed .  Wheat for May delivery dropped 0.7 percent to 3,416 rand a
ton.  To contact the reporter on this story:
