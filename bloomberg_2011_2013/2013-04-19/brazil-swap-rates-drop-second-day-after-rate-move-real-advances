Brazil ’s swap rates headed for the
biggest weekly drop in 11 months after policy makers raised
borrowing costs less than some analysts had forecast and
signaled that increases this year may be limited.  Swap rates on the contract due in January 2014 fell five
basis points, or 0.05 percentage point, to 7.79 percent at 9:58
a.m. in  Sao Paulo , pushing the five-day decrease to 38 basis
points, the most since the period ended May 18. The real
advanced 0.3 percent to 2.0129 per dollar, paring its loss since
April 12 to 2.2 percent.  Swap rates declined even as prices through mid-April rose
more than economists forecast. Prices as measured by the IPCA-15
 price index  jumped 0.51 percent in the month through mid-April,
the national statistics agency said in a report published on its
website. That was more than forecast by all except three of 38
economists surveyed by Bloomberg, whose median estimate was for
a 0.46 percent increase.  “The monetary policy committee showed a high tolerance for
inflation, and this shouldn’t change because of the IPCA-15,”
 Tony Volpon , the head of research for the Americas at Nomura
Holdings Inc., said by phone from  New York .  The central bank’s board this week voted 6 to 2 to raise
the target lending rate by 25 basis points to 7.50 percent from
a record low 7.25 percent. A survey by Bloomberg showed that 18
of 58 analysts forecast an increase of 50 basis points.  To contact the reporters on this story:
