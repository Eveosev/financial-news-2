Six magnums of Chateau Lafleur 1982
from Pomerol are among leading lots at a  Sotheby’s (BID)  wine auction
in  New York  this month, along with a double magnum of Chateau
Cheval Blanc 1947 and a case of Chateau Lafite-Rothschild 1982.  The Lafleur magnums together carry an upper estimate of
$65,000 while the Cheval Blanc double magnum is priced at as
much as $90,000 and the Lafite case has an upper estimate of
$35,000.  Investor appetite for Bordeaux after two price slumps in
the past five years has boosted the London-based Liv-ex Fine
Wine 50 Index by 10 percent since November, when it touched its
lowest level since March 2010. A 0.3 percent gain in March was
its fourth straight increase and followed a February advance of
2.9 percent.  While merchants’ attention is focused on the 2012 wines
just coming to market, selected older vintages between 1998 and
2008 “represent the cheapest way to access some of the great
brands of Bordeaux,”  Miles Davis , partner at Wine Asset
Managers LLP, said this week in an e-mailed monthly report.  The Cheval Blanc double magnum, reviewed by the chateau,
comes from the vintage rated one of the top two of the past 65
years for the Saint-Emilion producer by U.S. wine critic  Robert
Parker . A 12-bottle case of the same wine sold for HK$1.23
million ($158,000) at a Zachys  Hong Kong  auction in January.  A case of Lafite 1982 sold for 28,750 pounds ($44,100)
including hammer price, at Bonhams in London this month.  Here is a list of global wine auctions scheduled so far
this year. Dates may be subject to revision, and links are to
