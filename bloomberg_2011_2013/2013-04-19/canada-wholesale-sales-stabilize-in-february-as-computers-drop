Canadian  wholesale sales 
unexpectedly stalled in February as drops in computers and
toiletries curbed gains at automobile dealers.  Wholesale sales remained at C$48.8 billion ($47.6 billion),
 Statistics Canada  said today in Ottawa, compared with the median
estimate for a 0.3 percent gain in a Bloomberg  survey  with 15
responses.  The  Bank of Canada  on April 17 cut its 2013 growth forecast
to 1.5 percent from 2 percent, citing weakness in business and
government spending. Governor  Mark Carney  still expects the pace
of growth to accelerate, led by investment and exports that
slumped late last year.  Computer and communications equipment sales dropped 8.2
percent to C$3.10 billion and toiletries fell by 8 percent to
C$633 million according to the report. Motor vehicle and parts
sales advanced by 3 percent to C$8.23 billion.  Statistics Canada today also revised its estimate of the
December sales decline to 1.5 percent from 1.1 percent and
boosted the January increase to 0.5 percent from 0.3 percent.
Those changes left the February sales total below the original
January reading of C$49 billion.  Inventories increased 0.6 percent to C$61.6 billion. The
inventory-to-sales  ratio , a measure of how many months it would
take to deplete stocks at the current sales pace, was unchanged
at 1.26 in February.  Wholesale sales were 0.8 percent higher in February than
the same month  a year earlier .  To contact the editors responsible for this story:
