Galenika AD, Serbia’s state-run
drugmaker, cut its net loss by more than half last year on
reduced writedowns as its accumulated debt exceeded assets.  The Zemun, Serbia-based pharmaceutical company reported a
2012 net loss of 5.6 billion dinars ($65.8 million) from 13.5
billion dinars a year earlier, on revenue of 4.8 billion dinars,
according to a regulatory filing to the  Serbian Business
Registers Agency .  Writedowns related to overdue claims fell almost 87 percent
to 1.37 billion dinars, while liabilities at 24.26 billion
dinars exceeded assets by 3.8 billion dinars.  Serbia’s government picked a unit of  Canada ’s  Valeant
Pharmaceuticals International Inc (VRX)  as the only potential bidder
for Galenika among five interested companies in a tender.
Valeant Pharmaceuticals North America Llc has until April 30 to
submit an offer.  To contact the reporter on this story:
