Airline trade groups seeking to
block budget-driven furloughs of air-traffic controllers said in
a lawsuit against the  U.S. Federal Aviation Administration  that
the planned cutbacks are based on a flawed reading of the law.  The furloughs of controllers, which the FAA says are
required under automatic budget cuts known as sequestration,
would reduce aviation system capacity and hurt the economy,
according to the suit, filed yesterday in the U.S. Court of
Appeals in Washington.  “The capacity reduction plan requires a blanket 10 percent
cut in hours across the board, with no consideration of the
impacts on the traveling public or the air transportation,” the
trade groups, joined by the Air Line Pilots Association
International, said in their petition.  Groups filing the suit are  Airlines for America , the trade
group representing major U.S. airlines and the Regional Airline
Association.  The case is Airlines for America v. Federal Aviation
Administration, 13-1140, U.S. Court of Appeals for the District
of Columbia ( Washington ).  To contact the reporter on this story:
