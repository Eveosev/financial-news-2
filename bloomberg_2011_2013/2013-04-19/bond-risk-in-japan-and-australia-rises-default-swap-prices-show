The cost of insuring corporate
bonds in  Japan  and  Australia  against non-payment increased,
according to traders of credit-default swaps.  The Markit iTraxx Japan index advanced 2.5 basis points to
95.5 basis points as of 9:45 a.m. in  Tokyo , according to
Citigroup Inc. prices. The benchmark is set to close at its
highest level since April 5, according to data provider CMA.  The Markit iTraxx Australia index rose 1 basis point to
116.5 as of 10:12 a.m. in Sydney, according to Westpac Banking
Corp. prices. The measure, which has ranged from 102.3 to 127.5
this year, is poised to close at its highest level since April
8, according to CMA, which is owned by McGraw-Hill Cos. and
compiles prices quoted by dealers in the private market.  The Markit iTraxx Asia index of 40 investment-grade
borrowers outside Japan was little changed at 116.5 basis points
as of 8:14 a.m. in  Hong Kong , Australia & New Zealand Banking
Group Ltd. prices show. The gauge rose for five straight days
through yesterday, CMA data show.  Credit-default swap indexes are benchmarks for insuring
bonds against default and traders use them to speculate on
 credit quality . A drop signals improving perceptions of
creditworthiness, while an increase suggests the opposite.  The swap contracts pay the buyer face value in exchange for
the underlying securities if a borrower fails to meet its debt
agreements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
