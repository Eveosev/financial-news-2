Flybe Group Plc (FLYB) ,  Europe ’s biggest
regional airline, predicted an underlying pretax loss for the
last financial year at the low end of its guidance on sales that
are little changed.  Costs for the financial year ended March 31 rose about 2.5
percent in line with guidance, the Exeter, England-based carrier
said in a statement today. Group revenue will be in line with
that of last year, when it was 615.3 million pounds ($943
million), it said.  Flybe Chief Executive Officer Jim French announced details
of a cost-reduction plan in January. The airline’s regional
focus means Flybe has higher unit costs and fares than discount
carriers such as  Ryanair Holdings Plc (RYA)  and  EasyJet Plc. (EZJ)   “The group has been taking significant actions to restore
profitability,” Flybe said today in the statement. Initial
cost-cutting efforts should allow the airline to beat a 25
million-pound target in the current year, it said.  The airline ended the financial year with 54.4 million
pounds in cash.  Flybe shares have declined 18 percent this year in London
trading, giving the company a market value of 31.6 million
pounds.  To contact the reporter on this story:
