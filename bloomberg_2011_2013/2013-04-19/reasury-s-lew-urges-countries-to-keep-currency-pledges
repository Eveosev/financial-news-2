U.S. Treasury Secretary Jacob J. Lew said the world economy will stay weak unless countries,
especially in emerging  Asia , boost spending, pursue flexible
exchange rates and avoid competitive devaluation of currencies.  “In the absence of offsetting demand growth from surplus
economies, overall global growth will remain weak,” Lew said
today in a statement to an  International Monetary Fund 
committee.  Many countries, “especially in emerging Asia,” should
“move more rapidly toward market-determined  exchange rate 
systems and exchange rate flexibility to reflect underlying
fundamentals, avoid persistent exchange rate misalignments, and
refrain from competitive devaluation of currencies,” he said.
“Countries must also fulfill their commitment not to target
exchange rates.”  In China, the process of exchange-rate adjustment “remains
incomplete and more progress is needed,” Lew said. “Sustaining
this progress will require further efforts to boost household
demand and reinvigorate the move to market determination of the
exchange rate and  interest rates .”  Lew urged the International Monetary Fund to do its part in
its surveillance over members’ exchange-rate policies, which
remains at the “core of the fund’s mandate.”  “There continues to be a need for a more rigorous emphasis
on excessive foreign exchange intervention and reserves
accumulation in bilateral surveillance,” Lew said.  “We
encourage all IMF members to be transparent with respect to
foreign exchange intervention and reserves composition.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
