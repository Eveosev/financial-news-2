The yield on  Indonesia ’s two-year
government bonds dropped for a second week as speculation
inflation will quicken spurred demand for shorter-dated debt.
The rupiah was little changed.  Indonesia may raise gasoline prices for privately owned
cars by around 50 percent to cut fuel subsidies, Energy and
Mineral Resources Minister Jero Wacik said April 16. Consumer
prices rose 5.9 percent in March from a year earlier, the
biggest increase in 22 months, official data show. Foreign
investors pumped the most money into rupiah-denominated notes
last week since 2011 as Japanese funds sought higher yields with
cash generated by central bank stimulus.  “Quickening inflation pressures are making investors
search for shorter tenors, so the yields are going down
further,” said Herdi Wibowo, head of debt capital markets in
Jakarta at PT BCA Sekuritas, a unit of the nation’s largest bank
by market value.  The yield on the 11 percent bonds due October 2014 dropped
five basis points, or 0.05 percentage point, this week to 4.38
percent as of 4:08 p.m. in Jakarta, according to prices from the
Inter Dealer Market Association. The yield was little changed
today. The rate on 10-year notes declined two basis points this
week to 5.45 percent.  Overseas investors bought 6.2 trillion rupiah ($643 million)
more local-currency sovereign notes than they sold last week,
finance ministry data show, after the Bank of Japan said on
April 4 that it would buy 7.5 trillion yen ($76 billion) of debt
per month.  Rupiah Strengthens  The rupiah strengthened 0.1 percent today and was steady
this week at 9,713 per dollar, according to prices from local
banks compiled by Bloomberg. It traded at a 0.1 percent premium
to one-month non-deliverable forwards, which rose 0.3 percent to
9,720 today, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  A daily  fixing  used to settle the derivatives was set at
9,708 by the Association of Banks in  Singapore  from 9,721
yesterday. One-month implied volatility, a measure of expected
moves in the exchange rate used to price options, increased four
basis points to 5.84 percent. It fell three basis points this
week.  To contact the reporter on this story:
