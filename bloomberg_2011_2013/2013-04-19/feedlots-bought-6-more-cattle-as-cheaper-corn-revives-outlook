U.S. feedlot owners
unexpectedly increased the number of cattle added to their
herds in March compared with a year earlier as a drop in
corn costs improved prospects for an end to operating
losses.  About 1.899 million head of cattle entered  feedlots ,
up 6 percent from 1.792 million in March 2012, the  U.S.
Department of Agriculture  said today in a report. Thirteen
analysts surveyed by  Bloomberg News  forecast a 1.5 percent
decrease, on average. The feedlot herd totaled 10.909
million as of April 1, down 5 percent from a year earlier.
Analysts expected the inventory on feed to be 5.8 percent
lower.  The price of corn, the main ingredient in livestock
feed, declined 1.2 percent in March and prices tumbled into
a  bear market  this month after the government said March 28
that inventories will be bigger than analysts forecast and
farmers will plant the most acres this year since 1936.  “The feedlots were anxious to put in feeders with
corn values drifting lower and in anticipation of lower
values,”  Don Roose , the president of U.S. Commodities Inc.
in  West Des Moines ,  Iowa , said in a telephone interview.
“We think the outlook for profitability and bottom line
was better.”  Feedlot operators typically buy year-old animals that
weigh 500 pounds (227 kilograms) to 800 pounds, called
feeders. The cattle are fattened on corn for four to five
months until they weigh about 1,300 pounds, when they are
sold to meatpackers.  Feedlots sold about 1.771 million animals to
meatpackers last month, down 7.7 percent from a year
earlier, the USDA said. Analysts expected a 6.1 percent
drop, on average.  Cattle futures for June delivery fell 0.5 percent to
$1.20775 a pound at 11:39 a.m. on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange. The price is down 8.3 percent this year through
yesterday.  Feeder-cattle futures for August settlement declined 1
percent to $1.4575 a pound. Prices were down 4.6 percent in
2013 through yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
