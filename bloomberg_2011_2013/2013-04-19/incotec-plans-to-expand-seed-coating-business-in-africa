Incotec Group BV, a Dutch seed-
technology company, will use a facility it opened in  South
Africa  last month as a base from which to expand its business on
the continent, Sales Director Derek Jones said.  “We are signing agreements with Zimbabwe, Zambia,
Mozambique, Malawi, Kenya and Tanzania for seed-coating
services,” he said by phone yesterday. The 13 million-rand ($1
million) plant is in Pietermaritzburg, KwaZulu-Natal.  Coating seeds with insecticides and fungicides is a way of
protecting seeds to improve crop yields. Kenya is the world’s
largest exporter of black tea and supplies a third of the cut
flowers sold in Europe. South  Africa  is the continent’s biggest
grower of corn. Nations from Nigeria to  Ethiopia  are investing
to expand sugar output, while Malawi and Zambia are increasing
corn production.  Incotec is also starting analytical services for growers
across Africa, Asia and the U.S., said Tertia Erasmus, the
general manager of the company’s African unit.  “There are only three sites in the world that are able to
offer DNA testing services,” she said in a telephone interview
yesterday. “Our African facility will offer genetic testing for
breeding, genetic markers, and genetically modified
organization’s certification for ornamental, vegetable and crop
seeds.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
