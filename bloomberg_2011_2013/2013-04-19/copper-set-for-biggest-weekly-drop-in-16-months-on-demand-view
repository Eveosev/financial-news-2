Copper fell in  New York , heading
for the biggest weekly drop in 16 months and a bear market, on
concern that slowing economies from  China  to the U.S. will
reduce demand as stockpiles of the metal expand.  China’s economy  has grown by less than 8 percent in the
past four quarters, the longest streak in at least 20 years. An
index of leading U.S. economic indicators unexpectedly fell, a
private report showed yesterday. Copper inventories tracked by
the London Metal Exchange have almost doubled in 2013.  “The increase in copper stocks gives reason to think
supplies are plentiful, and China’s growth is not what people
expected it to be,” Harry Denny, a broker at Hoboken, New
Jersey-based PVM Futures Inc., said in a telephone interview
yesterday. “The market is well-supplied, and we’re going to
continue to see pressure on prices.”  Copper futures for delivery in July tumbled 1.6 percent to
$3.167 a pound at 12:35 p.m. on the Comex in New York, heading
for a weekly drop of 5.5 percent, the biggest since Dec. 16,
2011. A close under $3.1828 would be 20 percent below the
February 2012 peak, meeting the common definition of a  bear
market .  Exceed Demand  Production will exceed demand by 341,000 metric tons this
year, more than last year’s 238,000 tons, according to Citigroup
Inc. LME  stockpiles  have jumped 92 percent to 614,350 tons this
year, exchange figures showed.  Inventories monitored by the Shanghai Futures Exchange
declined to 223,663 tons this week, bourse data showed today.
Bonded warehouses in the country hold 600,000 tons of copper,
used in pipes and wiring, Paul Crone, chief investment officer
at Citrine Capital Management LCC, said April 17.  On the LME, copper for delivery in three months slid 1.5
percent to $6,983.75 a ton ($3.17 a pound).  Aluminum, nickel and zinc also fell in  London . Lead and tin
gained.  To contact the reporters on this story:
