Law enforcement officials believe
there’s a strong possibility that a suspect captured near  Boston 
after the fatal shooting of a police officer is linked to this
week’s terror bombings, according to a federal official.  The  Federal Bureau  of Investigation is now trying to
identify whether individuals involved in the violence overnight
are the suspects depicted in images the agency released
yesterday from the April 15 attack on the Boston Marathon,
according to the official, who asked not to be identified in
discussing an active criminal probe.   The official said that law enforcement authorities are
urging caution as police continue to work on processing the
night’s crime scenes.   To contact the reporter on this story:
