The bombing suspect police have been chasing through the Boston area attended a prestigious public high school in Cambridge,  Massachusetts , that educated actor-director  Ben Affleck  and basketball player  Patrick Ewing .  Dzhokar Tsarnaev, 19, who  police  are seeking for the  Boston Marathon bombings  that killed three people and injured dozens, went to  Cambridge Rindge and Latin School , which is known for its eclectic, diverse student body. His brother Tamerlan was killed last night as the two tried to evade police.  Dzhokar Tsarnaev wrestled and received a scholarship from the city of Cambridge while attending Rindge and Latin, a school with links to  Harvard University  and roots that go almost as deep.  “The first public schools in the town were connected to  Harvard College  and were seen as places to prepare male students for higher education,” according to the school website. “Over a period of three centuries educational philosophies, funding and community commitment to public education have changed and evolved. Cambridge Rindge and Latin School is a reflection of the progress of the past three centuries.”  Schools are closed for vacation in Cambridge this week, and school officials didn’t answer the phone.  Abundant Offerings  Rindge and Latin’s course catalog includes offerings in modern dance, studio/portfolio art and cultural anthropology along with college preparatory options in chemistry, math, physics and other subjects. The school has more than 1,500 students and 171 staff.  A list posted on the school website says that Rindge and Latin sent its 2012 graduates to dozens of colleges across the U.S., including Harvard,  Dartmouth College ,  Cornell University  and  Stanford University .  Students don’t have to pass a test to enroll in the school. All Cambridge Public School eighth graders are automatically registered, according to the city website.  Agustin Nedina, 18, who also attended the high school, said he wasn’t close to Tsarnaev. Nedina said the bombing suspect played video games and had a number of good friends. At the same time, Tsarnaev also worked as a lifeguard at a Harvard swimming pool, the university said in an e-mail.  Won Scholarship  Tsarnaev received a $2,500 scholarship from Cambridge in 2011 when he was a senior at Rindge and Latin to pursue higher education, according to the  cambridgema.gov  website.  “It’s a highly diverse, high-quality public high school,” said Jon Reider, head of college counseling at San Francisco’s University High School, who worked as an admissions officer for Stanford about 15 years ago. “I always respected it and took kids from there for Stanford with regularity.”  Tsarnaev is now registered as a student at the  University of Massachusetts , Dartmouth, said Rob Lamontagne, a spokesman. He referred all further questions to the  Federal Bureau  of Investigation.  Edward Estlin Cummings, the poet known more widely as E.E. Cummings, studied Latin and Greek at the school when it was called Cambridge Latin High School, according to the poets.org website. Cummings went on to study at Harvard and later published several works of poetry and prose work, including “The Enormous Room,” an account of his internment in a French prison camp for suspected espionage.  Affleck directed “Argo,” the story of the rescue of U.S. diplomats during the 1979 Iran hostage crisis, which won a 2013 Academy Award for Best Picture. He and  Matt Damon , also a Rindge and Latin alumnus, co-wrote and acted in “Good Will Hunting” in 1997, which catapulted their careers. Damon has starred in a number of films, including the “Bourne” action series.  Ewing, who was born in  Jamaica , and played in the  National Basketball Association  from 1985 to 2002, spending most of his career with the  New York  Knicks.  Harvard, founded in 1636, is the oldest U.S. college.
