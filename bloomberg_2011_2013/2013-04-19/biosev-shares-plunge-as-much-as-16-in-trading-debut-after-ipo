Biosev SA (BSEV3) , Louis Dreyfus Holding
BV’s  Brazil  unit, tumbled in its debut after giving investors in
its initial public offering a money-back guarantee.  The shares dropped 14 percent to 12.85 reais at the close
of trading in Sao Paulo after earlier sinking as much as 16
percent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The benchmark
Bovespa  index  gained 1.4 percent.  Brazil’s second-largest sugar-cane processor raised 805
million reais ($400 million) by selling shares for 15 reais
apiece and put options for 25 centavos that allow investors to
return the stock for 16.57 reais over the next 15 months,
according to an April 15 prospectus. Louis Dreyfus, based in
Amsterdam, controls Biosev through three companies and bought
100 million reais of stock in the offering.  The controlling shareholders’ purchase sent “a bad signal
to the market,” Luiz Roberto Monteiro, a broker at Renascenca
DTVM, said in a telephone interview from  Sao Paulo . “The
feeling is that the IPO was overpriced.”  Biosev was planning to raise as much as 945 million reais
in the stock offering, according to an April 10 preliminary
prospectus.  Two other companies have held IPOs in Brazil this year
after the country in 2012 had the fewest offerings since 2003,
data compiled by Bloomberg show. Senior Solution SA, which
 priced  shares below the expected range, has gained 0.6 percent
since its debut. Software maker Linx SA, which priced shares at
the top of its expected range, is up 18 percent since it started
trading.  Cosan SA Industria & Comercio is Brazil’s largest sugar-
cane processor.  To contact the reporters on this story:
