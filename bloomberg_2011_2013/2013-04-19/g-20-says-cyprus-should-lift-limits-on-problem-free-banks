Global finance ministers urged
Cyprus to allow problem-free banks to resume transactions on
frozen accounts, saying strict limits on banks are hurting the
country’s economy, according to Russian Finance Minister Anton Siluanov.  Cyprus reached an agreement with euro-zone governments in
March to impose losses on uninsured depositors at the country’s
two biggest banks,  Bank of Cyprus Plc (BOCY)  and  Cyprus Popular Bank
Pcl (CPB) , as part of negotiations for the 10 billion-euro ($13.1
billion) rescue of its financial system. The country’s banks
were shut for almost two weeks to avoid capital flight before
reopening March 28 with controls limiting financial
transactions.  “The way the problems are being addressed in Cyprus has
cast doubt on the trustworthiness of its economic policies,”
Siluanov said during a press conference after Group of 20
meetings in Washington yesterday. “The sooner we solve that
problem and remove all the limits on transaction, the faster the
banking system will revive, and so will the economy of Cyprus.”  Last week Siluanov said that  Russia , which holds the
rotating presidency of G-20 this year, plans to discuss ideas
for an early-warning mechanism to prevent future Cyprus-like
crises.  To contact the reporter on this story:
