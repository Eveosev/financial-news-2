Sanderson Farms Inc. (SAFM)  Chief
Operating Officer Lampkin Butts said this summer “looks like it
will be a good market” for chicken, helped by rising prices for
other meats.  Most chicken firms are profitable after prices improved, he
said today at a chicken industry conference in North Carolina.
Higher costs for animal feed such as corn and soybean meal and
the worst U.S drought since the 1930s have shrunk beef cattle
herds and consumers are starting to buy more chicken.  “We are feeling better demand,” Butts said today in a
presentation. “Our customers attribute that to the price of
beef and pork.”  Sanderson, which is based in Laurel, Mississippi, is the
third-largest U.S. chicken producer.  Tyson Foods Inc. (TSN)  and  JBS
SA (JBSS3) ’s  Pilgrim’s Pride Corp. (PPC)  are the two biggest.  To contact the reporter on this story:
