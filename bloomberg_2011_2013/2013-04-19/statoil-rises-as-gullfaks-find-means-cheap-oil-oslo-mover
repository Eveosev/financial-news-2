Statoil ASA (STL) ,  Norway ’s biggest oil
and gas producer, rose from an 18-month low after a new find in
the 27-year-old Gullfaks field in the  North Sea  raises prospects
of cheaper oil.  The shares rose as much as 2.3 percent, the most since Feb.
7, and were up 2 percent at 136.2 kroner as of 12:13 p.m. in
Oslo, after yesterday trading at the lowest intraday level since
October 2011. About 1.7 million shares have traded so far today,
or 54 percent of the three-month average daily volume.  Statoil estimates the discovery to hold 40 million to 150
million recoverable barrels of oil equivalent at a shallower
level than existing Brent deposits in the license, it said in a
statement today. While the estimates are still uncertain, a well
test indicates good flow rates, Statoil said.  “The development can be conducted relatively quickly and
very cheaply compared to an average North Sea oil field
development,” analysts at Pareto Securities AS said in a note.
The find may be worth as much as $15 a barrel of oil equivalent,
or 1 krone to 3 kroner a share, according to the Oslo-based
investment bank.  Interest in the North Sea, where crude output has halved
since 2000, has been renewed after Statoil and  Lundin Petroleum
AB (LUPE)  found oil at the Johan Sverdrup field, which may hold 1.7
billion to 3.3 billion barrels of oil equivalent. Statoil is
seeking to boost production by a quarter to 2.5 million barrels
of oil equivalent a day in 2020.  Statoil is the operator of the license with a 70 percent
stake, while Petoro AS holds 30 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
