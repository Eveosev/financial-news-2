Russian  stocks  rose for the first
time in seven days, paring their weekly decline, as crude oil
climbed and a technical indicator signaled the index is
oversold.  The  Micex Index (INDEXCF)  added 0.5 percent to 1,341.44 by 10:44 a.m.
in Moscow, poised for a 3.2 percent drop in the week. Russian
equities have the cheapest valuations on an estimated price
basis among 21  emerging markets  tracked by Bloomberg.  Crude,  Russia ’s chief export, increased for the second day,
adding 0.8 percent to $88.44 per barrel in  New York . The Micex’s
14-day  relative strength index  was at 24. A value below 30
signals the gauge is oversold and may be due for a rebound.  Oil producer OAO Bashneft rose 2.5 percent, while OAO
 Mechel (MTLR) , Russia’s biggest coking coal producer, added 1.4
percent. OAO Sberbank, Russia’s biggest lender, increased 1
percent to 96.36 rubles. The S&P GSCI Spot Index of commodities
traded up 0.5 percent. The dollar-denominated  RTS Index (RTSI$)  advanced
1.2 percent to 1,343.30.  The amount of shares traded on the Micex was 77 percent
above the 30-day average, while 10-day price swings on the index
declined to 14.21.  The Micex trades at 5 times estimated earnings and has lost
9.1 percent this year, compared with 10.4 times for the  MSCI
Emerging Markets Index (MXEF) , which has slid 4.7 percent in the
period.  The RTS Volatility Index, which measures expected swings in
 stock futures , tumbled 4.6 percent to 23.37 today. The Market
Vectors Russia ETF, the largest dedicated Russian exchange-
traded fund, rose 0.9 percent to 25.69 yesterday, while the
 Bloomberg Russia-US Equity Index (RUS14BN)  added 1.2 percent to 90.42.  To contact the reporter on this story:
