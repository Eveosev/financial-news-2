Rubber climbed the most in more
than a week, recovering from a five-month low, as a weakening
Japanese currency boosted investor demand for the commodity used
in tires.  Rubber for delivery in September gained as much as 2.4
percent to 251 yen a kilogram ($2,556 a metric ton) on the  Tokyo 
Commodity Exchange. That was the biggest intraday gain for the
most-active contract since April 9. Futures traded at 248.6 yen
by 11:13 a.m. local time, after closing at 245.2 yen yesterday,
the lowest since Nov. 13. Prices fell 11 percent in the past
five sessions and are headed for a 10 percent drop this week.  The yen declined against most of the currencies of its 16
major trading partners before the  Bank of Japan  meets next week
amid expectations Governor Haruhiko Kuroda will push ahead with
expanding stimulus. West Texas Intermediate crude rose for a
second day, after advancing the most in three weeks yesterday.
Crude oil is used to make synthetic rubber.  “The weakening yen supported rubber, which also tracked
gains in other commodities,” said Gu Jiong, an analyst at
commodity broker Yutaka Shoji Co. Optimism that  Japan ’s central
bank may add more stimulus also improved  market sentiment , he
said by phone from Tokyo.  The BOJ meets on April 26 after pledging this month to
double the monetary base in two years through expanded purchases
of  government bonds  in a bid to end 15 years of deflation.  Rubber for September delivery on the Shanghai Futures
Exchange gained 1.4 percent to 18,980  yuan  ($3,072) a ton after
falling by the bourse’s daily-price limit yesterday.  Thai rubber free-on-board lost 3 percent to 79.50 baht
($2.77) a kilogram yesterday, the lowest since October 2009,
according to Rubber Research Institute of Thailand data.  To contact the reporter on this story:
