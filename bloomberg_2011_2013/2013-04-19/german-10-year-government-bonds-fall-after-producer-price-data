fell as a report showed  producer prices  in  Europe ’s largest
economy declined for a second month in March.  The benchmark 10-year bund yield was about four basis
points from the  lowest  level in more than eight months. Producer
prices fell 0.2 percent from February, when they dropped 0.1
percent, the Federal Statistics Office in Wiesbaden said.
