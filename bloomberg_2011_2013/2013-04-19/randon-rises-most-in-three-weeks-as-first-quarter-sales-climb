Randon Participacoes SA (RAPT4) , a
Brazilian auto parts maker, rose after reporting an increase in
first-quarter sales.  Shares gained 1.6 percent to 12.50 reais at the close of
trading in  Sao Paulo , after earlier rising as much as 3.9
percent. The benchmark Bovespa Index  gained  1.4 percent.  The Caxias do Sul-based company’s first-quarter sales rose
33 percent to 974.9 million reais ($485 million), according to a
regulatory filing today. That  compares  with an estimate of 893
million reais, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The report “confirms our expectation of revenues
recovery,” Lucas Marquiori, an analyst at Banco Safra SA, wrote
in a research note to clients. Randon also will probably post an
improvement in margins as pricing in its trailers business and
volumes in auto parts increase, Marquiori wrote.  Randon has lost 1.5 percent this year while the Bovespa
lost 12 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
