Harvard University  and the  Massachusetts Institute of Technology  are both closed today following a fatal shooting of an MIT police officer and the continuing search for an armed suspect.  Other Boston-area universities including  Boston University ,  Boston College ,  Simmons College  and  Suffolk University  are also closed, according to their websites. Service on Boston’s subway system is suspended, according to the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority  website .  Students and staff at Harvard’s Cambridge and Alston campuses are advised by the local police department to stay indoors as police continue to search for a suspect, according to the university’s website.  MIT, also located in Cambridge, canceled classes following the death of the police officer, whose identity hasn’t been released, MIT said in a statement on its website. President Rafael Reif is returning to campus from an international trip and a gathering is being planned for later today.  The shooting of the officer occurred days after the April 15 bombing at the  Boston  Marathon that killed three and injured more than 170. A man killed by police and a second man being hunted have been identified by law enforcement authorities as the suspects in the terrorist bombings.  Gunshots were first reported at 10:48 p.m. near Building 32 at MIT, a computer science lab also called the Stata center, according to MIT’s website.
