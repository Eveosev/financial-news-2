Chancellor of the Exchequer  George Osborne  warned labor unions against taking coordinated action
against spending cuts that would risk damaging the U.K. economy.  Osborne was reacting to discussions among unions about the
possibility of a general strike to protest Prime Minister  David Cameron ’s austerity measures.  “What we want to do is avoid self-inflicted wounds like
the call for coordinated  strike action ,” Osborne told reporters
in Washington today. “Those responsible in the trade unions
should think twice about calling for coordinated strike action
at a time when our economy is recovering.”  The General Council of the Trades Union Congress, an
umbrella body for 6.2 million organized workers, will meet April
24 to continue talks about coordinated action, a spokesman said
by telephone.  Unite, which has 1.5 million members, has proposed a 24-
hour general strike, while Unison, which represents 1.3 million
public-sector workers, would consider joining the action as a
tactic that could be used at the end of a campaign of other
action, it said April 4.  To contact the reporters on this story:
