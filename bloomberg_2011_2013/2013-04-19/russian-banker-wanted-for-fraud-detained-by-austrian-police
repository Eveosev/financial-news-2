Austrian authorities detained
Alexander Gitelson, a Russian banker wanted in  Russia  for
fraud.  Police arrested Gitelson on April 12 at his home in Lower
 Austria , a province outside of Vienna, said Mario Hejl, a
spokesman for the  Austrian Federal Crime Agency . Gitelson, the
former owner of the Bank of East-European Finance Corp., was
sentenced to 5 years in jail by a Russian court in June 2011, he
said.  The 63-year-old banker, who is wanted by St. Petersburg
prosecutors, “is in detention waiting for extradition,” Hejl
said today in a telephone interview. Gitelson will be held in
Vienna until a formal request for extradition to Russia has been
received, said Dagmar Albegger, a spokeswoman for Austria’s
 justice ministry .  Gitelson’s lawyers didn’t immediately return phone calls
and a message seeking comment. Gitelson is suspected of major
fraud involving state funds and has been investigated in several
cases,  according  to the Russian Legal Information Agency.  To contact the reporter on this story:
