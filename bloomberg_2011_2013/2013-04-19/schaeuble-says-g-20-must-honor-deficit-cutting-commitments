German Finance Minister  Wolfgang Schaeuble  said finance chiefs meeting in  Washington  this week
mustn’t lessen their efforts to make the international financial
system more resilient against crises and stabilize public
finances long term.  The meeting in Washington is a welcome opportunity to
remember the commitments made at Group of 20 leaders’ meetings
in recent years, including in Toronto in 2010, and develop them
further, Schaeuble told reporters on his way to Washington.  Europe has made progress on its way toward a “stability
union” and is adhering to its international obligations, he
said. Europe’s economic policy changes have laid the foundation
for lasting growth, he said.  The European Union has made funds available to tackle
problems including “unbearably high” youth unemployment and to
improve public infrastructure, Schaeuble said. He said he’ll use
the opportunity of the Washington meeting to seek support for
German efforts to fight  tax evasion  and the erosion of the tax
base.  To contact the reporter on this story:
