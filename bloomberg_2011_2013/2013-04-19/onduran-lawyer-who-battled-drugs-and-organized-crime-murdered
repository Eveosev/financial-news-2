A Honduran lawyer who worked in a
special unit of the Public Prosecutor’s office to combat
organized crime was killed in the capital of Tegucigalpa,
according to a statement by the presidential palace.  Orlan Arturo Chavez was shot and killed yesterday while
driving his pick-up truck after leaving  Honduras ’s National
Autonomous University, where he taught classes, according to
Tegucigalpa-based newspaper La Prensa. No suspects have yet been
identified, the presidency said.  Honduras has one of the world’s highest homicide rates,
with 86 out of every 100,000 citizens suffering violent deaths
in 2012, according to the Violence Observatory at Honduras’s
National Autonomous University. Much of the violence is
attributed to drug-trafficking. About 79 percent of cocaine
smuggling flights to the U.S. from South America first land in
Honduras, according to a State Department report last year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
