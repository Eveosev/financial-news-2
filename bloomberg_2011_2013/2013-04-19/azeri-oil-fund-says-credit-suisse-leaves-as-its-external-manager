Azerbaijan’s State Oil Fund said
 Credit Suisse Group AG (CSGN)  “discontinued” providing services as
its external manager effective Feb. 28.  The Swiss bank served as one of five external managers for
Sofaz, as the Azeri fund is known, according to its 2012
consolidated financial  statement  published on its website. It
didn’t say why the relationship had ended.  A Sofaz spokeswoman, Jamala Aliyeva, didn’t immediately
respond to an e-mailed request for comment. Adam Bradbery, a
spokesman for Credit Suisse in  London , declined to comment when
contacted by phone.  Sofaz was established in 1999 to manage the Caspian Sea
nation’s income from the sale of oil and natural gas. Its assets
grew 0.6 percent from the end of last year to $34.3 billion on
April 1.  To contact the reporter on this story:
