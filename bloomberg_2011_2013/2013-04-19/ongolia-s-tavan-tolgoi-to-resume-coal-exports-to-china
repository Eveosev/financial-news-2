Erdenes Tavan Tolgoi LLC,
Mongolia’s largest state-owned coal company, will resume
shipments to  China  next week, ending a three month stand-off
with its biggest customer, Mongolia’s Prime Minister Norovyn Altankhuyag said.  The breakthrough follows negotiations with its main
customer, Aluminum Corp. of China Ltd., or Chalco, according to
a government press statement on the prime minister’s comments in
parliament today.  Exports to Chalco, China’s biggest producer of aluminum,
stopped on Jan. 11 due to a lack of funds required to pay
Altangovi, which provides warehousing services at the border
with China. The chief executive officer of Erdenes TT, Yaichil Batsuuri, said his company had run into financial trouble and
wanted to raise prices and cut shipments, changing the terms of
the $250 million contract it signed in July 2011.  “The prime minister said Mongolia will begin shipments of
coal from next week,” according to the press statement. They
will include 337,000 metric tons of coal held at the border and
1 million tons at the Tavan Tolgoi coal field, Mongolia’s
largest.  Erdenes TT is one of three companies operating at Tavan
Tolgoi, which contains 6.4 billion tons of reserves. The company
declined to comment on details of its negotiations with Chalco.  Mongolia has informed the company that the nation is
resuming coal exports to China, Cheng Zhiqiang, Chalco’s deputy
general manager of international trade, said by phone. He
declined to comment on whether any terms of the supply contract
with Erdenes TT had changed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
