European stocks  advanced, paring
their biggest weekly decline since November, as the region’s
commodity producers rebounded from a 3 1/2-year low.  Eurasian Natural Resources Corp. posted its biggest gain
since 2008 after one of the founding shareholders said he may
offer to buy the company.  L’Oreal SA (OR)  climbed 4.3 percent after
revenue exceeded analysts’ estimates. SAP AG retreated 3 percent
after the largest maker of business-management software reported
sales that trailed forecasts.  The  Stoxx Europe 600 Index (SXXP)  added 0.5 percent to 285.21 at
the close of trading in London, after earlier rallying as much
as 1 percent. The gauge has slipped 2.5 percent this week, its
biggest drop in five months, as commodities fell amid worse-
than-forecast  economic data  from China and the U.S.  “I believe in the growth story,” said Kevin Lilley, who
helps oversee about $6.1 billion as a fund manager at Old Mutual
Asset Managers U.K. in London. “I have been adding some
cyclicality to my portfolio. We reached all-time highs in the
U.S. equity market at a time when some of the economic data has
been slightly disappointing, so it’s not surprising that the
market has taken a breather this week.”  National benchmark indexes climbed in 15 of the 18 western-
European markets. The U.K.’s FTSE 100 rose 0.7 percent, while
 France ’s CAC 40 climbed 1.5 percent.  Germany ’s DAX retreated 0.2
percent.  Italy ’s FTSE MIB Index increased 1.8 percent, while
 Portugal ’s PSI 20 Index jumped 2.6 percent.  ENRC, Kazakhmys  ENRC surged 27 percent to 291 pence after  Alexander Machkevitch  said he may form a consortium with fellow
shareholders Alijan Ibragimov, Patokh Chodiev and the Kazakh
government to make an offer for ENRC.  Kazakhmys Plc, which owns a 26 percent stake in ENRC,
soared 24 percent to 385.7 pence.  Anglo American Plc gained 2.2 percent to 1,596.5 pence
after reporting that first-quarter production at its Kumba Iron
Ore Ltd. unit in South Africa increased 2 percent from a year
earlier. The metal producer also said that its output of
metallurgical coal for export rose 23 percent, while copper
production climbed 1 percent.  Rio Tinto Group added 1.5 percent to 2,920 pence as the
world’s second-largest raw-materials producer helped lift a
gauge of  mining companies  from its lowest level since July 2009.
Vedanta Resources Plc, the Indian metals producer run by
billionaire Anil Agarwal, rose 6.1 percent to 1,151 pence.  L’Oreal gained 4.3 percent to 126.40 euros in Paris after
the world’s largest cosmetics maker reported a 5.1 percent
increase in  first-quarter revenue  to 5.93 billion euros ($7.8
billion) as demand for luxury brands helped counter weakness in
professional products. The average of six estimates compiled by
Bloomberg had called for sales of 5.85 billion euros.  LVMH, Burberry  LVMH  Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton (MC)  SA rose 2.1 percent to
123.30 euros after Goldman Sachs Group Inc. added the luxury-
goods maker to its conviction buy list, saying the stock’s
underperformance presented an opportunity to invest. The shares
 fell 8 percent  from April 15 through yesterday after the company
reported the slowest growth in sales of fashion and leather
products since 2009.  Burberry Group Plc (BRBY)  climbed 1.4 percent to 1,299 pence.
Goldman Sachs also added the U.K.’s largest luxury-goods maker
to its conviction buy list. The brokerage said that Burberry’s
fundamentals remain robust.  Banco Popolare SC led Italian lenders higher as the
country’s 10-year bond yields declined. Popolare rallied 7
percent to 1.05 euros in Milan. Banca Popolare di Milano Scrl
increased 4.7 percent to 52.4 euro cents. And  UniCredit SpA (UCG) ,
 Italy’s biggest bank , climbed 3.6 percent to 3.63 euros.  William Hill  William Hill Plc added 4.7 percent to 409.1 pence after the
U.K. bookmaker reported a 15 percent jump in first-quarter
revenue. Online net sales rose 21 percent. Chief Executive
Officer Ralph Topping said gross-win margins both online and in
its shops remained strong.  In Germany, SAP slid 3 percent to 57.85 euros after posting
a 3 percent increase in first-quarter sales of new software
licenses, an indicator of future revenue, to 657 million euros.
That missed the average analyst estimate of 726 million euros
after the company failed to close contracts in the Asia-Pacific
region.  Commerzbank AG lost 2.2 percent to 1.14 euros as Germany’s
second-biggest bank predicted that it will report a first-
quarter loss because of staff-reduction costs. The lender made
its forecast in a statement at its annual shareholders’ meeting.
Chief Executive Officer  Martin Blessing  said he expects lower
net-interest income in 2013 than in 2012.  TeliaSonera, Elisa  TeliaSonera AB (TLSN)  lost 2.1 percent to 42.47 kronor after
 Sweden ’s biggest phone company reported  first-quarter net income 
of 4.11 billion kronor ($629 million), little changed from a
year earlier.  Analysts had predicted  4.32 billion kronor of
profit, according to the average of 15 estimates compiled by
Bloomberg. Sales fell 4.4 percent.  Elisa Oyj dropped 6 percent to 13.44 euros after  Finland ’s
largest wireless carrier by subscribers reported first-quarter
sales and net income that fell short of analysts’ estimates. The
company also cut its full-year earnings forecast.  Spectris Plc tumbled 14 percent to 1,908 pence, the biggest
plunge on the Stoxx 600, after the maker of production-testing
gear lowered its revenue-growth forecast.  To contact the reporter on this story:
