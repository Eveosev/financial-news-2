The pound strengthened against the
dollar and euro after  Bank of England  Governor-designate Mark Carney yesterday failed to signal that the central bank will
expand stimulus measures that typically debase a currency.  Carney, the current chief of the  Bank of Canada , will
succeed  Mervyn King  at the U.K. central bank on July 1, taking
over an institution endowed with new responsibilities for
financial regulation as well as monetary policy. The Bank of
England kept its asset-purchase  target , or so-called
quantitative easing, at 375 billion pounds ($576 billion) on
April 4. Policy makers also left the key  interest rate  at a
record-low 0.5 percent. Gilts fell, snapping a two-day gain.  “The pound is up since Carney spoke,” said  Neil Jones ,
head of hedge fund sales at Mizuho Corporate Bank Ltd. in
 London . “The market was looking for something more on the QE
front. They did not get it.”  The pound gained for a second day versus the dollar, rising
0.5 percent to $1.5361 at 9:50 a.m. London time after climbing
0.3 percent yesterday. The U.K. currency strengthened 0.2
percent to 85.22 pence per euro.  Sterling has dropped 3.6 percent this year, the second-
worst performer among 10 developed-market currencies tracked by
Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes after the yen. The euro
advanced 1.8 percent and the dollar gained 2.6 percent.  The 10-year gilt yield rose three basis points, or 0.03
percentage point, to 1.68 percent after falling seven basis
points in the past two days. The 1.75 percent security maturing
September 2022 slipped 0.215, or 2.15 pounds per 1,000-pound
face amount, to 100.58.  U.K. gilts earned 1.9 percent this year through yesterday,
according to indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the European
Federation of Financial Analysts Societies. German bonds and
U.S. Treasuries returned 0.8 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
