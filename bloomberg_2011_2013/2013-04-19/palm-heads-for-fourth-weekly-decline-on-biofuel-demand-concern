Palm dropped for a fourth week on
concern losses in crude oil this week cut the lure of biofuels.  The contract for July delivery lost 0.6 percent to close at
2,294 ringgit ($756) a metric ton on the Bursa  Malaysia 
Derivatives. Futures declined 2.2 percent this week for a fourth
weekly decline, the longest losing streak since the four weeks
ended Dec. 14.  Palm oil, used in everything from candy to biofuels,
yesterday touched the lowest intraday price since December as
West Texas Intermediate crude reached a four-month low. WTI
futures gained today to trim a third weekly drop, the longest
run of such declines since November.  “As crude oil prices declined sharply recently, biodiesel
production may have dropped, reducing the demand for CPO,” said
Sim Han Qiang, an investment analyst at Phillip Futures Pte,
referring to crude palm oil by its initials. “If crude oil
prices continue their downtrend,” palm oil will be pressured,
he said in a report today.  Palm oil exports from Malaysia, the second-biggest
producer, fell 4 percent to 648,275 tons in the first 15 days of
April from the same period in March, Intertek said April 15.  Soybean oil for July delivery fell 0.5 percent to 49.42
cents a pound on the Chicago Board of Trade and soybeans dropped
0.2 percent to $13.87 a bushel.  Refined palm oil for September delivery rose 0.6 percent to
close at 6,120  yuan  ($991) a ton on the Dalian Commodity
Exchange, while soybean oil gained 0.5 percent to end at 7,620
yuan a ton.  To contact the reporter on this story:
