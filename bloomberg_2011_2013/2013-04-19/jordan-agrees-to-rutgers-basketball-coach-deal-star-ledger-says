Eddie Jordan has agreed to a five-
year contract worth more than $1 million a year to become the
next men’s basketball coach at  Rutgers University , the Star-
Ledger reported, citing people familiar with the deal.  Jordan, 58, replaces Mike Rice, who was fired April 3 after
practice tapes showed him throwing balls at his players and
yelling epithets at them.  Rutgers won’t be able to officially announce the deal until
the board of governors meets to approve the decision, the
newspaper said. The group needs 48 hours to schedule a special
meeting.  Jordan, a Los Angeles Lakers assistant coach and member of
the Scarlet Knights’ Final Four team of the 1976 National
Collegiate Athletic Association tournament, will become the
highest-paid men’s basketball coach in school history and the
highest-paid state employee in  New Jersey , the Star-Ledger said.  Jordan takes over a program that had a 15-16 record last
season and hasn’t had a winning season since it went 19-14 in
2005-06. The Scarlet Knights have had losing records in 17 of
the past 23 seasons.  To contact the reporter on this story:
