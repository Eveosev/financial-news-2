U.K. stocks  rose for the first time
this week, rebounding from a two-month low, as a Chinese
government economist forecast growth in the world’s second-
biggest economy will rebound this year.  Kazakhmys Plc (KAZ)  and  Fresnillo Plc (FRES)  rallied more than 3 percent
as a gauge of mining companies in the FTSE 350 climbed from the
lowest level in 3 1/2 years.  Anglo American Plc (AAL)  advanced 2.1
percent as iron-ore output increased.  Spectris Plc (SXS)  plunged the
most in nearly four years after the maker of production-testing
gear cut its revenue-growth forecast.  The FTSE 100 Index added 22.06 points, or 0.4 percent, to
6,265.73 at 9:36 a.m. in London. The gauge has still fallen 1.8
percent this week, trimming it’s advance so far in 2013 to 6.3
percent. The broader FTSE All-Share Index rose 0.4 percent and
Ireland’s ISEQ Index gained 0.7 percent.  The volume of shares changing hands in companies on the
FTSE 100 was 6.3 percent less than the average of the past 30
days, data compiled by Bloomberg showed.  Zhu Baoliang, head of the State Information Center’s
economic forecast department, said  China’s economy  may rebound
in the second and third quarters of the year. China should
stabilize money supply growth and loosen fiscal policy to boost
growth, Zhu said at forum in Beijing. The center is a research
institute under the National Development and Reform Commission,
China’s top economic planner.  To contact the reporter on this story:
