SeaWorld (SEAS)  Entertainment Inc., the
theme-park operator owned by  Blackstone Group LP (BX) , raised $702
million in its initial public offering after pricing the shares
at the top of the marketed range.  SeaWorld sold 26 million shares at $27 each, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg, after offering them for $24 to $27
apiece. The shares, which represent 28 percent of the
outstanding stock, will start trading today, listed on the New
York Stock Exchange under the symbol SEAS.  Blackstone chose an IPO for SeaWorld, snubbing takeover
bids from Apollo Global Management LLC and Onex Corp., because
the firm expects the offering to yield better returns over time
than a sale, a person familiar with the matter said earlier this
year. At the offering price,  Orlando , Florida-based SeaWorld’s
market value is about $2.5 billion.  SeaWorld, famed for its killer whales named Shamu, had
about $191.7 million in  capital expenditures  in the 12 months
through December and free cash flow of $111.8 million, according
to regulatory filings and data compiled by Bloomberg. The
company operates 11 theme parks, including two under the Busch
Gardens brand.  Much of SeaWorld’s capital spending went toward future
attractions and animal-safety measures, filings show. The
company described those costs as “elevated” for 2011 and 2012,
and plans to reduce its level of expenditures to an average of
about 10 percent of total revenue starting in 2014, excluding
safety and infrastructure investments.  Long-Term Debt  SeaWorld will have about $1.6 billion of net long-term debt
after using IPO proceeds to repay borrowings, according to its
prospectus. Blackstone took control of SeaWorld in 2009 after
agreeing to buy  Anheuser-Busch InBev NV’s (ABI)  amusement-park
business, in a transaction then valued at as much as $2.7
billion.  Blackstone, which owns all of SeaWorld’s equity, will hold
about 68 percent following the sale. The IPO price values
Blackstone’s stake, along with the cash received from the IPO,
at about $2.2 billion, more than twice the firm’s $1 billion
equity investment in the 2009 leveraged buyout, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg and a person with knowledge of the
original transaction. Including dividends of more than $600
million that SeaWorld had already paid Blackstone over the past
two years, it’s almost three times Blackstone’s initial
investment.  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and JPMorgan Chase & Co. led the
sale.  To contact the reporter on this story:
