Heavy Louisiana Sweet oil’s premium
to West Texas Intermediate on the  spot market  shrank to the
narrowest level since January 2012 as Brent held at about $11 a
barrel more than WTI.  Brent’s premium over the U.S. benchmark has fallen by more
than half since February as refinery turnarounds and
disappointing economic data out of Europe and Asia have
diminished demand. The June European benchmark’s premium to WTI
for same-month delivery was $11.24 a barrel at 2:14 p.m. New
York time.  Gulf crudes like HLS compete with foreign oils priced
against Brent for space in  Gulf Coast  refineries.  HLS, the heavy, sweet benchmark on the Gulf Coast, weakened
by 40 cents to $11.35 a barrel more than WTI in Cushing,
 Oklahoma , at 12:01 p.m. East Coast time, data compiled by
Bloomberg show. It’s the smallest premium since Jan. 19, 2012.  Light Louisiana Sweet weakened by 10 cents to $11.75 a
barrel more than the U.S. benchmark. Mars Blend, a medium-sour
crude in the Gulf, widened its premium by 55 cents to $6.50.  Crude from the Poseidon formation in the Gulf strengthened
by 60 cents to a premium of $6.15. The premium for crude from
the Southern Green Canyon strengthened by 20 cents to $4.85 a
barrel.  Thunder Horse  gained 60 cents to $9 a barrel above WTI.  To contact the reporter on this story:
