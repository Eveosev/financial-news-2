European Central Bank President
 Mario Draghi  said the economic situation in the 17-nation euro
area hasn’t improved since the ECB’s last meeting on April 4.  The Frankfurt-based central bank has been closely watching
data as they come in, “and so far we haven’t seen any
improvement in the situation,” Draghi said today in Washington.  With doubts growing about the ECB’s projection for an
economic recovery later this year, Draghi has signaled he’s
looking at a range of measures, including cutting  interest rates .
ECB Governing Council member Jens Weidmann, who also heads
Germany’s Bundesbank, said earlier today that the ECB would only
lower borrowing costs to a new record low if economic data
worsen. The benchmark rate is currently 0.75 percent.  Asked about the euro’s recent fluctuations against other
currencies, Draghi said exchange rates “have been stable within
a band” and that “there haven’t been any abnormal movements.”  “Exchange rates are not a policy target for the ECB,”
Draghi said. “And at the same time, obviously, they are
important for  price stability  and for growth.”  The ECB predicts the euro-area economy will shrink 0.5
percent this year before growing 1 percent in 2014.  To contact the reporters on this story:
