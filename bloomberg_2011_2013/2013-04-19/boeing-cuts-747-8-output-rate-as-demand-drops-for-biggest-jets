Boeing Co. (BA)  cut the production rate
on the 747-8 jumbo jet, its biggest and most-expensive model,
citing dwindling demand for the largest passenger planes and
freighters.  Monthly output will drop by early 2014 to 1.75 aircraft
from two now, Boeing said today in a statement. The Chicago-
based company said the change in tempo, to 21 jets a year from
24, isn’t expected to have a significant financial impact.  Boeing’s move follows through on its previous warnings that
production rates might not be sustainable amid weakness in the
global air-cargo market. Four-engine planes such as the 747-8
and the  Airbus SAS (EAD)  A380 also have seen their popularity dwindle
as airlines opt for the biggest twin-engine models instead.  “The passenger variant’s got five years on the market at
most,” said  Richard Aboulafia , vice president of Teal Group, a
Fairfax, Virginia-based aerospace forecaster that has done work
for Boeing. “It’s part of a broader problem, which is that the
market for large quad jets is small, and getting smaller.”  Boeing has won just 110 orders for the 747-8, of which only
40 are for the passenger version, since it began offering the
plane in 2005. During that time, carriers have placed orders for
more than 700 777s, the company’s largest twin-engine jet. Those
models are more fuel-efficient than those with four engines.  List Prices  The 747-8 is Boeing’s costliest commercial plane, with list
prices of $351.4 million for the passenger version and $352
million for the freighter. It entered service in 2011.  Boeing said it will continue to monitor market conditions
for jumbo jets and their effect on production rates. The global
air-cargo market should resume growing at long-term average
rates in 2014, Boeing said in its statement.  “Boeing has noted soft demand in the freighter market for
some time, and if there is no pick up in orders we could see
further cuts to the 747-8 production rate,” wrote  Rob Stallard ,
a London-based analyst at  RBC Capital Markets  who has a neutral
rating on the stock.  The shares  gained 0.8 percent to $86.80 at 11 a.m. in  New
York . The  Federal Aviation Administration  is ready to clear
Boeing’s proposed fix for the 787 Dreamliner’s batteries and end
that jet’s grounding, according to people familiar with the
matter.  Longer Routes  Twin-engine models like the Dreamliner able to fly longer
routes have eroded the need for four-engine planes in serving
intercontinental markets. The 787 has won 890 orders since going
on sale in 2004.  Boeing’s promise to come out with a successor to its best-
selling 777, the 777X, by the end of the decade also threatens
to choke off any potential interest in the 747-8, Teal Group’s
Aboulafia said.  While predicting few if any further orders for the 747-8
Intercontinental, the passenger version, Aboulafia said the
freighter should do better, and that Boeing would be smart to
postpone any decisions until the cargo market recovers.  “This is the worst time to make a long-term decision about
the plane, because for the last two years, we’ve had really bad
cargo numbers,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
