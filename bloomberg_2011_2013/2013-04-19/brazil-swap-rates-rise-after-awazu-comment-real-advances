Brazil shorter-term swap rates
rose, erasing earlier declines after a central bank director
said policy makers had no disagreement on whether to raise
borrowing costs as they debated the timing this week.  Luiz Awazu Pereira, the central bank director for
international affairs, said today at an event in  Washington  that
inflation is high and persistent and that industry is
recovering. Awazu voted against an increase.  Swap rates due January 2014 rose two basis points to 7.86
percent at 4:52 p.m. in Sao Paulo, after earlier dropping as
much as six basis points. The real gained 0.5 percent to 2.0086
per dollar.  “Awazu’s comment that the debate wasn’t about if, but when
to raise rates,” said  Vladimir Caramaschi , chief strategist at
 Credit Agricole (ACA) , in a phone interview from Sao Paulo. “The
divergence is over the timing.”  The central bank’s board this week voted 6 to 2 to raise
the target lending rate to 7.50 percent from a record low 7.25
percent. A survey by Bloomberg showed that 18 of 58 analysts
forecast an increase of 50 basis points. Awazu was one of the 2
votes against raising rates.  Policy makers said “the high level” and “resilience” of
inflation required a response, according to the board’s
statement posted on the bank’s website.  To contact the reporters on this story:
