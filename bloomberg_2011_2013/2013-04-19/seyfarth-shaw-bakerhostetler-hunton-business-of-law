that in-house counsel are frequently using LinkedIn and lawyer
blogs to determine who they will hire, John Corey, founding
partner at Greentarget, tells Bloomberg Law’s Lee Pacchia. But
you won’t find those in-house lawyers in the comment sections of
blogs or blogging themselves -- they prefer to just listen,
rather than engage, the survey says. More information about the
survey, which is co-sponsored by Inside Counsel magazine and law
firm consulting company Zeughauser Group, is available here:

Medicare coverage, fired a law firm tied to an alleged leak of
government information that sent the company’s stock soaring
this month.  The insurer fired Greenberg Traurig LLP after learning it
worked for an investor-services company also linked to the
alleged leak, said Tom Noland, a spokesman for Louisville,
Kentucky-based Humana. The insurance carrier also has begun an
internal investigation, Noland said yesterday in a phone
interview.  U.S. Senator Charles Grassley, an Iowa Republican, is
probing whether the investor company, Height Analytics LLC,
received inside information before telling clients the afternoon
of April 1 that officials would change plans and reduce a
proposed rate cut for Medicare Advantage plans sold by private
insurers. Shares of Humana and other insurers jumped in the last
20 minutes of the trading day after Height sent an e-mail to
clients predicting the rate cut would be reduced. Medicare
officially announced the decision about 45 minutes later.  Grassley has also requested information from New York-based
Greenberg Traurig after learning that one of its lobbyists, Mark Hayes, had sent an e-mail to a Height analyst earlier on April 1
saying Medicare would change its decision. Hayes is a former
aide to Grassley.  Noland said Humana had no advance notice of Medicare’s
decision. The internal probe is meant to determine if Greenberg
Traurig “in any way hurt Humana’s interests,” he said. It was
unclear how long the investigation may take or if its results
would be shared with Grassley, he said.  A spokeswoman for Greenberg Traurig, Jill Perry, said April
17 that Hayes didn’t receive or share any “material non-
public” information. Hayes didn’t return telephone messages or
e-mails seeking comment on his alleged actions.  Height did nothing wrong, its managing partner, Andrew Parmentier, said in a statement on April 17 to the firm’s
clients. Its report was based on “careful and close analysis”
and not inside information, he said.  Feinberg Will Oversee Boston Fund Set Up to Aid Bombing Victims  Kenneth Feinberg, the lawyer who ran the September 11th
Victim Compensation Fund, will play the same role for those
affected by the  Boston  Marathon bombing, said Boston Mayor
Thomas Menino and Massachusetts Governor Deval Patrick.  More than $7 million has been committed to The One Fund
Boston by individuals and companies, including $500,000 from
more than 8,500 people contributing through OneFundBoston.org,
the two Democrats said in a statement.  Feinberg, a native of Brockton, a Massachusetts city south
of Boston, will provide the service without charge, according to
the statement. The founder of Washington-based law firm Feinberg
Rozen LLP, he is a graduate of the University of Massachusetts
at Amherst and serves on the John F. Kennedy Library
Foundation’s board of directors.  “I will do my best to justify their confidence in me as we
move forward to design and administer an effective program
following the terrible tragedy in Boston,” Feinberg said in the
statement. He will design the fund and oversee its operations,
starting April 19, when he is set to arrive in Boston.  Feinberg, 67, oversaw compensation limits for executives at
seven companies bailed out by the U.S. Treasury, including
insurer American International Group. He also supervised Gulf
Coast Claims Facilities, set up to compensate victims of the
2010 BP Plc oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico. In addition, he ran
compensation funds for victims of mass shootings in Aurora,
 Colorado , and at Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State
University, the school known as Virginia Tech.  Australia Litigation Funders Spur Record Settlements in 2012  The value of securities class action settlements in
 Australia  in 2012 was a record A$480 million ($495 million),
almost as much as the total since group lawsuits were
introduced, law firm King & Wood Mallesons said.  Total settlements since the country allowed class actions
20 years ago now stand at just over A$1 billion, the firm said
in a report yesterday, citing a growth in litigation funders as
a key reason.  Although the U.S. is seen as the birth place of class
actions, Australia has taken the lead in a number of areas. That
includes the first class action lawsuit examining the conduct of
an investment bank in relation to the sale of collateralized
debt obligations when a Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. unit was
found liable for losses incurred by three towns from buying
failed securities, King & Wood Mallesons said.  Australia was also the first jurisdiction in which
proceedings were successfully brought against a rating company,
when Standard & Poor’s was found liable in November for
misleading Australian towns with its investment ratings, the law
firm said.  Last year also saw more settlements than any other year in
Australia, with 13 class actions settled, the firm said. King &
Wood Mallesons, with 2,200 legal professionals, was formed last
year by the merger of Sydney-based and Beijing-based firms.  The record settlement value was led by the highest ever
reached in the Australia in May when Centro Retail Australia and
PricewaterhouseCoopers agreed to pay A$200 million to
shareholders who claimed they were misled by company statements
in 2007 that failed to disclose its debt levels.  U.K.-based Argentum Investment Management Ltd. entered the
country last year, bringing the number of active litigation
funders to at least eight, King & Wood Mallesons said.  “More funders will inevitably drive more class action
litigation as they compete for market share,” it said.  For more, click here.  Ex-Judicial Official Charged in Slaying of Texas Prosecutors  A former justice of the peace in Kaufman County,  Texas , and
his wife were charged in the slaying of the county’s top
prosecutor, his wife and an assistant district attorney who had
won a conviction against him for stealing computers from his
employer.  Eric Williams, 46, was charged with capital murder, the
county sheriff, David Byrnes, said yesterday at a press
conference in Kaufman County. His wife, Kim, was arrested
yesterday and charged with capital murder in connection with the
killings of District Attorney Mike McLelland, his wife, Cynthia,
and Assistant District Attorney Mark Hasse.  Eric Williams has been in custody since April 13, charged
with making a threat to law enforcement officials who were
investigating the slaying of the McLellands at their home on
March 30. Hasse was shot and killed in his car near the county
courthouse on January 31.  The sheriff’s office said in an affidavit for the arrest of
Kim Williams, 46, that she confessed to her involvement in the
killings and told an investigator that her husband shot the
three.  Eric Williams, while working as a justice of the peace, was
convicted last year of stealing county computers in a case
prosecuted by McLelland and Hasse, according to the affidavit.
He subsequently lost his peace officer’s license and his law
license was revoked.  Officers and county employees told investigators that Hasse
and McLelland both believed that Eric Williams blamed them for
his removal from office, according to the affidavit. The two
prosecutors regularly carried handguns after Eric Williams’s
jury trial because they believed Williams “to be a threat to
their personal safety,” according to the affidavit.  The sheriff’s office said it traced an electronic
communication that Eric Williams sent from his personal computer
to law enforcement officers the day after the McLellands were
killed.  “The threat implied unless law enforcement responded to
the demands of the writer, another attack would occur,”
according to an April 12 affidavit for a warrant to arrest Eric
Williams.  Government Lawyers  Top Lawyers Leave CFTC as Agency Tries to Finish Dodd-Frank Act  The main U.S. derivatives regulator is losing three of its
top lawyers as it tries to finish Dodd-Frank Act rules designed
to curb risk in the $639 trillion global swaps market.  Terry Arbit, a Commodity Futures Trading Commission lawyer
since 1996 and deputy general counsel, and Harold Hardman, also
a deputy general counsel who spent more than 30 years at the
agency, are leaving, according to  Steve Adamske , the
commission’s spokesman. Dan Berkovitz stepped down as general
counsel last month.  “You’re looking at very serious lawyers with decades of
experience,” Dan Waldman, a Washington-based partner at Arnold
& Porter LLP and former CFTC general counsel, said in a
telephone interview. “They’re obviously going to be missed.”  Dodd-Frank was enacted as lawmakers sought to reduce risk
and increase transparency in the swaps market after unregulated
trades helped fuel the 2008 credit crisis. The law calls for
most swaps to be guaranteed at clearinghouses and traded on
exchanges or other platforms.  The regulations will govern trades guaranteed at
clearinghouses including those operated by CME Group Inc. and
conducted by companies such as Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and
 JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM)   The CFTC has finalized rules governing which companies must
register as swaps dealers, how clearinghouses manage risk and
how customer money must be segregated. The agency several times
has delayed a final vote on rules for trading of swaps on new
execution facilities, while the five-member commission has also
failed to finish guidance on the cross-border reach of its
regulations.  To contact the reporter on this story:
