The uncle of the Boston bombing suspect being hunted by police said the attack brought shame to the family and he urged his nephew to turn himself in.  “I say Dzhokar, if you’re alive turn yourself in and ask for forgiveness from the victims,” Ruslan Tsarni said of his nephew as he addressed reporters outside his home in the Washington suburb of Gaithersburg,  Maryland .  Tsarni spoke after he and his wife were interviewed at his home this morning by FBI agents.  Tsarni said he knew of no motive for the bombing attack at the Boston Marathon. He said if his nephews are guilty, they are “losers” who weren’t able to settle themselves in the U.S.  “I love this country,” Tsarni said. “He put a shame on the Tsarni family.”  He said he last saw his nephews, identified as Dzhokar and Tamerlan Tsarnaev, in 2005. Dzhokar Tsarnaev is being sought by authorities in the Boston area after his brother died in a confrontation with police last night.  Tsarni expressed sympathy for those killed and wounded in the April 15 bombing.  “Those who suffered, we’re sharing with them their grief,” Tsarni said.
