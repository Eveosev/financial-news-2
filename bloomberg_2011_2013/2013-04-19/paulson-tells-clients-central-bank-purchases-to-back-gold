John Paulson , the hedge-fund
manager who’s lost money this year after a 16 percent decline in
gold, told clients that purchases by central banks and demand in
Asia will support the metal in the near term.  “Although inflation and inflation expectations remain
subdued, which appears to have dampened the appetite for gold so
far this year, we believe that ongoing central bank purchases
and strong gold demand from China and India will help support
the gold price in the near-term,” Paulson & Co. said in a
letter to clients that was obtained by  Bloomberg News .  Gold plunged 13 percent in two sessions through April 15,
the biggest slump since 1980. Futures touched $1,321.50 on April
16, the lowest since January 2011, partly on concern that
central banks in Europe will sell holdings to pay debt. Paulson,
who became a billionaire in 2007 by betting against the U.S.
subprime mortgage market, had about $9.5 billion of his own
money invested across his  hedge funds  at the start of this year,
of which 85 percent was in gold share classes.  “With ongoing, open-ended bond purchases, the Federal
Reserve’s balance sheets continues to expand, and the Fed has
now also confirmed that there is not going to be an unwinding of
the stimulus through bond sales,” the hedge fund said in the
letter. “This, in our view, increases the probability that
money printing will eventually lead to inflation.”  Armel Leslie , a spokesman for $18 billion New York-based
Paulson & Co., declined to comment on the letter.  To contact the reporter on this story:
