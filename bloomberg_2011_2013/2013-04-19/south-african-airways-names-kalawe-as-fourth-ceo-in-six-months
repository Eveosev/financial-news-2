South African Airways Ltd., the
continent’s biggest airline, has appointed Monwabisi Kalawe as
its fourth chief executive officer in six months and put him in
charge of returning the ailing company to profit.  Kalawe, 51, will be “custodian of the turnaround
strategy” of the partly state-owned carrier and will start on a
five-year contract, Public Enterprises Minister Malusi Gigaba
told reporters in Johannesburg today.  Kalawe, the managing director of food company  Compass Group
Plc (CPG) ’s Southern Africa unit, will become the airline’s third CEO
since Siza Mzimela resigned in the wake of a dispute between
board members and the government last October. Vuyisile Kona was
was suspended in February because of “certain allegations”
that were not specified, while Nico Bezuidenhout, CEO of the
company’s low-cost Mango unit, has been in charge on an interim
basis since then.  SAA, as the carrier is known, posted a pretax loss of 1.36
billion rand ($148.4 million) for the year ending March 2012
compared with a profit of 792 million rand a year earlier,
according to its  annual report . The government gave the airline
a 5 billion rand debt guarantee in October to ensure it can
borrow from financial markets to support a recovery.  The airline needs to buy between 25 and 35 new wide body
aircraft as part of the turnaround strategy, Bezuidenhout said
in an interview. SAA links South Africa to several 38
destinations worldwide including  London , New York and  Singapore .  To contact the reporter on this story:
