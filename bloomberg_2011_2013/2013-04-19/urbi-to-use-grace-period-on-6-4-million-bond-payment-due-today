Urbi Desarrollos Urbanos SAB,
 Mexico ’s third-biggest homebuilder by revenue, said it won’t
make the $6.4 million interest payment due today on its 2016
dollar bonds “at this time.”  The company plans to use a 30-day grace period for the
payment, according to a filing distributed by the Mexican stock
exchange. Urbi is in the process of analyzing its business and
operations, according to the statement.  The bonds due in 2016 rose 2.77 cents to 34.86 cents on the
dollar at 12:28 p.m. in Mexico City, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg. Urbi’s shares fell 3.2 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
