Ethanol strengthened against
gasoline on speculation that demand for the biofuel is
outstripping supply.  The fuels’ spread shrank by 1.11 cents to 28.44 cents a
gallon as  production  of the fuel reached 832,000 barrels a day
last week, the lowest level for this time of year in records
going back to June 2010, a report from the Energy Information
Administration showed. Inventories have fallen 11 out of the 15
weeks so far this year.  “It’s lack of production and drawing stockpiles,” said
Ian Jackson, a trader at SCB & Associates LLC in Chicago. “Just
genuine tightness out there.”  Denatured ethanol for May delivery gained 2.8 cents, or 1.1
percent, to $2.488 a gallon on the Chicago Board of Trade.
Prices have risen 14 percent this year.  Gasoline for May delivery advanced 1.69 cents, or 0.6
percent, to $2.7724 a gallon on the New York Mercantile
Exchange. The contract covers reformulated gasoline, made to be
blended with ethanol before delivery to filling stations.  Last year, the worst drought since the 1930s damaged corn
crops and raised costs to make the fuel. Prices for the grain
have as Agriculture Department reports predicted larger-than-
expected supplies.  Corn for May delivery rose 7.5 cents, or 1.2 percent, to
$6.52 a bushel in  Chicago . One bushel makes at least 2.75
gallons of ethanol.  Crush Spread  The corn crush spread, representing gains or losses from
turning corn into ethanol, was 12 cents a gallon, unchanged from
yesterday. The amount doesn’t include revenue from the sale of
dried distillers’ grains, a byproduct of ethanol that can be fed
to livestock,  The spread has been above or near break-even for all of
April, the longest such streak since December 2011, data
compiled by Bloomberg show.  A 2007 energy law, known as the Renewable Fuels Standard,
requires the U.S. to use 13.8 billion gallons of ethanol this
year and 14.4 billion in 2014.  Compliance with the program is tracked with certificates
called Renewable Identification Numbers, or RINs, that are
assigned to each gallon of biofuel.  Corn-ethanol-based RINs fell 1.5 cents today to 68.5 cents,
data compiled by Bloomberg show. Advanced RINs, which cover
biodiesel and Brazilian sugarcane-based ethanol, were unchanged
at 79.5 cents.  Production Short  On an annual basis, production has averaged 12.3 billion
gallons so far this year, EIA data show, short of the level
needed to meet federal mandates.  Stockpiles last week dropped 1.6 percent to 17.5 million
barrels, 20 percent lower than a year earlier, the EIA said.
Inventories have fallen 11 out of the 15 weeks of this year.  Jackson said ethanol prices have received a boost from a
lack of foreign competition. Brazil is the biggest supplier of
the biofuel to the U.S.  The U.S. hasn’t  imported  any of the fuel since March 29,
the Energy Department’s analytical arm said in the April 17
report.  Spot ethanol in Sao Paulo  cost $2.46 a gallon last week,
the highest since April 13, 2012, data compiled by Bloomberg
show.  Ethanol-blended gasoline made up 94 percent of the total
U.S. gasoline supply last week, down from a record 96 percent
the previous week, according to the EIA.  In cash market trading, ethanol increased 3.5 cents to
$2.68 a gallon in New York, 5 cents to $2.515 in Chicago and 5
cents to $2.57 on the Gulf Coast, data compiled by Bloomberg
show. On the West Coast, ethanol was unchanged at $2.76 a
gallon.  West Coast ethanol’s premium to the Gulf Coast contracted 5
cents to 19 cents, the smallest differential since April 9.
Chicago’s discount to New York Harbor narrowed 1.5 cents to 16.5
cents.  To contact the reporter on this story:
