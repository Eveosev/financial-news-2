Gwyneth Paltrow, Sarah Jessica Parker and Kate Hudson squeezed onto a loveseat last night inside a 31-foot-high Tiffany blue box at Rockefeller Center.  An aerialist in white feathers swung above as Cole Porter music played.  “Welcome to the Tiffany Blue Book Ball,” said Michael Kowalski, the chief executive officer of  Tiffany & Co. (TIF)   The party, timed close to the release of the film “The Great Gatsby,” celebrated the luxury retailer’s 2013 Blue Book Collection, which not coincidentally is inspired by the jazz age and art deco.  Carey Mulligan stood near a display of the diamond headband she wears playing Daisy, chatting with the film’s director, Baz Luhrmann, and its costume and production designer, Catherine Martin, who worked closely with Tiffany on the jewelry in the film.  “It’s available by special order,” said Tiffany’s chief gemologist, Melvyn Kirtley, of the headband.  He noted its versatility: the feather is detachable, so the headband can also be worn as a choker, and the feather as a brooch.  Kirtley also said the Blue Book plans to stay in the 1920s for at least a few years.  “Tiffany’s designers were very prolific then, we have so much in the archives to draw on,” he said.  Diamonds Song  The jeweler created a period supper club with a stage set up in front of the gilt Prometheus statue. Megan Hilty, who plays Marilyn Monroe in the television show “Smash,” sang “Diamonds are a Girl’s Best Friend” for guests hailing from Lebanon,  China , New York and  London .  A huge tower of Moet & Chandon champagne bottles arranged as decoration near the bar signaled the drink of choice, served in coupes.  The multiple headbands and fur stoles did their part too, but the most effective time-travel machine was dinner.  Waiters in white jackets came out carrying large silver platters of ham and Waldorf salad tucked into cups of iceberg lettuce. There were oohs and aahs as the lobster tails landed on the buffet tables.  The actresses were dripping in 2013 Blue Book designs. Paltrow wore $640,000 of jewelry, including a black opal, a Montana sapphire and a diamond butterfly brooch.  She said she likes Tiffany’s trademark color because “it’s optimistic.”  Whale Tie  At the American Museum of Natural History’s “Under the Sea” dance, Michael Kaufman, founder of Mak Capital One LLC, wore a bow-tie with sharks on it. “My wife dressed me,” he said.  Andrew Right of Cherry Lane Capital Advisors LP had whales on his bow tie. His wife, Zibby Right, daughter of Blackstone Group’s CEO  Steve Schwarzman , had rejected another decorated with coral.  Any male not outfitted appropriately on arrival got help from sponsor Roberto Cavalli, which arranged for aquatic-themed silk napkins at every seat, quickly adapted as pocket squares.  Zac Efron  The evening ended in a room covered in zebra stripes and decorated with a photograph of antelopes. This was a dining room of Clarkson, a West Village restaurant, where actors Zac Efron, Heather Graham and Dennis Quaid celebrated a Cinema Society & Bally screening of their film “At Any Price.”  Near midnight, the co-president and co-founder of Sony Pictures Classics, Tom Bernard, checked in with Andrew Saffir, who organized the event.  “I think now is a good time to get my credit card back,” Bernard told Saffir.
