Schindler Holding AG (SCHP) , the Swiss
maker of elevators and escalators, said European builders
delaying or postponing projects stunted sales growth in the
first quarter.  Revenue rose 4 percent to 1.98 billion Swiss francs ($2.13
billion), the company said today. Analysts predicted 2.01
billion francs. Operating profit rose 1.4 percent to 217 million
francs. Shares were little changed at 130.9 francs at the open
of trading in Zurich.  “Several new installation and modernization projects were
delayed or postponed in various European markets,” Schindler
said in a  statement , adding that the market “leveled off” in
the region. Sales growth mainly came from new installations of
lifts in growth markets, Schindler said.  Chief Executive Officer Juergen Tinggren is re-positioning
the company to expand in China and  India  as declining government
spending on building projects erodes demand for elevators in
 Europe . Schindler abandoned a profitability margin target Feb.
19 to spend more on research and new factories in faster growing
markets.  Schindler confirmed targets of 6 percent sales growth in
local currencies and net income of 740 million francs to 790
million francs this year even as the first quarter came in
“slightly below” expectations.  To contact the reporter on this story:
