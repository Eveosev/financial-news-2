Peruvian bonds rose, pushing down
yields the most in a month, as U.S. corporate earnings that
topped forecasts signaled the recovery in the world’s largest
economy remains intact.  The yield on  Peru ’s benchmark 7.84 percent sol bond due
August 2020 fell three basis points, or 0.03 percentage point,
to a record 3.68 percent at 11:50 a.m. in Lima, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. That’s the steepest drop since March
15. The price rose 0.18 centimo to 126.28 centimos per sol.  U.S. corporate credit risk declined as companies from
Microsoft Corp. to Honeywell International Inc. reported
earnings that beat analyst estimates, fueling demand for higher-
yielding assets. Peru sold 1.2 billion soles ($463 million) of
sol bonds on April 17, 50 percent more than it initially
offered.  “Demand is solid,” said Fernando Iberico, an analyst at
Lima-based brokerage Inteligo SAB. “The majority of buyers are
from overseas and although yields are already low, they want
exposure to the local currency.”  The sol was little changed at 2.6930 per U.S. dollar,
according to prices from Datatec.  To contact the reporter on this story:
