Toyota Motor Corp. (7203) ’s Prius hybrid
line, coming off record U.S. sales last year, may not reach a
target for growth in 2013 as gasoline prices fall faster than
the automaker expected, its top North American executive said.  “It’ll be a challenge,”  Jim Lentz , Toyota’s North
American chief executive officer, said in an interview today in
 New York . “We’ll continue to push Prius and Prius family, but
if it ends up that demand is less than the sales forecast, that
may be adjusted,” he said without elaborating.  Toyota last month said it planned to sell about 250,000
Prius models in the U.S. this year, up 5.6 percent from 236,659
in 2012. Sales of the top-selling hybrid line -- comprising the
main Prius hatchback, v wagon, c subcompact and plug-in Prius --
dropped 8.4 percent in the first quarter to 55,724.  Sales of gasoline-electric cars and trucks have expanded in
the past decade, albeit fluctuating with fuel prices. The
average U.S. cost of regular grade gasoline was $3.506 a gallon
as of April 18, according to AAA’s Daily Fuel Gauge report, down
9.9 percent from $3.891 a year earlier.  While Prius sales are down this year, combined deliveries
of all Toyota and Lexus hybrids are up 2.4 percent to 83,642,
according to the company. In some cases, Prius owners are
shifting to recently added hybrid models including a version of
the Toyota Avalon sedan and compact Lexus CT200h, Lentz said.  “Since we now have about 2 million hybrid owners in the
U.S., we do have people coming in to buy new hybrids again,”
said Lentz, who is based at the company’s Torrance, California,
U.S. sales office.  Ford Motor Co. (F) ’s push to expand its U.S.
hybrid sales isn’t a factor for the Prius slowdown, he said.  No Comment  Akio Toyoda, CEO of Toyota City, Japan-based Toyota, today
in New York declined to discuss when the automaker founded by
his grandfather would begin making Prius models in  North
America . Prius, built solely in Japan, is the largest line of
models imported to the U.S.  The company’s American depositary receipts fell  rose  1.5
percent to $112.26 at the close in New York. The receipts rose
20 percent this year, more than the 9 percent increase for the
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
