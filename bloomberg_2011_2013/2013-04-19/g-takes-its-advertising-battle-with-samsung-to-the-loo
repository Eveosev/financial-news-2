South Korea's LG debuted a racy advertisement this week to promote its new line of high-definition screens. It's the latest in the ad wars between LG and fellow South Korean electronics giant Samsung. We'll let you judge whether LG went too far in putting its technology on display in a bathroom (you can see the ad at around 00:50). The ad is a sequel to one that took place in an  elevator .
