A global group of regulators is
proposing new rules on how sales of structured products to
individual investors should be governed, amid concern buyers of
the securities that combine debt with derivatives are vulnerable
to mis-selling.  The International Organization of Securities Commissions,
which brings together market regulators from more than 100
countries, is seeking feedback on a consultation report
published yesterday on the regulation of retail structured
products.  Iosco’s proposals aim to improve sales practices and
disclosure for the securities, which have been criticized for
being too opaque and complex. National regulators in  Asia ,
 Europe  and the U.S. have been seeking to tighten rules governing
structured notes since the 2008 collapse of Lehman Brothers
Holdings Inc., which was a major issuer.  “Complex products, due to their nature, can be difficult
for investors to understand,” said Iosco chairman Greg Medcraft
in a statement. “This can lead to them being mis-sold,
particularly when investors are searching for yield.”  Madrid-based Iosco is asking members to consider
coordinating and aligning their regulations on structured notes,
as well as the amount of information that should be disclosed to
investors. Iosco is also asking national regulators to
investigate banks and other distributors of the securities, to
see whether they are keeping buyers informed on the performance
of their investments.  To contact the reporter on this story:
