Cia. de Saneamento de Minas Gerais ,
 Brazil ’s second-largest water utility by market value, expanded
the scale of a 500.6 million-real ($249 million) water-supply
project.  Copasa, as the company is known, is seeking a partner to
help boost capacity of the Manso River water-supply system to
produce 5,800 liters (1,530 gallons) of water a second, Claudio
Dotti, head of the Belo Horizonte, Brazil-based utility’s
department for new business, said yesterday in a telephone
interview.  The public-private partnership was originally expected to
increase production to 5,000 liters, up from 4,000 liters now,
and would have cost 450 million reais. Copasa plans to issue
details of the project next month and interested companies will
have 45 days to submit proposals.  State-controlled Copasa expects to select a company in June
and sign a contract in August, he said. The selected developer
will have two years to expand the water-treatment plant, pipes
and reservoirs that furnish water to 40 percent of  Belo
Horizonte ’s metropolitan region. It will operate it for another
13 years.  Cia. de Saneamento Basico do Estado de Sao Paulo  is
Brazil’s biggest water utility.  To contact the reporter on this story:
