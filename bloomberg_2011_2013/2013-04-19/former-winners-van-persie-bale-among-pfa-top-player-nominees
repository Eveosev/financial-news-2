Former winners Robin  van Persie  of
Manchester United and Gareth Bale of Tottenham are among the
nominees for the Professional Footballers’ Association player of
the year award.  Van Persie, who won the award last year while at Arsenal,
and Bale, the 2011 recipient, are joined on the shortlist by
Manchester United midfielder Michael Carrick, Chelsea
midfielders Eden Hazard and Juan Mata, and Liverpool striker
Luis Suarez.  Bale and Hazard are also nominated for the young player of
the year, presented to those aged 23 or younger at the start of
the season. Aston Villa’s Christian Benteke; Romelu Lukaku, who
is on loan at West Brom from Chelsea; Manchester United’s Danny Welbeck; and Arsenal’s  Jack Wilshere , the 2011 winner, are the
other finalists for the young player honor.  Aston Villa’s Andy Gray in 1977 and Manchester United’s
Cristiano Ronaldo in 2007 are the only players to win both
awards in the same season. Arsenal’s  Thierry Henry  (2003-2004)
and Ronaldo (2007-2008) are the only recipients of the player of
the year award in consecutive years.  The winners will be announced April 28. The nominees and
winners are selected in a vote of players from England’s 92
soccer clubs in the top four divisions.  To contact the reporter on this story:
