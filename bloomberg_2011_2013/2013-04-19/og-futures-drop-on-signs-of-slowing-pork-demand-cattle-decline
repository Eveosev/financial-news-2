Hog futures fell for the first time
in four days on signs of weakening demand for U.S. pork exports.
Cattle also declined.  Exports of U.S. pork fell 14 percent in the first two
months through Feb. 28, compared with the same period a year
earlier, the latest government  data  show. Sales to  Japan , the
largest importer, may drop 2 percent this year, Philip Seng, the
chief executive officer of the U.S. Meat Export Federation, told
reporters in  Tokyo  today. The cost of  hogs  sold for immediate
delivery at meat processors are headed for a third straight
weekly decline, including a 0.2 percent drop yesterday to 76.5
cents a pound, government data show.  “Export demand has been a concern on the market here a
lot,” Lawrence Kane, a market adviser at Stewart-Peterson Group
in  Yates City ,  Illinois , said in a telephone interview. “The
export pace has been below what we need for a real strong hog
market.”  Hog futures for June settlement declined 0.7 percent to 90
cents a pound at 11:18 a.m. on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
The commodity rose 5.7 percent this year through yesterday.  Cattle futures for June delivery fell 0.5 percent to
$1.20825 a pound.  Feeder-cattle futures for August settlement dropped 1
percent to $1.45725 a pound.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
