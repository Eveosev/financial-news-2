Tesco Plc (TSCO) , the U.K.’s largest
grocer, was downgraded by  Standard & Poor’s  on concerns the
company will suffer weaker profitability and slower sales
growth.  S&P cut Tesco’s long-term  corporate credit rating  to BBB+
from A-, with a stable outlook, it said today. The action
follows an announcement yesterday by  Fitch Ratings , which also
cut the Cheshunt, England-based company to BBB+.  “Tesco’s lower profitability, persistently high market
competition in the U.K., and difficulty in its international
operations have durably impaired the group’s business
position,” S&P said in the statement today. “Structural trends
will continue to weaken Tesco’s profitability and competitive
position.”  Tesco said April 17 it would exit its U.S. business and
scale back domestic expansion at a cost of about 2 billion
pounds ($3 billion) and reported the first annual drop in profit
in almost 20 years. The grocer is struggling to shore up its
market share as customers polarize towards discounters including
Aldi and more expensive chains like Waitrose Ltd.  “Turning around the negative operating trends will take
longer than we previously anticipated because we foresee that
macroeconomic conditions will remain challenging in the U.K. and
 Europe  for the rest of 2013,” said S&P.  Tesco’s  shares  declined, trading down 0.6 percent at 363.3
pence at 1:16 p.m. in London, giving the company a market value
of about 29.3 billion pounds.  To contact the reporter on this story:
