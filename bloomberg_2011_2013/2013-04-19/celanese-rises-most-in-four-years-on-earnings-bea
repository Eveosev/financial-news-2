Celanese Corp. (CE) , a chemicals maker
that processes natural gas and coal into ethanol, rose the most
in four years after reporting first-quarter earnings that
exceeded analysts’ estimates.  Celanese climbed 11 percent to $48.95 as of 10:27 a.m. in
 New York . The shares earlier jumped 16 percent, the most
intraday since March 2009.  Earnings excluding some items were $1.14 a share, Dallas-
based Celanese said today in a statement. That topped the 78-
cent average of 16 estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Net income
fell to 89 cents a share from $1.21 a year earlier.  Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Mark Rohr is boosting
Asian sales of acetate, used in cigarette filters, and cutting
costs as he prepares to make ethanol from coal in Indonesia and
 China . Full-year earnings will rise 12 percent to 14 percent,
consistent with the company’s long-term goals, Rohr said in the
statement.  First-quarter earnings benefited from a $24 million
dividend paid by a Chinese joint venture and gains in the
consumer specialties and advanced engineered materials units,
Charles Neivert, an analyst at Cowen Securities LLC in New York
who recommends holding the shares, said in a note today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
