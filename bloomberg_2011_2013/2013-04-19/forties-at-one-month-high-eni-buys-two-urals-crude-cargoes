North Sea  Forties crude rose to the
highest in more than a month as  Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA)  bought.
 Eni SpA (ENI)  purchased two cargoes of Urals as differentials for the
Russian benchmark grade for delivery to Rotterdam rose to the
highest in almost three months.  Russia will load 1.8 million metric tons of Urals from the
Baltic Sea port of Primorsk in the first 10 days of May, a
preliminary loading program obtained by  Bloomberg News  showed.  North Sea  Shell purchased Forties from Vitol Group for loading from
May 11 to May 13 at 10 cents a barrel less than Dated Brent,
according to a Bloomberg survey of traders and brokers
monitoring the Platts pricing window. That compares with a April
11 deal at minus 60 cents and is the smallest traded discount
since March 18, compiled by Bloomberg show.  Total SA failed to buy a cargo loading May 11 to May 17 at
20 cents less than the benchmark, the survey showed.  Reported crude trading typically occurs during the Platts
window, which ends at 4:30 p.m. London time. Forties loading in
10 to 25 days narrowed by 14 cents to a discount of 41 cents a
barrel to Dated Brent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Brent for June settlement traded at $99.36 a barrel on the
ICE Futures Europe exchange in London at the close of the
window, compared with $98.82 in the previous session. The July
contract was at $99.20 at the same time today, a discount of 16
cents to June.  Statoil ASA (STL)  said it made a “significant” find of
additional resources at its Gullfaks field in the North Sea.  The discovery contains 40 million to 150 million of
recoverable barrels of oil equivalents, the Stavanger, Norway-
based company said in a statement.  Mediterranean/Urals  Eni bought Urals from Vitol at $1.20 a barrel less than
Dated Brent on a delivered basis to Rotterdam, according to the
Platts survey. That compares with a April 9 trade at minus $1.95
and is the smallest discount since Jan. 21.  The company also purchased 80,000 tons of the grade from
Vitol at a 40-cent discount to Dated Brent on a delivered basis
to Augusta,  Italy , the survey showed. That’s 10 cents lower than
the April 16 deal.  The Urals discount to Dated Brent in the Mediterranean
narrowed by 2 cents to 18 cents a barrel, data compiled by
Bloomberg show. That’s the least since Jan. 24. In northwest
 Europe , the  discount  was at $1.57 a barrel compared with $1.60
at yesterday’s close. That’s the narrowest since Feb. 12.  Crude loadings from Ust-Luga in the first 10 days of May
will be eight Urals cargoes, totaling 800,000 tons and one
80,000 cargo of Siberian Light grade, according to the schedule.  Exports from Novorossiysk will total 1.18 million tons of
Urals over the same period and one lot of Siberian Light, the
plan showed.  West Africa  Benchmark Nigerian Qua Iboe blend was unchanged at $3.07 a
barrel more than Dated Brent, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  The loading schedules for Nigeria crude are expected to be
released at the start of next week, according to two people with
knowledge of the plans, asking not to be identified as the
information is confidential.  To contact the reporter on this story:
