 The European Commission  said  it
will next month propose a law to make it easier for consumers to
compare fees charged for bank accounts by lenders and other
payment service providers in the European Union.  The draft law will also seek to simplify the process for
switching accounts as well as ensuring all EU consumers have
access to a payment account “which allows them to perform
essential operations,” the commission said in a statement on
its website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
