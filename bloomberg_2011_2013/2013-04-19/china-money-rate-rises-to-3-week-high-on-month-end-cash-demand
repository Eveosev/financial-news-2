China ’s 14-day money-market rate
climbed to a three-week high on speculation lenders are hoarding
cash to meet month-end requirements and after the central bank
drained funds from the financial system.  The People’s Bank of China pulled a  net  14 billion  yuan 
($2.27 billion) of capital from markets this week, a ninth
weekly withdrawal, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
China’s financial markets will be shut from April 29 to May 1
for the Labor Day holiday.  “Banks are busy borrowing money to meet month-end
requirements,” said Liu Junyu, a bond analyst in Shenzhen at
China Merchants Bank Co., the nation’s sixth-biggest lender.  The 14-day  repurchase rate , which measures interbank
funding availability, gained nine basis points, or 0.09
percentage point, to 3.5 percent as of 11:36 a.m. in  Shanghai ,
according to a weighted average rate compiled by the National
Interbank Funding Center. The rate, which rose 41 basis points
this week, touched 3.53 percent earlier today, the highest since
March 29.  The government today issued 26 billion yuan of 20-year
bonds at a yield of 3.99 percent, according to a trader at a
 finance company  that participates in government debt auctions.  The one-year swap contract, the fixed cost needed to
receive the floating seven-day repurchase rate, climbed two
basis points to 3.25 percent, the biggest increase since March
11, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The rate dropped
one basis point this week.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
