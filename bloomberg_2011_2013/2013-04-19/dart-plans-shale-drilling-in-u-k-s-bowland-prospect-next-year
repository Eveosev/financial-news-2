Dart Energy Ltd. (DTE) , a coal-bed
methane and shale gas explorer in Australia, Asia and  Europe ,
plans to drill exploratory wells in the U.K.’s Bowland acreage
next year as the government prepares tax breaks for drillers.  The company is also “actively engaged with parties” and
expects to finalize a joint-venture agreement this year, Mark
Lappin, general manager for Dart in Europe, said in an interview
at a conference in  London  yesterday.  The U.K. will offer a “generous new tax regime” to
encourage drillers as it seeks to boost domestic energy
resources to counter a decline in North Sea oil and gas output,
it said last month. Dart said last week it was looking for
partners to develop its Bowland shale in northwest  England ,
which may hold as much as 110 trillion cubic feet of gas.  Dart is drilling development wells in license 133 in Airth,
Scotland, after encountering a steady flow of gas from its coal-
bed methane project last year, Lappin said. The Sydney-listed
company expects first gas sales in 2014, he said.  During a three-month test period in the fourth quarter,
more than 500,000 standard cubic feet of gas a day flowed from
the well, the company said in a statement in January.  To contact the reporter on this story:
