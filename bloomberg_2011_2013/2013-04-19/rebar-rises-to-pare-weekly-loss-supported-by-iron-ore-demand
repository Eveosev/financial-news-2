Steel reinforcement-bar futures
rose for the first time in three days, paring a weekly loss,
supported by iron ore prices and as rising demand helped draw
down inventory.  The contract for October delivery on the Shanghai Futures
Exchange gained as much as 1 percent to 3,687  yuan  ($597) a
metric ton, before trading at 3,666 yuan at 10:23 a.m. local
time. Futures have lost 4.5 percent this week.  Inventory fell in the week ended April 12 to 9.99 million
tons, the first time it dropped below 10 million tons in six
weeks, according to Shanghai Steelhome Information. Spot  iron
ore  at Tianjin port was at $138.60 a dry ton yesterday, near the
month high of $141 seen on April 12, Steel Index Ltd. data show.  “Rebar is relatively insulated from other industrial
commodities as it is basically dictated by demand and supply
within  China ,” Zheng Ge, an analyst at Wanda Futures Co., said
by phone from Beijing today. “Firm raw material costs and an
inventory drawdown all helped rebar find its footing after
having fallen with other metals this week.”  The average  spot price  for rebar dropped 0.6 percent
yesterday to 3,613 yuan, according to Beijing Antaike
Information Development Co.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
