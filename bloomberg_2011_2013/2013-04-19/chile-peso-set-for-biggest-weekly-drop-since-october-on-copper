Chile’s peso headed for its
steepest weekly drop in more than five months as the price of
copper, its biggest export, plunged on slowing growth in  China .  The peso fell 1.2 percent in the past five days to 475.83
per  U.S. dollar , the steepest weekly drop on a closing basis
since October. It was little changed today at 9:44 a.m. in
Santiago. The currency has depreciated 1.8 percent since closing
at an 18-month high of 467.05 per dollar on April 8.  Economic growth in China, the biggest buyer of Chilean
copper, was less than economists forecast in the first quarter
as industrial output growth slowed, according to data published
on April 14. Copper for July delivery dropped 6 percent this
week to a 17-month low of $3.17 a pound on the Comex in New
York.  “A lot of what we have seen in the past few days has to do
with global factors,” said Sebastian Brown, a strategist at
Barclays Plc in  New York . “Everyone was negatively surprised by
the Chinese growth data and copper was selling off. We still
expect the peso to end the year at around 475 per dollar,
barring any global shocks.”  Foreign investors  in the Chilean peso forwards market
increased bets against the currency by $1.7 billion in the first
three days of this week to $4.4 billion on April 17, according
to data published today by the central bank.  Chilean two-year  rate swaps  fell six basis points this week
to 4.85 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
