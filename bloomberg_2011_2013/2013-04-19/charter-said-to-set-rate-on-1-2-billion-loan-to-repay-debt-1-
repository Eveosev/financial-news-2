Charter Communications Inc. (CHTR) , the
fourth-largest U.S. cable operator, set the rate it will pay on
a $1.2 billion loan to repay debt, according to a person with
knowledge of the transaction.  The term F portion will come due in January 2021 and pay
interest at 2.25 percentage points more than the London
interbank offered rate, with a 0.75 percent minimum on the
lending benchmark, said the person, who asked not to be
identified because the information is private. Charter is
offering the loan to investors at 99.75 cents on the dollar.  Credit Suisse Group AG is arranging the financing for the
 Stamford , Connecticut-based company and is hosting a lender call
today at 10 a.m. in  New York , the person said. Lenders must let
the bank know by April 25 whether they will participate in the
deal.  Charter, through its CCO Holdings LLC and CCO Holdings
Capital Corp. units, also is planning to sell $1 billion in
senior unsecured notes due in 2024, the company said today in a
statement distributed by PR Newswire.  Proceeds from the sale will be used for general corporate
purposes and to fund a tender offer for CCO Holdingsâ€™ $900
million of 7.875 percent senior unsecured notes due April 2018,
the company said. Those securities traded at 106.75 cents on the
dollar to yield 6.29 percent, according to Trace, the bond-price
reporting system of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority.  Proceeds of the term loan F will help refinance $527
million of term C debt due in 2016 and $744 million of a term D
slice due in 2019, the company said in the statement.  To contact the reporters on this story:
