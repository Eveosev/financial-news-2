Rutgers University  said fired men’s
basketball coach Mike Rice will get a settlement of $475,000,
less than half of the reported $1.1 million figure for
termination contained in his contract.  “Tonight’s agreement is in the best interests of the
university, and I am pleased this issue has been resolved,”
President Robert Barchi said in a statement.  Rice was let go April 3, after the ESPN cable-television
network showed a video of him kicking and throwing balls at
players while hurling epithets, including gay slurs.  To contact the reporter on this story:
