A U.S. budget agreement that
includes debt reduction needs to be reached to revive economic
growth, former Federal Reserve Chairman  Alan Greenspan  said.  “Unless we remove deep-seated uncertainties, the economy
is not going anywhere,” Greenspan said today during a
“Bloomberg Surveillance” television interview with Sara Eisen
in Washington. The economy will “stay this way unless we remove
a lot of the uncertainty.”  Greenspan said he supports the $2.5 trillion package of
spending cuts and tax increases proposed by Erskine Bowles and
 Alan Simpson . An update of the plan, to be released today in
Washington, includes $740 billion in increased revenue over the
next decade that Republicans have deemed unacceptable and a
higher eligibility age for Medicare that President  Barack Obama 
has rejected.  “The most fundamental issue that needs to be addressed is
getting the budget under control,” Greenspan said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
