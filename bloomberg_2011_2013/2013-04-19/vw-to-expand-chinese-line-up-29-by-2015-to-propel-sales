Volkswagen AG (VOW) , Europe’s largest
automaker, plans to expand its model line-up 29 percent by 2015
in  China , a market the manufacturer sees as crucial in its drive
to take the industry’s global top spot in five years.  Volkswagen will offer 90 cars, sport-utility vehicles, vans
and heavy trucks in the country compared with 70 models now,
 Jochem Heizmann , who runs the automaker’s Chinese operations,
said today at a Shanghai press conference. The company is
targeting 3 million deliveries in China this year, he said.  The carmaker outlined plans in March to increase production
60 percent by 2018 in China, where Wolfsburg, Germany-based VW’s
earnings last year surged by almost half. Volkswagen has set
that year as its deadline for overtaking  Toyota Motor Corp. (7203)  and
 General Motors Co. (GM)  as the world’s biggest carmaker.  VW’s 9.8 billion-euro ($12.8 billion) project to build
factories and develop models in China by 2018 will be the
country’s largest-ever automotive-investment program, Chief
Executive Officer  Martin Winterkorn  said today in a statement
distributed at the press conference held in advance of the
Shanghai Auto Show. The company will expand its workforce by 33
percent to more than 100,000 employees in the period, he said.  New Factories  VW is counting on growth in China and the U.S., along with
gains in the luxury-car segment with the Audi brand, to help
offset declining demand in Europe amid a recession. Targets for
China announced last month include adding seven car plants in
the country, bringing the total to 19, and increasing production
capacity there to 4 million vehicles a year by 2018 from about
2.5 million currently. Including its local joint ventures, VW’s
group sales last year in China totaled 2.81 million vehicles.  “So you heard about the 4 million production capacity,”
VW China Executive Vice President Weiming Soh said at the press
conference today. “I guess as a sales guy I can’t say I will
sell less.”  Audi plans to expand its dealership network 67 percent to
500 outlets in 2017 from about 300 now, Dietmar Voggenreiter,
the unit’s head of Chinese business, said at the briefing.  To contact the reporter on this story:
