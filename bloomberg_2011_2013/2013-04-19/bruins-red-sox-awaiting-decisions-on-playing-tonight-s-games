Red Sox  and Bruins games tonight
were called off as Boston and surrounding areas remained locked
down during a manhunt for a suspect in the  Boston Marathon
bombings .  The Major League Baseball game at Fenway Park between the
Red Sox and the  Kansas City Royals  was postponed “to support
efforts of law enforcement officers,” the team said in a
Twitter post. A makeup date for the contest, the first of a
three-game series, wasn’t announced.  The Bruins’ National Hockey League game against the
Pittsburgh Penguins at TD Garden was postponed as well and
tentatively rescheduled for tomorrow at 12:30 p.m., the Bruins
said on Twitter. The team also said that plans to begin selling
playoff tickets online today was postponed until April 22.  Police are searching for Dzhokar Tsarnaev, 19, who escaped
during a confrontation with police in the Boston suburb of
Watertown, according to a federal law enforcement official.  Public transportation was halted this morning and
Massachusetts Governor  Deval Patrick  asked all residents of
Boston and several surrounding suburbs to stay inside with their
doors locked and allow in only police.  Tsarnaev ran over the other suspect, his older brother
Tamerlan, during the Watertown shootout, according to the
official. A law enforcement officer also was killed and another
was seriously wounded during confrontations that began at 10:30
last night.  The bombing at the finish line of the Boston Marathon on
April 15 killed three people and injured more than 170.  To contact the reporter on this story:
