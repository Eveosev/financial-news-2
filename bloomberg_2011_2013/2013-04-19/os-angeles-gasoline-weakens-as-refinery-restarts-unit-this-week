Transportation fuels on the  spot
market  in  Los Angeles  weakened as  Chevron Corp. (CVX)  was scheduled to
bring the fluid catalytic cracker online this week at its El
Segundo refinery in  Southern California .  Chevron planned to restart the unit, which processes vacuum
gasoil into gasoline and other light products, on April 15 after
finishing repairs, a person with direct knowledge of operations
at the refinery said.  The 279,000-barrel-a-day El Segundo plant, the largest in
the state, supplies 40 percent of the jet fuel to Los Angeles
International Airport and 20 percent of the regionâ€™s gasoline,
San Ramon, California-based Chevron said on its website.  California-blend gasoline, or Carbob, in Los Angeles
weakened by 1.75 cents to 8.5 cents a gallon above futures on
the  New York  Mercantile Exchange at 4:07 p.m., according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. California-blend  diesel  in Los Angeles
was at parity with ultra-low-sulfur diesel futures on the Nymex,
compared with a 1-cent premium yesterday.  Jet fuel  there
weakened 2.75 cents to 3.25 cents below ULSD futures.  Carbob in  San Francisco  retreated 1 cent to a premium of
23.5 cents a gallon. Diesel there weakened by 1 cent to 5 cents
a gallon above futures.  In  Portland ,  Oregon ,  gasoline  and  diesel  remained
unchanged, at premiums of 5.5 cents and 5 cents a gallon,
respectively.  To contact the reporter on this story:
