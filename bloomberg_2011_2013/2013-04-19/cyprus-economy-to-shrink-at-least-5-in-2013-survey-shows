Cyprus’s economy will contract by
at least 5 percent and possibly by more than 15 percent this
year, according to most financial analysts, portfolio managers
and other investment professionals on the island interviewed in
a survey.  About 44 percent of the 72 members of the  Cyprus CFA
Society  who answered the survey said the country’s economic
contraction will be between 5 percent and 10 percent this year.
Another 33 percent said the slump could be as high at 15
percent, while 11 percent predicted a larger decline. Cyprus CFA
Society is the local society of Virginia-based  CFA Institute .  Finance Minister Haris Georgiades this week declined to
give a forecast for how much the economy will shrink this year
after Cypriot President Nicos Anastasiades agreed to measures
including a tax on bank deposits of more than 100,000 euros at
the country’s two biggest banks and the sale of assets to secure
10 billion euros ($13.1 billion) of loans from the euro area
countries and the  International Monetary Fund .  Anastasiades is set to announce later today a series of
measures designed to boost growth as he attempts to restore
confidence after the country’s financial services industry was
irreparably harmed both by the deposit tax and the subsequent
restrictions on capital movement, the first time these have been
imposed in a euro-area country.  Cyprus’s rescue program includes a forecast for gross
domestic product to decline 8.7 percent this year, compared with
a European Commission projection for a 3.5 percent contraction
before the Cypriot bailout was agreed. Government spokesman
Christos Stylianides said on April 4 that GDP could fall by as
much as 13 percent this year.  Return to Growth  Nearly half of those surveyed, or 47 percent, forecast
Cyprus won’t return to economic growth in two consecutive
quarters until between 2015 and 2017, while 31 percent predicted
the economy will continue to contract until between 2017 and
2019. More than eight in 10, or 81 percent, said Cyprus will
recover faster by remaining within the euro area.  Just over 72 percent of those who answered said oil and gas
exploration and exploitation should be one of the main three
drivers of Cyprus’s new growth model, along with the leisure and
casino industries. Almost 71 percent said that the crisis will
have a significant negative affect on industries other than
banking services.  To contact the reporter on this story:
