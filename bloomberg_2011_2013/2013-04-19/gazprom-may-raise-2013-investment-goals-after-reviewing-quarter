OAO Gazprom (GAZP)  may boost its goal for
2013 investment following a review of the first quarter, a month
after a ministry official said the government wasn’t always sure
how  Russia ’s state natural-gas export monopoly spent its money.  “We will look at first-quarter results and decide,”
Chairman Viktor Zubkov told reporters in St. Petersburg. “If
there is additional revenue, then the program will be revised.”
The company “would like it to be towards an increase.”  The board of Gazprom, the world’s biggest gas producer, in
December approved investments for 2013 of 705.4 billion rubles
($22 billion) as the Moscow-based company invests in building
and maintaining pipelines and developing Siberian deposits. It
routinely revises spending plans following the first half.  The government “can’t always see where, how much, and why
so much money is being spent” by Gazprom, Deputy Economy
Minister Sergei Belyakov said in a March interview.  Gazprom declined by 0.3 percent to close at 120.20 rubles
in Moscow trading, the lowest level in more than four years.  To contact the reporters on this story:
