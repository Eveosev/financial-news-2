Bank of Japan (8301)  Governor Haruhiko Kuroda said that Group of 20 nations understand the case for
 Japan ’s unprecedented monetary stimulus and indicated that he
expects no censure for the yen’s slide.  “We aren’t intending to weaken the currency at all,”
Kuroda told reporters today in  Washington , where he’s attending
his first G-20 gathering as central bank chief. The BOJ’s easing
“is for a domestic policy goal to achieve the 2 percent
inflation target at the earliest possible time,” he said.  The G-20 nations will affirm a commitment to avoid
competitive devaluation without singling out any nation,
according to a draft statement prepared for a meeting this week
in Washington, Bloomberg BNA reported. The yen has dropped about
20 percent against the  U.S. dollar  in the past six months, the
biggest loser among 16 major currencies.  “Chances are high that the result of the G-20 meeting will
deliver tailwinds for Japan and yen depreciation,” Takahiro Sekido, a strategist in Tokyo at the Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi
UFJ Ltd., who formerly worked at the BOJ, said ahead of Kuroda’s
comments.  The currency touched 99.95 per dollar last week, the
weakest in four years, and traded at 98.25 as of 7:05 p.m. in
New York.  Asked whether the meeting of finance chiefs and central
bank governors in Washington will consider the risk of Japan
fueling competitive devaluations, Kuroda, 68, said: “That
probably won’t be discussed much.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
