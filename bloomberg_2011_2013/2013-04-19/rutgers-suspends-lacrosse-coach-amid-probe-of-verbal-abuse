Rutgers University  suspended men’s
lacrosse coach Brian Brecht as the school’s police
department investigates allegations of verbal abuse against him,
the school said in a statement.  Brecht was suspended with pay. The length of the suspension
was not announced.  Rutgers fired basketball coach Mike Rice on April 3 over
video of him verbally abusing players, and Athletic Director Tim
Pernetti resigned days later.  To contact the reporter on this story:
