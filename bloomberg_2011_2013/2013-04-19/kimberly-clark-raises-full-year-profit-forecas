Kimberly-Clark Corp. (KMB)  jumped the
most in more than three years after the maker of Kleenex tissues
and Huggies diapers boosted its annual earnings forecast amid
sales growth in its North American tissues unit.  The shares  rose  4.7 percent to $106.10 at the close in New
York for the biggest one-day gain since October 2009. Kimberly-
Clark has advanced 26 percent this year,  compared  with an 9
percent increase for the Standard & Poor’s Index.  Profit this year will be $5.60 to $5.75 per share, up from
a prior forecast of $5.50 to $5.65, the Dallas-based company
said in a statement. Analysts had estimated $5.59 a share on
average, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Kimberly-Clark, which in October said it would exit most of
its diaper business in Western and  Central Europe  as it cuts
expenses, reported a 3 percent rise in organic sales volume in
the first quarter. The advance was aided by a sales increase in
its North American consumer-tissue and K.C. International units,
the company said. The rise excluded the effect of foreign-
currency changes and lost sales from the European strategic
changes, the company said.  “The first-quarter results reflect the benefit of the
stronger flu season, healthy cost savings, and very modest
inflation,”  Connie Maneaty , a BMO Capital Markets analyst,
wrote in a investor note today. She rates the shares
underperform, the equivalent of a sell.  Flu Season  Kimberly-Clark’s first-quarter profit, excluding some
items, rose to a record $1.48 a share, from $1.24 a year
earlier. Analysts had projected $1.34 on average.  Revenue rose 1.5 percent to $5.32 billion, the company
said. Analysts had estimated $5.27 billion. Net income climbed
about 13 percent to $531 million, or $1.36 a share, from $468
million, or $1.18.  Organic sales during the period included a 6 percent
increase in North American consumer tissue and 5 percent advance
in K-C International, the company said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
