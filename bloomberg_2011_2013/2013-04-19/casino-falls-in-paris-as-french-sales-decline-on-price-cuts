Casino Guichard-Perrachon SA (CO) , the
owner of  France ’s Monoprix and Geant supermarket chains, fell in
Paris trading after saying first-quarter organic sales in its
home market slid 3.4 percent because of price cuts.  The decrease was led by a 12 percent drop in revenue at
Geant Casino hypermarkets, excluding gasoline and calendar
effects, the St. Etienne, France-based retailer said yesterday
after markets closed. French shoppers are cautious about prices
and want to strictly monitor their budgets, Finance Director
Antoine Giscard D’Estaing said on a conference call.  The shares fell as much as 2.8 percent to 78.06 euros and
were trading at 79 euros as of 9:34 a.m. local time.  Revenue from continuing operations climbed 34 percent to
11.7 billion euros ($15.5 billion), led by Latin America after
the consolidation of  Brazil ’s Cia Brasileira de Distribuicao
Grupo Pao de Acucar. Analysts predicted 11.5 billion euros,
according to the average of 10 estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
