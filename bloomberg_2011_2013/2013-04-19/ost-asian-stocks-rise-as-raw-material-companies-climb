Asian  stocks  rose, paring this
week’s losses, as Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. led
technology shares higher and mining companies rebounded.  TSMC, as the biggest contract maker of chips is known,
jumped 6.6 percent in Taipei after forecasting record quarterly
sales. Rio Tinto Group, the world’s No. 2 mining company,
climbed 4.3 percent in Sydney after a six-day, 11 percent
decline. Industrial and Commercial Bank of China Ltd., the
world’s No. 1 lender by market value, rose 4 percent amid
speculation China will widen the  yuan ’s trading band next week.  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index gained 0.5 percent to 136.43 as
of 6:12 p.m. in  Tokyo , reversing a decline of 0.3 percent. A
gauge of material producers in the measure increased 1.4
percent, paring its weekly loss to 4 percent.  “The sell-down looks overdone,” said  Daphne Roth ,
Singapore-based head of Asia equity research at ABN Amro Private
Bank, which oversees about $207 billion. “We still see that
global economic growth will pick up in the second half of the
year, although positive economic surprises from the U.S. will
likely be fewer. Equities as an asset class still look cheap.”  Almost two shares rose for each that fell on the Asia-
Pacific gauge. The measure is heading for a 1.2 percent decline
this week after China’s economy expanded less than economists
estimated and the International Monetary Fund cut its global
growth forecast.  Relative Value  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index advanced 5 percent this year
through yesterday, led by Japanese shares, amid optimism the
Bank of  Japan  will step up efforts to stimulate the economy.
Shares on the benchmark gauge traded at 13.7 times estimated
earnings compared with 13.9 for the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index
and 12.3 times for the Stoxx Europe 600 Index, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  Japan’s Nikkei 225 Stock Average rose 0.7 percent. South
Korea’s  Kospi index  gained 0.4 percent, erasing earlier losses
of as much as 0.6 percent.  Australia ’s S&P/ASX 200 Index added
0.2 percent. Taiwan’s Taiex Index climbed 1.8 percent.  China ’s
Shanghai Composite Index jumped 2.1 percent.  Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index advanced 2.3 percent, the most
since Jan. 2. Morgan Stanley raised its outlook for stocks in
the MSCI Hong Kong Index to overweight, according to a report
written by analyst Jonathan Garner, citing strong earnings
revisions and undemanding valuations.  Futures on the S&P 500 Index rose 0.6 percent today. The
gauge yesterday fell 0.7 percent as earnings from UnitedHealth
Group Inc. to EBay Inc. disappointed investors, a measure of
manufacturing in the Philadelphia region expanded at a slower
pace and the Conference Board’s index of U.S. leading economic
indicators unexpectedly declined for the first time in seven
months.  TSMC, Lenovo  Information-technology companies and raw-material producers
posted the  biggest advance  among the 10 industry groups in the
 MSCI Asia Pacific Index. (MXAP)   TSMC jumped 6.6 percent to NT$106.5 in Taipei. The company
forecast second-quarter revenue will be between NT$154 billion
($5.2 billion) and NT$156 billion. That’s at least 9 percent
higher than the NT$141.2 billion average of 21 analyst estimates
compiled by Bloomberg.  Tokyo Electron Ltd. (8035) , Japan’s biggest chip-making equipment
maker, gained 7.1 percent to 4,535 yen after topping estimates
for operating profit.  Lenovo Group Ltd., the world’s second-largest maker of
personal computers, advanced 9.5 percent to HK$7.06 in Hong
Kong. The Chinese company has emerged as the most likely bidder
for International Business Machines Corp.’s low-end server
business, a person familiar with the matter said.  Raw-material producers advanced. Rio Tinto climbed 4.3
percent to A$54.32 in Sydney.  Newcrest Mining Ltd. (NCM) , Australia’s
biggest gold producer, rose 4.8 percent to A$16.65, paring its
biggest weekly loss since October 2008. BHP Billiton Ltd., the
world’s largest mining company, gained 2.5 percent to A$31.40.  Chinese Yuan  Chinese lenders rose. The government will probably widen
the yuan’s trading band by the end of the coming weekend after
People’s Bank of China Deputy Governor  Yi Gang  signaled policy
makers will loosen control over the currency, according to UBS
AG. The move may be announced as finance chiefs from the Group
of 20 nations meet in  Washington  this week, UBS analysts Manik
Narain and  Geoffrey Yu  wrote in a note.  ICBC, as China’s largest lender is known, rose 4 percent to
HK$5.26 in Hong Kong.  China Construction Bank Corp. (939) , the second-
biggest, increased 3.7 percent to HK$6.24. Agricultural Bank of
China Ltd. climbed 3.88 percent to HK$3.53.  Among stocks that fell, Celltrion Inc. tumbled 15 percent
to 31,350 won in  Seoul . The company said it postponed a late-
stage trial of a biosimilar version of Roche Holding AG’s best-
selling Rituxan drug used in treating non-Hodgkin lymphoma
patients, potentially benefiting competitors such as Boehringer
Ingelheim GmbH and Novartis AG.  To contact the reporter on this story:
