The naira weakened for a fourth
day, set for its worst week in five, as Nigerian oil companies’
dollar sales were said to wane and on weaker prices of the
nation’s main export grade crude.  The currency of  Africa ’s biggest oil producer depreciated
0.1 percent to 158.7 per dollar by 11:37 a.m. in Lagos, the
commercial capital, bringing its loss this week to 0.5 percent,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  “The naira weakened on the lack of meaningful capital
inflows and because the foreign exchange sales from oil
companies have dried up on the supply side,”  Samir Gadio , a
London-based strategist at Standard Bank Group Ltd., said in e-
mailed comments today. “Added to this, the more bearish market
environment associated with the weaker oil price in recent weeks
also weighed negatively on the currency.”  Oil companies are the second-biggest source of dollars
after the Central Bank of Nigeria, which offers foreign currency
at auctions on Mondays and Wednesdays to maintain exchange-rate
stability. The Abuja-based regulator  sold $498.67 million  this
week, down from $600 million last week.  Qua Iboe, the nation’s main export grade, dropped for a
third week, down 2.2 percent to $101.60 per barrel over the past
five days. Nigeria depends on crude exports for 80 percent of
government revenue and 95 percent of its export income.  “As long as there is no qualitative leg down in the oil
price to $95 per barrel or below, we suspect the pressure on the
unit will remain under control,” said Gadio.  Borrowing costs on Nigeria’s local-currency debt due
January 2022 rose for a third day, up 35 basis points, or 0.35
percentage point, to 11.48 percent, according to yesterday’s
prices compiled by Bloomberg.  Yields on Nigeria’s $500 million of Eurobonds due January
2021 fell four basis points to 4.01 percent today.  Ghana ’s cedi was unchanged at 1.9525 per dollar in Accra,
the capital.  To contact the reporter on this story:
