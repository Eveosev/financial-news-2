Patient safety  at U.S. hospitals is
hampered by inadequate teamwork and communication, as well as a
negative culture, according to a study by insurer  American
International Group Inc. (AIG)   More than half of hospital risk managers and 42 percent of
executives surveyed by AIG said the top safety threat was tied
to teamwork, communications or culture, according to a statement
today from the New York-based insurer.  AIG, the insurer that repaid a U.S. bailout in December,
provides coverage against risks such as medical liability and
property damage to more than 2,000 hospitals and offers workers’
compensation insurance. AIG said it surveyed 250 U.S. hospital
executives and 100 risk managers by phone as part of its effort
to help improve patient safety and lower costs.  “Improvements in patient safety will provide a quick
return on investment,” Emily Rhinehart, division manager for
health care risk consulting at AIG, said in the statement.  Other impediments to patient safety include so-called
handoffs of patients among hospital staff, burdens tied to
documentation and the perception that nurses fear retribution if
they discuss safety, according to the study. A majority of both
risk managers and executives said patient safety was their No. 1
priority for 2013.  To contact the reporter on this story:
