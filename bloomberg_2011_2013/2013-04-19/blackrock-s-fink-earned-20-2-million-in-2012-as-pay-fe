BlackRock Inc. (BLK) , the world’s biggest
money manager, paid Chief Executive Officer Laurence D. Fink
$20.2 million in 2012, a 7.5 percent decrease from the prior
year.  Fink received $500,000 in salary, $8.6 million in a cash
bonus, $10.9 million in stock awards and $187,350 in other
compensation, according to a proxy  filing  today that calculated
pay using U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission rules. Fink
earned $21.9 million in total compensation in 2011, according to
the filing.  Fink, 60, oversees $3.94 trillion in assets as head of
BlackRock. The decrease in Fink’s compensation resulted from his
stock award declining 16 percent and other compensation dropping
2.5 percent. BlackRock President Robert S. Kapito’s compensation
fell 9.1 percent to $15.4 million, also driven by a reduced
stock award.  BlackRock’s  shares  rose 16 percent last year, compared with
a 25 percent increase in the 20-company Standard & Poor’s index
of asset managers and custody banks. Net income for  New York- 
based BlackRock in 2012 rose 5 percent from a year earlier to
$2.46 billion. Assets under management increased 8 percent.  If pay is calculated using BlackRock’s analysis, Fink
earned $21.5 million, or a 10 percent increase from a year
earlier, according to the filing.  To contact the reporter on this story:
