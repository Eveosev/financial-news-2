TransCanada Corp. (TRP) ’s power to
condemn land as a common carrier won’t be reviewed by the  Texas 
Supreme Court in one of four state-court challenges against the
Keystone XL pipeline, which will carry Canadian tar-sands oil to
the Texas coast.  The Texas Supreme Court today refused to hear a challenge
by Rhinoceros Ventures Group Inc., whose property lies near the
industry refinery hub at Beaumont, Texas. The court denied the
petition without comment.  The landowners had urged the court to use its 2011 ruling
in another pipeline case to withhold condemnation powers from
interstate pipelines that bring out-of-state crude into Texas.
The company had argued that interpretation could shut down
interstate pipelines and “sever the arteries that fuel the very
heart of the Texas Gulf Coast refining complex,” Tom Zabel, one
of TransCanada’s attorneys, said in a March 27 filing.  TransCanada still faces three more court cases by other
Texas landowners challenging Keystone XL’s right to condemn
easements across their properties on slightly different legal
theories. None of these court challenges has so far prevented
the company from continuing to install the southern leg of its
2,151-mile line between western  Canada  and the Texas coast.  The case is Rhinoceros Ventures Group Inc. v. TransCanada
Keystone Pipeline LP, 12-1019, Supreme Court of Texas.  To contact the reporter on this story:
