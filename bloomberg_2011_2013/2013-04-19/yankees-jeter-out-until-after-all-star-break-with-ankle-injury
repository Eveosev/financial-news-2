New York  Yankees shortstop Derek Jeter will be sidelined until after Major League Baseball’s mid-
July All-Star break due to a setback in his recovery from
October ankle surgery, the team said.  Jeter, who hasn’t played in a regular-season game since
breaking his left  ankle during last year’s playoffs, had an
exam yesterday that revealed a “small crack in the area of his
previous injury,” General Manager Brian Cashman told reporters.  The 38-year-old Jeter, a 13-time All-Star, was cleared to
return to action on March 7 and played during spring training
before feeling discomfort. Initial tests showed mild
inflammation of the ankle and Cashman said the week before the
season began that he hoped Jeter could play by April 6.  “This is a new fracture, but a small one,” Cashman said
yesterday in a news conference, adding that more surgery should
not be necessary. “It’s a setback, so it’s not a good
situation.”  Jeter batted .316 with an American League-best 216 hits
last season. His 3,304 career hits rank 11th on the MLB list.  New York is 8-6 this season, 2 1/2 games behind the Boston
Red Sox in the AL East, after losing 6-2 last night in 12
innings to the visiting  Arizona  Diamondbacks. The All-Star Game
is July 16 at the New York Mets’ Citi Field.  To contact the reporter on this story:
