Colombia ’s peso bond yields fell
for a fourth day amid speculation that declines this month in
long-term debt were excessive and as traders reinvested the
proceeds of local bonds that matured.  Yields on the government’s peso bonds maturing in 2024 fell
two basis points, or 0.02 percentage point, to 4.89 percent at
the close of trading in Bogota, pushing the decline this week to
11 basis points, according to the central bank. The spread
between the benchmark bond and the central bank’s overnight rate
rose to 1.64 percentage point today from 1.02 percentage points
two months ago.  “The curve has been steepening and that’s creating
attractive levels given inflation is controlled and the central
bank likely won’t be hiking rates anytime soon,” John Jairo Ramirez, an analyst at brokerage Bolsa y Renta SA, said in a
telephone interview from Medellin.  5.1 trillion pesos ($2.8 billion) were injected into the
market this month from peso bonds that matured, said Ramirez.  The peso appreciated 0.2 percent to 1,837.08 per dollar. It
dropped 0.6 percent this week and 3.8 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
