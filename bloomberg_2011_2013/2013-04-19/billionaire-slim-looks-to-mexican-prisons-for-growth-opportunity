Billionaire  Carlos Slim  is entering
the business of managing Mexican prisons to expand the
investments of his construction-financing company.  Along with Slim’s bank Grupo Financiero Inbursa SAB, the
builder, known as Ideal, is acquiring stakes in two federal
prisons from Desarrolladora Homex SAB. The homebuilder said it
would receive about 4 billion pesos ($326 million) from Slim’s
companies under the agreement.  While Homex plans to keep working on the operation of the
two prisons, Ideal would also participate, Inbursa Chairman
Marco Antonio Slim said in an e-mail. That would add prisons to
the portfolio of assets managed by the construction company,
including toll roads, hydroelectric dams and water-treatment
facilities.  Marco Antonio Slim, a son of the billionaire, didn’t
provide further details, and representatives of Mexico City-
based Ideal had no immediate comment.  Ideal, whose formal name is Impulsora del Desarrollo y el
Empleo en America Latina SAB, was  unchanged  at 26.20 pesos at
the close in Mexico City. Culiacan, Mexico-based Homex, which is
using the deal to pay down debt and fund working capital, gained
40 percent to 16.89 pesos.  To contact the reporter on this story:
