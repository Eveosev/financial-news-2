â€œI used to think it was possible for an artist to alter the inner life of the culture," wrote Don DeLillo in his 1991 novel "Mao II." "Now bomb-makers & gunmen have taken that territory."   As this morning's police standoff unfolded in Watertown, Massachusetts, that line popped into the head of the author Tom Vanderbilt, who  tweeted  (to much "favoriting" from his 6,000 followers): "Not sure whether to follow Twitter or just drag the DeLillo down from the shelf." DeLillo's theme has been contagious since bombs went off at the finish line of the Boston Marathon on Monday afternoon. As Bloomberg View's Stephen L. Carter  put it :  The big difference between DeLillo's 1991 and Carter's 2013, of course, is the Internet. Not only is the audience emphatically larger, not only are there a seemingly infinite number of ways to become engaged, but consider, too, that the Web, being a two-way form of communication, has blurred the distinction between performer and spectator in the theater of terrorism. The most obvious example, perhaps, has been the crowdsourcing of the investigation on sites such as  4chan  and  Reddit , where members have been collectively poring over images of the bombing scene in search of clues to the perpetrators. This  outraged  the Atlantic's Alexis C. Madrigal: The New Yorker's Matt Buchanan, however,  embraced  the upside of the inevitable:  As of now, it seems, the only real breakthrough Reddit accomplished was tracking down a junior soccer club team  picture  that included the alleged bomber Dzhokar Tsarnaev. But such prosaic unearthings -- Dzhokar apparently got a $2,500 scholarship from the City of Cambridge; on a  Russian social media site  he listed his "world view" as "Islam" and his personal priority as "career and money" -- aren't useless. They are the first steps in filling out a personality profile that will help us make sense of the tragedy. The brothers, being young, also had their own interactions with social media, one of which now seems highly significant. Mother Jones's Adam Serwer brought to light a  YouTube video  that seems to have been created by Tamerlan Tsarnaev, who was killed by police Friday morning. As Serwer notes, former FBI interrogator Ali Soufan (a frequent Bloomberg View  contributor ) has described the importance of this prophesy to global Islamic militants in his book "The Black Banners":  Yes, it's a long way from the Russian war in Chechnya to Boylston Street in Boston. There may prove to be no connection. But we can be certain that that widely disseminated speculation about major news events is no longer the exclusive province of TV talking heads. This is not necessarily a bad thing. The discussion on Web sites, blogs and social media over the past 12 hours has already pushed forward a number of themes and observations that will be valuable in making sense of what happened at the Boston Marathon finish line. It is certainly an improvement on hours of television anchors filling dead air time with banalities. The downside is equally obvious. For starters, the Web has brought us plenty of distractions, red herrings and apparently some  fabrications . More important is the effect on what DeLillo called the inner life of culture. Strategically, the bombing has to be seen as something of a failure: Three tragic deaths won't do much for the cause that motivated the killers. Yet, as the Washington Examiner's Timothy P. Carney  tweeted : "Think about the reaction they've gotten: the thousands of law enforcement; the million people on lock down. Does that mean they succeeded?"
