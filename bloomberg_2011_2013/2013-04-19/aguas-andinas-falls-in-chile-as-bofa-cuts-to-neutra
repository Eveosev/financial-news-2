Aguas Andinas SA (AGUAS/A)  fell the most in
three weeks after Bank of America Corp. cut its recommendation
on  Chile ’s largest water utility to the equivalent of hold,
saying the stock was overvalued compared with peers.  Aguas Andinas dropped 1.5 percent to 396.47 pesos, its
biggest decline since March 25 on a closing basis and ending a
four-day streak of gains. The stock was the worst performer
today on Chile’s benchmark  Ipsa index , which rose 0.6 percent.  Bank of America cut the  rating  to neutral from buy and
maintained its price target at 420 pesos per share, according to
an e-mailed note to clients yesterday. The stock’s gains will be
limited after rising 17 percent this year, the bank said.  “Outlook remains positive, but with limited upside,” Bank
of America analysts Diego Moreno, Felipe Leal and Luiz Antonio Leite wrote. “In our view the share price has run ahead of its
fundamentals.”  Aguas Andinas, based in Santiago, is still the best
performer on the Ipsa this year after retailer  Forus SA (FORUS) , which
has increased 18 percent.  Inversiones Aguas Metropolitanas SA (IAM) ,
Aguas Andinas’s controller, has advanced 7.8 percent in 2013.  Brazilian water company  Cia. de Saneamento Basico do Estado
de  Sao Paulo , or Sabesp, is Bank of America’s top pick in the
water-utilities sector, the analysts wrote in yesterday’s note.  Aguas Andinas must return about $5 million to customers as
compensation for cuts in service in January and February,
according to a  statement  posted yesterday on the company’s
website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
