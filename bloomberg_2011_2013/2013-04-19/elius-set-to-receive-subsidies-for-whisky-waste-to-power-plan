Helius Energy Plc (HEGY) ’s plant in
 Scotland  that generates power using waste products from whisky
production is set to start receiving premium payments for its
electricity under Britain’s renewables support program.  The company’s 8.3-megawatt facility in Rothes, northeast
Scotland, is eligible for about  43.8 pounds  ($67) for every
megawatt-hour of power produced under the Renewable Obligation
program. The plant can generate enough electricity for about
9,000 homes, London-based Helius said today in a  statement .  Construction began last year and cost about 60.5 million
pounds, according to the statement. Heat and power produced from
biomass that includes agricultural waste and wood chips may meet
8 percent to 11 percent of primary energy demand in eight years,
the Department of Energy and Climate Change says.  Helius plans to build biomass projects including a 100-
megawatt wood-to-power plant in Avonmouth, southwest  England .  To contact the reporter on this story:
