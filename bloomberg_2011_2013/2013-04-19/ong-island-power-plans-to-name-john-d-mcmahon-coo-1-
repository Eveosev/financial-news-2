The Long Island Power Authority is
expected to appoint former Consolidated Edison Inc. executive
John D. McMahon as chief operating officer, filling an opening
created after the agency was criticized for its  Hurricane Sandy 
response.  Trustees are expected to vote today to appoint McMahon to
replace Mike Taunton, who has served in the top operating role
on a temporary basis, the Uniondale, New York-based authority
said in an e-mailed statement. Taunton will continue to serve as
chief financial officer.  Michael Hervey, the previous COO, tendered his resignation
after LIPA was criticized for storm preparations and response
that left 1 million customers in the dark, some for more than
two weeks after Sandy knocked down trees and power lines. A
panel appointed by New York Governor Andrew Cuomo, a Democrat,
to investigate the authority’s management practices recommended
in January that it be converted into an investor-owned utility.  “John is coming to LIPA at a critical time in its history
and we are excited about the expertise he brings to the
organization,” Larry Waldman, chairman of the authority’s
board, said in the statement.  McMahon spent 35 years at  Con Edison (ED) , owner of New York’s
largest utility. He served as its general counsel and chief
executive officer of its Orange & Rockland Utilities unit, which
serves customers in upstate New York.  To contact the reporter on this story:
