Gold futures topped $1,400 an ounce on signs that jewelers and other users of the metal are taking advantage of the biggest slump in prices in three decades.  A rush in  India  to buy jewelry and coins will boost gold imports this quarter as traders and banks run out of inventory, Mohit Kamboj, the president of the Bombay Bullion Association Ltd., said yesterday. Customer traffic in Hong Kong and Macau soared from April 13 to April 16,  Chow Tai Fook Jewellery Group Ltd. (1929)  said.

The metal plunged 13 percent in two sessions through April 15, the biggest slump since 1980. Futures touched $1,321.50 on April 16, the lowest since January 2011, partly on concern that central banks in  Europe  will sell holdings to pay debt. The price will rebound as skepticism over the recovery in the global economy increases demand, billionaire T.S. Kalyanaraman, the chairman of Kalyan Jewellers, said.  “The gold price is finally reacting to the physical demand,” Tim Gardiner, a managing director at TD Securities Inc. in  New York , said in an e-mail. “Reports of record demand keep coming in from around the globe with retailers in  North America , Europe and Asia-Pacific all out or running out of stock as buying interest overwhelms supply.”  Gold futures for June delivery climbed 0.2 percent to settle at $1,395.60 at 1:35 p.m. on the Comex in New York. Earlier, the price reached $1,424.70, up 7.8 percent from the low on April 16. India is the world’s biggest buyer, followed by  China .  $1,800 Forecast  The price will climb to $1,800, Kalyanaraman of Kalyan Jewellers said an e-mail. The closely held company is based in Thrissur, Kerala, in India. Chow Tai Fook, the world’s largest jewelry chain, is based in  Hong Kong .
