German Finance Minister  Wolfgang Schaeuble  said Europe is moving gradually toward a banking union
and is on its way toward solving the issue of existing bad debt
in the banking industry.  “We’re working step-by-step in the direction of a European
banking union to separate the risks of sovereign debts and the
banking system,” Schaeuble said in a speech in English at the
 Council on Foreign Relations  in  Washington . “We’re on the way
and we’ll find a common solution” for the “very complicated
issue of legacy” debt, the minister said.  Europe, which has been “over-banked,” needs “a strong
and a European supervision of banks,” Schaeuble said.
Implementation of the Single Supervisory Mechanism in coming
weeks is an important step on the way, he said.  The  European Central Bank  is set to take on oversight
powers over all euro-area banks next year after the legislation
underpinning the supervisory system was signed off yesterday in
Brussels. Irish Finance Minister  Michael Noonan , whose country
holds the EU’s rotating presidency, said the next building
blocks on the way to a banking union should be bank resolution
and deposit guarantees.  Schaeuble and Jens Weidmann, the country’s central bank
chief, said earlier today that treaty changes are needed to put
a future European banking union on a sound legal footing. As
Germany’s highest court is strict about monitoring the legality
of transfers of power away from the government and parliament,
“limited treaty change” will be necessary, Schaeuble said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
