A taxpayer bailout of the U.S.
 Postal Service  would cost about $58 billion through 2017, which
Congress could avoid by changing the agency’s business model,
Postmaster General Patrick Donahoe said.  The service, which lost $15.9 billion last year, doesn’t
want a bailout, and it would be “unnecessary,” Donahoe said
today in prepared remarks for a speech at the  National Press
Club  in Washington.  “It may shock you to learn that the Postal Service could
be profitable today and for the long-term future; it just needs
to operate differently,” he said. “I’m optimistic that
Congress will pass a bill this year.”  Leaders of House and Senate committees overseeing the
Postal Service had planned to meet this week to begin work on
legislation. The two chambers, each controlled by a different
political party, last year didn’t agree on what should be in a
postal bill.  Donahoe, at a House oversight hearing April 17, called on
Congress to ease a requirement that the Postal Service pay in
advance for future retirees’ health-care benefits and to let the
agency exit the health plan covering U.S. government workers, in
favor of setting up its own.  The service also wants more power to raise prices and sell
non-postal products.  The postmaster general on April 10 was told by his board to
stand down on plans to end Saturday mail delivery in August, a
move he said would save $2 billion a year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
