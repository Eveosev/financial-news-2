The leu appreciated to the highest
level in more than a month after  Romania ’s investment-grade
credit ranking was affirmed by Fitch Ratings yesterday and the
government sold five-year bonds at the lowest yield on record.  The currency expanded its advance this year as Fitch
maintained Romania’s long-term government bond rating at BBB-,
the lowest investment grade, with a stable outlook. Borrowing
costs reached a record low at a sale of five-year bonds
yesterday as demand for the country’s debt remains elevated amid
inclusion in major emerging-market indexes.  “The leu made up some ground, after Fitch reaffirmed
Romania’s sovereign credit rating,” Mihai Patrulescu, a
Bucharest-based senior economist at UniCredit Tiriac Bank SA
wrote in a note today. “The significant downward adjustment on
issuance costs over a short time frame is indicative of the
large interest for Romanian bonds.”  The leu advanced 0.2 percent to 4.3670 per euro by 11:16
a.m. in Bucharest, the strongest on a closing basis since March
8, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The currency added
1.9 percent this year, the best performer among eastern European
and African peers tracked by Bloomberg.  The government raised the planned 500 million lei ($150
million) in a reopening of securities due November 2018 at an
average yield of 5.09 percent. That compares with a rate of 5.5
percent for similar-maturity debt auctioned on April 4. Demand
totaled 1.36 billion lei compared with 1.48 billion lei at the
previous sale.  To contact the reporter on this story:
