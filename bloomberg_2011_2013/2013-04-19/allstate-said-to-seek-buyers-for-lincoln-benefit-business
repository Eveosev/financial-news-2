Allstate Corp. (ALL) , the largest
publicly traded U.S. home and auto insurer, is seeking potential
buyers for its Lincoln Benefit Life Co. subsidiary, three people
familiar with the matter said.  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)  was engaged by Northbrook,
Illinois-based Allstate to solicit offers for Lincoln, said the
people, who declined to be identified because the matter isn’t
public.  Insurers have sought to sell life and annuities assets as
low interest rates pressure returns.  Axa SA (CS)  agreed this month to
sell a U.S. life unit to Protective Life Corp. as part of a
$1.06 billion transaction. Sun Life Financial Inc. announced a
deal in December to sell its U.S. annuity business for $1.35
billion.  Lincoln Benefit became a subsidiary of Allstate’s life-
insurance company in 1984 and offers whole, term, and universal
coverage, according to its website. It had  $2 billion  in assets
and $321.4 million in surplus, a measure of assets minus
liabilities, at the end of 2012, according to a filing with
state regulators. It generated $46.7 million in cash from
operations and $54.5 million from investments last year, the
filing shows.  Maryellen Thielen, a spokeswoman for Allstate, said the
insurer doesn’t comment on rumor or speculation.  Michael DuVally , a Goldman Sachs spokesman, declined to comment.  To contact the reporters on this story:
