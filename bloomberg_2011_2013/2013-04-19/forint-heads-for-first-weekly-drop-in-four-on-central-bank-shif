The forint headed for the first
weekly drop in four on speculation that an overhaul of policy
instruments announced by  Hungary ’s central bank President Gyorgy Matolcsy will loosen monetary conditions.  The central bank proposes to limit eligibility in its two-
week bill facility to exclude foreign banks not active in
lending in Hungary, Matolcsy said, according to an MTI news
service report yesterday. The bank is only at the start of its
renewal of monetary policy, said Matolcsy, the former economy
minister who took over at the bank last month.  The overhaul may lead to “depreciation pressures” and
increased forint volatility as capital is withdrawn from local
assets,  Eszter Gargyan , a Budapest-based economist at Citigroup
Inc., wrote in an e-mailed report today.  Hungary’s currency depreciated 0.1 percent to 298.84 per
euro by 10:28 a.m. in Budapest, set for a 1.2 percent drop this
week. Yields on the government’s 10-year bonds slid four basis
points, or 0.04 percentage point, to 5.546 percent, the lowest
since 2005.  The Magyar Nemzeti Bank’s two-week facility “may lose its
function as an anchor to short-term  interest rates ” as a result
of the planned changes, adding to “uncertainty about a sharp
decline in effective interest rates,” Citigroup’s Gargyan said.  The central bank’s Monetary Council will probably reduce
its  benchmark rate  by 25 basis points to a record 4.75 percent
on April 23, according to 20 out of 21 analysts in a Bloomberg
survey. One economist forecasts a 50 basis point cut.  To contact the reporter on this story:
