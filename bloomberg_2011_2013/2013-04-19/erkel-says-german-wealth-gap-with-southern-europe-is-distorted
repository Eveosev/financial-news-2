Data suggesting that people in
Spain, Cyprus and  Greece  are richer than Germans understate the
level of prosperity in  Germany ,  Chancellor Angela Merkel  said.  “The statistics are distorted,” Merkel said in an
 interview  with Bild, Germany’s most-read newspaper, posted on
her government’s website today. Many more people in southern
euro-area countries own homes as a type of old-age insurance
than in Germany, and the data exclude Germans’ retirement
entitlements and assets abroad, she said.  Debate about differences in household wealth in Europe was
stoked by headlines in German media on a European Central Bank
report published April 9 that showed households in Cyprus with
median net wealth of 266,900 euros ($349,320), the second-
highest in the euro area behind Luxembourg. Germany, at 51,400
euros,  ranked last  among the 15 euro countries surveyed. Cyprus
secured a European Union-led bailout last month.  Asked by Bild whether Germany “is an example for  Europe ,
even the lead nation,” Merkel said that Germany “is a country
where you can see very well that reforms work.”  Economic overhauls in southern European countries “require
painful cuts, it’s true, and I know that many people are
suffering,” she said. Even so, prosperity funded by debt and
deficits “doesn’t work anymore -- that has to be clear to
everyone.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
