Natural gas futures rose to a 21-
month high in New York, capping the ninth weekly gain in a
record streak, on speculation that forecasts of unusually cold
weather next week will buoy U.S. heating-fuel demand.  Gas increased 0.2 percent after MDA Weather Services in
Gaithersburg,  Maryland , predicted below-normal temperatures in
the central and southeast U.S. states through April 28. Prices
have surged 32 percent this year as an unusually cold start to
spring spurred heating-fuel demand and created a record supply
deficit. Gas fell to a 10-year low of $1.902 per million British
thermal units one year ago today after stockpiles ballooned
during the fourth-warmest U.S. winter on record.  “Fundamentally, the weather is still siding with the
bulls,” said Brad Florer, a trader at Kottke Associates LLC in
Louisville,  Kentucky . “It’s chilly here today. We are expecting
below-normal temperatures for a while. The storage situation
continues to favor the bulls.”  Natural gas for May delivery rose 0.7 cent to $4.408 per
million Btu on the  New York Mercantile Exchange , the highest
settlement since July 20, 2011. The futures climbed 4.4 percent
this week, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Trading
volume was 15 percent below the 100-day average at 2:48 p.m.  The discount of May contracts to October narrowed 0.5 cent
to 7.3 cents. The discount of October to January narrowed 0.2
cent to 27.8 cents.  June $4.55 calls were the most active gas options in
electronic trading. They were 0.4 cent lower at 13.7 cents per
million Btu on volume of 840 contracts as of 3:41 p.m. Calls
accounted for 60 percent of options volume.  Options Volatility  Implied volatility for at-the-money gas options expiring in
June was 31.85 percent at 3:30 p.m., down from 32.51 percent
yesterday.  The temperature in  Chicago  on April 23 may be 34 degrees
Fahrenheit (1 Celsius), 10 lower than the usual reading,
according to AccuWeather Inc. in  State College ,  Pennsylvania .
 Dallas  may 13 below normal at 45 degrees.  About 50 percent of U.S. households use gas for heating,
according to the Energy Information Administration, the
statistical arm of the Energy Department.  Gas consumption 
typically slumps after the winter heating season and before hot
weather boosts demand for electricity to run air conditioners.  Gas inventories rose 31 billion cubic feet in the week
ended April 12 to 1.704 trillion, EIA data showed yesterday.
Analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg and a survey of
Bloomberg users predicted a gain of 38 billion. Supplies were
4.2 percent below the five-year average, compared with 3.8
percent the previous week.  Inventory Gain  The stockpile increase, the first since Dec. 7, was smaller
than the five-year average gain for the week of 39 billion cubic
feet.  The number of  rigs drilling  for gas rose by two this week
to 379, the most in three weeks,  Baker Hughes Inc. (BHI)  said today.
The count has fallen 12 percent this year.  Gas production will climb to an all-time high this year as
gains from shale deposits such as the Marcellus in the Northeast
make up for declines from dry-gas wells elsewhere, according to
the EIA. U.S. marketed output will average 69.33  billion cubic
feet a day, up 0.3 percent from last year’s average of 69.12
billion, the government said in its April 9  Short-Term Energy
Outlook .  The boom in oil and natural gas output helped the U.S. cut
its reliance on imported fuel. The U.S. produced 84 percent of
its own energy in 2012, the most since 1991, EIA data show. The
measure of self-sufficiency rose to 88 percent in December, the
highest since February 1987.  To contact the reporter on this story:
