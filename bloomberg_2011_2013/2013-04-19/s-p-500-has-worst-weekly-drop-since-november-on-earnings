U.S. stocks  fell for the week,
sending the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index to the biggest retreat
since November, as earnings from Bank of America Corp. and
International Business Machines Corp. missed estimates and
 China ’s economic growth unexpectedly slowed.  Equities rose on the final day as companies from Microsoft
Corp. to Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc. posted better-than-
anticipated results. Bank of America and  IBM (IBM)  sank at least 4.2
percent for the week. Apple Inc. declined 9.1 percent as one of
its suppliers reported an inventory glut. Freeport-McMoRan
Copper & Gold Inc. and Nabors Industries Ltd. tumbled more than
7.8 percent amid plunging commodity prices.  The  S&P 500  slipped 2.1 percent to 1,555.25 over the five
days, trimming its gain for the year to 9.1 percent. The  Dow
Jones Industrial Average  declined 317.55 points, or 2.1 percent,
to 14,547.51 for the worst week since June 1.  “Everyone has been waiting for a pullback and here it
is,” Andres Garcia-Amaya, New York-based global market
strategist at JPMorgan Chase & Co.’s mutual funds unit, which
oversees $400 billion in assets, said by phone. “The market is
just reflecting that we’re experiencing a soft patch when it
comes to economic data. Companies are still beating earnings
expectations. Where companies have come short is beating revenue
expectations.”  Equities fell for the week as China’s gross domestic
product expanded 7.7 in the first quarter from a year earlier,
down from 7.9 percent growth in the fourth quarter. In the U.S.,
economic reports showed a mixed picture, with new-home
construction rising to the highest level in almost five years
while factory production and an index of U.S. leading indicators
unexpectedly dropped.  Since Alcoa  The  S&P 500 (SPX)  has lost 0.5 percent since April 8, when Alcoa
Inc. became the first company in the Dow to announce earnings.
Of the 103 that have reported so far, 72 percent have  exceeded 
analysts’ predictions on profits while 51 percent trailed on
sales, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Exxon Mobil Corp. and 3M Co. are among 170 companies
scheduled to announce results next week. Profits at S&P 500
companies fell 1.1 percent in the first three months of the
year, according to forecasts compiled by Bloomberg. That would
mark the first year-over-year decrease since 2009.  The  bull market  in U.S. equities entered its fifth year
last month as the S&P 500 more than doubled from a 12-year low
in 2009, driven by better-than-estimated earnings and three
rounds of monetary stimulus from the  Federal Reserve .  Bearish Sentiment  Individual investors, who pulled more than $300 billion out
of U.S. equity mutual funds in the last four years, aren’t
convinced the rally will continue. About 54.5 percent of
respondents expected the market to fall over the next six
months, the highest level of  bearishness  since July 2010,
according to a weekly survey from the  American Association  of
Individual Investors released on April 11. The measure was at
48.2 percent in the April 18 survey.  “A  bull market  requires people to be negative and turn
positive, and we certainly still have lots of those around,”
 John Manley , chief equity strategist for Wells Fargo Funds
Management, which advises $222.7 billion in assets in the Wells
Fargo Advantage Funds, said in a phone interview. “The fact
that people are still so concerned about the economy is
encouraging from an equity market perspective because it allows
people to change their minds and move into stocks.”  Volatility Rises  The Chicago Board Options Exchange  Volatility Index (VIX) , or
VIX, surged 24 percent to 14.97 for the biggest weekly increase
since December. The VIX, which moves in the opposite direction
to the S&P 500 about 80 percent of the time, reached a six-year
low in March and is still down 17 percent this year.  The KBW  Bank Index (BKX)  slipped 2.4 percent as 21 out of its 24
members declined. Bank of America tumbled 4.2 percent to $11.66
after shortfalls in mortgage banking and trading marred first-
quarter results and slowed the company’s turnaround.  Morgan Stanley (MS)  fell 5.7 percent to $20.58. The firm said
bond-trading revenue slumped 42 percent in the first quarter and
stock-trading revenue declined 19 percent. The combined drop was
the most among the largest U.S. banks.  Technology companies helped drag the Nasdaq Composite Index
down 2.7 percent, the most since October. IBM plunged 10 percent
to $190, for the largest decline since 2008. The largest
computer-services provider missed analysts’ earnings estimates
for the first time since 2005 as the company struggles to boost
hardware sales.  Apple Supplier  Apple (AAPL)  dropped 9.1 percent to $390.53, the lowest level
since December 2011. The company’s audio-chip supplier, Cirrus
Logic Inc., reported an inventory glut that suggests iPhone
sales may fall short of analysts’ estimates. Cirrus Logic
tumbled 17 percent to $17.77.  EBay Inc. slipped 8.6 percent, the biggest drop since
August 2011, to $52.39. The operator of the largest Internet
marketplace posted first-quarter revenue that missed some
analysts’ estimates and forecast disappointing sales and profit
for the current period as weakness in  Europe  weighs on growth at
its PayPal unit.  Energy and mining stocks tumbled as the S&P GSCI gauge of
 24 commodities  reached the lowest level since July 2012 during
the week while gold plunged 13 percent in two sessions through
April 15, the biggest slump since 1980.  Freeport-McMoRan declined 12 percent to $28.24 even as the
copper producer reported profit that exceeded analysts’
estimates. Nabors, the world’s largest land-rig contractor,
retreated 7.8 percent to $14.83. Newmont Mining Corp., the
biggest U.S. gold miner, lost 9.3 percent to $32.98.  GE, Microsoft  General Electric Co. sank 7.3 percent, the most since
August 2011, to $21.75 after a first-quarter slide in its Power
& Water business pulled total industrial earnings down 11
percent.  Textron Inc. tumbled 12 percent to $26.35 after cutting its
2013 profit forecast as demand for Cessna jets declined.  Microsoft (MSFT)  climbed 3.4 percent to $29.77. The world’s
largest software maker reported third-quarter profit that
exceeded analysts’ estimates, buoyed by cost controls and sales
of business and server software amid weak demand for personal
computers running the new Windows 8 operating system.  Chipotle rallied 7.1 percent to $366.25. The fast-casual
dining chain’s first-quarter sales topped analysts’ estimates,
helped by an acceleration of store openings.  Coca-Cola Co. jumped 3.9 percent to $42.66, the highest
level since 1998, after reporting first-quarter profit that
topped analysts’ estimates as Latin American sales volume rose.
The company also announced a deal to sell some bottling
distribution rights in  North America .  Sprint Nextel Corp. surged 15 percent, the most in the S&P
500, to $7.17.  Dish Network Corp. (DISH)  offered to buy the third-
largest U.S. wireless carrier for $25.5 billion, challenging a

DNA.  To contact the reporter on this story:
