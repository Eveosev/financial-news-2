Pakistan , having contracted to
import 21 million cubic meters of  natural gas  a day from  Iran 
starting in 2014, may more than double the amount, according to
the Iranian Oil Ministry’s news website.  Pakistan has requested an increase in shipments to 30
million cubic meters a day and is willing to boost them to 50
million cubic meters in a second phase because of its mounting
needs,  Shana  reported, citing the head of the National Iranian
Gas Export Co., Hossein Bidarmaghz. Iran, he said, is
“considering the request.”  The Iranian section of a pipeline to transport the gas is
80 percent complete, Bidarmaghz said, according to the report
published yesterday. Pakistan will seek bidders this month to
build the gas link inside its territory, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
