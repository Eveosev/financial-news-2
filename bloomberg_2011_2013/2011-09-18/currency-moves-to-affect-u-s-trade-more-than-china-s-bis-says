U.S. trade will be affected more
than  China ’s by fluctuations in real exchange rates as the
world’s largest economy has a higher amount of intra-industry
transactions, the  Bank for International Settlements  said.  “The sensitivity of the  trade balance  to movements in real
exchange rates should be much lower in a country with a low
level of intra-industry trade than in a country with high intra-
industry trade,” the Basel, Switzerland-based BIS said in its
 Quarterly Review . “Its imports are unlikely to fall
significantly following a real exchange-rate depreciation
because no domestic industry can easily replace the imports that
have become more expensive.”  Low intra-industry trade countries are typically those
where raw materials or natural resources like oil account for a
major share of imports or those that have specialized in
particular industries in order to benefit from an inherent
comparative advantage, the BIS said. Real exchange rates refer
to the purchasing power of currencies relative to each other.  The U.S. could expect a larger reduction in its trade
deficit from a depreciation in its  exchange rate  than China
would experience from an appreciation, the BIS said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
