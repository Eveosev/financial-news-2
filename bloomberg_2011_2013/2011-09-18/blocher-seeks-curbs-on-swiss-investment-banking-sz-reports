Christoph Blocher, vice president
of the Swiss Peopleâ€™s Party, said the country should consider
prohibiting commercial banks from investment banking after  UBS
AG (UBSN)  announced a $2 billion loss from unauthorized trading,
 SonntagsZeitung  reported.  Christian Levrat, head of the  Social Democratic Party , has
shown readiness to work on such regulation after calling for a
ban last week, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
