Britain and Ireland saw off a last-
day rally by continental  Europe  to clinch a sixth straight win
in golf’s Seve Trophy, the competition named after Severiano Ballesteros who died in May.  Britain and Ireland went into today’s play at Saint-Nom-La-
Breteche near Versailles, France, with a lead of 11 1/2 to 6
1/2, needing three more points for victory.  Europe came back to level at 11 1/2 each after singles wins
for  Thomas Bjorn , Anders Hansen, Francesco Molinari, Alexander
Noren and Miguel Angel Jimenez.  Scott Jamieson,  Ian Poulter  and Mark Foster then hit back
with victories for Britain and Ireland for a 15 1/2 - 12 1/2
win. Two of today’s singles matches were halved.  The event was made up of fourballs, greensomes -- both
partners driving at each hole, then choosing one ball --
foursomes and singles.  The two-yearly event was founded by five-time major-winner
Ballesteros, who died May 7 at his home in Pedrena,  Spain , at
the age of 54.  Since 2009 the competition has been sponsored by Vivendi
SA, owner of the world’s largest video-game and music companies.  To contact the reporter on this story:
