Egypt ’s first parliamentary
elections since the ouster of former President  Hosni Mubarak  may
start on Nov. 21, the state-run  Al Ahram  newspaper reported,
citing Abdel Moez Ibrahim, the head of the elections commission.
This is a “proposed” date, it said.  Under the proposal, the three-phase vote for the lower
house of parliament would end on Jan. 3, the Cairo-based
newspaper said. Elections for the upper house would begin on
Jan. 22 and finish on March 4, it said. The ruling military
council is expected to address voters about the elections in the
last week of September, according to the newspaper.  To contact the reporter on this story:
