Kuwait’s government revenue in the
first two months of the fiscal year reached about 35 percent of
the forecasted annual total,  Al-Shall Economic Consultants 
reported, citing Finance Ministry data.  Income was 4.76 billion dinars ($17.3 billion) at the end
of May, with oil revenue accounting for 4.45 billion dinars,
Kuwait-based Al-Shall said in its weekly report. Annual revenue
is projected at 13.45 billion dinars.  This year’s budget is based on an oil price of $60 a
barrel, up from $43 in the last fiscal year. Oil is currently
trading at about $89 a barrel. Expenditures for the year are
forecast at 19.44 billion dinars.  Kuwait, the fifth-biggest producer in the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries, posted a budget surplus of 5.3
billion dinars in the 2010/2011 fiscal year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
