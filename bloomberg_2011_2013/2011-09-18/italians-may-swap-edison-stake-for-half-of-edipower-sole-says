Edison SpA (EDN) ’s Italian investors may
give their stake to Electricite de France SA in exchange for 50
percent of the Milan-based utility’s Edipower unit,  Il Sole 24
Ore   reported , without saying where it got the information.  Another option is for one of the investors,  A2A SpA (A2A) , to pay
cash for a stake in Edipower, according to the newspaper with
headquarters in Milan.  Edison’s biggest shareholder is Transalpina di Energia, a
company half-owned by Paris-based EDF and half by Delmi SpA,
which in turn is owned by A2A and other Italian companies.  To contact the reporter on this story: Tommaso Ebhardt in Milan
