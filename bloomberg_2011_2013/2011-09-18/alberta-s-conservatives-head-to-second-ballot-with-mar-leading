Former Alberta cabinet minister
Gary Mar is leading to be the western Canadian province’s next
premier after the first round of voting by the Progressive
Conservative party.  None of the six candidates gained the majority required in
yesterday’s poll to replace Ed Stelmach as party leader and
Alberta premier, prompting a second ballot Oct. 1.  Mar got 41 percent of the votes, followed by Alison
Redford, with 19 percent, and Doug Horner, with 15 percent,
according to results on the Progressive Conservative Association
of Alberta’s  website . They advance to a second-round vote while
candidates Ted Morton, Rick Orman and Doug Griffiths are
eliminated from contention.  Stelmach said in January that he is leaving politics.  To contact the reporter on this story:
