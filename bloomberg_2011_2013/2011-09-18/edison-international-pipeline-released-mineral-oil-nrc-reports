Edison International (EIX)  released an
unknown amount of mineral oil from a pipeline to a storm drain
that leads to the  Pacific Ocean , according to a filing with the
National Response Center.  The release was caused by a leak in the line, according to
the Sept. 16  filing , which cited a report from an unidentified
caller. The oil was released on the date of the filing from a
four-inch (10-centimeter) underground pipeline in Westminster,
 California , at 2:30 p.m. local time, according to the report.  “Cleanups have been completed and the release has been
stopped,” according to the filing.  U.S. companies must notify the NRC if they release
hazardous substances in excess of reportable quantities,
according to the Comprehensive Environmental Response,
Compensation and Liability Act, commonly known as Superfund.  Bloomberg News couldn’t immediately verify that the
information in the NRC filing was accurate.  To contact the reporter on this story:
