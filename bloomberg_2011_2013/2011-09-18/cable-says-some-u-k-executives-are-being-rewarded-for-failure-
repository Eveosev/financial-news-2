U.K. Business Secretary Vince Cable
said there is “something not right” with executive pay in the
country.  “What’s happened in the past decade is that executive pay
has risen massively,” while returns to shareholders have stayed
still, Cable told Sky News television today at his Liberal
Democrat party’s conference in Birmingham, central  England . He
said some people are being “rewarded for failure.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
