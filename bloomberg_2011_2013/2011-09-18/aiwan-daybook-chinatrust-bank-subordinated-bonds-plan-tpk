 Chinatrust Commercial Bank plans
to issue NT$12.9 billion of unsecured subordinated bonds in two
tranches on Sept. 27 to redeem 2006-2 financial debentures
before their maturity.  Balda AG, a German maker of plastic components, said it
isnâ€™t selling a $215 million stake in TPK Holding Co. after
investment banks distributed term sheets seeking orders for the
stock.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
