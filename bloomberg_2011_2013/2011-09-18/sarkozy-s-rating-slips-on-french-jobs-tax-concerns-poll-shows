French President  Nicolas Sarkozy ’s
approval rating has slipped 1 percentage point as voters fear
rising unemployment, tax increases and spending cuts, Le Journal
du Dimanche  said , citing an Ifop poll.  The percentage of French voters who have confidence in
Sarkozy fell to 32 percent, from 33 percent in August, the poll
showed. Prime Minister  Francois Fillon ’s approval rating dropped
to 47 percent, compared with 51 percent last month, according to
the newspaper.  Ifop surveyed 1,855 adults by telephone between Sept. 9 and
Sept. 16. No margin of error was given.  To contact the reporter on this story:
