French Finance Minister  Francois Baroin  said the euro-area rescue fund will be “operational” by
mid-October as parliaments from the 17 countries sharing the
euro as a currency are approving a July 21 Greek aid package.  “The tool is good, simply it’s not yet implemented,”
Baroin said in an interview with Europe 1 radio today. “All the
parliaments have set a date and this means that this fund will
be operational by the end of the first half of October, because
the eurozone parliaments will have approved the July 21
accord.”  European finance chiefs yesterday ended two days of talks
in Wroclaw, Poland. U.S. Treasury Secretary  Timothy Geithner ,
attending a meeting of EU finance ministers for the first time,
floated a variation of a 2008 policy he developed while at the
New York Federal reserve that would expand the reach of the 440
billion-euro ($607 billion) European Financial Stability
Facility using leverage in a partnership with the  European
Central Bank , said Irish Finance Minister  Michael Noonan .  Geithner “didn’t bring up an amount, he hasn’t said that
this fund is too small,” Baroin said. “He said: ‘Don’t believe
that with a glass of water you can put out an ember when it is
still incandescent. Probably a bucket of water is needed,’”
Baroin said, recalling Geithner’s comments at the meeting.  Separately, Baroin repeated  France ’s economic growth and
deficit targets, and said the country would meet its commitment
to reduce the deficit to 5.7 percent of output this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
