Sudan ’s gold production revenue
will increase to $3 billion this year from about $70 million in
2010, Al-Tayar reported, citing vice-President Mostafa Osman
Esmail.  Sudan has recently found “large amounts” of gold in the
north of the country and is trying to attract investors into the
 mining industry , Esmail is quoted as saying by the newspaper.  Sudan produced 36.8 metric tons of gold in the year through
May as it expands mining to compensate for revenue lost when
oil-rich South Sudan seceded on July 9, Mining Minister Abdel
Baqi al-Jailani said July 20.  The country, which now produces about 115,000 barrels of
oil a day, lost control of about 375,000 barrels of daily
production to South Sudan when it was declared independent this
month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
