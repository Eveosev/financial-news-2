Ezz Steel (ESRS) , the biggest publicly
traded steel company in  Egypt , said it plans to complete
construction of its Direct Reduced Iron plant at Ezz Rolling
Mills following a court ruling that annulled the company’s
operating license.  The plant will produce steel from  iron ore  instead of scrap
metal, Cairo-based Ezz Steel said in an e-mailed statement
today. Ezz will review all projects under construction to
determine if some need to be suspended “given the prevailing
economic conditions at the time,” it said.  The court annulled licenses on Sept. 15 granted to Egyptian
steel producers in 2008. These included two expansion licenses
issued to Ezz Steel’s subsidiaries, Ezz Rolling Millas and Ezz
Flat Steel, the statement said.  Ezz Steel former Chairman Ahmed Ezz said he will appeal the
ruling, according to the company. Shares of Ezz Steel remained
suspended on the Egyptian Exchange.  To contact the reporter on this story:
