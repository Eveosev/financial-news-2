A majority of Germans view measures
taken to prevent Greek insolvency as unlikely to succeed,  Focus 
magazine reported, citing an Emnid poll.  Forty percent of the 1,008 respondents polled on Sept. 14
and 15 said rescue measures would succeed, the magazine reported
today in an e-mailed preview of the article. Fifty-six percent
expect  Greece  to become insolvent.  Members of German Chancellor  Angela Merkel â€™s Free
Democratic Party coalition partner were the most pessimistic,
with 69 percent expecting the Greek rescue to fail, Focus said
citing the poll.  To contact the reporter on this story:
