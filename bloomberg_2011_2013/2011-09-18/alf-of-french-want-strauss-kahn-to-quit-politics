A majority of French people want
 Dominique Strauss-Kahn  to announce his retirement from politics
when he speaks in a television interview later today, an Ifop
poll for  Le Journal du Dimanche  showed.  Fifty-three percent of those polled want Strauss-Kahn to
say he will leave politics, the poll said, according to the
newspaper. Sixty-four percent of those asked want Strauss-Kahn
to give his views and solutions to the economic crisis.  Strauss-Kahn, the former head of the  International Monetary
Fund  and a one-time potential Socialist Party contender for the
French presidency, returned to  France  on Sept. 4 after New York
prosecutors decided not to pursue a criminal case over
allegations he assaulted a cleaning woman at a Manhattan hotel.
He is due to be interviewed on TF1 television today.  Ifop surveyed 956 people aged 18 or more between Sept. 9
and Sept. 16 through phone interviews. No margin of error was
given.  To contact the reporter on this story:
