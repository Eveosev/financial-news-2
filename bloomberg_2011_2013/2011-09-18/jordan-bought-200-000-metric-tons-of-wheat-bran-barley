Jordan bought 100,000 metric tons
of wheat bran and an equal amount of barley from various
origins, the Ministry of Industry and Trade said.  No offers were made for a third tender, which closed on
Sept. 12, to buy 5,000 to 20,000 tons of wheat bran in sacks,
Mohamad Malahmeh, head of the ministry’s tenders department,
said in a telephone interview. “A committee is now studying the
alternatives on this tender because it was the second time it
was issued,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
