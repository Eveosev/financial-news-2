Qatar shares rose the most in two
weeks after European officials took steps to ease the region’s
debt crisis and as two bankers said company weightings on the
Persian Gulf country’s benchmark may be capped at 15 percent.  Industries Qatar QSC (IQCD) , the  Middle East ’s second-biggest
petrochemicals company, jumped 2.8 percent.  Masraf Al Rayan (MARK) ,
Qatar’s second-largest Shariah-compliant lender, soared to the
highest in almost four years. Qatar’s  QE Index (DSM)  rallied 1
percent, the most since Sept. 4, to 8,431.54 at the 1 p.m. close
in Doha. In North Africa,  Egypt ’s EGX 30 Index slumped to the
lowest level since April 2009.  Global stocks rose after European Central Bank President
 Jean-Claude Trichet  pressed euro-area governments on Sept. 16 to
take decisive action to halt the debt crisis. The STOXX Europe
600 Index rallied 2.5 percent, and in the U.S., the Standard &
Poor’s 500 Index surged 5.4 percent, posting the third-biggest
weekly gain since 2009.  “Stock prices are mainly positive today after a rebound in
global equities markets,” said Nabil Farhat, a partner at Abu
Dhabi-based Al Fajer Securities. “When you drop the weighting
of one stock, that will automatically increase weightings in
others; if other stocks have higher weightings and these stocks
have higher beta, the index will be price sensitive to them.”  Cutting Weighting  Qatar National Bank SAQ (QNBK) , the heaviest-weighted company on
Qatar’s index, may have its share of the gauge cut from 22
percent to 15 percent, two bankers familiar with the discussions
said Sept. 15. Weightings of all companies on the QE Index may
be capped at 15 percent and the decision could take effect in
October, said one of the bankers. Qatar National Bank is the
only stock with a weighting of more than 15 percent, according
to data on Bloomberg.  The Persian Gulf country’s biggest bank by assets increased
0.3 percent, the most since Sept. 13, to 141.9 riyals.
Industries Qatar rallied the most since June 9 to 126 riyals.
Masraf al Rayan gained 1.4 percent to 24.6 riyals, the highest
since November 2007.  Crude for October delivery on the New York Mercantile rose
0.8 percent to $87.96 a barrel last week. Gulf Arab oil
exporters, including the  United Arab Emirates  and  Saudi Arabia ,
supply about a fifth of the world’s oil.  Egypt’s benchmark  EGX 30 Index (EGX30)  retreated 0.9 percent to
4,325.70.  Ezz Steel (ESRS)  tumbled 10 percent, the daily limit, to 7.03
Egyptian pounds, the lowest level since March 2009. The biggest
independent steelmaker in the Middle East said a court ruling,
which included the annulment of two expansion licenses issued to
subsidiaries of the company, would affect growth.  Ezz Steel  “The court decision against Ezz Steel, although highly
welcomed by protesters, is weighing on sentiment, as investors
fear similar measures could be taken against other listed
companies,” said Wafik Dawood, director of institutional sales
at Cairo-based Mega Investments Securities.  The  DFM General Index (DFMGI)  and Oman’s gauge added 0.3 percent.
Kuwait’s measure decreased 0.4 percent and  Abu Dhabi ’s  ADX
General Index (ADSMI)  slipped 0.2 percent, retreating for an eighth day.
Bahrain’s BB All Share Index fell 0.1 percent and Saudi Arabia’s
 Tadawul All Share Index (SASEIDX)  declined 0.5 percent.  Israel ’s TA-25 Index gained 0.7 percent and the yield on
the Mimshal Shiklit bond due January 2020 advanced for a second
day, increasing one basis point to 4.59 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
