The union representing  Air Canada (AC/A) 
flight attendants is presenting its answer to the latest labor
accord offer from the Montreal-based airline, the Canadian Union
of Public Employees said.  Talks between Air Canada, the country’s largest airline,
and the flight attendants continued over the weekend before two
mediators from the Ministry of Labor, the union said in an e-
mailed statement.  The flight attendants will be in a legal strike position at
12:01 a.m. Sept. 21, unless a deal is reached before then, the
union said. The flight attendants have been without a contract
since March 31.  A telephone message left with Air Canada spokesman Peter
Fitzpatrick outside business hours wasn’t immediately returned.  To contact the reporter on this story:
