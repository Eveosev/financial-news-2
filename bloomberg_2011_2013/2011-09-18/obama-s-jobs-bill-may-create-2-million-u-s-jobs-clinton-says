President  Barack Obama ’s $447
billion  proposal  to boost U.S. employment is capable of creating
as many as 2 million jobs, former President  Bill Clinton  said.  The bill “could put about 2 percent more on the GDP growth
of the coming year, and could drop unemployment by somewhere
between 1 to 2 million” jobs, Clinton said in an interview with
ABC’s “This Week with  Christiane Amanpour .”  Clinton said it wasn’t clear if Congress would approve most
or all of the measure, which includes infrastructure spending,
incentives to hire the long-term unemployed and a payroll-tax
cut. Republican lawmakers have said the package of tax and
spending measures proposed Sept. 8 relies too heavily on ideas
that were already used in a 2009 economic stimulus such as
spending on infrastructure and modernizing schools.  “We live in a time where there’s this huge disconnect
between the way the political system works and the way the
economic system works,” Clinton said.  Clinton said policy makers in  Washington  also need to help
Americans harmed by the collapse in home values following the
economic crisis of 2008.  “If we can’t fix the housing crisis now, which is probably
not politically possible, but should be done, we can’t return to
full employment,” Clinton said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
