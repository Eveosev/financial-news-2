An unknown amount of butadiene and
propylene were released into the air yesterday at the Norco
plant in  Louisiana  run by Motiva Enterprises LLC, according to a
 filing  to the National Response Center.  A clamp on a pipe at a chemical facility released the
materials at 10:30 a.m. local time, according to the filing
dated yesterday, which cited a report from an unidentified
caller.  U.S. companies must notify the NRC if they release
hazardous substances in excess of reportable quantities,
according to the Comprehensive Environmental Response,
Compensation and Liability Act, commonly known as Superfund.
Motiva is a joint venture of  Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA)  and Saudi
Arabian Oil Co.  Bloomberg News couldnâ€™t immediately verify that the
information in the NRC filing was accurate.  To contact the reporter on this story:
