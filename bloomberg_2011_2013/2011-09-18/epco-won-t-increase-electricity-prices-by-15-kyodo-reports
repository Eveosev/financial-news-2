Tokyo Electric Power Co. won’t go
ahead with plans to boost electricity prices by as much as 15
percent after government and public criticism,  Kyodo News 
reported, citing unidentified people familiar with the matter.  The utility known as Tepco already informed creditors about
the reversal of its plans, Kyodo said, citing the unidentified
people. Tepco may propose a smaller price increase to cover
expected higher costs, Kyodo said.  The company had planned to boost prices to help cover costs
associated with reactor meltdowns at its Fukushima Dai-Ichi
nuclear plant, Kyodo said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
