The U.K.’s structural deficit in
2011-2012 may be 12 billion pounds ($18.9 billion) higher than
previously estimated, an increase of 25 percent, the Financial
Times reported, citing its own replication of the methodology
used by the  Office for Budget Responsibility .  The level of spare capacity in the economy is lower than
expected, which means the OBR, which oversees forecasting for
the U.K. Treasury, won’t be able to forecast as much “catch-up
growth” as it did in March, the FT said.  Getting the U.K.’s public finances back on schedule would
require the equivalent of raising  sales tax  to 22.5 percent from
20 percent, the FT reported.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
