Ezz Steel (ESRS) , the biggest independent
steelmaker in the  Middle East  and North Africa, fell 10 percent
after the company said a court ruling annulling licenses granted
in 2008 would directly impact growth.  The shares fell the most since March to 7.03 Egyptian
pounds at 12:45 p.m. in Cairo, before being suspended for
declining by the daily limit of 10 percent.  Ezz Steel plans to complete its direct-reduced iron plant
at Ezz Rolling Mills, the Cairo-based company said in an e-
mailed statement today. The plant, which is under construction,
would produce steel from  iron ore  instead of scrap metal. The
company will review all projects under construction to determine
if some need to be suspended "given the prevailing economic
conditions at the time,’’ it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
