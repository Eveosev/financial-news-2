Egyptâ€™s benchmark  EGX 30 Index (EGX30) 
dropped for a sixth day, retreating 0.9 percent to 4,325.70 at
the 2:30 p.m. close in Cairo.  The following shares rose or fell. Symbols are in
parentheses.  Commercial International Bank Egypt SAE (COMI)   increased
for the first time in eight days, advancing 1.5 percent to 24.8
Egyptian pounds. The biggest publicly traded bank in Egypt said
it had no outstanding loans to steel companies in the country
after a court ruling annulled licenses granted in 2008.  Ezz Steel (ESRS)   tumbled 10 percent, the daily limit, to
7.03 pounds, the lowest level since March 2009. The biggest
independent steelmaker in the Middle East said the court ruling,
which included the annulment of two expansion licenses issued to
subsidiaries of the company,  would affect growth directly.  To contact the reporter on this story:
