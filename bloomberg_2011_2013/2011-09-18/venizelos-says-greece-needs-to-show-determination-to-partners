Greek Finance Minister Evangelos
Venizelos said the volatile international market environment
demanded  Greece  as a nation show the determination to proceed
with changes agreed with its international partners to secure
financing.  Venizelos said measures announced on Sept. 6 would be
presented to officials from the European Union,  International
Monetary Fund  and European Central Bank in a conference call
tomorrow, along with a property tax announced on Sept. 11, in a
bid to ensure targets for 2011 and 2012 are met, structural
reforms are pursued and a primary surplus is created as soon as
possible. He said some measures agreed with partners may need to
be brought forward to achieve those goals. He spoke in Athens in
comments televised live on state-run NET TV.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
