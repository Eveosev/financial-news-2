Hong Kong streets with lines of
idling vehicles are 10 times more polluted than busy roads with
slow-moving traffic, the  South China Morning Post  reported,
citing its own research.  Streets with parked and idling vehicles could also be
warmer by as much as 5 degrees Celcius than those with flowing
traffic, the report said, citing a survey of seven roads in
 Causeway Bay  and  Mong Kok  on Aug. 13. The newspaper said it used
a handheld device to measure carbon dioxide levels.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
