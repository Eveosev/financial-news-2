Corn and soybeans may fall this
week on speculation that U.S. crop yields will increase, while
commodity demand ebbs because of a sputtering global economy.  Sixteen of 31 traders and analysts surveyed from  Tokyo  to
 Chicago  on Sept. 16 forecast that corn will fall for a fourth
straight week, and 17 respondents said soybeans will drop after
last week’s biggest decline in six months.  On the Chicago Board of Trade last week, corn futures for
December delivery tumbled 6 percent to $6.92 a bushel, and
soybean futures for November delivery slumped 5 percent to
$13.555 a bushel.  Last week’s declines were a surprise to the majority of
analysts and traders surveyed on Sept. 9.  Bearish on corn: 16    Bearish on soybeans: 17
