Sinn Fein , which has nominated
Martin McGuinness as its candidate in the Republic of Ireland’s
presidential election, has secured enough votes from independent
lawmakers to launch the bid, the Sunday Times reported.  Four independent lawmakers in Ireland’s parliament have
nominated McGuinness,  Northern Ireland ’s deputy First Minister,
and with the 17 votes Sinn Fein holds it brings Sinn Fein above
the required level of 20 votes to put McGuinness forward, the
Sunday Times reported, without saying where it got the
information.  To contact the reporter on this story:
