Cierre Wood rushed for two
touchdowns and Tommy Rees threw for another to give unranked
 Notre Dame  its first win of the season with a 31-13 victory over
No. 15 Michigan State in  South Bend ,  Indiana .  Michigan State surprised  Notre Dame  last season by faking a
field goal on fourth down and throwing a touchdown pass to win
the game in overtime.  Trailing 21-10 late in the first half, Michigan State drove
to the Notre Dame two-yard line, lined up for a field goal and
tried it again. This time though, Notre Dame’s Ethan Johnson
sniffed it out, breaking up a shovel pass attempt and protecting
the Irish lead.  “We had some time to talk about it and just remind our
guys to be gap conscious and do their jobs,” Notre Dame coach
Brian Kelly said of the fake field goal. “We just did our job
on that and obviously came up with a big play.”  Michigan State quarterback Kirk Cousins, who had 11
consecutive completions at one point in the second half,
finished the game 34 of 53 for 329 yards. With about four
minutes remaining in the game, he was intercepted at the Notre
Dame 6-yard line. Robert Blanton returned the interception 82
yards to the 12-yard line, ending the Michigan State rally and
effectively closing out the game.  In other college football upsets, Miami beat No. 17 Ohio
State University 24-6, Clemson beat No. 21 Auburn 38-24 and
Illinois defeated No. 22 Arizona State 17-14.  In Miami, Lamar Miller rushed for 184 yards and the
Hurricanes’ defense held Ohio State quarterbacks Joe Bauserman
and Braxton Miller to 4 of 7 passing for 35 yards.  Losing Streak  The win snapped the Hurricanes’ four-game losing streak and
was its first victory over a ranked opponent since a 21-20 win
over No. 8  Oklahoma  on Oct. 3, 2009.  The loss could drop Ohio State out of the Associated Press
Top-25 rankings for the first time in almost seven years, dating
back to Nov. 28, 2004. The last time the Buckeyes lost a road
game to an unranked nonconference opponent was Sept. 17, 1988,
in a 42-10 loss at Pittsburgh.  Miami quarterback Jacory Harris, coming off a one-game
suspension for accepting impermissible benefits, threw two
touchdown passes to Allen Hurns. He was intercepted twice. Last
season, Harris was intercepted 15 times and the Hurricanes’ 27
interceptions led the nation.  Ohio State drove inside Miami’s 10-yard line twice in the
second quarter, managing only two field goals.  Clemson, Auburn  In Clemson,  South Carolina , the  Clemson University  Tigers
rolled up 624 yards of offense to upset defending national
champion Auburn University 38-24 at Memorial Stadium.  The victory ended No. 21 Auburn’s 17-game win streak and
showed that Clemson, 3-0 for the first time since 2007, is
capable of defending a lead.  Clemson was ahead 38-24 in the fourth quarter when Auburn
drove down to the Clemson 8-yard-line, reminding some of last
year’s game when Auburn overcame a 17-0 deficit to beat Clemson
27-24 in overtime.  This year was different. Just when Clemson needed a big
play to snuff out Auburn’s momentum, Coty Sensabaugh intercepted
Auburn’s Barrett Trotter to end the drive.  Tigers quarterback Tajh Boyd completed 30 of 42 passes for
386 yards and four touchdowns. The 624 total yards was the most
Clemson had ever racked up against a Southeastern Conference
opponent. Clemson had lost 14 straight to Auburn since a 34-0
victory in 1951.  In Champaign,  Illinois , Arizona State quarterback Brock
Osweiler was sacked six times in a 17-14 loss to Illinois.  Illinois Recovery  Down 14-10 with about 10 minutes left in the game, Illinois
defensive end Whitney Mercilus hit Osweiler in the back, jarring
the ball loose and it was recovered by Illinois linebacker Ian
Thomas.  Four plays later, Illinois quarterback Nathan Scheelhaase,
who completed 11 of 15 passes for 135 yards on the day, threw a
16-yard pass to A.J. Jenkins for the winning score.  Arizona State outgained Illinois in total yards, 362-240
and Osweiler went 25 of 45 for 256 yards with one rushing
touchdown and one passing touchdown to no avail.  In Gainesville,  Florida , the No. 16 University of Florida
Gators beat the University of  Tennessee , 33-23.  Florida running back Chris Rainey had 233 total yards,
including an 83-yard touchdown catch. He ended the day with 108
rushing yards and 104 receiving yards and blocked a punt that
led to a field goal.  Rainey became the first Florida player since Percy Harvin
in 2007 to have 100 yards rushing and receiving in the same
game.  To contact the reporter on this story:
