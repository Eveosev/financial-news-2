Dave Gavitt, a member of
basketball’s Naismith Memorial Hall of Fame and the first
commissioner of the  Big East Conference , died Friday after
battling a long illness. He was 73.  Gavitt was a driving force in college basketball the past
three decades. He led Providence College to the semifinals of
the  National Collegiate Athletic Association ’s championship
tournament in 1973, was chairman of the NCAA’s Division I men’s
basketball committee from 1982 through 1984 when the tournament
expanded to 64 teams, and was the Big East Conference
commissioner from its founding in 1979 until 1990.  Picked to coach the U.S. Olympic team in 1980,  Gavitt  lost
the opportunity when the U.S. boycotted the Moscow Games. He
still had an impact on the Olympic team when he served as
president of USA Basketball and helped to bring National
Basketball Association players into the Olympics, including the
so-called Dream Team U.S. roster for the 1992 Olympics.  Big East spokesman John Paquette confirmed Gavitt’s death,
without providing details. The Providence Journal reported that
Gavitt, who had a 209-84 record over 10 coaching seasons and led
Providence to the NCAA tournament five times, died in a hospital
surrounded by his family.  To contact the reporter on this story:
