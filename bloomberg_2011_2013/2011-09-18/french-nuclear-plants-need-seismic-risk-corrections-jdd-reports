France ’s nuclear safety authority,
which is auditing reactors for risks linked to earthquakes,
flooding and power blackouts, has sent follow-up letters to
eight nuclear plants asking for more than 200 “corrective
actions,” Le Journal du Dimanche reported.  Autorite de Surete Nucleaire has sent the follow-up letters
to the plants of Golfech, Civaux, Cattenom, Flamanville, Penly,
Gravelines, Saint-Alban and Le Blayais, the JDD said.  Electricite de France SA, which operates France’s nuclear
reactors, is working to meet the regulator’s demands, the JDD
reported, citing Jean-Marc Miraucourt, head of nuclear
engineering at the company. France has 19 nuclear plants, JDD
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
