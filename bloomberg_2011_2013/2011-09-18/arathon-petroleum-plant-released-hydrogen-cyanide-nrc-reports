Marathon Petroleum Corp. released
hydrogen cyanide into the air Sept. 16 at its Robinson refinery
in  Illinois , according to a filing to the National Response
Center.  The release of 49.68 pounds a day was discovered based on
results from testing a fluidized catalytic cracking unit,
according to a Sept. 16  filing , which cited a “continuous
release” report from an unidentified caller. The release
happened at 10:20 a.m. local time, according to the filing.  U.S. companies must notify the NRC if they release
hazardous substances in excess of reportable quantities,
according to the Comprehensive Environmental Response,
Compensation and Liability Act, commonly known as Superfund.
Hydrogen cyanide is a poisonous substance used to create other
chemicals, including dyes and plastics.  Bloomberg News couldn’t immediately verify that the
information in the NRC filing was accurate.  To contact the reporter on this story:
