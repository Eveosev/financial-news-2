South Carolina Republican  Senator
Lindsey Graham  said that a proposal by President Barack Obama to
impose a new levy on those earning more than $1 million a year
is a “political move” and is “class warfare.”  Graham said on CNN’s “State of the Union” today that he
supports parts of Obama’s jobs bill, including a plan to cut the
 payroll tax  and some of the proposed infrastructure spending.  To contact the reporter on this story:
