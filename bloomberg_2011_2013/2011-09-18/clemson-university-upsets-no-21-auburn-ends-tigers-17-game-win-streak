Clemson University  rolled up 624
yards of offense to upset defending national champion Auburn
University 38-24 at Memorial Stadium in Clemson,  South Carolina .  The victory ended No. 21 Auburn’s 17-game win streak and
showed that Clemson, 3-0 for the first time since 2007, is
capable of defending a lead.  Clemson was ahead 38-24 in the fourth quarter when Auburn
drove down to the Clemson 8-yard-line, reminding some of last
year’s game when Auburn overcame a 17-0 deficit to beat Clemson
27-24 in overtime.  This year was different. Just when Clemson needed a big
play to snuff out Auburn’s momentum, Coty Sensabaugh intercepted
Auburn’s Barrett Trotter to end the drive.  Tigers quarterback Tajh Boyd completed 30 of 42 passes for
386 yards and four touchdowns. The 624 total yards was the most
Clemson had ever racked up against a Southeastern Conference
opponent. Clemson had lost 14 straight to Auburn since a 34-0
victory in 1951.  In  South Bend ,  Indiana , Cierre Wood rushed for two
touchdowns and Tommy Rees threw for another to give  Notre Dame 
its first win this season with an upset of No. 15 Michigan
State, 31-13.  The game had its share of trickery. Michigan State
surprised Notre Dame in overtime last season by faking a field
goal and throwing a touchdown pass to win the game.  Trailing 21-10 late in the first half, Michigan State drove
to the Notre Dame two-yard line and tried it again. This time,
the Irish were ready, breaking up a shovel pass on fourth-and-
goal to protect their lead.  Michigan State quarterback Kirk Cousins completed 34 of 53
passes for 329 yards. He was intercepted at the  Notre Dame  6
with just less than four minutes remaining in the game. Robert
Blanton returned the interception 82 yards to the 12 ending the
Michigan State rally.  The Spartans rushed for 29 yards on 23 carries and
committed 12 penalties for 86 yards.  To contact the reporter on this story:
