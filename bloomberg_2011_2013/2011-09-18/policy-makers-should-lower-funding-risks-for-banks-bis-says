Policy makers should act to
minimize the impact of sovereign credit risk on banks to
safeguard their access to funds, the  Bank for International
Settlements  said.  “The financial crisis and economic recession, and policy
makers’ responses to these events, have raised sovereign credit
risk concerns in a number of advanced economies,” the
Switzerland-based BIS said in a Quarterly Review released today.
“This has increased the cost and reduced the stability of
funding for banks.”  Risk could be reduced by ensuring sound public finances,
increasing transparency and allowing central banks to supply
funding to banks against a broad range of collateral, the report
said. The BIS also endorsed lengthening debt maturities.  Banks can “mitigate, but not eliminate” risk by
maintaining additional capital and diversifying their sovereign-
debt holdings to include more foreign assets, it said.  “Given the challenges for fiscal policy, supervisors and
central banks need to prepare for the likelihood of a sustained
period of higher and more volatile sovereign risk premia,” the
report said.  The ECB, in coordination with the  Federal Reserve  and other
central banks yesterday, said it will lend dollars to euro-area
banks in a series of three-month loans to help them meet demand
for dollars. The supply of loans in dollars has fallen as U.S.
money-market mutual funds cut lending due to the inability of
policy makers to contain the debt crisis.  To contact the reporter on this story:
