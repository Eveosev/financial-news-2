The  Atlanta Falcons  rallied to beat
the Philadelphia Eagles 35-31, spoiling Michael Vick’s return to
his former city and avoiding a 0-2 start to the National
Football League season.  Michael Turner had a 3-yard rushing touchdown with 4:53
left as the Falcons erased a 10-point fourth quarter deficit at
the Georgia Dome. Although Vick had two fumbles and an
interception, he’d given the Eagles the lead before leaving the
game in the third quarter with a concussion.  “It was a wild one for sure, but we hung in there,” said
Falcons quarterback Matt Ryan, who had a career-high four
touchdown passes. “I’m just glad we came away with the win.”  The Eagles failed to become the eighth team to start the
season 2-0, among them the  New England Patriots ,  New York Jets 
and defending Super Bowl champion  Green Bay Packers .  Tom Brady  followed up his 517-yard passing performance from
Week 1 with 423 yards and three touchdowns yesterday as the
Patriots beat the San Diego Chargers 35-21.  The Patriots are now 10-0 in home openers at Gillette
Stadium in Foxboro,  Massachusetts .  The Jets had four interceptions in a 32-3 win over the
Jacksonville Jaguars, while Mark Sanchez threw two touchdown
passes at MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford,  New Jersey . It’s
the Jets’ second 2-0 start in the past three years.  Unbeaten Trio  The AFC East is the only division with three 2-0 teams, as
the  Buffalo Bills  matched the Patriots and Jets by rallying past
the visiting Oakland Raiders 38-35 yesterday on a touchdown pass
with 18 seconds left.  The Packers overcame a 13-0 deficit in a 30-23 win at
Carolina and are tied atop the NFC North with a Detroit Lions
team that was 8-40 over the past three seasons. The Lions are 2-
0 this year after routing the Kansas City Chiefs 48-3 behind
four touchdown passes from Matt Stafford.  The  Washington Redskins  stayed unbeaten by slipping past
the Arizona Cardinals 22-21 on a 34-yard field goal with 1:45
left. The Redskins, coming off consecutive losing seasons, had
trailed 21-13 with just over five minutes remaining.  The Houston Texans are also 2-0 after defeating the Miami
Dolphins 23-13.  The  New Orleans Saints  beat the Chicago Bears 30-13, while
the Pittsburgh Steelers rebounded from a 28-point season-opening
loss at Baltimore with a 24-0 shutout of the  Seattle Seahawks .
The Tampa Bay Buccaneers avoided an 0-2 start by beating the
Minnesota Vikings 24-20 on LeGarrette Blount’s 4-yard touchdown
run with 35 seconds left.  Cowboys’ OT Win  The  Dallas Cowboys  beat the San Francisco 49ers 27-24 in
overtime on a 19-yard field goal set up by  Tony Romo ’s 77-yard
pass to Jesse Holley. The Broncos beat the Cincinnati Bengals
24-22 for John Fox’s first win as Denver’s coach and the
Cleveland Browns defeated Indianapolis 27-19 to drop the Colts
to 0-2 without  Peyton Manning , who’s out indefinitely after neck
surgery.  The New York Giants host the St. Louis Rams tonight to cap
the NFL’s Week 2 schedule.  In Atlanta, Vick overcame his three turnovers to help the
Eagles erase a 21-10 third-quarter lead. Philadelphia had a
24-21 lead and was driving for another touchdown when Vick was
injured. As he was being tackled, Vick’s head struck teammate
Todd Herremans and snapped back. Vick, who was spitting out
blood on the sidelines, was replaced by Mike Kafka.  The Falcons then rallied in the fourth quarter. Ovie Mughelli caught a one-yard touchdown pass and Turner put Atlanta
back in front with a 61-yard run that set up his go-ahead score.
The Eagles’ final drive stalled when Jeremy Maclin, who caught
two touchdown passes, dropped a fourth-down pass at the Atlanta
22-yard line with 1:41 left.  Brady’s Yards  Brady, who had the fifth-most passing yards in NFL history
in the Patriots’ season-opening win at Miami, connected
yesterday on 31 of 40 passes without an interception. He became
the sixth quarterback to throw for more than 400 yards in
consecutive games.  The Jets, who rallied to beat the Cowboys 27-24 in their
season-opener with 17 fourth-quarter points, jumped out to a 9-0
first-quarter lead against the Jaguars.  Sanchez threw a 17-yard scoring pass to  Santonio Holmes  on
the Jets’ first possession, ending the team’s NFL-record run of
16 games without a first-quarter touchdown. On the ensuing
drive, Muhammad Wilkerson, the Jets’ first-round draft pick from
Temple University, sacked Jaguars quarterback Luke McCown in the
end zone for a safety.  Sanchez said that coach  Rex Ryan  had challenged the Jets’
offense, opting to take the ball first on offense instead of
letting his defense take the field as he usually would.  “The opening drive, that was huge,” Sanchez said. “He
put the challenge on us and we answered the call.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
