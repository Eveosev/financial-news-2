Aux Sable Canada LP ’s Heartland
offgas plant experienced intermittent flaring because of startup
and commissioning activities, according to a recorded message
left on a community hotline.  Flaring and elevated noise levels began Sept. 16 and are
expected to last through Sept. 23, according to the message. The
Heartland plant in Fort Saskatchewan,  Alberta , will produce
hydrogen, ethane and propane-plus mix, according to Aux Sable’s
website.  Aux Sable Canada is owned by Veresen Inc. and  Enbridge
Inc. (ENB) , according to its website. The Heartland plant was designed
to process up to 20 million cubic feet a day of offgas, exhaust
emissions supplied by Royal Dutch Shell Plc’s nearby Scotford
refinery.  To contact the reporter on this story:
