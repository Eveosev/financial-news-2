Adam Posen , a member of the  Bank of
England ’s Monetary Policy Committee, said the euro-area debt
crisis represented a bigger threat to the U.K. than to the
U.S., because of its closer economic ties.  “It’s the biggest single threat to the global economy,”
Posen told Sky News television today He said richer European
countries should accept they will take a loss on poorer
countries’ debts.  “They just have to take a decision,” he said. “It
doesn’t really matter if it’s fair or not, because they’re going
to be the ones that are worse off if it goes wrong.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
