Brazil  will tighten rules that
govern oil-industry taxation to reduce imports of machinery and
increase locally made production equipment, O Estado de S. Paulo
reported, citing unidentified technical staff in the government.  The rules, known as Repetro, will be revised by the end of
the year, the newspaper said. The goal is to ensure that locally
made content guidelines are being followed, and to increase
funds for research and development, O Estado said.  -- Editors: Joe Sabo, Sylvia Wier.  To contact the reporter on this story:
