Australia will release updated
modeling on the economic impact of its proposed carbon tax this
week. The new modeling is likely to be similar to an earlier
forecast that the economy would continue to “grow strongly”
under the tax while reducing carbon pollution, Treasurer  Wayne
Swan  said in an e-mailed statement today.  Swan also said he will travel to Washington this week for
meetings with the  International Monetary Fund , World Bank and
G20 finance ministers.  To contact the reporter on this story:
