Lexi Thompson, a high school junior
who turned 16 in February, became the youngest golfer to win an
LPGA tournament, breaking Paula Creamer’s record by more than
two years.  Thompson finished 17 under par at the Navistar LPGA Classic
in Prattville,  Alabama , five shots better than fellow American
Tiffany Joh. Thompson, whose caddie is her father, Scott, closed
with a round of 2-under 70 yesterday to follow up rounds of 66,
68 and 67.  “Being there with my dad, he was like, ‘Lexi, just enjoy
that walk. I am going off to the side because I might cry,’”
Thompson told reporters. “I definitely cried after I finished.
It was the best experience.”  Creamer was the youngest previous winner of an LPGA Tour
multiround event, capturing the 2005 Sybase Classic when she was
18 years and nine months old. Marlene Hagge won the 1952
Sarasota Open, an 18-hole event, 14 days after her 18th
birthday, according to the LPGA Tour.  Tiger Woods  won his first PGA Tour event at age 20.  Thompson, who turned professional in June 2010, receives
$195,000 for the victory though she still doesn’t get automatic
LPGA membership because golf’s top women’s tour has an age
requirement of 18. Thompson previously received a waiver for the
LPGA’s qualifying school for 2012 membership and won the opening
stage in July by 10 strokes.  When she was 12 years old in 2007, Thompson became the
youngest golfer to qualify for the U.S. Women’s Open. She won
the U.S. Junior Girls’ Championship in 2008.  “It’s been my dream my whole life just to play out here,”
Thompson said about the LPGA Tour. “Getting a win right now, I
can’t describe the feelings, but it’s the best feeling ever.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
