Regency Energy Partners LP reported
gas emissions at its Tilden treatment plant in South Texas,
after two units shut due to pressure problems.  The plant emitted about 682 pounds of sulfur dioxide and 7
pounds of carbon monoxide, the company said in a  filing 
yesterday with the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality.
The emissions event took place between 3:50 p.m. and 4:25 p.m.
local time, according to the filing.  Fifth-stage discharge pressure caused the first unit to
shut and low suction pressure shut the second unit. Both units
were reset and returned to service, according to the filing.  The company said in a  separate filing  on Sept. 16 that it
flared gases because its first unit shut due to fifth-stage
discharge pressure. The plant released about 1,064 pounds of
sulfur dioxide from that incident, according to the filing.  To contact the reporter on this story:
