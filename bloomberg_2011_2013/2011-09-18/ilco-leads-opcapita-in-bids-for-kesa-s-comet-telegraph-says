Hilco, a restructuring company, is
ahead of bidding rival OpCapita LLP in its attempts to buy  Kesa
Electricals Plc (KESA) ’s U.K. Comet chain, the Sunday Telegraph
reported, without saying where it got the information.  The terms offered by Hilco are more favorable to Kesa’s
managers than OpCapita’s, the Telegraph reported. The amount of
money offered by Kesa to cover Comet’s 49 million-pound ($77
million) pension deficit remains an issue, the paper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
