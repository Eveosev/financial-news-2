Iraq ’s Cabinet plans to increase
the annual state budget by 36 percent to 131 trillion dinars
($112 billion) in 2012, State Minister Ali Al-Dabbagh said.  The government discussed today the forecast federal budget
which plans revenue of 107.7 trillion dinar and a deficit of
23.3 trillion dinars, Al-Dabbagh said today in an e-mailed
statement. The plan includes expenses of 20 trillion dinar for
security and military, 11 trillion dinar for compensations and
debts, and 15 trillion dinar for social subsidies, he said.  The plan provides for exempting all citizens from repaying
interest on loans taken from state-run Agricultural Cooperation
Bank, the Real Estate Bank and the Housing Fund, he said.
Citizens can also continue to take loans from these institutions
without interest, he said.  Iraqi protesters, inspired by unrest across the Arab world,
have taken to the streets to demonstrate against poor  living
conditions , insecurity, power rationing and corruption. Iraq,
which has the world’s fifth-biggest crude-oil reserves, is also
seeking foreign investment to help boost energy exports.  To contact the reporter on this story:
