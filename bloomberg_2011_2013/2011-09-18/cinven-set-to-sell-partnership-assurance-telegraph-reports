Cinven Ltd., a London-based buyout
firm, is set to sell its Partnership Assurance business after
receiving takeover approaches, the Sunday Telegraph reported,
without saying where it got the information.  Cinven has spoken to  Morgan Stanley (MS) ,  Goldman Sachs Group
Inc. (GS) , Lexicon Partners and  Deutsche Bank AG (DBK)  about managing the
planned 750 million-pound ($1.18 million) sale, the Telegraph
said. A single adviser will be appointed, and the sale may not
occur until 2013, according to the paper.  Edward Bridges, a spokesman for Cinven, declined to comment
when contacted by phone today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
