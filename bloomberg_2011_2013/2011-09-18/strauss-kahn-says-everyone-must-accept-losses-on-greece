Former International Monetary Fund
head Dominique Strauss-Kahn said that forcing  Greece  to pay back
its debts would unacceptably impoverish the country, and that
everyone must be willing to accept losses on Greece’s debts.  “They can’t pay,” Strauss-Kahn said in his first
interview since charges of assaulting a Manhattan hotel maid
were dropped. “The efforts of European leaders have been too
little, or too late, or often both too little and too late.”  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
