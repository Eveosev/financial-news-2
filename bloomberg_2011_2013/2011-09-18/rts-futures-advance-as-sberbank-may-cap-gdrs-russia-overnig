RTS futures rose, signaling the
measure in Moscow may rebound from a second weekly decline after
Russian shares fell to their lowest valuations in more than two
years. OAO Sberbank surged as analysts said the lender imposed a
limit on the number of shares that can be sold in  London .  Futures on the dollar-denominated index expiring in
December climbed 0.5 percent to 154,655 on Sept. 16, after the
RTS Index in Moscow declined 1.8 percent to 1,574.94, extending
its drop in the week to 3.1 percent. The 30-stock  Micex Index (INDEXCF) ’s
0.4 percent drop for the week to 1,511.50 pushed its average
price to estimated earnings ratio to 5.6, the lowest level since
March 2009, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The Micex
may slide 1 percent at the start of trading, according to  Alfa
Bank . Asian stocks retreated.  “Russian stocks are cheap,” Vlad Milev, a Los Angeles-
based analyst at Metzler Payden, which manages $750 million,
said in a phone interview.  Valuations on the Micex -- which has lost 19 percent from
its 2011 high reached on April 6, one percentage point short of
entering a so-called  bear market  -- compare with 9.7 times
earnings for companies on  Brazil ’s Bovespa index and 14.2 times
for the BSE India Sensitive Index.  U.S. and European shares rose on Sept. 16 as euro-area
finance ministers met in  Poland  to discuss implementation of an
expanded bailout fund for the bloc’s debt-plagued members,
boosting the economic outlook for the European Union, Russia’s
biggest trading partner.  Sberbank GDRs  Sberbank, Russia’s largest lender, gained the most since
Aug. 9 in U.S. trading on speculation the amount of global
depositary receipts in the company traded in London had been
capped. The American depositary receipts jumped 5.3 percent to
$11.36, the highest level since Sept. 8. Sberbank GDRs jumped
9.8 percent to $11.77, a record one-day advance, while shares in
Moscow added 0.8 percent to 81.59 rubles, or the equivalent of
$2.60.  GDRs, which may account for as much as 25 percent of
Sberbank’s total equity, may have been capped “at 17 percent or
even a bit lower,”  Luis Saenz , chief executive officer of the
U.S. unit of Moscow-based brokerage Otkritie Financial Corp.,
said in an e-mail. As a result, the London-listed shares “are
commanding a premium,” Saenz said. Sberbank’s Moscow-based
spokesman, Alexander Baziyan, declined to comment when contacted
by phone today.  OAO Lukoil, Russia’s largest non-state oil producer, fell
for a second day in U.S. trading, dropping 1 percent to $56.45,
and bringing its decline last week to 0.9 percent. Lukoil fell
0.5 percent to 1,725.20 rubles in Moscow, the equivalent of
$56.44, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Gazprom, Norilsk  OAO Gazprom, the world’s biggest natural gas exporter, lost

equivalent of $5.39, the data show.  The price of oil, Russia’s biggest export earner, declined
1.3 percent to $86.82 a barrel in  New York  trading today. Urals

$117.60 on Sept. 16. Oil and natural gas contribute about 17
percent of Russia’s gross domestic product.  OAO GMK Norilsk Nickel, the world’s largest producer of the
metal, sank after announcing plans to fund a $4.5 billion share
buyback using international bonds that can be converted into
shares. The ADRs of Norilsk dropped 6.1 percent, the most in
five weeks, to $23.60 after closing in Moscow down 6.2 percent
to 7,225 rubles, or the equivalent of $236.40.  Falling Volatility  Nickel dropped 1.6 percent to $21,160 a ton on the London
Metals Exchange. The Thomson Reuters/Jefferies CRB Index of 19
raw materials declined 0.9 percent on Sept. 16 and 1.2 percent
in the week.  United Co. Rusal, the world’s largest aluminum producer,

Bank of New York Mellon Russia ADR Index was little changed at
766.08.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index advanced for a fifth day,
gaining 0.6 percent to 1,216.01, as U.S. consumer confidence
rose in September from the lowest level since November 2008 as
Americans’ views of current economic conditions improved,
according to the Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan
preliminary index of consumer sentiment released on Sept. 16.
The  Dow Jones Industrial Average  advanced 0.7 percent to
