The Philippines is studying whether
the plan of  Philippine Long Distance Telephone Co. (TEL)  to acquire
Digital Telecommunications Philippines Inc. will violate
antitrust provisions “scattered in various laws,” Justice
Secretary Leila de Lima told reporters in  Manila .  Aquino, in an executive order, designated De Lima as head
of a competition body tasked to guard against monopolies, while
an anti-trust law is pending in Congress. The competition body
is also evaluating “up to what extent” it can exert influence
on the planned acquisition, said De Lima late yesterday as she
joined cabinet officials who saw President  Benigno Aquino  off
before he left for the U.S.  To contact the reporter on this story:
