Volkswagen AG (VOW)  is open to a takeover
of  Suzuki Motor Corp. (7269)  if the Japanese automaker persists in
dissolving the alliance between the two companies,  Spiegel 
magazine reported, citing a Volkswagen manager it didn’t
identify.  If Suzuki cancels its Volkswagen tie-up, the German company
is free under the terms of the deal to add to its 19.9 percent
holding in Suzuki without the Japanese company’s approval,
Spiegel said today in an e-mailed preview of the article.  To contact the reporter on this story:
