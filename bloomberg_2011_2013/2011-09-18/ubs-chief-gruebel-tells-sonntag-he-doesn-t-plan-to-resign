UBS AG (UBSN)  Chief Executive Officer
 Oswald Gruebel  told Der Sonntag he takes responsibility for
everything that happens at the Swiss bank and doesn’t plan to
resign after unauthorized trades that caused a $2 billion loss.  "If someone acts with criminal intent, you can’t do
anything," he told the  newspaper  in an interview. "That will
always exist in our job. If you ask me whether I feel guilty,
then I say no."  UBS has stopped all advertising campaigns, the newspaper
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
