Saudi Arabia , the world’s largest
crude oil exporter, produced 2 percent less oil in July than it
did in the previous month, according to the Joint Organization
Data Initiative.  The kingdom pumped 9.61 million barrels a day in July
compared with 9.81 million barrels in June, statistics posted
today on the initiative’s website show. The Saudi crude data
includes condensates and excludes natural gas liquids, according
to the website.  The country exported 7.19 million barrels a day of crude
oil in July down by 189,000 barrels, or 2.6 percent, from 7.38
million barrels a day in June, the initiative data showed.  The joint initiative is supervised by the Riyadh-based
International Energy Forum, known as the IEF, and compiles data
supplied directly by member governments, which dates back to
January 2002.  The IEF is a group of nations that account for more than 90
percent of global oil and gas supply and demand, established as
a forum for producing and consuming nations to discuss
international energy security.  To contact the reporter on this story:
