Prime Minister  Silvio Berlusconi 
may consider calling an early election in 2012,  La Repubblica 
reported, without saying where it got the information.  Italyâ€™s opposition leaders yesterday asked Berlusconi to
resign, the Italian newspaper said. Italy must hold an election
by the end of 2013.  Berlusconi will appear tomorrow at a Milan hearing for the
so-called Mills trial, Repubblica said.  Berlusconi is accused of bribing U.K. lawyer David Mills to
lie on his behalf under oath. The premier denies any wrongdoing
and says prosecutors want to topple him.  For Related News and Information:
