U.K. Deputy Prime Minister  Nick Clegg  said the country’s top 50 percent tax rate, paid on income
over 150,000 pounds ($240,000) a year, could be reconsidered if
it wasn’t raising enough money and an alternative tax on wealth
could be found.  “If we discover that the 50 pence rate hasn’t raised money
from the wealthy in the way it’s supposed to, we will have to
look at other ways” of taxing the rich, Clegg told BBC
television’s “Andrew Marr Show” today in Birmingham, England.
“It stays unless first, we make much more progress on lowering
the tax burden on people on low and middle incomes, and unless
we can find other ways of making sure people at the top pay
their fair share.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
