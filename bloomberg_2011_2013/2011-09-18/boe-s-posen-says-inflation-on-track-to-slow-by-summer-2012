Adam Posen , a member of the  Bank of
England ’s Monetary Policy Committee, said he sees inflation
peaking this year and slowing by next summer.  “At the moment inflation is creeping up, but it’s about to
peak and then come down,” Posen told Sky News television today.
“I don’t see inflation as a threat. If the inflation were to
get bad, it’s pretty easy for us to take it down.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
