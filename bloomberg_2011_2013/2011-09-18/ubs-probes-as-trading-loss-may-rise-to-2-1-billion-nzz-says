UBS AG (UBSN) â€™s loss from unauthorized
trading may be about $100 million more than the $2 billion the
bank originally estimated,  NZZ am Sonntag  said, citing
unidentified people close to the situation.  The board of directors decided on Sept. 16 to set up a
committee headed by David Sidwell, a board member and former
Morgan Stanley chief financial officer, and hire an outside
auditing firm to investigate the loss, a UBS spokesman said,
according to the newspaper. UBS plans to shrink its investment
bank unit, NZZ cited an unidentified board member as saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
