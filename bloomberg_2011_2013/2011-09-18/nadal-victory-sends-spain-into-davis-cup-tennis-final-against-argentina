World No. 2  Rafael Nadal  outplayed
Jo-Wilfried Tsonga of France to lead Spain to the final of
tennis’s Davis Cup today. Argentina, which beat defending
champion Serbia, will be its opponent.  Nadal, beaten in the U.S. Open final six days ago by world
No. 1 Novak Djokovic of Serbia, beat Tsonga 6-0, 6-2, 6-4 in
Cordoba, Spain, to give his nation an unbeatable 3-1 lead.
Fernando Verdasco made it 4-1 with a 6-2, 6-1 victory over
Richard Gasquet.  Djokovic retired because of back problems in the second set
of his match against Juan Martin del Potro in Belgrade as the
visitors went ahead 3-1. Del Potro was leading 7-6 (7-5), 3-0 at
the time. Serbia’s Janko Tipsarevic, leading 6-2, won on Juan Monaco’s retirement in the final match.  Djokovic’s win in the  U.S. Open  was his third Grand Slam
title of the season. He led Serbia to its first Davis Cup title
last December on home soil in Belgrade.  Four-time champion Spain will meet three-time runner-up
Argentina in the final in December. Spain is seeking a third win
in four years.  To contact the reporter on this story:
