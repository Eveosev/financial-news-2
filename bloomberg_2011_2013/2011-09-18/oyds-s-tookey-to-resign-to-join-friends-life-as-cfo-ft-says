Lloyds Banking Group Plc (LLOY)  Finance
Director Tim Tookey is to resign and join Friends Life as chief
financial officer, the Financial Times reported, without saying
where it got the information.  Friends Life, the U.K. life insurance company owned by
 Resolution Ltd. (RSL) , will announce Tookey’s appointment tomorrow,
the FT said. Lloyds hasn’t found a replacement for Tookey yet
and will begin an external search now, the newspaper said.  A Lloyds spokeswoman declined to comment when contacted
outside office hours today. Alex Child-Villiers, spokesman for
Friends Life, declined to comment when contacted by telephone.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
