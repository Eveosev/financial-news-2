Africa-Israel Investments Ltd. (AFIL) ,
billionaire Lev Leviev’s holding company, fell to the lowest
close in almost a week in  Tel Aviv , after talks to sell the
Clock Tower Building in New York ended without an agreement.  The shares dropped 2.5 percent to 11.52 shekels, the lowest
since Sept. 12, at the 4:30 p.m. close of trading.  Africa-Israel is continuing to weigh opportunities to sell
the property, it said. The company said in May it was in talks
to sell the building to an unidentified investor for $170
million.  Africa Israel USA, the company’s U.S. real-estate unit, has
been working to restructure and refinance more than $1.5 billion
in debt from its boom-time real-estate acquisitions in the U.S.
The unit on Sept. 1 completed the first stage of the sale of its
rights in 88 Leonard, a luxury apartment building in  Manhattan ’s
TriBeCa neighborhood, and in July sold part of the Times Square
building.  To contact the reporter on this story:
