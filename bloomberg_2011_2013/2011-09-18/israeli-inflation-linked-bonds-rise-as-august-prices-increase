Israeli inflation-linked bonds
surged the most in more than a month and the Mimshal Shiklit due
January 2020 fell after a report showed consumer prices in
August increased more than forecast as rents climbed.  The yield on the CPI-linked bond due in June 2013 dropped
11 basis points, or 0.11 percentage point, the most since Aug.
15, to 1.28 percent at the 4:30 p.m. close in  Tel Aviv . The two-
year breakeven rate, which reflects market expectations for
inflation over the time period, rose 23 basis points to 181,
implying an average annual inflation rate of 1.81 percent.  “The higher-than-forecast August index was mainly a result
of one-time and seasonal increases including the housing index,
as at the end of the summer, landlords tend to raise prices and
renew contracts,” said Uriel Goren, head of the international
clients desk at Tel Aviv-based DS Securities & Investments. DS
Securities forecasts consumer prices to retreat 0.1 percent in
September and increase 0.3 percent in October.  Consumer prices advanced 0.5 percent from July as housing
costs rose 1.3 percent, the largest monthly increase since at
least February, the Jerusalem Central Bureau of Statistics said
Sept. 15. The median estimate in Bloomberg survey was 0.3
percent. The annual inflation rate was 3.4 percent. The economy
expanded an annualized 3.5 percent in the second quarter, the
least in two years, the bureau said today. The previous estimate
was for growth of 3.3 percent.  ‘Damping Expectations’  Bank of Israel  Governor  Stanley Fischer  said today the
Palestinian drive to gain United Nations membership may affect
the economy if it leads to unrest. Palestinian Authority
President  Mahmoud Abbas  has said that later this week he will
request that the UN Security Council recognize a Palestinian
state and accept it as a full member, a measure that  Israel  and
the U.S. oppose.  The yield on the Mimshal Shiklit bond due January 2020
advanced for a second day, increasing one basis point to 4.59
percent. The yield on the 5.5 percent bond due in January 2022
was unchanged at 4.78 percent.  The increase in consumer prices “is damping market
expectations that the central bank will be able to cut interest
rates at the end of this month,” said Sagie Poznerson, a bond
trader at Leader Capital Markets Ltd. in Tel Aviv.  Rate Cut Speculation  U.S. concerns, the sovereign-debt crisis in  Europe  and
slowing domestic inflation had spurred speculation that the Bank
of Israel may reverse course and loosen monetary policy. Growth
may slow in the second half of 2011, depending on developments
in the global economy, Fischer said Aug. 30. The economy will
expand 4.8 percent in 2011 and 3.9 percent in 2012, the central
bank said last month, lowering its forecasts from 5.2 percent
and 4.2 percent.  Fischer has raised the benchmark interest rate 10 times in
the past two years in an effort to rein in inflation, which has
exceeded the government’s 1 percent to 3 percent target since
the beginning of the year. He left the benchmark lending rate at
3.25 percent for a third month in August. Fischer said today the
central bank can lower rates if necessary.  Two-year  interest-rate  swaps, an indicator of investor
expectations for rates over the period, rose seven basis points
to 2.98 percent, the highest this month, on Sept. 16  The shekel was little changed trading at 3.6629 against the
dollar on Sept. 16. The Tel-Bond 40 Index of corporate bonds
gained for a fourth day, climbing 0.9 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
