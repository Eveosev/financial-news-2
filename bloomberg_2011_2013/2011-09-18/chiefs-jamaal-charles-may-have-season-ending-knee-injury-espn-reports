Kansas City Chiefs  running back
Jamaal Charles will likely miss the rest of the season after
tearing a ligament in his left knee,  ESPN reported .  Charles, who was second in the  National Football League 
with 1,467 yards rushing last season, was injured during the
first quarter of today’s 48-3 loss to the Detroit Lions after
being pushed out of bounds.  The Pro Bowl running back was taken off the field on a cart
and will have tests tomorrow to confirm the initial diagnosis of
a torn anterior cruciate ligament, ESPN said, citing an
unidentified person familiar with the situation.  Charles’s injury is the latest setback for the defending
AFC Western Division champions, who are 0-2 this season and have
been outscored 89-10 in losses to Buffalo and  Detroit . Thomas
Jones and Dexter McCluster would likely fill in at running back
if Charles is out for an extended time, ESPN said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
