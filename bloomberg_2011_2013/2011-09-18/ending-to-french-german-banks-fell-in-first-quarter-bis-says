International lending to euro-area
banks fell in the first quarter, driven by a decline in foreign
credit to French and German lenders, the  Bank for International
Settlements  said.  International banks reporting to BIS reduced their cross-
border lending to euro-area banks by 3.1 percent, or $69
billion, in the first three months of the year, it said in its
 quarterly report  released yesterday.  The decline was driven by a 5 percent drop in debt provided
to French banks and a 5.4 percent decline in loans to German
banks, Basel-based BIS said. The numbers are adjusted for
exchange rate changes. Lending to Spanish and Irish banks
contracted by 10 percent and 13 percent, respectively, according
to the report.  The Euribor-OIS spread, a gauge of banksâ€™ reluctance to
lend to each other in  Europe , has risen since it hit a low of
13.7 basis points during the first quarter. It stood at 77.2
basis points on Sept. 16 in  London . The index measures the
difference between the three-month euro interbank offered rate
and overnight index swaps. It had reached 84.6 on Sept. 12, the
highest level since March 2009.  The BIS records cross-border lending by banks reporting to
it in 30 countries, including all major developed economies. It
is due to report provisional second-quarter data Oct. 20.  To contact the reporter on this story:
