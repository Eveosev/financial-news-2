Delta Air Lines Inc. (DAL) ’s plan to invest
$100 million in  Gol Linhas Aereas Inteligentes SA  is “very
positive” for the Brazilian carrier,  Banco Bradesco SA  said.  The 47 percent premium offered on Gol’s shares implies a
higher value for the company and gives it access to Delta’s
global platform, Edigimar Maximiliano Jr., an analyst at
Bradesco, wrote in a note to clients today.  Bradesco reiterated its “outperform” rating on Gol.  To contact the reporter on this story:
