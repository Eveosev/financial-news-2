Ukrainian winter grains sprouted on
71 percent of seeded areas as dry weather damaged crops, the
 Agriculture Ministry  said.  Plants in satisfactory condition accounted for 69.2 percent
of the total and 30.8 percent were classified as weak, the Kiev-
based  ministry  said today by e-mail.  Weather conditions were “unfavorable” for development of
winter grains in southern and eastern regions including
Dnipropetrovsk, Odessa, Kherson and Mykolaiv, according to the
ministry. Ukraine’s south and east produce most of the country’s
grain.  The ministry said it’s preparing for reseeding in spring of
areas with winter-crop damage. Replanting may cover 1.5 million
hectares (3.7 million acres), it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
