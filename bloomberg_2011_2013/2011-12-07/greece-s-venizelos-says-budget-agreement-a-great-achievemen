Greek Finance Minister Evangelos Venizelos said the parliamentary approval received today for the
nation’s 2012 budget was a “great achievement.”  The financial plan that aims to almost halve the deficit
shortfall from a debt writedown and ensure  Greece  remains a
member of the euro area was necessary, Venizelos said in
recorded comments that were broadcast during an investor
conference in  New York  today.  The 2012 fiscal plan, which forecasts a  deficit  of 5.4
percent of gross domestic product and a fifth year of
contraction, is designed to regain the confidence of creditors
and secure resumption of international financing for Greece.
 Standard & Poor’s  yesterday warned it may downgrade 15 euro-area
governments on lack of decisive action to tackle the region’s
debt crisis, days before European leaders meet the next two days
during a summit in Brussels.  To contact the reporter on this story:
