ConocoPhillips (COP)  said operations at its
221,000 barrel-a-day  Humber  oil refinery in  England  weren't 
affected by the arrival of about 40 to 50 contractors at the 
plant in support of a labor dispute.  The protesters gathered for about 45 minutes, said Nina Stobart, a company spokeswoman based at the site.  “A small number of maintenance contract workers arrived at
the Humber refinery to support an unrelated dispute,” Stobart
said in an e-mailed statement. “There are no contractor labor
disputes at the ConocoPhillips refinery, no staff are involved,
and refinery operations are unaffected.”  Unite, the U.K.’s biggest union,  said  protests would take
place at construction sites across Britain today in response to
proposed industrial employment contracts.  To contact the reporter on this story:
