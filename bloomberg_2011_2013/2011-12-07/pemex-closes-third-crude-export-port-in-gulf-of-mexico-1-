Petroleos Mexicanos , Latin America’s
largest crude producer, closed its third crude-export terminal
in the  Gulf of Mexico  because of strong winds and high waves.  The company’s smallest terminal at the port of Dos Bocas
was shut, according to a weather bulletin posted on the website
of Mexico’s Merchant Marine today. The ports of Cayo Arcas and
Coatzacoalcos were closed earlier today.  Mexico, the third-largest supplier of oil to the U.S. after
Canada and Saudi Arabia, exported about 1.36 million barrels of
crude a day in 2010, according to Energy Ministry statistics.
About 84 percent of the crude went to the U.S.  Pemex, as the national oil company is called, exported
907,490 barrels a day from Cayo Arcas, 241,726 barrels a day
from Coatzacoalcos and 179,247 barrels a day from Dos Bocas last
year, according to the Energy Ministry.  To contact the reporter on this story:
