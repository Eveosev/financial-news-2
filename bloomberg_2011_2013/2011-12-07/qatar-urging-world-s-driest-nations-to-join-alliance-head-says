Qatar, which will host the annual
round of United Nations climate talks in 2012, is urging the
world’s driest nations at this year’s talks in  South Africa  to
join its Global Dry Land Alliance, the chairman said.  “We will be establishing it by December 2012” to coincide
with next year’s climate talks in Doha, Fahad Mohammed al-Attiya
said today in an interview in Durban. “We have meetings lined
up with some of the 40 countries classified as ‘dry nations.’”  The alliance will focus on ways to prevent long-term food
security issues that affect supplies, and also offer an umbrella
protection to members in case of a food or water crisis, al-
Attiya said.  Dry nations are increasingly concerned about the food
situation after high prices in 2008 sparked riots in about 30
countries that depend on imported foodstuffs. The United Nations
Food and Agriculture Organization’s  Food Price Index  of 55 food
commodities reached an all-time high of 237.7 in February. It
was at 216.10 on Oct. 31.  Those considered “dry nation” include Morocco,  Egypt ,
 Australia , the sub-Saharan nations,  Mexico  and others in the
Persian Gulf and central Asia regions.  To contact the reporter on this story:
