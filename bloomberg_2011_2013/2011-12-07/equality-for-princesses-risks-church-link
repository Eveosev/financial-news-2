David Cameron ’s plan to end
discrimination against princesses and Catholics in the British
royal family risks opening questions about other traditions,
including the status of the Church of England, a panel of
lawmakers concluded.  Current laws, including the  1700 Act of Settlement , give
male heirs precedence over their older sisters. The act also
excludes Roman Catholics or anyone married to a Roman Catholic
from becoming king or queen. Spurred on by the wedding of  Prince William  this year, Cameron agreed the law needed to be changed.  In a report published today, Parliament’s Political and
Constitutional Reform Committee welcomed what it called the
“modest” proposals. Nevertheless, it warned that the plan
raises questions about how other hereditary noble titles are
passed between the generations and whether the monarch should
continue to be the head of the Church of  England .  It pointed out that a Catholic married to the monarch would
usually be expected to promise to raise their children as
Catholics, excluding them from the line of succession under
rules that Cameron isn’t proposing to change.  “We welcome the proposal that would allow a member of the
royal family to marry a Roman Catholic without losing their
place in the line of succession,” the committee said. “The
proposal does, however, raise questions about the future role of
the Crown in the Church of England.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
