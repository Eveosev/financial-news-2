Gold gained for a second day after
exchange-traded product holdings climbed to a record and
speculation that European leaders are making progress in
containing the debt crisis boosted the euro and equities.
Palladium rallied to the highest level in more than two months.  Immediate-delivery gold advanced 0.2 percent to $1,731.28
an ounce at 3:23 p.m. in Singapore. Metal held in  ETPs  climbed
to 2,358.206 metric tons yesterday, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg. February-delivery bullion rose 0.2 percent to
$1,734.80 on the Comex in  New York .  European officials are negotiating a bigger rescue plan to
present at a summit in Brussels that begins tomorrow. Policy
makers may run two bailout funds simultaneously, the Financial
Times said yesterday, bolstering the euro against the dollar.  “Gold and silver drifted higher as the  U.S. dollar (DXY) 
eased,”  Lachlan Shaw , an analyst at Commonwealth Bank of
 Australia , said in an e-mail today. Trading is “thin” as
investors wait for the summit, he said.  The euro was at $1.3443, rebounding from yesterday’s low of
$1.3334. The MSCI Asia Pacific Index of equities increased as
much as 1.4 percent.  Spot palladium extended yesterday’s 5.9 percent gain, the
most since December 2009, after U.S. light-vehicle sales grew
last month, boosting speculation demand will increase for the
metal used in autocatalysts. It climbed as much as 1.5 percent
to $680 an ounce today, the highest price since Sept. 22.  Cash silver was little changed at $32.72 an ounce, while
platinum advanced 0.7 percent to $1,534.50 an ounce.  To contact the reporter on this story:
