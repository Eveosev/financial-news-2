Hungary ’s  industrial production 
expanded faster than economists forecast in October, helping the
economy recover from the worst recession in 18 years.  Output increased a workday-adjusted 3 percent from a year
earlier, the same pace as the previous month, the statistics
office in Budapest said in a preliminary report today. The
median  estimate  of 12 economists surveyed by Bloomberg was for a
rise of 2.3 percent. Output declined 0.9 percent from September.  Exports to the euro region fueled Hungary’s recovery from
its worst recession since 1991 as factories such as Audi AG and
 Nokia Oyj (NOK1V)  boosted production. The government may cut its growth
forecast for 2012 from the current 1.5 percent as the debt
crisis in  Europe  saps export demand.  “Compared with the beginning of the year, the pace of
industrial output growth is on a steady decline and the slowdown
in exports is at the root of this,” statistician Miklos Schindele told reporters. In October, all export segments
registered slower growth, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
