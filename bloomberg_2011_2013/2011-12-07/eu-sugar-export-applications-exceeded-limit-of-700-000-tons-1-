The European Union issued licenses to
export 699,999.992 metric tons of sugar in the 2011-12 season
started in October, according to the European Commission, the
bloc’s regulatory arm.  Applications were made to export 1.29 million tons of the
sweetener, according to a notice on the commission’s website
today. The limit was 700,000 tons, it said. EU sugar production
will climb to 18 million tons in 2011-12 from 16 million tons
last season, said Keith Flury, an analyst at Rabobank
International in  London .  “It’s little surprise the application for licenses exceed
the 700,000 tons given the size of the EU crop this season,”
Peter de Klerk, an analyst at C. Czarnikow Sugar Futures Ltd.,
said by phone from London today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
