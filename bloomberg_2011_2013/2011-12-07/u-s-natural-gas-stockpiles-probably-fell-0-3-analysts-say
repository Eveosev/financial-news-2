U.S. natural-gas supplies probably
fell by less than the seasonal average last week as moderate
weather reduced heating-fuel demand, according to analyst
estimates compiled by  Bloomberg .  Inventories dropped 11 billion cubic feet, or 0.3 percent,
to 3.84 trillion cubic feet in the week ended Dec. 2, based on
the median of 12 estimates. The five-year average change for the
week is a decrease of 66 billion, according data from the Energy
Department, whose weekly supply report is due tomorrow.
Stockpiles fell 79 billion the same week last year.  Temperatures were mostly seasonal or above-normal in the
eastern half of the U.S. last week, according to Commodity
Weather Group LLC in Bethesda, Maryland. Marketed gas production
will average 67.72 billion cubic feet a day in 2012, up from
66.87 billion estimated in November, the department said
yesterday in its monthly  Short-Term Energy Outlook .  “The cold weather has been slow in coming this season,”
said Jason Schenker, the president of Prestige Economics LLC in
Austin,  Texas . “The supply side of the equation remains
robust.”  The stockpile estimates ranged from an increase of 1
billion to a decline of 42 billion cubic feet. The department’s
weekly supply report is scheduled for release at 10:30 a.m.
tomorrow in  Washington .  The low temperature in  New York  on Dec. 1 was 37 degrees
Fahrenheit (3 Celsius), matching the normal temperature,
according to  AccuWeather Inc.  in  State College , Pennsylvania.
The low in Chicago was 30 degrees, 2 above normal.  About 51 percent of U.S. households use natural gas for
heating, according to the Energy Department.  Natural gas futures rose 4.2 cents, or 1.2 percent, to
$3.584 per million British thermal units last week on the  New
York Mercantile Exchange . The January contract today fell 5.6
cents, or 1.6 percent, to $3.431 per million Btu at 11:59 a.m.
in New York.  To contact the reporter on this story:
