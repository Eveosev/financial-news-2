Pilots at Iberia, the Spanish
division of  International Consolidated Airlines Group , plan to
strike for two days during the Christmas holiday period in a
dispute over work assignments as the carrier reorganizes.  Flight crews will stop work on Dec. 18 and 29, said a
spokeswoman for Iberia in  Madrid , who declined to be named in
line with company policy. No one was immediately available to
comment at the Sepla pilots union or the transport department of
the Public Works Ministry in Madrid.  The pilots are protesting Iberiaâ€™s plans to create a lower-
cost unit for short-haul flights. The Spanish company, which
merged with  British Airways  at the beginning of this year to
create London-based IAG, plans to transfer planes to the Iberia
Express unit in 2012 to boost profitability of domestic and
European flights.  Iberia  is waiting for the government to decide on the
minimum level of services pilots will have to provide, and is
working on contingency plans including finding seats on other
airlines for its customers, the carrier said in an e-mailed
statement.  IAG fell as much as 3.1 percent to 149.6 pence, the biggest
intraday decline since Nov. 29, and was down 2.3 percent at 1:44
p.m. in  London . The stock has declined 45 percent this year,
valuing the company at 2.8 billion pounds ($4.4 billion).  To contact the reporters on this story:
