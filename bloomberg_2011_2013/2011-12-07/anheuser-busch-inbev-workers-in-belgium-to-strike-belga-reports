Anheuser-Busch InBev NV (ABI)  workers at
production and distribution sites in  Belgium  will strike this
morning to protest the failure of negotiations for a new labor
agreement for the coming two years, Belga newswire reported,
citing a union official.  The point of contention is a union demand for a guaranteed
income for the next two years to accompany a work-assurance
guarantee, which the management is prepared to give for the
period, according to the newswire.  To contact the reporter on this story:
