Aegon NV (AGN) , the Dutch insurer that owns
Transamerica Corp., is seeking as much as 2.2 billion euros
($2.68 billion) of loans to refinance debt maturing next year,
according to two people with direct knowledge of the deal.  The five-year facility, which will include a 1 billion-euro
revolving credit, is being arranged by Bank of America Corp. and
Citigroup Inc., said the people, who declined to be identified
because terms are private. Proceeds will refinance loans
including a 3 billion-euro revolving credit signed in 2005 that
is due to mature in September 2012.  Aegon spokesman Dick Schiethart didn’t immediately reply to
an e-mail seeking comment.  The Hague, Netherlands-based insurer is rated A3 by Moody’s
Investors Service and A- by  Standard & Poor’s .  To contact the reporter on this story:
