Genomic Health Inc. (GHDX) , maker of a
genetic test for  breast cancer , rose to its highest level in six
years after a study showed the test can help predict which women
with small tumors will see their disease worsen.  Genomic Health gained 1.9 percent to $29.01 at the close in
 New York , the highest price since the  Redwood City , California-
based company first sold shares in September 2005. The stock has
gained 40 percent in the past 12 months.  The product, already sold to evaluate more-advanced tumors,
will be available for women with small tumors on Dec. 28, the
company said. The study, presented at the San Antonio Breast
Cancer Symposium, identified women with fast-growing forms of
ductal carcinoma in situ who may need aggressive treatment, said
Lawrence Solin, chair of radiation oncology at  Einstein Medical
Center  in Philadelphia.  Almost 45,000 women are diagnosed each year with ductal
carcinoma in situ, typically a small tumor contained in the milk
ducts. Most women get a lumpectomy to remove the cancerous
cells, and the disease returns in about 20 percent to 25 percent
of women. Until now, there was no way to identify which patients
were most at risk.  The test “will help physicians understand the underlying
biology of DCIS for an individual patient and accurately gauge
the risk for that person,” Solin said. “As a result, the
patient and physician can decide on the appropriate course of
treatment based on a more complete understanding of the risk
involved.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
