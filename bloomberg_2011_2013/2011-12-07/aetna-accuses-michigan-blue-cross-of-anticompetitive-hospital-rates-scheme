Aetna Inc. (AET)  sued Blue Cross Blue
Shield of Michigan, the state’s biggest health insurer, saying
it uses an anticompetitive scheme that forces rival insurers to
pay more for hospital services.  “Stated simply, Blue Cross has entered into exclusionary
contracts with hospitals under which it agreed to pay hospitals
more money if the hospitals increased the rates they demanded to
treat patients covered by its competitors’ health plans,” Aetna
said in a complaint filed today in federal court in Detroit.  Aetna said that, starting in 2005, it made an “enormous”
investment to expand its business in Michigan, including
acquiring HMS Healthcare for about $390 million. Hartford,
Connecticut-based Aetna accuses Blue Cross Blue Shield of
 Michigan  of violating U.S. antitrust law and it seeks three
times the amount of damages it sustained.  Blue Cross Blue Shield of Michigan in August lost a bid to
dismiss a joint U.S.-state lawsuit accusing it of driving up
competitors’ costs through preferential pricing contracts with
hospitals. In some cases, hospitals charged rivals 30 percent to
40 percent more than Blue Cross, the U.S. Justice Department has
said.  Representatives of Blue Cross Blue Shield of Michigan in
Detroit didn’t immediately return a call seeking comment on the
new lawsuit after regular business hours today.  The case is Aetna v. Blue Cross Blue Shield of Michigan,
11-15346, U.S. District Court, Eastern District of Michigan
( Detroit .)  To contact the reporter on this story:
