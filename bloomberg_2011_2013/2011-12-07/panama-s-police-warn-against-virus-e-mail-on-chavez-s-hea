Panama ’s National Police said that e-
mails alleging the death of Venezuelan President  Hugo Chavez ,
who had a cancerous tumor removed in June, are false and part of
a virus that can damage computers.  “Warning: Don’t open e-mails about ‘the death of Hugo
Chavez,’” the police said on its official  Twitter account 
today. “It is false and contains a virus that can damage your
computer.”  Venezuelan government and state oil company Petroleos de
Venezuela SA bonds rallied today on the bogus report.
 Prensa.com , a news website in Panama, denied that it had spread
the news as the e-mail containing the virus said.  The yield on Venezuela’s benchmark 9.25 percent bonds fell
20 basis points at 3 p.m. in Caracas, while the price rose 1
cent to 72.46 cents on the dollar, according to prices compiled
by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
