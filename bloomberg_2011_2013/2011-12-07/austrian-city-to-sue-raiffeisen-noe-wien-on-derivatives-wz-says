The City of St. Poelten, capital of
the province of Lower Austria, is preparing to sue regional
lender Raiffeisenlandesbank Niederoesterreich-Wien AG regarding
a derivatives swap agreement, Wiener Zeitung reported, citing
city spokesman Martin Koutny.  “The judiciary should be brought in to clarify the
different legal views of the city and the financial institution
regarding the validity of a swap transaction,” Koutny told the
Vienna-based paper. St. Poelten’s municipal council will make
the final decision on Dec. 13, the paper said.  The Swiss franc swaps may have an annual interest burden of
as much as 3.5 million euros ($4.7 million), municipal councilor
Bernhard Wurzer told the paper. Exiting the agreement would cost
between 75 million euros and 80 million euros, Wiener Zeitung
said, without saying where it got the information.  “We have held talks with St. Poelten, but have not yet
received any complaint,” RLB NOe-Wien spokeswoman Michaela
Stefan said to Bloomberg News.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
