Olympic gold medalist Lindsey Vonn
became the first U.S. alpine skier to win four consecutive World
Cup events with a Super-G victory today in her hometown of
Beaver Creek,  Colorado .  Vonn, 27, finished in 1 minute, 10.68 seconds on the Birds
of Prey course to beat Fabienne Suter of Switzerland by .37 of a
second, tying the career record of 16 Super-G victories held by
 Germany ’s Katja Seizinger.  “I was so nervous,” Vonn told reporters after the race. I
had so much pressure and I really wanted to come through.
“Today was one of the bigger challenges of my life trying to
win at home.”  Vonn now has five victories in the six races she’s started
this season and 46 World Cup career wins, tying her with
Austria’s Renate Goetschl for the third-most all-time, said U.S.
Ski Team spokesman  Tom Kelly .  Vonn had swept all three World Cup races -- two downhill
events and a Super-G -- in Lake Louise,  Canada , last weekend.  Vonn won an Olympic gold medal in the women’s downhill at
the 2010 Vancouver Games and captured season-long World Cup
titles in 2008, 2009 and 2010.  To contact the reporter on this story:
