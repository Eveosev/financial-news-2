Spotify Ltd., the music-streaming
company that began offering U.S. service in July, said the rock
group The Black Keys is withholding its new album “El Camino.”  The release from  Warner Music Group (WMG) ’s Nonesuch Records went
on sale yesterday at  Apple Inc. (AAPL) ’s iTunes and other outlets. It
won’t be available on streaming services such as Spotify and
Rdio Inc., according to the companies.  The Black Keys join Coldplay and Adele Adkins, whose “21”
is the top-selling album of the year, in declining to make full
albums available on Spotify and other streaming services. The
Black Keys sold 883,000 copies of its last album, “Brothers,”
in the U.S. according to Nielsen SoundScan data.  “We’re hopeful we’ll have the record on our service
soon,” said Drew Larner, chief executive officer of San
Francisco-based Rdio, started by Skype co-founder Janus Friis.  Alison Bonny, a spokeswoman for Spotify, declined to
comment further. Luke Burland, a spokesman for New York-based
Nonesuch Records, didn’t respond to requests for comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
