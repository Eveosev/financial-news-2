Fed funds, the U.S. overnight inter-
bank lending  rate , opened at 0.08 percent, within the  Federal
Reserve ’s target of zero to 0.25 percent.  Fed funds closed at 0.06 percent yesterday after trading
from 0.04 percent to 0.18 percent and averaging 0.08 percent,
according to ICAP Plc, the world’s largest inter-dealer broker.  The central bank will sell Treasury Inflation Protected
Securities maturing from April 2012 to April 2014. The
transaction is part of the Fed’s program to replace
$400 billion of short-term debt in its portfolio with longer-
term Treasuries to reduce borrowing costs further and counter
rising risks of a recession.  The central bank plans to sell $1 billion to $1.5 billion
of securities today, according to the New York Fed’s website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
