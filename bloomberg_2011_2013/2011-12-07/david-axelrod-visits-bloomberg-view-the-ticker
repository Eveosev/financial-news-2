President Barack Obama's strategist  David Axelrod  stopped by Bloomberg View today, where he chatted with editors and invited guests. A few quick hits: Axelrod said he was anticipating a long Republican primary campaign. When asked whether he thought that would benefit the eventual nominee in the way Obama benefited from his long primary against Hillary Clinton, he said no: "In 2008, we were not moving farther and farther to the left." He called  Newt Gingrich  the "Godfather of Gridlock." When asked whether the Obama team had sketched out what a Gingrich candidacy would entail in a general election, Axelrod said, "I don't even think Gingrich has the Gingrich campaign sketched out. I don't see why we should be out in front of him on that." Axelrod said the 2008 campaign "ripped the band aid" from a sore -- declining  living standards , middle class economic hardship -- that was long festering. On the 2010 elections, he maintained that voters have "buyers' remorse" over entrusting the House and numerous governors' seats to Republicans. On the GOP's Tea-Party-inspired move to the right, "I think what we have to do is break the fever." On Republican resistance to extending the payroll tax deduction: "I would rather have the  tax cut  than the issue." (Francis Wilkinson is a member of the Bloomberg View editorial board.)
