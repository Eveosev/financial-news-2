Expedia Inc. (EXPE)  plans to spin off its
TripAdvisor Inc. unit as a publicly held business around Dec.
20, letting investors bet on its fast-growing travel-
recommendation service.  The TripAdvisor spinoff, first announced in April, was
“overwhelmingly approved” by Expedia stockholders at its
annual meeting, the Bellevue, Washington-based company said
today in a statement. As part of the move, Expedia will
consolidate its shares with a reverse 1-for-2 stock split.  After the TripAdvisor deal, all of its outstanding stock
will be held by Expedia shareholders. TripAdvisor will be listed
on the Nasdaq Stock Market under the ticker symbol TRIP and
headquartered in Newton,  Massachusetts .  The move will let shareholders benefit from the success of
TripAdvisor, a smaller business that is outpacing Expedia’s main
operations. In the third quarter, sales at TripAdvisor climbed
30 percent to $180.8 million, double the growth rate of Expedia,
which recorded revenue of $1.14 billion. TripAdvisor includes 19
travel and advertising brands.  Expedia shares fell less than 1 percent today to $28.81.
The stock has gained 15 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
