Countries whose debt level is not
sustainable will not qualify for the new credit line created by
the  International Monetary Fund  last month, a description of the
program shows.  The Precautionary and Liquidity Line, which comes with few
conditions attached, was approved by the board as part of the
fund’s efforts to encourage countries to turn for help when
facing outside shocks.  The IMF will not approve such a line for members facing “a
public debt position that is not sustainable in the medium term
with a high probability,” according to a document on the
decision dating Nov. 21 and released today.  Other hurdles include “sustained inability to access
international  capital markets , the need to undertake a large
macroeconomic or structural policy adjustment” unless it was
started before approval and “ widespread bank insolvencies.”  The new line enables countries that pre-qualify to request
IMF funds without having to make as many policy changes as with
traditional loans and comes as  Europe ’s crisis threatens to
spread to France and Spain.  To contact the reporter on this story:
