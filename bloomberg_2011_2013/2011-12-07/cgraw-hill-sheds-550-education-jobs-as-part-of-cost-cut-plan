McGraw-Hill Cos. (MHP) , owner of  Standard &
Poor’s , plans to eliminate 550 jobs at its education unit as the
company looks to trim $100 million in expenses in preparation
for its split into two companies by the end of 2012.  The move eliminates 10 percent of McGraw-Hill’s education
employees, the New York-based company said today in a statement
after the close of trading. McGraw-Hill will also buy back $500
million in shares, after completing a $1 billion repurchase
program.  The company said it “anticipates additional realignment”
in 2012 before the split, which may include outsourcing. A year-
long company review and pressure to increase  shareholder value 
from New York-based hedge fund Jana Partners LLC led McGraw-Hill
on Sept. 12 to announce it’s dividing into one company that
focuses on financial data and another for textbook publishing.  “The increased share repurchases, substantial cost-cutting
initiatives and creation of two powerful new companies position
us to deliver increased value for our shareholders,” Chief
Executive Officer Harold “Terry” McGraw said in the statement.  As part of the plan for the split, the company had pledged
to cut at least $100 million in costs and accelerate its stock
buyback plan. McGraw-Hill has about 21,000 employees, according
to Patti Rockenwagner, a spokeswoman.  McGraw-Hill fell 1.4 percent to $42.14 in New York trading
today and has climbed 16 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
