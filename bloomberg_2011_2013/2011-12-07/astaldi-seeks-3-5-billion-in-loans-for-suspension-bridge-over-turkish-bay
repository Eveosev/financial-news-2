An Astaldi SpA-led group building the
world’s second-longest  suspension bridge  in  Turkey  is seeking
$3.5 billion of loans, according to the Italian builder.  Astaldi, Japan’s Itochu Corp. and  IHI Corp. (7013)  and five
Turkish contractors are seeking the first slice of a loan to
finance the $6 billion project which includes a highway linking
Istanbul to Izmir and a crossing over Turkey’s Izmit Bay.  The consortium may seek more funds later, a spokeswoman for
the Rome-based builder said.  The 420-kilometer (260-mile) Gebze-Izmir Highway and 3
kilometer (1.8 mile) suspension bridge is designed to cut travel
time between Istanbul and Izmir by more than half to about
three hours and boost trade with adjacent regions.  Izmit Bridge’s length is surpassed only by  Japan ’s Akashi-
Kaikyo Bridge, according to Turkey’s state-run Anatolia news
agency.  To contact the reporter on this story:
