Asia ’s naphtha crack spread extended
gains, indicating higher profits for refiners making the
petrochemical feedstock. Hin Leong Trading Pte bought gasoil and
fuel oil in  Singapore , the region’s biggest oil-trading center.  Light Distillates  Naphtha’s premium to London-traded Brent crude futures rose
to $85 a metric ton at 5:50 p.m. Singapore time from $79.90 at
the end of Asian trading yesterday, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg. This crack spread is a measure of refining profit.  Trafigura Beheer BV sold two cargoes in Singapore, each
containing 50,000 barrels of  92-RON gasoline , for $112.20 a
barrel, based on a Bloomberg survey of traders who monitored
transactions on the Platts window. Vitol Group bought one cargo,
and Total SA purchased the other.  Cargill Inc. bought 25,000 tons of open-specification
 naphtha  for delivery in the first half of February from Royal
Dutch Shell Plc at $921 a ton, the survey showed. That’s the
third cargo it has purchased this month.  Middle Distillates  Hin Leong bought 150,000 barrels of  gasoil , or diesel, with
0.5 percent sulfur from BP Plc for a second day, paying 70 cents
a barrel more than benchmark quotes, according to the Bloomberg
survey. That’s the highest premium in two weeks. The cargo is
for Dec. 22 to Dec. 26, the earliest loading period.  Gasoil’s premium to Asian marker Dubai crude rose 72 cents
to $18.56 a barrel at 3:03 p.m. Singapore time, based on data
from PVM Oil Associates Ltd., a broker. This  crack spread 
widened the most since Nov. 11.  Jet fuel’s premium to gasoil climbed 5 cents to $1.35 a
barrel, PVM data showed. This  regrade  narrowed the previous two
days, indicating it was less profitable to produce  aviation fuel 
over diesel.  Fuel Oil  Hin Leong bought 20,000 tons of  180-centistoke  fuel oil
from Vitol at $14 a ton over benchmark quotes, according to the
Bloomberg survey. The cargo will load from Dec. 22 to Dec. 26.  Hin Leong also purchased two cargoes of  380-centistoke 
grade, paying $9 a ton over December quotes to Vitol and a $5
premium to Cargill, the survey showed. Koch Industries Inc. sold
a similar cargo to Cargill for $17 above January prices.  Fuel oil’s  discount  to Dubai crude widened 27 cents to
$5.47 a barrel at 3:03 p.m. Singapore time, based on PVM data.
The difference increased for the fifth time in six days,
signaling refiners’ losses from turning oil into residual
products are growing.  The premium of 180-centistoke  fuel oil  to 380-centistoke
grade added 50 cents to $14.25 a ton, PVM said. This  viscosity
spread  is the widest since Nov. 25, meaning bunker, or marine
fuel, advanced less than higher-quality fuel oil.  To contact the reporters on this story:
