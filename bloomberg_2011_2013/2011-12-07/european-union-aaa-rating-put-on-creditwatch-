The European Union had its AAA long-
term rating put on “creditwatch negative” by Standard & Poor’s
Ratings Services after a similar action on 15 of the 17 Euro
members. The EU’s short-term A-1+ rating was affirmed.  “The creditwatch placement is prompted by similar
creditwatch placements, which we made on 15 euro zone sovereigns
on Dec. 5, 2011,” S&P said in a statement today.  “The creditwatch on the EU is an expression of our
concerns about the potential impact on the future debt service
capacity of eurozone sovereigns, and therefore also the EU, in
the context of what we view as deepening political, financial,
and monetary problems within the eurozone.”  S&P said earlier this week that Germany and  France  may be
stripped of their AAA ratings. The euro area’s six AAA-rated
countries are among the nations that were placed on a negative
outlook, and their ratings may be cut depending on the result of
a summit of EU leaders starting tomorrow, S&P said in its Dec. 5
statement.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
