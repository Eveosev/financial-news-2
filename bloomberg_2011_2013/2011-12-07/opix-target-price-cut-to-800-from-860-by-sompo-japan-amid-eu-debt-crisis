Sompo  Japan  Asset Management Co., a
unit of insurer  NKSJ Holdings Inc. , cut its target for the Topix
Index to 800 from 860 for the year ending March.  Europe ’s debt crisis is leading to a reduced outlook for
global growth and will weigh on the index of the largest
companies listed in  Tokyo , Goya Nakao, senior investment manager
at Sompo Japan, which oversees about 4.5 trillion yen in Tokyo,
said by telephone yesterday. The Topix gained 1.6 percent to
close at 749.63 yesterday, paring its loss for the year to 17
percent.  “It’s difficult to solve the European issue quickly, so
market uncertainty will remain,” said Nakao. “The anticipated
growth rate is falling globally and you can see a downside
tendency in U.S. long-term interest rates” amid demand for
safer assets like  government bonds , Nakao said.  U.S. Treasuries have returned 8.9 percent this year,
according to bond indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the European
Federation of Financial Analysts Societies. Benchmark 10-year
yields touched a record low of 1.67 percent on Sept. 23.  The new target of 800 for the  Topix (TPX)  assumes a valuation of
12.3 times estimated earnings. That compares with 13.2 times for
Sompo Japan’s previous target of 860, set in mid-August.  Sompo Japan left its estimate for average earnings per
share on the Topix’s unchanged at about 65 yen for the fiscal
year ending March 2013.  To contact the reporters on this story:
