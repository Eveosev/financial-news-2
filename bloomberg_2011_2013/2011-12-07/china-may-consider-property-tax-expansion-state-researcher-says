The Chinese government may consider
expanding its property tax trials when officials review the
first implementation of the levy in Shanghai and Chongqing, a
state researcher said.  “The government will discuss the experiences from the
property tax trials in Shanghai and Chongqing at the end of the
year and may discuss an expansion plan then,” Jia Kang, head of
the Chinese Finance Ministry’s research institute for fiscal
science, said in a phone interview today. “The conditions for
extending the property tax nationwide are still not ripe.”  China  introduced the property tax trials in the two cities
in January as part of the government’s campaign to rein in
surging  home prices  amid concerns a real-estate bubble was
forming. Property prices are about to reach a “turning point”
as developers face tighter liquidity, the central bank said Dec.
1, following Premier  Wen Jiabao ’s pledge last month that the
curbs won’t be relaxed.  China may decide and announce a plan to expand the property
tax trials to other cities at the end of the year, the China
Securities Journal reported today, citing Jia. The researcher
said the newspaper may have misquoted him.  --Zheng Lifei. With assistance from Zhang Dingmin in
