General Motors Co. (GM) , 10 weeks after
ratifying a new labor contract with the  United Auto Workers ,
said union hourly employees achieved vehicle-quality targets and
will be eligible for about $12 million in bonuses.  The $250 bonus per eligible worker will be paid out in
employees’ Dec. 16 paychecks,  Kim Carpenter , a spokeswoman for
the Detroit-based company, said today in a phone interview. The
“vast majority” of the automaker’s 48,500 UAW-represented
workers are eligible, she said, without giving more specifics.  Chief Executive Officer Dan Akerson has said GM’s new four-
year labor contract keeps the automaker competitive by only
marginally boosting the company’s $5 billion annual labor tab.
Senior workers won’t receive a base wage increase and the union
accepted that some pay would be based on GM’s profitability.  Annual quality bonuses are dependent on GM’s target for
incidents per 1,000 vehicles that have been in  service  for two
months, Carpenter said.  “We were 98 percent of our target, and so the payout is
$250 per eligible UAW employee,” she said.  GM gave wage increases for entry-level workers, $5,000
signing bonuses and other benefits that the company estimates
will total $675 million in costs through 2013. The automaker
estimates it will get $460 million in savings to partially
offset those payouts, according to a Sept. 28  presentation  to
analysts.  Labor costs will rise 1 percent a year, which is the
smallest increase in a GM contract in four decades, the
automaker said in September. GM gained 1.2 percent to $21.94 at
the close in  New York .  To contact the reporters on this story:
