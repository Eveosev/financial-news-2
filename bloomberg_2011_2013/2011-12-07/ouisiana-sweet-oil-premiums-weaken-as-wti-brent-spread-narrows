The premiums for Light Louisiana
Sweet and Heavy Louisiana Sweet oils weakened as the difference
between U.S. benchmark West Texas Intermediate and Brent
narrowed.  The January WTI-Brent  spread  narrowed 60 cents to $8.93 a
barrel at 1:06 p.m. in  New York . The gap for the contracts has
narrowed by 68 percent since reaching a record of $27.88 a
barrel Oct. 14.  When Brent decreases versus WTI, it weakens the value of
low-sulfur U.S. grades that compete with West African oil priced
against the European benchmark.  Light Louisiana Sweet ’s premium to WTI decreased 10 cents
to $10.55 a barrel at 12:06 p.m. in New York, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  Heavy Louisiana Sweet’s  premium narrowed
15 cents to $11.  Thunder Horse’s premium to WTI narrowed 10 cents to $8.75.
The premium for Mars Blend decreased 20 cents to $6.50 a barrel.
 Poseidon ’s premium narrowed 25 cents to $5.50 a barrel over WTI.  Southern Green Canyon ’s premium increased 15 cents to $5.40
a barrel and  West Texas Sour ’s discount was unchanged at 85
cents.  The discount for  Western Canada Select  was unchanged at
$12.90 a barrel.  Syncrude ’s premium was unchanged at $2.90 a barrel.
Syncrude is a light, low-sulfur synthetic oil derived from the
tar sands in  Alberta .  To contact the reporter on this story:
