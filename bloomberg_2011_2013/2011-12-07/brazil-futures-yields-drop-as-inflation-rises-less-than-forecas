Yields on most Brazilian interest-
rate futures contracts dropped after a report that showed
inflation rose less than forecast boosted speculation the
central bank will continue its pace of borrowing-cost cuts to
shield the economy from the European debt crisis.  Yields on the futures contract due in January 2013 fell two
basis points, or 0.02 percentage point, to 9.79 percent at 10:01
a.m. in  Sao Paulo . The real weakened 0.5 percent to 1.7997 per
dollar, from 1.7915 yesterday.  Shorter-term yields fell after prices as measured by the
IGP-DI inflation index rose 0.43 percent in November, according
to data released today by the Rio de Janeiro-based Getulio
Vargas Foundation. That was below the 0.53 percent average
estimate of 36 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. Traders are
speculating slower inflation will prompt policy makers to
continue cutting rates to protect the economy from the European
debt crisis, said Pedro Tuesta, a Washington-based economist for
 Latin America  at 4Cast Inc.  “The market believes that the government is looking to the
global background, basically  Europe ,” Tuesta said in a
telephone interview. “That’s what determines the front end” of
the yield curve, he said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
