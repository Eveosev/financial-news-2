Gasoline fell after an industry-
funded report that  stockpiles  of the motor fuel rose 5.97
million barrels last week.  Futures declined 1.2 percent after the  American Petroleum
Institute  showed the stockpile increase late yesterday. The
Energy Department may report a supply gain of 875,000 barrels in
the week ended Dec. 2, according to the median estimate of 12
analysts in a survey by Bloomberg News.  “The refiners refined everything they had and we saw a big
surge in gasoline inventories that put a damper on the gasoline
market,” said  Phil Flynn , vice president of research at PFGBest
in  Chicago .  Gasoline for January delivery fell 3.04 cents to $2.615 a
gallon at 9:50 a.m. on the  New York Mercantile Exchange , after
settling yesterday at the highest level since Nov. 8. Prices
have risen 6.6 percent this year.  The Energy Department is scheduled to report last week’s
inventories at 10:30 a.m. today in  Washington . Gasoline
 stockpiles  in the week ended Nov. 25 rose 213,000 to 209.8
million barrels, the highest level in eight weeks, according to
the department.  Demand at the pump last week fell below a year earlier for
the 14th consecutive time last week, down 4 percent from 2010
levels, according to MasterCard Inc.’s SpendingPulse report
yesterday. Measured on a four-week average, consumption was 4.2
percent below a year earlier, the 37th consecutive decline in
that measure.  “Gasoline is continuing its trend with lower demand and
we’ve seen that throughout 2011,” said  Andy Lipow , president of
Lipow Oil Associates LLC in Houston.  Distillate Supplies  Supplies of  distillates  rose 1.68 million barrels last
week, according to API.  Analysts projected the government report may show a
increase of 1.15 million barrels, according to the survey.
 Supplies  of heating and transportation fuels surged 5.53 million
barrels in the week ended Nov. 25, the biggest gain since
January 2009, according to the department.  January-delivery heating oil declined 1.58 cents, or 0.5
percent, to $3.0059 a gallon. Prices have gained 18 percent this
year and peaked at $3.3197 on April 8.  Regular gasoline  at the pump, averaged nationwide, rose 1.1
cent to $3.286 a gallon yesterday, according to AAA data.  To contact the reporter on this story:
