Ferrum Crescent Ltd.  may delay the
first production from its iron ore projects in  South Africa ’s
Limpopo Province as there is no spare rail capacity from the
site of its proposed plant in Lephalale to  Richards Bay ,
Financial Mail said, citing the group’s Chief Operating Officer
Vernon Harvey.  Transnet Freight Rail, South Africa’s rail monopoly, has
indicated there will be no spare capacity on the route in the
immediate future, the Johannesburg-based weekly magazine said.
Ferrum’s first production was expected by about 2017, following
a feasibility study into developing the projects and a three-
year construction period, Harvey was cited as saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
