Ethanol futures declined to the
lowest price in more than 11 months amid ample output and
transportation bottlenecks.  Futures fell after an Energy Department report showed
 production  rose 2.6 percent last week to a record 954,000
barrels a day and  stockpiles  climbed 5.2 percent to 17.9 million
barrels, the highest level since Aug. 19.  “It’s fading here,” said Will Babler, a broker at First
Capitol Risk Management Inc. in Galena,  Illinois . “We’re
running into a little bit of a bottleneck. There’s no shortage
of product.”  Denatured ethanol for January delivery fell 5.6 cents, or
2.6 percent, to $2.125 a gallon on the Chicago Board of Trade,
the lowest price since Dec. 10, 2010. Prices have fallen 11
percent this year.  In cash market trading ethanol in the U.S. Gulf slumped 10
cents, or 3.9 percent, to $2.475 a gallon and in  New York  the
additive dropped 8 cents, or 3.2 percent, to $2.445, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Ethanol in Chicago slid 8 cents, or 3.3 percent, to $2.345
a gallon and on the West Coast the biofuel dropped 2.5 cents, or
1 percent, to $2.50.  Babler said the rush to blend the fuel before a 45-cent tax
credit expires on Dec. 31 increased ethanol demand and that the
absence of a dedicated pipeline is now weighing on prices.  Unlike gasoline, ethanol is delivered to filling stations
via barge, truck or rail.  To contact the reporter on this story:
