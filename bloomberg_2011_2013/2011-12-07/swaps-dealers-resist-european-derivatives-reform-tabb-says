Dealers in  Europe  are resisting
regulatory changes to over-the-counter derivatives because of
the costs of setting up central clearing services, according to
research and advisory firm Tabb Group.  About 70 percent of dealers are lobbying against reforms
while continuing to build out operations, Will Rhode, a senior
research analyst at Tabb in  New York , wrote in a study released
today. The report was based on interviews with 24 swap dealers,
including the European operations of U.S. firms.  Top-tier banks are planning to spend at least $100 million
annually on derivatives reform, while mid-tier firms expect to
spend tens of millions, Tabb said. The global over-the-counter
swaps market is $708 trillion, according to the Basel-based Bank
for International Settlements. Derivatives, including swaps, are
financial contracts tied to  interest rates , currencies or
events, such as a company default.  To contact the reporter on this story:
