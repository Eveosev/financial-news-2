Nigerian banking stocks, led by
 Diamond Bank Plc (DIAMONDB)  and  Fidelity Bank Plc (FIDELITY) , fell the most in two
months as foreign investors exited the market.  The  Bloomberg NSE Banking Index (NGSEB10) , which tracks the
performance of the 10 most capitalized lenders, declined 1.9
percent to 255.52, it’s lowest since at least July 2008, by the
2:30 p.m. close in Lagos. The index is down 36 percent this year
compared with a 21 percent decline in the  Nigerian Stock
Exchange All-Share Index. (NGSEINDX)   “Nigerian banks have cleared most of their non-performing
loans and the issue of recapitalization is over,” Abiola Razaq,
a Lagos-based banking analyst with Vetiva, said by phone today.
“We will continue to see this type of selloff due to investors’
inability to differentiate between the Nigerian banking sector
and others in the  emerging markets .”  A debt crisis in 2008 and 2009 forced the central bank to
fire eight chief executives of the country’s 24 lenders and set
up the Asset Management Corp. of Nigeria, or Amcon, to stabilize
the industry by buying the banks’ bad debts. Amcon has acquired
bad debts worth 3.14 trillion naira ($19.4 billion), chief
executive officer Mustafa Chike-Obi said Nov. 28.  Diamond Bank, which has operations in four other African
countries, fell 4.9 percent to 2.5 naira, its lowest since at
least May 2005. Fidelity Bank dropped 4.7 percent to 1.21 naira,
also the lowest since at least May 2005.  To contact the reporter on this story:
