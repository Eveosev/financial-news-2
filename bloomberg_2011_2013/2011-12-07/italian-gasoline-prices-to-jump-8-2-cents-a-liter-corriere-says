Italian gasoline prices will
immediately rise by 9.9 euro cents a liter under the austerity
package passed this week by the government of Prime Minister
 Mario Monti , Corriere della Sera reported, citing the plan.  Tariffs on unleaded gas will rise 8.2 cents a liter, with
the 21 percent sales tax boosting the total increase at the pump
to almost 10 cents, a more than 5 percent jump over the current
price. The tariffs on diesel will go up 11.2 cents a liter for a
total increase of 13.6 cents a liter after sales tax, Corriere
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
