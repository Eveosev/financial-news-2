The ruble depreciated for a fifth day
against the central bank’s target dollar-euro basket after
hundreds of arrests at anti-government protests late yesterday.  Russia ’s currency lost 0.3 percent to 36.0475 against the
basket at the close in Moscow after dropping 0.3 percent to
41.85 per euro and 31.2999 per dollar. Ruble bonds due July 2015
fell for a second day, pushing the yield up seven basis points,
or 0.07 percentage point, to 7.85 percent.  Police said they detained about 300 people yesterday at an
unsanctioned rally in downtown Moscow to protest the results of
Dec. 4 parliamentary elections.  “We could expect the market perception towards Russia to
be rather negative until the end of the election campaign” in
March, Nikolay Podguzov, head of fixed-income strategy at VTB
Capital in Moscow, said by e-mail. “It’s not about the facts.
Western media prefer to present these kinds of event in Russia
in a most sensational way.”  Investors pared bets the ruble would weaken further against
the dollar, with non-deliverable forwards showing the currency
at 31.7151 per dollar in three months, compared with
expectations of 31.735 per dollar yesterday. The country’s
dollar Eurobond due in 2020 rose, pushing the yield down 25
basis points to 4.419 percent.  Oil, Russia’s main export earner, lost 0.8 percent to
$100.49 a barrel in New York crude futures trading.  To contact the reporter on this story:
