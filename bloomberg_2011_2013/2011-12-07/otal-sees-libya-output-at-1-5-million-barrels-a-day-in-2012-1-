Libya ’s oil output will reach 1.5
million barrels a day by mid-2012, according to the Chief
Executive Officer of Total SA, Christophe de Margerie.  Total has been too pessimistic in its estimates of the
Libyan oil industry’s recovery after the armed conflict in the
North African country, he said today in Doha, Qatar. The Paris-
based company wants to resume all production in Libya and to
explore for new reserves there, de Margerie said.  Total’s production in Libya reached 170,000 barrels a day
at the Murzuk oil field and 40,000 barrels a day at the Al Jurf
field, he said. The company hasn’t resumed production at the
Mabruk crude field, he said.  Libya, holder of Africa’s biggest oil reserves, is
restoring production after output dropped to 45,000 barrels a
day, from 1.6 million barrels, following the rebellion against
then-leader  Muammar Qaddafi  broke out in February. The loss of
exports contributed to a 20 percent increase in Brent crude
prices earlier this year.  BP Plc Chief Executive Officer Robert Dudley and  Peter Voser , CEO of  Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA) , said yesterday that they
aim to resume exploration in Libya. Companies that were already
producing in the North African state, such as Eni SpA,
ConocoPhillips and Repsol YPF SA are poised to boost output.  To contact the reporter on this story:
