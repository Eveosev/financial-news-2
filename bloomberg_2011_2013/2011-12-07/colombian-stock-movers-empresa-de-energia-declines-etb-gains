The following companies are having
unusual price changes in Bogota trading. Stock symbols are in
parentheses and prices are as of 12:24 p.m. local time.  The  IGBC Index (IGBC)  was little changed at 12,661.29, while the
Colcap Index gained 0.5 percent to 1,551.3.  Empresa de Energia de Bogota SA (EEB)  ,  Colombia ’s
second-biggest electricity distributor, sank for a third day
after Bogota’s mayor-elect Gustavo Petro told the daily El
Tiempo he plans a merger with other public companies including
Empresa de Telecomunicaciones de Bogota SA.  Colombia’s securities regulator suspended trading of the
shares for three business days as a preventive measure to
protect investors, “taking into account the behavior that the
shares have had in recent days,” according to an e-mailed
statement.  Petro said today on Twitter that he had already revealed
the plan during his campaign and that his comments didn’t spark
the declines.  EEB, as the city-controlled company is known, fell 3.7
percent to 1,050 pesos before trading was halted. The shares
have fallen 17 percent in three days.  Empresa de Telecomunicaciones de Bogota SA (ETB)  , the
city-run phone company serving Colombia’s capital, gained 4.7
percent to 450 pesos. Investors are reacting positively to
Petro’s merger plan after the initial “panic” has subsided.  “ETB is seeking a strategic partner and clearly the
arrival of a partner like EEB is positive because they have  cash
flow  that ETB doesn’t have,” said Santiago Melo, analyst at
Alianza Valores, “ETB is the big winner in this.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
