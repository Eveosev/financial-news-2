OAO Uralkali (URKA) , Russia’s biggest
fertilizer maker, may produce 11.3 million to 11.8 million
metric tons of potash next year as global sales reach a record,
Chief Executive Officer Vladislav Baumgertner said.  Global sales may reach 59 million to 60 million tons next
year from this year’s 58 million tons, Baumgertner told
reporters today on a conference call.  “We are able to produce as much as 12.5 million tons of
potash next year, but the global market increase will be too
small for this,” he said.  The spot price for potash is unlikely to rise in the first
quarter due to instability on all markets, Baumgertner said.
“We think spot prices may change only after contracts with
India and  China  are signed,” he said.  Uralkali (URKA)  plans to sign
new contracts with China in April or May, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
