Egypt ’s state-owned banks cut their
holdings of Treasury bills by 17 percent in September, the
biggest decline this year, according to  central bank data .  The banks reduced their holdings to 89 billion Egyptian
pounds ($14.8 billion), from 107 billion pounds in August,  data
on the central bank’s website show.  State-owned banks increased their purchases of Treasury
bills after this year’s popular revolt that toppled President
 Hosni Mubarak  prompted foreign investors to sell Egyptian
assets.  Privately owned lenders increased their Treasury-bill
holdings in September to 107 billion pounds from 102 billion
pounds in August, according to the data.  To contact the reporter on this story:
