Workers in Cyprus’s public sector
will hold a three-hour strike next week to protest government
plans to curb public spending, which include a two-year wage
freeze, a union official said.  “We disagree with and are displeased over the way
decisions on fiscal consolidation were taken as they did not
include consultations with the trade unions,” Sotiris Fellas,
deputy secretary general of  PEO , a trade union affiliated with
the ruling communist party  AKEL , said in an interview.  Around 50,000 civil servants, teachers and other workers in
state-owned companies will participate in the strike on Dec. 15
from 10 a.m., Fellas said. Strikers will march to the parliament
where lawmakers will be voting on the 2012 budget aimed at
cutting the budget deficit to less than 2.8 percent of gross
domestic product from 6 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
