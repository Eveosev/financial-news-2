International Business Machines Corp. (IBM) 
will reach a settlement with European Union antitrust regulators
next week to end a probe into mainframe software, according to
two people familiar with the matter.  The European Commission intends to accept an offer made by
IBM in September to resolve a dispute over anti-competitive
behaviour that may have blocked rival mainframe software makers,
said the people who couldn’t be identified because the talks are
private.  Regulators have sought comments from rivals and customers
on IBM’s commitments to ensure the availability of certain spare
parts and technical information. The Brussels-based regulator
 closed a separate probe  over IBM’s mainframe computers after
three competitors dropped complaints.  The commission in 2010 opened investigations into Armonk,
New York-based IBM over possible anti-competitive behavior that
may have blocked competitors in mainframe software and
maintenance contracts by “restricting or delaying access to
spare parts.”  Joe Hanley, a spokesman for IBM in  London , declined to
comment. Amelia Torres, a spokeswoman for the commission, didn’t
immediately respond to a call and e-mail seeking comment.  Reuters reported the settlement earlier today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
