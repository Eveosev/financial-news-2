Cenovus Energy Inc. (CVE) , the oil producer
spun off by Encana Corp. in 2009, said  cash flow  will decline 4
percent in 2012 as the company spends more to boost production at
its oil-sands operations.  Cash flow next year will be between C$2.9 billion ($2.87
billion) and C$3.5 billion, the company said in a statement today.
Investment will surge 23 percent, while production gains 21
percent, the company said.  Production at the company’s Christina Lake operations will
more than double as Cenovus invests in new well pads that use
steam to melt bitumen underground. Cash flow will be held back by
the company’s refining and natural-gas businesses.  Cenovus, based in Calgary, expects production growth of 10
percent to 15 percent over the next “several” years, Brian Ferguson, chief executive officer, told investors today at a
conference. The company has based its expectations for  oil prices 
between $80 and $90 a barrel, he said in October.  Shares of Cenovus rose 2.5 percent to C$33.89 at the close in
Toronto.  To contact the reporter on this story:
