MoneyGram International Inc (MGI)  expanded
its money-transfer services in  Serbia  as it agreed on
cooperation with the units of  Piraeus Bank SA (TPEIR) ,  EFG Eurobank
Ergasias SA (EUROB) ,  AIK Banka AD (AIKB) , Privredna Banka AD, and  Credy Banka
AD. (CYBN)   Doubling the number of branches that offer its services to
632 will support MoneyGram’s “consistently double-digit
growth” in the Balkan country where cash-to-cash transfers from
expatriates are around $500 million a year,  Regional Director
Marietta Doxopoulou said at a news conference today in Belgrade.  MoneyGram entered the market in 2008 and sees it as “still
at an immature stage, with a lot of potential,” she said.  Total remittances from the Serbian diaspora are around $5.5
billion a year, according to government estimates. MoneyGram
already works in Serbia with Agrobanka AD and the local units of
 Oesterreichische Volksbanken AG (VBPS)  and  Alpha Bank AE. (ALPHA)   To contact the reporter on this story:
