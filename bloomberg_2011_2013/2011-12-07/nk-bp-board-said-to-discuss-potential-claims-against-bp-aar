The board of TNK-BP, the Russian oil
venture owned by BP and a group of billionaires, will discuss
potential claims against the shareholders at meeting on Dec. 9,
three people with knowledge of the agenda said.  TNK-BP received a report from two law firms on potential
claims it may file against BP arising from the U.K. explorer’s
failed alliance with state-owned OAO Rosneft,  Russia ’s biggest
oil producer, according to the people.  The directors will also look at a possible case against
billionaire  Viktor Vekselberg ’s Renova Group, one of the
companies that make up AAR, owner of the other half of TNK-BP,
the people said.  TNK-BP’s press service declined to comment.  To contact the reporters on this story:
