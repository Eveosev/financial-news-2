Alere Inc.’s (ALR)  $250 million term loan
rose in initial trading after the provider of health management
services raised the funding to refinance debt.  The loan, due in June 2017, began trading at 98 cents on
the dollar, according to data provider Markit Ltd. The financing
was sold to investors at 97.5 cents, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg.  GE Capital Markets, the lending unit of General Electric
Co., Jefferies Group Inc. and Credit Suisse Group AG arranged
the deal for Waltham, Massachusetts-based Alere, Bloomberg data
show. The loan pays interest at 3.5 percentage points more than
the London interbank offered rate, with a 1 percent floor on the
benchmark.  In a revolving credit facility, money can be borrowed again
once it’s repaid; in a term loan, it can’t.  To contact the reporter on this story:
