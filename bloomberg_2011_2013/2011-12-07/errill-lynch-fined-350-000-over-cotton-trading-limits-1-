Merrill Lynch Commodities Inc.  agreed
to pay a $350,000 fine to settle charges that it exceeded
speculative position limits in cotton futures, the U.S.
Commodity Futures Trading Commission said.  The violations occurred from Jan. 31 to Feb. 3, the CFTC
said today in an e-mailed statement. Merrill’s net short
positions of 5,502 contracts on Jan. 31 and 6,059 on Feb. 1
surpassed the 5,000-contract limit for all months, the CFTC
said. A net short position in March 2011 futures was 227 above
the 3,500-contract maximum for any single month.  Cotton futures on ICE Futures U.S. in New York rose 4.3
percent during the four-day period.  “We’re pleased to resolve this matter,” said  Bill Halldin , a spokesman for Charlotte, North Carolina-based  Bank of
America Corp. (BAC) , which purchased Merrill Lynch & Co. in 2009.
“This was unintentional, and to prevent a recurrence in the
future we have strengthened our position-limit monitoring
system,” Halldin said in a telephone interview.  To contact the reporter on this story:
