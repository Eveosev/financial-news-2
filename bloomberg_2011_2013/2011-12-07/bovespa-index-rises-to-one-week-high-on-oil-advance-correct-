(Corrects story originally published on Nov. 16 to remove
reference to office location in eighth paragraph.)  The  Bovespa (IBOV)  stock index advanced to
a one-week high as crude prices jumped and traders added to
wagers for lower Brazilian  interest rates .  Oil companies  OGX Petroleo & Gas Participacoes SA  and
 Petroleo Brasileiro SA  contributed the most to the index’s gain.
 JBS SA , the world’s biggest beef producer, surged to the highest
since May after saying it may sell U.S. assets to cut debt. The
Bovespa’s advance was limited by an 8.5 percent plunge in
homebuilder Gafisa SA after third-quarter profits fell.  The Bovespa rose 0.5 percent to 58,559.99 at the close in
Sao Paulo, the highest since Nov. 8. Forty-three stocks rose on
the index while 24 fell. The real weakened 0.2 percent to 1.7701
per dollar.  “The reversal in oil is what’s moving the market,” said
Mirela Rappaport, who helps manage about 160 million reais
($90.4 million) at Investport in  Sao Paulo . “Our view is that
the market is cheap. Rates are coming down. It’s bad news out of
 Europe  that’s holding it back.”  Oil in  New York  climbed above $100 a barrel to a five-month
high as Enbridge Inc. said it would reverse the direction of the
Seaway pipeline, opening an outlet for crude from the central
U.S. and  Canada . Crude futures rose 3.1 percent, after falling
as much as 1 percent earlier today.  The yield on the Brazilian interest-rate futures contract
due in January 2013 dropped one basis point, or 0.01 percentage
point, to 9.94 percent, indicating traders expect the central
bank to make deeper cuts in borrowing costs.  OGX, JBS  State-controlled Petrobras advanced 0.9 percent to 22.11
reais while billionaire  Eike Batista ’s OGX gained 1.5 percent to
14.04 reais.  JBS, based in Sao Paulo, may sell idled plants in the U.S.
and office buildings that previously belonged to Pilgrim’s
Pride, Chief Executive Officer Wesley Batista told analysts
today on an earnings conference call. The stock jumped 6.5
percent to 5.75 reais.  The benchmark equity gauge earlier dropped as much as 0.8
percent, led by homebuilders. The  BM&FBovespa Real Estate Index (IMOBBV) 
lost 1 percent.  Gafisa slumped 52 centavos to 5.60 reais after it said
third-quarter net income plunged 60 percent from a year earlier
to 46.2 million reais. Gafisa also cut its forecast for new
projects this year to a range of 3.5 billion reais to 4 billion
reais, from a previous range of 5 billion reais to 5.6 billion
reais.  Rival  MRV Engenharia & Participacoes SA  declined 0.3
percent to 11.11 reais after it reported a third-quarter profit
of 216 million reais, down 3.4 percent from a year earlier.  Index Valuation  Brazil ’s benchmark equity gauge dropped on Nov. 14 after
economists cut their Brazil forecasts amid Europe’s debt
turmoil. The market was closed yesterday for a national holiday.  The Bovespa trades at about 10.5 times analysts’ earnings
estimates, in line with the ratio for MSCI Inc.’s gauge of 21
developing nations’ equities, weekly data compiled by Bloomberg
show.  Traders moved 3.8 billion reais in stocks in Sao Paulo on
Nov. 14, data compiled by Bloomberg show. That compares with a

according to data from the exchange.  To contact the reporter on this story:
