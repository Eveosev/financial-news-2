New York Giants offensive tackle
Stacy Andrews was placed on injured reserve and will miss the
final four games of the National Football League season after
being diagnosed with blood clots in his lungs.  Andrews, 30, was taken to a hospital on Dec. 3 after two
days of spitting up blood and experiencing pain in his ribs,
NFL.com said. The 6-foot-6, 318-pound Andrews didn’t play in the
Giants’ game the next day against the  Green Bay Packers .  The Giants’ medical staff said the blood clots are believed
to have originated in Andrews’s legs. They may have been caused
by long airplane flights, a recent back injury or a hit in
practice.  The Giants signed tackle Tony Ugoh to replace Andrews, who
played in nine of the team’s first 11 games and made three
starts. The 6-foot-5, 304-pound Ugoh was Indianapolis’s second-
round draft pick in 2007 and played with the Colts and  Detroit
Lions  from 2007 to 2010. He most recently played with the United
Football League’s Las Vegas Locomotives.  At 6-6, the Giants are one game behind first-place  Dallas 
in the  National Football Conference ’s East division and visit
the Cowboys this week.  To contact the reporter on this story:
