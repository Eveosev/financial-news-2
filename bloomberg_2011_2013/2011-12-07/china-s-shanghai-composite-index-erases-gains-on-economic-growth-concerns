China’s stocks erased earlier gains
on concern government measures to slow growth will hurt earnings
and curb demand for raw materials and consumer goods.  The Shanghai Composite Index lost 0.3 percent to 2,318.85
at 10:59 a.m., reversing a 0.6 percent advance. Financial
companies and materials producers led declines.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
