Sugar futures tumbled the most in 11
weeks on renewed concern that Europe will fail to contain its
fiscal crisis, dimming demand prospects for commodities. Coffee
also dropped.  The Standard & Poor’s 500  Index (SPX)  of equities fell as much as
1.1 percent after a German government official said the country
is pessimistic about the outcome of this week’s EU debt summit.
The S&P’s GSCI gauge of 24 raw materials dropped as much as 1.4
percent. Sugar futures have plunged 28 percent this year amid
rising supplies and dwindling demand.  “The weaker outside markets are weighing on” sugar,
Sterling Smith, an analyst at Country Hedging in  St. Paul ,
 Minnesota , said in a telephone interview.  Raw sugar for March delivery slumped 4.7 percent to settle
at 23.05 cents a pound at 2 p.m. on ICE Futures U.S. in  New
York , the biggest drop for a most-active contract since Sept.
16.  A mounting crisis in  Europe  will mean “less trading
finance and a worsening macroeconomic scenario,” Arnaldo Correa, a partner at Sao Paulo-based Archer Consulting, said in
an e-mail.  The European Union issued licenses to export almost 700,000
metric tons of sugar in the season that started in October.
Applications were made to export 1.29 million tons.  Arabica-coffee futures for March delivery fell 2.5 percent
to $2.2985 a pound in New York. The price has dropped 4.4
percent this year after surging 77 percent in 2010.  In London futures trading, refined sugar and robusta coffee
also declined on NYSE Liffe.  To contact the reporter on this story:
