Banco de Credito del Peru (BAP) , the Andean
country’s largest lender, agreed today to create an investment
banking division less than a week after announcing an expansion
into  Colombia ’s financial services market.  Christian Laub, who’s in charge of corporate and investment
lending at the Lima-based bank, will head the new division,
Banco de Credito said in a regulatory filing.  Banco de Credito said Dec. 1 it will acquire a 51 percent
stake in Colombian brokerage Correval to expand its corporate
finance and brokerage business.  In separate statements, Jorge Mujica was named chief
executive officer of the bank’s Bolivian unit while the lender’s
parent company Credicorp Ltd. appointed Juan Inchaustegui chief
executive officer of its Panama unit.  To contact the reporter on this story:
