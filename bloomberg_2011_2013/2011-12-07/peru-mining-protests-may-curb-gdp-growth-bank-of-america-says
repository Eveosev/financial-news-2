Protests that forced Newmont Mining
Corp. to suspend investment in its Minas Conga gold mine in  Peru 
last week risk curtailing economic growth, Bank of America said.  A halt in all new mining investment would shave an average
2.9 percentage points off of Peruvian growth in 2012 and 2013,
the bank said today in an e-mailed report to clients. Fiscal
revenue would be 17 percent less than forecast in 2016 if 11
large mining projects in the pipeline fail to come on stream,
Bank of America said.  Defections by members of the ruling Gana Peru party opposed
to President  Ollanta Humala â€™s pro-business stance may eventually
push his government toward less market-friendly policies and
threaten growth, the bank said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
