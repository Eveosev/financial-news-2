Bank of Montreal (BMO)  was downgraded by
five analysts after Canada’s fourth-largest bank reported
results that missed analysts’ estimates.  The Toronto-based bank’s ratings were cut to “hold” from
‘’buy” by Canaccord Genuity analyst Mario Mendonca and
Desjardins Capital analyst Michael Goldberg; to “sector
perform” from ‘’outperform” by RBC Capital Markets analyst
Andre-Philippe Hardy; to “sell’ from “buy” by Ohad Lederer at
Veritas Investment Research Co. and to ‘’sector underperformer”
from ‘’sector performer” by CIBC World Markets analyst Robert Sedran.  Bank of Montreal was the first Canadian bank to miss
fourth-quarter estimates yesterday, reporting adjusted profit of
C$1.27 a share, short of the C$1.31-a-share average estimate of
16 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  “Revenue growth in Canadian retail banking is at the low
end of the peer group,” said RBC’s Hardy in a note to investors
today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
