Facebook Inc., the biggest social-
networking company, is working to fix a security flaw that let
people view other users’ private photos, including those of
Chief Executive Officer  Mark Zuckerberg .  The bug enabled anyone to view a “limited number” of
recently uploaded photos, regardless of a person’s privacy
settings, the company said in an e-mailed statement. Facebook
shut the affected system after becoming aware of the bug and
will restore it after the glitch is fixed. Photos of Zuckerberg
were published anonymously on the Web, reports said.  “The privacy of our user’s data is a top priority for us,
and we invest significant resources in protecting our site and
the people who use it,” the  Palo Alto , California-based company
said in a statement.  Facebook, which has more than 800 million users, is taking
steps to improve privacy after agreeing last month to settle
complaints by the Federal Trade Commission that it failed to
protect user data or disclose how it could be used. In a blog
posting at the time, Zuckerberg said the company should have
been more vigilant in protecting users’ privacy and that
Facebook had made “a bunch of mistakes.”  Blogs including Cnet’s ZDnet  posted  photos from
Zuckerberg’s personal collection.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
