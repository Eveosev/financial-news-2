Global attempts to curb  greenhouse
gases  through legal treaties are likely to fade in favor of
voluntary actions,  Abby Joseph Cohen ,  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) ’s
senior U.S. investment strategist, said in a research note to
clients.  Negotiators from more than 190 countries at United Nations-
led climate talks in Durban, South Africa, aren’t likely to
agree on how to forge a new legally binding accord to replace
the existing Kyoto Protocol, Joseph Cohen, the Goldman Sachs
strategist known for predicting the 1990s  bull market , wrote.  “Instead, we expect to see a further transition to a
global climate change process that focuses on voluntary national
pledges and international support through financing and
technology transfer,” according to the note.  To contact the reporter on this story:
