Rogers & Co. Ltd. (ROGERS) , Mauritius’s
biggest diversified company by market value, said profit for the
12 months through September fell 37 percent from a year earlier
as losses at its hotel operations widened.  Net income dropped to 393.1 million rupees ($13.4 million)
from 620 million rupees, the company said in a  statement  on the
Stock Exchange of Mauritius’s website today. Earnings per share
declined to 15.60 rupees from 24.61 rupees, even as revenue rose
9 percent to 10.4 billion rupees, it said.  “The operations of the group will be challenged by the
continued weakness that is set to prevail in our principal
markets,” Port-Louis-based Rogers said in the statement.  After-tax losses in the hotel division widened 23 percent
to 343 million rupees and the business will not return to
profitability in 2012, the company said. Tourism is one of
Mauritius’s biggest earners of foreign currency and  Europe ,
currently in the grip of a debt crisis, accounted for 63 percent
of visitors in the 10 months through October, according to
Statistics Mauritius.  Rogers was unchanged at 325 rupees at the close on the
Stock Exchange of Mauritius. The stock, which has a 4.8 percent
weighting in the 38-member  SEMDEX (SEMDEX)  index, has gained 11 percent
this year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
