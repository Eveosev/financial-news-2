French President  Nicolas Sarkozy  and
German Chancellor  Angela Merkel  proposed amending European
treaties to tighten rules on deficit spending and water down
provisions demanding investor losses.  In a joint letter to European Union President Herman Van Rompuy, the French and German leaders said they want a decision
at an EU summit starting tomorrow so that the measures can be
ready by March 2012.  The new treaty should call for “automatic consequences”
for euro-zone members with deficits over 3 percent of their
economic output. The treaty should “make clear that Greece
required a unique and exceptional solution” and that other
euro-area members “reaffirm their inflexible determination to
honor fully their own individual sovereign signature.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
