OAO Uralkali,  Russia ’s biggest
fertilizer maker by value, reported third-quarter net revenue of
$1.04 billion after taking over rival OAO Silvinit.  The domestic at-the-mine price averaged $219 a metric ton
in the period. Potash for export was sold on average at $376 a
ton excluding transportation costs, the company said today in a
statement, without providing comparisons for the year earlier.  Global potash demand and prices aren’t expected to decline
below current levels next year, Uralkali said after raising
prices for Brazil and  Southeast Asia . Chinese and U.S. demand
may increase, the company said. Brazilian customers, “cautious
about accepting the new price” of $580 a ton, have delayed
purchases until the first quarter, according to the statement.  European farmers may face borrowing difficulties because of
the credit crisis and the market will probably remain “at the
current level” until the economy improves,  Uralkali (URKA)  said.  The company declined 0.8 percent to 226.29 rubles by 6:38
p.m. in Moscow trading, while Uralkali’s depositary receipts
dropped 1.1 percent to $36.10 in London.  To contact the reporter on this story:
