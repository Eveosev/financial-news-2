Red Sox  designated hitter  David Ortiz 
plans today to accept a team offer of salary arbitration that
will keep him in  Boston  next season, ESPN reported, quoting a
person aware of the decision who requested anonymity.  Ortiz, 36, who hit .309 with 29 home runs and 96 runs
batted this past season, has until 11:59 p.m. Boston time to
agree to a one-year deal and decline free agency. The amount of
his contract would be determined in an arbitration hearing.  Ortiz, whose salary was $12.5 million in 2011, has been
seeking a multiyear contract from the Red Sox. The two sides
still could negotiate such a deal if Ortiz accepts arbitration.  Red Sox manager  Bobby Valentine  traveled to the Dominican
Republic on Dec. 2, a day after he was introduced at Boston’s
Fenway Park as the team’s new manager, to visit Ortiz at his
charity golf tournament, team spokesman Pam Ganley confirmed
yesterday in an e-mail.  A seven-time All-Star who has finished among the top five
in American League Most Valuable Player voting in five of his
nine seasons with the Red Sox, Ortiz has 378 home runs in 15
Major League Baseball seasons with Minnesota and Boston.  “If there’s a way to make it work, we’d like to have him
on the team moving forward and potentially have him finish his
career with the Red Sox,” General Manager Ben Cherington told
reporters yesterday at baseball’s Winter Meetings in Dallas.  To contact the reporter on this story:
