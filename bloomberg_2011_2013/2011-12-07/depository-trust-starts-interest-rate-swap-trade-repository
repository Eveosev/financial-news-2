The Depository Trust & Clearing Corp.
said it started a global trade repository for over-the-counter
interest-rate swaps.  The warehouse is based in  London  and holds data from 15 of
the largest global dealers, DTCC said in a statement. The
company already runs global repositories for equity derivatives
and credit-default swaps, and is planning initiatives in over-
the-counter foreign exchange and commodities derivatives
markets.  The repository is part of the financial industry’s efforts
to fulfill obligations under the U.S. Dodd-Frank Act and
proposed European Market Infrastructure Regulation legislation,
DTCC said. Regulators are seeking greater transparency in
derivatives markets, which they’ve blamed for exacerbating
financial crises.  “The credit derivatives market is highly concentrated, but
only so big,” Stewart Macbeth, president and chief executive
officer of DTCC Deriv/SERV LLC, said in an interview. “The
reach of the rates market is far deeper and wider.”  Derivatives are financial instruments derived from stocks,
bonds, loans, currencies and commodities, or linked to specific
events like changes in  interest rates  or the weather. So-called
over-the-counter derivatives aren’t traded on exchanges.  To contact the reporter on this story:
