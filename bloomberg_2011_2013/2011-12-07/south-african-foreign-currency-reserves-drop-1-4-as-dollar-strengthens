South African gross gold and foreign
currency reserves fell for the second time in three months in
November as a stronger dollar cut the value of euros and pounds
held by the central bank.  Gross reserves  dropped 1.4 percent to $49.7 billion, the
Pretoria-based Reserve Bank said on its website today. The
median estimate in a Bloomberg survey of nine economists was for
reserves to rise to $50.5 billion.  Net reserves  declined to
$48.6 billion from $49.22 billion.  The dollar strengthened against 15 of the 16 major
currencies tracked by Bloomberg in November as a worsening
European debt crisis prompted investors to sell higher-risk,
emerging market assets for the U.S. currency and gold.  “The decrease in gross reserves was primarily due to the
appreciation of the  U.S. dollar  against other major currencies
which led to a sizable downward valuation adjustment in the
foreign exchange reserves,” the central bank said.  The  Reserve Bank  has slowed the pace of dollar purchases
this year to avoid adding to the rand’s weakness after the
currency fell 17 percent against the dollar, the worst performer
amongst major currencies. The rand gained 0.3 percent to 8.0051
per dollar as of 8:29 a.m. in Johannesburg today.  Gold reserves, which accounts for about 14 percent of gross
holdings at the central bank, fell by $22 million to $6.9
billion, the bank said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
