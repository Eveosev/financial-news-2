The yuan approached the weaker end of
its permitted trading range for a sixth day on speculation
policy makers will slow currency appreciation as inflation eases.  The People’s Bank of China set the daily  reference rate 
0.01 percent lower at 6.3342 per dollar. That was almost 0.5
percent stronger than the currency’s close yesterday.  Inflation 
slowed to 4.5 percent in November from a year earlier, the least
in 13 months, according to the median estimate of economists
surveyed by Bloomberg before data due Dec. 9.  “The PBOC fixing is still too strong for investors to
digest,” said Edmond Law, deputy head of foreign-exchange at
BWC Capital Markets in  Hong Kong . “With inflation easing and
the need for dollars increasing toward year-end, the yuan spot
rate will continue to face downside pressure.”  The yuan closed at 6.3643 per dollar in  Shanghai , little
changed from yesterday’s 6.3642, according to the  China  Foreign
Exchange Trade System. It earlier touched 6.3659, the weaker end
of its trading range. The currency is allowed to fluctuate as
much as 0.5 percent on either side of the PBOC’s  fixing .  The yuan’s exchange rate may be approaching an equilibrium,
 Li Yang , a former adviser to China’s central bank, said at a
briefing today. Li expects the nation’s monetary policy next
year to have a neutral to a slightly loose bias.  In Hong Kong’s offshore market, the yuan gained 0.09
percent to 6.3735 per dollar. Twelve-month non-deliverable
forwards rose 0.02 percent to 6.3840, a 0.3 percent discount to
the onshore spot rate.  The yuan’s offshore rate strengthened, along with other
Asian currencies, after the Financial Times reported that  Europe 
is working to increase the amount of funds available to the
region’s most-indebted nations.  To contact the reporter on this story:
