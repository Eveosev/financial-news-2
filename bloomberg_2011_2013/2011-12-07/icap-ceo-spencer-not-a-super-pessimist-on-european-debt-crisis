ICAP Plc (IAP)  Chief Executive Officer
 Michael Spencer  comments on efforts to curb the euro debt crisis
and  Greece . Spencer spoke in an interview at ICAP during a
charity fund-raising event in his London offices.  On efforts to control the region’s debt crisis and whether
Greece should leave the euro region:  “I’m not a member of the super-pessimist club. I think
there is the will and the capacity for them to reach a
sufficient agreement where the euro will hold together. I don’t
believe the euro will fall apart. We need this for the economy,
not only for the U.K., but globally.”  “Personally, I think it would be in Greece’s own interest
to leave the euro. It’s my personal opinion, and I appreciate
there are those who disagree with that, but I think they face a
long, long recession if they remain within the euro, whereas if
they leave the euro there would admittedly be a very painful
adjustment, but it would be short and it would be sharp.”  On European Union plans for a financial-transaction tax:  “The financial-transaction tax is a deeply bad economic
idea by the way. Certainly, the City of  London  would be
decimated by the financial-transaction tax and there is no
question of whether the U.K. should have anything to do with it
at all. I am against it.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
