HTC Corp. (2498)  declined to the lowest in
17 months in Taipei trading after consolidated sales fell 20
percent in November from a year earlier.  The stock dropped 6.6 percent to NT$428, the lowest level
since July 5, 2010, at the close. The benchmark Taiex index rose
1.1 percent. The trading volume of 18 million shares was almost
double the three-month daily average, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg.  HTC’s consolidated revenue fell to NT$30.9 billion
($1 billion) in November, according to an e-mailed statement
yesterday. The smartphone maker, based in Taoyuan,  Taiwan , cut
its fourth-quarter revenue forecast last month amid the slow
global economy, increased competition and lawsuits by  Apple Inc. (AAPL)   “HTC’s product offering is no longer ahead of its global
peers, which is leading to muted shipments growth and market
share decline in coming quarters,” said Richard Ko, an analyst
at KGI Securities Co. He cut the share price target to NT$530
from NT$740 on Nov. 24 and maintained a “neutral” rating on
the stock.  Revenue this quarter will be little changed from a year
earlier, compared with an earlier forecast for growth of about
20 percent to 30 percent, HTC said Nov. 23.  The International Trade Commission is set to rule Dec. 14
in a patent complaint lodged by Apple against HTC. The decision
was postponed from the original date of Dec. 6. A ruling for
Apple may lead to a ban on U.S. imports of HTC devices.  To contact the reporter on this story:
