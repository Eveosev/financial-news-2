Silver usage in solar panels has been
“cut back substantially” in response to higher prices this
year, according to UBS AG.  “We still do not rule out another attempt at $50 an ounce
in 2012, but it takes a brave investor to stomach what can only
be a nerve-wracking, bumpy ride,” the bank said today in an e-
mailed report.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
