Industrial Bank of Korea (024110)  signed a $50
million loan with Australia & New Zealand Banking Group Ltd. and
Standard Chartered Plc, said a person familiar with the matter.  ANZ committed $20 million and Standard Chartered is lending
$30 million, said the person, who asked not to be identified
because the details are private.  The loan pays an all-in, which includes margins and fees,
of about 150 basis points over the London interbank offered rate
and is being borrowed by the bankâ€™s Tokyo branch, the person
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
