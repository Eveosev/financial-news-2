The German government may force banks
to accept state financing in certain cases as part of its
revived Soffin bank-rescue fund,  Handelsblatt  said.  Germany ’s BaFin financial regulator might make it necessary
for banks unable to raise capital on the markets to accept
government funding, the newspaper reported, citing a draft of
the law that may be approved by  Chancellor Angela Merkel ’s
Cabinet next week.  To contact the reporter on this story:
