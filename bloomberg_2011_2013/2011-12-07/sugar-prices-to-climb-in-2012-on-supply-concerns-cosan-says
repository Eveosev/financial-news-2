Sugar prices will rise next year as
record production in  Brazil  and  Russia  isn’t expected to exceed
demand, said  Cosan SA Industria & Comercio , which jointly
controls the world’s largest sugar-cane processor with  Royal
Dutch Shell Plc. (RDSA)   “An output recovery in Brazil and Russia doesn’t mean we
will have enough sugar to surpass global demand by a large
margin,” Cosan Chief Financial Officer Marcelo Martins told
reporters today in Sao Paulo. “We see a tight scenario and are
bullish on sugar prices.”  Brazil’s Center South, the world’s largest producing
region, will have a record 34 million tons of sugar output next
year, up from 30.8 million tons this year, Copersucar SA said
Nov. 23. Output in Russia, the world’s seventh-largest producer
of the sweetener, will be a record 5 million tons of sugar this
crop year, which runs from October 2011 to September 2012,
German research firm F.O. Licht said Dec. 5.  Cosan cut next year’s hedging strategy based on its sugar-
price forecast, Martins said. The company, based in  Sao Paulo ,
is hedging about 25 percent of next year’s sugar exports against
a price fluctuation, less than the average of at least 30
percent in previous years, he said.  Raw sugar for March delivery fell 4.8 percent to 23.01
cents a pound at 12:18 p.m. on ICE Futures U.S. in  New York ,
heading for the biggest drop since Sept. 16.  To contact the reporter on this story:
