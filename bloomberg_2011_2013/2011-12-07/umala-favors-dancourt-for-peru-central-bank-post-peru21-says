Peruvian President  Ollanta Humala 
favors economist Oscar Dancourt as his party’s representative on
the board of the country’s central bank, Peru21  reported , citing
parliamentary officials it didn’t name.  Humala wants his party to propose Dancourt because of his
experience as a former central bank president, the Lima-based
newspaper said.  Talks within Congress to choose three central bank
directors have stalled and will resume in the coming days,
Peru21 said, citing Luis Galarreta, who heads the parliament’s
economy panel.  The party led by former president Alejandro Toledo has
chosen  Francisco Gonzalez  as its candidate to sit on the central
bank board, the newspaper reported. Elmer Cuba and former
economy minister Eduardo Moron may be proposed by the other main
parties in congress, Peru21 said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
