Taiwan ’s dollar advanced, halting
three-day decline, as optimism European leaders will step up
efforts to resolve the region’s debt crisis bolstered sentiment
toward emerging-market assets.  Overseas funds bought $363 million more Taiwanese stocks
than they sold so far this week, according to exchange data.
 Government bonds  were little changed before official data due
tomorrow that economists predict will show export growth slowed
last month.  “Today is a little bit better in terms of risk
sentiment,” said Andy Ji, a Singapore-based currency strategist
at Commonwealth Bank of  Australia . “Asian currencies, including
the  Taiwan dollar , may still depreciate in the next two quarters
because of outflows from the region as European banks scramble
to recapitalize.”  Taiwan’s dollar climbed 0.2 percent to NT$30.168 against
its U.S. counterpart at the close, according to Taipei Forex Inc.
The currency touched NT$30.505 on Nov. 25, the weakest level
since Oct. 12.  Europe  may combine temporary and permanent rescue
facilities to bolster its bailout resources, the Financial Times
reported. The region’s leaders will hold a summit in Brussels on
Dec. 8 and Dec. 9.  Taiwan’s exports rose 8.6 percent in November from a year
earlier after having increased 11.7 percent the prior month,
according to the median estimate of economists in a Bloomberg
News survey before the finance ministry data.  The yield on the 2 percent bonds due July 2016 was 0.992
percent, compared with 0.989 percent yesterday, according to
Gretai Securities Market.  To contact the reporter on this story:
