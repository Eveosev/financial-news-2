Carrefour SA (CA) ’s board cleared a plan
to bid for French franchiser  Guyenne et Gascogne SA (GG) , bowing to
pressure from shareholder funds including First Eagle and
Tocqueville Finance, Les Echos reported.  The four funds, which together hold about 40 percent of
Guyenne, are threatening to partner with French rival Auchan if
Carrefour doesn’t buy their stake, the newspaper said without
citing sources.  Carrefour may sell its stake in Altis, a smaller French
franchiser, to make up for spending on Guyenne at a time when
the retailer would rather invest in fast-growing markets,
according to the report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
