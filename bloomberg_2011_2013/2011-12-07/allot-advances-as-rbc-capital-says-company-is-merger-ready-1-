Allot Communications Ltd.  rose for
the third time this week after  RBC Capital Markets  said the
technology company may be an acquisition target.  The shares gained 2.6 percent to 65.28 shekels, or the
equivalent of $17.42, at the 4:30 close in  Tel Aviv  after rising
as much as 5.4 percent earlier in the day. The  U.S.-traded
shares (ALLT)  rose 4.7 percent to $17.73 yesterday and fell 0.7 percent
to $17.61 at 5:52 p.m. in Tel Aviv.  “The company’s strong balance sheet should now be
sufficient to adequately support strategic mergers and
acquisitions that can broaden the company’s offering,” Daniel
Meron, an analyst at RBC in Tel Aviv, wrote in an e-mailed
report yesterday.  Allot shares will probably rise to $20 in the next 12
months, up from a previous estimate of $18, RBC said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
