Latvia may reach agreement with
international lenders to end a 7.5 billion-euro ($10.1 billion)
lending program this week, Prime Minister Valdis Dombrovskis
said.  “I think talks will be closed this week,” said
Dombrovskis on the  Latvian Independent Television  program 900
Seconds today. Talks have been delayed due to the liquidation of
Latvijas Krajbanka AS, the sixth-biggest deposit bank, said
Dombrovskis.  Latvia turned to a group led by the European Commission and
the  International Monetary Fund  for a loan in late 2008 after
the country’s second-biggest bank needed a state rescue and a
real estate boom turned bust. The government submitted the 2012
budget to parliament yesterday which plans to lower the deficit
to 2.5 percent of gross domestic product next year so the
country can qualify for euro adoption two years later.  Dombrovskis rejected criticism from Latvian Central Bank
Governor Ilmars Rimsevics who yesterday said a growth estimate
of 2.5 percent used in next year’s budget is “too optimistic.”  “I can’t agree with this evaluation,” said Dombrovskis
today. “This macroeconomic estimate for which the budget is
based on was also coordinated with the Latvian central bank.”  Including next year’s budget measures, Latvia will have
passed spending cuts and tax increases of 2.3 billion lati ($4.4
billion), or 17.8 percent of GDP, since 2008, Finance Minister
Andris Vilks told a news conference on Dec. 5.  To contact the reporter on this story:
