Gustavo Petro, mayor-elect of
 Colombia ’s capital, denied on Twitter that his comments caused
this week’s plunge in shares of  Empresa de Energia de Bogota SA (EEB) 
and vowed to defend the city-controlled company with his life
against “speculative” private interests.  EEB, as country’s second-biggest electricity distributor is
known, fell 3.7 percent to 1,050 pesos at 10:57 a.m. in Bogota.
Shares have fallen 17 percent in the three days since Petro
questioned the company’s investments in  Peru  and detailed plans
to merge EEB with the city-controlled telecommunications and
sewage and water companies in a Dec. 2 interview with El Tiempo.
Colombia’s IGBC benchmark index dropped 3.6 percent in that same
period.  Petro said he had already laid out his merger plan during
his campaign and that the share decline was caused by external
economic factors.  “The decline in the shares that trade on the bourse has
nothing to do with the fact that I repeated what the people
decided on Oct. 30 with their vote,” Petro said in a string of
 Twitter posts  today. “No one should expect mayor Petro to
subject the public interest to the particular, even if it costs
me my life.”  Petro, a former member of the M-19 Marxist guerrilla
movement and ex-senator, won with 32 percent support in an Oct.
30 vote.  To contact the reporter on this story:
