Deposits at Italian lenders declined
in October at the fastest pace in five months, the country’s
central bank said today.  Deposits by households and companies excluding banks fell
by an annual 0.6 percent, the most since June when they
decreased 0.8 percent, the Rome-based central bank said in an e-
mailed  statement . Deposits rose an annual 0.2 percent in
September. The decline in October was mostly due to “non-
financial companies,” according to the statement.  Lending to households rose an annual 4.3 percent, down from
4.5 percent the previous month, the report said. Loans to the
private sector including consumers and companies, and excluding
banks, increased 4.2 percent from 4 percent in September.  To contact the reporter on this story:
