Ukraine paid about $440 million for
natural gas imported from  Russia  in November and must pay an
additional $562.2 million by Dec. 28, said the country’s state-
run energy company, NAK Naftogaz Ukrainy.  The payment consisted of 7.2 billion rubles ($230 million)
and $210 million, Naftogaz said today in an e-mailed statement
from the capital, Kiev. The November bill is $972.2 million.  Russia has agreed to extend the deadline for monthly
payments to the 28th day of each month from the 7th, according
to the statement.  Ukraine is paying about $400 per 1,000 cubic meters of gas
this quarter, according to Naftogaz. The former Soviet republic
is seeking to renegotiate its contract with Russia to lower that
price to $230. The two parties may complete talks on gas
supplies by year-end, OAO Gazprom, Russia’s natural gas export
monopoly, said Dec. 5.  To contact the reporter on this story:
