Sidney Crosby  will miss the
Pittsburgh Penguins’ next two National Hockey League games after
taking a hard hit in a loss to  Boston  two days ago.  Crosby had 12 points in eight games since returning to the
Penguins’ lineup Nov. 21 following an absence of more than 10
months due to a concussion.  Penguins general manager Ray Shero said in a statement that
Crosby isn’t feeling 100 percent, although medical tests showed
no problems. “We all think it’s best that he sits out the next
two games as a precaution,” Shero said.  Crosby, the Penguins’ 24-year-old captain and leading
scorer from last season, will miss games against the
 Philadelphia Flyers  and  New York Islanders .  To contact the reporter on this story:
