Gold futures rose for the first time
in three days as mounting concern that European leaders won’t be
able to agree on steps to stem the region’s debt crisis
increased demand for a haven.  A German government official expressed pessimism over the
outcome of a summit starting tomorrow aimed at resolving the
crisis, and said the country rejects proposals to combine
current and permanent euro-area rescue funds. European stocks
fell, the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index lost 1.1 percent before
rebounding, and the S&P GSCI commodities index dropped as much
as 1.4 percent.  “There’s some concern about what will transpire in
Europe,”  Bill O’Neill , a partner at Logic Advisors in  Upper
Saddle River ,  New Jersey , said in a telephone interview. “This
is a case of gold’s role as an ultimate currency coming to
bear.”  Gold futures for February delivery rose 0.8 percent to
settle at $1,744.80 an ounce at 1:46 p.m. on the Comex in New
York. The metal dropped 1.1 percent in the previous two days.
The price has climbed 23 percent this year, partly because the
 Federal Reserve  has kept its benchmark interest rate at a record
low, fueling demand for the precious metal as an inflation
hedge.  Silver futures for March delivery dropped 0.4 percent to
$32.627 an ounce. Earlier, the price declined as much as 1.5
percent. The metal has climbed 5.5 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
