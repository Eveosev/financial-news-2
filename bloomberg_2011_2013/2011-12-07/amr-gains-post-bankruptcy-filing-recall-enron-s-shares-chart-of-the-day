AMR Corp., the owner of  American
Airlines , is catching up to the performance of Enron Corp.’s
shares after that company filed for bankruptcy almost exactly a
decade earlier.  The CHART OF THE DAY compares AMR’s stock from Nov. 29,
when the company sought Chapter 11 protection, until yesterday
with Enron’s trading in the first six days after its bankruptcy
petition on Dec. 2, 2001.  AMR, based in  Fort Worth ,  Texas , rose for five straight
days after plunging 84 percent on the filing date. Yesterday’s
gain was the biggest, as the stock rose 67 percent to close at
70.4 cents.  “Now you get the forces of supply and demand leveling
out,” Jeffrey Kauffman, an analyst at Sterne, Agee & Leach Inc.
in  New York , said yesterday in a telephone interview. AMR may be
headed for 80 cents to $1.20, a range that’s normal for many
companies in bankruptcy, he said.  Enron closed at 81 cents on its sixth day of post-Chapter
11 trading. The Houston-based energy trader spent almost three
years in bankruptcy, and its shares dropped as low as 0.1 cent
before they were canceled in a reorganization.  The earlier price gap between the stocks, shown in the
chart, may have occurred because Enron’s filing was less of a
surprise. The stock closed at 26 cents on the last trading day
before the filing after a three-day plunge tied to Dynegy Inc.’s
withdrawal of a takeover bid. Coincidentally, AMR closed on the
day of its Chapter 11 petition at 26 cents.  To contact the reporter on this story:
