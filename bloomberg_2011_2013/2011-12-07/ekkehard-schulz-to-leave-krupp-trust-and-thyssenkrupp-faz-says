Former  ThyssenKrupp (TKA)  AG Chief
Executive Officer Ekkehard Schulz will resign from both the
steel companyâ€™s supervisory board and the Alfried Krupp von
Bohlen and Halbach Trust,  Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung said ,
citing an interview with the manager.  Schulz was criticized after his successor Heinrich Hiesinger announced a loss at ThyssenKrupp for the fiscal year
2010/2011 on impairment charges for a Brazil plant and a loss at
plants in the Americas, the German newspaper said.  The Alfried Krupp von Bohlen and Halbach Trust owns 25
percent of ThyssenKrupp, according to Bloomberg data.  To contact the reporter on this story:
