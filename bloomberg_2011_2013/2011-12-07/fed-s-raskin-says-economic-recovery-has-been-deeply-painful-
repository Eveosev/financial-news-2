Federal Reserve Governor  Sarah Bloom Raskin  said the recession that began in 2007 especially hurt
people who were vulnerable to a downturn.  “The current economic recovery has been deeply painful,”
Raskin said at a Richmond Fed Baltimore Branch conference on
“Strategic Data Use to Stabilize Neighborhoods” where she
moderated a panel. “Many of the hardest hit were already
struggling before the crisis began,” she said.  She did not discuss the outlook for the economy, monetary
policy, or regulation in her remarks.  To contact the reporters on this story:
