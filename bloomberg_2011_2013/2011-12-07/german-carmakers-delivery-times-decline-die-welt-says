German carmakers’ delivery times are
shrinking and discounts are growing as demand for new vehicles
declines,  Die Welt  reported, citing a study.  Car buyers in  Germany  who took delivery in November had
waited an average of 3.3 months, compared with 3.6 months in
October, the newspaper said, citing a study by the  Center for
Automotive Research  at the  University of Duisburg-Essen .  Delivery times of German nameplates fell to 3.6 months in
November from 3.7 months in October; foreign brands saw a
steeper drop, to 2.7 months from 3.5 months, Die Welt said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
