The euro-area debt crisis will take a
back seat in 2012 as investors pay more attention to U.S.
economic growth that may accelerate to 3 percent next year,
Wells Capital Management’s  James Paulsen  said.  Europe’s problems will be “with us for years” and are
moving “from an imminent calamity to a chronic problem” in
investors’ perception, Paulsen, Minneapolis-based chief
investment strategist at Wells Capital, which manages about $340
billion, said in a Bloomberg Television interview.  Emerging markets  will be most attractive for equity
investors as central-bank tightening has reduced their
valuations, Paulsen said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
