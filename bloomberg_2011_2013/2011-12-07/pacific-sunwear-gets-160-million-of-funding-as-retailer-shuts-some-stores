Pacific Sunwear of California Inc. (PSUN) 
received $160 million in financing and plans to shut as many as
24 percent of its stores as the teen-apparel retailer works to
return to profitability.  The financing consists of a $100 million revolving credit
facility from  Wells Fargo & Co. (WFC)  and a $60 million senior secured
term loan from  Golden Gate  Capital, the Anaheim, California-
based retailer said in a statement today.  Chief Executive Officer Gary Schoenfeld will shut the 175
to 200 stores in the next 14 months as the retailer tries to
snap a string of 13 straight quarterly net losses. The company
today reported its third-quarter net loss widened to $17.6
million from $6.96 million a year earlier.  Pacific Sunwear rose 28 percent to $1.73 at 4:32 p.m. in
New York. The shares had declined 75 percent this year through
the close of regular trading today.  Golden Gate, based in San Francisco, has previously
invested in or made loans to  Zale Corp. (ZLC) , California Pizza
Kitchen Inc. and Eddie Bauer Holdings Inc.  To contact the reporters on this story:
