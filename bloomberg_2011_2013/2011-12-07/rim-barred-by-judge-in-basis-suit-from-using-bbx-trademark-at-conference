Research In Motion Ltd. (RIM)  was barred by
a federal judge from using Basis International Ltd.’s “BBX”
trademark at an industry conference in Asia that begins today.  U.S. District Judge William P. Johnson in Albuquerque,  New
Mexico , yesterday ruled that Research in Motion can’t use the
BBX trademark at the DevCon conference in Singapore being held
today and tomorrow.  Basis is likely to win its trademark-infringement claims
against Research In Motion, and consumers are “likely to be
confused by RIM’s use of BBX in connection with RIM’s goods and
services,” Johnson wrote in the ruling.  The conference will be attended by software developers who
may be users of Basis’ BBX software, according to the ruling.  Jamie Ernst, a representative of Waterloo, Ontario-based
Research In Motion, said the company doesn’t typically comment
on pending litigation.  “However RIM has already unveiled a new brand name for its
next generation mobile platform,” Ernst said in an e-mailed
statement. “As announced at DevCon  Asia , RIM plans to use the
‘BlackBerry 10’ brand name for its next generation mobile
platform.”  The case is Basis International Ltd. v. Research in Motion,
11-00953, US. District Court, District of New Mexico
(Albuquerque).  To contact the reporter on this story:
