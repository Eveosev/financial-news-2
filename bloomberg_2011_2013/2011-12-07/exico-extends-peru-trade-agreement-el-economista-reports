Mexico  will extend an existing free-
trade agreement with  Peru  while Mexico’s congress approves a new
accord, newspaper  El Economista  reported without saying how it
obtained the information.  Mexico in April signed a new free-trade agreement with Peru
that covers 12,107 goods, the Mexico City-based daily said. The
existing agreement, which was signed in 1987, covers 765
products, El Economista said.  Mexico’s Senate, which must ratify trade agreements reached
by the government, hasn’t approved the news treaty, the
newspaper reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
