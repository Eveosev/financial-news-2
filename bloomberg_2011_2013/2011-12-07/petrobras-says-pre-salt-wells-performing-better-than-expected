(Corrects quantity of oil pumped in first paragraph.)  Petroleo Brasileiro SA (PETR4) , Brazil’s
state-controlled oil producer, is pumping at least 20,000
barrels a day at most of its deep, so-called pre-salt offshore
wells, Chief Executive Officer Jose Sergio Gabrielli said.  The wells are performing better than expected, he told
reporters today in Doha, Qatar. The company, known as Petrobras,
will decide after 2015 on producing liquefied natural gas at
offshore floating facilities, Gabrielli said.  Brazil’s cost of producing new oil will average less than
$43 a barrel between now and 2035, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
