The euro zone may begin to
“crumble” if the leading countries in the area don’t succeed
in making “difficult decisions” in time, Bank of Israel
Governor  Stanley Fischer  said.  Fischer, a former first deputy managing director of the
 International Monetary Fund , said today that while Germany and
France are working to avoid this scenario, market forces may
force the breakup. If the disintegration occurs, some banks in
 Europe  will go bankrupt, and some countries will be in a
comparable situation, Fischer said.  “If countries start to exit, it’s not clear how this
process will develop,” Fischer said at a meeting of the Knesset
Finance Committee in Jerusalem. “What is certain is that there
will be a big mess.”  European policy makers are meeting in Brussels this week to
consider tougher budget rules as part of their efforts to craft
their fifth “comprehensive” solution to the sovereign-debt
crisis. Most international investors predict at least one nation
will eventually dump the euro and they say greater fiscal ties
or a smaller currency area are the best fixes for the region’s
debt crisis, according to the quarterly Bloomberg Global Poll.  To contact the reporter on this story:
