U.S.  mutual funds  lost $9.24 billion
to withdrawals last week, the most in almost two months, as
investors fled domestic and global stocks.  Funds that invest in U.S. equities had $6.67 billion in
redemptions and foreign-stock funds lost $2.96 billion in the
week ended Nov. 30, the Washington-based  Investment Company
Institute  said today in an e-mailed statement.  The redemptions from stock funds were the most since the
week ended Aug. 10, when investors pulled $29.7 billion.
Industrywide withdrawals were the heaviest since the week ended
Oct. 5, the trade group’s data show.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index dipped to a close as low as
1,158.67, then rallied 7.6 percent over three days to finish at
1,246.96 on Nov. 30 as the  Federal Reserve  and five other
central banks reduced the cost of dollar funding.  Investors have pulled money from equity funds for seven
straight months, according to ICI data, driven by concerns about
 Europe ’s debt crisis and slowing economic growth around the
world. The bulk of the redemptions have come in funds that buy
U.S. stocks.  Bond funds attracted $1.16 billion in the latest week.
Taxable-bond funds got deposits of $709 million while municipal-
bond funds won $449 million.  To contact the reporter on this story:
