Pacific Investment Management Co. is
waiting for European central bankers to take more coordinated
action to support markets before buying risky assets, according
to  Mark Kiesel , global head of corporate bond portfolios.  “Investors should consider waiting for European and global
policy makers to reach an ‘all in’ moment before adding to risk
assets,” Kiesel wrote in a  report  dated today on Pimco’s
website. “Given a deteriorating outlook in Europe and the
current absence of a more forceful action plan, the global
economy is set to become increasingly vulnerable.”  European leaders are gathering for a summit in Brussels
during the next two days as the debt crisis that started in
Greece threatens to spread to the region’s banking system. The
 European Central Bank  may announce a range of measures tomorrow
to stimulate bank lending, said three euro-area officials with
knowledge of policy makers’ deliberations, who spoke on
condition of anonymity because the discussions are private.  “In this uncertain environment, volatility will likely
remain high, liquidity poor, risk premiums wide and the global
economy fragile,” Kiesel wrote. “Fortunately, many central
banks around the world have the ability to ease monetary policy
and they also appear more willing to coordinate.”  Kiesel recommended that investors hold more cash than
normal and buy bonds that are secured or senior in the capital
structure.  Newport Beach , California-based Pimco manages the
world’s largest  bond fund. (PTTRX)   To contact the reporter on this story:
