Oil options volatility fell as the
underlying futures slipped for the first time in four days.  Implied volatility for at-the-money options expiring in
January, a measure of expected swings in futures and a gauge of
options prices, dropped to 33.55 at 5 p.m. in  New York  from 33.9
yesterday. Futures dropped 0.8 percent after the government said
crude stockpiles rose 1.34 million barrels to 336.1 million last
week and imports reached a 10-week high.  The most active options contracts in electronic trading
today were January $95 puts, with 2,319 lots changing hands as
of 4:04 p.m. in New York. The options fell 2 cents to 39 cents a
barrel. January $90 puts traded 2,220 lots, falling 1 cent to 9
cents. One contract covers 1,000 barrels of crude.  Oil for January delivery fell 79 cents to settle at $100.49
a barrel on the  New York Mercantile Exchange .  December 2014 $175 calls were the most active options
traded in the previous session, with 4,000 lots changing hands.
They rose 7 cents to $1.75 a barrel. The next-most active
options, January $105 calls, declined 9 cents to 78 cents on
volume of 3,110.  Open interest was highest for December 2012 $150 calls with
38,023 contracts. Next were December 2012 $80 puts with 35,453
contracts, and December 2012 $100 calls with 32,305.  The exchange distributes real-time data for electronic
