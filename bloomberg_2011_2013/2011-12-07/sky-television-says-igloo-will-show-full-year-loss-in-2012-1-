Sky Network Television Ltd. (SKT) , New
Zealandâ€™s largest pay television company, said its new Igloo
service will make a loss in the 2012 year.  The new service offers free-to-air channels and the option
of 11 pay channels which customers can buy on a monthly pre-pay
basis, the Auckland-based company said in a statement. Sky has a
51 percent stake in the service and its share of the net loss
will be NZ$1.6 million in 2012.  Television New Zealand  will own
49 percent.  Sky forecasts about 50,000 subscribers will join the
service by the end of 2012. Customers require a set-top box
which is expected to sell at retail outlets for less than
NZ$200, the company said.  The pay channels on offer include Food TV, BBC World News,
 Comedy Central  and the National Geographic Channel. Sports and
movies will be available on a pay-per-view basis, Sky said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
