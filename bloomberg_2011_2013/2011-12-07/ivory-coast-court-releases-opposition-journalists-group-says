A court in  Ivory Coast  released three
journalists from the Notre Voie newspaper, which supports former
president  Laurent Gbagbo , after 13 days of detention, according
to  Reporters Without Borders .  The journalists, including Cesar Etou, the head of the
Abidjan-based newspaper, were charged with inciting theft,
looting and destruction of property, the Paris-based media
advocacy group said in an e-mailed statement. The charges were
dismissed by a court in Abidjan yesterday, it said.  Didier Depry, Notre Voieâ€™s assistant editor, was put in jail
after the newspaper reported on a plan to devalue the CFA franc
currency. Finance Minister Charles Koffi Diby later denied the
information.  To contact the reporter on this story:
