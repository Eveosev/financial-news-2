Closings of Sunoco Inc. and
ConocoPhillips oil refineries on the U.S. East Coast would be
“negative” for suezmax tankers that haul crude, said Arctic
Securities ASA.  Sunoco said Sept. 6 it would sell or shut its last two
refineries, located in Philadelphia and  Marcus Hook ,
 Pennsylvania . ConocoPhillips has idled its plant in Trainer,
near Marcus Hook, as it seeks to sell the refinery. Refining
capacity on the U.S. East Coast fell 16 percent over the past
two years, Arctic said last month.  “We see this trend as structurally negative for the
suezmax tanker market, due to the fact that East Coast
refineries are primary consuming light, sweet crude from West
Africa,” Erik Nikolai Stavseth, an Oslo-based analyst at
Arctic, said in a report today. Sweet crude contains less sulfur
than the sour variety.  Suezmaxes, each able to haul 1 million barrels of oil, are
earning $11,407 a day on the voyage to the U.S. from West
Africa, according to the London-based Baltic Exchange. Returns
have dropped 65 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
