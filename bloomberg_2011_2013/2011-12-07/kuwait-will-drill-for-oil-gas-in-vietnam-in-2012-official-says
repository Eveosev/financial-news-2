Kuwait  Foreign Petroleum Exploration
Co., a unit of state-run Kuwait Petroleum Corp., will drill for
crude and natural gas in  Vietnam  and look for shale gas joint
ventures in the U.S., according to a company official.  The  company  has had three blocks in Vietnam since 2009 and
will start drilling the first exploration wells there next year,
Ali al-Shammari, deputy chairman of the Kuwait City-based
explorer known as Kufpec, said yesterday in an interview in
Doha, Qatar.  The company is also looking for opportunities in North and
South America along with  Europe  as it plans to boost the number
of fields it operates outside Kuwait, he said. Kufpec seeks to
produce 200,000 barrels of oil equivalent from abroad by 2020,
according to al-Shammari. “Most of this addition will come from
new joint ventures,” he said.  Australia  is a major focus for now for Kufpec, he said. The
company owns 35 percent in a bloc in the West Area of
Australia’s North shelf, where it produces natural gas from two
fields along with its partner Apache Corp., which owns the rest
of the block, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
