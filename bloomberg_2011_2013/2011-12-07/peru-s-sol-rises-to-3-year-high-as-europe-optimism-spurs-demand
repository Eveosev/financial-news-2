Peru ’s sol rose to its strongest
level in more than three years as speculation European policy
makers will agree on steps to contain the region’s debt crisis
spurred demand for higher yielding assets.  The sol rose 0.1 percent to 2.6955 per  U.S. dollar  at
today’s close, from 2.6975 yesterday, according to Deutsche Bank
AG’s local unit. The currency earlier touched 2.6950, its
strongest level since April 2008.  Overseas investors allowed forward contracts to expire as
aversion to risk eased, said Fernando Garcia, a forward currency
trader at Banco Internacional del Peru in Lima.  “There’s no longer a strong demand for dollars from
offshore investors,” which led Peruvian banks to sell the
currency locally, Garcia said.  Peru’s central bank  bought  $123 million in the  spot market 
today to slow gains in the sol. It paid an average 2.6960 soles
per dollar, according to its website.  The central bank sold dollars in the spot market in
September to prop up the sol after Europe’s debt woes and weaker
U.S. economic growth prompted investors to seek less risky
investments.  The  European Central Bank  may announce a range of measures
tomorrow to stimulate bank lending, including a cut in the
benchmark interest rate, said three euro-area officials with
knowledge of policy makers’ deliberations.  The yield on the nation’s benchmark 7.84 percent sol-
denominated bond due August 2020 fell two basis points, or 0.02
percentage point, to 5.69 percent, according to prices compiled
by Bloomberg. The bond’s price rose 0.13 centimo to 114.55
centimos per sol.  To contact the reporter on this story:
