Sudan formed the first government
after the south seceded in July as President Umar al-Bashir’s
 National Congress Party  took control of 20 ministries.  Bashir delayed the appointment of a new cabinet as he
sought the participation of the main opposition parties in the
government. The Democratic Unionist Party agreed to join the
cabinet while the the Ummah Party, the Sudanese Communist Party
and the Popular Congress Party, led by opposition leader Hassan
Al-Turabi, refused to do so.  The NCP’s portfolio includes the finance, oil, foreign
affairs, defense and interior ministries, Nafie Ali Nafie, the
party’s vice president, said late yesterday in remarks broadcast
by state television. The DUP is in charge of the trade, youth
affairs and sports and cabinet affairs ministries.  To contact the reporter on this story:
