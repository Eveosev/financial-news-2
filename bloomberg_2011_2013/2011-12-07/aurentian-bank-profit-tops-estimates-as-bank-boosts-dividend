Laurentian Bank  of Canada said profit
before one-time costs climbed 5.8 percent in the fourth quarter
as the countryâ€™s seventh-largest bank increased its dividend for
the second time in a year.  Excluding costs related to an acquisition and terminating a
distribution agreement, profit for the period ended Oct. 31
climbed to C$34.4 million ($34 million), or C$1.31 a share, from
C$32.5 million, or C$1.24, a year earlier, the Montreal-based
bank said today in a statement. Net income fell 12 percent to
C$28.6 million, or C$1.06 a share.  Laurentian Bank boosted its quarterly dividend 7.1 percent
to 45 cents a share, matching an estimate made by the  Bloomberg
Dividend Forecast. (LB)   The bank was expected to earn C$1.21 a share before one-
time items, based on the average estimate of eight analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg.  (Laurentian Bank will hold a conference call at 2 p.m. To
