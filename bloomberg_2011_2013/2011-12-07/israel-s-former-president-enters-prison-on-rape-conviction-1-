Former Israeli President Moshe Katsav
entered prison to serve a seven-year sentence after being
convicted of rape and exhausting his appeals.  Katsav maintained his innocence in remarks to reporters
today that were broadcast on Israel Radio. “You buried a man
alive,” he said outside Maasiyahu prison south of  Tel Aviv .  Katsav, 66, was found guilty a year ago of raping a female
employee when he was tourism minister more than 10 years ago. He
was also convicted of sexually harassing two other employees
while he was president from 2000 to 2007. The  Supreme Court 
rejected his appeal last month.  The former president will share a cell with former Labor
Minister Shlomo Benizri in a section of the prison reserved for
observant Jews, Israel Radio said, citing prison officials.
Benizri was convicted in 2008 of taking bribes.  To contact the reporter on this story:
