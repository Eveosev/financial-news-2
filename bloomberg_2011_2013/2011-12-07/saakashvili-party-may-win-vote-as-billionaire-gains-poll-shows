Georgian President Mikheil
Saakashvili’s party may win parliamentary elections if they were
held tomorrow, while billionaire Bidzina Ivanishvili’s planned
opposition group would garner almost a fifth of the vote, a poll
showed.  As many as 42 percent of Georgians would back Saakashvili’s
National Movement, according to a survey conducted by the
 International Republican Institute  and scheduled for publication
this month, lawmaker Giorgi Gabashvili said by phone from the
capital, Tbilisi, today.  The nationwide survey of 4,000 people showed Ivanishvili,
who plans to lead an opposition party in next October’s vote,
would get 18 percent. The poll was conducted last month and has
a margin of error of 1.5 percentage points.  Saakashvili, whose second and final term ends in 2013, has
been accused by opposition politicians, including former United
Nations envoy Irakli Alasania, of rolling back democratic
freedoms. Still, 32 percent of Georgians would vote for a
representative from his party at the next presidential
elections, according to the poll.  Ivanishvili, 55, whose wealth was estimated at $5.5 billion
by Forbes magazine in March, held talks with opposition leaders
including Alasania in October. Georgia revoked his citizenship
that month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
