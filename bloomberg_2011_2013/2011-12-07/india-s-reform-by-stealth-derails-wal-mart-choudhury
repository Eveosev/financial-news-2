Much like any government trying to push through an unpopular decision,  India 's leaders first tried telling the opposition to rise above partisan politics. That was to no avail (this will come as no surprise to Americans). Then they tried to bring around their political allies, but some of them dissented openly. Then the government went to the people with  notices in newspapers  ("For the country, for the people of the country"), but thousands took to the streets in protest instead. The leaders tried insisting that theirs was an executive decision, not open to a vote, but found that Parliament refused to apply itself to any other issue. They offered a vision of  millions of new jobs , and argued they had made a rational, carefully calculated policy move, but found themselves ambushed instead by all manner of  conspiracy theories . Finally, India's coalition government, the United Progressive Alliance (UPA), blinked, and  announced  Dec. 5 that it was "suspending" the  most daring policy move of its tenure : the decision two weeks ago to allow foreign retail companies such as Wal-Mart Stores Inc. to own, subject to certain provisos, a majority stake in multibrand retail. This had promised nothing less than a second consumer revolution in India by stimulating the infusion of foreign capital and allowing both farmers and consumers a greater say in India's byzantine food chain. The suspension -- a small concession to the opposition's demand of a total "rollback" -- was a sign of how difficult it is to push through reforms in India. But it also might be read as a salutary lesson about how, in a democracy, the art of policy is nothing if it isn't complemented by the art of politics. As the government contemplated the shambles around it, it seemed worth exploring the question of intelligent policy on a subject of vast importance that was sabotaged in its transmission by obtuse and even self-defeating politics. As I  wrote last week , the initial decision on foreign direct investment had opened a chasm not only between the government and the opposition, but also between the Congress, the party that leads the UPA, and its allies. And for millions of small shopkeepers and traders (thousands of whom came out on the streets to protest the move) employed in India's vast, unorganized retail sector, it also raised the specter of lost jobs from the arrival of global supermarket giants, including Wal-Mart and  France 's Carrefour SA. All this was only to be expected, as is always the case when the status quo is challenged. So what was most surprising about the decision wasn't so much its content (which, as the  economist Surjit Bhalla  remarked, appeared carefully thought out, with a number of caveats designed to function as shock absorbers) or its method. Instead, it was the timing that created the problem: The decision to liberalize retail in India was announced at the beginning of the winter session of Parliament. This allowed other political parties, including the principal opposition party, the BJP (which, despite being to the right of the Congress on economic issues, declared that the  time wasn't right  to open up the economy to big retail giants), to hijack the move by paralyzing Parliament. When some of the Congress's own allies in the coalition government also voiced their resistance to the move, the opposition was able to demand a vote on it. What was, then, a policy decision of tremendous import for every Indian was made to serve a more expedient function by both sides: a government under pressure on several fronts, most notably for its dithering over the  anti-corruption Lokpal Bill , possibly looking for something to distract its critics, and an opposition happy to take any chance to embarrass the government. An  astringent editorial  in the Indian Express, one of the English newspapers most clearly in favor of the liberalization of retail, asked: Some of the motivations behind the politics were investigated in the New York Times'  India Ink blog  by its correspondent Vikas Bajaj, who wrote about how the country's political climate and entrenched politics of populism have often encouraged a troubling "reform by stealth": Indeed, if there was a damning criticism to be made of the Congress outside the immediate political context of the impasse over FDI, it is that, while the party is often credited with the liberalization of  India's economy  in 1991, it has never seriously believed in free (or at the very least freer) markets, preferring to stake its political reputation on welfare measures and to speak not of creating wealth but of eliminating poverty. There is, then, clearly a difference (in this case a fatal difference) between the way the government interprets the economic problems of India today and the way that the party anchoring the governing coalition (and thinks of itself as center-left) does. In a way, then, the fervid opposition to the government's decision across the political spectrum amounted to the Congress being presented with a projection of its own internal dilemmas. An acute assessment of this identity crisis was provided by Manini Chatterjee in a  long essay in The Telegraph : And an  essay  on the website Firstpost.com played down fears of Wal-Mart taking control of chains of supply and distribution, pointing out that the Indian economy is possessed of a diversity and local character very resistant to homogenization: Meanwhile, an  essay in Outlook  dwelt on some of the ironies of the opposition to the FDI move: It has become clear, though, over the last week, that there are so many ways of framing the implications of the debate across issues of politics, economics, society and history that the UPA's decision to open the gates to foreign investment, even if perhaps correct in principle, was short of preparatory groundwork and dissemination of information. Reform by stealth isn't a proactive way of governing. With the decision suspended for the time being, the government has a second chance now to present its thinking to diverse constituencies, and push the move through at a more propitious time in the near future. Under India's federal structure, its states would be free then to open their doors to FDI or reject the decision (as the  prime minister pointed out ). Indeed, this natural variation would be good for those on both sides of the debate. Those states that adopt a protectionist policy would serve as a kind of control group, while the experience of more adventurous ones (such as, probably, the big states of Punjab and Maharashtra, with their powerful farmers' lobbies) would serve to showcase the gains and perils of organized retail in India, and provide some empirical basis to what is currently a debate held hostage to overblown rhetoric on the one hand and political expedience on the other.
