Oil rose from the lowest in almost a
week in  New York  after the  European Central Bank  cut interest
rates for a second month and as the region’s leaders meet to
tackle the sovereign debt crisis.  Futures gained as much as 0.9 percent as ECB policy makers
in Frankfurt lowered the benchmark  interest rate  by a quarter
percentage point to 1 percent to match a record low. The
region’s leaders meet in Brussels today to lay the foundations
for a fiscal union, seeking to stave off an economic slowdown
that would curb demand for raw materials.  “This is optimistic news ahead of the European Union
summit tomorrow,” said Myrto Sokou, an analyst at Sucden
Financial Ltd. in  London . “A cut from 1.25 to 1 percent was
widely expected.”  Crude for January delivery climbed as much as 94 cents to
$101.43 a barrel in electronic trading on the  New York
Mercantile Exchange  and was at $101.27 at 1:35 p.m. London time.
Yesterday, the contract fell 0.8 percent to $100.49, the lowest
settlement since Dec. 1. Futures are up 10 percent this year
after advancing 15 percent in 2010.  Brent oil for January settlement on the London-based ICE
Futures Europe exchange gained 0.8 percent to $110.45 a barrel.
The European benchmark contract was at premium of $8.90 to New
York-traded West Texas Intermediate grade. The spread was a
record $27.88 on Oct. 14.  Saudi Arabia , the world’s biggest crude exporter, will
produce “whatever the customers want,” after pumping 10
million barrels of oil a day last month, Oil Minister Ali al-
Naimi said in an interview in Durban,  South Africa  today. It
will meet with other members of the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries next week in Vienna to discuss output
targets.  The kingdom seeks to have a spare oil production capacity
of 1.5 million to 2 million barrels a day, al-Naimi said. Saudi
Prince Turki bin Faisal bin Abdulaziz al-Saud, former envoy to
the U.S. and a member of the Saudi royal family, estimated the
nation’s surplus output at 2.5 million barrels a day in October.  To contact the reporters on this story:
