Asia  refining margins from naphtha
rose to the highest level in two months after a power outage at
SK Innovation Co.’s Ulsan refinery disrupted production. Profits
from making gasoil also rose. Losses on  fuel oil  widened.  Light Distillates  December swaps for  naphtha , a feedstock for petrochemicals
and gasoline, rose $12.50, or 1.4 percent, to $915 a metric ton
at 11:51 a.m. Singapore time, according to data from PVM Oil
Associates Ltd., a London-based broker.  The swap value was at a premium of $81.50 a ton to Brent
oil, up from $79.90 a ton at the end of Asian trading yesterday,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The crack is at the
widest level since Oct. 19.  SK Innovation Co. said it aims to fully restore operations
this week at the Ulsan refining and petrochemical complex,  South
Korea ’s largest. A  power outage  yesterday prompted a partial
shutdown.  Middle Distillates  Gasoil’s  premium  to Dubai crude rose 62 cents, or 3.5
percent, to $18.46 a barrel, PVM data showed.  January swaps for  gasoil  rose $1.67, or 1.3 percent, to
$126.10 a barrel. Jet fuel’s premium to gasoil, also known as
the  regrade , was unchanged at $1.30 a barrel.  Fuel Oil  High-sulfur fuel-oil  swaps rose $4, or 0.6 percent, to $663
a ton, PVM data showed.  Fuel oil’s  discount  to Dubai crude, a measure of refining
losses from the fuel, widened to $5.64 from $5.21 a barrel
yesterday.  The  premium  of 180-centistoke fuel oil to the 380-
centistoke grade was unchanged at $13.75 a ton.  To contact the reporter on this story:
