South Sudan  and Uganda could share an
export pipeline to transport crude oil from inland fields to the
Indian Ocean,  Total SA (FP)  Chief Executive Officer Christophe de Margerie said today.  “There is a synergy there,” de Margerie said in Doha,
Qatar. “Geographically it’s easy to see that Uganda is next to
Sudan, common border and the pipeline, which is supposed to
leave from our potential blocks, could be effectively up for
different sources of crude.”  Total and its partners Tullow Oil Plc and Cnooc Ltd. plan
to start oil production in Uganda after the government approves
their partnership and field development plans. Uganda will have
to export crude oil it won’t use domestically and has been
examining plans to build a pipeline through either Kenya or
 Tanzania .  De Margerie said he expected the government to approve the
deal soon.  To contact the reporter on this story:
