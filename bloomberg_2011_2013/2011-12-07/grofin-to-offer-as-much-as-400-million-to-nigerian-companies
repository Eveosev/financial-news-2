GroFin , a financier with operations
in seven African countries, plans to channel as much as $400
million in funding to small and medium businesses in  Nigeria 
over the next three to four years, said Guido Boysen, chief
executive officer for  Africa .  “We have $250 million under management at present and
target between $500 million and $1 billion in the next three to
four years, with Nigeria getting about 40 percent of the
investments,” he said in an interview yesterday in Lagos.  Grofin, based in Pretoria, South Africa, is investing funds
contributed by partners including African Development Bank,
International Finance Corp., Commonwealth Development Corp. and
Shell Foundation. It targets the “growth economies of Africa,”
identified as Nigeria, South Africa,  Ghana ,  Kenya , Tanzania,
Uganda and Mauritius, according to Boysen.  Nigeria, Africa’s top oil producer with more than 160
million people, is sub-Saharan Africa’s second-biggest economy
after  South Africa . Grofin invested about 500 million naira ($3
million) in Nigeria this year and plans further lending and
equity investments in agriculture, small-scale manufacturing,
hotels, schools, maritime and hydrocarbons in the coming years.  “Nigeria is our major market,” Boysen said. “All our
investments in Nigeria are targeted at companies with local
ownership and requiring $50,000 to $1.5 million intervention and
can help grow the economy.”  Loans are provided at commercial rates for up to eight
years, he said. Grofin provides advice and business support to
companies “for the duration.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
