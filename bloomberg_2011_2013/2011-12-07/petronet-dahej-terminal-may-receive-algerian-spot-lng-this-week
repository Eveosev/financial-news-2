Petronet LNG Ltd. (PLNG) ’s Dahej terminal on
 India ’s western coast may receive about 60,000 metric tons of
liquefied natural gas from Algeria, according to ship
transmissions on Bloomberg and vessel fixtures from shipping
newsletter EXIM India.  The Berge Arzew may arrive from the North African nation
this week, according to data captured by AIS Live on Bloomberg.
The vessel was last seen off the coast of Gujarat state, near
Dahej. Petronet is India’s biggest importer of LNG and leases
its terminal to other companies.  LNG is natural gas chilled to a liquid, with a volume
that’s one-six-hundredth of its original size at minus 161
degrees Celsius (minus 258 degrees Fahrenheit). The fuel is
transportable by ship to places not connected by pipeline.  To contact the reporter on this story:
