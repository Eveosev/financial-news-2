London. The UBS Bloomberg CMCI  index  of 26 raw materials
declined 1 percent to 1,538.015.  CRUDE OIL  Oil extended losses, falling below $100 a barrel after the
U.S. Energy Department reported an unexpected increase in
inventories.  OIL PRODUCTS  European gasoline’s premium to  Brent crude  fell, snapping
five days of gains, as forecasts of rising U.S. stockpiles
signaled less need for imports from Europe.  Gasoline’s premium to crude, or crack, dropped to 53 cents
a barrel from 82 cents yesterday, according to data from PVM Oil
Associates Ltd., a London-based broker. The premium started the

Norwegian pipeline imports increased amid record storage levels
and an absence of freezing weather.  The January contract dropped 0.6 percent to 57.85 pence a
therm.  Natural gas futures declined in New York as forecasts for
colder-than-normal weather turned warmer, reducing demand for

to $689.90 an ounce on the  New York Mercantile Exchange , the
highest price since Sept. 22. Prices have jumped 15 percent this
year.  BASE METALS  Copper fell for a second day on growing concern that
