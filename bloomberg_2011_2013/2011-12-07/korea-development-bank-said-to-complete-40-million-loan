Korea Development Bank  completed a
$40 million loan after attracting three lenders, said a person
familiar with the matter.  Australia & New Zealand Banking Group Ltd., which helped
arrange the loan, committed $20 million, said the person, who
asked not to be identified because the details are private. The
 Norinchukin Bank  and NTT Finance Corp., committed $10 million
each, the person said.  The two-year loan pays an all-in, which includes margin and
fees, of about 150 basis points over the London interbank
offered rate, said the person. The loan was borrowed by KDBâ€™s
Singapore unit.  To contact the reporter on this story:
