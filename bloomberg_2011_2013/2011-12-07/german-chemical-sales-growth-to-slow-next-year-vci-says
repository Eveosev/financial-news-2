Germany’s VCI chemical association,
which represents companies including  BASF SE (BAS)  and Evonik
Industries AG, said sales growth will slow next year from a
record in 2011 as customers reduce stock piles.  Sales for chemical goods will grow 2 percent, with
production and producer prices each rising 1 percent, the
Frankfurt-based association said in a statement today.  Germany’s chemical industry is poised to miss the VCI’s
growth projections this year, with sales expanding 9 percent,
less than an original 10 percent forecast outlined in November.
Growth slowed in the second half, yet sales for the year will
still be at a record of 186.5 billion euros ($250 billion), the
VCI said.  “The risk of an economic setback has become stronger more
recently,” said Klaus Engel, who heads the VCI and is also
chief executive officer of Evonik Industries AG. The industry is
not facing a recession, he added.  The number of jobs in  Germany ’s third-largest industry will
rise 2.5 percent this year to 425,000, VCI estimates.  BASF, the world’s largest chemicals maker, on Nov. 29
raised its sales target for the end of this decade to 115
billion euros, translating into an average 6 percent increase
per year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
