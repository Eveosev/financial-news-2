U.K. benchmark government bonds
underperformed equivalent bunds as gains in European stocks and
increased demand at a German note auction damped bids for the
relative safety of British securities.  Long-dated gilts stayed lower even after demand improved at
an auction of index-linked bonds. The yield difference between
10-year gilts and bunds widened as the  Stoxx  Europe 600 climbed
0.7 percent and the U.K.’s  FTSE 100 (UKX)  Index of stocks rose 0.6
percent. The  European Central Bank  said demand for three-month
dollar loans jumped after it almost halved the cost of the funds
in a concerted action with five other central banks.  Today’s move in gilt yields is “largely a reaction to the
move in bunds after the ECB lending news and a strong German
five-year note auction,” said Adam McCormack, head of gilt
sales at Barclays Plc in  London .  The auction of 900 million pounds ($1.4 billion) 1.25
percent inflation-protected gilts maturing in 2032 drew bids
2.03 times the amount of security on offer, compared with a bid-
to-cover ratio of 1.97 times in the previous sale in January.  Germany  sold 4.09 billion euros ($5.5 billion) of five-year
notes today. The nation got bids for 8.67 billion euros, more
than the maximum sales target of 5 billion euros. The notes were
sold to yield 1.11 percent.  10-Year Gilt  The 10-year gilt yield fell two basis points, or 0.02
percentage point, to 3.23 percent at 10:25 a.m. London time,
lagging a four-basis point drop in similar-maturity German bund
yields. The U.K. 3.75 percent security maturing September 2021
rose 0.14, or 1.4 pounds per 1,000 pound face amount, to
113.215.  The U.K. two-year yield was little changed at 0.37 percent.
It earlier dropped to 0.346 percent, the lowest since Bloomberg
began tracking the data in 1992.  Gilts have returned 15 percent this year, according to
indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the European Federation of
Financial Analysts Societies, while European benchmark German
debt rose 7.3 percent. U.S. Treasuries have gained 8.9 percent.  The pound was little changed against the dollar and 17-
member euro after data showed U.K. manufacturing output fell
more than economists forecast. It traded at 85.92 pence per euro
and $1.5622.  Sterling has depreciated 1.2 percent in the past month,
making it the worst performer among the 10 developed-nation
currencies tracked by Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes.  Factory output slid 0.7 percent from September, the biggest
decline since April, according to the  Office for National
Statistics . The median forecast of 21 economists in a Bloomberg
News survey called for a 0.3 percent decline. Overall industrial
output, which includes mining and oil and gas, is also dropped
0.7 percent.  The National Institute of Economic and Social Research will
publish its gross domestic product figure for the three months
through November later today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
