Chile ’s central bank plans to buy $50
million a day until Dec. 16, the bank said today as it published
its bond sale  calendar  for the month through Jan. 8.  The bank has already bought $11.7 billion of U.S. dollars
as part of a $12 billion intervention announced in January. The
new purchases will add $300 million. By yesterday the bank would
have made about $614 million profit on its intervention,
according to Bloomberg calculations that exclude the cost of
financing the operation and profits or losses from investing the
dollars purchased.  The bank plans to sell $422 million of bonds, including
$148 million in pesos and $274 million in unidades de fomento,
the country’s inflation-linked accounting unit, over the period.
The government will sell $307 million of debt, $77 million of it
in pesos and $229 million in unidades de fomento, the bank said.  The central bank won’t sell any 20-year inflation-linked
bonds this month and the government won’t offer 10-year, 20-year
or 30-year inflation-linked bonds or 10-year fixed-rate bonds.  To contact the reporter on this story:
