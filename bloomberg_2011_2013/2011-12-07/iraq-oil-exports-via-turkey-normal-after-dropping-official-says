Crude exports from northern  Iraq  fell
to 10,000 barrels a day, a fraction of the normal flow, due to
technical faults and a temporary lack of storage at a Turkish
port, an official at the state-run North Oil Co. said.  Exports dropped today for about four and a half hours
before returning to normal levels of 400,000 to 500,000 barrels
a day through a pipeline terminating at Turkey’s Ceyhan terminal
on the  Mediterranean Sea , said the official, who declined to be
identified in line with company policy. Exports through the
pipeline normally include 80,000 barrels a day from  oil fields 
in Iraq’s northern Kurdish region, the official said in an e-
mailed statement.  Iraq exported crude at an average rate of 2.135 million
barrels a day in November, Falah Al-Amri, the director of the
State Oil-Marketing Organization, said Dec. 1. It produced an
average of 2.705 million barrels a day last month, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  Iraq holds the world’s fifth-biggest crude deposits,
according to data from BP Plc that also include Canadian  oil
sands . The government is seeking foreign funds and expertise to
help increase energy exports to pay for modernizing the economy
after years of conflict, sanctions and sabotage.  To contact the reporter on this story:
