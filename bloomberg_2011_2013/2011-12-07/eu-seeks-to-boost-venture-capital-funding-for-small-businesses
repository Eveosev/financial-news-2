The European Union proposed allowing
venture-capital funds to operate across the 27-nation region
under a single set of rules if they meet EU standards on lending
to small businesses.  “By introducing a single rulebook, venture-capital funds
will have the potential to attract more capital commitments and
become bigger,” the Brussels-based European Commission said in
an e-mailed statement. Bigger funds “mean more capital for
individual companies,” it said today.  Funds will be allowed to operate across the EU if they
invest at least 70 percent of their capital into small
businesses that are closely held, the commission said. Funds’
investments would need to take the form of either an ownership
stake in the companies or providing them with loss absorbing
debt, it said.  The measures need to be approved by EU governments and
lawmakers in the European Parliament before they can enter into
force.  To contact the reporter on this story:
