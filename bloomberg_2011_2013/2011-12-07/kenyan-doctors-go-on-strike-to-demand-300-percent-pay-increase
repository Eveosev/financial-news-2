Kenyan doctors are on strike to
demand a 300 percent pay rise and an increase in the national
budget for healthcare to 15 percent of total spending from 5.5
percent, the  Kenya Medical Practitioners, Pharmacists and
Dentists Union  said.  “Today is the third day of the strike, the government has
kept quiet, it has not heeded to the demands of the doctors,”
Boniface Chitayi, the secretary-general of the union, said
during a march in the capital, Nairobi. Almost 1,000 doctors
took part in the protest.  Kenyan doctors earn an average of $310 per month and so far
the government has offered a pay increase of $70, Chitayi said.
The union, which draws its membership from both private and
public hospitals, has 2,800 members, he said.  Calls to the Ministry of Medical Services did not connect
when Bloomberg News sought comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
