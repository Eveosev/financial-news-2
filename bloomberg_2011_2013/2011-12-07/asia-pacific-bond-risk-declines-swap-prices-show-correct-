The cost of insuring corporate bonds
in  Asia  against non-payment fell, according to credit-default
swap traders.  The Markit iTraxx Asia index of 40 investment-grade
borrowers outside  Japan  fell 1 basis point to 194.5 basis points
as of 8:44 a.m. in  Hong Kong , Credit Agricole SA prices show.
The benchmark has added 92.5 basis points this year, headed for
its second straight yearly climb, according to data provider
CMA, which is owned by CME Group Inc., and compiles prices
quoted by dealers in the privately negotiated market.  The Markit iTraxx Australia index fell 1 basis point to 185
as of 11:47 a.m. in Sydney, according to Credit Agricole.  The Markit iTraxx Japan index was unchanged at 187 basis
points as of 9:42 a.m. in  Tokyo , Deutsche Bank AG prices show.  Credit-default swap indexes are benchmarks for protecting
bonds against default, and traders use them to speculate on
credit quality. A drop signals improving perceptions of
creditworthiness, while an increase suggests the opposite.  The swap contracts pay the buyer face value in exchange for
the underlying securities if a borrower fails to meet its debt
agreements.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
