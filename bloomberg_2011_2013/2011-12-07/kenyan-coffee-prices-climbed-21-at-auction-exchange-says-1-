     Dec. 7 (Bloomberg) -- Kenya ’s coffee prices climbed 21
percent at an auction today as buyers replenished their stocks
before the year-end holidays, the Nairobi Coffee Exchange said.  The average price for all the coffee sold rose to $340.95
for a 50-kilogram (110-pound) bag from $280.70 two weeks ago,
the exchange said in an e-mail from the capital, Nirobi.  “Buyers are trying to stock as much coffee as possible
because this was the second last auction before the break,”
Kizito Keya, a coffee trader at Mumba Coffee Ltd., said by phone
from Nairobi.  The average price for the benchmark AA grade fell 3 percent
to $446.14 a bag from $459.99 at the previous sale after
supplies rose 89 percent to 2,623 bags, the agency said. The top
grade sold for as much as $480 a bag compared to $537 at the
previous sale, it said.  The last auction this year will be held on Dec. 14 and
sales will reopen on Jan. 10, according to the exchange.  Sales at the auction climbed 84 percent to 9,732 bags
worth $4.1 million from 5,299 bags valued at $1.8 million at the
previous auction, the exchange said.  Supplies rose 56 percent to 16,610 bags from 10,616 bags
at the previous auction, the agency said.  The country harvests the bulk of its crop from October
through December, while a secondary crop is reaped from April to
June. The following are details of today’s auction in U.S.
