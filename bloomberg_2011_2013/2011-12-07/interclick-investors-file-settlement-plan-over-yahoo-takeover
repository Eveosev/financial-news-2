Investors in  Interclick Inc. (ICLK) , a
provider of marketing advice based on consumers’ online
behavior, filed a tentative settlement of lawsuits over a
planned $270 million buyout by  Yahoo!  Inc.  Yahoo on Nov. 1 agreed to acquire New York-based Interclick
for $9 a share, a 22 percent premium at the time. Some
shareholders sued Interclick directors in Delaware Chancery
Court and state court in  New York , saying the price was too low.  “As part of the settlement, all of the defendants deny all
allegations of wrongdoing,” according to a Dec. 5 report to the
U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.  The parties signed a memorandum of understanding Dec. 4 to
settle the cases in exchange for “certain supplemental
disclosures” about the buyout process, according to court
papers. The accord requires approval from a Delaware judge.  “The settlement will not affect the amount of
consideration to be paid” in the deal, Yahoo told the SEC.  Yahoo, based in Sunnyvale,  California , began a cash tender
offer for Interclick’s stock last month. Absent an extension,
the offer will expire Dec. 13, the buyer said in a statement.  The lead Delaware case is Whaley v. Brauser and Interclick
Inc., CA7038-VCG, Delaware Chancery Court (Wilmington).  To contact the reporter on this story:
