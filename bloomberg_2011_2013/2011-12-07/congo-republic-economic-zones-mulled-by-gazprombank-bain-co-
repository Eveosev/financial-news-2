A group of foreign companies
including  Gazprombank OJSC (GZPR)  began a feasibility study on two
special economic zones in the Republic of Congo, a government
official said.  The proposed zones are in Brazzaville, the capital, and
Ouesso, 660 kilometers (410 miles) north of the city, Alain
Akouala Atipault, head of special economic zones in the
presidency, said in a statement today. The group also includes
Bain & Co. and Gide Loyrette Nouel, he said. The results of the
study will be announced in six months, Atipault said.  Republic of Congo is recovering from a civil war between
1997 and 1999 in which at least 10,000 people died and 800,000
civilians were displaced. The Central African nation, which
earns more than half its income from oil, is investing in
infrastructure as economic growth accelerates. Oil production
grew to a record 115 million barrels last year, helping the
economy expand 10.2 percent, according to the  African
Development Bank .  Last month, Atipault said China offered to help fund
special economic zones in the country.  To contact the reporter on this story:
