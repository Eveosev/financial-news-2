Hartford Financial Services Group
Inc. (HIG) , the insurer that repaid a $3.4 billion bailout last year,
agreed to make Wellington Management Co. LLP sole sub-adviser
for mutual funds to help fuel expansion.  Wellington will take that role after the board of the
mutual-fund business completes a fund-by-fund review, Hartford,
based in the Connecticut city of the same name, said in a
statement today. Boston-based Wellington is the sub-adviser on
45 of Hartford’s 77 funds, with the insurer’s investment-
management unit overseeing 31 other funds, according to the
statement. After the handoff, the investment-management business
will focus on institutional investors, the company said.  “Hartford is accelerating its growth plans for the mutual-
funds business,” Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Liam E. McGee, 57, said in the statement. “Aligning more closely with a
well-respected adviser like Wellington by designating them as
our preferred sub-adviser is an important step toward our
longer-term goal to create  shareholder value .”  The agreement is the latest effort by Hartford to generate
value from its  mutual funds . The company started seeking buyers
for the unit this year and in September halted the process after
banks curtailed lending for leveraged buyouts, people with
knowledge of the matter said then. Hartford had been in talks to
sell the unit to Clayton Dubilier & Rice LLC, the people said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
