     (Corrects to show the similar action in second paragraph
was on euro-area governments.)  The European Union’s AAA long-term
rating and the ratings of some of the region’s largest banks
including BNP Paribas SA, Commerzbank AG and Deutsche Bank AG
may be cut by  Standard & Poor’s .  The ratings are on “creditwatch negative,” S&P said in
separate statements, following a similar action on 15 of the 17
euro-area governments. The EU’s short-term A-1+ rating was
affirmed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
