Colombia ’s securities regulator said
it is suspending trading of shares in  Empresa de Energia de
Bogota SA (EEB)  for three business days after they plunged this week.  The regulator said trading of the shares will be suspended
as a preventive measure to protect investors, “taking into
account the behavior that the shares have had in recent days,”
according to an e-mailed statement.  The shares fell 3.7 percent today to 1,050 pesos at 11:05
a.m. Bogota time. Shares have fallen 17 percent in the past
three days. Colombia’s IGBC benchmark index dropped 3.3 percent
in that same period.  To contact the reporter on this story:
