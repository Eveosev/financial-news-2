Good morning, and welcome back to the Griddle, a menu of fortified items for the busy person's media diet. Today's Sustainability indicator is $40 billion. That's the amount that international oil and gas producers and state-owned companies will pay in 2013 to get at increasingly difficult-to-reach deposits in the  Middle East . The number is rising, up 18 percent from last year, Bloomberg News reports. The story of renewable energy is often framed by how low the price of wind and solar will fall. Today's indicator reminds us of the competing dynamic: how high will the price of oil climb as rising nations compete for harder-to-reach supplies?
