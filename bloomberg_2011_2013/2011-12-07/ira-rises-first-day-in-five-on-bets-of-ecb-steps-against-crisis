Turkish bond yields fell on
speculation the  European Central Bank  will expand funding to the
region’s most indebted nations.  Yields on the benchmark two-year debt fell nine basis
points, or 0.09 percentage point, to 10.33 percent at the close
in Istanbul. The lira gained 0.1 percent to 1.8320 per dollar.  The ECB may announce a range of measures tomorrow to
stimulate bank lending, said three euro-area officials with
knowledge of policy makers’ deliberations. Options on the table
include loosening collateral criteria so that institutions have
more access to cheap ECB cash and offering them longer-term
loans to grease the flow of credit to the economy, said the
officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity because the
discussions are private. Two said an interest rate cut is
likely, with only the size of the reduction
to be determined for the monthly decision tomorrow.  “A lot of people are banking on the ECB announcing some
sort of commitment to intervene more aggressively in periphery
bond markets, if EU policymakers show significant efforts to
move towards a fiscal union,” Thu Lan Nguyen, a currency
strategist at Commerzbank AG in  Frankfurt , said in e-mailed
comments.  To contact the reporter on this story:
