European banks must do more to
support renewable energy projects if a target set by the
European Union is to be met, said Richard Burrett, co-chairman
of the United Nations Environment Programme Finance Initiative.  “Banks are very much on the back foot,” Burrett said
yesterday in an interview in  London  at an Ethical Corporation
summit on sustainable finance. “If we’re going to meet the EU’s
targets for 2020 we need to be putting billions of euros of
capital into the clean energy space and green technologies.”  The European Union aims to get 20 percent of its energy
requirement from renewable sources by 2020, a goal that member
states must each contribute to. The U.K. proposed a cut of as
much as 55 percent in the price for solar power in October,
while both France and  Italy  have scaled back their so-called
feed-in tariffs for solar energy producers this year.  Triodos Bank NV, a Dutch ethical lender, and the Co-
Operative Group Ltd., the U.K.’s largest  mutual lender, “are
great examples of what can be done but they’re relatively small
examples,” said Burrett.  UNEP FI, the UN’s Environment Programme Finance Initiative,
is a partnership between UNEP and about 200 financial
institutions.  To contact the reporters on this story:
