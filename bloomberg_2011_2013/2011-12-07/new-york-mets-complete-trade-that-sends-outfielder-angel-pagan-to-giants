The  New York Mets  completed a trade
that sent center fielder Angel Pagan to the San Francisco Giants
for relief pitcher Ramon Ramirez and outfielder Andres Torres.  The deal was reported last night by media outlets including
the  New York  Times and confirmed today in a Mets news release.  Pagan, 30, batted .262 with 56 runs batted in, 24 doubles
and seven home runs in 123 games last season, his fourth with
the Mets.  The 30-year-old Ramirez was 3-3 with four saves and a 2.62
earned run average in 66 games last season. He’s 20-17 with a
3.16 ERA during his six-year Major League Baseball career with
the Colorado Rockies,  Kansas City Royals , Boston Red Sox and
Giants.  Torres, 33, batted .221 in 112 games last season, hitting
24 doubles and four homers with 19 RBI and 19 stolen bases.  Pagan’s departure came as Mets’ All-Star shortstop  Jose Reyes  left New York as a free agent to join the Miami Marlins.  New York also signed free-agent pitchers Jon Rauch and
Frank Francisco, who played last season for the Toronto Blue
Jays, the Times reported yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
