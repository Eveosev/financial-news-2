OAO Transnefteprodukt,  Russia ’s oil
products pipeline operator, is planning to cap the maximum
sulfur content of fuel transported through its system at 500
parts per million in the first quarter of 2012.  The change is likely to happen closer to the start of that
period, a company official said today by telephone from Moscow,
declining to be identified in line with policy.  Transnefteprodukt limits sulfur content in its pipelines to
1,000 ppm and many refineries that use its system already supply
it with fuel that meets the 500 ppm cap, the official said.  “The potential changes would cause some minor hiccups but
no real problems,” JBC Energy GmbH said in an e-mailed
statement. Refineries will try to maximize production of 500-ppm
fuels and ship the remaining product via rail, it said.  The company’s pipelines that operate with a 10 ppm sulfur
limit will be unaffected by the change.  To contact the reporter on this story:
