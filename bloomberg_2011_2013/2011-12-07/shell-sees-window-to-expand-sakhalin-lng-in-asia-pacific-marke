Royal Dutch Shell Plc. (RDSA)  said its
Sakhalin venture with OAO Gazprom, Russia’s natural gas export
monopoly needs to expand fast to sell liquefied natural gas to
 Asia  at maximum profit.  There’s a window of opportunity in the Asia Pacific from
2015 to 2020, Harry Brekelmans, the head of the energy company’s
Russian unit, told reporters today in Moscow. The market will
tighten after that with additional LNG volumes coming from
Australia, Shell spokesman Maxim Shoob said today.  Shell, Gazprom and Japanese partners Mitsui & Co. and
Mitsubishi Corp. are considering investing in a third processing
train to the Sakhalin-2 LNG plant to add capacity. Demand for
LNG has soared in Japan,  South Korea  and other Asian markets
after an earthquake and tsunami led to the Fukushima nuclear
disaster and boosted  Japan ’s need for other fuels.  The Sakhalin project is in a position to capture this
demand window, Brekelmans said.  The group will have to resolve how to supply natural gas
for any additional train it seeks to build. Gazprom may seek an
asset swap with a foreign partner in the project before
committing further reserves off the Pacific coast of Sakhalin
Island for the expansion of the LNG plant, Gazprom’s Deputy
Chief Executive officer Alexander Medvedev said on Sept. 27.  To contact the reporter on this story:
