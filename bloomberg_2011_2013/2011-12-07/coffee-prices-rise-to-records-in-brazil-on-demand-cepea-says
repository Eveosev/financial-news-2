Prices of arabica and robusta coffee
consumed in top global producer  Brazil ’s domestic market rose to
records on increased demand from local roasters, researcher
Cepea said.  Low-quality arabica averaged 335.23 reais ($187.19) a bag
from the start of the crop in July to November, up 40 percent
from a year earlier, Cepea data show. Robusta averaged 227.49
reais, up 36 percent, according to the figures. Brazilian
roasters usually purchase robusta and low-quality arabica, said
Cepea, a University of Sao Paulo research group.  “The low supply of these coffee beans has been pushing up
prices this season,” Cepea analyst Margarete Boteon said in a
report yesterday. “Both coffee types have already hit the
highest values, in nominal terms.”  Coffee usage in the country probably will rise 3.5 percent
this year, according to the Brazilian Association of Coffee
Industries. Demand climbed to a record 19.1 million bags last
year, data from the group show. Brazil may overtake the U.S. as
the world’s biggest consumer in five years, Rabobank
International estimates.  Local coffee demand continues to be “heated,” Boteon
said. Brazil will produce 43.1 million bags this season,
according to the agriculture ministry’s crop-forecasting agency.
Exports may total 25 million bags, according to agents surveyed
by Cepea.  To contact the reporter on this story:
