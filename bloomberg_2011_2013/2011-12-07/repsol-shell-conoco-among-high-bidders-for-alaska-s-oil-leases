Repsol YPF SA (REP) ,  Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA) 
and  ConocoPhillips (COP)  are among the high bidders for oil leases
offered by the State of Alaska.  The state Department of Natural Resources sold leases today
for 281,095 acres in the Beaufort Sea and 335,289 acres on the
North Slope, to boost oil exploration and production and push
more crude through the Trans Alaska Pipeline.  Repsol of Madrid, Spain’s largest oil company, bid $2.6
million for North Slope tracts and $376,256 for Beaufort leases.
Shell of The Hague offered $2.6 million for access to the
Beaufort Sea, where it has holdings purchased from the federal
government in 2005. Conoco, based in Houston, will pay $2.7
million for access to North Slope lands, according to an interim
sale report from the state.  “Shell’s participation in today’s lease sale underscores
our ambition to be a long-term partner with the State of
 Alaska ,” Pete Slaiby, Shell Alaska vice president, said in an
e-mailed statement.  The U.S. Bureau of Land Management, which auctioned 3
million acres in the National Petroleum Reserve, will release
results later today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
