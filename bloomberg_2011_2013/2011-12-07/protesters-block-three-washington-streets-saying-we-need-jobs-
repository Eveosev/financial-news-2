Police arrested 62 people in
 Washington  after about 300 demonstrators blocked three downtown
streets to protest high unemployment and corporate bailouts.  Protesters aligned with the Occupy Wall Street movement
marched in the rain carrying signs saying “We’re the 99%” and
“We Need Jobs.” They used tables, tents and overturned
newspaper-vending boxes to block traffic as drivers honked and
yelled at the group. Police redirected traffic and formed lines
to prevent further street closings.  “My entire family is unemployed,” said Olivia Mancin, 21,
who drove to Washington two days ago from Pittsburgh to join the
Occupy Washington movement. “My mother, my father, me. We
aren’t lazy people. We want to work and something has to be
done.”  Most of those arrested were charged with obstruction of
public highways, said Araz Alali, a spokesman for the  District
of Columbia  police department.  Demonstrators marched from McPherson Square, where
protesters are camped three blocks from the White House, through
parts of city’s downtown toward the executive mansion during
lunch hour.  Earlier this week, 31 people were arrested at McPherson
Square after U.S. Park Police tore down a plywood shelter built
by protesters as a place to hold meetings in bad weather.
Hundreds of demonstrators have been arrested across the U.S.
since the protests began in New York Sept. 17.  To contact the reporter on this story:
