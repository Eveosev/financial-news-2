Indonesia ’s rupiah weakened for the
first time in six days on speculation intervention by the
central bank today was not sufficient to strengthen the currency.
Bonds snapped a six-day gain.  The rupiah erased or reversed earlier losses in the past
two days in late trade. Bank Indonesia plans to boost
“intervention” in the market to support the currency, Governor
Darmin Nasution said Nov. 30, a day after the rupiah reached a
17-month low of 9,240 per dollar.  “There is selling pressure from offshore investors as they
are waiting to see when Bank Indonesia comes into the market,”
said Wiling Bolung, head of treasury at ANZ Panin Bank in
Jakarta. “The central bank has committed to support the
currency and bonds.”  The rupiah declined 0.3 percent to 9,075 per dollar as of
4:28 p.m. in Jakarta, according to prices from local banks
compiled by Bloomberg. It weakened as much as 0.9 percent and
gained as much as 0.2 percent.  Bank Indonesia  will keep its benchmark  interest rate  at 6
percent tomorrow, according to 17 of 22 economists surveyed by
Bloomberg. Five predict a quarter of a percentage point cut.
Policy makers will weigh the impact of November’s 50-basis point
cut on capital flows, Perry Warjiyo, director for economic
research and monetary policy at the central bank, said Dec. 5.  The yield on the government’s benchmark 8.25 percent notes
due July 2021 increased four basis points, or 0.04 percentage
point, to 6.10 percent today, according to prices from the
Inter-Dealer Market Association.  To contact the reporter on this story:
