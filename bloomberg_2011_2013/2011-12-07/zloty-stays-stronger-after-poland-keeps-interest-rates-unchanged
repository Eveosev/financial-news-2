The zloty stayed stronger versus the
euro after the Polish central bank left the main interest rate
unchanged for a sixth month.  The zloty strengthened 0.1 percent to 4.4672 per euro as of
1:30 p.m. in Warsaw. The Narodowy Bank Polski left the benchmark
seven-day interest rate at 4.5 percent, matching the forecast of
all 32 economists in a Bloomberg survey.  To contact the reporter on this story:
