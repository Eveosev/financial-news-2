British American Tobacco Plc (BTI)  will be
included in the Johannesburg Stock Exchange’s  Top 40 index  from
Dec. 19, replacing  ArcelorMittal South Africa Ltd. (ACL) , after a
quarterly review of companies’ index weightings.  BAT will carry the highest weighting in the index,
replacing  MTN Group Ltd. (MTN) , JSE Ltd., which runs the exchange,
said in a stock exchange statement.  The exchange also reclassified 32 companies, including BAT,
as domestic securities, following the easing of rules
restricting foreign stock ownership in the Treasury’s mid-term
budget on Oct. 25. The companies were previously classified as
“inward foreign listings” and counted as foreign shares in
terms of prudential limits for local fund managers.  To contact the reporter on this story:
