Banco Santander SA (SAN) ’s sale of its
Colombian unit is a sign of how regulators’ efforts to make
European banks bolster capital may force lenders to reverse
long-held growth strategies.  Santander, striving to plug a 5.2 billion-euro ($7 billion)
capital shortfall in the wake of  Spain ’s property crash, said
last night that it will sell the Colombian business to  Chile ’s
Corpbanca for about $1.16 billion. The Santander, Spain-based
bank will book a $827 million gain to bolster its balance sheet,
calling the nation of 45 million people “not a core market.”  “It seems strange because  Colombia  is one of the fastest-
 developing countries , and if you really want to have a strong
presence in  Latin America , you should be there,” said Jose de Ochoa, who worked on the Santander team that studied the
purchase of the lender, then known as Bancoquia, in 1997. “It
all comes down to the need for capital.”  Colombia was among countries targeted by Santander during
the 1990s, when Chairman Emilio Botin sent his daughter Ana
Patricia to Latin America to lead an expansion drive in Spain’s
former colonies. The South American nation has boomed for a
decade as its government stemmed violence and reduced debt,
while demand for its commodity exports surged.  Colombia’s central bank estimates economic growth will be 6
percent this year, compared with the 0.7 percent pace for Spain
forecast by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and
Development.  Corpbanca (CORPBANC)  shares surged the most in a year today amid
optimism for the Chilean lender’s earnings outlook in the wake
of the purchase.  Not Enough Share  Santander said Colombia contributed $54 million to total
profit in 2010, 0.5 percent of the company’s total. As recently
as July of last year, Francisco Luzon, the head of Santander’s
Latin American division, told the newspaper El Pais that the
bank aimed to boost its presence in Colombia, seeking 10 percent
of the market by 2015, up from less than 3 percent at the time.  “Our market share in retail and commercial banking in
Colombia is far from the 10 percent we aim for in the countries
in which we have a presence,”  Emilio Botin  said in last night’s
statement.  It’s not the first setback in the region for Santander,
which sold its Venezuelan bank to the nation’s government in
2009 as President Hugo Chavez pressured local lenders.  Since October, the lender has announced sales of stakes in
its Brazilian bank and U.S. auto-loans unit to bolster capital.
In February, Santander agreed to sell 51 percent of its Latin
American insurance unit to Zurich Financial Services AG for as
much as $2.1 billion. It raised $958 million by selling a 7.8
percent stake in its Chilean unit today.  ‘See You Later’  The Latin American expansion by companies including
Santander,  Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria SA (BBVA)  and  Telefonica SA (TEF) 
in the 1990s led to claims that Spanish businesses were mounting
a “reconquista,” or reconquest, of former colonies.  Ochoa, the former Santander executive, said the bank may
return to the Colombian market once it rebuilds its finances.  “It may not be a goodbye for Santander in Colombia,” said
Ochoa, now a senior director in Spain for Alvarez & Marsal Inc.,
a New York-based financial-industry consulting firm. “Maybe
it’s ‘see you later.’´´  To contact the reporter on this story:
