Global manufacturers may face a
critical shortage of 14 raw materials over the next five years
affecting industries including chemicals, aviation and renewable
energy, according to PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP.  Seven manufacturing industries may be seriously affected by
a critical shortage of raw materials “which could disrupt
entire supply chains and economies,” PwC said in a report today
based on a survey of senior executives from 69 manufacturers.  “Many businesses now recognize that we are living beyond
the planet’s means,” Malcolm Preston, PwC’s global
sustainability leader, said in the report. “New business models
will be fundamental to the ability to respond appropriately to
the risks and opportunities posed by the scarcity of minerals
and metals.”  Beryllium, used as a lightweight component in military
equipment, cobalt, used in industrial manufacturing and lithium,
used in  wind turbines  and hybrid cars, were among minerals
identified in the report as facing critical shortages. Tantalum
and flurospar will also face a shortfall, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
