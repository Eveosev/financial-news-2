 Hochtief AG,  Germany ’s largest
builder, is renewing a 2 billion-euro ($2.7 billion)  credit line 
ahead of schedule to safeguard the company in case financial
markets worsen.  “We are extending our credit line prematurely as a
precautionary matter in case the environment deteriorates,”
Hochtief spokesman Christian Gerhardus said by telephone today.
Bloomberg News had reported on Dec. 6 that the company was
seeking to extend the agreement.  The move is not motivated by Hochtief potentially
postponing the planned sale of its airports unit, Gerhardus
said. The company on Nov. 14 said the sale of the airport-
operating business is being delayed by the struggling European
economy.  “Hochtief is completely financed, and our financing is
entirely independent from the sale of our airports unit,”
Gerhardus said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
