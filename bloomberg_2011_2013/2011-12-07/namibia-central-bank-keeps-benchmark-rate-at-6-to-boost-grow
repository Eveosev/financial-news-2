Namibia’s central bank left its
benchmark  interest rate  unchanged for a sixth consecutive
meeting to help boost economic growth even as inflation
accelerates.  The repo rate was kept at 6 percent, Bank of Namibia
Governor Ipumbu Shiimi told reporters today in the capital,
Windhoek. The bank has held the rate unchanged this year after
reducing it at the last two meetings of 2010.  The economy of Namibia, the world’s biggest miner of
offshore diamonds and the fourth-largest producer of uranium,
will probably miss an initial growth forecast of 4.1 percent for
2011 as expansion in neighboring  South Africa  slows, according
to the central bank.  The decision is in line with the central bank of its
neighbor, which kept its benchmark rate at 5.5 percent last
month.  Namibia ’s currency is pegged to the South African rand
and the central bank generally follows monetary policy set by
the South African Reserve Bank.  Inflation in Namibia climbed to 6.1 percent in October, the
fastest pace since February last year, as food and fuel costs
increase, the statistics office said on Nov. 15.  To contact the reporter on this story:
