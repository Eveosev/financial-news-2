Nova Ljubljanska Banka d.d. purchased
350 million euros ($471 million) of Slovenia’s Treasury bills,
or 40 percent of the total amount on sale, Finance newspaper
reported, citing people from one of the country’s banks it
didn’t name.  The rest of the 18-month Treasury notes were mostly bought
by investors from outside Slovenia, the Ljubljana-based
newspaper said. The euro-region nation yesterday raised 907
million euros with the sale of Treasury bills at an average
yield of 3.99 percent to repay debt maturing early next year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
