China ’s interest-rate swaps climbed
for a second day after the People’s Bank of China drained cash
from the financial system, damping speculation of further
monetary easing.  The central bank withdrew 100 billion yuan ($15.7 billion)
yesterday via sales of  one-year bills  and 28-day  repurchase
contracts , according to Liu Junyu, a bond analyst at China
Merchants Bank Co. in Shenzhen. A total of 35 billion yuan ($5.5
billion) of bills and repurchase contracts will mature in the
rest of this week, he said. The PBOC lowered the reserve-
requirement ratio for banks by 50 basis points last week, the
first reduction since 2008.  “The capital withdrawal shows the central bank may want to
maintain the status quo of the current monetary policy,” said
Liu. “It doesn’t want the capital system to be flush with
capital after injecting more than 300 billion yuan through the
reserve-ratio cut.”  The one-year swap contract, the fixed cost needed to
receive the floating seven-day repurchase rate, rose two basis
points to 2.75 percent as of 10:29 a.m. in  Shanghai , according
to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The seven-day  repurchase rate , which measures interbank
funding availability, gained 13 basis points to 3.50 percent,
according to a weighted average rate compiled by the National
Interbank Funding Center.  The yield on the 3.44 percent government bond due June 2016
fell four basis points, or 0.04 percentage point, to 3.06
percent, according to the Interbank Funding Center.  China’s finance ministry sold at least 28 billion yuan of
three-year bonds at an average yield of 2.82 percent, according
to a trader at a  finance company  that participates in government
debt auctions.  --  Judy Chen , Fion Li. Editors: Andrew Janes, James Regan  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
