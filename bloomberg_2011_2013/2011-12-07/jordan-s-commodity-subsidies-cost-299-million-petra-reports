Subsidies for commodities and fodder
products cost Jordan’s government 212 million dinars ($299
million) this year, the state-run  Petra  news agency reported.  The kingdom has strategic reserves of wheat and barley, and
buys wheat from various origins, mainly the U.S., Ukraine and
 Germany , it said, citing Yanal Barmawi, a spokesman for the
Ministry of Industry and Trade. Jordanians consume about 8
million loaves of bread a day, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
