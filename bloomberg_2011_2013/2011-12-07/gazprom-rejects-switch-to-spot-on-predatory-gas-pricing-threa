OAO Gazprom , Russia’s gas export
monopoly, rejected a move to tie European prices to the  spot
market  and cut the existing link to oil and refined prices,
saying it could expose producers to “predatory pricing.”  Spot prices, which European customers have asked the
Russian gas export monopoly to factor into long-term contract
prices, should play a “subordinate, balancing role,” said
Sergei Komlev, head of pricing and contract formation at
Gazprom’s export division.  Gazprom supports “the existing dual hybrid pricing
model,” Komlev said today at a conference in Moscow. Switching
to 100 percent spot indexation or de-linking oil and gas prices
“is unacceptable to gas producers because it will create
opportunities for predatory pricing.”  European customers have sought lower gas prices while
facing oversupply in  Europe  and a gap between spot and long-term
prices. Gazprom supplied 7 percent of total gas supplies to
Europe at prices linked to spot rates last year after revising
contracts with customers, including EON AG’s Ruhrgas unit,  Eni
SpA (ENI)  and  GDF Suez (GSZ)  SA, according to a November bond prospectus.  Gazprom is also holding pricing talks with European
importers and has entered arbitration with at least four
companies during the past year, according to the prospectus.  Gas importers in Europe buy about two-thirds of their fuel
under long-term contracts. Gazprom indexes its prices to oil
with a lag of as long as nine months.  To contact the reporter on this story:
