Matjaz Kovacic, the chief executive
officer of  Nova Kreditna Banka Maribor (KBMR)  d.d., will resign as
Slovenia’s second-biggest bank by assets copes with mounting bad
loans.  Kovacic, who’s been at the helm of the Maribor-based lender
since 2005, will be replaced by Andrej Plos, a member of the
management board, from Jan. 1, Nova Kreditna said in an e-mailed
statement today.  The bank wants to ensure stability, continuity and better
results to boost its share price, according to the statement.  The bank, majority-owned by the Slovenian government, last
month reported its first loss since it sold shares to the public
in 2007 on bad loan provisions. The consolidated loss for the
nine-month period totaled 4.4 million euros ($5.9 million),
compared with a 20.3 million-euro profit in the same period a
year earlier, the bank said Nov. 29.  Nova Kreditna advanced 5.1 percent today to close at 3.5
euros in Ljubljana, the biggest gain in a week. The stock lost
66 percent of its value this year, giving the bank a market
value of 137 million euros.  To contact the reporter on this story:
