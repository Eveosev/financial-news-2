(Corrects to say insurgency started 31 years ago in first
paragraph.)  Sendero Luminoso, the Marxist
guerrilla group that began an armed insurgency against the
Peruvian state 31 years ago, is ready to disarm and pursue its
political aims democratically, IDL-Reporteros  said .  The group is willing to call a truce and destroy its
weapons publicly in exchange for an amnesty for its members,
Jose Flores, Sendero Luminoso’s leader in  Peru ’s central jungle
region of Huallaga, said in an interview with the Lima-based
magazine.  Flores said his request for an amnesty was rejected by
President Ollanta Humala and by previous governments, according
to the magazine.  To contact the reporters on this story:
