AstraZeneca Plc (AZN) , the U.K.’s second-
biggest drugmaker, said earnings per share will be at the low
end of its forecast, hurt by research setbacks.  The company will take a charge of $381.5 million in the
fourth quarter after two experimental medicines had
disappointing results, London-based AstraZeneca said in a
statement today.  A medicine called olaparib for ovarian cancer won’t move to
the next stage of clinical trials and an advanced study of
another drug for patients with major depressive disorder did not
meet its goal, AstraZeneca said.  Core earnings per share will likely be “in the lower
half” of the company’s $7.20 to $7.40 estimate in the fourth
quarter, the statement said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
