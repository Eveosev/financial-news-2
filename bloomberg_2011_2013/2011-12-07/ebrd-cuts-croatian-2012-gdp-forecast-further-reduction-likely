The  European Bank for Reconstruction
and Development  reduced its 2012 growth forecast for  Croatia  to
1.9 percent from a forecast of 2.8 percent in July and said a
further reduction could follow.  The next forecast, expected in January, “will likely go
downward,” Peter Sanfey, the bank’s lead economist, told
journalists in Zagreb today. “We have not foreseen the extent
of the crisis in the European economy when we were putting
together this forecast.”  Earlier this week, Zdeslav Santic, chief analyst at  Soc-Gen
Splitska Banka d.d. , said the economy will contract 2.1 percent
next year, while Hrvoje Stojic, chief economist at Hypo Alpe-
Adria-Bank d.d., a local unit of  Austria ’s Hypo Alpe-Adria-Bank
International AG, said it will contract 2 percent in 2012.
Central bank Governor Zeljko Rohatinski said in October growth
should be “mild” and similar to projected 2011 growth of 0.5
percent.  To contact the reporter responsible for the story: Jasmina
