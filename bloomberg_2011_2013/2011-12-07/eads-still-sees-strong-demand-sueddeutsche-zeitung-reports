European Aeronautic, Defence and
Space Co. Chief Executive Officer  Louis Gallois  said the company
is not in “crisis mode,” and demand for aircraft remains
strong,  Sueddeutsche Zeitung  reported, citing an interview.  He said the company is “relatively well protected” with
“high liquidity” of about 11 billion euros ($14.8 billion) and
a strong order backlog, according to the newspaper in an e-
mailed preview of an article to appear in tomorrow’s edition.
Gallois said  EADS (EAD) ’s profitability will “increase
significantly” in 2012, Suddeutsche added.  The newspaper cited the CEO as saying the markets need
“strong and clear” messages on how the authorities intend to
handle the euro crisis.  To contact the reporter on this story:
