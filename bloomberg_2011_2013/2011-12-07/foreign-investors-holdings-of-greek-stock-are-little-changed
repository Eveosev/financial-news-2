Foreign investors’ holdings in
companies listed on the Greek stock exchange were little changed
last month from a year earlier, according to data released by
 Hellenic Exchanges SA (EXAE) , the operator of the Athens bourse.  Non-resident investors held 49.1 percent of the market
value of all stocks listed on the  Athens Stock Exchange (ASE)  in
November, compared with 50.4 percent in November 2010. In
October, foreign investors owned 51.4 percent.  Greece’s benchmark ASE share index lost 15.6 percent in
November, after former Prime Minister  George Papandreou  said on
Oct. 31 he planned a referendum on the terms of a second
bailout, roiling markets and placing Greece’s commitment to the
euro in question.  Foreign investors accounted for 41.6 percent of total
turnover in November, according to today’s statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
