Russia may allow foreign airlines to
fly domestic routes, so-called “cabotage,” in response to a
request from Kontinental Hockey League clubs,  Vedomosti  reported

be granted to Holidays Czech Airlines and Air Baltic, the
newspaper said.  A Yakovlev-42 airliner crashed near Yaroslavl in September,
