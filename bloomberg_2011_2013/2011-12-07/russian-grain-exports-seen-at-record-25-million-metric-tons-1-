Russia’s grain exports probably will
be at least 25 million metric tons in the current marketing
season, a record, said Alexander Solovyev, deputy agriculture
minister.  Russia’s grain-exports potential may double in 15 to 20
years because of improving yields and increasing the area of
land used for agriculture, Solovyev said today at a conference
in Moscow. Russia sees the Asia Pacific market as one of the
most promising, Solovyev said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
