The European Union wants a decision
by all countries at this year’s climate talks that they are
willing to join a process to reach a globally-binding deal by
2015,  Poland ’s lead envoy said.  “The 2015 date is an important one,” Tomasz Chruszczow,
Poland’s chief envoy to the talks, said in an interview. “It’s
the year when the review of the Copenhagen pledges is due to
assess if they are enough to close the emissions gap.”  “By 2015 we will also have a new report from the IPCC,
which will show us where we are in terms of reaching the 2
degrees Celsius target,” said Chruszczow, whose country holds
the rotating EU presidency until the end of the year.  Other nations’ support for the road map that would lead to
a globally binding deal enacted by 2020 is an EU condition for
adopting further emission-reduction targets under the  Kyoto
Protocol  after its current limits expire in 2012.  To contact the reporters on this story:
