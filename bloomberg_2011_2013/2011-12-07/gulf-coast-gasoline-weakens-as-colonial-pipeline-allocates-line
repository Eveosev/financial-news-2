Gulf Coast gasoline weakened as
Colonial Pipeline Co. allocated shipments of the fuel linking
the region to the East Coast, leaving supplies stranded at the
U.S. refining hub.  Colonial will allocate capacity on its gasoline Line 1 for
the segment north of Collins,  Mississippi , for cycle 69, the
company said in a statement to shippers.  The discount for reformulated, 87-octane gasoline in  the
Gulf Coast market  widened 2.5 cents to 6 cents versus futures
traded on the New York Mercantile Exchange at 12:38 p.m.,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Prompt delivery fell
7.41 cents to $2.5363 a gallon.  Hovensa LLC’s St. Croix refinery in the  U.S. Virgin Islands 
returned to normal production levels after finishing
maintenance. “Work was completed on several units, including
one of the sulfur complexes and the acid plant,” David
Roznowski, a spokesman for the company, said in an e-mail
yesterday.  Reformulated, 87-octane gasoline in New York Harbor held at
a premium of 0.88 cent a gallon against futures.  To contact the reporter on this story:
