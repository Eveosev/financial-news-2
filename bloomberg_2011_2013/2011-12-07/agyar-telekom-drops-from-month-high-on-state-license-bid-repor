Magyar Telekom Nyrt. (MTEL) , Hungary’s
former phone monopoly, dropped from a month-high after Napi
Gazdasag newspaper reported that a state group will bid tomorrow
for a mobile-telephone license.  The shares fell 2.9 percent to 507 forint by the close in
Budapest, its first daily decline since Nov. 25. The stock was
unchanged yesterday at 522 forint, the highest level since Oct.
27, first reached two days ago. The benchmark BUX index of
shares slid 0.9 percent to 17,209.27.  Hungary’s state-owned electricity wholesaler MVM Zrt. plans
to bid for a mobile-telephone license together with the
country’s postal service and state-owned Magyar Fejlesztesi Bank
Zrt., Napi Gazdasag reported. Magyar Telekom, which competes
with units of  Vodafone Group Plc (VOD)  and  Telenor ASA (TEL) , may be hurt by
the arrival of a “powerful” state-backed fourth rival,
according to brokerage Equilor Befektetesi Zrt.  “The news may have a negative effect on Magyar Telekom,”
 Akos Kuti , a Budapest-based analyst at Equilor, and colleagues
wrote in a research report. “The fourth player may put an end
to the golden age of the current trio.”  Hungary’s economy will probably grow between 0.5 percent
and 1 percent in 2012, less than a previous forecast of 1.5
percent, Economy Minister Gyorgy Matolcsy told reporters today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
