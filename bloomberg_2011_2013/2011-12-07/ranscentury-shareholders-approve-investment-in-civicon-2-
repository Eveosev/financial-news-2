TransCentury Ltd. , a Kenyan investor
in infrastructure projects, said shareholders approved an
investment in Civicon Ltd.  Shareholders voted in a meeting yesterday to approve a
transaction that will leave  TransCentury  with a controlling
stake in Civicon, a civil and mechanical engineering company
with operations in five East African nations, Yida Kemoli,
TransCentury’s head of corporate finance and strategy, said in a
phone interview today. He declined to give the value of the
acquisition pending regulatory approvals.  TransCentury owns 34 percent of Rift Valley Railways, the
operator of the Kenya-Uganda railway line, and also makes  power
lines  through units including  South Africa ’s  Kewberg Cables  and
 East African Cables Ltd. (EACL) , the region’s biggest cable
manufacturer. A transformer factory in  Tanzania  makes switch
gears used in power facilities.  TransCentury’s  shares  rose 1.9 percent to 28.50 shillings
at the 3 p.m. close in Nairobi. The stock had plunged 53
percent, almost triple the drop on the benchmark index, since it
started trading in July. The company reported a profit of 468.3
million shillings ($5.2 million) in 2010, double the year-
earlier figure, as revenue rose 26 percent.  The acquisition of Civicon will have an “impact” on
TransCentury’s profit, though whether it will be reflected in
this year’s financials depends on whether the transaction is
completed this month, Kemoli said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
