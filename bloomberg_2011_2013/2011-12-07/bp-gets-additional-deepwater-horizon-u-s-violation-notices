BP Plc , which got five additional
U.S. violation notices tied to the 2010 Gulf of Mexico oil
spill, said it plans to appeal all citations related to
operations on a drilling rig leased by the company.  BP, based in  London , didn’t conduct accurate tests on the
well it drilled off the Louisiana coast, and failed to suspend
operations when they became unsafe, the Interior Department said
today in a statement on the notices.  “The issues raised in today’s Incidents of Non-Compliance
regarding drilling margins and related integrity testing played
no causal role in the accident,” BP spokesman  Scott Dean  said
in an e-mail. “BP intends to appeal these INCs, as well as
those issued several weeks ago.”  BP, which owned the failed well, was cited for seven
violations on Oct. 12, when the Interior Department issued
notices to  Transocean Ltd. (RIG) , owner of the rig BP leased to drill
the Macondo well, and  Halliburton Co. (HAL) , which provided cement
that was being prepared to seal the well.  To contact the reporter on this story:
