The  New York Mets  traded
centerfielder Angel Pagan to the  San Francisco Giants  for
reliever Ramon Ramirez and added two free-agent pitchers from
the Toronto  Blue Jays  bullpen, the New York Times said.  The Pagan trade, which also included Giants outfielder
 Andres Torres , is contingent on the players passing physicals,
the Times reported, citing a person familiar with the deal.  Pagan, 30, who hit .262 with 68 runs scored, 56 runs batted
in and seven home runs last season, was traded the day after Mets
manager Terry Collins told reporters at the Major League
Baseball Winter Meetings in Dallas that he expected Pagan to be
his leadoff hitter next season.  Paganâ€™s exit came a day after  Jose Reyes  agreed to join the
Miami Marlins after nine seasons with the Mets. Reyes, 28,
hit .337 last season to become the first Mets player to win the
National League batting title.  Going into the free-agent market, the Mets also signed Blue
Jays relievers Jon Rauch to a one-year agreement and Frank Francisco to a two-year contract, the Times said.  Rauch, 33, pitched 52 innings last season, finishing with
11 saves and a 4.85 earned run average. Francisco, 32, pitched
50 2/3 innings, with 17 saves and a 3.55 ERA.  Ramirez, 30, allowed 54 hits in 68 2/3 innings for the
Giants with 66 strikeouts. Torres, 33, hit .221 with 19 steals
in 112 games.  To contact the reporter on this story:
