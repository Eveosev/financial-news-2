Swiss unemployment remained at the
lowest in almost three years in November, suggesting the labor
market is still robust even as economic growth is cooling.  The jobless rate held at 3 percent when adjusted for
seasonal swings, the State Secretariat for Economic Affairs in
Bern said in an e-mailed statement today. Thatâ€™s the lowest
since January 2009 and in line with the median forecast of 11
economists in a Bloomberg News survey.  The unadjusted jobless rate rose to 3.1 percent from 2.9
percent in October, according to the statement. The number of
job openings fell by 1,355 to 17,395 in November.  To contact the reporter on this story:
