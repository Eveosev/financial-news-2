U.S. stocks rose, sending the  Dow
Jones Industrial Average  to the highest level since October,
amid optimism that European leaders will announce further
efforts to halt the debt crisis at a summit this week.  JPMorgan (JPM)  Chase & Co. and Bank of America Corp. rose at
least 1.9 percent to lead gains in the Dow. Financial shares
increased the most among groups in the Standard & Poor’s 500
Index, rallying 1.2 percent after an earlier loss.  Caterpillar
Inc. (CAT)  dropped 1.1 percent, pacing declines among industrial
companies, while Peabody Energy Corp. fell 3.4 percent after
Goldman Sachs Group Inc. cut its ratings on coal producers.  The S&P 500 climbed 0.2 percent to 1,261.01 at 4 p.m. New
York time, after dropping as much as 1.1 percent earlier. The
benchmark gauge for American equities advanced 1.1 percent over
the previous two sessions. The Dow rose 46.24 points, or 0.4
percent, to 12,196.37.  “You can’t ignore the potential for another rally if
 Europe  comes up with proposals that the market deems credible,”
 Hank Smith , chief investment officer at Haverford Trust Co. in
Radnor,  Pennsylvania , said in a telephone interview. His firm
manages about $6.5 billion. “We might have not just a Santa
Claus rally but a flat out melt-up.”  The S&P 500 has struggled to make any  headway (SPX)  this year,
trading 0.3 percent higher for 2011, as the euro area’s debt
crisis spread to the 17-nation currency’s larger economies. The
index dropped 19 percent between April 29 and Oct. 3 before
paring the decline to 7.5 percent. It has erased its 2011 loss
six times since the beginning of October.  Banks Rally  Financial shares in the S&P 500 rallied 1.2 percent,
erasing an earlier loss of 1.4 percent. JPMorgan climbed 2.3
percent, the most in the Dow, to $34. The biggest U.S. lender by
assets “may or may not” buy back more stock, CEO Dimon wrote
in an investor presentation. Bank of America added 1.9 percent
to $5.89, reversing an earlier decline of 1.4 percent.  Energy stocks and utility companies lost the most among
groups in the S&P 500, slipping 0.7 percent and 0.3 percent,
respectively.  Coal producers declined after Goldman Sachs cut its view on
the industry to “neutral” from “attractive,” citing proposed
regulations from the Environmental Protection Agency. Peabody
Energy fell 3.4 percent to $36.95.  Arch Coal Inc. (ACI)  slipped 3.4
percent to $15.77.  Alpha Natural Resources Inc. (ANR)  retreated 0.9
percent to $24.66.  Caterpillar, the world’s largest maker of construction and
mining equipment, lost 1.1 percent to $94.89 for the biggest
drop in the Dow.  First Solar Inc. (FSLR)  advanced 4.1 percent to $47.99.  Warren
Buffett ’s MidAmerican Energy Holdings unit agreed to buy the
company’s $2 billion Topaz Solar Farm project in  California .
Financial terms weren’t disclosed.  SAIC, Talbots  SAIC Inc. (SAI)  had the second-biggest advance in the S&P 500,
rising 6.6 percent to $12.95. The defense contractor
specializing in computer services reported third-quarter sales
that beat analysts’ estimates.  Talbots Inc. (TLB)  surged 70 percent to $2.65. The purveyor of
women’s apparel said it would “evaluate” Sycamore Partners
LP’s offer to buy the retailer for $212 million. The private-
equity firm had said in a regulatory filing that it had offered
to acquire all of the company’s shares for $3 apiece.  NYSE Euronext (NYX)  fell 3.9 percent to $27.28. Raymond James
Financial Inc. reduced its fourth-quarter earnings forecast for
the owner of the New York Stock Exchange to 49 cents a share
from 57 cents, citing lower trading volume.  Erasing a Loss  The S&P 500 erased an earlier loss in the final hour of
trading today after Nikkei reported that the Group of 20 nations
is considering a $600 billion  International Monetary Fund 
lending program to halt Europe’s debt crisis. Stocks trimmed
gains in the final minutes as CNBC said the IMF denied the
report.  Pressure on Europe’s leaders to halt the spread of the
region’s debt crisis at a summit this week intensified as the
European Union had its AAA long-term rating put on “creditwatch
negative” by S&P following a similar action on 15 of the 17
euro-area government. The action “does not have any impact on
the sovereign credit ratings on non-Eurozone members of the
European Union,” John Piecuch, director of communications at
S&P, said in an e-mail.  “All this proves is the fact that we remain in a headline-
driven environment,” Ryan Larson, Chicago-based head of U.S.
equity trading at RBC Global Asset Management Inc., wrote in an
e-mail.  ECB Actions  Three euro-area officials with knowledge of policy makers’
deliberations said the  European Central Bank  may announce a
range of measures tomorrow to fight the crisis. Options for the
ECB include loosening collateral criteria so that institutions
have more access to cheap ECB cash and offering them longer-term
loans, said the officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
German Chancellor  Angela Merkel  and French President Nicolas Sarkozy will argue for rewriting European Union treaties to
tighten control of national budgets at a summit meeting tomorrow
and on Dec. 9.  “It’s difficult to get a bottom line outcome on the
European situation,” Philip Dow, director of equity strategy at
Minneapolis-based RBC Wealth Management which oversees about
$160 billion, said in a telephone interview. “Macro concerns
are driving the market,” he said. “It’s a challenging
environment to manage money.”  Record Correlation  Never before has the euro influenced U.S. stocks as much as
this year, a sign that American equities aren’t going anywhere
until Europe’s credit crisis is solved.  The link between the Dow average and swings in the currency
reached a record on Dec. 2, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The so-called correlation coefficient showing how
much two markets rise and fall in tandem hit 0.85, the highest
level since the euro was founded in 1999, data on 60-day rolling
averages show. A reading of 1 means assets are moving in
lockstep.  U.S. stocks are likely to form a “significant” bottom in
2012 before entering a new  bull market , according to Bank of
America Corp.  After a drop of as much as 18 percent, the  S&P 500  might
reach a low in the second quarter before climbing back to the
upper part of its trading range near the 1,300 to 1,350 level by
the end of 2012, Mary Ann Bartels, head of technical and market
analysis at Bank of America’s Merrill Lynch unit, wrote in a
note dated yesterday. A bull market is commonly defined as a 20
percent rally from the latest low.  Bartels cited the Decennial pattern, which examines the
performance of every year within the decade. Years that ended in
two, such as 1932, 1942, 1962, 1982 and 2002, featured market
bottoms, she said.  “2012 could become the next year where a major market low
is carved out to launch a new cyclical bull market,” wrote
Bartels, who ranked third among analysts who study price charts
in Institutional Investor’s 2010 survey.  To contact the reporter on this story:
