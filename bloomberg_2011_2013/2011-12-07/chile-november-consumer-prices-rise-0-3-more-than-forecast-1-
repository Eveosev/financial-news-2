Chile ’s consumer prices rose 0.3
percent in November from the month before, pushing up annual
inflation, the National Statistics Institute said.  The median estimate of 14 economists surveyed by Bloomberg
was for consumer prices to rise 0.1 percent in November from
October.  Annual inflation  quickened to 3.9 percent from 3.7
percent in October and monthly  core inflation  was 0.2 percent,
the institute said in a report today.  The central bank, which targets 3 percent inflation, has
kept  borrowing costs  unchanged at 5.25 percent since July.
Inflation has accelerated every month since then, even as the
economy weakens, expanding at its slowest pace in more than 18
months in October. The government and central bank are prepared
to stimulate the economy if  Europe ’s debt crisis damps growth
further, policy maker Manuel Marfan said Dec. 5.  “We are worried about the north wind in the global economy
and how the transmission mechanisms can arrive to our coast,”
he said in an interview in Santiago. “We have a very
maneuverable set of policies with lots of degrees of freedom
both on the fiscal side and the monetary side.”  Two-year interest rate swaps, which reflect traders’ view
of average borrowing costs, fell 2 basis points to 4.28 percent
yesterday.  While Chile has left rates unchanged,  Brazil  has cut three
times since August. Brazil’s gross domestic product contracted
0.04 percent in the third quarter from the previous three
months, compared with an expansion of 0.64 percent in Chile.  To contact the reporter on this story:
