Former Croatian premier Ivo Sanader,
currently on trial for graft, will be released on bail, his
lawyer Cedo Prodanovic said, citing a  Constitutional court 
decision.  Sanader may be let out of the Remetinec prison near Zagreb
“as soon” as Dec. 12, Prodanovic told state radio today. The
Constitutional court overruled an earlier decision by the
 district court , where Sanader is standing trial for corruption
and abuse of office, to reject bail offered at 12.4 million kuna
($2.2 million), according to Prodanovic.  Sanader is accused of taking a bribe of 10 million euros
($13.6 million) from  Hungary ’s largest refiner  Mol Nyrt. (MOL)  between
2008 to 2009, when he was premier. In exchange, he arranged with
Mol’s chairman Zsolt Hernadi to give it controlling rights over
Croatian refiner  INA Industrija Nafte d.d. (INARA)  in a January 2009
shareholding agreement, according to prosecutors. Sanader and
Mol have denied the accusations.  In the same trial, Sanader is also accused for corruption
and abuse of office in the case involving Austria’s Hypo Alpe-
Adria-Bank International AG.  Sanader, 58, was elected premier in 2003 and 2007, and left
office without explanation in 2009. He was arrested in December
last year in Austria on an international arrest warrant and was
extradited to  Croatia  in July this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
