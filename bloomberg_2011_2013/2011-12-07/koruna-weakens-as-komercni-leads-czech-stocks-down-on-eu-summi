The koruna weakened for a second day
and Czech stocks fell, led by  Komercni (KOMB)  Banka AS, amid
speculation the European Union will not agree on ways to contain
the region’s debt crisis at a summit starting tomorrow.  The Czech currency slid 0.4 percent to 25.341 per euro by
4:42 p.m. in Prague. Komercni, the Czech unit of Societe
Generale SA, dropped 3.8 percent to 3,194 koruna, the worst
performer in Prague and dragging the PX index 1.1 percent lower
at the close of trading.  Global stocks fell and the euro weakened against the dollar
after a German government official said the EU’s largest country
rejects proposals to combine the current and permanent euro-area
rescue funds and is pessimistic about the outcome of this week’s
summit. The region is the main market for Czech exports, which
account for about 70 percent of the country’s economic output.  To contact the reporter on this story:
