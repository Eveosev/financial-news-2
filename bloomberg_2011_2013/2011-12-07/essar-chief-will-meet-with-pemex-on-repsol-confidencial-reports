Prashant Ruia, Essar Group’s chief
executive officer, will meet with Petroleos Mexicanos CEO  Juan
Jose Suarez Coppel  in Mexico today to inform him of Essar’s
intention to buy the 10 percent of Spain’s  Repsol YPF SA (REP)  that
Sacyr Vallehermoso wants to sell,  El Confidencial  reported.  An Essar Energy spokesman, who declined to be identified,
said the report was incorrect as the company is focused on
 India .  Essar is one of five parties contacted by Sacyr, which owns
20 percent of Repsol, El Confidencial said, citing unidentified
people with knowledge of the matter.  Essar must get approval to buy the stake from Pemex, which
signed a shareholder agreement with Sacyr in August to syndicate
their  voting rights  in Repsol, the newspaper added.  To contact the reporter on this story:
