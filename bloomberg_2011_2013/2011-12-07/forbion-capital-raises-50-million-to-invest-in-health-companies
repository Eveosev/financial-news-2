Forbion  Capital Partners  raised about
$50 million for a second fund to invest in health-care companies
that are close to being sold.  The fund made its first investment in  CircuLite Inc. , a
U.S. developer of devices to treat heart failure, the Dutch firm
said in an e-mailed statement today.  Forbion’s first FCF 1 Co-Investment Fund, which raised 54
million euros ($72 million), has made six investments. One of
those companies, BioVex Group Inc., was purchased by  Amgen Inc. (AMGN) 
in January for as much as $1 billion. Another company in
Forbion’s portfolio, Pathway Medical Technologies Inc., was sold
in September to  Bayer AG (BAYN)  for $125 million, the firm said.  “We raised this second FCF 1 Co-Investment Fund in just a
few weeks in difficult markets,” Sander Slootweg, a managing
partner at Forbion, said in the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
