Tesco Plc (TSCO) , the world’s third-largest
retailer, promoted U.K. Property Services Director Kevin Grace
to the new position of group commercial director and appointed
him to the executive committee.  Grace, whose previous roles include chief executive officer
of Cheshunt, England-based Tesco’s Polish division and chief
operating officer in  South Korea , will report directly to CEO
 Philip Clarke , according to an internal memorandum obtained by
Bloomberg. He has been U.K. property services director since
2006.  The executive, who joined the company 29 years ago, will
help the supermarket chain improve how it obtains products and
services globally, according to the memo. John Hoerner, who will
continue to act as an adviser to Clarke, will “hand over” to
Grace, according to the document, which didn’t say when the
appointments will take effect.  Hoerner was brought in to advise Clarke on the global
sourcing of Tesco’s non-food products, the Financial Times
reported on Sept. 25.  To contact the reporter on this story:
