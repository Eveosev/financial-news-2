Yandex NV , operator of Russia’s most
popular Internet search engine, climbed the most in more than a
week after a British newspaper reported news announced by the
company last month that they will team up with Facebook Inc.  Yandex gained 3.5 percent to $21.62 by 12:43 p.m. in  New
York , after earlier jumping as much as 6.6 percent to $22.26,
the biggest intraday advance since Nov. 28.  The Telegraph newspaper said today that Yandex’s music
service would be integrated with Facebook, citing a report that
appeared in the Moscow News last month. Yandex, based in  The
Hague ,  Netherlands , said its Yandex.Music app would be available
on the Facebook site in a Nov. 17 statement on its website.  “We hope to increase the number of users via cooperation
with Facebook, there is a huge potential for growth,” Ochir
Mandzhikov, a Yandex spokesman, said by phone from Moscow today.
“We will share musical content with Facebook to get additional
attention from the potential customers.”  Yandex started its music hosting service in September last
year and currently has 2.7 million tracks, allowing customers to
share music, Mandzhikov said.  Palo Alto , California-based
Facebook is the world’s biggest social-networking company.  To contact the reporter on this story:
