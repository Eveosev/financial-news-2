Iceland’s parliament, Althingi, today
passed the island’s 2012 budget, which is designed to bridge a
42 billion-kronur ($354 million) shortfall in public finances,
according to the legislature’s website.  The equivalent of a value-added tax will be imposed on the
north Atlantic island’s lenders, while the government plans to
raise taxes for the use of natural resources, along with an
increase in capital gains taxes.  To contact the reporter on this story:
