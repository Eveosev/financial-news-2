-- Ukrainian international reserves
declined in November from the previous month as the central bank
spent dollars to keep the hryvnia stable.  Reserves fell 5.14 percent to $32.41 billion, the lowest
level since July 2010, the Natsionalnyi Bank Ukrainy, based in
the capital, Kiev, said today in a  statement  on its website.
Reserves were $34.16 billion at the end of October and $34.95
billion in September, according to central bank data.  The central bank controls the  exchange rate  by buying and
selling dollars on the  interbank market . Ukraine’s $15.6 billion
stand-by loan program with the  International Monetary Fund  has
been on hold since March because of the government’s failure to
raise natural-gas rates for households.  The hryvnia lost 0.03 percent against the dollar in
November, Bloomberg data show.  The central bank plans to keep the hryvnia steady, Governor
Serhiy Arbuzov said Dec. 5. The regulator wants to increase
reserves by selling so-called investment coins to individuals,
“attracting more than $10 billion,” Arbuzov said. The
country’s aim to pay Russia for natural gas imports in rubles
instead of dollars will also save $8 billion of reserves, he
said without elaborating.  To contact the reporters on this story:
