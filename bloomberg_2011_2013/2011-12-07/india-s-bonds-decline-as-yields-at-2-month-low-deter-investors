India ’s 10-year bonds declined as
yields at the lowest level in two months deterred buyers.  The notes issued by the  finance ministry  snapped a five-day
gain after Finance Minister  Pranab Mukherjee  said today
inflation has remained “obstinately high.” The benchmark
wholesale-price  index  rose 9.73 percent in October from a year
earlier, staying above 9 percent for the eleventh month,
according to government data.  “Bonds have probably rallied too much and there was some
profit-taking,” said  Anoop Verma , a fixed-income trader at
Development Credit Bank in Mumbai. “High inflation may also
erode the value of fixed-income securities.”  The rate on the 8.79 percent bonds due November 2021 rose
one basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 8.60 percent,
according to the central bank’s trading system. The rate touched
8.51 percent earlier, the lowest rate for a benchmark 10-year
note since Sept. 30. Local financial markets were closed
yesterday for a holiday.  The cost of one-year interest-rate swaps, or derivative
contracts used to guard against fluctuations in borrowing costs,
rose one basis point to 7.92 percent, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
