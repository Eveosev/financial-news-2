U.S. stocks were little changed, with
the  Standard & Poor’s  500 Index recovering from an earlier drop
triggered by Standard & Poor’s warning that it may cut the
European Union credit rating and ratings on lenders including
BNP Paribas SA and Deutsche Bank AG.  The  S&P 500  rose less than 0.1 percent to 1,258.93 at 3:26
