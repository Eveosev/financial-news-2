Pitcher  Mark Buehrle  will rejoin
former manager Ozzie Guillen on the Marlins, becoming the third
free agent to sign with Miami this week, Fox Sports reported.  Buehrle, 32, was a four-time All-Star and had a 161-119
record in 12 seasons with the  Chicago  White Sox. He will sign a
four-year, $58 million contract with the Marlins, Fox reported,
without saying where it got the information.  The left-hander will be reunited in Miami with Guillen, his
manager the past eight seasons in Chicago. Guillen signed a
four-year deal in late September with the Marlins.  Guillen, who did not confirm the report of Buehrle’s
signing, said he would be very satisfied if it’s true.  “I’m very happy to have this kid, he’s one of my favorite
players,” Guillen told reporters at baseball’s Winter Meetings
in  Dallas . “Buehrle can pitch anywhere, this kid is special.”  Marlins spokesman Matt Roebuck said he had no comment on
the report and that he didn’t expect the team to make any more
announcements today.  The Marlins today introduced shortstop Jose Reyes, the
second free-agent All-Star to join the team at the Winter
Meetings. The signing of Heath Bell, who saved 132 games for the
San Diego Padres the past three seasons, was announced two days
ago.  Reyes won the National League batting title last season by
hitting .337 for the  New York Mets .  To contact the reporter on this story:
