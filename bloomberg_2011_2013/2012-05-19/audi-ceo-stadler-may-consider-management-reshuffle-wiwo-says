Volkswagen AG (VOW) ’s Audi brand may make
management changes as it prepares to expand in China, Latin
America and the U.S., German magazine  WirtschaftsWoche  reported,
citing an interview with Chief Executive Officer Rupert Stadler.  “Against the backdrop of Audi’s 2020 strategy, it would be
negligent not to think about the team line-up,” Stadler was
cited as saying. No decisions have been taken yet, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
