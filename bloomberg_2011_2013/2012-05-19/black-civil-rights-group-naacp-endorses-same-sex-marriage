The NAACP, the oldest and largest
black civil rights group in the U.S., yesterday endorsed same-
sex marriage. Its board of directors voted to adopt a resolution
that the group would support marriage equality and oppose local,
state or national legislative efforts to block gay marriage.  “Civil marriage is a civil right and a matter of civil
law,” NAACP President Ben Jealous said in a statement.  The resolution follows President  Barack Obama ’s statement
this month that he believes gay couples have the right to marry
and polls that show an increasing number of Americans have a
favorable view of the issue.  “It’s time the shameful myth that the African-American
community is somehow out of lockstep with the rest of the
country on marriage equality is retired -- once and for all,”
 Joe Solmonese , president of the Human Rights Campaign, the
largest gay rights organization in the U.S., said in a
statement. “The facts and clear momentum toward marriage speak
for themselves.”  The NAACP is based in Baltimore.  To contact the reporter on this story:
