The European Commission plans to
phase out solar and wind-power subsidies as soon as possible,
 Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung  reported, citing a strategy paper
Energy Commissioner Guenther Oettinger will present next month
in Brussels.  European Union countries have to increase the flexibility
of their plans and reduce subsidies because renewable energy
technology has developed much faster than expected and prices
have dropped, the newspaper said, citing the paper.  To contact the reporter on this story:
