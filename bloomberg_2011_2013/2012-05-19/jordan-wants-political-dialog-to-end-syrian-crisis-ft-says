Jordan wants to start a political
dialog to resolve the crisis in  Syria , the Financial Times
reported, citing an interview with the minister of foreign
affairs Nasser Judeh.  The country has refused to back either the regime of
President Bashar Al-Assad or the rebel forces seeking to
overthrow his rule, the FT said. There are fears the uprisings
will weaken Jordanâ€™s economy and political stability, the U.K.
newspaper reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
