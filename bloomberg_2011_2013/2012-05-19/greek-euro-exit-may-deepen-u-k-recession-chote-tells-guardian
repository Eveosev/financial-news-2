(Corrects to “threatens to” in first paragraph of story
originally published May 19.)  A Greek exit from the euro threatens
to send the U.K. into a recession equal to the downturn in 2008
and 2009,  Robert Chote , chairman of the U.K.’s  Office for Budget
Responsibility , told the Guardian in an interview.  “The concern is that you end up with an outcome in the
euro zone that creates the same sort of structural difficulties
in the financial system and in the economy that we saw in the
past recession,” Chote told the newspaper. “That has
consequences both for hitting economic activity in the economy,
but also its underlying potential.”  Chote said the deepening crisis in the euro area may force
him to revise his forecast made two months ago that the U.K.
economy would grow 0.8 percent this year. A second deep
recession may cause permanent damage to the economy, he said.  “You go down and you never quite get back up to where you
started,” he told the Guardian.  To contact the reporter on this story:
