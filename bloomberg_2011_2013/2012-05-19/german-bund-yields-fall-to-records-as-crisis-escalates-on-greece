German 10-year bonds rose for a fifth
week, pushing yields down to records, as heightened concern
 Greece  will withdraw from the euro area boosted demand for the
region’s safest securities.  Two-, five- and 30-year  yields  also declined to all-time
lows while the bonds of AAA rated Finland and the Netherlands
advanced. Investors snapped up bunds as  Fitch Ratings  downgraded
Greece and Moody’s Investors Service cut the ratings of 16
Spanish banks. Gross domestic product in the  euro region 
stagnated last quarter, a European Union report showed May 15.  “Everybody is afraid of Greece leaving the  euro zone  or
getting bankrupt,” said Christian Reicherter, an analyst at DZ
Bank AG in  Frankfurt . “Risk-off trades are in at the moment.
There’s no resistance in sight” even after the decline in bund
yields, he said.  Germany ’s 10-year  yield  fell nine basis points, or 0.09
percentage point, this week to 1.43 percent at 4:02 p.m. London
time yesterday. The 1.75 percent bond due in July 2022 gained
0.8 or 8 euros per 1,000-euro face amount, to 102.975. The yield
declined to a record 1.396 percent.  The  two-year  yield dropped four basis points this week to
0.06 percent after sliding to an all-time low 0.31 percent.
Five-year yields slid to a record 0.463 percent, and 30-year
rates fell as low as 1.396 percent.  AAA Rated  Investors are favoring bonds from Germany and  Europe ’s
other remaining AAA rated countries as the financial crisis that
started in 2009 shows no signs of ending. The selloff escalated
after elections in Greece on May 6 failed to produce a clear
winner and saw the Syriza party, which wants to annul the
country’s bailout, finish in second place.  Economists predict euro-area reports next week will show
 consumer confidence  declined in May, while manufacturing and
services industries contracted.  Spain ’s borrowing costs surged this week on concern banking
losses will widen amid an increase in  bad loans , the recession
and restricted funding access. Moody’s yesterday downgraded the
nation’s largest banks including Banco Santander SA and Banco
Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria SA by three levels, citing a recession
and loan losses.  Spain’s 10-year  bond yield  rose 24 basis points this week
to 6.25 percent, after surging above 6.50 percent for the first
time since Nov. 29. Italian 10-year yields climbed for a second
week, rising 28 basis points to 5.78 percent.  German bonds returned 3 percent this year through May 17,
according to indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the European
Federation of Financial Analysts Societies. Spanish bonds lost
3.6 percent, and Italian debt gained 8.1 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
