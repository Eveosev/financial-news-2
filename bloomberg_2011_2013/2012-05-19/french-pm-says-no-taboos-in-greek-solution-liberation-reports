French Prime Minister Jean-Marc Ayrault said no potential solutions to the Greek debt crisis
should be regarded as “taboo” when European heads of state meet
on May 23,  Liberation  reported, citing an interview.  Measures such as allowing states to borrow directly from
the  European Central Bank  should not be excluded from
discussions, the new premier said, according to the newspaper.  “A climate of uncertainty” in  Europe  is driving Greece to a
“panic” over banks and contributing to political instability,
Liberation quoted Ayrault as saying.  A report from the French state audit board on the status of
public accounts should be delivered by June so that President
Francois Hollande’s government can plan to offset new expenses
with equivalent savings as it seeks to cut the public deficit to
zero by the end of his five-year term, Liberation said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
