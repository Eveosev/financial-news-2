The  New York  Rangers defeated the New
Jersey Devils 3-0 to take a two-games-to-one lead in the
National Hockey League’s Eastern Conference finals.  Dan Girardi, Chris Kreider and  Ryan Callahan  scored third-
period goals yesterday at the Prudential Center in Newark, New
Jersey, and Henrik Lundqvist made 36 saves in the New York goal
for his NHL-best third shutout of the playoffs.  “That means so much to me to win every game here and it’s
so important to me and to the group,” Lundqvist told reporters.
“But on Monday, it’s not going to mean anything. You have to
start over and earn that respect again, and hopefully you say
the same thing after that game.”  New Jersey hosts Game 4 in the best-of-seven series
tomorrow.  After two scoreless periods, the Rangers broke on top 3:19
into the third with a power-play goal as Girardi tipped Brad Richards’s shot past Martin Brodeur.  Kreider made it 2-0 less than two minutes later with
another tip-in, and Callahan’s empty-net goal clinched the
victory with 2:13 remaining in the game. Brodeur made 19 saves
in the Devils goal.  The series winner plays the  Los Angeles Kings  or the
Phoenix Coyotes for the  Stanley Cup . The Kings lead the Western
Conference finals 3-0 and can clinch their first trip to the
title round since 1993 with a home win today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
