BiteSize Entertainment is developing
a movie about Rebekah Brooks, the former head of  News Corp. (NWSA) ’s
British publishing unit, the  Hollywood Reporter  said, citing
producer Gene Kirkwood.  The project about Brooks, who has been charged with trying
to cover up the tabloid phone-hacking scandal, is in its early
stages of development, with no writer, director, or budget,
Kirkwood told the publication.  Kirkwood and partner Ross Elliot, who have optioned the
rights to the Vanity Fair article “Untangling Rebekah Brooks,”
will fold Kirkwood-Elliot Productions into the movie venture
with  Ron Bloom , chief executive officer of online video site
Mevio,  Hollywood Reporter  said.  Brooks faces three charges of conspiracy to pervert the
course of justice, Alison Levitt, the principal legal adviser to
Britain’s Director of Public Prosecutions, said on May 15.
Brooks has said she is “baffled by the decision to charge”
her.  To contact the reporter on this story:
