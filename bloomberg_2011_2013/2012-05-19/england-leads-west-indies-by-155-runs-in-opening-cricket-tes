England  leads West Indies by 155 runs
after being dismissed for 398 on day three of the opening
cricket Test at Lord’s in London.  Captain Andrew Struass was top scorer with 122 and Ian Bell
had 61 in the response to West Indies’s first-innnings total of
243. Shannon Gabriel, making his Test debut, and Kemar Roach
each claimed three wickets for the visitors.  England is undefeated in its last 12 Tests at Lord’s since
losing the 2005 Ashes Test at the venue.  West Indies hasn’t won an overseas Test in a country other
than bottom-ranked Bangladesh since winning in South Africa in
December 2007. The Caribbean team hasn’t won an away series
against anyone other than  Bangladesh  and Zimbabwe in 17 years.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
