Andy Pettitte  recorded his first
 Major League Baseball  win since coming out of retirement as the
 New York Yankees  topped the Cincinnati Reds 4-0 in interleague
play.  Pettitte, 39, last won a game on July 8, 2010, in a 3-1
Yankees victory against the Seattle Mariners. After recovering
from a groin injury, he posted a 5-2 win over the  Minnesota
Twins  in the American League Division Series on Oct. 7 that year
before retiring.  Pettitte, 39, ended his one-season retirement in March and
rejoined the Yankees May 13 in  New York , taking a 6-2 loss
against the Mariners after working his way back into shape in
the minor leagues.  Pettitte (1-1) went eight innings tonight at Yankee Stadium,
allowing four hits, while walking one and striking out nine for
a 2.51 earned run average. He threw 115 pitches, including 78
strikes.  Alex Rodriguez  drove in Curtis Granderson in the fourth
inning while Robinson Cano added a solo home run and Raul Ibanez
contributed a two-run homer in the eighth inning.  Bronson Arroyo (2-2) gave up four runs on nine hits with
one walk and four strikeouts in 7 2/3 innings.  Pettitte went 11-3 with a 3.28 earned run average in 21
starts during his last season for the Yankees in 2010, when he
was limited by a groin injury in the second half.  The left-hander retired before the 2011 season, saying he
didn’t have the hunger to play even though his pitching arm felt
fine. He didn’t rule out a return at the time and on March 16
this year signed a one-year, $2.5 million contract with the
Yankees.  To contact the reporter on this story:
