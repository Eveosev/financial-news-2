German Chancellor  Angela Merkel  said
Europe needs to find a balance between sound budget policies and
growth-enhancing measures to foster confidence.  “Solid fiscal policy, in the form of the fiscal compact,
and growth initiatives belong closely together,” Merkel said
today in her weekly podcast. “That’s the only way to restore
confidence in our common currency, the euro.”  Germany’s economy is performing well, she added.  To contact the reporter on this story:
