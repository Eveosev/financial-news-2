Notonthehighstreet.com, a U.K. craft-
business website, has secured 10 million pounds ($15.8 million)
in funding, the Financial Times reported, without saying where
it got the information.  Fidelity Growth Partners  Europe  leads the financing,
supported by Index Ventures and  Greylock Partners , valuing the
company at almost 100 million pounds, the FT said.  The website, founded by Holly Tucker and Sophie Cornish,
has created a marketplace for independent craft businesses that
didnâ€™t have an online presence, the FT said. The capital will be
used for marketing the brand in the U.K., the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
