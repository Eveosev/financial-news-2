Robin van Persie  may price himself
out of a move from Arsenal with his high wage demand, the Daily
Mail said.  Van Persie , whose contract expires after next season, met
with Arsenal this week withouth reaching a new agreement. Heâ€™ll
now join the Netherlands in preparation for the European
Championship.  Arsenal will demand a tranfer fee of more than 20 million
pounds and van Persie wants to be paid in line with players such
as Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo, who make about 275,000
pounds per week, the Mail said. Real Madrid, Barcelona and
Manchester City are all interested in the Dutchman, but may be
put off by his salary demand, the newspaper said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
