Leinster routed Ulster 42-14 in an
all-Irish Heineken Cup rugby final to become the second team to
win two straight titles.  Sean O’Brien, Cian Healy, Heinke van der Merwe and  Sean
Cronin  scored tries at Twickenham Stadium in London as Leinster
matched the record of the  Leicester Tigers  in 2001 and 2002.
Leinster, which won its third title in four seasons, set marks
for most points and biggest winning margin in the final of
Europe’s elite club competition.  The Dublin-based club finished with eight wins and a draw
to become the first team to go unbeaten during an Heineken Cup
campaign.  Dan Tuohy scored a try and Ruan Pienaar kicked three
penalties for Belfast-based Ulster, which was seeking its first
title since 1999.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
