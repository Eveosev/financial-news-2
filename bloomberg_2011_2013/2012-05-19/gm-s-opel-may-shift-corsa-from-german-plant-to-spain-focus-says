General Motors Co. (GM) ’s Opel unit is
looking at shifting production of its Corsa model away from
Eisenach in Germany,  Focus  magazine reported, without saying
where it got the information.  Opel chief Karl-Friedrich Stracke has ordered an internal
evaluation of whether the Corsa could be moved after 2014 when a
new version comes out, Focus said. GM’s Zaragoza plant in  Spain 
might benefit from such a plan, it said.  Without the Corsa, the Eisenach factory’s future would be
entirely dependent on the success of a smaller “mini” model
scheduled to be built there from 2013 and targeting sales of at
least 100,000 a year, the magazine said.  GM said May 17 it will concentrate production of an updated
Opel Astra at plants in England and  Poland  and end construction
of the model in Ruesselsheim, Germany.  To contact the reporter on this story:
