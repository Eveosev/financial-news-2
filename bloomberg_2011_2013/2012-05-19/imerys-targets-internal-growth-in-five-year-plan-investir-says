Imerys SA (NK)  is prioritizing internal
research and development to propel a 700 million-euro ($895
million) expansion in sales through 2016,  Investir  reported,
citing an interview with Chief Executive Officer Gilles Michel.  The French minerals processor aims to expand in countries
where growth potential is strong and it isn’t “sufficiently”
represented -- such as Thailand, Malaysia and Turkey -- as well
as Brazil, China and India, where the company has already
reached “critical mass,” Michel said, according to Investir.  To contact the reporter on this story:
