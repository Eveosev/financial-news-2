Wolfgang Bosbach , chairman of the
domestic affairs committee in Germany’s lower house of
Parliament, or Bundestag, said  Greece  should leave the euro
region to overhaul its economy,  WirtschaftsWoche  reported,
citing an interview.  “That would clear the way for new growth,” Bosbach was
quoted as saying in an e-mailed pre-release of a story that will
run in the May 21 issue of the German magazine. “Then we could
also talk about some kind of European Marshall Plan for
Greece.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
