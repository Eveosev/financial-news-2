A mission to send the first unmanned
commercial spacecraft to the International Space Station was
aborted less than a second before liftoff today after a computer
detected an engine problem.  Space Exploration Technologies Corp.’s Falcon 9 rocket,
carrying the Hawthorne, California-based company’s Dragon
capsule, attempted to lift off at 4:55 a.m. from  Cape Canaveral ,
 Florida .  The launch was rescheduled for May 22, with a back-up date
the following day.  The closely held company, known as SpaceX and led by
billionaire Elon Musk, was trying to make history by docking its
vehicle with the station. The U.S. retired its own shuttle fleet
last year and relies on other countries for rides to space. It
wants the private sector to take over the job of ferrying
supplies to and from the lab.  “This is not a failure,” Gwynne Shotwell, president of
SpaceX, said during a National Aeronautics and Space
Administration press conference after the launch attempt. “We
aborted with purpose. It would be a failure if we were to have
lifted off with an engine trending in this direction.”  Engine Five  The engines ignited and rumbled momentarily before going
silent. An on-board computer aborted the launch a half-second
before liftoff after detecting high pressure in engine five,
possibly caused by a fuel valve malfunction, Shotwell said. An
inspection later today found a faulty valve on the engine, and
it was to be replaced tonight.  “The software did what it was supposed to do -- aborted
engine five, and it went through the remaining engine
shutdown,” she said. The Falcon 9 rocket needs all nine engines
for liftoff and seven to achieve orbit.  The problem was similar to one that occurred during the
maiden flight of the Falcon 9 in 2010, Shotwell said. That
mission was also scrubbed, though only temporarily.  NASA , which has worked with SpaceX on the launch, streamed
the pre-dawn liftoff live on its website. The attempted launch
followed almost three years of delays and featured an overhauled
capsule that was “fundamentally a new spacecraft,” Shotwell
said yesterday.  International Partners  It was to be the third flight of the Falcon 9 rocket.
Three-quarters of the world’s families of rockets had at least
one failure in the first three flights, according to research
cited in a press kit distributed by SpaceX days before the
launch.  Nine out of 10 launch failures are caused by engine
malfunctions, stage separation mishaps or avionics problems,
according to the 31-page document.  Only spacecraft developed by the governments of the U.S.,
 Europe ,  Japan  and  Russia  have docked with the station, which
orbits about 240 miles above Earth. None of those vehicles has
the ability to return significant amounts of science experiments
to Earth, as the manned shuttle did and as the Dragon capsule is
designed to do.  The spacecraft held more than 1,000 pounds of cargo such as
food, clothing and lab equipment as well as student science
experiments. The supplies were deemed “non-critical” to the
space station mission.  Shuttle Retired  NASA retired the shuttle in July before companies such as
SpaceX and  Orbital Sciences Corp. (ORB) , based in Dulles,  Virginia ,
proved they could resupply the station. The Obama administration
a year earlier canceled a program to develop a shuttle
successor, betting the private sector would offer lower costs.  SpaceX and Orbital have been awarded a total of almost $700
million in NASA contracts to develop the ability to deliver
cargo to the station, and another $3.5 billion for 20 resupply
missions slated to begin this fall.  The decision to rely on commercial technology to carry
supplies starting in 2012 and astronauts in 2017 “is inherently
risky because the vehicles are not yet proven and are
experiencing delays in development” according to a March report
by the Government Accountability Office, Congress’s
investigative arm.  NASA doesn’t have agreements with its Russian, Japanese and
European partners beyond 2016, according to the report. If those
deals and the commercial launches don’t work out, “the
situation could lead to a potential cargo shortfall,” the GAO
said.  SpaceX’s Dragon capsule was scheduled to separate from the
rocket about 10 minutes after liftoff, according to Shotwell.  It was to spend the first 24 hours essentially catching up
to the station. Early May 21, it was to perform a fly-by at a
distance of 1.5 miles to test sensors and flight systems before
attempting to dock early May 22.  The mission follows a planned May 7 liftoff that was
postponed to test software. The flight to the station was
initially projected for June 2009.  To contact the reporter on this story:
