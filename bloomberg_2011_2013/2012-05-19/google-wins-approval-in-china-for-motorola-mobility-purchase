Google Inc. (GOOG)  won approval from Chinese
regulators for its $12.5 billion purchase of  Motorola Mobility
Holdings Inc. (MMI) , clearing a final hurdle for a deal that boosts
its patents portfolio and steps up competition with  Apple Inc. (AAPL)   “We are pleased the deal has received approval in all
jurisdictions,” Motorola Mobility said in an e-mailed
statement, confirming that the deal has been approved in China.
“We expect to close imminently.”  The acquisition, announced last year, has already received
approvals in Europe, the U.S. and other jurisdictions worldwide.
Motorola Mobility had said in a  regulatory filing  in February
that it needed approval in China.  Google, facing legal disputes over its Android smartphone
software, will be able to draw on more than 17,000 patents from
Libertyville, Illinois-based Motorola Mobility. The acquisition
is the largest wireless-equipment deal in at least a decade,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  “Our stance since we agreed to acquire Motorola has not
changed and we look forward to closing the deal,” Mountain
View, California-based Google said in an e-mailed statement. The
company also confirmed it had received word from Chinese
authorities of the purchase being approved.  Google fell 3.6 percent to $600.40 yesterday in  New York 
trading. The shares have fallen 7 percent this year. Motorola
Mobility closed unchanged at $39.20. The stock is up 1 percent
year to date.  To contact the reporter on this story:
