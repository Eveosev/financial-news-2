Generali Deutschland Holding AG (GE1)  plans
to increase lending to companies to diversify its investments,
 Boersen-Zeitung  reported, citing an interview with the insurer’s
Chief Financial Officer Torsten Utecht.  “We’re expanding our credit exposure, hence loans to
medium-sized companies would be of interest for us for
diversification,” Utecht was quoted by Boersen-Zeitung as
saying. While the company still lacks the know-how to compete
with banks, it plans to invest to build expertise, he said, the
newspaper reported.  Generali is generating yields of 3.5 percent to 4 percent
on new investments, Utecht said, according to Boersen-Zeitung.
The company isn’t currently buying German  government bonds  and
the share of sovereign debt in its portfolio is declining, he
added, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
