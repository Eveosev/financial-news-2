Hearts routed Hibernian 5-1 in the
first all-Edinburgh Scottish Cup soccer final since 1896.  Rudi Skacel scored two goals and Darren Barr, Danny
Grainger and Ryan McGowan had one each at Hampden Park in
Glasgow as Hearts won its eighth Scottish Cup title and first in
six years. Hearts scored their final three goals after Hibernian
defender Pa Kujabi was sent off for a second yellow card in the
47th minute.  James McPeak scored for Hibs, which was trying to win the
title for the first time since 1902.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
