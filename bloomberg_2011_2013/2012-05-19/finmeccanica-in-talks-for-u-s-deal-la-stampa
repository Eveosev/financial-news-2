Finmeccanica SpA (FNC)  is in talks with the
U.S. Department of Transportation over contracts central to a
$150 billion five-year upgrade of the country’s railroads, La
Stampa reported, without saying where it got the information.  Italy’s No. 1 defense company aims to be prime-contractor
on the projects, part of President Barack Obama’s Transportation
Investment Generating Economic Recovery or TIGER program, via
its  Ansaldo STS SpA (STS) , AnsaldoBreda SpA and Selex Sistemi
Integrati SpA divisions, the newspaper said, adding that work
will be worth $58 billion in the first year alone.  Italian Prime Minister  Mario Monti  spoke with Obama by
telephone about possible cooperation, according to La Stampa,
which also cited letters between Monti’s office and Florida
Representative Corrine Brown, the ranking member on the House
Subcommittee on Railroads, Pipelines and Hazardous Materials.  Rome-based Finmeccanica declined to comment when contacted
by Bloomberg News today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
