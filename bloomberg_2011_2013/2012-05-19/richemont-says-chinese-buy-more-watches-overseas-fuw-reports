Cie Financiere Richemont SA (CFR)  Chairman
and Chief Executive Officer Johann Rupert said more Chinese
customers are buying watches in Hong Kong, Macau and Europe,
Finanz und Wirtschaft reported.  The buying outside mainland China is being spurred by lower
prices and tax incentives, the Swiss newspaper cited Rupert as
saying in an interview. As much as half the watch sales in
Europe are to tourists, mostly from China, Rupert said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
