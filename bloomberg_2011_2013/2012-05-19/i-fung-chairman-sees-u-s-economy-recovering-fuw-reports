(Corrects to say soft landing in second paragraph.)  Victor Fung, chairman of  Li & Fung
Ltd. (494) , said increasing orders from American customers indicate
that there is only a small risk of the U.S. economy slipping
into recession, Finanz und Wirtschaft reported.  China’s economy will experience a “soft landing” and
rising wages will force Chinese companies to increase
productivity by investing in technology, Fung told the Swiss
newspaper in an interview.  To contact the reporter on this story:
