One student died and several were
injured after a bomb exploded in front of a school in the
southern Italian city of Brindisi, a police official said.  The device was probably put into a garbage bin in front of
the  Morvillo Professional Institute , the police official, who
declined to be identified, said in a telephone interview after
today’s blast. One of the students is in a very serious
condition, he said, without giving further details.  Italy is on maximum alert for terrorism after recent
attacks targeting the tax-collection agency Equitalia and this
month’s shooting of a nuclear-industry executive in Genoa, la
Repubblica reported May 13, citing Interior Minister Anna Maria
Cancellieri. The Brindisi school is named after anti-mafia
prosecutor Giovanni Falcone’s wife, Francesca Morvillo, a judge
who was killed in a 1992 bombing in Sicily along with her
husband and several police officers.  “The government aims to firmly fight every kind of crime
and promotes cohesion among political and social parties to
prevent the return in our country of subversive temptations,”
Prime Minister  Mario Monti  said in an e-mailed statement after
speaking with President Giorgio Napolitano.  The bomb exploded shortly before 8 a.m. when students were
entering the school to attend lessons, Antonio Manganelli,
national police chief, said on SkyTG24.  Investigators are working on “several hypotheses,”
Interior Minister Anna Maria Cancellieri told the news channel,
without elaborating. “It’s an anomalous fact, which worries
us,” she said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
