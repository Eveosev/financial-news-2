Aston Martins of the sort favored by
rock stars, boxing champions,  James Bond , the Prince of  Wales 
and a Scottish laird starred in a $10.3 million auction.  The weekend sale was led by a DB4GT Zagato Sanction II
Coupe formerly owned by Tony Smith, manager of the singer  Phil Collins , which fetched 1.2 million pounds ($1.9 million) with
fees. Bonhams held its 13th annual sale at the U.K. automaker’s
factory in Newport Pagnell, Buckinghamshire.  Prestigious marques, as well as originality, are
increasingly sought-after by collectors in today’s choosy
classic-car market, dealers said. The Aston Martin brand, ever-
popular for its 007 associations, was given a lift last year
when the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge drove in the  Prince of
Wales ’s DB6 convertible after their wedding service.  The 1991 Zagato, one of only four Sanction II Coupes made,
is capable of 153 miles per hour and has covered less than 5,000
miles, said Bonhams. It was first owned by Smith, a racer and
collector of classic cars, and was being sold by a German owner.
It was bought by a telephone bidder for a hammer price that was
below the presale valuation of 1.2 million pounds to 1.5 million
pounds.  A 1962 DB4 Vantage Convertible was one of the most original
cars in the sale. Bought new for 4,513 pounds by the late
Reginald Gwynn, the U.K. managing director of Woolworth’s, it
had remained in the same family and was contested to 611,900
pounds, the second-highest price of the sale. It had been
estimated at 320,000 pounds to 360,000 pounds.  Laird’s DBS Estate  A 1963 DB5 Convertible and a 1971 DBS Estate attracted
above-estimate  prices  of 488,700 pounds and 337,500 pounds
respectively. Both had been owned by the same families since the
mid-1970s. The custom-made estate had been ordered by a Scottish
laird for fishing trips and was valued at 50,000 pounds to
70,000 pounds.  Five owners were listed for a 1985 V8 Vantage Saloon that
had been converted by the Aston Martin factory into a replica of
the car that actor Timothy Dalton drove in the 1987 Bond movie
“The Living Daylights.” Offered for sale at 90,000 pounds to
120,000 pounds, complete with the 22-page invoice for the car’s
conversion costing 135,000 pounds, it was one of eight cars that
failed to sell.  A 1994 limited-edition Virage Coupe, formerly the owned by
the former World Champion boxer Lennox Lewis, sold for a mid-
estimate 17,825 pounds.  The 46 cars and 162 lots of memorabilia in this latest
Newport Pagnell auction raised 6.5 million pounds against a
forecast of 5 million pounds and 6 million pounds, based on
hammer prices. The equivalent event last year tallied 6 million
pounds with fees. All but two of the 45 cars in the 2011 auction
found buyers.  Information:  http://www.bonhams.com/   (Scott Reyburn writes about the art market for Muse, the
