Vale SA (VALE3)  plans to fight a Swiss
government tax claim against the company for 212 million Swiss
francs ($226 million), Le Temps  reported , citing an interview
with Renato Neves, president and director of Vale International.  The case may reduce the appeal of  Switzerland  to
multinationals, Neves told the Swiss newspaper.  A spokeswoman for Rio de Janeiro-based Vale, who can’t be
named in line with company policy, declined to comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
