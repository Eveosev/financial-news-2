German vacationers are avoiding
 Greece  amid violent protests over the countryâ€™s response to the
fiscal crisis, even as tour operators offer discounts,  Euro am
Sonntag  reported, citing an interview with Michael Tenzer,
tourism chief at  Thomas Cook  Group Plc.  German bookings for Greece until the beginning of the
summer season fell 30 percent from a year earlier, Tenzer told
the newspaper. Thomas Cook is passing on discounts of as much as
20 percent from airlines and hotel operators, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
