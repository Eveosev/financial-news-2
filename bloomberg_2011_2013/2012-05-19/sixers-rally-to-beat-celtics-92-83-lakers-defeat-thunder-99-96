The Philadelphia 76ers charged back
from an 18-point deficit to defeat the  Boston  Celtics 92-83 and
even their National Basketball Association second-round playoff
series to two games each.  In the Western Conference semifinal, the Los Angeles Lakers
won 99-96 over the Oklahoma City Thunder, who have a 2-1 lead in
their best-of-seven series.  At Wells Fargo Center in Philadelphia, Andre Iguodala and
Evan Turner each scored 16 points and Lou Williams added 15 for
the 76ers, who trailed 46-31 at halftime.  “I don’t even know where to start,” Philadelphia coach
Doug Collins told reporters. “Our guys are pretty amazing. They
really are.”  The 76ers were down by 18 points in the third quarter
before they rallied. Philadelphia hit 25 of 36 free throw
attempts compared with Boston, which connected on 16 of 19 foul
shots.  Paul Pierce  had 24 points and Brandon Bass and Rajon Rondo
each had 15 points for the Celtics, who host Game 5 on May 21.  The winner of the best-of-seven series will play the Miami
Heat or Indiana Pacers who meet tomorrow night at Bankers Life
Fieldhouse in Indianapolis. The Pacers have a 2-1 lead.  At Staples Center in Los Angeles,  Kobe Bryant  scored 36
points, including 18 of 18 from the free-throw line, to lead the
Lakers to their first win of the series. Andrew Bynum added 15
points and grabbed 11 rebounds.  Kevin Durant scored 31 points and  Russell Westbrook  and
 James Harden  each added 21 for the Thunder, who lost their first
game of the postseason after sweeping the Dallas Mavericks in
the first round.  The Lakers host the Thunder in Game 4 tonight, while San
Antonio visits the  Los Angeles  Clippers, who trail 2-0 in the
other Western Conference semifinal.  To contact the reporter on this story:
