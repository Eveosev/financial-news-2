The U.K.’s Ministry of Defence plans
to sell the six-acre Knightsbridge Barracks near Hyde Park in
 London  that houses about 300 soldiers and their horses,  Property
Week  reported, without saying where it got the information.  The MoD is being advised by agent CBRE on a potential sale
of the property, which includes a 200,000-square-foot tower, and
the marketing process may begin as early as next week, subject
to ministerial approval, the magazine said on its website.  The sale could raise 300 million pounds ($475 million) to
500 million pounds, according to Property Week, citing
unidentified people in the market. Apartments near the barracks
have sold for as much as 7,000 pounds a square foot, the
magazine said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
