Nine percent of  Premier Oil Plc (PMO) ’s
shareholders voted against the company’s compensation report at
this week’s annual general meeting, the Daily Telegraph
reported, without saying where it got the information.  ShareSoc, which represents private investors in the U.K.,
recommended shareholders oppose the pay resolution, the
newspaper said.  Mark Bentley , a director at ShareSoc, questioned
the oil and gas explorer’s “incredible” level of pay awards at
the meeting, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
