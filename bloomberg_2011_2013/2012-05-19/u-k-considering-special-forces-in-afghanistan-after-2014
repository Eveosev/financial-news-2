The U.K. may leave special forces in
 Afghanistan  to assist on counter-terror operations after 2014,
the date set for the withdrawal of combat troops from the
country, a British official said.  The North Atlantic Treaty Organization meets in Chicago
today with Afghanistan the main topic for discussion. The U.S.
will probably to announce it has met its target of securing
pledges of more than $1 billion a year to fund the Afghan
National Army, according to the official, who discussed security
issues on condition of anonymity.  NATO’s plans call for completing the handover of security
in all provinces to Afghanistan’s forces in 2014. After 2014,
the Western-led alliance, including a small number of U.K.
forces, would have no lead combat role.  The U.K. wouldn’t rule out leaving a small presence of as
many as 200 commandos for counter-terror purposes. The Ministry
of Defense doesn’t comment on the operations of the U.K.’s
Special Air Service and Special Boat Service regiments.  Financing the stand-alone Afghan force has taken on greater
urgency as Western allies head for the exit after more than a
decade of warfare, the longest combat operation in NATO’s
history.  Afghan soldiers and police officers totaled about 337,000
in mid-March and are scheduled to reach 352,000 this year. The
coalition has agreed with Afghan leaders to begin paring the
force after 2014 to about 230,000.  Maintaining those numbers of Afghan security forces would
cost about $4 billion, with the U.S. seeking $1.3 billion from
allies and with the Afghanistan government contributing about
$500 million annually, Assistant Secretary of State Philip Gordon told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on May 10.  To contact the reporter on this story:
