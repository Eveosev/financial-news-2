U.K. government bonds  advanced for a
fourth week, driving five- and 10-year yields to record lows, as
deepening turmoil in the euro region spurred demand for the
relative safety of gilts.  The pound fell the most against the dollar since the five-
day period ending Nov. 25 after the  Bank of England  cut its
growth forecasts in its quarterly Inflation Report, adding to
speculation policy makers will resume their program of bond
purchases to boost the economy. Gilts surged as Greek political
party leaders meeting in  Athens  failed to form a permanent
government. A new election has been called for June 17.  “Gilts have primarily been driven by  Greece ,” said Eric Wand, a fixed-income strategist at Lloyds Banking Group Plc in
 London . “The Inflation Report was also supportive of the notion
that the asset-purchase facility may be restored. While the
uncertainty remains, core markets such as gilts are going to
stay well bid.”  The 10-year  yield  fell 14 basis points, or 0.14 percentage
point, this week to 1.83 percent at 5 p.m. London time
yesterday, when it dropped to 1.808 percent, the lowest since
Bloomberg began compiling the data in 1989. The 4 percent bond
due March 2022 rose 1.325, or 13.25 pounds per 1,000-pound
($1,581) face amount, to 119.43.  The five-year yield fell to a record 0.799 percent
yesterday.  Euro ‘Storm’  Bank of England Governor  Mervyn King  said at a May 16 press
conference that the U.K. faced threats from the euro region’s
“storm,” adding that the economy will remain “subdued.”  The central bank halted its quantitative-easing program at
325 billion pounds on May 10 amid concern inflation is
quickening. It will release minutes of the meeting on May 23.  The pound traded at $1.5788, a 1.8 percent drop on the
week. The currency fell to $1.5733 yesterday, the lowest level
since March 16. Sterling was at 80.61 pence per euro, 0.3
percent lower than its May 11 close, after touching 79.51 pence
on May 16, the strongest since November 2008.  U.K. inflation slowed to the lowest rate since September
2010 in April, a report will say next week, according to
economists surveyed by Bloomberg.  The pound has appreciated 3.9 percent in the past three
months, the third-best performer of 10 developed-nation
currencies tracked by Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes.
The dollar gained 4.2 percent and the yen 4.9 percent, while the
euro was 0.6 percent stronger.  Gilts have returned 0.9 percent this year, according to
indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the European Federation of
Financial Analysts Societies.  U.S. Treasuries  gained 1.4 percent
and German bunds returned 3 percent, the indexes show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
