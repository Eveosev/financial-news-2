(Corrects title of Martelli to IFC regional director in
first paragraph and clarifies second paragraph to say official
says it’s unclear whether other nations would vote against
loans.)  Argentina  should pay its debt with
the Paris Club group of creditor nations if it wants to continue
receiving foreign investment, said Paolo Martelli, director for
Latin America of the World Bank’s International Finance Corp,  La
Nacion  reported.  It’s unclear whether other nations will follow the U.S.
government’s decision to vote against loans to Argentina in the
World Bank and Inter-American Development Bank until the country
pays defaulted debt, Martelli said, according to the Buenos
Aires-based newspaper.  To contact the reporter on this story:
