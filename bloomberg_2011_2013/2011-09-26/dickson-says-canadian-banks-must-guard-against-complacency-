The head of  Canada ’s financial-
system regulator said Canadian banks must guard against
“complacency” and increase investments in risk controls.  Canadian financial institutions handled risk well leading
up to the financial crisis and “weathered the storm in good
order,” said Julie Dickson, superintendent of the Office of the
Superintendent of Financial Institutions.  “We must not become complacent,” Dickson said in the
prepared text of a  speech  to be delivered at the Economic Club
of Canada in Toronto today. “Canadian financial institutions
must continue to invest in their risk controls and systems. In
fact, control expectations are rising and spending must follow,
particularly on data aggregation.”  Dickson said many Canadian financial institutions are
responding well to the expectations.  “However, there may be a temptation on the part of some,
perhaps feeling complacent after surviving the worst of the
global crisis, to imagine that improvements in areas such as
risk management, governance and  information systems  are not
necessary.”  She warned banks not to act as if they have “more leeway
while others catch up to them, in the meantime allowing them
even more flexibility to grow and expand.”  Dickson said OSFI expects Canadian financial institutions
to meet  capital requirements  set by the Basel, Switzerland-based
 Bank for International Settlements  “early in the transition
period,” which starts January 2013. The standards are known as
“Basel III.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
