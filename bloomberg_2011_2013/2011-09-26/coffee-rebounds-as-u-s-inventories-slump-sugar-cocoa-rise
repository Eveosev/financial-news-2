Coffee futures rose the most in
five weeks in  New York  as U.S. inventories extended a slump to
the lowest in 11 years. Sugar and cocoa gained.  Stockpiles monitored by ICE Futures U.S. were 1.43 million
bags as of Sept. 23, down 16 percent this year and the lowest
since March 2000. Arabica-coffee futures have dropped 18 percent
this month on speculation that bigger crops from countries
including Brazil and  Vietnam  will replenish supplies.  “The recent plunge attracted some buying, and the funds
have done all the selling they had to do,” Alonso Tomas, a
trader at INTL FCStone in Miami, said in a telephone interview.
“Low stockpiles at ICE continue to support the market, and
producers are not selling.”  Arabica-coffee futures for December delivery rose 4.5
cents, or 1.9 percent, to $2.3595 a pound at 2 p.m. on ICE in
New York, the biggest gain for a most-active contract since Aug.
17. A bag weighs 132 pounds, or 60 kilograms.  In the week ended Sept. 20, hedge-fund managers and other
money managers cut net-long positions in futures by 17 percent,
government data showed.  Coffee has climbed 31 percent in the past year, partly on
global supply concerns.  In  Brazil , the world’s top grower, “plantations are
holding up well, but definitely need rain in October,” Volcafe,
the coffee-trading unit of ED&F Man Holdings Ltd., said in a
report on Sept. 23.  Rain in Brazil’s coffee belt is expected to be normal by
the second week of October, Cassia Beu, a meteorologist at Sao
Paulo-based Somar Meteorologia, said in a telephone interview.
“Dry weather has extended longer than usual.”  Raw-sugar futures for March delivery rose 0.15 cent, or 0.6
percent, to 24.28 cents a pound in New York. Cocoa futures for
December delivery advanced $44, or 1.7 percent, to $2,678 a
metric ton.  In futures trading on NYSE Liffe in  London , robusta coffee,
refined sugar and cocoa gained.  To contact the reporter on this story:
