Australia ’s economic growth in
recent years, fueled by demand for raw materials, helped the
nation weather the global financial crisis, the Financial
Stability Board said in an e-mailed statement.  “The resilience of the system largely reflected the
resilience of the economy at large,” the board said in the
statement today after a review. “An important lesson from
Australia’s experience is that strong economic fundamentals
provide a crucial bulwark against the risks of a financial
crisis.”  The panel also cited challenges the country faces,
including “structural change in response to the strong demand
for commodities from emerging Asian economies” and “the size
and nature of activities of the four big domestic banks could
pose systemic and moral hazard risks.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
