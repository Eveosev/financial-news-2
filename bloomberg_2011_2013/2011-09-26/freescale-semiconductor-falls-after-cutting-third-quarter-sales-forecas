Freescale Semiconductor Holdings,
the chipmaker mostly owned by a private-equity consortium
including Blackstone Group LP and TPG Capital, fell after
cutting its third-quarter sales forecast.  Slowing demand in its industrial and networking businesses
may push net sales for the quarter down by 6 percent to 8
percent sequentially, the Austin, Texas-based company said today
in a statement. In July, Freescale estimated sales for the third
quarter would be flat to down 3 percent.  Analog-chips go into everything from space hardware to
household electronics, making their sales an indicator of demand
across the economy. Freescale joins larger rival  Texas
Instruments Inc. (TXN)  and competitor  Intersil Corp. (ISIL)  in saying that
third-quarter revenue may not meet targets.  “The whole industry is stabilizing, but hasn’t stabilized
yet,” said Richard Schafer, an analyst at Oppenheimer & Co. who
rates the stock ‘outperform’ with a target price of $24, in an
interview today. “Freescale will have to cut its fourth quarter
sales forecast as well.”  The shares dropped 12 cents, or 1 percent, to $12.12 at
4:15 p.m. on the New York Stock Exchange. The stock has fallen
34 percent since May 26, its first trading day after its initial
public offering.  Gross margins will show a modest sequential improvement in
the third quarter, the company said today. Analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg project an average gross margin of 46.2 percent for
the current quarter, up from the 42.3 percent Freescale reported
for the second quarter.  Sales Decline  In July, the company reported a quarterly loss of $168
million, or 79 cents a share, compared with a $538 million loss,
or $2.73 a share, a year earlier. Revenue was $1.22 billion.
Analysts surveyed by Bloomberg estimate revenue of $1.19 billion
for the current quarter, a 2.5 percent decline from the prior
period.  Freescale sold 43.5 million shares at $18 each in its IPO
in May, raising 25 percent less than it originally sought. The
IPO price reflected a 50 percent discount to the average of $36
that investors paid for the company, according to a regulatory
filing.  Intersil said on Sept. 12 that third quarter revenue will
be $184 million to $188 million, down from an earlier projection
of $205 million to $213 million, citing a weakening economy.  Texas Instruments said on Sept. 8 that third quarter sales
would be $3.23 billion to $3.37 billion, down from a prior range
of $3.4 billion to $3.7 billion, due to a slump in orders from
customers across its product lines.  To contact the reporter on this story:
