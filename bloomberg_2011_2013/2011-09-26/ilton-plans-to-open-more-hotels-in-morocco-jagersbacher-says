Hilton Worldwide, acquired by
 Blackstone Group LP (BX)  in 2007, plans to open more hotels in major
cities in  Morocco , said Rudi Jagersbacher, president of the
company’s Middle East and Africa operations.  “Morocco is a strategic location for us,” Jagersbacher
said in an interview today at the Hotel Investment Conference
Africa in Casablanca. “The political turmoil in the region has
not changed anything for us.”  Demonstrations against corruption and the monarchy’s
powers began in February, prompting King Mohammed VI to promise
more liberties and a constitution aimed at bringing democratic
changes to the North African nation. Still, protests in Morocco
didn’t reach the scale of the movements that toppled leaders in
Egypt, Tunisia and  Libya .  Hilton is planning to open hotels in Tangier, Casablanca,
Marrakesh, Fez and Agadir, said Deepak Seth, vice president of
Hilton’s north and west Africa division.  The timing of the hotel openings and number of hotels will
depend on Hilton’s partners, Jagersbacher said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
