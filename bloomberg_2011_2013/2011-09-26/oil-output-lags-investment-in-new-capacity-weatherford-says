(Corrects production figure in third paragraph of story
published Sept. 26.)  Investment in worldwide production
capacity for oil grew by an average rate of 11 percent a year
from 2000 to 2010, while output increased by 1.8 percent over
the decade, a  Weatherford International Ltd. (WFT)  executive said.  “We have spent a lot of money but did not get a lot of
spare capacity in return,” said Nicholas Gee, group vice
president for completion and production at the Swiss-based
oilfield services company.  The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries did not
significantly boost its capacity during the 10-year period, Gee
told an industry conference today in Manama, Bahrain. Oil
producers will need to pump an additional 350 billion barrels by
2030, he said.  The cost of doing so will equate to $100 a barrel by 2030
as the industry moves toward developing more unconventional oil,
Gee said.  Saudi Arabia , holder of the world’s largest crude oil
reserves, will see its cost of output rise to around $40 a
barrel, he said. Gee didn’t give estimates for current Saudi or
worldwide production costs.  To contact the reporter on this story:
