The  National Basketball
Association ’s Nets will keep their nickname when the franchise
moves to New York from  New Jersey  for the 2012-13 season.  The announcement was made today during a press conference
at the site of the Barclays Center, where the  Brooklyn  Nets are
scheduled to play the 2012-13 season. Music mogul and Brooklyn
native Jay-Z, who is an investor in the franchise that is owned
by Russian billionaire Mikhail Prokhorov, will open the arena in
September of next year, the entertainer said.  “From the moment the Barclays Center became a reality,”
Jay-Z said in a statement, “I knew this meant something
significant for Brooklyn.”  The Nets will be the first major professional sports team
in Brooklyn since baseball’s Dodgers moved to  Los Angeles  in
1957.  It won’t be the first time the franchise has had a New York
 home . The franchise played at the Long Island Arena from
1968-69, the Island Garden from 1969-71 and the Nassau Coliseum,
current home of hockey’s Islanders, from 1971-77.  The Nets, who haven’t had a winning season since 2005-06,
are scheduled to play this season at the Prudential Center in
Newark, New Jersey, while their new arena is completed.  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
