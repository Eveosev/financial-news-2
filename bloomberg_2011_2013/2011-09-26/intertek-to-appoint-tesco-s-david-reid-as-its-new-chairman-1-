Intertek Group Plc (ITRK) , the world’s
largest consumer-goods testing company, said it named David
Reid, currently the chairman of  Tesco Plc (TSCO) , as its chairman
starting next year.  Reid, 64, will take over the role on Jan. 1, when Vanni
Treves retires, the London-based company said in an e-mailed
statement today. He will step down from his role at Tesco in
November.  He joined the board of the retailer in 1985, holding a
variety of positions, and leading the expansion of the group in
central  Europe , Ireland and Asia. He joined KPMG as an auditor
in 1970.  “David brings substantial board and wide-ranging business
experience to Intertek from an impressive executive and non-
executive career covering a number of large international
organizations and highly successful businesses,” Treves said in
the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
