Nigeria ’s naira weakened to the
lowest level in more than two years against the dollar,
exceeding a central bank depreciation target.  The currency of  Africa ’s biggest oil producer declined 0.9
percent to 157.90 naira in interbank trading at 4:24 p.m. in
Lagos, the weakest level since Aug. 19, 2009, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. Nigeria’s central bank sold $350 million
at a foreign currency auction today, compared with $551.3
million demanded by lenders, at 155.02 naira a dollar.  The central bank has been using foreign-currency reserves
to keep the naira within a 3 percentage-point band above or
below 150 naira per dollar at its twice-weekly auctions to help
check inflation. Today’s rate broke the band at 3.2 percent
higher.  “At the current  exchange rate , the central bank is
challenged to increase dollar supply,” Babatunde Obaniyi, an
analyst at Greenwich Trust Ltd., a Lagos-based  investment
company , said today by phone. Demand for foreign-currency
remains high due to the country’s imports of fuel and
manufactured goods, he said.  Nigeria’s central bank raised its benchmark  interest rate 
on Sept. 19 for the fifth time this year by 50 basis points to
9.25 percent to curb inflation and support the naira.  The inflation rate in the West African nation fell for a
second month to 9.3 percent in August, the lowest level in more
than three years, from 9.4 percent a month earlier, the National
Bureau of Statistics said on Sept. 14.  To contact the reporter on this story:
