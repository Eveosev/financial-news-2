Norwich beat Sunderland 2-1 to
secure its first home victory since getting promoted to English
soccer’s Premier League.  Leon Barnett opened the scoring in the 31st minute at
Carrow Road last night before Steve Morison’s 48th-minute header
doubled the lead. Norwich held on after Kieran Richardson’s low
drive made it 2-1 with four minutes left.  Norwich’s second win of the season lifts the Canaries to
ninth in the 20-team standings with eight points before they
visit league leader  Manchester United  in four days. Sunderland
stays in 14th place.  Real Betis lost the only perfect record in  Spain ’s Primera
Division last night, going down 1-0 at Getafe as Diego Castro
scored the only goal.  Seville-based Betis, which won the Spanish league
championship in 1934-35, has 12 points through five games and
leads the standings by a point from defending champion
Barcelona, Levante and Sevilla.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
