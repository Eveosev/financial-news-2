German Economy Minister Philipp
Roesler said the drop in the Ifo Business Confidence index today
shows that risks to the domestic economy have “risen
considerably.”  At the same time,  Germany  will avert a recession as the
economy continues to grow at a “moderate” pace, Roesler said
in an e-mailed statement.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
