Thailand ’s Securities and Exchange
Commission urged investors not to “panic” after declines in
the nation’s financial markets.  The financial status of publicly traded companies “remains
strong,” the market regulator said in an e-mailed statement
today. Thailand’s economy will also continue to post growth, the
regulator said.  Thailand’s benchmark stock index slumped 7.8 percent to
883.23 as of the 12:30 p.m. local time break, the most since
Oct. 27, 2008.  To contact the reporter on this story:
