The Consumer Financial Protection
Bureau will begin writing mortgage rules next month that will
back up its simplified loan disclosure forms, the agency’s top
mortgage official said.  The consumer bureau will soon wrap up testing of two-page
disclosure forms, Pat McCoy, the agency’s assistant director for
mortgage and home equity markets, said today at a Mortgage
Bankers Association conference in  Washington .  “At that point, the rulewriting process for the underlying
rules will begin,” she said.  The bureau intends to published proposed forms and
regulations by July 21 of next year, McCoy said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
