The Federation of Thai Market
Organizations urged the government to review policies that may
harm the competitiveness of the nation’s manufacturers.  “With the global economic slowdown, Thai exports will be
affected,” the group said in a statement. “We would like to
urge the government to review any policies that will affect
production costs. That includes attempts to raise minimum wages.
The hike in wages during this economic slowdown may accelerate
layoffs by manufacturers.”  The federation has proposed a gradual increase in minimum
wages, according to the statement.  The group also proposed the creation of a fund to invest in
Thai equities to help stabilize the market, and urged the
central bank not to raise  interest rates  further.  To contact the reporter on this story:
