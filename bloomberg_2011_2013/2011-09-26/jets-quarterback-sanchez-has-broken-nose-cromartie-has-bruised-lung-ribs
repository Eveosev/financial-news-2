New York  Jets quarterback  Mark Sanchez  won’t miss any time with a broken nose while cornerback
 Antonio Cromartie  is expected to play this week after suffering
a bruised lung and ribs, coach  Rex Ryan  said.  Sanchez suffered a “minor break” when he was sacked and
hit in the face by a Raiders defender during a 34-24 loss in
Oakland two days ago. He’ll wear a protective visor this week.  “It’s probably minor to everyone else, it’s probably more
than that to him,” Ryan said at a news conference yesterday.
“That happens. He’s a super competitor, he’s tough, but you’d
like to keep him from taking all those hits.”  Cromartie, who committed four penalties and fumbled a
kickoff on Sept. 25, may be able to return to practice for the
National Football League team tomorrow, Ryan said.  “I’m sure it’s painful right now, hard for him to take a
real deep breath, but some of these young guys they recover
quick,” said Ryan, who added that tight end Jeff Cumberland is
out for the season with a torn Achilles’ tendon.  After allowing 234 rushing yards and four touchdowns in the
loss to the Raiders, the Jets (2-1) play at Baltimore on Oct. 2
and then visit the  New England Patriots  on Oct. 9. It’s the
first time that New York has had three straight road games in
the regular season since 1982.  “We’re going to find out about ourselves big time the next
couple of weeks,” said Ryan, who’s taken the Jets to the
conference championship game the past two seasons. “I believe
this team will be up to the challenge.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
