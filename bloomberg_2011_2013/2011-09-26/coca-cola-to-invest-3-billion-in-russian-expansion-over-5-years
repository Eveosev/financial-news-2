Coca-Cola Co. (KO) , the world’s largest
soft-drinks maker, plans to spend $3 billion to expand in  Russia 
in the next five years, doubling its investment in the country,
said Ahmet Bozer, president of the company’s business in Eurasia
and  Africa .  Coca-Cola will expand production and sales capacity
countrywide after first-half volume rose 16 percent in Russia,
Bozer said today by phone from the southern Rostov region, where
the company opened a plant today. Bozer is Coca-Cola’s president
for its Eurasia and Africa unit.  Russians drink about 69 eight-ounce servings of Coca-Cola
products a year, compared with an average 89 worldwide. The
company has sought sales growth from Russia since the collapse
of the  Soviet Union  in 1991. U.S. consumers each guzzled 394
servings last year on average.  “Russia has a long time to go before reaching any
ceiling,” Bozer said. He is visiting the carbonated-beverage
factory with Coca-Cola Chief Executive Officer Muhtar Kent.  The Atlanta-based company, which acquired Russian juice
makers Nidan and Multon in the past six years, doesn’t have
acquisitions targeted in Russia now, Bozer said.  PepsiCo Inc. bought Wimm-Bill-Dann, Russia’s biggest food
and beverage company, this year, taking the lead in Russia’s
juice and dairy market over Coca-Cola.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
