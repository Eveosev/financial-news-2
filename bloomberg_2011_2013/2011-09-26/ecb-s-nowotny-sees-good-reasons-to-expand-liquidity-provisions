European Central Bank Governing
Council member Ewald Nowotny said there may be “good reason”
to reintroduce loans with a maturity of more than six months.  “The longest we provide now is for half a year and there
might be good reasons to enlarge this,” Nowotny said in a
speech at  Harvard University  in Cambridge, Massachusetts today.
“The banks in the situation we’re in may have adequate
liquidity, but they may have a problem finding adequate longer-
term liquidity.”  The ECB will discuss the reintroduction of 12-month loans
to lenders at its Oct. 6 policy meeting, according to a euro-
region central bank official, who spoke on condition of
anonymity because the information is confidential. The ECB last
offered a 12-month loan in December 2009.  “The banking sector has to distinguish between the
liquidity of the sector and solvency,” Nowotny said, adding
that while liquidity is the “core business of the ECB,”
solvency “is the responsibility of the respective
governments.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
