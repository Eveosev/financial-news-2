Lawsuits filed by investors in
three of J. Ezra Merkin’s hedge funds, holding him and BDO
International responsible for their losses in Bernard Madoff’s
Ponzi scheme, were dismissed by a federal judge.  U.S. District Judge  Deborah Batts  in  Manhattan  ruled that
investors in the Ascot Partners, Ariel and Gabriel Partners
funds can’t show that Merkin lied about money invested in
Madoff’s fund or that BDO, an accounting firm, ignored “red
flags” of the fraud.  “The offering memoranda and prospectuses contain warnings
sufficient to preclude a claim of intentional or reckless
misrepresentation in those documents,” Batts said in an opinion
released today. “In addition, plaintiffs’ allegations of red
flags are unavailing given the opposing considerations of
Madoff’s immense reputation and deep deception.”  The suit was filed in 2008 by a group of investors seeking
to represent a class of all the investors in the funds.  Arthur Abbey, a lawyer representing the investors, didn’t
immediately return a phone message and e-mail seeking comment on
the ruling.  Madoff, 73, is serving a 150-year term in federal prison in
 North Carolina  after pleading guilty to orchestrating history’s
biggest Ponzi scheme.  The case is In Re Merkin and BDO Seidman Securities
Litigation, 08-cv-10922, U.S. District Court, Southern District
of  New York  (Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story”:
