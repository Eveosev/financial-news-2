The opposition Labour Party’s
candidate in London’s mayoral election,  Ken Livingstone , pledged
to cut public-transport fares if he wins.  Livingstone said he’d reduce fares by 5 percent in the fall
of 2012 if elected next May. Under his program  published on his
campaign website  today, fares would be frozen in 2013 and would
not rise by more than the Retail Price Index in subsequent
years.  Livingstone, who was mayor from 2000 to 2008, faces the
incumbent,  Boris Johnson  of the  Conservative Party , in the
election. Johnson announced two weeks ago that  fares
will increase by 7 percent  in January.  “Fares must be cut -- on transport grounds to make the
system more attractive, but also on economic grounds to put
ordinary Londoners first by putting money back in the pockets
that will boost the  London  economy,” Livingstone, 66, said in
the statement, issued during Labour’s annual conference in
Liverpool, northwest  England . “These decisions will save
Londoners hundreds and in some cases thousands of pounds.”  Transport for London, which runs the capital’s buses and
subway, known as the Underground, as well as the Docklands Light
Railway, had an operating surplus during the financial year that
ended in March of 728 million pounds ($1.13 billion),
Livingstone said.  Johnson has overseen a 21.1 percent increase in fares
between 2009 and 2011, while retail-price inflation was only 8
percent over the period, Livingstone said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
