Toyota Motor Corp. (7203) ,  Asia ’s
biggest automaker, introduced a minicar in Japan today to
regain domestic sales as demand shifts toward smaller
vehicles.  The Pixis Space will sell for 1.12 million yen ($14,670)
and has a fuel economy of 25.5 kilometers per liter, the
Toyota City, Japan-based company said in a statement.  Toyota’s move follows a 29.5 percent drop in sales of
cars, trucks and buses in Japan this year through August. By
comparison, minicar sales declined 20.8 percent.  The new model is based on the Move Conte, made by
Daihatsu Motor Co., which is 51 percent owned by Toyota,
according to Bloomberg data. Toyota sold about 528,000
vehicles supplied by Daihatsu, Japan’s biggest minicar maker,
in  Japan  last year.  The Pixis Space will be assembled at Daihatsu’s factory
in Kyushu, southwest Japan.  Toyota, targeting sales of 60,000 Daihatsu-made vehicles
a year, plans to introduce a total of three minicar models
beginning with the Pixis Space, the company said last
September.  Toyota fell 1.6 percent to 2,587 yen as of 2:10 p.m. in
Tokyo trading.  To contact the reporters on this story:
