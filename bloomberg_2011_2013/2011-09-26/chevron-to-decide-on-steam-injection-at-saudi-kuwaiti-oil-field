Chevron Corp. (CVX)  expects to make a
final decision in 2013 about how much more to invest in an
effort to add as many as 6 billion barrels of crude reserves to
an oil field shared by  Saudi Arabia  and  Kuwait .  The second-largest U.S. energy company is moving ahead with
a pilot project by injecting steam into the Wafra field in a
border area between the neighboring countries after early work
showed “very promising” results, Kenneth Sniffen, a spokesman
for Saudi Arabian Chevron, said today in an interview in Manama,
Bahrain. Saudi Arabian Chevron is a fully owned subsidiary of
California-based Chevron Corp.  “The Wafra field is mature, and it’s producing at a
declining rate,” Sniffen said. “We want to add 500,000 barrels
a day to whatever amount the field will be producing once
injecting steam is applied on a large scale.”  Wafra will be the world’s largest project for recovering
oil through steam injection once Chevron applies the technique
to the entire field. The company hopes to be injecting steam
into most, if not all, of the deposit by 2017, Sniffen said.  Chevron has injected steam to help produce crude at a field
in Bakersfield,  California , for almost 50 years and at a deposit
in  Indonesia  for almost 30 years. Wafra yields about 240,000
barrels a day of light and heavy crudes, he said.  Saudi Arabia, the largest producer in OPEC, has 264.5
billion barrels of total proved crude reserves, according to the
BP Statistical Review of World Energy, published in June. Kuwait
has 101.5 billion barrels in reserves, according to the same
review.  To contact the reporter on this story:
