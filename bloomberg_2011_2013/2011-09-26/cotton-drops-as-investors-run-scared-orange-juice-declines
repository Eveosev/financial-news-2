Cotton fell for the seventh time in
eight days as a report showing a drop in U.S. home sales added
to concerns that weakening global economies will erode commodity
demand.  Orange juice  dropped to an 11-month low.  Purchases of new houses in the U.S. declined in August to a
six-month low, suggesting the industry that helped bring on the
most recent recession will take more time to recover. Cotton
prices tumbled 8.4 percent last week as  Europe ’s debt crisis
escalated.  “People are running scared after what’s happened the past
few days,”  Sid Love , the president of Joe Kropf & Sid Love
Consulting Services in  Overland Park , Kansas, said in a
telephone interview. “They’re trying to reduce their risks, and
at the first sign of trouble they say ‘here we go again,’ and
bail out.”  Cotton for December delivery fell 1.6 cents, or 1.6
percent, to settle at 99.64 cents a pound at 2:49 p.m. on ICE
Futures U.S. in  New York . The commodity has plunged 55 percent
since reaching a record $2.197 on March 7.  The drop today was probably led by selling from funds, said
Rogers Varner, the president of brokerage Varner Bros. in
Cleveland, Mississippi.  Money managers cut their combined net-long position across
18 futures and options by 20 percent in the week ended Sept. 20,
the most since February 2010, data from the Commodity Futures
Trading Commission show. Bullish bets on cotton prices dropped
9.8 percent, the most since June.  Orange-juice futures for November delivery dropped 4.85
cents, or 3.1 percent, to $1.504 a pound on ICE. The beverage
touched $1.485, the lowest since Oct. 26.  To contact the reporter on this story:
