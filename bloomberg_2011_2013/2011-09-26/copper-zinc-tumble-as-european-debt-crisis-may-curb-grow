Copper futures fell, heading for
the biggest three-session loss since December 2008, on concern
that a failure to contain  Europe ’s sovereign-debt crisis may
curb world growth and spur a slump in commodity demand.  U.S. Treasury Secretary  Timothy F. Geithner  called on
governments to unite with the  European Central Bank  to boost the
capacity of their 440 billion-euro ($592 billion) bailout fund,
warning failure to act threatened “cascading default, bank runs
and catastrophic risk.” The Standard & Poor’s GSCI Index of 24
commodities fell to the lowest since Dec. 1.  “The global economy, in particular the western economies,
are sort of in a quasi-recessionary environment,”  Bart Melek ,
an analyst at TD Securities in Toronto, said in a telephone
interview. “This means that copper-demand growth is going to
moderate for a bit.”  Copper futures for December delivery declined 8.65 cents,
or 2.6 percent, to $3.1935 a pound at 10:37 a.m. on the Comex in
 New York . A close at that price would mark a three-session drop
of 15 percent, the most since October 2008. Earlier, the metal
touched $307.15, the lowest since July 22, 2010.  Speculators were their most bearish on copper since July
2009, as managed-money funds held net-short positions, or wagers
on falling prices, totaling 6,672 futures and options contracts
as of Sept. 20, data from the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading
Commission compiled by Bloomberg showed.  Copper has the most significant “fundamental” risk of the
industrial metals because prices are well above the marginal
cost of production, analysts at Macquarie Group Ltd., including
Duncan Hobbs in London, wrote in a report today.  On the  London  Metal Exchange, copper for delivery in three
months fell $286.50, or 3.9 percent, to $7,073.50 a metric ton
($3.21) a pound.  Nickel, lead and zinc prices also fell in London. Aluminum
was little changed, and tin rose.  To contact the reporters on this story:
