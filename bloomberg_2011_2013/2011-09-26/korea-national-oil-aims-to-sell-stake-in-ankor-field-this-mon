Korea National Oil Corp., the
state-run oil developer, aims to sell part of its 80 percent
stake in a Gulf of Mexico oil field to National Pension Service
and other Korean investors to raise funds for acquisitions.  The company hired a broker to sell a 29 percent stake in
the Ankor field as early as the end of this month, the company,
known as Knoc, said in  documents  submitted today to lawmakers.  Knoc said it’s seeking to “selectively” acquire oil-
production assets this year, shifting from buying companies in
the past years.  Debt at Knoc more than doubled to 12.3 trillion won ($10.5
billion) in 2010 from 5.5 trillion won in 2008, spurring
lawmakers to ask the state company to rein in borrowing, the
documents said. Knoc aims to boost crude output from overseas
assets to 300,000 barrels a day by 2012 and to 600,000 barrels
by 2019, up from 50,000 barrels in 2007. It now owns foreign
crude assets capable of producing 238,000 barrels a day.  To contact the reporter on this story:
