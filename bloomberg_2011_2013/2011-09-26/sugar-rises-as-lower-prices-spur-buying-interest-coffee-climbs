Sugar rose the most in almost a
month in New York amid speculation an 18 percent drop over the
past month spurred buying interest. Coffee advanced.  Egypt ’s state-run Sugar and Integrated Industries Co.
bought 50,000 metric tons of raw sugar at a tender yesterday,
paying $628.60 a ton to Eridania, Hussein Ahmed, a purchasing
manager at the company said today.  “End users have been waiting to buy this market below 26
cents and so they now have a chance to buy into these dips,”
Luis Rangel, vice president of commodity derivatives at ICAP
Futures LLC in  Jersey City ,  New Jersey , said in an e-mail today.
“The Egyptian off-take only reaffirms that notion.”  Raw sugar for March delivery was up 0.66 cent, or 2.7
percent, at 24.79 cents a pound by 7:35 a.m. on ICE Futures U.S.
in  New York . The price climbed as much as 3 percent, the most
since Aug. 24. White, or refined, sugar for December delivery
rose 0.9 percent, to $637.20 a ton on NYSE Liffe in London.  Sugar fell 18 percent in New York over the past month as
high prices resulted in demand erosion. The recent decline
encouraged deals, with Iraq, Tunisia and Egypt buying, Keith Flury, an analyst at Rabobank International in London, said in a
monthly report on Sept. 23.  “I believe commercials are rebuilding their long positions
below 26 cents a pound,” Rangel added.  Speculator Positions  Hedge-fund managers and other large speculators decreased
their net-long position in New York sugar futures in the week
ended Sept. 20, according to U.S. Commodity Futures Trading
Commission data. Net-long positions fell by 8,547 contracts, or
6 percent, from a week earlier, the Washington-based commission
said in its Commitments of Traders report.  Arabica coffee for December delivery rose 3.90 cents, or
1.7 percent, to $2.3535 a pound on ICE. Robusta coffee for
November delivery dropped $5, or 0.3 percent, to $1,946 a ton on
NYSE Liffe.  Cocoa for December delivery advanced $20, or 0.8 percent,
to $2,654 a ton in New York. Cocoa for December slid 1 pound, or
0.1 percent, to 1,733 pounds ($2,693) a ton in  London .  To contact the reporter on this story:
