Serbia is counting on the dinar
equivalent of 1 billion euros ($1.344 billion) to finance its
2011 fiscal gap, according to the  revised 2011 budget  submitted
today for parliamentary approval.  The deficit financing plan was announce before the
 International Monetary Fund  meets on Sept. 29 to approve a new 1
billion-euro precautionary loan program agreed to with the
Balkan country last month.  “The required funds to finance the  budget deficit ” as
well as to repay debts to domestic and foreign creditors, amount
to 473.8 billion dinars and are equivalent to $6.26 billion,
according to the budget. A maximum of 102.4 billion dinars will
be raised through “Eurobond issuance,” which includes both
foreign-currency and dinar debt issues, it said.  Serbia sold $1 billion of 10-year Eurobonds on Sept. 22
with a 7.25 percent coupon. The amount is equivalent to 75.59
billion dinars.  The government also counts on borrowing a maximum of 50
billion dinars from “domestic and international financial
commercial and multilateral institutions and foreign
governments” as well as a maximum of 400 billion dinars from
debt issuance at home.  The deficit financing plan was amended to raise the limit
on full-year government borrowing to 552.4 billion dinars, up
from 534.4 billion under the original 2011 budget.  To contact the reporter on this story:
