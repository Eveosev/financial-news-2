European Central Bank Governing
Council memberYves Mersch said speculation about a 50 basis-
point interest-rate cut of the bank’s benchmark is unfounded,
Market News International reported, citing an interview.  “These wild expectations only show that some people have
lost the north,” Mersch was quoted as saying. “We have one
needle in our compass.”  The ECB has lifted its key rate twice this year to 1.5
percent.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
