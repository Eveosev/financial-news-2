South Sudan may become a member of
the  World Bank  within a year amid plans by the lender to fund
infrastructure and health care projects, said Helen Mbao, senior
operations officer for the country.  “Everyone is anxious that this process is done quickly,”
she told reporters today in the capital, Juba.  South Sudan, which seceded from Sudan on July 9, applied
for World Bank membership before declaring independence. The
Washington-based lender approved a $75 million grant called a
“transitional  trust fund ,” Mbao said. Part of the funding will
be spent on a plan to develop local companies through a
business-plan competition, she said. Vice President  Riek Machar 
may approve that component within a month, Mbao added.  The other components may be approved by the end of the
year, including a plan to build roads in the fertile south of
the country that would allow farmers to have easier access to
markets, said Tesfa Michael Nahusenay, the bank’s senior
transportation specialist for South  Sudan .  As much as 500 kilometers (311 miles) of new roads may be
constructed by June, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
