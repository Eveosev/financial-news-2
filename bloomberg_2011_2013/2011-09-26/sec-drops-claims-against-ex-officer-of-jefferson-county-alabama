The U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission said it voluntarily dismissed claims against the
former president of the Jefferson County Commission in  Alabama ,
 Larry Langford .  The SEC dropped claims against Langford after he received a
15-year prison sentence and restitution and forfeiture orders in
a parallel criminal case that arose out of the SEC
investigation, according to a statement on the agencyâ€™s website.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
