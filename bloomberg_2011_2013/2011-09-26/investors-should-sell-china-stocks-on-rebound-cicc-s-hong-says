 Investors should sell Chinese
stocks on rebounds because valuations are not “compelling” in
terms of book value, China International Capital Corp. said.  Price-to-book ratios are still about 35 percent higher than
the lows reached during the 2008 global financial crisis, Hao Hong, a global equity strategist at CICC, wrote in a report
today. The report was referring to the MSCI China Index, Hong
said by phone. Investors should wait until economic fundamentals
start to improve, the report said.  “Consensus believes that Chinese markets now offer
compelling valuations after the recent plunge,” Hong wrote.
“We beg to differ.”  The MSCI China Index, which mostly tracks stocks of Chinese
companies traded in  Hong Kong , has tumbled 28 percent this year
as the Chinese government raised  interest rates  and reserve-
requirement ratios for banks to cool inflation that’s at the
highest in almost three years. The measure slumped 27 percent
this quarter as  Europe ’s sovereign-debt crisis and signs of a
faltering U.S. recovery raised concerns over global economic
growth.  The MSCI China is valued at 1.46 times book value, compared
with 1.17 times in November 2008 following the collapse of
Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc., data compiled by Bloomberg show.
The Shanghai Composite Index, which has fallen 14 percent this
year, trades for 2 times book value.  To contact the Bloomberg News staff on this story:
