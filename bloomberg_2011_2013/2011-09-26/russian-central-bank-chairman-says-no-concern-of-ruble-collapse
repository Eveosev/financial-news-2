Russia ’s Central Bank Chairman
Sergey Ignatiev said there is no concern that the ruble may
collapse.  “Everything is in order,” Ignatiev said in an interview
in Russia’s Ulyanovsk region. “Everything is fine.”  The ruble weakened as much as 1.5 percent, heading toward
the lowest closing level in more than two years against the
dollar as oil fell and Prime Minister  Vladimir Putin ’s plan to
return to the Russian presidency raised concerns that Finance
Minister Alexei Kudrin may resign.  Russia’s currency traded down 0.7 percent at 32.2824 per
dollar as of 3:31 p.m. in Moscow.  To contact the reporter on this story:
