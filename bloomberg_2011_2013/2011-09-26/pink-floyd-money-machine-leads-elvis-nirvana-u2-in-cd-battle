Pink Floyd , Elvis Presley and
Nirvana will vie again for fans’ favors -- and cash -- with the
release today of remastered CDs featuring some of the greatest
rock music.  They also give us weary hours of unessential add-ons, bum
notes, rambling interviews and failed outtakes in over-expanded
box sets that will lighten fans’ wallets and sustain record
shops even as downloads kill off disc sales.  Fans buying all of Pink Floyd’s rereleases will spend more
than $500. On the basic “Discovery” CDs, the band’s prog-rock
glory is clearer than ever, especially on “Money,” with its
ringing cash tills. These 14 albums already have sold 200
million copies. They are a good starting point for anyone who
hasn’t sampled them -- if there are any such people.  “Dark Side of the Moon,” which has sold 50 million copies
since 1973, also comes in a two-CD “Experience” version adding
an impressive live performance and a six-disc “Immersion” set
that’s way too much. It also includes a scarf, coasters and a
track off the wisely abandoned “Household Objects” project.
(The group tried to make music using wine glasses and elastic
bands.)  The “Wish You Were Here” set sounds better, adding an
unusual recording of the title track with violinist Stephane
Grappelli, who takes the song in an unfamiliar jazz direction.
Rating: ***** for the two-CD sets, *** for the bigger boxes.  “Young Man With the Big Beat” has just about everything
 Elvis Presley  recorded in 1956, probably his greatest year.  The finest material is on the first two discs: “Blue Suede
Shoes,” “Rip It Up,” “Love Me Tender.” The rockabilly hick
grows into rock’s biggest star. Rating: *****.  The full five-CD set has ragged outtakes, a powerful live
“Heartbreak Hotel” and rediscovered interviews. The 21-year-
old politely fields nasty questions suggesting he has no talent,
and admits he gets lonesome some nights (“yes sir”).  “My pelvis had nothin’ to do with what I do,” he adds.
Rating: ***½.  Nirvana’s grunge “Nevermind” turns 20 with more
remastering. The blistering “Smells Like Teen Spirit,” with
Kurt Cobain’s tortured vocal, starts the attack and there is
also a stripped-down rehearsal version. Rating: *****. The
bigger box is only for the most fervent devotees.  Jimi Hendrix  also joins the fray with “Winterland,” a
1968 San Francisco show. The shorter CD is quite enough (rating
****), with the five-disc set adding indulgent guitar freakouts
and a spaced-out Hendrix holding forth about “advancing
history” (rating: ***.)  There’s more: Today we also get a  Sting  set called “ 25
Years .” This month we had five Queen reissues and some  vintage 
Bob Seger. Rating: *** for all.  We have more giant boxes on the way before Christmas, with
Nov. 1 featuring the first release of the complete “ Smile ” by
the Beach Boys up against  U2’s  “Achtung Baby” 20th anniversary
set. For both, the double-disc versions sound like the best buy
and the rest extravagant.  The most extreme is U2’s $600 “ Uber Deluxe ” limited
edition with 10 discs, 16 art prints and a pair of Bono’s
trademark “The Fly” sunglasses.  The 14 Pink Floyd “Discovery” CDs are on EMI/ Capitol,
priced from $13 each or $179 for the set, with “Dark Side of
the Moon” also available in a two-CD “Experience” version for
about $22 or a six-disc “Immersion” set at $110. On Nov. 7
come two- and five-disc versions of “Wish You Were Here” and a
new greatest hits, “A Foot in the Door.” “The Wall” follows
on Feb. 27, 2012, including a seven-disc set. There are also
vinyl, iPhone and download versions. Information:

for the single disc or $35 for the box. Information:
