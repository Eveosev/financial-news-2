Gulf Coast gasoline rose as
 LyondellBasell Industries NV (LYB) ’s Houston refinery was said to run
at reduced rates during work on units at the plant’s sulfur
recovery complex.  The 302,300-barrel-a-day refinery, designed to process
heavy, high-sulfur crudes, is staggering maintenance on the
units over about six weeks, according to two people who asked
not to be identified because the work isn’t public.  The discount for reformulated, 87-octane gasoline in the
Gulf Coast narrowed 2 cents to 5 cents a gallon versus futures
traded on the New York Mercantile Exchange at 2:02 p.m.,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Prompt delivery rose
4.48 cents to $2.5295 a gallon.  Valero Energy Corp. (VLO)  shut an amine treating unit at its Port
Arthur refinery in  Texas  after a “suspected” rupture of a
process line, according to a  filing  with the state Commission on
Environmental Quality.  To contact the reporter on this story:
