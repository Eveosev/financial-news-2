Turkey ’s benchmark stock index rose
for the first day in four as markets in Europe erased losses
amid moves for a solution to the eurozone debt crisis.  The  ISE National 100 Index (XU100)  rose 609.66, or 1.1 percent, to
56,933.04 at 12:20 p.m. in Istanbul, erasing an earlier loss of
as much as 2 percent.  “Something is cooking in Europe and that is why this rally
is so fierce,” Isik Okte, a trader at Finans Invest in
Istanbul, said by instant message.  Germany’s benchmark index rose 2.6 percent, French equities
gained 2.3 percent and London’s FTSE 100 added 1 percent. The
euro pared earlier losses to 0.3 percent against the dollar.  Central bank and finance chiefs including U.S. Treasury
Secretary  Timothy F. Geithner  urged European policy makers to
intensify efforts to contain the European crisis, with Geithner
warning that failure would risk “cascading default, bank runs
and catastrophic risk.”  French banks have enough capital to withstand possible
losses from risks in Greece, which has been the focus of
European debt concerns, according to Journal Dimanche yesterday,
which cited French central bank head Christian Noyer.  Moves on the Turkish stock market were led by Anadolu Efes
Biracilik & Malt Sanayii AS, the Middle East’s biggest brewer
and part owner of  Coca-Cola Icecek AS (CCOLA) , which said it was
investing $450 million in expanding its operations in Pakistan,
according to a report in Hurriyet today. Anadolu Efes gained 4.9
percent to 21.25 liras and Coca-Cola Icecek added 1.15 liras to
5.5 percent.  Turkiye Halk Bankasi AS (HALKB) , a state-run bank, rose 2.6 percent
to 12 liras and  Turkiye Garanti Bankasi AS (GARAN) , the country’s
largest lender by market value, added 0.9 percent to 6.86 liras.  To contact the reporter on this story:
