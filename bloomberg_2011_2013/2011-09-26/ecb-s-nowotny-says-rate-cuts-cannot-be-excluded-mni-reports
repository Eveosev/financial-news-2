European Central Bank Governing
Council member Ewald Nowotny said he cannot exclude that the
bank will lower its benchmark interest rate, Market News
International reported, citing an interview.  “The ECB never pre-commits, and rate cuts cannot be
excluded,” Nowotny was quoted as saying. “It all depends 
on the developments ahead.”  Nowotny also said he “would not exclude a further downward
revision of ECB staff forecasts,” Market News said. When asked
about the introduction of new non-standard policy tools, Nowotny
said the bank shouldn’t “expand its toolkit beyond its current
scope.”  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
