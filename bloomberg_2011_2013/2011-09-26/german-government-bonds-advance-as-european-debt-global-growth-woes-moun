Germany ’s 10-year bonds fell for a
second day as European stocks gained and a report showed
business confidence declined less than economists forecast,
reducing demand for the region’s safest securities.  Two-year notes also dropped after a central bank official
said euro-area policy makers are likely to debate a range of
measures next week to spur economic growth. Belgian 10-year
bonds fell after the government sold 3.5 billion euros ($4.7
billion) of securities in its biggest auction since June 2010.
Greek notes slid for a sixth day.  “Part of it is in reaction to a firmer tone in equities,
without a shadow of a doubt,” said  Marc Ostwald , a fixed-income
strategist at Monument Securities Ltd. in  London .  “The Ifo
survey was not quite as negative as people expected. It acts as
a bit of a check to the doom and gloom we’ve had.”  The German 10-year yield increased seven basis points to
1.82 percent at 4:19 p.m. in London. The 2.25 percent security
due September 2021 fell 0.670, or 6.70 euros per 1,000-euro
($1,348) face amount to 103.880. Two-year yields climbed five
basis points to 0.45 percent, after falling to a record low of
0.324 percent on Sept. 23.  The Stoxx Europe 600 Index gained 1.5 percent, and the
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index rose 0.7 percent.  The Ifo institute in Munich said its business climate
index, based on a survey of 7,000 executives, dropped to 107.5
in September from 108.7 in August. Economists had forecast a
decline to 106.5, according to a Bloomberg News survey.  Boosting Growth  European Central Bank policy makers are set to discuss
resuming covered-bond purchases along with further measures to
boost growth, the central bank official said. The reintroduction
of 12-month loans to banks will also be discussed at the ECB’s
Oct. 6 policy meeting, said the person, who spoke on condition
of anonymity because the information is confidential.  Bonds in so-called core countries surged this quarter, with
the German 10-year yield falling more than a percentage point
since June 30, as reports signaled the region’s economy is
slipping back into a recession and leaders remained divided over
how to solve the debt crisis.  Belgium ’s 10-year yield increased four basis points to 3.81
percent. The extra yield investors demand to hold the securities
instead of bunds narrowed to 200 basis points, from 202 basis
points at the end of last week.  Belgium’s borrowing costs fell at auctions of securities
maturing between 2016 and 2041.  Spain  is scheduled to offer
three-month and six-month bills tomorrow, while Italy is due to
auction 14.5 billion euros of debt.  ‘Solid’ Demand  “Demand was relatively solid and not far from the previous
auction’s results,” Annalisa Piazza, a fixed-income strategist
in at Newedge Group SA in London, wrote in an e-mailed note.
“Yields were generally lower than at the previous auctions,
especially at the long end of the curve.”  Spanish 10-year bonds rose for a third day after German
 Chancellor Angela Merkel  said euro-area leaders must erect a
firewall around  Greece  to avert contagion to other nations.  Spain’s 10-year yield dropped five basis points to 5.16
percent. Ireland’s 10-year rates declined 20 basis points to
8.55 percent.  Greek bonds fell after To Paron newspaper and Proto Thema
reported yesterday that most Greeks expect the country to
default. Additional measures are needed in Greece, Finnish Prime
Minister  Jyrki Katainen  was quoted as saying in an interview
with  NRC Handelsblad .  Greece’s two-year yield jumped 149 basis points to 71.81
percent, after rising to a record 84.52 percent on Sept. 14. The
10-year yield increased 41 basis points to 24.05 percent.  Monthly Gain  German  government bonds  have returned 3.3 percent this
month, extending this year’s gain to 8.7 percent, according to
indexes compiled by the European Federation of Financial
Analysts Societies and Bloomberg. Treasuries rose 2 percent in
September, while Greek bonds have tumbled 25 percent.  Volatility on Belgium’s sovereign debt was the highest
among euro-area markets today, according to measures of 10-year
bonds, two-10-year spreads and credit-default swaps. Swings on
Irish 10-year bonds were 1.7 times the 90-day average, according
to the Bloomberg gauge of developed markets.  To contact the reporters on this story:
