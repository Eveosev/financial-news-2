Ed Balls , the Treasury spokesman
for the U.K.’s opposition  Labour Party , set out five things he
said the government should do to boost growth.  He called for a tax on bank bonuses to fund homebuilding,
bringing forward infrastructure spending, a cut in  sales tax , a
further sales-tax cut on home improvements, and a tax break for
small firms taking on new staff.  “Trying to cut the deficit too far, too fast isn’t
working,” Balls told his party’s annual conference in
Liverpool, northwest  England , according to the text of his
speech. “The government must adopt a steadier, more balanced
plan to get our deficit down and take immediate action now to
support the economy and create jobs here in Britain.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
