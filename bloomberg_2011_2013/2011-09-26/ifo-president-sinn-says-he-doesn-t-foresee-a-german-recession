Hans-Werner Sinn, President of the
Munich-based Ifo Institute, said he doesn’t foresee a recession
in  Germany .  “In general, this isn’t a recessionary environment,” Sinn
said in an interview with Bloomberg Television’s Francine
Lacqua. “The current business situation is still rather
robust.”  Sinn added that he saw a “50 percent probability” for a
recession in the U.S. and that  Europe  had to carry out the
necessary reforms.  “Basically, Europe has to carry out its reforms. Some
countries overspent in the past and it is a painful process to
adjust to reality.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
