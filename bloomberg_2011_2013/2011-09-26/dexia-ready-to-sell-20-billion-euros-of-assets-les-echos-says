Dexia SA (DEXB)  is ready to sell 20
billion euros of bond assets to continue as a viable business,
 Les Echos  reported, citing an unidentified person close to the
matter.  It is “totally out of the question” that the assets be
sold to one of Dexia’s current shareholders, according to the
French daily newspaper.  Another financing option would be for the bank to get 80
billion euros of loans to French local government off its
balance sheet by putting them into a new unit with Caisse des
Depots et Consignations and La Banque Postale, Les Echos said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
