Mela Sciences Inc. (MELA)  rose 55 percent
in Nasdaq trading after the company said it received preliminary
approval of its MelaFind tool for detecting the skin cancer
melanoma.  Mela gained $1.75 to $4.93 at 4 p.m. New York time in
Nasdaq Stock Market trading, its biggest increase since Sept. 7.
The shares of the Irvington, New York-based company have climbed
47 percent this year.  Mela is working with U.S. regulators for final approval of
the tool after receiving an “approvable letter,” the company
said in a statement today. It received clearance to sell the
device in the European Union earlier this month, the company
said.  “Although melanoma is virtually 100 percent curable if
detected at its earliest stage, one American dies from the
disease every hour,” Chief Executive Officer Joseph Gulfo said
in the statement. “MelaFind has the potential to lower those
tragic numbers.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
