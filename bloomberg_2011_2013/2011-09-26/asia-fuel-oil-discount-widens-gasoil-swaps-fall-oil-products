Asia  fuel oil ’s discount to crude
widened, signaling that losses for refiners turning oil into
residual products are increasing. Gasoil swaps dropped to the
lowest since February.  Fuel Oil  Fuel oil’s discount to Asian marker Dubai crude widened 20
cents to $4.35 a barrel at 11:50 a.m. Singapore time, according
to PVM Oil Associates Ltd., a broker. The difference increased
for the first time in five days.  High-sulfur fuel oil swaps for October fell $14.75, or 2.3
percent, to $618.75 a metric ton, PVM said. That’s the lowest
since Feb. 22. The premium of 180-centistoke fuel oil to 380-
centistoke grade was unchanged for a second day at $8.25. This
viscosity spread was the narrowest so far this month, indicating
bunker, or marine fuel, has decreased less than higher-quality
fuel oil.  Middle Distillates  The premium of gasoil, or diesel, to Dubai crude gained 2
cents to $16.41 a barrel, according to PVM. This crack spread, a
measure of refining profit, narrowed for a third week last week.  October gasoil swaps declined $2.05, or 1.7 percent, to
$115.95 a barrel, PVM data showed. That’s the lowest since Feb.
16. Jet fuel’s premium to gasoil was up 5 cents at $1.80, the
highest since Sept. 15. A widening regrade means it is more
profitable to make  aviation fuel  over diesel.  Light Distillates  Japan ’s open-specification naphtha forward contracts for
first-half November delivery were bid at $896.75 a ton against
offers at $899.75, according to Ginga Petroleum Singapore Pte, a
broker. On Sept. 23, the petrochemical feedstock decreased for a
fifth day to close at $915.63, capping the longest losing streak
since May last year.  Naphtha’s premium to London-traded Brent crude futures slid
$1.13 to $133.45 a ton, based on data compiled by Bloomberg.
This crack spread narrowed last week, ending a four-week rally.  Gasoline’s premium to naphtha last week advanced 55 cents
to $18.85 a barrel, Bloomberg data showed. A widening reforming
margin indicates motor fuel is more profitable to produce.  To contact the reporter on this story:
