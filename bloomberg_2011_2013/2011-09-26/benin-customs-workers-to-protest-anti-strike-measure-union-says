Benin’s  customs workers plan to
start a three-day strike tomorrow to protest a draft policy that
would end their ability to demonstrate, said Catherine
Egounlety, secretary-general of the employees’ union.  Lawmakers in the West African nation are set to vote on the
measure Sept. 29, she said in a speech broadcast on state-owned,
Cotonou-based ORTB today.  Customs revenue reached 63.3 billion  CFA francs  ($130
million) in the first quarter of the year, or 1.8 percent of the
country’s gross domestic product, according to the International
Monetary Fund. Full-year revenue is forecast at 304 billion
francs, or 8.7 percent of GDP, the Washington-based lender said
in a report published on its website on Sept. 22.  The workers held a two-day strike earlier this month that
cost the country about 3 billion francs, ORTB reported on Sept.
15, citing the union.  To contact the reporter on this story:
