Greek Finance Minister Evangelos Venizelos scaled back a target for raising revenue to pay down
debt from state-asset sales amid slumping stock values and
delays in implementing the program.  Greece  will raise 1.4 billion euros ($1.9 billion) in
September and meet a third-quarter target of 1.7 billion euros
next month, Venizelos said in a speech in  Washington  yesterday
after attending the annual meetings of the  International
Monetary Fund  and the  World Bank , according to a transcript of
his comments. The state will have raised 4 billion euros by the
end of the year, he said, less than a target of 5 billion euros.  Greece has yet to secure a second international bailout
amid questions about its ability to satisfy the terms for aid.
Venizelos this month announced a raft of new measures including
pension and wage cuts as well as a sweeping property tax to
ensure the nation meets 2011 targets to qualify for a sixth loan
payment in October under the first May 2010 financing package.  Venizelos said the measures equate to a reduction of 20
percent in public-sector salaries, on top of 15 percent for the
civil service and 25 percent in the wider public sector.
Pensions are being reduced 4 percent on average, in addition to
10 percent thatâ€™s been taken off in previous measures.  In other changes to the five-year medium-term fiscal plan
approved in June, Venizelos said a rule of one new hire for
every 10 departures in the state sector would last the duration
of the program, which is now running to 2014. This is also the
case for a property tax to be levied via electricity bills,
which will provide an annual yield of 1.1 percent of gross
domestic product.  To contact the reporter on this story:
