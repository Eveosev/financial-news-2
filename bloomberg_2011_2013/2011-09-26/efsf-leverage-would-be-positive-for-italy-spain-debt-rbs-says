An increase in the size of the euro
area’s bailout fund using leverage, or borrowed money, from the
 European Central Bank  may boost Italian and Spanish debt and
weigh on German bunds, Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc said.  “If the European Financial Stability Facility is indeed
leveraged via the ECB then this is highly positive for the
periphery as the firepower for the periphery would be large,”
 Harvinder Sian , a senior interest-rate strategist in London,
wrote in an investor note today. “Conversely, a leveraged EFSF
will be dangerous for AAA governments given the clear risk-
sharing across the region.”  A potential move by European governments to speed up the
introduction of a permanent rescue fund for their economies may
be more negative for Italian and Spanish debt because lending or
asset purchases by the so-called European Stability Mechanism
would be regarded as senior to current bondholder obligations,
Sian wrote.  To contact the reporter on this story:
