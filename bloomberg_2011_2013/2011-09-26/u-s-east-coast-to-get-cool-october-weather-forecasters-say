The U.S. East Coast and Ohio Valley
will start October with cool weather, according to forecasters.  Matt Rogers , president of  Commodity Weather Group  LLC, and
 MDA EarthSat Weather  call for the eastern third of the country
to be at least 3 to 5 degrees cooler than average from Oct. 1 to
Oct. 5 in their 6- to 10-day forecasts. Some areas will get even
colder, the weathermen said.  Rogers said he doubts there will be “major” energy
demands because there won’t be “sustained extreme” bursts of
cold temperatures.  The two forecasters agree that while the East Coast cools,
the Rocky Mountains and northern Great Plains will be warm. That
warm weather will shift to the east into the Great Lakes, Ohio
Valley and Appalachian Mountains from Oct. 6 to Oct. 10,
according to the forecasters’ 11- to 15-day outlooks.  Gaithersburg, Maryland-based MDA calls for the East Coast
to have seasonal temperatures during that time frame, while
Rogers in Bethesda, Maryland, said the Northeast from
 Pennsylvania  to  New England  may be warmer.  Natural gas traders use long-range temperature predictions
to gauge energy use and market fluctuations. Hot or cold weather
can increase demand for heating and cooling, and  power plants 
use about 30 percent of the nation’s gas supplies, according to
Energy Department data.  To contact the reporter on this story:
