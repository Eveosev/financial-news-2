Serbian lawmakers approved public
property and restitution laws, meeting some of the conditions
the country needs to meet to qualify for European Union
candidacy in three weeks’ time.  Lawmakers today approved the public property law, designed
to further decentralize  Serbia  and pave way for more foreign
investment. The lack of the measure has allowed the central
government to reap most of revenue from property sales since the
2000 ouster of the then President  Slobodan Milosevic .  Prime Minister Mirko Cvetkovic’s Cabinet, facing elections
next spring, seeks to convince the European Commission by Oct.
12 that the country is fit to be a membership candidate. The
government stepped up fight against corruption, organized crime
and handed over 46 men who were indicted for  war crimes 
committed during fighting in 1990s related to the breakup of the
former  Yugoslavia  to the tribunal in The Hague.  Lawmakers also cleared the restitution law, setting rules
to compensate owners who had their property confiscated by
Communists 70 years ago.  The law allows compensation both in cash and in kind. The
government will issue a 15-year bond to repay the debt and state
borrowing should not exceed 2 billion euros ($2.68 billion), or
6 percent of gross domestic product, to preserve macroeconomic
stability.  The limit for the fiscal strain was agreed on late last
month with the  International Monetary Fund , whose board is due
to confirm a new, 1 billion-euro precautionary loan program with
Serbia on Sept. 29.  To contact the reporter on this story:
