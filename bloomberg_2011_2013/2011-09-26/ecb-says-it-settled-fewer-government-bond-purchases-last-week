The  European Central Bank  said it
spent less on  government bonds  last week.  The Frankfurt-based ECB said today it settled 3.95 billion
euros ($5.3 billion) of bond purchases in the week through Sept.
23, down from 9.79 billion euros in the previous week. The ECB
will take seven-day term deposits from banks tomorrow to absorb
the 156.5 billion euros of liquidity created since its bond
program started on May 10, 2010, a practice it employs to ensure
the purchases don’t fuel inflation.  The ECB last month started buying Italian and Spanish
government bonds after  Europe ’s debt crisis pushed the nations’
yields to euro-era records. Policy makers are increasingly split
over the best way to fight the crisis. Juergen Stark on Sept. 9
announced he will resign from the ECB’s Executive Board in
protest at the purchases and Governing Council member Jens
Weidmann said earlier this month the bank should reduce the
risks on its balance sheet rather than increase them.  Italian 10-year yields decreased to 5.6 percent today. The
Spanish equivalent fell to 5.14 percent, while  Greece ’s rose to
23 percent.  Greece is struggling to meet budget targets amid a deepening
recession. The economy will shrink 5.5 percent this year and may
contract “notably” next year, Finance Minister Evangelos Venizelos said last week. European Commission spokesman  Amadeu Altafaj  told reporters in Brussels today the country faces a
“moment of truth” and has to fully implement its savings plans
to qualify for the next aid installment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
