The Lithuanian government is “not
ambitious” enough in executing its target for reducing the
 budget deficit  to below 3 percent of gross domestic product next
year, said Mindaugas Leika, chief economist at  Lithuania ’s
 central bank .  The government should expand wealth taxation by introducing
taxes on real estate to boost revenue, Leika said in a video
 interview  with the magazine IQ published on its website. It
should also increase the fight against the “shadow economy”
and boosting efficiency at state-owned companies, he said.  The government is aiming to narrow the 2012 budget
shortfall to 2.8 percent of GDP next year from an estimated 5.3
percent shortfall this year. The Cabinet must submit its 2012
budget plan to the parliament by Oct. 17.  Lithuania should consider closing some of its 23
universities to help trim budget spending and raise the quality
of the education system, Leika said. Reducing health-care
benefits for the wealthy may also help balance the budget, he
said.  Government plans for a 6.3 percent increase next year in
the minimum monthly wage, the lowest in the Baltic region, will
help fight illegal compensation in the labor market, Leika said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
