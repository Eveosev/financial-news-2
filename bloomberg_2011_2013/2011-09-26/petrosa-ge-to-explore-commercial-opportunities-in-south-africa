PetroSA, South Africa’s state-owned
oil and gas producer, signed an agreement with  General Electric
Co. (GE)  to explore possible commercial opportunities between the two
companies in South Africa.  Potential areas for co-operation include at PetroSA’s gas-
to-liquids refinery in Mossel Bay, in shale gas exploration and
enhanced heavy oil recovery, and in renewable energy, the
companies said in an e-mailed statement.  GE Energy may also participate in the development of an
electricity co-generation and a water treatment facility for
PetroSA’s planned Mthomba refinery at Coega, near  Port
Elizabeth , said Kaizer Nyatsumba, a spokesman for the oil and
gas company.  GE Energy, the world’s biggest maker of power-generation
equipment and services, has been building its oil and gas
division, partly through about $12 billion in acquisitions in
the past year.  GE, the world’s biggest maker of electricity generating
equipment, is based in Fairfield,  Connecticut . Its energy
segment has its headquarters in Atlanta.  To contact the reporter on this story:
