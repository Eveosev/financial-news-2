Bonds issued by the European
Financial Stability Facility underperformed benchmark German
government debt securities, increasing the extra yield investors
demand to hold the securities to a record.  The yield on EFSF notes maturing in July 2016 was little
changed at 2 percent at 8:06 a.m. in  London , while the rate on
similar-maturity German debt dropped three basis points to 0.88
percent. That pushed the difference in yield, or spread, to 111
basis points, the most on record, according to Bloomberg data.  The yield spread between EFSF bonds due in July 2021 and
similar-maturity German bunds increased two basis points to 100
basis points, after reaching 102 basis points on Sept. 22.  To contact the reporter on this story:
