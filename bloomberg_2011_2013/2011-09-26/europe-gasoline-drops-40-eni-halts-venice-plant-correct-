(Corrects date for Venice refinery halt in second and
penultimate paragraphs.)  European winter-grade gasoline
barges dropped as much as $40 a metric ton following  Brent
crude ’s losses of as much as 2.2 percent earlier today.  Eni SpA decided to halt its 80,000-barrel-a-day oil
refinery in Venice from Nov. 1 for six months because of low
profit margins, a company executive said.  Light Products  Winter grade gasoline barges for immediate loading in
Amsterdam-Rotterdam-Antwerp traded at $895 to $900 a ton,
according to a Bloomberg survey of traders and brokers
monitoring the Argus Bulletin Board. That compares with $930 and
$935 on Sept. 23.  Total SA and Trafigura Beheer BV were sellers, while North
Sea Group, Morgan Stanley and Royal Dutch Shell Plc bought
Eurobob grade, to which ethanol is added to make finished fuel.  Summer-specification gasoline changed hands at $935,
compared with $983 the previous session, as Statoil ASA sold to
Gunvor Group Ltd.  The gasoline crack, or premium to Brent, was little changed
at $4.41 a barrel, according to data from London-based from PVM
Oil Associates Ltd., a crude and fuel broker in  London .  “The gasoline crack remains very weak and the processing
economics will remain a challenge for refineries in the Atlantic
Basin,”  Olivier Jakob , managing director of Switzerland-based
researcher Petromatrix GmbH, said in a note today.  Naphtha’s discount to Brent crude shrank to $3.76 a barrel,
compared with $4.14 on Sept. 23.  Middle Distillates  Gasoil for October delivery fell as much as $25.75, or 2.9
percent, to $873.25 a ton, the lowest since Aug. 9, on London’s
ICE Futures Europe exchange.  The contract was 0.6 percent lower at $893.25 a ton as of 1
p.m. London time, a premium of $5.25 to November. A market is
described as being in backwardation when contracts nearest to
delivery cost more than later-dated shipments. This usually
signals near-term scarcity of supply or rising demand.  Refineries  Eni decided to halt its  Venice  refinery on Nov. 1 for half
a year because of low profit margins and a scarcity of light,
sweet crudes, including Libyan oil, Maurizio Maugeri, the
company’s head of downstream said at a conference in Brussels.  The plant mainly supplies northeastern Italy and  Austria ,
according to the company’s website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
