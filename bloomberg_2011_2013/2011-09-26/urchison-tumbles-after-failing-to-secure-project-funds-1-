Murchison Metals Ltd. (MMX) , an iron ore
developer, fell to almost a six-year low in Sydney trading after
failing to secure funding for a A$5.94 billion ($5.8 billion)
iron ore infrastructure project in  Western Australia .  Murchison, based in Perth, fell 20 percent to close at 33
cents at 4:10 p.m. Sydney time, the lowest since Nov. 23, 2005,
and making the stock the worst performer on the Australian
benchmark index.  Murchison and Japanese partner Mitsubishi Corp. said Sept.
21 they were revising their plan for the Oakajee project after
failing to secure key agreements. The partners, planning to
spend A$3.7 billion expanding the Jack Hills iron ore mine, want
to develop the Oakajee port and rail project to open up the Mid-
West region for iron ore exports to  Asia .  “There’s major uncertainty around the Jack Hills project
and whilst they are in talks about refinancing and potential
relationships with investors, the risks around stage two of Jack
Hills is holding some back from buying,” said  Chris Weston , a
Melbourne-based institutional trader at IG Markets Ltd.  Murchison and Mitsubishi, chosen as developers by the
Western Australian government instead of a Chinese consortium,
have until Dec. 31 to decide on the development. Construction
was scheduled to start in the first quarter of 2012 and port
operations to commence in 2015.  John Phaceas, Murchison manager for external relations,
declined to comment when contacted by phone.  To contact the reporter on this story:
