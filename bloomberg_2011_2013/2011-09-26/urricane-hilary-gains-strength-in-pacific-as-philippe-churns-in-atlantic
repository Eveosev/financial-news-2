Hurricane Hilary regained Category
4 strength as it moved west into the Pacific, stirring up surf
in  Baja California  and southwestern  Mexico , while in the
Atlantic, Tropical Storm Philippe remains far from land.  Hilary’s winds grew to 135 miles (217 kilometers) per hour
from 120 mph earlier today, the U.S. National Hurricane Center
said in  an advisory  at 5 p.m. East Coast time. The storm was 510
miles south-southwest of the Baja peninsula and moving west at
10 mph.  A Category 4 hurricane is the second-strongest on the five-
step  Saffir-Simpson scale . Hilary is expected to weaken and turn
to the northwest by late tomorrow, according to the hurricane
center.  “Some fluctuations in strength are possible during the
next day or so, but overall, gradual weakening is expected
during the next 48 hours,” the advisory said.  Philippe , with 60-mph winds, is predicted to stay away from
land for at least five days, with little change in strength over
the next 48 hours, the center said. The  16th named storm  of the
 Atlantic hurricane season  was about 695 miles west of the Cape
Verde Islands and moving northwest at 8 mph.  The hurricane center is also monitoring an area of
thunderstorms east of the Virgin Islands that includes the
remnants of Tropical Storm Ophelia. It has a 60 percent chance
of becoming a depression or storm within two days.  To contact the reporter on this story:
