Ukrainian farmers may harvest a
record 55 million metric tons of grain this year, doubling
exports and boosting budget revenue, Deputy Prime Minister
 Serhiy Tigipko  said.  “This year we’ve had a good grain harvest,” Tigipko said
yesterday in an interview in  Washington , where he was attending
the International Monetary Fund’s annual meeting. Ukraine will
export about 24 million tons of grains this year, he said.  Ukraine, which is seeking to unfreeze a $15.6 billion loan
program from the IMF, raised its 2011 grain forecast last week
to 53 million tons, matching the 2008 record. The east European
country exported 12.1 million tons of grains in the marketing
year which ended June 30, according to the country’s Agrarian
Confederation.  “In 15 days of September we’ve loaded 1.5 million tons,
which, naturally, with good prices, will provide solid foreign-
currency revenue,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
