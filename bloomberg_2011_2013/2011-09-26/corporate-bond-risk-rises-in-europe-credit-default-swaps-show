Credit-default swaps on French and
German government debt rose to records as policy makers struggle
to resolve  Europe ’s debt crisis and the global economy slows.  The Markit iTraxx SovX Western Europe Index of swaps on 15
governments climbed 2.5 basis points to an all-time high 367.5,
according to CMA at 10:30 a.m. in London. The gauge rises as
perceptions of  credit quality  deteriorate. Contracts on  France 
climbed four basis points to 201 and  Germany  was up 2.5 at 111.  Failure to combat the Greek-led turmoil threatens
“cascading default, bank runs and catastrophic risk,” U.S.
Treasury Secretary  Timothy F. Geithner  said at the annual
meeting of the  International Monetary Fund . Advanced economies
will stall over the next year as Europe slides into a recession,
according to Pacific Investment Management Co., which runs the
world’s biggest bond fund.  “The hope-disappointment theme continues,” said Alberto Gallo, head of European credit strategy at Royal Bank of
Scotland Group Plc in London. “We need concrete policy steps to
ring-fence Europe’s highly interlinked financial system.”  The Markit iTraxx Financial Index linked to the senior debt
of 25 banks and insurers was unchanged at 282 basis points,
after earlier rising as much as 15 basis points, JPMorgan Chase
& Co. prices show.  Swaps on Belgium climbed six basis points to an all-time
high of 301 and  Portugal  soared 43 basis points to a record
1,216.5, according to CMA.  Ireland, Italy  Swaps on Ireland increased 15 basis points to 824, Italy
rose nine to 519 and Spain was unchanged at 415. It now costs
$6.3 million upfront and $100,000 annually to insure $10 million
of Greek debt for five years.  Contracts on the Markit iTraxx Crossover Index of 50
companies with mostly high-yield credit ratings climbed as much
as 25.5 basis points to 866.5, before erasing the move and
holding at 842.5. The Markit iTraxx Europe Index of 125
companies with investment-grade ratings was up 0.25 at 197.25
basis points.  The high-yield gauge will soar above 1,000 basis points and
the investment-grade measure will break through 220 basis
points, Gallo said. The index closed at a record 216 in December
2008, according to Markit Group Ltd.  A basis point on a credit-default swap protecting 10
million euros ($13.4 million) of debt from default for five
years is equivalent to 1,000 euros a year. Swaps pay the buyer
face value in exchange for the underlying securities or the cash
equivalent should a borrower fail to adhere to its debt
agreements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
