Priceline.com Inc. (PCLN) , the biggest
U.S. online travel agency by stock market value, appointed
former  Microsoft Corp. (MSFT)  executive Darren Huston as chief
executive officer of its European hotel unit, Booking.com.  Kees Koolen, the founder and former head of Booking.com,
will serve as chairman, the Norwalk, Connecticut-based company
said today in a statement.  Revenue in Priceline’s international business, the bulk of
which comes from Booking.com, surged 90 percent to $612.9
million in the second quarter, accounting for 56 percent of
total sales. Since acquiring Amsterdam-based Booking.com in
2005, Priceline’s annual revenue has more than tripled and the
stock price has jumped more than 20-fold.  “Globally, there are significant opportunities for our
business, both in core markets and in developing ones,” Huston,
45, said in the statement.  Booking.com  offers access to more than 165,000 hotels in 43
languages. Priceline also owns Agoda.com in Bangkok.  Priceline fell $1.02 to $513.59 at 4 p.m. today on the
Nasdaq Stock Market. The shares have gained 29 percent this
year, compared with the 7.5 percent drop in the Standard &
Poor’s 500 Index.  Huston joined Microsoft, the world’s largest software
maker, in 2003 and spent the last three years as corporate vice
president in the consumer and online business. From 2005 to 2008
he was CEO of Microsoft Japan, the largest unit of the Redmond,
Washington-based company outside the U.S.  Prior to Microsoft, Huston was a senior vice president at
 Starbucks Corp. (SBUX) , handling acquisitions and product development
at the world’s biggest operator of coffee shops. Huston has a
master’s degree in business administration from  Harvard Business
School .  To contact the reporter on this story:
