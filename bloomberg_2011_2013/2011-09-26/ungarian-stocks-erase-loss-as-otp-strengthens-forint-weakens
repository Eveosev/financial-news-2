OTP Bank Nyrt.,  Hungary ’s largest
lender, rallied the most in more than a week, rebounding from
the lowest in 2 1/2 years, after Templeton Asset Management’s
 Mark Mobius  picked the lender’s shares and bank stocks gained
across  Europe .  OTP gained as much as 6.4 percent and rose 1.5 percent to
2,840 forint by the 5 p.m. end of trade in Budapest, the biggest
jump since Sept. 15 and paring its slide this month to 32
percent. The benchmark BUX index ended little changed at
14,929.8 after falling as much as 2.1 percent earlier today.  OTP’s five-day losing streak before today pushed the
shares’ relative strength index as low as 20.6 at the end of
last week. A reading below 30 indicates to technical analysts a
security may rise. The RSI rose to 22.4 today. OTP is among the
eastern European companies Templeton has chosen for investment,
Mobius, who oversees about $50 billion at Templeton, told
CNBC.com in an  interview  published yesterday.  European stocks rose for a second day as finance ministers
and central bankers urged policy makers in Europe to intensify
efforts to contain the region’s debt crisis following meetings
with the  International Monetary Fund .  Hungary’s currency was little changed at 290 per euro,
after capping a fourth weekly slump on Sept. 23.  To contact the reporter on this story:
