France’s drug regulator warned
against potential side effects of diet pills sold by
 GlaxoSmithKline Plc (GSK)  and  Roche Holding AG (ROG) ,  Les Echos  reported.  Roche’s Xenical and Glaxo’s Alli both contain an active
ingredient called orlistat which might cause rare types of
hepatitis, the newspaper said. The  European Medicines Agency ,
Europe’s drug regulator, decided to study the matter last week,
according to Les Echos.  To contact the reporter on this story:
