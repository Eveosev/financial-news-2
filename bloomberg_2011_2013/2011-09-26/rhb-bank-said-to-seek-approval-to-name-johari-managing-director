RHB Capital Bhd. (RHBC) , Malaysia’s fifth-
biggest lender, wants to name Johari Abdul Muid as managing
director of its commercial banking unit, a person familiar with
the matter said.  It has requested central bank approval to appoint Johari to
head RHB Bank Bhd., said the person who asked not to be named as
the information is private. The Kuala Lumpur-based company
announced on Sept. 6 that it had withdrawn an earlier
application to give the job to Renzo Viegas. Financial
institutions in Malaysia need central bank consent before naming
top executives.  Johari, 53, currently a non-executive director at both RHB 
Bank and parent RHB Capital, started his career as a money market
dealer and has more than 30 years of experience in the finance
industry, according to the company’s website. He is also a
deputy chief executive officer of the Employees Provident Fund,
 Malaysia ’s biggest pension fund and RHB’s biggest shareholder.  Johari declined to comment in a text message to Bloomberg
today. RHB Capital Chairman Mohamed Khadar Merican couldn’t be
immediately reached at his office for comment.  Viegas intends to take time off next year for personal
matters, RHB said in its earlier statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
