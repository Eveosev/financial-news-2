Greece ’s next aid disbursement is
unlikely to be decided by European finance ministers at next
week’s meeting, the European Commission said.  “I think yes, you can rule that out,” commission
spokesman  Amadeu Altafaj  told reporters in Brussels today.
Finance ministers meet Oct. 3-4 in Luxembourg.  A decision on the 8 billion-euro ($11 billion) disbursement
is unlikely at the meeting because commission, European Central
Bank and International Monetary Fund experts haven’t yet
returned to Athens to assess Greece’s progress, he said.  The experts will return “soon but I don’t have the precise
date,” he said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
