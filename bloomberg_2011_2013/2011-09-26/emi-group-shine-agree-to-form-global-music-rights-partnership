EMI Group Ltd., the recording
company owned by  Citigroup Inc. (C) , will manage music owned by
 Elisabeth Murdoch ’s television-production firm Shine Group Ltd.,
opening the catalogue to a wider audience.  EMI will administer and collect performance royalties for
Shine Group music, including for branches in the U.S.,
Australia, France and  Germany , the companies said today in a
statement.  The London-based businesses will also form a music library
that can be used by Shine’s television shows and third-party
productions. EMI and Shine have paired a song by the band Train,
which is represented by EMI, with “The Biggest Loser,” a TV
show produced by Shine company Reveille.  “Extending our deal with Shine enables us to increase the
revenue potential for their music assets from a wider range of
programming genres across the world,” Jonathan Channon,
executive vice president of media and business development at
EMI, said in a statement.  Shine Chief Executive Officer Elisabeth Murdoch sold the
company to  News Corp. (NWSA) , which is run by her father,  Rupert Murdoch , this year. EMI was taken over by Citigroup this year
after failing to meet debt requirements and is expected to be
sold.  To contact the reporter on this story:
