Libya ’s new rulers should put their
infighting on hold until the battle to free all the country’s
territory from Muammar Qaddafi’s rule has been won, Prime
Minister Mahmoud Jibril said.  Political struggles should be postponed until “the soil of
Libya is fully liberated,” Qaddafi is arrested and a
constitution drawn up, Jibril said in an interview with Saudi
newspaper Al Hayat. “Many have forgotten or deliberately ignore
the fact that the land is not yet liberated and that the battle
is not over.”  Leaders from Libya’s National Transitional Council are
negotiating over the formation of a government to lead the
country into elections, as its troops fight to gain control of
Sirte, Qaddafi’s birthplace, and other pockets of territory
still controlled by forces loyal to the former leader.
Announcement of an interim Cabinet has been repeatedly
postponed, and council officials said last week that another
week may be needed.  Jibril said he was disappointed by the lack of unity among
the opposition groups that combined to oust Qaddafi with the
backing of North Atlantic Treaty Organization members including
the U.S., U.K. and  France , which carried out air strikes. Libya
holds the largest oil reserves in  Africa , according to the BP
Statistical Review of World Energy.  “They began their political struggle early,” Jibril said.
The council includes Islamic and tribal leaders as well as
former members of Qaddafi’s government.  To contact the reporter on this story:
