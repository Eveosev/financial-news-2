Hurricane Hilary stirred up surf in
 Baja California  and southwestern  Mexico  as Tropical Storm
Philippe remained far from land over the Atlantic.  Hilary’s winds strengthened to 125 miles (201 kilometers)
per hour from 120 mph earlier today, the National Hurricane
Center said in  an advisory  at 11 a.m. East Coast time. The storm
was 475 miles south-southwest of the Baja peninsula and moving
west at 10 mph.  The system, a Category 3 hurricane on the five-step  Saffir-
Simpson scale , is forecast to weaken over the next two days.
Swells generated by Hilary are affecting parts of southwestern
Mexico and southern Baja California, the center said.  “These swells are likely causing life-threatening surf and
rip current conditions,” the center said.  In the Atlantic, Tropical Storm  Philippe , with 60 mph
winds, is predicted to stay away from land for at least five
days, with little change in strength over the next 48 hours, the
center said. The  16th named storm  of the  Atlantic hurricane
season  was about 680 miles west of the southernmost Cape Verde
Islands and moving northwest at 12 mph.  The hurricane center is also monitoring an area of
thunderstorms east of the Virgin Islands that includes the
remnants of Tropical Storm Ophelia. It has a 30 percent of
becoming a depression or storm within two days.  To contact the reporters on this story:
