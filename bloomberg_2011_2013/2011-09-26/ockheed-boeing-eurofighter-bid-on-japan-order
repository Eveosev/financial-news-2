Lockheed Martin Corp. (LMT) ,  Boeing Co. (BA) 
and Eurofighter GmbH submitted bids to supply Japan with fighter
jets in a contest that may be worth more than $4 billion.  Lockheed proposed the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter, while
Boeing offered the  F-18 Super Hornet  and Eurofighter put forward
the Typhoon, according to separate statements today. A defense
ministry spokesman confirmed the bids had been received. He
declined to be named citing government policy.  Japan plans to pick a winner in the contest to supply about
40 fighters this year as it works to replace aging planes and
bolster defenses. Bethesda, Maryland-based Lockheed, the world’s
largest defense contractor, Boeing, and Eurofighter are
contending for the deal as U.S. and European austerity drives
damp the outlook for military spending in their home markets.  The new aircraft, due to delivered from 2016, will replace
Boeing F-4s, which were last assembled in  Japan  in 1981. Japan
had a total of 362 fighter jets as of March 31, according to the
defense ministry’s website.  Japan, which has the world’s sixth-largest  defense budget ,
is upgrading its air defenses as both Russia and China develop
stealth fighters and as  North Korea  works on improving its
ballistic missiles and developing nuclear weapons.  To contact the reporters on this story:
