Russia’s central bank has
sufficient reserves to stabilize the ruble, OAO Sberbank Chief
Executive Officer  German Gref  said as the currency fell to a
two-year low against the dollar.  “The central bank has enough reserves to stabilize the
ruble,” Gref, who heads Russia’s biggest lender, said at a news
briefing today in  Singapore .  Russia’s currency weakened as much as 1.4 percent to
32.5225 per dollar today, its lowest intraday level since July
2009, as oil fell and Prime Minister Vladimir Putin’s plan to
return to the presidency sparked concern Finance Minister Alexei
Kudrin may resign.  To contact the reporter on this story:
