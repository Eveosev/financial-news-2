Landstar System Inc. (LSTR)  must pay
$40.2 million after a state court in Marietta, Georgia, found it
liable for a 2007 truck wreck.  The trucking company, based in Jacksonville,  Florida , said
in a Sept. 23 regulatory filing that it took a $5 million charge
for the litigation and insurance will cover the remaining costs
of the lawsuit.  Theresa Foster, 49, sued the company after a Landstar-owned
truck driven by Stephen Collins ran a stop sign and killed her
husband Bill, 46, according to her lawyer, Matt Flournoy.
Collins wasn’t a Landstar employee, Flournoy said today in a
phone interview.  Under Georgia law, Landstar is liable for the accident.
Collins, who owned the truck cab and not the tractor-trailer,
wasn’t a defendant in the trial, Flournoy said.  Landstar and its insurers will appeal the award, according
to the regulatory filing.  “We feel confident this will stand up on appeal,”
Flournoy said.  The case is Foster v. Landstar Ranger Inc., 09-a-1698-2
State Court of Cobb County, State of  Georgia  (Marietta).  To contact the reporter on this story:
