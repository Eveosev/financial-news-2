Chile ’s central bank “for now”
will continue with its dollar-purchasing program that is
designed to stem the peso’s gains and increase reserves, Diario
Financiero  reported , citing bank President Jose  De Gregorio .  It’s “very premature” to conclude whether the peso’s
depreciation last week is the start of a new trend, De Gregorio
told the Santiago-based financial daily in an interview
published on its  website . Markets can overreact in the short
term, he was quoted as saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
