ING Groep NV (INGA) , the biggest Dutch
financial-services company, and U.K. insurer  RSA Insurance Group
Plc (RSA)  are seeking new  office space  in the City of London financial
district.  ING is looking for 150,000 to 175,000 square feet (16,300
square meters), said Adrian Simpson, a spokesman for the
Amsterdam-based company’s commercial-banking division. ING’s
U.K. base is at 60 London Wall, near Liverpool Street station.  “We have a few years to go on the lease here, so it makes
sense to look around,” he said. He declined to say when the
lease will expire.  Developers are asking companies to sign leases for
buildings before they’re completed because it makes it easier to
get financing as the faltering economic recovery is threatening
the U.K. commercial real-estate market’s rebound from a slump
two years ago. Financing remains a challenge, according to a
survey of 70 contractors published Sept. 23 by real-estate
adviser Davis Langdon.  RSA’s contract on Leadenhall Court ends in 2014, spokesman
Martin Cairns said, without specifying how much space the
company is looking for.  “Naturally, we’re looking at different options, but no
decision has yet been made,” Cairns said.  British Land Co., the second-largest U.K. real-estate
investment trust, told analysts last week that RSA may seek
125,000 square feet.  JPMorgan Cazenove said in a research note last week that it
expects rents in the City to rise slowly before declining in
2014 as a result of increased supply.  To contact the reporter on this story:
