South Korea ’s financial regulator
hasn’t decided whether it will add additional capital to a fund
that was set up to stabilize the stock market, Financial
Services Commission spokesman Ernst Lee said by phone today. The
Seoul Economic Daily reported earlier stock-related institutions
including Korea Exchange Inc. and Korea Financial Investment
Association plan to add as much as 500 billion won to the fund
that was created in 2008.  To contact the reporter on this story:
