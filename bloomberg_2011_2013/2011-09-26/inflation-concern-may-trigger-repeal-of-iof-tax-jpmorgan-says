Julio Callegari, who oversees 4.3
billion reais ($2.3 billion) as head of fixed-income securities
at JPMorgan Asset Management in Brazil, said the odds the
Brazilian government may remove the tax on foreign-exchange
derivatives are “relatively high.”  Callegari commented today in an interview at JPMorgan’s
offices in  Sao Paulo .  On IOF tax and inflation risks:  “The important message is, if the Brazilian real
depreciates too fast, and more than the fall in commodity
prices, then this is a risk for inflation.”  “This is not our baseline yet, but taking into account the
risks for the global economy, the odds of recession are quite
clear.  “In this scenario, it means we could see further
depreciation of emerging-market currencies, and possibly this
would trigger this kind of attitude, removing the IOF or more
selling of U.S. dollars by the central bank.”  “The risk that they remove the IOF tax -- particularly on
derivatives -- the odds are relatively high.”  On the outlook for inflation after the central bank’s surprise
interest-rate cut in August:  “We are generally very cautious at this point in terms of
risk we are taking.  “We are reducing duration in the fixed-income portfolio
and our bias, and particularly after the last Copom decision
when they surprised the market, out bias is for the inflation-
linked bonds.”  “We don’t believe in decoupling, certainly  Brazil  will
perform better than the developed world in this scenario, but
this doesn’t mean decoupling. This just means that on a relative
basis, we’ll suffer less, but we’re going to suffer.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
