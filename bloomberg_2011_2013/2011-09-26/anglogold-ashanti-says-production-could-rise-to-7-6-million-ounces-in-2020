AngloGold Ashanti Ltd. (ANG) , the third-
largest producer of the metal, may increase output 68 percent by
2020 excluding any acquisitions as it seeks to reverse declines.  The company may raise production to 7.6 million ounces, it
said today in a presentation on its website, adding the figure
was “illustrative.” AngloGold produced 4.52 million ounces
last year and is targeting 5.5 million ounces in 2014.  AngloGold and rivals are seeking to gain from record gold
prices. The Johannesburg-based company, whose production fell
for the past four straight years, plans to dig mines to record
depths in South Africa and is considering opening its first
mines in Colombia and the Democratic Republic of Congo.  AngloGold is “poised for a return to growth with planned
and permitted projects,” the company said in the presentation.  Output slid from 5.48 million ounces in 2007 as it grappled
with problems including flooding and safety stoppages, mainly in
 South Africa . The company aims to boost overseas projects as a
proportion of total assets.  Approval for DRC’s Mongbwalu and Kibali developments, the
Brazilian Nova Lima Sul project and Sunrise Dam underground mine
in  Australia  are “imminent,” it said, without elaborating. A
plan to deepen South Africa’s Mponeng mine is nearing approval.  New Mining Methods  AngloGold plans a 24 percent gain in annual output by 2014,
compared with larger rival  Barrick Gold Corp. (ABX) ’s 12 percent and
 Newmont Mining Corp. (NEM) ’s 14 percent, the presentation shows.  AngloGold sees production this year of 4.45 million ounces.  The company will try out new mining methods in South Africa
within two years to unlock an estimated 70 million ounces of
gold buried more than 3.1 miles (5 kilometers) below the
surface, Chief Executive Officer  Mark Cutifani  said on Aug. 5.  Gold has gained for 10 years and reached a record $1,921.15
an ounce on Sept. 6 in  London . Immediate delivery gold was 3.2
percent lower at $1,603.22 today.  AngloGold declined 1.6 percent to 349.50 rand by the 5 p.m.
close in Johannesburg, paring its gain to 6.2 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
