Daiwa Securities Group Inc. (8601) ,
Japan’s second-largest brokerage, said it will form an
acquisition-finance venture with  Aozora Bank Ltd. (8304)  and agreed to
expand their relationship, mainly in Asia.  The companies will set up Aozora Daiwa Finance Co. in
October to offer loans to Japanese companies that are seeking to
make acquisitions, the firms said in a joint statement filed to
the Tokyo Stock Exchange.  The business will start operating around December, aiming
to provide about 20 billion yen ($262 million) of loans, the
banks said. It will “provide M&A finance for an anticipated
increase in the number of management buyout-related transactions
going forward,” they said in the statement.  Daiwa shares fell 7 yen, or 2.5 percent, to 276 yen in
 Tokyo  today. Aozora dropped 2 yen, or 1.2 percent, to 164 yen.  To contact the reporters on this story:
