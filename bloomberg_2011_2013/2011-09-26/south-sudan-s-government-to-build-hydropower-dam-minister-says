South  Sudan  plans to build a
hydropower dam in the northwest of the newly independent
country, Water Resources Minister Paul Mayom Akec said.  The dam, which will also be used to store water for
irrigation, will be constructed at Wau, 509 kilometers (316
miles) northwest of the capital, Juba, Mayom said in a  statement 
dated Sept. 23 on the government’s website. He didn’t provide
details on the size or cost of the project.  South Sudan will also pursue membership of the Nile Basin
Authority, a regional body that works to develop water resources
in riparian nations on the world’s longest river.  South Sudan was declared independent on July 9, after
almost 99 percent of its voters chose to secede from Sudan in a
January referendum. At independence, South Sudan gained control
of about 375,000 barrels a day of oil, close to 75 percent of
the former Sudan’s total output, which was the third-biggest in
sub-Saharan  Africa .  To contact the reporter on this story:
