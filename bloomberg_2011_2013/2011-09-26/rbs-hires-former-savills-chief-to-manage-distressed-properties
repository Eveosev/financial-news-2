Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc (RBS) 
said it hired Aubrey Adams, the former chief executive officer
of real estate broker  Savills Plc (SVS) , to oversee distressed
property investments.  Adams, 61, will join RBS on Nov. 1, according to a
statement today from the Edinburgh-based bank, the largest
controlled by the U.K. state following a 45.5 billion-pound ($71
billion) rescue.  One of Adams’s responsibilities will be West Register, the
unit set up by RBS to acquire properties where the borrower
defaulted, managing them until their sale. RBS hired Helen Gordon from Legal & General Group Plc’s property unit in July to
head West Register and she will report to Adams.  RBS accumulated 45.8 billion pounds of losses since the
fourth quarter of 2007 as it wrote down loans and investments.
