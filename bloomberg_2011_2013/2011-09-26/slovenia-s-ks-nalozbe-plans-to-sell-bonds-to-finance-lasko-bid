Slovenian  investment company   KS
Nalozbe (KSFR)  d.d. plans to sell up to 78.7 million euros ($105.4
million) of bonds to finance its takeover bid for  Pivovarna
Lasko (PILR)  Group d.d., a beverage company struggling to repay debts.  The Ljubljana-based KS Nalozbe will offer the 10-year
securities with an interest based on the European interbank
offered rate plus 300 basis points, or up to 6 percent, the
company said today in a  statement  to the Ljubljana bourse.  Pivovarna Lasko is selling assets as it needs to repay some
400 million euros in debt accumulated before the global
recession. The company sold its juice-making unit Fructal d.o.o.
to  Serbia ’s Nectar d.o.o. for 35 million euros in July. It also
formed a group with Slovenian banks that want to sell just over
50 percent of  Mercator Poslovni Sistem (MELR)  d.d. by the end of the
year after Lasko previously failed to sell its 23 percent
holding in the largest supermarket chain in the Balkans.  The owner of KS Nalozbe is Igor Lah, who deals mostly with
real estate and is the second-richest Slovenian with an
estimated fortune of 166.5 million euros, Slovenian business
magazine  Manager  said in its annual rich list. His wealth stems
from sales of state assets in the 1990s, the magazine said.  KS Nalozbe offered nine of its bonds in the value of 1 euro
for each share of Pivovarna Lasko, KS Nalozbe said in August.
The company didn’t set a threshold for the bid, which expires at
the end of the month. Lasko closed at 11 euros on Sept. 23.  To contact the reporter on this story:
