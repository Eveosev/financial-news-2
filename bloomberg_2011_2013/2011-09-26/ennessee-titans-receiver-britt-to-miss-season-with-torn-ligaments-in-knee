Tennessee Titans wide receiver
Kenny Britt will miss the rest of the National Football League
season after tearing two ligaments in his right knee, coach Mike Munchak said today in a press conference.  Britt, 23, tore the anterior cruciate and medial collateral
ligaments in the second quarter of the team’s 17-14 victory over
the Denver Broncos yesterday. He will have season-ending surgery,
Munchak said.  A native of Bayonne,  New Jersey , and former All-American at
 Rutgers University , Britt was selected by the Titans with the No.
30 pick in the 2009 draft. He had 17 catches for 289 yards and
three touchdowns before the injury and was on pace to break his
career high in all three categories.  The Titans are 2-1, tied with the Houston Texans for first
in the American Football Conference South division. Britt’s
injury leaves the team with four receivers.  -- Editors: Michael Sillup, Dex McLuskey.  To contact the reporters on this story:
