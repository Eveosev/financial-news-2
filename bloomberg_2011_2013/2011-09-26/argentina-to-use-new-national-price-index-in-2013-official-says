Argentina  will introduce an index
to measure nationwide movements in consumer prices in the second
half of 2013, Norberto Itzcovich, technical director of the
national statistics agency, said today.  The index wouldn’t replace the current index used to
measure prices in  Buenos Aires , which would continue to be
published, Itzcovich said at a news conference in the capital.  The International Monetary Fund has been pressing President
 Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner  to introduce data that accurately
reflect price movements in South America’s second-biggest
economy. Opposition lawmakers on Sept. 12 said that, based on
estimates provided by private researchers, year-on-year
inflation was 24 percent in August compared with the official
figure of 9.8 percent.  “Until we have one, common national CPI index for
everybody we may have to use more than one” source of
information, Nicolas Eyzaguirre, director of the IMF’s Western
Hemisphere department, said in  Washington  on Sept. 23.  Itzcovich said today that the IMF’s planned use of data
supplied by private researchers would be a “mess.”  Economists including former central bank President Alfonso
Prat-Gay have questioned the official reports since 2007, when
then President Nestor Kirchner began changing personnel at the
national statistics institute in a bid to “improve
operations.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
