Brasil Ecodiesel Industria e
Comercio de Biocombustiveis e Oleos Vegetais SA (ECOD3) ,  Brazil ’s sixth-
biggest biodiesel producer, will focus less on making fuel and
more on acquisitions in the agriculture industry, according to
its new chief executive officer.  The company is in talks with five “mid-size”
agribusinesses and may conclude a deal in the next six months,
Bento do Amaral Peixoto Moreira Franco, who was named CEO on
Sept. 22, said today in a telephone interview.  An excess of Brazilian biodiesel is squeezing profits for
producers of the renewable fuel. By pursuing deals, Brasil
Ecodiesel will offer U.S. and European investors access to the
nation’s agricultural industry, Moreira Franco said.  “Biodiesel supply is bigger than demand,” he said.
“Although cash flows from producing biodiesel are steadier,
margins are much narrower.”  There are many small companies that may fit into Brasil
Ecodiesel, he said. “Agribusiness is a sector that needs to be
consolidated and there is no other player doing this in
Brazil.”  The company is changing its name to Vanguarda Agro after
acquiring Sept. 23 closely held agribusiness Vanguarda do Brasil
SA.  After incorporating Vanguarda, biodiesel sales are expected
to account for about 35 percent of Brasil Ecodiesel’s revenue
and 6 percent of earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation
and amortization, the company said in an e-mail. Agribusiness
operations will generate the remaining 94 percent of its Ebitda.  To contact the reporter on this story:
