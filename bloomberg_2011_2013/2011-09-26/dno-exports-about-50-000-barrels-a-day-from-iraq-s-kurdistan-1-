DNO International ASA (DNO) , the first
foreign company to start pumping crude in Iraq’s Kurdish region,
is shipping about 50,000 barrels of oil a day out of the semi-
autonomous zone, according to a company official.  “We are now exporting about 50,000 barrels per day,”
Operations Director Jon Petter Sargeant said today in an
interview in Istanbul. “This may increase as we are going ahead
with field development, drilling and exploring two wells.”  Iraq is the third-biggest producer in the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries after  Saudi Arabia  and  Iran . The
Kurdistan Regional Government began exporting oil in June 2009
after signing production agreements separately from those
negotiated by Iraqi federal authorities.  The KRG and central government agreed to share revenue from
the sale of oil from the northern territory to allow the KRG to
pay companies operating there. The KRG has received $450 million
from  Iraq ’s federal government to compensate it for crude sales,
of an expected $1.4 billion, Minister of Natural Resources Ashti Hawrami said earlier this month.  “We expect to be paid in the future, and we hope this will
be sorted out especially once there is a new energy law,” said
Sargeant, who spoke at an Iraq energy conference organized by
the Energy Exchange. “We remain in operation, exporting oil and
we expect to be paid for it eventually.”  DNO has received two payments, of $60 million and $103.7
million, from the Kurdistan Regional Government for oil output.  To contact the reporter on this story:
