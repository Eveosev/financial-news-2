India ’s 10-year bond yields held
near a two-week low on speculation the deteriorating global
economic outlook makes the chance of another increase in
borrowing costs less likely.  Growth in emerging-market economies will be “interrupted”
if problems caused by the risks of a U.S. recession and Europe’s
sovereign-debt crisis are not resolved,  Reserve Bank  of India
Governor Duvvuri Subbarao said at the annual meeting of the
International Monetary Fund in Washington over the weekend. The
central bank has boosted borrowing costs 12 times since the
start of 2010.  “The general belief is that the RBI has to stop increasing
rates now,” said  Roy Paul , deputy general manager in charge of
fixed income and currencies at Federal Bank Ltd. in Mumbai.
“The central bank will now be watching the global developments
closely to shape their policy.”  The yield on the 7.8 percent securities due April 2021 was
little changed at 8.31 percent at the 5 p.m. close in Mumbai,
according to the central bank’s trading system.  RBI Deputy Governor  Subir Gokarn  said last week the central
bank is near to ending its tightening cycle.  India’s economy 
will grow 7.8 percent in 2011, the IMF said in its World
Economic Outlook on Sept. 20, slower than the 8.2 percent
estimated in June.  The cost of one-year interest-rate swaps, or derivative
contracts used to guard against fluctuations in borrowing costs,
fell 10 basis points to 7.75 percent, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
