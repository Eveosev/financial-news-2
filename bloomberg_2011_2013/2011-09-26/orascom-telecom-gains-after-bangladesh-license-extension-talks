Orascom Telecom Holding SAE (ORTE) , North
Africa’s biggest mobile phone company, rose the most in a week
after its Bangladeshi unit received guidelines for extending its
2G operation in the country.  Shares of the Cairo-based company rose 4.3 percent, the
most since Sept. 20, to 3.38 Egyptian pounds at the 2:30 p.m.
close in Cairo. That pared the stock’s decline this quarter to
17 percent. Egypt’s benchmark  EGX 30 Index (EGX30)  gained 1.7 percent.  Orascom Telecom Bangladesh needs to pay $263 million over
three years for spectrum and license renewal fees, the company
said. The validity of the license renewal is for 15 years.  To contact the reporter on this story:
