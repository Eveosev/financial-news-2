Peru’s sol-denominated bonds rose,
pushing down yields the most in three months, amid speculation
European policy makers will step up efforts to contain the
region’s debt crisis.  The yield on the nation’s benchmark 7.84 percent sol-
denominated bond due August 2020 fell 12 basis points, or 0.12
percentage point, to 5.83 percent at 2:49 p.m. New York time,
according to prices compiled by Bloomberg. That’s the steepest
decline in yields since June 8. The bond’s price rose 0.85
centimo to 113.74.  The  European Central Bank  is likely to debate restarting
covered-bond purchases and may discuss  interest rates  to ease
funding strains, a euro-region central bank official said.  “We had a massive sell-off in emerging market assets last
week and clearly the mood is much stronger,” said Kathryn Rooney Vera, an emerging markets analyst at Bulltick Capital
Markets in Miami. There’s not much room for yields to fall
further given concern about slower growth in the U.S. and
 Europe , she said.  The sol weakened 0.1 percent to 2.7716 per  U.S. dollar ,
from 2.7690 Sept. 23.  To contact the reporter on this story:
