Tokyo  Electric Power Co. and the
state-backed body helping compensate those affected by the
Fukushima nuclear disaster will compile a business plan
including cost cuts for the utility by late October.  The company known as Tepco needs to carry out “thorough
reforms” including cutting staff costs, Takehiko Sugiyama, the
head of the body, told reporters today after an opening ceremony
for the compensation organization’s offices in Tokyo. The
business plan will have input from a government committee
investigating Tepco’s finances, he said.  Legislation approved by parliament on Aug. 3 created the
compensation entity with 2 trillion yen ($26 billion) of funding
to help Tepco pay damages to those affected by the disaster at
the Fukushima Dai-Ichi atomic plant. Tepco may face as much as
11 trillion yen in compensation claims, Bank of America Corp.
said in March.  The government panel overseeing Tepco is due to release an
interim report this week.  The utility aims to cut costs by 100 billion yen by
eliminating about 10 percent of its 37,000 jobs and reducing
pension payments, the Sankei newspaper reported yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
