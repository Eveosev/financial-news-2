Six men accused of plotting a
suicide bomb attack in the U.K. appeared in court on terrorism
charges.  The men, aged between 25 and 43, from Birmingham,  England ,
were arrested last week in an operation carried out by the West
Midlands Counter Terrorism Unit. They were denied bail and
remanded in custody following the hearing at West London
Magistrates Court today, prosecutors said in an e-mailed
statement.  Four of the men, Irfan Nasser, Irfan Khalid, Ashik Ali and
Rahin Ahmed, were charged with preparing for terrorist acts.
Bahader Ali and Mohammed Rizwan were charged with failing to
hand over information about an act of terrorism, according to
prosecutors.  Khalid and Nasser are accused of traveling to  Pakistan  for
terrorism training, making martyrdom videos, building home-made
bombs and planning a bombing campaign, prosecutors said. Ahmed
allegedly collected and invested money to fund the attacks.
Prosecutors said the offenses began in December 2010.  A 20-year-old from Birmingham, arrested last week,
continues to be questioned, West Midlands police said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
