Jamaica’s opposition called on the
ruling party to hold elections after Prime Minister  Bruce Golding  said he would step down.  Golding announced yesterday that he would resign once a new
Labor Party leader is elected, saying in a  statement  that the
last four years “have taken their toll.” National elections
are scheduled for October 2012.  The government should call for an immediate vote as a lack
of leadership threatens to set the “economy adrift,” said
Peter Bunting,  general secretary  of the People’s  National Party .  “Why waste a whole year not focused on running the
country,” Bunting said in a phone interview from Kingston. “Go
back for a fresh mandate now and allow Jamaicans to elect a
party that can get us out of the quagmire that we’re stuck in.”  Opposition to Golding hardened after at least 74 people,
mostly civilians, died last year in confrontations between
police and supporters of accused drug lord Christopher “Dudus”
Coke in Kingston, the capital. Coke was captured and handed over
to U.S. authorities in June 2010, where he pleaded guilty to
narcotics trafficking and weapons charges.  Mike Henry, a spokesman for Golding’s ruling  Labor Party ,
said a new prime minister will be nominated when the party holds
a conference on Nov. 20.  “We have a number of persons who could take over the
role,” Henry said in a phone interview from Kingston.  To contact the reporter on this story:
