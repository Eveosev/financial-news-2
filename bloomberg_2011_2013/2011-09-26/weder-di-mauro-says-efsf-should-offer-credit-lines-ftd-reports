The European Financial Stability
Facility should be able to offer precautionary credit lines to
debt-strapped countries, Beatrice Weder di Mauro, a member of
German Chancellor  Angela Merkel â€™s council of economic advisers,
told  Financial Times Deutschland .  Such credit lines can serve as insurance and prevent market
panic, Weder di Mauro was quoted as saying. In any case, they
would be preferable to bond purchases on the secondary market,
she said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
