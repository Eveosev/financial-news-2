Axa Private Equity will market 240
million euros ($322 million) of senior leveraged loans for
Photonis Technologies SAS at a meeting for prospective lenders
tomorrow in Paris, banks arranging the transaction said.  The debt to fund the buyout of the photo sensor technology
provider is being arranged by ING Groep NV, Societe Generale
SA and IKB Deutsche Industriebank AG, the banks said in a
statement. They began syndicating it last week.  Axaâ€™s buyout unit is paying for more than half the
acquisition price with equity, according to the statement. The
buyout is also funded by 50 million euros of junior-ranking
mezzanine debt, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
