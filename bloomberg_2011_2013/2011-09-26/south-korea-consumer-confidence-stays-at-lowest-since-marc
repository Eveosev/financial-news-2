South Korean consumer confidence
remained at the lowest level since March as people braced for a
global economic slowdown.  The sentiment index was 99 in September, the same as in the
previous month, the  Bank of Korea  said in an e-mailed statement
today. A reading below 100 indicates people are more pessimistic
than the average between the first quarter of 1999 and the
second quarter of 2008.  The Bank of Korea left interest rates unchanged for a third
straight month in September as the risk of the global recovery
stalling outweighed concerns about inflation. Consumer prices
climbed 5.3 percent in August, the highest in three years,
exceeding the central bank’s 4 percent limit for the eighth
straight month.  The expected inflation rate over the next year was 4.3
percent, faster than last month’s 4.2 percent and the most since
November 2008, today’s report showed.  A sub-index measuring consumers’ views of their living
situation fell to 83 in September from 86 in the previous month,
while a sub-index reflecting their perception of the economy
dropped to 64 from 68 in August.  The  consumer confidence  index is based on survey responses
from 2,046 households in 56 cities. It was conducted by mail and
telephone between Sept. 14 and Sept. 21.  To contact the reporter on this story:
