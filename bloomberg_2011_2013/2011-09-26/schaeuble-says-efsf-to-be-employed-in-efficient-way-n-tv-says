German Finance Minister  Wolfgang
Schaeuble  said euro region governments have no intention of
raising the European Financial Stability Facility’s volume above
440 billion euros.  The fund, once approved by parliaments, will be employed in
an “efficient” way, Schaeuble said in an interview with N-TV
television. While it “would be good” to bring the permanent
European Stability Mechanism forward from its mid-2013 launch
date, ratification processes in member countries may make that
difficult, he said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
