Colombia ’s peso bonds rose for the
first day in four as the highest yields in seven weeks attracted
investors betting that economic growth will continue to
accelerate.  The yield on Colombia’s benchmark 10 percent bonds due in
July 2024 fell six basis points, or 0.06 percentage point, to
7.62 percent at 2:27 p.m. New York time. The yield rose to 7.68
percent on Sept. 23, its highest level on a closing basis since
Aug. 8. The bond’s price rose 0.488 centavo today to 119.001
centavos per peso.  Gross domestic product rose 5.2 percent in the second
quarter from a year earlier, according to a Sept. 22 government
report, the second-fastest pace in three years.  “After last week’s plunge in markets, investors are taking
advantage of current levels to incorporate positive GDP news and
buy bonds in the long end of the curve,” said Daniel Lozano, an
analyst at brokerage Serfinco SA in Bogota.  The peso declined 0.3 percent to 1,909.45 per  U.S. dollar 
from 1,903.94 on Sept. 23. The currency has dropped 6 percent in
the past month.  Finance Minister Juan Carlos Echeverry said in an interview
in  Washington  that the recent decline in the peso from a three-
year high in July has taken the currency to near its equilibrium
level. Echeverry, echoing comments in Washington by Colombian
central bank Governor Jose Dario Uribe, said he welcomed the
depreciation in the peso.  To contact the reporter on this story:
