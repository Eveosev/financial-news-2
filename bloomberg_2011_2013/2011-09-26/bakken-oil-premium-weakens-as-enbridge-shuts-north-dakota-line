The premium for Bakken crude
weakened after  Enbridge Inc. (ENB)  shut a pipeline in  North Dakota ,
following a leak.  Enbridge shut the 25,000-barrel-a-day Line 26, which
transports oil from Berthold, North Dakota, to Steelman,
Saskatchewan, Lorraine Little, a company spokeswoman, said in an
e-mail. While it isn’t known when the line will return to
service, the incident isn’t expected to affect deliveries
scheduled throughout the system, she said.  About 20 barrels of oil leaked yesterday after a relief
valve broke off a pump because of vibration, according to a
 filing  with the National Response Center. A “small amount” of
the release reached a marsh area, the filing showed.  The premium for Bakken crude narrowed 50 cents to $6 a
barrel above West Texas Intermediate at 11:55 a.m. in  New York ,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The premium for Syncrude weakened 25 cents to $8.75 a
barrel. Syncrude is a light, low-sulfur synthetic oil derived
from the  tar sands  in  Alberta .  The discount for Western Canada Select widened 35 cents to
$10.60 a barrel.  Heavy Louisiana Sweet’s premium was unchanged at $28 above
WTI. Light Louisiana Sweet’s premium lost 75 cents to $27 a
barrel.  Among sour, or high-sulfur, grades, the premium for Mars
Blend lost 25 cents to $23.75 a barrel while Poseidon weakened
55 cents to $23.25 a barrel over WTI.  Southern Green Canyon’s premium narrowed 25 cents to $22.75
a barrel and West Texas Sour’s discount was unchanged at 95
cents a barrel below WTI. Thunder Horse’s premium slipped $1.05
to $26.75 above the benchmark.  To contact the reporter on this story:
