Emaar Properties PJSC (EMAAR) , the
developer of the tallest tower in Dubai, had its outlook revised
to stable from negative at Standard & Poor’s Ratings Services.
The rating was affirmed at BB.  “The outlook is stable because we see recurring cash flow
generation from leasing activities and improving performance of
Emaar’s hospitality assets, which offsets uncertainties in
international development activities,” the rating company said
in an e-mailed statement today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
