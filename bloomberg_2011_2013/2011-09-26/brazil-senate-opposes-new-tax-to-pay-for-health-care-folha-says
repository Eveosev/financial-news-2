Brazil ’s Senate opposes the
creation of a new tax to finance health care, Folha de S. Paulo
reported, citing a poll conducted by the newspaper last week.  Fifty-one of the country’s 81 senators, or 63 percent,
completely rejected the idea of a new health tax, while nine
senators, or 11 percent, were in favor of the idea, Folha said.  Forty-three senators said they support a proposal that
would require the government to spend 10 percent of its income
on health care, Folha said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
