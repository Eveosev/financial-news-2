Louvre Hotels, the budget hotel
division of the Societe du Louvre, plans to open more hotels in
 Morocco  if investment conditions become more favorable, said
Chief Operating Officer Alain Sebah.  “The price of land shouldn’t be more than 10 percent of
the cost of the project,” Sebah said today in an interview at
the Hotel Investment Conference in Casablanca. “More hotels
could be built if land prices were more attractive. Projects are
not feasible if more money has to be spent on land.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
