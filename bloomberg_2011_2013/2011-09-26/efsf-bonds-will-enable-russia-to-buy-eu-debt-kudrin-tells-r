Russian Finance Minister Alexei Kudrin said European Financial Stability Facility bonds would
provide a mechanism for  Russia  to invest in the euro area’s debt
without taking on the risk linked to the monetary union’s “bad
countries,” state broadcaster RT reported.  “In this case we are not taking the risk on the ‘bad’
countries, because we invest in euro zone countries as a
whole,” Kudrin said in an interview with the state-run,
English-language station, according to a  transcript  published on
its website.  “This mechanism will allow us to mobilize our resources,
we are ready to participate,” Kudrin said. “Basically, it is
an enlargement of our investment instruments, and it is quite
secure.”  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
