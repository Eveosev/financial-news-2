South Korea ’s government plans to
cut its fiscal deficit next year as the European sovereign debt
crisis underscored the need for global policy makers to control
their borrowing.  Total spending will rise 5.5 percent to 326.1 trillion won
($273 billion), while  tax revenue  will gain 9.5 percent to 344.1
trillion won, the  Ministry of Strategy and Finance  said in its
budget proposal for 2012 released today. The government’s
deficit will shrink to 14.3 trillion won, or 1 percent of gross
domestic product in 2012, from 25 trillion won, or 2 percent
this year, according to its calculations.  European shares gained yesterday on speculation officials
will intensify their attempt to contain a debt crisis that
threatens to send  Greece  into default. South Korea’s government
said it aims to balance the budget in 2013 and post a surplus
equivalent to 0.3 percent of the economy by 2015.  “The European debt crisis shows what will happen if fiscal
debt gets out of control,” said Kong Dong Rak, a fixed-income
analyst at Taurus Investment & Securities Co. in Seoul. “The
government wants to improve its fiscal standing rather than
boosting the economy through stimulus measures.”  The won rose 1.2 percent to 1,178.71 per dollar as of 10:34
a.m. in Seoul, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The
Kospi stock index gained 3.5 percent. South Korea’s three-year
bonds advanced, with the yield on the 3.5 percent debt falling
two basis points, or 0.02 percentage point, to 3.47 percent,

be just limited to a fiscal crisis in a couple of countries, but
likely lead to a systemic risk to the overall global economy,”
Finance Minister Bahk Jae Wan said in a statement for the annual
meetings of the  International Monetary Fund  and  World Bank  in
 Washington  on Sept. 23.  South Korea also needs to cut its borrowings to grapple
with a fast-aging society and low birth rate, the ministry said.
National debt will be 32.8 percent of GDP next year, compared
with an estimated 35.1 percent this year, it said.  The nation’s economy will grow at an annual pace of about
mid-4 percent between 2011 and 2015, the ministry said. The IMF
cut its forecast for South Korea’s GDP to 4 percent expansion
from 4.5 percent for this year on Sept. 20. The economy grew 3.4
percent in the second quarter from a year earlier, the slowest
pace in seven quarters.  Consumer Confidence  Reflecting South Korean consumers’ concern that the
nation’s economic outlook may worsen, consumer confidence in
September stayed at the lowest level since March, according to a
 Bank of Korea  report released today.  Welfare expenditures will increase 6.4 percent, education
outlays will rise 9.3 percent and defense spending will gain 5.6
percent next year, according to the ministry’s proposed budget.
Infrastructure outlays will decline 7.3 percent.  The government expects about 900 billion won in revenue
from selling part of its stake in  Korea Development Bank  and
around 1 trillion won from the sale of Industrial Bank of Korea
shares next year, the  finance ministry  said in a separate
statement today. It also plans to sell about 400 billion won
worth of its share in Incheon International Airport Corp.  The calculation of the fiscal deficit excludes state social
security funds.  To contact the reporter on this story:
