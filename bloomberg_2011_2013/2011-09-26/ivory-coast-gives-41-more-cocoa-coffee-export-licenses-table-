Ivory Coast , the world’s biggest
cocoa producer and  Africa ’s third-largest grower of coffee,
handed out 41 percent more export licenses for the 2011-12
harvest, the Coffee and Cocoa Management Committee said.  The West African nation gave 82 licenses to exporters and
farmer cooperatives, the Abidjan-based, state-controlled
committee said in a statement handed to reporters in the city on
Sept. 23.  The Ivorian unit of France’s Groupe Sucres et Denrees was
given a new license, while  Barry Callebaut AG (BARN) , the Zurich-based
chocolate maker, Cargill Inc., the closely held U.S.
agricultural company and food maker Nestle SA had permits
renewed, the committee’s report showed.  The licenses will allow the companies to purchase beans
during the 2011-12 main-crop season, which will run from Oct. 1
to March 31. Ethiopia and  Uganda  are the continent’s top coffee
producers.  To contact the reporters on this story:
