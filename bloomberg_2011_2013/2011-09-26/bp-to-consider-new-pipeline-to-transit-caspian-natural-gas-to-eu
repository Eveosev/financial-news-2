A BP Plc-led group may consider a
another pipeline project to transit  natural gas  from the Shah
Deniz deposit in the Azeri sector of the  Caspian Sea ,
potentially rivaling the European Union-backed Nabucco proposal.  The new route will connect  Turkey  to southeast Europe,
Tamam Bayatli, a spokeswoman for BP in the Azeri capital, Baku,
said by phone today.  “We are interested in low costs and, technically, the
pipeline should be expanded when needed,” Bayatli said.  The new route may compete with Nabucco, which is vying for
Caspian fuel supplies with the smaller Trans-Adriatic Pipeline
planned by  Statoil ASA (STL) , a partner in Shah Deniz, and EON AG, and
the ITGI link proposed by  Edison SpA (EDN)  and Depa SA.  Azerbaijan will be able to supply 10 billion cubic meters
of gas a year to  Europe  when the Shah Deniz 2 offshore deposit
comes on stream in 2017, Elshad Nasirov, vice president of State
Oil Co. of Azerbaijan, said this month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
