Siemens AG (SIE)  Chief Executive Officer
 Peter Loescher  said the German maker of trains, scanners and
power plants is seeking acquisitions for its main businesses and
that valuations are becoming “more attractive by the day.”  “We are looking at the core area of our businesses,”
Loescher said. “The cash pile is certainly an advantage in this
time.”  Siemens had $18.87 billion in cash at the end of its latest
fiscal quarter, among the highest at companies in Europe. Both
Loescher and Chief Financial Officer Joe Kaeser indicated
Europe’s largest engineering company will wait for valuations to
decline before spending some of Siemens’ cash on acquisitions.
It has been shying away from acquisitions in the past few
quarters to avoid overpaying, as rivals including  ABB Ltd. (ABBN)  and
 Schneider Electric SA (SU)  have spent billions on takeovers.  Loescher has vowed to turn the Munich-based company into an
enterprise with 100 billion euros in sales. Revenue will likely
decline to 73.32 billion euros in the fiscal year ending Sept.
30, according to a Bloomberg survey, as Siemens declared its
lighting business Osram a discontinued operation and sold a
computer-services unit.  There are signs of an economic slowdown, Loescher said in a
Sept. 24 interview with Bloomberg-UTV in  New Delhi . Still, the
company’s order book is at a record, driven by the need for
energy and health-care equipment as well as gear to automate
manufacturing, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
