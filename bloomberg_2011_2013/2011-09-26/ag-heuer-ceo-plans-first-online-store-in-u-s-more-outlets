TAG Heuer, the Swiss watchmaker
owned by  LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton SA (MC) , will start its
first transactional website in the U.S. next year and open more
stores as it taps into “strong” global demand for  luxury
goods , Chief Executive Officer Jean-Christophe Babin said.  The U.S. site will open in the first quarter of 2012, Babin
said in an interview at the World Retail Congress in Berlin.  “The environment is pretty strong and even if there was an
economic slowdown,  Asia  will keep growing, GDP will keep
growing,” the executive said.  The 125-store  company , based in La Chaux-de-Fonds, will
open 22 boutique stores this year, and plans 250 to 300 outlets
in cities and airports in the next five years, the CEO said. In
10 years, Babin expects e-commerce will account for as much as 5
percent of the business as shoppers buy accessories such as 300-
euro sunglasses and luxury mobile phones. About 45 percent of
purchases come from products outside watches, he said.  “A lot of people who would otherwise have never been able
to buy a 3,000-euro watch can have the dream,” Babin said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
