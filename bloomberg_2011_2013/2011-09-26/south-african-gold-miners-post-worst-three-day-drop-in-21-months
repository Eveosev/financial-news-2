South Africa’s gold mining index
posted its biggest three-day retreat in almost 29 months in
Johannesburg trading as gold tumbled to below $1,600 in its
longest losing streak in more than four months.  The FTSE/JSE Africa Gold Mining Index declined 2 percent by
the 5 p.m. close in Johannesburg, taking its losses for the past
three days to 8.3 percent, the steepest since April 2009.
 AngloGold Ashanti Ltd. (ANG) , Africa’s biggest producer of the metal,
dropped 1.6 percent.  Gold Fields Ltd. (GFI) , the world’s fourth-
biggest gold producer, slumped 2 percent.  Commodities fell on speculation European governments will
struggle to contain the region’s debt crisis that has pushed
Greece to the brink of default. That threatens to tip both the
region and the global economy back into recession even as Group
of 20 finance chiefs pledged “a strong and coordinated
international response to address the renewed challenges facing
the global economy” at  International Monetary Fund  and World
Bank weekend meetings.  “Over the last six to 18 months or so gold was riding on
the back of fears of macro economics in the U.S. and Europe.
Growth was slowing, real  interest rates  were non-existent. The
only thing that has changed is that euro land is now attracting
most of the attention and the dollar has strengthened on the
back of that,”  David Davis , a gold analyst at SBG Securities,
said by telephone from Johannesburg. “There seems to be a
possible correction on the way but that could take a week or
even more.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
