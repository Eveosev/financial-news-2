Precious metals are the favored
investment in a survey of 283 people who answered where would
they put $500,000 first, Luvata said.  Precious metals got 32 percent of the vote, followed by
real estate at 20 percent and stocks at 17 percent, spokesman
Justin Roux said by phone today. The survey started on Aug. 30
and closed today, he said.  Five percent said they would put the money in other
commodities, 15 percent would put it under the mattress and 6
percent would put it in the bank, he said. Luvata is based in
Brentford,  England .  To contact the reporter on this story:
