The cost of insuring Asia-Pacific
corporate and sovereign bonds against non-payment increased,
with bond risk indexes set for their highest closing levels in
more than two years, according to credit-default swap traders.  The Markit iTraxx Asia index of 40 investment-grade
borrowers outside  Japan  climbed 9 basis points to 238 basis
points as of 2:53 p.m. in  Singapore , Royal Bank of Scotland
Group Plc prices show. The gauge is set for its highest close
since May 2009, according to CMA.  The Markit iTraxx Australia index rose 3 basis points to
219 basis points as of 4:41 p.m. in Sydney, Credit Agricole SA
prices show. Thatâ€™s on course for the highest close since July
2009, according to CMA, which is owned by CME Group Inc. and
compiles prices quoted by dealers in the privately negotiated
market.  The Markit iTraxx Japan index jumped 9 basis points to 209
basis points as of 3:46 p.m. in  Tokyo , Deutsche Bank AG prices
show. That would also be the highest close since July 2009, CMA
prices show.  Credit-default swap indexes are benchmarks for protecting
bonds against default, and traders use them to speculate on
 credit quality . A drop signals improving perceptions of
creditworthiness, while an increase suggests the opposite.  The swap contracts pay the buyer face value in exchange for
the underlying securities if a borrower fails to meet its debt
agreements. A basis point is 0.01 of a percentage point.  To contact the reporter on this story:
