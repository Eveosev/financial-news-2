Jack McKeon, who led the  Florida
Marlins  to a  World Series  title in 2003 at the age of 72, will
retire from baseball after the team’s last game of the season on
Sept. 28.  McKeon rejoined the Marlins on June 20 on an interim basis
after Edwin Rodriguez resigned as manager following a 1-18 slump
that left the team with a division-worst 32-40 record.  McKeon, 80, is the second-oldest manager in Major League
Baseball history behind Connie Mack, who ran the Philadelphia
Athletics at 87 in 1950. Florida went 39-48 since McKeon’s
return and is 71-88 with three home games remaining against the
Washington Nationals.  McKeon won the World Series in his only playoff appearance
in 16 years as a manager. With a 1,050-988 career record, he
managed the Marlins from 2003-05 and also led the  Kansas City
Royals , Oakland Athletics, San Diego Padres and  Cincinnati Reds .  Nicknamed “Trade Jack” as a player-swapping general
manager in the 1980s, McKeon said this season that his return
this year made him a role model to seniors, motivating them to
stay active and even to get back to work.  “You ought to see the mail I get from older people,” he
said in an interview. “It’s inspiring that they tell me I’m
inspiring them to do something, to get involved.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
