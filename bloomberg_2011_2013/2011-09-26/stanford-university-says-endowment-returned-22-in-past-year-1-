(Corrects headline and second paragraph of story
originally published Sept. 26 to show investments include money
from Stanford Hospital.)  Stanford University ’s investments
gained 22 percent in the year ended June 30, extending a rebound
from the record losses of the 2008 financial crisis.  The value of the investments, which include most of the
endowment as well as money from Stanford Hospital and Clinics
and from Lucile Packard Children’s Hospital, rose to $19.5
billion at June 30, the school, near  Palo Alto ,  California , said
in a  statement  on its website.  Harvard University , the world’s
richest school with $32 billion, said last week that its
endowment gained 21 percent in the past year.  The universities have reported two years of gains following
losses after the Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. bankruptcy.
Stanford, which produced an average annual return of 9.3 percent
in the decade through June, compared with 9.4 percent at
Harvard, said it has yet to make up for all the losses sustained
in 2008-2009, when investments tumbled 26 percent.  “We remain concerned about the uncertain macroeconomic
climate and its impact on global financial markets,” John Powers, chief executive officer of Stanford Management Company,
which administers the fund, said in the statement. He didn’t
respond to phone and e-mail messages seeking comment.  Stanford dismissed 412, or 3.2 percent, of its non-faculty
workers in the wake of the financial crisis, and postponed $1.1
billion in construction.  Frier’s Departure  As financial markets recovered in 2009, Powers explored
selling as much as $1 billion of its private-equity, distressed-
debt and energy funds to take advantage of rising prices. He
canceled the sale in December 2009.  The fund said last year investments rose 14.4 percent in
the year ended June 2010.  The university said in June it lost its chief investment
officer Ken Frier after less than one year on the job. Stanford
named Frier CIO in August 2010, filling a position that was open
for more than two years. Previously, he held the same role at
nearby Hewlett-Packard Co. Frier, a graduate of Stanford
Business School, reported to Powers.  To contact the reporter on this story:
