Russian Finance Minister Alexei Kudrin’s departure from the country’s next government would be
“a body blow,” said Tim Ash, head of emerging-market strategy
at Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc.  “Markets have a huge amount of faith in Kudrin,” who
created a rainy-day  reserve fund  and has been credited for his
“fiscal responsibility,” London-based Ash said today in an e-
mailed note. “His departure would be a body blow for Russia.”  Prime Minister  Vladimir Putin  announced two days ago he
will run again for the presidency next year, while President
 Dmitry Medvedev  said he may take over as prime minister. Kudrin
has criticized Medvedev’s spending plans, including military
expenditure, and said he wouldn’t work in a Medvedev government.
Kudrin should either support his policies or resign, Medvedev
said today.  “Kudrin seems to be appealing to Putin for support,” Ash
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
