Japanese stocks declined, with the
benchmark Nikkei 225 Stock Average dropping to its lowest level
in more than two years, as exporters and trading companies
dropped on concern  Europe  won’t resolve its debt crisis.  Sony Corp. (6758) , which depends on Europe for about a fifth of
its sales, fell 4.1 percent. Mitsubishi Corp.,  Japan ’s biggest
commodities trader by sales, slumped 7.9 percent as copper
futures extended declines. Nippon Electric Glass Co. tumbled 12
percent after the glassmaker cut its profit forecast for the
first half.  The Nikkei 225 dropped 2.2 percent to 8,374.13 at the 3 p.m.
close in Tokyo, its lowest since April 2009, as Japanese share
prices caught up with declines late last week in the U.S. and
Europe. Japanese markets were closed for a holiday on Sept. 23.
The broader Topix index declined 2.1 percent today to 728.85.  “There’s concern that Europe’s debt crisis will spread to
the financial system and we’ll see Lehman Crisis Part II,” said
Takashi Hiroki, chief strategist at Monex Securities in  Tokyo .
“Stocks are falling as concern builds that the global economy
is slowing. A sell-off in shares sensitive to the economy, such
as commodity-related stocks, reflects investors’ fears.”  ‘Catastrophic Risk’  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index fell 1.2 percent
today, erasing gains of as much as 1.3 percent after German
Deputy Finance Minister  Joerg Asmussen  said euro-region finance
ministers won’t be in a position to disburse the next
installment of aid to  Greece  when they meet on Oct. 3.  U.S. Treasury Secretary  Timothy F. Geithner  warned at the
annual meeting of the IMF in  Washington  on Sept. 24 that failure
to combat the Greek-led turmoil threatened “cascading default,
bank runs and catastrophic risk.”  “Uncertainty is controlling the minds of investors,” said
Yoshihisa Okamoto, who helps oversee about $34 billion at Mizuho
Asset Management Co. “There is no specific vision on how to
deal with the likely default of Greece.”  Japanese exporters to Europe tumbled. Sony, the maker of
Bravia televisions and PlayStation game consoles, sank 4.1
percent to 1,423 yen. Nissan Motor Co., which gets about 15
percent of sales from Europe, fell 3.6 percent to 620 yen.  The  Nikkei 225 (NKY)  has fallen 23 percent from its 2011 high on
Feb. 21 as a record earthquake in March, slowing U.S. economic
growth and Europe’s debt crisis threatened the nation’s recovery.
Stocks on the gauge are trading at 13.5 times estimated earnings,
compared with 11.4 times for the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index.  No New Policies  Japanese stocks may continue to fall amid concern the Group
of 20 nations isn’t doing enough to tackle Europe’s debt crisis,
said Manabu Tamaru, senior investment manager at Baring Asset
Management in Tokyo.  G-20 finance chiefs issued an unscheduled communiqué on
Sept. 23 that stopped short of announcing fresh policies while
saying policy makers are “committed” to taking joint action to
address “renewed challenges” to the global economy.  Raw-material suppliers dropped after a gauge of metal
prices in  London  slumped 13 percent last week, the most since
December 2008. Copper futures in London plunged as much as 7.2
percent today, extending declines for a seventh consecutive day.  Mitsubishi Corp. slumped 7.9 percent to 1,565 yen. Mitsui &
Co., which gets about 40 percent from trading energy and metals,
slid 5.9 percent to 1,172 yen.  Tokyo Electric  Nippon Electric tumbled 12 percent to 656 yen. The company
lowered its net-income forecast for the six months through
September to 24 billion yen ($313 million) from a range of 26.5
billion yen to 29.5 billion yen due to weaker demand for flat-
panel displays.  Tokyo Electric Power Co., the utility at the center of the
worst nuclear crisis in 25 years, slumped 13 percent to 259 yen,
the steepest decline on the Nikkei. The utility will have to cut
jobs and carry out other reforms before increasing electricity
rates to raise money to compensate people affected by the
Fukushima disaster, said Takehiko Sugiyama, head of the
government body set up to help disaster victims.  Separately, the Asahi newspaper reported that raising
power rates by 10 percent wouldn’t be enough to cover a short-
fall in capital after paying damages.  To contact the reporters on this story:
