  Canada ’s Natural Resources
Minister Joe Oliver said that  TransCanada Corp. (TRP) ’s proposed $7
billion Keystone XL pipeline is in the country’s “collective
national interest.”  He made the comment in  a statement  from Ottawa today, where
more than 100 people were arrested during a protest against the
project. Keystone would link Alberta’s oilsands to refineries in
the U.S. if the American government approves it, in a decision
due by the end of the year.  Royal Canadian Mounted Police spokesman Sgt. Marc Menard
confirmed the number of arrests in a telephone interview.  To contact the reporters on this story:
