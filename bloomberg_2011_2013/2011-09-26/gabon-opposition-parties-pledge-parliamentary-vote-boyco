Opposition parties in  Gabon  will
not take part in a parliamentary election planned for November
to protest the lack of biometric voting in the central African
nation.  “There will be no elections throughout the Gabonese
territory without biometrics,” Pierre Claver Maganga Moussavou,
leader of the  Social Democratic Party  told reporters in
Libreville, the capital, today. At least seven leaders of other
opposition parties were present at the meeting and agreed to the
boycott.  To contact the reporter on this story:
