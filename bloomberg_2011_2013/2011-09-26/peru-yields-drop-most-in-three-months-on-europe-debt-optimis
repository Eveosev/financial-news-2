Peru’s sol-denominated bonds
gained, pushing down yields the most in three months, amid
speculation European policy makers will step up efforts to
contain the region’s debt crisis.  The yield on the nation’s benchmark 7.84 percent sol-
denominated bond due August 2020 fell 11 basis points, or 0.11
percentage point, to 5.83 percent at 4:56 p.m. New York time,
according to prices compiled by Bloomberg. That’s the steepest
decline in yields since June 8. The bond’s price rose 0.83
centimo to 113.71 centimos per sol.  “We had a massive sell-off in emerging market assets last
week and clearly the mood is much stronger,” said Kathryn Rooney Vera, an emerging markets analyst at Bulltick Capital
Markets in Miami.  The  European Central Bank  is likely to debate restarting
covered-bond purchases along with further measures to ease
monetary conditions, a euro-region central bank official said.  The extra yield investors demand to own Peruvian  government
bonds  instead of U.S. Treasuries fell for a second day,
declining three basis points to 273, according to JPMorgan Chase
& Co.  Investors’ hunt for yield and the Peruvian economy’s
“good” growth prospects will probably boost demand for the
nation’s bonds even as global growth slows, Estefany Castillo,
an analyst at Scotiabank Peru, said in an e-mailed report today.  The sol weakened 0.1 percent to 2.7716 per  U.S. dollar ,
from 2.7690 Sept. 23.  The Peruvian central bank sold dollars in the  spot market 
for a third day to stem declines in the sol. It sold $187
million today and issued 100 million soles ($36 million) of
dollar-linked certificates of deposit.  The central bank stepped up efforts to shore up the sol as
foreigners bought dollars, Gonzalo Navarro, head trader at  Banco
Santander , wrote in an e-mail note to clients.  To contact the reporter on this story:
