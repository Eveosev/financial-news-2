European Central Bank Governing
Council member Ewald Nowotny said European leaders should
consider an expansion of the European Financial Stability
Facility.  “We are just now discussing an extension of this EFSF,”
Nowotny said in a lecture at  Harvard University  in Cambridge,
 Massachusetts  today. While this “might not be a trillion”
euros, “it is clearly something more than it is now and I think
this makes sense.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
