Uganda ’s shilling strengthened the
most in almost eight weeks against the dollar as non-government
organizations received inflows of the greenback.  The currency of East Africa’s third-biggest economy
appreciated as much as 1.5 percent, the most since Aug. 2, and
gained 1.2 percent to 2,840 per dollar at 3:54 p.m. in the
capital, Kampala, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  “It is purely because of some inflows of dollars because
the central bank hasn’t sold dollars today,” Ahmed Kalule, the
head of  currency trading  at Bank of Africa Uganda Ltd., said by
phone from Kampala.  Uganda’s shilling reached 2,897.50 against the dollar on
Sept. 23, the weakest since June 1993, as concern  Europe ’s banks
will face funding problems should  Greece  default on its debt
spurred investors to pull money from emerging and frontier
markets.  The currency has weakened 20 percent this year against the
dollar, making it the second-worst performer after Kenya’s
shilling. A surge in food and fuel prices pushed inflation to a
more than 18-year high of 21.4 percent in August from 18.8
percent in July, the Uganda Bureau of Statistics said on Aug.
