Tiger Woods  hired Joe LaCava as his
new caddie, the golfer said on his website.  LaCava spent 20 years caddying for  Fred Couples  and in June
started working for  Dustin Johnson , who last month won the U.S.
PGA Tour’s first playoff event.  Woods parted ways with former caddie  Steve Williams , with
whom he won 13 of his 14 major championships, in July. LaCava’s
first tournament with Woods will be the Frys.com Open, scheduled
for Oct. 6-9 in San Martin,  California .  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
