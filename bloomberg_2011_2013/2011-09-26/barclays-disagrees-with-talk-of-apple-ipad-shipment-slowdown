Barclays Capital  said it didn’t
agree with market “chatter” that  Apple Inc. (AAPL)  iPad shipments
have been lowered and could be down 25 percent quarter-on-
quarter.  “We believe iPad 2 shipments for the third and fourth
quarters have not been cut,” analysts led by Kirk Yang wrote in
a report dated yesterday, citing checks with component suppliers
and assembler Hon Hai Precision Industry Co. They maintained a
forecast for iPad 2 shipments to increase by 40 percent to 50
percent quarter-on-quarter in the fourth quarter.  “The numbers being circulated Monday might be related to
components and not to actual iPad 2 shipments,” they wrote.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
