PIK Group (PIKK) , the Russian property
developer partly owned by billionaire Suleiman Kerimov, reported
a profit for the first half as rising prices lifted revenue.  Net income was 3.2 billion rubles ($100 million) compared
with a loss of 5.2 billion rubles a year earlier, PIK said in a
statement today. Revenue rose 51 percent to 22.8 billion rubles
as PIK completed homes with total space of 354,000 square meters
(3.8 million square feet), an increase of about 45 percent.  PIK focuses on residential development mainly in the Moscow
region. Average property prices around the Russian capital
gained about 8 percent in the first half compared with the whole
of 2010 as “buying patterns returned to normality,” PIK said.  “ Consumer confidence  is back and individuals are buying
real estate from the early stage of construction,” the Moscow-
based developer said.  Net debt increased to 42.5 billion rubles from 38.9 billion
rubles, PIK said. The company’s gross profit margin was 16
percent in the first half. That compared with a negative figure
a year earlier.  Kerimov’s Nafta Moskva owns about 38 percent of PIK,
according to a  presentation  PIK made to investors in August.  PIK fell as much as 6.5 percent in Moscow trading and was
down 2.8 percent at 95.66 rubles as of 11:37 a.m.  The stock has
declined 22 percent this year, cutting the company’s market
value to 47.1 billion rubles.  To contact the reporter on this story:
