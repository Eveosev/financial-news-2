Europe  will see more mergers and
acquisitions among clothing and houseware retailers as economic
woes weigh on  consumer spending , said Ira Kalish, a research
director at Deloitte LLP.  Retail consolidation will take place more among non-food
retailers because grocery chains are already more consolidated,
Kalish, Deloitte’s director of global consumer research, said in
an interview at the World Retail Congress in Berlin today.  “I foresee recession, the question is how deep,” he said.  Consumers across Europe and the U.S. will become “frugal”
as they look to cut their shopping budgets, the research firm
said. Kalish expects discounters will continue to benefit
alongside upscale and luxury retailers as highly skilled,
educated consumers continue to shop.  “The retailers stuck in the middle will have the trouble -
- the supermarkets, the hypermarkets, the mid-priced department
stores -- it will be more challenging for them,” Kalish said.
They will have to cut costs, compete more on prices, and promote
their brands to help drive market share.  The chance that the U.S. enters recession in the next six
months is “probably” less than 50 percent as a European
slowdown could make economic growth in that market decelerate,
Kalish said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
