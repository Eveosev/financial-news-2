The following companies are having
unusual price changes in Bogota trading. Stock symbols are in
parentheses and prices are as of 12:54 p.m. New York time.  The IGBC Index fell 1.8 percent to 12,740.67 while the
Colcap Index declined 1.4 percent to 1,571.67.  Canacol Energy Ltd. (CNEC)  , the Calgary-based  oil
company  that operates fields in  South America , fell 10 percent
to 1,075 pesos, a record low.  The company plans to begin drilling on the first of three
wells in its contracts in the Caguan-Putumayo basin within three
weeks, according to a statement on its website. The company said
it delayed drilling, originally planned for July, after it
decided to focus on conventional wells, which it can drill
“significantly faster,” instead of stratigraphic wells, aimed
at evaluating subsurface rock formation.  The delays in Caguan-Putumayo came after the company
abandoned an exploratory well in Guyana in April, saying it
wasn’t fit for beginning production.  “Being an exploration company, delays or problems in
exploration campaigns diminish the company’s potential value,”
said Juan David Pineros, analyst at Interbolsa SA, Colombia’s
biggest brokerage.  Coltejer SA (COLTEJ)  , a Colombian clothing maker and
exporter, jumped 5.2 percent to 1.02 peso. Colombia’s central
bank chief Jose Dario Uribe said the recent fall in the peso is
“healthy” after the currency dropped 8.1 percent against the
 U.S. dollar  since July 14.  To contact the reporter on this story:
