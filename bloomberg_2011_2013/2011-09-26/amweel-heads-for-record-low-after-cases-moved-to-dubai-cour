Tamweel PJSC (TAMWEEL)  is poised for its
lowest close on record after Dubaiâ€™s ruler issued a decree to
transfer all cases filed against the mortgage company to the
Dubai Court of First Instance.  The shares declined 3.1 percent to 72.5 fils at 11:35 a.m.
in Dubai and headed for the lowest close since July 2006, when
the company majority owned by  Dubai Islamic Bank PJSC (DIB)  listed its
shares.             All legal cases, applications, complaints and disputes
filed against Tamweel will be moved from a special committee,
the company said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
