Societe Nationale de Chemins de Fer
Francais is unhappy with the performance of its German
subsidiary Keolis, Financial Times Deutschland  reported , citing
an interview with SNCF executive Jean-Pierre Farandou.  Keolis, which runs trains in the states of North Rhine-
Westphalia and Hesse, accounts for less than 1 percent of
 Germany ’s 8 billion-euro ($10.7 billion) regional-railway
market, FT Deutschland reported. Farandou ruled out the French
railway division’s departure from Germany as well as any
acquisitions, saying he expects Keolis to grow by taking over
more train-route franchises, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
