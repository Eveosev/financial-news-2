HTC Corp. (2498) ’s victory in a digital-
imaging patent case brought by FlashPoint Technology Inc. will
be reviewed by the U.S. International Trade Commission.  A full panel of trade commissioners will look deeper into
at least five aspects of the case including enforceability of
the patents, according to a  notice  today on the Washington-based
agency’s website. An ITC judge ruled in July that FlashPoint, a
closely held licensing company, failed to show HTC violated its
 patent rights  for imaging devices used in mobile phones.  HTC, Asia’s second-biggest maker of smartphones, may now
need to show it didn’t violate one of the two FlashPoint patents
that were remaining in the case. The dispute between FlashPoint
and Taoyuan, Taiwan-based HTC centered on technology related to
the way digital cameras operate, including focus and flash
settings, and automatic rotation of the image depending on how
the camera is held, according to the complaint.  LG Electronics Inc. (066570) ,  Nokia Oyj (NOK1V)  and  Research In Motion Ltd. (RIM) ,
which had also been targeted in the case, settled with
Peterborough, New Hampshire-based FlashPoint before the ITC
could rule.  The ITC is a quasi-judicial federal agency that arbitrates
trade disputes and has the power to block imports of products
that infringe U.S. patents.  The case is In the Matter of Certain Electronic Imaging
Devices, Complaint 337-726, U.S. International Trade Commission
(Washington).  To contact the reporter on this story:
