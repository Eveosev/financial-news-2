The  Philippines  ordered the
evacuation of over 100,000 people, cancelled flights and
suspended classes as it braces for Typhoon Nesat.  The storm, locally known as Pedring, was 350 kilometers
southeast of Aurora, a province east of the capital, at 10 a.m.
local time today, with maximum winds of 120 kilometers per hour
and gusts of up to 150 kilometers per hour, the Philippine
Atmospheric, Geophysical & Astronomical Services Administration
said on its website today. Rainfall may be as much as 25
millimeters per hour within the typhoon’s 650-kilometer
diameter.  About 111,000 people in “flood-prone” areas in Albay
province were ordered evacuated, the disaster risk agency said
on its website today.  Government suspended classes starting noon. About 34 local
flights were cancelled due to the storm, ABS-CBN News reported
on its website.  The Philippines is battered by about 20 tropical cyclones
yearly. In September 2009, Tropical Storm Ketsana submerged most
of  Manila  after dropping 41 centimeters of rain in six hours,
killing more than 400 people.  To contact the reporter on this story:
