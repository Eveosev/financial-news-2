U.K. gold mining stocks, including
 African Barrick Gold Ltd. (ABG)  and  Highland Gold Mining Ltd. (HGM) , fell in
London trading as gold tumbled to its lowest price since July.  African Barrick dropped as much as 41.5 pence, or 7.3
percent, to 528 pence at 11 a.m., the most since June 8 while
Highland Gold Mining Ltd. slumped 8.75 pence, or 5 percent, to
168.25 pence.  Gold prices approached the biggest two-day slump in a month
after the price of the precious metal tumbled to below $1,600 an
ounce. Commodities fell on speculation European governments will
struggle to contain the region’s debt crisis that has pushed
 Greece  to the brink of default.  “The trend will be sideways to downwards in the next few
weeks, it is no longer up,”  Axel Rudolph , London-based
technical analyst at Commerzbank AG, said by phone today. While
the metal may “bounce back” to around $1,700 to $1,720 in the
next few days, it will drop to its May low of $1,472 an ounce
over the next few weeks, he said.  The slump is “a major correction,” said Rudolph. “It is
not the end of the bull run for the next year.”  To contact the reporter for this story:
