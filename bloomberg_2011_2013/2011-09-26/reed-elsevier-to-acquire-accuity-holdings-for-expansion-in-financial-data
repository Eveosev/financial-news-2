Reed Elsevier Plc (REL) , the owner of the
LexisNexis database, agreed to buy Accuity Holdings Inc. from
Investcorp for 343 million pounds ($530 million) in cash.  Accuity, a U.S. provider of online data for the financial-
services industry, is “highly complementary” with  Reed
Elsevier ’s Bankers’ Almanac and LexisNexis Risk Solutions, the
London-based company said in a statement today.  Reed Elsevier said in July that first-half revenue fell 3
percent on currency swings and asset sales. The company last
year sold off parts of its Reed Business Information trade-
magazine unit, including all U.S. publishing operations except
the Variety title. At the same time, the company has increased
investment in product development and sales and marketing to tap
growth in electronic data offerings.  Accuity will be integrated into Bankers’ Almanac and share
combined data assets with LexisNexis Risk Solutions. The
acquisition will boost Reed Elsevier’s adjusted earnings from
the outset and is expected to close in the fourth quarter,
according to the company.  “This move seems to take Reed further away from front
office business and into a more crowded, less proprietary field
in direct competition with software/process companies,” Giasone Salati, a London-based analyst at Espirito Santo Investment
Bank, said in a note.  To contact the reporter on this story:
