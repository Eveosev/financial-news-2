The rate at which London-based
banks say they can borrow for three months in dollars increased
for a 12th day, reaching the highest level since August 2010.  The  London  interbank offered rate, or Libor, for dollar
loans rose to 0.36278 percent from 0.36022 percent last week,
according to data from the British Bankers’ Association. That’s
the highest rate since Aug. 13, 2010.  The dollar Libor-OIS spread, a gauge of banks’ reluctance
to lend, was at 27.58 basis points at 11:58 a.m. in London, from
27.12 on Sept. 23. The spread reached 28.95 basis points on
Sept. 19, the widest on a closing-price basis since July 27,
2010, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The TED spread, or the difference between what lenders and
the U.S. government pay to borrow for three months, widened to
36.79 basis points from 36.53 basis points on Sept. 23. That’s
the most since July 19, 2010, Bloomberg data show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
