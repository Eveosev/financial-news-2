Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) , sued by
defunct  Thornburg Mortgage Inc. (THMRQ) , asked a bankruptcy judge to put
the lawsuit on hold while a district judge decides whether
to take the case. Bankrupt TMST Inc.’s contract claims should be
dismissed because Goldman Sachs was exercising its rights after
an “incontrovertible margin default,” the New York-based bank
said in a Sept. 23 court filing.  TMST trustee Joel Sher filed at least eight lawsuits from
April 28 to April 30, seeking  more than $2 billion from
JPMorgan Chase & Co., Citigroup Inc., Barclays Plc, Bank of
America Corp. and other companies, alleging that they made
unjustified margin calls that helped to cause Thornburg’s
downfall.  To contact the reporter on this story:
