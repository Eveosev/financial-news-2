Japanese and Australian stock
futures gained on expectations European leaders will act to
prevent the region’s sovereign-debt crisis from getting worse.  American depositary receipts of  Sumitomo Mitsui Financial
Group Inc. (8316) , Japan’s No. 2 bank by market value, advanced 1.2
percent from the closing share price in Tokyo after the  European
Central Bank  was said to consider restarting covered-bond
purchases along with further measures to ease monetary
conditions. Those of  Canon Inc. (7751) , which depends on Europe for
about a third of its sales, climbed 1.3 percent. ADRs of  BHP
Billiton Ltd. (BHP) , Australia’s No. 1 oil producer, jumped 3.6
percent after crude prices advanced.  “Speculation that Europe may take additional monetary
easing measures will likely boost shares” said  Fumiyuki Nakanishi , a strategist at Tokyo-based SMBC Friend Securities Co.
“A rebound in stocks will be limited as U.S. employment and
other significant economic reports are scheduled to be released
next week.”  Futures on Japan’s  Nikkei 225 (NKY)  Stock Average expiring in
December closed at 8,465 in Chicago yesterday, compared with
8,290 in Osaka, Japan. They were bid in the pre-market at 8,450
in Osaka at 8:05 a.m. local time. Futures on Australia’s S&P/ASX
200 Index gained 2.7 percent today. New Zealand’s NZX 50 Index
rose 0.8 percent in Wellington.  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index fell 0.1 percent
today. In  New York , the index climbed 2.3 percent yesterday,
with all 10 groups in the gauge advancing, after a euro-region
central bank official said ECB policy makers are likely to
debate next week suggest resuming buying bonds from banks that
are backed by loans as collateral.  Interest Rates  The reintroduction of 12-month loans to banks will also be
discussed at the ECB’s Oct. 6 policy meeting, said the person,
who spoke on condition of anonymity because the information is
confidential. Interest-rate cuts are likely to be discussed,
though they are not on the agenda, the official said. A
spokesman for the Frankfurt-based ECB declined to comment.  The euro gained to as much as 103.45 yen today in  Tokyo ,
compared with 102.18 at the close of  stock trading  yesterday. A
stronger euro boosts the value of European income at Japanese
companies when converted into their home currency.  The  S&P 500  fell earlier yesterday as figures from the
Commerce Department showed that purchases of new houses in the
U.S. declined in August to a six-month low as the biggest drop
in prices in two years failed to lure buyers away from even less
expensive distressed properties.  Crude oil for November delivery rose 39 cents to settle at
$80.24 a barrel yesterday in New York, the first increase in
four sessions. Copper futures for December delivery yesterday
advanced for the first time in three sessions.  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index declined 21 percent this year
through Sept. 23, compared with a 7.5 percent drop by the S&P
500 and a 20 percent loss by the Stoxx  Europe  600 Index. Stocks
in the Asian benchmark were valued at 11.1 times estimated
earnings on average, compared with 11.7 times for the S&P 500
and 9.2 times for the Stoxx 600.  To contact the reporters on this story:
