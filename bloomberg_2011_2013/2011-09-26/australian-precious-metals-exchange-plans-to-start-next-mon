An Australian-based exchange for
precious metals is set to start operations next month and aims
to allow buyers and sellers to trade online as well as offering
storage in its Brisbane vault.  The  Australian Bullion Exchange , scheduled to open on Oct.
24, will cater for trade in investment-grade gold, silver and
platinum, Chief Executive Officer Thomas Coughlin said in an
interview. The privately held exchange is targeting institutions
as well as smaller investors, Coughlin said.  Gold futures advanced 1.4 percent to $1,663.10 an ounce in
 New York  today after plunging 9.3 percent in the previous two
days, the biggest such drop since 1983, as commodities fell to a
nine-month low on concern that governments were running out of
tools to avert a global recession, eroding the demand outlook.
Futures reached a record $1,923.70 on Sept. 6.  “It’s a principal-to-principal market that will connect
the bullion industry with the finance industry,” Coughlin said.
The service will allow trading only through a phone link
initially, with the online service to begin later, he said.  The start date was previously set for Oct. 4.  To contact the reporter on this story:
