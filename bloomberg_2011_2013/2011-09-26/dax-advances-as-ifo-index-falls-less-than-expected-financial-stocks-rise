German stocks advanced as German
business confidence fell less than expected in September. The
Ifo institute in Munich said its business climate index, based
on a survey of 7,000 executives, dropped for a third straight
month to 107.5 from 108.7 in August, less than a median forecast
of a drop to 106.5.  The benchmark DAX Index rose 1.3 percent to 5,262.75 as of
10:03 a.m. in  Frankfurt , reversing earlier declines of as much
1.5 percent.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
