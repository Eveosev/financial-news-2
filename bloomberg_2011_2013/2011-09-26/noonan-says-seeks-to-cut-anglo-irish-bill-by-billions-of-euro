Ireland’s Finance Minister  Michael
Noonan  said he is seeking to cut billions of euros off the
country’s bill for bailing out Anglo Irish Bank Corp. by
restructuring promissory notes used to recapitalize the lender.  “The next piece of renegotiation that has to be done is to
use all our persuasive powers and ingenuity to get the burden of
the debt down,” Noonan said in an interview aired by Dublin-
based broadcaster RTE Radio today. He said it would be
“imprudent” to impose losses on senior Anglo Irish
bondholders, as attempts at private sector involvement in  Greece 
led to contagion elsewhere.   Ireland has used 31 billion euros of promissory notes to
recapitalize Anglo Irish and smaller Irish  Nationwide Building
Society . The notes are currently scheduled to be paid down by
the end of 2025.  To contact the reporter on this story:
