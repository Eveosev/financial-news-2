Turkey ’s  Sabah newspaper  printed
the names and pictures of 148 Israeli soldiers it said were
involved in the killing of nine Turks aboard the Mavi Marmara
aid ship last year.  Turkish intelligence officers learned the names of 174
soldiers involved in the raid through Israeli sources and used
social networks including Facebook to help identify 148 of them
by photograph, Sabah said. It printed the names and photos today
under a headline reading: “This is the diagram of the team that
killed nine Turks.”  Turkish prosecutors began a “social media commando hunt”
after their requests for information on the soldiers involved in
the May 2010 raid weren’t answered by Israeli authorities, Sabah
said. The names and other identifying information of the
soldiers involved have been sent to lead prosecutor Mehmet Akif
Ekinci, Sabah said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
