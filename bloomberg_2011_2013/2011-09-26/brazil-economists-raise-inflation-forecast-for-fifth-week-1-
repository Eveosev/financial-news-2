Brazil ’s central bank will miss its
inflation target this year for the first time since 2003, a
central bank survey of economists shows.  Consumer prices will rise 6.52 percent this year, according
to the median forecast in a Sept. 23  central bank survey  of
about 100 analysts published today, as record low unemployment
and a weaker currency fuel consumer price increases.  The forecast was up from 6.46 percent the previous week.
The central bank targets inflation of 4.5 percent, plus or minus
two percentage points, and year-end inflation has remained
within the target range for the past seven years.  “The report shows that the market expects the weaker
currency to contribute to inflation, although not enough to
change the central bank’s focus,” said  Luciano Rostagno , head
strategist of CM Capital Markets, in a telephone interview from
 Sao Paulo . “The central bank has signaled that it will keep
promoting a policy of cutting rates.”  Central bank President Alexandre Tombini cut Brazil’s
benchmark interest rate a half point to 12 percent on Aug. 31,
after raising it at the previous five policy meetings, citing a
“substantial deterioration” in the global economy. The bank
said lower borrowing costs won’t compromise its 4.5 percent
inflation target next year. Annual inflation in mid-September
was 7.33 percent, the fastest rate in six years.  Falling Yields  Yields on the interest-rate futures contract maturing in
January 2013, the most traded in Sao Paulo today, fell 12 basis
points, or 0.12 percentage point, to 10.34 percent at 9:38 a.m.
New York time. The real weakened 0.5 percent to 1.8436 per
dollar from 1.8339 Sept. 23.  The real has fallen 14 percent this month against the
dollar as investors shun emerging market assets on concern
 Europe ’s debt crisis will hurt the global economy. A weakening
currency could increase the cost of imported  consumer goods ,
Rostagno said.  Economists held estimates for the benchmark Selic at 11
percent for the end of this year and 10.75 percent for year-end
2012, the survey showed.  For the next 12 months consumer prices as measured by the
IPCA index will rise 5.76 percent, from a previous estimate of
5.71 percent, according to the survey. The forecast rose for the
fifth straight week. Prices will rise 5.52 percent in 2012, the
survey showed, up from the previous week’s forecast of 5.50
percent.  The economists reduced their estimate for this year’s
economic growth to 3.51 percent from 3.52 percent a week earlier
and held their 2012 growth forecast at 3.7 percent.  Brazil’s unemployment rate was unchanged at 6 percent in
August, a record low for the month, the national statistics
agency said on Sept. 22. Average real wages rose 0.5 percent
from the previous months to 1,629.40 reais ($839.16) a month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
