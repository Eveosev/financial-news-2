3M Co. (MMM)  slashed borrowing costs by
more than half on its first corporate bond sale since October
2008 as the maker of Post-It notes and Scotch tape seeks to pay
back $800 million of debt due in November.  The company issued $1 billion of 1.375 percent, five-year
notes at 99.16 cents on the dollar to yield 65 basis points more
than similar-maturity Treasuries, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. In October 2008,  St. Paul , Minnesota-based 3M raised
$800 million of 4.5 percent debt due November 2011 as credit
markets seized.  3M, graded Aa2 by Moody’s Investors Service and AA- by
 Standard & Poor’s , is marketing bonds as yields on five-year
Treasuries hover at about 0.9 percent after tumbling to the
lowest on record last week. Investors are seeking the relative
safety of higher-rated industrial corporate bonds as  Europe ’s
debt crisis worsens and the  unemployment rate  in the U.S. holds
above 9 percent.  3M “is covering so many different marketplaces, that from
a risk averse standpoint, they’re a pretty safe company,” said
 William Larkin , a fixed-income  money manager  who helps oversee
$500 million at Cabot Money Management Inc. in Salem,
 Massachusetts .  Proceeds will be used for general corporate purposes,
including the repayment of bonds maturing in November, said a
person with knowledge of the transaction, who declined to be
identified citing lack of authorization to speak publicly.  Different Markets  Borrowing costs for AA rated companies have declined from
7.75 percent on average at the end of October 2008 to 3.08
percent on Sept. 23, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch
index data.  The coupon on 3M’s bond is the third-lowest this year of
that maturity after August issues by the U.K. train-track
operator Network Rail Infrastructure Finance Plc and theme-park
operator Walt Disney Co., Bloomberg data show. Network Rail sold
1.25 percent notes, while Disney offered 1.35 percent debt.  3M had $4.48 billion of long-term debt on June 30 and $3.38
billion of cash and cash equivalents, according to its most
recent quarterly filing.  “In addition to demand for high-quality paper, MMM
scarcity value is also playing a role in the demand,”  Adrian Miller , a New York-based fixed-income strategist at Miller Tabak
Roberts Securities LLC, said in an e-mail, using 3M’s ticker
symbol.  In October 2008, 3M’s senior unsecured bonds priced at
99.83 cents on the dollar to yield 275 basis points more than
similar-maturity Treasuries, Bloomberg data show.  Citigroup Inc., Deutsche Bank AG, Goldman Sachs Group Inc.
and Morgan Stanley led today’s bond sale, Bloomberg data show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
