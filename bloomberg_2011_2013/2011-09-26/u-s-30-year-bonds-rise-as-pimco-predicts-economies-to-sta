Treasuries dropped, pushing 10-year
note yields up from almost record lows, as stocks gained after
finance chiefs including Treasury Secretary  Timothy F. Geithner 
urged Europeans to step up efforts to contain the debt crisis.  Yields on 30-year bonds rose after tumbling last week the
most in almost three years as the  Federal Reserve  said it would
purchase longer-term debt and sell shorter maturities to support
the economy by keeping borrowing costs low. The Treasury
Department is auctioning $99 billion of notes this week.  “Investors are taking more risk today, selling Treasuries
as some of the ebb and flow of news out of the  euro zone  has
been more constructive,” said  Christopher Sullivan , who
oversees $1.7 billion as chief investment officer at United
Nations Federal Credit Union in New York. “We’ve rallied so
strong that we will be hard pressed to move much lower in rates
unless another shoe drops in Europe.”  Yields on 10-year notes increased seven basis points, or
0.07 percentage point, to 1.90 percent at 5:10 p.m. in  New York ,
according to Bloomberg Bond Trader prices. The 2.125 percent
securities maturing in August 2021 slid 19/32, or $5.94 per
$1,000 face amount, to 102. Yields fell on Sept. 23 to 1.6714
percent, the lowest in Fed data beginning in 1953.  A drop of two points in 30-year bonds pushed yields up nine
basis points to 2.99 percent after falling 41 basis points last
week, the most since the depths of the financial crisis in
December 2008. Yields on five-year notes advanced three basis
points to 0.90 percent.  Yield Curve  The extra yield investors get to hold 30-year bonds instead
of five-year notes increased to 2.09 percentage points after
dropping on Sept. 22 to 2.02 percentage points, the narrowest on
a closing basis since January 2010. The average is 2.51
percentage points this year and 1.60 percentage points over the
past five years.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index rallied 2.3 percent after
dropping 6.5 percent last week. The Stoxx Europe 600 Index added
1.9 percent. Crude oil for November delivery gained 2 percent to
$81.47 a barrel in New York.  Treasuries due in 10 or more years have returned 28 percent
in 2011, exceeding the 24.4 percent gain in all of 2008,
according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch indexes. Not since
1995, when the securities soared 30.7 percent, have investors
done so well owning longer-dated  U.S. government debt .  “Given the run-up we had, there should be some type of
correction and consolidation on the back end,” said James Combias, head of Treasury trading in New York at Mizuho
Securities USA Inc., one of 20 primary dealers that trade with
the U.S. central bank.  Bond Returns  Treasuries have returned 6.8 percent this quarter, the most
since 8.9 percent growth in the fourth quarter of 2008. U.S.
debt securities have gained 2.1 percent this month after a 2.8
percent increase in August, the most since a 3.5 percent gain in
December 2008.  The 10-year note yields may fall as low as 1.35 percent by
year-end, and 30-year bond yields may drop to 2.35 percent,
Deutsche Bank AG analysts including Dominic Konstam in New York
wrote Sept. 23 in a research note.  The Treasury Department will sell $35 billion in two-year
notes tomorrow, an equal amount in five-year debt the next day
and $29 billion in seven-year securities Sept. 29.  Geithner called on governments over the weekend at the
annual meeting of the  International Monetary Fund  to unite with
the  European Central Bank  to beef up the capacity of their 440
billion-euro ($591 billion) bailout fund.  ECB Outlook  ECB policy makers are likely to debate next week restarting
their covered-bond purchases along with further measures to ease
monetary conditions, a euro-region central bank official said.  The reintroduction of 12-month loans to banks will be
discussed at the central bank’s Oct. 6 policy meeting, said the
official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because the
information is confidential. Interest-rate cuts are likely to be
discussed, though they are not on the current agenda, according
to the official.  “People keep hoping and wanting some sort of plan, but the
longer they drag their feet, the better chance the flight-to-
quality trade will get going again,” said Jason Rogan, director
of U.S. government trading in New York at Guggenheim Partners
LLC, a brokerage for institutional investors. “Long-term, you
still want to buy the dips from 1.90 to 2 percent on 10s,
assuming nothing new comes out of  Europe .”  Fed Debt Buying  The Fed said last week that it will buy $400 billion of
bonds with maturities of six to 30 years through June, while
selling an equal amount of debt maturing in three years or less
to aid growth. The central bank will also reinvest maturing
mortgage debt into mortgage-backed securities instead of
Treasuries in an attempt to spur housing and refinancing.  The central bank will buy  Treasury securities  13 times per
month and sell its holdings of U.S. government debt six times
under its plan to lower borrowing costs known as Operation
Twist, according to a statement today from the New York Fed.  The Fed will sell $8 billion to $9 billion of nominal
Treasuries five times a month per operation and $1 billion to
$1.5 billion of Treasury Inflation Protected Securities, or
TIPS, in one operation. The Fed will buy Treasuries 12 times a
month and TIPS once a month.  To contact the reporters on this story:
