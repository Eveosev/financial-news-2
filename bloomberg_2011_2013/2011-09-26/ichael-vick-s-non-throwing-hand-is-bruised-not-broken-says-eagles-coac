Philadelphia Eagles quarterback
Michael Vick’s non-throwing hand is bruised, not broken as was
diagnosed yesterday when he injured it, coach  Andy Reid  said.  Vick, who throws left-handed, is bothered by swelling in
the hand, and getting that reduced will dictate when he will be
able to play, the coach said during a televised news conference.  Reid said a blood vessel over a bone was mistaken for a
crack.  The  New York Giants  beat the Eagles in Philadelphia 29-16.  To contact the reporter on this story:
