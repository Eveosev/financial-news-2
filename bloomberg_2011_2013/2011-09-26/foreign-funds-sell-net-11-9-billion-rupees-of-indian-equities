Overseas investors sold a net 11.9
billion rupees ($239.5 million) of Indian equities on Sept. 23,
reducing their investment in equities this year to 3.75 billion
rupees, the nation’s market regulator said.  Foreigners bought 16.5 billion rupees of shares and sold
28.4 billion rupees, the  Securities and Exchange Board of India 
said  today . They bought a net 620 million rupees of bonds,
taking total flows into debt this year to 177 billion rupees.  The BSE India Sensitive Index has dropped 21.7 percent this
year, the most in  Asia  after  Hong Kong ’s  Hang Seng Index (HSI)  and
Taiwan’s Taiex Index, on concern a slowdown in the U.S. and
 Europe ’s debt crisis may erode company profits already
threatened by the most aggressive interest-rate increases among
major Asian economies.  Overseas funds withdrew a net $2.4 billion from Indian
stocks in August, the most since October 2008, according to data
from the nation’s regulator. That caused the Sensex to decline
8.4 percent last month, making the gauge’s worst August in at
least a decade, according to Bloomberg data.  India ’s $1.3 trillion stock market, Asia’s fourth-biggest,
is influenced by foreign fund flows. Inflows from abroad surged
to a record $29.4 billion in 2010, making the Sensex the best
performer among the world’s top 10 markets. The largest-ever
outflow in 2008 led the biggest annual slump of 52 percent.  Foreign funds have placed 4.475 trillion rupees in stocks
and 963.7 billion rupees in bonds since they were allowed into
the country in 1993.  The regulator provides data on shares bought and sold by
large investors, including trades in the primary and secondary
markets, with a delay of at least a day.  To contact the reporter on this story:
