Ethanol futures advanced the most
in three weeks in  Chicago  amid optimism that  Europe  may escape
its debt crisis.  Futures gained 1.2 percent after a euro-region central bank
official, who declined to be identified because the information
is confidential, said policy makers next week will probably
consider resuming covered-bond purchases.  “There’s a spillover effect,” said  Dan Flynn , a trader at
PFG Best in Chicago. “The market’s reading the news from
Europe. Everything is tailor-made for a move to the upside.”  Denatured ethanol for October delivery climbed 2.9 cents to
$2.549 a gallon on the Chicago Board of Trade, the largest gain
since Sept. 2. Futures are headed for the first monthly drop
since June and the largest since October 2008. Prices are little
changed this quarter.  In cash market trading, ethanol in the U.S. Gulf was
unchanged at $2.575 a gallon, and in  New York  the biofuel added
2.5 cents, or 0.9 percent, to $2.675, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg.  Ethanol on the West Coast increased 2 cents, or 0.7
percent, to $2.75 a gallon, and in Chicago the additive rose 1
cent, or 0.4 percent, to $2.565.  To contact the reporter on this story:
