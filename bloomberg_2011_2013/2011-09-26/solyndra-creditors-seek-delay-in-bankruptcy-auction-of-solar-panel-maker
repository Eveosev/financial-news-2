Low-ranking creditors of Solyndra
LLC asked a judge to delay an auction for the bankrupt solar-
panel maker, claiming a quick sale may push down the price.  A committee representing unsecured creditors owed about
$40 million asked U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Mary Walrath to delay
the deadline by at least four weeks, to the end of November, for
potential buyers to submit bids to buy the company.  “Without sufficient opportunity to complete due diligence,
a prospective buyer is likely to undervalue the assets,” the
committee said in court papers filed Sept. 23 in Wilmington,
 Delaware . The committee blamed a rush to sell the company on
“forces outside the Chapter 11 process.”  The company is under investigation by Republicans in
Congress, who have criticized the $535 million federal loan
guarantee that helped pay for the nine-month-old factory, which
opened in January.  After the company fired about 1,100 workers on Aug. 31 and
filed for bankruptcy, the  Federal Bureau of Investigation 
searched its Fremont, California, headquarters.  The case is In re Solyndra LLC 11-12799,  U.S. Bankruptcy
Court , District of Delaware (Wilmington).  To contact the reporter on this story:
