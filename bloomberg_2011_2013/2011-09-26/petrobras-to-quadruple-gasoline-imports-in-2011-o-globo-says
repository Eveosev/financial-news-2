State-controlled  Petroleo
Brasileiro SA (PETR4)  will quadruple gasoline imports this year to
30,000 barrels a day, the  O Globo  newspaper reported on its
website, citing Petrobras refining head Paulo Roberto Costa.  A rise in overall fuel demand in  Brazil  increased gasoline
consumption by 10 percent this year, O Globo said. Imports are
rising from an average of 7,000 barrels a day last year, Costa
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
