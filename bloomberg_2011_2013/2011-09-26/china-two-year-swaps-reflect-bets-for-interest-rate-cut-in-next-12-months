China ’s interest-rate swaps fell
the most in four months and, for the first time since May 2009,
reflect expectations borrowing costs will be cut within a year.  Two-year contracts, which exchange the central bank’s one-
year deposit rate for a fixed payment, dropped seven basis
points to 3.47 percent as of 9:44 a.m. in  Shanghai , the biggest
drop since May 17, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. A
rate of 3.50 percent would reflect bets for no change in the
official savings rate in the coming year, while a 3.625 percent
level would indicate one increase of 25 basis points.  Central bank Governor Zhou Xiaochuan said economic growth
momentum “remains relatively strong, but faces challenges such
as relatively fast rises in consumer prices and relatively large
amount of capital inflows in the short term,’’ according to a
statement posted on the central bank’s website yesterday.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
