Kazakhstan may send as much as 1.5
million metric tons of crude a year to refineries in  China  under
so-called tolling arrangements, Novosti-Kazakhstan  said , citing
Oil and Gas Minister Sauat Mynbayev.  Kazakhstan is in talks with China about processing the
crude in Chinese refineries to reduce its dependence on gasoline
supplies from  Russia , the Astana-based  news agency  cited
Mynbayev as saying today. That will help the Caspian country to
combat rising fuel prices, Novosti-Kazakhstan said.  In a tolling arrangement a company provides the feedstock
and collects the finished product, paying a fee for processing.  To contact the reporter on this story:
