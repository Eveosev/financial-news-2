Vietnam ’s year-end inflation will
likely be 19 percent or 20 percent, Vo Tri Thanh, deputy head of
Central Institute for Economic Management said in an interview
in Hanoi today.  “It depends on whether the SBV will be determined to
continue to fight against inflation,” said Thanh, referring to
the country’s central bank. “I see some signs the government is
reluctant to continue to tighten.”  Thanh, who said his figures are “quite realistic”, spoke
while at an International Monetary Fund seminar hosted by CIEM.  Vietnam is aiming to contain 2011 year-end inflation to
about 18 percent, according to a statement posted on the
government website Sept. 1.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
