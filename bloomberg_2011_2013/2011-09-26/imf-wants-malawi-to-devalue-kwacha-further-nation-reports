The International Monetary Fund
wants Malawi to further devalue the kwacha before resuming the
countryâ€™s Extended Credit Facility, the Nation reported, citing
IMF Mission Chief to Malawi Janet Stotsky.  Malawi, which devalued its currency by 10 percent a month
ago, should also deal with its balance of payments shortfall,
the Blantyre-based newspaper said, citing Stotsky.  To contact the reporter on this story:
