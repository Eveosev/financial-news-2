The shekel extended declines after
 Israel ’s central bank lowered the benchmark  interest rate  for
the first time in more than two years to shore up growth after
inflation slowed.  The shekel was down 0.9 percent to 3.7363 per dollar at
5:37 p.m. in Tel Aviv after policy makers reduced the rate to 3
percent from 3.25 percent. Israel’s two-year interest rate
swaps, an indicator of investor expectations for the benchmark
in the next two years, dropped 16 basis points to 2.76 percent,
the lowest level since September 2010.  Investors were betting that the  Bank of Israel  would cut
interest rates as early as today “as prices are expected to
come down on the back of a slowdown in the global economy,”
Ehud Itzhakov, a bond trader at Bank Hapoalim Ltd. in  Tel Aviv ,
said by telephone prior to the announcement.  Fischer said Sept. 18 that he is concerned about the
possible effects of a global slump on Israeli exports. The Bank
of Israel cut its growth forecast for next year last week to 3.2
percent from 3.9 percent, citing expectations for slower export
growth. The IMF forecast for Israel is for economic growth of
3.6 percent in 2011.  A Bloomberg survey showed 20 of 22 economists forecast the
central bank, led by Governor  Stanley Fischer , would likely hold
the benchmark lending rate. Two predicted a quarter-point cut.  Annual inflation slowed to 3.4 percent in August from a
high this year of 4.3 percent in March. The government’s annual
target range is 1 percent to 3 percent. Economists’ 12-month
inflation expectations declined to 2.3 percent in September, the
lowest since February 2010.  Monthly Inflation  Consumer prices advanced in August 0.5 percent from the
previous month as housing costs rose 1.3 percent, the largest
monthly increase since February, the  Central Bureau of
Statistics  said Sept. 15.  The two-year breakeven rate, which reflects market
expectations for inflation over the period, declined eight basis
points, or 0.08 percentage point, to 180, the lowest in a week.
That implies an average annual inflation rate of about 1.80
percent over the period. The yield on the CPI-linked bond due
June 2013 dropped five basis points to 1.15 percent at the 4:30
p.m. close.  The country’s Purchasing Managers Index declined to 48.4 in
August from 49.4 in the previous month, Bank Hapoalim Ltd. said
in a report today. The  unemployment rate  was 5.4 percent in
July, the same as in the previous month, the Central Bureau of
Statistics said in an e-mailed statement today.  Economic Growth  The economy will probably grow 5 percent this year, led by
investment in fixed capital including housing, the official
statistics office said today.  Finance Minister Yuval Steinitz said in a Sept. 20
interview in  New York  that the shekel’s drop this year is
sufficient to benefit the economy and the government doesn’t
plan to push for further weakening. The currency accelerated
declines after the comments to 5.4 percent against the dollar
this year from 4.3 percent amid growing concern that the global
economy is headed for a recession.  Steinitz said further declines in the currency could affect
inflation. “If it’s too weak, then the cost of living is going
up, the imported commodities will be more expensive.”  The shekel is the fifth-worst performer among the 10 most-
active  Europe , Middle East and Africa currencies this year,
according to Bloomberg data.  ‘Rate Differential’  “Foreign investors are slowly moving out of shekel
positions as the rate differential with the U.S. may not widen
and is expected to narrow in coming months,” Eytan Admoni, head
of the international department at Bank of Jerusalem Ltd., said
by telephone.  The yield on the Mimshal Shiklit bond due January 2020 fell
three basis points to 4.51 percent, the lowest since Sept. 11.
The rate on the 5.5 percent bond maturing in January 2022
dropped four basis points to 4.69 percent. The Tel Aviv Bond 40
Index, which measures inflation-linked and fixed-rate corporate
bonds, gained for a second day, increasing 0.6 percent.  The  Finance Ministry  raised 1.45 billion shekels ($389
million) at debt auctions today. The sale included 250 million
shekels of 5.5 percent bonds due in January 2022 at an average
price of 108.94. That compares to a closing market price of
109.18.  “The auction closed slightly below market levels as prices
were already high on increased investor bets borrowing costs
could come down today,” Hapoalim’s Itzhakov said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
