South Korea ’s won fell on concern
Europe may fail to contain its debt crisis and as traders said
authorities scaled back intervention that slowed declines last
week. Bonds dropped.  The won sank to near a one-year low, slumping 2.1 percent
to 1,192.85 per dollar at 3 p.m. in Seoul, after losing 4.7
percent last week, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The
currency gained 1.1 percent in the final minutes of trading on
Sept. 23 after the  finance ministry  and central bank said they
were ready to intervene. It touched 1,196.13 that day, the
weakest level since September 2010.  “There were several factors that dragged the won down
today, including Europe’s ongoing crisis, the Kospi’s decline,
and exporters’ refraining from selling dollars on speculation
the won will weaken further,” said Lee Jung Ha, a senior
currency dealer at  Korea Development Bank  in Seoul. “Signs of
government intervention were not so obvious today.”  The  Kospi Index (KOSPI)  of local shares fell 2.6 percent as
overseas investors sold $215 million more of the nation’s stocks
than they bought today, taking net sales this month to more than
$2 billion.  German Deputy Finance Minister  Joerg Asmussen  said a
decision on the disbursement of the next tranche of aid to
Greece won’t be made when euro-region finance ministers meet on
Oct. 3. Mohamed El-Erian, chief executive officer of Pacific
Investment Management Co., forecast in an interview on Sept. 24
there will be little to no economic growth in industrial nations
in the coming 12 months as Europe’s economy shrinks and the U.S.
stagnates.  South Korea’s five-year bonds declined. The yield on the
3.5 percent debt due September 2016 rose four basis points, or
0.04 percentage point, to 3.58 percent, Korea Exchange Inc.
prices show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
