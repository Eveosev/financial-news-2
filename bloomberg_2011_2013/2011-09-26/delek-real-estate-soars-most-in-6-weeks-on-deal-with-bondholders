Delek Real Estate Ltd. (DLKR)  surged the
most in six weeks after controlling shareholder Isaac Tshuva
reached a memorandum of understanding with holders of the
companyâ€™s Series Dalet, Heh and Kaf-Heh bonds.  The shares of the property company soared 20 percent, the
most since Aug. 14, to 0.165 shekel at the 4:30 p.m. close in
Tel Aviv, paring the decline this year to 88 percent. The Ramat
Gan, Israel-based company has a market value of 64 million
shekels ($17 million).  Tshuva will make a one-time payment of 13 million shekels
to Kaf-Heh bondholders in exchange for an agreement to delay
principal payments until Jan. 31. He also will make an offer in
July to buy all bonds outstanding.  To contact the reporter on this story:
