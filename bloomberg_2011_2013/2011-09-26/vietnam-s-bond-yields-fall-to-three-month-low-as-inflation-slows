Vietnam ’s five-year bonds gained
the most this month, pushing yields to the lowest level since
June, after inflation slowed for the first time in more than a
year. The dong was steady.  Consumer prices rose 22.42 percent in September from a year
earlier, slower than the 23.02 percent gain in August, according
to data released by the General Statistics Office in Hanoi on
Sept. 24. That’s the first deceleration since August 2010. The
 State Bank  of Vietnam has raised its benchmark repurchase rate
by a net 4 percentage points this year to 14 percent to contain
price increases.  “There has been more demand for bonds from foreign
investors,” said Tong Minh Tuan, deputy head of research at
Hanoi-based BIDV Securities Co., a unit of Bank for Investment &
Development of Vietnam. “They may have observed the
government’s determination to tame inflation.”  The yield on the benchmark five-year note declined five
basis points, or 0.05 percentage point, to 12.42 percent, the
lowest level since June 29, according to a daily fixing from
banks compiled by Bloomberg.  The dong was unchanged at 20,807 per dollar as of 3:25 p.m.
in Hanoi, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The central
bank fixed the  reference rate  at 20,628 today, unchanged since
Aug. 24, according to its website. The currency is allowed to
trade up to 1 percent on either side of the rate.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
