Council member Athanasios Orphanides says monetary policy in the
euro region continues to be “appropriately accomodative.”  “In my personal view, monetary policy has been
appropriately accomodative since the beginning of the crisis and
remains appropriately accommodative,” Orphanides said in  New
York  today. “We do have fiscal policy that needs to be
tightened in some of the member states,” he added.  To contact the reporter on this story:
