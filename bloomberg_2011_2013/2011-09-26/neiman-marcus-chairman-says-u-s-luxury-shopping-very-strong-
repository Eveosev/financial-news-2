Neiman Marcus Group Inc., the
luxury retailer owned by TPG Capital and Warburg Pincus LLC,
said U.S. luxury spending continues to be “very strong.”  Consumers “at the top are quite strong, and they are
spending,” Chairman Burton Tansky said in an interview today at
the World Retail Congress in Berlin. “They went through the
recession and were cautious, I think that’s behind them now.”  While the chairman doesn’t expect a “double-dip” recession,
he’s concerned about the effect of volatile equity-market share
prices on Neiman Marcus customers, who have high net worth.  If stock markets move “down and up like a yo-yo, people
get nervous,” Tansky said. “Right now people continue to want
luxury and they want quality.”  Sales of items from top-tier designers like Christian Dior
SA are doing well, as are lower-cost “option pricing” lines,
including products like an $800 handbag from a brand whose bags
are typically priced at $1,100, the chairman said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
