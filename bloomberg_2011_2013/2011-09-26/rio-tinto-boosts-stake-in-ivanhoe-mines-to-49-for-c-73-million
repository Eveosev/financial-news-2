Ivanhoe Mines Ltd. rose the most in
more than two years after Rio Tinto Group, its partner in a gold
and copper mine in Mongolia, increased its stake in the Canadian
company to 49 percent.  Ivanhoe, which owns 66 percent of the Oyu Tolgoi project,
one of the world’s largest untapped copper deposits, rose
C$2.42, or 16 percent, to C$17.42 at 4 p.m. in Toronto Stock
Exchange trading. Shares of the Vancouver-based company earlier
climbed 26 percent, the biggest intraday gain since Feb. 5,
2009.  Rio acquired 3.7 million Ivanhoe shares at an average price
of C$19.75 ($19.46), boosting its stake by 0.5 percent, London-
based Rio said today in a statement. The purchase was part of a
previous agreement with Ivanhoe that caps Rio’s stake at 49
percent. The standstill accord expires on Jan. 18.  Alex Terentiew, a Toronto-based analyst at Credit Suisse
Group AG, today upgraded his recommendation on Ivanhoe to
“outperform” from “neutral” as the company continues with
development of Oyu Tolgoi, or OT.  “Our higher rating is based on what is in our view an
overdone slide in Ivanhoe’s share price,” Terentiew said in the
note. Ivanhoe “continues to present upside potential as OT, in
our view, is a high quality asset with strategic value.”  Ivanhoe plunged 9.2 percent yesterday in Toronto trading
after reports that the Mongolian government is seeking to boost
its stake in Oyu Tolgoi to 50 percent from 34 percent. The
shares are down 21 percent this year.  The company expects the government to live up to its
commitments in a 2009 agreement that limits Mongolia’s stake in
the metal deposit until 2039, Ivanhoe said yesterday in a
statement.  “The investment agreement for the Oyu Tolgoi Project
remains a fair and legally binding contract that deserves and
requires the unqualified support of all parties,” Ivanhoe said
yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
