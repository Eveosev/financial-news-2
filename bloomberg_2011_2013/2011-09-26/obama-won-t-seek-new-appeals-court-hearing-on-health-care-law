The Obama administration set the
stage for possible U.S. Supreme Court consideration of its
landmark health-care law, saying it will forgo further review
before a federal appeals court that declared part of the law
invalid.  The  Justice Department  had until today to seek a new
hearing before a larger panel of judges at the Atlanta-based
11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. The government won’t take
that step, said  Tracy Schmaler , a Justice Department
spokeswoman. She declined to say whether the government would
file a Supreme Court appeal.  Seeking a new appeals court hearing may have pushed Supreme
Court involvement beyond its 2011-12 term and next year’s
presidential election.  The 11th Circuit concluded that Congress went beyond its
constitutional powers by requiring Americans to either acquire
insurance or pay a penalty. Twenty-six states are challenging
the measure in that case.  The 11th Circuit is one of three appellate courts since
June to have ruled on the law, which would expand coverage to a
projected 32 million Americans who lack health insurance. A
different appeals court, the Cincinnati-based 6th Circuit,
upheld the law, while a third, the Richmond, Virginia-based 4th
Circuit, said courts don’t yet have jurisdiction to get
involved.  The challengers in the 6th Circuit case have already filed
a Supreme Court appeal, and the justices may act next month in
that case.  To contact the reporters on this story:
