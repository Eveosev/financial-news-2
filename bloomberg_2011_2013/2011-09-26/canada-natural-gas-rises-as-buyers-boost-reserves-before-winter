Canadian natural gas rose as
utilities and other users bolster winter stockpiles at prices
that ended last week at a seven-week low.  U.S. inventories of gas in underground storage were 3.201
trillion cubic feet as of Sept. 16, 3.9 percent lower than the
same week a year earlier, the Energy Department said last week.
Prices at  Canada ’s benchmark AECO ‘C’ hub in Alberta closed at
$3.53 per million British thermal units Sept. 23, the lowest
level since Aug. 8, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  “It looks like there’s some storage buying,” said  Kyle Cooper , director of research for IAF Advisors in Houston.
“There are still some salt domes out there to fill.”  Alberta gas for October delivery rose 8 cents, or 2.3
percent, to C$3.54 per gigajoule ($3.27 per million Btu) as of
3:40 p.m. New York time, according to  NGX,  a Canadian Internet
market. Gas traded on the exchange is shipped to users in Canada
and the U.S. and is priced on TransCanada Corp.’s  Alberta 
system.  Gas for October delivery on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange  rose 8.1 cents, or 2.2 percent, to settle at $3.782 per
million Btu.  Spot Prices  Gas at the Alliance Pipeline delivery point near Chicago
rose 8.4 cents, or 2.2 percent, to $3.9027 per million Btu on
the  Intercontinental Exchange . Alliance is an express line that
can carry about 1.5 billion cubic feet a day to the Midwest from
western Canada.  At the Kingsgate point on the border of  Idaho  and British
Columbia, gas was up 4.67 cents to $3.7243, according to ICE. At
Malin,  Oregon , where Canadian gas is traded for California
markets, gas rose 6.6 cents to $3.7997 per million Btu.  Volume on TransCanada’s Alberta system, which collects the
output of most of the nation’s gas wells, was 15.9 billion cubic
feet, 59 billion above the target.  Gas was flowing at a daily rate of 2.72 billion cubic feet
at Empress, Alberta, where the fuel is transferred to
TransCanada’s main line.  At McNeil, Saskatchewan, where gas is transferred to the
Northern Border Pipeline for shipment to the  Chicago  area, the
daily flow rate was 2.03 billion cubic feet.  Available capacity on TransCanada’s British Columbia system
at Kingsgate was 546 million cubic feet. The system was forecast
to carry 1.33 billion cubic feet today, about 71 percent of its
capacity of 1.88 billion.  The volume on  Spectra Energy’s  British Columbia system,
which gathers the fuel in northeastern British Columbia for
delivery to Vancouver and the Pacific Northwest, totaled 3
billion cubic feet at 2:35 p.m.  To contact the reporter on this story:
