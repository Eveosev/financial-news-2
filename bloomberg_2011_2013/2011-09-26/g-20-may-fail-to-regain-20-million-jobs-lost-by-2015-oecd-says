Employment growth in the Group of
20 nations by 2015 may fail to replace the estimated 20 million
jobs lost since the global financial crisis began, according to
international jobs and development groups.  The projected job-expansion rate of 1 percent annually is
less than the pace of at least 1.3 percent needed to recover
those positions and absorb people joining the workforce,
according to a report released today by the International Labor
Organization and the Organization for Economic Cooperation and
Development.  “With economic activity slowing in several major economies
and regions, earlier improvements in the labor market are now
fading, hiring intentions are softening and there are greater
risks that high unemployment and underemployment could become
entrenched,” the groups said in the study.  About 200 million people are unemployed worldwide, close to
the 2008 peak in the global recession, they said. Sluggish
economic growth may depress the job-increase rate to 0.8
percent, according to the analysis.  A meeting of G-20 labor ministers is scheduled to begin
today in Paris. Members are Argentina,  Australia , Brazil,
Canada,  China , France,  Germany ,  India , Indonesia, Italy, Japan,
Mexico, Russia, Saudi Arabia,  South Africa , South Korea, Turkey,
the U.S., the U.K. and the European Union.  Jobless rates in some G-20 nations have started to drop.
Brazil’s unemployment rate held at 6 percent in August, down
from 9 percent in March 2009, after the economy grew 7.5 percent
last year, the most in two decades.  Other nations face more difficulties. Spain’s rate climbed
to 21.2 percent in July, the highest in  Europe , from 8.8 percent
at the end of 2007, following the collapse of a decade-long
building boom and the country’s deepest budget cuts in at least
30 years. Unemployment in the U.S. held at 9.1 percent in
August, according to the federal Labor Department.  The OECD, a Paris-based group with 34 member countries, cut
its growth forecasts on Sept. 8 for the U.S. and  Japan . The ILO
is an agency of the United Nations based in Geneva.  To contact the reporter on this story:
