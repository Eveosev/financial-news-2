Boston Scientific Corp. (BSX) ’s Guidant
LLC unit will pay $9.25 million to settle a whistleblower’s
claim that the company over-billed the U.S. and private
hospitals for heart pacemakers and defibrillators.  The U.S.  Justice Department  said today that the accord ends
a lawsuit filed against Guidant by a former sales agent, Robert
A. Fry, in federal court in Nashville, Tennessee. He will
receive more than $2.3 million from the settlement.  Guidant allegedly reneged on credits owed to the U.S.
Department of Veterans Affairs for replacement of units still
under warranty and is accused of over-charging hospitals for the
devices, causing them to over-bill Medicare, according to an
e-mailed statement from the Justice Department.  “Overcharging for lifesaving medical devices wastes
taxpayer dollars,” Assistant U.S. Attorney General  Tony West 
said in the statement.  Fry worked for Guidant in Tennessee and Kentucky from 1981
to 1997 according to a revised complaint filed with the court in
2006. His lawsuit was filed under the federal  False Claims Act .  “Boston Scientific has denied the allegations but is
pleased this settlement resolves all claims in the case,” Denise
Kaigler, a senior vice president and spokeswoman for the Natick,
Massachusetts-based company, said in an e-mailed statement.  The case is U.S. ex rel. Fry v. Guidant Corp., 03-cv-842,
U.S. District Court, Middle District of Tennessee (Nashville).  To contact the reporter on this story:
