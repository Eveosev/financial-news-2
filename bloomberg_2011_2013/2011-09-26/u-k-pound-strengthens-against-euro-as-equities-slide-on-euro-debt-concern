The pound strengthened for a second
day against the euro as concern European policy makers will fail
to resolve the region’s debt crisis spurred demand for the
perceived safety of the British currency.  Sterling appreciated versus all but two of its 16 major
counterparts amid uncertainty over whether  Greece  will receive
its next round of emergency loans. The U.K currency climbed from
within two cents of a 12-month low against the dollar. Bank of
England policy maker Ben Broadbent said inflation expectations
remain under control. Gilts weakened before the government sells
40-year debt this week.  “Investors are looking for an alternative to the euro, and
the pound benefits,” said  Neil Jones , London-based head of
European hedge-fund sales at Mizuho Corporate Bank Ltd. “The
U.K. has a stronger element of flexibility, autonomy and
independence.”  The pound appreciated 0.6 percent to 86.84 pence per euro
at 4:24 p.m. in London, after rising to 86.52 pence, the
strongest level since Sept. 14. Sterling advanced 0.7 percent to
$1.5563, after earlier falling to $1.5433. It slid to $1.5328 on
Sept. 22, the weakest since September 2010. The pound gained 0.5
percent to 118.88 yen.  The  Bank of England ’s Broadbent, who joined the Monetary
Policy Committee in June, said  Europe ’s debt crisis and the
cooling global recovery may restrain price pressures.  ‘Little Evidence’  “I see little evidence that, so far at least, high spot
inflation has materially dented confidence” in the central
bank’s 2 percent inflation target, Broadbent said during a
speech in London. “Most importantly for policy today, the
international environment is clearly disinflationary.”  Euro-region finance ministers are unlikely to decide on the
disbursement of the next tranche of aid to Greece when they meet
on Oct. 3 because a report by the  International Monetary Fund ,
 European Central Bank  and European Commission has been delayed,
German Deputy Finance Minister  Joerg Asmussen  said yesterday.  The pound has gained 1.7 percent in the past three months,
paring its 12-month decline to 4 percent, the worst performer
among 10 developed-market currencies tracked by Bloomberg
Correlation-Weighted Indexes.  The 10-year gilt yield rose six basis points to 2.43
percent. The two-year rate added three basis points to 0.56
percent, after dropping to a record low 0.477 percent on Sept.
22, the least since Bloomberg began collecting data on the
securities in 1992.  The U.K. Debt Management Office said on Sept. 21 it plans
to sell 3.75 percent bonds maturing in July 2052 through banks
this week, subject to market conditions.  Gilts have returned 9.3 percent since the end of June, and
11 percent this year, according to indexes compiled by Bloomberg
and the European Federation of Financial Analysts Societies.
German debt has gained 8.7 percent since the end of last year,
and U.S. Treasuries have returned 9.3 percent, the indexes show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
