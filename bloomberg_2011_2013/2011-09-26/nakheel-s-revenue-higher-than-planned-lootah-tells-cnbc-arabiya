Nakheel PJSC’s revenue in 2010 is
about 20 percent higher than planned, the company’s Chairman Ali
Rashed Lootah told CNBC Arabiya in remarks aired today.  Lootah said “some” people have criticized the sukuk issue
by the state-owned property developer because they deemed the
price to be high. He didn’t elaborate.  To contact the reporter on this story:
