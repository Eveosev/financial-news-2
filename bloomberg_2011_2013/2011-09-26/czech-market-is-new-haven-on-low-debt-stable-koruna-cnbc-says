The  Czech Republic  is becoming a
safe-haven market with an economic growth that outpaces most
European Union countries, a stable currency, low inflation and
low interest rates, CNBC  reported  on its website.  Investors are looking for new safe havens after the  Swiss
National Bank  set a ceiling for the franc’s appreciation against
the euro, and the Czech Republic “is emerging as a contender,”
the U.S. channel said, citing interviews with analysts.  To contact the reporter on this story:
