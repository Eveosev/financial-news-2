India ’s benchmark stock index slid
to its lowest level in a month amid concern policy makers will
fail to resolve  Europe ’s debt crisis.  Sterlite Industries (India) Ltd., the nation’s top copper
producer, dropped to a 28-month low, and  Hindalco Industries
Ltd. (HNDL) , the aluminum maker which also controls the Atlanta-based
Novelis Inc., approached a two-year low, following a retreat in
global metal prices.  Coal India Ltd. (COAL) , the biggest producer of
the fuel, dropped for a third day, losing 6.1 percent.  The BSE India Sensitive Index, or Sensex, fell 0.8 percent
to 16,036.64, the lowest level since Aug. 26, according to
preliminary closing prices in Mumbai. The S&P CNX Nifty Index on
the National Stock Exchange of India Ltd. lost 0.7 percent to
4,835.40.  U.S. Treasury Secretary  Timothy F. Geithner  warned at the
annual meeting of the  International Monetary Fund  that failure
to combat the Greek-led turmoil threatened “cascading default,
bank runs and catastrophic risk” as European policy makers face
mounting pressure to step up efforts to prevent the debt crisis
spreading.  To contact the reporter on this story:
