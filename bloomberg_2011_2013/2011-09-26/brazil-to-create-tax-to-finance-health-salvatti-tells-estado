Brazil ’s government may create a
tax to collect 45 billion reais ($24.5 billion) a year to
finance spending on health, Institutional Minister Ideli Salvatti told O Estado de S. Paulo.  Salvatti said the Brazilian Congress may approve the levy
in 2012, according to the newspaper. The government is seeking a
new financing source after the lower house approved a bill
boosting the country’s spending on health care, O Estado said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
