Google Inc. (GOOG) ’s new social-networking
service, an effort to lure away users from  Facebook  Inc., saw
U.S. visits soar 13-fold last week after the site opened to the
general public, Experian Hitwise said in a report.  The Google+ site received almost 15 million U.S. visits in
the week ended Sept. 24, compared with 1.1 million the previous
week, according to  Hitwise , a research firm in  New York . Until
last week, the service was in an early test phase, and users
could only join if they were invited.  Google, the world’s biggest Internet-search company, is
trying to leverage that dominance to gain more social-networking
users. When it opened Google+ to the public last week, it also
added new search capabilities, making it easier to find posts
from friends and other content.  With the changes, Google boosted the number of Google+
features to 100. The company is trying to provide reasons to
leave Facebook, which has more than 750 million members. Google
also unveiled an online-game service last month with developers
such as Zynga Inc., maker of the Facebook game “FarmVille,” and
Rovio Entertainment Oy, creator of the hit “Angry Birds.”  Google rose $6.38, or 1.2 percent, to $531.89 today in
Nasdaq Stock Market trading. Shares of the  Mountain View ,
California-based company have declined 10 percent this year.  To contact the reporters on this story:
