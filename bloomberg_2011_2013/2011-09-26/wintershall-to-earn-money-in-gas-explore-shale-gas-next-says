Wintershall AG, the oil and gas
unit of  BASF SE (BAS) , will make money in its gas business this year,
Chief Executive Officer Rainer Seele told  Next  magazine, a
publication by PricewaterhouseCoopers AG.  Wintershall has not agreed to the kind of long-term supply
contracts that have caused losses for competitors EON AG and  RWE
AG (RWE)  and sees “excellent new opportunities” from techniques like
hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, the CEO is cited as saying.  The company is currently exploring if shale gas deposits
can safely and economically be exploited in Europe and is
preparing to tap these resources, according to the October issue
of the magazine.  To contact the reporter on this story:
