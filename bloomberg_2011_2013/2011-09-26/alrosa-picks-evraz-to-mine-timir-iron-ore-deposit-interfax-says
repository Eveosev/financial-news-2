Evraz Group SA (EVR) , the largest Russian
steelmaker, is considering buying a 51 percent stake in the
Timir iron ore project in Yakutia from OAO Alrosa, the country’s
diamond mining monopoly.  Evraz declined to comment further in an e-mailed statement
today.  The company may pay 5 billion rubles ($170 million) to buy
half of the Timir mine, Kommersant said in June.  To contact the reporter on this story:
