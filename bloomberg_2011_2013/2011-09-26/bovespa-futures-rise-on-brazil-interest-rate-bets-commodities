The Bovespa index gained for the
first time in six days as higher  oil prices  and a rise in global
equities countered concern that quickening inflation in Brazil
and  China  will limit economic growth.  Oil companies OGX Petroleo & Gas Participacoes SA and
 Petroleo Brasileiro SA (PETR4)  followed crude’s advance. Itau Unibanco
Holdings SA led financial stocks higher. Homebuilder  Gafisa SA (GFSA3) 
dropped after economists raised their inflation forecasts amid
speculation the central bank will accelerate interest-rate cuts.
Miner Vale SA fell on concern policy makers in China, its
largest export market, will continue pursuing measures to curb
rising prices that may slow economic growth.  “The market gained because of improvements in Europe and a
better mood in the U.S.,” said Marcello Paixao, a  money manager 
at Sao Paulo-based hedge fund Principia Asset Management. “Oil
also recovered and pushed the market a little bit.”  The Bovespa rose 1 percent to 53,747.52 at 4:15 p.m. New
York time, after losing as much as 1.6 percent earlier. Forty-
seven stocks rose on the index while 20 fell and one closed
unchanged. The real gained 1.1 percent to 1.8141 per dollar.
 Brazil ’s benchmark equity gauge slumped 7 percent last week as
recession concerns drove down commodity prices.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 index added 2.3 percent. The MSCI
World Index gained 1.3 percent.  Yields on interest-rate futures contracts plunged even
after a survey showed Brazil’s central bank will miss its
inflation target this year for the first time since 2003. The
yield on the contract due in January 2013 tumbled 22 basis
points, or 0.22 percentage point, to 10.24 percent.  Crude Rises  Oil advanced amid speculation that the  European Central
Bank  may alleviate the region’s sovereign debt crisis, boosting
growth and fuel demand. Crude futures gained as much as 1.8
percent after a euro-region central bank official, who declined
to be identified, said policy makers are likely to debate the
resumption of covered-bond purchases next week. Earlier, oil
plummeted to the lowest level since Aug. 9 on concern the crisis
could trigger another recession as Greece teeters on the brink
of default.  OGX rallied 2.8 percent to 12.04 reais. Petrobras, Brazil’s
state-run oil company, rose 3.2 percent to 19.78 reais.  Itau, Latin America’s largest bank, led gains among
financial stocks, rising 2.2 percent to 28.03 reais.  Banco
Bradesco SA (BBDC4)  rose 1.8 percent to 27.33 reais.  Inflation Forecast  Consumer prices will rise 6.52 percent this year, according
to the median forecast in a Sept. 23 central bank survey of
about 100 analysts published today, as record low unemployment
and a weaker currency fuel consumer price increases. The
forecast was up from 6.46 percent the previous week. The central
bank targets inflation of 4.5 percent, plus or minus two
percentage points.  Gafisa, Brazil’s third-biggest homebuilder by revenue, slid
1.2 percent to 5.88 reais.  Rossi Residencial SA (RSID3)  dropped 1
percent to 9.34 reais.  Stocks fell today in China, Brazil’s largest trading
partner, as comments from the central bank governor that
inflation remained the nation’s “top concern” fanned
speculation policies to curb rising prices will slow economic
growth. Sixty-two percent iron ore delivered to the Chinese port
of Tianjin fell 0.7 percent to $172.90 a metric ton, the lowest
since July 11, according to the Steel Index.  Vale SA (VALE3) , the world’s largest iron-ore producer, lost 1.2
percent to 40.50 reais.  The Bovespa entered a  bear market  in July after plunging 20
percent from its bull-market peak last year. The measure
extended that drop to 27 percent through Sept. 23 and trades at
9.2 times analysts’ earnings estimates, according to weekly data
compiled by Bloomberg. That matches the ratio for  MSCI Inc. (MSCI) ’s
gauge of 21 developing nations’ equities.  Traders moved 5.9 billion reais ($3.2 billion) in stocks in
Sao Paulo on Sept. 23, data compiled by Bloomberg show. That
compares to a daily average this year of 6.53 billion reais
through Sept. 14, according to data from the exchange.  To contact the reporters on this story:
