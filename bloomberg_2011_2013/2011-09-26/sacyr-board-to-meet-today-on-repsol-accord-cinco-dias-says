Sacyr Vallehermoso SA (SYV) , the Spanish
builder that´s the largest shareholder in  Repsol YPF SA (REP) , plans
to hold a special board meeting today to discuss plans to boost
its influence over the oil company, Cinco Dias reported.  Two Sacyr stockholders, Demetrio Carceller and Juan Abello,
who together own about 25 percent of its shares, called for the
meeting to request more information about Sacyr’s August accord
to vote its shares in a bloc with Repsol shareholder Petroleos
Mexicanos, Cinco Dias said, citing unidentified people at Sacyr.  Carceller and Abello “apparently” aim to avoid taking a
hostile position toward Repsol and instead carry out a “less
belligerent” strategy toward Repsol Chairman Antonio Brufau,
the newspaper said. The Spanish  oil company  plans its own board
meeting on Sept. 28, Cinco Dias said.  Ten days ago Carceller and Abello met with Brufau and
Isidro Faine, chairman of La Caixa, the second-largest
shareholder of Repsol, which is not party to the Sacyr accord.  Click here for web link  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
