A measure of banks’ reluctance to
lend to one another in  Europe  fell for the first time in four
days, reversing an earlier increase, according to a money-
markets indicator.  The Euribor-OIS spread, the difference between three-month
Euribor and overnight index swaps, narrowed to 87 basis points
as of 4:45 p.m. in London, from 89 on Sept. 23, Bloomberg data
show. The spread had previously widened to a 2 1/2-year high of
92 basis points.  The cost for European banks to convert euro payments into
dollars, measured by the one-year cross-currency basis swap, was
little changed at 71 basis points less than the euro interbank
offered rate. The cost was 75 basis points under Euribor on
Sept. 22, when the swap was the most expensive since December
2008. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  The three-month cross-currency basis swap was 106 basis
points below Euribor, compared with 105 basis points at the end
of last week, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The ECB said financial institutions increased overnight
deposits. Banks parked 151 billion euros ($204 billion) with the
Frankfurt-based lender on Sept. 23, compared with 137 billion
euros on Sept. 22 and 198 billion euros on Sept. 12, the ECB
said.  Three-month Euribor -- the rate banks say they pay for
three-month loans in euros -- decreased to 1.535 percent from
1.537 percent on Sept. 23. One-week Euribor increased to 1.195
percent from 1.182 percent.  The three-month dollar  London  interbank offered rate, or
Libor, rose for a 12th day, to 0.363 percent from 0.360 percent,
according to the British Bankers’ Association. That’s the
highest since Aug. 16, 2010.  The TED spread, or the difference between what lenders and
the U.S. government pay to borrow for three months, was little
changed at 36.3 basis points.  To contact the reporters on this story:
