     Sept. 26 (Bloomberg)--Zhaojin Mining Industry Co., a gold
mining company in eastern  China , fell the most in more than
three-and-a-half years as the price of the precious metal
plunged.  Shares in the Shandong province-based company fell 18
percent to HK$11.52 at the close in Hong Kong. That was its
biggest decline since Jan. 22, 2008. The Hang Seng benchmark
index fell 1.5 percent today.  Gold tumbled 2.6 percent to $1,614.57 an ounce at 5:33 p.m.
in Hong Kong as equities and other commodities fell on
speculation European governments will struggle to contain the
region’s debt crisis, threatening global growth. Gold has fallen
for four days, its longest decline since May 5, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  “The market is reacting to the quick drop in gold
prices,” says Kevin Guo, a Shenzhen-based analyst at Guotai
Junan Securities Co. Ltd. “My view is that the U.S. and
European debt crisis will take a long time to resolve. Gold is
still a safe investment.”  Zhaojin spokesman Li Jia said the decline was not specific
to its stock.  “There’s no problem at all with our company’s
operations,” he said.“The whole market’s being affected. It’s
not just us.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
