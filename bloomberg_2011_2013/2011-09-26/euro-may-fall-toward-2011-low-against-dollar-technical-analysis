The euro may fall toward this
year’s low versus the dollar should it drop below key levels,
Gaitame.com Research Institute Ltd. said, citing trading
patterns.  The 17-nation common currency has entered a so-called
weekly ichimoku cloud and is likely to first drop to $1.3183,
which represents the second leading span-line, or the bottom of
the cloud, according to Takuya Kawabata, a researcher in  Tokyo 
at the unit of  Japan ’s largest foreign-exchange margin company.  The euro may then target $1.3047, a 61.8 percent Fibonacci
level, should it breach the 50 percent retracement of its
advance from a low of $1.1877 reached on June 7, 2010 to a high
of $1.4940 seen on May 4 this year, Kawabata said.  “If the euro can’t stop falling from those levels, it may
lead to further declines,” Kawabata said. “This year’s low of
the 1.28 level may come in sight.”  The euro traded at $1.3498 today as of 8:53 a.m. in Tokyo
from $1.3533 in  New York  yesterday. The currency touched $1.2867
on Jan. 10, the weakest level this year.  Ichimoku charts are used to predict a currency’s direction
by analyzing the midpoints of historical highs and lows. The
cloud refers to the area between the first and second leading-
span lines on the chart and is used to show an area where buy
orders may be clustered.  Fibonacci analysis is based on the theory that prices rise
or fall by certain percentages after reaching a high or low. A
break above resistance, or below support, indicates it may move
to the next level. Support refers to an areas where buy orders
may clustered. Resistance is where there may be orders to sell.  In  technical analysis , investors and analysts study charts
of trading patterns and prices to forecast changes in a security,
commodity, currency or index.  To contact the reporters on this story:
