Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. (TEVA) 
rose the most in almost two weeks as the generic drugmaker
agreed to buy the 50 percent stake it doesnâ€™t already own in its
Japanese joint venture Teva-Kowa Pharma Co.  The shares jumped 2.7 percent, the biggest intraday gain
since Sept. 14, to 133.90 shekels at 12:46 p.m. in  Tel Aviv ,
trimming the decline this month to 8.3 percent.  Teva will buy the stake from Kowa Co. for $150 million.  To contact the reporter on this story:
