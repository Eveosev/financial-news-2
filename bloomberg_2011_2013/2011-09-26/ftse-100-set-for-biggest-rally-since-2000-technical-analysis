U.K. stocks may drop up to 15
percent before resuming a rally that could push the  FTSE 100
Index (UKX)  to the highest level since the end of the dot-com bubble
in 2000, according to Collins Stewart Plc.  The advance from May 2009 until August 2011 was the end of
the first five-stage climb in equities suggested by Elliott Wave
theory, Richard Bayley, a technical analyst at Collins Stewart
in  London , wrote in a report to clients today. We are currently
in the middle of a three-step decline, which will be followed by
another five-part gain, he wrote.  “You probably won’t even begin to believe me until it’s
half over, but the rally from May 2009 until August 2011 was the
start of the biggest  bull market  since the dot-com bubble,”
Bayley wrote. “We will have a fall before fully recovering to
go on to new highs.”  The start of the first five-part stage of the Elliot Wave
move higher was marked by a long-term buy signal in the moving
average convergence/divergence, or MACD, indicator in May 2009,
according to the analyst. The MACD sell signal in August 2011
marked the end of the series.  The Elliott Wave is based on a theory developed by the
accountant  Ralph Nelson Elliott  during the Great Depression and
says that prices move in a pattern of five steps followed by
three steps. It contends that trends don’t move in straight
lines and that they are prone to setbacks. In a five-wave move,
waves number two and four are corrective.  Corrective Phase  “We are currently part way through the corrective phase,”
Bayley wrote in the report. “This implies a 15 percent fall,
taking the FTSE 100 to circa 4,400.”  The benchmark FTSE 100 dropped 5.6 percent last week to
5,066.81 and has slumped 13 percent since the Aug. 1 amid
concern global economic growth is slowing and  Europe ’s debt
crisis is spreading. The gauge slipped 0.5 percent to 5,043.3 at
3:18 p.m. in London today.  Collins Stewart  calculates its MACD indicator using the
difference between an index’s 12-month and 26-month moving
averages and plots the data as a line graph to identify trends.
A nine-month moving average of this line is also plotted, and
when they converge it implies a reversal in the market trend.  In  technical analysis , investors and analysts study charts
of trading patterns and prices to predict changes in a security,
commodity, currency or index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
