Former German Finance Minister  Peer Steinbrueck  said his  Social Democrats , the main opposition
party, will count on the Greens as their coalition partner after
the next federal elections in 2013,  Bild  newspaper reported,
citing an interview.  Steinbrueck said that it is still too early to talk about
whether he will run as candidate to succeed Chancellor Angela Merkel in two years, the newspaper said.  Polls show the SPD and Greens, which governed together from
1998 to 2005 under SPD Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder, leading
Merkelâ€™s coalition Christian Democrats and Free Democrats.  To contact the reporter on this story:
