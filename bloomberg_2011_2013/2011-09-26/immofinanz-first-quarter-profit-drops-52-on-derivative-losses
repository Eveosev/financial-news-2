Immofinanz AG (IIA) , eastern  Europe ’s
biggest property company, said first-quarter profit fell
47 percent, driven by changes in currency values and losses from
interest-rate swaps.  Net income declined to 31.4 million euros ($42.2 million)
in the three months ended July 31 from 59.4 million euros a year
earlier, the Vienna-based developer said today in a report.
Excluding currency swings, profit rose 17 percent as rental
income increased 2.5 percent in the period, Immofinanz said.  “The continuous optimization of the portfolio and costs,
the completion of development projects and an increased focus on
cash-flow generation should support a further improvement in
operating results,” Immofinanz said in the report. Net income
is expected to decline by 12 percent to 278.2 million euros this
year, according to the average estimate of 10 analysts surveyed
by Bloomberg.  Immofinanz, which competes with companies including  Atrium
European Real Estate Ltd. (ATRS)  and  CA Immobilien Anlagen AG (CAI) , sold 317
million euros of assets in the quarter. The disposals were part
of its plan to sell 2.5 billion euros of properties outside of
Germany,  Austria  and the six eastern European countries on which
it focuses.  Immofinanz’s shareholders are due to meet on Sept. 28 in
Vienna. The company has proposed paying them its first dividend
since 2007 after profit quadrupled last year. Chief Executive
Officer Eduard Zehetner plans to raise the payout from 10
cents for last year to 15 cents for fiscal 2012 and to 20 cents
for the following year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
