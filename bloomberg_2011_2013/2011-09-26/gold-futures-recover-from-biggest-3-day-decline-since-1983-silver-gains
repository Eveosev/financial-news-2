Gold futures gained the most in
seven weeks as commodities and equities rallied amid optimism
that European leaders will take steps to resolve the region’s
debt crisis.  The Standard & Poor’s GSCI index of 24 raw materials surged
as much as 3.6 percent, while the MSCI All-Country World Index
jumped as much as 4 percent. In the previous three sessions,
gold tumbled 12 percent, the most since 1983, on sales by
investors to cover losses in other markets amid mounting concern
that the global economy would slump.  “Gold is behaving like a classic commodity and is moving
in tandem with the equity market,”  Adam Klopfenstein , a senior
market strategist at MF Global Holdings Inc. in Chicago, said in
a telephone interview. “The selloff was overdone.”  Gold futures for December delivery gained $57.70, or 3.6
percent, to settle at $1,652.50 an ounce at 1:33 p.m. on the
Comex in New York, rising the most since Aug. 8. Yesterday, the
metal tumbled as much as $104.80 to $1,535, the lowest since
July 8.  Greek Prime Minister  George Papandreou  won parliamentary
backing for a property tax to meet deficit-reduction targets
required to avoid default.  The precious metal has gained 16 percent this year, surging
to a record $1,923.70 on Sept. 6.  “There is a small but growing group who believe this
pullback will prove to be a good buying opportunity,”  Edel Tully , a London-based analyst at UBS AG, said in a report.
“Gold needs to stabilize after suffering a good deal of
reputational damage with recent wild moves.”  Silver futures for December delivery advanced $1.56, or 5.2
percent, to $31.536 an ounce, the biggest gain since July 13. In
the previous three sessions, the price tumbled 26 percent,
touching a 10-month low of $26.15.  On the  New York Mercantile Exchange , platinum futures for
January delivery climbed $28.40, or 1.8 percent, to $1,577.40 an
ounce. Palladium futures for December delivery gained $22.55, or
3.6 percent, to $649.95 an ounce.  To contact the reporters for this story:
