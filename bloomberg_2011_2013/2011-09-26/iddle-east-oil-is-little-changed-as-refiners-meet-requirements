Middle East oil for sale to  Asia 
was little changed as refiners eased their purchases after
meeting their needs for the month.  Murban, produced by Abu Dhabi National Oil Co., for loading
in November remained a premium of 38 cents a barrel to its
official selling price, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
The price earlier this month reached 63 cents over its official
level, the most since May. Qatar Land was at a premium of 27
cents a barrel, Bloomberg data showed.  “Buyers seemed to have covered most of their requirements
for the trading month and consequently abstained from continuing
to chase barrels,” Vienna-based analysts at JBC Energy GmbH
said in their Asian Weekly report.  Oman crude for immediate loading dropped $3.03, or 2.9
percent, to $100.28 a barrel, Bloomberg data showed. Dubai oil
for loading in November decreased 2.9 percent to $99.90. Murban
for spot delivery fell 2.8 percent to $104.31.  Oman futures for November delivery climbed 92 cents to
$102.77 a barrel on the Dubai Mercantile Exchange at 6:49 p.m.
Singapore time, with 1,843 contracts traded. The settlement
price was $101.25 at 12:30 p.m. in Dubai.  The November Brent-Dubai exchange for swaps, which measures
the European marker contract against the Persian Gulf grade,
narrowed 15 cents to $4.60 a barrel, according to data from PVM.
The exchange for swaps for December fell 9 cents to $3.65.  To contact the reporter on this story:
