BNP Paribas (BNP)  SA, France’s largest
bank, said its capital level goal for the start of 2013 includes
a “marked to market” impact on its Italian sovereign debt
holdings.  BNP Paribas’s goal to reach 9 percent in common equity Tier
1 under Basel III as of Jan. 1, 2013, includes a 30 basis point
“impact” on the capital level from marking to market the 20.8
billion euros ($28.1 billion) of Italian sovereign debt,
according to a presentation today on its website. The bank
calculated the mark-to-market as of Sept. 20 without giving any
provision level for its Italian government-debt holdings. Italy
is “on track to fiscal balance by 2013,” according to the
presentation.  BNP Paribas announced on Sept. 14 it was taking steps to
cut its balance sheet by about 10 percent to help boost the
capital ratio by about 1 percentage point under Basel III rules.
Chief Executive Officer  Baudouin Prot  said in a Sept. 22 radio
interview that the French bank plans “no provision” on its
Italian sovereign-debt holdings.  “Nothing allows today to question Italy’s debt
solvency,” Prot said Sept. 22.  Separately, BNP Paribas has 15 billion euros of net excess
U.S. dollars deposited at the  Federal Reserve , the bank said in
today’s presentation. BNP Paribas repeated it got 36 billion
euros of short-term funding from U.S. money-market funds as of
Sept. 9, most of its short-term funding needs in dollars,
according to its website.  BNP Paribas has said it isn’t borrowing U.S. dollars from
the  European Central Bank .  BNP Paribas’s holdings in the sovereign debt of  Greece ,
Ireland and  Portugal  are “manageable,” the bank has said. In
Greece, the company would have a 1.7 billion-euro pretax
writedown on its sovereign holdings if it took a 55 percent
mark-to-market impairment, it said Sept. 14.  To contact the reporter on this story:
