InterDigital Inc., a technology
company considering takeover offers, plunged 14 percent on the
Nasdaq Stock Market after a report said bidders are offering $1
billion to $2 billion -- less than investors had expected.  “A large Asian mobile device company” has made a bid,
DealReporter said today, citing an unnamed source familiar with
the matter. A price of less than $2 billion would come in below
InterDigital’s market value, which was $2.6 billion at the end
of last week. It has now fallen to $2.3 billion.  The company, which owns about 1,300 patents related to
mobile-phone technology, has said its intellectual property is
more valuable than the patents auctioned off by Nortel Networks
Corp. earlier this year. A group led by  Apple Inc. (AAPL)  and Microsoft
Corp. agreed to buy that technology for $4.5 billion in July.
Later that month, InterDigital hired Evercore Partners Inc. and
 Barclays Capital  to review its options.  InterDigital fell $8.27 to $49.54 at 4 p.m. New York time,
marking the biggest decline in almost two years. The drop pared
the stock’s gain this year to 19 percent.  Jack Indekeu, a spokesman for  King of Prussia ,
Pennsylvania-based InterDigital, didn’t respond to requests for
comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
