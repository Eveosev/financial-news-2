Scotland ’s Crown Office, which is
responsible for criminal prosecutions, asked the new Libyan
government for help in the Lockerbie investigation, an
unidentified spokeswoman said in an e-mailed statement today.  The office asked the National Transitional Council to
provide any documentary evidence and witnesses needed to charge
others who acted with Abdel Basset Al-Megrahi in the bombing of
Pan Am Flight 103 in 1988.  “The trial court accepted that Megrahi acted in
furtherance of the Libyan intelligence services in an act of
state-sponsored terrorism and did not act alone,” the office
said. “The Crown will continue to pursue lines of enquiry that
become available.”  Lockerbie remained an open enquiry over who else was
involved with Al-Megrahi in the murder of 270 people, the Crown
Office said. It declined to comment further on the details of
the request as the investigation was still continuing.  Al-Megrahi, the only person found guilty of the bombing,
was convicted in 2001 and sent to prison for 27 years. He was
released from prison in Scotland in August 2009 on compassionate
grounds because he had prostate cancer and was likely to die
within a few months. Al-Megrahi returned to  Libya , where he is
still living.  To contact the reporter on this story:
