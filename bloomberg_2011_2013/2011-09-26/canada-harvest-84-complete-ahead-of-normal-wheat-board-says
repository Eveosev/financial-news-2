The harvest in the Canadian
prairies is 84 percent complete, ahead of the normal pace of 78
percent, the Canadian Wheat Board said.  Farmers have finished collecting most crops in Manitoba and
southern Saskatchewan, while northern Saskatchewan and Alberta
“still have significant harvest work to complete,” the board
said today in a statement on its  website . Crop quality for
wheat, durum and barley is “very good,” according to the
report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
