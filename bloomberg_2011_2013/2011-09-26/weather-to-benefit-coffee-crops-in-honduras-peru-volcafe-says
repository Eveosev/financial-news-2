Favorable weather is helping the
coffee crops in  Honduras  and Peru, said Volcafe, the coffee unit
of commodities trader ED&F Man Holdings Ltd.  Honduras is Central America’s largest grower, according to
the  U.S. Department of Agriculture . The 2011-12 harvest there
starts next month. The season in Peru,  South America ’s third-
largest grower, started in April, USDA data show. Peruvian
growers are now expecting flowerings for the 2012-13 marketing
year.  “Weather continues to be beneficial for the development of
the new crop,” in Honduras, Volcafe wrote in an e-mailed report
to clients Sept. 23. “Excellent” weather is resulting in good
flowering in Peru, it added.  Honduras will produce 4.4 million bags of 60 kilograms (132
pounds) in the 2011-12 season, Volcafe estimated in its latest
quarterly report.  Peru ’s output will be 4.4 million bags in
2012-13, the trader has forecast.  To contact the reporter on this story:
