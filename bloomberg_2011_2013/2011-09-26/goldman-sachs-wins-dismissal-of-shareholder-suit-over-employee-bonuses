Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)  won
dismissal of suits over employee bonuses filed in  New York  by
shareholders who called the awards a waste of assets.  Security Police & Fire Professionals of America Retirement
Fund and Judith A. Miller sued the investment bank in December
2009, accusing directors and executives of breaching their
fiduciary duties by reserving half of the company’s net revenue
for employee compensation. Shareholders Ken Brown and Central
Laborers Pension Fund filed similar suits the following month.  New York State Supreme Judge Bernard J. Fried ordered the
lawsuits dismissed on Sept. 21, according to court documents
filed today. The plaintiffs agreed to the dismissal in January
2010, after New York-based Goldman Sachs said its ratio of
compensation and benefits to net revenue for 2009 was its
“lowest as a public company,” Fried said in his ruling.  Fried denied the plaintiffs’ request for attorney fees and
expenses, and rejected a request from Brown -- who died in
December 2010 -- for an incentive fee award of $25,000. Brown’s
attorney, Lynda J. Grant, didn’t immediately return a voice-mail
message seeking comment on Fried’s ruling.  Pay Record  The firm, which set a Wall Street pay record in 2007, was
pilloried by politicians and labor unions for its compensation
practices after getting taxpayer aid during the financial
crisis.  Goldman had a 2007 compensation and benefits expense of
$20.2 billion, or 43.9 percent of revenue, that came to an
average of $661,490 per employee, according to company reports.
The pay expense dropped to $10.9 billion, or 48 percent of
revenue, in 2008 and was $16.2 billion, or 36 percent of
revenue, in 2009.  In July, Goldman Sachs officials set aside $8.44 billion
for the company’s compensation pool in the first six months of
this year. That was 9 percent less than in the same period in
2010 as revenue tumbled 11 percent.  Goldman Sachs Chief Executive Officer  Lloyd Blankfein ’s
$19 million compensation for 2010, which included a $5.4 million
cash bonus, was almost double the prior year’s award even as
Goldman Sach’s profits fell.  Blankfein and other firm executives agreed to forgo cash
bonuses in 2009 and take restricted stock grants as compensation
to mute criticism of the firm’s pay practices. Goldman Sachs
officials received billions of dollars in pay and bonuses last
year while the firm settled claims by the U.S. Securities and
Exchange Commission that executives misled investors in
collateralized debt obligations linked to subprime mortgages.  The firm agreed to pay $550 million, the largest penalty
ever levied by the SEC against a Wall Street firm, to resolve
regulators’ claims that marketing materials about the
investments had “incomplete information.”  Michael DuVally , a Goldman Sachs spokesman, declined to
comment on the ruling.  The cases are Brown v. Blankfein, 650003/2010, and Central
Laborers’ Pension Fund v. Goldman Sachs, 600036/2010, both in
New York State Supreme Court, New York County ( Manhattan ).  To contact the reporter on this story:
