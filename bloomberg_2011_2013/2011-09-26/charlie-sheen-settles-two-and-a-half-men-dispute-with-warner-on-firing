Charlie Sheen  and  Time Warner
Inc. (TWX) ’s Warner Bros. reached a confidential settlement of a
lawsuit the actor brought over his firing from the comedy “Two
and a Half Men” earlier this year, according to the studio.  “Warner Bros. Television,  Chuck Lorre  and Charlie Sheen
have resolved their dispute to the parties’ mutual
satisfaction,” the company said yesterday in an e-mailed
statement, without disclosing any terms. “The pending lawsuit
and arbitration will be dismissed as to all parties.”  The Los Angeles Times reported on Sept. 19 that the parties
were close to an agreement under which Sheen would receive about
$25 million.  Sheen had accused Warner Bros. and Lorre, the show’s
creator, of breach of contract and retaliation, among other
claims, in a complaint filed in March. Sheen, who starred in 177
episodes of the show, had sought $100 million in damages. The
show returned on CBS this month with  Ashton Kutcher  in place of
Sheen and drew its largest-ever audience.  Sheen’s lawyer, Marty Singer, declined to comment beyond 
saying that the matter has been settled to the parties' mutual 
satisfaction.  The case is Sheen v. Lorre, SC111794, California Superior
Court (Santa Monica).  To contact the reporters on this story:
