Open Text Corp. (OTEX) , the content
management company, is seeking $700 million of loans to
refinance debt, according to a person with knowledge of the
transaction.  The financing will include a $600 million  term loan  A and a
$100 million revolving line of credit, said the person, who
declined to be identified because the terms are private.  Barclays Bank Plc is arranging the deal for the Waterloo,
Ontario-based company and will host a lender meeting Oct. 5 at
10 a.m. in  New York .  A portion of the new debt will be used to refinance the
company’s existing term piece due Oct. 2013 and repay borrowings
under a revolving line of credit which were made to finance the
acquisition of Global 360 Holdings Corp., according to a July 13
 statement .  Open Text  acquired the provider of process and case
management solutions for approximately $260 million.  Richard Maganini, a spokesman for Open Text, didn’t respond
to an e-mail seeking comment.  In a revolving credit facility, money can be borrowed again
once it’s repaid; in a term loan, it can’t. A term loan A is
sold primarily to banks.  To contact the reporter on this story:
