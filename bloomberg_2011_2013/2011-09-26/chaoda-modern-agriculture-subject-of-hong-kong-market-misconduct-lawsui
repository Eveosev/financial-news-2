Chaoda Modern Agriculture Holdings
Ltd. (682) , the Chinese food producer defending a claim from Next
Magazine that it overstated its land holdings, is the subject of
a Hong Kong government market misconduct lawsuit.  Hong Kong’s Financial Secretary initiated proceedings
against the company in the city’s Market Misconduct Tribunal,
according to government spokeswoman Shirley Wong. Tribunal
secretary William Chow declined to elaborate on the specific
allegations or people involved.  The city’s Market Misconduct Tribunal hears civil cases
involving stock market manipulation, false trading,  insider
trading  and three other offenses. The tribunal can order the
disgorgement of profits gained or loss avoided as a result of
misconduct, and can bar individuals from being corporate
directors, according to its website.  Chaoda spokesman Simon Shi said he hadn’t heard about the
proceedings and wasn’t immediately able to comment.  Chaoda shares have fallen 59 percent as of 10 a.m. today
since May 26, when Next Magazine reported the company
exaggerated the size of its farmland. The company said in a June
3 exchange filing the allegations were false.  To contact the reporter on this story:
