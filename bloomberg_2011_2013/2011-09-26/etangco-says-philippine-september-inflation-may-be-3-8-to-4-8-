Philippine inflation this month may
be within 3.8 percent to 4.8 percent, central bank Governor
Amando Tetangco said, citing prices of vegetables and canned
food along with the peso movement as “dominant” factors.  Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas “will ensure that our policy
settings remain appropriate,” Tetangco said in a mobile phone
message. “Inflation expectations remain manageable over the
policy horizon. We are watchful of global developments that may
affect aggregate global demand, capital flows and prices of
international commodities.” Inflation slowed to 4.3 percent in
August, based on 2000 prices.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
