The U.S. Oil Fund, the largest
exchange-traded fund in crude oil, closed at a premium of 
0.55 percent on Sept. 23, according to figures on the fundâ€™s
website. A premium means that the closing price of the shares
is higher than the value of its underlying holdings in the fuel.  Crude oil for November delivery fell 66 cents, or 0.82
percent, to $79.85 a barrel on the  New York Mercantile Exchange 
on Sept. 23.       
NOTE: The fund aims to track the price of West Texas Intermediate
delivered to Cushing,  Oklahoma . The ETF buys the near-month
contract, then rolls forward by selling it before expiration
and buying the following month.  SOURCE: United States Oil Fund  To contact the reporter on this story:
