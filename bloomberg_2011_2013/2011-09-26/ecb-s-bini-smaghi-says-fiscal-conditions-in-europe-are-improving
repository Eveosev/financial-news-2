European Central Bank Executive
Board member Lorenzo Bini Smaghi said fiscal conditions in
 Europe  “are improving.”  At the same time, leaders may have to agree on another
reform of the European Financial Stability Facility, Bini Smaghi
said in a speech in  New York  today. The July 21 decisions “will
be ratified at the end of this month, and probably more will be
needed,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
