Following is the table for South  Korea ’s
monthly consumer survey index for September from the Bank of Korea in
 Seoul .                          A reading below 100 indicates pessimists outnumber optimists.
The survey frequency changed to monthly from quarterly in September, 2008.  NOTE: Diffusion Index             Level change from prior period is calculated by Bloomberg.  SOURCE:  Bank of Korea              To contact the reporter on this story:
