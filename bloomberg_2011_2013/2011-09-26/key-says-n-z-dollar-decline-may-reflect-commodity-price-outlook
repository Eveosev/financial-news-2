The New Zealand dollar’s 7.2
percent decline the past month is helpful for exporters while
also reflecting weaker commodity prices, according to Prime
Minister John Key.     “The exchange rate has eased off a bit recently so that’s
helpful for our exporters,” Key told TV3 News today.
“Sometimes when the exchange rate goes down its a reflection of
how badly international markets are or that commodity prices
might be easing back so its not always a one-way good-news
story.”  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
