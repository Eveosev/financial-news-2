Annual trade between  Iran  and  China 
will be worth $45 billion when the current Iranian calendar year
ends on March 19, the state-run  Press TV  news channel said,
citing Iranâ€™s ambassador to China, Mehdi Safari.  The Iran-China trade was worth $30 billion in the last
Iranian year, Safari was quoted as saying yesterday.  Trade between the two countries rose 52 percent after the
U.S. and the United Nations imposed additional sanctions in June
2010 with a goal of pressuring Iran to end its nuclear program,
which the U.S. and its allies accuse of being a cover for
developing atomic weapons.  To contact the reporter on this story:
