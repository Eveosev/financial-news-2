European Central Bank Governing
Council member Josef Bonnici said providing liquidity to euro-
region lenders is more important than changing the bank’s
interest rates in the current situation, Market News reported.  “More than interest rates” the provision of liquidity
“is probably of more significance at this stage,” Bonnici, who
represents Malta on the ECB’s council, told Market News in an
interview. Re-introducing a one-year tender would increase
stability, he was quoted as saying.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
