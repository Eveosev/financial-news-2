European Central Bank Governing
Council member Yves Mersch said policy makers aren’t ruling out
lowering  interest rates  if the economic slowdown intensifies,
 Germany ’s Boersen-Zeitung reported, citing an interview.  “Interest-rate cuts aren’t completely excluded,” Mersch
told the newspaper. “If the economic dynamic in the euro area
deteriorated significantly, against indications of current data,
we’d have room to act.”  In the medium term, the ECB should consider raising rates
as inflation exceeds the current benchmark rate, resulting in
negative real interest rates, he said.  The likelihood of a recession in the euro area is low,
Mersch was quoted as saying. He also said he’s skeptical of
turning the European Financial Stability Facility into a bank.  “As public bank, the EFSF would have to succumb to general
rules for banks,” Mersch said. “Against this backdrop alone, a
bank license is not a panacea.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
