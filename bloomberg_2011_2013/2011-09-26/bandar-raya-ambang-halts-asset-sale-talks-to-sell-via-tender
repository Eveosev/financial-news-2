Bandar Raya Developments Bhd. (BRD)  has
ceased talks to sell its office and malls to Ambang Sehati Sdn.
for 430 million ringgit ($136 million) and will instead dispose
them by way of a tender exercise.  An independent international property valuation firm will
be appointed to manage the bids and Ambang Sehati will be
invited to participate in the tender, the Malaysian company said
in a statement last night. The move was made to ease concerns
among various stakeholders, it said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
