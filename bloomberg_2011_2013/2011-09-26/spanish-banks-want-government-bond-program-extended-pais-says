Spanish banks and savings banks
have asked the government for an extension of government-backed
bond issues for at least six months more after the current
December deadline,  El Pais  reported, without citing anyone.  Spanish lenders, which hold 61.6 billion euros ($82.6
billion) of bonds issued, are having difficulties to access
financing on their own and would issue 70 billion euros of
government-backed bonds more, the newspaper said.  Both lenders and savings banks may have requested  Spain â€™s
deputy finance minister Jose Manuel Campa for the extension
through their lobby groups, El Pais said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
