The  European Commission , the
European Union’s executive arm, will propose new rules for
auditors in November to bolster investor confidence in financial
information.  The measures could force companies to periodically change
auditors and prevent auditing firms from offering management-
consulting services, Accountancy Age reported today, citing a
draft version of the proposals.  Commission officials have yet to complete the draft
measures, which “may be subject to change before they’re
proposed in November,”  Chantal Hughes , a spokeswoman for the
commission, said in a telephone interview in Brussels.  The EU is reviewing audit rules following the collapse of
Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc., which raised questions “in the
context of the audit” of the bank,  Michel Barnier , the EU’s
financial services commissioner, told lawmakers last year. The
top four accounting firms have market share of about 90 percent
in the majority of EU member states, according to the
commission’s report last year.  To contact the reporters on this story:
