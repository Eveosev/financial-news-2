The Lockerbie bombing case “is
over” and there is no need for further prosecutions, said
Mohammed Al-Alagi, the justice minister in  Libya ’s ruling
council.  Al-Alagi’s comments, at a press conference in Tripoli
today, came after  Scotland ’s Crown Office asked the National
Transitional Council to provide any documentary evidence and
witnesses that may help to charge others who acted with Abdel Basset Al-Megrahi in the bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 in 1988.  The toppling of Muammar Qaddafi’s regime after a seven-
month revolt has renewed interest in the Lockerbie bombing that
killed 270 people. Al-Megrahi, the only person found guilty for
the attack, was convicted in 2001 and sent to prison for 27
years. He was released from prison in Scotland in August 2009 on
compassionate grounds because of what officials said at the time
was advanced prostate cancer.  A new interim Libyan government should be formed in the
“coming days,” Al-Alagi said today. He has asked not to be
included in the government, he said.  The interim cabinet today issued a decree abolishing
special emergency courts established during the Qaddafi era, Al-
Alagi said. The courts were used to prosecute people for their
political beliefs, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
