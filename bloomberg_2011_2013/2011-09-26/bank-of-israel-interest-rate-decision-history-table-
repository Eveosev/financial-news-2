The following table details the
changes in the Bank of  Israel â€™s headline interest rate.  Since Bloomberg started surveys for the interest rate
in December 2003 there have been a total of 93 rate decisions
by the bank for which surveys were conducted. In 25 cases the
survey did not match the decision made, resulting in the survey
correctly predicting the decision 73.1% of the time.
