Bank of England  policy maker Ben
Broadbent said there is no limit “in principle” to the amount
of bond purchases the central bank could do if it restarted so
called quantitative easing.  “In terms of the bank’s balance sheet, there is no
constraint,” Broadbent said in response to audience questions
at an event in  London  today. Still, “there is a stock of
gilts” and “one wants a certain number freely exchanged” in
the market, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
