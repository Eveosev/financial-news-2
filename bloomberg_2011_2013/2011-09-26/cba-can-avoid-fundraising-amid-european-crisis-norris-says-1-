Commonwealth Bank of Australia (CBA) , the
country’s largest lender, can wait until 2012 before raising
more funds for lending, avoiding high debt costs caused by
Europe’s credit crisis, its chief executive officer said.  “We can last several months -- we wouldn’t have to do any
funding this year,” CEO Ralph Norris told reporters in Sydney
today. “When you have these periods of volatility, it certainly
does cause an increase in funding costs.”  Commonwealth Bank raised a “significant amount” of funds
before the latest European crisis, and the Sydney-based bank
hasn’t invested in European  government bonds  “to any extent,”
said Norris, who will be succeeded by Ian Narev next month.  Australia ’s four biggest banks, which rely on debt markets
to raise funds to lend, have avoided bond sales of more than
A$500 million ($486 million) as  Europe ’s sovereign debt crisis
worsened. Westpac Banking Corp.’s sale of 100 billion yen ($1.3
billion) of notes on Aug. 4 was the last benchmark offering by
one of the top four lenders, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Commonwealth Bank today rose 1.6 percent to A$44.03 at 2:51
p.m. in Sydney. The bank has dropped 13 percent this year, less
than the benchmark S&P/ASX 200 index’s 18 percent decline.  Editors: James Gunsalus, Linus Chua  To contact the reporter on this story:
