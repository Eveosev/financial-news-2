The  Boston   Red Sox  beat the New
York Yankees 7-4 in 14 innings to avoid falling into a tie with
Tampa Bay for the American League wild card playoff spot.  Jacoby Ellsbury hit a three-run home run as the Red Sox won
the finale of the three-game series at Yankee Stadium. It was
the sixth win in the past 24 games for Boston, which had lost
the first game of todayâ€™s doubleheader 6-2.  A loss in the second game would have left the Red Sox tied
with the Rays in the AL wild card race. Boston is one game ahead
of Tampa Bay with three games left in the regular season.  The Red Sox visit the  Baltimore Orioles  for their last
three regular-season games. Tampa Bay hosts its final three
games against the Yankees, who clinched the AL East division
title last week to reach the playoffs for the 16th time in 17
years.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
