A recapitalization of European
banks should be part of the region’s effort to contain the
sovereign-debt crisis, European Union Monetary Affairs
Commissioner  Olli Rehn  told Germany’s  Welt newspaper .  “We have to supplement the repair work in the financial
sector with a stronger recapitalization of banks to reduce the
risk of a credit squeeze and prevent a further slowdown of
economic growth, which is now materializing in  Europe  and the
U.S.,” Rehn was quoted as saying. “The current crisis is a
serious combination of a sovereign-debt crisis and weakness in
the banking sector. We can’t solve one without the other.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
