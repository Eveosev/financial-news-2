President Petroleum Co., the oil
producer backed by former Imperial Energy Corp. Chairman Peter Levine, will use cash from new wells to finance field
acquisitions in  Argentina .  President acquired a 50 percent interest in the Puesto
Guardian license in Salta province in northern Argentina in
July. Production from five wells there and two more in the U.S.
state of  Louisiana  will provide cash for the company to add
acreage, said Levine, who owns 29.5 percent of President. The
company may produce 2,500 barrels a day by the end of next year.  “We have morphed into a production company,” Levine said
in a telephone interview. “We’re looking for acquisition
opportunities to develop something with critical mass.”  President, based in  London , wants fields that have already
been discovered, where enhanced recovery techniques and renewed
exploration can revive production, he said.  Levine agreed to sell Siberian oil producer Imperial Energy
Corp. to  India ’s Oil & Natural Gas Corp. in 2008 for $2.6
billion. The sale netted Levine about 80 million pounds ($123
million) and his personal fortune stands about 110 million
pounds, according to London’s Sunday Times newspaper.  President shares have dropped 65 percent this year, trading
at 30.5 pence in London today. That values the company at 35
million pounds. London’s AIM Oil & Gas index of smallcap energy
companies has declined 39 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
