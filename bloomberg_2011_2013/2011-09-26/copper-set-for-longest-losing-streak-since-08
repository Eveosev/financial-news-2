Copper fell for a seventh day, the
longest losing streak since December 2008, on worries that a
failure to contain  Europe ’s sovereign-debt crisis may lead to a
slump in demand. Lead, nickel and tin also dropped.  Three-month delivery copper on the London Metal Exchange
fell as much as 2.3 percent to $7,170 a metric ton and traded at
$7,184.75 at 1:26 p.m. Shanghai time. The contract tumbled to a
13-month low on Sept. 23 and lost 15 percent last week.  U.S. Treasury Secretary  Timothy F. Geithner  called on
governments to unite with the  European Central Bank  to beef-up
the capacity of their 440 billion-euro ($594 billion) bailout
fund, warning failure to act threatened “cascading default,
bank runs and catastrophic risk.”  “Copper is clearly in a downward trend, as investors see
no improvement in the macro environment, only deterioration,”
Zhang Zhenghua, an analyst at Minmetals Futures Co., said today
by phone from  Shanghai .  Commodities fell to a nine-month low on Sept. 23, with the
Standard & Poor’s GSCI Index of 24 of energy, metal and
agriculture prices declining 1.4 percent. The measure slumped
8.3 percent last week, the most in four months, and has tumbled
21 percent since touching a 32-month high in April.  The metal for November delivery on the Shanghai Futures
Exchange fell 2.8 percent to 55,370 yuan ($8,671) a ton, sliding
for a sixth consecutive day, after tumbling 14 percent last
week.  Significant Risk  Copper has the most significant “fundamental” risk of
declining out of the industrial metals because prices are well
above the marginal cost of production, Macquarie Group Ltd. said
in a report today.  Speculators were their most bearish on copper since July
2009, as managed-money funds held net-short positions in copper,
or wagers on falling prices, totaling 6,672 futures and options
contracts as of Sept. 20, data from the U.S. Commodity Futures
Trading Commission compiled by Bloomberg showed. The measure
showed net-long positions a week earlier of 300 futures and
options contracts, betting on higher prices.  Aluminum fell 0.5 percent to $2,195 a ton, and zinc dropped
1.7 percent to 1,879 a ton. Lead fell as much as 7.9 percent to
1,800 a ton, the lowest since July 2010. Nickel declined 3.4
percent to $17,650 a ton, and tin retreated 5.9 percent to
$19,005 a ton.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
