DreamWorks Animation SKG, Inc. the
producer of computer-generated animated feature films, agreed to
supply films and television specials through  Netflix Inc. (NFLX) , the
online movie rental service, the New York Times reported, citing
executives at the two companies.  The agreement, which analysts said will give DreamWorks $30
million per picture over an unspecified number of years, marks
the first time an important Hollywood supplied chose to use Web
streaming instead of  pay television , the newspaper said.  The accord comes as Netflix faces rising competition and
conflicts over its strategy to raise prices and split up
Internet streaming and DVD services, the Times said.  About one million of Netflixâ€™s 25 million U.S. customers
are said to have dropped the service this quarter and the
company has lost half its market value in the last two months,
the newspaper said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
