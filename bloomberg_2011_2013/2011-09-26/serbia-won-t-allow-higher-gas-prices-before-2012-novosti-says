Serbia won’t approve higher  gas
prices  this year as requested by Srbijagas, the state-run gas
company, because of their impact on inflation,  Vecernje Novosti 
newspaper reported, citing an unidentified government person.  An increase may be allowed in 2012, the newspaper reported,
adding that Srbijagas, which has blamed the government’s price
cap for its losses, will have to try to cut costs of imports and
distribution of Russian gas that covers 95 percent of the
country’s needs.  To contact the reporter on this story:
