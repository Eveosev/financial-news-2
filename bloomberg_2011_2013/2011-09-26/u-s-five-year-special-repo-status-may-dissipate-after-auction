Treasury five-year notes will be in
less demand in the short-term market for borrowing and lending
the securities after the government sells $35 billion of the
debt this week, according to traders.  They have been willing to pay to borrow the securities in
exchange for loaning cash for the most actively traded five-year
notes, the 1 percent securities maturing in August 2016.  The current five-year note opened at the lowest repo rate
of negative 0.20 percent and was at the lowest repo rate of
negative 0.97 percent at 10 a.m.  New York  time, according to
figures from ICAP Plc, the world’s largest inter-dealer broker.
The overnight general collateral rate opened today at 0.20
percent and traded at 0.22 percent at 10 a.m.  “The Street will typically set up large shorts to position
for upcoming supply,” said Kenneth Silliman, head of short-term
rates trading in New York at Toronto Dominion Bank’s TD
Securities unit. “That typically will work its way out once the
new issue settles.” A short is a bet a security may lose value.  Dealers use repos to finance holdings and increase
leverage. Securities that can be borrowed at  interest rates 
close to the  Federal Reserve ’s target rate of zero to 0.25
percent are called general collateral. Those in highest demand
have lower rates and are called “special.”  Five-Year Auction  The Treasury will auction five-year notes on Sept. 28 after
selling $35 billion of two-year securities tomorrow. It will
offer $29 billion of seven-year debt Sept. 29.  The yield on the existing five-year note increased three
basis points, or 0.03 percentage point, to 0.91 percent,
according to Bloomberg Bond Trader prices. The 1 percent
security maturing in August 2016 dropped 5/32, or $1.56 per
$1,000 face amount, to 100 14/32.  “The specialness of the current five-year note should
dissipate after we get new supply later this week,” said  Brian Smedley , a strategist in New York at Bank of America Merrill
Lynch. “It will turn out to be a short-term phenomenon ahead of
the auction.”  The central bank owns about $1.07 billion of the 1 percent
coupon Treasury note that matures in August 2016 in its System
Open Market Account, or  SOMA , as of Sept. 21, according to data
on the New York Fed’s website. That is equivalent to 2.97
percent of the total outstanding.  The Fed offers specific  Treasury securities  held in SOMA
for loans to dealers against general collateral on an overnight
basis. Dealers bid in a multiple-price auction held every day at
noon New York time.  To contact the reporter on this story:
