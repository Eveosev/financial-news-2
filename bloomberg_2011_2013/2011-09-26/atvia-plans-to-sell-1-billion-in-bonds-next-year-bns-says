Latvia plans to sell $1 billion of
Eurobonds next year to begin building reserves to repay its
international loan, the  Baltic News Service  reported, citing
Finance Ministry spokesman Aleksis Jarockis.  Latvia plans to boost reserves to repay part of the
countryâ€™s international loan that is due in 2014 and 2015,
Jarockis told the Riga-based newswire. The Baltic country took a
7.5 billion-euro ($10.1 billion) loan from a group led by the
European Commission and the  International Monetary Fund  in 2008
after its second biggest-bank needed a state rescue.  To contact the reporter on this story:
