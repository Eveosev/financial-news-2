The new president of  Georgia ’s
breakaway region of Abkhazia pledged to bolster ties with  Russia 
and seek wider international recognition for his country as he
was inaugurated.  Alexander Ankvab, who won an Aug.27 presidential poll, was
inaugurated today at a ceremony in the capital, Sukhumi.
Valentina Matviyenko, the speaker in Russia’s Federation
Council, or upper house of parliament, attended the event,
according to the  text  of Ankvab’s speech posted on the website
of Abkhazia’s state news service, Apsnypress.  Abkhazia declared independence from Georgia after a war in
the early 1990s that left hundreds of thousands displaced. In
August 2008, Russia routed Georgia’s army in a war over another
breakaway region,  South Ossetia , and then recognized both
regions’ independence, agreeing to defend their borders. Georgia
considers both regions part of its territory.  The U.S., European Union and NATO said after the election
that they wouldn’t recognize the results of the vote.  To contact the reporter on this story:
