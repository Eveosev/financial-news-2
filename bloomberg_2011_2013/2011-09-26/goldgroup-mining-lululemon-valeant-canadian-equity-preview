Canadian stocks advanced the most
in more than a month as banks and commodity futures gained on
speculation Europe will act to stem its debt crisis.  Royal Bank of Canada (RY) , the country’s largest lender by
assets, advanced 4.1 percent amid rumors that the  European
Central Bank  would create a European version of the U.S.’s
Troubled Asset Relief Program, cut  interest rates  and restart
covered-bond purchases. Ivanhoe Mines, which is building a
copper and gold mine in  Mongolia  with Rio Tinto Group, plunged
9.2 percent after the government of Mongolia sought to increase
its stake in the project. Suncor Energy Inc. rose 4.5 percent
after  natural gas  futures advanced as warmer-than-normal weather
increased demand for the power-plant fuel.  The Standard & Poor’s/TSX Composite Index gained 244.32
points, or 2.1 percent, to 11,707.19, the most since Aug. 23.
The index swung between gains and losses before rallying after
2:30 p.m.  “The market didn’t really digest that rumor until this
afternoon when it finally tuned into the sense of urgency in
 Europe ,”  Barry Schwartz , a  money manager  at Baskin Financial
Services Inc., said in a telephone interview. The firm oversees
C$420 million ($410 million).  Canada ’s stock benchmark slumped 6.5 percent last week, the
most since March 2009, as economic data from Europe,  North
America  and  China  were more indicative of a slowdown than most
economists had forecast in Bloomberg surveys. Crude oil declined
9.2 percent while gold sank 9.6 percent and silver plunged 26
percent as investors sold commodities to cover losses in other
assets. Energy and raw-materials companies make up 47 percent of
Canadian stocks by market value, according to Bloomberg data.  12-Month Loans  Canadian banks advanced amid speculation that the European
Central Bank may restart covered-bond purchases next week and
cut interest rates next month. The reintroduction of 12-month
loans to banks will also be discussed at the ECB’s Oct. 6 policy
meeting, a euro-region central bank official said, who spoke on
condition of anonymity because the information is confidential.  Royal Bank of Canada climbed 4.1 percent to C$47.98.
 Toronto-Dominion Bank (TD) , the country’s second-largest lender by
assets, advanced 4.1 percent to C$73.85.  Bank of Montreal (BMO) ,
Canada’s fourth-largest lender by assets, rose 4.2 percent to
C$58.29.  The S&P/TSX Energy Index rose 2.7 percent to end a six-day
drop as crude futures advanced.  Natural Gas, Oil  Suncor Energy, the country’s biggest oil and gas producer,
climbed 4.5 percent to C$27.66. Canadian Natural Resources Ltd.,
the country’s second-biggest energy company by market value,
jumped 1.7 percent to C$31.55. Talisman Energy Inc., an oil and
gas producer with operations in North America, gained 2.5
percent to C$13.69.  Gold fell, capping the biggest three-session slump since
1983, and silver closed below $30 an ounce on investor sales to
cover losses in other assets.  Extorre Gold, which explores in  Argentina , lost 6.1 percent
to C$7.30.  Detour Gold Corp. (DGC) , the company exploring for gold in
northern Ontario, decreased 2.7 percent to C$31.17.  Tahoe Resources slid for a third day, falling 8 percent to
C$15.57. Michael Gray, an analyst at Macquarie Group Ltd.,
lowered his 12 month price estimate on the shares to C$23 from
C$27.  Ivanhoe Mines erased 9.2 percent to C$15. The company is
half-way through completion on a project in Mongolia that will
be one of the world’s five-biggest copper mines, according to
Rio Tinto Group.  The government of the Asian country is seeking to boost its
stake in the mine to 50 percent from 34 percent, Dashdorj
Zorigt, Mongolia’s minerals minister, told reporters at Oyu
Tolgoi yesterday. Such an increase is permitted only after 30
years, according to a summary of the $10 billion project
agreement from London-based Rio, which said the new proposal may
alarm foreign investors.  To contact the reporter on this story:
