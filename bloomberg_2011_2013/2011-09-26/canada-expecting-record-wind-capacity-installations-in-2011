Canada will likely install a record
amount of wind-power capacity this year, led by Ontario where
developers have benefited from above-market rates for low-carbon
sources of electricity.  About 1,338 megawatts of new  wind energy  is expected to
come on line this year, almost double last year’s 690 megawatts,
the Canadian Wind Energy Association said today in an e-mailed
statement. That represents an investment of C$3.5 billion ($3.4
billion) on turbines and other equipment, the group said.  Canada will have at least 5,300 gigawatts of installed wind
capacity by the end of the year, the Ottawa-based trade group
said in the statement. The nation of 34 million, which has no
national incentive program for renewable energy, was the world’s
ninth-largest generator of wind power at the end of last year,
according to the Bonn-based World Wind Energy Association.  Ontario’s feed-in tariff program, which offers above-market
rates to projects that produce power from renewable sources,
helped investors install more than 500 megawatts of wind power
this year. At the other side of the country, British Columbia
developer  Naikun Wind Energy Group Inc. (NKW)  is working on the
country’s first offshore wind farm, in the Pacific Ocean south
of the Alaskan Panhandle.  To contact the reporter on this story:
