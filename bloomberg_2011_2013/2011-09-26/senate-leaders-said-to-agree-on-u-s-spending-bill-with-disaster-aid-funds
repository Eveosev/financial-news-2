Democratic and Republican Senate
leaders agreed on legislation to avoid a government shutdown and
provide $2.65 billion in disaster aid without offsetting cuts
elsewhere in the budget, a leadership aide said.  The new plan, announced by Reid today, would fund the U.S.
government through Nov. 18 and provide $2.65 billion in disaster
aid for the next fiscal year without offsetting cuts elsewhere
in the budget. Before considering that plan, the Senate is
voting on an earlier measure offered by Reid last week that is
likely to fail.  Republicans had demanded offsetting cuts in exchange for an
additional $1 billion to keep the  Federal Emergency Management
Agency  operating through the end of this week.  That issue became moot after FEMA said it has enough funds
to help disaster victims through the Sept. 30 end of this fiscal
year, said Brian Fallon, a spokesman for Senator Chuck Schumer
of  New York , the No. 3 Democratic leader.  “FEMA says they have the money to cover it,” Fallon said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
