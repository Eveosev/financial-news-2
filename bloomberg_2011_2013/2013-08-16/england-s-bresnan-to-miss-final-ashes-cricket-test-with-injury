England  pace bowler  Tim Bresnan  will
miss the final Ashes cricket Test against Australia because of a
stress fracture in his lower back.  The 28-year-old has played in three of the first four
matches in the series, taking 10 wickets. In the last game at
Chester-le-Street, he came in as night watchman and scored 45 to
help England to the victory that clinched the series.  Bresnan will also miss the two-game Twenty20 series and the
five-game one-day series against Australia that follow the
Ashes. It’s unknown if he’ll be ready for the next Ashes series,
which begins in Australia in November.  “Bresnan will begin a recovery and rehabilitation program
and a date for his return to cricket will be determined in due
course,” the England and Wales Cricket Board said on its
 website .  The fifth Ashes Test begins Aug. 21 at the Oval in London.
England has won three and drawn one so far in the series.  To contact the reporter on this story:
