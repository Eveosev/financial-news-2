Daimler AG (DAI) ’s Mercedes-Benz brand,
the world’s third-biggest luxury carmaker, produced more
vehicles than ever before in the first half to cover demand for
its new compact models and sport-utility vehicles.  Mercedes manufactured more than 700,000 vehicles globally,
the Stuttgart, Germany-based company said in a statement today.  “We are planning for further growth,”  Andreas Renschler ,
head of manufacturing, said in the statement. “We are also very
optimistic for the year as a whole.”  Mercedes is targeting record sales of more than 1.4 million
cars and SUVs this year. This compares to a goal of  Volkswagen
AG (VOW) ’s Audi division to top the 1.5 million mark. Bayerische
Motoren Werke AG, the world’s biggest maker of luxury cars, aims
for another year of record sales after delivering 1.54 million
vehicles of its namesake brand last year.  The European car market, which is heading into the sixth
straight year of decline, is stabilizing, Germany’s  VDA 
automobile industry association said in a separate statement
today. New car registrations in the region rose 4.8 percent in
July to 1.02 million vehicles, the second month of gains this
year, the first being April, the Berlin-based industry group
said.  Auto executives predict the European car market will
gradually improve in the second half and into 2014 supported by
the euro area economy returning to growth after six quarters of
contraction.  Vacation Workers  Mercedes hired about 4,500 vacation workers to keep
production volumes up during the summer holiday season, the
company said in the statement. To meet demand for the compact A-and B-Class, the Rastatt,  Germany  plant worked 21 extra shifts,
and the SUV assembly in Tuscaloosa produced on 10 Saturdays.  Mercedes is broadening its compact car line-up this year
with the CLA four-door coupe, has revamped the upscale E-Class
and started to deliver a new generation of its flagship S-Class
model in July.  The brand’s seven-month global deliveries through July
increased 8.1 percent to 811,227 vehicles helped by a sales
increase of 5.7 percent to 382,088 vehicles in  Europe . Sales
through July climbed 12 percent to 165,598 vehicles in the U.S.
After a reshuffle of the sales organization in  China , Mercedes-Benz sales in the territory gained 3.5 percent to 117,444 cars.  To contact the reporter on this story:
