The pound posted a second weekly
gain versus the euro and the dollar amid signs the U.K. economic
recovery is gathering pace, fueling bets the  Bank of England 
will raise  interest rates  earlier than policy makers forecast.  Sterling climbed to an eight-week high against the dollar
as investors boosted wagers the central bank will increase its
benchmark rate before 2016, when it anticipates the  unemployment
rate  will have fallen enough to justify higher borrowing costs.
U.K. government 10-year bonds dropped for a fourth week, with
the yield climbing yesterday to the highest since August 2011.  “It’s another good week for the pound,” said Christian Lawrence, a foreign-exchange strategist at Rabobank
International in London. “If data continues to improve, then
that could possibly raise market expectations that the BOE will
begin raising rates at a slightly earlier juncture.”  The pound was little changed at 85.32 pence per euro at
4:40 p.m. London time, after appreciating to 85.05 pence
yesterday, the strongest since July 3. That left it with a 0.9
percent weekly gain versus the single currency. Sterling slipped
0.2 percent to $1.5619, after earlier rising to $1.5657, the
highest level since June 19. Britain’s currency gained 0.8
percent versus its U.S. counterpart this week.  A government report yesterday showed retail sales rose last
month more than economists forecast, while data a day earlier
showed the rate for jobless claims fell to the least since
February 2009. Purchasing managers surveys of services,
manufacturing and construction activity all improved in July.  Carney Pledge  Bank of England Governor  Mark Carney  has pledged to refrain
from raising borrowing costs until the jobless rate falls to 7
percent, which policy makers don’t expect until at least the
fourth quarter of 2016. Seventeen of 25 forecasters in a
Bloomberg survey see unemployment falling to that level by
mid-2016, with 13 predicting it will happen in 2015 at the
latest.  The implied yield on short-sterling futures contracts
expiring in September 2016 rose to 2.23 percent yesterday, the
most since June 24, signaling that traders boosted bets that
interest rates would rise. The yield surged 37 basis points this
week to 2.21 percent.  The U.K. currency has jumped 4 percent in the past six
months, the best performer of 10 developed-nation currencies
tracked by Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes. The euro
gained 2.9 percent and the dollar strengthened 3.2 percent.  The pound’s advance provides an opportunity to sell,
according to Morgan Stanley strategists led by  Hans Redeker  in
London. They predict sterling will weaken to $1.48 in three
months on bets the Bank of England will reaffirm its intention
to keep interest rates low.  Market ‘Obsessed’  “The market is obsessed with the economic momentum, but
there is a substantial output gap in the U.K., which will
require several years of good economic performance to close,”
Redeker, the head of global foreign-exchange strategy, said in a
phone interview yesterday. “The Bank of England will make it
clear pretty soon that it is focusing on the output gap.”  Ten-year yields  rose two basis points, or 0.02 percentage
point, to 2.70 percent, after climbing to 2.71 percent
yesterday. The 1.75 percent bond due in September 2022 dropped
0.135, or 1.35 pounds per 1,000-pound face amount, to 92.39.  Gilts lost investors 4.6 percent this year through
yesterday, according to Bloomberg World Bond Indexes show.
German securities dropped 2.4 percent and Treasuries declined
3.4 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
