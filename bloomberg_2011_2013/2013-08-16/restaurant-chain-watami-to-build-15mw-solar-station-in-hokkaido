Watami Co. (7522) , a Japanese restaurant
chain, will build a 15 megawatt solar station on the northern
island of Hokkaido with Community Wind Power Co.  Construction of the 4.5 billion yen ($46 million) plant
will start in October and is expected to be completed by the end
of November 2014, Watami said in an e-mail response to
questions. The Nikkei newspaper reported the news earlier today.  This will be the first utility-scale solar station for
Watami, which has developed wind power stations in northern
 Japan  with Community Wind Power, the Tokyo-based restaurateur
said in the e-mail.  Community Wind Power , based in Hokkaido, develops wind
projects and provides operation and maintenance services.  To contact the reporter on this story:
