Swire Pacific Ltd. (19) , the Hong Kong
trading house with interests spanning real estate, aviation and
marine services, named John Slosar as chairman, replacing
Christopher Pratt, who is retiring.  Slosar, 57, the former chief executive officer of Swire
unit Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd., will start as chairman of both
Swire Pacific and  Swire Properties Ltd. (1972)  in March next year.
Pratt, 57, is stepping down after working at the group for 35
years, according to a statement today.  Slosar became chief executive of Cathay, Asia’s biggest
international carrier, in March 2011. Under his tenure, Cathay
cut capacity and phased out some planes to revive earnings.  Swire Pacific’s property unit yesterday reported first-half
profit that missed analysts’ estimates as retail rents slowed
and home sales trailed. Swire Properties is grappling with the
first annual decline in retail rents in  Hong Kong  since 2008.  To contact the reporter on this story:
