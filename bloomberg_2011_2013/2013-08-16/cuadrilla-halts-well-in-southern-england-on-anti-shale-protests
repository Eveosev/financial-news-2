Cuadrilla Resources Ltd., a U.K. oil
and gas explorer, suspended drilling at Balcombe in southern
 England  in the face of an anti-shale protest camp.  “After taking advice from Sussex Police, Cuadrilla is
temporarily scaling back drilling operations ahead of the
event,” the Lichfield, England-based company said today in an
e-mailed statement. “We plan to resume full operations as soon
as it is safe to do so.”  Campaign group No Dash for Gas have threatened direct
action during a protest campaign planned from today until Aug.
21, Cuadrilla said.  Local residents and environmental campaigners have opposed
drilling plans by Cuadrilla, citing concerns that the operation
will contaminate water, cause noise and increase traffic. In
July, protesters blocked the site, forcing Cuadrilla to delay
the start of exploratory work.  The company, backed by Riverstone Holdings LLC and  AJ Lucas
Group Ltd. (AJL) , plans a conventional oil well at Balcombe, it said.
No hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, will take place at this
stage, it has said. Any plans for such a process, which blasts
sand, water and chemicals at high pressure into underground rock
to release fuel, will be subject to a rigorous regulatory
permitting process, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
