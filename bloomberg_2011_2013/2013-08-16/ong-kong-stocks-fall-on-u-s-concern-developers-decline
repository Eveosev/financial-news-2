Hong Kong  stocks  fell, with the
benchmark index paring this week’s gains, as Chinese developers
extended their decline and after U.S. jobs data fueled concern
the  Federal Reserve  will reduce stimulus.  The  Hang Seng Index  fell 0.7 percent to 22,375.70 as of
9:34 a.m. in Hong Kong, with only two stocks gaining on the 50-member gauge. Still, the index is headed for a 2.6 percent gain
for the week, the best performance among developed markets. The
 Hang Seng China Enterprises Index (HSCEI)  fell 1.1 percent to 10,099.03.  The Hang Seng Index retreated 0.5 percent this year through
yesterday, the only decline among developed markets tracked by
Bloomberg. The gauge traded at 10.76 times estimated earnings
yesterday, compared with 15.06 for the Standard & Poor’s 500
Index.  The Hang Seng China Enterprises Index, also known as the H-share index, fell 27 percent from a Feb. 1 high through June 25,
meeting some investors’ definition of a  bear market . The index
traded at 1.23 times book value yesterday, compared with a five-year average of 1.76.  Futures on the  S&P 500  gained 0.1 percent today. The equity
gauge lost 1.4 percent in New York yesterday as forecasts from
Cisco Systems Inc. and Wal-Mart Stores Inc. disappointed while
improving economic data pushed bond yields higher amid concern
the Federal Reserve will reduce stimulus.  U.S. housing starts and  consumer confidence  data today may
stoke speculation the Fed is set to cut stimulus next month,
concerns fanned by an unexpected drop in U.S. jobless claims to
a six-year low last week.  Materials and energy companies led declines this year on
the Hang Seng Composite Index amid concern weaker expansion in
China will sap demand. Utility and information-technology shares
were the biggest gainers.  Hang Seng Index (HSI)  futures slid 0.8 percent to 22,374. The HSI
Volatility Index rose 1.6 percent to 16.66, indicating traders
expect the equity benchmark to swing 2.8 percent in the next 30
days.  To contact the reporter on this story:
