Light Louisiana Sweet weakened to a
one-month low against West Texas Intermediate as shipping
capacity to the U.S. Gulf Coast increased, giving refiners more
options for acquiring crude.  The premium for LLS, which reached $23 a barrel in
February, has dropped below $5 as new pipelines and rail
capacity have reduced inventories at Cushing, Oklahoma, the
delivery point for futures on the  New York Mercantile Exchange .
 Brent crude  has also fallen against WTI this year.  “With greater amounts of oil coming in now from the
Permian and of course trying to make its way down from the mid-continent, both LLS and Brent are going to have to tread lower
as competition,” said  Stephen Schork , the president of Schork
Group Inc. in Villanova, Pennsylvania, by phone today.  LLS dropped 40 cents a barrel to a premium of $4.75 to WTI
at 3:30 p.m. in New York, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The spread was the lowest since July 10.  Most other Gulf Coast oils weakened against WTI. Heavy
Louisiana Sweet’s premium narrowed 25 cents to $4.50 a barrel.
Southern Green Canyon’s discount widened by 20 cents to $2.  Mars Blend’s discount narrowed 40 cents to 5 cents.
Poseidon’s discount narrowed 50 cents to 50 cents. The premium
for  Thunder Horse , which has a lower sulfur content than Mars,
Poseidon and Southern Green Canyon, gained 40 cents to $2.50.  To contact the reporter on this story:
