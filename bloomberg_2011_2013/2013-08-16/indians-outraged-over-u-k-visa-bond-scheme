In  a move  that seems to combine inefficacious policy, obtuse public relations and moral tastelessness, the U.K.'s Conservative-led government in June announced  plans  to roll out a pilot scheme that will require visitors from " high-risk " countries to put down a steep 3,000 pound ($4,690) deposit before they are allowed to enter the country.  The so-called " visa bond " scheme apparently may be inaugurated this November and initially apply only to selected visa-seekers from six countries, most prominent among them India. (The others are Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, Nigeria and Ghana.) The announcement by the U.K. Home Office wasn't exactly what India was anticipating after the U.K. Prime Minister David Cameron  declared  in February, "I think Britain and India can be one of the great partnerships of the 21st Century."  Both members of  the Indian government  and  prominent business federations  have  suggested  the decision is discriminatory and unfair. (The U.K. has tried to highlight the  un-finalized ,  trial  nature of the plan.) But if the scheme is not reconsidered, it will certainly affect Indian tourist and business links with U.K. Some voices in India, such as Kishan Rana, a  former ambassador to Germany , have called for a reciprocal scheme to be imposed on British tourists. The controversial scheme  seeks  to deter asylum-seekers who enter the country on tourist visas and stay on illegally; it would initially apply only to visitors entering the country on a six-month visa. In the 2010 elections, the Conservative Party promised to dramatically lower immigration to the U.K. to the " tens of thousands " of people per year. (Net migration  was more  than 200,000 in 2011.) The British High Commission in New Delhi has tried to calm ruffled tempers, declaring in June: There's nothing discriminatory about a government studying what data it has on illegal immigration and deciding that visa applicants from some countries are more liable than others to transgress rules. But there is something both morally and financially perverse about believing that the policy response to such concerns can lie in a visa bond (even if the U.K. Home Office wants to hide behind the phrase "pilot scheme"). First, it would be an exceedingly unpleasant way for an Indian national -- or a citizen of one of the other countries to which the new scheme would apply -- to enter the U.K. if such a journey were accompanied by the knowledge that one had been labeled a potential illegal immigrant. Every person picked out by the proposed scheme would in effect be presumed guilty until he proved his innocence at the exit gates of Heathrow or Birmingham. Second, the sort of visa applicant most likely to be labeled high-risk would be precisely the sort of person unlikely to have 3,000 pounds -- at today's exchange rates about 290,000 rupees, or more than  four times  the yearly per capita income in India -- in spare cash to give up to the British government for permission to enter the country. In effect, the U.K. Border Agency would be saying to a certain kind of applicant, "Look, we're letting you in -- it's you who doesn't have the money." Last, the scheme doesn't seem a very good idea even as a strategy to contain illegal immigration. As two journalists argued  in the Guardian  in June:  In India's Business Standard in July, the former diplomat Kishan Rana  took a few steps  back from the controversy to think about two kinds of people in the world, those who have to worry continually about visas and those who don't: Rana calls in his piece for India to impose a reciprocal system on U.K. visa-seekers. But it might be too late for that. After all, India has over the last three centuries let in thousands of high-risk British visitors likely to destabilize the Indian economy. And they did more than just get an illegal job somewhere in the new country as a cab driver or a restaurant employee. They were the agents in the 18th and 19th centuries of  the East India Company , and then of the British Raj, and the economic system they put into place  drained colonial India  of vast amounts of wealth and  helped build modern Britain . The ravening predations of colonialism, only a few generations past, provide an ironic frame for current immigration debates in the U.K., especially when the solution to check illegal immigration is visa bonds targeted at citizens of its former colonies.
