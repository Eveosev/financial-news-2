Philadelphia Flyers captain  Claude Giroux  will miss 5-6 weeks after undergoing surgery following a
golf club accident, the National Hockey League team said.  Giroux, who led the Flyers in scoring last season with 13
goals and 35 assists, was golfing in Ottawa yesterday when his
club shattered and splintered into his right index finger.  The team didn’t say what caused his club to shatter.  “Although there were no broken bones, there was some
damage to his extensor tendons in his finger,” Flyers General
Manager Paul Holmgren said in a statement on the team’s website.  The Flyers signed Giroux, 25, to an eight-year, $66 million
contract extension in July.  To contact the reporter on this story:
