Anite Plc (AIE)  fell the most in five
months after the software supplier for the wireless and travel
industries reported that trading has been restrained, even as
its CEO said the pipeline of opportunities has expanded.  The stock declined 6.9 percent, the biggest drop since
March 11, to 117 pence in London. It was the biggest fall on the
 FTSE All-Share-Index (ASX)  today and took Anite’s decline to 18
percent this year. Trading volume was more than seven times the
three-month daily average.  Trading in the first fiscal quarter ended Aug. 15 was
“relatively quiet,” the Slough, England-based company said in
a statement today. After a slow start to the year for the
handset testing business, that unit’s first-half sales will
probably be similar to those of last year. Anite said full-year
expectations are unchanged and there will be a greater weighting
on second-half performance compared with the previous 12 months.  “This is the nature of the business, it tends to be a
little bit lumpy,” Chief Executive Officer Christopher Humphrey
said in a phone interview. “The underlying growth drivers for
the handset business remain very strong.”  The pipeline of opportunities has “significantly”
increased on last year, Humphrey said.  Of analysts who share their research with Bloomberg, 10
recommend buying the stock and one advocates holding. Three
analysts reiterated buy ratings and their price predictions
today. Analysts’ average target price of 168.70 pence implies
that the stock may rise more than 40 percent.  To contact the reporter for this story:
