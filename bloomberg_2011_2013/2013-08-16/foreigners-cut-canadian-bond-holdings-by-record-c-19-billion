Foreign holdings of Canadian bonds
fell by a record in June as investors retained the proceeds of
maturing government debt.  The C$19 billion ($18.4 billion) decline in bonds was led
by a C$10.6 billion drop in government-issued debt and another
C$8.83 billion reduction in government-owned company bonds,
 Statistics Canada  said today from Ottawa.  The drop “occurred against the backdrop of a sharp decline
in the overall supply of these instruments over the month,” the
agency’s report said.  Investors also added C$3.22 billion of stocks in June and
C$387 million of money-market paper, narrowing the decline in
foreign holdings of Canadian securities to C$15.4 billion, the
largest since October 2007.  The drop contrasted with a Bloomberg survey of four
economists that had a median estimate of C$7.25 billion in net
purchases.  Canadians  bought  C$3.69 billion of foreign securities in
June, according to today’s report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
