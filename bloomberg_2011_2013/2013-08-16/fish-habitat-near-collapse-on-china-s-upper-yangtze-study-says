The fish habitat in the upper
reaches of the  Yangtze River  is near collapse from overfishing
and the construction of hydropower dams, and  China  should ban
fishing on the river for 10 years, according to a new study.  Twenty-five hydropower plants are planned for the Jinsha
River, which will make the tributary to the Yangtze a series of
reservoirs and disrupt the flow of sediment, the  World Wildlife
Fund  and the Yangtze River Fishery Resources Committee said in a
report released yesterday.  “Because the habitat has been broken and lost, the natural
resources of the fish in the Jinsha river are already on the
edge of collapse,” Zhao Yimin, head of the Yangtze fishery
committee, said in the report.  China should monitor hydropower projects on the upper
reaches of the Yangtze and evaluate small scale hydro
operations, the study said. President  Xi Jinping  has vowed not
to sacrifice the environment to economic growth following 30
years of expansion that has tainted the country’s air and water,
and spurred a rising number of protests over pollution.  The study involved 32 experts and took 12 days, with
research on the Tongtian, Jinsha and Chishui rivers.  “In order to repair the serious degradation of fishery
resources, there should quickly be implemented a 10-year ban on
fishing on the whole Yangtze River,” Ren Wenwei, director of
WWF’s Shanghai office said, according to the statement.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
