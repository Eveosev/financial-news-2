Coffee deliveries from farms in
 Indonesia , the world’s third-biggest robusta grower, jumped this
week as activity returned after the Muslim holiday of Eid,
according to Volcafe, a unit of commodities trader ED&F Man
Holdings Ltd.  Bean arrivals were about 13,000 to 14,000 metric tons this
week, the Winterthur, Switzerland-based trader said in a report
e-mailed today. That compares with 2,500 to 3,000 tons a week
earlier. Indonesia is harvesting its 2013-14 crop that started
in April and production will fall 12 percent to 9.2 million
bags, the  U.S. Department of Agriculture  estimates. A bag of
coffee weighs 132 pounds. Eid is the festival that marks the end
of the fasting month of Ramadan.  “Local activities slowly restarted after the Ramadan
celebrations,” Volcafe said. The local industry is “actively
buying again,” with prices at 19,250 rupiah ($1.85) a kilogram
(2.2 pounds) to 20,500 rupiah a kilogram.  Buyers of coffee from Indonesia for shipment in September
and October were paying a premium of $120 a ton over the futures
on the NYSE Liffe exchange in London, according to Volcafe. That
compares with $110 a ton last week.  Indonesia’s coffee shipments climbed 74 percent to 194,781
tons in the January to July period, Volcafe said. Exports in
July amounted to 48,525 tons, compared with 39,832 tons a year
earlier.  In  Vietnam , the world’s leading robusta producer, local
prices are still “expensive” and farmers are holding back
beans before the start of the 2013-14 season, according to the
report.  Premium  Vietnamese beans for shipment in September and October were
at a premium, or differential, of $90 a ton to the exchange
price, data from the trader showed. That’s unchanged from last
week. Differentials refer to a discount or a premium paid to
obtain physical coffee in relation to futures prices.  “Everyone is watching and waiting for the new crop,
expecting differentials to weaken further to negative levels
versus Liffe,” Volcafe said. “Although there is decent
interest for new crop, levels are still too far apart.”  Robusta coffee for delivery in November was 0.8 percent
lower at $1,902 a ton by 3:17 p.m. in  London .  To contact the reporter on this story:
