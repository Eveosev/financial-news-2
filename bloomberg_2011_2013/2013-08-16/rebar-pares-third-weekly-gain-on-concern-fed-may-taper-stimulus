Steel reinforcement-bar futures
fell, paring a third weekly gain, on speculation that the
 Federal Reserve  scaling back stimulus may slow global growth.  Rebar for January delivery fell as much as 0.5 percent to
3,802  yuan  ($622) a metric ton on Shanghai Futures Exchange, and
traded 3,808 yuan at 11:13 a.m. local time. Futures have risen
1.4 percent this week, trimming this year’s drop to 4.5 percent.  Asian stocks  fell for a second day as improving U.S.
economic data increased concern that the Federal Reserve will
reduce its monetary easing. A report yesterday showed claims for
jobless benefits unexpectedly dropped last week to the lowest
level in almost six years. Fed Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  may
reduce the central bank’s monthly bond purchases next month, 65
percent of economists surveyed by Bloomberg predict.  “The stronger-than-expected economic data increased
investors’ concerns,” said Wang Yongliang, an analyst at
Beijing CIFCO Futures Co. in Tianjin. “Rebar will trade
sideways in the near future as the rally has come too fast.”  The average  spot price  for rebar rose 0.2 percent to 3,566
yuan a ton yesterday, the highest since May, according to
Beijing Antaike Information Development Co.  Iron ore  for
immediate delivery at Tianjin port fell 1.1 percent to $141.20 a
dry ton yesterday, according to a  price index  compiled by The
Steel Index Ltd.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
