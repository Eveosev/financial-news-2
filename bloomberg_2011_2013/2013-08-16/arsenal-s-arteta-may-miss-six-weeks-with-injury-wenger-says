Arsenal midfielder Mikel Arteta may
be sidelined for an extended period of time because of a thigh
injury, manager  Arsene Wenger  said.  Arteta was hurt in training and the full extent of the
injury hasn’t been determined. Wenger said he may be without the
Spaniard for up to six weeks.  “It could be as long, but honestly we don’t know yet,” he
told a news conference ahead of tomorrow’s Premier League season
opener against  Aston Villa . “We have to check the severity with
the doctor. I haven’t talked to the doctor.”  Arsenal has yet to buy a player this offseason, with Yaya
Sanogo moving to the London club on a free transfer from Auxerre
in France. The Gunners failed to sign Real Madrid striker
Gonzalo Higuain, who went to Napoli, and have two bids rejected
for Liverpool striker  Luis Suarez .  Arsenal was also linked with Bayern Munich’s Luiz Gustavo,
who plays the same defensive midfield role as Arteta, but the
Brazilian today joined German club Wolfsburg.  “I don’t disagree that we are a bit light at the moment,”
Wenger said. “There are 18 days to go until the end of the
transfer market and we are of course looking to strengthen our
squad.”  The soccer transfer period ends Sept. 2.  To contact the reporter on this story:
