Italian lenders climbed in Milan,
leading gains in the European Stoxx 600 Banks Index, after
 Italy ’s 10-year yield premium over benchmark German bunds shrunk
to the lowest in two years.  Intesa Sanpaolo SpA (ISP) , Italy’s second-biggest bank,  rose  3
percent to 1.55 euros at 1:03 p.m., giving the bank a market
value of 25 billion euros ($33 billion).  UniCredit SpA (UCG) , the
largest lender, increased 1.4 percent to 4.77 euros. The FTSE
Italia All-Share Banks Index gained 1.5 percent.  Italian banks, which invested part of the liquidity
obtained at lower  interest rates  by the  European Central Bank  in
 government bonds , are the biggest holders of Italian sovereign
debt. Intesa owns about 100 billion euros in government bonds,
while Banca Monte dei Paschi di Siena, Italy’s third-biggest
bank, holds 29 billion euros, more than three times its tangible
capital.  Italy’s 10-year  yield  fell 3 basis points to 4.22 percent,
while benchmark German rates yielded 1.87 percent, narrowing the
difference to 235 basis points, the least since July 2011.  To contact the reporter on this story:
