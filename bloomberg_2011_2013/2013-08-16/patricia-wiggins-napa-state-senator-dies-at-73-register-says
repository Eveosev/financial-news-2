Patricia Wiggins, a former
California state senator who represented Napa County from 2006
to 2010 and was an advocate for winegrowers in the region, died
yesterday in  Santa Rosa  after a long illness, the Napa Valley
Register said, citing her family.  Wiggins was instrumental in securing a name protection
law for Napa Valley wines and also backed legislation
permitting taxes which allowed winegrowers to build housing for
farmworkers, the Register cited Linda Reiff, executive director
of Napa Valley Vintners, as saying. Sandy Elles, executive
director of the Napa County Farm Bureau, was cited as saying
Wiggins led the fight on local and state level for sustainable
approaches to land use, according the Registerâ€™s website.  Click here for web link  To contact the reporter on this story:
