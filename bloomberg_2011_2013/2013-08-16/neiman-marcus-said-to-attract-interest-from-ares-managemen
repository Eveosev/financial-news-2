Neiman Marcus  Inc., the upscale
retailer said to be considering takeover offers, has attracted
interest from Los Angeles private-equity firm Ares Management
LLC, according to people familiar with the process.  Ares is working with a Canadian pension fund, said one of
the people, who asked not to be named because the process is
private. Neiman owners TPG Capital and Warburg Pincus LLC,
weighing a sale of the chain against a possible initial public
offering, will decide on an option within about six weeks,
according to the people.  If the owners fail to draw a bid that meets their
expectations by then, they probably will proceed with an IPO,
the people said. The retailer also has fielded approaches from
potential suitors such as CVC Capital Partners Ltd. and KKR &
Co., people familiar with the process said last week.  The company, which operates stores under the Neiman and
Bergdorf Goodman banners, filed for an offering in June.
Representatives at Neiman, Ares, TPG, Warburg, CVC and KKR
declined to comment.  Neiman Marcusâ€™s owners, which are working with Credit
Suisse Group AG on the IPO, were seeking as much as $8 billion
in a sale, two people familiar with the matter said in May. TPG
and Warburg paid about $5.1 billion for the Dallas-based
retailer in 2005.  To contact the reporters on this story:
