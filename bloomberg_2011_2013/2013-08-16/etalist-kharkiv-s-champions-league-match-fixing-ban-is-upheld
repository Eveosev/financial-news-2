Sport’s top court dismissed a
request from Metalist Kharkiv for a stay of the Ukrainian
soccer’s club  Champions League  disqualification.  European soccer governing body UEFA two days ago banned
Metalist from this season’s Champions League for its link to a
match-fixing case. The club made an “urgent request” for a
stay to the Switzerland-based Court of Arbitration for Sport,
which today turned it down.  “After having considered the parties’ submissions, the
Deputy President of the Appeals Arbitration Division decided to
dismiss FC Metalist’s request,” the  CAS said  in a statement on
its website. “Consequently, the UEFA decision remains in force,
which means that FC Metalist Kharkiv is excluded from the
2013/2014 UEFA competitions.”  UEFA said on its  website  it “welcomed” the CAS decision.  Metalist was to play  Germany ’s Schalke in the Champions
League playoffs beginning next week. UEFA said its place will be
taken by PAOK of  Greece , which lost to Metalist in the previous
round.  UEFA imposed the ban after opening proceedings last week
following the CAS’s upholding of the Ukrainian soccer
federation’s five-year suspension of Metalist sports director
Yevhen Krasnikov for match-fixing in 2008.  Metalist was one of two teams in the playoffs facing
possible sanction over match-rigging allegations. Turkish club
Fenerbahce’s meeting with Arsenal of English Premier League is
subject to a CAS ruling over a UEFA ban handed down last month.
CAS is expected to rule on the Turkish club’s appeal after the
playoffs begin Aug. 20.  To contact the reporter on this story:
