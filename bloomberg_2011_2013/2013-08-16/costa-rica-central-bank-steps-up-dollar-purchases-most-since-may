Costa Rica ’s central bank is buying
dollars at the fastest pace in three months after foreign
companies brought in cash to pay workers, not because of a
return of speculative capital to the country, according to
brokerage Aldesa Puesto de Bolsa.  Costa Rica’s central bank bought $41.5 million this week
through yesterday, the most since May 17. Dollar purchases have
exceeded $750 million this year as policy makers try to rein in
the colon, which has led Latin American and Caribbean currencies
with a 2 percent gain against the dollar this year.  President Laura Chinchilla, who called speculative capital
a “weapon of mass destruction,” backed legislation Congress
has yet to take up that would raise  reserve requirements  on
foreign investors and boost taxes on interest paid to them to
dissuade some inflows. This week’s rise in dollar purchases is
probably not related to speculative capital but wage payments,
said Adriana Rodriguez, head of investment strategy at Aldesa.  “The national  interest rates  remain very low, so it
doesn’t make much sense that this is a return of speculative
capital when there are larger returns available in other
emerging market countries,” Rodriguez said in an interview.  Costa Rica’s  basic interest rate  fell to 6.55 percent this
month from 9.2 percent at the start of the year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
