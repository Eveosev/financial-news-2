Treasury  10-year yields  rose the
most in a week since the beginning of July as investors bet the
 Federal Reserve  may reduce its debt-purchase program next month
as the economic recovery strengthens.  The  difference  between yields on five- and 10-year notes
widened to almost the most in two years, suggesting investors
are betting faster growth will lead to higher long-term
borrowing rates. Hedge-fund managers and other large speculators
increased wagers that 10-year note will drop to the most in more
than a year.  “We’ve got a lot of turbulence,” said  Brian Edmonds , the
head of interest-rates trading in New York at  Cantor Fitzgerald ,
one of 21 primary dealers that trade with the Fed. “You’ve got
to respect the fact that there’s not a whole lot of willing
buyers in Treasury land.”  U.S. 10-year note yields rose six basis points, or 0.06
percentage point, to 2.83 percent as of 5 p.m. in New York,
according to Bloomberg Bond Trader data. The price of the 2.5
percent note maturing in August 2023 fell 16/32, or $5 per
$1,000 face value, to 97 5/32.  The yield touched 2.86 percent, the highest since July
2011. It has increased 25 basis points  this week , the most since
the period ended July 5.  The  Bloomberg Global Developed Sovereign Bond Index (BGSV)  has
fallen 5 percent this year, while yields were at the highest in
at least a month for 17 of 24 developed markets tracked by
Bloomberg.  Yields Climb  Hedge-fund managers and other large speculators increased
their  net-short position  in 10-year note futures in the week
ending Aug. 13 to the most since July 2012, according to U.S.
Commodity Futures Trading Commission data.  Speculative short positions, or bets prices will fall,
outnumbered long positions by 66,432 contracts on the Chicago
Board of Trade, the most since the week ending July 6, 2012.
Net-short positions rose by 46,336 contracts, or 231 percent,
from a week earlier, the Washington-based commission said in its
Commitments of Traders report.  The Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan index of
consumer sentiment dropped from a six-year high amid rising
interest rates. The index this month fell to 80 from 85.1 in
July. The forecast was for little change at 85.2, according to
the median projection of 68 economists in a Bloomberg News
survey.  “The numbers are a little bit on the weak side, but not
enough to change the mentality of the market right now,” said
Jason Rogan, director of U.S. government trading at Guggenheim
Partners LLC, a New York-based brokerage for institutional
investors. “For right now the market has made up its mind in
going to higher yields.”  The  difference  between yields on five- and 10-year notes
increased to 1.25 percentage points, close to the widest since
August 2011. The gap reached 1.27 percentage points on Aug. 6.  Rate Outlook  “A lot of people expect the Fed to taper in September;
it’s probably the right thing for the Fed to do,” said  Drew Matus , deputy U.S. chief economist at UBS Securities, one of 21
primary dealers that trade with the central bank. “In the long
run, the Fed acknowledging the economy is strong enough to
survive without continued rounds of easing should be considered
net positive as we move ahead.”  Sixty-five percent of economists in a Bloomberg survey
conducted Aug. 9-13 said the Fed will trim its $85 billion of
monthly bond purchases at the next scheduled meeting Sept. 17-18. In a survey last month, half of respondents predicted a
September reduction.  Investors see a 50 percent chance policy makers will raise
the so-called federal funds rate to 0.5 percent or more by
January 2015, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  The Fed has kept its  target  for overnight lending between
banks in a range of zero to 0.25 percent since 2008.  Inflation Data  The U.S. is scheduled to sell $16 billion in five-year
Treasury inflation protected securities on Aug. 22. The last
sale of the securities in April was for $18 billion.  Fed policy makers have warned of the risks of prolonged
inflation below their 2 percent target even amid unprecedented
stimulus. The cost of living in the U.S. rose in July for a
third month, supporting the Fed’s forecast that inflation will
move closer to its target, based on Labor Department data
yesterday.  Consumer prices increased 2 percent in the 12 months ended
in July after a 1.8 percent year-over-year gain the prior month.  Housing starts  climbed 5.9 percent to an 896,000 annualized
rate from a revised 846,000 pace in June that was higher than
previously reported, figures from the Commerce Department
showed. The median estimate of 82 economists surveyed by
Bloomberg was for a 900,000 rate. Multifamily construction
surged 26 percent, while work began on 2.2 percent fewer single-family homes.  To contact the reporter on this story:
