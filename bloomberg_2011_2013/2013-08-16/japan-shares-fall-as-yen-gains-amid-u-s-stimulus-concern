Japanese  shares  fell amid low
volume, with the Topix index paring this week’s advance, as
improving U.S. economic data fueled concern the  Federal Reserve 
will cut stimulus next month.  J. Front Retailing Co. sank 2.7 percent after reporting a
decline in department-store sales. Oil refiner  Showa Shell
Sekiyu K.K. (5002)  slipped 2.2 percent after Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan
Stanley Securities Co. cut its rating on the stock.  Tokyo 
Tatemono Co. climbed the most on the  Nikkei 225  Stock Average
after a report the developer may boost operating profit by 10
billion yen ($102 million) next fiscal year.  The Topix lost 0.8 percent to 1,142.65 at the close in
Tokyo, trimming its weekly advance to 0.2 percent. Volume was 26
percent below the 30-day average. The gauge slid for a second
day after officials yesterday denied a report the government was
mulling cutting corporate taxes. The Nikkei 225 slipped 0.8
percent to 13,650.11, paring its weekly gain to 0.3 percent.  “Investors have lost confidence corporate earnings will be
able to withstand tapering in the U.S.,” said  Ayako Sera , a
Tokyo-based market strategist at Sumitomo Mitsui Trust Bank
Ltd., which has the equivalent of $360 billion in assets. “The
only way to break the risk-off, stronger-yen, weaker-stocks
spiral is to gain confidence in earnings. The Japanese
government comments denying a cut in corporate taxes pulled the
rug out from under the markets. They’re doing badly in
communicating.”  Japanese shares dropped for a second day after officials
including Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga said yesterday
Prime Minister Shinzo Abe hasn’t given instructions on lowering
the rate on companies. The Nikkei newspaper reported on Aug. 13
that Abe had called for a study on cutting the levy as a
counterweight to raising the  sales tax , citing unidentified
people in the government. The  Topix (TPX)  rallied 2 percent that day.  Thin Trading  Daily trading volume  on the Topix fell to the lowest this
year on Aug. 12 and remained near that level throughout the week
as investors take summer vacations. About 1.9 billion shares
were traded today, below the 3.5 billion average for this year.
The measure’s 30-day  historic volatility  was at 26.25 today,
compared with its five-year median of 19.42.  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index climbed 0.2
percent today. The gauge fell the most since June yesterday as
forecasts from Cisco Systems Inc. and Wal-Mart Stores Inc.
disappointed while improving economic data pushed bond yields
higher amid concern the Fed will reduce stimulus.  Reports yesterday showed claims for jobless benefits
unexpectedly dropped last week to the lowest level in almost six
years, signaling the U.S. job market continues to mend. The Fed
will probably reduce its $85 billion in monthly bond purchases
at its meeting on Sept. 17-18, according to 65 percent of
economists surveyed by Bloomberg from Aug. 9 to Aug. 13.  Tapering Concern  “Some investors are concerned the Fed’s cut in bond
purchases could be bigger than expected,” said Nobuhiko Kuramochi, a deputy general manager at Mizuho Securities Co.  All but three of the 33 Topix industry groups  declined
today , with paper makers and insurers falling the most on the
index, and banking and communications shares providing the
biggest drag. Miners, brokerages and service companies were the
only groups to advance.  Among shares that fell, J. Front Retailing dropped 2.7
percent to 724 yen, closing at its lowest level since June 18.
Sales at its department stores fell 3.1 percent from a year
earlier in July, the company said yesterday.  Showa Shell Sekiyu K.K. lost 2.2 percent to 928 yen. The
oil refiner was cut to neutral from outperform by Mitsubishi UFJ
Morgan Stanley yesterday, following downgrades by Daiwa
Securities Group Inc. and Citigroup Inc. earlier this week. The
company’s share price has almost doubled this year.  Kubota Slides  Kubota Corp., the world’s No. 2 agricultural-machinery
maker by market value, slumped for a second day. The tractor
maker fell 3 percent to 1,430 yen after larger rival Deere & Co.
forecast a decline in U.S. farm revenue. Kubota, which  gets  23
percent of sales from  North America , sank 3.2 percent yesterday
after Deere said U.S. farm cash receipts will drop to $389.8
billion in 2013 and $379.7 billion next year from a record
$402.1 billion last year.  Among stocks that rose,  Tokyo Tatemono (8804)  advanced 2.7 percent
to 846 yen. The developer may see an additional 10 billion yen
in operating profit in the year ending December 2014 as it adds
the results of its special-purpose companies to its consolidated
earnings, the Nikkei newspaper reported.  The Topix traded at 1.13 times  book value  today, compared
with 2.44 for the S&P 500 and 1.72 for the Stoxx Europe 600
Index yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
