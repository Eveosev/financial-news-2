Commonwealth Bank of Australia 
priced the nation’s largest offering of mortgage-backed bonds
since the global financial crisis as investors seek short-dated
assets to protect against interest-rate rises.  Australia ’s largest bank issued A$3.2 billion ($2.9
billion) of notes, the biggest sale of debt backed by home loans
since 2007, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. CBA priced
its A$2.011 billion top tranche at 80 basis points more than
swaps, equaling the tightest spread on such securities with a
similar maturity since the crisis, the data show.  Analysts forecast Australian interest rates will fall to
2.25 percent next year before rising to 2.75 percent by the end
of the first quarter of 2015, according to a Bloomberg News
survey this month, while the U.S. Federal Reserve signaled it
could slow bond purchases later this year. Offerings of notes
backed by residential mortgages surged to A$16.7 billion since
Dec. 31, 25 percent more than issuance in the whole of 2012,
data compiled by Bloomberg show.  “In an interest-rate increasing environment RMBS is the
place to be,” said Mat McCrum, a Melbourne-based investment
director at Omega Global Investors Pty which has A$3.2 billion
under management. “The interest rate profile is very good for
the yield and risk as RMBS pays down very quickly at the short
end of the structure.”  CBA’s largest portion of notes has a 2.5-year weighted
average life, Bloomberg-compiled data show. The borrower also
priced a A$525 million class of RMBS that has a 3.5-year average
life at 90 basis points more than swaps and A$400 million of
notes with a 4.5 percent coupon, the data show.  The company issued a further A$264 million of securities on
which pricing was not disclosed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
