QTS Realty Trust Inc., an owner and
operator of data centers serving businesses and government
agencies, is seeking $300 million in a U.S. initial public
offering.  The company didnâ€™t say how many shares it will offer or at
what price in a regulatory filing today. The offering size is a
placeholder amount used to calculate registration fees and may
change. The  Overland Park , Kansas-based company plans to
organize as a real estate investment trust, it said.  QTS Realty Trust operates 10 data centers across seven
states and may be at least the second such company to sell
shares publicly as a REIT this year, data compiled by Bloomberg
show.  CyrusOne Inc. (CONE) , a Carrollton, Texas-based data-center REIT,
raised $361 million in a January IPO including an over-allotment. The shares had declined 3.2 percent through
yesterday.  QTS Realty Trust had an estimated $7.1 million of net
income in the six months through June 30 on revenue of $84.4
million.  General Atlantic LLC, the Greenwich, Connecticut-based
investment firm, plans to sell shares in the offering, the
filing shows. The firm  invested  $150 million in the company in
2009.  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Jefferies Group LLC are
leading the offering. QTS Realty Trust plans to apply for a
listing on the  New York  Stock Exchange under the symbol QTS.  To contact the reporter on this story:
