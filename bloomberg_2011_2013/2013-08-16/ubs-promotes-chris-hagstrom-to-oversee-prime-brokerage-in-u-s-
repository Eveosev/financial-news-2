UBS AG (UBSN) , Switzerlandâ€™s largest bank,
named Chris Hagstrom to a newly created role as head of prime
brokerage for the U.S., overseeing services for hedge funds.  Hagstrom previously led U.S. prime brokerage sales, Megan Stinson, a spokeswoman for Zurich-based UBS, said today in an e-mailed statement. The move was reported earlier by HFMWeek, a
trade publication.  UBS named Reinhardt Olsen global head of prime brokerage in
June, according to a  report  in Hedge Fund Intelligence. Paul Galietto, the previous head, took over as head of equities for
the Americas this year after Peter Forlenza left to join
Jefferies Group LLC, the newsletter said.  Hagstrom has worked in prime brokerage at UBS for nine
years, according to Stinson. Before that, he worked at SG Cowen
Securities Corp., Financial Industry Regulatory Authority
records show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
