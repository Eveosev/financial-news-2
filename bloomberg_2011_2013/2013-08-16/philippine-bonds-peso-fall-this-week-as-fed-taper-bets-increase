Philippine bonds had their biggest
weekly loss in more than a month and the peso fell as an
improving U.S. economy bolstered speculation the Federal Reserve
will start cutting stimulus.  Initial jobless claims in the U.S. declined to the least in
almost six years, official data showed this week, and 65 percent
of economists surveyed by Bloomberg expect the Fed to reduce $85
billion of monthly bond purchases in September. Philippine
inflation eased to the slowest pace in almost four years in July,
official data show.  “Some players are probably using expectations of tapering
as a reason to push yields higher,” said Roland Avante,
president of Philippine Business Bank in  Manila . “The robust
liquidity in local financial markets and tame inflation suggests
that some of the moves are overdone.”  The yield on the 6.625 percent bonds due August 2017 rose
19 basis points, or 0.19 percentage point, this week to 2.81
percent, according to midday fixing prices at Philippine Dealing
& Exchange Corp. The rate increased 11 basis points today, the
biggest jump since July 9.  The peso fell 0.2 percent this week to 43.665 per dollar at
the close in Manila, according to Tullett Prebon Plc. It rose
0.3 percent today, halting four days of declines. The currency
will probably trade between 43.25 and 43.75 per dollar this
quarter before appreciating to 42.5 by the end of the year as
 remittances  rise during the Christmas holidays, Avante said.  The central bank reported yesterday that funds sent home by
nationals living abroad increased 5.8 percent in June to $1.9
billion, surpassing the 5.6 percent median estimate of
economists in a Bloomberg News survey.  One-month implied volatility, a measure of expected moves
in the exchange rate used to price options, rose 33 basis points
this week to 5.83 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
