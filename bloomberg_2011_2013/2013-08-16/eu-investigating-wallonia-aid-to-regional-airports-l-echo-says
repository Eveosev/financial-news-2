The European Union’s competition
watchdog is investigating aid from  Belgium ’s Wallonia region to
airports in the area as possibly unlawful, L’Echo reported
without saying where it got the information.  The European Commission, which checks whether state aid is
in line with EU competition rules, is seeking details to see
whether the regional government acted as a private investor,
according to the newspaper.  To contact the reporter on this story:
