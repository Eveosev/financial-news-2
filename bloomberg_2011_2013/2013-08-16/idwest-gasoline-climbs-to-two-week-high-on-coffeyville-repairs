U.S. Midwest gasoline strengthened
to the highest level in two weeks after  CVR Energy Inc. (CVI) â€™s
Coffeyville, Kansas, refinery was said to need more time to
carry out fluid catalytic cracker repairs.  Conventional, 87-octane gasoline  in the Group 3 region
gained 3 cents to 3.5 cents a gallon below futures on the  New
York Mercantile Exchange  at 2:34 p.m., the strongest since Aug.
1. Group 3 includes areas from Tulsa, Oklahoma north to  North
Dakota  and Minnesota.  The differential narrowed after a person familiar with
operations at the  Coffeyville refinery  said repairs on an FCC
would take 30 to 40 more days. The unit, which shut in late July
after a failure on the flue gas coolers, was supposed to be
started in the third week of August, according to the company.  The refinery has the capacity to process 120,000 barrels a
day, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Ultra-low-sulfur
diesel fuel in Group 3 gained 0.38 cent to 3.13 cents a gallon
above ULSD futures, the highest level since June 17.  The 3-2-1 crack spread in Group 3, a rough measure of
refining margins for gasoline and diesel fuel based on West
Texas Intermediate in Cushing, Oklahoma, gained 91 cents to
$18.73 a barrel.  To contact the reporter on this story:
