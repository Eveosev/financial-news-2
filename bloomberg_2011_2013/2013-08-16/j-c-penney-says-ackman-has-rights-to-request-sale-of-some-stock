J.C. Penney Co. (JCP)  said it entered into
an agreement with  Bill Ackman  under which its largest investor
may make as many as four requests to the company to register for
the sale of some of his stake.  The rights granted to Ackman under the Aug. 13 agreement
end when he and his funds own less than 5 percent of the
retailer’s stock, according to a regulatory filing today.  Ackman, who agreed this week to leave the company’s board,
holds an almost 18 percent stake in the company.  To contact the reporter on this story:
