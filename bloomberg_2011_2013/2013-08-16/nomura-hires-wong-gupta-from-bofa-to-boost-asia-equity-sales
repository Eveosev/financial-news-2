Nomura Holdings Inc. (8604)  hired Stanley Wong and Ajay Gupta from  Bank of America Corp. ’s Merrill Lynch
unit to boost equities and derivatives business after recruiting
three executives from the U.S. bank since May.  Wong joins  Japan ’s biggest brokerage as head of North  Asia 
equity distribution, said  Rob Stewart , a Hong Kong-based
spokesman. Gupta will join the equity derivatives team by the
end of this month as head of client trading for Asia excluding
Japan, Stewart said, citing an internal memo.  Laurent Poirot and Vincent Yam joined the equity
derivatives team this month from Bank of America, and Jae Lee
started in May as head of equity structuring for Asia excluding
Japan, Stewart said.  Nomura has been overhauling Asia equities operations
outside of Japan after recruiting Yasuhiro Fujiwara, a former
Bank of America veteran, as head of the division earlier this
year. Last September, the Tokyo-based bank said it will wrap
overseas execution services into its independent Instinet unit,
the brokerage it acquired in 2006.  To contact the reporter on this story:
