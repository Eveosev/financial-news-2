Oil and gas  rigs  in the U.S. rose by
13 to 1,791 this week, reaching the highest level this year,
according to  Baker Hughes Inc. (BHI)  The increase was the sixth in
seven weeks.  Oil rigs  rose 12 to 1,397, the Houston-based field services
company said on its website. Gas  rigs  added two to 388.
Miscellaneous rigs fell by one to six.  The total U.S. count is down 123 from a year earlier as
producers use more efficient and mobile equipment to bore
multiple wells off the same drilling pads, cutting rig times and
helping boost domestic crude production to the highest level in
more than 23 years. The surge in output helped the U.S. meet 87
percent of its energy needs in the first four months of 2013, on
pace to be the highest annual rate since 1985.  “We’re finally seeing oil rigs reflect higher prices,”
 James Williams , president of WTRG Economics in  London ,  Arkansas ,
said by telephone. “We should expect continued strength in oil
drilling while gas will probably stay fairly flat.”  U.S. oil output climbed 11,000 barrels a day to 7.57
million, the highest level since December 1989. Stockpiles fell
a second week, losing 2.81 million barrels to 360.5 million, a
seven-month low.  Crude for September delivery declined 76 cents, or 0.7
percent, to $106.57 a barrel today on the Nymex, up 11 percent
in the past year.  Natural gas for September delivery fell 4.9 cents, or 1.4
percent, to $3.37 per million British thermal units on the  New
York Mercantile Exchange , up 24 percent from a year ago.  U.S. gas stockpiles  gained 65 billion cubic feet last week
to 3.006 trillion, bigger than the five-year seasonal average
increase of 42 billion, the Energy Information Administration
said yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
