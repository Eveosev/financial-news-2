A case of 2009 wine from Chateau
Duhart-Milon, a  Bordeaux  fourth-growth wine producer with links
to Chateau Lafite-Rothschild, sold for 700 pounds ($1,100) on
the Liv-ex market in  London , its highest level since May 24.  Yesterday’s transaction was 6 percent above its lowest
level for this month of 658 pounds a case and 17 percent up from
its record low of 600 pounds touched last November, according to
Liv-ex data on its Cellar Watch website. The rally took it back
to the level at which it was trading for most of January.  While the Liv-ex Fine Wine 50 Index of top Bordeaux wines
has risen 3 percent since the start of 2013, gains came mainly
in the first 10 weeks of the year, with prices sliding since
mid-March. A muted response to the Bordeaux 2012 wine futures
sales campaign has focused demand on some other vintages.  Investment flows “have been a key factor in the flat
market seen over the last 12 months, with significant net sales
from investment holders preventing the quite strong underlying
demand from causing prices to increase,” according to a report
from  Chris Smith , investment manager at The Wine Investment Fund
in London. The fund, invested in Bordeaux, manages $50 million.  Duhart-Milon is owned by Domaines Barons de Rothschild
(Lafite), which controls Lafite-Rothschild, and the estates in
Pauillac are neighbors. Duhart-Milon is managed by the same team
as Lafite, led by Charles Chevallier, using the same techniques.  Estate Purchase  The Rothschild family bought Duhart-Milon in 1962, and its
vineyards now cover 76 hectares (188 acres), according to the
producer’s website. Its vines, with an average age of 30 years,
comprise 67 percent Cabernet Sauvignon and 33 percent Merlot.  Duhart-Milon’s 2009 wines are its most expensive since its
2000 vintage, according to merchant data compiled by Liv-ex on
Cellar Watch.  The 2009 wines were awarded a 97 rating on a 100-point
scale by U.S. wine critic  Robert Parker , higher than its
preceding vintages. He described it in a February 2012 online
tasting note as “the most concentrated and broadest example of
this cuvee I have tasted in over three decades.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
