More than 5,000 Syrians crossed into
 Iraq ’s Kurdistan region yesterday in a “sudden, massive
movement,” the  United Nations  refugee agency said.  About 750 people initially crossed the Tigris River at
Peshkhabour crossing, followed by a wave of 5,000 to 7,000
people, Adrian Edwards, spokesman for the UN High Commissioner
for Refugees, told reporters in Geneva today, according to an
agency e-mail summarizing his comments.  Most of the Syrians were women, children and elderly people
from embattled Aleppo and other regions near Syria’s border with
Iraq, Edwards said, citing UN field officers at the scene. UN
officials don’t know what prompted the sudden influx, which
hasn’t been repeated today, he said.  Both the Syrian and Iraqi sides of the crossing are
normally tightly controlled, he said.  More than 1.9 million Syrians have fled from the two-year
civil war, the UN said. Two-thirds of them left this year as
fighting escalated between President Bashar al-Assad’s troops
and an opposition coalition of about 1,200 factions that include
secular moderates and radical Islamists backed by  Iran ,
Lebanon’s Hezbollah militia and al-Qaeda.  The new arrivals are temporarily sheltered at emergency
transit sites, UN tents and reportedly at nearby mosques, as the
refugee agency seeks to open a new refugee camp in the next two
weeks, Edwards said.  The UN agency had estimated that there were 154,000 Syrian
refugees in Iraq before yesterday’s influx.  There are about 684,000 Syrian refugees in Lebanon, 516,000
in  Jordan  and 434,000 in  Turkey , Edwards said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
