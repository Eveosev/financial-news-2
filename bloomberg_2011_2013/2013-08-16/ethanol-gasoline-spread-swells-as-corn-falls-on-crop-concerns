Ethanol fell after an analyst said
corn planting may exceed U.S. estimates. The biofuel’s discount
to gasoline tightened for a third day.  Ethanol slipped as corn tumbled 1.6 percent after
Christopher Narayanan, a  Societe Generale (GLE)  analyst in New York,
said the grain used to make ethanol in the U.S. may be planted
on more than the 88.8 million acres reported by the Agriculture
Department’s Farm Service Agency. The ethanol-gasoline spread
narrowed 0.4 cent to 73.85 cents a gallon.  “Ethanol is really falling along with corn today,” said
Will Babler, a broker in Galena,  Illinois , for Atten Babler Risk
Management LLC. “The market is still looking for direction on
total acres, yield prospects and weather outlooks. There’s a lot
of debate going on about the different factors.”  Denatured ethanol for September delivery slipped 1.3 cents,
or 0.6 percent, to settle at $2.229 a gallon on the  Chicago 
Board of Trade. Futures are up 3.9 percent this week.  Gasoline for September delivery fell 1.7 cents, or 0.6
percent, to $2.9675 a gallon on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange . The contract covers reformulated gasoline, made to be
blended with ethanol before delivery to filling stations.  Corn for September delivery retreated 7.75 cents, or 1.6
percent, to $4.7375 a bushel in Chicago. The more actively
traded December contract fell 8.75 cents to $4.635.  Underestimate Seen  Narayanan said yesterday that planted acres for grains and
soybeans may be higher than forecast because the FSA “tends to
underestimate planted acreage throughout the growing season.”  The FSA projects that 3.411 million corn acres were left
unplanted this year. Weather risks will still persist as crops
near maturity, Narayanan said.  The loss pared September corn’s advance to 1.7 percent this
week. Ethanol gained 3.9 percent.  “The drop that we’re seeing today isn’t nearly as big as
the rally that’s happened over the last few days,” said Chase
Malcolm, ethanol broker at Starfuels Inc. in Jupiter,  Florida .
“Today is probably a little bit of correction from the rally.’  The corn crush spread, or the difference between a gallon
of ethanol and the corn needed to make it, was 51 cents, versus
49 cents yesterday.  In cash market trading, ethanol fell 9 cents to $2.47 a
gallon on the West Coast, the largest move among U.S. regions.
Prices slid 6.5 cents to $2.535 in New York, 1 cent to $2.345 in
Chicago and 0.5 cent to $2.445 on the  Gulf Coast .  The government uses tracking certificates, known as
Renewable Identification Numbers, or RINs, to determine
compliance with mandates to use the fuel.  Corn-based ethanol RINs  gained 1 cent to 79 cents. Advanced
RINs, which cover biodiesel and Brazilian surgarcane-based
ethanol, added 3 cents, climbing to 88 cents, data compiled by
Bloomberg show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
