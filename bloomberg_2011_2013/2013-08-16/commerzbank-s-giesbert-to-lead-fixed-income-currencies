Commerzbank AG (CBK)  will merge its fixed
income and currencies sales and trading arms under Nikolaus Giesbert as  Germany ’s second-biggest bank overhauls its senior
management.  Hui-Sun Kim, divisional board member for fixed income and
currency trading, will leave the company, Michael Reuther, who
leads Frankfurt-based Commerzbank’s investment bank, said in an
Aug. 14 memo to staff obtained by Bloomberg News today.  Commerzbank is firing staff to bolster its profitability as
the bank shrinks to meet European Union antitrust requirements
stemming from its 2009 rescue by German taxpayers. The lender
said last week that it will trim the number of seats on its
executive board to seven from nine and cut first-level managers,
currently 55, by about 20 percent in the coming weeks.  A call to Kim’s office number in  London  wasn’t connected.
An e-mail to his Commerzbank address was returned with a message
stating that he’s out of the office and not contactable.
Margarita Thiel, a Commerzbank spokeswoman, declined to comment.  Kim, who joined the bank in 2000, overhauled its options
trading, improved risk management and integrated the fixed
income and currencies trading businesses of Commerzbank with
Dresdner Bank after it was acquired in 2009, according to the
memo.  The Wall Street Journal reported the plan earlier.  To contact the reporter on this story:
