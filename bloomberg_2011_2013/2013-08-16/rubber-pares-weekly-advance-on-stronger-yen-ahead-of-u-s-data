Rubber declined for a second day,
paring a second weekly advance, as the Japanese currency
strengthened against the dollar ahead of data that may add to
signs of an improvement in the  U.S. economy .  Rubber for delivery in January on the Tokyo Commodity
Exchange fell as much as 1.1 percent to 261.6 yen a kilogram
($2,685 a metric ton) and was at 264.1 yen at 11:20 a.m. local
time. Futures have gained 1.1 percent this week, paring this
year’s loss to 13 percent.  The yen climbed for a third day against the greenback
before reports forecast to show housing starts rebounded and
 consumer confidence  increased to a six-year high. The U.S. is
the fourth largest consumer of rubber, accounting for 9 percent
of global demand. U.S. stocks fell the most since June after
improving economic data raised speculation the  Federal Reserve 
will reduce stimulus.  “The drop in U.S. equities overnight damped  market
sentiment ,” said Lee Chen Hoay, an analyst at Phillip Futures
Pte. in Singapore. With a stronger yen, it is a “double
whammy” for rubber, he said.  A report yesterday showed claims for jobless benefits
unexpectedly dropped last week to the lowest level in almost six
years, signaling the U.S. job market continues to mend.  Rubber for delivery in January rose 1.1 percent to 19,735
 yuan  ($3,230) a ton on the Shanghai Futures Exchange. Thai
rubber free-on-board dropped 0.3 percent to 81 baht ($2.59) a
kilogram yesterday, according to the Rubber Research Institute
of Thailand.  To contact the reporter on this story:
