Marriott International Inc. (MAR) , the
largest publicly traded U.S. hotel chain, reached a preliminary
agreement to sell three properties under construction in  London ,
south Florida and Manhattan for about $800 million.  The sale of each of the Edition brand hotels would take
place after construction is completed if the transaction goes
through, the Bethesda, Maryland-based Marriott said in a
statement today. The company said it signed a non-binding letter
of intent to sell the properties, subject to long-term
management agreements.  Marriott has been developing the boutique Edition brand
with hotelier  Ian Schrager . The company planned to sell the
three hotels “when the timing is right,” Chief Executive
Officer  Arne Sorenson  said on an Aug. 1 conference call.
Construction will be complete on the London property within 30
days, the Miami Beach hotel in the second half of 2014, and the
Clock Tower Edition in  New York  in early 2015, according to
today’s statement.  Buyers weren’t disclosed. The residential component of the
Miami Beach Edition isn’t included in the deal, and Marriott
would continue to own the units pending their sale to individual
purchasers, according to the statement.  The Wall Street Journal this week reported that Marriott
was close to a deal to sell the three Edition hotels to the Abu
Dhabi Investment Authority. Erik Portanger, a spokesman for the
sovereign-wealth fund, declined to comment on the report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
