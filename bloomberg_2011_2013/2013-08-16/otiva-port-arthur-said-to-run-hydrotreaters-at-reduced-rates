Motiva Enterprises LLC’s Port
Arthur,  Texas ,  refinery  will operate four hydrotreaters and
three lube units at reduced rates while a sulfur recovery unit
remains shut for repairs, according to a person familiar with
operations.  The sulfur unit may be shut as long as two more weeks, said
the person, who asked not to be identified because the
information is not public.  The unit’s reactor caught fire on Aug. 12. Workers are
trying to cool down the unit to a temperature low enough to
begin repairs, the person said.  Kim Windon, a Houston-based spokeswoman for Motiva,
confirmed that there was a small fire in a unit that was quickly
extinguished. She declined to comment on repairs to the unit.  Motiva’s Port Arthur refinery is the largest in the nation,
with capacity to process 600,000 barrels of crude oil a day.
Motiva is a joint venture between refining units of  Royal Dutch
Shell Plc (RDSA)  and the Saudi Arabian Oil Co., known as  Saudi Aramco .  To contact the reporter on this story:
