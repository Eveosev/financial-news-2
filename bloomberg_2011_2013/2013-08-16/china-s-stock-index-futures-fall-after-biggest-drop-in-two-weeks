China’s stocks fell for a third day,
paring a weekly advance, as earnings from  Anhui Conch Cement Co. (600585) 
disappointed investors and industrial shares slid.  Anhui Conch, China’s biggest cement maker, slumped 2.2
percent after first-half profit trailed estimates. China
National Chemical Engineering Company Ltd., a construction
company, sank 3.8 percent. Inner Mongolia Yili Industrial Group
Co. led gains by milk-powder makers after the China Securities
Journal said the government plans to consolidate the industry.  The  Shanghai Composite Index (SHCOMP)  dropped 0.7 percent to
2,067.62 at 9:59 a.m., paring its gain this week to 0.7 percent.
The gauge has rebounded 6 percent since reaching a more than
four-year low on June 27 as July data from exports to industrial
output improved. About 54 percent of companies on the  Shanghai 
 index  tracked by Bloomberg have reported quarterly results that
trailed estimates.  “Earnings from major companies don’t look that good so
far,” said Wei Wei, an analyst at West China Securities Co. in
Shanghai. “The market will remain cautious until the end of
earnings season this month.”  The CSI 300 Index declined 0.8 percent to 2,303.60. The
 Hang Seng China Enterprises Index (HSCEI)  fell 1.2 percent.  Anhui Conch dropped to 15.82  yuan . Net income was 3.06
billion yuan ($500 million), trailing the average estimate of
3.13 billion yuan of analysts compiled by Bloomberg.  Holcim Ltd., the world’s largest cement producer, lowered
its profit forecast for 2013 yesterday as the global economy
grew less than expected in the first six months and demand fell
short of forecasts.  Rights Issue  Inner Mongolia Baotou Steel Rare-Earth Hi-Tech Co. (600111) , the
nation’s biggest producer of rare earth, lost 1.5 percent to
28.86 yuan after saying net income fell 33 percent in the first
half from a year earlier.  China Merchants Bank Co. (600036)  declined 1.1 percent to 10.94 yuan
after the lender won regulatory approval for the Hong Kong
portion of a share sale that may be the world’s second-largest
offering this year.  The bank was given permission by the  China  Securities
Regulatory Commission to sell about 680 million Hong Kong-listed
shares to existing shareholders, the company said yesterday. The
regulator granted Merchants Bank approval on July 23 to sell
3.07 billion yuan-denominated shares in Shanghai. The lender
said July 22 it planned to raise as much as 35 billion yuan
($5.7 billion).  Trading volumes in the Shanghai index were 0.6 percent
higher than the 30-day average for this time of the day,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The measure is valued
at 8.4 times 12-month projected earnings, compared with the
five-year average of 12.7 times.  Baby Formula  Inner Mongolia Yili gained 1.1 percent to 35.26 yuan.
Zhejiang Beingmate Technology Industry & Trade Co. rose 1.5
percent to 24.63 yuan. The Ministry of Industry and Information
Technology submitted a plan to create 3-5 large companies with
more than 5 billion yuan of annual baby formula sales by the end
of 2018, the China Securities Journal reported, citing
unidentified people.  Asian stocks  fell today as improving U.S. economic data
increased concern that the Federal Reserve will reduce stimulus.
A report yesterday showed claims for jobless benefits
unexpectedly dropped last week to the lowest level in almost six
years. The cost of living rose in July for a third month,
supporting the Fed’s forecast that inflation will move closer to
its target.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
