An index of South African gold mine
operators including  AngloGold Ashanti Ltd. (ANG)  rose to the highest
in two months after a rebound in the metal’s price.  The FTSE/JSE Africa Gold Mining Index advanced as much as
8.6 percent to 1,445.80 points, the highest level since June 13.
Gold climbed overnight, and is up 2.7 percent at $1,362 an ounce
since the  Johannesburg Stock Exchange  closed yesterday.  The move is “on safe haven and technical buying,” said
 David Davis , an SBG Securities Ltd. analyst in Johannesburg.  The gold mining index jumped 7.3 percent to 1,428.04 as of
11:18 a.m. in Johannesburg. AngloGold rose 9.1 percent to 147.83
rand and  Harmony Gold Mining Co. (HAR)  gained 7 percent to 41.69 rand.  To contact the reporter on this story:
