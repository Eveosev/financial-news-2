Foschini Group Ltd., a South African
clothing retailer, advanced the most in almost three months
after the company received an approach to buy its consumer-finance unit RCS Investment Holdings Ltd.  The stock climbed as much as 5.6 percent, its biggest rise
since May 22, and traded 4.2 percent higher at 101.42 rand at
the market close in Johannesburg.  Foschini canceled a plan to reduce its shareholding in RCS
to less than 50 percent in June after failing to get an offer it
considered to be fair value. RCS is a joint venture between
Foschini, which has a 55 percent controlling stake, and  Standard
Bank Group Ltd. (SBK)   Foschini has “subsequently received an unsolicited
expression of interest to acquire 100 percent of RCS which the
board of Foschini will consider,” the Cape-town based company
said in the statement today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
