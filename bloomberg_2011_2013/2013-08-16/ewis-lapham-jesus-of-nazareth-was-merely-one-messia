Raised in a humble Jewish home, he
saw injustice and poverty living side by side with great wealth
and power. He urged people to look toward the Kingdom of God,
gathering disciples as he preached. For his pains, he was
executed by the rulers of the Holy Land.  (To listen to the podcast, click  here .)  The description fits many men in the first century A.D., as
Jesus of Nazareth was just one of a large number of messianic
preachers, prophets and outlaws roaming through the Palestine
area, riding the waves of discontent created by Roman rule.  There was Hezekiah the bandit chief, Athronges the shepherd
boy, Judas the Galilean and John the Baptist. A group of rebels,
known as the Sicarii, or Daggermen, killed enemies of God,
including Jews who collaborated with the Romans.  Messianic zeal led to a full-scale Jewish revolt against
Rome in 66 A.D.  I spoke with Reza Aslan, author of “Zealot: The Life and
Times of Jesus of Nazareth,” on the following topics:  1. Two Narratives.  2. Messianic Revolutionary.  3. Jewish Robin Hoods.  4. John the Baptist.  5. Crucifixion.  To buy this book in North America, click  here .  ( Lewis Lapham  is the founder of  Lapham’s Quarterly  and the
