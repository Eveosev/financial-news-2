The selection process for the
European captain at golf’s Ryder Cup will change in 2016 to
include the three previous holders of the position.  Paul McGinley,  Jose Maria Olazabal and  Colin Montgomerie 
will be joined by the European Tour chief executive and a
representative of the tournament committee on the five-man
committee that will select the captain, Ryder Cup  Europe  said in
a statement. It replaces the 15-man committee which had handled
the duty since 1999.  McGinley will lead the European team against the U.S. at
next year’s event at Gleneagles in  Scotland . Olazabal was
captain last year and Montgomerie was in charge of the team in
2010. The 2016 Ryder Cup will be played at Hazeltine National in
 Minnesota .  It’s the third time the European team has changed the
selection process since first entering a continental squad in
the competition in 1979. The task first fell to the Ryder Cup
Committee, which chose just three captains -- John Jacobs, Tony Jacklin and Bernard Gallacher -- for the next nine competitions.  A new European captain has been selected for each edition,
with McGinley named to the post in January.  Tom Watson  will captain the U.S. team in 2014. The eight-time major champion also served as captain in 1993.  Europe has won the past two Ryder Cups and five of the past
six. Last year, it equaled a 13-year-old record held by the
Americans for the biggest comeback in the competition’s history,
rallying from a 10-6 deficit beginning the last session to win
the three-day match at Medinah Country Club outside Chicago 14
1/2 to 13 1/2.  To contact the reporter on this story:
