InterOil Corp. (IOC)  said discussions with
 Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM)  about jointly developing Papua New Guinea
natural gas discoveries are continuing, contradicting a media
 report  that the talks collapsed.  The companies entered exclusive negotiations to sell stakes
in InterOil’s Elk and Antelope fields to Irving, Texas-based
Exxon in May. InterOil, based in Whitehorse, Yukon Territory,
and run from Cairns, Australia, said today in a statement the
discussions are “ongoing.”  InterOil dropped 3.2 percent to $71.70 at the close in New
York, after earlier declining as much as 12 percent. The shares
have fallen 16 percent this month.  InterOil Chief Executive Officer Michael Hession told
analysts and investors during an Aug. 13 conference call that he
was abandoning efforts to build and operate a liquefied natural
gas export terminal in Papua New Guinea.  At the time, Hession said negotiations with Exxon over the
Elk and Antelope fields were progressing. The former Woodside
Energy Ltd. executive was hired last month to replace InterOil
founder Phil Mulacek, who retired in April.  To contact the reporter on this story:
