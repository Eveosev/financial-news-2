Palm oil  headed for the biggest
weekly gain in 32 months as soybeans rallied on concern that the
U.S., the largest grower of the oilseed crushed to make an
alternative oil, may harvest a smaller crop than forecast.  The contract for November delivery, with the highest open
interest and volume, climbed as much as 1.6 percent to 2,336
ringgit ($712) a metric ton on the Bursa  Malaysia  Derivatives,
and ended the morning session at 2,331 ringgit. Futures are
poised to gain 6.3 percent this week, the steepest increase
since the five days ended Dec. 3, 2010. Palm for local physical
delivery in September was at 2,385 ringgit, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  Soybeans in  Chicago  are headed for the best weekly advance
in more than a year as the U.S. cut forecasts for the harvests
this year after excessive rains in May and June reduced planted
acreage and damaged yields. About 1.619 million acres of land
originally slated for soybeans were left unplanted, the USDA
said yesterday. That compares with 159,579 in 2012, government
data show. More than a third of the Midwest remains “notably
dry,” Commodity Weather Group LLC said in a report.  “The expectations were for the U.S. soybean crop to be
quite good this year and the South American crops were also
reaching destination markets so the supply issues were perceived
to have eased,” Alvin Tai, an analyst with RHB Investment Bank
Bhd., said by phone in  Kuala Lumpur . “Now with this dry period
in  North America , people are repositioning for higher prices.”  Exports Gain  Soybean oil  for delivery in December climbed 0.5 percent to
43.65 cents a pound on the Chicago Board of Trade. Soybeans for
November gained 0.3 percent to $12.6875 a bushel. The most
active contract has advanced 7.3 percent this week, the most
since the five days ended July 20, 2012.  Palm oil also gained as data this week showed an increase
in exports from Malaysia, Tai said. Shipments surged 18 percent
to 644,589 tons in the first 15 days of August, Intertek said
yesterday, while SGS (Malaysia) Sdn. reported a 19 percent gain.
Malaysia kept the export tax on crude palm oil for September
unchanged at 4.5 percent for a seventh month, according to a
Customs Department statement on the Malaysian Palm Oil Board
 website .  Refined palm oil for January delivery advanced 1.9 percent
to 5,648  yuan  ($924) a ton on the  Dalian Commodity Exchange .
Soybean oil added 1.6 percent to 7,236 yuan a ton.  To contact the reporter on this story:
