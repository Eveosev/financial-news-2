Goldman Sachs Group Inc. is leading
the race to take the biggest share of a stake in  China Huarong
Asset Management Co.  before a stock sale by the so-called bad
bank, the Financial Times reported, citing two people close to
the transaction.  Goldman Sachs,  Morgan Stanley (MS)  and  Deutsche Bank AG (DBK)  have
held talks about investing in Huarong Asset’s $1.5 billion share
sale ahead of a planned listing in Hong Kong next year, the FT
said. The newspaper cited another unnamed banker as saying only
a few meetings had been held and a deal is not expected until
December.  Eddie Naylor, a spokesman for Goldman Sachs, declined to
comment. Jeremy Hughes, a Deutsche Bank spokesman, declined to
immediately comment. A Morgan Stanley spokeswoman couldn’t
immediately be reached for comment. Phone calls to Beijing-based
China Huarong’s press office went unanswered.  Huarong Asset said in October it would seek Chinese and
foreign strategic investors and sell shares in local and
overseas markets. The nation’s Ministry of Finance owns 98.06
percent of the company, while China  Life Insurance  (Group) Co.
holds the rest, the ministry said in September. China Life is
the parent of publicly traded  China Life Insurance Co. (2628)   Huarong Asset had first-half profit after provisions of 7.5
billion  yuan  ($1.2 billion), the most among the four asset
management companies the government set up in the 1990s to
dispose of non-performing loans at the nation’s biggest banks,
according to a July 24  statement  on the firm’s website.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
