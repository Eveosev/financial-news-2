A lawsuit against  JPMorgan Chase &
Co. (JPM)  by liquidators of two Bear Stearns Cos.  hedge funds  seeking
$1.5 billion over their collapse formally ended today after the
parties reached a settlement in June, according to court
records.  Bear Stearns Cos., two of its former managers, and auditor
Deloitte & Touche were accused of misleading investors in two
hedge funds with holdings in subprime mortgages that imploded
and filed for bankruptcy in July 2007.  Two former Bear Stearns fund managers who were named as
defendants,  Ralph Cioffi  and  Matthew Tannin , were acquitted
after a federal trial in Brooklyn New York in 2009 of charges
they misled investors in the funds’ losses of $1.6 billion.  The complaint was filed by Stillwater Capital Partners LP
of New York, Essex Fund Ltd. of the Cayman Islands and Geoffrey
Varga and William Cleghorn, two liquidators appointed in the
Caymans to recover losses for investors in “feeder funds.”  The parties filed a stipulation with U.S. District Court
Judge Alvin Hellerstein today asking him to dismiss all claims
and counterclaims, citing an accord that was originally reached
last year. The judge issued a June 13 order that he would close
the case within 90 days if a settlement hadn’t been consummated.  JPMorgan bought Bear Stearns in 2008.  The case is Varga v. The Bear Stearns Cos., 08-03397, U.S.
District Court, Southern District of  New York  (Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
