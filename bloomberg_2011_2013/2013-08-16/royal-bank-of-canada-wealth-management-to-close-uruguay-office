Royal Bank of Canada’s   wealth
management  division will close an office with about 40 employees
in Montevideo, Uruguay, at the end of October.  The decision is “part of a strategic review of our Latin
American business,” said Aishling Cullen, a spokeswoman for the
Toronto-based company, in an e-mailed statement. Some employees
may move to other locations, and the office will provide
services until Oct. 31, she said.  A local judicial inquiry involving soccer players, in which
the bank was asked for information in June, is “a separate
situation,” Cullen said. The firm is working with authorities
and hasn’t been accused of any wrongdoing, she said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
