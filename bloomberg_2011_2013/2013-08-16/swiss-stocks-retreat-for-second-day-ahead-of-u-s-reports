Swiss stocks  declined for a second
day, erasing an earlier advance, as investors awaited U.S.
economic reports on housing starts and  consumer confidence .  The SMI slipped 0.5 percent to 7,946.15 at 10:23 a.m. in
Zurich. The benchmark gauge fell 1.2 percent yesterday, trimming
 gains for the year  to 17 percent, as improving U.S. economic
data fueled speculation the  Federal Reserve  will reduce stimulus
measures. The broader Swiss Performance Index dropped 0.4
percent today.  The volume of shares changing hands in SMI companies was
9.3 percent greater than the average of the last 30 days,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  In the U.S., a Commerce Department report at 8:30 a.m. in
 Washington  will show housing starts rose to a 900,000 annualized
rate in July, economists surveyed by Bloomberg predicted. In a
sign construction activity will increase, building permits may
climb to a 945,000 rate from 918,000 in June.  A separate release at 9:55 a.m.  New York  time may show a
gauge of  consumer sentiment  in the world’s largest economy rose
to a six-year high in August. The Thomson Reuters/University of
Michigan preliminary index climbed to 85.2 from 85.1 in July,
according to economists’ estimates.  To contact the reporter on this story:
