The European Union’s competition
watchdog is investigating whether aid from Belgium’s Wallonia
region to airports in the area, including Charleroi, were
unlawful.  The European Commission sent an information request to the
Belgian authorities on July 31, spokesman  Jonathan Todd  said
today in an e-mail. The inquiry is being done on the
commission’s initiative and there isn’t a formal investigation
“at this stage,” he said.  The commission can order companies to pay back government
funding if it can’t be justified for providing a public service.  The EU is probing government subsidies for several regional
airports across  Europe  that may have unfairly benefited  Ryanair
Holdings Plc (RYA)  and other low-cost rivals. The commission is
planning to release new rules next year to make it more
difficult for governments to prop up unprofitable airports.  Belgian daily newspaper L’Echo reported the news earlier
today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
