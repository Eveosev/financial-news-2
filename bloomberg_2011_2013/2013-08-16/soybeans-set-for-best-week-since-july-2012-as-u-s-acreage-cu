Soybeans headed for the best weekly
gain in more than a year after data showed the number of
unplanted acres surged in the U.S., the largest grower, and as
dry weather threatened crops.  Soybeans for delivery in November gained as much as 0.5
percent to $12.72 a bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade, the
highest price since July 23. Futures traded little changed at
$12.64 as of 1:44 p.m. Singapore time, set for a 6.9 percent
weekly gain, the most since the five days ended July 20, 2012.  About 1.619 million acres of land originally slated for
soybeans were left unplanted, according to the  U.S. Department
of Agriculture . That compares with 159,579 in 2012, government
data show. Dryness will keep lowering yield potential for corn
and particularly soybeans in affected areas, Commodity Weather
Group said yesterday. Corn and soybeans climbed to record prices
in 2012 when the worst drought since the 1930s cut U.S. harvests.  “We still have haunting memories of U.S. Midwest crops
from last year,” said Joyce Liu, an investment analyst at
Phillip Futures Pte Ltd. in Singapore. “If you have dry weather
again, then it can be worrying.”  Little or no rain has fallen in the past two weeks in parts
of Iowa and  Illinois , the top growers of corn, National Weather
Service data show. Farmers filed insurance claims on 3.411
million acres they were unable to plant due to wet weather in
May and June, up from 262,467 last year, the USDA said.  Corn for December delivery fell 0.7 percent to $4.6875 a
bushel after rising 3.7 percent yesterday. Futures are poised
for a weekly advance of 3.4 percent, ending four weeks of losses.  Wheat for December lost 0.2 percent to $6.485 a bushel.  To contact the reporter on this story:
