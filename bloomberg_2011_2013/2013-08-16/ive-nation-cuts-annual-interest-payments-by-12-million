Live Nation Entertainment Inc. (LYV) , the
world’s biggest concert promoter and ticket seller, completed a
debt refinancing that it said will reduce annual cash interest
payments by $12 million.  Live Nation obtained a $335 million revolving credit line,
a seven-year $950 million facility and a five-year $115 million
loan, the Beverly Hills, California-based company said today in
a  statement . Earlier this week, the company sold $200 million of
7 percent notes, due in 2020, that yield 6.2 percent.  The company is reducing interest expenses after debt more
than doubled with the acquisition of Ticketmaster in 2010. Live
Nation had long-term  borrowings  of $1.66 billion as of June 30.
Proceeds from the new loans and senior notes were used to repay
higher-priced existing loans and its 8.125 percent notes, along
with fees and expenses, the company said.  Live Nation rose 2.4 percent to $17.20 at the close in New
York. The stock has gained 85 percent this year. Billionaire
John Malone’s  Liberty Media Corp. (LMCA)  is the company’s biggest
shareholder.  To contact the reporter on this story:
