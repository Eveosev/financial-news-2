U.K. stocks  fell, dragging the  FTSE
100 (UKX)  Index lower for a third day, as investors awaited reports on
the U.S. housing market and consumer confidence.  Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc declined 2.1 percent after
Investec Plc recommended that investors sell the shares.  Aviva
Plc (AV/)  dropped 1.1 percent as Exane BNP Paribas lowered its rating
on the insurer. Precious-metals producers  Randgold Resources
Ltd. (RRS)  and  Fresnillo Plc (FRES)  gained at least 4 percent as gold and
silver climbed after European equity markets closed yesterday.  The FTSE 100 dropped 10 points, or 0.2 percent, to 6,473.34
at 9:32 a.m. in London, extending this week’s decline to 1.7
percent. It has still  rallied 7.4 percent  from a low on June 24
as the  Bank of England  gave forward guidance on interest rates
for the first time. The broader FTSE All-Share Index slipped 0.1
percent while Ireland’s ISEQ Index sank 0.9 percent today.  In the U.S., a Commerce Department report at 8:30 a.m. in
Washington may show  housing starts  climbed in July to a 900,000
annualized rate, according to economists surveyed by Bloomberg.
They rose at an 836,000 pace in June, the slowest since August
2012. Building permits, which signal construction activity, rose
to a 945,000 rate from 918,000 in June, estimates from a
separate survey showed.  A separate release will probably show a gauge of consumer
sentiment in the world’s largest economy rose to a six-year high
in August. The Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan
preliminary index climbed to 85.2 from 85.1 in July, according
to economists’ estimates.  To contact the reporter on this story:
