JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM)  will pay
$23 million to settle a class-action lawsuit with pension funds
that accused the bank of breaching its fiduciary duty by
investing their money in  Lehman Brothers  Holdings Inc. notes.  JPMorgan and the lead plaintiff, the Board of Trustees of
the Operating Engineers Pension Trust, filed a proposed
settlement agreement yesterday in federal court in Manhattan.  The settlement pertains to all plans and entities governed
by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act for which
JPMorgan invested cash collateral in two floating rate notes
issued by Lehman Brothers and continued to hold those securities
until Sept. 15, 2008, when Lehman Brothers sought bankruptcy,
according to the filing.  Joe Evangelisti , a spokesman for New York-based JPMorgan,
didnâ€™t immediately respond to an e-mail yesterday after regular
business hours seeking comment on the settlement.  The case is Board of Trustees of the Operating Engineers
Pension Trust v. JPMorgan Chase Bank NA, 09-cv-09333, U.S.
District Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan.)  To contact the reporter on this story:
