Capital One Financial Corp. (COF) , the
lender that gets more than half its revenue from credit cards,
bought a commercial real estate firm as it seeks to build its
businesses that aren’t tied to consumers. Terms weren’t
disclosed.  Capital One’s purchase of Beech Street Capital LLC will
place the bank among the five largest U.S. lenders for
multifamily structures, according to a statement today from the
McLean, Virginia-based firm. Closely held Beech Street is an
originator and servicer of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac commercial
real estate loans and is based in Bethesda, Maryland, according
to the statement.  The transaction is scheduled to be completed in the fourth
quarter.  To contact the reporter on this story:
