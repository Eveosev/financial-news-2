Chris Nelson hit two home runs and
drove in five runs as the Los Angeles Angels defeated the  New
York  Yankees 8-4 to avoid a four-game series sweep.  Nelson hit a solo homer in the fourth and followed with a
grand slam in the eighth inning last night in the Major League
Baseball game at Yankee Stadium.  Josh Hamilton  hit a run-scoring single in the first inning
to give the Angels a 1-0 lead.  Alfonso Soriano  tied the game in
the third with a single that sent home  Brett Gardner .  Erick Aybar scored on Hank Conger’s sacrifice fly to give
the Angels a 2-1 advantage and Nelson followed with his solo
home run. The third baseman’s grand slam put the Angels ahead
7-1 and J.B. Shuck added a run with his single in the eighth.  In the ninth inning, the Yankees added three runs on a
Robinson Cano run-scoring single and a two-run double by  Vernon Wells .  Soriano, who had driven in 13 runs in his previous two
games, went 4-for-5 and is now hitting .296 since joining the
Yankees on July 26 in a trade from the Chicago Cubs.  Angels starter C.J. Wilson (13-6) allowed one run on 11
hits in 6 2/3 innings, while Yankees pitcher  Phil Hughes  (4-12)
took the loss after giving up three runs on six hits in six
innings.  The Angels (54-66) are fourth in the American League West,
15 1/2 games behind the Texas Rangers. The Yankees (62-58) are
fourth in the AL East, 8 1/2 games behind the Boston Red Sox,
who lost 2-1 to the Toronto Blue Jays last night.  To contact the reporter on this story:
