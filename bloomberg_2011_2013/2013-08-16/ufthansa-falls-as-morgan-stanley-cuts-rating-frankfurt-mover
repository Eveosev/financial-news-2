Deutsche Lufthansa AG (LHA)  fell to its
lowest in eight months after Morgan Stanley cut the rating on
Europe’s No. 2 airline amid weak sales in the second quarter.  Lufthansa dropped as much as 66 cents, or 4.6 percent, to
13.72 euros in  Frankfurt , its lowest since Dec. 14, 2012. The
stock, which traded at 13.75 euros at 10:22 a.m., has lost 3.4
percent this year, trailing the Bloomberg World Airlines Index
of 31 members, which has gained 7.3 percent in the period.  A “more difficult operating environment has emerged,”
Penny Butcher, a London-based analyst at Morgan Stanley, said in
cutting the stock to “equal-weight” from “overweight.” The
second quarter saw yields, a measure of fare prices, weakening,
something which will persist this quarter, she said.  Lufthansa on Aug. 2 reported second-quarter operating
profit rose to 438 million euros from 269 million euros a year
earlier, when adjusted for restructuring costs and one-off
items, with sales little changed at 7.89 billion euros. The
airline is in the midst of a restructuring program, called
Score, to raise operating profit to a record 2.3 billion euros
by 2015.  “With continued uncertainty around Score savings timings,
pilot resolutions and the nature and implementation timing of
the project costs of the fleet, we can’t see a clear path to
outperformance,” Butcher said.  Morgan Stanley (MS)  raised its price target for  International
Consolidated Airlines Group SA (IAG) , parent of British Airways, to
4.80 euros from 4.15 euros per share. IAG dropped as much as 2
percent to 301.9 pence in  London , reducing this year’s gain to
64 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
