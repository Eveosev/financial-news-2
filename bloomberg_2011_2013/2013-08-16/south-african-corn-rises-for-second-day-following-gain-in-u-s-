Corn futures traded in  South Africa ,
the continent’s largest grower of the grain, rose for a second
day after U.S. prices climbed the most in five weeks.  White corn for delivery in December, the most active
contract, added 0.5 percent to 2,333 rand ($233) a metric ton by
the noon close on the South African Futures Exchange in
Johannesburg. The yellow variety for the same delivery month
gained 0.4 percent to 2,179 rand a ton.  Little or no rain fell in the past two weeks in parts of
Iowa and  Illinois , the biggest U.S. corn-growing states,
according to National Weather Service data. Corn for delivery in
December jumped 3.7 percent, the most since July 9, on the
Chicago Board of Trade yesterday.  “We followed the Chicago market, with their prices being
high on concern that they won’t get enough rain,” Lindy van Blommestein, a trader at Johannesburg-based Farmwise Grains
(Pty) Ltd., said by phone.  A meal made from white corn is a staple South African food,
while the yellow variety is mainly used as  animal feed .  Wheat for delivery in December increased 0.5 percent to
3,324 rand a ton.  To contact the reporter on this story:
