Seven cases of Chateau Lafite-Rothschild 1982 and five of Chateau Cheval Blanc from the same
year are among top Bordeaux wines going on sale with Burgundies
including Romanee-Conti and Meursault at  Sotheby’s (BID)  in  New York .  The Lafite, a first-growth estate in the Pauillac region
north of Bordeaux, carries a presale estimate of as much as
$30,000 a case and the Cheval Blanc, from Saint-Emilion, is
priced to fetch as much as $9,000, according to Sotheby’s. Two
three-bottle lots of Romanee-Conti, one dating from 1999 and the
other 2010, are estimated to fetch as much as $40,000 each.  The auction on Sept. 21 comes as the Liv-ex Fine Wine 50
Index of top Bordeaux vintages has risen 3 percent this year,
with declines since mid-March erasing more than half of the gain
of 8 percent in the first 10 weeks of the year. Demand at recent
auctions has been driven by older Burgundy vintages as appetite
for Bordeaux has been inconsistent.  “There’s still some decent demand coming out of  Asia ,”
 Chris Smith , investment manager at The Wine Investment Fund in
London, said by telephone. The fund, invested in Bordeaux,
manages $50 million.  The Sotheby’s sale also features a four-bottle lot of
Romanee-Conti 2004 estimated to sell for as much as $37,500 and
two bottles of the same vineyard’s 1996 wine priced to fetch as
much as $25,000.  Grand Cru  At a Bonhams sale in London last month, three bottles of
Romanee-Conti 1999 made up the top lot, selling for 23,000
pounds ($35,100), while another three-bottle lot of Romanee-Conti 1989 sold for 17,250 pounds.  The Romanee-Conti vineyard in Vosne-Romanee is just under 2
hectares (5 acres) and has its own appellation as a Burgundy
grand cru wine. Lafite’s estate in  Bordeaux  dates back at least
to the 17th century and has been controlled by the Rothschild
family since its acquisition by Baron James de Rothschild, then
head of its French branch, in August 1868.  Other wines in the Sotheby’s sale include a magnum of white
Meursault Les Rougeots J-F Coche-Dury 1996, estimated to sell
for as much as $1,500, and two bottles of Corton Charlemagne
from the same grower, priced to fetch as much as $3,250.  A case of Chateauneuf du Pape 2005 from Chateau Rayas in
the Rhone is also on sale, carrying a top estimate of $6,500,
along with six magnums of 1996 Dom Perignon Rose Champagne
priced to fetch as much as $4,750 and three magnums of 1988 Krug
estimated at as much as $2,500.  The wines are part of a multiple-owner sale drawn from
private cellars in  North America  which, together with a separate
auction the previous evening, is estimated by Sotheby’s to sell
for as much as $4 million.  Here is a list of global wine auctions scheduled so far
