Coffee exports from  Uganda , Africa’s
biggest shipper of the robusta variety, rose for a seventh month
in July after a drought aided drying of a larger crop.  Shipments climbed 29 percent to 395,224 60-kilogram (132-pound) bags from 306,331 bags a year earlier, the state-run
Uganda Coffee Development Authority said today by e-mail from
Kampala. Exports were worth $45.1 million and compared with
361,146 bags in June, it said.  The main destinations for Ugandan coffee include the
European Union, the U.S. and Russia. Production in the African
nation may climb 8.9 percent to 3.35 million bags in the year
through September, according to the  U.S. Department of
Agriculture .  Shipments expanded “due to dry spell and release of stocks
by exporters,” the authority said. Robusta, used in espresso
and instant coffee, accounted for 81 percent of July deliveries,
it said.  Exports in the first 10 months of the 2012-13 season
climbed 31 percent from a year earlier to 3.04 million bags,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The East African nation is the continent’s second-biggest
coffee producer after  Ethiopia . Uganda consumes about 3 percent
of its annual crop, according to the African Fine Coffees
Association.  To contact the reporter on this story:
