(Corrects to say target is for per capita GDP in fourth
paragraph.)  Indonesia  has expanded the middle
class and kept the  budget deficit  low, President  Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono  said, in a favorable assessment of his record before
2014 elections as the country faces slowing growth.  Indonesia’s budget deficit has stayed under 3 percent of
gross domestic product, unemployment and poverty rates have
fallen and the country has achieved an investment grade rating,
Yudhoyono said in an annual speech ahead of the country’s
independence day.  Yudhoyono, set to hand over power in elections next year,
is seeking to shore up his 10-year legacy of political and
economic stability in the world’s fourth-most populous nation.
Growth was 5.81 percent in the second quarter, the slowest since
the third quarter of 2010.  Yudhoyono said he expects the country’s per capita GDP to
approach $5,000 by the end of 2014, up from $3,592 in 2012. The
country has maintained growth above 4 percent during his tenure
as spending by the expanding middle class shielded  Southeast
Asia ’s largest economy from the 2008-2009 financial crisis.  To contact the reporters on this story:
