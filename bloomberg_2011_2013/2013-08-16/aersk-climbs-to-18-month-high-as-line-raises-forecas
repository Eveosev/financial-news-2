A.P. Moeller-Maersk A/S (MAERSKB)  climbed to
an 18-month high after the company raised the earnings forecast
for its container line, which almost doubled profit as lower
fuel prices and costs offset falling freight rates.  Maersk Line will report a profit this year “significantly
above” that of 2012, compared with a previous forecast of
earnings “above” last year’s level, the Copenhagen-based
company said in a statement today. The world’s largest container
line posted second-quarter net income of $439 million, compared
with $227 million a year earlier.  “Maersk Line revises its expected result on continued
strong cost performance and the stronger result for the first
half of 2013 compared to last year,” the company said. The
improvement was driven by lower costs mainly from “vessel
network efficiencies” aided by reduced bunker prices.  Maersk Line  has trimmed its fleet and slowed sailing speeds
to curb capacity as falling consumer demand hurts cargo volume
and carriage prices. The Shanghai Containerized Freight Index --
a measure of prices for cargo leaving the world’s busiest port -
- was 22 percent lower at $1,133.14 at the end of June this year
compared with a year earlier. The Asia-to-Europe trade is
Maersk’s most important route.  Global Demand  The shares gained as much as 7.6 percent to 48,160 kroner,
their biggest  intraday  advance since Nov. 30, 2011 and highest
price since Feb. 20, 2012. The stock traded 7 percent higher at
12:39 p.m. in Copenhagen.  “A.P. Moeller-Maersk reported much better results than we
expected and also higher than consensus,” Frode Moerkedal, an
analyst at RS Platou Markets AS in Oslo, said in a note to
clients today. “The beat is driven by Maersk Line, which
surprised by very good volumes and lower-than-expected bunker
costs. On the negative side, Maersk Oil disappointed with very
weak production.”  A.P. Moeller-Maersk, Maersk Line’s parent, reported a
profit of 4.48 billion kroner ($801.4 million) in the second
quarter, compared with 5.26 billion kroner a year earlier. It
now expects a profit excluding impairment losses and divestment
gains of 3.5 billion kroner in 2013, compared with a previous
forecast of 2.9 billion kroner. Net income for the period beat
the average  analyst estimate  in a survey compiled by Bloomberg
of 3.24 billion kroner.  ‘Significantly Below’  The decline reflects a 48 percent drop in earnings to 1.43
billion kroner at Maersk Oil. The performance of the company’s
most profitable division was affected by lower average  oil
prices  and the unit now expects a 2013 result that is
“significantly below” last year’s level.  Maersk Line cut unit costs 12.7 percent in the quarter as
bunker costs slumped 31 percent because of lower consumption and
fuel-price declines. The average freight rate per forty-foot
equivalent unit stood at $2,618 in the second quarter, compared
with $3,014 in the same period a year earlier. That hurt revenue
which declined 9.2 percent to $6.7 billion in the quarter, even
as volume rose 2.1 percent.  Maersk Line today revised its forecast for global demand
growth for seaborne containers, saying it now expects a rise of
2 to 3 percent in 2013, compared with a previous forecast of 2
to 4 percent growth.  “The outlook for container transportation remains
challenging as demand is expected to continue to be weak in 2013
while new deliveries are expected to amount to 9.5 percent of
the fleet,” Maersk said. “Accordingly, Maersk Line will
maintain focus on supply management such as idling of vessels
and blank sailings.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
