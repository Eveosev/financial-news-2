The  Federal Reserve  issued a final
rule that will require 70 financial companies to pay a combined
total of $440 million for the cost of expanded Fed supervision.  The Fed’s Board of Governors voted 7-0 for the rule that
outlines “which companies are charged, estimates the applicable
expenses, determines each company’s assessment fee, and bills
for and collects the assessment fees,” according to a statement
released by the Fed today in  Washington . The central bank will
levy the assessment every year, and plans in late October to
notify the financial companies of their fees for 2012.  The Dodd-Frank Act, signed into law by President  Barack Obama  in July 2010, expanded the central bank’s power to oversee
the largest financial institutions and gave regulators new tools
aimed at preventing a repeat of the 2007-2009 financial crisis.
The act also required the Fed to assess financial companies for
the costs of this expanded oversight.  The 70 banks would pay an average of about $6.3 million
under the rule, with larger banks having a higher assessment.  The assessment rule was proposed in April, and the amount
of money to be collected is unchanged from the original
proposal. The assessments would apply to companies with more
than $50 billion in assets, such as Goldman Sachs Group Inc.,
 Bank of America Corp. (BAC)  and  JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM)   To contact the reporter on this story:
