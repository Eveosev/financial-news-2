The ruble advanced for a third day
as oil,  Russia ’s main export earner, rose and companies bought
the local currency to pay taxes.  The ruble appreciated 0.1 percent to 37.7958 against the
central bank’s euro-dollar basket by 6 p.m. in Moscow, when the
central bank stops its market operations. The currency was
little changed in the week. The yield on the government’s ruble
bond due February 2027 dropped two basis points, or 0.02
percentage point, to 7.77 percent.  Brent oil rose for a sixth day in  London , gaining 0.5
percent to $110.09 per barrel. The monthly tax period in Russia
started yesterday and continues Aug. 20 with value-added tax
payments. The central bank spent the equivalent of 13.26 billion
rubles ($404 million) of foreign currency buying rubles on Aug.
14 compared with sales equal to 10.79 billion rubles the
previous day, the regulator said on its website.  “People are buying before the VAT payments,” Vladimir Miklashevsky, a trading desk strategist at Danske Bank S/A in
Helsinki, said by e-mail. “The central bank is helping.”  Bank Rossii buys and sells currency to curb volatility and
reports the data with a lag. The VAT payments may see exporters
buy as much as 140 billion rubles, according to an OAO
Promsvyazbank note, published Aug. 14.  The ruble strengthened 0.2 percent against the dollar to
33.8200 for a 0.2 percent weekly gain. The Russian currency
appreciated 0.1 percent against the euro to 43.8755, paring its
loss in the week to 0.1 percent.  Dividend Payments  Large Russian companies like OAO Gazprom and OAO Rosneft
are also supporting the ruble as they pay annual dividends,
which include foreign-currency payments to holders of depositary
receipts, according to VTB Capital and BCS Financial Group.
Total payments in August may reach $6 billion, VTB said in a
note Aug. 14.  “Next week we have Rosneft paying $600 million in
dividends to non-residents,” Dmitry Dorofeev, strategist and
trader at BCS in Moscow, said by e-mail. “This will support the
dollar against the ruble.”  The Russian currency has declined 7.8 percent against the
dollar-euro basket since the beginning of 2013. That compares
with a 6.4 percent drop for JPMorgan Chase & Co.’s  index of
emerging-market currencies  and a 4.1 percent increase for Brent
oil.  To contact the reporter on this story:
