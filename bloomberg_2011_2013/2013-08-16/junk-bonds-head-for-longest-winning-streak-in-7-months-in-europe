High-yield corporate bonds in Europe
are set to hand investors an eighth week of profits as the
regionâ€™s economy emerges from a record-long recession.  Bonds of  New World Resources Plc (NWR) , the Czech coking-coal
producer, led an average total return of 0.04 percent this week,
the longest stretch of gains since the week ending January 11,
according to Bloomberg bond index data. The average yield on the
debt fell for a seventh week to 4.66 percent, the lowest since
May 31.  To contact the reporter on this story:
