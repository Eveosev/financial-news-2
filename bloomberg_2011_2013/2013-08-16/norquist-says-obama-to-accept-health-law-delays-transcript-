Anti-tax advocate Grover Norquist,
president of Americans for  Tax Reform , said in an interview on
Bloomberg Television’s “Political Capital with  Al Hunt ,”
airing this weekend, that President  Barack Obama  will agree to
delay implementation of the bulk of his health-care law set to
take effect on Oct. 1 and avoid a government shutdown.  (This is not a legal transcript. Bloomberg LP cannot
guarantee its accuracy.)  AL HUNT:  We begin the show with Grover Norquist, the anti-tax activist and powerhouse in the Republican Party. Grover, as
you know, the big fiscal showdowns are coming this fall. You’ve
proposed delaying Obamacare, not counting for a year.  I talked to the White House. I talked to Democrats. They
say no way, they will never accept that. If they stick to that
position, what should the Republican strategy be? And should it
include a possible government shutdown?  GROVER NORQUIST : Well, of course, some people have said
that we should insist that the president sign the abolition
defunding of Obamacare. I think he’d rather give you his liver
than do that. So I don’t think that’s an option.  HUNT: They also said they won’t take a one-year delay.  NORQUIST: Except they’ve been delaying whole sections of it
again and again and again -  HUNT: Right.  NORQUIST:  -  for particular friends. I think that it’s
going to be increasingly difficult for the White House to say
we’ve delayed it for our big business friends, for our insurance
friends, for our labor union friends -  HUNT: So you think they would capitulate on that?  NORQUIST: I don’t think it would be a complete
capitulation.  HUNT: Well, no, but they say it would be. They say - I
mean, I’m just saying what they say.  NORQUIST: Yeah.  HUNT: They say they will not delay, you know - you know,
all of Obamacare. Do you think they’ll ultimately cave on that?  NORQUIST: At the end of the day, yes, because he’s had to
delay so much of it. It wouldn’t be a complete embarrassment to
say, “We’re going to let everybody have a year delay.”  HUNT: If they don’t cave, should the Republicans consider a
government shutdown?  NORQUIST: The Republicans should pass a C.R. debt ceiling
that includes it, and then the president decides whether he
wants to shut the government down.  HUNT: And therefore, if he then vetoes that, there ought to
be a government - there will be a government shutdown?  NORQUIST: Look, we always get into that argument on both
sides. I tend to think there won’t be a government shutdown,
just as there wasn’t on the sequester, which was a much bigger
deal.  HUNT: And how about the debt ceiling? Same thing?  NORQUIST: Well, people could decide either with a
continuing resolution or the debt ceiling. There are sort of
only two pieces of legislation that I can think of that need to
pass, must pass. Everything else could sort of not happen. Those
are the two things that have to have a House, Senate and
president to agree. The House, the Senate and the president will
each try and stick stuff into the must-pass bill.  HUNT: Let me ask you about the sequester. Some defense
hawks,  John McCain  and  Lindsey Graham , charge that sequestration
is literally - they say literally affecting the ability to
defend our nation and it ought to be replaced by a combination
of other spending cuts and revenue increases, if necessary.  NORQUIST: And the reason why the president of the  United
States , Obama, was willing to have sequestration as part of the
budget deal in 2011 was that he sees John McCain and Lindsey
Graham on all the TV shows and think they represent the modern
Republican Party. There are, in fact, maybe three people in the
House and the Senate who take that position, that you cannot
ever reduce government  defense spending  from -  HUNT: So you don’t agree - you think McCain and Graham are
just wrong when they say it literally affects our ability to
defend the country?  NORQUIST: Well, first of all, this is a 10-year project,
sequestration.  HUNT: Right.  NORQUIST: And, no, we can always move money around. We
should do that. But we’re not going to undo the only budget
restraint this country - the only budget restraint this country
has is sequestration. To poke a hole in that is - would be a
mistake and won’t happen. The House isn’t going to do it. The
Senate isn’t going to do it. I understand that some people like
to say, I care about defense, I’ll spend more money.  Democrats
like to say, I care about welfare, I’ll spend more money.
Spending more money on welfare, more money on education doesn’t
always buy you welfare or education.  HUNT: And McCain and Graham you believe are out of step
with their party?  NORQUIST: Oh, yes, absolutely.  HUNT: Let’s turn to immigration. You are a supporter of a
comprehensive immigration bill and have been for a long time.
Let me get a prediction. Put on that really good Norquist
prediction hat. Will the House pass - different from the Senate,
but pass a bill that includes a pathway to citizenship?  NORQUIST: Within the next 9 to 12 months, I believe, yes,
that you’ll get a bill that has serious border security, more
serious and less expensive than the Senate’s version, and that
also has future flows. One of the problems we had in ’86 when we
had legislation was we didn’t make - there was no way for the
high-tech people to come here, no way for farm workers to come
here on a guest worker program. We need that. I think we’ll have
an expansion of what the Senate agreed to and that we’ll have
some legal status and a pathway to citizenship for the 10
million or 11 million who’ve come in over the years.  HUNT: Do you think a majority of  House Republicans  will
support something like you’ve just described?  NORQUIST: At the end of the day, yes, because there are
going to be many moving parts in this legislation, a lot of
which conservatives can be very, very happy with. And I think at
the end of the day that the pathway to citizenship that we’re
talking about for people who came here without papers is 10 to
15 years from now. This is not tomorrow.  HUNT: But you say 9 to 12 months, so we’re really talking
about well into next year when it passes, but this Congress?  NORQUIST: This Congress, yeah.  HUNT: OK. What would be the consequences for the  Republican
Party  if they were to kill an immigration bill in the House?  NORQUIST: Well, I think there are several challenges. One
is, the business community very much needs more high-tech
workers. The academic community, universities would like people
able to come here, study engineering, and then get a green card
to stay. It brings more of the talent in the world to study in
American universities.  HUNT: Right, that’s who wants it, but will there be
political implications if they kill - you don’t think they’re
going to kill the bill, but if they did, would there be
political implications?  NORQUIST: I think it would be unwise for the modern
Republican Party to come across as hostile to immigration. That
has been the losing position in American history for 200 years.
America being built by immigrants, it’s not just something we
say. It’s true. It’s who the country is -  HUNT: Let me turn - let me turn to 2016, because that’s
what you do in the summer of 2013.  NORQUIST: Of course.  HUNT: You have spoken favorably about Republican
presidential hopefuls Paul Ryan and  Scott Walker  and  Marco
Rubio .  NORQUIST: Yes.  HUNT: Would you also include New Jersey Governor  Chris
Christie ?  NORQUIST: Absolutely. I think Chris Christie is a
Northeastern Republican who has taken on the teachers’ unions
and made it clear, I’m not against education, I’m angry with the
teachers’ unions that are not delivering education.  HUNT: He has not signed your tax pledge.  NORQUIST: He has not, but he also hasn’t signed - he hasn’t
supported a tax increase.  HUNT: No, but would you - would you think he needs to sign
your tax pledge? Is that a requisite before -  NORQUIST: I think anybody who wants to run as a Republican
running for president would make it clear to the American people
one way or the other - the pledge is the obvious way - that they
want to rein in spending, not raise taxes.  HUNT: So he wouldn’t have to sign the pledge. He’d just
have to say he’s not going to raise taxes? Is that -  NORQUIST: You’d - in order to win the nomination, I believe
you’d have to make an incredible commitment - you can do it any
number of ways - the pledge has just been the obvious way to do
it, since everybody -  HUNT: So for Christie to win the nomination, he has to
pledge no - no tax increase?  NORQUIST: I think that’s probably the case.  HUNT: As you look at this whole field right now - it’s way
out, we know that - who looks like the most formidable to you?  NORQUIST: Well, for the first time in a long time, you have
five or six Republicans looking to run who have the credibility
because they have the track record and could raise the money to
run nationally for many, many months. It’s not one of those
things as - where if I don’t win in  New Hampshire , I’m finished.  HUNT: But right now, when you wake up in the morning, one
name that pops in your head, who would it be?  NORQUIST: There’s not one, but Scott Walker, Scott Walker,
who’s done incredible things in turning a blue state red in
 Wisconsin , has taken on the labor union bosses, has cut
spending, has been pro-growth.  You have  Paul Ryan  in a similar
category.  HUNT: But you don’t - you don’t think Paul Ryan’s going to
run, do you?  NORQUIST: I think Paul Ryan is more likely to stay in the
House and pass the Ryan budget. He’s young enough, he can run
for president any time over the next 20 years.  HUNT: OK. Grover Norquist, you are young enough and you’re
always interesting. Thank you so much for being with us.  NORQUIST: Sure.  ***END OF TRANSCRIPT***  THIS TRANSCRIPT MAY NOT BE 100% ACCURATE AND MAY CONTAIN
