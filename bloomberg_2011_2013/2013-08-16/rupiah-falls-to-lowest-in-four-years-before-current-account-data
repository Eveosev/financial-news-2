The rupiah touched a four-year low
after  Indonesia ’s foreign reserves fell to the least since 2010
and before data today that may show the current-account deficit
widened to a record.  Foreign-currency reserves  dropped for a third month to
$92.7 billion in July, the least since October 2010, data showed
on Aug. 14. The current-account deficit may be about $9 billion
in the three months through June,  Bank Indonesia  Deputy Governor
Perry Warjiyo said this month before data due today. That would
be the largest  shortfall  in data going back to 1989. The central
bank held its  reference rate   at 6.5 percent yesterday, as
expected by 16 of 25 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  “Bank Indonesia has become more tolerant of the rupiah
trading lower,” said  Gundy Cahyadi , an economist at Oversea-Chinese Banking Corp. in  Singapore . “The main problem is the
current-account position, which increasingly looks like it will
stay for a while and isn’t easily solved by monetary policy
alone.”  The currency fell 0.2 percent to 10,373 per dollar as of
10:16 a.m. in Jakarta, according to prices from local banks. It
touched 10,374 earlier, the weakest level since June 2009. The
rupiah declined 0.9 percent this week, the biggest drop since
the five days ended July 26. The spot rate traded at a 2.5
percent premium to the one-month non-deliverable forwards, which
declined 2.1 percent this week and 0.6 percent today to 10,636,
data compiled by Bloomberg show.  A  fixing  by the Association of Banks in Singapore used to
settle the derivative contracts was set at 10,319 yesterday,
compared with 10,293 on Aug. 5. Local markets were closed for
Eid al-Fitr last week. One-month implied volatility, a measure
of expected moves in the  exchange rate  used to price options,
fell 55 basis points, or 0.55 percentage point, this week to
11.54 percent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The yield on  government bonds  due May 2023 rose 50 basis
points this week to 8.07 percent, set for the worst week since
the five days through July 12, data from the the Inter Dealer
Market Association show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
