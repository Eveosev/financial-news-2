Coffee farmers and middlemen in
 Vietnam , the world’s largest producer of the robusta variety,
are holding back 13 percent of the current crop, according to
Amsterdam-based trader  Nedcoffee BV .  Growers and local dealers had 198,414 metric tons of coffee
as of Aug. 1, said the trader, which has offices in Ho Chi Minh
City, Vietnam. The Southeast Asian nation is marketing its
2012-13 crop that ends in September. Carry-over stocks may be
180,912 tons and the country will probably have 87,289 tons a
month to export in August and September, Nedcoffee estimates.  Robusta coffee traded in London declined for four
consecutive months from March to June, prompting some growers to
withdraw sales offers. Prices fell after rains returned to
Vietnam, easing concerns that a drought earlier this year would
cut production for the 2013-14 crop starting in October.  “Farmers have a positive outlook on the next crop,” said
Nedcoffee. “On average, the estimate is ranging between 10
percent to 15 percent higher versus the current crop.”  In  Indonesia , the third-biggest robusta grower, farmers
have harvested 66 percent, or 220,430 tons, of the 2013-14 crop
that started in April, estimated the trader, which has a factory
there that stores as much as 300,000 bags. A bag of coffee
weighs 132 pounds.  Bean deliveries from farms were 169,322 tons, with 135,332
tons arriving in Bandar Lampung, where the country’s main coffee
export port is located. Deliveries from this crop are “much
lower” because dry weather delayed bean-drying, Nedcoffee said.  Robusta coffee for delivery in November was 0.5 percent
lower at $1,908 a ton by 4:11 p.m. in London.  To contact the reporter on this story:
