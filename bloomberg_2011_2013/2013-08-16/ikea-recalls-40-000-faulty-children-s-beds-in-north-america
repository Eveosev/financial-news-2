Ikea, the world’s biggest furniture
retailer, recalled two models of junior beds in the U.S. and
 Canada  on concern they can break and cause laceration injuries.  The recall of  Kritter  and Sniglar beds follows reports of
incidents where a metal rod that connects the guard rail to the
bed frame has snapped, the Swedish company said in a statement.  “This can result in partial detachment of the guard rail
and exposed sharp metal edges that present a laceration
hazard,” Ikea said.  No injuries have been reported, according to the retailer,
which sells the beds on its U.S. website for $89 and $59,
respectively.  Owners of the faulty products will receive a free repair
kit containing a replacement metal rod, tools and instruction
sheet, Ikea said in the statement.  The recall concerns 22,000 beds in the U.S. and 18,000 in
Canada. The products were made in  Poland , Bosnia Herzegovina and
 Romania , according to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
