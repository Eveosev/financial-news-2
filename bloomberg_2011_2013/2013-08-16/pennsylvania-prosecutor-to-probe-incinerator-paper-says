Pennsylvania  Attorney General
Kathleen Kane is planning a criminal probe into activities
surrounding the Harrisburg trash-to-energy plant, the local
 Patriot-News  newspaper reported.  Kane wouldn’t discuss specifics in a meeting with the
paper’s editors, according to the report. Dennis Fisher, a
spokesman for Kane, said in an interview today he couldn’t
comment on a possible investigation.  Harrisburg, with about 50,000 residents, has been grappling
with a financial crisis caused in part by $300 million in debt
tied to expansion of the incinerator system, which doesn’t
produce enough revenue.  State receiver William B. Lynch was pushing for tax
increases in a city with a 30 percent poverty rate. He also
planned to sell municipal assets, including the incinerator.  Harrisburg tried to restructure its debt under Chapter 9 of
the U.S.  Bankruptcy Code , which covers municipalities. Its case
was thrown out in November 2011 after a federal bankruptcy judge
found the filing wasn’t authorized under state law.  The receiver case is Walker v. Harrisburg Authority, 569-MD-2011, Pennsylvania Commonwealth Court, Pennsylvania
(Harrisburg).  To contact the reporter on this story:
