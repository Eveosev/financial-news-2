Tokyo Electric Power Co. (9501)  will
attempt to persuade fishermen to agree on a plan to reroute
water away from the Fukushima atomic station and into the ocean
to reduce the buildup of radiated water around the plant.  The bypass pipe aims to siphon off some of the water
seeping into the plant from surrounding hillsides, where it’s
being contaminated by radiation leaks from three melted
reactors. At least 300 tons of radiated water a day is pouring
into the Pacific Ocean, the government said last week.  Fishermen’s groups have been suspicious of the plan, which
Tepco has said will only carry clean mountain water. In August
last year, the utility found record levels of radioactive cesium
in fish it caught for tests within 20 kilometers (12 miles) of
the coast from the nuclear plant.  Officials from the utility will meet with members of four
fishermen’s groups between Aug. 20 and Aug. 28, Mayumi Yoshida,
a spokeswoman for the company known as Tepco, said today in a
phone interview. She didn’t know the identities of the Tepco
officials who’ll participate.  A call to the Fukushima Prefectural Federation of Fisheries
Co-operative Associations seeking comment wasn’t answered.  To contact the reporters on this story:
