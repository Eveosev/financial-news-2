Yahoo! Inc. (YHOO)  said it’s appointing
 Maynard Webb  as chairman, as Chief Executive Officer  Marissa Mayer  continues a turnaround effort of the Internet company.  Webb, who joined Yahoo’s board in February 2012, was
serving on an interim basis after  Fred Amoroso  resigned as
chairman in April.  Yahoo, which has weathered a series of management and board
changes in the past two years, is adding tools and services to
help woo users and advertising dollars under Mayer, who joined
the Sunnyvale, California-based company in July 2012.  “Maynard Webb’s leadership and guidance have been an
invaluable part of our board since he joined it in 2012,” said
Anne Espiritu, a spokeswoman for Yahoo. “We are honored that
Maynard will continue to serve as chairman of the board.”  Webb is a longtime Silicon Valley executive. He was CEO of
LiveOps Inc., a provider of cloud contact center services, from
2006 to 2011. Prior to his time there, Webb served as the chief
operating officer of online marketplace  EBay Inc. (EBAY)   As part of Mayer’s push, she has spent more than $1.2
billion to buy at least 20 startups in a shopping spree focused
on bringing top engineering talent back to Yahoo.  Earlier this month, Yahoo bought Rockmelt Inc., a developer
of Web-browsing software. The company in May also said it agreed
to acquire blogging platform Tumblr Inc. for $1.1 billion.  To contact the reporter on this story:
