Spot wholesale electricity rose from
Maine to Virginia as demand increased.  Consumers were using more power in New York City than the
state grid operator had predicted. Demand was also higher in New
England and on the 13-state PJM Interconnection LLC network
stretching from  New Jersey  into North Carolina and Illinois.  Temperatures were more seasonal today in those regions
following cooler readings the previous three days, according to
AccuWeather Inc. in  State College , Pennsylvania.  Boston  was
expected to have a seasonal high of 80 degrees Fahrenheit (27
Celsius) while Chicago’s reading was forecast to be 4 lower than
the average at 78.  Spot on-peak power  for Boston gained $4.56, or 17 percent,
to $31.89 a megawatt-hour as of 4:14 p.m. from yesterday’s full-day average of $27.32, which was the least since Aug. 5, grid
data compiled by Bloomberg showed.  On-peak hours are Monday
through Friday from 7 a.m. until 11 p.m.  ISO New England Inc. said  power consumption  on the six-state grid it manages was 17,265 megawatts at 3:40 p.m., topping
yesterday’s  average  of 17,091 megawatts in that hour.  The discount for Boston prices versus  New York  City
narrowed to $3.64 from $4.51 yesterday. New York City’s on-peak
average rose $3.70, or 12 percent, to $35.53.  Electricity for the PJM grid, which serves more than 60
million people from Washington to Chicago, reversed earlier
losses and gained for the first time in five days.  Spot on-peak prices  at the benchmark Western hub advanced
$3.40, or 12 percent, to $31.76 a megawatt hour as of 4:14 p.m.  Increased demand also bolstered prices across  California 
while power prices dropped in  Texas  amid below-normal
temperatures.  To contact the reporter on this story:
