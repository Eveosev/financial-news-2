Canadian  factory sales  unexpectedly
fell in June, with the third decline in four months underlining
the struggles faced by exporters in rebuilding sales even as the
 U.S. economy  shows signs of strengthening.  Sales fell 0.5 percent to C$48.2 billion ($46.9 billion),
Statistics Canada said today in Ottawa. Economists forecast a
0.3 percent increase according to the median estimate in a
Bloomberg  survey  with 16 responses.  Factory sales have declined 3.7 percent over the last year,
hampered by a recession in the  euro zone  and a modest recovery
in demand from the U.S., which buys three-quarters of Canada’s
exports. Shipments to the U.S. aren’t gaining as much as they
have in past recoveries, said  Krishen Rangasamy , senior
economist at National Bank Financial in  Montreal .  “The export response to U.S. activity is different than
what it was in the past,” Rangasamy said in a telephone
interview. “The Canadian dollar has strengthened quite a bit in
the past 10 years and that has contributed to us losing market
share in the U.S.”  The Canadian dollar depreciated 0.4 percent to C$1.0347 per
 U.S. dollar  at 11:32 a.m. in Toronto. One Canadian dollar buys
96.65 U.S. cents.  Output growth in the U.S. accelerated to a 1.7 percent
annualized pace in the second quarter from 0.1 percent at the
end of last year.  Widespread Declines  Even with faster U.S. growth, sales fell in 16 of 21
 categories  tracked by  Statistics Canada  in June, accounting for
56 percent of production. Wood products fell 7.7 percent to
C$1.88 billion, while jewelry and silverware led a 20 percent
decline in the miscellaneous category to C$902 million.  Sales excluding motor vehicles and parts decreased 0.6
percent to C$41.9 billion, Statistics Canada said.  Today’s report didn’t show much impact from flooding in
 Alberta  at the end of June. Sales in that province rose 0.1
percent to C$6.13 billion, while shipments declined 1.9 percent
to C$22.2 billion in Ontario, the largest manufacturing
province.  Excluding price changes, a better indicator of the
industry’s contribution to economic growth, factory sales fell
1.3 percent.  Unfilled orders rose 2.7 percent on the month to C$73.2
billion. Inventories fell 0.2 percent to C$68.6 billion, leaving
the ratio of factory stockpiles to sales unchanged at 1.42. New
orders rose 2.5 percent to C$50.1 billion.  To contact the reporter on this story:
