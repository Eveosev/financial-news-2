Opera Software ASA (OPERA) , the Norwegian
maker of Internet browsers, rose the most in more than 14 months
in Oslo trading amid optimism over growing sales in its mobile
operator business.  The shares in the Oslo-based company rose as much as 14
percent, the most since May 29, 2012, and were up 12.5 percent
at 54 kroner as of 2:13 p.m. in the Norwegian capital, making it
the  biggest mover  on the Bloomberg European Internet Index. More
than 1 million shares have traded so far today, more than  five
times  the three-month average daily volume.  Opera, whose cross-platform Internet browser competes with
those of Apple Inc., Google Inc. and Microsoft Corp., is seeking
to boost sales by targeting a growing mobile-phone data market
that will see 5 billion smartphone users by 2016.  Cloud-based operator data and license sales rose 61 percent
to $14.8 million in the second-quarter, Opera said in a
statement today. That compares with a 12 percent decline in
sales during 2012. Group sales rose to $73 million in the
quarter from $52 million a year earlier.  “Focus should clearly be on the operator side,” Espen Torgersen, an analyst at Carnegie ASA, said by phone. The
“substantial” growth in sales to operators eased investor
concerns on operator sales and that it may have overpaid when it
bought Skyfire Labs Inc. in February, he said.  He has a buy rating.  Opera raised sales guidance for the year to $290 million to
$298 million from the $280 million to $295 million range it
guided in the first quarter, the company said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
