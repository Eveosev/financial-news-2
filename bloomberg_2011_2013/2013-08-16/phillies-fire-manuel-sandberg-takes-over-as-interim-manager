The Philadelphia Phillies fired
manager Charlie Manuel and said Ryne Sandberg would lead the
club for the rest of the season.  The Phillies are 53-67 and are headed to what would be
their first losing season in Manuelâ€™s nine-year tenure. The club
won the World Series in 2008, their first in 28 years, under
Manuel.  Sandberg, a Hall of Fame second baseman who played for the
Chicago Cubs, had been the Phillies third base coach.  To contact the reporter on this story:
