Spanish bonds led gains in European
 government securities  before euro-area services and
manufacturing data next week that economists said will add to
evidence the region’s recovery is gaining momentum.  The extra yield investors demand to hold  Spain ’s 10-year
bonds instead of Germany’s shrank below 2.5 percentage points
for the first time since July 2011 as demand for higher-yielding
assets increased. Italian  10-year yields  fell toward the lowest
since June after reports today showed euro-area exports rose and
inflation held below the  European Central Bank ’s 2 percent
target. German 10-year  yields  were within four basis points of a
16-month high as demand for safer investments waned.  “There’s a positive dynamic in the market,  risk aversion 
has reduced,” said Ralf Umlauf, a research analyst at Helaba
Hessen-Thueringen in  Frankfurt . “The data next week should show
that this positive development will continue. We believe that
the Spanish bonds will continue to rally.”  Spain’s 10-year yield fell nine basis points, or 0.09
percentage point, to 4.36 percent at 4:44 p.m. London time, the
 lowest level  since May 31. The 4.4 percent bond maturing in
October 2023 rose 0.735, or 7.35 euros per 1,000-euro ($1,332)
face amount, to 100.34.  The yield premium over German bunds shrank eight basis
points to 248 basis points. The spread surged to 650 basis
points in July 2012 as the  European debt crisis  worsened.  The  Italian 10-year yield  fell six basis points to 4.19
percent after declining to 4.15 percent on Aug. 13, the lowest
since June 6.  Services, Manufacturing  A composite index of services and manufacturing activity in
the euro area increased to 50.9 in August from 50.5 in July,
according to a Bloomberg survey before the Aug. 22 report from
Markit Economics. Exports rose a seasonally adjusted 3 percent
in June from May, the European Union’s statistics office said.
The annual consumer-price  inflation rate  held at 1.6 percent in
July, a separate report showed.  Germany ’s 10-year yield was little changed at 1.87 percent
after climbing to 1.91 percent yesterday, the highest level
since March 2012. The rate has increased 19 basis points  this
week , the most since the period ended June 21.  French  10-year yields  dropped two basis points to 2.40
percent, trimming their weekly increase to 16 basis points.
Similar-maturity Dutch yields were little changed at 2.25
percent. The rate has climbed 19 basis points this week.  Improving Outlook  “The increase in bond yields in the core market is driven
by a perception that the economic outlook in the euro area has
improved,” said Marchel Alexandrovich, a senior European
economist at Jefferies International Ltd. in  London . “I’m not
sure if they will rise much further from here as the economic
recovery is still very tentative. The yields seem to front-run
the economy.”  Accelerating growth in the U.S., the world’s largest
economy, has helped the euro region begin to recover. Housing
starts  climbed  5.9 percent to an 896,000 annualized rate from a
revised 846,000 pace in June that was higher than initially
reported, the Commerce Department said in  Washington .  Volatility on Spanish bonds was the highest in euro-area
markets today followed by those of Belgium and  Finland ,
according to measures of 10-year debt, the yield spread between
two- and 10-year securities, and credit-default swaps.  Spanish bonds returned 7.8 percent this year through
yesterday, according to Bloomberg World Bond Indexes. Italian
securities rose 4.3 percent, while German bonds lost investors
2.4 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
