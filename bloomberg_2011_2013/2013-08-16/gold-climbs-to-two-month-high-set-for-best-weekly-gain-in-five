Gold rose to the highest in almost
two months and silver capped the biggest weekly rally since 2008
on signs of higher physical demand for precious metals.  Global bar and coin purchases reached a record last quarter
and jewelry usage rose to the most since 2008, World Gold
Council figures showed this week. Thirteen analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg expect the metal to rise next week, four were bearish
and five neutral, the highest proportion of bulls since March 8.
Holdings in exchange-traded products backed by silver reached an
all-time high yesterday, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Purchases for gold and silver are climbing as lower prices
attract consumers after both metals fell into bear markets in
April. Gold has rebounded 16 percent since reaching the cheapest
in 34 months in June, while silver yesterday entered a  bull
market , settling 24 percent above its bear-market low. Sales of
American Eagle  silver coins  by the  U.S. Mint  were 31 million
ounces so far this year, compared with 33.7 million ounces sold
in all of 2012, data on the website show.  “The rally that we are seeing is being supported by the
buoyant physical demand,” Sterling Smith, a Chicago-based
commodity futures specialist at Citigroup Inc., said in a
telephone interview. “The mood is definitely bullish.”  Gold futures for December delivery added 0.7 percent to
settle at $1,371 an ounce at 1:48 p.m. on the Comex in New York.
Prices reached $1,379.20 after the close of regular trading, the
highest since June 18. The precious metal gained 4.5 percent
this week, the most since July 12.  JPMorgan Outlook  Demand in  India  and labor concerns in  South Africa  may
boost prices in the next four to five weeks before an industry
conference in Denver, JPMorgan Chase & Co. said in a report
dated yesterday.  Futures have fallen 18 percent this year as some investors
lost faith in the metal as a store of value. Holdings in gold
ETPs are down 26 percent hits year, wiping $55.5 billion from
the value of the assets. Last quarter, billionaire  John Paulson 
cut his stake in the SPDR Gold Trust, the biggest-bullion ETP,
by 53 percent, a government filing showed this week.  Silver futures for December delivery climbed 1.7 percent to
$23.372 an ounce in New York, capping a gain of 15 percent this
week, the most since September 2008. Prices touched $23.445
after the settlement, the highest since May 15.  On the  New York Mercantile Exchange , platinum futures for
October delivery fell 0.3 percent to $1,527.60 an ounce. The
price has dropped 1 percent this year.  Palladium futures for September delivery rose 0.8 percent
to $763.05 an ounce, extending the year’s gain to 8.5 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
