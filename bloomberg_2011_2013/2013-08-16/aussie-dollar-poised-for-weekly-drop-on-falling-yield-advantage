Australia ’s dollar was set for a
weekly decline before the  Reserve Bank  releases minutes of its
Aug. 6 meeting next week amid speculation the central bank will
give guidance on further reductions to  interest rates .  The  extra yield  that investors can get by holding
Australia’s 10-year government debt instead of U.S. Treasuries
was 17 basis points from the lowest in six years. The  New
Zealand dollar  was poised for a second weekly advance as BNP
Paribas SA recommended buying the currency on expectations the
nation’s central bank will turn more hawkish.  “The RBA’s been cutting rates, and the interest-rate
differential has narrowed,” said Janu Chan, an economist at St.
George Bank Ltd. in Sydney. “We expect the Aussie to fall.”  The Australian dollar slid 0.1 percent to 91.35 U.S. cents
as of 10:14 a.m. in Sydney, extending its decline since Aug. 9
to 0.8 percent. The kiwi was little changed at 80.74 U.S. cents,
having risen 0.5 percent this week.  Ten-year bond yields climbed four basis points to 3.94
percent after reaching 3.97 percent, the highest July 8. Three-year yields gained three basis points to 2.71 percent after
touching 2.74%, a level unseen since July 10.  To contact the reporter on this story:
