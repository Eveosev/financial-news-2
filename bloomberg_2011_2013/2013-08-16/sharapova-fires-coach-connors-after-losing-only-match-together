Maria Sharapova  has fired coach
 Jimmy Connors  after one match together, ending a 34-day
partnership between the third-ranked woman in tennis and the
eight-time men’s Grand Slam champion.  Sharapova hired Connors, 60, in mid-July after splitting
with coach Thomas Hogstedt. She lost to Sloane Stephens in her
first match in the Western & Southern Open in Cincinnati this
week after missing more than a month with a hip injury.  “It’s not the right fit for this time in my career,”
Sharapova, 26, from Russia, said in a statement e-mailed to
tennis.com.  Sharapova has won each of the four Grand Slam tournaments
and has 29 career titles on the Women’s Tennis Association Tour
and almost $27 million in career winnings.  The  U.S. Open , the last of those four annual major
tournaments, begins Aug. 26 in New York.  To contact the reporter on this story:
