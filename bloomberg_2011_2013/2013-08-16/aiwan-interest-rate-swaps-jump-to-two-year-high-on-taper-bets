Taiwan ’s interest-rate swaps rose to
a two-year high and government bonds fell on speculation the
Federal Reserve will start cutting stimulus next month.  Five-year interest-rate contracts have climbed 34 basis
points since Fed Chairman Ben S. Bernanke said on May 22 that
the central bank could pare its debt purchases, compared with a
24 basis point increase in benchmark five-year bond yields.
Global funds sold $193 million more Taiwanese shares than they
bought this week, taking net sales this month to $1.4 billion,
according to exchange data.  “Trading volumes on interest-rate swaps have been higher
than bonds recently, which is quite unusual for Taiwan,” said
Albert Lee, a fixed-income trader in Taipei at Cathay United
Bank Co. “Traders are going to use  interest-rate swaps  to bet
on rising yields in the near future, as bond liquidity is just
really low now.”  The five-year swaps rose one basis point to 1.385 percent
as of 4:28 p.m. in Taipei and touched 1.39 percent earlier, the
highest level since May 2011, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The rate rose six basis points, or 0.06 percentage
point, this week.  The yield on the 0.875 percent notes due January 2018
advanced one basis point today and five basis points this week
to 1.169 percent, according to Gretai Securities Market.  Sixty-five percent of economists surveyed by Bloomberg
expect the Fed to reduce $85 billion of monthly bond buying that
has driven fund flows to  emerging markets  in September.  Taiwan Dollar  The Taiwan dollar strengthened 0.1 percent today to
NT$30.002 against its U.S. counterpart, Taipei Forex Inc. prices
show. The currency weakened 0.2 percent from Aug. 9. The central
bank has sold its currency in the run-up to the close on most
days since March 2012, according to traders who asked not to be
identified.  One-month non-deliverable forwards rose 0.2 percent today
and this week to NT$29.862 per dollar, data compiled by
Bloomberg show. One-month implied volatility, a gauge of
expected moves in the exchange rate used to price options,
gained four basis points today to 3.47 percent.  The  overnight interbank lending rate  was little changed at
0.384 percent today and this week, a weighted average compiled
by the Taiwan Interbank Money Center showed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
