The Mexican homebuilding  industry  is
among the nation’s most-exposed sectors to the outcome of U.S.
budget negotiations, Standard & Poor’s analyst Eduardo Uribe
said.  Spending cuts and tax increases totaling more than $600
billion will start taking effect next year, potentially
triggering a recession in the world’s biggest market, if U.S.
lawmakers fail to reach an accord.  “If the economy deteriorates, it could block their access
to financing” and leave them with a backup in inventory, Uribe
said in a telephone interview today from Mexico City. The
industry “depends on external financing for growth and
refinancing.”  Sare Holding SAB (SAREB)  and  Urbi Desarrollos Urbanos SAB (URBI*)  are among
the Mexican companies that would be most affected if the budget
fallout crimps growth, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
