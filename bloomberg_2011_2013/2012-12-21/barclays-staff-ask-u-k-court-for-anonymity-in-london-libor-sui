Barclays Plc (BARC)  traders and employees
who made submissions to set  interest rates  applied to a U.K.
court asking for anonymity in the U.K.’s first civil lawsuit
related to manipulation of the London interbank offered rate.  A hearing is scheduled for Jan. 21 to decide whether the
bank’s staff implicated in the suit, filed by Guardian Care
Homes Ltd. over a loss-making interest rate swap tied to the
benchmark, can remain anonymous, according to court spokeswoman
Rachael Collins in London.  Barclays was ordered to give affiliates of Guardian Care
the identities of 208 employees named in the bank’s disclosure
to regulators over the Libor-rigging allegations.  Guardian sued over the swap that cost it about 12 million
pounds ($19 million), saying Libor -- the baseline for about
$300 trillion of contracts worldwide -- can’t be trusted. In
June, the lender was fined a record 290 million pounds after
regulators found its investment bankers tried to manipulate the
interest rate.  Kevin Roberts , a lawyer at Morrison & Foerster LLP
representing some of the workers, didn’t immediately return a
phone call and e-mail seeking comment., Jon Laycock, a Barclays
spokesman, declined to comment.  The case is Graiseley Properties Ltd. & Ors. v. Barclays
Bank Plc,  High Court  of Justice, Queen’s Bench Division
Commercial Court, No. 12-1259.  To contact the reporter on this story:
