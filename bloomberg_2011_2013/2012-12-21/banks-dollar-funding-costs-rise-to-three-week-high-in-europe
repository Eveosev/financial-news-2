The cost for European banks to
borrow in dollars rose to the highest in more than three weeks,
according to a money-markets indicator.  The three-month cross-currency  basis swap , the rate banks
pay to convert euro interest payments into dollars, was 26.5
basis points below the euro interbank offered rate at 8:15 a.m.,
from minus 25 yesterday, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The measure is the costliest since Nov. 28.  The one-year basis swap was 26 basis points below Euribor
from minus 25 yesterday. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  A measure of European banks’ reluctance to make unsecured
loans to one another rose to the highest in a week. The
difference between Euribor and overnight index swaps, known as
the Euribor-OIS spread, was 12.2 basis points from 12 yesterday.  The European Banking Federation’s euro overnight index
average, or Eonia, of unsecured lending deals was set at 0.069
percent yesterday from 0.07 percent the day before. The Eonia
swap, an estimate of average overnight borrowing costs over the
next three months, was little changed at 6.1 basis points.  Lenders cut  overnight deposits  at the European Central Bank
yesterday to 231 billion euros ($305 billion) from 233 billion
euros the day before.  To contact the reporter on this story:
