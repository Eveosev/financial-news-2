A bank employee in  Germany ’s capital
has been taken hostage inside a branch by an intruder, police
said.  “A perpetrator is holding a bank employee hostage inside
the branch office,” Berlin police press spokeswoman Diane Born
said by telephone. The identity of the man wasn’t known.  The bank is located at Potsdamer Strasse 54 in Berlin
Zehlendorf. Focus online reported that the branch belonged to
 Deutsche Bank AG. (DBK)  Roland Weichert, Deutsche bank spokesman,
declined to comment.  Police were informed just before 4 p.m. that a perpetrator
inside the bank had taken an employee hostage, said Berlin
police spokesman Thomas Neuendorf. The remaining bank employees
were able to leave the building through one of the upper floors,
he said.  Police are in contact with the intruder who demanded cash
and safe passage. Neuendorf declined to comment on a possible
bomb threat or weapons the man might be carrying because of
police tactical strategy reasons. He added that the police are
trying to maintain contact with the person and ensure that the
situation ends in an “unproblematic way.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
