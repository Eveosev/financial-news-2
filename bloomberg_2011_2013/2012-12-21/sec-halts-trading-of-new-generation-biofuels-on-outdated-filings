The U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission filed a civil action against Lee S. Rosen, the former
chairman of  New Generation Biofuels Holdings Inc. (NGBF) , alleging he
fraudulently avoided reporting his ownership interest in the
company.  Rosen will settle with the SEC without admitting or denying
the allegations, according to an agency  statement  today. Rosen
will pay a total of $911,484 in fines and will be barred from
serving as a company’s officer or director.  The complaint alleges that in addition to receiving
$666,000 in direct payments, he “indirectly benefited from
using New Generation shares held in two trusts as partial
payment in an effort to purchase a yacht.”  The SEC earlier suspended trading of Columbia, Maryland-
based New Generation Biofuels, citing the company’s lack of
public disclosures since the period ending June 30, 2011.  The shares closed yesterday at 0.4 cents and have declined
47 percent this year.  A phone message left for Bryan McPhee, a company spokesman,
wasn’t returned. An e-mail sent to him couldn’t be delivered.
Previous filings said the company makes biofuels from oils and
animal fats.  To contact the reporter on this story:
