Total SA (FP)  and China National
Petroleum Corp. agreed to join  Tethys Petroleum Ltd. (TPL) , an
explorer focusing on Central Asia, to search for oil and gas in
Tajikistan. Tethys shares jumped.  Total and China National Oil and Gas Exploration and
Development Corp., a unit of CNPC, will each hold a third of the
Bokhtar project, Tethys said today in a statement. The new
partners will pay about $60 million to Tethys to refund about
two-thirds of historical costs and will carry some of its future
spending.  Tethys shares  jumped 31 percent to 34.50 pence in  London ,
the biggest gain since October 2011.  “The initial work program is expected to comprise of
further seismic data acquisition followed by a deep exploration
well,” Tethys said. The completion is subject to final Tajik
governmental approval.  The Bokhtar license may hold an estimated 27.5 billion
barrels of oil equivalent resources, according to a report from
June 30, Tethys said. It first announced plans to bring in
partners on Oct. 26.  The Bokhtar contract area covers 35,000 square kilometres
(13,500 square miles) at the eastern end of the Amu Darya Basin,
Total said in a separate  statement . “A number of giant gas
discoveries have already been made in the basin.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
