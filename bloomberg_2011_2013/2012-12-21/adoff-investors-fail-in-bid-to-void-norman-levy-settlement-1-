Investors in Bernard Madoff’s Ponzi
scheme failed to show that a trustee’s $220 million settlement
with the heirs of customer  Norman Levy  should be voided, a
federal appeals court said, affirming a lower court ruling.  The investors argued that the settlement didn’t take into
account $100 billion in transactions between Levy and Madoff’s
firm, which they alleged helped to finance the Ponzi scheme. In
a ruling today, the U.S. Court of Appeals in Manhattan found
that the transfers “could not have altered the possible
exposure to liability of the Levy heirs.”  Irving Picard , the trustee liquidating Madoff’s firm,
settled with Levy’s family and estate in 2010 for $220 million,
the amount of their alleged profits from the scheme. Levy, a
close associate of Madoff, died in 2005 at age 93.  A lawyer for the investors, Helen Davis Chaitman, didn’t
immediately return a phone call seeking comment on the ruling.  The case is Peshkin v. Levy-Church, 12-816, U.S. Court of
Appeals for the Second Circuit (Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
