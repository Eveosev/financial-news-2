Signa Holding, a property investor
managed by Austrian Rene Benko, agreed to buy 17 German
department stores, including the country’s largest, for 1.1
billion euros ($1.45 billion) from investors that include
 Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)   The stores are leased to retailer Karstadt Warenhaus GmbH
and the transaction will be completed next year, Richard Speich,
a spokesman for the investment group called Highstreet that’s
selling the stores, said today. The biggest of the 17 properties
is the historic KaDeWe store in Berlin.  Companies outside of  Germany  are buying real estate in the
country’s large cities to gain safer investments as the euro
region copes with a recession. Retail rents in the second half
of 2012 rose 13 percent in Berlin and 7 percent in Cologne,
according to data compiled by Chicago-based broker  Jones Lang
LaSalle Inc. (JLL)   Highstreet is made up of Goldman Sachs’ Whitehall Street
Real Estate Funds,  Deutsche Bank AG (DBK) ’s  RREEF Real Estate (GRNDBIN) 
affiliate,  Prelios SpA (PRS)  and Generali Real Estate Fund SA. Signa
is an Austrian investment firm with 4.5 billion euros in assets
that last year tried to acquire German department store chain
Kaufhof.  To contact the reporters on this story:
