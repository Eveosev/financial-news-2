Vietnam’s five-year bonds had the
best week in a month on speculation inflation that’s almost half
the average of the past two years will give the central bank
more room to lower  interest rates . The dong was steady.  The  State Bank  of Vietnam will reduce borrowing costs in
the next few days, Thoi Bao Kinh Te Saigon reported Dec. 18,
citing Prime Minister Nguyen Tan Dung. A Ministry of Planning
and Investment report, which put monthly inflation in December
below 0.5 percent and annual  inflation  in 2012 near 7 percent,
provided sufficient support for a rate cut, the newspaper cited
Dung as saying. Consumer prices rose 7.08 percent in November
from a year earlier, compared with an average pace of 14.2
percent in the 24 months through Nov. 30, official data show.  “That’s a very strong signal for the market,” said Tran Kieu Hung, a Hanoi-based bond trader at Bank for Investment &
Development of  Vietnam .  The yield on five-year bonds fell eight basis points, or
0.08 percentage point, this week to 9.73 percent, according to a
daily fixing rate from banks compiled by Bloomberg. That’s the
lowest level since Aug. 23 and the largest weekly decline since
the five-day period ending Nov. 23. The yield fell eight basis
points today.  The dong traded at 20,855 per dollar as of 2:51 p.m. in
Hanoi, compared with 20,848 a week earlier, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. It was little changed from yesterday. The
State Bank of Vietnam set its  reference rate  at 20,828,
unchanged since Dec. 26, according to its website. The currency
is allowed to trade up to 1 percent on either side of the rate.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
