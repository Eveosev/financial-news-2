Morgan Stanley (MS)  said a portfolio
based on its currency recommendations returned 5.72 percent this
year, the best performance since 2008.  The returns were based on 45 trades held for an average of
38 days each, the New York-based bank said in a note to clients.
The best recommendations were to buy the Russian ruble against
the yen from Oct. 23 to Dec. 14, which returned 7.1 percent, and
to purchase the dollar versus Japan’s currency from Sept. 25 to
Dec. 14, which gained 6.6 percent, Morgan Stanley said.  The worst-performing trade was to bet the pound would
weaken versus the ruble between Aug. 15 and Aug. 30, which lost
2.3 percent. A prediction the Australian dollar would depreciate
against the yen from July 13 to July 27 lost 2.1 percent.  “We still believe several of our best-performing trades,
particularly those funded in yen, have further to gain over the
coming year, and we will look to re-establish strategies along
this line in the new year,” strategists in the global currency
research team led by  Hans Redeker  in  London , wrote in the note
published yesterday.  The yen has tumbled 12.4 percent this year, the worst
performer of 10 developed-nation currencies tracked by Bloomberg
Correlation-Weighted Indexes. The euro declined 1.1 percent and
the dollar fell 3.2 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
