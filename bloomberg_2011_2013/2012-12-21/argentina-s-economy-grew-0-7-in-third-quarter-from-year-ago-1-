Argentina ’s economy grew 0.7 percent
in the third quarter from a year earlier, less than forecast by
analysts and after stalling in the previous three months.  The median estimate of 11 economists surveyed by Bloomberg
was for growth of 1.4 percent.  South America ’s second-biggest
economy expanded 0.6 percent from the second quarter, the
national statistics agency reported today in Buenos Aires.  The economy returned to growth in the third quarter after
grinding to a standstill in the previous three months, when the
global crisis and weaker demand from neighboring  Brazil  led to a
drop in  industrial output . The economy also suffered from a
drought in some agriculture areas and floods in others.  The government of President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner
forecasts growth of 3.3 percent this year and 4.4 percent in
2013, according to next year’s budget law. The  World Bank  sees
the economy growing 2.2 percent in 2012, compared with 8.9
percent in 2011.  The peso, whose rate is managed by the central bank, has
weakened 12.3 percent this year, the most of any currency in the
region. In the unregulated market, in which investors buy assets
locally in pesos and sell them abroad for dollars, the peso has
dropped 29 percent.  Argentinaa’s  trade surplus  widened 74 percent in November
from a year earlier to $634 million after the government
tightened import restrictions, the statistics agency also
reported today. The country posted a current account surplus of
$1.13 billion in the third quarter, compared with a deficit of
$214 million the year earlier.  To contact the reporter on this story:
