Argentina ’s  trade surplus  was $634
million in November compared with $364 million in the same month
last year, the national statistics institute said.  The median estimate of 10 economists surveyed by Bloomberg
was for a surplus of $365 million.  Exports fell 2 percent from a year earlier to $6.46
billion, while imports fell 6 percent to $5.83 billion over the
same period, the agency said in Buenos Aires today.  Earlier this month, Argentina filed complaints with the
 World Trade Organization  against the U.S. for blocking imports
of beef and lemons and against the European Union for
restricting biodiesel imports.  South America’s second-biggest economy is considering an
additional complaint against Europe’s agriculture subsidies as
they affect the country’s exports and output, Foreign Minister
Hector Timerman told reporters on Dec. 5 in  Buenos Aires .  To contact the reporter on this story:
