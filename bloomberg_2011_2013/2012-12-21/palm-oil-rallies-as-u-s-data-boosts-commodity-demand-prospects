Palm oil  climbed to the highest
level in more than two weeks after data signaled a recovery in
the  U.S. economy , boosting prospects for cooking oil demand.  The contract for March delivery climbed as much as 3.1
percent to 2,392 ringgit ($781) a metric ton on the Malaysia
Derivatives Exchange, the highest price for the most-active
contract since Dec. 3, and ended the morning session at 2,391
ringgit. Futures have gained 5.1 percent this week and are
heading for a 25 percent drop this year.  The U.S. economy grew at a 3.1 percent annual rate in the
third quarter, more than previously reported, according to
Commerce Department figures released yesterday. Sales of
previously owned U.S. homes climbed to a three-year high in
November, reinforcing forecasts that the industry is set to add
to annual economic growth for the first time since 2005.  “Commodities may receive a boost as the global sentiment
may improve because of the positive economic data from the
U.S.,” Chowda Reddy, an analyst at JRG Wealth Management Ltd.,
said by phone from the Indian city of Hyderabad.  Futures also gained as some investors reversed bets on
declining prices ahead of year-end holidays, Paramalingam Supramaniam, director at Pelindung Bestari Sdn. Bhd., said by
phone from  Kuala Lumpur .  Soybeans for March delivery climbed 1 percent to $14.185 a
bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade.  Soybean oil  for delivery
