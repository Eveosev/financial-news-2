Oil drilling rigs in the U.S.
dropped by the most in a single week in 20 years, oil-services
company  Baker Hughes Inc. (BHI)  said.  Oil rigs dropped by 41 to 1,340, the lowest level since
April. They dropped by 44 in the week of Dec. 18, 1992. It was
the fifth straight decline.  The  energy rig count  fell by 25 to 1,774, according to data
posted on Baker Hughes’ website. Gas rigs rose by 13 to 429, the
Houston-based company said.  The oil count declined last quarter for the first time
since 2009 as more efficient drilling operations boosted  crude
supplies  to near a 12-year high and a drop in crude prices
curbed companies’ demand for rigs.  The U.S. natural gas rig count has shrunk to less than a
third of its peak in August 2008 because of a switch from dry
gas to more profitable crude and natural gas liquids drilling.  Natural gas for January delivery rose 14.2 cents, or 4.3
percent, to settle at $3.462 per million British thermal units
on the  New York Mercantile Exchange  yesterday. Prices are up 16
percent this year as of yesterday.  Crude for February delivery on the Nymex gained 62 cents,
or 0.7 percent, to $90.13 a barrel yesterday.  Oil prices  are
down 8.8 percent for the year as of yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
