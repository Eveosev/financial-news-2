India ’s  interest-rate swaps  snapped
three weeks of declines after the central bank refrained from
easing monetary policy.  The  Reserve Bank  of India kept the cash-reserve  ratio 
unchanged at 4.25 percent on Dec. 18 and held the repurchase
 rate  at 8 percent. Twenty-one of 24 analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg forecast the central bank would reduce the reserve
ratio. Lenders  borrowed  1.7 trillion rupees ($31 billion) from
the RBI’s overnight repurchase window yesterday, the most since
March, reflecting a shortage of cash in the banking system.  “Swaps have risen as the reserve ratio has been kept
steady, although liquidity is tight,” said Debendra Kumar Dash,
a fixed-income trader at  Development Credit Bank Ltd. (DEVB)  in Mumbai.
“The lack of a rate cut was also disappointing.”  The fixed payment to lock in one-year borrowing costs rose
five basis points this week to 7.68 percent in Mumbai, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg. The rate fell seven basis points
this year and five basis points today as the central bank
purchased 79 billion rupees of notes.  The yield on the benchmark 8.15 percent government bonds
due June 2022 was little changed from Dec. 14 at 8.14 percent.
The rate fell one basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
