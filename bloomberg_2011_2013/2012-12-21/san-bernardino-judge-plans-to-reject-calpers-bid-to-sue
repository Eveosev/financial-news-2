The  California  Public Employees’
Retirement System shouldn’t be allowed to sue San Bernardino,
California, to collect more than $5 million owed by the
insolvent city, a judge said.  U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Meredith M. Jury made a tentative
ruling at a court hearing today in Riverside, California. If
Calpers is allowed to sue and wins a monetary judgment, “the
impact on the city’s ability to reorganize would be
astronomical,” she said.  The judge’s initial ruling sides with San Bernardino and
its bondholders, which claimed the city can’t afford to fund
vital public services and also pay past-due obligations to
Calpers, the biggest U.S. public pension fund. Jury invited
Calpers and its lawyers to try to change her mind.  “This city has limited funds and at the present time is
using those limited funds to pay salaries to city employees who
are providing services today,” Jury said. Forcing payments to
Calpers “would be the death knell” for the city, she said.  The ruling may set a legal precedent at a time when
pensions for public employees are straining local governments
from California to Rhode Island, according to bankruptcy
attorneys that specialize in municipal insolvencies.  The case is In re San Bernardino, 12-28006, U.S. Bankruptcy
Court, Central District of California (Riverside).  To contact the reporter on this story:
