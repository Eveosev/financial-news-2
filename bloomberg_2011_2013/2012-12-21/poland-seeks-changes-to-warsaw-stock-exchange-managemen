Poland is seeking to shuffle the
management of the  Warsaw Stock Exchange (GPW) , central  Europe ’s
biggest equity market.  The Treasury Ministry, which has 51.7 percent of  voting
rights  in the exchange’s operator, called for a shareholders’
meeting to vote on the changes, Katarzyna Kozlowska, a
spokeswoman for the ministry, said by phone today. She declined
to say why the government wants the change.  The four-member management has been led by Chief Executive
Officer Ludwik Sobolewski since June 2006. Shareholders have the
right to hire and dismiss the company’s chief executive officer,
while other members of the management are appointed by the
exchange’s supervisory board, according to its statute.  Poland’s sole stock exchange is the biggest equity market
in central and eastern Europe, trading shares of 437 companies
with a total market capitalization at 733 billion zloty ($239
billion), according to data on its  website . Its NewConnect
platform for smaller companies lists further 427 companies.  Anna Wisniewska, a bourse spokeswoman, had no immediate
comment on the ministry’s proposals when contacted by phone
today. According to the statute, the management has two weeks to
call a  shareholders’ meeting  after receiving such a request.  Poland sold to the public a minority stake in the bourse’s
operator in 2010. Its shares declined 0.5 percent to 37.83 zloty
as of 9:44 a.m. in Warsaw, falling for the first time this week
and valuing the company at 1.59 billion zloty.  To contact the reporter on this story:
