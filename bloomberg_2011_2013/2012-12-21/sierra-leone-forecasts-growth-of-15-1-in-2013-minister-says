Economic growth in  Sierra Leone  may
reach 15.1 percent next year as the country expands mining
operations, according to Finance Minister Kaifala Marah.  Expansion this year was seen at 21.3 percent, he told
lawmakers during a budget presentation in the capital, Freetown,
today. That’s the fastest in sub-Saharan  Africa , according to
the  International Monetary Fund , which forecast 2013 output of
7.5 percent in Sierra Leone.  London-based African Minerals Ltd. and London Mining Plc
mine iron ore in the former British colony. The country
attracted about $3 billion in foreign investment this year,
according to President Ernest Bai Koroma, who won re-election
last month and named Marah finance minister on Dec. 17.  In 2013, royalties from iron-ore mining are expected to
bring in 101 billion leones ($23 million). Royalties from other
minerals, including gold, diamonds and bauxite, may reach 33.6
billion leones, according to Marah. Next year’s inflation target
will be “below 10 percent” from 11 percent this year, he said.
The rate was 11.25 percent in October, Marah said.  Spending will rise to 3.2 trillion leones next year from an
estimated 2.7 trillion leones in 2012, Marah said. Revenue and
grants are expected to reach 2.7 trillion leones in 2013,
compared with 2.5 trillion leones this year. The 2012  budget
deficit  is forecast at 4.9 percent of gross domestic product,
Marah said, without giving an outlook for 2013.  To contact the reporter on this story:
