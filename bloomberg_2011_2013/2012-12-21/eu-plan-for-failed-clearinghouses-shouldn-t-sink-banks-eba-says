European Union plans for handling
failing clearinghouses should be designed in a way that won’t
cripple banks, the bloc’s regulators said today.  Some options being weighed by the EU for allocating losses
at a crisis-hit clearinghouse “could spread the problems” to
healthy financial institutions, according to an opinion
published by the  European Banking Authority . “In a situation of
stress, banks could be seriously hit.”  The European Commission is seeking views until Dec. 28 on
measures to take taxpayers off the hook for rescuing
institutions such as clearinghouses, central securities
depositories and large insurance companies. Steps being
considered include forced writedowns of margin that lenders have
posted with central clearers.  Clearinghouses such as LCH.Clearnet Group Ltd. and  Deutsche
Boerse AG’s (DB1)  Eurex Clearing operate as central counterparties for
every buy and sell order executed by their members, who post
margin, reducing the threat from a trader’s default.  The EU should also weigh rules for failing hedge funds, the
EBA said. The EBA brings together bank regulators in the 27-
nation EU to coordinate rulemaking.  To contact the reporter on this story:
