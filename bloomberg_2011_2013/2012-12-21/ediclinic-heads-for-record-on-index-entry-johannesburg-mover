Mediclinic International Ltd. (MDC) , South
Africa’s largest hospital group by market value, rose to a
record before its inclusion in an index of the country’s 40
biggest, most tradable companies.  Shares closed 2.3 percent up at 54.90 rand, the highest
since at least 1990 when Bloomberg started tracking the stock,
adding to yesterday’s 1.2 percent gain. Almost five million
shares traded, or 273 percent of the daily average over the past
three months.  Mediclinic will be included in the Top-40 index of stocks
from Dec. 25, replacing  Harmony Gold Mining Co. (HAR) , JSE Ltd.,
operator of the country’s exchanges, said on Dec. 12. The
company’s share price jumped 76 percent this year, increasing
its market value to 45.4 billion rand ($5.21 billion). Shares in
Harmony declined 27 percent over the same period, reducing its
market capitalization to 30.3 billion rand.  Investors “tracking the index know about the changes
beforehand and will be buying shares before it enters the
index,” Drikus Combrinck, a portfolio manager at PSG Konsult,
said by phone from Pretoria. The company’s expansion in
Switzerland and the United Arab Emirates had pushed its market
value ahead of listed rivals  Netcare Ltd. (NTC)  and  Life Healthcare
Group Holdings Ltd. (LHC) , he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
