Italian  consumer confidence  remained
near a record low this month as households are still pessimistic
about the economic outlook amid the country’s fourth recession
since 2001.  The confidence index rose to 85.7 percent from a revised
84.9 percent in November, the lowest since the series began in
1996, the national statistics office,  Istat , said in Rome today.
The reading was higher than the median forecast of 85.1 in a
survey of 10 economists by Bloomberg News.  The Italian election campaign puts the EU’s budget policy
up for review in the 27-country area’s fourth-largest economy.
Prime Minister Mario Monti, who’s been trying for 13 months to
tame a public debt of 2 trillion euros ($2.6 trillion), said
Dec. 8 he will resign once the budget is passed by parliament.
The Chamber of Deputies is due to hold the final vote on the
budget law today.  Elections, which could be held on Feb. 24, come as the
Italian economy  shrank  for a fifth quarter in the three months
through September as export gains failed to offset the effects
of weak domestic demand. The country’s jobless rate rose to the
highest level in 13 years in October as employers remain
reluctant to hire amid the deepening recession.  Both the government and the central bank expect a recovery
in the second half of next year amid increasing exports.  Istat originally reported a November confidence reading of
84.8.  To contact the reporter on this story:
