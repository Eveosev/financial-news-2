Rubber pared a third weekly gain
after U.S. House Republican leaders canceled a planned vote that
would permit higher taxes amid stalled budget talks.  Rubber for delivery in May fell as much as 0.6 percent to
281 yen a kilogram ($3,346 a metric ton) before trading at 281.5
yen on the  Tokyo  Commodity Exchange at 12:02 p.m. The most-
active contract has increased 1.8 percent this week.  House Republican leaders canceled a planned vote tonight on
Speaker  John Boehner ’s plan to allow higher tax rates for annual
income above $1 million amid stalled budget talks.  Asian shares 
declined, curbing investor appetite for riskier assets.  “Rubber was capped by concerns over the U.S. fiscal
cliff,”  Kazuhiko Saito , an analyst at broker Fujitomi Co. in
Tokyo, said today by phone. “Still, there were no aggressive
sellers amid speculation that the yen will decline further on
economic policies by the new Japanese government.”  The yen traded near an almost 20-month low against the
dollar after the  Bank of Japan  yesterday boosted monetary
stimulus and agreed to review its 1 percent inflation target.
Incoming Prime Minister Shinzo Abe asked Bank of Japan Governor
Masaaki Shirakawa to agree to set a 2 percent target.  Rubber for May delivery added 0.8 percent to 25,085  yuan 
($4,025) a ton on the Shanghai Futures Exchange. Thai rubber
free-on-board remained unchanged at 96.65 baht ($3.16) a
kilogram yesterday, according to the Rubber Research Institute
of Thailand.  To contact the reporter on this story:
