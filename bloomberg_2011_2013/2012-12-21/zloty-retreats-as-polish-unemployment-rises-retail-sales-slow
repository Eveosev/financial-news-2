The zloty retreated from its
strongest level in more than three months after a report showed
Polish  unemployment  rose in November while  retail sales  grew at
the slowest pace in 31 months.  The zloty lost 0.6 percent to 4.0809 per euro at 5 p.m. in
Warsaw, snapping a three-day winning streak. It has appreciated
9.4 percent this year for the best gain after the Hungarian
forint among 174 currencies tracked by Bloomberg. The yield on
10-year notes slid six basis points, or 0.06 percentage point,
to a record low of 3.71 percent and on course for its steepest
annual decline in a decade.  Polish retail sales rose 2.4 percent from a year earlier in
November, the worst pace since April 2010, as unemployment
climbing to 12.9 percent discouraged  consumer spending . The
European Union’s biggest eastern economy is feeling the impact
of the recession in the euro area, prompting the central bank to
cut rates by a quarter point for a second month in December.  “The tendencies in retail sales and on the labor market
fit in the picture of a deteriorating economy and increase the
chance of more interest rate cuts,”  Grzegorz Maliszewski , chief
economist at  Bank Millennium SA (MIL)  in Warsaw, wrote today in an e-
mailed note to clients.  To contact the reporter on this story:
