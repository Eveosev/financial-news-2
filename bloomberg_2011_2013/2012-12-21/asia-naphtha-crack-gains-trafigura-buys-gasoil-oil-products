Asia’s naphtha crack spread is set
for the biggest weekly gain in three weeks, signaling increased
profit for refiners. Trafigura Beheer BV extended its gasoil
purchases in  Singapore , the region’s largest oil-trading center.  Light Distillates  The premium of Japan naphtha to London-traded Brent crude
futures rose $2.30 to $110.05 a metric ton at 5:30 p.m.
Singapore time, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. This
crack spread, a measure of the profit from making the
petrochemical and gasoline feedstock, has widened 23 percent so
far this week, the most in December.  Itochu Corp. bought 25,000 tons of open-specification
naphtha for first-half February delivery from Mabanaft GmbH and
sold the same quantity for second-half February to the German
trader, according to a Bloomberg News survey of traders who
monitored the Platts window. The earlier-delivered cargo traded
at a premium of $6.75 a ton to the later shipment.  Phillips 66 bought gasoline for a third day in Singapore,
the survey showed. The Houston-based refiner paid $117 a barrel
to Arcadia Petroleum Ltd. for 50,000 barrels of 92-RON grade
loading Jan. 10 to Jan. 14.  Vitol Group purchased a similar-sized cargo of 97-RON
gasoline loading Jan. 16 to Jan. 20 from Gunvor Group Ltd. at
$121.60 a barrel, according to the survey.  Middle Distillates  Hin Leong Trading Pte sold 150,000 barrels of  gasoil , or
diesel, with 0.5 percent sulfur to Trafigura for Jan. 16 to Jan.
20 loading, according to the Bloomberg survey. The transaction
was at 60 cents a barrel below average December quotes, a
smaller discount than the 90 cents in a similar transaction
yesterday. Amsterdam-based Trafigura has purchased at least 16
gasoil cargoes of two grades totaling 2.9 million barrels so far
this month.  Gasoil’s premium to Asian marker Dubai crude climbed 45
cents to $20.72 a barrel at 2:18 p.m. Singapore time, according
to data from PVM Oil Associates Ltd., a broker. This  crack
spread , a gauge of processing profit, has widened 5 percent so
far this week, poised to erase last week’s 4.1 percent drop.  Jet fuel was at a  discount  of 10 cents a barrel to gasoil,
PVM said. A negative regrade shows it is unprofitable to make
aviation fuel over diesel.  Royal Dutch Shell Plc sold 100,000 barrels of  jet fuel  to
PetroChina Co. for a second day, according to the survey. The
cargo, for the earliest loading period of Jan. 5 to Jan. 9,
changed hands at a premium of 20 cents a barrel to January
prices.  Fuel Oil  PetroChina sold 40,000 tons of 380-centistoke high-sulfur
fuel oil to a unit of SK Innovation Co. at parity to average
January quotes, according to the Bloomberg survey. BP Plc bought
a 20,000-ton shipment from Cargill Inc. at a discount of 75
cents a ton to benchmark prices. The cargoes are for Jan. 7 to
Jan. 11 and Jan. 6 to Jan. 10 loading respectively.  Fuel oil’s  discount  to Dubai crude was at $7.81 a barrel at
2:18 p.m. Singapore time, according to PVM. This crack spread is
set to widen for a second week, indicating increased losses for
refiners producing residual products.  The premium of 180-centistoke fuel oil to 380-centistoke
grade was unchanged for a fourth day at $10.25 a ton, PVM data
showed. This  viscosity spread  has widened 2.5 percent this week,
meaning bunker, or marine fuel, increased less than supplies
used in power stations.  Refinery News  Reliance Industries Ltd. postponed plans to shut a crude
unit at the newer of its two Jamnagar refineries by a month to
mid-February, said two people with knowledge of the matter who
asked not to be identified because the information is
confidential. The unit has a capacity of 580,000 barrels a day.  China ’s “teapot refineries,” or smaller plants in
Shandong province, increased processing to 46.2 percent of
capacity as of yesterday from 46 percent a week earlier,
according to Oilchem.net. Rates may decline next week because of
reduced fuel demand, the Shandong-based industry website said.
Major refineries operated at 87.8 percent of capacity, Shanghai-
based commodity researcher C1 Energy said.  Tenders  Mangalore Refinery & Petrochemicals Ltd. sold two 35,000-
ton naphtha cargoes to Total SA and 40,000 tons of 0.5 percent
sulfur gasoil to B.B. Energy for January loading, said two
traders who asked not to be identified because the information
is confidential. The unit of India’s biggest energy explorer
also sold 40,000 tons of vacuum gasoil to Vitol for January
loading from New Mangalore.  Indian Oil Corp. sold as much as 35,000 tons of 380-
centistoke fuel oil to Gunvor for January loading from Chennai,
said two traders who asked not to be named because the
information is confidential.  India ’s largest refiner also sold
30,000 tons of naphtha to Total for January loading from Kandla.  To contact the reporters on this story:
