Wheat rose for the first time in
three days after a storm missed most of the winter crops in the
U.S. Great Plains, leaving growing areas without moisture for
dormant plants.  A storm that dumped as much as 10 inches (25 centimeters)
of snow in Nebraska, Iowa and  Wisconsin  was too far north to
provide moisture for wheat in the southern Great Plains that
will remain dormant until they resume growth in April and May.
Southern  Kansas  and all of Oklahoma and Texas got “very
little” precipitation, and high winds may have damaged plants,
said  Bryce Anderson , a meteorologist at Telvent DTN.  “The Wheat Belt didn’t get any crop-changing moisture, and
next week’s snowfall is limited,too,” Jamey Kohake, a broker
and branch manager at Paragon Investments in  Silver Lake ,
Kansas, said by telephone. “The fundamentals are fairly bullish
for wheat.”  Wheat futures for March delivery gained 0.6 percent to
$7.955 a bushel at 10:15 a.m. on the Chicago Board of Trade. The
price through yesterday was up 21 percent in 2012, the most
among 24 commodities tracked by the Standard & Poor’s GSCI Spot
Index.  In the U.S., wheat is the fourth-largest crop, valued at
$14.4 billion in 2011, behind corn, soybeans and hay, government
data show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
