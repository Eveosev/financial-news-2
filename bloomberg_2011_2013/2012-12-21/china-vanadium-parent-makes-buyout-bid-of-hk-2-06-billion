China Vanadium Titano-Magnetite
Mining Co. (893) , the largest non-state-owned iron ore producer in
Sichuan province, said its parent made a buyout offer of as much
as HK$2.06 billion ($266 million).  The company will delist if the offer of HK$1.93 a share in
cash is is completed, according to a Hong Kong stock exchange
filing yesterday. The buyout by Trisonic International Ltd. is
subject to shareholders’ approval, it said.  China Vanadium said it will delist because of low trading
volume and poor share-price performance. The average number of
shares trading hands fell to 5.3 million in the six months
before the company first proposed the buyout on Nov. 1, from
13.7 million in the first half-year after the stock debuted on
Oct. 8, 2009. The shares have fallen 52 percent since listing.  The stock gained 1.2 percent to close at HK$1.67 on Dec.
19, its last day of trading before suspension.  China Vanadium didn’t disclose its net asset value per
share in the filing. Its net assets attributable to shareholders
were 3.33 billion  yuan  as of June 30, according to yesterday’s
filing, about HK$4.14 billion at today’s exchange rate. That
gives about a HK$2 NAV per share, based on its 2.08 billion
shares outstanding.  Sapphire Corp. (SAPP)  is acting together with Trisonic in the
buyout offer.  To contact the reporter on this story:
