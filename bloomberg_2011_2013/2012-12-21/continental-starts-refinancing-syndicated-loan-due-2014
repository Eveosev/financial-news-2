Continental AG (CON) , Europe’s second
largest auto-parts supplier, said it’s working to refinance a
syndicated loan maturing in April 2014 to cut debt.  The company is in talks with banks on reducing the loan
volume “slightly” to a total of 4.5 billion euros ($5.9
billion) and splitting it into two portions, the Hanover,
Germany-based company said in a statement today.  “We are confident that we shall be able to conclude the
negotiations and sign the credit agreement in January 2013,”
Chief Financial Officer Wolfgang Schaefer said in the statement.  Continental affirmed its 2012 earnings target on Oct. 31,
as car-market growth in North America and Asia offset a decline
in its home region, and said it plans to increase sales next
year. A focus on high-value parts such as emergency-braking
systems and fuel-injection technology has helped the
manufacturer withstand shrinking automotive demand in  Europe .  One tranche of the loan will amount to 1.5 billion euros
and a three-year term and the remaining 3 billion euros will be
a five-year revolving credit facility, the company said.  The parts maker’s initial loan for acquiring the VDO car-
electronics unit from  Siemens AG (SIE)  in 2007 stood at 13.5 billion
euros. The company had net debt of 6.8 billion euros at the end
of the third quarter.  Continental  fell  as much as 0.7 percent to 85.15 euros and
was trading down 0.3 percent at 11:44 a.m. in Frankfurt. That
pared the stock’s gain this year to 78 percent, valuing the
company at 17.1 billion euros.  To contact the reporter on this story:
