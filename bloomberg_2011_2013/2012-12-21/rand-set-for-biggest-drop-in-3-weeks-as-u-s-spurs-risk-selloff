The rand declined, heading for its
biggest slump in three weeks, as concern that U.S. budget
negotiations will fail reduced appetite for riskier assets.  South Africa ’s currency depreciated 1.1 percent to 8.5668
per dollar by 3:44 p.m. in Johannesburg, paring its gain this
month to 4 percent. The rand has lost 6 percent this year.
Yields on the government’s 6.75 percent bonds due March 2021
fell two basis points, or 0.02 percentage point, to 6.35
percent, a record low.  The  MSCI Emerging Markets Index (MXEF)  sank 1.1 percent, the most
since Nov. 8, after U.S. House Republican leaders canceled a
vote that would permit higher taxes. U.S. lawmakers are seeking
to avert more than $600 billion in tax increases and spending
cuts set to start on Jan. 1. The 21 nations in the MSCI gauge
send about 17 percent of their exports to the U.S. on average,
World Trade Organization data show.  “Markets at least in the short term are likely to respond
negatively to this news,”  Chris Becker , a Johannesburg-based
analyst at Tradition Analytics, and colleagues wrote in e-mailed
comments. “Nothing in the way of domestic data will leave the
bulk of the focus with offshore developments, most likely
related to the fiscal cliff.”  Standard & Poor’s GSCI Index of commodities dropped as much
as 0.7 percent, a second day of losses.  Raw materials  accounted
for 45 percent of South Africa’s exports last year, according to
government data.  To contact the reporter on this story:
