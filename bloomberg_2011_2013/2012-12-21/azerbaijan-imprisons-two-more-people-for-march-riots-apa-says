A court in  Azerbaijan ’s northern
district of Quba imprisoned two more people for involvement in
anti-government riots there in March, APA  said.   The Quba residents were given prison sentences of 1 1/2 to
4 1/2 years, the privately owned news service said today. That
brings the total number of people imprisoned this month for the
riots to six.  Hundreds of people in Quba burned and looted the local
governor’s house and damaged his office on March 1 in a rare
outbreak of civil unrest in the energy-rich former Soviet
republic. Quba, which has a population of about 160,000, is 164
kilometers (102 miles) north of the capital, Baku, near the
border with  Russia .  To contact the reporter on this story:
