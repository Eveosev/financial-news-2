Ethanol snapped a five-day streak of
losses against gasoline as corn prices advanced.  Futures rebounded from a six-month low as corn gained on
speculation that a 6.1 percent price decline this month will
spur more demand from overseas buyers, raising costs to convert
it into ethanol in the U.S. Gasoline fell as  House Republicans 
delayed a vote on measures that would prevent tax increases and
spending cuts from taking effect in January.  “We may have seen a little temporary low,” said Mike
Blackford, a consultant at INTL FCStone Group in  Des Moines ,
 Iowa .  Ethanol’s discount to gasoline narrowed to 50.97 cents a
gallon, based on futures settlements. It was 54.63 cents
yesterday, the highest price since Oct. 10. The differential has
averaged 61.02 cents this year.  Denatured ethanol for January delivery advanced 1.7 cents,
or 0.8 percent, to settle at $2.225 a gallon on the  Chicago 
Board of Trade, up from the lowest price since June 26. Futures
have fallen 7.6 percent this month.  Blackford said volume is light today because many traders
have left for the Christmas holiday. Forty-nine contracts
traded, compared with 335 yesterday.  In the cash market, ethanol in  New York  added 5.5 cents, or
2.4 percent, to $2.32 a gallon and on the West Coast the
additive jumped 4 cents, or 1.7 percent, to $2.355, data
compiled by Bloomberg show.  Spot Trading  Ethanol in Chicago added 2.5 cents to $2.21 a gallon and in
the U.S. Gulf the biofuel slipped 1 cent to $2.265.  Gasoline for January delivery slumped 1.96 cents, or 0.7
percent, to $2.7347 a gallon on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange . The contract covers reformulated gasoline, made to be
blended with ethanol before delivery to filling stations.  Corn for March delivery rose 5.5 cents, or 0.8 percent, to
$7.02 a bushel in Chicago. One bushel makes at least 2.75
gallons of ethanol.  Ethanol plants this year have faced poor margins to produce
the fuel because of higher corn or feedstock prices, an ethanol
supply glut and lackluster demand, Blackford said.  Based on March contracts for corn and ethanol, producers
are losing 29 cents on each gallon of the fuel made,  excluding
the revenue that can be pocketed from the sale of dried
distillers’ grains, a byproduct of ethanol production that can
be fed to livestock, according to data collected by Bloomberg.  Ethanol  stockpiles  in the week ended Dec. 14 were 20.8
million barrels, 18 percent higher than a year ago, the highest
level for this time of year since the Energy Department began
tracking weekly data in June 2010.  To contact the reporter on this story:
