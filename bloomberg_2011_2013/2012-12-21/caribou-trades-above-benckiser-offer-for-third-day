Caribou Coffee Co. (CBOU)  traded above Joh.
A. Benckiser Group’s $16-a-share offer price for the third
straight day as shareholders agitated for a higher bid.  Caribou is undervalued at JAB’s offer price and may attract
higher bids, according to Accretive Capital Partners LLC and
 Gamco Investors Inc. (GBL)  The Minneapolis-based coffee-shop company
is worth $30 to $35 a share, Richard Fearon, Accretive’s founder
and managing partner, said in a letter yesterday to Caribou’s
board.  “We at Accretive Capital Partners find ourselves utterly
dismayed by the price you have accepted,” Fearon said. “It
would be in shareholders’ best interests to determine if other
major strategic buyers -- such as Starbucks,  Green Mountain (GMCR) ,
Dunkin’ Brands, Krispy Kreme -- had any interest in acquiring
Caribou Coffee.”  Caribou fell 0.5 percent to $16.19 at the close in  New York 
after rising to $16.27 yesterday. The  shares  have gained 16
percent this year.  Benckiser  paid  about $941.2 million, or 21.6 times earnings
before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization, for Peet’s
Coffee & Tea Inc. in October, while  Starbucks Corp. (SBUX) ’s pending
offer for  Teavana Holdings Inc. (TEA)  in November values the Atlanta-
based tea seller at 19 times Ebitda, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg.  Benckiser’s $340 million purchase price offer for Caribou
values the coffee seller at 11.2 times Ebitda, the data show.  Caribou ‘Undervalued’  “We think it’s statistically undervalued even at $16,”
 Mario Gabelli , head of Gamco, said in an interview on Dec. 19.
Caribou’s Ebitda will increase about 15 percent to $35 million
in 2013 from this year, Gabelli said.  Lisa Alcorn, a spokeswoman for Caribou Coffee, and  Tom Johnson , a spokesman for JAB, declined to comment.  Gamco disclosed in a Dec. 19 filing that it raised its
stake in Caribou Coffee to 6.8 percent from 5.7 percent. It
disclosed its 5.7 percent stake on Dec. 18, the day after
Benckiser announced its plans to buy Caribou. Accretive owns
more than 850,000 shares of Caribou, according to Fearon’s
letter.  Caribou, which has about 610 stores, has said it’s
targeting 10 percent to 12 percent unit growth in 2013. It also
has started opening kiosk locations in  Supervalu Inc. (SVU) ’s Jewel-
Osco grocery stores. Starbucks has more than 11,100 stores in
the U.S., while Peet’s has about 197.  The Caribou deal’s $5.2 million termination fee, if the the
company abandons the transaction before Jan. 15, is smaller than
the $30 million fee for the Peet’s takeover, according to
company filings.  Still, Peet’s may be worth more to Benckiser because it has
a bigger grocery business and a more premium brand, said Jason
Moser, an Alexandria, Virginia-based analyst at the Motley Fool.
Emeryville, California-based Peet’s “demands more of a
premium,” he said.  Peet’s grocery, food service and home-delivery businesses
generated $157.6 million in revenue last year, while Caribou’s
grocery segment had revenue of $71.5 million.  To contact the reporter on this story:
