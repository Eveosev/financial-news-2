Duke Energy Corp. (DUK) , the largest U.S.
utility owner, received two $110 million loans from the North
American Development Bank to build two Texas wind farms.  The 200-megawatt Los Vientos I project in Willacy County
will use 87 Siemens AG wind turbines and provide electricity to
CPS Energy, according to a statement today from the North
American Development Bank. The 202-megawatt Los Vientos II
project in Cameron County will use 84  Mitsubishi Heavy
Industries Ltd. (7011)  turbines and supply power for Austin Energy, the
San Antonio, Texas-based bank said.  CPS and Austin Energy, the municipal utilities of San
Antonio and Austin, Texas, have set goals to obtain 20 percent
and 35 percent of their energy from renewable sources by 2020.  To contact the reporter on this story:
