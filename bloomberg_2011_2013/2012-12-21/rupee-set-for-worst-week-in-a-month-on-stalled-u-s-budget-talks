India ’s rupee completed its biggest
weekly drop in more than a month on concern stalled U.S. budget
talks will damp demand for riskier assets.  House Republican leaders canceled a planned vote yesterday
on Speaker John Boehner’s plan to allow higher tax rates on
annual incomes of more than $1 million, as lawmakers seek to
avert more than $600 billion in automatic spending cuts and tax
increases that are set to start in January. India’s central bank
refrained from lowering interest rates at a Dec. 18 review.  The rupee is affected by “an uncertain U.S. budgetary
deal, which is less than two weeks away from its deadline,”
Pramit Brahmbhatt, Mumbai-based chief executive officer at
Alpari Financial Services India Ltd., wrote in an e-mail today.
“The month-end and quarter-end importer demand for dollars
continues to weigh” on the currency, he said.  The rupee declined 1.1 percent this week to 55.07 per
dollar in Mumbai, the biggest drop since the five days through
Nov. 9, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The currency
fell 0.4 percent today and has lost 3.6 percent this year after
plunging 16 percent in 2011.  One-month implied volatility, a gauge of expected moves in
exchange rates used to price options, rose five basis points, or
0.05 percentage point, from Dec. 14 to 10.10 percent. The rate,
which fell 10 basis points today, has dropped 190 basis points
in 2012.  The Reserve Bank of India kept the benchmark  repurchase
rate  at 8 percent and unexpectedly left banks’ cash-reserve
requirements unchanged, instead of a cut predicted by economists
in a Bloomberg survey. The monetary authority said focus must
increasingly shift to growth “from this point onwards.”  The finance ministry said on Dec. 17 that gross domestic
product will increase 5.7 percent to 5.9 percent this fiscal
year through March, less than an earlier estimate of as much as
7.85 percent. That would be the slowest pace in a decade and in
line with the central bank’s October forecast of 5.8 percent.  Three-month onshore rupee forwards traded at 56.07 per
dollar, compared with 55.78 yesterday, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. Offshore non-deliverable contracts were
at 56.00 versus 55.69. Forwards are agreements to buy or sell
assets at a set price and date. Non-deliverable contracts are
settled in dollars.  To contact the reporter on this story:
