A gauge of U.S. corporate credit
risk rose after budget negotiations stalled in  Washington  as
House Republican leaders scrapped a plan to avert the so-called
fiscal cliff.  The Markit CDX North American Investment Grade Index, a
credit-default swaps benchmark that investors use to hedge
against losses or to speculate on creditworthiness, climbed 3.1
basis points to a mid-price of 91.8 basis points at 7:55 a.m. in
New York, according to prices compiled by Bloomberg.  Investor concern is mounting that a failure to reach a
compromise on the budget will harm the economy, hindering
companies’ ability to repay debt. House Speaker John Boehner
dropped a plan to allow higher tax rates on annual income above
$1 million, yielding to anti-tax resistance within his own
party. House members and senators won’t vote on the end-of-year
budget issues until after Christmas, giving them less than a
week to reach an agreement to avert more than $600 billion of
tax increases and spending cuts set to take effect next year.  The credit-swaps index typically rises as investor
confidence deteriorates and falls as it improves. The contracts
pay the buyer face value if a borrower fails to meet its
obligations, less the value of the defaulted debt. A basis point
equals $1,000 annually on a contract protecting $10 million of
debt.  To contact the reporter on this story:
