Norway ’s sovereign-wealth fund, the
world’s largest, received government approval to buy property
outside of  Europe .  “We are now opening for investments in real estate in the
whole world,” Finance Minister Sigbjoern Johnsen said in a
statement today. “By spreading investments we are contributing
to a continued safe and long-term management of the fund.”  Norges Bank Investment Management, which runs the $680
billion fund, can choose to invest in real estate abroad as it
sees fit, Norway’s finance ministry said in a statement today.
The fund had been only permitted to invest in securities outside
of Europe.  Built from Norway’s oil and gas wealth, the fund in 2010
received approval to invest as much as 5 percent of its capital
in real estate in a bid to meet a 4 percent return target. It
has since bought properties in France, U.K., Germany and
 Switzerland .  The fund wants a third of its property investments to be in
the U.S.,  Yngve Slyngstad , chief executive officer of Oslo-based
NBIM, said on Dec. 1. The fund held 0.3 percent in real estate,
60.3 percent in stocks and 39.4 percent in bonds at the end of
September, according to its quarterly report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
