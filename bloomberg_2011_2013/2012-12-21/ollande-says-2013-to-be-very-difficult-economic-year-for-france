French President  Francois Hollande 
said 2013 will be very tough for Europe’s second-largest
economy, with gross domestic product barely growing in the first
half.  Speaking on Europe 1 radio today, Hollande said
unemployment, which is already at a 14-year high, will rise
until the end of next year. He reiterated his budget-deficit
target of 3 percent of GDP for 2013.  France ’s economy will begin a “slight” recovery of 0.1
percent in the first half after shrinking in the final quarter
of 2012, national statistics office Insee predicted.  To contact the reporter on this story:
