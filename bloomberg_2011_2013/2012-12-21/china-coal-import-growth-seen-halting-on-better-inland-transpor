Chinese demand growth for imported
coal will almost halt next year before shipments contract in
2014 as the nation’s improving transport network allows domestic
suppliers to gain market share, according to Barclays Plc.  China  will increase purchases by 2.1 percent to 145 million
metric tons in 2013 compared with a 39 percent expansion this
year, Barclays analysts led by  Trevor Sikorski  in London said in
an e-mailed report today. Shipments to the country will shrink
by about 24 percent in 2014, according to the bank.  A slower rate of economic growth combined with improved
transportation systems in China will start curbing its need for
imports by the end of 2014, Barclays said. Global trade in the
fuel and steel-making raw material will increase by about 4
percent to 901 million tons next year, the slowest rate of
growth since 2008, according to Barclays.  The slower expansion will hurt demand for shipping at a
time when there’s already a glut of vessels, meaning freight
rates won’t improve much for the next two years, according to
Barclays.  To contact the reporter on this story:
