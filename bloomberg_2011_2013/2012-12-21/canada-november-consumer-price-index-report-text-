The following is the text of
 Canada ’s consumer price index report for November released
by  Statistics Canada .  Consumer prices rose 0.8% in the 12 months to November,
following a 1.2% gain in October. The November increase was the
smallest year-over-year gain in the Consumer Price Index (CPI)
since October 2009.  The slower increase in the CPI in November compared with
October was attributable to a smaller year-over-year price
increase for gasoline, as well as price decreases for the
purchase of passenger vehicles.  Gasoline prices rose 0.4% in the 12 months to November,
following a 4.0% advance in October. The largest year-over-year
increase occurred in  Quebec  (+2.4%), and the biggest decline in
British Columbia (-4.7%).  Prices for the purchase of passenger vehicles decreased
1.8% in the 12 months to November. This decline was attributable
to smaller monthly price increases in November 2012 compared
with November 2011.  12-month change in the major components  Consumer prices rose in six of the eight major components
in the 12 months to November, the exceptions being
transportation as well as clothing and footwear.  Prices for transportation fell 0.2% year over year in
November, after rising 1.7% in October. The 12-month decline in
November was led by lower prices for the purchase of passenger
vehicles. Smaller year-over-year price increases for gasoline in
November compared with October were also a factor.  Food prices increased 1.7% on a year-over-year basis in
November following a 2.0% advance the previous month. Consumers
paid 2.1% more for food purchased from restaurants and 4.3% more
for meat. In contrast, prices declined 5.8% for fresh vegetables.  Shelter costs increased 1.0% in the 12 months to November
following a 0.9% advance in October. Homeowners’ replacement
cost, property taxes and rent increased on a year-over-year
basis. Conversely, mortgage interest cost decreased 3.0% and
natural gas prices declined 6.8%.  12-month change in the provinces  Consumer prices rose at a slower year-over-year rate in
November compared with October in all provinces except  Alberta .
The CPI for Prince  Edward Island  and for Quebec rose the most,
while British Columbia increased the least.  Consumer prices in both Prince Edward Island and Quebec
increased 1.5% in the 12 months to November, after rising 2.1%
and 1.9% respectively in the previous month. Both provinces
posted larger year-over-year price increases for gasoline
relative to the national average.  Prices in British Columbia rose 0.1% on a year-over-year
basis in November, following a 0.5% increase in October. Of all
the provinces, British Columbia posted the largest year-over-
year price decrease for gasoline. Consumers in the province also
paid less in homeowners’ replacement cost and for the purchase
of passenger vehicles.  In Alberta, consumer prices rose 0.6% in the 12-months to
November, matching the increase in the previous month. Natural
gas prices continued to decrease on a year-over-year basis in
November but at a slower rate than in October. Gasoline prices
declined in November after increasing in October.  Seasonally adjusted monthly CPI decreases  On a seasonally adjusted
