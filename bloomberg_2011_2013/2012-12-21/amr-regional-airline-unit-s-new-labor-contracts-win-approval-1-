American Airlines parent  AMR Corp. (AAMRQ) 
won approval for its regional airline, American Eagle, to enter
into new labor contracts.  U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Sean H. Lane in  New York  filed orders
today authorizing the AMR unit to enter agreements with unions
representing pilots, flight attendants, maintenance workers,
dispatchers and others.  The approval “paves the way for us to begin implementing
the labor cost savings that are required for our successful
restructuring,” American Eagle President and CEO Dan Garton
said in a statement.  “While the past year for the Eagle team has been
extraordinarily challenging, we believe what we have
accomplished positions us well for a bright future,” he said.  In October, Garton said Fort Worth, Texas-based AMR was
considering plans to spin off the regional carrier after
emerging from  bankruptcy protection . The regional carrier had
258 planes in operation as of Sept. 30, according to an AMR
filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.  The case is in re AMR Corp., 11-15463,  U.S. Bankruptcy
Court , Southern District of New York (Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
