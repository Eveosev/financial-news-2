German power for 2013 slumped to a
record after  Brent crude  declined as Republican leaders in the
U.S. scrapped a plan to allow higher taxes. European Union
carbon permits also fell.  German 2013 baseload electricity, for supplies delivered
around the clock, slid as much as 0.3 percent as crude dropped 1
percent and emissions lost 1.6 percent. Traders consider crude
prices when buying and selling long-term power contracts.  Power for 2013, a European benchmark, declined as much as
15 cents to 45 euros ($59.46) a megawatt-hour, a record for the
contract and the lowest price for year-ahead electricity since
December 2009, according to broker data compiled by Bloomberg.
Today is the final day of trading for the 2013 power contract on
the European Energy Exchange AG before it expires.  Brent for February settlement fell as much as $1.45 to
$108.75 a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures  Europe 
exchange. Carbon for 2013 lost 12 cents to 7.26 euros a metric
ton on ICE Futures Europe. Electricity in Europe’s largest
economy can track emissions prices, which affect production
costs at plants which burn fossil fuels.  U.S. House Speaker  John Boehner , a Republican, scrapped a
plan to allow higher tax rates on annual incomes above $1
million, yielding to resistance from party colleagues. Talks
between Boehner and President  Barack Obama  are already stalled
with 10 days to go before the year-end deadline for a budget
compromise.  Next-week power in France and Germany, Europe’s two biggest
power markets slumped to records. German next-week electricity
fell 9.9 percent to 23.20 euros a megawatt-hour while the French
contract dropped 19 percent to 17 euros, broker data compiled by
Bloomberg since 2007 show.  The maximum temperature in  Frankfurt  on Dec. 24 will be 10
degrees Celsius (50 Fahrenheit) tomorrow versus a five-year
average of 2 degrees, CustomWeather Inc. data show.  Day-ahead power fell 48 percent to 22 euros ahead of
holidays in  Germany . The January contract lost 0.5 percent to
47.25 euros a megawatt-hour, broker data show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
