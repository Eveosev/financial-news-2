Walt Disney Co., (DIS)  the worldâ€™s largest
entertainment company, won an appeals court ruling that protects
its trademark rights to the Winnie-the-Pooh characters.  The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office was correct to throw
out challenges to the trademark ownership filed by Stephen
Slesinger Inc., which has waged a decades-long battle with
Disney over ownership of the Pooh characters, an appeals court
in  Washington  said today. Slesinger had already litigated the
issue and lost in district court, the  U.S. Court of Appeals  for
the Federal Circuit said in an  opinion  posted on its website.  A.A. Milne, who wrote the Pooh books, transferred
merchandising rights to Stephen Slesinger in 1930, and his widow
licensed the rights to Disney in 1961. The Slesinger company and
Disney have been fighting in court over royalties since at least
1991.  In 2009, a federal court ruled that Slesinger had
transferred all of its rights in the Pooh works to Burbank,
California-based Disney. The Federal Circuit today said that,
based on that 2009 ruling, the trademark office was right to bar
Slesinger from seeking to cancel the Disney trademarks.  Disney fell $1.08, or 2.1 percent, to $49.85 at 12:28 p.m.
in  New York  Stock Exchange composite trading. The shares have
risen almost 33 percent so far this year.  The case is Stephen Slesinger Inc. v. Disney Enterprises
Inc., 2011-1593, U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit
(Washington).  To contact the reporter on this story:
