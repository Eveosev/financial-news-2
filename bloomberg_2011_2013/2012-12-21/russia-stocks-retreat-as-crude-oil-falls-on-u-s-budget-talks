Russian (INDEXCF)  equities dropped the most
this month as oil declined on concern that the deadlock over the
U.S. budget will threaten growth in the world’s biggest economy.  The 50-stock Micex Index fell 0.7 percent to 1,477.44 by
the close in Moscow, the biggest decline since Nov. 28. The
gauge has added 5.4 percent this year and 0.8 percent this week.
OAO Pharmstandard,  Russia ’s largest drugmaker, tumbled as much
as 5 percent, while preferred shares of OAO  Mechel (MTLR) , the
country’s largest coking-coal producer, lost 1.7 percent.
Preferred shares of OAO Surgutneftegas declined 1 percent and
OAO Uralkali, the largest potash producer by output, retreated
3.7 percent.  Crude, Russia’s biggest export earner, slid 2 percent to
$88.34 a barrel in  New York , the first drop in six days. U.S.
House members and senators won’t vote on the end-of-year budget
issues until after Christmas, giving them less than a week to
reach an agreement to avert tax increases and spending cuts set
to take effect in January. House Speaker  John Boehner  urged
President  Barack Obama  and Senate Majority Leader  Harry Reid  to
come up with legislation to avoid the fiscal cliff.  “The worst part about today’s news is that Boehner’s own
party didn’t back his plan,” Stanislav Kopylov, who helps
manage about $3.4 billion at UralSib Capital in Moscow, said by
phone. “They need to resolve this issue between themselves
first and then go to Obama. Oil is falling on this, weighing on
the Russian market.”  Severstal, Dixy  Russia-dedicated equity funds posted an 11th week of
outflows, losing $60 million in the week ended Dec. 19,
according to an e-mailed note from Sberbank CIB, citing EPFR
Global data. Standard & Poor’s GSCI Index dropped 0.7 percent to
638.84.  OAO Severstal climbed 1.8 percent to 384.80 rubles, adding
8.9 percent in the week, the biggest weekly gainer. Federal Grid
Co. dropped 1.4 percent to 20.62 kopeks, the biggest decline
since Nov. 26. The shares lost 3.8 percent in the week, the
biggest drop for the period on the Micex.  OAO Dixy Group added 1.7 percent to 407.94 rubles, rising
8.2 percent in the week, the second-biggest weekly advancer. The
food retailer’s November revenue jumped 17.5 percent to 12.2
billion rubles, according to a statement yesterday.  Russia’s antitrust watchdog may allow retailers to exceed
the 25 percent market-share limit if they build new shopping
areas, Interfax reported on Dec. 17, citing  Igor Artemyev , head
of the anti-monopoly service. At present retailers can’t add
outlets in a region if they have more than a quarter of the
area’s total trade volume.  The  RTS Index (RTSI$) , Russia’s dollar-denominated equity gauge,
declined 1.1 percent to 1,512.18. The  Bloomberg Russia-US stocks 
gauge climbed 0.9 percent to 98.72 yesterday. The  Market Vectors
Russia ETF (RSX) , the biggest U.S. exchange traded fund that holds
Russian shares, added 1.2 percent to $29.97, the highest close
since Sept. 18.  Norilsk Dividend  OAO GMK  Norilsk Nickel  added 6.2 percent in Moscow this
week. New Chief Executive Officer  Vladimir Potanin  told
reporters on Dec. 17 the miner will target dividends equivalent
to at least 50 percent of its annual earnings before interest,
taxes, depreciation and amortization with distributions made
twice a year starting in 2014. Norilsk posted Ebitda of $7.2
billion in 2011.  “As has been the case for several weeks, investors will be
more interested in any news of the budget talks,”  Chris Weafer ,
Sberbank CIB’s chief strategist in Moscow, said in an e-mailed
report. “This is effectively the last full important trading
day before the start of the New Year.”  Russia receives about half of its budget revenue from the
oil and gas industry. The country’s markets are closed for New
Year and Christmas holidays in the first week of 2013.  The amount of shares traded on the Micex was 14 percent
below the 10-day average, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  The Micex trades at about 5.4 times  estimated earnings .
That compares with a multiple of 10.6 times for the MSCI
Emerging Markets Index, which has gained 14 percent.  Russian equities have the lowest valuations based on
estimated earnings among 21  emerging markets  tracked by
Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
