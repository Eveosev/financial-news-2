Natural gas may climb next week as
forecasts show below-normal temperatures that would boost demand
for the heating fuel, a Bloomberg survey showed.  Eight of 14 analysts, or 57 percent, said futures will rise
on the  New York Mercantile Exchange  through Dec. 28. Five, or 36
percent, said prices will stay the same and one predicted gas
will  drop . Last week, 44 percent of participants said gas would
advance this week.  WSI Corp. in Andover,  Massachusetts , predicted colder-than-
normal weather in parts of the Midwest from Dec. 25 through Jan.
3. The low in Chicago on Dec. 27 may be 14 degrees Fahrenheit
(minus 10 Celsius), 6 lower than usual, according to AccuWeather
Inc. in  State College ,  Pennsylvania .  “A rebound is under way,”  Mike Fitzpatrick , editor of the
Energy OverView newsletter in New York, said yesterday as snow
pelted parts of the U.S. “The stormy weather in the Midwest,
with blizzard conditions, reminds us that winter is here.”  Natural gas jumped 13.7 cents, or 4.1 percent, to $3.451
per million Btu this week in New York. Prices are up 15 percent
this year, heading for the first annual gain since 2007.  A government report yesterday showed that U.S. stockpiles
fell more than expected last week, declining by 82 billion cubic
feet to 3.724 trillion. Analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg
predicted a withdrawal of 75 billion cubic feet. The five-year
average decrease for the period was 144 billion.  The gas survey has correctly forecast the direction of
prices 49 percent of the time since its June 2004 introduction.  Bloomberg’s survey of natural-gas analysts and traders asks
for an assessment of whether Nymex natural-gas futures will
probably rise, fall or remain neutral in the coming week. This
week’s results were:  RISE   FALL   NEUTRAL  8       1      5  To contact the reporter on this story:
