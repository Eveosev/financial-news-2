Copper rose in  London  after the
biggest fall in two months yesterday as data showed a rebound in
imports by  China , the biggest metal user.  Refined-copper imports by China last month climbed 8.7
percent from October to 250,666 metric tons, according to data
e-mailed by the General Administration of Customs today. Copper
production fell short of demand by 55,000 tons in September,
bringing the shortage for the year so far to 594,000 tons, the
International Copper Study Group said yesterday.  “After yesterday’s drop, today’s price action becomes
key,” Justin Froome, a broker at Marex Spectron Group in
London, said by e-mail today.  Copper for delivery in three months gained 0.2 percent to
$7,783.75 a ton by 10:28 a.m. on the London Metal Exchange.
Copper declined 3.5 percent this week, while it’s up 2.4
percent this year. Copper for March delivery rose 0.1 percent to
$3.54 a pound on the Comex in New York.  Sales of previously owned homes in the U.S., the second-
biggest copper consumer, climbed to a three-year high in
November, as manufacturing in the Philadelphia region
unexpectedly expanded in December to an eight-month high, both
beating economists’ forecast, reports showed yesterday. The
Copper Development Association says construction generates about
40 percent of demand for the metal, used in pipes and wiring.  LME copper  stockpiles  rose for a 12th day to 312,400 tons,
remaining at the highest level since February, data showed
today. Inventories gained on deliveries in Busan, South Korea,
bringing the advance this month to 26 percent, according to data
from the LME today. Orders to take copper from LME warehouses
dropped 0.1 percent to 53,225 tons.  Aluminum, nickel, lead, zinc and tin declined in London.  To contact the reporter on this story:
