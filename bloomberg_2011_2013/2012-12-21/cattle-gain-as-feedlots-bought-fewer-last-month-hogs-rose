Cattle gained, erasing earlier
losses, after a U.S. government report showed feedlots bought
fewer cattle in November compared with a year earlier as dry
weather reduces the amount of feed available. Hogs also gained.  Feedlots purchased 1.923 million animals in November, down
5.6 percent from the same month a year earlier, Department of
Agriculture data show. Feeders that lost about $118 a head on
cattle sold in November are reducing inventories, meaning fewer
slaughter-ready animals will be available in March or April.  “We’re going to have very tight numbers for a while,”
 Lane Broadbent , a vice president at KIS Futures in  Oklahoma
City , said by telephone. “Looking at the cattle numbers, the
herd is shrinking.”  Cattle futures for February delivery rose 0.1 percent to
settle at $1.33575 a pound at 1 p.m. on the  Chicago  Mercantile
Exchange. Prices, which touched a record $1.345 on Dec. 19, are
up 10 percent this year as the U.S. herd shrunk.  Feeder-cattle futures for March settlement fell less than
0.1 percent to $1.54775 a pound on the CME.  Hog futures for February settlement gained 0.5 percent to
86.9 cents a pound in Chicago.  To contact the reporter on this story:
