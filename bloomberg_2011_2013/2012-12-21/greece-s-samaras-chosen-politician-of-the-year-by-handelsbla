Greek Prime Minister Antonis Samaras
has been named politician of the year by  Germany ’s Handelsblatt
business newspaper, which praised his reform efforts.  Samaras is dealing with the “false Greek policies of the
past,” said Hans-Dietrich Genscher, Germany’s former foreign
minister, in his laudatory speech, according to Handelsblatt.
“This gave him the respect of his own people who are now on the
stony path to a new beginning.”  The jury drawn from Handelsblatt’s 200-member editorial
team selected the winners and losers of the year in 17
categories. Ulf Mark Schneider, chairman of the management board
of Fresenius SE, was chosen as the manager of the year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
