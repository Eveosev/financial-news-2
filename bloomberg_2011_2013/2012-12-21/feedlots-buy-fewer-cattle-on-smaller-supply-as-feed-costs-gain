U.S. feedlots bought 5.6 percent
fewer young cattle in November compared with a year earlier as
rising feed costs curbed profit prospects and supplies of
animals declined.  Feedlots purchased 1.923 million animals last month, down
from 2.037 million in November 2011, the  U.S. Department of
Agriculture  said today in a report. Eleven analysts surveyed by
 Bloomberg News  projected an 8.5 percent drop, on average. The
feedlot herd totaled 11.328 million as of Dec. 1, down 6 percent
from a year earlier. Analysts expected the inventory to be down
6.5 percent.  The price of corn, the main ingredient in livestock feed,
rose 15 percent in the 12 months through yesterday as the worst
U.S. drought since the 1930s eroded yields and destroyed
pastures. Feedlots probably lost about $118 a head on cattle
sold in November,  Rich Nelson , the chief strategist for
Allendale Inc. in McHenry,  Illinois , said in an e-mail.  “Tightening feeder-cattle supplies as well as negative
feeding margins contributed” to the decline in purchases of
young cattle,  Elaine Johnson , an analyst at Cattlehedging.com in
Westminster,  Colorado , said in an e-mail before the report.  Feedlot operators buy year-old animals that weigh 500
pounds (227 kilograms) to 800 pounds, called feeders. The cattle
are fattened on corn for about four to five months until they
weigh about 1,200 pounds, when they are sold to meatpackers.  Feedlots sold about 1.761 million animals to meatpackers
last month, down 0.7 percent from a year earlier, the USDA said.
Analysts expected 0.3 percent increase, on average.  Fattened-cattle futures for February delivery rose 0.1
percent to $1.33675 a pound at 12:56 p.m. on the Chicago
Mercantile Exchange. The price was up 9.9 percent this year
through yesterday.  Feeder-cattle futures for March settlement rose 0.1 percent
to $1.5505 a pound, and the commodity advanced 4.1 percent in
2012 through yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
