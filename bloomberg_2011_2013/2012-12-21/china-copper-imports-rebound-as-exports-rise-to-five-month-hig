Refined-copper  imports  by  China , the
biggest user, rebounded from a 15-month low in November as
exports climbed to the highest level in five months.  Inbound shipments were 250,666 metric tons last month, 8.7
percent higher than 230,695 tons in October, according to data
e-mailed by the General Administration of Customs today. Exports
gained for a third month to 20,975 tons, the highest since June,
data compiled by Bloomberg showed.  Exports from China are adding to the  stockpiles  at London
Metal Exchange warehouses as domestic production climbed to a
record level amid ample raw-material supplies. Rising
inventories may curb copper prices, which rose 3 percent this
year after falling for 21 percent in 2011.  “There is only moderate improvement in local demand in the
fourth quarter, so some companies would rather export than keep
the metal within China,”  Yuan  Zheng, an analyst at East  Asia 
Futures Co., said by phone from  Shanghai . “It’s likely that
exports will remain at a relatively high level compared with
only a few thousand tons in the past.”  London Metal Exchange copper stockpiles rose for an 11th
session to 311,925 tons yesterday, the longest rising streak
since January 2011. Those in Asia climbed to 120,250 tons
yesterday, the highest since October 2011, bourse data showed.  Metal for delivery in three months on the LME declined for
six straight days before rising as much as 0.9 percent to $7,840
a ton today.  Record Output  Refined-copper production advanced to a record 531,000 tons
last month from 520,000 tons a month earlier, according to the
National Bureau of Statistics.  Copper-concentrate  imports  rose for a fifth month to
831,606 tons, the highest since Bloomberg started compiling the
data in 2004. Treatment and refining charges on the  spot market 
in China rose to $66 per ton and 6 cents a pound from $45 and 4
cents since August, while concentrate inventories at smelters
declined in the fourth quarter, Macquarie Group Ltd. said in a
report on Dec. 19, citing its survey findings.  Inbound shipments of scrap copper gained to 470,300 tons,
the highest since September 2008, customs data showed today.  “It looks like there’s plenty of raw-material supplies to
support even higher domestic output,” said Xiao Jing, an
analyst at Beijing Capital Futures Co. “Stockpiles in China are
likely to remain high.”  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
