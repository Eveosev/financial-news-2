Flint Hills Resources LLC will
conduct maintenance work on its West crude unit at the Corpus
Christi  refinery  in  Texas  starting in February, according to a
person with knowledge of the situation.  The work will start Feb. 6 and is expected to last about 23
days, said the person, who asked not to be identified because
the information isnâ€™t public.  Planned maintenance will be conducted on a delayed coker at
the refinery complex from April 23 to May 19, said the person. A
fluid catalytic cracker will undergo work in October at the East
section, the person said.  Katie Stavinoha, a Houston-based spokeswoman for the
company, declined to comment in e-mails yesterday and today.  The Flint Hills Corpus Christi refinery has a capacity of
305,000 barrels a day, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
