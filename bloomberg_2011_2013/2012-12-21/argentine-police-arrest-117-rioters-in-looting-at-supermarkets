Police in the Argentine province of
 Buenos Aires  today arrested 117 people during looting at
supermarkets in two towns near the capital, Governor Daniel Scioli said.  The detentions in the country’s most populous province came
after attacks yesterday on stores in several other cities,
including the mountain resort of Bariloche and Rosario, a port
town on the Parana River, where two people were shot dead during
confrontations with police.  The looters smashed supermarket doors and stole goods from
food and beverages to flat-screen televisions, according to
images transmitted by television channels. Yesterday, President
 Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner  sent federal police to Bariloche
to help restore calm.  “Some criminals have created the riots,” Scioli said
today. “I want to have order, tranquility and respect for
property rights in this province.”  South America ’s second-biggest economy faced rioting and
looting in December 2001, when a financial crisis led the
government to freeze bank accounts and unemployment surged to a
record 22 percent. The riots, in which more than two dozen
people died, led to the resignation of President Fernando de la
Rua and were followed by the country’s default on $95 billion of
debt.  “There are sectors with their own agenda trying to
generate chaos in  Argentina ,” Cabinet Chief Juan Manuel Abal Medina said in comments posted on the presidential website.
“The government is being very active and strongly condemns”
the looting, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
