Cia. Energetica de Minas Gerais ,
 Brazil ’s biggest electric utility, rose the most in four years
as  Banco Bradesco SA (BBDC4)  recommended investors buy the stock after
executives resisted government-mandated price cuts.  Shares of the Belo Horizonte-based company known as Cemig
jumped 6.1 percent to 25.15 reais at the close of trading in Sao
Paulo, the highest since Sept. 19. President  Dilma Rousseff  on
Sept. 11 announced a plan to cut power costs to aid households
and manufacturers. It was the second-biggest gainer on the
country’s benchmark Bovespa index, which fell 0.4 percent.  Cemig Chief Executive Officer Djalma Morais said Dec. 4 he
wouldn’t renew contracts with the federal government to operate
18 hydroelectric plants because the terms were unfavorable. As a
condition of the renewal, the utility to would have to cut rates
for its customers, according to Rousseff’s plan.  “The company showed commitment to its shareholders by not
renewing the generation concessions,” Vladimir Pinto and
Marcelo Sa, analysts at Bradesco’s brokerage unit, wrote in a
note to clients published today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
