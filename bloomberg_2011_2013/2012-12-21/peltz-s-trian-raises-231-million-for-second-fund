Nelson Peltz , the  money manager  who
successfully pushed  Ingersoll-Rand Plc (IR)  to sell some of its
businesses, has raised $231 million for a second strategic
investment fund, according to a regulatory filing.  Trian Partners Strategic Investment Fund II LP began taking
money on Dec. 11 and has received commitments from five
investors, according to a Form D filing today with the U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission. The total raised may
increase to as much as $2 billion, New York-based Trian said in
the filing.  Anne Tarbell , a spokeswoman for Trian, didn’t immediately
return a telephone call seeking comment.  Peltz, 70, is known for taking stakes in companies and then
engaging management in efforts to increase  shareholder value .
His first strategic investment fund, marketed as a vehicle that
would take minority stakes in public companies and seek board
representation, listed assets of $757 million in Trian’s most
recent registration with the SEC.  The first strategic fund provided Peltz with some of the
money he used to acquire what was initially a 7.3 percent stake
in Ingersoll-Rand, a Swords, Ireland, company that generated
about $14.8 billion in  revenue  last year. Ingersoll-Rand’s
products include air-conditioning systems, climate control
technologies and security systems.  As part of an agreement with Peltz, Ingersoll-Rand
announced earlier this month that the company would spin off its
residential and commercial security businesses within the next
year. Ingersoll-Rand shares have climbed about 56 percent so far
this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
