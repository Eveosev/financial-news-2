China’s stocks  fell from a four-
month high, led by financial companies, on concern a rally that
has lifted shares from an almost four-year low is excessive.  China  Minsheng Banking Corp. led declines for lenders after
the shares jumped to a two-year high this month.  Poly Real
Estate (600048)  Group Co., the second-biggest property developer, dropped
1.5 percent after the China Securities Journal said the
government may introduce new housing curbs. Datong Coal Industry
Co., China’s third-largest coal company by capacity, advanced 1
percent as the government said it will restrict the output of
some types of coal, boosting speculation prices may rise.  “There’s some profit taking after a round of decent gains
and the market is taking a breather here,” said  Wang Zheng ,
Shanghai-based chief investment officer at Jingxi Investment
Management Co., which manages $120 million. “But the momentum
is there and the rally may extend further.”  The  Shanghai Composite Index (SHCOMP)  retreated 0.7 percent to
2,153.31 at the close, trimming this week’s gain to 0.1 percent.
It finished at the highest since Aug. 10 yesterday. The  CSI 300
Index (SHSZ300)  lost 0.5 percent to 2,372, while the  Hang Seng China
Enterprises Index (HSCEI)  slid 1.1 percent. The  Bloomberg China-US 55
Index (CH55BN)  added 0.5 percent in  New York  yesterday.  The Shanghai Composite has risen 9.9 percent since Dec. 3,
when it closed at its lowest level since January 2009, on signs
the economic recovery is gathering momentum. The measure trades
at 10.5 times estimated earnings, the highest since May,
according to weekly  data  compiled by Bloomberg.  The 14-day relative strength measure for the Shanghai
Composite, measuring how rapidly prices have advanced or dropped
during a specified time period, was at 69.4 yesterday. Readings
above 70 indicate a price may be poised to fall.  Banks Drop  The Shanghai index fell 2.1 percent this year. Trading
volumes were 38 percent higher today than the 30-day average
this year. Thirty-day  volatility  was at 20.1, compared with this
year’s average of 17.  A measure of financial stocks in the CSI 300 sank 0.9
percent, the third most among the 10 industry groups. Minsheng
Banking fell 1.4 percent to 7.33  yuan , paring this year’s gain
to 24 percent.  China Construction Bank Corp. (601939) , the country’s
second-largest bank, lost 2.7 percent to 4.41 yuan.  China Vanke Co., the biggest developer, lost 0.5 percent to
9.43 yuan. Poly Real Estate slipped 1.5 percent to 12.12 yuan.
China Merchants Property Development Co., the third largest,
slid 1.6 percent to 25.97 yuan.  China “won’t rule out the possibility” of introducing new
housing curbs after the  property market  rebounded in November
and some regions saw “irrational exuberance,” the China
Securities Journal reported today, citing an unidentified person
in the industry.  Growth Outlook  New home prices climbed in 53 of the 70 cities from the
previous month in November, compared with 35 in October, the
National Bureau of Statistics said on Oct. 18. That was the most
in 18 months.  China’s swap market is the most bullish on the world’s
second-largest economy in 18 months amid signs of a rebound from
a seven-quarter slowdown. The  World Bank  estimated this week
that economic growth will rebound to 8.4 percent in 2013, from a
13-year low of 7.9 percent in 2012, as earlier monetary easing
takes effect and local governments boost spending.  Optimism for an economic rebound is helping attract funds
and strengthen the yuan. Qualified foreign institutional
investors purchases of stocks listed on the  Shanghai Stock
Exchange  have risen since August, the China Securities Journal
reported today, citing data from the China Securities Regulatory
Commission. Net stock purchases were three times those of the
January-July period, it said.  Coal Stocks  Datong Coal rose 1 percent to 9.03 yuan.  Guizhou Panjiang
Refined Coal Co. (600395)  climbed 2.3 percent to 16.69 yuan. Shanxi
Lanhua Sci-Tech Venture Co. added 0.8 percent to 19.70 yuan.  China requires the efficient use of special and rare coal
including coking and anthracitic coal and forbids waste,
according to a statement posted on the National Development and
Reform Commission’s website.  Power-station coal in  Asia  is poised to rebound in 2013
from the steepest annual decline in seven years as utilities in
China and the U.S. burn more of the fuel to feed their growing
economies. Thermal coal at the Australian port of Newcastle may
average $98 a metric ton next year, according to the median
estimate of seven analysts in a Bloomberg survey this month.  In the U.S., House Republican leaders canceled a planned
vote on Speaker  John Boehner ’s plan to raise rates for taxpayers
making more than $1 million. Fewer than two weeks remain to
avert more than $600 billion in automatic spending cuts and tax
increases, known as the fiscal cliff, set to start in January.  The U.S. is China’s second-largest export market, making up
about 17 percent of the nation’s overseas shipments, according
to Shenyin & Wanguo Securities Co.  Chinese stocks rose in New York yesterday, led by SouFun
Holdings Ltd. The iShares FTSE China 25 Index Fund, the biggest
Chinese exchange-traded fund in the U.S., climbed 0.7 percent to
$39.75, the highest price in nine months. The ETF has risen 14
percent this year.  --Zhang Shidong. Editors: Allen Wan, Darren Boey  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
