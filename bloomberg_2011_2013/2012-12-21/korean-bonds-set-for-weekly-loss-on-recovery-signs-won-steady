South Korea ’s five-year bonds gained
the most in six weeks as concern U.S. lawmakers will fail to
agree on budget revisions spurred demand for the safety of
sovereign debt.  Government securities  rebounded from an earlier decline as
the  Kospi index  of shares fell 1 percent in the biggest loss in
more than a month. House Republican leaders canceled a planned
vote on Speaker  John Boehner ’s plan to allow higher tax rates
for annual income above $1 million, threatening efforts to avert
more than $600 billion of tax increases and spending cuts. The
won was little changed.  “Stocks plunged after reports on the U.S. vote
cancellation, supporting bonds,” said Huh Kwan, a Seoul-based
fixed-income trader at Korea Investment & Securities Co.
“Still, bonds were facing a correction recently, and I don’t
expect today’s rebound to last long.”  The yield on the 2.75 percent debt due September 2017 fell
three basis points, or 0.03 percentage point, to 3.01 percent in
 Seoul , Korea Exchange Inc. That’s the biggest decline since Nov.
8. The rate rose to 3.05 percent earlier, and is up one basis
point this week. Five-year  bonds  yielded 3.46 percent at the end
of 2011. The one-year interest-rate swap fell one basis point
today to 2.80 percent.  Bank of Korea  predicted on Dec. 13 a “moderate” export-
led recovery in South Korea’s economy. Data due next week is
forecast to show the nation’s factory output  increased  0.8
percent in November from the previous month, the fastest pace
since May, according to a Bloomberg News survey.  The won closed at 1,074.35 per dollar, from 1,074.85
yesterday and 1,074.68 a week ago, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. It gained 7.3 percent this year, the best performance
among  Asia ’s 11 most-used currencies.  One-month implied volatility, a measure of expected moves
in exchange rates used to price options, slid 15 basis points to
4.75 percent today. It has fallen from 13.55 percent at the end
of last year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
