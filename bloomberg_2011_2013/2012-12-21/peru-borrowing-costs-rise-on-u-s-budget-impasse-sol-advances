Peru ’s benchmark  borrowing costs  in
dollars rose the most in six weeks as stalled U.S. budget talks
threatened growth in the world’s largest economy, damping demand
for higher-yielding, emerging-market assets.  The extra yield investors demand to own Peruvian government
bonds instead of U.S. Treasuries climbed five basis points, or
0.05 percentage point, to 115 basis points at 2:24 p.m. in New
York, according to JPMorgan Chase & Co. The increase is the
steepest since Nov. 7.  The U.S., Peru’s biggest trading partner after  China , faces
more than $600 billion in automatic spending cuts and tax
increases known as the fiscal cliff, scheduled to take effect
Jan. 1 if Congress can’t agree on a budget. Global stocks
slumped after House Republican leaders canceled a scheduled vote
on a plan to allow higher tax rates for annual incomes above $1
million.  “Markets are very negative” because of concern political
leaders “won’t reach an agreement to avoid the fiscal cliff,”
Antonio Diaz, a trader at Banco Internacional del Peru in  Lima ,
said in a phone interview.  The sol appreciated 0.1 percent to 2.5580 per U.S. dollar
at today’s close, according to Deutsche Bank AG’s local unit.
The central bank bought $40 million in the spot market and said
on its website it paid an average 2.5620 soles per dollar.  The yield on the nation’s 7.35 percent dollar bond due in
July 2025 dropped one basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, to
3.03 percent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The price
rose 0.15 cent to 144.90 cents per dollar.  To contact the reporter on this story:
