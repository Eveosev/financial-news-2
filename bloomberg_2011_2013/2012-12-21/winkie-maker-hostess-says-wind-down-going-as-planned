Hostess Brands Inc., the bankrupt
maker of Twinkies snack cakes which last month won a judge’s
approval to cease operations, said its wind-down is proceeding
as planned.  Lawyers for the baker today also told U.S. Bankruptcy Judge
Robert Drain in White Plains, New York, that its cake brands
will have separate so-called stalking horses making initial
offers in an asset auction. Heather Lennox, a lawyer for Irving,
Texas-based Hostess, said potential buyers are interested in
brands and equipment.  The wind-down “needs to be an orderly process so I can
make a good finding” that any sale is proper, Drain said.  The judge also granted an extension of the period during
which Hostess has the exclusive right to submit a bankruptcy
plan.  Hostess, the 82-year-old maker of Ding Dongs, Ho Hos and
Drake’s Devil Dogs, said it was pushed into liquidation when its
bakers’ union went on strike Nov. 9 after Drain imposed contract
concessions opposed by 92 percent of the union’s members.  The company sought court protection in January, its second
time in bankruptcy, listing assets of $982 million and debt of
$1.43 billion.  The case is In re Hostess Brands Inc., 12-22052, U.S.
Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of New York (White Plains).  To contact the reporter on this story:
