UBS AG (UBSN) , Switzerland’s largest bank,
appointed Sam Kendall as global head of the equity capital
markets division, according to an internal memo obtained by
 Bloomberg News .  Kendall, who assumes the newly created post immediately,
will report to David Soanes, London-based global head of global
capital markets, and Matthew Hanning, head of  investment banking 
for the Asia Pacific region, who is based in Hong Kong,
according to Mark Panday, a Hong Kong-based spokesman at the
bank who confirmed the content of the memo.  UBS is shrinking its investment bank and pledged to exit
most of its fixed-income trading businesses, focusing on  wealth
management  to boost profitability. The lender had 1.71 billion
Swiss francs ($1.87 billion) of revenue from advisory and
underwriting in the first nine months of 2012, trailing Credit
Suisse Group Inc.’s 2.27 billion francs and Goldman Sachs Group
Inc.’s $3.52 billion.  UBS rose to first place in underwriting stock and
convertible bond offerings in the Asia-Pacific region outside
Japan this year, recaptured the top rank for the first time
since 2010, according to data compiled by Bloomberg that exclude
self-led sales.  Kendall, who joined UBS in Australia in 1996 and most
recently led the bank’s equity capital markets team in Asia,
will remain in  Hong Kong , according to the memo, reported
earlier today by the Wall Street Journal.  To contact the reporters on this story:
