James Polk was an unlikely
president: A dark horse, he had no military experience and no
national profile. What he had was a lust for land.  (To listen to the podcast, click  here .)  Polk’s family wealth came from speculation and slavery, and
he was a firm believer in Manifest Destiny. After taking office
in 1845, he sent troops into disputed Mexican territory, and
when 11 American soldiers were killed north of the Rio Grande,
he had his justification for expansionist aggression against a
weaker neighbor.  Abraham Lincoln  questioned Polk’s version of events, but
most Congressmen, afraid of seeming unpatriotic, voted for the
war with Mexico. An antiwar movement soon sprang up across the
country, including soldiers sickened by U.S. atrocities.  The 1848 Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo added much of
California, Nevada, Utah and parts of Arizona,  New Mexico ,
Colorado, Kansas and Oklahoma to the U.S. It also recognized the
annexation of Texas.  I spoke with Amy Greenberg, author of “A Wicked War: Polk,
Clay, Lincoln and the 1846 U.S. Invasion of Mexico,” on the
following topics:  1. Manifest Destiny  2. Invasion of Mexico  3. Lust for California  4. Texas Slavery  5. Preamble to Civil War  To buy this book in North America, click  here .  ( Lewis Lapham  is the founder of  Lapham’s Quarterly  and the
