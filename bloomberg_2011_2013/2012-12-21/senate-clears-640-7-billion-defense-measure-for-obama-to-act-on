The  U.S. Senate  approved legislation
authorizing Defense Department programs and spending for the
current fiscal year, clearing it for President  Barack Obama  to
act on.  The measure calls for $640.7 billion for the Pentagon and
related defense programs at agencies such as the Energy
Department for the year that began Oct. 1. The Senate voted 81-
14 today for the compromise bill crafted by a House-Senate
conference committee. The House passed it yesterday.  The measure includes more money than the Obama
administration sought for weapons built by  Huntington Ingalls
Industries Inc. (HII)  and  General Dynamics Corp. (GD)  and  Northrop Grumman
Corp. (NOC)   To contact the reporter on this story:
