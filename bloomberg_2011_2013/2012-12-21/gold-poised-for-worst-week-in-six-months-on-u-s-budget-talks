Gold headed for the worst week in
six months as the struggle by U.S. lawmakers to reach a budget
deal strengthened the dollar, countering purchases by central
banks and investors. Silver dropped to a four-month low.  Spot gold fell as much as 0.7 percent to $1,635.80 an ounce
and was at $1,641.70 by 11:35 a.m. in  Singapore . It declined to
$1,635.70 yesterday, the lowest price since Aug. 22, after data
showed the U.S. economy grew at a 3.1 percent annual rate last
quarter, exceeding all projections in a Bloomberg survey.
Bullion is 3.2 percent lower this week, the most since the
period to June 22, set for a fourth weekly drop.  Bullion is 5 percent higher this year, set for a 12th
annual gain, as central banks joined investors in buying gold to
diversify assets. The dollar snapped a five-day decline today
after House Republican leaders canceled a planned vote on
Speaker John Boehner’s plan to allow higher tax rates for annual
income above $1 million amid stalled budget talks. Fewer than
two weeks remain to avert more than $600 billion in automatic
spending cuts and tax increases, known as the fiscal cliff.  “There are risks around the negotiations and that’s a big
part of what’s moving the markets now,” Alexandra Knight, an
analyst at National Australia Bank Ltd., said from  Melbourne .
“Until that gets resolved, there’ll be a lot of volatility in
the market.”  Record ETPs  Gold for February delivery fell 0.3 percent to $1,641.50 an
ounce on the Comex in New York. Holdings in ETPs expanded 12
percent this year to a record 2,632.516 metric tons yesterday,
data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Brazil  boosted gold reserves
for a third month in November to double the country’s holdings
and push them to the highest level in 12 years, joining Belarus
and  Russia  in adding to bullion assets last month.  Cash silver fell as much as 1.1 percent to $29.645 an ounce,
the cheapest since Aug. 22, before trading at $29.815, trimming
this year’s advance to 7.1 percent. Silver is 7.7 percent lower
this week for the worst such performance since December 2011.  Spot platinum dropped as much as 0.5% to $1,543.25 an ounce,
the lowest price since Nov. 9, falling for a fifth day. The best
performing precious metal, which last traded at $1,549.75, is
down for the first week in three, paring this year’s gain to 11
percent. Palladium fell 0.6 percent to $675.50 an ounce.  To contact the reporter on this story:
