Penalties against Barclays Plc and
UBS AG for their roles in the Libor rate-rigging scandal helped
the U.K.  Financial Services Authority  more than triple its
previous fines record in 2010 to at least 312 million pounds
($506 million) this year.  The FSA’s penalties would have been even higher, at more
than 400 million pounds, without discounts granted in about two-
thirds of cases for cooperation with the regulator, London-based
law firm  Reynolds Porter Chamberlain LLP  said in an e-mailed
statement.  The FSA fined Barclays, the U.K.’s second-biggest bank,
around 60 million pounds and UBS 160 million pounds this year
for attempting to manipulate the London benchmark interbank
interest rate, known as Libor.  “The two huge fines for rate-rigging will be followed by
several others next year, which means we could see another
record year of fines for financial services businesses,”
Richard Burger, a partner at RPC, said the statement.  Global authorities are investigating claims that more than
a dozen banks altered submissions used to set benchmarks to
profit from bets on interest-rate derivatives or make the
lenders’ finances appear healthier.  UBS was also fined 29.7 million pounds last month by the
FSA and told by Swiss supervisors that it may have to increase
capital levels for operational risks after a $2.3 billion loss
from unauthorized trading by Kweku Adoboli.  The former trader in UBS’s London office was sentenced to
seven years in jail on Nov. 20 for fraud in relation to the
loss, the largest from unauthorized trading in British history.  To contact the reporter on this story:
