North Korea confirmed it detained
an American citizen after he entered the country last month to
lead a tour.  The man, identified as Pae Jun Ho, has confessed to
committing a crime against North Korea after entering the
country on Nov. 3, KCNA reported. The crime wasn’t specified.
The man was visited today by officials from the Swedish embassy,
which looks after interests of the U.S. in the nation, according
to KCNA.  CNN  reported on Dec. 11 that the American, identified as
Kenneth Bae, was involved with a Protestant religious movement.  North Korea drew condemnation from the UN Security Council
after launching a long-range rocket that put a satellite into
orbit on Dec. 11. The reclusive state marked the one-year
anniversary of Kim Jong-Il’s death earlier this week.  Two American journalists were detained after crossing the
border between  China  and North Korea in March 2009 and held for
illegal entry. Euna Lee and Laura Ling were released in August
after former President Bill Clinton visited Pyongyang to press
for a pardon.  To contact the reporter on this story:
