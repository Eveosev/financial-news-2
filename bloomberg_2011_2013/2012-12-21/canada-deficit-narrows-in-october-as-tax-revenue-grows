Canadaâ€™s  federal budget  deficit
narrowed in October from a year earlier as  tax revenue 
accelerated.  The shortfall narrowed to C$1.68 billion ($1.69 billion)
during the month from C$2.13 billion a year earlier, the finance
department said in a monthly report from Ottawa. Total revenue
rose 8 percent, reflecting receipts of corporate income taxes
that came earlier this year, it said. Program expenses rose 6.1
percent to C$20 billion.  Canadian Finance Minister  Jim Flaherty  is aiming to balance
the federal budget before the next federal election expected in
2015 by cutting costs and forgoing new spending, even as revenue
growth slows. Canada projects a deficit of C$26 billion in the
current fiscal year that began in April, little changed from a
year earlier.  The government has cut its payroll by 10,980 positions in
the six months since the last budget targeted a reduction of
19,200, Treasury Board President  Tony Clement  said in a Nov. 16
 statement .  The deficit in the first seven months of the fiscal year
narrowed to C$10.6 billion from C$13.9 billion in the previous
period. Revenue rose 3.6 percent in the period, while program
expenses were up 2 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
