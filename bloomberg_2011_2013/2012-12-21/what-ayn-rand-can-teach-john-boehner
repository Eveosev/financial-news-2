All this talk about Plan B got me thinking about Project X. What's Project X, you ask? Randians (that's  Ayn Rand  to the uninitiated) will recall it from "Atlas Shrugged" as a sonic weapon of mass destruction being developed by the State Science Institute. With the nation's producers on strike, Project X is the government's last gasp to exert control over a collapsing economy. Without getting into the twists and turns of Rand's magnum opus, suffice it to say the government bureaucrats, struggling for control of Project X, trigger it accidentally, destroying the weapon and everything in sight. The goal of Plan B -- House Speaker  John Boehner 's WMD -- which would have raised taxes on real millionaires, was to shift the blame to President  Barack Obama , who threatened to veto the measure. That way, Obama would be responsible for allowing taxes to increase on all Americans on Jan. 1. Boehner had to  pull the bill  last night because he didn't have the votes. He sent his members home until after Christmas. The moral of the story? Know your WMD and make sure it can't implode on itself. ( Caroline Baum  is a Bloomberg View columnist.
