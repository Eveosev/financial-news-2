The U.K. Treasury hired McKinsey &
Co. partner Charles Roxburgh to head its financial-services
division, overseeing all issues relating to banks and the
financial system.  Roxburgh replaces Jonathan Taylor, who will become vice-
president of the European Investment Bank, the Treasury said in
an e-mailed statement today. A graduate of Cambridge University
and
Harvard, Roxburgh joined McKinsey in 1986 to become head of
relations with financial-services companies and head the
McKinsey Global Institute, a research arm of the firm.  To contact the reporter on this story:
