Pork inventories in the U.S. rose
13 percent in the 12 months through November as hog slaughter
increased, the government said.  Warehouses held 558.035 million pounds of the meat on Nov.
30, up from 495.117 million on Nov. 30, 2011, the  U.S.
Department of Agriculture  said today in a report. Inventories
fell 7.5 percent from the end of October. Wholesale- pork  prices
fell 1.2 percent last month, USDA data show.  Commercial pork  production  in the first 11 months of the
year totaled 21.297 billion pounds (9.66 million metric tons),
up 2.9 percent from the same period a year earlier, the
government said in a separate report today. About 10.105
million hogs were slaughtered in November, 0.6 percent more
than a year earlier, USDA data show.  “There’s still a good correlation between production
levels and cold-storage stocks,”  Bob Brown , an independent
market consultant in Edmond,  Oklahoma , said in a telephone
interview before the report. “We’ve just continued this string
that we’ve had of record high production.”  Hog futures for February settlement rose 0.5 percent to
86.9 cents a pound at 12:55 p.m. on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange. Prices were up 2.6 percent this year through
yesterday.  As of Nov. 30, stockpiles of  pork bellies , which are cured
and sliced to make bacon, fell 8.4 percent from a year earlier
to 24.4 million pounds, according to today’s report. Warehouse
supplies of ham rose 3.1 percent from a year ago to 97.7
million pounds.  Chicken-meat inventories at the end of November were 3.6
percent larger than a year earlier at 674.8 million pounds, the
USDA said. Beef supplies fell 0.6 percent to 441 million
pounds.  To contact the reporter on this story:
