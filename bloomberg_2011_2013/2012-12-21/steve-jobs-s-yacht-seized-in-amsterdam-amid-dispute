A yacht built for the late  Apple
Inc. (AAPL)  founder  Steve Jobs  was seized in the port of Amsterdam on
behalf of the designer Philippe Starck over a 3 million-euro
bill ($3.96 million), a port spokesman said.  The ship, called Venus, was seized recently and Jobs’s
heirs and representatives of Starck are negotiating to end the
dispute, Jeroen Ranzijn, an Amsterdam-based spokesman of the
port, said by phone today. “The expectation is that the heirs
and the Starck firm reach a settlement soon, maybe in the next
few hours,” he said.  The claim is based on agreement that Starck would receive 6
percent of the vessel’s construction costs, which were
originally estimated at 150 million euros, Het Financieele
Dagblad reported today, citing Roelant Klaassen, a lawyer
representing Starck. Jobs’s heirs say the vessel only cost 105
million euros to build, the newspaper reported.  The yacht has been at the Alaska dock in the Amsterdam port
since Dec. 8, Ranzijn said. All aluminum and 78.2 meters (265
feet) long, the ship was launched on Oct. 28, according to the
website of Feadship, the Dutch company that built it.  Klaassen and the press department of Starck couldn’t
immediately be reached for comment. The yacht was seized by
bailiffs Agin Boeder, based in Haarlem,  Netherlands , Ranzijn
said. The firm declined to comment when contacted by phone
today.  To contact the reporters on this story:
