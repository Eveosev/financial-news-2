Brazil boosted  gold reserves  for a
third month in November to double the country’s holdings since
August as central banks from Russia to  Belarus  and South Korea
add the metal to diversify their assets.  Brazilian holdings expanded 14.7 metric tons in November to
67.2 tons, the most since November 2000, according to data on
the International Monetary Fund’s website. The country bought
17.2 tons in October after adding 1.7 tons in September, the
first increase since 2008. Russia’s holdings increased 2.9 tons
last month and Belarus’s reserves expanded 1.4 tons, the data
show. Turkey pared holdings 5.9 tons and Mexico sold 0.1 ton.  Central banks have been expanding reserves as the metal
heads for a 12th annual gain and investors hold a record amount
in bullion-backed  exchange-traded products . Nations bought 373.9
tons in the first nine months of the year and full-year
additions will probably be at the bottom end of a range from 450
to 500 tons, the London-based World Gold Council estimates.  “Central banks, particularly in the emerging economies,
are looking to increase the proportion of gold in their reserve
assets,” Alexandra Knight, an analyst at National Australia
Bank Ltd., said from Melbourne. “That will drive prices of gold
because they can be quite significant purchases.”  Gold for immediate delivery traded at $1,647.41 an ounce at
4:09 p.m. in Singapore, up 5.4 percent this year. Still, the
metal slumped to $1,635.70 yesterday, the cheapest since Aug. 22,
as data showed the  U.S. economy  is improving.  Total Reserves  The proportion of gold as a share of total reserves is much
smaller in emerging economies than advanced countries, and
there’s probably going to be a continued push to increase the
amount of metal held, Knight said.  The U.S., Germany, Italy and France hold more than 70
percent of their reserves in gold, according to data from the
producer-funded WGC. The share in Brazil, the largest emerging
economy after  China , is 0.8 percent, the data show.  In October, Iraq sold 1 ton of bullion after buying 2.3
tons in September and 23.9 tons in August, according to the IMF
data. The acquisition in August was the first by the country
since at least 2004. There was no figure for last month.  In Asia, the  Bank of Korea  increased gold reserves 20
percent last month to diversify investments, boosting holdings
for the fourth time since June 2011, according to a statement
Dec. 5. Gold is a physical, safe asset, the Bank of Korea said.  Weaker Dollar  Gold has advanced as central banks from the U.S. to Europe
and  Japan  ramp up stimulus to boost their economies, stoking
concern that currencies will be debased and inflation may
accelerate. The Dollar Index, a gauge against six counterparts
has lost 1 percent this year, set for the first drop since 2009.  The U.S. Federal Reserve said Dec. 12 it would buy $45
billion of  Treasury securities  a month from January, adding to
$40 billion a month of existing mortgage-debt purchases. The
 Bank of Japan  expanded an asset-purchase program for the third
time in four months yesterday.  Gold will probably peak in 2013 and keep declining the
following year as U.S. growth accelerates, Goldman Sachs Group
Inc. said in a report on Dec. 5. Immediate-delivery metal
reached a record $1,921.15 an ounce in September 2011.  The metal is Morgan Stanley’s top commodity pick for 2013
on buying by central banks, geopolitical uncertainty and low so-
called real  interest rates , analysts including  Peter Richardson 
and  Hussein Allidina  wrote in a Dec. 6 report. The bank expects
bullion to average $1,853 an ounce next year.  Prices have been supported by so-called official-sector
buying, David Gornall, chairman of the London Bullion Market
Association, told a conference last month. China may add more to
reserves as the metal accounts for a lower share of total
holdings compared with the U.S., he said in  Hong Kong . Official-
sector buying was 439.7 tons in 2011, the highest since 1964.  Holdings in gold-backed ETPs reached a record 2,632.516
tons yesterday, and are 12 percent higher this year, data
compiled by Bloomberg show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
