Petrol Group d.d. , Slovenia’s
biggest energy company, sold its 32.63 percent stake in
 Istrabenz (ITBG)  d.d. to two domestic investors.  Petrol sold its 1.69 million shares in the Slovenian
holding company to Sava d.d. and KB 1909, in an effort to
dispose of all assets that are not yielding “required
returns,” the Ljubljana-based company said in a regulatory
filing today.  Its shares traded at 230.90 euros or 0.39 percent up on the
day at 2:30 p.m. in Ljubljana, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
