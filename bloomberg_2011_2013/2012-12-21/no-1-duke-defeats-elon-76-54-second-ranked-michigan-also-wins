Top-ranked Duke University extended
its win streak to 11 straight with a 76-54 college basketball

Michigan topped Eastern Michigan University 93-54.  Mason Plumlee led the Blue Devils with 21 points and 15
rebounds and Ryan Kelly added 14 points last night at Cameron
Indoor Stadium in Durham, North Carolina.  Duke improved to 11-0 as the Blue Devils hit 11 of 19 3-

Devils over finalists Stanford, Michigan State, Florida and BYU.  As a junior, Parker was chosen as the national Gatorade
Player of the Year after averaging 19.5 points, 8.9 rebounds and
