Starbucks Coffee Japan Ltd. (2712) , an
affiliate of the world’s largest coffee-shop operator, said it
began telling Japanese customers it reduced the amount of coffee
it pours into each cup.  In response to customer inquiries, Starbucks  Japan  posted a
notice at its 965 stores today explaining that it reduced the
amount in drip coffee by 9 millimeters (0.35 inch), Norio Adachi, a Tokyo-based spokesman, said by phone today. The move
is intended to help customers avoid spilling drinks and give
them room to add milk, the company said in the note.  “It was designed for customer service, not to cut costs,”
Adachi said. “We needed to clarify the policy in an
announcement.”  In the notice, Tokyo-based Starbucks Japan said that on
Dec. 5 it changed its guidelines for pouring drip coffee to 15
millimeters below the rim, down from 6 millimeters previously.
Starbucks’s staff will fill cups higher upon request, it said.
Bloomberg News reported the policy yesterday.  A small cup of drip coffee costs 300 yen ($3.60) at outlets
in Japan, more than double the $1.70 after tax in  Seattle , where
 Starbucks Corp. (SBUX)  is based.  To contact the reporters on this story:
