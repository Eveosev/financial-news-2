European (SXXP)  stocks fell from a 19-month
high as U.S. House Republicans canceled a vote on higher taxes
for top earners, fueling concern budget talks will fail.  Aeroports de Paris slumped the most in 16 months after
lowering its profit and traffic-growth projections.
 ArcelorMittal (MT)  slid 2.5 percent after posting a $4.3 billion
writedown. A gauge of mining companies retreated.  The Stoxx Europe 600 Index dropped 0.3 percent to 280.95 at
the close in London, paring its weekly gain to 0.6 percent. The
benchmark measure is still rallying for the seventh straight
month and has surged 15 percent so far this year as the  European
Central Bank  and the  Federal Reserve  expanded asset purchases.  “The stalemate in  Washington  is not really increasing the
probability of a favorable outcome this year,” said Witold Bahrke, a senior strategist at PFA Pension A/S in Copenhagen,
where he helps oversee $55 billion. “As of now, it points to a
solution in the new year. Towards the year-end, politics will
continue to overshadow economics and fundamentals.”  The volume of shares changing hands on Stoxx 600 companies
was 56 percent more than the average of the last 30 days,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Indexes pared earlier losses after a report showed orders
for durable goods in the U.S. climbed 0.7 percent last month,
beating the median forecast for a 0.3 percent increase in a
Bloomberg survey. A separate release showed U.S.  consumer
confidence  fell in December to a five-month low.  Fiscal Cliff  U.S. House Speaker  John Boehner , a Republican, scrapped a
plan to allow higher tax rates on annual incomes above $1
million, yielding to resistance from party colleagues. Talks
between Boehner and President  Barack Obama  are stalled with 10
days to go before the year-end deadline for a budget compromise.  House members and senators won’t vote on the end-of-year
budget issues until after Christmas, giving them less than a
week to reach agreement to avert more than $600 billion of tax
increases and spending cuts set to take effect in January.  The  Congressional Budget Office  says the U.S. will probably
tumble back into a recession should lawmakers fail to reach an
accord on the budget.  National benchmark indexes fell in 12 of the 18 western
European markets. France’s CAC 40 slid 0.2 percent. Germany’s
DAX lost 0.5 percent. The U.K.’s FTSE 100 declined 0.3 percent.  Aeroports de Paris (ADP)  slumped 5.4 percent to 58.62 euros, the
biggest decline since August 2011, after cutting projections for
earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization
and for traffic growth.  Slower Demand  ADP now expects Ebitda growth of 25 percent to 35 percent
between 2009 and 2015, compared with its previous forecast of 40
percent. The operator of Charles de Gaulle and Orly airports
also expects an annual traffic-growth rate ranging from 1.9
percent to 2.9 percent between 2010 and 2015, lower than a
previous estimate of 3.2 percent.  ArcelorMittal dropped 2.5 percent to 12.88 euros. The
world’s biggest steelmaker will write down the goodwill in its
European businesses by about $4.3 billion as the region’s
weakening economy erodes demand.  The writedown will take the form of a non-cash impairment
charge recorded in the fourth quarter of 2012, the Luxembourg-
based company said. Steel consumption in  Europe  has dropped by
about 8 percent this year, it said.  Eurasian Natural Resources Corp., a producer of ferro
alloys and iron ore in Kazakhstan, slid 1.4 percent to 276.9
pence. The stock was cut to neutral from buy at Goldman Sachs
Group Inc. A measure of the  shares of commodity companies 
declined for a third day.  Alcatel Outlook  Alcatel-Lucent SA (ALU)  lost 3.8 percent to 1.02 euro. Standard &
Poor’s may cut the French network-equipment vendor’s long-term
rating. “Ongoing cash losses and rising interest costs could
offset the positive impact” of its recent refinancing on
liquidity, the ratings company said.  Alcatel’s shares rallied 24 percent since their Dec. 13
close through yesterday after the company reached a 1.6 billion-
euro ($2.1 billion) financing deal.  Spectris Plc (SXS)  fell 1.5 percent to 2,019 pence, for the
largest drop in more than a month. the U.K.’s biggest maker of
production-testing gear was downgraded to hold from buy at
Investec.  Skanska AB (SKAB)  dropped 1.9 percent to 108.40 kronor. The Nordic
region’s biggest construction company will take a 500 million
kronor ($77 million) charge on its Latin American operations in
the fourth quarter.  William Hill Plc (WMH) , the U.K. bookmaker with more than 2,000
outlets, slid 2.4 percent to 347.8 pence. The stock was cut to
reduce from hold at Numis Securities Ltd.  SBM Offshore NV (SBMO) , the largest maker of floating oil and gas
platforms, dropped 4.2 percent to 10.52 euros. KBC Groep NV cut
the price target for the stock to 15 euros from 17 euros.  To contact the reporter on this story:
