The  New York Knicks  made forward
Amar’e Stoudemire “available for free” to almost every other
National Basketball Association team in an unsuccessful attempt
to trade him before the season, the New York Times reported.  The Knicks tried to move Stoudemire because his skills
don’t mesh with those of Carmelo Anthony, the Times said.  The attempt to deal the 30-year-old six-time All-Star
didn’t work because of his contract, which has three years and
$65 million left, the newspaper said citing an NBA team
executive it didn’t identify.  Stoudemire hasn’t played this season as he recovers from a
knee injury. He may return next week for the Knicks (19-6), who
lead the Atlantic Division by six games.  To contact the reporter on this story:
