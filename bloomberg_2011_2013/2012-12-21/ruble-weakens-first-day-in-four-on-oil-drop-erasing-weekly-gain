The ruble weakened against the
dollar for the first time in four days after a slump in crude
oil,  Russia ’s biggest revenue earner.  The ruble dropped 0.3 percent against the dollar to 30.7585
by 6:12 p.m. in Moscow. The currency was little changed versus
the central bank’s target euro-dollar basket at 35.1918 and was
steady against the euro to 40.6002. The decline pared this
year’s 4.7 percent advance against the dollar and 2.6 percent
gain to the euro, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Crude slid 1.2 percent to $89.06 a barrel in New York, the
first decline in six days. U.S. House Republican leaders
canceled a vote on Speaker John Boehner’s budget plan and the
chamber said no more votes will be held until after the
Christmas holiday.  Non-deliverable forwards showed the ruble at 31.2350 per
dollar in three months compared with 31.1425 yesterday.  The extra yield investors demand to own Russia’s dollar
bonds over U.S. Treasuries rose five basis points to 160,
according to JPMorgan Chase & Co.’s EMBI Global Index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
