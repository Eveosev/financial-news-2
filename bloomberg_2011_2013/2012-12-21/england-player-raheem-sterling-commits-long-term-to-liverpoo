Raheem Sterling has committed “his
long-term future,” to Liverpool, the 18-time English champion
said today, without saying by how many years.  Sterling, 18, in November became the club’s youngest ever
international player when he made his England debut against
Sweden. He joined Liverpool in 2010 and has made 25 appearances
for the first team this season.  “Since the summer, Luis Suarez,  Daniel Agger , Martin
Skrtel, Jonjo Shelvey and Suso have all signed new long-term
contracts and it’s a clear indication of our intent to keep the
players we believe are crucial to bringing success on the
pitch,” Liverpool managing director  Ian Ayre  said in a
statement on the club website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
