Russia’s  Grain Producers’ Union 
urged the government to help farmers who are struggling to repay
bank loans ahead of spring grains sowing.  The union proposed a moratorium on debt collection by
creditors from farms, amendments to bankruptcy procedures and
deferral of loans and interest rate payments.  The objective isn’t to forgive debts owed by farmers, “but
to give them the possibility to come out of this situation,”
Pavel Skurikhin, the union’s president, said in an e-mailed
statement today. “A new effective owner doesn’t always appear
to replace the bankrupted farm, which is a direct threat to
grain production and the country’s food safety.”  The debt burden on Russian agriculture was 1.6 trillion
rubles ($52 billion) in 2011, with most extended loan
obligations due in 2012 and 2013, according to Agriculture
Ministry  data .  To contact the reporter on this story:
