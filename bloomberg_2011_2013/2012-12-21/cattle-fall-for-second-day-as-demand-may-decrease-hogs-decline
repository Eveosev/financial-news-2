Cattle futures fell for a second day
on speculation that demand will ebb for slaughter-ready animals
as U.S. consumers reduce beef purchases. Hogs dropped.  Meatpacking plants will probably slow purchases of cattle
because they will be shut for the Christmas holiday on Dec. 25.
Wholesale  beef  has dropped for three straight days, reaching
$1.9206 a pound yesterday, the lowest since Nov. 9, government
data show. Shoppers may be choosing cheaper alternatives after
the cost of the meat climbed 8 percent since the end of July.  “Packers aren’t going to need to kill cattle, and they
don’t need to own a lot of cattle because of the holidays,”
 Lane Broadbent , a vice president at KIS Futures in  Oklahoma
City , said by telephone. With such high beef prices, “there’s a
shock factor there, especially when you go to the meat
counter,” he said.  Cattle futures for February delivery slid 0.3 percent to
$1.3305 a pound at 9:53 a.m. on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
Prices, which touched a record $1.345 on Dec. 19, were up 9.9
percent this year through yesterday as the U.S. herd shrunk.  Feeder-cattle futures for March settlement dropped 0.2
percent to $1.546 a pound on the CME.  Hog futures for February settlement fell 0.2 percent to
86.3 cents a pound in Chicago.  To contact the reporter on this story:
