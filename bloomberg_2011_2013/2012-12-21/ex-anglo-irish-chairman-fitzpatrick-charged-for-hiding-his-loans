Former Anglo Irish Bank Corp.
Chairman  Sean Fitzpatrick  was charged with hiding personal loans
of as much as 139.8 million euros ($184.5 million) from the
auditors of the now-nationalized bank.  Fitzpatrick, 64, appeared in court in Dublin today after
being charged with breaches of Irish company law for providing
“misleading, false or deceptive” declarations to auditors
Ernst & Young between 2002 and 2007 that failed to give the true
amount of his borrowings, according to court documents filed by
prosecutors today. Under his authorization, the private loans
“would appear temporarily to be reduced at year-end.”  Fitzpatrick and two other one-time Anglo Irish directors
were ordered on Oct. 8 to stand trial in relation to loans to 16
clients to buy shares in the bank in 2008. The former banker
resigned in December that year after saying he failed to
disclose some loans from the bank.  Fitzpatrick said at the time that while the transactions
“were inappropriate and unacceptable from a transparency point
of view,” they did not breach banking or legal regulations.  Fitzpatrick was remanded on bail until March 1, when the so-
called book of evidence will be presented to the court. His
solicitor Michael Staines didn’t immediately return calls to his
office seeking comment on the charges.  Anglo Irish bankrolled many of the developers who helped
fuel the real estate bubble that collapsed in 2008. The state
took over the bank in 2009, and sought an international bailout
a year later to help meet the 29.3 billion-euro cost of averting
its collapse.  To contact the reporter on this story:
