Brazil ’s  unemployment  rate dropped
to its second-lowest level since the series began in 2002,
creating additional inflationary pressure in the world’s second-
biggest emerging economy.  Unemployment fell to 4.9 percent from 5.3 percent in
October, the national statistics agency said in  Rio de Janeiro 
today. The decline was steeper than predicted by all but two of
33 economists surveyed by Bloomberg, whose median  estimate  was
for unemployment to fall to 5.1 percent.  As  Latin America ’s largest economy heads for its  second-
worst  performance in 13 years, unemployment has remained near
historic  lows  throughout 2012, pressuring inflation that has run
above the central bank’s 4.5 percent target since 2010. Since
August 2011, the central bank has cut its benchmark  rate  by more
than any other Group of 20 nation to a record low 7.25 percent,
and President Dilma Rousseff’s government has eliminated payroll
taxes for dozens of industries and leaned on banks to lower
lending rates.  “Low unemployment will keep service inflation pressured
over the coming months and so overall inflation as well,” said
 Luciano Rostagno , chief strategist at Banco WestLB do Brasil SA.
“The inflation scenario is not very good for Brazil.”  Swap rates on the contract maturing in January 2014, the
most traded in  Sao Paulo  today, rose 4 basis points, or 0.04
percentage point, to 7.18 percent at 10:30 a.m. local time. The
real weakened 0.2 percent to 2.0726 per  U.S. dollar .  Consumer Prices  Consumer prices in mid-December posted the biggest monthly
jump since May 2011, as measured by the IPCA-15  index . Annual
inflation accelerated to 5.78 percent.  The central bank last month kept the overnight rate
unchanged after cutting borrowing costs by 5.25 percentage
points since August 2011 as it predicts a “non-linear”
convergence of inflation to its 4.5 percent target. The bank
said it would keep rates at their all-time low for a
“prolonged” period to stimulate growth.  Lower unemployment will add additional steam to 2013
inflation that will likewise face pressure from the expiration
of tax breaks, higher gasoline prices, and a moderate recovery
in the global economy, Rostagno said.  Unemployment will drop to 4.1 percent in the fourth quarter
of 2013, with inflation reaching 6.7 percent, according to  BNP
Paribas SA (BNP) ’s Global Outlook report released last month.  Job Creation  As unemployment has remained steady,  creation  of jobs has
slowed. Brazil generated 1.37 million new jobs in the first 11
months of 2012, down 30.8 percent from last year and the least
since the series began in 2003.  Average real income rose 0.8 percent in November and
reached 1,810 reais ($873), its highest level since the series
began in 2002, the statistics institute said. Near full
employment, combined with rising wages, indicate that new jobs
are unlikely to be created quickly in 2013,  Pedro Tuesta , senior
Latin America economist at 4Cast Inc., said by telephone.  “Wages have been increasing, productivity has been coming
down, so there is space to grow without hiring,” Tuesta, one of
two economists who correctly forecast today’s unemployment
figure, said from  New York  on Dec. 20.  Productivity  “The labor market looks like it will remain resilient
unless we get a fresh economic shock,”  Neil Shearing , chief
 emerging markets  economist at Capital Economics Ltd., said by
telephone from  London . “The flip side is that productivity will
need to be raised if we’re going to get decent economic growth
over the next three to five years.”  While third quarter growth was 0.6 percent,  half  the level
forecast by economists and government officials, it was still
the highest since the first quarter of 2011, and there are other
signs the economy is regaining its footing. Industrial
production  rose  in October from the year before for the first
time since August 2011.  All 1,500 workers at Daimler AG’s Mercedes-Benz bus and
truck plant who were granted furloughs in June due to slackening
demand will return to work in January, the ABC metalworkers’
union said in a statement this week. The factory’s second shift
will be reactivated in February due to a 15 percent increase in
production.  Brazil’s gross domestic product will expand 1 percent this
year, and growth will quicken next year to 3.4 percent,
according to the latest central bank survey of economists.  To contact the reporter on this story:
