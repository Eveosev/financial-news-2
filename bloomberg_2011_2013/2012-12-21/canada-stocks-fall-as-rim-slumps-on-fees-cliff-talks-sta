Canadian  stocks  fell for a second
day as  Research In Motion Ltd. (RIM)  plunged after the company decided
to scrap service fees for some users, offsetting gains in gold
producers.  RIM, which is set to release its BlackBerry 10 line of
smartphones early next year, tumbled 27 percent for the biggest
drop since 2008. Yamana Gold Inc. and Iamgold Corp. rose at
least 2 percent as the price of the metal snapped three days of
losses.  Stantec (STN)  Inc., an engineering and architectural services
firm, declined 2.9 percent after Raymond James Financial Inc.
downgraded the stock.  The  Standard & Poor’s /TSX Composite Index fell 3.01 points,
or less than 0.1 percent, to 12,385.70 in Toronto. The equity
gauge is up 3.6 percent this year, underperforming every
developed market in the world except for  Spain . Trading volume
was 74 percent higher than the 30-day average.  “Gold had been weak because fiscal cliff discussions were
progressing,” said Patrick Blais, a  fund manager  with Manulife
Asset Management Ltd. in Toronto. His firm manages about $218
billion. “Now with talks breaking down, it’s not surprising to
see gold rebound, given the flight to safety.”  U.S. House Speaker John Boehner yesterday scrapped a vote
on his tax plan, which would have allowed higher rates on annual
income above $1 million. He said last night that President
 Barack Obama  and Senate Majority Leader  Harry Reid  should come
up with legislation to avoid more than $600 billion in tax-and-
spending changes.  Fiscal Cliff  Now that Boehner has pulled his plan, House members and
senators won’t vote on the end-of-year budget issues until after
Christmas, giving them less than a week to reach an agreement.  Yamana added 3.1 percent to C$16.89 and Iamgold rose 2
percent to C$11.10. Gold for February delivery advanced 0.9
percent to settle at $1,660.10 an ounce in  New York .  The S&P/TSX Gold  subindex  rallied 0.8 percent as 18 of 32
members advanced.  RIM slumped 27 percent to C$10.86, its biggest decline
since September 2008. Users who do not want enhanced services,
including advanced security, are expected to generate “less or
no service revenue,” Chief Executive Officer Thorsten Heins
said on a conference call yesterday. Service fees accounted for
about $982 million in sales last quarter, out of a total of
$2.73 billion.  The company posted earnings excluding some items of 22
cents a share, beating the 35-cent loss predicted by analysts.  Stantec, Cogeco  Stantec dropped 2.9 percent to C$39.79. Ben Cherniavsky, an
analyst with  Raymond James , lowered his rating for the company
to market perform from outperform after the stock rose to its
highest level since 1994 yesterday. The shares have risen 44
percent this year.  “We remain big believers in Stantec’s long-term prospects
but see a less attractive near-term risk/return profile on the
stock,” he said in a note to clients today.  Cogeco Cable Inc., a Montreal-based cable television
operator, dropped 5.4 percent to C$38.78. The company said it
will acquire Peer 1 Network Enterprises Inc. for C$3.85 a share,
a 31 percent premium to yesterday’s close. Standard & Poor’s has
put Cogeco Cable’s rating on creditwatch with negative
implications due to the level of debt in the deal. Peer 1 jumped
30 percent to $3.83.  To contact the reporter on this story:
