Spanish soccer club Malaga, which is
owned by Qatar’s  Sheikh Abdullah  Bin Nasser Al Thani, was
barred from next season’s Champions League for breaking so-
called financial fair-play rules.  European soccer’s ruling body, UEFA, said on its  website 
that the club must also pay a 300,000 euro ($395,000) fine and
may get a further ban if it doesn’t prove by March 31 that it
has no overdue payments to clubs, employees or tax authorities.  UEFA, based in Nyon,  Switzerland , is seeking to bring clubs
in line with financial controls that aim to reduce debt and
prevent them from spending above their means.  Malaga, which is fourth in Spain’s La Liga and was
yesterday drawn to play Porto in the round of 16 in this
season’s  Champions League , said in a statement that the
sanctions were “completely disproportionate” to its situation
and it would contest them aggressively.  “The club believes it is being made a scapegoat and an
example of by UEFA with this unfair treatment,” according to
the Malaga statement.  The club said it has reached agreements with players and
tax authorities over its obligations, and Sheikh Abdullah has
made a “recent” investment of 7 million euros in the team.  To contact the reporter on this story:
