Saudi Arabian Oil Minister Ali al- Naimi said demand for crude matches supply and the global market
is stable.  “The market is functioning well,” Naimi told reporters in
Cairo before a meeting tomorrow of the  Organization of Arab
Petroleum Exporting Countries . “Supply is adequate. Demand
matches supply. If there is extra supply it is helping
inventories.”  Oil in  New York  fell for the first time in six days on
concern U.S. lawmakers will fail to reach a deal to avert a
fiscal crisis, threatening the economy of the world’s biggest
crude consumer.  Oil futures for February delivery fell as much as $2.17, or
2.4 percent, to $87.96 a barrel today on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange . The contract traded at $88.60 a barrel at 2:02 p.m.
local time.  “There are customers who will come to every producer and
ask for volume,” Naimi said when asked whether the world’s
largest exporter would return to an individual quota. “Saudi
will honor the requests of its customers.”  The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries decided
Dec. 12 to keep its production target unchanged for a second
time this year.  Saudi Arabia  is the biggest crude-producer in
OPEC. The 12-member group will meet next on May 31.  To contact the reporter on this story:
