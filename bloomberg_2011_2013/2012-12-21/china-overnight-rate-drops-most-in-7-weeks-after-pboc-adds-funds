China ’s overnight money-market rate
dropped the most in seven weeks on speculation the central bank
will step up cash injections into the financial system to help
lenders meet year-end capital requirements.  The People’s Bank of China  pumped in  a net 92 billion  yuan 
($14.8 billion) in the past week via reverse-repurchase
operations, after withdrawing 125 billion yuan in the preceding
period, data compiled by Bloomberg show. It offered 60 billion
yuan of seven-day reverse-repo agreements and 33 billion yuan of
14-day contracts yesterday.  “We aren’t as nervous as in previous year-ends,” said
Wang Huane, a senior bond trader at Qilu Bank Co. in Jinan,
capital of the eastern Shandong province. “If there is a
shortage of cash, we can ask the PBOC for reverse repos.”  The one-day  repurchase rate , which measures interbank
funding availability, dropped 24 basis points to 2.42 percent as
of 10:25 a.m. in Shanghai, the biggest drop since Nov. 2,
according to a weighted average rate compiled by the National
Interbank Funding Center. It rose 15 basis points this week.  The one-year swap contract, the fixed cost needed to
receive the floating seven-day repurchase rate, climbed one
basis point to 3.36 percent, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. It was unchanged from a week ago.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
