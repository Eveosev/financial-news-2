Pilots at AS Estonian Air, Estonia’s
national carrier, plan to strike next month as talks with
employers over a new collective agreement remain deadlocked.  The strike is scheduled to start Jan. 7 and should last
until an agreement is reached, the Estonian Airline Pilots’
Association said in an e-mailed statement today. The association
demands keeping the same terms as in the previous agreement
signed in May 2008.  Estonian Air on Aug. 9 said it was terminating the
collective agreement as of Feb. 9, 2013, the association said.
The expiration of the accord will lead to “deficient”
regulation of pilots’ work and rest hours and to a loss of
social guarantees, it added.  To contact the reporter on this story:
