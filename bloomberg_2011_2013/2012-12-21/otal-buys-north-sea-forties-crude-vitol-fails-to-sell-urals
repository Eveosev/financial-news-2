Total SA bought a cargo of  North Sea 
Forties crude for less than a deal yesterday. Vitol Group failed
to sell two lots of Russian Urals grade.  PT Pertamina,  Indonesia ’s state-owned oil company, is
seeking to buy low-sulfur crude for delivery during March to its
Balikpapan and Cilacap refineries, according to a document
obtained by  Bloomberg News .  North Sea  Vitol Group sold Forties lot F0104 at 25 cents a barrel
more than Dated Brent to Total, a Bloomberg survey of traders
and brokers monitoring the Platts pricing window showed. That
compares with deal at a 60 cent premium in the previous session.  Reported crude trading typically occurs during the Platts
window, which ends at 4:30 p.m.  London  time. Before the session,
Forties loading in 10 to 25 days fell 17 cents to 58 cents more
than Dated Brent, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Brent for February settlement traded at $108.77 a barrel on
the ICE Futures  Europe  exchange in London at the close of the
window, compared with $109.81 in the previous session. The March
contract was at $107.95, a discount of 82 cents to February.  Platts said it will leave the discount for Forties cargoes
with a high sulfur content unchanged for next month.  Sellers will pay 35 cents a barrel for every 0.1 percentage
point of sulfur over that limit in January, unchanged for a
fourth month, the company said today in an e-mailed statement.  Mediterranean/Urals  Vitol offered 140,000 metric tons of Mediterranean Urals
crude at a 95 cent discount to Dated Brent on a delivered basis
to Augusta,  Italy , according to the Platts survey.  The company also failed to sell 100,000 tons of the grade
at 50 cents less than Dated Brent on a delivered basis to
Rotterdam, the survey showed.  The Urals differential to Dated Brent in the Mediterranean
narrowed 5 cents to minus 25 cents, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg. In northwest Europe, the  discount  to Dated Brent
decreased 26 cents to 77 cents, the data showed.  OAO Surgutneftegas,  Russia ’s fourth-largest oil producer,
issued a tender to sell two cargoes of Urals crude for loading
next month from two Baltic Sea ports, according to two people
with knowledge of the tender.  The company is offering one shipment each from Primorsk and
Ust-Luga, both for loading Jan. 13 to Jan. 14, according to the
people, who asked not to be identified because the information
is not public. Each consignment is of 100,000 tons.  West Africa  Qua Iboe blend dropped 7 cents to $2.61 a barrel more than
Dated Brent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Pertamina is seeking oil for delivery to Cilacap from March
1 to March 5 and to Balikpapan from March 7 to March 12, the
document showed. The tender closes at 11 a.m Singapore time on
Dec. 27 and bids must be valid until 6 p.m. the next day.  The company bought 950,000 barrels each of  Nigeria ’s Qua
Iboe and  Libya ’s Amna crude as well as 650,000 barrels of Azeri
Light oil for March delivery in an earlier tender, a company
official, who asked not to be named because he isn’t authorized
to speak to the media, said today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
