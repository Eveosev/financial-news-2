An anti-graft official in the
southern Chinese city of Guangzhou called on government and
Communist Party officials to be faithful to their spouses after
a slew of local scandals, the  China Daily  reported today.  Mei Heqing, a standing member of the communist party’s
Guangzhou disciplinary commission, also disclosed at a briefing
yesterday that 38 of the 61 county-level or higher officials
investigated this year in the city kept mistresses or had more
than one sexual partner, the newspaper reported.  China ’s new Communist Party leaders pledged this month to
abandon extravagance, reduce lavish receptions and live more
frugally, amid a broader push to stamp out corruption. Former
Politburo member  Bo Xilai , who was expelled from the party in
September for taking bribes and his wife’s murder of a British
national, was also accused of having had improper sexual
relations with numerous women.  In a more recent case, Lei Zhengfu, party secretary of the
Beibei district in the municipality of Chongqing, was removed
from his post last month after he was identified in a sex video
that was circulated on the Internet, the official Xinhua News
Agency reported Nov. 23.  In Guangzhou, He Jing, deputy head of the city’s public
security bureau, was accused of having had affairs with several
women along with taking bribes, Xinhua reported in September.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
