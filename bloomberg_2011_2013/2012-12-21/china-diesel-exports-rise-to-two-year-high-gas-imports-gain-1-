China ’s diesel exports rose to the
highest level in more than two years in November and pipeline
natural gas imports increased to a record, while purchases of
liquefied natural gas declined.  Net diesel exports, or overseas sales minus imports,
increased to 241,417 metric tons, the most since October 2010,
according to data e-mailed by the General Administration of
Customs today. Gas bought via pipeline from  Turkmenistan  jumped
62 percent from a year earlier to 1.61 million tons as inbound
cargoes of LNG slid 16 percent to 1.08 million.  Oil refiners in China, the world’s second-biggest crude
consumer, are expanding so fast that they may boost fuel exports
to find new buyers, the  International Energy Agency  said in its
Medium-Term Oil Market Report on Oct. 12. The nation last month
processed more than 10 million barrels a day of the commodity
for the first time. China is also on track to import more gas by
pipeline than by sea as buyers seek cheaper supplies.  Diesel exports last month were 301,600 tons, also the
highest since October 2010, while imports fell 70 percent from a
year earlier to 60,183 tons, today’s data show. Gasoline exports
rose to 332,399 tons, the most since March.  Fuel oil imports fell for a second month to 2.09 million
tons, compared with 2.1 million tons in October and 2.06 million
a year earlier. Purchases of the residue, used as a ship fuel
and refinery feedstock, were little changed at 24.22 million
tons in the first eleven months from a year earlier.  Gas Imports  China increased supplies of natural gas to meet winter
demand from heating. The National Development and Reform
Commission, the top economic planner, on Dec. 18 urged local
governments to ensure availability of the fuel in winter and
spring.  The country, which accounted for almost a quarter of Asia’s
gas use last year, increased imports via pipeline by 52 percent
to 14.3 million tons in the first 11 months of the year,
government data show. LNG purchases from nations including
Australia and Qatar advanced 20 percent to 12.9 million tons and
cost about 4 percent more than piped supplies, even before the
cost of regasification.  Coal imports, including lignite, climbed 6.5 percent in
November from a year earlier to a record 28.98 million tons, the
customs data showed today. The figure was reported Dec. 18 by
the China Coal Transport & Distribution Association.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
