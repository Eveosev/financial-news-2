Sinohydro Group Ltd. (601669) , China’s
biggest hydroelectric dam builder, said its board of directors
approved plans to invest a total of 1.36 billion  yuan  ($218
million) to develop solar and wind farm projects.  The company plans to spend about 443 million yuan to build
a 40-megawatt solar farm in Dunhuang in China’s northwestern
province of Gansu, Sinohydro said today in a  statement.  The rest
will be used to develop two wind farms.  Beijing-based Sinohydro may invest an additional 1.2
billion yuan to set up a finance unit to strengthen capital
management and broaden financing channels, it said in a separate
statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
