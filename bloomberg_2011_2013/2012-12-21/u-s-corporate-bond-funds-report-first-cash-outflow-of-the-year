Investors yanked money from U.S.
 investment-grade bond  funds for the first week this year as
concern mounts that a four-year rally is losing steam.  The funds reported $860 million of withdrawals in the
period after 62 consecutive weeks of deposits, the first outflow
since October 2011, according to Bank of America Corp.
strategists in a report yesterday. Investors have funneled $165
billion into the funds this year, the report said.  Investors are demonstrating waning enthusiasm for debt
that’s had annualized return of 11.7 percent since 2008 and
that’s now at about the greatest risk of losing value if
 interest rates  rise in 19 years. Dollar-denominated investment-
grade bonds are losing value for a second consecutive month
after yields on the notes dropped to an unprecedented 2.73
percent on Nov. 8, Bank of America Merrill Lynch index data
show.  “We expect USD investment-grade credit to struggle to
break even in 2013 on a total-return basis,” Richard Salditt, a
Deutsche Bank AG credit strategist in New York, wrote in a Dec.
14 report.  The notes have declined 0.45 percent this month after
losing 0.08 percent in November, Bank of America Merrill Lynch
index data show. Average modified duration, a measure of the
securities’ price sensitivity to yield changes, climbed to 6.87
years on Oct. 29, the highest since 1993 and up from a low of
5.39 years in October 2008, according to the data.  To contact the reporter on this story:
