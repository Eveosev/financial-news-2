Steel reinforcement-bar advanced for
the first time in three days after a report that Jiangsu Shagang
Co.,  China ’s fifth-biggest producer, raised metal prices.  Rebar for delivery in May rose 0.1 percent to 3,793  yuan 
($609) a metric ton on the Shanghai Futures Exchange, posting a
third weekly gain. Futures have lost 10 percent this year as
China’s growth cooled and state curbs on real estate cut demand
for the material used in construction.  Shagang raised rebar prices by 50 yuan a ton, steel wire
and rods by 100 yuan and coiled rebar by 100 yuan a ton each
from today, Custeel.com, a researcher jointly owned by 16 large
Chinese steel companies, reported. Shagang produced 32 million
tons of steel in 2011, according to the researcher. Two calls to
Shen Wenminng, vice president of Shagang, were not answered.  “Shagang lifting prices helped push up futures because it
signals spot prices have solid support at current levels,”
Zhang Lei, an analyst at Nanhua Futures Co., said by phone from
Shenyang. “The support may come from the fact that iron ore
prices have risen, which raised input costs,” he said.  The  average spot price  for rebar fell 0.1 percent to 3,623
yuan a ton, according to Beijing Antaike Information Development
Co.  Spot iron ore  at Tianjin port was unchanged at $135.50 a dry
ton yesterday, after surging 17 percent this month, according
data from The Steel Index Ltd.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
