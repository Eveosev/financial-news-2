two months on optimism  China’s economy  is recovering from a
seven-quarter slowdown.  The  World Bank  said in a report this week the world’s
second-largest economy will grow 8.4 percent in 2013, faster
than an October projection of 8.1 percent.  China  will increase
the movement of the exchange rate “appropriately” to handle
the latest round of measures by global central banks to pump
money into markets to support growth, the official Xinhua News
Agency said in an editorial.  “We continue to factor in a slight  renminbi  appreciation
for the coming year,” said Ho Woei Chen, a Singapore-based
economist at United Overseas Bank Ltd. “Growth is expected to
pick up next year. The pace of appreciation will be modest.”  The  yuan  strengthened 0.24 percent this week, the most

currency rose 0.03 percent today.  The People’s Bank of China lowered the  reference rate  by

room for small, “sustained” appreciation in the long run,
Shanghai Securities News reported today, citing a report from
the government-run State Information Center.  Stock indexes fell around the world after House Republican
