Mike Lynch, the former chief
executive officer of Autonomy Corp. facing allegations that he
miscategorized sales before selling the company to  Hewlett-
Packard Co. (HPQ) , said he’s waiting for evidence from the company to
back up the accusations.  Lynch said he will be reviewing Hewlett-Packard’s annual
10-K regulatory filing that’s due to be filed with the U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission by Dec. 31, to see if it
sheds more light on why he’s been accused of wrongdoing.
Hewlett-Packard hasn’t explained its claims since publishing the
allegations on Nov. 20, Lynch said. Chief Executive Officer Meg Whitman is aiming to eke growth from Autonomy, which she and
fellow board members agreed to buy for $10.3 billion last year.  “We do not understand the allegations, or how they could
possibly add up to a writedown of over $5 billion,” Lynch said
in a letter posted to the  website  that he’s using to fight
Hewlett-Packard’s allegations.  Howard Clabo, a spokesman for Palo Alto, California-based
Hewlett-Packard, declined to comment.  Lynch is fighting allegations by Whitman that
misrepresentations by Autonomy caused Hewlett-Packard to value
the company incorrectly, leading to a $8.8 billion writedown. Of
that, $5 billion came from improperly booked sales, Hewlett-
Packard said. Hewlett-Packard has said that it turned over
evidence to regulators including the Securities and Exchange
Commission.  To contact the reporter on this story:
