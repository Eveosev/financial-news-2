The European Medicines Agency is
reviewing Merck & Co.’s Tredaptive after a key study showed the
cholesterol treatment to be ineffective and potentially harmful.  The Pharmacovigilance Risk Assessment Committee will review
the data and make a recommendation to the panel that oversees
human medicines, the London-based EMA said today in a  statement .
The panel will issue an opinion on the drug next month, the
agency said.  Tredaptive, also known as Pelzont and Trevaclyn, was
approved for sale in  Europe  in 2008. The therapy, sold in 70
countries but not in the U.S., combines the vitamin niacin and
the experimental medicine laropiprant, added to reduce a face-
flushing effect of the drug. Tredaptive was designed to raise
levels of HDL, or “good” cholesterol. The pill generated less
than $20 million in 2012 sales.  In the study of 25,673 patients, Tredaptive failed to cut
heart attacks, strokes, the need for artery-clearing procedures
or death from cardiovascular disease more than cholesterol-
lowering statin drugs. Patients given Tredaptive plus statin
drugs alone or with Zocor were more likely to develop serious,
though not life-threatening, side effects, the  Whitehouse
Station , New Jersey-based company said in a statement yesterday.  Merck said it won’t seek U.S. marketing approval. No one
should start taking Tredaptive, Merck said, though the company
stopped short of telling people not to use it.  To contact the reporter on this story:
