Chile ’s peso extended its weekly
decline to the steepest in a month after the price of copper,
the nation’s main export, fell on rising stockpiles.  The currency depreciated 0.6 percent today to 478.11 per
 U.S. dollar  at the close in Santiago, the weakest level since
Dec. 5, deepening its drop this week to 0.9 percent. The peso
rallied on Dec. 14 to 473.98, the strongest since Oct. 18.
Copper was headed for a 3.2 percent decline from a week earlier
to $3.5655 a pound.  “The depreciation in the week can be explained by
copper,” said Eugenio Cortes, the head of currency forwards at
EuroAmerica Corredores de Bolsa SA in Santiago.  Copper accounts for more than half of Chile’s exports.
Stockpiles monitored by the London Metal Exchange rose 15
percent this week to the highest since February.  To contact the reporter on this story:
