Centro Retail Australia (CRF) , the mall
owner formed last year from the restructure of Centro Properties
Group, led a 69 percent jump in retail property transactions in
2012, according to  Jones Lang LaSalle Inc. (JLL)   Shopping center sales jumped to A$5.8 billion ($6.1 billion)
in 2012, the second-highest year on record, the Chicago-based
broker said in an e-mailed statement. Centro’s sale of 50
percent stakes in three malls in Western Australia, Victoria and
 South Australia  states to Perron Group Ltd. in May accounted for
almost 12 percent of agency-negotiated sales, it said.  The “defensive characteristics of major shopping centers
are once again demonstrating their resilience,” Simon Rooney,
Sydney-based Australian head of retail investments at Jones Lang
LaSalle, said in the statement. “Jones Lang LaSalle have over
A$1.5 billion worth of shopping centers in due diligence that
will translate into transactions in the first quarter of 2013,
so we’re predicting another very strong year of investment
activity.”  Other major deals in 2012 included agreements by Blackstone
Group LP to acquire Top Ryde City in Sydney, which was in
receivership, for A$341 million in November, and the Industry
Superannuation Property Trust to purchase the Myer Centre in
Brisbane for A$366 million from  CFS Retail Property Trust (CFX)  in
March, Jones Lang LaSalle said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
