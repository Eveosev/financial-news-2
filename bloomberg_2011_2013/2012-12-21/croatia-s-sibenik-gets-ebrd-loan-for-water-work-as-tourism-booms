The Croatian town of Sibenik won a
10 million-euro ($13.2 million) loan from the European Bank for
Reconstruction and Development to upgrade its water system as
tourism grows.  The loan to water and wastewater company  Vodovod i odvodnja
doo  will help expand its sewage service and bring water supply
in line with European Union standards, the London-based EBRD
said in a  statement  on its website.  Sibenik, in central Dalmatia on the Adriatic coast, has
become a tourist destination in the past two decades, straining
water infrastructure, according to the statement.  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
