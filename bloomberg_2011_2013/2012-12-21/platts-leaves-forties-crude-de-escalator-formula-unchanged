Platts, whose Dated Brent crude
assessment is used to price more than half of the worldâ€™s oil,
said it will leave the discount for North Sea Forties cargoes
with a high sulfur content unchanged for January.  The unit of New York-based McGraw-Hill Cos. applies a so-
called de-escalator to compensate buyers of Forties crude that
contains more than 0.6 percent sulfur.  Sellers will pay 35 cents a barrel for every 0.1 percentage
point of sulfur over that limit in January, unchanged for a
fourth month, Platts said today in an e-mailed statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
