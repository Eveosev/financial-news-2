NYSE Euronext (NYX)  was sued by an
investor who claims the exchange is worth more than the
$8.2 billion that  IntercontinentalExchange Inc. (ICE)  bid for it.  NYSE Euronext directors failed in their duty to maximize
the value of the company’s stock,  shareholder  Samuel T. Cohen
said in a lawsuit filed yesterday in Delaware Chancery Court in
Wilmington.  Cohen asked the court to block the takeover under present
terms, contending the offer is being made “for inadequate
consideration and through a flawed process.”  IntercontinentalExchange, based in Atlanta, said yesterday
that it would pay $33.12 for each share of New York-based NYSE
Euronext. NYSE Euronext shareholders can choose cash, stock or a
combination of the two.  NYSE Euronext fell 20 cents to $32.05 at 11:24 a.m. in  New
York  Stock Exchange composite  trading . The stock rose 34 percent
with yesterday’s announcement.  Robert Rendine, a spokesman for NYSE Euronext, declined to
comment on the lawsuit.  The case is Cohen v. NYSE Euronext, CA8136, Delaware
Chancery Court (Wilmington).  To contact the reporter on this story:
