Polish electricity  for Saturday
advanced as unplanned outages reduced supply.  Power for tomorrow rose 4 percent from a week ago to 175.14
zloty ($56.55) a megawatt-hour, exchange data compiled by
Bloomberg show.  Tauron Polska Energia SA (TPE)  will halt a 460-megawatt unit at
its Lagisza plant tomorrow in an unplanned stoppage, while  PGE
SA (PGE)  will stop a 370-megawatt Belchatow unit for two days, the
utilities said.  Poland was set to halt exports to the Czech Republic,
 Germany  and Slovakia tomorrow, after shipping as much as 845
megawatts to those countries a week ago, data from the power
grid manager PSE Operator SA showed.  Day-ahead electricity on the coupled markets of the Czech
Republic and Slovakia slumped 17 percent to 32.46 euros ($42.78)
a megawatt-hour in a daily auction, according to the countriesâ€™
market operators. Hungarian day-ahead power jumped 39 percent to
54.41 euros a megawatt-hour.  To contact the reporter on this story:
