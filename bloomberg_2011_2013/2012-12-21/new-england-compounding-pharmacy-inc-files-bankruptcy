New England Compounding Pharmacy
Inc., the Massachusetts pharmaceutical company blamed for a
nationwide meningitis outbreak, filed for  bankruptcy protection 
to deal with lawsuits filed against it.  More than 30 people died and 490 were injured after the
company shipped fungus-tainted drugs to customers throughout the
U.S., according to the  Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention . The company plans to establish a fund under Chapter
11 of the U.S.  Bankruptcy Code  to compensate individuals and
families affected by the outbreak.  The Framingham-based company listed both assets and debt of
$1 million to $10 million in Chapter 11 documents filed
yesterday in  U.S. Bankruptcy Court  in Boston.  New England Compounding’s “goal is to provide a greater,
quicker, fairer payout to its creditors than they could achieve
through piecemeal litigation,” the company said yesterday in a
statement.  Under bankruptcy law, all litigation against a company or
individual who seeks protection is put on hold while the case is
pending. A judge can grant a request to allow the claims to
proceed outside  bankruptcy court  in some instances.  The case is In re New England Compounding Pharmacy Inc.,
12-19882, U.S. Bankruptcy Court, District of Massachusetts
(Boston).  To contact the reporter on this story:
