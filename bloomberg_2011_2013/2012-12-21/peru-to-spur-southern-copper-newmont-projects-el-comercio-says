Peru will help  Southern Copper Corp. (SCCO) 
and  Newmont Mining Corp. (NEM)  accelerate projects delayed by
community protests, El Comercio reported, citing Energy & Mines
Minister Jorge Merino.  The government will set up community consultation groups as
it assesses the environmental impact of Southern Copper’s Tia
Maria project next year, Merino told the Lima-based newspaper.  Newmont’s Conga project will receive a boost when it
completes water and irrigation projects late next year, El
Comercio reported the minister as saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
