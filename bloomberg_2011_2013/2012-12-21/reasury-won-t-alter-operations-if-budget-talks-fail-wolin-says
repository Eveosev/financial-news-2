The U.S. Treasury Department has
told its employees that they shouldn’t expect day-to-day
operations to be disrupted even if the government fails to reach
accord on a plan to avoid across-the board spending cuts.  Deputy Treasury Secretary Neal Wolin sent a message to
Treasury employees, including Internal Revenue Service workers,
telling them that the so-called sequestration would lead to no
immediate changes, such as furloughs. If the government is
forced to operate with reduced funding for an extended period,
furloughs or other actions might be considered, he said.  “If such action proves to be necessary, we would provide
affected employees the requisite advance notice,” Wolin said in
the e-mail. “We would also immediately cancel any scheduled
personnel actions should a deficit reduction agreement be
reached that restores our agency funding.”  The government moved closer to going over the so-called
fiscal cliff yesterday after House Speaker  John Boehner  scrapped
a plan to allow higher tax rates on annual income above $1
million. Boehner, an  Ohio Republican , had been negotiating with
President  Barack Obama  in an effort to avoid automatic spending
cuts and tax increases that would take effect after Dec. 31.  To contact the reporters on this story:
