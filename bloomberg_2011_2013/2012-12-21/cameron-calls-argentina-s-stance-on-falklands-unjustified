Prime Minister  David Cameron 
attacked Argentine President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner’s
stance on the Falkland Islands, saying it’s “a pity” her
government isn’t willing to seek better relations with Britain.  The two countries went to war in 1982 after Argentine
forces invaded the South Atlantic archipelago. Tensions have
heightened this year, with  Argentina  protesting the U.K.’s
deployment of a modern warship to the region. The Falkland
islanders will hold a referendum next year on their allegiance
to Britain, in an effort to show Argentina they’re happy with
the status quo.  “There is no justification for any country to try and deny
you the right to democracy and self-determination,” Cameron
said in a Christmas message to the islanders today that was
released by his office in  London . “Nor to make attempts to
isolate you, block your trade and undermine your legitimate
fisheries, hydrocarbons and tourism industries.”  Cameron said while he wants to work with Argentina on a
wide range of issues, he won’t “stand by” and allow Falkland
Islanders’ rights to be ignored.  A total of 255 British military personnel were killed while
649 Argentine lives were lost in the conflict over the islands,
which Argentina calls the Malvinas. Britain has since reinforced
its armed forces on the islands, which have a population of
about 2,500 people.  The U.K. announced today that Colin Roberts, a diplomat,
will become the new governor of the Falkland Islands, taking up
his post in 2014.  To contact the reporter on this story:
