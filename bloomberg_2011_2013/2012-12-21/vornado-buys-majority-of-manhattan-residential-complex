Vornado Realty Trust (VNO) , the No. 3 U.S
real estate investment trust by market value, purchased a 59
percent interest in Independence Plaza, a 1,328-unit residential
complex in lower Manhattan’s Tribeca neighborhood.  The deal values the property, which includes 54,500 square
feet (5,063 square meters) of retail space and 550 parking
spaces, at $844.8 million, Paramus, New Jersey-based Vornado
said today in a statement.  The company’s move to control Independence Plaza began last
year, when it acquired a 51 percent stake in the property’s
subordinated debt for $45 million and a warrant to buy 25
percent of its equity for $1 million, according to the
statement. Vornado exercised the warrant and acquired 34 percent
more from another partner for $160 million.  The property is encumbered by a $329.2 million mortgage,
the company said. Vornado and Stellar Management, the other
equity partner, plan to refinance the mortgage in the first
quarter of 2013, shrinking their cash investment.  Vornado, the largest U.S. REIT after  Simon Property Group
Inc. (SPG)  and  General Growth Properties Inc. (GGP) , said it will have a
$100 million fourth-quarter gain from the deal as a result of
exchanging debt for equity and exercising the warrant.  Located just south of Citigroup Inc.’s trading complex on
Greenwich Street,  Independence Plaza  has townhouses and three
39-story apartment towers.  To contact the reporter on this story:
