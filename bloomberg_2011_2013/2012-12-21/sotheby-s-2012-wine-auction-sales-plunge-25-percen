Sotheby’s (BID)  global wine auction sales
dropped 25 percent in 2012, reflecting a wider slump in the
worldwide market.  Sales reached $64.5 million the New York-based auction house
said today in a press release. The company had a low pre-sale 
estimate of $49.3 million and a $67.1 million high estimate.
The estimates do not include buyer’s premium of 22.5 percent.  Hong Kong  remained Sotheby’s largest wine auction market
this year, achieving sales of $27 million, or 42 percent of its
global total. Hong Kong sales fell 40 percent from $44.7 million
in 2011.  According to a Dec. 2011 press release, Sotheby’s achieved
wine auction sales of $85.5 million in 2011, down from $88.3
million a year earlier.  Acker Merrall & Condit, the world’s largest wine
auctioneer, yesterday reported global sales of $83.3 million,
down from $110.5 million in 2011.  (Frederik Balfour is a reporter-at-large for Muse, the arts
