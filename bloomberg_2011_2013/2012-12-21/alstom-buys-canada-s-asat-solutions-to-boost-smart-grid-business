Alstom SA (ALO) , the French maker of power
equipment, bought Alberta-based ASAT Solutions Inc. to expand
its smart-grid business for an undisclosed sum.  ASAT makes technology to gather information from
electricity substations, which convert voltage from high to low
or vice versa. The data is used by electricity utilities gaging
demand. The utilities can act on this information to improve
efficiency and power distribution.  Alstom is expanding its smart grid business as the
transmission needs of utilities which build wind farms and dams
increase, requiring more flexible systems to accommodate
intermittent power. The company, which makes trains and wind
turbines, agreed in September to work on smart-grid projects
with Japan’s  Toshiba Corp. (6502)   ASAT, based in Calgary, sells its products to North
American utilities as well as other national energy groups,
according to Alstom, based in Levallois-Perret near Paris.
Alstom declined to disclose financial details of the transaction
when contacted.  To contact the reporter on this story:
