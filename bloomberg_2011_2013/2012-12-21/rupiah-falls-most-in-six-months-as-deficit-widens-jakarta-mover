Indonesia ’s rupiah dropped by the
most in six months as concern about a widening current-account
deficit prompts investors to pull funds from the nation’s assets.  The currency touched the weakest level since September 2009
after overseas funds sold 2.15 trillion rupiah ($222 million)
more local-currency government debt that they bought in the
three days through Dec. 19, poised for the biggest weekly
outflow since August, finance ministry data show. The  current-
account gap  may widen to 2.3 percent of gross domestic product
this quarter, the most since Bloomberg began compiling the data
in 1997, the central bank said on Dec. 11.  “We expect the rupiah to remain an underperformer in the
region,” said  Prakriti Sofat , a regional economist at Barclays
Plc in  Singapore . “The overall balance-of-payments position
remains weak, which continues to weigh on the rupiah.”  The rupiah dropped 1.4 percent to 9,785 per dollar as of
9:41 a.m. in Jakarta, the biggest drop since June 7, according
to prices from local banks compiled by Bloomberg. That was the
weakest level since Sept. 16, 2009. It lost 7.3 percent this
year, the worst performance among Asia’s 10 most-traded
currencies excluding the Japanese yen. The rupiah will weaken to
9,900 in 12 months, Sofat predicted.  Indonesia recorded a current-account deficit of 2.14
percent of GDP for the three months through September, its third
quarterly shortfall in a row, central bank data show. Foreign
funds have sold $36 million more local stocks than they bought
this month, exchange data show.  One-month implied volatility in the rupiah, a measure of
expected moves in exchange rates used to price options, was
steady at 5.7 percent today and this week, compared with 13.2
percent at the end of 2011.  Government bonds advanced for a fifth day. The yield on the
7 percent bonds due in May 2022 fell nine basis points, or 0.09
percentage point, this week to 5.16 percent, prices from the
Inter Dealer Market Association show. The yield fell one basis
point today to the lowest level since Feb. 15.  To contact the reporter on this story:
