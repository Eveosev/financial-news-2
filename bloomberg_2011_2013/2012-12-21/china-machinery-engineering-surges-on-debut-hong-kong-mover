China Machinery Engineering Corp. (1829) , a
state-controlled contractor with projects in countries including
Nigeria, Serbia and Ivory Coast, surged as much as 19 percent on
its  Hong Kong  debut after a HK$3.9 billion ($500 million) share
sale.  The company rose to HK$6.27 as of 11:15 a.m., 16 percent
more than its offer price of HK$5.40. The stock earlier climbed
to as high as HK$6.40. Hong Kong’s benchmark Hang Seng Index
dropped 0.8 percent.  The initial share sale was the third-biggest in Hong Kong
in the past 12 months, behind offerings by  People’s Insurance Co.
Group of China Ltd.  and Sunshine Oilsands Ltd., according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. China Machinery, which  said  it will
use most of the proceeds to finance overseas projects, is
expanding abroad as the country seeks closer ties with
developing nations and greater access to raw materials.  China Machinery sold 718 million shares in the offering,
including $50 million investments from PICC and CSR Corp.  The Beijing-based unit of China National Machinery Industry
Corp. offers engineering services and sells equipment and
machinery in more than 150 countries and regions, primarily in
 Asia , Europe and  Africa , according to its prospectus.  To contact the reporter on this story:
