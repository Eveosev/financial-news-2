struggle by U.S. lawmakers to reach a budget deal strengthened
the dollar, countering purchases by central banks and investors.

and was at $1,644.25 by 2:07 p.m. in Singapore. It declined to

showed the  U.S. economy  grew at a 3.1 percent annual rate last
quarter, exceeding all projections in a Bloomberg survey.
Bullion is 3.1 percent lower this week, the most since the
period to June 22, set for a fourth weekly drop.  GRAINS, OILSEEDS, SOFT COMMODITIES  Soybeans rebounded from a one-month low on speculation that
the 5.8 percent slump in the past four days will lure importers

returns to  Brazil .  The contract for March delivery gained as much as 1.4
percent to $14.245 a bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade, and

government.  Rubber for delivery in May rose 0.6 percent to end at 284.5
yen a kilogram ($3,389 a metric ton) on the Tokyo Commodity
Exchange, extending this week’s rally to 2.9 percent. A weaker

boosting prospects for cooking oil demand.  The contract for March delivery climbed as much as 3.1
percent to 2,392 ringgit ($781) a metric ton on the Malaysia
