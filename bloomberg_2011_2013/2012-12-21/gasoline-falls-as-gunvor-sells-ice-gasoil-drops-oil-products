European gasoline declined as Gunvor
Group Ltd. sold on the barge market and  Brent crude  fell.  Gasoil dropped on the ICE Futures Europe exchange in
London. Front-month futures traded at more than later-dated
contracts, keeping the market in backwardation for a second day.  Light Products  Gasoline in the Amsterdam-Rotterdam-Antwerp area traded
from $948 to $956 a metric ton, according to a Bloomberg survey
monitoring the Argus Bulletin Board. That compares with deals at
$955 to $960 yesterday.  Gunvor, Chevron Corp., BP Plc, Total SA and Hess Corp.’s
Hetco sold the Eurobob grade, to which ethanol is added to make
finished fuel. Trafigura Beheer BV, OAO Lukoil’s Litasco unit,
Vitol Group, Royal Dutch Shell Plc and Cargill Inc. bought
barges, which usually trade in lots of 1,000 and 2,000 tons.  Middle Distillates  Gasoil for January delivery fell $1.25, or 0.1 percent, to
$940 a ton as of 1:24 p.m.  London  time. The February contract
was at a $1 discount to the front month, after closing yesterday
in backwardation, a structure that signals near-term scarcity of
supply or rising demand.  The market had traded in contango, where near-term supplies
are cheaper than later-dated deliveries, for most of the
previous 28 days.  Gasoil’s crack , or premium to Brent, fell to $16.37 a
barrel versus $16.44 as of 4:30 p.m. yesterday. Brent fell 48
cents to $109.72 a barrel on the ICE exchange.  To contact the reporters on this story:
