The U.K. Treasury said it has closed
a loophole in the corporation-tax system that allows companies
to deduct certain types of expenses from profit.  A scheme, notified to Her Majesty’s Revenue & Customs this
week, allows companies to record artificial losses that can be
used to reduce their corporation-tax bill, the Treasury said.
It will be closed with immediate effect. Further details of how
the loophole operates were withheld to prevent tax advisers
modifying it to continue exploiting the rules.  The government “will not put up with tax avoidance which
uses artificial structures to aggressively exploit rules,”
Treasury ministery David Gauke said in an e-mailed statement.
“Within days of HMRC being notified of the existence of this
scheme we took decisive steps to shut it down once and for
all.”  Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne has said
he will devote more money to tackling tax avoidance as  Starbucks
Corp. (SBUX)  bowed to pressure from Parliament and said it will
consider paying more tax in Britain. A 77 million-pound ($125
million) effort to improve HMRC’s technology and recruit more
staff may yield an extra 2 billion pounds in unpaid tax from
companies such as Starbucks, the world’s largest coffee-shop
operator, Osborne said.  The Treasury is responding to a backlash that followed a
Nov. 13 parliamentary hearing with executives from Starbucks,
 Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN)  and  Google Inc. (GOOG) , who were criticized for using
complex accounting methods to reduce their tax liabilities in
the U.K.  To contact the reporter on this story:
