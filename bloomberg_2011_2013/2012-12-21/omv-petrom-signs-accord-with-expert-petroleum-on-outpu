OMV Petrom SA (SNP) ,  Romania ’s biggest oil
company, signed an agreement with Expert Petroleum SRL for
services to increase production at 13 oil and gas deposits.  These deposits, which now represent about 1.5 percent of
Petrom’s daily output, are located near the western Romanian
city of Timisoara, the company said in an e-mailed statement
today. According to the 15-year contract, Expert will take over
and finance operations to increase production, Petrom said.  Petrom will remain the only holder of the concession
licenses for the deposits, according to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
