John Malone , the billionaire
chairman of  Liberty Interactive Corp. (LINTA) , rejoined the board of
online travel company  Expedia Inc. (EXPE)  less than a month after
resigning as a director.  Malone was elected to replace William Fitzgerald, who
resigned, according to a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission
filing. Liberty, which is an Expedia shareholder, has the right
to nominate two directors to the board based on an agreement
signed a year ago.  Malone previously served as an Expedia board member from
August 2005 until Nov. 29, 2012. The following day, Expedia
released a filing, saying that Pamela Coe, a Liberty executive,
was replacing Malone as a director after his resignation.
Earlier this month, Liberty bought about $300 million of stock
in  TripAdvisor Inc. (TRIP) , gaining voting control of the travel review
site that was spun out of Expedia.  Expedia  fell  2.2 percent to $59.59 at the close in New York
today. The stock has more than doubled this year.  Representatives from Bellevue, Washington-based Expedia and
Englewood, Colorado-based Liberty didn’t return calls for
comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
