Buru Energy Ltd. (BRU) , the second-best
performer on  Australia ’s energy index this year, is targeting as
many as 20 oil prospects in the country’s northwest, seeking to
repeat the first major discovery in the area since the 1980s.  Buru plans to drill two to four oil wells in 2013 in the
onshore Canning Basin, more than 2,000 kilometers (1,240 miles)
north of Perth, and to start full production at the Ungani find
by the end of the year, Eric Streitberg, executive director of
the Perth-based company, said in a phone interview yesterday.  “We’ve got another 10 to 20 prospects that look similar to
the Ungani field,” he said. “We’ll be drilling some of the
highest value potential of those in the coming year.”  The  explorer’s shares  in Sydney trading have almost doubled
in 2012, valuing the company at A$640 million ($670 million),
after finding the Ungani oil in late 2011. Buru has called
Ungani the first onshore oil find in Western Australia since
2001 and the biggest in the Canning Basin since the 1980s.  The Ungani field may hold 20 million barrels of oil,
according to a Dec. 17 report from JPMorgan Chase & Co.  The Australian energy company is also developing shale gas
resources in the Canning Basin and formed a partnership with
 Mitsubishi Corp. (8058)  to explore in the region.  Japan ’s biggest
trading company agreed to contribute as much as A$152.4 million
in exchange for as much as 50 percent of most of Buru’s permits.  Buru ‘Approaches’  While the size of Buru’s gas resources may dwarf the oil
acreage in the basin, it will take “longer to delineate and is
more complicated to commercialize,” according to the JPMorgan
report by Sydney-based analysts Benjamin Wilson and Daniel Butcher, who have an overweight rating on the shares.  Buru expects to decide in the first quarter of 2013 whether
to bring in another partner in the basin to develop oil and gas
permits. The company has been reviewing “approaches” that it
received from companies interested in investing in the region,
Buru said in a presentation last month.  “We’ll do something if it’s value accretive for our
shareholders,” Streitberg said. “We’re looking at all
possibilities to drive value. The choice is do we do it
ourselves or bring in someone early in the project.”  Buru shares have surged 92 percent since Jan. 1 to A$2.34
as of 1:05 p.m. in Sydney, lagging behind only  Drillsearch
Energy Ltd. (DLS) ’s 94 percent gain on the  S&P/ASX 200 Energy Index. (AS51ENRX)   The company reached an agreement last month with the
Western Australia state government allowing for the development
of a proposed domestic gas project and a pipeline that
Streitberg said would cost an estimated A$500 million.  To contact the reporter on this story:
