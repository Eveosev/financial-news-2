taxes for top earners.  Prices retreated after House Speaker John Boehner scrapped
a plan yesterday to allow higher tax rates on annual income
above $1 million, yielding to anti-tax resistance within his own

Balikpapan and Cilacap refineries, according to a document

percent to $3.451 per million British thermal units.  U.K. gas for the next working day declined for a third

months gained 0.8 percent to $7,831 a ton ($3.55 a pound).
