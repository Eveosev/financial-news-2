Regulators in  China , the biggest
consumer of rapeseed after the European Union, approved trading
in rapeseed and rapeseed meal futures to help companies manage
risks amid rising imports and declining domestic production.  The Zhengzhou Commodity Exchange, one of China’s three
futures bourses, has been approved to list the contracts, the
China Securities Regulatory Commission said in a statement dated
yesterday on its website, without saying when trading may begin.
The exchange has had a rapeseed oil contract since 2007.  Rapeseed output in China, the biggest producer before 2011,
has declined as farmers switched to more profitable crops.
Imports, mostly from  Canada , may jump 59 percent to 3 million
metric tons in 2012-2013 from a year earlier, according to
researcher Grain.gov.cn. A telephone call by Bloomberg to the
exchange seeking comment was not immediately returned today.  “This will help Chinese importers and processors” as many
of them have lost money due to a lack of tools to manage their
so-called exposure, Tommy Xiao, an analyst at  Shanghai  JC
Intelligence Co., said by phone from Shanghai. “It will also
exert China’s influence on global prices,” he said.  China’s rapeseed output this year fell 9.1 percent to 12.2
million tons from a year earlier, the China National Grain &
Oils Information Center said last month. China will consume 15
million tons in 2012-2013 compared with the EU’s 22.6 million
tons, U.S. Department of Agriculture data show.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
