The cost to insure European company
debt from default rose from a 17-month low as U.S. budget talks
stalled after House Republican leaders scrapped a plan to allow
higher taxes.  The Markit iTraxx Europe Index of credit-default swaps on
125 investment grade companies climbed three basis points to 112
at 3:12 p.m. in  London , up from the lowest since July 2011,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Credit risk rose after House Speaker  John Boehner  yielded
to anti-tax resistance within the Republican party, throwing
budget negotiations deeper into turmoil. House members and
senators won’t vote on budget issues until after Christmas,
giving them less than a week to reach agreement to avert tax
increases and spending cuts set to take effect in January.  “It became obvious last night that a compromise between
the two parties in order to avoid the U.S. going over the fiscal
cliff is becoming increasingly unlikely,” Markus Huber, head of
German sales trading at ETX Capital in London, wrote in a note.  The cost of insuring against default on high-yield
corporate debt is heading for the first annual decline in three
years, with the Markit iTraxx Crossover Index of swaps on 50
mostly junk rated companies, up 15 basis points today at 460,
from 755 basis points at the start of the year. The Markit
iTraxx Europe Index fell 61.5 basis points this year.  Financial Swaps  Swaps on financial debt are heading for the biggest annual
decline since indexes started trading in 2004. The Markit iTraxx
Financial Index of credit-default swaps on the senior debt of 25
banks and insurers increased four basis points to 138.5 today,
from 279 basis points on Dec. 30, 2011.  The subordinated index rose three basis points to 231 basis
points, compared with 512 at the end of last year.  Swaps on Cyprus rose after  Standard & Poor’s  cut the
nation’s long-term debt rating for the third time in five
months, citing a rising risk of default as the government’s
short-term financing is “increasingly vulnerable.” The grade
fell to CCC+ from B.  The upfront cost of credit-default swaps insuring $10
million of Cyprus’s debt for five years rose by $230,000 to
$3.45 million, according to data provider CMA.  A basis point on a credit-default swap protecting 10
million euros of debt from default for five years is equivalent
to 1,000 euros a year. Swaps pay the buyer face value in
exchange for the underlying securities or the cash equivalent
should a borrower fail to adhere to its debt agreements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
