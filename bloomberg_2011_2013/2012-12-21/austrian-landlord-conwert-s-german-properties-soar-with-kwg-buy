Conwert Immobilien Invest SE (CWI) , an
Austrian landlord, agreed to buy a majority stake in  Germany ’s
 KWG Kommunale Wohnen AG (BIW)  to more than double its apartments in
the country. KWG’s shares rose to the highest since May 2008.  Conwert will buy about 60 percent of the shares in Hamburg-
based KWG, which owns 10,000 apartments in cities such as Berlin
and Dusseldorf, the company said in a statement today. The
acquisition will boost its German holdings by 66 percent to
about 24,500 homes, it said.  “Conwert has a lot of liquid funds that will give us much
better opportunities to grow our portfolio,” Stavros Efremidis,
chief executive officer of KWG, said in a phone interview. Once
the merger is complete, Efremidis will run Conwert’s German
operations.  The companies did not disclose the purchase price. KWG has
a  market value  of about 94 million euros ($124 million). Conwert
said the acquisition values KWG’s properties at about 620 euros
a square meter. KWG climbed as much as 11.75 percent in
Frankfurt trading to 6.84 euros. Conwert was up 2.9 percent at
9.75 euros in Vienna, the highest in more than a year.  KWG agreed to buy 2,908 residential and commercial units in
cities such as Berlin and Bochum for about 89.5 million euros,
the company said in a statement yesterday. The properties were
valued at about 443 euros a square meter. KWG valued its
properties at 758 euros a square meter as of June 30, according
to statement at the time.  To contact the reporters on this story:
