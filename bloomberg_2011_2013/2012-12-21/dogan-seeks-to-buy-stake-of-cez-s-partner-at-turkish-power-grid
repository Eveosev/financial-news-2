Dogan Sirketler Grubu Holding AS (DOHOL) 
started talks to acquire 50 percent stake at Akcez Enerji
Yatirimlari Sanayi & Ticaret AS, a joint venture with Czech  CEZ
AS (CEZ)  that operates an electricity grid in western  Turkey .  Unit Dogan Enerji Yatirimlari Sanayi & Ticaret AS, is
having talks with CEZ’s partner Akkok Sanayi Yatirim &
Gelistirme AS, Dogan said in a filing with the  Istanbul Stock
Exchange  yesterday. Akcez bought Sedas Sakarya Elektrik Dagitim
AS from a government auction for $600 million in 2008.  Akenerji Elektrik Uretim AS (AKENR) , another joint venture between
CEZ and Akkok, announced Aug. 3 it will sell a 45 percent stake
at Akcez to the parents for $140 million, valuing the unit Akcez
at $311 million. The transaction was completed Dec. 19.  “We currently value the entity approximately 1 billion
liras including debt,” Global Menkul Degerler AS, an Istanbul-
based brokerage house, said in an e-mailed note today. “With
more than $1.2 billion net holding cash, Dogan Holding is
eligible to execute such a transaction.”  Dogan Holding jumped as much as 4.7 percent to 0.89 lira in
Istanbul trade, the highest level in a month, and rose 1.2
percent to 0.86 lira at 11:40 a.m.  The Sedas power grid, which covers the industrial provinces
of Sakarya, Bolu and Duzce, has 1.4 million customers and sells
more than 7.5 billion kilowatt-hours of electricity annually,
according to its website.  Dogan Holding, which has interests in media and seeks to
expand in  energy industry , bought two wind power plants with
combined 126 megawatts of capacity for 240 million euros ($301
million) from Agaoglu group in June. Dogan Enerji also applied
yesterday to buy the 600-megawatt Seyitomer coal-fired power
plant from a government auction.  To contact the reporter on this story:
