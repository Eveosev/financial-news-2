A  Florida  debt-relief company will
pay as much as $100,000 in refunds to customers under the first
joint enforcement action between the Consumer Financial
Protection Bureau and its state allies.  Payday Loan Debt Solution Inc. was found to have routinely
charged consumers up-front fees for assistance in settling
debts, the Consumer Bureau said in a statement outlining the
order entered today by the U.S. District Court for the Southern
District of Florida.  “Today’s order will put money back in the pockets of
consumers who were wrongfully charged for debt-relief
services,” Consumer Bureau Director  Richard Cordray  said in the
agency’s statement.  The court found that the Doral, Florida-based company’s
practices violated the federal Telemarketing Sales Rule and the
Dodd-Frank Act of 2010, which created the Consumer Bureau,
according to the agency’s statement. It also ran afoul of
similar state laws, according to the bureau.  Consumers who paid fees but got no debt-settlement services
will get payments from the $100,000. The company will also pay a
$5,000 fine.  The bureau’s action, its first joint enforcement work with
the states, was taken in coordination with the attorneys general
of  New Mexico ,  North Carolina ,  North Dakota  and Wisconsin, and
the Hawaii Office of Consumer Protection.  The company cooperated with the investigation and
immediately ceased unlawful conduct, the CFPB said in its
statement. An e-mail to Sanjeet Parvani, the company’s
president, wasn’t returned.  To contact the reporter on this story:
