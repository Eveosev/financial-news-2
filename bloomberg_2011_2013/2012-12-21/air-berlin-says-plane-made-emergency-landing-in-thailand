Air Berlin Plc (AB1)  said an Airbus A330
plane en route to Abu Dhabi made an emergency landing in Phuket,
 Thailand , because of an unspecified technical fault.  The plane safely returned to Phuket yesterday after takeoff
and all 249 passengers aboard flight AB7425 exited by the normal
stairway, the Berlin-based carrier said today in an e-mailed
statement. The airline said the causes are being investigated
and that it couldn’t confirm a local news report that there had
been an engine fire.  Passengers were supplied with food and drinks upon their
return to the Thai city and have been re-booked to their final
destinations on flights today and tomorrow, Air Berlin said.  Air Berlin is 29 percent-owned by Etihad Airways and
provides code-share flights to the Abu Dhabi-based airline’s
hub.  Germany ’s second-largest airline said Dec. 18 that it
agreed to sell a 70 percent stake in its frequent-flier program
to Etihad to shore up its balance sheet.  Air Berlin fell as much as 3.3 percent to 1.58 euros and
was trading down 2.3 percent at 11:56 a.m. in  Frankfurt . The
stock has tumbled 36 percent this year, valuing the company at
187 million euros ($247 million).  To contact the reporter on this story:
