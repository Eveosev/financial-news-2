Payrolls increased in 30 states in
November, and the unemployment rate dropped in 45, showing the
job market improved across much of the U.S. even as superstorm
Sandy represented a setback for the Northeast.  North Carolina  led the nation with a 30,600 gain in
payrolls, followed by Florida with 24,500 more jobs, figures
from the Labor Department showed today in Washington. Employment
dropped by 33,500 in  New York  and fell by 8,100 in New Jersey in
the wake of storm.  Gains in jobs are helping to sustain  consumer spending ,
which accounts for about 70 percent of the economy. At the same
time, businesses are unlikely to accelerate hiring while they
wait for an agreement among lawmakers to avert more than $600
billion in tax increases and spending cuts slated for 2013.  “Progress in the labor market is slow and steady,” Sam Coffin, an economist at UBS Securities LLC in  Stamford ,
 Connecticut , said before the report. “We’ve had some decent
payroll growth. Once the fiscal cliff is resolved, there’s
potential for faster hiring and income gains.”  The  unemployment rate  dropped the most in  Louisiana ,
falling 0.8 percentage point to 5.8 percent in November.
 Nevada ’s jobless rate showed the second-biggest decrease,
falling to 10.8 percent last month from 11.5 in October.
Nonetheless, Nevada remained the state with the highest rate in
the country. Rhode Island was second, with a rate of 10.4
percent, followed by California at 9.8 percent.  North Dakota had the lowest unemployment in the nation,
holding at 3.1 percent.  Sandy Impact  The Labor Department said it did not attempt to quantify
the job-market damage from Sandy for the states in the affected
area.  The storm left about 8 million homes and businesses without
power for days after making landfall in New Jersey on Oct. 29.
The 26 counties designated as major disaster areas after the
storm had an average 1,301  labor force  participants per square
mile, about 30 times the average labor force density for the
U.S. in 2011, according to the Labor Department.  Employers nationwide added 146,000 jobs last month, more
than the median forecast of economists surveyed by Bloomberg and
following a revised 138,000 gain in October, Labor Department
data showed on Dec. 7. The U.S. unemployment rate fell to 7.7
percent as the labor force shrank.  While the Labor Department said on Dec. 7 that Sandy didn’t
“substantively impact” the data, its poll of households showed
that 369,000 people were not at work because of bad weather
during the survey week. The average of the last 10 Novembers was
70,000 in the survey, which is used to calculate the jobless
rate.  Payroll Losses  While  New Jersey  showed a drop in payrolls, the state’s
jobless rate dropped to 9.6 percent from 9.7 percent in the
prior month.  New York’s unemployment rate fell to 8.3 percent from 8.7
percent in October.  In addition to New York and New Jersey,  Indiana  showed a
9,100 decrease in employment last month, the report showed.  State and local employment data are derived independently
from the national statistics, which are typically released on
the first Friday of every month. The state figures are subject
to larger sampling errors because they come from smaller
surveys, making the national figures more reliable, according to
the government’s Bureau of Labor Statistics.  The  Federal Reserve  on Dec. 12 said it will expand stimulus
to spur growth. It also for the first time linked its interest-
rate outlook to economic thresholds, saying rates will stay low
“at least as long” as unemployment remains above 6.5 percent and
if it projects inflation of no more than 2.5 percent one or two
years in the future. Fed officials don’t see the jobless rate
falling near that goal until 2015.  To contact the reporters on this story:
