The  International Monetary Fund 
approved a second tranche for  Kosovo  from its stand-by
arrangement after reviewing the loan program that may become
precautionary next year.  The $53.9 million tranche brings the total disbursed to
Kosovo to $120.9 million, as part of the 20-month, $140.57
million program, the lender said in a  statement  yesterday.  “Macroeconomic and financial policies are on track,
notwithstanding a slowdown in economic growth that has
complicated the meeting of fiscal targets,” according to the
statement. Kosovo’s plan to treat the arrangement as
precautionary in 2013, provided the return of the government’s
bank balance to a fully adequate level, “is ensured. The 2013
budget brings Kosovo close to a fully sustainable fiscal
stance.”  The economy of Kosovo, which declared independence from
 Serbia  in 2008, is driven by remittances from its diaspora.
Gross domestic product is forecast to expand 3 percent this year
and in 2013, higher than in most neighboring states, the IMF
said in October.  To contact the reporter on this story:
