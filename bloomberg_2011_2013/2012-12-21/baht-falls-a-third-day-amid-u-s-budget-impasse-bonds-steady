Thailand ’s 10-year bonds had the
best week in two months on optimism demand for existing debt
will rise as the government hasn’t scheduled any issuance over
the next month.  Funds based overseas bought $499 million more of the
nations’ securities than they sold this week through yesterday,
 data  from the Thai Bond Market Association show. The Bank of
Thailand sold 30 billion baht ($980 million) of notes due 2014
yesterday, the final bond sale of the year. The baht
strengthened this week.  “There’s no issuance in the next two weeks and there are
market expectations there’ll be no supply in the first two weeks
of January as well,” said  Rohit Arora , a Singapore-based fixed-
income strategist at Barclays Plc. “Thailand bond yields are
very attractive.”  The yield on the 3.625 percent government bonds due June
2023 fell five basis points, or 0.05 percentage point, this week
to 3.56 percent as of 4:22 p.m. in Bangkok, the most since the
five days ended Oct. 19, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The rate fell one basis point today and has increased
16 basis points in 2012.  The baht rose 0.1 percent this week to 30.61 per dollar and
was little changed from 30.62 yesterday, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. It appreciated 3.1 percent this year.  One-month implied volatility, a measure of expected moves
in exchange rates used to price options, was unchanged today and
this week at 3.91 percent. It fell 261 basis points in 2012.  Trading volume is subdued because many investors are away
for the seasonal holidays, Bank of Thailand’s Senior Director
Alisara Mahasandana told reporters yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
