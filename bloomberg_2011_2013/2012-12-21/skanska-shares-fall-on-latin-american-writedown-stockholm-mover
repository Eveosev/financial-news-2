Skanska AB (SKAB) , the Nordic region’s
biggest construction company, fell the most in five months in
 Stockholm  trading after saying it will take a fourth-quarter
writedown at Latin American construction operations.  The shares dropped as much as 3.9 percent, the biggest
intraday decline since July 19. Skanska traded 2.8 percent lower
at 107.40 kronor as of 12:42 p.m. local time.  The 500 million-kronor ($76.7 million) charge is related to
costs in one ongoing project and two completed projects,
Stockholm-based Skanska said today in a statement. Ground
conditions and utility issues led to “substantially” higher
costs in the current project. Increased costs in the completed
projects are related to getting them finished on schedule after
scope changes, Skanska said.  “We are now working intensively to enhance and deepen the
risk management in large and complex projects in  Latin
America ,” Skanska Chief Executive Officer Johan Karlstrom said
in the statement.  Client management changes make it difficult to predict when
compensation can be received for the two completed projects,
Skanska said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
