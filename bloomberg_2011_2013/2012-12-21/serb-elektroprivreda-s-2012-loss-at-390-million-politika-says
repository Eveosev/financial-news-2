Elektroprivreda Srbije,  Serbia ’s
dominant power producer, will post a loss this year on costly
first-quarter imports and reduced output from its hydro plants,
Politika reported, citing general manager Aleksandar Obradovic.  The state-run company, which had to turn to costlier power
generation in gas-fired plants, will have a loss of 33.4 billion
dinars ($390 million), after posting a net income of 26.8
billion dinars in 2011, Politika said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
