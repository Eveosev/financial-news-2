President  Barack Obama  joined
lawmakers, allies and family friends at a memorial service today
honoring the life of Senator Daniel Inouye, the war hero who
represented Hawaii since statehood in 1959.  Obama, who was born in Hawaii, called Inouye one of “my
earliest political inspirations.” He recalled that as a child,
seeing Inouye on television during the Watergate hearings,
“hinted to me what might be possible in my own life.”  Like others who paid tribute to Inouye during a service at
Washington National Cathedral, Obama said the late senator
served the nation with “fundamental integrity.”  Tributes were also made by former President  Bill Clinton ,
Vice President  Joe Biden , Senate Majority Leader  Harry Reid , and
Veterans Affairs Secretary Eric Shinseki.  Inouye, a Democrat and the most senior U.S. senator, died
Dec. 17 of respiratory complications. He was 88.  Inouye, an American of Japanese ancestry who lost his right
arm fighting for the U.S. in World War II, served 50 years in
Congress , winning the House seat in 1959 and the Senate seat in
1962. He was the second longest-serving lawmaker in history
after the late  Robert Byrd  of West Virginia, who served 51 1/2
years.  Biden, who served with Inouye in the Senate, said he was
“a historic figure” who overcame prejudice as he “fought for
the country he loved”  Inouye’s body is scheduled to arrive in Hawaii tomorrow,
where he will lie in state at the state Capitol from 5 p.m. to
midnight local time, the Honolulu Star Advertiser reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
