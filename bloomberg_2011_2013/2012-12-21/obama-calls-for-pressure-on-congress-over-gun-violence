President  Barack Obama  urged gun-
control advocates to pressure U.S. lawmakers to ban sales of
military-style assault weapons and high-capacity ammunition
clips after last week’s massacre at an elementary school.  While calling most gun owners responsible, Obama said in a
video posted today on  Google Inc. (GOOG) ’s YouTube website that he is
seeking proposals by early next month. An online petition
related to firearms violence had collected 400,000 signatures
since last week, according to a White House statement.  The shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown,
Connecticut, killed 20 children and six adults, leading Obama to
promise to make abating gun violence a priority in his second-
term agenda. The topic will be part of his  State of the Union 
address in late January, and he is soliciting recommendations
for legislative action and executive orders.  Obama, who named Vice President  Joe Biden  this week to lead
a  task force  on gun violence, is calling for reinstating an
assault weapons ban that expired in 2004, closing loopholes that
allow gun buyers to escape background checks and restricting
high-capacity ammunition clips.  “We hear you,” Obama said in the YouTube video. He said
he “will do everything in my power as president to advance
these efforts.”  The main weapon used by the gunman in the Dec. 14
Connecticut school shooting was a semi-automatic rifle with
multiple high-capacity magazines, according to police. The
gunman, Adam Lanza, who fatally shot his mother before going to
the school, committed suicide.  To contact the reporter on this story:
