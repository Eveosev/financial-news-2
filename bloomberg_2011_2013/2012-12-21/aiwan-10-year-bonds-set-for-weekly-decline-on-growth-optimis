Taiwan ’s government bonds dropped
for a third week, driving the benchmark 10-year yield to a two-
month high, as optimism the island’s economy is improving damped
demand for safer assets.  Official data yesterday showed export orders, an indicator
of shipments in the next one to three months, rose 11 percent in
November from a year earlier, more than the median estimate of
3.9 percent in a Bloomberg News survey and the previous month’s
3.2 percent advance.  Stock indexes  fell across Asia today after
U.S. House Republican leaders canceled a planned vote that would
permit higher taxes as budget talks stalled.  “Taiwan’s economic data shows the outlook is getting more
promising,” said Albert Lee, a Taipei-based fixed-income trader
at Cathay United Bank Co. “But the fiscal cliff is one big
event risk. It’ll overshadow the improving fundamentals.”  The yield on the government’s 1.125 percent bonds due
September 2022 rose one basis point to 1.151 percent this week,
according to Gretai Securities Market. It touched 1.152 percent
on Dec. 19, the highest level since Oct. 18, and was steady
today.  Taiwan’s dollar slipped 0.1 percent this week and was
little changed today at NT$29.122 against its U.S. counterpart,
based on Taipei Forex Inc. prices. The currency has appreciated
4 percent this year, poised for a fourth annual gain. One-month
implied volatility, a measure of expected moves in exchange
rates used to price options, rose five basis points, or 0.05
percentage point, to 3 percent this week. It was 6.30 percent at
the end of 2011.  Relative Stability  Taiwan’s central bank has bought the greenback to counter
gains in the island’s currency on most days in the past eight
months, according to traders who asked not to be identified. The
monetary authority’s mandate is to keep relative exchange-rate
stability and to intervene in the event of abnormal moves,
Governor Perng Fai-nan said Dec. 19, when he and his board kept
the benchmark interest rate unchanged at 1.875 percent for a
sixth straight quarterly meeting.  The  overnight interbank lending  rate was steady at 0.389
percent, a weighted average compiled by the Taiwan Interbank
Money Center shows.  To contact the reporter on this story:
