Lawyers for  Facebook Inc. (FB)  users who
negotiated a $20 million settlement with the social network
company over claims that it used subscribers’ names without
their permission are seeking $7.7 million in fees.  California  attorneys Robert Arns and Jonathan Jaffe, who
represented five Facebook users suing over the free service’s
practice of using subscribers’ names without their permission to
advertise products in its “Sponsored Stories,” said the fee
was fair given relief provided in the settlement and the risks
they undertook to achieve it, according to a court filing.  Facebook users can claim a $10 payment and the company
agreed to make changes allowing subscribers to opt out of
sponsored stories, according to filings in federal court in  San
Francisco . Facebook, based in Menlo Park, California, also
agreed to revise its terms of use so subscribers can more easily
see when they’re being shown as endorsers of products and games
for which they clicked a “like” button.  U.S. District Judge Richard Seeborg gave preliminary
approval to the settlement. He refused to approve an earlier
settlement that included no money for users and $10 million in
fees for the attorneys.  The case is Fraley v. Facebook Inc., 11-cv-01726, U.S.
District Court, Northern District of California ( San Jose ).  To contact the reporter on this story:
