The cost of insuring corporate bonds
in  Japan  from non-payment fell, according to prices from credit-
default swap traders.  The Markit iTraxx Japan index dropped 1.5 basis points to
158.5 basis points as of 10:20 a.m. in  Tokyo , Deutsche Bank AG
prices show. The index, which has ranged from 136.2 basis points
to 229.5 basis points this year, closed at 157.4 basis points on
Dec. 19, its least since April, CMA prices show.  The Markit iTraxx Asia index of 40 investment-grade
borrowers outside Japan was little changed at 108 basis points
as of 8:42 a.m. in  Hong Kong , Credit Agricole SA prices show.
The index advanced 1.1 basis points yesterday, rebounding from a
19-month of low of 107 on Dec. 19, according to CMA, which is
owned by McGraw-Hill Cos. and compiles prices quoted by dealers
in the privately negotiated market. The benchmark is set to fall
for a seventh consecutive month.  The Markit iTraxx Australia index was also little changed
at 120 as of 11:42 a.m in Sydney, Credit Agricole prices show.  Credit-default swap indexes are benchmarks for insuring
bonds against default and traders use them to speculate on
 credit quality . A drop signals improving perceptions of
creditworthiness, while an increase suggests the opposite.  The swap contracts pay the buyer face value in exchange for
the underlying securities if a borrower fails to meet its debt
agreements.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
