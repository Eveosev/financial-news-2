Aeroports de Paris  fell the most in
3 1/2 years after the operator of the airports serving  France ’s
capital city cut traffic and earnings forecasts for coming years
and outlined cost cuts because of  Europe ’s shrinking economy.  Aeroports de Paris (ADP)   dropped  9.1 percent to 56.29 euros, the
steepest intraday decline since June 17, 2009, and was trading
down 5.9 percent at 10:43 a.m. That pared the stock’s gain this
year to 9.9 percent, valuing the company at 5.77 billion euros
($7.62 billion). Volume was almost triple the three-month daily
average.  The airport operator expects average annual growth in
passenger numbers of 1.9 percent to 2.9 percent in the five
years through 2015, down from a 3.2 percent forecast, the Paris-
based company said today in a statement. Earnings before
interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization in the six years
through 2015 will increase 25 percent to 35 percent versus a 40
percent growth projection.  “The slowing growth in traffic witnessed since summer
2012, as well as recent economic forecasts, have led Aeroports
de Paris to adjust its traffic assumption,” the company said.
The airport operator said it’s undertaking a spending reduction
program to reduce operating costs by an average 3 percent from
now through 2015.  The 17 nations that use the euro fell into recession in the
third quarter. The  European Central Bank  is forecasting that the
bloc’s economy will shrink by 0.3 percent in 2013.  To contact the reporter on this story:
