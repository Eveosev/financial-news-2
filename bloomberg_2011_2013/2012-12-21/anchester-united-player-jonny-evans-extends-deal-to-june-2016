Jonny Evans will stay at  Manchester
United  until “at least” June 2016, the club said today.  The 24-year-old Northern Irish defender has made 141
appearances for United, scoring four goals since he made his
debut in 2007 for the 19-time English champion.   “Jonny has risen through the ranks to become an integral
part of the first team squad,” United manager  Alex Ferguson 
said in a statement on the club’s website. “He has developed
into a top player for us and has scored a couple of important
goals this season too. I am delighted he has signed a new
contract.”   Evans said he was “so proud to play for such a great
club.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
