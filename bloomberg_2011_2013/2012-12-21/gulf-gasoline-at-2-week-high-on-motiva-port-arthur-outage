Gasoline strengthened on the Gulf
Coast, reaching the the highest level versus futures in more
than two weeks, after a power failure shut units at Motiva
Enterprises LLC’s Port Arthur oil refinery in  Texas .  Most process units at the refinery were shut yesterday as
power and steam were lost during a storm, said Kimberly Windon,
a Motiva spokeswoman in Houston. While power has been restored,
“it is too early to tell when the units will be restarted, as
this will be done only when it is safe to do so,” Windon said
in an e-mail.  The refinery’s 325,000-barrel-a-day crude unit had fires
Dec. 11 and Dec. 18 because of a leak on the system’s heater
outlet, said a person with knowledge of the plant’s operations
who asked not to be identified because the information isn’t
public. The plant is expected to finish repairs and try to
restart by Dec. 23, the person said.  Conventional gasoline  to be blended with ethanol on the
Gulf Coast gained 2 cents to a discount of 18 cents below
futures on the  New York  Mercantile Exchange at 10:34 a.m., the
narrowest gap since Dec. 4. Ultra-low-sulfur diesel in the
region was unchanged at 3 cents below heating oil futures.  Reformulated, 91-octane gasoline in New York Harbor
retreated 0.37 cent to 3.88 cents above futures after  Phillips
66 (PSX)  reported a malfunction on a lube oil pump of the C1
compressor at the 238,000-barrel-a-day Bayway refinery in New
Jersey. The plant is the largest single refinery in the area.  To contact the reporter on this story:
