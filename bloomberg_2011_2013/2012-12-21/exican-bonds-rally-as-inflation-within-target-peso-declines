Mexican peso bond yields fell the
most in three weeks as a report indicated that inflation slowed
to within the central bank’s target range for the first time
since May.  Yields on the bonds due in 2024 sank five basis points, or
0.05 percentage point, to 5.48 percent at 4 p.m. in  Mexico  City,
the biggest drop on a closing basis since Nov. 30. The yield is
up one basis point for the week.  Mexican inflation slowed in the first half of December to
3.76 percent from 4.18 percent in the prior month, compared with
the central bank’s target range of 2 percent to 4 percent. The
0.27 percent increase from two weeks earlier was less than the
median forecast of 13 economists surveyed by Bloomberg.  The currency dropped as progress stalled on efforts to
avert more than $600 billion in tax increases and spending cuts
in the U.S., which buys 80 percent of Mexico’s exports. House
Speaker  John Boehner  scrapped a plan to allow higher tax rates
on annual income above $1 million, yielding to resistance within
his own party and throwing already-stalled budget talks deeper
into disarray.  The peso fell 1.3 percent to 12.9268 per  U.S. dollar  after
retreating as much as 1.5 percent, the biggest intraday drop
since July 23. The slump pared the currency’s advance to 7.8
percent this year, still the biggest rally among the dollar’s 16
major counterparts tracked by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
