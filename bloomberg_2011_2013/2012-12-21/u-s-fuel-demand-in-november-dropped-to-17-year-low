U.S. fuel demand in November dropped
to the lowest level for the month in 17 years as weakness in the
economy curbed consumption of diesel and gasoline, the  American
Petroleum Institute  said.  Total deliveries of petroleum products, a measure of
demand, dropped 3.3 percent to 18.5 million barrels a day last
month from a year earlier, the industry-funded group said today
in a report. Year-to-date consumption has averaged 18.6 million
barrels a day, down 2.1 percent from the same period in 2011.  Total demand for distillate fuel, a category that includes
diesel and heating oil, tumbled 6.3 percent to 3.85 million
barrels a day. Consumption of ultra-low sulfur diesel, the type
used on highways, slipped 4.5 percent to average 3.54 million
barrels a day, the report showed.  “The economy has shown modest improvement, in employment
for example, but the fundamentals of fuel demand fail to
indicate a strengthening recovery is imminent,”  John Felmy ,
chief economist with the Washington-based API, said in the
report. “Look at the weakness in distillate deliveries,
including ultra-low sulfur diesel, which is critical to shipping
just about everything in our economy.”  Heating oil consumption dropped 24 percent from a year
earlier to 298,000 barrels a day in November, the report showed.  Gasoline demand declined 0.3 percent to 8.51 million
barrels a day last month from November 2011.  Jet fuel consumption slipped 0.5 percent to 1.41 million
barrels a day last month, according to the API.  U.S. crude-oil production increased 13 percent to 6.79
million barrels a day in November, compared with the same month
in 2011. Output in the lower 48 states rose 15 percent to 6.2
million barrels a day. Alaskan production slipped 0.2 percent to
592,000 barrels a day.  To contact the reporter on this story:
