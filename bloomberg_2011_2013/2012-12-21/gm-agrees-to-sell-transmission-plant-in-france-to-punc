     Dec. 22 (Bloomberg) -- General Motors Co., will sell a
French transmission plant to a private Belgian company as part
of an effort to end losses in  Europe  that have totaled $17.3
billion since 1999.  The plant in Strasbourg,  France , will be bought by Punch
Metals International, which will retain the employees, according
to a GM statement on its website yesterday. ZF Friedrichshafen
AG, a maker of auto and truck parts, agreed to purchase
transmissions from the plant. A price wasn’t disclosed.  GM will be a customer of the factory in 2013 and 2014 “to
maintain a robust level” of output “to provide for a smooth
transition” to a ZF-based product line, the automaker said. The
plant employs about 1,000 people.  GM started a strategic review of the plant in May, hiring
 Barclays Plc (BARC)  to solicit bids from potential buyers, while also
evaluating other options to keep the facility open. The Detroit-
based automaker said in October losses in Europe may reach $1.8
billion this year, and that it’s seeking to break even in the
region within three years.  GM said yesterday it expects to complete the plant sale
early next year.  GM fell 0.1 percent to $27.32 at the close in  New York 
yesterday. The shares have gained 35 percent this year as of
yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
