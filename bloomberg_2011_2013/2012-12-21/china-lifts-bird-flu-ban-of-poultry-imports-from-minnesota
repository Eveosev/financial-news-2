China lifted a ban on poultry
imports from  Minnesota  imposed after an outbreak of avian flu,
the General Administration of Quality Supervision, Inspection
and Quarantine said on its website today.  Poultry imports from Minnesota were banned in July 2011,
according to the agency’s announcement from that time.  China’s Ministry of Commerce had separately in August 2010
imposed five-year punitive tariffs on U.S. broiler chicken and
related products because the industry received what it
determined to be subsidized soybeans and corn.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
