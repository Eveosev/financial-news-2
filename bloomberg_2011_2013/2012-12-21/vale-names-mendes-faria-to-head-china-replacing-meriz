Vale SA (VALE5) , the world’s largest iron-
ore producer, named Joao Mendes Faria as country manager for
China, its main market for the steel-making ingredient.  Mendes Faria, Vale’s director of  iron-ore  business
development in Singapore, replaces Luiz Meriz in China, Vale’s
press office said in an e-mailed statement today. Meriz will
return to Rio de Janeiro to head iron-ore marketing, it said.  Vale, which has operations in China since 1973, runs a
nickel refinery in the Asian country and has five joint ventures
in the pelletizing and coal businesses, according to company’s
 website . The miner shipped 38.3 million metric tons of iron ore
and pellets to China during the third quarter, 9.1 percent more
than in the previous year, it said Oct. 24.  Vale  dropped  0.8 percent to close at 40.50 reais in  Sao
Paulo . The stock advanced 7.1 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
