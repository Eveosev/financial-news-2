Kenya ’s shilling strengthened for
the first week in three, helped by increased dollar inflows from
tourism and workers abroad remitting money home during the
holiday season.  The currency of  East Africa ’s largest economy gained as
much as 0.6 percent before retreating to 0.2 percent weaker at
85.95 a dollar by 5:13 p.m. in Nairobi, trimming this week’s
advance to 0.2 percent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Tourism in Kenya, which is home to wild game reserves such
as the Maasai Mara Park and Indian Ocean beaches, earned the
country 98 billion shillings last year, making it one of the
nation’s chief foreign exchange earners alongside tea exports.  “There are some flows from tourism during this peak season
and diaspora flows because they are sending home cash for their
families at Christmas,” Duncan Kinuthia, head of trading for
Commercial Bank of Africa Ltd., said by phone from Nairobi.  Uganda ’s shilling weakened 0.2 percent to 2,650 a dollar,
while the Tanzanian currency gained for the fourth day,
advancing 0.5 percent to 1,580 a dollar. A close at that level
would be the strongest since Oct. 22.  To contact the reporter on this story:
