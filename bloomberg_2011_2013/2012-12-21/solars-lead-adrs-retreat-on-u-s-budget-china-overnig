Chinese equities fell in New York,
pushing the benchmark index to its biggest slump in three weeks,
on concern a standstill in the U.S. budget talks will crimp
demand for the Asian nation’s exports and hamper its recovery.  The  Bloomberg China-US Equity Index (CH55BN)  of the most-traded
Chinese shares sank 1.3 percent to 96.42 in New York, paring its
gain this week to 0.6 percent.  E-House China Holdings Ltd. (EJ)  was
the worst performer on the gauge and  SouFun Holdings Ltd. (SFUN) 
dropped after  China  Securities Journal said the nation may
introduce new housing curbs. Yingli Green Energy Holding Co. and
 LDK Solar Co. Ltd. (LDK)  led declines in solar stocks.  The U.S. House Republican leaders canceled a vote on higher
taxes for top earners before Christmas. The  Congressional Budget
Office  said that a failure to reach an agreement to avert tax
increases and spending cuts in the nation, the biggest buyer of
Chinese goods, would probably lead to a recession next year. The
 China-US gauge  lost 15 percent in the seven quarters to the end
of September amid falling export demand from Europe and the U.S.  “If the U.S. went into recession in 2013, it’s likely to
become a very big drag on exports from China,” Christian Deseglise, who helps oversee $426 billion at HSBC Global Asset
Management, said by phone from New York yesterday. “We’re
seeing some good engines coming from  emerging markets , but it
all depends on what happens in the U.S.”  ‘Irrational Exuberance’  The  iShares FTSE China 25 Index Fund , the biggest Chinese
exchange-traded fund in the U.S., declined 1.3 percent to $39.24
for a weekly loss of 0.3 percent. The ETF has risen 13 percent
this year. The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index dropped 0.9 percent
to 1,430.15.  The  Hang Seng China Enterprises Index (HSCEI)  slid 1.1 percent
yesterday to 11,229.09, retreating 0.7 percent for the week. The
gauge has climbed 13 percent in 2012. The  Shanghai Composite
Index (SHCOMP)  slipped 0.7 percent to 2,153.31 from the highest level in
four months, bringing its loss this year to 2.1 percent. The
China-US measure has added 6.8 percent in 2012.  China “won’t rule out the possibility” of introducing new
housing curbs after the  property market  rebounded in November
and some regions saw “ irrational exuberance ,” China Securities
Journal reported yesterday, citing an unidentified person in the
industry.  SouFun, the Beijing-based owner of the largest real estate
information website in China, dropped 2.2 percent to $24.46, the
biggest slump in two weeks. Shanghai-based real estate agency E-
House tumbled 13 percent to $3.64, leading declines on the
China-US measure and extending its weekly plunge to 15 percent.  Listing Rules  LDK, based in Xinyu in China’s Jiangxi province, fell for a
second day, dropping 9.4 percent to $1.15. Baoding, China-based
Yingli fell for a second day, dropping 6.8 percent to $2.18.  China relaxed rules for overseas listings as regulators
study ways to clear a backlog of applications for domestic
offerings. The China Securities Regulatory Commission’s website
posted on Dec. 20 new guidelines for first-time share sales on
overseas markets that will from next year replace a document
issued in 1999. The rules “better accommodate” the financing
needs of smaller companies, the regulator said.  Under the previous rules, companies were required to
achieve annual net income of at least 60 million  yuan  ($9.6
million) and have net assets of 400 million yuan before they
could apply to list outside China. The size of the IPOs could
also be no less than $50 million, according to the 1999 rules.
The new rules don’t include these requirements.  NQ Mobile Inc. (NQ) , China’s biggest mobile-phone security
company, gained the most on the Bloomberg measure, adding 7.3
percent to $6.5.  To contact the reporters on this story:
