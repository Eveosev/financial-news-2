Yum! Brands Inc. (YUM) , owner of the KFC
and Pizza Hut chains, said it’s cooperating with the Chinese
government’s review of its chicken suppliers and doesn’t
anticipate a shortage of product.  “We’re cooperating fully with the Chinese government’s
review of two poultry suppliers who provided chicken with
unapproved levels of antibiotics to KFC,” the Louisville,
Kentucky-based company said in a filing with the U.S. Securities
and Exchange Commission. “These suppliers represent an
extremely small percentage of product to KFC. As such, we do not
anticipate a shortage of product supply.”  Yum is undergoing investigations by the Shanghai  Food and
Drug Administration , which said tests conducted by a third-party
agency from 2010 to 2011 found eight batches of chicken supplied
by Liuhe Group Co. had levels of antibiotics that didn’t meet
prescribed standards. Yum, which got 44 percent of its  revenue 
from China last year, was made aware of these results, the
agency said on its website yesterday.  The agency has said it plans to investigate if Yum properly
dealt with the test results. Yum stopped buying from Liuhe in
August, it said in its KFC microblog.  Yum fell 3.9 percent to $63.88 at the close in  New York .
The  shares  have gained 8.3 percent this year.  The fast-food company also said in the filing that recent
publicity has had a “moderate sales impact the past few days.”  Yum, which also owns Taco Bell, has more than 4,900
locations in  China .  To contact the reporter on this story:
