Crane Co. (CR) , the maker of plane parts,
pumps and composite materials, agreed to buy MEI Conlux Holdings
(U.S.) Inc. for about $820 million to add machines for handling
bank notes.  Crane will buy the company and its Japanese affiliate from
Bain Capital Partners LLC and Advantage Partners LLP, according
to a statement late yesterday. The price, which is on a cash and
debt-free basis, is 9.6 times MEI’s estimated earnings for this
year, it said.  The deal will boost earnings by about 25 cents a share
within the first year and by 30 cents on a pretax basis by 2015,
Crane said. The  Stamford , Connecticut-based company has expanded
its payment-solutions business through three acquisitions since
2006. MEI’s products include  bill validators  used in  slot
machines .  Crane will fund the deal using cash and additional debt. It
expects to complete the transaction in the second quarter of
2013, according to the statement.  The company reiterated that earnings this year will
probably be in the lower half of its previously announced
forecast range of $3.75 to $3.85 per share, excluding special
items.  Its preliminary forecast for next year includes “core”
sales growth of as much as 4 percent, and earnings per share of
$4.05 to $4.20.  MEI, which was founded by Mars Inc. in 1969, bought Japan-
based Conlux in 2003, according to the statement. Bain and
Advantage bought the group in 2006, it said. Terms weren’t
disclosed in the April 2006 statement announcing the deal.  To contact the reporter on this story:
