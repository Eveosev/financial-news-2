  Xinjiang Goldwind Science &
Technology Co. (2208) , China’s biggest wind-turbine maker, said 2013
profit may triple on increased sales and cost controls.  Net income will increase to as much as 459.2 million  yuan 
($75 million) from 153.1 million yuan a year earlier, Goldwind
said in a filing to the Hong Kong stock exchange yesterday.
Third-quarter net income climbed to 95.3 million yuan, compared
with a net loss of 33.6 million yuan a year ago, as sales jumped
57 percent to 3.87 billion yuan, Goldwind said.  “Increase in the company’s revenues, stronger cost
controls and further implementation of lean management,” will
contribute to the gain in profit, according to the statement.  Goldwind and competitors such as  Vestas Wind Systems A/S (VWS)  of
Denmark are cutting costs to counter slower growth that has
trimmed margins across the industry.  China ’s wind capacity
addition may be 13 gigawatts in 2013, 6 percent less than a year
earlier, according to estimates by Bloomberg New Energy Finance.  Orders outstanding were 4,205 megawatts at the end of
September, the company said. It has an additional 3,626
megawatts of orders lined up for which contracts have to be
signed.  The stock gained 3.7 percent to HK$7.60 at the close in
Hong Kong trading yesterday before the earnings were announced.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
