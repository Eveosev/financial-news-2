India agreed to a $360 million loan
from the  World Bank  for water works to modernize irrigation,
rebuild dams and drainage systems and for groundwater studies in
 Uttar Pradesh , its most populous state.  The Finance Ministry said the credit agreement with the
development bank for the second phase of a water project in the
northern state that borders Nepal was signed yesterday, with a
closing date for the works set for October 2020.  Uttar Pradesh is considered the heartland of India with
almost one-sixth of the population, or 200 million people. The
state, whose capital is Lucknow, includes the central plains of
the Ganges River, its tributaries and the southern uplands.  To contact the reporter on this story:
