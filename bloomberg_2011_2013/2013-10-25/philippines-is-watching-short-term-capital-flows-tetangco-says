The Philippine central bank is
monitoring the impact of short-term capital flows on financial
markets, Governor Amando Tetangco said, as emerging-markets
confront the prospect of a reduction in U.S. monetary stimulus.  “Even with the capital outflow, the balance of payments
has still remained in surplus and it is something that will
continue,” Tetangco said by phone today in a Bloomberg
Television interview with  Rishaad Salamat . “We continue to
watch the short-term capital flows and see how these can
possibly affect our financial markets.”  Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas  held its benchmark  interest
rate  at a record-low 3.5 percent for an eighth meeting yesterday
to support  Southeast Asia ’s fastest-growing economy as inflation
stays within the central bank’s targeted range. “Buoyant”
domestic demand and favorable business and consumer sentiment
reduced the need for further monetary policy stimulus, Tetangco
said today.  “Within-target inflation forecasts for the next three
years and the firmly anchored inflation expectations” provide
benign inflation dynamics, the governor said. The central bank
also wants to “keep a steady hand given the still volatile
global financial markets that have been caused basically by
unresolved fiscal issues in the U.S.,” he said.  The Monetary Board took note of strong liquidity growth,
which is expected to be temporary and is a result of adjustments
to the special deposit account facility, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
