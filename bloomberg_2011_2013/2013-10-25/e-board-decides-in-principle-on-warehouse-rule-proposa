The board of the  London  Metal
Exchange, which regulates more than 700 warehouses, decided on
delivery rules “in principle” after meeting in London.  “The decision has been made in principle and there will be
an announcement in due course,” Nat Le Roux, non-executive
director, said at the LME today. “I can’t say any more than
that.”  Warehouse companies where waits exceed 100 days would have
to deliver more metal than they take in under the proposal
announced July 1. Industry consultations were completed at the
end of September and the new policy will come into effect April
1 if approved. The announcement will contain “the results and
details of the consultation,” Miriam Heywood, a spokeswoman for
the LME, said in an e-mailed statement today.  The U.K.’s Financial Conduct Authority, which supervises
the LME, has a right to object to the rule changes if they’re
deemed inconsistent with the bourse’s regulatory obligations,
spokeswoman Lara Joseph said by phone Oct. 21.  LME was bought by  Hong Kong Exchanges & Clearing Ltd. (388)  for
$2.2 billion last year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
