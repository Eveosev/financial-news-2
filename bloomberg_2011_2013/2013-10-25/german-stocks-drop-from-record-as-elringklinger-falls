German stocks  closed little changed
at a record as business confidence in Europe’s largest economy
declined while U.S. orders for durable goods topped forecasts.  ElringKlinger AG (ZIL2) , a German car-parts maker, tumbled the
most in seven months after reporting third-quarter revenue that
missed estimates.  Wacker Chemie AG (WCH)  sank 4.4 percent after
Macquarie Group Ltd. downgraded the shares.  BASF SE (BAS) , the world’s
biggest chemical maker, added 1.3 percent after profit beat
analysts’ projections.  The  DAX Index (DAX)  increased less than 0.1 percent to an all-time high of 8,985.74 at the close of trading in  Frankfurt ,
bringing this week’s rally to 1.4 percent. The benchmark gauge
has increased 4.6 percent in October as U.S. lawmakers agreed to
lift the federal debt ceiling and investors speculated that a
worse-than-forecast payrolls report would delay a reduction in
the  Federal Reserve ’s stimulus program. The broader HDAX Index
also rose less than 0.1 percent today.  “ Germany  is the engine room of European growth and today’s
business confidence data is very disappointing,” Jeremy Batstone-Carr, head of research at Charles Stanley Group Plc in
London, said in a telephone interview. “This may once again
make investors begin to question the sluggishness of the euro-zone economy.”  The Ifo institute’s  business climate index , based on a
survey of 7,000 executives, fell to 107.4 this month from 107.7
in September. That compared with a median forecast of 108 in a
 Bloomberg News survey  of 39 economists.  U.S. Economy  U.S.  durable-goods  orders rose by the most in three months
in September. Bookings increased 3.7 percent after a revised 0.2
percent gain in August, the Commerce Department said. The median
forecast of 67 economists surveyed by Bloomberg called for a 2.3
percent advance.  ElringKlinger tumbled 9.8 percent to 31.32 euros, the
largest drop since March 8. The company reported third-quarter
earnings before interest and taxes of 35.1 million euros ($48.5
million), missing estimates of 39.4 million euros.  Wacker Chemie,  Europe ’s largest polysilicon maker, dropped
4.4 percent to 69.90 euros, the lowest since July. Macquarie
downgraded the company to neutral from outperform after the
shares exceeded its price estimate.  BASF rose 1.3 percent to 75.17 euros, a fourth day of
gains. Third-quarter earnings before interest, taxes and one-time items jumped 15 percent to 1.69 billion euros, beating the
average analyst estimate of 1.62 billion euros, according to a
statement today.  The volume of shares changing hands in DAX-listed companies
was 23 percent lower than the average of the last 30 days,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
