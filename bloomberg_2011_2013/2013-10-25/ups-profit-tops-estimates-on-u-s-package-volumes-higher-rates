United Parcel Service Inc. (UPS) , the
world’s largest-package delivery company, posted third-quarter
earnings that beat analysts’ estimates after carrying more U.S.
shipments at higher rates.  Net income more than doubled to $1.1 billion, or $1.16 a
share, from $469 million, or 48 cents, a year earlier, the
Atlanta-based company said today in a statement. The average of
26  estimates  compiled by Bloomberg was $1.15. Revenue rose 3.4
percent to $13.5 billion, trailing the $13.6 billion average of
analysts’ estimates.  UPS said  revenue  from each domestic parcel rose 1 percent
and daily package volume was up 2.3 percent. UPS and rival  FedEx
Corp. (FDX)  are considered economic bellwethers because of the variety
of goods they ship around the world.  The shares  increased  as much as 3.6 percent to $97.90 in
early trading. The stock climbed 28 percent this year before
today, topping the 23 percent advance for the Standard & Poor’s
500 Index while trailing the 43 percent gain for FedEx, the
operator of the world’s largest cargo airline.  To contact the reporter on this story:
