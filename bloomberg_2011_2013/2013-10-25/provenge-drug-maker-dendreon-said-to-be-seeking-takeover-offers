Dendreon Corp. (DNDN) , the drugmaker whose market value has shrunk by more than half since August, is seeking a buyer after sales of its prostate-cancer treatment failed to meet expectations, said people familiar with the matter.  Dendreon, the maker of Provenge, is working with  JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM)  to find suitors, said one of the people, who asked not to be named as the process is private. The company, whose market value once topped $7 billion, has generated about $2 billion in  losses  over the past decade. That market capitalization now hovers at about $400 million.  Dendreon said in early August that sales of Provenge, its sole marketed product, wouldnâ€™t increase this year as forecast. When the treatment won approval in 2010, analysts projected the drug could generate $4.3 billion in sales by 2020. Today the estimate for that period has shrunk to $476.5 million.  Dendreon, led by Chairman and Chief Executive Officer John Johnson, has burned through money for at least six straight quarters. Cash and short-term investments had dropped to $207.4 million as of June from $538.6 million at the end of 2011.  Andy Brimmer, a spokesman for Seattle-based Dendreon with Joele Frank Wilkinson Brimmer Katcher, yesterday declined to comment on any sale process. A JPMorgan spokeswoman also declined to comment.  Dendreon advanced 5 percent yesterday to close at $2.53 in New York.
