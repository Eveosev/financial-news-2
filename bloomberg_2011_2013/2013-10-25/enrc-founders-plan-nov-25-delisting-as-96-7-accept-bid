Eurasian Natural Resources Corp. (ENRC) ’s
founders gained acceptances from 96.7 percent of shareholders
for their offer to acquire the ferrochrome producer and will
seek to take it private on Nov. 25.  Eurasian Resources Group BV, owner of 53.88 percent of
ENRC, had approval from 42.86 percent of shareholders as of
yesterday, it said in a statement. That includes the 26 percent
stake  Kazakhmys Plc (KAZ)  owns in ENRC.  Eurasian Resources, set up by  Alexander Machkevitch , Patokh Chodiev and Alijan Ibragimov, offered, along with the Kazakh
government, $2.65 in cash and 0.23 of a Kazakhmys share for each
one in ENRC in June. The bid, which the buyers said was equal to
234.3 pence a share, compares with the 540-pence ENRC stock was
sold at in an initial public offering in London in 2007.  “All conditions relating to the offer have either been
satisfied or waived,” the bidding group said today. “The offer
is declared unconditional in all respects.” It remains open to
acceptances from the outstanding shareholders.  ENRC advanced 1.5 percent to 224.2 pence as of 12:40 p.m.
in London, valuing the company at 2.88 billion pounds ($4.7
billion).  ENRC will apply for delisting from the  London  Stock
Exchange on Oct. 28 and to take the company private 20 business
days later, according to today’s statement. ENRC will also end
trading on the Kazakhstan Stock Exchange.  The metals producer traces its roots to the founders’
participation in the 1990s privatizations of Kazakh state
assets, gradually combined into a single group of companies and
listed in London in 2007. The company is under investigation by
the U.K.’s Serious Fraud Office over allegations of fraud,
bribery and corruption at its operations in Kazakhstan and
 Africa .  To contact the reporter on this story:
