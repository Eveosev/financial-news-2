CEZ AS, the  Czech Republic ’s largest
power producer, fell in Prague after former Chief Executive
Officer Martin Roman resigned as supervisory chairman during the
snap parliamentary election.  The shares fell as much as 0.8 percent to 510 koruna in
Prague after Roman, who oversaw years of CEZ’s expansion in
eastern  Europe , announced his resignation from the board. Roman
was replaced as CEO by Daniel Benes two years ago.  During more than seven years at the company’s helm, Roman
guided CEZ into other eastern European countries and began
preparations for the expansion of the Temelin nuclear power
station at home. Some of CEZ’s forays abroad backfired when
Albania revoked the company’s license and Bulgaria threatened to
do the same this year. Roman has also come under scrutiny from
media and anti-corruption police after confirming in 2011 he had
ties with companies that indirectly owned engineering group
Skoda Holding, which CEZ had awarded contracts.  “I decided to leave when there would be no political
pressure,” Roman said in an e-mailed statement, alluding to the
elections. “I don’t want my purely personal decision to be
connected with political influence from either side.”  Czech anti-corruption police said last year they were
looking for ties between Roman and Skoda on suspicion he used
his position to award it orders, Hospodarske Noviny reported.
Roman has repeatedly denied the allegations.  To contact the reporter on this story:
