Ping An Insurance (Group) Co. (2318) ,
 China ’s second-largest insurer, said profit more than doubled in
the third quarter as a stock-market rally boosted investment
returns and revenue from its banking unit expanded.  Net income  surged to 5.43 billion  yuan  ($893 million), or
0.69 yuan a share, from 2.13 billion yuan, or 0.27 yuan a share,
a year earlier, the Shenzhen-based company said in a statement
to the Shanghai stock exchange.  The benchmark  Shanghai Composite Index (SHCOMP)  climbed 9.9 percent
in the three months ended Sept. 30, as China’s economic growth
 accelerated  for the first time in three quarters, boosting the
value of Ping An’s equity holdings. Net income at unit Ping An
Bank Co. jumped 19.8 percent to 4.2 billion yuan in the quarter
as loans expanded and margins improved, the lender said Oct. 22.  Investment income was 14.2 billion yuan, the insurer said.
Impairment losses from investments, which more than doubled last
year, were 2.12 billion yuan in the third quarter, according to
the statement. Net premiums earned were 53.2 billion yuan, Ping
An said.  Third-quarter profits at Chinese insurers traded on
mainland exchanges may have grown by an average 80 percent
because of a low base from a year earlier and the stock-market
rally that offsets fair-value losses on their portfolios, Guotai
Junan Securities Co.’s Shanghai-based analyst Peng Yulong wrote
in an Oct. 20 report.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
