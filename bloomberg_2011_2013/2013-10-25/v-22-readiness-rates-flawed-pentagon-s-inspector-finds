U.S. Marine Corps personnel
improperly recorded data used to measure the combat readiness
rate of the MV-22 Osprey made by  Textron Inc. (TXT)  and  Boeing Co. (BA)  in
the three years ending in 2011, according to the Pentagon’s
inspector general.  Maintenance personnel “improperly recorded MV-22 aircraft
status information 167 of 200 times on aircraft inventory
reports” and “did not adequately prepare 112 of 907 work
orders that we reviewed,” the watchdog agency said in a  summary 
posted online today from a classified report.  While the period coincides with the tilt-rotor aircraft’s
deployments to Iraq and  Afghanistan , the summary doesn’t
identify the location of the aircraft for which the inaccurate
readiness ratings were compiled.  “Squadron commanders submitted incomplete or inaccurate
readiness reports” for six squadrons, according to the summary.
“As a result, the mission capability rates were unreliable,”
and senior  Department of Defense  and Marine Corps officials
“could have deployed MV-22 squadrons that were not prepared for
missions.”  The inaccurate ratings “occurred because MV-22 squadron
commanders did not adequately train MV-22 maintenance personnel
to prepare aircraft inventory reports and work orders nor MV-22
operations personnel on readiness reports” and “verify the
accuracy of aircraft inventory reports, work orders, and
readiness reports,” according to the summary.  To contact the reporter on this story:
