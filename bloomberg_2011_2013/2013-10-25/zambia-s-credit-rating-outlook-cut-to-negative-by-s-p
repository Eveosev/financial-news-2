Standard & Poor’s cut its credit
rating outlook for Zambia,  Africa ’s biggest copper producer, to
negative, saying growth in the government’s planned spending for
next year will boost debt.  The ratings agency affirmed its ’B+’ long-term and ’B’
short-term ratings for government debt, saying there was a more
than one-in-three chance it could downgrade if the country’s
financial situation deteriorated.  “We believe that the government, elected two years ago, is
adopting this expansionary fiscal stance just as it faces
decreasing support, given the economy’s failure to generate
sufficient job opportunities,” Standard & Poor’s analysts
including Marie-France Raynaud wrote in a note today.  Zambian Finance Minister Alexander Chikwanda on Oct. 11
announced a 33 percent increase in spending for 2014, saying the
budget deficit will grow to 8.5 percent this year, nearly double
what had been planned. The country is trying to speed
development by spending billions of dollars on roads, hospitals
and schools.  Government debt will reach about 35% of gross domestic
product by 2016 compared to 19 percent last year, even if  Zambia 
meets its revenue targets, Standard & Poor’s said. The budget
deficit will be 7.6 percent next year, higher than the 6.6
percent Chikwanda is planning for, the ratings agency said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
