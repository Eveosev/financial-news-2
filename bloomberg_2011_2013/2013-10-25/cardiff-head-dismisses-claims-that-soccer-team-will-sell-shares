Cardiff City Chairman Mehmet Dalman
today dismissed newspaper reports that the Premier League soccer
team is planning a stock exchange listing next year.  The Wales-based team, playing in  England ’s top flight this
season for the first time since 1962, is owned by Malaysian
Vincent Tan, and yesterday  Singapore ’s Straits Times reported
the owner was mulling floating the club in the second half of
2014.  “I wouldn’t believe everything you read,” Dalman said in
a telephone interview. “There’s absolutely no basis to it. It’s
not on my agenda.”  Dalman, a former board member of Commerzbank AG who was
named Cardiff chairman in July, said he could see the rationale
behind a listing but “I just don’t see any need.”  The team would be listed on either the  Malaysian or
Singaporean exchanges, the newspaper said.  At the start of the season, the Bluebirds were rated third
favorites by bookmakers Ladbrokes, William Hill and Paddy Power
to return to the second-division Championship. After eight
games, Cardiff is 17th out of 20 teams, though it’s only three
points behind last season’s champion  Manchester United  in
eighth.  Cardiff’s arrival coincided with the start of the Premier
League’s new television contract, the richest in soccer, which
guarantees the lowest-ranked of the division’s 20 clubs about 60
million pounds ($97 million).  Most Premier League teams are privately held.  Manchester
United (MANU)  raised $233.3 million in a U.S. initial public offering
last year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
