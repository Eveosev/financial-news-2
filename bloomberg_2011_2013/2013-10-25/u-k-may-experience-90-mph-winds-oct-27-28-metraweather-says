Southern  England  is girding for 90
mile-per-hour winds as the  biggest storm  since 1990 is forecast
to fell trees and damage buildings.  Rain and high winds are predicted to lash the area on the
evening of Oct. 27 through to the morning of Oct. 28 as a
depression moves in from the Atlantic Ocean, Reading, England-based forecaster MetraWeather said in an e-mail. Sustained wind
speeds will probably be more than 45mph, while localized
flooding should be expected, particularly in parts of  Wales  and
western England where the ground has become saturated over the
past week by heavy rainfall, it said.  The weather system may be the worst since the  Burns’ Day
storm  of Jan. 25-26, 1990, which killed 47 people and had winds
of more than 80 mph, according to the U.K.  Met Office . The gusts
may lead to shutdowns at turbines including those at The  London
Array , the world’s biggest offshore wind park, which
automatically halt when wind speeds exceed 56 mph.  “The most comparable event is the 1990 Burns’ Day storm,”
Nicola Maxey, a spokeswoman for the Met Office in Exeter, said
by phone today. “This storm is likely to peak in the morning
when most people are in bed, so the impact on people should be
less than in 1990, which happened in the daytime.”  Gusts around the  London  Array are forecast at about 130
kilometers per hour (81 mph), Barrie Englishby, a production
manager at the project in the sea East of London, said today in
an e-mail. Structurally, the turbines and offshore sub-stations
are designed to withstand conditions “far in excess” of those
forecast, he said.  London Array  The London Array is owned by EON SE, Dong Energy A/S and
Masdar Abu Dhabi Future Energy Co. It has 175  Siemens AG (SIE) 
turbines with a total capacity of 630 megawatts, enough to power
almost half a million U.K. homes, according to its  website .  Wind power generation will peak at 5,501 megawatts on Oct.
27 and 4,214 megawatts on Oct. 28, up from a maximum of 3,667
megawatts today, according to Bloomberg’s wind supply model. It
rose to a  record  5,773 megawatts on Sept. 15, according to
National Grid Plc data.  While the storm is most likely to cut across southern
England, there is a moderate probability that it will track
across the midlands and the north of England and a low
probability it will miss the English mainland to the south, the
Met Office said yesterday.  Sustained winds of 74-95 mph constitute a Category 1
hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson scale, one level above a
tropical storm.  U.K. farm income dropped 14 percent last year as the
second-wettest weather on record reduced harvests and costs
climbed, according to government data. Summer 2013 was the
driest since 2006 and the 16th driest since 1910, Met Office
data show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
