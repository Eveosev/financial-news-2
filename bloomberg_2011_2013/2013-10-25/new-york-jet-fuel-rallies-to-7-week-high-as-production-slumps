Jet fuel in  New York  harbor
strengthened to a seven-week high as production slumped to the
 lowest level  since 2012, drawing stockpiles lower in the region.  No. 54 jet fuel  gained 0.5 cent to 4.13 cents a gallon
below ultra-low-sulfur diesel futures on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange  at 9:06 a.m., the smallest discount since Sept. 4,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Production of the fuel on the U.S. East Coast, known as
PADD 1, fell for a third consecutive week to  40,000 barrels a
day , the smallest amount since Nov. 9, according to U.S. Energy
information Administration data. Stockpiles of the fuel in the
area fell 728,000 barrels to 10.7 million during the week ended
Oct. 18, the lowest level since Aug. 16, EIA data showed.  Delta Air Lines Inc. (DAL) ’s 185,000-barrel-a-day Trainer
refinery in  Pennsylvania  is carrying out a project that will
increase output of jet fuel to 50,000 barrels a day, from 20,000
to 30,000 barrels currently, according to a person familiar with
operations, who asked not to be identified because the
information isn’t public. The refinery expected to produce about
40,000 barrels a day by the end of the year.  Reformulated, 84-octane gasoline, or RBOB in New York
Harbor, was unchanged at 1.25 cents a gallon above Nymex
futures, while  ultra-low-sulfur diesel  dropped 0.08 cent to a
0.05-cent premium.  The 3-2-1 crack spread in New York, based on Brent oil in
 Europe , dropped 56 cents to $5.82 a barrel, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
