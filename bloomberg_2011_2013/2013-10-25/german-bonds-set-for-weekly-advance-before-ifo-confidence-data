Italy ’s bonds fell for a third day
as an industry report showing German business confidence
unexpectedly worsened this month damped demand for the euro
area’s higher-yielding government securities.  The extra yield investors demand to hold Italy’s 10-year
debt instead of similar-maturity German bunds expanded to the
widest in two weeks after data yesterday showed  consumer
confidence  in Italy also declined. Italian notes dropped before
the nation sells as much as 2.25 billion euros ($3.1 billion) of
two-year securities next week. Spanish bonds declined for a
second day. Benchmark German bunds were little changed.  “After months of positive data, optimism is waning a bit
this week as the latest figures suggested that the pace of
recovery is going to be slow,” said  Michael Leister , a senior
fixed-income strategist at Commerzbank AG in  London . “That
provides a good reason to take profits on Italian and Spanish
bonds after their strong rally.”  Italy’s 10-year yield climbed six basis points, or 0.06
percentage point, to 4.22 percent at 4:29 p.m. London time after
rising to 4.24 percent, the  highest  since Oct. 17. The 4.5
percent bond due in March 2024 dropped 0.53, or 5.30 euros per
1,000-euro face amount, to 102.72. The two-year note yield
increased 10 basis points to 1.58 percent.  The extra yield on the 10-year securities over similar-maturity bunds expanded eight basis points to 246 basis points
after reaching 248 basis points, the widest since Oct. 11.  German Confidence  The Ifo institute’s index of  Germany ’s  business climate ,
based on a survey of 7,000 executives, fell to 107.4 from 107.7
in September. That compares with a median forecast of 108 in a
 Bloomberg News survey  of economists. Reports yesterday showed
Italian consumer confidence declined in October and euro-area
services and manufacturing grew less than analysts forecast.  Citigroup Inc.’s Economic Surprise Index for the euro
region dropped for an eighth day, sliding to 4.3, the lowest
since July. The gauge, which shows whether data beat or fell
short of economists’ forecasts, reached a five-month high of
55.8 on Aug. 30.  Italy’s Treasury will sell two-year zero-coupon notes on
Oct. 28, as much as 750 million euros of inflation-linked bonds
the same day, as well as bills on Oct. 29 and bonds on Oct. 30.  Volatility on Italian bonds was the highest in euro-area
markets today, followed by those of  Spain  and  Finland , according
to measures of 10-year debt, the yield spread between two- and
10-year securities and credit-default swaps.  Spain, Germany  Spanish  10-year yields  rose two basis points to 4.16
percent, while the two-year rate increased six basis points to
1.64 percent.  Germany’s 10-year yield was at 1.75 percent after falling
as much as two basis points.  “Perhaps the economic recovery might not be as solid as
some in the market hoped for,” said Lyn Graham-Taylor, a fixed-income strategist at Rabobank International in London. “The Ifo
supports that economic story. That perhaps helped to support
German bunds.”  Italian bonds returned 6.4 percent this year through
yesterday, according to Bloomberg World Bond Indexes. Spain’s
returned 10 percent, while Germany’s lost 1.5 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
