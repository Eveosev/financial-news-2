Healthways Inc. (HWAY) , a provider of
health-care programs for employers, dropped the most in two
years after lowering its 2013 forecast on third-quarter profit
that missed analysts’ estimates.  Healthways sank 29 percent to $11.72 at 10:42 a.m.  New York 
time, after falling to $11.25 in the biggest intraday decline
since Oct. 25, 2011. The shares had gained 55 percent this year
through yesterday.  Full-year revenue will be $665 million to $675 million,
with a net loss of as much as 10 cents a share, Franklin,
Tennessee-based Healthways said yesterday in a statement after
the markets closed. That compares with a July  forecast  of as
much as $750 million in revenue and earnings of 18 cents to 28
cents a share.  Third-quarter net income dropped 64 percent to $1.8
million, or 5 cents a share, missing the 12-cent average
 estimate  of eight analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. Fewer people
than expected participated in Healthways’ wellness programs, the
company said.  “Actual contracts are growing, but the adoption at the
health system and Healthways level are growing slower than
expected,” Thomas Carroll, an analyst with  Stifel Nicolaus (SF) ,
wrote in a research note today. “We are disappointed in the
magnitude of the revision but -- gulp -- continue to like
Healthways as a small cap health-care idea as new contracts
mature.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
