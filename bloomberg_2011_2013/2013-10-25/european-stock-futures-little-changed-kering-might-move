European stocks  were little changed,
with the Stoxx Europe 600 Index posting a third weekly advance,
as companies from Kering SA to  Renault (RNO)  SA reported sales that
missed projections, offsetting gains in BASF SE.  Kering slid 3 percent after its Gucci brand posted the
worst sales growth in four years as demand waned in  China .
Renault slipped 3.2 percent after the French carmaker said
weaker emerging-market currencies cut third-quarter revenue.
Telecom Italia SpA slumped 6.4 percent as people familiar with
the matter said the company may seek to raise as much as 2
billion euros ($2.8 billion) of new capital. BASF rose 1.3
percent after posting better-than-forecast earnings.  The Stoxx 600 slipped 0.1 percent to 320.09 at the close of
trading. The gauge still climbed 0.5 percent this week as
companies from Daimler AG to Royal Philips NV posted results
that beat analysts’ estimates. The benchmark has gained 14
percent in 2013 as central banks around the world pledged to
leave  interest rates  low for a prolonged period.  “We still haven’t seen confirmation that earnings will
accelerate into 2014,” said Lars Kreckel, a London-based global
equity strategist at Legal & General Investment Management,
which oversees about $702 billion. “Investors are willing to be
a little patient if the base case for earnings growth gets
pushed out into the next quarter, but the real risk is that you
start to worry about an earnings decline.”  Analysts predict earnings for Stoxx 600 members will drop
2.4 percent this year and increase 13 percent in 2014, according
to estimates compiled by  Bloomberg News  this month.  U.S. Data  Data from the U.S. Commerce Department today showed orders
for  durable goods  increased 3.7 percent in September after a
revised 0.2 percent advance in the prior month, as stronger
demand for commercial and military aircraft outweighed a drop in
business equipment. The median estimate compiled by Bloomberg
was for a 2.3 percent gain.  National benchmark indexes fell in 12 of the 18 Western-European markets. The U.K’s FTSE 100 and  Germany ’s DAX Index
each added 0.1 percent.  France ’s CAC 40 dropped 0.1 percent.  Kering (KER)  retreated 3 percent to 167.40 euros after the
luxury-goods maker said third-quarter sales from continuing
operations fell to 2.52 billion euros. Analysts predicted 2.55
billion euros, according to the median estimate compiled by
Bloomberg. Gucci’s sales rose 0.6 percent, less than projections
for 2.1 percent growth, and the weakest performance since the
third quarter of 2009.  Renault declined 3.2 percent to 66.11 euros. Sales fell 3.2
percent to 8 billion euros from a restated 8.26 billion euros a
year earlier, the French company said late yesterday. Revenue
was less than the 8.5 billion-euro  average  of six analyst
estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  Currency Impact  Shifts in the Russian ruble, Argentinian peso, Brazilian
real and Indian rupee reduced automotive revenue by 5.7
percentage points in the quarter. That amounted to 439 million
euros, Chief Financial Officer Dominique Thormann said yesterday
on a conference call with journalists.  An index of European carmakers, the best-performing
 industry group  on the Stoxx 600 this year, fell 0.7 percent
after closing at a record yesterday.  Volvo AB (VOLVB) , the world’s second-largest truckmaker, dropped
6.6 percent to 88.10 kronor, its biggest decline in more than
two years, after saying that the strength of the krona and new-vehicle investments ate into profit. Earnings before interest
and taxes decreased 18 percent to 2.4 billion kronor ($379
million) from 2.92 billion kronor a year earlier, missing the
3.15 billion-krona average  estimate  compiled by Bloomberg.  Telecom Italia  Telecom Italia tumbled 6.4 percent to 67.2 euro cents. The
phone company may propose the 1.5 billion euros to 2 billion
euros capital increase at its Nov. 7 board meeting, according to
three people with knowledge of the matter, who asked not to be
identified because the deliberations are private.  Schneider Electric SA slipped 1.1 percent to 62.58 euros.
The world’s biggest maker of low- and medium-voltage equipment
cut its 2013 profit and revenue forecasts because of the
strength of the euro. The decline of emerging-market currencies
will crimp its margins by 0.3 to 0.5 percentage points.
Schneider had earlier forecast that margins would not narrow.  Electrolux AB (ELUXB)  tumbled 5.8 percent to 162.80 kronor, its
biggest decline since Feb. 1, after the maker of ovens and
dishwashers posted quarterly profit that missed estimates.
Electrolux will also take 3.4 billion kronor in charges in the
fourth quarter and 2014 as it cuts costs and 2,000 jobs.  BASF Advances  BASF, the world’s largest chemical maker, rose 1.3 percent
to 75.17 euros. Third-quarter Ebit excluding one-time items
jumped 15 percent to 1.69 billion euros, beating the average
analyst estimate of 1.62 billion euros, according to a statement
today.  MorphoSys AG climbed 2.2 percent to 56.95 euros. Ebit for
this year may rise to as much as 10 million euros from last
year’s 2.5 million euros because of the lower-than-anticipated
cost of developing its MOR202 cancer treatment with U.S. partner
Celgene Corp. The German biotechnology company had previously
predicted profit wouldn’t exceed 6 million euros.  Software AG rallied 4.8 percent to 28.14 euros, for its
biggest two-day gain in a year, after saying it will  buy back  as
much as 110 million euros of shares until May 16 2014.  To contact the reporter on this story:
