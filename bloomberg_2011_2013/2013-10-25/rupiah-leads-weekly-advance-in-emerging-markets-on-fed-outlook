Indonesia ’s rupiah led advances in
emerging-market currencies this week on speculation the  Federal
Reserve  will delay cutting stimulus. Government bonds rallied,
pushing the 10-year yield to a three-month low.  The rupiah headed for its best five-day gain since June
2009 after global funds bought more local stocks than they sold
this week through yesterday, the first net inflow in a month.
The Fed will postpone a plan to pare its $85 billion a month of
bond buying to March, an Oct. 17-18 Bloomberg survey showed,
instead of December as predicted by a similar poll last month.  “We will probably see a further reprieve for the rupiah
over the next one to two months as the market has pushed their
expectation for Fed tapering into next year,” said Khoon Goh, a
senior foreign-exchange strategist at Australia & New Zealand
Banking Group Ltd. in  Singapore . Demand for emerging-market
assets has improved as international “investors are looking for
some additional yield to tide them over,” he said.  The rupiah strengthened 2.2 percent since Oct. 18 to 11,078
per dollar as of 9:48 a.m. in Jakarta, beating all 24 emerging-market currencies tracked by Bloomberg, prices from local banks
show. One-month non-deliverable forwards rose 0.1 percent to
10,948, 1.2 percent stronger than the spot rate, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. The onshore spot rate rallied 0.7
percent today while the offshore contracts were little changed.  One-month implied volatility, a measure of expected moves
in the  exchange rate  used to price options, fell 139 basis
points this week to 12.91 percent, data compiled by Bloomberg
show. A  fixing  used to settle the forwards was set at 10,858 per
dollar yesterday, compared with 10,866 on Oct. 18, according to
the Association of Banks in Singapore.  Government Bonds  The yield on Indonesia’s 5.625 percent bonds due May 2023
dropped 30 basis points, or 0.30 percentage point, this week to
7.16 percent, the lowest level since July 23, prices from the
Inter Dealer Market Association show. The cost to insure the
nation’s debt against non-payment using five-year credit-default
swaps fell nine basis points from Oct. 18 to 188 yesterday, the
least since June 6, according to data provider CMA.  Overseas funds added 4.62 trillion rupiah ($414 million) to
sovereign  debt holdings  through Oct. 23, official data show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
