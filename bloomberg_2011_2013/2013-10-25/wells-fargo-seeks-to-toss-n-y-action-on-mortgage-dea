Wells Fargo & Co. (WFC)  said New York’s
bid for a court order forcing the bank to comply with a
mortgage-servicing settlement should be denied because the state
is ignoring terms of the $25 billion agreement.  New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman is attempting
to make an “end-run” around the mechanism for testing whether
banks are complying with the settlement and for fixing
violations, Wells Fargo said in a filing today in federal court
in Washington.  “The entire agreed-upon enforcement process -- which was
precisely intended to avoid costly litigation -- would be
rendered a nullity” if the state’s claims are allowed to
proceed, the lender said.  Schneiderman claims San Francisco-based Wells Fargo
violated the 2012 settlement by subjecting homeowners to delays
and obstructions in the process for modifying  mortgage loans .
Wells Fargo was among five mortgage servicers that reached the
agreement with the U.S. and 49 states.  The case is U.S. v. Bank of America Corp., 12-cv-00361,
U.S. District Court,  District of Columbia  (Washington).  To contact the reporter on this story:
