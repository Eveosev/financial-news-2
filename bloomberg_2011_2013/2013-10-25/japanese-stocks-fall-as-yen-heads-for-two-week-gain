Japanese  stocks  fell, with the  Topix (TPX) 
index slumping the most in more than two months, as the yen
extended gains against the dollar and exporters slid.  Toyota Motor Corp. (7203) , Asia’s largest car manufacturer, fell
2.1 percent.  SoftBank (9984)  Corp., a mobile-phone company, lost 4.8
percent after a report Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. abandoned
plans for an initial public offering in the near term. SoftBank
said in July it holds a stake of about 37 percent in Alibaba.
Canon Inc., the world’s biggest camera maker, slipped 1.6
percent after cutting its profit forecast. JFE Holdings Inc.,
 Japan ’s second-biggest steelmaker, slumped 4.2 percent after its
net-income outlook missed estimates.  The Topix dropped 2.1 percent to 1,178.28 at the close in
Tokyo, its biggest decline since Aug. 7, with all 33 subsectors
sliding. The gauge fell 2.3 percent this week. The Nikkei 225
Stock Average sank 2.8 percent to 14,088.19, with just five
companies rising. Nikkei 225 futures traded in Osaka slumped 2.5
percent. The yen touched a two-week high against the dollar.  “Short-term traders like hedge funds are adjusting their
positions and that’s impacting the market,” said  Tsutomu Yamada , a market analyst at Kabu.com Securities Co. “Futures
led the cash market lower, the yen’s gain followed and that
caused a further drop in shares.”  The Topix has lost 1.3 percent this month, trailing all its
23 developed-market peers. Japanese shares are still the best
performers this year among the markets amid optimism Prime
Minister Shinzo Abe’s policies and unprecedented monetary easing
from the Bank of Japan will lead the country out of deflation.  Consumer prices excluding fresh food in the nation rose 0.7
percent from a year earlier last month, meeting the median
estimate of economists surveyed by Bloomberg. Stripping out
energy costs as well, prices were unchanged from a year ago,
ending four years of declines and signaling progress in the
prime minister’s campaign to overcome deflation.  Exporters Tumble  Exporters declined as the yen advanced. Toyota fell 2.1
percent to 6,200 yen.  Bridgestone Corp. (5108) , a tiremaker that gets
43 percent of revenue in the Americas, lost 2.3 percent to 3,365
yen. Sony Corp., a TV maker that gets 16 percent of its sales in
the U.S., slipped 1.1 percent to 1,851 yen.  SoftBank slid 4.8 percent to 7,400 yen, the most on the
Nikkei 225, after the South China Morning Post reported that
Alibaba has abandoned plans to sell shares in the near term. The
Chinese company aims to “let the heat die down over its
controversial share-structure proposal,” the newspaper
reported, citing chief executive Jonathan Lu Zhaoxi.  About 630 companies on the 1,744-member Topix report
 results  from today through Nov. 1, with earnings season peaking
next week, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Profit per
share for companies on the gauge is  expected  to increase 56
percent from the previous quarter, according to analyst
estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  JFE Slides  JFE slumped 4.2 percent to 2,350 yen after saying it
expects full-year net income of 95 billion yen, below the
average estimate of 131.3 billion yen of 19 analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg. The company forecast operating profit of 155 billion
yen, while analysts expected 211.2 billion yen.  Canon lost 1.6 percent to 3,080 yen after saying yesterday
that net income will probably total 240 billion yen ($2.5
billion) for the year ending December, cutting its earlier
forecast of 260 billion yen. The new projection missed the 250.8
billion-yen average of 21 analyst estimates compiled by
Bloomberg.  “Canon’s earnings are drawing attention, causing
speculators to sell stocks,” said  Soichiro Monji , chief
strategist at Tokyo-based Daiwa SB Investments Ltd., which
manages the equivalent of 4.94 trillion yen. “Canon is bad, but
I think overall earnings are rather good. As we see more results
come out next week, I think stocks will rise.”  Higher Forecast  Among stocks that rose, Mitsubishi Motors Corp. gained 1.2
percent to 1,036 yen, the most on the Nikkei 225. The automaker
raised its full-year net-income forecast by 40 percent to 70
billion yen.  Murata Manufacturing Co., a maker of electronic components,
added 2.2 percent to 7,760 yen after reporting preliminary
first-half net income of 47 billion yen, exceeding its forecast
of 33 billion yen. The company’s final results are due Oct. 31.  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index slipped 0.3
percent today. The equity gauge added 0.3 percent in New York
yesterday as corporate earnings beat estimates and signs of
slower economic growth fueled bets the Federal Reserve will
maintain stimulus.  The Topix  traded  at 1.23 times book value today, compared
with 2.56 for the S&P 500 and 1.8 for the Stoxx Europe 600 Index
yesterday. The Japanese gauge’s 30-day historic volatility was
at 16.2 today after falling to its lowest since January
