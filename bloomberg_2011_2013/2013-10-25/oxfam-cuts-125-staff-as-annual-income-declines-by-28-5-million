Oxfam, the Oxford, England-based
development charity, is to cut 125 jobs and work in fewer
countries after it saw its income fall to 367.9 million pounds
($595 million) in 2012-13 compared with 385.5 million pounds a
year earlier.  Voluntary donations to the charity, which works to overcome
poverty in 94 countries, fell to 111.5 million pounds from 129.7
million pounds in the same period, according to its  accounts .  “It is imperative that we have an Oxfam which lives within
its means and is relevant to 21st-century needs,” Chief
Executive Officer Mark Goldring said in a  statement  posted on
the charity’s website. “Advances in technology mean we no
longer need as much support in head office. Instead our
resources will be focused in the regions where we carry out the
majority of our work.”  The 125 posts will be cut in the U.K. and some regional
offices will be closed, the charity said. It will then start to
reorganize its work outside the U.K. and focus on the poorest
countries where its 5,300 staff work.  To contact the reporter on this story:
