Cam Newton ran for a touchdown and
passed for two more as the  Carolina Panthers  won 31-13 to leave
the  Tampa Bay  Buccaneers winless through seven National Football
League games for the second time in five years.  Last night’s victory at Raymond James Stadium in Tampa Bay
lifted the Panthers to 4-3, the first time they’ve been above
.500 since they went 12-4 in 2008. The Buccaneers are tied with
their nearest NFL neighbor, the  Jacksonville Jaguars , for the
worst record in the league.  Panthers quarterback Newton threw a one-yard touchdown pass
to Greg Olsen and  DeAngelo Williams  ran for a 12-yard score in
the first half, while Tampa Bay got field goals of 47 and 48
yards from Rian Lindell to trail 14-6.  Newton got the only score of the third quarter on a six-yard sprint for a touchdown and threw a three-yard scoring pass
to Mike Tolbert on the first play of the fourth quarter to make
it 28-6 for the Panthers. Graham Gano added a 29-yard field goal
for Carolina.  The Buccaneers got their only touchdown of the game with
three minutes remaining on a 10-yard pass to Tim Wright by
quarterback Mike Glennon.  To contact the reporter on this story:
