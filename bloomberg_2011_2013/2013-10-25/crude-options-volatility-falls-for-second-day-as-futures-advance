Crude options volatility fell for
the second day in a row as the underlying futures rose.  Implied volatility for at-the-money December options, a
measure of expected futures swings and a key gauge of value, was
18.81 percent at 4:20 p.m. on the  New York Mercantile Exchange ,
down from 20.6 percent yesterday.  West Texas Intermediate crude for December delivery
advanced 74 cents to settle at $97.85 a barrel on the Nymex.  Puts, or bets that prices would fall, accounted for the
three most popular options and 64 percent of electronic trading
volume today.  The most active options were December $90 puts, which slid
16 cents a barrel to 17 cents a barrel with 2,431 lots trading
as of 4:32 p.m. December $85 puts fell 5 cents to 5 cents a
barrel on volume of 2,254 lots.  In the previous session, puts accounted for 55 percent of
the 126,153 lots traded. December $95 puts were the most-active
options, with 6,167 contracts trading as they declined 19 cents
to $1.17 a barrel. December $100 calls were unchanged at 76
cents on volume of 4,949 lots.  Open interest was highest yesterday for December $80 puts,
with 42,449 contracts. Next were December $90 puts with 40,481
lots and December $85 puts with 36,033.  The exchange distributes real-time data for electronic
trading and releases information the next business day on open-outcry volume, where the bulk of options activity occurs.  To contact the reporter on this story:
