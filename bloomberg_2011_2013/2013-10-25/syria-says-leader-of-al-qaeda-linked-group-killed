The leader of a  Syrian rebel group 
with links to al-Qaeda was killed in clashes near the
northwestern coastal city of Latakia, state television said.  The report of Abu Muhammad al-Jolani’s death, which didn’t
give further details, was denied by other leaders of his group,
the al-Nusra Front, according to the U.K.-based Syrian
Observatory for  Human Rights , which said it spoke to some of
them. The Observatory, which has ties with the more secular of
 Syria ’s rebel groups, said other al-Nusra members couldn’t
confirm or deny the report of al-Jolani’s death because they
hadn’t been able to contact him.  The al-Nusra Front, classified as a terrorist organization
by the U.S., is among several Islamist groups that have played a
growing role in the 2 1/2-year uprising against President Bashar al-Assad. The Islamists have frequently clashed with other rebel
forces, especially Kurds in the north, as well as fighting
against Assad’s army.  U.S. support for the Syrian opposition has been constrained
by concerns that military or financial aid may end up in the
hands of Islamist militants instead of the Western-backed
rebels.  Saudi Arabia , the main U.S. ally in the Arab world,
recently signaled that it may split with the U.S. by diverting
more aid to the Islamists, because they are disorganized and
ineffective.  Separately, the Observatory said a car bombing in a town
near Damascus today left 40 people dead. The Observatory
estimates that Syria’s civil war has killed more than 115,000
people since March 2011.  To contact the reporter on this story:
