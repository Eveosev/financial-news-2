The  Metropolitan Museum of Art  has
amended its 1878 lease with the city of  New York  to confirm its
discretionary admissions policy.  Since 1971, entry to the museum has been based on a pay-as-you-wish basis, with a current suggested $25 admission price for
adults. New York City first waived the free-admissions provision
of the museum’s original lease in 1970.  The amendment authorizes “admission modifications in
future years, subject as in the past to review and approval by
the city,” the museum said in a statement.  The change acknowledges municipal funding was “no longer
sufficient to allow the museum to operate without charging
admission fees,” it said.  The museum was sued in November for deceiving the public,
particularly tourists, about the “recommended” $25 admission
policy, saying it violated an 1893 state law requiring it be
open without charge five days a week.  To contact the reporter on this story:
