Indian stock-index futures dropped
after the benchmark index capped its longest losing streak in
two months yesterday.  SGX CNX Nifty Index futures  for October delivery fell 0.8
percent to 6,138.5 at 10:10 a.m. in Singapore. The underlying
CNX  Nifty (NIFTY)  Index dropped 0.2 percent to 6,164.35 yesterday. The
S&P BSE Sensex declined 0.2 percent, falling for a third day.
The Bank of  New York  Mellon India ADR Index of U.S.-traded
shares rose 0.5 percent.  The Sensex sank after briefly surpassing its record closing
high yesterday as traders pared positions before derivatives
contracts expire on Oct. 31. The  Reserve Bank  of India may
increase its benchmark  interest rate  by 25 basis points at a
policy meeting on Oct. 29 to tackle consumer-price  inflation 
that’s remained at more than 9 percent since March 2012,
according to 13 out of 17 economists surveyed by Bloomberg.  “Investors are cautious amid speculation that the central
bank may raise interest rates next week,” Kishor Ostwal,
managing director at CNI Research Ltd., said yesterday.
“Volatility is expected to remain high ahead of the derivatives
contract expiry next week.”  The rally in Indian stocks that drove the Sensex toward its
record will falter as higher interest rates curb economic
growth,  John Praveen , chief investment strategist at
Prudential International Investments Advisers LLC, which manages
about $1 trillion in assets globally, said in a interview with
Bloomberg TV India.  Earnings Reports  ICICI Bank Ltd. (ICICIBC) , the country’s second-biggest lender by
assets, may say today its second-quarter profit increased to
21.4 billion rupees ($348 million), according to the median
estimate of 43 analysts in a Bloomberg survey.  Net income at cigarette maker  ITC Ltd. (ITC)  may have increased
to 21.2 billion rupees in the quarter, according to the median
estimate of 31 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  GAIL India Ltd. (GAIL) , India’s biggest gas marketing company, may
report profit of 9.31 billion rupees, according to a Bloomberg
survey of 36 analysts.  Profits at all nine of the 30 Sensex companies that have
reported earnings so far for the three months ended Sept. 30
have beaten or matched estimates, compared with 47 percent that
missed projections in the previous quarter.  Deutsche Bank boosted its December target for the Sensex to
22,000 from 21,000 in a report dated yesterday, on the prospect
excessive investor pessimism may be receding. The bank upgraded
 Indian (SENSEX)  lenders to overweight and cut technology-service stocks
to neutral. The average estimate in a
Bloomberg survey of 11 forecasters fell to 19,409 this month
from 21,150 in July.  Global investors bought a net $104.9 million of stocks on
Oct. 23, a 14th day of purchases, data from the regulator show.
That took this year’s inflows to $15.3 billion, the second-highest after Japan among 10 Asian markets tracked by Bloomberg.  Overseas investors have bought $1.89 billion of local
shares this month, adding to inflows of $2 billion in September,
data from the market regulator show.  The Sensex has risen 6.9 percent this year and is  valued  at
14 times estimated 12-month profits, compared with the MSCI
 Emerging Markets  Index’s 10.7 times.  To contact the reporter on this story:
