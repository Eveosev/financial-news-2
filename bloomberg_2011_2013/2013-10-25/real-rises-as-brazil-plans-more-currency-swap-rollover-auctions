Brazil ’s real climbed after the
central bank said it will hold auctions over three days next
week to extend maturities on currency swaps that have supported
the world’s biggest two-month rally.  The real appreciated 0.7 percent to 2.1876 per U.S. dollar
at 10:11 a.m. in Sao Paulo, rising for the first time in three
days. The currency pared its first weekly decline in October to
0.9 percent. Swap rates on contracts maturing in January 2015
fell four basis points, or 0.04 percentage point, to 10.48
percent and are down three basis points for the week.  The currency has gained 11 percent since Aug. 22, when
policy makers announced a $60 billion program of swaps and
credit lines to buoy the currency and curb import price
increases. The rally from a 4 1/2-year low also boosts export
prices, making the country’s factories less competitive.  “Just after the central bank announced that it will
continue the rollovers, the market responded,” Joao Paulo de Gracia, a trader at Correparti Corretora de Cambio in Curitiba,
Brazil, said in a telephone interview. “The central bank
could roll over the whole remaining amount next week.”  The real was headed for a weekly decline as Finance
Minister Guido Mantega said that Brazil is reducing its
intervention in currency markets. The central bank rolled over
in auctions Oct. 22-24 about one-third of the $8.9 billion of
swap contracts maturing Nov. 1.  To contact the reporter on this story:
