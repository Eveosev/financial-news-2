Swiss stocks  declined from a five-month high as analysts downgraded stocks from  Adecco SA (ADEN)  to
 Credit Suisse Group AG (CSGN)  amid concern that potential for further
price gains is low.  Adecco, the world’s largest supplier of temporary workers,
dropped 2.8 percent after UBS AG recommended selling the shares.
Credit Suisse fell 2 percent after JPMorgan Chase & Co.
downgraded its rating for Switzerland’s second-biggest bank.  The  SMI (SMI)  slid 0.2 percent to 8,216 at 9:49 a.m. in Zurich.
The equity benchmark has climbed 2.4 percent so far in October
as U.S. lawmakers reached an agreement to reopen the partially
closed government and avoid a sovereign default. The broader
Swiss Performance Index also lost 0.2 percent today.  The volume of shares changing hands in SMI-listed companies
was 19 percent greater than the average of the past 30 days,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  In the U.S., a Commerce Department report at 8:30 a.m.  New
York  time may show that orders for durable goods increased 2.3
percent in September, after a 0.1 percent gain in the previous
month, according to the median estimate of 67 economists in a
Bloomberg News survey.  In  Germany , a report at 10 a.m. in Munich may show the Ifo
institute’s business climate index climbed to 108 this month
from 107.7 in September, according to the median forecast in a
Bloomberg News survey. That would be the highest level since
April 2012. A measure of expectations will also increase, while
a gauge of current conditions will remain unchanged, the survey
predicted.  To contact the reporter on this story:
