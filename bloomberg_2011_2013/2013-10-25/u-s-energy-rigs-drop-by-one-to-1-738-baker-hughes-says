Rigs targeting oil and natural gas
in the U.S. declined by one this week to 1,738, according to
 Baker Hughes Inc. (BHI)   Oil rigs  dropped four to 1,357, data posted on the
company’s website show. The  gas  count rose four to 376, the
Houston-based field services company said. Miscellaneous rigs
fell by one to five.  The  U.S. total count  has declined by 44 since Aug. 2 as
producers adopted new technologies to shorten drilling times and
boost well productivity in shale formations, weakening demand
for new equipment. The amount of crude produced per rig in the
U.S. has surged to a record in both  North Dakota ’s Bakken and
 Texas ’s Eagle Ford plays, according to the Energy Information
Administration.  “New technologies for drilling and producing natural gas
and oil have made traditional measures of productivity, such as
a simple count of active rotary drilling rigs, obsolete,” the
EIA, the U.S. Energy Department’s statistical arm, said in an
Oct. 22  report .  U.S. oil output rose to 7.9 million barrels a day in the
week ended Oct. 18, the highest since March 1989, data compiled
by the EIA show. Fracking and horizontal drilling boosted output
from shale formations, helping the U.S. met 87 percent of its
own energy needs in the first six months of 2013, on pace to be
the highest annual rate since 1986.  Oil  stockpiles  climbed 1.4 percent last week to 379.8
million barrels, the highest level for this season in at least
10 years.  Oil, Gas  West Texas Intermediate crude for December delivery
increased 64 cents, or 0.7 percent, to $97.75 a barrel at 1:05
p.m. on the  New York  Mercantile Exchange, up 14 percent in the
past year.  Natural gas for November delivery rose 4.3 cents, or 1.2
percent, to $3.672 per million British thermal units on the
Nymex, up 6.9 percent from a year ago.  U.S. gas stockpiles  rose 87 billion cubic feet last week to
3.741 trillion, the EIA said yesterday. Supplies were 2.4
percent below year-earlier inventories and 2.1 percent above the
five-year average.  Producers have been pulling rigs out of gas-rich plays to
focus on more profitable crude- and liquids-drilling since 2009,
with oil-targeted rigs now making about three-quarters of the
total count. Crude is  trading  almost 27 times as much as gas, up
from 10 times five years ago.  To contact the reporter on this story:
