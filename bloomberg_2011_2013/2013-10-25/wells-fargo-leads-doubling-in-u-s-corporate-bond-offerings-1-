Wells Fargo & Co. (WFC) , the largest U.S.
mortgage lender, and  ABN Amro  Bank NV led U.S. corporate bond
sales that more than doubled from last week as issuers captured
borrowing costs at four-month lows.  Sales rose to $37 billion from  $17.6 billion  in the five
days ended Oct. 18 and compare with a 2013 weekly average of
 $29.6 billion , according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Wells
Fargo raised $3.5 billion in a two-part issue and Amsterdam-based ABN Amro sold $2.5 billion of fixed- and floating-rate
bonds.  Issuance rose with borrowers and investors relieved that
the U.S. avoided a default. Congress agreed last week to end the
first partial government shutdown in 17 years, removing the
threat of missing Treasury payments and helping to send
corporate yields down to the lowest level since June. The
closure trimmed at least 0.6 percent from economic growth this
quarter, according to  Standard & Poor’s , and could induce the
 Federal Reserve  to postpone paring the pace of its $85 billion
in monthly bond purchases until March, economists surveyed by
Bloomberg said.  “A window has been opened for corporate credit to perform
well for both issuers and investors alike,” Edward Marrinan, a
macro credit strategist at RBS Securities, said in a telephone
interview from  Stamford ,  Connecticut . “The longer quantitative
easing is delayed, the better.”  Yields Fall  Yields on bonds from the most creditworthy to the riskiest
borrowers in the U.S. fell to 3.88 percent on Oct. 23, the
lowest since June 18, before reaching 3.9 percent yesterday,
according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch index data. Borrowing
costs decreased from 3.95 percent on Oct. 18.  The extra yield investors demand to own corporate bonds
rather than government debentures fell to 209 basis points
yesterday from 211 basis points, the index data show.  Wells Fargo sold $1.5 billion of 2.15 percent senior notes
due January 2019 to pay a relative yield of 85 basis points that
are rated A2 by Moody’s Investors Service, Bloomberg data show.
The San Francisco-based bank also issued $2 billion of 5.375
percent, 30-year subordinated debt at a relative yield of 170
basis points. Those securities are expected to be rated A3.  ABN Amro, the Dutch lender, issued $1 billion of 2.5
percent, five-year securities at a 127 basis-point spread and
$1.5 billion of three-year floaters that yield 80 basis points
more than the London interbank offered rate, Bloomberg data
show.  Bank Offerings  Offerings from banks made up 55 percent of sales this week,
as lenders from  Citigroup Inc. (C)  to  PNC Financial Services Group
Inc. (PNC)  raised debt after reporting third-quarter earnings,
Bloomberg data show.  Investors are favoring U.S. bank bonds over securities
issued by industrial companies by the most in more than six
years, with bond buyers demanding an average relative yield of
138 basis points to buy financial debt compared with 146 basis
points on industrials, index data show.  Sales of investment-grade debentures reached at least $30.3
billion, compared with  $13.9 billion  last week and a 2013 weekly
average of  $22.3 billion , Bloomberg data show. Offerings of
speculative-grade bonds reached at least $6.7 billion, compared
with  $3.7 billion  last week and a 2013 weekly average of $7.3
billion.  High-risk, high-yield bonds are rated below Baa3 by Moody’s
and lower than BBB- at Standard & Poor’s.  To contact the reporter on this story:
