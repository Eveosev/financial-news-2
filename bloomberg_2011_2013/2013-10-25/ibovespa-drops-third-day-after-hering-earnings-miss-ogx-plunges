The Ibovespa fell for a third day as
consumer stocks dropped after retailer  Cia. Hering (HGTX3)  posted third-quarter earnings that were below analysts’ estimates.  Oil company  OGX Petroleo e Gas Participacoes SA  tumbled
after Valor Economico reported a round of talks with bondholders
ended on Oct. 23 with no agreement reached.  Porto Seguro SA (PSSA3) 
dropped after Credit Suisse Group AG cut its rating on the
insurance company to the equivalent of sell.  The Ibovespa fell 0.3 percent to 54,722.13 at 10:47 a.m. in
Sao Paulo. The gauge is down 1.3 percent this week. The real
gained 0.9 percent to 2.1842 per dollar after  Brazil ’s central
bank said it will hold auctions over three days next week to
extend maturities on currency swaps.  “Some companies have reported earnings that weren’t very
inspiring, which is weighing on the market a bit,” Luis Gustavo Pereira, a strategist at Futura Corretora brokerage, said in a
phone interview from  Sao Paulo . “The Ibovespa is also very
vulnerable to whatever happens to OGX, and today the news is
negative.”  Hering sank 3.4 percent to 31.40 reais. Porto Seguro lost
1.2 percent to 28.34 reais. OGX slumped 8.3 percent to 33
centavos.  To contact the reporter on this story:
