Rabobank Groep’s  ACCBank  unit in
Ireland, which racked up almost 1.4 billion euros ($1.9 billion)
of loan losses in the past five years, plans to hand back its
license next year and focus solely on debt recovery following
the country’s real estate crash.  ACCBank will close all its business centers to the public
and cut 180 of its 470 employees through a voluntary program,
the Dublin-based lender said in a statement today. Rabobank
Ireland Plc, which focuses on lending to the food and
agricultural industries, and Rabobank Direct in Ireland, an
online savings and investment unit, aren’t affected, it said.  The bank follows London-based  Lloyds Banking Group Plc (LLOY)  in
becoming the second of Ireland’s five largest overseas-owned
consumer banks to retreat from the market since a real-estate
collapse in 2008. Founded in 1927 as a state-owned lender called
Agricultural Credit Corp., the company was acquired by Rabobank,
the Netherlands’s biggest mortgage lender, in 2002. ACCBank was
the smallest of the country’s biggest 11 lenders before the
crash.  “ACCBank has incurred significant losses since 2008 due to
the deterioration of the Irish property market,” Kevin
Knightly, Rabobank’s country manager in Ireland, said in the
statement. “While costs have been cut significantly, including
a substantial restructuring program in 2009, we are heading
toward a situation where, without intervention, our costs will
exceed our income during 2014. This is an unsustainable
position.”  ACCBank’s net loss widened to 222.2 million euros last year
from 174.2 million euros in 2011, as impairment losses on loans
rose 5.6 percent to 234.2 million euros, according to its  annual
report . The lender, which had a 3.84 billion-euro balance sheet
at the end of last year, has lost 1.39 billion euros on bad
loans since 2008, according to Bloomberg News calculations,
based on company filings.  To contact the reporter on this story:
