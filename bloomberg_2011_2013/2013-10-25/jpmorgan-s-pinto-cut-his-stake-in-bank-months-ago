Daniel Pinto, co-head of  JPMorgan
Chase & Co. (JPM) ’s corporate and investment bank, sold $7.6 million
in company stock in a pair of previously undisclosed
transactions months ago, according to a regulatory filing.  A delay in reporting the sales, which occurred in April and
July, “was an error which we caught and corrected,” said Mark Kornblau, a spokesman for the New York-based firm. The
Securities and Exchange Commission requires transactions by
corporate insiders to be disclosed within two business days,
according to the agency’s  website .  Pinto, 50, sold 73,000 shares valued at $3.56 million on
April 29 and 73,247 shares valued at $4.06 million on July 15,
according to yesterday’s filing. The deals disposed of almost
all of his direct holdings that would have been eligible for
sale at the time, according to descriptions of his awards and
their terms in January filings.  JPMorgan has risen 19 percent this year to $52.52 at 10:52
a.m. in  New York ,  trailing  the 26 percent increase in the  KBW
Bank Index (BKX)  of 24 U.S. lenders.  Pinto also exercised 400,000  stock options  that gave him
shares valued at about $22 million and sold 263,057 shares for
$14.5 million to cover the cost of the transaction as well as
his tax obligations on July 15, according to a July 17 filing.  He directly owns shares that would be valued at $10.6
million, based on figures in filings on July 26 and yesterday.
He also holds $8.25 million of JPMorgan shares in a trust,
valued at yesterday’s closing price of $52.48.  To contact the reporters on this story:
