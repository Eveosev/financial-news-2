Carrefour SA (CA)  said Charles Desmartis
will lead all of the grocer’s operations in Brazil, following a
report that the company hired banks for an initial public
offering of the retailer’s second-largest business.  Desmartis, 56, has been in charge of the company’s
financial control since 2011, Boulogne-Billancourt, France-based
Carrefour said in a statement today. Carrefour hired Itau BBA
and Credit Suisse for an IPO of the Brazilian business,
newspaper Exame reported yesterday.  Under Chief Executive Officer Georges Plassat, the retailer
has exited markets from Colombia to  Greece  to focus on restoring
growth at home. Carrefour entered Brazil in 1975 and operates
more than 100 hypermarkets and 40 supermarkets in the country,
which generated 12.5 billion euros ($17.3 billion) in revenue
last year.  A Carrefour official declined to comment about the
company’s plans in  Brazil .  To contact the reporters on this story:
