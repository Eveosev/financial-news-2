A warehouse holding about 28,000
metric tons of sugar was destroyed in a fire today in Santa
Adelia,  Brazil , said the company responsible for the facility.  There were no injuries and all the sweetener was insured,
 Agrovia SA , in which ED&F Man Holdings Ltd. holds a 25 percent
stake, said in an e-mailed statement.  Fire fighters prevented the blaze from spreading to a
second storage unit, Agrovia Chief Executive Officer Guilherme
Raposo said earlier today by phone, estimating losses at 25,000
to 30,000 tons. Raw sugar for delivery in March rose 0.5 percent
to 19.06 cents a pound at 1:53 p.m. in  New York . Prices jumped
last week when a fire at Brazil’s Santos Port destroyed 180,000
tons.  “We sent a crew to the city to evaluate damages and see
which company’s sugar was affected,” Raposo said in a phone
interview from  Sao Paulo . “We are already working to have the
second unit’s service reestablished as soon as possible.”  Tereos Internacional SA (TERI3) ’s Guarani SA unit said by e-mail
that it is assessing damage at the Santa Adelia site, which
accounts for less than 1 percent of its total sales. Daniel
Friend, a spokesman for ED&F Man, declined to comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
