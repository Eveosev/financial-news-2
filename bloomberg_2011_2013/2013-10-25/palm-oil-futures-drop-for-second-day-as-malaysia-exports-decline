Palm oil  retreated the most in four
weeks as a report on shipments from  Malaysia , the world’s
second-largest producer, signaled declining demand and as crude
oil headed for the biggest weekly loss since June.  The contract for delivery in January slid 0.8 percent to
close at 2,444 ringgit ($780) a metric ton on the Bursa Malaysia
Derivatives, the biggest decline for most-active futures since
Sept. 26. Palm for physical delivery in November was at 2,455
ringgit today, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Exports fell 0.6 percent to 1.23 million tons during Oct.
1-25 from a month earlier,  said  surveyor Intertek. That compares
with a 6.6 percent increase in the first 15 days of the month.
SGS estimated shipments rose 3.8 percent in the first 25 days,
less than growth of 12 percent in the first 15 days. Futures
still gained 1.8 percent this week on speculation output in
Malaysia may increase at a slower pace.  “Although production is not growing as much as expected,
exports are not catching up and this will keep a lid on
prices,” said Sandeep Bajoria, chief executive officer of
Mumbai-based broker Sunvin Group. “Crude  oil prices  have also
dropped below $100, making palm oil less attractive” as a
biofuel feedstock, he said.  WTI for December delivery was at $97.42 a barrel in
electronic trading on the  New York Mercantile Exchange , set for
a 3.3 percent decline this week, the most since June.  Palm oil output will probably expand 3.3 percent to 19.4
million tons this year as yields increase, more trees begin
production and oil extraction rates improve, Malaysia’s finance
ministry said today in its Economic Report for 2013-2014.  Soybeans for delivery in January fell 0.2 percent to $13.01
a bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade, while  soybean oil  for
December gained 0.1 percent to 41.09 cents a pound.  Refined palm oil for May delivery dropped 0.7 percent to
end at 6,084 yuan ($1,000) a ton on the  Dalian Commodity
Exchange  and soybean oil fell 0.9 percent to close at 7,136
 yuan .  To contact the reporter on this story:
