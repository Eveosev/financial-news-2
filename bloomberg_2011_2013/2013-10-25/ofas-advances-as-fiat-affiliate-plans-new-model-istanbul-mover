carmaker expects to invest $520 million to roll out 580,000

with Fiat are “in the final phase,” according to Tofas.  The company’s export plans for the new model are
“especially positive for the stock,” Ozgur Ucur, an analyst at
Finans Invest in Istanbul, said by phone. “Export volumes of
the current passenger car model, Linea, were limited.”  The carmaker ranks third in domestic passenger car market
share with 8.4 percent, according to a presentation on its
website. It exported 1,924 Linea cars in the first half out of
85,464 vehicles sold abroad, the document shows.  Second-quarter profit fell 13 percent to 109 million liras
