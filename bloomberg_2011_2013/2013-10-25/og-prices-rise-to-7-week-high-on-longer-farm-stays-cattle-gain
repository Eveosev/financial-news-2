Hog futures rose to a seven-week
high on signs that U.S. producers are holding animals on farms
longer because of lower feed costs, tightening supplies
available to pork processors. Cattle advanced.  The average  weight  of hogs at slaughter yesterday was 2.1
percent heavier than a year earlier and 3.1 percent more than at
the end of July, government data show. A three-year low in the
price of corn, the main feed ingredient, is encouraging farmers
to fatten hogs longer before they are sold to pork plants, said
Don Roose, the president of U.S. Commodities Inc.  “Guys are adding on pounds because it’s profitable,”
Roose said in a telephone interview from  Des Moines ,  Iowa .  Hog futures for December settlement rose 0.5 percent to
90.05 cents a pound at 10:56 a.m. on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange, after touching 90.65 cents, the highest price for the
most-active contract since Sept. 6.  Pork processors slaughtered 1.724 million hogs this week
through yesterday, down 0.5 percent from a week earlier, U.S.
Department of Agriculture data show.  Cattle futures for December delivery increased 0.8 percent
to $1.33875 a pound on the CME, after touching $1.339, the
highest for a most-active contract since Oct. 17. Prices are up
1.4 percent for the week, the biggest gain this month.  Cattle futures for October delivery, the closest to
expiration, rose as much as 1.6 percent to $1.349, the highest
ever for a front-month contract. Open interest, a measure of
contracts that have not been closed or liquidated, reached 1,877
for the October futures, or 1.3 percent of the 149,232 held for
December delivery.  Feeder-cattle futures for January settlement rose 0.2
percent to $1.67 a pound.  To contact the reporter on this story:
