Asian currencies rose for a fourth
week on signs of a pickup in Chinese manufacturing and as U.S.
jobs data fueled speculation the  Federal Reserve  will delay
cutting its record stimulus.  The Bloomberg-JPMorgan Asia  Dollar Index  added 0.1 percent
from Oct. 18 as China’s yuan reached its strongest level in 20
years and Indonesia’s rupiah had its best week since June 2009.
Malaysia’s ringgit rallied in offshore markets yesterday after
the government proposed to cut its  budget deficit  for 2014.
South Korea’s won retreated from a two-year high on suspected
central bank intervention.  “There’s still scope for upside in Asian currencies,”
said Choong Yin Pheng, senior manager for bond and economic
research in Kuala Lumpur at  Hong Leong Bank Bhd. (HLBK)  “The consensus
view is that we are not going to see the Fed tapering this year,
and Chinese data is upbeat.”  The  yuan  climbed 0.2 percent from a week ago to 6.0840 per
dollar in Shanghai, according to the China Foreign Exchange
Trade System, appreciating for a third week. The rupiah jumped
2.8 percent to 11,015, while the  Philippine peso  advanced 0.1
percent to 43.035 versus the greenback.  The rupiah strengthened for a fourth week as global funds
bought more Indonesian stocks than they sold in the four days
through Oct. 24, the first net inflow in a month, according to
exchange data. The yuan rose as high as 6.0802 per dollar
yesterday, the strongest level since the government unified the
official and market exchange rates at the end of 1993.  China, U.S.  China’s  Purchasing Managers ’ Index rose to a seven-month
high of 50.9 in October from 50.2 in September, HSBC Holdings
Plc and Markit Economics said in an Oct. 24 report. A weaker-than-forecast September U.S. jobs report on Oct. 22 fueled
speculation the Fed will delay paring its $85 billion a month of
bond purchases to March.  “The market has pushed its expectation for Fed tapering
into next year,” said Khoon Goh, a senior currency strategist
at  Australia & New Zealand Banking Group Ltd. (ANZ)  in Singapore.
Investors are looking for additional yield in  emerging markets 
to tide them over, he said.  Malaysia plans to cut its fiscal deficit to 3.5 percent of
gross domestic product in 2014 from 4 percent this year, the
nation’s finance ministry said in a report. Prime Minister Najib
Razak proposed yesterday a goods and services tax from April
2015 to broaden revenue base, and lower corporate and personal
income taxes.  The ringgit gained 0.1 percent yesterday to 3.1566 per
dollar in  Kuala Lumpur  and was little changed from a week ago.
One-month non-deliverable forwards rallied 0.6 percent yesterday
to 3.1337 per dollar.  Won Intervention  South Korea’s won fell 0.1 percent from a week ago to
1,062.06 per dollar after government officials said they would
act to counter any “herd behavior.” Ryoo Sang Dai, director
general at the Bank of Korea’s international department,
declined to comment on Oct. 24 on whether authorities intervened
in the  currency market , or on the size of the suspected action.  Thailand’s baht weakened 0.1 percent to 31.089 per dollar
from a week ago. Exports shrank 7.1 percent in September from a
year earlier, versus a 3.9 percent gain in August, the
government said. The Bank of Thailand cut its 2013 growth
forecast to 3.7 percent from 4.2 percent.  Elsewhere, India’s rupee weakened 0.3 percent to 61.4600
per dollar, while Taiwan’s dollar was steady at NT$29.455.
Vietnam’s dong gained 0.1 percent to 21,100.  To contact the reporter on this story:
