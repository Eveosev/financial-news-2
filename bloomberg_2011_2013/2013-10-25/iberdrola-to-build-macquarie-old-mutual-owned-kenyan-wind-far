Iberdrola SA (IBE)  will build a wind farm
northwest of Nairobi for 85 million-euros ($117 million) as
Spain’s biggest utility seeks growth in the African nation.  The Kinangop plant with 61 megawatts will be owned by
Africa Infrastructure Investment Fund 2, backed by Macquarie
Africa Ltd. and Old Mutual Investment Group South Africa,
Iberdrola said in a statement. Norfund AS, the Norwegian
investment fund for  developing countries , will also own shares.
South Africa’s Standard Bank Group Ltd. was a manager for the
deal, according to Iberdrola.  Iberdrola is seeking growth in  Kenya  where President Uhuru Kenyatta pledged to accelerate the pace of economic growth and
ensure every Kenyan has access to electricity by 2020. The
utility is also building grid upgrades in the Kenyan capital as
well as the Ngong II wind farm outside Nairobi, where it’s
working with Gamesa Corp Tecnologica SA.  Iberdrola will build and commission Kinangop with 38
turbines from General Electric Co., according to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
