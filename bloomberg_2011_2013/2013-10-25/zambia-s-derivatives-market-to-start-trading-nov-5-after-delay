Zambia’s Bond and Derivatives
Exchange is set to begin trading in its first product on Nov. 5
after it signed on three clearing members, Chief Executive
Officer Allan Thomson said.  Zambia National Commercial Bank Plc, the country’s biggest
lender, the local unit of BancABC, the Botswana-based bank and
Finance Bank Zambia Ltd. are the members, he said by phone today
from Knysna, on  South Africa ’s southern coast.  “We’re really just putting the plumbing in place,”
Thomson said.  Badex, as the exchange is called, earlier planned to start
trading a dollar-kwacha futures contract by September. That
target was missed because of delays in setting up what will be
the first derivatives exchange in  Africa  in more than two
decades, Thomson said.  The exchange will provide a currency-hedging mechanism for
companies in Africa’s biggest copper producer, after the
government banned using foreign currencies last year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
