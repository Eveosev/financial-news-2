U.S. stocks erased gains as losses
in raw-material producers and health-care providers offset a
rally in technology shares.  The  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index (SPX)  was little changed at
1,752.92 at 12:16 p.m. in New York. The U.S. equity benchmark
earlier rose as much as 0.4 percent.  Amazon.com Inc. and Microsoft Corp. rallied after reporting
earnings that beat analysts’ estimates. The Nasdaq 100 Index
climbed 0.3 percent. Eastman Chemical Co. slumped 6.9 percent
after cutting its full-year forecast. Express Scripts Holding
Co. declined 3.8 percent after the largest U.S. processor of
prescription drug claims reduced its 2013 cash flow forecast.  The  S&P 500  has jumped 4.3 percent this month as lawmakers
agreed to raise the government’s borrowing limit, avoiding a
sovereign default. Equities are heading for their third weekly
rally as signs of slower economic recovery fueled bets the Fed
will wait until March before scaling back bond purchases.  To contact the reporter on this story:
