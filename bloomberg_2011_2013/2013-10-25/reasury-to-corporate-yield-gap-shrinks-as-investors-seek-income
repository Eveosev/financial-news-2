Treasuries gained for a second
consecutive week amid speculation the  U.S. economy  is recovering
too slowly for the  Federal Reserve  to begin reducing asset
purchases this year.  Ten-year notes  rose for the third time in four days as a
orders to manufacturers unexpectedly dropped in September and
households were more glum in October for a third consecutive
month, showing the U.S. economy was taking a step back heading
into the fiscal gridlock that partially shut down the federal
government. The 16-day closure ended when lawmakers agreed to
open the government until Jan. 15 and suspend the debt ceiling
to Feb. 7. The extra yield investors get from corporate bonds
instead of Treasuries shrank to the least since June.  “You had weaker payrolls and durable goods this week,”
said Shyam Rajan, an interest-rate strategist at Bank of America
Merrill Lynch in  New York , one of the 21 primary dealers that
trade with the Fed. “The market’s pricing in a later Fed hike,
a slower hiking cycle and a later start to tapering.”  The benchmark 10-year yield fell one basis point, or 0.01
percentage point, to 2.51 percent at 5 p.m. in New York,
according to Bloomberg Bond Trader prices. The 2.5 percent note
due August 2023 rose 3/32, or 94 per $1,000 face amount, to 99
29/32. The yield has fallen seven basis points this week.  Relative Value  Treasuries returned 0.6 percent in October through
yesterday, limiting its 2013 loss to 1.85 percent, data compiled
by Bloomberg show. Securities in the  corporate bond  index
returned 1.4 percent this month, trimming losses to 1.06 percent
for the year. The Bloomberg Global Developed  Sovereign Bond
Index (BGSV)  gained 1.48 percent this month, limiting its 2013 decline
to 1.89 percent.  The seven-day  relative strength  index for the Treasury 10-year note yield was at 30 today, dropping from 31.48 yesterday,
according to Bloomberg data. A reading lower than 30 or above 70
suggests the security may be poised for a change in direction.  The Treasury will sell $96 billion of debt next week,
starting with $32 billion of two-year notes on Oct. 28, $35
billion of five-year securities on Oct. 29 and $29 billion of
seven-year obligations on Oct. 30. It will be the third
consecutive month that the U.S. has reduced the offering size of
two-year debt.  Demand may come from “people who have been light on
Treasuries or underinvested, and believe the environment is
better to become more involved,” said  Christopher Sullivan , who
oversees $2.2 billion as chief investment officer at United
Nations Federal Credit Union in New York.  Slower Growth  The Fed will maintain monthly bond purchases at $85 billion
until March, according to a Bloomberg News survey of economists.
Before the partial government shutdown, the majority predicted
the central bank would taper stimulus this year. The next two
Fed meetings are Oct. 29-30 and Dec. 17-18.  The shutdown that began Oct. 1 probably trimmed 0.25
percentage point from fourth-quarter economic growth and cost
120,000 jobs in October, President  Barack Obama ’s chief economic
adviser said Oct. 22. Payrolls climbed by 148,000 in September,
the Labor Department said Oct. 22, less than the forecast of
180,000 in a Bloomberg survey.  “There’s nothing here that would alter our view that as a
result of the crises that we’ve been through the economic growth
that we’ve been experiencing will be tamped down a little bit,”
said  David Coard , head of fixed-income trading in New York at
Williams Capital Group, a brokerage for institutional investors.
“We’re likely to see numbers that are weaker as a result of the
crises.”  Consumer Confidence  The Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan final index of
consumer sentiment showed declined to 73.2 from 75.2 a month
earlier. A Bloomberg survey projected a decline to 75.  Bookings for non-military capital goods excluding aircraft,
which reflect demand for productivity-enhancing equipment like
machinery and electrical gear, decreased 1.1 percent last month,
the second drop in three months, the Commerce Department said.  Traders are pricing in a 26.7 percent probability that the
Fed will raise its benchmark overnight rate by its January 2015
meeting, down from 37.1 percent a month ago.  Securities in the Bloomberg USD Corporate Bond Index have
an average yield of 3.10 percent, versus 1.37 percent for the
Bloomberg U.S. Treasury Bond Index. The difference of 1.73
percentage points was the narrowest since June 3.  Volatility in  Treasuries (BUSY)  as measured by the Merrill Lynch
MOVE Index climbed to 63.14 yesterday after dropping to 62.05 on
Oct. 23, the lowest level since May 21. The average for the past
decade is 95.  To contact the reporters on this story:
