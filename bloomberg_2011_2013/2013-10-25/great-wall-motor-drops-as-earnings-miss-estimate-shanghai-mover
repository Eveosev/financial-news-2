Great Wall Motor Co.,  China ’s
biggest sport-utility vehicle maker, slumped the most in two
years in Shanghai trading after posting profit that missed
analysts estimates yesterday.  The stock fell 10 percent to 43.55  yuan  as of 2:45 p.m. in
Shanghai trading, the largest intraday decline since September
2011. Great Wall Motor fell 8.6 percent to HK$44.30 in Hong Kong
trading.  Net income for the third quarter increased to 2.08 billion
yuan ($342 million) from a year earlier, missing the 2.33
billion-yuan average of four analysts  estimates  compiled by
Bloomberg. Gross margins fell from the previous quarter, which
should disappoint investors, analysts including Zhi Aik Yeo at
Jefferies Hong Kong Ltd. wrote in a note.  “We are suspicious that it was mainly increased
depreciation that led to the margin dip,” the analysts wrote.
The gross margin fell 0.9 percentage points to 26.3 percent from
the previous quarter, they wrote.  The company’s  shares  have more than doubled in  Shanghai 
this year before trading today, compared with the 4.62 percent
drop in the Shanghai Composite Index. China September auto sales
rose 21 percent to 1.59 million units.  “While in the near-term some investors may take profit at
the current share price new highs, we believe any share price
weakness would be a buying opportunity.” Paul Gong, a Hong
Kong-based analyst at Citi Research, wrote in a report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
