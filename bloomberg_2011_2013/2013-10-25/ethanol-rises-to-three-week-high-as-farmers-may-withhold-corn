Ethanol rose to a three-week high in
Chicago on speculation that farmers are withholding corn
supplies to boost prices.  Futures for the biofuel gained 1.2 percent as farmers have
 harvested  about 39 percent of this year’s corn crop, according
to Agriculture Department estimates. Farmers responded to low
yields from last year’s drought-plagued crop by planting record
acreage, helping to cause a 37 percent price decline this year
for corn, the main ingredient of U.S. ethanol.  “I’d expect the ethanol producer to have to fight pretty
hard to get the corn, not because it’s not available, but
because the farmer wants higher prices,” said  Jason Ward , an
analyst at Northstar Commodity Investments in  Minneapolis .
“He’s harvesting his corn, but he doesn’t like the price.”  Denatured ethanol for November delivery rose 1.9 cents, or
1 percent, to $1.845 a gallon at 11:30 a.m. on the Chicago Board
of Trade, the highest price since Oct. 3. Ethanol has declined
16 percent this year.  Gasoline for November delivery fell 2.09 cents, or 0.8
percent, to $2.5687 a gallon on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange . The contract covers reformulated gasoline, made to be
blended with ethanol before delivery to filling stations.  Ethanol’s discount to the motor fuel narrowed 3.99 cents to
72.37 cents a gallon, the tightest since Oct. 1.  Corn Futures  Corn for December delivery was unchanged at $4.4025 a
bushel on the  Chicago  exchange. The December corn crush spread
of corn to ethanol was 10 cents, up from 7 cents yesterday.  Ward said ethanol companies have to pay higher prices for
the corn or risk seeing the grain shipped via rail from regions
where farmers don’t have spare storage capacity. Farmers will be
more willing to sell as more corn is collected and bin space
tightens, Ward said.  Ethanol  output  increased 3.2 percent to 897,000 barrels a
day last week, the highest level since June 15, 2012, an Oct. 23
Energy Information Administration report showed.  Stockpiles expanded 0.5 percent to 15.5 million barrels,
down 17 percent from a year earlier, according to the EIA, the
Energy Department’s statistical arm.  To contact the reporter on this story:
