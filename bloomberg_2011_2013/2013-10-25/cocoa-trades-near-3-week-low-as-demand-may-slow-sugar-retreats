Cocoa traded near the lowest level
in almost three weeks in  London  on speculation demand will start
to slow, leading investors who bet on higher prices to sell some
of their futures. Sugar retreated.  The cost of cocoa butter, which accounts for 20 percent of
the weight of a chocolate bar, slid to a ratio of 2.6 to 2.7
times the futures on NYSE Liffe. That’s down from 2.74 on Sept.
27, the highest since 2008, according to KnowledgeCharts, a unit
of Commodities Risk Analysis in Bethlehem,  Pennsylvania .
Investors more than doubled bets on higher prices in London this
year. In New York, trader holdings’ reports will start being
published again today after a government shutdown.  “With a large fund long position and improving weather
conditions, the market is ripe for correction, particularly
heading into the weekend,” Sterling Smith, a futures specialist
at Citigroup Inc., said in a report e-mailed yesterday.  Cocoa for delivery in March was little changed at 1,703
pounds ($2,758) a ton by 11:46 a.m. on NYSE Liffe in London. The
price touched 1,697 pounds, the lowest for this contract since
Oct. 7. Cocoa for delivery in December was unchanged at $2,686 a
ton on ICE Futures U.S. in New York. Futures trading volumes
were 15 percent lower than the average for the past 100 days for
this time of day, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Cocoa Grindings  Cocoa grindings, an indication of demand, are recovering as
chocolate consumption picks up, especially in developed
countries. Processing gained 4.7 percent in  Europe  in the third
quarter from a year earlier and 8.2 percent in  North America ,
according to data from the European Cocoa Association in
Brussels and the  National Confectioners Association  in
 Washington . Sales by The  Hershey Co. (HSY) , maker of Kisses, gained
6.1 percent in the third quarter, driven by volume, the company
said yesterday.  Some observers say that may be “the last batch of ‘good
news’ for the demand side in the near term,” Eric Sivry, head
of agricultural options brokerage at London-based Marex Spectron
Group, said in a report e-mailed today, referring to Hershey’s
earnings. “Combine this with the recent strong arrivals in
 Ivory Coast  and hey presto, you have a bearish argument in
hand!”  Cocoa bean deliveries to ports in Ivory Coast, the world’s
largest producer, more than doubled to 106,000 tons in the Oct.
1-20 period, data on KnowledgeCharts showed. That compares with
47,000 tons in the same period a year earlier.  Robusta coffee for delivery in January fell 0.2 percent to
$1,579 a ton on NYSE Liffe. Arabica coffee for delivery in
December gained 0.5 percent to $1.109 a pound on ICE.  Refined, or white, sugar for December delivery fell 0.4
percent to $500.20 a ton in London. Raw sugar for delivery in
March declined 0.6 percent to 18.86 cents a pound in  New York .  To contact the reporter on this story:
