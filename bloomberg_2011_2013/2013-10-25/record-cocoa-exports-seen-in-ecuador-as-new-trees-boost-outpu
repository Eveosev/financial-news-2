Ecuador, the top grower of flavored
 cocoa beans  used in fine chocolate, expects record exports this
year as new plants and education programs increase output, the
head of the country’s National Cocoa Exporters Association said.  Cocoa-bean exports from the South American country will
probably increase to about 170,000 metric tons in 2013, a 7.6
percent gain over last year, Ivan Ontaneda, president of the
association known as  Anecacao , said today in a telephone
interview from the coastal city of Guayaquil. The group
forecasts exports of the bean will jump about 12 percent to
190,000 metric tons in 2014, he said.  An additional 50,000 hectares (123,550 acres) of new trees
planted in 2009 and 2010 are beginning to bear fruit, boosting
output and offsetting lost production from a cold snap earlier
this year, Ontaneda said. Yields are also increasing as
government programs to educate small farmers, who make up 95
percent of the country’s growers, improve harvests, he said.  “A good harvest is coming,” said Ontaneda, 45, who’s also
the chief executive officer of Guayaquil-based cocoa exporter
Eco-Kakao SA. “It’ll be a record.”  The London-based International Cocoa Organization said on
Sept. 27 that processing will outpace the global bean harvest by
as much as 70,000 metric tons in the year that began Oct. 1.
Drier-than-normal weather hurt crops in West Africa, which
produces 70 percent of the global harvest.  Cocoa growers in  Ecuador , which has been producing the raw
ingredient used to make chocolate for more than 500 years, plan
to more than double output to 400,000 metric tons by 2020 to
keep up with demand for chocolate, Ontaneda said. The cocoa tree
is native to the tropical South American rainforests east of the
Andes Mountains, according to the ICCO.  Cocoa for delivery in March rose 0.9 percent to 1,718
pounds ($2,778) a ton at 1:53 p.m.  New York  time on NYSE Liffe
in  London . Cocoa for delivery in December rose 1.1 percent to
$2,715 a ton on ICE Futures U.S. in New York.  To contact the reporter on this story:
