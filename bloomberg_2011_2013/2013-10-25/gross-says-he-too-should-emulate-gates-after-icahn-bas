Bill Gross , who urged billionaire
investor Carl Icahn yesterday to dedicate more time to charity
instead of pushing  Apple Inc. (AAPL)  to buy back shares, said he also
should spend more time on philanthropy.  “By the way, I should spend more time like Bill Gates, too
-- we all should,” Gross, who runs the $250 billion  Pimco Total
Return Fund (PTTRX)  at Pacific Investment Management Co. in Newport
Beach, California, wrote in a message on Twitter today. “He and
Melinda are great paragons.”  In a Twitter message yesterday, Gross said Icahn should
leave Apple alone and spend more time like Gates, the  Microsoft
Corp. (MSFT)  co-founder and world’s richest man who, together with his
wife Melinda, started a foundation aimed at improving people’s
lives. Icahn, ranked 33rd on the Bloomberg Billionaires Index of
the world’s richest people with a personal wealth of $21.7
billion, is pushing Apple to buy back $150 billion of shares and
has criticized the board for not acting to enhance value.  Icahn has signed the  Giving Pledge , a group that Gates and
investor  Warren Buffett  founded to encourage the world’s richest
to give the majority of their wealth to charity. In 2012, he
pledged $200 million to the Mount Sinai School of Medicine, the
biggest donation ever given to the New York City teaching
hospital.  Gross’s personal wealth is estimated at $2 billion. The 69-year-old has endowed a foundation with $293 million in assets
and raised money for Doctors Without Borders, a medical charity,
by selling parts of his stamp collection.  To contact the reporter on this story:
