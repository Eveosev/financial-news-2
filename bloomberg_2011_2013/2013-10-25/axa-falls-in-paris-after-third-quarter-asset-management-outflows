Axa SA (CS) ,  Europe ’s second-largest
insurer, fell in Paris trading after clients withdrew funds from
its asset management units in the third-quarter.  Axa fell as much as 2.4 percent to 18.19 euros and traded
down 2.1 percent at 18.25 euros by 12:41 p.m., the worst
performer on the 30-member Bloomberg Europe 500 Insurance Index.
Axa has risen 37 percent this year, valuing the insurer at about
43.7 billion euros ($60.3 billion).  AllianceBernstein Holding LP (AB) , Axa’s New York-based asset
manager, yesterday reported $4.8 billion of third-quarter
outflows. Axa IM, the insurer’s money-management unit based near
Paris, had nine-month net flows of 7.5 billion euros, down from
10 billion euros in the six months through June.  “Outflows are a bit disappointing in the short-term,”
said Francois Boissin, a Paris-based analyst at Exane BNP
Paribas with an outperform rating on the stock.  Axa’s total nine-month sales rose about 2 percent to 69.5
billion euros, helped by life-and-savings premiums, the company
said yesterday. That compares with the 70.5 billion-euro nine-month revenue estimate of Exane analysts.  Axa’s asset-management revenue rose 6 percent to 2.6
billion euros in the period through September, helped by higher
management fees and increased real estate transactions at its
Paris-based Axa IM unit, the insurer said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
