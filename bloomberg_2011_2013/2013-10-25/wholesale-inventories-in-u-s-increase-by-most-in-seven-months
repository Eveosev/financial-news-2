Inventories at U.S. wholesalers
increased in August by the most in seven months as merchants
tried to keep pace with stronger demand.  The  value of unsold goods  increased 0.5 percent after a
revised 0.2 percent gain in July that was larger than previously
reported, the Commerce Department said today in  Washington . The
median forecast in a Bloomberg survey of economists called for a
0.3 percent increase. Sales jumped 0.6 percent in August after
no change the month before.  Wholesalers had enough goods on hand to last 1.17 months at
the current sales pace, matching the previous two months as the
lowest since September 2011. With inventories already running
lean, companies would need to increase production or import more
amid signs of increased demand.  Estimates of the 28 economists surveyed by Bloomberg for
wholesale inventories ranged from no change to a 0.6 percent
increase. Distributors’ sales were also projected to climb 0.3
percent, the survey median showed.  Wholesalers’ stockpiles of  durable goods  -- those meant to
last three years or more -- increased 0.6 percent in August,
outpaced by a 0.9 percent jump in sales. Inventories of imported
 automobiles  rose 2.4 percent as purchases eased 0.9 percent.  Stockpiles of furniture and electrical equipment also
increased in August, while a 0.5 percent pickup in inventories
of  non-durable goods  reflected a gain in petroleum.  To contact the reporter on this story:
