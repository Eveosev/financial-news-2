China ’s money-market rate headed for
the biggest weekly jump since a cash squeeze in June after the
central bank refrained from injecting funds through open-market
operations.  The People’s Bank of China suspended selling reverse-repurchase contracts Oct. 17, 22, and 24, after offering seven-or 14-day agreements at twice-weekly auctions for more than
three months. The PBOC withdrew a net 58 billion yuan ($9.5
billion) this week, the most since February, after draining a
net 44.5 billion yuan in the week ended Oct. 18., according to
 data  compiled by Bloomberg.  The  seven-day repurchase rate  increased 140 basis points,
or 1.40 percentage point, this week to 4.89 percent as of 10:53
a.m. in  Shanghai , according to a daily fixing by the National
Interbank Funding Center. That was the biggest weekly advance
since the period ended June 23. The rate climbed 11 basis points
today. The overnight repo rate rose 135 basis points this week
to 4.33 percent.  “The central bank suspended reverse-repo sales probably in
order to offset the impact of fund inflows and rising inflation
pressure,” said Gao Hui, an analyst at Founder Securities Co.
in Beijing. “So far we don’t see any factors that will lead to
a repeat of the June crunch.”  Yuan positions  at Chinese financial institutions
accumulated from foreign-exchange purchases climbed 0.5 percent
last month, the most since April, to 27.5 trillion  yuan .
Consumer prices rose 3.1 percent from a year ago in September,
the fastest pace since February.  The one-year interest-rate swap, the fixed payment needed
to receive the floating seven-day repo, rose 13 basis points
this week to 4.10 percent, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. That was the biggest weekly advance since August. The
cost fell three basis points today.  The yield on  government bonds  due August 2023 rose 10 basis
points this week to 4.23 percent, according to data from the
Interbank Funding Center. It climbed two basis points today.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
