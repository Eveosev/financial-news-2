The cost of insuring corporate and
sovereign bonds against non-payment in the Asia-Pacific region
outside of  Japan  was unchanged, according to traders of credit-default swaps.  The Markit iTraxx Asia index of 40 investment-grade
borrowers outside Japan was little changed at 135 basis points
as of 9:05 a.m. in Hong Kong, Australia & New Zealand Banking
Group Ltd. prices show. The benchmark is set to have fallen 21.4
basis points this month, according to data provider CMA.  The Markit iTraxx Australia index was also little changed
at 106 basis points as of 11:12 a.m. in Sydney, National
Australia Bank Ltd. prices show. The measure, which has ranged
from 96.1 to 149.5 this year, is poised to have dropped 19.2
basis points since Sept. 30, according to CMA, which is owned by
McGraw-Hill Cos. and compiles prices quoted by dealers in the
private market.  The Markit iTraxx Japan index was unchanged at 86 basis
points as of 9:11 a.m. in  Tokyo , according to Citigroup Inc.
prices. The gauge, which retreated to a four-week low on Oct.
21, is on track to have declined 11.3 basis points this month,
CMA data show.  Credit-default swap indexes are benchmarks for insuring
bonds against default and traders use them to speculate on
credit quality. A drop signals improving perceptions of
creditworthiness, while an increase suggests the opposite.  The swap contracts pay the buyer face value in exchange for
the underlying securities if a borrower fails to meet its debt
agreements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
