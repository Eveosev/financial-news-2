The Johan Castberg oil project in
 Norway ’s Arctic Barents Sea, delayed by  Statoil ASA (STL)  because of
cost overruns, tax changes and uncertain reserve estimates, will
be developed, the country’s new energy minister said.  “The parties will find good solutions to this,” petroleum
and energy minister Tord Lien said in an interview today. “If
we see that this type of process isn’t coming on track, we’ll of
course look at how to handle it.”  Statoil, the country’s biggest oil and gas producer, said
in June it is delaying plans to develop Castberg, which consists
of the twin Skrugard and Havis finds holding as much as 600
million barrels of crude in total. The company, 67-percent owned
by the state, cited a May tax increase, cost overruns and
smaller reserves than anticipated for reviewing plans to build a
pipeline and an  oil terminal .  Although the new Conservative-led government that took
power last week won’t reverse the tax increase, it has said it
will consider changes to taxation to stimulate increased
recovery from producing and marginal fields. Such changes would
be the initiative of the  finance ministry , Lien said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
