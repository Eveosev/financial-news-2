Canada’s budget  deficit  narrowed in
August as the federal government’s spending declined.  The deficit for the month fell to C$2.31 billion ($2.21
billion) from C$3.04 billion a year earlier, the finance
department said in a statement today from Ottawa. Program
expenses dropped 3.8 percent while revenue rose 0.6 percent.
Public debt charges increased 6.4 percent to C$2.38 billion.  Finance Minister Jim Flaherty said this week the
government’s deficit fell as it cut operating expenses. The
shortfall was C$18.9 billion in the fiscal year ended March 31,
down 28 percent from the prior year and C$7.0 billion less than
projected six months ago.  The budget gap for the first five months of the year
started April 1 fell to C$6.84 billion from C$7.20 billion a
year earlier. In his March budget, Flaherty projected a deficit
of C$18.7 billion for this year. The finance department said the
government is still on track to eliminate the deficit in 2015.  The government  anticipates  direct program spending, which
doesn’t include transfers to provinces or individuals, to fall
to C$119.2 billion this year from C$122.1 billion. Spending on
that component in the first five months of the current year rose
1.5 percent to C$42.7 billion.  To contact the reporter on this story:
