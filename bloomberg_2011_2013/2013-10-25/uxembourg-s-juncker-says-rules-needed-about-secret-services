Luxembourg Prime MinisterJean-Claude Juncker said European Union leaders agreed on the need
for rules on the conduct of secret services.  At a two-day summit in Brussels that ended today, the EU
heads of state or government “agreed that we need rules about
what secret services can and cannot do,” Juncker told reporters
after the meeting. ‘‘We agreed together to check the manner in
which secret services from various EU countries cooperate and
what they do on the territories of the others,’’ he said.  Juncker’s remarks come after EU leaders complained about
reported U.S. eavesdropping of European phones, including
that of German Chancellor Angela Merkel. The German leader and
French President Francois Hollande have led calls for closer
cooperation among secret services.  ‘‘We will try to have a code of good conduct with the
Americans limiting what is acceptable and what is not,’’ Juncker
said. ‘‘The fact that Mrs. Merkel was listened in to is not the
trigger for our vigorous reaction.’’  To contact the reporter on this story:
