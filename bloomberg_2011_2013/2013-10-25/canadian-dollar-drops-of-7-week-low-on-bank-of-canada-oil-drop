The Canadian dollar fell to a seven-week low against its U.S. counterpart with the Bank of  Canada 
embracing a more accommodative monetary policy and crude  oil
prices  heading for the biggest weekly decline since June.  The currency weakened for a third day after the central
bank said on Oct. 23 its economic growth forecast for this year
was cut to 1.6 percent from 1.8 percent. Crude oil, the nation’s
largest export, touched the lowest level since June yesterday.  “Markets are trading with a mild risk-off bias and that
may be translating into a little bit of caution on the commodity
currencies,”  Shaun Osborne , chief currency strategist at
Toronto-Dominion Bank’s TD Securities unit in Toronto, said by
phone.  The loonie, as the Canadian dollar is known for the image
of the aquatic bird on the C$1 coin, fell 0.2 percent to
C$1.0445 per  U.S. dollar  at 9:56 a.m. in Toronto, touching the
weakest since Sept. 6. One loonie buys 95.74 U.S. cents.  TD predicts the Canadian dollar will end the year at C$1.06
and will weaken to C$1.10 by late 2014, Osborne said.  Bond Trade  Canada’s benchmark 10-year government  bond  yields were
little changed at 2.42 percent. The 1.5 percent security
maturing in June 2023 added two cents to C$92.16.  Futures on crude oil rose 0.4 percent to $97.53 per barrel
in  New York , paring the 3.2 percent weekly loss. The discount
Canada’s benchmark crude oil-grade, Western Canada Select, faced
to West Texas Intermediate, its U.S. peer, was at $33 per
barrel, almost the biggest gap in three weeks.  The  Bank of Canada ’s policy statement this week dropped
language about the need for future interest rate increases,
repeated at every previous meeting since April 2012.  The change prompted TD Bank to push back its forecast for
the next rate rise to sometime in 2015 from two interest rate
increases in 2014, while Royal Bank of Canada, the nation’s
largest lender, updated its prediction to 2015, from the third
quarter of 2014. The median estimate of 15 economists in a
Bloomberg News survey conducted Oct. 23-24 targets a first
quarter 2015 rate rise, a delay of three months from the
previous consensus view in an Oct. 4-9 survey.  “The environment leaves the Canadian dollar exposed,”  Sue Trinh , a senior currency strategist at RBC in  Hong Kong , said in
a research report. “Oil market dynamics remain unsupportive and
the risks for the currency on this front are skewed to the
downside.”  The Canadian dollar has fallen 4.1 percent this year
against nine developed nation currencies tracked by the
Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Index. The Australian dollar is
down 7 percent, and the U.S. dollar has added 1.6 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
