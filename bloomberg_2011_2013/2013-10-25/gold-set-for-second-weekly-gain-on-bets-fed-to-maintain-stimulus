Gold futures advanced to the highest
in a month on speculation that the  Federal Reserve  will maintain
stimulus to boost economic growth.  U.S. orders to manufacturers unexpectedly dropped in
September, while consumer  sentiment  sank in October to a 10-month low, separate reports showed today. The dollar slid the
lowest in almost two years versus the euro. Chances that the Fed
will trim its $85 billion of monthly bond purchases have
“diminished greatly” on growth concerns, said Carl Tannenbaum,
the chief economist for  Northern Trust Corp. (NTRS)   “The belief that the Fed will have to maintain the pace of
stimulus is supporting gold and putting downward pressure on the
dollar,” David Lee, a vice president at Heraeus Precious Metals
Management in New York, said in a telephone interview.  Gold futures for December delivery gained 0.2 percent to
settle at $1,352.50 an ounce at 1:37 p.m. on the Comex in  New
York , after touching $1,356.40, the highest since Sept. 20. The
precious metal added 2.9 percent this week, the second straight
increase.  Bullion has declined 19 percent this year, set for the
first annual drop in 13 years, as some investors lost faith in
the metal as a store of value.  The metal rose 70 percent from December 2008 to June 2011
as the central bank pumped more than $2 trillion into the
financial system. Some investors buy gold and silver as a hedge
against accelerating consumer prices and protection against
currency weakness.  Silver futures for December delivery dropped 0.8 percent to
$22.639 an ounce in New York. Prices are down 25 percent this
year, the second-worst performer on the Standard & Poor’s GSCI
index of 24 raw materials.  On the  New York Mercantile Exchange , platinum futures for
January delivery fell less than 0.1 percent to $1,455.50 an
ounce. Palladium futures for December delivery rose less than
0.1 percent to $747.90 an ounce on the Nymex.  To contact the reporters on this story:
