Lithuania, the European Union’s
second-fastest  growing economy , had its credit rating outlook
raised by  Standard & Poor’s  on the “increasing likelihood” it
may adopt the euro in 2015.  The outlook on the BBB rating, the second-lowest investment
grade, was lifted to positive from stable, meaning “a one-in-three chance of an upgrade within the next 24 months,” S&P said
in a statement today.  It was S&P’s first increase of Lithuania’s rating outlook
since 2009, when it suffered the EU’s second-worst recession.
Lithuania will probably be the last Baltic country to adopt the
euro, with Estonia having joined the currency area in 2011 and
 Latvia  set to join in January.  “Lithuania is likely to build on its strong economic
performance, leading wealth levels to increase and budget
deficits to moderate and, in turn, increasing the likelihood of
it becoming the 19th eurozone member in 2015,” S&P said.  Euro adoption or continued fast economic growth could lead
to rating increases, S&P said. Economic growth accelerated to
3.8 percent in the second quarter from 3.5 percent in the first
three months this year.  “We believe the government will pursue tight fiscal
policies this year and next, given its desire to enter the
eurozone by 2015,” S&P said.  The economy will probably grow 3.8 percent this year before
accelerating to 4 percent in 2014-2016, the rating company said.
Exports, which account for close to 90 percent of GDP in 2013,
leave  Lithuania  “vulnerable to adverse economic developments in
its trading partners,” it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
