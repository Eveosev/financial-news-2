Rookie pitcher Michael Wacha got his
fourth straight victory this postseason as the St. Louis
Cardinals rallied to defeat the host Boston  Red Sox  4-2 and even
the  World Series  at one game apiece.  Carlos Beltran ’s run-scoring single capped a three-run
seventh inning for the Cardinals, who ended Boston’s streak of
nine consecutive World Series victories.  Game 3 of baseball’s best-of-seven championship series is
set for Oct. 26 at Busch Stadium in St. Louis.  The Cardinals tied the game in the seventh on a sacrifice
fly by Matt Carpenter and took a 3-2 lead on that same play
thanks to two Boston errors. Beltran followed with his single.  Beltran, 36, who bruised his ribs while crashing into the
Fenway Park outfield wall last night in Boston’s 8-1 victory in
the series opener, now has 13 runs batted in this postseason.  “Honestly, when I left the ballpark yesterday, I was
having little hope to be in the lineup,” Beltran said in a
televised interview. “I wanted to be in the lineup, I worked so
hard to get to this point. Somebody would have to kill me to get
me out of the lineup.”  David Ortiz  had given the Red Sox a 2-1 lead with a two-run
homer in the sixth inning off Wacha, who had allowed one run in
26 1/3 previous innings this postseason.  The Cardinals opened the scoring in the fourth inning on a
triple by  Matt Holliday  and a run-scoring groundout by Yadier Molina.  The losing pitcher was  John Lackey , who allowed three runs
on five hits in 6 1/3 innings. His previous World Series start
was in 2002 as a rookie for the Anaheim Angels, making him the
fifth pitcher in Major League Baseball history with 11 or more
years between World Series starts.  Streak Ends  The Red Sox were trying to join the  New York  Yankees as the
only teams in major league history to win 10 straight World
Series games. The Yankees have done it three times -- 14
straight wins from 1996-2000, 12 in a row from 1927-32 and 10
consecutive victories from 1937-41.  The Red Sox, who had 4-0 sweeps in their previous two World
Series appearances in 2004 and 2007, had not lost since Game 7
of their 1986 defeat by the New York Mets.  To contact the reporter on this story:
