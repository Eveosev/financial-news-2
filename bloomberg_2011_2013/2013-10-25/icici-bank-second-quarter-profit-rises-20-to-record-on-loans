  ICICI Bank Ltd. (ICICIBC) ,  India ’s second-largest lender by assets, posted a 20 percent increase in
second-quarter profit, beating analysts’ estimates as lending
margins expanded.  Net income  climbed to a record 23.5 billion rupees ($382
million), or 20.33 rupees a share, for the three months ended
Sept. 30, from 19.6 billion rupees, or 16.91 rupees, a year
earlier, Mumbai-based ICICI said in an exchange filing today.
That surpassed the 21.4 billion rupee median of 43 analyst
 estimates  compiled by Bloomberg.  ICICI, led by Chief Executive Officer  Chanda Kochhar ,
expanded its loan book by 16 percent in the quarter as lower
corporate lending rates helped win more companies after central
bank measures to bolster the rupee caused money-market rates to
surge. An increase in low-cost retail deposits allowed the bank
to expand lending margins.  “The sharp expansion in margins surprised everybody,”
Nitin Kumar, Mumbai-based banking analyst at Quant Broking Ltd.,
said by phone. “The large share of low-cost deposits and retail
lending is helping them.”  Shares of ICICI rose 0.1 percent to 1,022.2 rupees in
Mumbai. The stock slumped 10 percent this year, less than the
S&P BSE Bankex Index’s 13 percent drop.  Wider Margins  Net interest margin, a measure of lending profitability,
expanded to 3.3 percent from 3 percent a year earlier, the
lender said in an e-mailed statement.  “We expect the margins to remain above 3.3 percent for the
financial year,” Kochhar said in a conference call with
reporters today. “An increasing share of retail deposits will
help in margin improvement.”  Comparatively lower lending rates helped ICICI weather the
surge in interbank borrowing costs that followed the  Reserve
Bank  of India raising the price at which it supplies cash to
lenders on July 15.  The three-month  interbank  offered rate has climbed 131
basis points since to 9.52 percent today. It touched a four-year
high of 11.59 percent on Sept. 4. ICICI’s base rate, below which
the bank doesn’t lend, is set at 10 percent.  The bank’s net interest income, or revenue from lending
minus payments on deposits, rose 20 percent to 40 billion
rupees.  Savings Accounts  Low-cost deposits, comprising of funds in current and
savings accounts for which ICICI pays a lower rate of interest
than on bulk deposits, formed 43.3 percent of the bank’s funding
as of Sept. 30, the statement shows. That compared with 40.7
percent a year earlier.  Total outstanding loans at ICICI increased by 16 percent to
3.2 trillion rupees at the end of September from a year earlier.
Loans to individuals grew by 22 percent, while those to
companies rose 11 percent, Kochhar said on the conference call.
Lending to individuals accounted for 36 percent of ICICI’s total
loans at the end of September, she said.  Loans at Indian lenders grew almost 18 percent in the 12
months to Oct. 4, fortnightly central bank  data  show. That
compares with an 18.2 percent expansion in the year to Sept. 6,
which was the fastest pace in 15 months.  The bank’s net bad-loan ratio widened to 0.85 percent from
0.78 percent a year earlier, according to the statement. Bad
loans at Indian lenders swelled to 3.9 percent of total loans as
of June. 30, the highest in at least six years, data compiled by
the central bank show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
