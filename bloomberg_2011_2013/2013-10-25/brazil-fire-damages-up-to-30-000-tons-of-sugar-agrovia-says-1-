A fire at a warehouse in Santa
Adelia,  Brazil , damaged between 25,000 and 30,000 tons of sugar
and destroyed a storage building, according to the head of the
logistics company responsible for the storage room.  Firemen prevented the fire from spreading to a second
storage unit, said Guilherme Raposo, chief executive of Agrovia
logistics company. There were no injuries, he said.  “We sent a crew to the city to evaluate damages and see
which company’s sugar was affected,” Raposo said in a phone
interview from Sao Paulo. “We are already working to have the
second unit’s service reestablished as soon as possible.”  Tereos Internacional SA (TERI3) ’s Guarani SA said in an e-mail that
it is assessing the damage at the site. The sugar was insured
and the sweetener at the location accounts for less than 1
percent of total sales, the company said. Daniel Friend, a
spokesman for ED&F Man Holdings Ltd., which owns a stake in
Agrovia, declined to comment by e-mail today.  On Oct. 18, five warehouses at Santos Port caught fire,
destroying 180,000 tons of the sweetener. Sugar prices rose 0.11
percent in  New York  trading at 11:18 a.m. to 18.99 cents a
pound.  To contact the reporter on this story:
