Hungary ’s credit rating was affirmed
at non-investment grade with a negative outlook by  Standard &
Poor’s , which cited “weak” growth prospects and high debt.  S&P kept its BB/B long- and short-term sovereign credit
ratings stable on Hungary, where “weakened” institutional
checks and balances and policies that may increase the
probability of exchange rate depreciation could weigh on growth
and raise debt burdens, S&P said in a statement today.  “Hungary’s creditworthiness continues to be constrained by
the economy’s weak growth prospects, limited monetary
flexibility, and high stocks of public and private external
debt,” S&P said in the statement.  Hungarian Prime Minister  Viktor Orban , who is trying to win
re-election next year, is seeking to fortify the economy’s
recovery from last year’s  recession  while keeping the  budget
deficit  below the European Union ceiling of 3 percent of
economic output.  “The outlook remains negative, reflecting at least a one-in-three chance of a downgrade if the policy framework lessens
confidence and medium-term economic growth prospects, or
significantly raises financing costs and leaves the country
exposed to sharply diminished capital inflow,” S&P said.  The forint was little changed at 292.27 against the euro at
8:12 a.m. in Budapest. The currency has firmed 1.9 percent in
the past three months, the best performance among 24 emerging-market currencies tracked by Bloomberg.  Hungary is rated Ba1 at Moody’s and BB+ at  Fitch Ratings ,
both non-investment grades.  To contact the reporter on this story:
