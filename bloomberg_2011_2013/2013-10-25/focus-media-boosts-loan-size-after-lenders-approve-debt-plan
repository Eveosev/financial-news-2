Focus Media Holding Ltd. expanded a
loan that backed the Carlyle Group LP-led takeover of the
Chinese digital advertising company after getting approval to
refinance debt for paying dividends, two people familiar with
the matter said.  The development increases the size of the borrowing to
$1.275 billion from $1.075 billion, the people said. Lenders
authorized a plan for a $500 million five-year dividend
recapitalization facility that allows the companyâ€™s owners to
pay themselves dividends, according to the people, who asked not
to be identified because details are private.  That borrowing comprises a $200 million term facility in
addition to a $300 million stand-by letter of credit, which is
not counted toward the expanded loan amount, the people said.
China Minsheng Banking Corp. took the entire $300 million
tranche of the new debt as a bilateral loan, according to the
people.  Carlyle and a group of investors raised the $1.075 billion
syndicated loan this year to fund their $3.7 billion buyout of
Focus Media, in the biggest leveraged buyout of a Chinese
company.  Jing Lu, a Shanghai-based spokeswoman for Focus Media,
declined to comment on the loan when contacted by phone today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
