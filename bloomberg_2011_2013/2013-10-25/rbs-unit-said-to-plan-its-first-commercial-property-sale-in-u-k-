Royal Bank of Scotland Group PLC  is
seeking to sell a portfolio of U.K. warehouses valued at about
65 million pounds ($105 million) in what would be the first U.K.
commercial property sale by its distressed asset unit, two
people with knowledge of the matter said.  West Register, an RBS unit that takes over or buys
properties in foreclosure, appointed broker  Jones Lang LaSalle
Inc. (JLL)  to sell the 28 warehouses throughout the U.K., said the
people, who asked not to be identified because the information
is private. A sale at 65 million pounds would generate a yield
of 9.5 percent, one of the people said.  Erfan Hussain, a spokesman for Edinburgh-based RBS,
declined to comment. No one authorized to comment at Jones Lang
was immediately available.  RBS has shrunk its balance sheet by more than 900 billion
pounds since its state-funded bailout in 2008 and the amount of
assets the bank plans to sell or wind down declined to 45
billion pounds at the end of the second quarter from 258 billion
pounds. Industrial properties and other commerical real estate
assets outside  London  are gaining appeal as investors look for
returns that beat the U.K. capital.  Property Week reported the news earlier today.  To contact the reporters on this story:
