Cliffs Natural Resources Inc. (CLF) , the
biggest U.S. iron-ore producer, hired Gary Halverson from
 Barrick Gold Corp. (ABX)  to be its next chief executive officer.  Halverson, 55, formerly interim chief operating officer at
Barrick, will start Nov. 18 as president and chief operating
officer before eventually assuming the CEO role, Cleveland-based
Cliffs said today in a statement. Cliffs CEO Joseph Carrabba,
who announced his retirement in July, will leave Nov. 15.  Cliffs also said James Kirsch, currently non-executive
chairman, will become executive chairman and lead the change in
leadership. Kirsch, the former CEO of U.S. chemicals producer
producer Ferro Corp. who was elected to the Cliffs board in
June, will also focus on Cliffs’ long-term strategy in the
coming months, according to the statement.  In February, Cliffs cut its quarterly dividend by 76
percent and raised $995 million selling equity after iron-ore
prices plunged. Cliffs said in November it was postponing the
expansion of its Bloom Lake mine in  Canada , an asset the company
acquired when it bought Consolidated Thompson Iron Ore Mines
Ltd. for C$4.24 billion ($4.06 billion) in 2011. Cliffs wrote
down the value of the Consolidated Thompson assets by $1 billion
in the fourth quarter of 2012.  Cliffs rose 6 percent to $24.99 at the close in  New York .
The shares have declined 35 percent this year.  Halverson led Toronto-based Barrick’s North American
 operations , which include 10 mines and 6,200 employees, Cliffs
said. He has also managed mines in Australia and  Papua New
Guinea .  To contact the reporter on this story:
