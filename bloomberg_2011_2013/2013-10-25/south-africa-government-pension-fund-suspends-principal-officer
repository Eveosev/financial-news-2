Pension Fund, which manages more than 1 trillion rand ($101.7
billion), suspended Principal Executive Officer John Oliphant
before a disciplinary inquiry relating to supplier contracts.  “An independent chairperson, who is also an advocate, will
oversee the disciplinary hearing,” GEPF’s Chairman of the Board
of Trustees Arthur Moloto said in an e-mailed statement today.
That follows a forensic investigation of “supply-chain
management practices,” he said.  Oliphant, who was named “Up and Coming Future Leader of
the Year” at the Africa investor Investment and Business Leader
Awards this month, was due to stay in his position until June
2017 after arriving in March. Joelene Moodley, head of corporate
services, will act as principal executive officer in the
interim, Moloto said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
