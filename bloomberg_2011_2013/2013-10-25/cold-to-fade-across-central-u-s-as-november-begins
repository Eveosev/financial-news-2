Colder weather is expected to fade
across the central and eastern U.S. as November begins,
according to  MDA Weather Services .  Temperatures are expected to be 3 to 5 degrees Fahrenheit
(1.7 to 2.8 Celsius) above normal across the Great Plains and
into the South from Nov. 4 to Nov. 8, said MDA, based in
Gaithersburg,  Maryland .  “Cold threats are greatly diminished in this period,
though some cooler potential remains in the models from the
upper Midwest to Northeast,” MDA’s forecast said. “But any
cold here is expected to lack strong intensity and any
significant staying power.”  Below-normal temperatures, especially in Eastern and
Midwestern cities, tend to increase energy consumption as more
people turn up thermostats to heat homes and businesses.
November marks the start of the U.S. heating season, when
natural gas demand peaks.  Power generation accounts for 32 percent of U.S. gas use,
according to the Energy Information Administration, the Energy
Department’s statistical arm. About 49 percent of all homes use
the fuel for heating.  Currently, temperatures from  Chicago  to the East Coast are
about 3 to 5 degrees below normal, MDA said. Freeze and frost
warnings and watches were posted from eastern Oklahoma to the
Atlantic coasts of Virginia and  North Carolina  overnight,
according to the  National Weather Service .  The normal average temperature in New York for Nov. 3 is
about 53 degrees, MDA said. In Boston, it’s 48; in  St. Louis ,
53;  Dallas , 62; Chicago, 47; in Burbank, California, 64; and in
Calgary it’s 33.  To contact the reporter on this story:
