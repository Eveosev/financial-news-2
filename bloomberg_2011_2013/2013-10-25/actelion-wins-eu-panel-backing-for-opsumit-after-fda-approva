Actelion Ltd. (ATLN)  won backing from a
European Union advisory panel for its lung drug Opsumit, a week
after winning U.S. approval for the same pill.  Opsumit, also known as macitentan, was recommended by the
European Medicines Agency’s Committee for Medicinal Products for
Human Use for the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension,
the agency said in a  statement  today. The European Commission,
the EU’s executive arm, usually follows the panel’s
recommendation.  Actelion is trading near a six-year high after winning
approval for Opsumit from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration
on Oct. 18. Sales of the drug will reach 993.8 million Swiss
francs ($1.1 billion) in 2017, according to the average of six
analyst  estimates  compiled by Bloomberg. That will help replace
declining revenue for Tracleer, the treatment that accounts for
87 percent of sales and starts losing patent protection in 2015.  Chief Executive Officer Jean-Paul Clozel has bet the future
of the company he co-founded on Opsumit, including fighting off
a hedge fund that sought seats on the board and wanted the
company to consider selling itself in 2011.  Actelion fell 0.2 percent to 69.20 Swiss francs as of 2:47
p.m. in Zurich, giving the company a market value of 8.3 billion
francs. The stock has returned 62 percent this year, including
reinvested dividends,  compared  with a 23 percent return for the
Bloomberg Europe Pharmaceuticals Index.  Actelion expects the EC to grant marketing authorization
for the drug in two months, the company said in a statement
today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
