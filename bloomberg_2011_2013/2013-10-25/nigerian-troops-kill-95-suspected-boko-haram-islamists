At least 95 suspected Boko Haram
members were killed in two separate raids on the Islamists’
camps in the northeast as part of a renewed offensive by
Nigerian security forces, military spokesmen said.  “The operation which involved ground and aerial assault
supported by the Nigerian Air Force led to the destruction of
the identified terrorists’ camp, killing 74 terrorists while
others fled with serious injuries,” Nigerian Army spokesman
Lieutenant-Colonel Mohammed Dole, said today in an e-mailed
statement from the northeastern city of Maiduguri. Two soldiers
were wounded during the operation in Galangi and Lawanti
villages in Borno state, he said.  Separately, 21 suspected Boko Haram members were also
killed in Damaturu, capital of the northeastern Yobe state,
after a shootout with security forces late yesterday, Eli
Lazarus, a military spokesman, said today in an e-mailed
statement. He didn’t provide further details.  Boko Haram, whose name means “Western education is a sin”
in the Hausa language, has carried out gun and bomb attacks in
 Nigeria ’s mainly Muslim north and the capital, killing thousands
of people since 2009 in its campaign to establish an Islamic
state in Nigeria. In 2011, the group detonated a suicide car
bomb at the United Nations headquarters in Abuja.  Troops began an air and ground offensive against the
militants on May 16, in a campaign that included bombing their
camps by planes two days after Nigerian President  Goodluck
Jonathan  declared emergency rule on the northeastern states of
Adamawa, Borno and Yobe. Jonathan said the measure was necessary
because the insurgents had taken over parts of Borno state.  To contact the reporters on this story:
