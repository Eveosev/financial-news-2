Legg Mason Inc. (LM) , the  money manager 
that has struggled with more than five years of net redemptions,
said fiscal second-quarter profit rose 6.8 percent as a market
rally lifted assets and fees tied to performance rose.  Net income  increased to $86.3 million, or 70 cents a share,
in the three months ended Sept. 30, from $80.8 million, or 60
cents, a year earlier, the Baltimore-based firm said today in a
statement. Earnings in the quarter included a tax benefit of 16
cents a share, compared with 13 cents in the year-earlier
period. Fifteen analysts surveyed by Bloomberg  estimated 
earnings averaging 62 cents a share.  Joseph A. Sullivan, 55, named chief executive officer in
February, has vowed to stem withdrawals by focusing on Legg
Mason’s product lineup and improving performance, while
reorganizing businesses to cut costs. Clients pulled $4 billion
from the firm’s stock funds while depositing $300 million into
its bond vehicles and $2.3 billion into its money funds. Long-term net deposits into Legg Mason’s Western Asset Management
bond unit were the first since September 2007, Sullivan said
today during a conference call with investors.  “Fixed-income inflows were better than expectations,”
Daniel Fannon, an analyst at Jefferies & Co. in  San Francisco ,
said today in a note to clients. “Performance fees and expense
controls drove the majority of the beat” as well as a lower  tax
rate , he said.  Manager Redemptions  Legg Mason shares rose 2.8 percent to close at $37.91 in
 New York . The  stock  increased 47 percent this year, compared
with the 35 percent gain in the Standard & Poor’s 20-member
index of custody banks and asset managers. The shares have
declined more than 70 percent from their peak of $136.40 in
February 2006.  U.S. money managers were hurt by investor redemptions in
the third quarter after concerns that the  Federal Reserve  will
scale back its asset purchases triggered a flight from bonds and
investors continued to shy away from active stock-picking.  T. Rowe Price Group Inc. (TROW)  said yesterday that clients
withdrew a net $7.4 billion, marking the second straight quarter
of redemptions for the Baltimore-based company.  Franklin
Resources Inc. (BEN) , the  San Mateo , California-based asset manager,
said investors withdrew $2.7 billion and  AllianceBernstein
Holding LP (AB)  said investors removed a net $4.8 billion.  Legg Mason, whose assets peaked at $1 trillion in 2007 as
investors flocked to funds run by top-ranked managers such as
 Bill Miller , oversaw $656 billion at the end of September, a 0.8
percent increase from a year earlier and a 1.8 percent climb
from the previous quarter. About 54 percent of the assets were
in fixed income. The MSCI ACWI Index of global stocks rose 7.4
percent in the quarter and 15 percent in the year through Sept.
30.  First Deposits  In the quarter ended June 30, the firm had its first net
deposits since 2007 into long-term funds, which exclude short-dated assets such as money-market accounts.  “We’ve come a long way over this past year of
transition,” Sullivan, who became interim CEO in October 2012,
said during a conference call today with analysts and investors.
“We’re all very pleased, but we’re not satisfied.”  Legg Mason said last month it would incur about $10 million
in  severance  and other costs in each of the quarters ending
Sept. 30 and Dec. 31 tied to closing and reorganizing
businesses. The reorganization includes closing Legg Mason’s
 emerging-markets  equity unit, Esemplia Emerging Markets, and
transitioning the client-services business in  Canada  to the
firm’s affiliates. Following the changes, Legg Mason said it
expects to see about $2.5 million in net increases in quarterly
pretax earnings, beginning in the three months ending March 31.  Higher Assets  Revenue increased 4.6 percent to $669.9 million compared
with a year earlier, on higher average equity assets under
management and performance fees, which climbed 69 percent to
$17.3 million. Operating expenses rose 0.5 percent to $563.5
million compared with a year earlier, driven by higher
distribution expenses and the restructuring costs.  The firm’s stock assets rose 10 percent to $169.5 billion
in the year ended Sept. 30. Bond assets, managed mostly by
Western Asset, fell 3.9 percent to $355 billion and money funds
increased 2.8 percent to $131.5 billion.  BlackRock Inc. (BLK) , the world’s largest asset manager, said
Oct. 16 its third-quarter net income rose 14 percent to $730
million. Investors deposited a net $25 billion into the New
York-based firm, driven by flows to equity exchange-traded
funds.  To contact the reporter on this story:
