Japan said it received expressions
of interest from 779 companies and individuals with technology
to help contain radioactive water leaks at the wrecked nuclear
plant in Fukushima after the government launched a global
appeal.  Japan made the appeal between Sept. 25 and Oct. 23 through
the International Research Institute for Nuclear
Decommissioning, formed in August to support the plant operator
 Tokyo Electric Power Co. (9501) , according to a statement by the
coutry’s trade ministry. About 30 percent of the proposals come
from overseas, ministry official Yoji Ueda said today at a
briefing.　  The technology ranges from separating tritium from
radioactive water to building ice walls to stem contaminated
water flows into the ocean, according to the statement. Prime
Minister Shinzo Abe last month vowed to end the nation’s “ad
hoc” response to the disaster. The government said it would
spend 47 billion yen ($484 million) to stop the leaks.  IRID was formed in August by a group of 17 Japanese
companies, including  Toshiba Corp. (6502)  and  Mitsubishi Heavy
industries Ltd (7011)  to support efforts by Tepco, as the utility is
known.  To contact the reporters on this story:
