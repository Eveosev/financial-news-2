CA Technologies (CA) , a maker of software
for managing  information technology , rose the most since January
2012 after quarterly sales and profit topped analysts’
estimates.  CA’s stock jumped 5.5 percent to $32.07 at 9:34 a.m. in New
York. The shares, already up 38 percent this year before today,
rose as high as $32.95 earlier in the session.  Excluding some items, earnings rose to 86 cents a share in
the fiscal second quarter, the Islandia, New York-based company
said yesterday in a statement. Analysts had projected 72 cents,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Sales totaled $1.14
billion in the period, which ended on Sept. 30, beating the
average estimate of $1.1 billion.  The results give a boost to the turnaround efforts of Chief
Executive Officer Mike Gregoire, who joined the East Coast
software maker in January after a career in Silicon Valley. He
is increasing research and marketing spending in bid to jump-start growth with new products.  “This is clearly a beginning, but we still have work to do
to get the aggregate portfolio growing,” he said in the
statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
