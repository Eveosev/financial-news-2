Private Elise Toft became the first
Norwegian woman to be awarded a combat medal since World War II,
honored for efforts during fighting in  Afghanistan  in 2011.  Toft, 23, was honored in Oslo along with four colleagues
for “heroic efforts,” the Norwegian Armed Forces said in a
statement today. She displayed “courage and determination
beyond what might be expected in a very dangerous situation,”
the military said.  The soldiers were attacked by insurgents in Afghanistan
while searching for roadside bombs, according to a report by
state broadcaster NRK.  Norway has about 140 soldiers still active in Afghanistan
as part of the International Security Assistance Force and UN
efforts. A total of 10 Norwegian soldiers have died in
Afghanistan since 2001.  To contact the reporter on this story:
