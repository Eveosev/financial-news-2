Serbia’s economy will grow less than
expected this year and next due to a shortage of major
investments and weak consumption, a Bloomberg survey showed.  Gross domestic product will grow 1.5 percent next year on
an annual basis and 2.4 percent the following year, according to
the median estimate of 13 economists in the poll conducted Oct.
18-23. Those forecasts were weaker than estimates of 1.8 percent
and 2.8 percent in the previous poll.  “The contribution of net exports will be weaker, imports
will pick up as a result of some investments and there will be a
moderate increase in personal consumption,” Andrej Knez, senior
analyst with Hypo Alpe Adria d.d. bank in Zagreb, said by phone.
Growth this year, curbed by weak domestic consumption, has been
driven by net exports rather than investment, he said.  Serbia, which expects to open accession talks with the
European Union in January, is still recovering from two
recessions in three years. The country’s Fiscal Council, a
three-member body overseeing government fiscal compliance, said
on Oct. 14 the economy will stagnate or grow 0.5 percent in 2014
as car, oil and agriculture production lose steam.  To contact the reporters on this story:
