Credit Suisse Group AG (CSGN) , the second-largest Swiss bank, named Garrett Curran to replace James Leigh-Pemberton as chief executive officer of its British unit.  Curran will take the role in addition to his existing
responsibilities as head of fixed-income sales for Europe,
 Middle East  and  Africa  and chief client officer for the region,
Gael de Boissard, co-head of the investment bank, said in a memo
to employees today, which was confirmed by a Credit Suisse
spokeswoman in London.  “Our U.K. business represents our largest client franchise
in EMEA,” said de Boissard in the memo. “It is strategically
important to the integrated bank, as a market area and hub for
our investment bank and private banking and wealth-management
activities in Western Europe.”  Curran, 41, who ran  Dresdner Kleinwort ’s global finance
business until May 2007, joined Credit Suisse in London in 2008.
U.K. Financial Investments Ltd., which manages Britain’s stakes
in banks, hired Leigh-Pemberton last month to be its executive
chairman as the government prepares to cut its holdings.  Credit Suisse, based in Zurich, yesterday posted a smaller
increase in third-quarter profit than analysts estimated as
earnings at the investment bank tumbled on lower revenue from
debt sales and trading.  To contact the reporters on this story:
