OAO Lukoil (LKOH) , Russia’s second-largest
oil producer, pumped the first oil from the West Qurna-2 project
in Iraq and expects to start sales this year, helping the war-ravaged nation expand output and rebuild its energy industry.  Well 139, completed by U.S. contractor  Baker Hughes Inc. (BHI) ,
produced high-quality light oil following perforation, Lukoil’s
overseas arm said in its corporate  magazine .  Iraq overtook Iran last year as the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries’ second-largest crude exporter
after Saudi Arabia, as it recovers from years of war. Output
from West Qurna-2, one of the nation’s largest oilfields, will
increase to 400,000 barrels a day by the end of 2014, Lukoil
Chief Executive Officer Vagit Alekperov said last month.  Russia ’s largest oil producer is state-run OAO Rosneft.  To contact the reporter on this story:
