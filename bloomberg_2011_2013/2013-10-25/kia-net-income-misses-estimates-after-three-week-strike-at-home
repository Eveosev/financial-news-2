Kia Motors Corp. (000270) , South Korea’s
second-largest carmaker, reported profit missed estimates after
a three-week strike at home cut production and a stronger won
curbed the company’s competitiveness in the U.S.  Third-quarter  net income  rose 8.9 percent to 903.3 billion
won ($850 million) from 829.5 billion won a year earlier, the
Seoul-based company said today. That missed the 943.5 billion
won average of 31 analysts’ estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  A three-week strike at home cost the company an estimated
414 billion won in lost production, while sales in the quarter
slumped 4.9 percent in the U.S., the carmaker’s biggest market,
according to the company’s website. Kia, together with its
biggest shareholder  Hyundai Motor Co. (005380) , is facing increased
competition as a weaker yen gives Japanese carmakers an edge in
the U.S.  “Strikes at home and falling sales in key overseas markets
would have had an adverse impact on Kia’s earnings,” Lee Sang Hyun, an analyst at NH Investment & Securities Co., said before
the earnings announcement. “The company is expected to make up
for the loss from the strikes in the fourth quarter, and will be
able to meet the annual target.”  The automaker forecast in January that deliveries will rise
1.1 percent to 2.75 million vehicles this year.  Kia’s  shares  rose 0.5 percent to 63,600 won as of 10:08
a.m. in Seoul trading. The benchmark Kospi Index slid 0.7
percent.  Union Strikes  Kia’s union workers in  South Korea  approved a wage deal on
Sept. 12 that raised the monthly base salary by 97,000 won,
ending strikes which caused more than 23,000 vehicles or 414
billion won worth in lost output, according to company
estimates.  The stoppages, which began Aug. 21, led the automaker’s
quarterly production in South Korea to be the smallest since
last year’s third-quarter, according to the company’s website.
About 58 percent of Kia’s  manufacturing capacity  is located at
home. A strike last year, the company’s first since 2009, had
caused a record 62,890 vehicles in lost output. It had cut Kia’s
production in South Korea by 9.2 percent.  The won has gained 25 percent against the yen in the past
year, curbing Kia and Hyundai’s competitiveness against Japanese
automakers, which are also big exporters to the U.S.  Slowing Sales  Kia’s incentives in the U.S. jumped 12 percent through
September from a year earlier. That compares with a 2.2 percent
decline in Toyota’s incentives and the market average of a 2.4
percent increase, according to Autodata Corp.  The company’s sales fell 4.9 percent in the U.S. market
last quarter, according to its  website . Its deliveries rose 1.5
percent in  Europe  in the July to September quarter.  Sales in  China  rose 9.8 percent to 131,410 units in the
last quarter, trailing behind the market average of 14 percent
increase, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Competition
is expected to intensify as Japanese automakers including  Toyota
Motor Corp. (7203)  and Nissan Motor Co. rebound from declining sales
that began last year after a territorial dispute led to violent
anti-Japan protests in the world’s biggest auto market.  To contact the reporter on this story:
