GAIL India Ltd. (GAIL) , the nationâ€™s
biggest natural gas distributor, reported a 7 percent decline in
second-quarter profit after it made a loss on cooking gas sales.  Net income  dropped to 9.16 billion rupees ($149 million),
or 7.22 rupees a share, in the three months ended Sept. 30,
compared with 9.85 billion rupees, or 7.77 rupees, a year
earlier, the New Delhi-based company said in a statement today.
That missed the 9.27 billion-rupee median  estimate  of 36
analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. Net sales rose 23 percent to
139.4 billion rupees.  GAIL fell 2.4 percent to 343.60 rupees at the close in
Mumbai. The shares have dropped 3.7 percent this year, compared
with a 6.5 percent gain in the benchmark  S&P BSE Sensex. (SENSEX)   The company reported a 2.3 billion-rupee loss before
interest and tax on liquefied petroleum gas and liquid
hydrocarbon sales in the quarter, compared with a 664.6 million-rupee profit a year earlier. Pretax earnings from gas
transmission dropped to 5.8 billion rupees from 6 billion rupees
a year earlier.  The company gave 6.99 billion rupees as subsidy on cooking
gas sales to state-run refiners including  Indian Oil Corp. (IOCL)  in
the period, compared with 7.86 billion year earlier, according
to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
