Petroleo Brasileiro SA (PETR4) , the state-controlled oil producer, rose as it reported output climbed
after starting the operation of four new platforms in September.  Petrobras, as the Rio de Janeiro-based company is known,
 added  1.4 percent to 18.49 reais at the close of trading in Sao
Paulo, extending its weekly gain to 3.1 percent. The Ibovespa
stock gauge fell 1.3 percent today.  Oil output rose 3.7 percent last month from August to 1.98
million barrels per day, the highest since December, after the
new drilling sites came on line, the company said today in an e-mailed statement. Petrobras’s total crude production has fallen
2.8 percent this year to 17.3 billion barrels.  September’s increase shows the positive impact of the
platforms, Karina Freitas and Daniela Martins, analysts at Sao
Paulo-based brokerage firm Concordia, wrote in a research note.
“Those benefits will be better observed next year, when many of
these units will reach production peaks,” they wrote.  Petrobras is scheduled to release its third-quarter
earnings report today after the market closes. The average
estimate among seven analysts surveyed by Bloomberg is for
adjusted net income to climb 3.8 percent from the same period in
2012 to 7.86 billion reais ($3.59 billion).  To contact the reporter on this story:
