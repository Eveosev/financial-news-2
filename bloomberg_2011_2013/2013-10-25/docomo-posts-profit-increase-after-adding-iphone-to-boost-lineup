NTT Docomo Inc. (9437) ,  Japan ’s largest
mobile-phone operator, posted an increase in quarterly net
income after adding Apple Inc.’s iPhones to bolster its lineup.  Net income  rose to 142.4 billion yen ($1.5 billion) in the
three months ended Sept. 30, the Tokyo-based company said in a
statement today. That beat the 133 billion-yen average of three
 analyst estimates  compiled by Bloomberg.  The company in September started selling iPhones, the most
popular brand in the nation, while also offering discounts on
other models such as Sony Corp.’s Xperia Z1 to lure users of
Android-based handsets. Docomo is using cost reductions to boost
earnings as Japan’s wireless market nears saturation.  “Docomo was once the only carrier with brand power,” said
Daisaku Masuno, an analyst at Nomura Holdings Inc. “Now, the
three major operators offer similar levels of services and a
variety of handsets and are all investing to improve their
networks. It’s going to be neck and neck competition.”  The wireless operator lost 66,800 net users in September,
the biggest subscriber loss on record. SoftBank added 270,700
and KDDI gained 232,700 users during the month. Docomo still
dominates the Japanese market in cumulative market share with
44.6 percent.  The company maintained its forecasts for full-year
operating profit of 840 billion yen and net income of 510
billion yen.  To contact the reporters on this story:
