During the run-up to health-care reform, a lot of people went looking for what I dubbed “the magic pot of money.” It would be a large expense that could be cut out of the health-care system with very little political pain because it would not cause anyone to miss out on life-saving (or life-enhancing) treatment, and it also did not come attached to a large and powerful interest group that would fight like deranged weasels to save their pet benefit. There were many candidates for the role of “magic pot of money”: Medicare Advantage overpayments, preventive medicine, uncompensated care provided to the uninsured, electronic medical records, fighting obesity, ending unnecessary treatment and so forth. One by one, most of these turned out to be less promising than they had initially seemed. Medicare Advantage “overpayments” turned out to be  providing extra benefits  to those enrolled, and so far the administration has  chickened out  whenever the time has actually come to make deep cuts. Uncompensated hospital care turns out to be a small fraction of U.S. health-care costs (about  $40 billion  on total spending of more than  $2.7 trillion ), and it also  didn’t fall as far as people had expected  in Massachusetts. Preventive medicine turned out to  raise costs , not cut them (whatever its other benefits for patients). No one knows how to make people thin. And so we were left with overtreatment. Everyone agrees that we treat people too much. Unnecessary back surgery is almost always Exhibit A: Most studies show that you’re better off with physical therapy. I was very fond of castigating back surgeons about this (though not to their faces). And then one day, after a panel where I mentioned the epidemic of unnecessary back surgery, a nice middle-age fellow came up to me. Awkwardly, he turned out to be a back surgeon. “Do you think we don’t read the studies?” he said. “We know physical therapy is better for you than most back surgery. What we don’t know is how to make sure that the patients go through with physical therapy.” I was reminded of this moment when I read Lisa Rosenbaum’s  excellent article  in this week’s New Yorker, in which she chronicles her attempt to follow “best practices” with regard to arterial stents, whose overuse has recently become Exhibit B in the overtreatment oeuvre:  A patient of Rosenbaum's, a grocer, came into the emergency room with heart pain; he was diagnosed with a heart attack, and a stent was put in to open up a blocked artery. All the guidelines indicated conservative management: medication and lifestyle changes -- and a single stent, not several stents, as many patients walked out with. So that’s what she prescribed. But her patient, who didn’t speak much English, didn’t show up for follow-up visits to have his condition carefully monitored. When she saw him again, she realized that he’d stopped moving because of his chest pain, causing him to waste. Eventually, he visited another doctor closer to his home, who put in another stent -- and clearly made the patient feel better. Rosenbaum writes: A study just published in the New England Journal of Medicine showed that, contra the guidelines she was following, preventive stenting does seem to save lives and improve patient outcomes. Is this to say that there is no way to save money in health care without hurting patients? Of course not. But we should be wary of asserting that it will be easy to save money without hurting patients as long as we simply follow the best evidence. Studies are, of course, the foundation of science. But they also have limits. The questions they can answer are often much narrower than the questions we would like to answer -- and often other studies give different answers. There’s a decent amount of evidence that hospitals which do more intensive interventions get better outcomes. Magic pots of money are very hard to find. Science can hopefully point the way … but probably not without a lot of false starts.
