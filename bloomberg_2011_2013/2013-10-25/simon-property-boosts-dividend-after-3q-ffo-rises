Simon Property Group Inc. (SPG) , the
largest U.S. shopping-mall owner, reported a 12 percent gain in
third-quarter funds from operations and raised its 2013 FFO
forecast as demand for space in outlet centers climbed.  FFO, which gauges a property company’s ability to generate
cash, rose to $803 million, or $2.21 a share, from $720 million,
or $1.99, a year earlier, the Indianapolis-based real estate
investment trust said today in a statement. The  average  of 22
analyst estimates was $2.16 a share, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg. The REIT declared a $1.20 per share dividend, a 5
cent boost from the previous quarter and a 9.1 percent year-over-year increase, according to the statement.  Simon is benefiting as retailers seek space in outlet
centers, where brand-name items are sold at a discount. Rents
and occupancies also are increasing at regional malls, where
tenants are competing for limited space. Simon is renovating and
expanding its properties and developing new outlet centers to
boost growth, and has stakes in Paris-based Klepierre SA and
McArthurGlen Group,  Europe ’s biggest outlet-center operator.  “The existing portfolio, whether it’s the malls or the
outlet centers, will see strong rental growth because there’s so
much demand for space of that quality,”  Rich Moore , an analyst
at  RBC Capital Markets  in Solon,  Ohio , said in a telephone
interview before earnings were announced. “They have myriad
ways to make money.”  Expanding Retail  Domestic and international retailers are adding locations
and expanding new store concepts, providing a boost to their
U.S. landlords, Nathan Isbee and Jennifer Hummert, analysts at
Stifel Nicolaus & Co., wrote in a report yesterday.  Simon’s revenue increased about 6 percent from a year
earlier to $1.3 billion. Occupancy at the company’s U.S.
properties climbed to 95.5 percent from 94.6 percent. Simon’s
12-month trailing tenant sales per square foot rose 3 percent to
$579 a square foot. The base minimum rent climbed 3.5 percent to
$41.73 from $40.33 in the third quarter.  The company raised its estimate of FFO for the year to
$8.72 to $8.78 a share, up from a July forecast of $8.60 to
$8.70 a share. The average of 24 analyst estimates is $8.75.  Earnings were announced before U.S. markets opened. Simon
rose 1.1 percent to $160.50 yesterday. The shares have gained
1.5 percent this year, compared with a 6.6 percent advance for
the Bloomberg Real Estate Investment Trust Index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
