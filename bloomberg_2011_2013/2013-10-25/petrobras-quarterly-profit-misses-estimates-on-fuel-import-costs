Petroleo Brasileiro SA (PETR4) , Brazil’s
state-controlled oil producer, said third-quarter profit slid 40
percent, missing analysts’ estimates, on higher fuel imports and
refining losses.  Net income  dropped to 3.39 billion reais ($1.55 billion),
or 26 centavos a share, from 5.66 billion reais a year earlier,
or 43 centavos, the Rio de Janeiro-based company said today in a
regulatory statement. Per-share profit excluding some items
trailed the 44-centavo mean of 12  analysts’ estimates  compiled
by Bloomberg.  Fuel imports are curbing profit as imported gasoline and
diesel prices exceeded those in Brazil even after four price
increases since June 2012. Imported gasoline cost 20 percent
more than domestic fuel in the quarter because the government,
which control’s Petrobras’s board, prohibits fuel sales at
market prices to control inflation, Itau Unibanco Holding SA
said in a note to clients.  “Petrobras’s profitability in the third quarter was
reduced by the fuel price gaps,” Auro Rozenbaum, an analyst at
Bradesco SA who rates the stock a hold and doesn’t own any, said
by telephone from Sao Paulo ahead of the report. “By the end of
August the gap reached a record level.”  Refining Losses  The company’s refining unit posted an operating loss of
8.59 billion reais in the quarter. Fuel imports climbed to
493,000 barrels a day in the period, an increase of 89 percent
from the previous quarter, Petrobras said in the report.  Petrobras has increased prices for gasoline 15 percent and
diesel 22 percent since June 2012 to reduce the discount with
international prices. The gap narrowed to about 10 percent in
the fourth quarter after  Brazil ’s currency rebounded and
international crude prices fell, making imported gasoline
cheaper, Rozenbaum said.  The real has appreciated more than all currencies tracked
by Bloomberg since Aug. 22 when the central bank announced a $60
billion program of currency swaps and credit line auctions. The
real reached 2.1523 per dollar on Oct. 17, the highest level
since June 14.  Brent crude averaged $109.65 a barrel in the third quarter,
little changed from $109.42 a year earlier. Brent oil for
December settlement dropped 0.3 percent to close at $106.66 a
barrel on the London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange today.  Petrobras is investing $237 billion over five years to
build refineries, develop deepwater fields and ramp up output at
Lula, the second-largest discovery in Brazil’s history after
Libra. Petrobras took a 40 percent stake in the Libra field in a
government auction on Oct. 21.  Petrobras expects domestic crude production to double to
4.2 million barrels a day in 2020 as it adds more than 30
production units to fields in deep waters of the Atlantic. It
plans to increase refinery output 50 percent during the period
to allow it to phase out fuel imports.  To contact the reporter on this story:
