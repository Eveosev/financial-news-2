China Life Insurance Co. (2628) , the
nation’s biggest insurer, returned to profit in the third
quarter from a year ago as a stock-market rally boosted
investment returns.  Net income  was 7.5 billion  yuan  ($1.23 billion), or 0.27
yuan a share, in the three months ended Sept. 30, compared to a
2.2 billion yuan loss a year earlier, the company said in a
statement to the Shanghai stock exchange. Nine-month profit rose
to 23.7 billion yuan compared with 7.4 billion yuan a year
earlier, it said.  The benchmark  Shanghai Composite Index (SHCOMP)  climbed 9.9 percent
in the three months ended Sept. 30 as China’s economic growth
accelerated for the first time in three quarters, boosting the
value of  China  Life’s equity holdings. Net premiums earned were
73.2 billion yuan in the third quarter, the company said.  Investment income rose 20.5 percent to 23 billion yuan, the
Beijing-based company said. Impairment losses from investments,
which jumped 140 percent last year, were 43 million yuan,
according to the statement.  Third-quarter profits at Chinese insurers traded on
mainland exchanges may have grown an average 80 percent because
of a low base from a year earlier and the stock-market rally
that offsets fair-value losses on their portfolios, Guotai Junan
Securities Co.’s Shanghai-based analysts led by Peng Yulong
wrote in an Oct. 20 report.  They forecast a 3.8 billion yuan profit for China Life and
a 164 percent jump in the net income of China Pacific Insurance
Group Co., which is scheduled to report earnings next week.  To contact the reporter on this story:
