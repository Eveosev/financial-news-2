Greece ’s 2014 budget hole will be no
more than a quarter the size estimated by the country’s
international creditors, a senior Greek official said, signaling
a hard line before the next round of aid negotiations.  The Greek government’s fiscal gap for next year would be
500 million euros ($690 million) in a worst-case scenario,
compared with about 2 billion euros projected by the euro area
and the International Monetary Fund, the official told reporters
today in Brussels on the condition of anonymity.  The official, speaking during a meeting of European Union
leaders, predicted a clash between Greece and its creditors
should they refuse to back down from the forecast of a 2
billion-euro shortfall in next year’s budget plan.  The government of Prime Minister Antonis Samaras is
preparing to resume talks in early November in  Athens  on
Greece’s eligibility for further aid payouts under its 240
billion-euro rescue program, while rejecting any further fiscal
tightening.  The Greek government predicts that it will post a budget
surplus excluding interest payments in 2013, a year ahead of
schedule. The country’s budget deficit in 2009, when Greece
triggered the euro-area debt crisis, was five times the EU
limit.  To contact the reporter on this story:
