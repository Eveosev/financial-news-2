BlackRock Inc. (BLK) ’s Rick Rieder said he
favors high-yield bonds in Europe, commercial-mortgage debt and
some auto asset-backed securities as the  Federal Reserve 
prepares to trim its record stimulus.  The Fed will probably begin to reduce its $85 billion of
monthly purchases of Treasuries and mortgage bonds in March,
Rieder, chief investment officer for fundamental fixed income,
said today at a media conference at the New York offices of the
world’s largest money manager.  Investing in securities with greater credit risk and less
sensitivity to changes in  interest rates  should help shield
investors from the price declines that coincide with increasing
yields, he said.  “There’s a rotation within fixed income that is profound”
as securities such as investment-grade bonds that have
traditionally been considered safer become more risky with rates
poised to rise, Rieder said.  Speculative-grade bonds worldwide yield an average 6.4
percent and have returned 5.68 percent this year, according to
Bank of America Merrill Lynch index data. That compares with a
yield of 2.87 percent on investment-grade obligations that have
gained 0.31 percent.  The Fed has distorted markets through its quantitative
easing program, Rieder said, citing data showing Treasuries and
mortgage-backed securities account for 65.6 percent of a
benchmark Barclays Plc bond index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
