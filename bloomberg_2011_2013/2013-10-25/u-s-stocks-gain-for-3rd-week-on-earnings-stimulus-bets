U.S.  stocks  rose for a third
straight week, sending the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index to a
record, as earnings beat estimates and weak economic data fueled
speculation the  Federal Reserve  will delay reducing stimulus.  Amazon.com Inc. jumped 10 percent to a record as sales
exceeded projections. Boeing Co. climbed 7.1 percent after
boosting its full-year earnings estimate. Corning Inc. gained 16
percent as it approved a $2 billion buyback.  Caterpillar Inc. (CAT) 
slid 2.9 percent after cutting its forecast amid a slump in
orders from commodity producers.  Coach Inc. (COH)  lost 7.4 percent as
stiffer competition curtailed North American handbag sales.  The S&P 500 gained 0.9 percent to 1,759.77 over the five
days. The benchmark index has advanced 4.7 percent in October,
heading for the biggest monthly rise since July. The  Dow Jones
Industrial Average  advanced 170.63 points, or 1.1 percent, to
15,570.28. The gauge is 0.7 percent below its all-time high.  “Investors are getting a little more comfortable in the
marketplace,”  John Manley , who helps oversee $233.6 billion as
chief equity strategist for Wells Fargo Funds Management in  New
York , said in a phone interview. “The Fed is accommodative and
they’re going to stay that way. Earnings were supposed to start
going down two years ago, and yet again they’re OK. Equities are
still the asset class of choice, and I think that will
continue.”  The S&P 500 rallied 0.6 percent on Oct. 22, boosted by
speculation the Fed will delay curtailing its monetary stimulus
after  payrolls  in the U.S. climbed by less than forecast in
September. The data indicated the economy had little momentum
leading up to the 16-day partial closure of the government as
lawmakers wrangled over the  federal budget .  Confidence Falls  Other economic reports during the week showed orders to
manufacturers unexpectedly dropped in September, while  consumer
confidence  in October fell to a 10-month low.  Members of the  Federal Open Market Committee  are scheduled
to meet Oct. 29-30, when they will consider scaling back asset
purchases that have helped propel the  S&P 500  up 160 percent
since March 2009. Policy makers will wait until March before
starting to taper the $85 billion of monthly bond purchases, a
Bloomberg survey showed this month.  “You’re going to continue to see a Fed-driven market,”
Brad McMillan, chief investment officer for Waltham,
Massachusetts-based Commonwealth Financial Network, said in a
phone interview. His firm has more than $71 billion under
management. “You’re probably looking at another four, five or
six months before the taper is going to realistically happen.”  Earnings Season  Investors were also analyzing corporate profits as some 145
companies in the S&P 500 reported results, making it the busiest
week of the earnings season. Earnings for members of the gauge
probably increased 3.7 percent in the third quarter as sales
climbed 2.4 percent, according to analysts’ estimates compiled
by Bloomberg.  Of the 244 companies in the S&P 500 that have reported so
far, some 76 percent have topped analysts’ profit estimates,
while 54 percent have beaten on sales.  The weekly gain in stocks pushed the S&P 500’s  valuations 
to their highest levels in almost four years. The benchmark
index trades at 15.9 projected earnings, up from a multiple of
13.1 at the beginning of this year, data compiled by Bloomberg
show.  The Chicago Board Options Exchange  Volatility Index (VIX) , the
gauge of S&P 500 options prices known as the VIX, gained 0.4
percent to 13.09 for the week. The gauge has fallen 21 percent
this month.  ‘Fair Value’  Eight out of 10 main  industries  in the S&P 500 rose for the
week as industrial, utility and consumer-discretionary shares
advanced at least 1.9 percent to pace gains. Financial shares
fell 0.4 percent for the worst performance.  “Stocks are approaching fair value,” Jim Russell, who
helps oversee $112 billion as a senior equity strategist for
U.S. Bank Wealth Management, said by phone. “You’re seeing now
in the third-quarter earnings a glaring light shined on the
haves and have-nots.”  Amazon rallied 10 percent to $363.39. The world’s largest
online retailer is stepping up spending on warehouses and Web-based services, boosting costs to a record level in a drive to
sell more products during the holiday season.  Boeing, the world’s largest planemaker, climbed 7.1 percent
to $131.19, an all-time high. Revenue and free  cash flow  are
surging as Boeing speeds the production tempo for single-aisle
737s, wide-body 777s and 787 Dreamliners to take advantage of
airlines’ demand for more fuel-efficient jets. Boeing raised the
787’s planned output rate to 12 a month in 2016, up from a goal
of 10 by the end of 2013.  Corning, Microsoft  Corning (GLW) , the maker of glass for televisions and mobile
devices, surged 16 percent to $17.35 for the biggest increase in
the S&P 500. The company said it will buy Samsung Electronics
Co.’s 43 percent stake in a joint venture that makes glass for
liquid crystal displays in  South Korea . The $2 billion buyback
will last until the end of 2015, assuming the Samsung deal is
approved.  Microsoft Corp. (MSFT)  climbed 2.2 percent to $35.73. The world’s
largest software maker  reported  first-quarter sales and profit
that exceeded projections as the company relied on corporate
software demand to make up for weak consumer personal-computer
purchases.  Apple Inc. (AAPL)  gained 3.4 percent to $525.96. The company
introduced new iPads in time for holiday shoppers, as it battles
to stay ahead of rivals in the increasingly crowded market for
tablet computers.  Washers, Dryers  Whirlpool Corp. increased 9.6 percent, the most in a week
since February 2012, to $146.18. The company lifted its forecast
as it sees signs of improvement in some parts of the world,
while progress in the U.S. housing market boosts domestic demand
for its washers and dryers.  Homebuilders rallied 5.4 percent as a group, with
PulteGroup Inc. soaring 8.8 percent to $18.04. Profit surged for
the second-largest  U.S. homebuilder  by market value on a tax-related gain and rising revenue from house sales.  The Bloomberg U.S. Airlines Index climbed 4.2 percent to
the highest level since July 2007. Southwest Airlines Co. added
6.9 percent to $17.17, a seven-year high.  Caterpillar, the world’s biggest maker of construction and
mining equipment, slumped 2.9 percent to $84.77 for the steepest
decline in the Dow. Slower demand for commodities in  emerging
markets  has pushed miners to cut  capital spending , including
purchases of equipment.  Coach Inc. slid 7.4 percent to $49.89. Same-store sales in
 North America  sank 6.8 percent in the quarter as Michael Kors
Holdings Ltd., Fifth & Pacific Cos.’  Kate Spade  and Tory Burch
LLC increased distribution of their own products.  To contact the reporter on this story:
