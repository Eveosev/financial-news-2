The Scottish government approved an
extension to a wind farm west of Aberdeen that will enable the
site to supply more than 48,000 local homes.  Fred Olsen Renewables Ltd. won permission to install a
further nine turbines at the Mid Hill wind farm near Banchory,
taking its total capacity to 102 megawatts, the government said
today in an e-mailed statement.  Scotland  has committed to get all its electricity from
clean sources by 2020, with half to come from renewables by
2015. It contributed about 35 percent of total U.K. renewable
generation last year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
