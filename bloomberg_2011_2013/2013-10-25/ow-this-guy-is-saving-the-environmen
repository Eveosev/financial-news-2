It's that time of year again: On the heels of our 2013 Readers' Choice Awards, we're thrilled to  announce the winner  of our 24th Annual  Condé Nast Traveler  Environmental Award, Myint Zaw. Zaw, 38, is a journalist and passionate environmentalist who has crusaded against the danger of big dams, rampant deforestation, and wildlife trafficking in Burma. Despite the tight rule of Burma's military regime, Zaw recently managed to galvanize public opinion to stop the construction of the Myitsone Dam—preserving the ecology of the Irrawady River and the livelihood of local farmers.  "Seventy percent of the people in Myanmar live in rural areas," Zaw told  Condé Nast Traveler . "We're interested in the environment not only for aesthetic reasons but for the well-being of the people." Similarly in Puerto Rico, Environmental Award runner-up Luis Jorge Rivera Herrera has campaigned to protect environmental wetlands under the threat of development. In China, fellow runner-up Grace Ge Gabriel launched the country's first and only international animal welfare organization,  International Fund for Animal Welfare (IFAW) , and in Mali, runner-up Nomba Ganame founded the  Mali Elephant Project .
