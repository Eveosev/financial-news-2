Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA)  sold North Sea
Forties crude at the lowest differential in six months. No bids
or offers were made for Russian Urals blend for a fifth day.
Iraqi Kirkuk exports for November will increase by 36 percent
from this month.  Russia will ship 24 cargoes of 100,000 metric tons each and
one 60,000-ton lot of Urals crude from Primorsk on the Baltic
Sea during Oct. 31 to Nov. 15, a preliminary loading program
obtained by Bloomberg showed. This compares with 24 shipments of
100,000 tons each a month earlier.  North Sea  Shell sold Forties cargo F1105 for loading Nov. 6 to Nov. 8
to Petroineos, a joint venture between PetroChina Co. and Ineos
Group AG, at 52 cents a barrel less than Dated Brent, a
Bloomberg survey of traders and brokers monitoring the Platts
pricing window showed. That’s the lowest since April 11 and
compares with a premium of 36 cents for a trade on Oct. 22.  Trafigura Beheer BV was unable sell the grade for Nov. 15
to Nov. 17 at 80 cents a barrel more than Dated Brent, 15 cents
more than its offer yesterday, according to the survey.  Brent for December settlement traded at $106.51 a barrel on
the ICE Futures Europe exchange at the close of the window,
compared with $107.37 from the previous session. The January
contract was at $106.19, a discount of 32 cents to December.  The sulfur de-escalator for Forties crude will be 30 cents
a barrel from Nov. 1, unchanged from this month, Platts said a
statement on its website. The de-escalator, a price adjustment,
applies to cargoes that contain more than 0.6 percent sulfur to
compensate buyers.  Ineos Group Holdings SA announced today it will immediately
reopen  Scotland ’s Grangemouth petrochemical site and start up
the adjacent refinery after forging a deal with the unionized
workforce. The site provides steam and power to a facility that
processes Forties crude from a North Sea pipeline, which
continued to operate during the dispute.  Urals/Mediterranean  Ust-Luga on the Baltic Sea will load 12 Urals cargoes of
100,000 tons each in the same period, the plan showed.  Novorossiysk on the Black Sea will export five cargoes of
140,000 tons each, and nine 80,000-ton cargoes from Oct. 31 to
Nov. 14, totaling 1.42 million tons, according to the schedule.  Iraq will increase shipments of Kirkuk crude in November
via the Turkish port of Ceyhan to 20 cargoes, or 331,333 barrels
a day, according to a loading program. This compares with 16
lots, or 243,871 barrels a day, in October.  West Africa  Nigeria will export eight Agbami cargoes for December, one
more than November, according to a loading program obtained by
Bloomberg News.  The nation will also export four lots each of Bonga,
Forcados, Usan and Brass, two consignments each of Yoho and
Escravos, and one shipment of Okwori, separate plans showed.
Cargo sizes range from 650,000 barrels to 1 million barrels.  A Nigerian militant group said it’s in contact with the
captors of two U.S. citizens abducted off the coast of the West
African nation and is working to ensure they are well treated
before being freed.  The unidentified Americans were seized from a vessel called
the C-Retriever in the Gulf of Guinea yesterday in an act of
piracy, the State Department said. The kidnappings were carried
out by a “heavily armed auxiliary outfit” that made contact
with a commander of the Movement for the Emancipation of the
Niger Delta, the group said in an e-mailed statement  To contact the reporter on this story:
