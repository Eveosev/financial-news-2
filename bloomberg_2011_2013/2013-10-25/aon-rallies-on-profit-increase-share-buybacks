Aon Plc (AON) , the second-largest
insurance broker by market value, had the  biggest gain  in the
81-company Standard & Poor’s 500 Financials Index after posting
higher third-quarter profit and accelerating share repurchases.  The broker advanced 3.7 percent to $78.38 at 10:20 a.m. in
New York, extending its increase this year to 41 percent.  Net income  jumped 25 percent to $256 million as revenue
climbed at both the risk-solutions brokerage segment and the
human-resources division, according to a statement today from
the London-based company. Aon, which was previously based in
 Chicago , said it repurchased about $500 million of stock in the
quarter, compared with $225 million in the prior three months.  “Risk-solutions results were strong and slightly better
than our estimates,” Dan Farrell, an analyst at Sterne Agee &
Leach Inc., said in a note to investors today. The share
“buyback of $500 million was well above our $200 million
forecast.”  Marsh & McLennan Cos., the largest broker by market value,
advanced 1.1 percent. The New York-based company gained 35
percent since Dec. 31.  To contact the reporter on this story:
