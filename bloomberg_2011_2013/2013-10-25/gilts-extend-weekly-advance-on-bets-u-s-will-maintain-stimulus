U.K. government bonds extended a
third weekly gain as a U.S. report showing  consumer confidence 
dropped this month boosted demand for fixed-income assets.  Benchmark  10-year gilt yields  dropped toward the lowest
level in two months as the data added to speculation the  Federal
Reserve  will maintain asset purchases to keep borrowing costs
low. U.K. bonds have advanced for three of the past four days
after a U.S. report this week showed American employers added
fewer jobs last month than economists forecast. The pound
weakened against most of its major counterparts.  “We’re going where Treasuries lead us,” said  John Wraith ,
a fixed-income strategist at Bank of America Corp. in  London .
“The situation in the U.S. remains the biggest driver of
longer-term yields and sentiment. The data in the U.K. has
settled down a bit. The number today was OK, but not as strong
as the PMIs had suggested,” he said, referring to purchasing
managers surveys released earlier this month.  The benchmark  10-year gilt yield  fell two basis points, or
0.02 percentage point, to 2.61 percent at 4:23 p.m. London time,
having dropped 11 basis points this week. The 2.25 percent bond
due in September 2023 rose 0.18, or 1.80 pounds per 1,000-pound
face amount, to 96.90.  The Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan final consumer
sentiment index dropped to 73.2, the weakest this year, from
77.5 in September. The median estimate in a Bloomberg survey was
for a decline to 75.  Gilts lost 2.4 percent this year through yesterday,
according to Bloomberg World Bond Indexes. Treasuries fell 1.9
percent and German securities dropped 1.5 percent.  The pound dropped 0.2 percent to $1.6166 and weakened 0.2
percent to 85.36 pence per euro.  To contact the reporter on this story:
