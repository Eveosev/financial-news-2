Asian stocks fell, extending the
regional gauge’s biggest weekly decline since August, as
forecasts from Canon Inc. to Posco disappointed investors.  Canon retreated 1.6 percent in  Tokyo  as the camera maker
trimmed its earnings outlook. Posco, South Korea’s biggest
steelmaker, slipped 0.5 percent in  Seoul  after cutting its 2013
sales forecast.  LG Electronics Inc. (066570)  lost 3.4 percent after its
third-quarter operating profit and sales missed estimates. AMP
Ltd. tumbled 2.8 percent in Sydney after  Australia ’s largest
life insurer and pension manager said fourth-quarter operating
profit will fall by as much as A$65 million ($62.5 million).  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index sank 1.1 percent to 141.4 at
7:49 p.m. in Tokyo, extending this week’s drop to 1.4 percent.
Of 87 companies in the measure that have reported quarterly
results this  earnings season  and for which Bloomberg compiles
estimates, 57 percent posted profit that missed expectations.
The yen is poised for a second-straight weekly advance.  “The earnings numbers are not fantastic,” Evan Lucas,
Melbourne-based market strategist at IG Ltd. said by phone.
“Many of the export-driven Japanese companies like Canon had
the weakening yen supporting them earlier in the year but that
is now stagnating. People are starting to reassess those shares
that have had that support.”  Regional Gauges  Japan ’s Topix index today fell 2.1 percent, the biggest
retreat in more than two months. Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 Index
rose 0.3 percent and New Zealand’s NZX 50 Index advanced 0.6
percent. South Korea’s  Kospi index  dropped 0.6 percent even
after data showed the nation’s economy expanded more than
forecast last quarter. Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500
Index slipped 0.1 percent.  Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index slid 0.6 percent and  China ’s
Shanghai Composite declined 1.5 percent.  Singapore ’s Straits
Times Index lost 0.4 percent and  Taiwan ’s  Taiex Index  retreated
0.8 percent.  Fed policy makers are scheduled to meet Oct. 29-30, when
they will evaluate the strength of the recovery with a less
complete set of figures than usual due to the 16-day partial
government shutdown that caused the suspension of reports and
collection of data.  Japanese consumer prices climbed in September from a year
earlier, a fourth monthly gain. The Topix surged 37 percent this
year, the largest rally among 24 developed equity markets
tracked by Bloomberg.  Posco lost 0.5 percent to 320,000 won and LG Electronics
retreated 3.4 percent to 67,700 won. Canon declined 1.6 percent
to 3,080 yen and AMP slumped 2.8 percent to A$4.80. Great Wall
Motor Co. sank 7 percent to HK$45.05 in Hong Kong after its
third-quarter profit missed analysts’ estimates.  Among rising shares, Murata Manufacturing Co. gained 2.2
percent to 7,760 yen after net income topped the electronic-component maker’s forecasts.  To contact the reporter on this story:
