Dominican President Danilo Medina
met with Latin American diplomats as frustration grows over a
court ruling the  United Nations  said could strip citizenship
rights of thousands of descendants of Haitian immigrants.  Medina told 16 ambassadors and representative of Latin
American countries today that he is respectful of the court’s
ruling and reiterated his government’s “commitment to
implementing a transparent migration policy,” according to a
statement from the presidential palace.  Last month, the country’s Constitutional Court ruled that
everyone of “migrant background” born in the Dominican
Republic since 1929 should be examined to determine whether they
should be stripped of their citizenship. The ruling means that
as many as 210,000 Dominican-born residents of Haitian descent
are at risk of being stateless, the UN’s human rights office
said in an Oct. 1 report.  Haiti, the poorest country in the Western Hemisphere,
shares the island of Hispaniola with the Dominican Republic, one
of the Caribbean’s biggest economies.  To contact the reporter on this story:
