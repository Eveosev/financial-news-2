A case of  Chateau Latour  a Pomerol
1961 from the cellar of the Bordeaux estate’s former owner Lily
Lacoste-Loubat fetched 103,400 pounds ($167,100) at a Sotheby’s
sale for charity, more than double the low estimate.  A double magnum of Petrus 1964 and a case of the same
Bordeaux estate’s 1982 vintage each sold for 47,000 pounds, also
beating estimates, while 12-bottle lots of Petrus 1990 and 1998
fetched 42,300 pounds each, according to a Sotheby’s statement.  The Liv-ex Fine Wine 50 Index, tracking leading Bordeaux
vintages from more recent years, has dropped since March 15,
paring an 8 percent gain made in the previous 10 weeks to leave
it less than 2 percent up this year. Auction demand for historic
vintages with strong provenance contrasts with muted investment
appetite in the broader market for younger wines, which has left
the index 30 percent below its 2011 peak.  Data charting annual returns over 20 years “suggests we
should be at or near the bottom of a 10-year cycle,” Will Beck,
partner of London-based Wine Asset Managers LLP, said in a
market report. The fund has $20 million under management.  Other historic bottles in the  Sotheby’s (BID)  sale, held on Oct.
23, include one magnum of Petrus 1945, which sold for 32,900
pounds, more than double its low estimate, and another from its
1961 vintage, which fetched 22,325 pounds.  Merlot Vines  Petrus has 28 acres (11 hectares) planted with red-grape
vines, of which 95 percent are Merlot and 5 percent Cabernet
Franc. The Bordeaux vineyard is in Pomerol, on the right bank of
the Dordogne river. Fermentation is in temperature-controlled
concrete tanks and the wine matured in new oak barrels.  Lacoste-Loubat inherited both Petrus and Latour a Pomerol
in 1961 from her aunt, according to an e-mailed Sotheby’s
statement. Proceeds from that part of the sale went to
charitable foundation Le Foyer de Charite, which currently owns
Latour a Pomerol.  The auction, which also included other wines, raised a
total of 2.31 million pounds, with Asian collectors securing 43
percent of the lots, according to Sotheby’s.  Following is a table of major wine auctions held so far
