The pound advanced for a seventh
week against the dollar on speculation the U.K. economy is
poised to recover from recession while the  Federal Reserve 
expands monetary easing.  Sterling rose to the highest level in more than a year
against the greenback and has advanced 0.7 percent since the Fed
said Sept. 13 it would buy $40 billion of mortgage bonds a month
to cap borrowing costs. The pound strengthened against the euro
for the first time in six weeks as investors sought U.K. assets
as a haven amid speculation  Spain  will delay seeking aid that
could help sooth turmoil in euro-region sovereign debt markets.
Ten-year  gilts  advanced, snapping a two-week drop.  “Dollar weakness is the main reason sterling is firmer now
but the fact that it’s been able to gain against the euro
suggests that diversification trades have been a theme,” said
Jane Foley, a senior currency strategist at Rabobank
International in  London . “U.K. fundamentals have played an
astonishingly small part in sterling’s performance.”  The pound gained 0.2 percent to $1.6248 at 5:04 p.m. London
time yesterday, after climbing to $1.6309, the highest since
Aug. 31, 2011. The seven-week advance is the longest streak
since the period ended Dec. 3, 2004. Sterling appreciated 1.2
percent to 79.95 pence per euro, after reaching 79.75 pence, the
strongest level since Sept. 12.  Fed Program  The U.K. currency climbed against the dollar on
“anticipation about what the Fed would do and then the
aggressive nature of the quantitative easing program that they
announced,” Rabobank’s Foley said.  The pound rose even as the U.K. economy is estimated to
contract 0.4 percent this year, according to Bloomberg
forecasts. Analysts predict final second-quarter gross domestic
product figures, set to be published on Sept. 27, will show a
0.5 percent contraction.  Sterling’s gains were tempered as reports showed U.K.
inflation slowed and retail sales declined.  Data published Sept. 18 showed  consumer prices  rose 2.5
percent in August from the same month in 2011, compared with 2.6
percent in July.  Retail sales , excluding fuel, fell 0.3 percent
in August from July and were up 3.1 percent from the same month
a year earlier, a separate report on Sept. 20 showed.  The yield on  10-year gilts  dropped 13 basis points, or 0.13
percentage point, in the week to 1.83 percent, after rising to
1.99 percent on Sept 17, the highest level since May. The 1.75
percent September 2022 security rose 1.175, or 11.75 pounds per
1,000-pound face amount to 99.235.  Gilts have returned 2.7 percent this year through Sept. 20,
according to indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the European
Federation of Financial Analysts Societies. German bunds gained
2.5 percent and  U.S. Treasuries  earned 1.7 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
