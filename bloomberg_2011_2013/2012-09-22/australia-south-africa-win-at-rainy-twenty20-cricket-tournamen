Australia  and  South Africa  won
rain-shortened games at the World Twenty20 cricket championship
in Sri Lanka.  Australia beat West Indies by 17 runs in Group B under the
Duckworth-Lewis rules used for weather-affected games. Chasing
192 for victory, Australia reached 100-1 in 9.1 overs, enough to
ensure victory as rain stopped play in Colombo.  South Africa beat Sri Lanka by 32 runs in a Group C game
shortened to seven overs per team from 20 after a 2 1/2-hour
delay to start play in Hambantota. South Africa finished 78-4 in
its innings, then limited Sri Lanka to 46-5.  Australia and South Africa won both of their group games to
advance to the next round. The top two in each of the four
three-team groups move into a Super Eight stage, from which the
top two teams in each pool move into the semifinals. The final
is in  Colombo  on Oct. 7.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
