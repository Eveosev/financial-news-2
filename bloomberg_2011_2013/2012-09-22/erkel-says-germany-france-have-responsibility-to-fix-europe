Chancellor Angela Merkel  said that
Germany and France have a “special responsibility” to repair
 Europe .  Germany and France must nurture their ties, as “good and
trusting relations are not a given,” she said in a speech in
Ludwigsburg, Germany, at an event marking 50 years of
reconciliation following World War II.  Germany and France will work for Europe’s future along with
all other European countries, and  “we must strengthen and
stabilise the euro area,” Merkel said.  “We are working to make Europe sustainably healthy.
Germany and France have a special responsibility in that
regard,” she said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
