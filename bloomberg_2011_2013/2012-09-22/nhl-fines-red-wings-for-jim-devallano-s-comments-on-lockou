The  National Hockey League  fined
the  Detroit Red Wings  an undisclosed amount of money for remarks
on the current player lockout made by Senior Vice President Jim Devellano.  NHL Deputy Commissioner Bill Daly said in a statement
Devellano’s remarks weren’t appropriate, authorized or permitted
under league by-laws.  “Such comments are neither constructive nor helpful to the
negotiations,” Daly said.  In an interview with Island Sports News, Devellano said a
solution to end the lockout would be for the players to take 43
percent of hockey-related revenue and let the owners get 57
percent. The players are currently getting 57 percent.  Devellano also compared the league’s owners to a ranch and
said the players, and himself, were “cattle.”  “The owners own the ranch and allow the players to eat
there,” Devellano said. “That’s the way it’s always been and
that’s the way it will be forever. And the owners simply aren’t
going to let a union push them around. It’s not going to
happen.”  The NHL locked out the players on Sept. 16 after the two
sides, which haven’t met since, couldn’t agree on a new
collective bargaining agreement. They are divided over revenue
sharing and player compensation. The NHL had record revenue of
$3.2 billion last season.  The league has canceled preseason games through Sept. 30.
The regular season is scheduled to begin Oct. 11.  To contact the reporter on this story:
