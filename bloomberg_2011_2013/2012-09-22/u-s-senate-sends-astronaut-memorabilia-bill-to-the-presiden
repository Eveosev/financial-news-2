Now it’s up to President  Barack
Obama  whether to let astronauts keep their decades-old
souvenirs.  The Senate today cleared for the president’s signature
legislation, H.R. 4158, that would stop the U.S. space agency
from suing astronauts over custody of items they kept after
their missions.  The mementos have become the subject of a heated battle
between astronauts and the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration.  NASA sued the sixth man to walk on the moon, Edgar
Mitchell, when he put up for auction a camera that he said he
salvaged after his 1971 mission to the moon.  Agency administrator Charles Bolden said in January there
had been “fundamental misunderstandings and unclear policies”
over who owned what.  The bill, which was passed without a recorded vote,
declares that the government has no right to items that aren’t
explicitly required to be returned to  NASA  and “other
expendable, disposable and personal-use items.”  That may include personal logs, checklists, flight manuals
and other items. It wouldn’t apply to moon rocks and other lunar
material.  To contact the reporter on this story:
