German bunds rose, with 10-year
yields dropping the most in four weeks, as euro-area surveys
showed services and manufacturing output fell to a 39-month low
in September, boosting demand for the region’s safest assets.  The extra yield investors demand to hold Spanish 10-year
bonds instead of similar-maturity German securities widened as
the nation sold 4.8 billion euros ($6.2 billion) of bonds this
week, the most since January.  Spain ’s bonds were supported amid
speculation the nation would seek external aid. German  two-year 
notes gained as the Mannheim-based ZEW Center for European
Economic Research said Sept. 18 Germany’s current situation
index fell to the lowest level since June 2010.  The euro-region surveys “dropped significantly, showing
the economy as a whole is slowing,” said Christian Reicherter,
an analyst at  DZ Bank  AG in  Frankfurt . “Bunds rebounded after
significant losses in recent weeks. Many countries are already
in recession and the German economy is slowing.”  Germany’s 10-year yield fell 11 basis points, or 0.11
percentage point, this week to 1.60 percent as of 5 p.m. London
time yesterday, the biggest decline since the five-day period
ending Aug. 24. The 1.5 percent security due in September 2022
rose 0.99, or 9.90 euros per 1,000-euro face amount to 99.12.
The  two-year  yield was at 0.04 percent, down seven basis points
since Sept. 14.  Economic Contraction  A composite  index  based on a survey of purchasing managers
in manufacturing and services in the euro area dropped to 45.9
from 46.3 in August, London-based Markit Economics said Sept. 20
in an initial estimate. That’s the lowest since June 2009. A
reading below 50 indicates contraction.  Spain’s Deputy Prime Minister Soraya Saenz de Santamaria
told opposition lawmakers Sept. 19 that they had called for the
 European Central Bank  to buy government debt, setting out the
case for an aid request. The ECB said Sept. 6 it will act to
reduce borrowing costs if countries request assistance.  The Madrid-based Treasury sold 3.94 billion euros of new
three-year notes on Sept. 20 at an  average yield  of 3.845
percent. It also auctioned 859 million euros of its 10-year
benchmark bond at an average of 5.666 percent, the  lowest  since
January and compared with 6.647 percent when it was last sold on
Aug. 2.  Spanish 10-year yields were little changed in the week at
5.76 percent, leaving the spread versus German bunds at 417
basis points, up from 408 basis points on Sept. 14.  Debt Sales  Germany  is due to sell up to 5 billion euros of 10-year
debt next week, while  Italy ,  Belgium  and the Netherlands are
also scheduled to auction bonds. The IFO Institute will say
Sept. 24 that its business climate index was at 102.5 this month
from 102.3 in August, according to the median estimate of 18
economists surveyed by Bloomberg. Last month’s reading was the
lowest since March 2010.  “Next week we have the IFO and this should also point to
slower growth in Germany,” DZ Bank’s Reicherter said. Ten-year
yields will remain in a tight range, he said, predicting the
rate will be at 1.60 percent in three months.  German bonds returned 2.5 percent this year through Sept.
20, according to indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the European
Federation of Financial Analysts Societies. Spanish securities
added 1.4 percent, while Italy’s earned 16 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
