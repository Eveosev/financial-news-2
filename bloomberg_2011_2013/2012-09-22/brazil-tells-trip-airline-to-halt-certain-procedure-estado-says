Brazil ’s civil aviation regulator
ordered Trip Linhas Aereas to halt an unauthorized landing
procedure which it considers “high risk,” Estado de S.Paulo
 reported , citing a report published by the regulator.  The regulator, known as Anac, recommended the removal of
Trip’s director of operations and director of operational
security, according to the report.  The landing technique, known as RNAV Approach, uses
precision instruments like global-positioning systems to allow
planes to fly at lower altitudes with less visibility before
landing. Trip lacks the required certification to use the
technique, Estado said, citing the Anac report.  Closely held Trip confirmed that it had been notified and
ordered its pilots to cease using the procedure, the Sao Paulo-
based newspaper reported. The carrier is based in Campinas,
Brazil.  To contact the reporters on this story:
