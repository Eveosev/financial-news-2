Individual investors placed orders
for more than half of the $1.55 billion of general-obligation
bonds  California  began selling today, with a preliminary yield
of 2.51 percent on securities maturing in 2022.  Individuals ordered $809 million of the bonds, or about 52
percent, according to  Tom Dresslar , a spokesman for California
Treasurer Bill Lockyer.  The bonds offer 0.73 percentage point more yield than top-
rated debt maturing in 10 years, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. That’s down from 0.84 percentage point on bonds with
similar maturities sold in April. Thirty-year bonds were offered
at 3.75 percent, or 0.86 percentage point above AAA securities.  “This is an excellent result so far,” Dresslar said in a
statement. “California GOs continue to perform well because the
market recognizes the substantial strides we have made toward
greater fiscal stability.”  California is selling $1 billion of general obligations for
public-works projects and $550 million to refund debt. Orders
were being taken from individual investors today and Sept. 24
before institutions such as mutual funds get their chance on
Sept 25, the last day of the sale.  With another $500 million slated for market in October,
Lockyer plans to offer about $5.3 billion this year, about a
quarter of the state’s sales in 2009.  California’s economy is bigger than  India ’s, ranking ninth
in the world as measured by gross domestic product, according to
the state Finance Department. Its bonds have returned 6.6
percent in 2012, beating all but three states and the 5.7
percent gain for the broader $3.7 trillion muni market,
according to Standard & Poor’s data.  S&P rates California A-, its seventh-lowest investment
level and the worst grade it gives any state.  The yield on benchmark tax-free debt due in 10 years was
1.78 percent, according to a Bloomberg Valuation index. The
 interest rate  set a record low of 1.63 percent in July.  To contact the reporter on this story:
