Cooking-oil demand in  India , the
world’s largest palm oil importer, is poised to jump 44 percent
in the next eight years as rising incomes boost sales of
noodles, cookies and fried foods, a government official said.  Consumption may surge to 23 million metric tons by 2020
from 16 million tons now, D. Bhalla, a joint secretary in the
country’s food ministry, told an industry conference in Mumbai
today. Imports will rise significantly in coming years to meet
this demand, he said. The per capita consumption of edible oils
in India is 13.5 kilograms, compared with the global average of
about 26 kilograms, he said.  Rising Indian use of cooking oils may help Indonesia and
Malaysia, the world’s biggest  palm oil  producers, to reduce
inventories, and potentially stem a decline in prices. India’s
imports are set to surpass 10 million tons for the first time
next year as dry weather trims supply of domestic oilseed crops
and demand increases, GG Patel & Nikhil Research Co. Managing
Partner Govindlal G. Patel, who’s traded cooking oils for more
than three decades, said yesterday.  “Demand in India will get a boost from a growing economy
and lower edible  oil prices ,” said Dinesh Shahra, managing
director of  Ruchi Soya Industries Ltd. (RSI) , the country’s biggest
importer of cooking oils. “Every year consumption is growing at
the rate of 4 percent.”  Import Dependence  India, Asia’s third-largest economy, expanded at an average
 7.9 percent  in the past five years, according to the government.  The South Asian nation, the world’s biggest cooking oil
consumer after  China , meets more than half its demand through
imports. India buys palm oil from Indonesia and Malaysia, and
 soybean oil  from the U.S., Brazil and  Argentina . Vegetable-oil
imports climbed 19 percent to 8.16 million tons between November
and August, according to the Solvent Extractors’ Association of
India.  Palm oil imports may reach an all-time high of 8.1 million
tons in 2012-2013, compared with 7.5 million tons this year,
while soybean oil purchases may climb to 1.2 million tons in
2012-2013 from 1.1 million tons, GG Patel & Nikhil’s Patel said.  Palm oil for December delivery fell 2 percent to 2,763
ringgit ($906) a ton on the Malaysia Derivatives Exchange in
 Kuala Lumpur  on Sept. 21, the lowest price at close since
October 2010. Futures have fallen 13 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
