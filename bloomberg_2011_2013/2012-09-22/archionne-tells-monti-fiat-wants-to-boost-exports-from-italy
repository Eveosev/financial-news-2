Fiat SpA (F) , the Italian automaker
that controls Chrysler Group LLC, wants to strengthen its
position in the export market as it commits to investing in
 Italy , Prime Minister  Mario Monti ’s office said today.  Fiat wants to “re-orient its business model” in Italy to
help boost exports outside Europe, Monti’s office said in an
e-mailed statement after the premier met with Fiat Chief
Executive Officer  Sergio Marchionne  in Rome.  Fiat has suspended investments in Italy, reducing spending
by 500 million euros ($650 million) in Europe in 2012 and
delaying new models, as Marchionne has said he doesn’t expect
sales to recover in the region before 2014 at the earliest.
Turin-based Fiat, Italy’s biggest manufacturer, said Sept. 18
that it won’t give up on its home market, even as the carmaker
is set to lose 700 million euros in Europe this year.  The government and Fiat agreed to keep talking during the
next few weeks to find “conditions to strengthen the company’s
competitive capacity,” the statement said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
