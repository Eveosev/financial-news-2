Brandt Snedeker and  Justin Rose 
share the lead at 8-under par 202 as the PGA Tour Championship
enters its final round.  Snedeker fired a 6-under par 64 yesterday while Rose had a
bogey-free 68 in the third round of the match at East Lake Golf
Club in Atlanta.  Ryan Moore  is third at 6-under 204 after a
round of 65.  “My first goal for this week is achieved and that is to
have a chance going into Sunday,” Snedeker told reporters
yesterday. “It should be a lot of fun.”  Rory McIlroy trails by three strokes, one ahead of Tiger Woods. Snedeker, McIlroy or Woods, the only top-five seeds to
qualify for the Tour Championship, can secure the FedExCup title
and its $10 million bonus by winning today.  “It’s going to be one of the most exciting Sundays of the
year,” said McIlroy, who is tied with Bubba Watson and  Jim Furyk  at 5-under 205.  Woods’s two birdies on the back nine helped him stay in
contention. He is tied at 4-under 206 with Bo Van Pelt,  Robert Garrigus  and  Matt Kuchar .  “I’m playing for the ’W,’ and tomorrow I get a great shot
at it,” Woods told reporters yesterday. “All the money and
awards and all of that stuff, that comes along with winning
championships. That’s the way I’ve always looked at it, and
right now I’m four back.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
