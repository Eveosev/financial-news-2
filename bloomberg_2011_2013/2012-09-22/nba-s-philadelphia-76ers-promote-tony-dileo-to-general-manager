Tony DiLeo was promoted to general
manager of the  Philadelphia 76ers , the National Basketball
Association team said on its website.  The 76ers didn’t release terms of the agreement with DiLeo,
who was senior vice president of basketball operations.  “We are very confident that Tony has the experience and
knowledge to flourish in his new role, and we will continue to
provide him with the necessary tools and resources, including
enhancing our capabilities in analytics, to strengthen our
basketball operations department,” team owner  Josh Harris  said
last night in a statement.  DiLeo, 57, who is entering his 23rd season with the 76ers,
becomes the 12th general manager in franchise history. He was
promoted to his current position after serving as the team’s
senior vice president of basketball operations since September
2003, following a four-year run as the team’s director of player
personnel from 1999 to 2003.  During the 2008-09 season, DiLeo stepped in as head coach
following the 76ers’ 9-14 start and guided the team to a 32-27
mark the rest of the way. Of the eight teams that changed
coaches during that season, the Sixers were the only one to make
the playoffs.  To contact the reporter on this story:
