The Senate confirmed U.S.
ambassadors to Iraq and  Pakistan  in one of its last actions
before adjourning for a pre-election recess.  The Senate unanimously confirmed Rick Olson to be
ambassador to Pakistan, which has been the site of protests in
recent days over an amateur video made in the U.S. that
denigrated Islam.  The chamber also confirmed unanimously Robert Beecroft to
be ambassador to Iraq.  President  Barack Obama  nominated
Beecroft after his original choice, Brett McGurk, withdrew his
nomination in June after the disclosure of embarrassing personal
e-mails.  To contact the reporter on this story:
