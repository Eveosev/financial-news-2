McLaren driver  Lewis Hamilton  won
pole position for tomorrow’s Singapore Grand Prix, the third
time in the past four Formula One races he’s topped qualifying.  Hamilton posted a time of 1 minute, 46.362 seconds around
the Marina Bay street circuit to beat out Pastor Maldonado of
Williams by 0.44 seconds. Two-time defending world champion
Sebastian Vettel of Red Bull will start third.  It’s the fifth pole of the season for Hamilton, who’s won
two of the past three races to climb into second in the season
standings. He won from the front in Italy two weeks ago and also
at July’s Hungarian Grand Prix.  McLaren’s Jenson Button will start fourth ahead of points
leader  Fernando Alonso  of Ferrari. Force India’s Paul di Resta,
Red Bull’s Mark Webber, Lotus’s Romain Grosjean and Mercedes
teammates  Michael Schumacher  and Nico Rosberg round out the top
10 qualifiers.  Alonso leads the standings with 179 points. Hamilton has
142 points with Lotus’s  Kimi Raikkonen , who’ll start 12th
tomorrow, third with 141 and Vettel fourth with 140.  Marussia team driver Charles Pic will have 20 seconds added
to his race time after passing four red lights and overtaking
another car in the final practice, officials said on the F-1
 website .  In addition, Pic and his engineer must also perform a day
of community service on behalf of the Action for Road Safety
campaign established by the Federation Internationale de
l’Automobile, the sport’s governing body.  To contact the reporter on this story:
