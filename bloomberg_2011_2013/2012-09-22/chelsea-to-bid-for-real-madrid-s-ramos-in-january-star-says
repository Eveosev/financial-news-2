Chelsea is preparing to make a bid
for Real Madrid and Spain defender  Sergio Ramos  during the
January transfer period, the Daily Star said.  Ramos, 26, has fallen out with manager  Jose Mourinho  after
being dropped for Real’s Champions League opener against
Manchester City four days ago, the Star said.  Chelsea manager Roberto Di Matteo is desperate to
strengthen his defense after his club blew a two-goal lead
against Juventus in the Champions League and Ramos’s ability to
play in the middle and at right back make him an attractive
target, the Star said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
