South Africa  defeated host Sri
Lanka by 32 runs in a rain-shortened game to finish atop Group C
at the World Twenty20 cricket championship.  Play in Hambantota was reduced to seven overs per team from
20 after being delayed 2 1/2 hours at the start by rain. South
Africa finished 78-4 in its innings, with AB de Villiers scoring
30, then limited Sri Lanka to 46-5.  Both teams had already qualified for the second round after
beating Zimbabwe in their opening games. The top two in each of
the four three-team groups advance to a Super Eight stage, from
which the top two teams in each pool move into the semifinals.
The final is in  Colombo  on Oct. 7.  Australia meets the West Indies in todayâ€™s second match in
Colombo.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
