Usain Bolt of  Jamaica  won his third
consecutive 200-meter title at the World Athletics Championships
in a season-best time of 19.66 seconds.  The 26-year-old finished ahead of countryman Warren Weir
and Curtis Mitchell of the U.S. in Moscow, beating the previous
world best for the year of 19.73 seconds he set in Paris last
month.  Bolt took the lead on the turn and pulled away before
easing up ahead of the finish line. He set the world record of
19.19 seconds in winning the world title in Berlin in 2009 and
won in a time of 19.40 seconds two years ago in Daegu, South
Korea.  Bolt won the 100 meters six days ago and now has captured
seven gold medals at the  world championships . He may claim
another tomorrow in the 4x100-meter relay.  Host  Russia  won two gold medals on the next-to-last day of
the championships with Svetlana Shkolina winning the women’s
high jump and Yulia Gushchina, Tatyana Firova, Kseniya Ryzhova
and Antonina Krivoshapka taking the women’s 4x400-meter relay
ahead of the U.S. and Great Britain.  American Brianna Rollins beat defending champion Sally
Pearson of  Australia  in the women’s 100-meter hurdles, while
Uganda’s Stephen Kiprotich added the men’s marathon world title
to his Olympic championship.  Meseret Defar of  Ethiopia  won the gold medal in the women’s
5,000 meters and the Czech Republic’s Vitezslav Vesely took the
men’s javelin world title.  To contact the reporter on this story:
