U.K. government bonds fell for a
fourth week as signs the economy is gathering momentum fueled
speculation the  Bank of England  will raise  interest rates  sooner
than policy makers forecast.  Benchmark  10-year yields  climbed to the highest level since
August 2011 as investors boosted wagers the central bank will
increase its key rate before 2016, when policy makers anticipate
unemployment will have fallen enough to justify higher borrowing
costs. The pound strengthened for a second week against the
dollar and euro. Sterling has been the best-performing major
currency during the past six months.  “Until we hear some central-bank comments come out trying
to calm the markets, we’ll probably see this selloff continue”
on expectation of higher rates, said Owen Callan, an analyst at
Danske Bank A/S in Dublin. “We’ve seen the first big move
already and it may not be quite as volatile next week.”  The U.K. 10-year yield climbed 24 basis points, or 0.24
percentage points, this week to 2.70 percent, the biggest
increase since the period through June 21. The 1.75 percent bond
due September 2022 fell 1.875, or 18.75 pounds per 1,000-pound
($1,561) face amount, to 92.385. The yield rose to 2.71 percent
on Aug. 15, the highest since Aug. 9, 2011.  Data this week showed retail sales rose more in July than
economists forecast, while the rate for jobless claims dropped
to the lowest since February 2009. Purchasing managers surveys
of services, manufacturing and construction activity all
improved in July, according to figures released this month.  Jobless Rate  Bank of England Governor  Mark Carney  has pledged to refrain
from raising borrowing costs until the  unemployment rate  falls
to 7 percent, which policy makers don’t expect until at least
the fourth quarter of 2016. Seventeen of 25 forecasters in a
Bloomberg survey say unemployment will fall to that level by
mid-2016, with 13 saying it will happen in 2015 at the latest.  The implied yield on short-sterling futures contracts
expiring in September 2016 increased 38 basis points this week
to 2.21 percent, signaling traders added to bets that borrowing
costs will increase as the economy improves.  Gilts lost investors 4.6 percent this year through Aug. 15,
according to Bloomberg World Bond Indexes show. German bunds
dropped 2.4 percent and Treasuries declined 3.4 percent.  The pound climbed 0.8 percent this week to $1.5621 after
rising to $1.5657 yesterday, the highest since June 19. The U.K.
currency appreciated 0.9 percent to 85.28 pence per euro.  Sterling has appreciated 4 percent in the past six months,
the best performer of 10 developed-nation currencies tracked by
Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes. The euro gained 2.9
percent and the dollar rose 3.2 percent.  The Debt Management Office is scheduled to auction 1.75
billion pounds of inflation-linked gilts maturing in 2019 on
Aug. 20. The U.K. last sold similar securities in June 2010.  To contact the reporter on this story:
