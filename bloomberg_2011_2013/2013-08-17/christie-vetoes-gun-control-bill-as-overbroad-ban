Republican Governor  Chris Christie 
rejected a gun-control measure passed by the New Jersey
legislature, sending it back to lawmakers and saying it was so
broadly written it would ban target rifles and other weapons not
used in crimes.  Citing earlier versions of the bill, Christie said it had
been written to bar one specific type of long-range rifle, the
Barrett .50 caliber. Instead, he said the measure he received
was so sweeping it would criminalize ownership of all .50
caliber weapons and ammunition, including the $10,000, 35-pound
(16-kilogram) guns used by sport shooters.  “The wide scope of this total ban, therefore, will not
further public safety, but only interfere with lawful
recreational pastimes,” the governor said in his veto message.
The former federal prosecutor said it would turn law-abiding
sportsmen and women into criminals.  He called on lawmakers to make “commonsense improvements”
in state laws to deter criminals.  To contact the reporters on this story:
