Petroleo Brasileiro SA (PETR3) , the most
indebted publicly-traded  oil company , has agreed to sell $2.1
billion of assets that include stakes in Brazilian and U.S.
offshore petroleum fields.  China’s Sinochem Group is buying the Rio de Janeiro-based
company’s 35 percent stake in the offshore Parque das Conchas
project for $1.54 billion, Petrobras said in an e-mailed
 statement  today. The license includes the Ostra field that
pumped 21,000 barrels a day in June, according to the country’s
oil regulator.  Brazil’s state-controlled producer also agreed to sell
minority stakes in  Gulf of Mexico  oil fields for $185 million, a
stake in a petrochemicals company for 870 million reais ($364
million), and a 20 percent stake in a power company in Brazil’s
 Rio Grande  do Norte state for 38 million reais. The sales are
subject to regulatory approval.  Petrobras is selling debt and $9.9 billion in assets to
help finance about $47 billion a year of investments through
2017. It is scaling back its operations abroad and curbing cost
growth in Brazil as it develops the largest group of crude
discoveries in the past decade and builds refineries. Chief
Financial Officer Almir Barbassa said Aug. 12 it would
accelerate asset sales during the second half of this year.  In the Gulf of Mexico, Petrobras is selling stakes ranging
from 33 percent to 100 percent in the MC 613, GB 244 and EW 910
blocks that are all in production, the company said without
specifying the buyers.  To contact the reporter on this story:
