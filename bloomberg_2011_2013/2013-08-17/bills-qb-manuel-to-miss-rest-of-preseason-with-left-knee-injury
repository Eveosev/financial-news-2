Buffalo Bills rookie quarterback EJ
Manuel will miss the rest of the preseason with a knee injury,
the National Football League team said on its website.  Bills coach Doug Marrone said Manuel, the 16th overall pick
in April’s draft from  Florida State University , will undergo a
“minor knee procedure” after experiencing some swelling this
morning. He completed 10 of 12 passes for 92 yards and a
touchdown in last night’s 20-16 win over Minnesota.  Veteran Kevin Kolb will start next weekend’s preseason game
at Washington, Marrone said. The Bills open the regular season
Sept. 8 against  New England .  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
