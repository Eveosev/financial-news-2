New Zealand beat  Australia  47-29 to
open defense of its Rugby Championship title and deny Ewen McKenzie a winning start as Wallabies coach.  Ben Smith touched down three times as the world champion
All Blacks outscored the Wallabies six tries to two at Sydney’s
ANZ Stadium. Aaron Cruden scored a try and added three penalties
and three conversions to finish with 20 points.  Will Genia and James O’Connor scored the Australia tries
and Christian Leali’ifano added 19 points with the boot.  The match, which also opened the three-game Bledisloe Cup
series between the teams, was Australia’s first since McKenzie
replaced Robbie Deans last month following the 2-1 series loss
to the British and Irish Lions. Under Deans, the Wallabies won
just three of 18 Tests against the All Blacks.  Top-ranked New Zealand has held the Bledisloe Cup --
contested annually by the two countries -- since 2002 and will
ensure it keeps the trophy for the 11th straight series by
avoiding defeat in either of the remaining games at home on Aug.
24 and Oct. 19.  In the other match on the opening day of the southern
hemisphere’s annual rugby championship, South Africa scored nine
tries in routing Argentina 73-13 in Soweto.  JJ Englebrecht, Adriaan Strauss, Willem Alberts, Jean de Villiers, Fourie Du Preez, Bryan Habana, Duane Vermeulen and
Bismarck du Plessis all touched down for the Springboks, who
also got a penalty try. Morne Steyn kicked four penalties and
eight conversions to finish with 28 points for South Africa.  To contact the reporter on this story:
