Treasury  10-year-note yields  reached
the highest levels in two years on heightened speculation a
strengthening U.S. economy will prompt the  Federal Reserve  to
reduce its bond-buying program as soon as next month.  The biggest weekly increase in yields on the benchmark
security in more than a month pushed the difference between two-year notes to the most since July 2011, suggesting investors are
betting faster growth will lead to higher long-term borrowing
rates. The Fed’s first step may be tapering monthly debt
purchases in September by $10 billion to a $75 billion pace,
according to the median estimate of economists in a survey
concluded this week. The central bank will release minutes of
its July 30-31 meeting on Aug. 21.  “It seems to be the consensus that tapering is coming in
September,” said  Sean Murphy , a trader at Societe Generale SA
in New York, one of the 21 primary dealers that trade with the
U.S. central bank. “Until then, it’s a lot of noise.”  U.S. 10-year note yields rose 0.25 basis points to 2.83
percent, according to Bloomberg Bond Trader data. The price of
the 2.5 percent note maturing in August 2023 fell 2 4/32, or
$21.25 per $1,000 face value, to 97 5/32.  The yield rose to 2.86 percent yesterday, the highest since
Aug. 1, 2011. The increase  this week  is the most since the five
days ended July 5. That widened the gap to two-year note yields
to 249 basis points, the most since July 2011.  Economic Data  Treasuries have fallen 3.4 percent this year, according to
Bloomberg World Bond Indexes. German securities dropped 2.3
percent and gilts are little changed.  Yields surged Aug. 15 after a Labor Department report
showed the number of applications for unemployment insurance
payments declined by 15,000 to 320,000 in the week ended Aug.
10, the fewest since October 2007. That followed a Commerce
Department report two days earlier that said retail sales
increased for a fourth consecutive month.  “The retail-sales number was good, and that accelerated
the tapering talk,” said  Dan Greenhaus , chief global strategist
in New York at broker-dealer BTIG LLC.  Sixty-five percent of economists in a Bloomberg survey
conducted Aug. 9-13 said the Fed will trim its $85 billion of
monthly bond purchases at the next scheduled meeting Sept.
17-18. In a survey last month, half of respondents predicted a
September reduction.  “Tapering was already 100 percent priced in,” said
 Richard Gilhooly , an interest-rate strategist at TD Securities
Inc. in New York. “I don’t think the data this week changed
anything.”  TIPS Auction  Investors see a 51.1 percent chance policy makers will
raise the so-called federal funds rate to 0.5 percent or more by
January 2015, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  The Fed has kept its  target  for overnight lending between
banks in a range of zero to 0.25 percent since 2008.  The U.S. is scheduled to sell $16 billion in five-year
Treasury Inflation Protected Securities on Aug. 22. The last
sale of the securities in April was for $18 billion.  Fed policy makers have warned of the risks of prolonged
inflation below their 2 percent target even amid unprecedented
stimulus. The cost of living in the U.S. rose in July for a
third month, supporting the Fed’s forecast that inflation will
move closer to its target, based on Labor Department data
released Aug. 15.  Consumer prices increased 2 percent in the 12 months ended
in July after a 1.8 percent year-over-year gain the prior month.  “The numbers are a little bit on the weak side, but not
enough to change the mentality of the market right now,” said
Jason Rogan, director of U.S. government trading at Guggenheim
Partners LLC, a New York-based brokerage for institutional
investors. “For right now the market has made up its mind in
going to higher yields.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
