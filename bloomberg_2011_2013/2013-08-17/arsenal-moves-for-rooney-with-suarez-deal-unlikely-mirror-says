Arsenal will make a move for
Manchester United’s  Wayne Rooney  with their chances of signing
Liverpool’s Luis Suarez fading, the Mirror said.  Arsenal Chief Executive Ivan Gazidis made an approach to
both United and Rooney’s representatives this week, the Mirror
said. United manager  David Moyes  has said the striker is not for
sale and has turned down two bids from Chelsea.  Liverpool has rejected two bids from the Gunners for
Suarez, who returned to training yesterday after apologizing to
his teammates for trying to orchestrate a transfer. The
Uruguayan is suspended for the first six matches of the season
as he concludes a 10-game ban for biting Chelsea’s Branislav
Ivanovic in April.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
