Germany ’s 10-year government bonds
declined for a second week, pushing yields up by the most since
June, as signs the global economy is improving damped demand for
the euro region’s safest fixed-income assets.  Benchmark  yields  climbed to a 16-month high this week,
while rates in  France , the Netherlands and Finland all posted
the biggest increases in two months. Reports showed the euro-area’s economy emerged from a record-long recession in the
second quarter, while U.S. initial jobless claims dropped to the
lowest level in almost six years, spurring speculation the
Federal Reserve will slow stimulus.  “Economic data this week suggested the recession is either
over or getting less severe in the euro zone,” said Soeren Moerch, the head of fixed-income trading at  Danske Bank A/S (DANSKE)  in
Copenhagen. “Data in the U.S. support a view that the Fed may
start tapering its bond purchases soon. Those factors are
pushing yields in the core market higher.”  Germany’s 10-year bund yield climbed 20 basis points, or
0.2 percentage point, this week to 1.88 percent at 5 p.m. London
time yesterday, the biggest increase since the period ended June
21. The rate reached 1.91 percent on Aug. 15, the highest since
March 28, 2012. The 1.5 percent security due in May 2023 fell
1.755, or 17.55 euros per 1,000-euro (1,333) face amount, to
96.635.  French (GFRN10)  10-year yields rose 17 basis points this week, the
most since June 21, to 2.40 percent, while the rate on similar-maturity  Dutch (GNTH10YR)  bonds climbed 20 basis points to 2.26 percent,
also the biggest weekly increase since June 21.  Economy Expands  Gross domestic product in the euro region rose 0.3 percent
in the three months through June after shrinking 0.3 percent in
the previous quarter, the European Union statistic’s office said
on Aug. 14. A separate report yesterday showed exports from the
region increased for the first time in three months.  While the economy expanded, data yesterday showed consumer
prices in the currency bloc remain subdued last month. The
annual  inflation rate  was 1.6 percent, the same as in June. That
was in line with an earlier estimate released on July 31.  Spain’s 10-year bonds advanced for a fifth week, the
longest winning streak since May. The 10-year yield dropped 14
basis points from Aug. 9 to 4.36 percent yesterday, the  lowest 
since May 31. The rate on similar-maturity  Italian (GBTPGR10)  debt was
little changed at 4.19 percent after declining to 4.15 percent
on Aug. 13, the least since June 6.  German bonds may extend their decline next week before
euro-area services and manufacturing data that economists said
will add to evidence the region’s recovery is gaining momentum.
A composite index of services and manufacturing output rose to
50.9 in August from 50.5 in July, according to a Bloomberg
survey before the report from Markit Economics on Aug. 22.  German government bonds lost 2.4 percent this year through
Aug. 15, according to Bloomberg World Bond Indexes. Italy’s
securities returned 4.3 percent and  Spain (GSPG10YR) ’s earned 7.8 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
