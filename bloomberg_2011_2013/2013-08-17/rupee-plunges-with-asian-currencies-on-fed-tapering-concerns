The Indian rupee and  Indonesia ’s
rupiah led a weekly loss in Asian currencies on increasing
speculation the U.S. will scale back monetary stimulus as the
world’s biggest economy improves.  Indonesia’s currency slumped to the weakest level since
2009 and the rupee dropped to a record amid concern about
widening current-account deficits.  India  has seen its foreign-exchange  reserves  sink as much as 7 percent this year to $277
billion, while Indonesia’s holdings shrank 18 percent to $92.7
billion.  “Central banks are being tested, especially those in
Indonesia and India,” said Andy Ji, a foreign-exchange
strategist at  Commonwealth Bank of Australia (CBA)  in  Singapore .
“People just don’t have the confidence that they have enough
reserves to shore up their currencies.”  The Bloomberg-JPMorgan  Asia  Dollar Index, which tracks the
region’s 10 most-active currencies excluding the yen, lost 0.5
percent during the week to 115.35 in Singapore. The rupee fell
1.3 percent to 61.66 per dollar and reached an unprecedented
62.005 yesterday. The rupiah dropped 0.96 percent to 10,385 and
touched 10,435, the lowest since June 2009.  The  Federal Reserve  will reduce its $85 billion of monthly
bond purchases in September, according to 65 percent of
economists surveyed by Bloomberg. The program has boosted the
supply of dollars and driven demand for emerging-market assets.
Initial jobless claims in the U.S. fell to the least in almost
six years, official data showed this week.  India Measures  The  Reserve Bank  of India increased efforts this week to
stem the rupee’s plunge by cutting the amount local companies
can invest overseas without seeking approval to 100 percent of
their net worth, from 400 percent. The central bank has also
tightened cash supply, restricted currency derivatives and
curbed gold imports.  The rupee depreciated 11 percent this year, the second-worst performance among 12 of Asia’s most-traded currencies. The
current-account deficit was an unprecedented 4.8 percent of
gross domestic product in the 12 months through March. The
government aims to narrow that to 3.7 percent this year, Indian
Finance Minister Palaniappan Chidambaram told parliament in  New
Delhi  on Aug. 14.  Indonesia Deficit  Indonesia’s central bank reported yesterday that the
second-quarter current account  deficit  widened to a record $9.85
billion, from $5.82 billion in the first three months of the
year. Policy makers held the benchmark  reference rate  at 6.5
percent this week, as predicted by 16 of 25 analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg.  “ Bank Indonesia  has become more tolerant to the rupiah
trading lower,” said  Gundy Cahyadi , an economist at Oversea-Chinese Banking Corp. in Singapore. “The main problem is the
current-account position, which increasingly looks like it will
stay for a while and isn’t easily solved by monetary policy
alone.”  Malaysia’s ringgit slid 0.7 percent to 3.2770 per dollar
this week and reached a three-year low of 3.2838 yesterday after
Moody’s Investors Service said this week that the nation’s
sovereign rating could come under pressure due to the
government’s weakening fiscal position.  Bond Ownership  The country’s  current account  is forecast to have swung to
a deficit of 1 billion ringgit ($305 million) in the second
quarter, from a surplus of 8.7 billion ringgit in the prior
three months, according to the median estimate in a Bloomberg
News survey before government data due on Aug. 21.  “Balance of payments and current-account deficit or
surpluses, alongside foreign ownership of local bonds are a key
focus as we approach a period where liquidity will be removed
from the market by the U.S.,” London-based Martyn Harrison, a
currency options sales trader at Marex Spectron, wrote in a
research report yesterday. “It is clear Indonesia alongside
India and Malaysia have these problems in abundance.”  Elsewhere in Asia, the Philippine peso dropped 0.3 percent
to 43.63 per dollar this week and South Korea’s won lost 0.1
percent to 1,113.59. Thailand’s baht fell 0.1 percent to 31.27.
China’s  yuan  rose 0.2 percent to 6.1130 and reached a 19-year
high of 6.1090 yesterday. Taiwan’s dollar declined 0.2 percent
to NT$30.002.  To contact the reporter on this story:
