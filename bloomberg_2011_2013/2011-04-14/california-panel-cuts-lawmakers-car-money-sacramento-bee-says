The California Citizens
Compensation Commission voted to eliminate cars provided
legislators at taxpayer expense, the Sacramento Bee said.  Instead, lawmakers will be given a $300 monthly car
allowance for their own vehicles, effective in December, the
paper reported.   Salaries, health benefits and a $142 daily per diem for
living expenses weren’t changed by the commission, the paper
said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
