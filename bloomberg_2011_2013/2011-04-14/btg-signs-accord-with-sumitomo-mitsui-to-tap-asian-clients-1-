Banco BTG Pactual SA, the Brazilian
investment bank owned by billionaire  Andre Esteves , signed an
agreement with Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corp. allowing it to
distribute financial products to Asian clients.  BTG will develop structured products and securitization
operations with Sumitomo for corporate clients in Brazil and
stimulate international mergers and acquisitions, the Sao Paulo-
based bank said in an e-mailed statement today.  Brazilian debt and equity markets have attracted record
foreign capital flows as investors seek higher yields offered by
Latin America’s biggest economy. The fastest economic growth in
Brazil in more than two decades, fueled in part by record credit
expansion and employment, is also boosting foreign direct
investment.  Foreign currency inflows reached $35.6 billion in the year
through April 8, compared with $25.5 billion for all of last
year, according to central bank data released yesterday.  BTG is the fourth bank in the ranking of  Brazil ’s top
equity underwriters so far this year, having risen from seventh
last year, according to Bloomberg data. It’s ranked 16th in
coordination of mergers and acquisitions in Brazil, according to
Bloomberg data.  To contact the reporter on this story:
