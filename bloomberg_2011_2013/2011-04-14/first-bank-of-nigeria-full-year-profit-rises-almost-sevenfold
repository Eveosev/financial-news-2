First Bank of Nigeria Plc (FIRSTBAN) , the
nation’s second-largest lender by market value, said full-year
profit rose almost sevenfold as loans increased.  Net income advanced to 33.4 billion naira ($215.2 million)
from 4.9 billion naira a year earlier, it said in a statement on
the Lagos-based Nigerian Stock Exchange’s website. The median
estimate of seven analysts polled by Bloomberg was for profit of
43.8 billion naira. Loans and advances climbed 6 percent to 1.1
trillion naira, while revenue rose 19 percent to 231 billion
naira. The bank plans to pay a dividend of 60 kobo per share, it
said.  First Bank’s profit was “slightly below our estimate of 36
billion naira,” Adesoji Solanke, a Lagos-based analyst at
 Renaissance Capital , wrote in an e-mail to clients today.  The stock fell for the first day in four, losing 4.8
percent to 13.88 naira by the 2:30 p.m. close in Lagos, the
biggest drop since Oct. 6.  To contact the reporter on this story:
