China ’s yuan advanced to its
strongest level in 17 years on speculation the central bank will
tighten monetary policy further to tame inflation.  The currency gained as much as 0.06 percent as Hong Kong-
based Phoenix Television said on its website, citing an
unidentified source, that inflation in March was 5.3 percent,
the most since July 2008. Gross domestic product rose 9.4
percent from a year earlier last quarter, after increasing 9.8
percent in the previous three months, according to the median
estimate of economists in a Bloomberg survey. The National
Bureau of Statistics will release both sets of data tomorrow.  “GDP growth is still going to be strong and price
pressures remain,” said  Patrick Bennett , a Hong Kong-based
strategist at Standard Bank Group Ltd. “China will respond by
tightening policy with a combination of stronger currency, hikes
in  interest rates  and the reserve ratio.”  The yuan gained 0.04 percent to end at 6.5315 per dollar in
 Shanghai , according to the China Foreign Exchange Trade System.
It touched 6.5298, the strongest level since the country unified
official and market exchange rates at the end of 1993. In Hong
Kong’s offshore market, the yuan was little changed at 6.5215.  The People’s Bank of China set the currency’s reference
rate 0.05 percent higher at 6.5339 per dollar, the strongest
level since July 2005.  Twelve-month non-deliverable forwards were little changed
at 6.3790 per dollar as of 4:41 p.m. in  Hong Kong , reflecting
bets the yuan will gain 2.4 percent, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg.  An official in the statistics bureau’s press office, who
declined to be identified because of the agency’s rules, said he
couldn’t comment on the Phoenix Television report.  Policy makers will likely ask banks to set aside more cash
as reserves in the “near future,” the China Securities Journal
said in a front-page commentary. China has increased banks’
reserve-requirement ratio three times this year to limit the
risk of asset bubbles. The central bank has also raised
borrowing costs twice since the start of 2011.  To contact the reporter on this story:
