Ford Motor Co. (F)  will hire 1,200 new
employees in China by 2015, doubling its workforce as it seeks
market share in the world’s largest auto market.  “In China we’re going to significantly increase our
resources here,” Joe Hinrichs, chief of the automaker’s Asia-
Pacific and African operations, said today in  Shanghai . “We’re
committed to it, we have the capital, we have the products.”  Ford is banking on emerging markets to help it maintain
profits after posting $6.56 billion in net income last year, the
most since 1999. The Dearborn, Michigan-based company expects 70
percent of its growth in the next 10 years to come from the
Asia-Pacific region and  Africa , it said in September.  The automaker introduced its Mondeo sedan in  China  last
month and also sells Focus compact cars and Fiesta subcompacts
in the world’s second-largest economy. Its deliveries in China
surged 40 percent to a record 582,467 vehicles last year as
rising incomes and economic growth spurred auto demand. Sales
rose 20 percent last month, the company said April 7.  The hiring in China -- in departments including
engineering, manufacturing and marketing sales -- adds to the
more than 7,000 workers Ford plans to employ in the next two
years in  North America .  Ford is building a new vehicle plant with its China joint
venture Changan Ford Mazda Automobile Co. in Chongqing and has
plans for a new engine plant in the southwestern city.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
