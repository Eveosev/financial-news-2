Freenet AG, a German mobile-phone
and Internet operator, said it has replaced its existing
financing with a new bank loan and the placement of a corporate
bond.  Freenet replaced financing dating back to private equity
times, the Buedelsdorf, Germany-based company said in a
statement on the EANS newswire. The new financing is worth 740
million euros ($1.07 billion), the statement shows. Freenet also
extended the maturity of its borrowings to 2016 from 2014 and
said it will be less exposed to future interest-rate risks.  To contact the reporter on this story:
