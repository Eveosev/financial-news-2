Roger Goodell will speak with  New
York  Giants season-ticket holders on a conference call next
week, one of several conversations with fans the National
Football League commissioner is holding at the request of teams
as a lockout of players continues.  Giants broadcaster Bob Papa will host a 30-minute call on
April 20 with Goodell and the team’s seat-license and ticket
holders beginning at 1 p.m. New York time, Giants spokesman Pat Hanlon said in an e-mail.  Goodell spoke with Miami Dolphins ticketholders last night,
and is moving on to the  Cleveland Browns  and  San Diego Chargers 
this week, NFL spokesman  Greg Aiello  said in an e-mail. Goodell
will do the same at the request of the Giants and  San Francisco
49ers  next week, with individual teams responsible scheduling
the sessions, Aiello said.  Hanlon and Aiello didn’t provide further details. The
 Cleveland Plain Dealer  quoted Aiello as saying Goodell can speak
about issues related to the collective bargaining agreement but
is barred from discussing what’s taking place in mediation
sessions between the league and players.  NFL owners and players began those sessions before a
federal magistrate judge in Minneapolis today aimed at reaching
a deal on how to divide $9 billion in revenue, the most of any
sports league. The NFL shut down last month after the union
abandoned collective bargaining and sued the league in federal
court for violating antitrust law and wage fixing.  To contact the reporter on this story:
