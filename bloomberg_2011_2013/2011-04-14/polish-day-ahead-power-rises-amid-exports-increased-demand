Polish day-ahead electricity prices
increased in the past week amid rising exports and higher
demand. Rising imports from  Sweden  and warmer weather may push
prices lower.  Next-day baseload power climbed 1.2 percent to 213.17 zloty
($77.88) a megawatt-hour in the week ending today, according to
Bloomberg calculations based on Polish Power Exchange data.  Average daily electricity demand was as high as 18,988
megawatts this week, up 3.1 percent from last week’s maximum
daily average, according to  system load data . More power was
exported to  Germany  and the  Czech Republic  while imports from
Sweden increased as water reservoirs for electricity generation
climbed in the Nordic region.  Maximum temperatures in Warsaw may rise to 23 degrees
Celsius (73 Fahrenheit) on April 20 from today’s high of 12
degrees, according to CustomWeather Inc. data on Bloomberg.  Power producers in  Poland  will halt 1,415 megawatts of
generation capacity for the weekend, according to data from the
grid operator.  To contact the reporter on this story:
