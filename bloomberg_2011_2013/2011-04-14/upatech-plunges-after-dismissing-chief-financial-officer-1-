Lupatech SA (LUPA3) ,  Brazil ’s biggest
provider of oil equipment and services, fell for a sixth
straight day after the company dismissed Chief Financial Officer
Thiago Alonso de Oliveira.  Alexandre Jose Guerra de Castro Monteiro will replace
Oliveira and take the newly created position of vice president
of finance, the company said in a regulatory filing yesterday.
Lupatech didn’t give a reason for Oliveira’s removal.  “The company has posted weak operational results, with
declining profit margins and low cash flow,” said Artur Delorme, an analyst at Rio de Janeiro-based brokerage Ativa
Corretora. “This is probably not the best time for changes in a
position as important as the CFO.”  Lupatech fell 2.5 percent to 12.69 reais at the close of
 Sao Paulo  trading at 4:15 p.m. New York time, and has tumbled
7.4 percent since April 12. The stock lost 34 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
