Morgan Stanley’s  James Gorman 
received a $14 million compensation package for his first year
as chief executive officer, less than the $15 million he was
awarded for 2009, as the firm missed profit goals.  Gorman, 52, got a $1.55 million cash bonus, his first since
at least 2007, according to a proxy filing yesterday by the New
York-based firm. He also received a deferred cash bonus of $2.33
million that can be clawed back, in addition to his salary,
stock, option awards and other compensation. About $1.94 million
of Gorman’s $5.82 million in stock compensation is tied to
company performance measures.  The package trailed the $23.6 million that  JPMorgan Chase &
Co. (JPM)  awarded CEO  Jamie Dimon , 55, and the $19.1 million that
Goldman Sachs Group Inc. granted CEO  Lloyd Blankfein , 56.  Morgan
Stanley (MS) , owner of the world’s largest brokerage, fell 8.1
percent last year, lagging behind the share performance of those
two rivals. The firm posted a $4.7 billion annual profit, the
most since 2006.  “We were mindful of the environment and the fact that we
did not meet all of our financial performance priorities for the
year,” Gorman wrote in a letter to shareholders yesterday.
“That is why my own compensation as CEO was down from last
year.”  Morgan Stanley said measures that missed goals included
return on equity, which was 9 percent for 2010. The company also
increased the portion of employees’ year-end compensation that’s
deferred and subject to clawbacks, Gorman wrote.  ‘Challenging Market Conditions’  In January, the company said that members of the operating
committee would get an average of 80 percent of their year-end
pay in deferred compensation in an effort to link bonuses with
long-term performance, up from 75 percent for 2009. For all
employees, the deferred portion rose to 60 percent from 40
percent a year earlier.  After facing “challenging market conditions amidst the
regulatory and market uncertainty” in 2010, there’s evidence of
a global economic recovery led by the U.S. as the unemployment
rate declines, Gorman said in a separate  letter  yesterday.  “We have also seen signs of improving corporate confidence
reflected in M&A activity, higher investor engagement and
ongoing growth in emerging markets,” Gorman wrote. The firm is
“particularly focused” on building its operations in  China ,
 Brazil  and  India , he wrote.  Gorman received a lower stock award and less deferred cash
than last year, and was awarded a cash bonus and $3.5 million in
options after receiving neither last year.  $10 Billion Bailout  Gorman, who was co-president of the firm before taking the
top job, declined a bonus for 2008, when Morgan Stanley
converted to a  bank holding company  and accepted a $10 billion
government bailout. The company repaid the taxpayer funds in
June 2009.  Chairman  John Mack  was not listed among the bank’s named
executive officers. He received restricted shares valued at $2
million, according to a filing in January. Mack declined a bonus
for 2007, 2008 and 2009, his final years as CEO.  Ruth Porat, 53, the firm’s chief financial officer,
received $11.5 million in total compensation for 2010. The
package included a $1.48 million cash bonus, $5.2 million in
stock and options, $4.07 million in deferred cash and at-risk
stock, and $756,100 in salary and other benefits.  Chammah, Fleming  Walid Chammah, 57, chairman of Morgan Stanley
International, received $10.6 million in total compensation for
last year. The package included a $1.74 million cash bonus,
$2.61 million in stock awards, $4.34 million in deferred cash
and at-risk stock, and $1.95 million in salary and other
benefits.  Greg Fleming , 48, who joined the firm last year as head of
asset management and now also oversees the retail-brokerage
unit, got a $10 million package. That included a $1.4 million
cash bonus, $4 million in stock and options, $3.9 million in
deferred cash and at-risk stock, and a $671,918 salary.  Thomas Nides, 50, who left the firm after being confirmed
in December as U.S. deputy secretary of state for management and
resources, received total compensation of $9.1 million for 2010.  Morgan Stanley also asked shareholders to set aside 35
million shares to cover 2011 compensation amid calls from
regulators that stock comprises a greater proportion of pay.
Shareholders last year approved 38 million additional shares to
be used for equity-based compensation for 2010.  To contact the reporter on this story:
