New Zealand ’s statistics agency
resumed surveying businesses and households in Canterbury after
an earthquake in late February disrupted data collection and
delayed publication of some reports.  The agency expects to release balance-of-payments and
employment figures for the three months through March on
schedule, it said in a statement today on its  website . The
first-quarter gross domestic product report may be delayed by
two weeks.  About 250 Statistics New Zealand workers are operating from
temporary premises after the Feb. 22 temblor closed their office
in Christchurch, the nation’s second-largest city. Resumption of
surveys means the agency will be able to measure manufacturing,
building activity, price changes, manufacturing output and
employment for all but the most-affected companies, it said
today.  The GDP report was to have been published June 23 and the
delay will let the agency ensure the results are up to standard,
it said. The balance of payments report is on schedule for
release on June 22 and the employment report is slated for May
5.  To contact the reporter on this story:
