expectations. “Overall, we see the results as slightly
negative,” analysts with Rye, Man & Gore Securities wrote. The
retailer’s global depositary receipts fell 6.7 percent to
$38.25.  OAO Surgutneftegas (SNGS RX), OAO Rosneft (ROSN RX) and OAO
 Tatneft (TATN)  (TATN3 RX) all fell even as crude for May delivery rose
as much as $1.05 a barrel in  New York . “There are rising
concerns about a correction in  oil prices ,”  Yaroslav Lissovolik , head of research at Deutsche Bank AG in Moscow,
wrote in response to e-mailed questions.  Surgutneftegas dropped 3.1 percent to 29.546 rubles,
Rosneft declined 3 percent to 244.95 rubles and Tatneft lost 2.6
percent to 180.38 rubles.  Russia may introduce export duties on oil products to help
contain price growth, Energy Minister Sergei Shmatko told
