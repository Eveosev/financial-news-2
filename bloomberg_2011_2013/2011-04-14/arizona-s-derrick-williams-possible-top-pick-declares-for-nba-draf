University of Arizona sophomore
forward Derrick Williams will enter this year’s  National
Basketball Association  draft after scoring more points in his
first two seasons than any player in school history.  Williams is projected as the No. 1 pick by
 NBAdraftnet.com  and said he intends to hire an agent, which
would mean forfeiting his remaining college eligibility.  The 6-foot-8 Williams averaged 19.5 points and 8.3 rebounds
last season and was voted the Pacific-10 Conference’s player of
the year. He led the Wildcats to the final eight of the National
Collegiate Athletic Association men’s tournament where they lost
65-63 to eventual champion Connecticut.  “We are all excited to follow his journey to the NBA, and
I have no doubt he will be very successful as an NBA player,”
Arizona coach Sean Miller said in a  statement .  Williams joins underclassmen such as Duke University
freshman Kyrie Irving and  Connecticut  junior Kemba Walker in
declaring for the NBA draft, which is scheduled for June 23 in
Newark,  New Jersey .  To contact the reporter on this story:
