OAO Gazprom’s management has
proposed paying a 2010 dividend of 2.70 rubles a share, 13
percent more than a year earlier, a person familiar with the
situation said today.  That would be the highest payout on record, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  Gazprom, Russia’s gas export monopoly, may pay 17.5 percent
of net income as dividends, the person said after the management
submitted dividend proposals for consideration by the board of
directors.  Gazprom paid 2.39 rubles a share for 2009, also based on
17.5 percent of profit to Russian accounting standards. Last
year, the company increased the maximum possible dividend
payment to 35 percent of net income from 30 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
