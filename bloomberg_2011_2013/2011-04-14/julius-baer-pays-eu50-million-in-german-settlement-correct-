(Corrects currency conversion in first paragraph.)  Julius Baer Group Ltd. (BAER) , the Zurich-
based wealth manager, agreed with German authorities on a one-
time payment of 50 million euros ($73 million) to end
investigations over undeclared client assets.  “We’re enjoying very good business momentum,” Chief
Executive Officer Boris Collardi told reporters on a conference
call, saying “we don’t want to interrupt the business of the”
German franchise. “This is why we’ve decided to enter very
short negotiations,” he said.  Baer was investigated over possible undeclared assets by
German nationals after authorities received data through
purchases and voluntary disclosures. The bank is building its
business outside Switzerland as a crackdown on tax evaders by
authorities from  Germany  to the U.S. is making private banking
in  Switzerland  less attractive for foreign customers.  Baer has offices in Munich, Stuttgart, Dusseldorf,
Wuerzburg, Hamburg and Kiel. The bank acquired net new client
assets in 2010 and increased the number of relationship managers
at the beginning of 2011.  Collardi said he doesn’t expect similar agreements to
follow as the German market is “peculiar.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
