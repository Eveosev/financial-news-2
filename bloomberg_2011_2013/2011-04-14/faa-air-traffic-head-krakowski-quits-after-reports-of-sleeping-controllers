The  Federal Aviation
Administration ’s chief operating officer stepped down following
a string of reports of air-traffic controllers falling asleep on
the job.  Henry Krakowski, a former head of flight operations for
United Airlines, resigned after meeting with FAA Administrator
 Randy Babbitt , the agency said in a statement today. Krakowski,
56, was in charge of controllers at the agency. David Grizzle, 
the FAA’s chief counsel, will take the job as the agency seeks a
replacement.  “Over the last few weeks we have seen examples of
unprofessional conduct on the part of a few individuals that
have rightly caused the traveling public to question our ability
to ensure their safety,” Babbitt said in the statement. “This
conduct must stop immediately.”  The FAA said yesterday two more controllers were caught
sleeping on the job, bringing to four the number the agency has
reported this year. That number may grow. Two controllers were
suspended for failing to hand off control of a departing plane
in Lubbock,  Texas , on March 29 and for failing to respond until
contact attempts were repeated, the FAA said yesterday.  Krakowski was named to his FAA post in 2007, and was only
the second person to fill the job Congress created in 2000.  To contact the reporter on this story:
