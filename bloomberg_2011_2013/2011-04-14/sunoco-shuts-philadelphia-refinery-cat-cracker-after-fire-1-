Sunoco Inc. (SUN)  shut a gasoline-making
fluid catalytic cracker in the Girard Point section of its
Philadelphia refinery after a fire late yesterday, boosting the
price of spot gasoline.  “We had a small flange fire that was immediately
extinguished by the operator on duty,” Thomas Golembeski, a
Sunoco spokesman, said in an e-mail. “To effect repairs, we
shut down the FCC at Girard Point. We expect to return the unit
to service shortly.”  The premium for reformulated, 87-octane gasoline in New
York Harbor gained 0.18 cent to 1.18 cents a gallon versus
futures traded on the  New York Mercantile Exchange  at 2:31 p.m.
Prompt delivery fell 0.59 cent to $3.2465 a gallon.  “The market got a pop,” said  Tom Knight , vice president
of trading and supply at Truman Arnold Cos. in Texarkana, Texas.  Gasoline for May delivery rose as much as 2.55 cents after
Sunoco said it shut the fuel-making unit, before falling 0.77
cent to settle at $3.2347 a gallon.  A pinhole leak was discovered earlier this week in an
expansion joint associated with the unit, two people with
knowledge of the situation said April 12. The joints absorb
expansions and contractions caused by extreme changes in
temperature.  The Sunoco refinery has a capacity of 355,000 barrels a
day, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
