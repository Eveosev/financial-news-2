The original handwritten manuscript
by John Lennon of the lyrics for The Beatles’ hit “Lucy in the
Sky With Diamonds” is to be put up for auction in Beverly Hills
next month, the Daily Telegraph reported, citing Profiles, the
auctioneers.  The manuscript, which contains the song’s opening words and
a rough sketch of four people in a room with curtain-draped
windows, may fetch at least $200,000, the newspaper reported.  The song, which featured on “Sgt. Pepper’s Lonely Hearts
Club Band,” has been for years regarded by many as being in
praise of the hallucinogenic drug LSD, based on the offbeat
lyrics and the fact that the opening phrase, “Lucy in the Sky
With Diamonds,” spells out the initials of the drug, the
Telegraph said.  Lennon always disputed that and in 1997 a British woman,
Lucy Vodden, said she had been the song’s inspiration; “Sgt.
Pepper” was ranked by Rolling Stone magazine as the top album
in the 500 greatest of all time, the newspaper added.     Click here for web link  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
