Indonesia ’s rupiah was little
changed near a seven-year high on speculation the central bank
is intervening to check gains that may threaten exports.
Benchmark bonds slipped.  The currency has appreciated 3.6 percent this year, the
second-best performance among the 10 most-traded Asian
currencies, as overseas investors bought $1.5 billion more local
stocks than they sold.  Bank Indonesia  wants to ensure the rupiah
doesn’t strengthen too fast, Deputy Governor Hartadi Sarwono
told reporters on April 12.  “The central bank is trying to stem the appreciation
through intervention,” said Mika Martumpal, a currency analyst
at PT Bank Commonwealth in Jakarta. “What Bank Indonesia wants
is to ensure that the rupiah isn’t volatile. They still prefer
the rupiah to be strong to manage inflation.”  The Indonesian currency was little changed at 8,669 per
dollar as of 4:50 p.m. in Jakarta, compared with 8,663 yesterday,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The rupiah touched
8,637 earlier this week, the strongest level since April 2004.  Consumer prices in  Southeast Asia ’s largest economy rose
6.65 percent last month from a year earlier, compared with an
increase of 6.84 percent in February, according to official data
released April 1.  Ten-year  government bonds  fell. The yield on the 8.25
percent note due July 2021 climbed three basis points to 7.63
percent, according to prices from the Inter-Dealer Market
Association. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  To contact the reporter on this story:
