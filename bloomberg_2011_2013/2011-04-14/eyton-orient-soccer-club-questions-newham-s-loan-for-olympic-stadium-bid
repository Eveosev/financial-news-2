Leyton Orient, an east London lower
division soccer team, is seeking a judicial review of a 40
million-pound ($65 million) loan from Newham borough that’s
helping West Ham take over the 2012 Olympic stadium.  The League One team is contending that the loan to a
“stadium company” is unlawful, and will try to stop the
financial support, its lawyers, Mishcon de Reya, said today in
an e-mailed statement. The borough put in a successful joint bid
to use the stadium with West Ham after the end of the Games.
Fellow Premier League team Tottenham is also challenging the
borough’s involvement.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
