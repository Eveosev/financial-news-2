Ireland’s National Asset Management
Agency took control of some property owned by real-estate
investor Derek Quinlan and his family, as they failed to agree
on a debt repayment plan.  The agency, created by the government to buy risky
commercial loans from Ireland’s debt-laden banks, appointed Paul
McDowell of Knight Frank LLP as receiver.  The move is a result “of the debtors’ failure to present
and agree an appropriate business plan for the repayment of
loans owed to the agency,” the Dublin-based agency said in an
e-mailed statement.  Quinlan, a former Irish tax inspector, was one of Ireland’s
biggest real estate investors during the boom which collapsed in
2007. His Dublin-based investment advisory firm Quinlan Private
bought the Claridges, Connaught and Savoy hotels in  London  for
753 million pounds ($1.1 billion) in May 2004. He then sold the
Savoy to billionaire Saudi Prince Alwaleed Bin Talal eight
months later for 224.5 million pounds.  Quinlan stepped down as chairman and partner of Quinlan
Private, an international property and private equity company,
in July 2009, following 20 years with the firm.  “If debtors are unrealistic or uncooperative in their
dealings with NAMA, we won’t hesitate to appoint receivers to
protect the taxpayers interests,” the agency said.  Banks have sold 72.3 billion euros of loans to the agency
at an average discount of 58 percent. NAMA wants Quinlan to sell
a building in London, which houses Citgroup Inc., the Irish
Times said on April 12, without citing anyone.  To contact the reporter on this story:
