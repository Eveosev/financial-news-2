Ugandan police arrested opposition
leader Kizza Besigye after security forces broke up a march he
was leading to protest rising food and fuel costs, Wavah
Broadcasting Service television reported.  Besigye was detained after police tear-gassed supporters
who were attempting to protect him, WBS said.  It is the second time Besigye has been arrested in three
days for organizing protests against rising inflation. At least
three other opposition lawmakers were also arrested today,
Margaret Wokuri, a spokeswoman for the opposition, said by phone
from the capital, Kampala.  Besigye lost the Feb. 18 election to President Yoweri Museveni. The vote was rejected by four opposition candidates,
who alleged irregularities.  To contact the reporter on this story:
