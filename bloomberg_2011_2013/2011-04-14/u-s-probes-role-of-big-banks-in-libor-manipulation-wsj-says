U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission officials are collaborating with Justice Department
investigators to see if big banks in  Europe  and the U.S.
colluded to manipulate the London Interbank Offered Rate, or
Libor, the Wall Street Journal reported, citing people familiar
with the matter.  The investigation is examining the behavior of the banks
imediately before and during the financial crisis, in particular
whether they understated their own borrowing costs, which are
used to set Libor, the newspaper said.  The joint probe is trying to establish whether major banks
formed a cartel to decide on how to report borrowing costs
between 2006 and 2008, the WSJ said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
