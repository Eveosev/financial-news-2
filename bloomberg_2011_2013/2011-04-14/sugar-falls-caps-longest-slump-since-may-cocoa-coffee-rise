Sugar futures fell, capping the
longest slump in 11 months, on speculation that supplies are
sufficient to meet demand as output rises in  Brazil  and
 Thailand , the world’s largest exporters. Cocoa and coffee
climbed.  Brazil will boost sugar production to 34.6 million metric
tons this year from 33.5 million tons a year earlier, according
to Unica, an industry group. Thailand’s output for the season
that began Oct. 1 may reach an all-time high, German researcher
F.O. Licht said. Prices in New York have dropped 36 percent
since touching a 30-year high in February.  “Weather in Brazil is encouraging for millers, and
harvesting will be coming onstream fully by the end of this
month,” Nick Penney, an analyst at London-based Sucden
Financial, said in a report.  Raw sugar for July delivery fell 0.59 cent, or 2.5 percent,
to settle at 23.06 cents a pound at 2 p.m. on ICE Futures U.S.
in  New York . That marked the fifth straight drop, the longest
slide since May. Earlier, the price touched 22.95 cents, the
lowest for a most-active contract since Oct. 5.  In London, refined-sugar futures for August delivery
declined $2.80, or 0.4 percent, to $638.40 a ton on NYSE Liffe.
Earlier, the price touched $628.80, the lowest since Oct. 7.  Cocoa futures for July delivery rose $57, or 1.9 percent,
to $3,127 a ton on ICE. In London, cocoa futures for July
delivery advanced 14 pounds, or 0.7 percent, to 1,960 pounds
($3,205) a ton.  Arabica-coffee futures for July delivery gained 1.45 cents,
or 0.5 percent, to $2.8515 a pound in New York. Robusta-coffee
futures for July delivery fell $31, or 1.2 percent, to $2,469 a
ton in  London .  To contact the reporter on this story:
