Ten directors of Venezuelan
brokerages who were arrested last year on suspicion of
participating in a parallel  currency market  have been formally
charged, the Venezuelan attorney general’s office said in a
statement today.  Four directors of Econoinvest Casa de Bolsa CA, formerly
 Venezuela ’s largest brokerage, were accused of illegally selling
foreign currency and conspiracy, the statement said. Directors
from Positiva Sociedad de Corretaje, Venevalores Casa de Bolsa,
Multinvest Casa de Bolsa and Banvalor Casa de Bolsa were also
charged. All the brokerages have since been shut down by the
government.  President  Hugo Chavez  stepped up currency controls last
year by shutting down an unregulated market in which brokerages
obtained foreign currency for importers by swapping bonds for
dollars. He accused the bond houses of speculation and stoking
inflation after the bolivar slid to a record low of 8.2 bolivars
per dollar in May 2010.  Chavez’s government sets an official exchange rate of 4.3
bolivars per dollar while permitting some dollar purchases at
5.3 per dollar through a central bank-administered market set up
last year to replace the parallel market.  To contact the reporter on this story:
