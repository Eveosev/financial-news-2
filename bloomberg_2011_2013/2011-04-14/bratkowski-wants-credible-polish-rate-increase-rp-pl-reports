Poland’s central bank should raise
 interest rates  by 50 basis points at its next meeting to boost
the zloty and help curb imported inflation pressure, Andrzej Bratkowski of the Monetary Policy Council was quoted today as
saying on the newspaper  Rzeczpospolita ’s Rp.pl website.   Such a move would be greeted as “credible” by the markets
and should be followed by a pause, Bratkowski said, adding that
the rate-setting panel may opt for a smaller, quarter-point
increase, according to rp.pl.  Bratkowski said policy makers are in a “difficult
situation” because strong upward price pressure is coming from
abroad while the zloty remains “undervalued,” the newspaper
reported.  “A strategy must be found that will allow our currency to
strengthen without permitting demand to generate inflation
pressure,” Rp.pl quoted Bratkowski as saying. “Small, quick
rate increases would curb price growth and absorb external
inflation pressure.”   If domestic borrowing costs rise and global price increases
ease,  Poland ’s inflation rate should begin to fall in three or
four months, Bratkowski said, according to Rp.pl. The central
banker said he doesn’t expect wage pressure to appear, the
newspaper reported.  Click here for web link  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
