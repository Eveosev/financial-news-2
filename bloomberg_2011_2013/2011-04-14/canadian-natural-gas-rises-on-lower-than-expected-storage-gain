Canadian natural gas for May
delivery rose after the U.S. Energy Department said reserves of
the fuel in underground storage increased less than analysts’
estimates last week.  U.S. gas in underground storage rose 28 billion cubic feet
to 1.607 trillion in the week ended April 8, the Energy
Department said today. Analysts in a Bloomberg survey estimated
supplies would rise 35 billion cubic feet.  “There may be some additional gas burn with nuclear and
coal” power plant maintenance, said  Martin King , senior
commodities analyst with FirstEnergy Capital Corp. in Calgary.  Alberta  gas for May delivery rose 6.5 cents, or 1.4
percent, to C$3.41 per gigajoule ($3.36 per million British
thermal units) as of 2:55 p.m. New York time, according to  NGX, 
a Canadian Internet market. Gas traded on the exchange goes to
users in  Canada  and the U.S. and is priced on TransCanada’s
Alberta system.  Natural gas for May delivery on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange  gained 7.1 cents, or 1.7 percent, to settle at $4.212
per million Btu.  Spot prices at U.S. delivery points fell after forecasters
said a snowstorm crossing Alberta and the U.S. Plains states
today won’t cause flurries in larger Midwest cities. Demand for
heat in  Chicago  will top out at 34 percent above normal tomorrow
and then fade to below-normal levels by April 19, according to
Belton, Missouri-based forecaster Weather Derivatives.  Alliance, Kingsgate  Gas at the Alliance Pipeline delivery point near Chicago
fell 1.79 cents to $4.2025 per million British thermal units on
the  Intercontinental Exchange . Alliance is an express line that
can carry about 1.5 billion cubic feet a day to the Midwest from
western Canada.  At the Kingsgate point on the border of  Idaho  and British
Columbia, gas tumbled 9.01 cents, or 2.2 percent, to $3.9272,
according to ICE. At Malin,  Oregon , where Canadian gas is traded
for California markets, gas was down 6.87 cents to $4.0506.  Volume on  TransCanada Corp.’s  Alberta system, which
collects the output of most of the nation’s gas wells, was 16.3
billion cubic feet as of 2 p.m. in  New York , about 62 million
above its target level.  Gas was flowing at a daily rate of 2.76 billion cubic feet
at Empress, Alberta, where the fuel is transferred to
TransCanada’s main line.  At McNeil, Saskatchewan, where gas is transferred to the
Northern Border Pipeline for shipment to the Chicago area, the
daily flow rate was 1.51 billion cubic feet.  Available capacity on TransCanada’s British Columbia system
at Kingsgate was 672 million cubic feet. The system was forecast
to carry 1.84 billion cubic feet today, about 73 percent of its
capacity of 2.51 billion.  The volume on  Spectra Energy’s  British Columbia system,
which gathers the fuel in northeastern British Columbia for
delivery to Vancouver and the Pacific Northwest, totaled 2.87
billion cubic feet at 2:05 p.m.  To contact the reporter on this story:
