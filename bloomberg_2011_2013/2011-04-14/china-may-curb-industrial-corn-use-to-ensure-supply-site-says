China  may toughen curbs on the
amount of corn used by biochemical and food-additive makers to
ensure limited supplies can meet demand for livestock feed,
industry website Cngrain.com said, citing unidentified sources.  The government may also limit the operations and expansion
of corn-based chemical and starch makers and adjust value-added
taxes applied to the sector, Cngrain.com said in a report today.  Authorities earlier this year investigated stockpiles held
by companies in Jilin and Heilongjiang provinces to prevent
hoarding and ordered some corn processors in the regions not to
buy the grain as part of a plan to cool surging prices, the
report said.  Chinaâ€™s corn stockpiles may be insufficient to meet demand,
forcing the country to buy as much as 3 million metric tons
before the end of the 2010-2011 marketing year, U.S. Grains
Council President Thomas C. Dorr said April 5.  Cngrain.com is owned by the China Grain Reserves Corp.,
which manages state grain reserves.  --William Bi. Editors:  Matthew Oakley , Jarrett Banks  To contact the reporter on this story:
