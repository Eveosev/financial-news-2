Colombia ’s peso bonds rose, pushing
yields to their lowest level in three months, as economists cut
inflation forecasts and as bets mounted that funds from
 government securities  maturing next month will be reinvested in
debt.  The yield on the nation’s 9.25 percent bonds due May 2014
fell 2 basis points, or 0.02 percentage point, to 6.71 percent
at 4:13 p.m. New York time, according to Colombia’s stock
exchange. That’s the lowest on a closing basis since Jan. 14.
The bond’s price rose 0.038 centavo to 106.858 centavos per
peso.  “Inflation expectations have gone down significantly,
marking a return of investors to” peso bonds, known as TES,
said Francisco Chaves, an analyst at Bogota-based brokerage
Corredores Asociados SA. “We’re also going to have a lot of
liquidity coming into the market, which will benefit the TES
curve in general, but probably in a greater part the 2014
bonds.”  About 11 trillion pesos ($6.1 billion) of TES are coming
due next month, according to Chaves.  Economists lowered their predictions for year-end inflation
to 3.31 percent in a central bank survey published earlier this
week, from 3.48 percent in the March survey. The central bank
targets inflation between 2 percent and 4 percent this year.  Colombia’s peso jumped the most in two weeks, gaining 0.8
percent to 1,804.50 per  U.S. dollar  from 1,818.83 yesterday. The
peso has advanced 4.1 percent in the past month, the second-best
performance after the Brazilian real among the six major Latin
American currencies.  Tax Deadline  Finance Minister Juan Carlos Echeverry said in an interview
today with Bogota-based Radio Super that he would analyze the
need for measures to ease gains in the peso after April 25 when
companies have finished paying their taxes.  “It doesn’t make sense at the moment to take specific
measures,” he said.  Earlier this month, Echeverry said that gains in the peso
are a result of companies bringing in funds from overseas to pay
local taxes and ruled out taking measures to ease the
appreciation given the “temporary” nature of the inflows.  To contact the reporter on this story:
