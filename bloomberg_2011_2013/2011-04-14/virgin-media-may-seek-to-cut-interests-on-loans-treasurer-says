Virgin Media Inc. (VMED) , the U.K.’s
second-largest pay-television company, may try to negotiate more
favorable terms on its loans this year after its credit rating
was upgraded and companies such as  Continental AG (CON)  were
successful in reducing their borrowing costs.  Continental,  Europe ’s second-largest car-parts maker, on
March 29 locked in a margin of 300 basis points for three years
to replace debt due to expire this year that cost a margin of
475 basis points and 500 basis points. That compares with an
average of 445 basis point-margin for leveraged borrowers in
Europe, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  “I don’t think it’s escaped anyone’s attention that the
margins on our bank debt now are in excess of what companies
with ratings comparable to ours have managed to secure recently
on refinancing,” Vrigin Treasurer Rick Martin said today at a
presentation in  London . “It’s incumbent upon us to have a good
look at that and see what the prospects are for bringing those
rates a bit more into line.”  Fitch Ratings increased Virgin Media’s long-term issuer
default rating by one level to BB+ on Feb. 17 citing a strong
business model and “significant” reductions in net borrowings.  A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  To contact the reporter on this story:
