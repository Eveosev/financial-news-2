Carlsberg A/S sometimes will pay
small "facilitation" payments to public officials to ensure
routine processes such as the granting of visas move forward,
Berlingske reported, citing comments from Vibeke Aggerholm, vice
president of internal audits.   Employees are required to get approval for such payments,
which must be of a "limited amount," from their managers, the
Copenhagen-based Berlingske said, citing Aggerholm.           Jens Bekke, a spokesman for Carlsberg, confirmed
Aggerholm’s comments in a telephone interview today. "It is only
exceptional and only in very small amounts," Bekke said. "We are
against it, and we are working against it."   Click here for web link  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
