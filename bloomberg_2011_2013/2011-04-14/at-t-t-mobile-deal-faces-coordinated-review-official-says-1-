AT&T Inc. (T) ’s proposed purchase of T-
Mobile USA Inc. faces a coordinated review by antitrust and
communications agencies, a U.S. official said today.  The official, an aide at the Federal Communications
Commission, spoke on condition of anonymity because Dallas-based
AT&T hasn’t yet submitted the purchase for agency approval.  AT&T on March 20 proposed buying  Deutsche Telekom AG (DTE) ’s T-
Mobile in a $39 billion deal that would combine the second- and
fourth-largest carriers to create a new market leader, ahead of
 Verizon Wireless .  The deal needs approval from the FCC and  Justice
Department , and is to face hearings in Congress. The FCC and
Justice Department will work on parallel tracks, and coordinate
with one another, said the official who declined to be named in
a telephone conference call with reporters.  FCC guidelines call for the agency to decide mergers within
180 days of an application being deemed complete, and reviews
can take longer. Another official on the call who also declined
to be named said the agency isn’t limited to 180 days, and the
deal would be decided as promptly as is reasonable.  AT&T intends to file its application at the FCC around
April 21, Michael Balmoris, a Washington-based spokesman, said
in an e-mail.  To contact the reporter on this story:
