Italian lenders, including  Intesa
Sanpaolo SpA (ISP)  and  Banca Monte dei Paschi di Siena SpA (BMPS) , are
planning to start distributing dividends again, at the same, or
higher, levels than before the financial crisis, the Financial
Times reported, citing interviews with both banks’ chiefs.  “There are no restrictions,” Corrado Passero, Intesa San
Paolo CEO said, the FT reported. “In such an uncertain world,
making a commitment on dividends is important,” he said.
Payouts are going to be “very high -- above 50 percent,” he
said, according to the FT.  Antonio Vigni, General Manager of Bance Monte dei Paschi di
Siena, said dividend payouts would be “in line” with the 40
percent to 50 percent distribution ratios paid before 2008, the
FT said, citing the interview.  To contact the reporter on this story:
