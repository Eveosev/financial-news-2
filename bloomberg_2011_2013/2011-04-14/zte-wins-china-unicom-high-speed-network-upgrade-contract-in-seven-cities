ZTE Corp. (000063) ,  China ’s second-largest
maker of phone-network equipment, said it won a contract from
China United Network Communications Group Co. to upgrade
networks in seven cities to deliver high-speed mobile access.  Financial terms weren’t disclosed in an e-mailed statement
from Shenzhen-based ZTE today. China United Network
Communications, also known as Unicom, is the second-largest
mobile-phone company in China and the parent of China Unicom
(Hong Kong) Ltd. Margrete Ma, a spokeswoman for ZTE, and Wen
Baoqiu for Unicom both declined to comment on the value of the
award.  China Unicom, which started offering its third-generation
mobile service in October 2009, said last month it would improve
networks in 56 cities this year to raise the speed at which
users can download videos, games or music by 46 percent. The
upgrade is to a technology called evolved high-speed packet
access, or HSPA+.  Data download rates will increase to 21 megabits per second
from 14.4 megabits previously with the upgrade, Unicom said last
month. Unicom’s spending on its 3G network will rise by 24
percent to 19.5 billion yuan ($2.99 billion) this year, the
company said at the time.  ZTE will provide the HSPA+ network upgrade in seven cities,
including Changchun, Ningbo and Wuhan, the company said today,
without disclosing the others.  ZTE’s shares dropped 2.5 percent to close at HK$27.80 in
 Hong Kong . China Unicom gained 0.1 percent to HK$14.78.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
