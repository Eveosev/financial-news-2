Alfa-Access-Renova, the group of
Russian billionaires that owns 50 percent of TNK-BP, rejected BP
Plc’s offer of $27 billion for its stake in TNK-BP because it
retains a long-term commitment to TNK-BP, the Financial Times
said, citing AAR Chief Executive Officer  Stan Polovets .  “AAR wanted the Rosneft deal turned over to TNK-BP, not
some selected parts,” Polovets said, according to the FT. “AAR
is a long-term strategic investor in TNK-BP and has no plans to
exit,” he said, the newspaper reported.  BP and OAO Rosneft decided to end the discussions with AAR
because the group made “unrealistic” demands and placed a
valuation of more than $70 billion on TNK-BP, the FT said,
citing people close to the discussions.  A person close to AAR rebutted that view, the FT said. “It
is up to BP to make a sensible proposal to get out of the mess
it has created,” the person said, according to the FT.  To contact the reporter on this story:
