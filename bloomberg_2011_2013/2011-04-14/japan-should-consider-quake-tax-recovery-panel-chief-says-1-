Japan  should consider a new tax to
help fund its recovery from the March 11 earthquake, tsunami and
ensuing nuclear crisis, the chief of a government advisory panel
on disaster reconstruction said.  “All the people should support and share the burden,”
Makoto Iokibe, the head of the group advising Prime Minister
 Naoto Kan , said in a report today. The statement listed the sale
of bonds and a disaster reconstruction tax as ways the public
could contribute to the rebuilding effort.  The suggestion comes as rival lawmakers debate how to fund
a disaster relief package of 4 trillion yen ($48 billion) in a
country where public debt is twice the size of the economy. Kan
has said the government shouldn’t sell bonds to pay for the
measures.  Iokibe, who is head of Japan’s National Defense Academy,
told reporters after today’s meeting that specific funding means
have yet to be decided. The government has estimated the damage
from last month’s earthquake and tsunami to be as much as 25
trillion yen.  Kan, speaking at the start of the 15-member group’s meeting
today, asked for a “creative” plan by June to rebuild
northeastern Japan.  To contact the reporters on this story:
