Dow Chemical Co. (DOW) , the biggest U.S.
chemical maker, raised its dividend two years after cutting the
payout for the first time in the company’s history.  Dow increased the quarterly dividend 67 percent to 25 cents
a share, from 15 cents, the Midland, Michigan-based company said
today in a statement.  “It says to me the board is more comfortable now with the
balance sheet and with the earnings power of the company,”
 Hassan Ahmed , a New York-based analyst at Alembic Global
Advisors, said in a telephone interview.  Dow’s fourth-quarter net income almost tripled to $511
million as the company’s U.S. plants benefited from the lower
price of natural gas relative to oil. Dow paid down $2.5 billion
of debt in the first quarter as earnings growth provided the
company with cash to improve its balance sheet and increase
shareholder payments.  Chief Executive Officer Andrew Liveris in February 2009 cut
Dow’s dividend by 64 percent to 15 cents, from 42 cents. The
reduction saved $1 billion a year and helped Dow complete its
$15.7 billion purchase of Rohm & Haas Co. during the U.S.
recession.  To contact the reporter on this story:
