William Hill Plc (WMH) , a U.K. bookmaker
with about 2,350 shops, is entering the U.S. market by agreeing
to acquire two  Nevada  land-based sports-betting businesses for a
total consideration of about $39 million.  William Hill will buy American Wagering Inc. and Club Cal
Neva Satellite Race and Sportsbook Division, the London-based
company said in a statement today. Both supply sports-betting
services to casinos and bars in Nevada, where it’s legal.  European gambling companies have been positioning
themselves to gain business in the U.S., which banned online-
gambling financial transactions in 2006. William Hill today
called the acquisitions “only the start of our investments in
the U.S. market.”  “Like us, Americans love the sport,” Chief Executive
Officer Ralph Topping said in a conference call to analysts.
“Like us, Americans love to bet, and we can bring the two
together.”  Legislators have introduced online gambling bills in states
such as  New Jersey , and  Washington , D.C. city council approved a
budget allowing the district’s lottery to operate a poker
website inside city limits.  Besides Nevada, sports betting is only legal in the U.S. in
Montana, Delaware and  Oregon . The Nevada sports-betting market
was worth about $2.7 billion last year, according to William
Hill.  In March, 888 Holdings Plc was approved by the Nevada
Gaming
Commission for a supplier relationship with Caesars Interactive
Entertainment Inc. Playtech Ltd. has an agreement with New
York-based Scientific Games Corp. to develop games together.  To contact the reporter on this story:
