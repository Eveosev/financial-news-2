The following companies may have
unusual price changes in Malaysia trading. Stock symbols are in
parentheses, and share prices are as of the 12:30 p.m. break in
Kuala Lumpur.  The  FTSE Bursa Malaysia KLCI (FBMKLCI)  Index fell 4.86, or 0.3
percent, to 1,530.73.  Alam Maritim Resources Bhd. (AMRB)  , an oil and gas
services provider, gained 2 percent to 1.03 ringgit, set for its
biggest increase since March 30. The company won a contract
worth 24.2 million ringgit ($8 million) to supply two vessels,
according to an exchange filing.        Allianz Malaysia Bhd. (ALLZ)   jumped 6.6 percent to 5.32
ringgit, bound for its steepest gain since Jan. 3. CIMB
Investment Bank Bhd. valued the insurer’s shares at between 8.20
ringgit and 9.80 ringgit to reflect its earnings growth
prospects, according to a report by analyst Winson Ng Gia Yann.       Guocoland (Malaysia) Bhd. (GUOL MK), a property developer,
dropped 2.3 percent to 1.27 ringgit after the company reported a
third-quarter loss of 3.6 million ringgit.  Top Glove Corp. (TOPG MK), the world’s biggest rubber-glove
maker, gained 1.8 percent to 5.05 ringgit, halting a five-day
drop. Rubber declined for a third day amid speculation demand
from tire makers may weaken because of  Japan ’s nuclear crisis
and that supply from  Thailand , the largest producer, may improve
after New Year holidays.  To contact the reporter on this story:
