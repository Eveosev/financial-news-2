Brazil  policy makers raised the
benchmark Selic rate by a quarter point to 12 percent,
surprising the 41 of 58 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg, who
expected them to maintain the 50 basis point pace of the

increase, which was anticipated by traders, according to
interest-rate futures. Two dissenting members of the board
favored raising the Selic to 12.25 percent.  WHAT TO WATCH:
