The dollar fell toward a 15-month
low against the euro on speculation the  Federal Reserve  will lag
behind the  European Central Bank  in raising  interest rates ,
boosting demand for higher-yielding assets.  The U.S. currency slumped versus all but one of its 16
most-traded peers before data today that economists predict will
show first-time jobless claims last week were little changed.
Singapore’s dollar rose to the strongest since at least 1981
after the nation’s central bank said it will allow the currency
to appreciate to combat inflation.  Switzerland ’s franc climbed
to the highest in almost a month, while  New Zealand ’s dollar
reached a five-month high against the greenback.  “The main reason for the dollar weakness at the moment is
the view that the Fed will maintain its accommodative monetary
stance for longer,” said  Ulrich Leuchtmann , head of foreign-
exchange strategy at Commerzbank AG in  Frankfurt . “If we see a
weak number in the initial jobless claims data today, it could
give the Fed more reason to keep rates lower for longer.”  The dollar depreciated 0.3 percent to $1.4482 per euro at
9:27 a.m. in London. It earlier reached $1.4515, near the
$1.4520 reached yesterday, which matched the weakest level since
January 2010. The euro fell 0.3 percent to 120.75 yen. The yen
climbed 0.5 percent to 83.39 per dollar.  Applications for jobless benefits in the U.S. are expected
to slip to 380,000 in the week ended April 9, compared with
382,000 the previous week, according to the median estimate in a
Bloomberg survey.  ECB, Fed Divergence  The U.S. currency has weakened 4.8 percent against a basket
of nine developed nation peers this year, according to Bloomberg
Correlation-Weighted Currency Indexes, the second-worst
performance tracked by the measure after  Japan ’s yen.  The ECB last week raised its main refinancing rate to 1.25
percent from a record low 1 percent, and indicated further
increases may follow. The Fed has kept its key rate near zero
since December 2008.  Fed Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  last week said an acceleration
in inflation will be transitory, should commodity price
increases slow in line with the central bank’s predictions.  “The apparent policy divergence between the ECB and the
Fed is what’s causing the dollar to weaken against the euro,”
said  Gareth Berry , a foreign-exchange strategist at UBS AG in
Singapore. “Markets might have gotten ahead of themselves in
terms of pricing in ECB tightening. Above $1.45 European
exporters start to feel a bit of a squeeze.”  Inflation Pressures  Euro-region inflation accelerated 1.3 percent in March from
the previous month, when it quickened 0.4 percent, according to
economists surveyed by Bloomberg before the European Union’s
statistics report tomorrow.  The U.S. consumer-price index advanced 0.5 percent in
March, matching the previous month’s reading, which was the
biggest gain since June 2009, a survey showed before the Labor
Department data tomorrow.  The Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against six
major U.S. trading partners’ currencies, lost 0.4 percent to
74.657, after touching 74.617, the lowest since December 2009.  The dollar weakened for a fifth day in six against the yen,
dipping below its 200-day moving average to reach 83.28 yen. A
close below that level may signal the U.S. currency will extend
declines toward 82.50 yen, said  Sue Trinh , a senior currency
strategist at Royal Bank of Canada in  Hong Kong .  The Swiss franc advanced for a third day, appreciating as
much as 0.8 percent to 88.97 centimes per dollar, the strongest
since March 17, before trading at 89.26.  ‘Short’ Dollar  Singapore ’s dollar strengthened after its central bank said
it will re-center the currency’s band upwards in its semi-annual
exchange-rate review today. A shift higher in the center of the
trading band “will ensure  price stability  in the medium term
while keeping growth on a sustainable path,” the  Monetary
Authority of Singapore  said in a statement.  The island’s currency advanced 0.8 percent to S$1.2471
against the greenback after reaching S$1.2454, the strongest
since 1981 when Bloomberg began tracking the data.  New Zealand’s dollar reached a five-month high versus the
U.S. currency after its government sold NZ$700 million ($556
million) in bonds. The currency, known by traders as the kiwi,
rose as much as 0.8 percent to 79.57 U.S. cents, the highest
since Nov. 5, before trading at 79.28.  To contact the reporters on this story:
