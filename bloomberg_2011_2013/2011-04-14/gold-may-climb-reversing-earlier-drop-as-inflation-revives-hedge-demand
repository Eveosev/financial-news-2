Gold may gain for a second day in
 New York  as a weakening dollar and concern about inflation boost
demand for the metal as an alternative investment. Silver rose
to within 1.4 percent of a 31-year high.  The dollar today touched a 16-month low against six major
currencies on speculation the  Federal Reserve  will lag behind
the  European Central Bank  in raising  interest rates . Data this
week may show European and Chinese inflation quickened last
month. Concerns about  Japan ’s nuclear disaster, fighting in
Libya and European debt helped gold reach a record $1,478 an
ounce on April 11. Gold typically moves inversely to the dollar.  Concerns about the “Middle East and North Africa, euro-
zone debt and inflation continue to underpin” prices,  James Moore , an analyst at TheBullionDesk.com in London, said today in
a report to clients. “The weaker dollar is set to drive” gold
to $1,500 and silver to $45 an ounce, he said.  Gold futures for June delivery rose $2.40, or 0.2 percent,
to $1,458 an ounce at 7:58 a.m. on the Comex in New York. The
metal for immediate delivery in London was little changed at
$1,457.28. Spot prices reached a record $1,478.18 on April 11.  The U.S. Dollar Index was little changed after earlier
today dropping as much as 0.5 percent.  Silver for May delivery in New York climbed as much as 2.9
percent to $41.40 an ounce and was last at $40.735. It rose to
$41.975 on April 11, the highest level since January 1980, when
futures reached a record $50.35.  Gold’s 2.6 percent gain this year has lagged behind the 32
percent surge for silver, which is used more in industry than
gold. An ounce of gold bought as little as 35.16 ounces of
silver on April 11, the least since 1983, data compiled by
Bloomberg show.  Asian Interest  Euro-region consumer prices rose 1.3 percent in March from
the previous month, when they gained 0.4 percent, economists
surveyed by Bloomberg News expect a report tomorrow to show.
 China ’s inflation accelerated to 5.2 percent last month,
exceeding the government’s 2011 target of 4 percent for the
third month this year, a survey showed. The Bank of  Korea 
yesterday raised the inflation forecast for  South Korea .  “Gold could be supported by some buying interest from
Asian countries,” said Ong Yi Ling, a Singapore-based analyst
with Phillip Futures Pte. “Amid high inflation and a lack of
investment alternatives, gold could be sought out as a store of
value and hedge against inflation.”  Aftershocks rattling Japan after the nation’s record quake
on March 11 may continue for at least six months, increasing the
risk of more damage to the crippled Fukushima Dai-Ichi nuclear
plant, said the University of Tokyo’s Earthquake Research
Institute. Tokyo Electric Power Co. estimates the fight to
stabilize reactors will last through June.  Libya  Conflict  Libyan rebels want to borrow at least $2 billion to buy
food, medicine, fuel and perhaps weapons as their foreign allies
agreed on the need to do more to help them prevail over Muammar Qaddafi’s forces. Libya has been effectively split in two since
the early stages of the two-month conflict, a division that has
helped push  oil prices  above $100 a barrel in New York.  HSBC Global Asset Management increased its gold holdings to
6 percent from 3 percent at the beginning of this quarter. Gold
at $2,600 is a “reasonable fair value target” when measured
against commodities, real estate,  money supply  and wages, HSBC’s
Charles Morris, head of the company’s Absolute Return fund, said
in a report.  Palladium for June delivery was down 0.3 percent at $762.85
an ounce. Platinum for July delivery was little changed at
$1,775 an ounce.  To contact the reporters on this story:
