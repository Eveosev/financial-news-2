Tele Norte Leste Participacoes SA (TNLP4) 
said Chief Executive Officer Luiz Eduardo Falco will leave his
post, a fortnight after  Portugal Telecom SGPS SA (PTC)  bought 25.3
percent of the company for 8.32 billion reais ($5.3 billion).  Falco will leave by the end of the first half of the year
after 10 years at the carrier, the Rio de Janeiro-based company
said in a statement today. The company, known by its Oi brand
name, will use consultants to help select a replacement.  Portugal ’s largest phone company  said  March 28 it acquired
direct and indirect positions in Oi to tap growing demand for
mobile-phone and Internet services in  Brazil . Oi is Brazil’s
largest fixed-line phone company.  Oi’s share of the Brazilian mobile market fell to 19.5
percent in February from 20.6 percent a year earlier, according
to the telecommunications regulator, Anatel. That was the lowest
share among the four largest companies, after  Vivo Participacoes
SA (VIVO4) , America Movil SAB’s Claro and  Tim Participacoes SA. (TCSL4)   Oi’s preferred shares rose 0.6 percent to 29.50 reais in
 Sao Paulo  at the market close today. The stock has risen 21.5
percent this year, compared with a 4.4 percent fall in Brazil’s
benchmark Bovespa index.  To contact the reporters on this story:
