South  Korea ’s won reversed earlier
losses after  Singapore  allowed a faster appreciation of its
currency to combat inflation.  The won also rose for a second day as exporters repatriated
their income to benefit from the currency’s decline yesterday to
a two-week low. The Singapore dollar jumped to the highest since
at least 1981 after its central bank said it will re-center the
currency’s band upwards, while keeping it below the prevailing
level of the nominal effective  exchange rate .  “There was heavy selling of dollars from exporters,” said
Kim Sung Soon, a currency dealer at Industrial Bank of Korea in
Seoul. “All Asian currencies were stronger than in the morning
session as the  Singapore dollar  led the gains.”  The won advanced 0.1 percent to 1,086.85 per dollar at the
3 p.m. close in Seoul, after falling as much as 0.5 percent,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. It touched 1,095.70
yesterday, the weakest level since April 1.  Government bonds declined, with the yield on the 3 percent
note due December 2013 rising two basis points, or 0.02
percentage point, to 3.75 percent, according to prices from
Korea Stock Exchange.  The Bank of Korea should raise its benchmark interest rate
to “at least” 4 percent this year to curb inflation and
household debt, Kim Tae Joon, president of  Korea Institute of
Finance , the country’s largest private financial think tank,
said in an interview yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
