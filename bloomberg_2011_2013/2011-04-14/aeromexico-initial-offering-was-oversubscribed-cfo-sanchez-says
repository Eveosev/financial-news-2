Grupo Aeromexico SAB Chief
Financial Officer Ricardo Sanchez Baker said the company’s
initial share sale generated demand that was twice the offering.  The company plans to use the 3.9 billion pesos ($330
million) it raised as part of its two-year, $1.3 billion plan to
boost its cash position to about 15 percent of revenue and buy
more planes, he said in a telephone interview today from Mexico
City.  “With market conditions, you never know what’s going to
happen tomorrow,” Sanchez Baker said. “We saw a window, and we
wanted to go to the market. We were prepared.”  The company is financing the purchase of  Embraer SA (EMBR3)  jets
through a $315 million credit from  Brazil ’s development bank,
known as BNDES, he said. Aeromexico is seeking additional
financing for the purchase of  Boeing Co. (BA)  jets, he said.  The stock fell 2.3 percent to 30.30 pesos at 12:02 p.m. New
York time in its first trading day in Mexico City, after the
airline sold 125.5 million shares yesterday at 31 pesos each,
the lower end of the forecast range of 30 to 34, according to a
filing to the stock exchange. The total raised includes the so-
called greenshoe option for underwriters to purchase shares.  To contact the reporters on this story:
