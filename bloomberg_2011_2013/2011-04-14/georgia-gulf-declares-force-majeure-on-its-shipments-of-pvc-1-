Georgia Gulf Corp. (GGC) ,  North America ’s
largest maker of vinyl construction products, declared force
majeure on shipments of polyvinyl chloride because of a shortage
of raw materials.  The company said a supplier of ethylene also declared force
majeure, Atlanta-based Georgia Gulf said today in a statement.
Force majeure is a legal clause allowing the suspension of
deliveries because of circumstances beyond the supplier’s
control.  Operating problems at Georgia Gulf’s chlorine plant in
Plaquemine,  Louisiana , will also contribute to the disruption to
PVC output, which will last for “the next few months,” Georgia
Gulf said.  Improving profitability in North America will outweigh the
reduction in output of PVC, used in plastic pipe and vinyl
window frames, Chief Executive Officer Paul Carrico said in the
statement. He said 2011 adjusted earnings before interest, tax,
depreciation and amortization will be at the “top end” of its
previously announced guidance of $245 million to $265 million.
Ebitda will be $278.8 million, according to the average of five
analyst estimates in a Bloomberg survey.  The company is evaluating the time and cost needed to
repair problems at the Plaquemine plant, which have cut
production capacity by about 33 percent, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
