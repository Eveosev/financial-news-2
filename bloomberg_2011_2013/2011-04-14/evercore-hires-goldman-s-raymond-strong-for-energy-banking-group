Evercore Partners Inc. (EVR) , the
investment bank founded by former U.S. Treasury Department
Deputy Secretary  Roger Altman , hired Raymond B. Strong III from
 Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)  to build out its energy investment-
banking group.  Strong, 41, was most recently a managing director in
Goldman Sachs’s global natural resources group where he advised
Chevron Corp. on its $4.9 billion acquisition of Atlas Energy
Inc., New York-based Evercore said today in a statement. Strong
will focus on the oil sector as a senior managing director,
according to the statement.  Evercore added six senior managing directors in 2010,
bringing the total to 54, and expanded its headcount by 38
percent to 610 employees, according to a regulatory filing. The
firm advised AT&T Inc. on its $39 billion acquisition of
T-Mobile USA Inc., the largest deal this year, and Lubrizol
Corp. on its sale to Berkshire Hathaway Inc. for about
$9 billion.  “Evercore has a lot of momentum, and Ray adds to it,’’
Altman said in the statement. “We are committed to building a
market-leading energy banking practice.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
