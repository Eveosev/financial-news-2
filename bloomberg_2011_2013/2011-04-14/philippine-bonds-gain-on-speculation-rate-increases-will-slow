Philippine five-year bonds rose for
a third day on speculation the central bank will delay raising
borrowing costs on signs the global recovery is faltering.  The yield on the notes fell to a one-week low after the
Japanese government cut its economic assessment yesterday for
the first time in six months to take into account damage from
the March 11 earthquake. Ford Motor Co. said yesterday it is
shutting its Philippine factory for 18 days as a precautionary
move to ensure parts availability following the record temblor
in  Japan .  “The disruptions to the supply chain are affecting growth
in the Asia Pacific,” said Marcelo Ayes, senior vice president
at Rizal Commercial Banking Corp. in  Manila . “We might see
another low interest-rate scenario and that will drive the rally
in bonds.”  The yield on the 7 percent note due January 2016 slid 22.5
basis points, or 0.225 percentage point, to 5.175 percent as of
3:54 p.m. in Manila, the lowest level since April 6, according
to Tradition Financial Services.  The  Philippines  raised its benchmark interest rate by 25
basis points to 4.25 percent last month, the first increase
since August 2008.  The peso traded at 43.222 per dollar, little changed from
43.233 yesterday, according to prices from inter-dealer broker
Tullett Prebon Plc. The currency has advanced 1.3 percent this
year.  To contact the reporter for this story:
