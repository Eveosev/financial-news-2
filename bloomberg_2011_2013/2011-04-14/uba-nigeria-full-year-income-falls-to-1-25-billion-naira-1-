United Bank for Africa Plc (UBA) , a
Nigerian lender, said profit for the year through December fell
as revenue declined.  Net income decreased to 1.25 billion naira ($8.1 million)
from 2.38 billion naira in the 15 months through December 2009,
the company said in a statement published on the Lagos-based
Nigerian Stock Exchange’s website today. Revenue retreated to
185.2 billion naira from 244.1 billion naira. The bank will pay
a dividend of 5 kobo per share and give a bonus of 1 share for
every four shares already held, the statement said.  UBA plans to grow its loan books by “between 15 -20
percent” this year after achieving a loan growth of 28 percent
last year, Chief Executive Officer Phillips Oduoza told
reporters in Lagos today. “We will not like to be very bullish.
“If we grow beyond this at the level of capital we have, it
will strain us.”  A debt crisis arising from loans to speculators on the
local stock market and operators in the oil and gas industry
threatened the banking sector until the  Central Bank of Nigeria 
bailed out the industry with 620 billion naira in 2009 and fired
the chief executives of eight of the lenders. UBA was not one of
the beneficiaries of the bailout.  UBA’s charge for extraordinary items surged 80 percent to
12.7 billion naira and includes write-offs for loans that the
bank sold to the Asset Management Corp. of  Nigeria , a state
company set up to buy debt from lenders, Emmanuel Nnorom,
executive director for finance and risk, told reporters in
Lagos.  The bank’s shares fell for the first time in a week, losing
1.1 percent to close at 8 naira by 2:30 p.m. in Lagos. The stock
has declined 13 percent this year, compared with a 1.4 percent
increase in the  Nigerian Stock Exchange  All Share Index over the
same period.  To contact the reporter on this story:
