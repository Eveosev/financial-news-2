Uganda ’s main opposition leader,
 Kizza Besigye , was shot in the arm by a soldier while leading a
march to protest against surging fuel prices, an official from
his party said.  Besigye, leader of the Forum for Democratic Change, was
eight miles north of the capital, Kampala, when the incident
occurred, Judith Kabanda, a regional chairwoman of the party,
said in a phone interview today.  “Soldiers approached us from the opposite direction and
started shooting randomly,” Kabanda said. Besigye was taken by
ambulance for medical attention, she said.  Besigye, 54, was defeated by President Yoweri Museveni in a
Feb. 18 election that was rejected by four opposition candidates
because of voting irregularities. Police arrested Besigye on
April 11 for obstructing traffic during a similar protest march
against gasoline costs, which increased 19 percent in the past
month.  Police spokeswoman Judith Nabakooba said in an e-mailed
statement today that officers had tried to disperse Besigye’s
supporters, who had become “rowdy and started throwing stones”
at the police. Unconfirmed reports say that a scuffle occurred
in which Besigye was injured, though police are still
investigating, she said.  Earlier, police had used teargas against supporters
protecting Besigye from being arrested and at a nearby health
center, where some supporters had taken cover, Wavah
Broadcasting Service reported.  Besigye won 26 percent of the vote in the election, while
Museveni, who has been in power since 1986, was re-elected with
68.4 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
