Egypt ’s Sugar and Integrated
Industries Co. bought 50,000 metric tons of raw sugar from the
150,000 tons for which it tendered, said Ramadan Suleiman, the
company’s purchasing manager.  The Cairo-based company purchased the sugar for July
arrival at $628 a ton from Eridania, with the cost of insurance
and freight included, Suleiman said by phone today from the
Egyptian capital.  Prices at which supplies were offered were “high,” and
the company may tender again next month, Hussein Ahmed, another
purchasing official at the company, said in an interview.  To contact the reporters on this story:
