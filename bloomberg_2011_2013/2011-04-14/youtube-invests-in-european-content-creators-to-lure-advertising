YouTube  is offering as much as
500,000 euros ($720,000) plus training to help Europeans develop
higher quality content for the video-sharing site and lure
advertisers.  Up to 25 individuals across  Europe  will win 20,000 euros
and training under the company’s NextUp program. They will
produce videos that may earn revenue for both themselves and the
 Google Inc (GOOG) .-owned site.  YouTube aims to attract better quality content that appeals
to high-paying advertisers. Today it hosted an event in  London 
in which U.K.-based creators, who collectively have had millions
watch their clips, addressed an audience of young people and
discussed production, viewers and earning money from the site.
The panel included the creator of a YouTube channel that
showcases human beatbox performances, cartoon animators and the
creator of a series of “how-to” videos on makeup.  “We want to encourage people to participate and become
business partners of ours if you like, to submit their
content,” said Patrick Walker, YouTube’s senior director of
content partnerships for Europe,  Africa  and the Middle East.  Some 35 hours of video are uploaded to YouTube every
minute, Walker said. There are 2 billion views a day on the site
and 3 billion items are ad-supported.  During an earlier presentation, Walker highlighted the rush
by  record companies  and TV presenters such as Ellen Degeneres
and  Oprah Winfrey  to nab YouTube sensations for their shows.  “It’s become a land grab out there with the rush to sign
people -- it’s just crazy,” Walker said. He pointed to media
producer Simon Cowell’s recent signing of 10-year-old Heather
Russell after a YouTube clip of her singing became popular.  In the U.K., views have increased by 20 percent from last
year and the number of people earning more than $10,000 from a
YouTube clip rose sevenfold from 2009 to 2010, Walker said.  YouTube also has deals in Britain for full-length ad-
supported television content from Channel 4, Channel 5 and the
 BBC , and works with several production companies, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
