Alexander Semin scored with 96
seconds left in overtime to give the  Washington  Capitals a 2-1
win against the New York Rangers in the National Hockey League
Eastern Conference quarterfinals.  The victory gives the top-seeded Capitals a one-game lead
in the best-of-seven series that will continue April 15 at
Verizon Center in Washington.  After two scoreless periods, Matt Gilroy got a goal less
than two minutes into the third period to give the Rangers a 1-0
lead. Twelve minutes later,  Alex Ovechkin  tied the game at 1-1.  The Rangers secured the eighth and final playoff spot in
the Eastern Conference with a win, combined with a Carolina
Hurricanes loss, last weekend.  To contact the reporter on this story:
