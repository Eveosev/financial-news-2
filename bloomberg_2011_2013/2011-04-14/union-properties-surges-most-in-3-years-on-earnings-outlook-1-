Union Properties PJSC (UPP) , the Dubai
real-estate developer in which  Emirates NBD PJSC (EMIRATES)  holds a 48
percent stake, soared the most in three years on bets first-
quarter earnings will rise.  The shares climbed 15 percent, the maximum fluctuation
allowed and the most since January 2008, to 37.8 fils at the 2
p.m. close in Dubai. The shares have jumped 31 percent since
March 29, when the company published its consolidated financial
statement on the Dubai bourse.  “The earnings expectations for the first quarter are
strong, there have been ongoing deliveries” of properties, said
Jad Abbas, a Dubai-based real-estate analyst at EFG-Hermes
Holding SAE. Retail investors were drawn to the shares after the
financial statement showed Union Properties obtained financial
support from creditors, he said.  “During the current year, the group has entered into an
agreement with a significant shareholder, a bank, to obtain a
long-term loan of 891 million dirhams ($243 million) which would
be utilized to repay certain bank borrowings of the group,”
Union Properties said in the statement last month.  First-quarter net income at Union Properties may surge
almost seven-fold to 335 million dirhams when earnings are
announced in the first week of May, according to Abbas’s
estimate on Bloomberg. He has a “neutral” recommendation on
the stock.  To contact the reporter on this story:
