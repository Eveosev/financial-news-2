Dexia SA (DEXB)  and  KBC Groep NV (KBC)  are
together healthier than most European banks, De Tijd reported,
citing a comparison of 16 groups of banks by the International
Monetary Fund.  The group including KBC and Dexia scored “well” on three
of five sets of criteria ranking the vulnerability of banks as
strong, middle or weak, according to the newspaper. Loan losses
are low, interest rates on bank bonds are low, and the average
core capital is high, according to the newspaper.   For losses on government bonds, Dexia and KBC were in the
middle, and the weakest point for the Belgian banks was the low
income in relation to the balance sheet, the newspaper said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
