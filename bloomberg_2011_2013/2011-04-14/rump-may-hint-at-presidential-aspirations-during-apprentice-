The season finale of “Celebrity
Apprentice” may also include a hint of real estate developer
and program host  Donald Trump ’s next pursuit, his office
announced today.  Trump may reveal the time and place of his announcement on
whether he will seek the Republican nomination for president
during the May 22 broadcast, according to an email from  Michael
Cohen , executive vice president and special counsel to Trump.
 Celebrity Apprentice  airs on the NBC television network. NBC
Universal is 51 percent owned by Philadelphia-based  Comcast
Corp. (CMCSA)   Trump, 64, is scheduled to speak in June at a Republican
fundraising event in Iowa, site of the first 2012 presidential
nominating caucuses. He was viewed favorably by 37 percent and
unfavorably by 43 percent of respondents in a March 4-7
Bloomberg poll.  Four other Republicans -- former Governors  Mitt Romney  of
Massachusetts and Tim Pawlenty of Minnesota, former House
Speaker Newt Gingrich of Georgia and former Senator Rick Santorum of Pennsylvania -- are exploring White House runs.  Trump has questioned whether Barack Obama was born in the
United States and therefore is eligible to be president. Obama
was born in Honolulu, Hawaii, the state has confirmed.  The University of Pennsylvania Annenberg Public Policy
Center has said such claims were the  “goofiest”  of “all the
nutty rumors, baseless conspiracy theories and sheer
disinformation” about the 2008 election.  To contact the reporter on this story:
