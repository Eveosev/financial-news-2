Belgian investigators have
uncovered an international tax fraud network in emissions
permits trading across  Europe  that has cost companies 600
million euros ($870 million),  De Tijd  reported, without saying
where it got the information.  The fraudsters in 2009 cheated companies in  Belgium ,
 Germany ,  Denmark , the U.K. and  Spain , the newspaper said. The
investigators discovered the network after BNP Paribas Fortis in
Belgium lost more than 72 million euros to the fraudsters from
buying emission permits, according to the newspaper.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
