Croatia ’s government said Iva Galic
would replace Vedran Duvnjak as the head of country’s  Agency for
Management of State Property .  Galic, a lawyer, helped break an impasse with a private
investor on  Suncani Hvar d.d ., an Adriatic resort owned by the
government and  Orco Property Group (ORC)  SA. The two partners reached
an agreement in March to capitalize loans and ease the resort’s
burden after talks over the resort’s future stalled for almost a
year.  “Galic, along with Cobankovic, is credited for moving the
Orco issue out of the stalemate,” Mihaela Felker, the agency’s
spokeswoman, said by phone in explaining the change.  To contact the reporter on this story: Jasmina Kuzmanovic at
