Citigroup Inc. (C) , the third-biggest
U.S. bank, may raise as much as $273 million selling a stake in
insurer  Primerica Inc. (PRI)   Citigroup is offering 12 million shares at $22.75 apiece,
Primerica said today in a statement distributed by Business
Wire. Underwriters have the option of purchasing an additional
1.8 million Primerica shares from the New York-based bank.  The bank will still hold a stake of 20.7 percent to 23.1
percent after the sale, Primerica said. Citigroup was the
largest shareholder as of December, with a 40 percent stake,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Citigroup Chief Executive Officer  Vikram Pandit , 54, is
selling assets and streamlining the bank after repaying a $45
billion U.S. government bailout. Primerica was part of Citi
Holdings, the portfolio of businesses Pandit said he would sell,
wind down or restructure.  Primerica, based in Duluth,  Georgia , sells term life
insurance and mutual funds. It sold 21.36 million shares at $15
each as part of its initial public offering in March 2010.
Primerica rose 1 cent to $23.42 today in New York Stock Exchange
trading, and has declined 3.4 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
