Rio Tinto Plc (RIO) , which will donate
the metal to make all the 4,700 gold, silver and bronze medals
for the 2012 London  Olympic Games , will be spending more on the
gift than it has on previous occasions, the last of which was in
2002, the FT reported.  While it’s not known exactly how much metal will be needed
for the 2012 medals, for the 2008 Games  BHP Billiton Ltd. (BHP) 
provided 460 ounces of gold and 6.9 tonnes of copper at a cost,
in January 2008, of $431,000, the FT reported. At today’s
prices, the same quantity would cost $737,000, the FT said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
