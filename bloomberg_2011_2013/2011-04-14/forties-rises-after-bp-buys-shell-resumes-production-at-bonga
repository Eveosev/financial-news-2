North Sea Forties crude rose after
BP Plc bought a shipment at a higher price. Royal Dutch Shell
Plc resumed production at the Bonga field in  Nigeria  after six
weeks of planned maintenance.  North Sea  BP bought 600,000 barrels of Forties for loading April 26
to April 28 from Shell at a premium of 65 cents a barrel to
Dated Brent, according to a survey of traders and brokers
monitoring the daily Platts trading window.  Statoil ASA bought a shipment for May 4 to May 6 from Vitol
Group at 50 cents above Dated Brent, the survey showed. Forties
was last sold at 60 cents more than the benchmark on April 12.  Vitol failed to sell another cargo for April 27 to April 29
at 80 cents above Dated Brent, and Hess Energy Trading Co., also
known as Hetco, was unable to buy a shipment for May 4 to May 7
at a premium of 35 cents to Dated Brent, the survey showed.  Reported  North Sea  market activity typically occurs during
the Platts window, which ends at 4:30 p.m. in London. Prior to
the window, Forties loading 10 to 21 days in the future cost 66
cents more than Dated Brent today, up from a premium of 63 cents
yesterday, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Brent for May settlement traded at $122.45 a barrel on the
London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange at the close of the
window, up from $122.40 yesterday. The June contract was at
$122.00, 45 cents below May.  BP failed to buy 100,000 metric tons of Russian Urals for
May 2 to May 6 delivery to Rotterdam at $4.20 a barrel less than
Dated Brent, according to the survey. Yesterday, Glencore
International AG bought one cargo at $4.10 below the benchmark.  Urals was assessed at $4.05 a barrel below Dated Brent in
northwest  Europe  today, compared with a discount of $4.30
yesterday, Bloomberg data showed.  Mediterranean  Vitol failed to buy 80,000 tons of Urals for the second day
even after it raised its bid by 20 cents to a discount of $3.45
a barrel to Dated Brent for May 2 to May 6, according to the
survey.  West Africa  Benchmark Nigerian Qua Iboe was assessed at $3.38 a barrel
above Dated Brent, down from yesterday’s $3.58 premium,
Bloomberg data showed.  Shell’s Nigerian unit said oil production resumed at its
offshore Bonga field, which pumps about 10 percent of the
country’s crude, after the completion of maintenance.  “The maintenance works, which commenced on February 28
this year, were executed safely and within schedule,” Shell
said in an e-mailed statement today. “Production will be
gradually ramped up over the coming weeks.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
