Bank of England Markets Director
 Paul Fisher  said U.K. lenders should be able to boost liquidity
using mortgage assets as the central bank winds down its Special
Liquidity Scheme.  “Much of the collateral posted under SLS was residential
mortgage-backed securities and residential mortgage-backed
covered bonds, where conditions in the secondary and repo
markets have improved since the financial market seizure
beginning in 2007,” Fisher said in a paper published by the
bank in London today. “It is expected that the banks will be
able to generate liquidity using their mortgage assets in the
private market or by raising funding through other markets.”  The SLS was introduced at the peak of the credit crisis to
improve liquidity by allowing banks to swap hard-to-trade
mortgage-backed securities for  government bonds . It is due to
expire in January 2012 and won’t be extended or replaced. Fisher
said banks have made “good, early progress” in reducing their
use of the program.  Since the end of November, U.K. lenders repaid 19 billion
pounds ($31 billion) borrowed through the central bank’s 185
billion-pound SLS, bringing the total repaid to 94 billion
pounds, the bank said in its Quarterly Bulletin last month.  Fisher also said a move by pension funds to swap some
highly liquid assets for less liquid RMBS may aid banks, as it
gives the bank collateral it can use to raise cash in the repo
market.  To contact the reporter on this story:
