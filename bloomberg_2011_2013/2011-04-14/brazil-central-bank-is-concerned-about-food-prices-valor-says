Brazil ’s central bank is creating a
group to monitor food prices because there’s demand-driven
pressure on inflation, Valor Economico newspaper reported,
without saying how it obtained the information.  The central bank took the initiative, which involves talks
with officials from Agriculture, Finance and Agrarian
Development ministries, after agriculture commodities prices
rose in February, surprising the monetary authority, the Sao
Paulo-based newspaper said.  The government is considering cutting duties on corn and
wheat, Valor said, and boost lending to farmers to increase
supply.  The central bank declined to comment, according to a
spokeswoman who declined to be named citing the bank’s policy.  To contact the reporter on this story:
