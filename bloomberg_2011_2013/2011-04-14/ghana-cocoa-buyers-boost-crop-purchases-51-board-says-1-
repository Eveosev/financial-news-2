Cocoa purchases in  Ghana , the
world’s second-largest producer of the beans, jumped 51 percent
in the first 26 weeks of the main harvest season, Yaw Adu-
Ampomah, deputy chief executive of  Ghana  Cocoa Board, said.  Companies licensed by the board to purchase the chocolate
ingredient from farmers bought 754,000 metric tons in the period
ending March 31, compared with 500,000 tons in the same period a
year earlier, he said by phone from Accra, the capital, today.  Purchases during the week climbed to 10,000 tons from 9,000
tons in the 26th week of the 2009-10 season, he said. Ghana
borders  Ivory Coast , the world’s biggest producer of cocoa.  “We project to buy 50,000 tons in the 7 weeks that are
left of the main crop season,” Adu-Ampomah said. “The minor
crop season, starting somewhere June and closing September,
should also produce between 50,000 and 70,000 tons.”  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
