Nigeria ’s oil exports rose 46
percent to 9.15 trillion naira ($59 billion) last year as prices
increased and companies raised output on improved security in
the Niger River delta, the National Bureau of Statistics said.  Nigeria , Africa’s top oil producer, earned $196 billion
from oil and gas exports in the four years through 2010, the
statistics office said today in a statement. The West African
nation depends on oil exports for more than 80 percent of
government revenue and 95 percent of foreign-exchange income.  Energy companies in Nigeria stepped up oil output in 2010
as militant attacks on installations declined after a government
amnesty to fighters in late 2009, according to the  Department of
Petroleum Resources , the country’s oil-industry regulator. The
average price of oil rose 28 percent in the year.  Nigeria is the fifth-biggest source of U.S. oil imports.
The country’s crude is pumped by  Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA) , Exxon
Mobil Corp.,  Chevron Corp. (CVX) ,  Total SA (FP)  and  Eni SpA (ENI)  in joint
ventures with the state-owned Nigerian National Petroleum Corp.  Attacks by armed groups in the Niger delta region, home to
Nigeria’s oil and gas industry, cut more than 28 percent of the
country’s oil output between 2006 and 2009, according to
Bloomberg data.  The West African nation currently pumps about 2.1 million
barrels of oil a day, according to the state oil company.  The value of non-oil exports rose to 3.86 trillion naira
last year from 2.71 trillion naira in the previous year, the
statistics bureau said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
