Kuwait , OPECâ€™s fifth-biggest oil
producer, resumed crude exports this morning after the weather
improved, Mohammed al-Ajmi, spokesman for state-refiner Kuwait
National Petroleum Co., said today.  Kuwait yesterday suspended oil exports, closed port

blanketed the country for the third time in as many weeks.  To contact the reporter on this story:
