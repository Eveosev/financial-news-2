Mubadala Development Co., an  Abu
Dhabi  government-owned investor with stakes in  Carlyle Group  and
 General Electric Co. (GE) , paid a premium over its existing debt to
raise $1.5 billion in bonds.  Mubadala priced $750 million of 3.75 percent notes due
April 2016 to yield about 3.98 percent, or 180 basis points more
than similar-maturity Treasuries yesterday, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. That is 114 basis points, or 1.14
percentage points, more than the existing 5.75 percent five-year
dollar-denonimated bonds, which yielded 2.84 percent today.  “I think Mubadala got a fair deal,” said Abdul Kadir Hussain, who helps oversee $2 billion in fixed-income assets as
chief executive officer at Mashreq Capital in Dubai. “They paid
a premium to their existing bonds, but this is normal for a new
issue, otherwise you risk the bond underperforming.”  Progress on debt restructurings in the  United Arab Emirates 
and optimism the country will be spared unrest that toppled
presidents in Egypt and  Tunisia  have boosted investor
confidence. Average yields on debt from the six-member Gulf
Cooperation Council fell 68 basis points to 5.3 percent from
this year’s high of 5.98 percent on March 18, the HSBC/NASDAQ
Dubai GCC Conventional U.S. Dollar Bond Index shows.  Sales of bonds from the GCC almost doubled to $7.3 billion
this year, compared with $3.7 billion in the same period in
2010, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Issuance fell 23
percent to $32.2 billion in 2010 and reached a record $41.9
billion the previous year.  Boosting Spending  Mubadala also sold $750 million of 10-year bonds maturing
April 2021 at a yield of 5.56 percent, or 210 basis points over
Treasuries, Bloomberg data shows. The securities were issued by
MDC-GMTN B.V. and guaranteed by Mubadala. The yield on the
company’s existing 7.625 percent securities due May 2019 dropped
2 basis points to 4.98 percent today.  The  investment company  sold $1.75 billion of 5-and 10-year
notes in April 2009. The sale was split between $1.25 billion of
5-year, 5.75 percent notes that priced to yield 395 basis points
more than similar-maturity Treasuries, and $500 million of 10-
year, 7.625 percent debt at a spread of 462.5 basis points,
Bloomberg data show.  Abu Dhabi’s debt is rated Aa2 by Moody’s Investors Service
and AA by  Standard & Poor’s , the third-highest investment grade
ranking. The yield on Abu Dhabi government’s 5.5 percent bond
maturing in April 2014 gained 1 basis point to 2.31 percent.  Mubadala plans to increase spending to about 60 billion
dirhams ($16.3 billion) this year as it directs funds to
companies such as Advanced Technology Investment Co., Mubadala
 GE Capital  and its Masdar project, according to the bond
prospectus obtained by Bloomberg News. The group spent an
average 16.4 billion dirhams over the last three years.  Diversifying Economy  Abu Dhabi, home to more than 7 percent of the world’s
proven crude reserves, is seeking to diversify from oil by
investing in industries including real estate and aerospace.
Capital contributions of as much as 37.8 billion dirhams have
been approved by the government for 2011, Mubadala said in the
prospectus.  The company posted a comprehensive loss of 315 million
dirhams for 2010, because of declines in “mark-to-market”
investments. Mubadala said March 10 that it’s in talks with
state-owned Dubai Aluminium Co. to expand their partnership.
Gulf News reported that day, citing Sheikh Hamdan Bin Rashid Al Maktoum, Dubai’s deputy ruler, that Mubadala has offered to buy
a stake in Dubai Aluminium to create a new holding company.  To contact the reporters on this story:
