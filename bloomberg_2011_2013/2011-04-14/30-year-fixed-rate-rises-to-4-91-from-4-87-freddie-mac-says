Mortgage rates in the U.S. climbed
for a fourth week, pushing borrowing costs to the highest since
February as demand for home loans slumps.  The average rate for a 30-year fixed loan rose to 4.91
percent in the week ended today from 4.87 percent, according to
Freddie Mac. The 15-year rate averaged 4.13 percent, up from
4.10 percent a week ago, the McLean, Virginia-based mortgage-
 finance company  said in a statement.  Rising borrowing costs are limiting demand for new loans
and refinancing. Mortgage applications fell 6.7 percent in the
week ended April 8 to the lowest level in two months, according
to the  Mortgage Bankers Association . The Washington-based
groupâ€™s measure of refinancing declined 7.7 percent, while its
index of purchases dropped 4.7 percent.  Home sales remain sluggish since a federal government tax
credit for buyers ended a year ago. The pipeline of
foreclosures, clogged by delays in processing delinquencies, is
preventing prices from reaching a bottom. Foreclosure filings in
the first quarter fell 27 percent from a year earlier as lenders
worked through a backlog of flawed paperwork related to home
seizures, according to a report today from RealtyTrac Inc., an
Irvine, California-based data company.  Sales of existing homes declined 9.6 percent in February,
and distressed properties accounted for 39 percent of deals, the
National Association of Realtors said last month.  The average rate for a 30-year fixed loan began climbing
from a record low of 4.17 percent in November and reached a 10-
month high of 5.05 percent in February. It is below where it was
last year at this time, when it averaged 5.07 percent, according
to  Freddie Mac .  To contact the reporter on this story:
