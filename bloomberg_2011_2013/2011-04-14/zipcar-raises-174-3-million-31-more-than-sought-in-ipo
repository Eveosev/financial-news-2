Zipcar Inc., the car-sharing
company that rents vehicles by the hour, surged 56 percent on
its first day of trading after an expanded initial public
offering.  The company, based in Cambridge, Massachusetts, raised
$174.3 million in its IPO yesterday, after increasing the shares
and pricing them above the range. The shares advanced $10 to $28
as of 4 p.m. in Nasdaq Stock Market composite trading, after
climbing as much as 75 percent to $31.50.  Zipcar and Arcos Dorados Holdings Inc., the Buenos Aires-
based operator of  McDonald’s Corp. (MCD)  restaurants in Latin America
and the Caribbean, expanded their IPOs yesterday to meet demand.
Seven companies were slated to raise at least $1.89 billion in
U.S. initial offerings this week, the busiest for new-stock
sales in the country in more than two months.  “You don’t get that kind of first-day gain unless people
are betting on the growth,” said  Michael Holland , who oversees
more than $4 billion as chairman of Holland & Co. in  New York .
“Anyone who is paying up for it has to be saying that they
believe the concept is movable and can be duplicated in markets
well beyond the small imprint they have so far.”  14 Metro Markets  The car-rental service operates in 14 metropolitan areas,
including  London , and has more than 8,000 cars. It plans to
expand in the U.S. and international markets including Europe,
according to the filing. The company’s net loss in 2010 widened
to $14.1 million from $4.67 million a year earlier, the filing
showed, while revenue increased 42 percent to $186.1 million in
the same period.  Today’s trading gives Zipcar a market value of as much as
$1.21 billion, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. That’s
6.5 times last year’s sales, more than seven times higher than
the multiple of about 0.9 for Park Ridge, New Jersey-based Hertz
Global Holdings Inc., which has car-sharing services in the U.S.
and Europe and is named as a competitor in Zipcar’s filing.  Zipcar sold 9.7 million shares at $18 each, according to a
company statement. It had offered 8.3 million shares at $14 to
$16 apiece, according to a filing with the U.S. Securities and
Exchange Commission. Proceeds will be used to reduce debt and
expand internationally, the filing showed.  The offering was led by New York-based  Goldman Sachs Group
Inc. (GS)  and  JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM)  Zipcar’s owners include venture
capital firms Greylock Partners, Benchmark Capital, Smedvig
Capital Ltd. and Revolution LLC, the fund started by America
Online Inc. co-founder Steve Case, according to the prospectus.  Arcos Pricing  Arcos Dorados raised $1.25 billion, 33 percent more than it
sought, selling 73.5 million shares at $17 each after offering
62.5 million for $13 to $15 apiece, according to a company
statement and a share-sale filing. The deal received more than
10 times more orders than the amount of stock being offered, a
person with knowledge of the situation said.  Arcos, which operates 1,755 McDonald’s locations, will use
$150 million of the share sale’s proceeds to open new outlets
and remodel existing ones, according to its prospectus.  The sale was led by  Bank of America Corp. (BAC) , based in
Charlotte,  North Carolina ; JPMorgan,  Morgan Stanley (MS)  and
 Citigroup Inc. (C)  of New York; and Sao Paulo-based  Itau Unibanco
Holding SA. (ITUB4)   Reduced Terms  Box Ships Inc., the Athens-based company that plans to buy
container ships, reduced its U.S. IPO by 22 percent, selling 11
million shares for $12 apiece after offering 10 million shares
for as much as $17 each, according to its SEC filing and data
compiled by Bloomberg.  UBS AG (UBSN)  of Zurich and Morgan Stanley led the offering.  TMS International Corp., the provider of outsourcing
services to steelmakers, raised $145.6 million in its offering.
The Glassport, Pennsylvania-based company received 31 percent
less than it sought, data compiled by Bloomberg show, pricing
11.2 million shares at $13 each after marketing 12.5 million for
$15 to $17.  Bank of America, Zurich-based  Credit Suisse Group AG (CSGN)  and
JPMorgan led the offering by TMS International.  To contact the reporter on this story:
