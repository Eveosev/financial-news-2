Alfa SAB, the world’s largest
producer of aluminum engine heads, said first-quarter profit
more than doubled because of higher sales from U.S. acquisitions
of chemical plants and a food company.  Net income was 2.45 billion pesos ($209 million) compared
with 1.12 billion pesos a year earlier, Alfa said today in a
statement. Sales rose 31 percent to 42.2 billion pesos, said the
company, which is based in the Monterrey,  Mexico , suburb of San
Pedro Garza Garcia.  Results included two months of operations from three South
Carolina plastic resin plants that Alfa purchased from  Eastman
Chemical Co. (EMN)  for $600 million. Alfa in September bought Bar-S
Foods Co., a Phoenix-based maker of processed meats.  Luis Vallarino, a Citigroup Inc. analyst based in Mexico,
had estimated Alfa’s first-quarter profit at 1.14 billion pesos,
in an April 8 report. Vallarino projected sales of 36.6 billion
pesos.  “The businesses continue benefiting from the recovery of
the U.S. auto industry and the acquisitions in the food and
petrochemical sectors,” Vallarino said.  Alfa rose 51 centavos to 166.64 pesos in Mexico City
trading at 12:40 p.m. New York time. Before today, the shares
had gained 34 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
