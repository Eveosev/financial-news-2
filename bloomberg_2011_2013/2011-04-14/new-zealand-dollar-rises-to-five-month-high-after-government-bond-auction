The  New Zealand  dollar climbed to a
five-month high against the greenback after demand rose at a
NZ$700 million ($556 million) auction of  government bonds .  Australia ’s dollar erased its earlier loss as Asian stocks
advanced, boosting demand for higher-yielding assets. The two
South Pacific nations’ currencies were supported as Singapore
said its economy expanded in the first quarter more than twice
the pace economists forecast.  “The New Zealand dollar remains an outperformer for now,
with a well-bid bond tender,” said  Sue Trinh , senior currency
strategist in  Hong Kong  at Royal Bank of Canada, the North
American nation’s largest lender by assets,.  New Zealand’s currency climbed 0.4 percent to 79.28 U.S.
cents at 2:07 p.m. in  New York , from 78.94 cents yesterday. It
touched 79.57 cents, the highest level since Nov. 5. The kiwi
was little changed at 66.11 yen. The Australian dollar advanced
0.3 percent to $1.0536. The Aussie slid 0.3 percent to 87.86 yen
after earlier falling 1.3 percent.  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index of shares advanced for a second
day, gaining 0.3 percent. The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index
decreased 0.2 percent.  New Zealand sold NZ$100 million of 6.5 percent bonds due in
April 2013, NZ$100 million of 6 percent bonds maturing in
December 2017 and NZ$500 million of 5 percent notes due in March
2019. The auction of 2019 notes drew bids for 3.83 times the
amount on offer, up from a bid-to-cover ratio of 2.13 times at
the April 7 sale, according to the Debt Management Office.  Singapore  GDP  Singapore’s gross domestic product rose at an annual rate
of 23.5 percent in the first quarter from the previous three
months, when it expanded 3.9 percent, the trade ministry said.  “Revived notions that Asia’s economies are recovering
strongly appear to be boosting risk-taking appetite,” said Lee Wai Tuck, a strategist at Forecast Pte Ltd. in Singapore. “This
may be leading to buying of commodity currencies.”  Benchmark interest rates are 2.5 percent in New Zealand and
4.75 percent in Australia, compared with as low as zero in the
U.S. and  Japan , attracting investors to the South Pacific
nations’ higher-yielding assets.  Singapore’s dollar rallied to a record high after the
central bank said it will reorient the currency’s band upward.
The city state’s currency advanced 0.8 percent to S$1.2469
against the greenback after reaching S$1.2454, the strongest
level since 1981, when Bloomberg began tracking the data.  To contact the reporter on this story:
