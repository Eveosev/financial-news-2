Ghana ’s cedi will be little changed
over the next week as demand for dollars by importers remains
low and local companies use cash to pay their first-quarter
taxes, Jacob Brobbey, a currency trader with  Barclays Bank of
Ghana Ltd ., said by phone today.  The currency of the world’s second-biggest cocoa producer
gained 0.2 percent to 1.5120 per dollar as of 3:32 p.m. in
Accra, from yesterday’s close of 1.5145, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  The cedi traded between 1.5110 and 1.5195 since April 4. It
depreciated to a record low against the dollar of 1.5725 on Feb.
