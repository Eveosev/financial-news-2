SK Telecom Co.,  South Korea ’s
largest mobile-phone operator, said it will start a service that
offers discounts for goods, seeking to capitalize on the surging
online-deal market led by Groupon Inc.  SK will start offering discounts tomorrow to its mobile-
phone members for products ranging from Domino’s Pizza Inc.
pizzas to hotel vouchers, the Seoul-based company said in a
statement today. The service will be available for SK’s
subscribers on its website and smartphone application.  SK joins Chicago-based Groupon, owner of the biggest coupon
website, and local ventures such as  TicketMonster Inc.  in
seeking a share of the daily-deal industry in  Asia ’s fourth-
largest economy. Such services, which often target local
businesses, will generate $3.93 billion by 2015, up from $873
million last year, according to BIA/Kelsey, a Chantilly,
Virginia-based consulting firm.  Groupon opened its Korean site on March 14, with a target
of 200 billion won ($176 million) in sales this year. SK said it
will also sell one or two items offered by Groupon  Korea  each
day.  Facebook Inc., owner of the most visited U.S. website, said
last month it plans to test a Groupon-like service in U.S.
cities including  San Francisco .  To contact the reporter on this story:
