Global food prices remain close to
the peak of 2008 and are fueling inflation in low-income
nations, threatening to throw more people more into poverty,
according to the  World Bank .  The bank’s food-price index was 36 percent higher than a
year ago in the first quarter, with corn, wheat and soybeans
“significantly higher” while rice remained stable, the agency
said today.  The world must renew efforts to supply food to the
vulnerable, World Bank President Robert Zoellick said today.
“Instead of controlling prices, you want to focus on the most
hurt,” Zoellick said in an interview on Bloomberg Television’s
“InBusiness” with Margaret Brennan.  Costlier food contributed to riots across northern  Africa 
and the Middle East that toppled leaders in Egypt and Tunisia
and is driving up inflation, spurring central banks to consider
higher  interest rates . The bank estimates that 44 million people
have been driven into poverty since June as a result of food
price spikes.  The surge in food prices is linked to higher oil costs, the
World Bank said. It estimates that a 10 percent increase in
crude  oil prices  is associated with a 2.7 percent rise in its
food-price index. Crude oil has risen 35 percent over the past
three months.  Factors behind the surge also include “severe weather
events in key grain exporters,” including Russia and  Australia ,
and “food demand growth outstripping output growth over the
past decade.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
