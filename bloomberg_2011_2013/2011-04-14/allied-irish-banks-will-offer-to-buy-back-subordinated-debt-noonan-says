Ireland’s Finance Minister  Michael
Noonan  said Allied Irish Bank Plc will seek to buy back
subordinated debt in coming weeks and threatened to impose
losses on holders that refuse the offer.  The government will “take whatever other action is
necessary to ensure appropriate burden-sharing” with the
lender’s remaining junior bondholders, Noonan said in a
statement today. He didn’t give any terms of the buyback.  “They’re clearly trying to spook the market with a view to
push bond prices lower so that they can get a decent take-up for
any voluntary offer,” said  Jim Ryan , director at Dublin-based
Glas Securities. “The statement is suitably vague.”  Ireland has injected 7.2 billion euros ($10.4 billion) into
the country’s second-largest lender over the past two years to
shore up its balance sheet against mounting bad loan losses. The
bank, which posted a record 10.4 billion-euro net loss for last
year, was ordered by the central bank to raise an additional
13.3 billion euros after last month’s stress tests on the
country’s lenders.  Allied Irish has 2.6 billion euros of subordinated debt,
the central bank said March 2. The lender’s 218 million euros of
10.75 percent subordinated bonds due 2017 fell 2.75 cents on the
euro to 27.5 cents, according to Bloomberg Bond Trader. The
company’s 650 million euros of 12.5 percent bonds maturing in
2019 gained 1.5 cents to 28.125 cents, the prices show.  January Fundraising  Bank of Ireland’s 747 million euros of 10 percent bonds
maturing in 2020 fell 2.75 cents to 63.5 cents on the euro,
while its 272 million pounds ($445 million) of variable rate
notes due 2020 slipped 1.33 pence to 59.7 pence.  Allied Irish has generated 2.97 billion euros of additional
capital from subordinated bond exchanges and buybacks over the
past two years, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. That
figure includes the 1.4 billion euros it generated in January
when it bought back 2 billion euros of subordinated bonds for 70
percent less than face value.  Work is also underway to ensure “appropriate burden
sharing” for subordinated bondholders of Bank of Ireland Plc
and Irish Life & Permanent Plc, with “a further statement on
this in the coming weeks,” Noonan said.  He reiterated that the government doesn’t plan to enforce
losses on senior bondholders of Allied Irish, Bank of Ireland,
EBS Building Society and Irish Life, the country’s so-called
viable lenders.  To contact the reporter on this story:
