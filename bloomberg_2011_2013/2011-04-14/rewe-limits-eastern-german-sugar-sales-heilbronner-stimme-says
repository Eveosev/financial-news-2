Rewe Group stores in eastern
 Germany  are limiting sugar sales as some customers began buying
several dozen packets of the sweetener, which is cheaper in
Germany than neighboring  Poland , Heilbronner Stimme said, citing
spokesman Andreas Kraemer.             Shoppers in Germany pay as little as 65 euro cents for a
kilogram of sugar while that volume costs 1.25 euros to 1.70
euros in Poland, the newspaper reported, without saying where it
got the infomation.   There are no supply bottlenecks and the restrictions are
designed to avoid storage problems and aggravation for clients,
Heilbronner Stimme said, citing Kraemer in an article posted on
its website.  Click here for web link  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
