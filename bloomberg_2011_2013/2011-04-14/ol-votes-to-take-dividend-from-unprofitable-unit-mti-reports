Mol Nyrt,  Hungary ’s largest
refiner, voted to take out almost 2 billion forint ($11 million)
in dividend from its unprofitable chemicals subsidiary TVK
Nyrt., state news service  MTI  said, citing a TVK executive.  TVK’s management proposed that the company pay no dividend
after it booked a net loss of 5.5 billion in 2010, MTI cited
Gabor Palffy, TVK’s communications director, as saying. Mol,
which controls 94.86 percent of TVK, rejected the proposal at
the unit’s annual general meeting today and voted for the
dividend, according to MTI.  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
