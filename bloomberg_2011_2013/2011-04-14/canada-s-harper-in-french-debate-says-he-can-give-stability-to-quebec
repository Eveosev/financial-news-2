Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper said  Quebec  voters should back his Conservative Party
because only it can deliver a stable government.  Bloc Quebecois leader Gilles Duceppe said voters should
support his party because it defends the interests of people in
 Canada ’s French-speaking province, and only it can prevent
Harper from winning a majority government. The Bloc only runs in
Quebec and won 49 of the province’s 75 seats in the last
election in October 2008.  The televised French-language debate, held in Ottawa,
followed one in English the previous night. It also included
Liberal Party Leader  Michael Ignatieff  and New Democratic Party
Leader  Jack Layton .  Recent polls indicate Harper may win the most seats in the
next election without gaining a majority. The Conservatives were
supported by 39.9 percent of decided voters, followed by 30.4
percent who supported the Liberals, according to a
CTV/Globe/Nanos election survey published today. The telephone
survey of 1,200 people was conducted April 10-12 and has a
margin of error of plus or minus 2.8 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
