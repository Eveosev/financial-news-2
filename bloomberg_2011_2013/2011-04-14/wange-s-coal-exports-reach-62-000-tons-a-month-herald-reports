Hwange Colliery Co. Ltd. of
 Zimbabwe  is exporting almost 62,000 metric tons of coal and coke
a month to southern and East African countries, the  Herald 
reported, citing Managing Director Fred Moyo.  The colliery, Zimbabwe’s biggest, recently exported 7,000
tons of the fuel to Tanzania, a first for Hwange, the Harare-
based newspaper said. Zambia is traditionally the company’s main
export destination, the Herald said.  The miner produced 2.4 million tons of coal last year, up
from 1.6 million tons in 2009, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
