European cocoa usage rose 3.5
percent in the first quarter from a year earlier, figures from
the European Cocoa Association showed.  Bean processing climbed to 353,103 metric tons from 341,096
tons a year earlier, the Brussels-based industry group said
today in its first-quarter grind report. This was the first
increase in six months. The so-called grind fell 2.5 percent to
342,427 tons in the fourth quarter from the year-earlier period.  The so-called grind in  Germany  climbed 23 percent to
108,816.6 tons in the first quarter from a year earlier, the
Association of the German Confectionery Industry, or BDSI, said
in a separate statement.  The European cocoa association gathered its figures from 24
companies including  Kraft Foods Inc. (KFT)  and Ferrero SpA.  To contact the reporter on this story:
