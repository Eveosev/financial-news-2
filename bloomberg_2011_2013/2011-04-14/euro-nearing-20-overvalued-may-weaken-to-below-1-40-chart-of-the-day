The euro may fall below $1.40 after
recent gains made it close to 20 percent overvalued in terms of
purchasing power, according to Mizuho Corporate Bank Ltd.  The CHART OF THE DAY shows how much euro-dollar exchange
rates have deviated from purchasing power parity, a measure of
the cost of goods relative to other countries, in the past 10
years. The euro reached $1.4520 on April 12, the highest since
Jan. 14 last year and widening the difference from purchasing
power to about 18 percent.  “The euro reached its peak in the past 10 years when it
was roughly 20 percent overvalued relative to PPP,” said
Daisuke Karakama, a market economist at the unit of  Japan ’s
second-largest financial group. “The euro will no longer remain
the sole winner of the euro-dollar  currency pair .”  Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said on April 4 he
expects increases in commodity prices will create a
“transitory” boost in U.S. inflation and that the central bank
would act if he’s proven incorrect. The Fed has kept its key
rate near zero since December 2008, and in November announced a
$600 billion bond-purchase plan through June to sustain growth.  The U.S. is rapidly approaching an exit from quantitative
easing, Tokyo-based Karakama said, and the euro may drop below
the $1.40 level. The shared currency traded at $1.4449 as of
8:24 a.m. in  Tokyo .  The  European Central Bank  raised  interest rates  for the
first time in almost three years on April 7. Another rate
increase seems inevitable by the middle of this year, Karakama
said, though demands for lower borrowing costs by indebted
nations in the currency union may forestall increases in the
second half.  (For a copy of the chart, click here.)  To contact the reporter on this story:
