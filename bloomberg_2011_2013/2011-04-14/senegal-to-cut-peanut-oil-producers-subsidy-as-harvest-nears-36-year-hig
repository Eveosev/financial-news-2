Senegal  may cut a subsidy given to
peanut buyers as the West African nation’s harvest grows to its
biggest in nearly four decades, Malick Ba, head coordinator at
the country’s Agriculture Ministry, said.  Senegal ’s peanut production is expected to top last year’s
total of 1.07 million metric tons as more land is cultivated
amid good weather conditions, Ba said in an interview today. The
country has reaped 246,419 tons since the start of the season in
December, 18 percent more than the same period of last year, he
said.  “Each year it goes up because the amount of land that is
being farmed goes up,” Ba said. “Our rain-fed agriculture is
doing especially well.”  Senegal may have the biggest crop since it produced 1.2
million tons of peanuts in 1975, he said. The subsidy of 15  CFA
francs  ($0.03) per kilogram of peanuts purchased at the state-
regulated price of 165 francs may be cut by tomorrow, the
earliest Senegal has ever halted giving the reduction, he said.  Peanuts account for 60 percent of Senegal’s agricultural
exports, according to the  U.S. Department of Agriculture .
Shipments by Suneor, the country’s biggest peanut-oil processing
company, account for as much as 50 percent of the world market,
according to a 2007 USDA  country report .  To contact the reporter on this story:
