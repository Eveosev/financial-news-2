Banks and financial service
companies in  London  will add more than 11,000 employees over the
next three years, the Financial Times reported, citing a study
commissioned by  BNP Paribas (BNP)  Real Estate.  About 75 percent of financial groups said business would
expand over the next three years, and 55 percent said they would
employ more staff, the FT said, citing the study.  This will trigger the requirement for an extra 1.6 million
square feet of space in central London, the study said,
according to the FT. The strongest growth is expected by smaller
financial companies while the biggest banks are expecting to
expand more slowly, the newspaper said, citing the study.  To contact the reporter on this story:
