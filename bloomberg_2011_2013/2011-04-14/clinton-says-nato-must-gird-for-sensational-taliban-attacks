U.S. Secretary of State  Hillary Clinton  warned of a “violent spring” in  Afghanistan  as
Taliban-led insurgents try to retake ground lost to NATO and
Afghan forces.  “We have to steel ourselves and our publics for the
possibility that the Taliban will resort to the most destructive
and sensational attacks we have seen,” Clinton told her North
Atlantic Treaty Organization counterparts at a meeting today in
Berlin, according to a prepared statement.  To contact the reporters on this story:
