Federal Reserve Governor Elizabeth Duke said small businesses are growing more optimistic as credit
conditions and the outlook for sales improve.  “A variety of recent survey results paints a picture of
increasing optimism about future sales and business conditions
and a corresponding easing of credit availability for small
businesses,” Duke said today in remarks prepared for a speech
in  Washington .  Small businesses, which represent more than 99 percent of
all U.S. employers, created 65 percent of new jobs in the past
17 years, according to the  U.S. Small Business Administration ,
which defines such companies as independent enterprises
employing fewer than 500 people.  Confidence among small businesses took a hit in March,
falling to a five-month low as their outlook for sales and the
economy deteriorated, a National Federation of Independent
Business survey showed April 12.  Duke, speaking during the International Factoring
Association conference, didn’t discuss forecasts for the  U.S.
economy  or her outlook for monetary policy in her prepared
remarks.  Duke, who joined the Fed in August 2008, has voted with the
Federal Open Market Committee majority on every interest-rate
decision. Before being appointed to the central bank, she was a
banker for more than 30 years, almost all in  Virginia , and was
the first woman to chair the  American Bankers Association .  To contact the reporter on this story:
