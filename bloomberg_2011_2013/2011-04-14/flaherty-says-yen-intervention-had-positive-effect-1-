Canadian Finance Minister  Jim Flaherty  said joint action the Group of Seven nations took last
month to stem the rise of the Japanese yen had a “positive
effect.”  Flaherty also said he’s always worried about rapid
movements in the Canadian dollar. Some of the country’s
manufacturers have suggested those swings are “a challenge, but
not an insurmountable challenge,” he said.  Speaking to reporters in Washington today, Flaherty also
said that “we need to make sure our retailers pass along the
advantage of the higher Canadian dollar,” in response to a  Bank
of Montreal (BMO)   report  that Canadians are paying higher prices than
U.S. consumers for many goods.  The currency rose to the strongest since November 2007
versus the  U.S. dollar  last week.  To contact the reporter on this story:
