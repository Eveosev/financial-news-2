Ambassadors from the U.K.,  France ,
Germany, Spain and Italy told the Syrian Foreign Minister of
their governments’ “very serious concerns over the continuing
deaths and violence across the country,” the U.K. Foreign and
Commonwealth Office said in an e-mailed statement today.  The ambassadors condemned the use of force against peaceful
demonstrators and called on the Syrian government to respond to
the “legitimate demands” of the country’s citizens by
“urgently” beginning a program of political reforms, the
statement said. They also called on  Syria  to release imprisoned
political prisoners and human rights activists, the statement
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
