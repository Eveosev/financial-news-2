ECM Real Estate Investments AG (ECM)  fell
for a fourth day after the Czech property developer that is in
breach of bond covenants said its loss widened last year and the
management is discussing ways to reorganize its debt.  The stock tumbled as much as 20 percent and traded down 13
percent at 52 koruna as of 11:50 a.m. in Prague, heading for its
lowest closing level on record. ECM shares have fallen 37
percent this week.  The net loss was 94.5 million euros ($137 million) compared
with 62.3 million euros in 2009, Luxembourg-registered ECM said
in a statement on its website yesterday after the stock market
closed. The executive board is analyzing options including an
“out-of-court restructuring” and “insolvency, including
reorganization,” according to the statement.  “We regard the news flow as negative for ECM shares,” Jan Roh, an analyst at Cyrrus, wrote in a report to clients today.
The brokerage is based in Brno, the second-largest Czech city.  To contact the reporter on this story:
