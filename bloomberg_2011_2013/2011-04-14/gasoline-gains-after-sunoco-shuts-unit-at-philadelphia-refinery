Gasoline gained as Sunoco Inc. shut
a fluid catalytic cracker at its Philadelphia refinery following
a fire, a day after the Energy Department reported U.S. supplies
declined the most since October 1998.  Prices rose 0.4 percent after the shutdown at the 194,000-
barrel-a-day plant, which supplies fuel to New York Harbor, the
delivery point for New York Mercantile Exchange gasoline and
heating oil futures. U.S. inventories of the motor fuel sank 7
million barrels, or 3.2 percent, last week.  “Sunoco continues to have operating problems, which is
affecting the Harbor,” said  Andy Lipow , president of Lipow Oil
Associates LLC in Houston.  Gasoline for May delivery rose 1.37 cents to $3.2561 a
gallon at 9:47 a.m. on the Nymex. Prices fell as low as $3.21
earlier.  Gasoline inventories in the U.S. East Coast were the lowest
level since the week ended Dec. 3 last week, according to
department data. Refinery shutdowns forced refiners in the
region to reduce crude inputs 28 percent last week.  Stockpiles of the motor fuel have shed 31.4 million
barrels, or 13 percent, since Feb. 11, when they were the
highest in almost 21 years.  “The market is still in an upward trend and gasoline seems
to be leading the charge,” said  Gene McGillian , an analyst and
broker at Tradition Energy in  Stamford ,  Connecticut . “The big
draw definitely helped yesterday.”  Heating oil for May delivery dropped 0.81 cent to $3.1947 a
gallon on the exchange.  Regular gasoline at the pump increased 0.4 cent to $3.812 a
gallon yesterday, AAA said on its website. That’s the highest
price since Sept. 18, 2008.  To contact the reporter on this story:
