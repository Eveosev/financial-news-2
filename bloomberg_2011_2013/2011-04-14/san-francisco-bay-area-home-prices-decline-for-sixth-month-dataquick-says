Home prices  in the  San Francisco 
Bay Area fell in March from a year earlier, the sixth straight
decline, as distressed properties accounted for almost half of
all purchases, according to  DataQuick Information Systems Inc.   The median price paid for houses and condominiums in the
nine-county region was $360,000, down 5.3 percent from $380,000
in March 2010, the San Diego-based data seller said today in a
statement. Prices rose 6.7 percent from $337,250 in February.  “The Bay Area has much less of a foreclosure problem than
the rest of the state, but by its own standards it’s still a
sizable problem that acts as a drag on prices,”  John Walsh , the
company’s president, said in the statement. “The big issue
continues to be mortgage financing, which is still problematic
for many potential borrowers.”  Foreclosures made up about a third of transactions while
short sales, where the price is less than the amount owed on the
loan, accounted for almost a fifth of purchases, DataQuick said.
A total of 7,051 houses and condominiums sold in the region last
month, up 41 percent from February and 0.2 percent from a year
earlier and the highest tally for a March in four years.  Prices declined from a year earlier in eight of the Bay
Area’s nine counties, dropping the most in Solano, 12 percent,
to a median $190,000. Prices fell 8 percent to $460,000 in  Santa
Clara , and 3.7 percent to $650,000 in San Francisco. Marin
showed the only gain, 4.4 percent, to a median $668,250.  Five counties had increases in the number of sales --
Contra Costa, Marin, Santa Clara,  San Mateo  and  Sonoma ,
according to DataQuick.  The company compiles county property data that is sold to
public agencies, lenders and title companies.  To contact the reporter on this story:
