Swiss investor confidence surged to
the highest in eight months in April, suggesting the country’s
export-driven recovery will maintain its growth momentum over
the coming months.  An index of investor and analyst expectations, which aims
to predict economic developments six months in advance, jumped
to 8.8 from minus 13.5 in March, the ZEW Center for European
Economic Research in Mannheim and Zurich-based  Credit Suisse
Group AG (CSGN)  said in an e-mailed statement today. That’s the first
positive reading and the highest level since August 2010.  Swiss companies are boosting output and hiring to meet
global export demand, encouraging  consumer spending . Machinery
maker  Sulzer AG (SUN)  said today orders rose 12 percent in the first
quarter. In  Germany ,  Europe ’s largest economy, investor
confidence fell more than economists forecast in April.  A gauge measuring confidence in the current economic
situation dropped to 61.8 in April from 67.6 in the previous
month. A sub-indicator of investors’ assessment of developments
of the benchmark Swiss Market Index increased to 70.6 from 46,
today’s report showed.  The survey was conducted between April 5 and April 11.  To contact the reporter on this story:
