Westpac Banking Corp. hired  Amelia Bourdeau , a former currency strategist at UBS AG, as a director
in institutional sales for foreign exchange in New York.  Bourdeau joined Westpac earlier this month from her
strategist position in Stamford, Connecticut, and will report to
Corinna Wong in New York, according to Debbie Connelly,
Westpac’s Sydney-based head of distribution for foreign
exchange, commodities, carbon and energy. Bourdeau previously
spent four years with investment companies Corus Capital and
Lily Pond Capital Management, Connelly said.  Westpac has also hired Angus Galletley as a director in
Asian  currency trading  based in London. Galletley starts with
Westpac next week and was previously a proprietary trader with
Credit Suisse AG, said Connelly.  To contact the reporters on this story:
