Suicide rates in the U.S. tend to
rise during recessions and fall amid economic booms, according
to study from the  Centers for Disease Control and Prevention .  Suicides  reached a record high of 22 people per 100,000 in
1932 during the Great Depression, CDC officials said in a report
published online today in the  American Journal of Public Health .
That was double the rates seen in 2000, when 10 people per
100,000 took their lives as the economy prospered, the study
found.  The study is the first to link business cycles and suicide
rates among specific age groups, according to the Atlanta-based
CDC. People in their “prime working ages” of 25 to 64 years
old are the most likely to commit suicide during recessions, the
study found.  “Economic problems can impact how people feel about
themselves and their futures as well as their relationships with
family and friends,” Feijun Luo, an economist in CDC’s Division
of Violence Prevention and the study’s lead author, said today
in a statement. “Prevention strategies can focus on
individuals, families, neighborhoods or entire communities to
reduce risk factors.”  The researchers examined economic data and suicide rates
for the 80 years ending in 2007. They didn’t evaluate suicide
rates during the recession that ended in June 2009.  To contact the reporter on this story:
