The U.K.’s  Royal Mint , established
in the 13th century, said first-quarter gold-coin production
slipped 18 percent from the previous three months.  The mint used 28,939 ounces of gold, compared with 35,113
ounces in the fourth quarter of 2010, according to data obtained
by Bloomberg News under a Freedom of Information Act request.  Gold advanced to a record $1,478.18 an ounce on April 11 as
investors sought to protect their wealth amid concerns inflation
will accelerate and as governments debase paper currencies.  The metal for immediate delivery averaged about $1,388 in
the first quarter from $1,370 in the prior three months. Gold
was at $1,467.07 an ounce by 4:14 p.m. in London. It has risen
for 10 straight years, the longest run since at least 1920.  The U.K. mint used 208,468 ounces of silver in the first
quarter, up 22 percent on the 170,251 ounces in the prior three
months. Silver averaged $31.97 an ounce in the first quarter.  The mint moved to Llantrisant in Wales from  London ’s Tower
Hill in 1968. It makes coins including the  22-carat 2011 U.K.
Sovereign Proof , weighing 7.99 grams (0.26 ounce) and costing
375 pounds ($611), the state agency’s website shows.  A 22-carat coin has a 91.6 percent gold content, according
to the World Gold Council.  To contact the reporter on this story:
