Research In Motion Ltd. (RIMM)  fell in
Nasdaq trading after its BlackBerry PlayBook, which goes on sale
in the U.S. next week to challenge  Apple Inc. (AAPL) ’s iPad, received
critical first reviews.  Technology columnists criticized the 7-inch tablet for
lacking a built-in e-mail program, and for its inability to
connect to mobile-phone networks. They also cited a shortage of
dedicated consumer applications as a weakness.  The lack of e-mail “makes the PlayBook a companion to a
BlackBerry phone rather than a fully independent device,”
personal-technology columnist Walter Mossberg wrote in the Wall
Street Journal today. To access e-mail, users need a BlackBerry
smartphone to connect through, or a Web-based e-mail account.  Not all reviews were negative. Bloomberg News’s  Rich Jaroslovsky  liked the device’s design, screen resolution and
ability to play video on a connected screen while simultaneously
browsing the Web.  “With market share for its pioneering smartphones falling,
the company desperately needs the PlayBook to be a success,”
Jaroslovsky wrote. “And it deserves to be, once the software
catches up to the hardware.”  The PlayBook will have to contend with the 9.7-inch iPad,
which came out more than a year ago and has sold more than 15
million units. RIM is counting on its traditional base of
business and government customers to embrace the PlayBook. The
company is touting the device’s portability and support for
Flash technology, used to play video on many websites. The iPad
doesn’t play Flash content.  ‘Limited’ Appeal?  “We have been hearing about the same concerns from both
the technology and investment communities,” Shaw Wu, an analyst
with Sterne, Agee and Leach Inc., wrote in a note today, citing
the poor reviews. Wu, based outside  Los Angeles , has a
“neutral” rating on RIM. These shortcomings means the
PlayBook’s appeal “may be limited,” he said.  RIM, based in Waterloo, Ontario, dropped 91 cents, or 1.7
percent, to $53.92 in Nasdaq Stock Market trading at 4 p.m. New
York time. The stock has lost 7.2 percent this year.  Mike Abramsky , an analyst at  RBC Capital Markets  in Toronto
with a “top pick’ rating on RIM, said the PlayBook’s popularity
should increase with planned improvements for the software and
hardware.  ‘‘We expect these concerns will become non-issues with
subsequent enhancements and second-gen versions,” he wrote.  To contact the reporter on this story:
