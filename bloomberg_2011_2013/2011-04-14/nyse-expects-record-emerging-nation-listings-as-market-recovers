NYSE Euronext (NYX)  expects a record
number of emerging-market initial public offerings this year as
companies seek to benefit from renewed confidence in the global
economy, said Scott Cutler, the exchange’s executive vice
president and co-head of U.S. listings.  “Demand for listings is up in every region and in Latin
America we will see IPOs from basically every country,” Cutler
said today in an interview in Santiago. “We’re in talks with
many companies from Chile,  Argentina ,  Brazil , Uruguay and
Colombia. We’re talking with more companies than ever before.”  IPOs in the first quarter at the New York-based exchange
exceeded $15 billion, making it number one in listings
worldwide, a position NYSE Euronext has been competing for
against  Hong Kong  and Shanghai, Cutler said. Listings have
recovered in the last 18 months as the global economy has
rebounded and companies have sought out “the world’s largest
pool of liquidity,” he said.  Arcos Dorados Holdings Inc., the Buenos Aires-based
operator of McDonald’s Corp. restaurants in Latin America and
the Caribbean, yesterday raised $1.25 billion in an expanded
initial share sale, 33 percent more than it sought.  The sale is a sign of U.S. investor demand for higher
returns from regions with strong growth rates, Cutler said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
