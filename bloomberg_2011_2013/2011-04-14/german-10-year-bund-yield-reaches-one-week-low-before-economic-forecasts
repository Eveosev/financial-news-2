German 10-year government bond
yields reached the lowest in a week before the nationâ€™s
government announces new economic forecasts.  Germany  sees economic growth slowing to 1.8 percent next
year after a 2.6 percent expansion this year, Bild newspaper
reported yesterday, citing the twice-yearly outlook. The
 European Central Bank , which last week raised its benchmark
interest rate for the first time in almost three years, also
releases its monthly bulletin later today. The MSCI AC Asia
Pacific Index rose 0.3 percent.  The yield on the benchmark 10-year bond was two basis
points lower at 3.42 percent as of 7:44 a.m. in London, the
lowest since April 7. The 2.5 percent security maturing January
2021 rose 0.125, or 1.25 euros per 1,000-euro ($1,451) face
amount, to 92.495. The two-year note yield was little changed at
1.86 percent.  Italy will auction as much as 6 billion euros of bonds
maturing in 2016 and 2023 today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
