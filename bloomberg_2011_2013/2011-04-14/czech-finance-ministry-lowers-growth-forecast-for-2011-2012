The Czech  Finance Ministry  lowered
its 2011 and 2012 gross domestic product forecast citing
“continued uncertainty” in the global economy.  The economy this year will expand 1.9 percent, the ministry
said in a statement today, compared with a previous forecast of
2.2 percent. GDP next year will grow 2.3 percent, compared with
a previous outlook for a 2.7 percent rise.  “The rebound of the global economy remains filled with
many uncertainties,” the ministry said in the statement. “The
main source of risks for the  Czech Republic  are linked to the
situation surrounding public finances and the banking sector in
some eurozone countries.”  Average annual inflation will be 2.1 percent in 2011 and
3.2 percent in 2012, the ministry said. It had previously
forecast 2.3 percent and 2.4 percent respectively.  To contact the reporter on this story:
