United Bank for Africa Plc (UBA) , a
Nigerian lender with operations in several countries in the
continent, said it will reopen its business in  Ivory Coast  from
May 2.  The Lagos-based bank has been making a “notional” loss of
50 million naira ($322,000) a month since it shut its operations
in Ivory Coast amid political turmoil, Rasheed Olaoluwa, an
executive director at the bank, told reporters today.  “We do not foresee any loan losses arising from closure
there,” he said in Lagos,  Nigeria ’s commercial capital.  A disputed presidential election on Nov. 28 sparked armed
conflict that forced many foreign companies, including banks, to
close down in the world’s top cocoa producer.  Shaun Gamble, a London-based spokesman at Standard
Chartered
Plc, said there were no plans to re-open operations in  Ivory
Coast  yet. Societe Generale SA said in an e-mail today that “we
hope to re-commence activity as soon as possible” and the
“safety of our staff and clients remains our primary concern.”  Ashling Cashmore, a spokeswoman for BNP Paribas in  London ,
declined to comment when called.  To contact the reporter on this story:
