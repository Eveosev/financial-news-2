U.S. Treasury Secretary  Timothy F.
Geithner  said the U.S. has room to raise taxes without hurting
the economy because its revenues make up a much smaller
percentage of economic growth than those in other advanced
economies.  “We have the capacity, with very modest changes in tax
reform” to improve the country’s fiscal position without
hurting future growth, Geithner said. The changes the Obama
administration is seeking pose “no plausible risk” to how
the economy grows, he said at an event in  Washington .  Geithner said at an event in Washington that he did not
expect any “enthusiasm” for a U.S. value-added tax.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
