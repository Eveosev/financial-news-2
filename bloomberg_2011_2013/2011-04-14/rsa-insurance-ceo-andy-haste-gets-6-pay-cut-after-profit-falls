RSA Insurance Group Plc (RSA) , the U.K.’s
biggest independent non-life insurer, cut the compensation of
Chief Executive Officer Andy Haste by 6 percent in 2010 after
full-year profit dropped.  Haste, who has been CEO since 2003, received 2.18 million
pounds ($3.6 million) in salary, allowances and bonus in 2010,
compared with 2.33 million pounds a year earlier, London-based
RSA said in its annual report  published  today.  RSA missed its underwriting profit target last year as the
coldest December in the U.K. for 100 years caused a jump in
household and auto claims. Net income fell 15 percent to 355
million pounds in 2010, the company said in February. The shares
climbed 3.8 percent over the year.  Haste’s base salary of 955,500 pounds will remain the same
in 2011, RSA said. The CEO had received a 14 percent increase in
pay in 2009.  To contact the reporter on this story:
