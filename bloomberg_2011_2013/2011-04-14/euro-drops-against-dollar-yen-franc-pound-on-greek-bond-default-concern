The euro approached a 15-month high
against the dollar on bets the sovereign-debt crisis in nations
including Portugal and Greece will be contained and the  European
Central Bank  will raise  interest rates  further.  The dollar fell to its lowest level this month against the
yen as U.S. initial jobless claims unexpectedly rose and
producer prices advanced at a slower pace, adding to speculation
the  Federal Reserve  will keep borrowing costs low. The euro slid
earlier as concern Greece will have to restructure its debt
pushed its bond yields to record highs.  “The interest-rate outlook is still favoring the euro as
the European Central Bank is ahead of the Fed on rate hiking,”
said  Stephen Gallo , head of market analysis at Schneider Foreign
Exchange in  London . “Short-term speculators were worried early
in the day by the activity in the Greek bond market and drove
the euro lower.”  The euro rose 0.3 percent to $1.4488 at 5 p.m. in New York,
from $1.4443 yesterday, after falling 0.5 percent to $1.4365.
The currency touched $1.4520 on April 12 and 13, the highest
level since January 2010. The euro was little changed 120.97
yen, from 121.08, after earlier declining 1.5 percent to 119.27.  The yen strengthened 0.4 percent to 83.50 per dollar, from
83.84, after jumping to 82.96, the strongest level since March
31.  Yen Intervention  Japan ’s currency has remained weaker than 80 versus the
dollar since March 18, when Group of Seven nations acted to curb
gains and support Japan’s export-driven economy. The currency
had rallied to a post-World War II record on speculation
insurance companies would repatriate funds to help pay for
earthquake damage.  Bank of Japan  Governor Masaaki Shirakawa said increased
risk aversion, a mass unwinding of leveraged investments known
as carry trades and the breaching of pre-set technical levels in
the foreign exchange market caused the “abrupt appreciation”
of the yen after the March 11 earthquake and tsunami.
Speculation that Japanese investors were repatriating funds was
“unfounded,” he said during a speech in  New York .  The dollar has declined 4.9 percent this year in the worst
performance except the yen among 10 developed-nation currencies
tracked in Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Currency Indexes. The
yen has dropped 7.9 percent.  Treasury two-year note yields touched 0.70 percent, the
lowest level in almost three weeks, while comparable Japanese
debt yielded 0.21 percent. The extra yield investors get to hold
U.S. two-year notes over Japanese securities was near the
narrowest on a closing basis since March 24.  Weekly Claims  The dollar fell against most its major counterparts as the
Labor Department reported that initial jobless claims
unexpectedly rose to 412,000 in the week ended April 9. The
median forecast was for a drop to 380,000. The producer price
index increased 0.7 percent in March after a 1.6 percent gain in
the previous month.  “The dollar-yen has really unwound as U.S. interest-rate
expectations have compressed,” said Boris Schlossberg, director
of research at the online currency trader GFT Forex in New York.
“Dollar bulls got nothing from jobless claims popping up over
400,000 today.”  The euro erased its drop against the dollar after European
Union Economic and Monetary Affairs Commissioner  Olli Rehn  said
he’s “quite confident” the financial-aid package being
negotiated for  Portugal  will result in the debt crisis being
contained.  ‘Higher Highs’  “We’ve seen a real retracement from 2010 losses, and there
will be higher highs for the euro,” said  Camilla Sutton , head
of currency strategy at Bank of Nova Scotia in Toronto. “We
continue to see growth in the core and a commitment by
politicians in the core to support the monetary union,”
referring to nations such as Germany and  France .  The ECB raised its main refinancing rate last week to 1.25
percent from a record low 1 percent and indicated further
increases may follow. The Fed has kept its target rate for
overnight lending between banks at zero to 0.25 percent since
December 2008.  The euro dropped earlier versus the dollar as German
Finance Minister  Wolfgang Schaeuble  told Die Welt, a newspaper,
that  Greece  may have to seek debt restructuring if an audit in
June questions its ability to pay creditors.  The risk of Greek debt restructuring has risen, and losses
to bondholders may be 50 percent to 70 percent,  Moritz Kraemer ,
 Standard & Poor’s  head of European sovereign ratings, said in an
interview with Mark Barton on Bloomberg Television’s “On The
Move” program.  The yield on the 10-year Greek bond rose above 13 percent
for the first time since the euro debuted, jumping 34 basis
points, or 0.34 percentage point, to 13.26 percent. Portuguese
10-year yields added 15 basis points to 8.89 percent, the most
since at least 1997.  To contact the reporters on this story:
