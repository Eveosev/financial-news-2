Kenya Airways Ltd. (KNAL) , sub-Saharan
Africa’s third-biggest airline, will buy nine new Boeing Corp.
787 aircraft, Managing Director Titus Naikuni said.  The agreement includes an option to buy four more planes,
he told reporters today in Nairobi, the East African nation’s
capital. The delivery, originally scheduled for October 2010,
was delayed until October 2013, Kenya Airways said in a
statement handed to reporters.  “The 787  Dreamliner  fits well with our expansion
strategy, giving us an opportunity to expand our markets beyond
the current offering while cementing our mandate of connecting
Africa to the world,” Naikuni said.  Kenya Airways will begin flying this year to seven new
destinations and seven more next year, he said. The airline has
a fleet of 31 aircraft and flies to more than 50 destinations,
according to its  website .  The company’s share price rose to the highest since March
22, gaining 5.3 percent to 34.5 shillings in Nairobi.  “It is good that they have cemented that deal, it gives
direction in terms” of investment and expansion, Victor Odendo,
an analyst at Nairobi-based Apex  Africa  Capital Ltd., said in a
phone interview today. “It also shows financial strength.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
