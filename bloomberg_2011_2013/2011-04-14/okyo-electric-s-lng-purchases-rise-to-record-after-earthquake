Tokyo Electric Power Co. purchased
a record amount of liquefied natural gas in March after two of
the utility’s nuclear  power plants  were crippled by an
earthquake and tsunami.  The utility, known as Tepco, bought 2.14 million metric
tons of LNG in March, up 9.9 percent from a year earlier, it
said on its  website  today.  The closures of its Fukushima Dai-Ichi and Fukushima Dai-Ni
nuclear power stations means the company will boost operating
rates at thermal power plants and build new generators to make
up for the loss of generating capacity, an official said.  “We need to boost thermal power plants’ output to improve
our supply capability,” Daisuke Hirose, a spokesman for the
utility, said by phone from Tokyo today. “The record LNG volume
is a result of our proactive effort to build up fuel
inventories.”  As a part of efforts to ensure power supplies during the
summer, the company plans to add 1,000 megawatts of gas turbines
by July at the latest to avert possible blackouts during the
peak demand season, Takashi Fujimoto, the company’s vice
president, told reporters in  Tokyo  yesterday.  The combined capacity of the Fukushima Dai-Ichi and
Fukushima Dai-Ni nuclear plants is 9,096 megawatts, or 14
percent of the company’s total, Tepco said.  The following table shows Tepco’s consumption and purchases
of  fuel oil , crude, LNG and coal for March. For fuel oil and
crude, the volume is in kiloliters while LNG and coal are in
metric tons.  Source: Tokyo Electric Power Co.  To contact the reporter on this story:
