German electricity for delivery
next year rose for the first time in four days after fuels
advanced, signaling higher costs for power stations in  Europe ’s
biggest market. European carbon permits also advanced.  Baseload power for 2012 rose 60 cents, or 1 percent, to
58.85 euros ($85.23), according to broker data compiled by
Bloomberg as of 6:50 p.m. Berlin time. Baseload is delivered
around the clock.  The regional benchmark contract is gaining after last week
trading at its highest price since June 2009.  Germany ’s
government last month forced the closure of 25 percent of the
country’s nuclear power capacity for a three-month safety review
and said its seven oldest atomic reactors will probably never
reopen, boosting demand for more expensive electricity generated
by burning fossil fuels.  Hard coal for next-year delivery to Amsterdam, Rotterdam or
Antwerp climbed for the first time in four days, gaining 1.2
percent to $130.75 a metric ton. The fuel accounted for about a
fifth of Germany’s power last year. Germany also produces
electricity from lignite, or brown coal, natural gas, wind and
solar plants.  EU carbon allowances for December this year rose a second
day, advancing 0.9 percent to 16.79 euros a metric ton on the
ICE Futures Europe exchange in  London .  Bloomberg tracks power prices from brokers including  GFI
