China’s fund inflows are bets on
long-term growth rather than speculative investments, said Isaac Souede, chairman and chief executive officer of  Permal Asset
Management Inc.   The  Legg Mason Inc. (LM)  unit that invests clients’ money in
 hedge funds  has $1.2 billion of its $23 billion in global funds
for China-related opportunities, according to Souede.  “The Chinese government is determined to keep  price
stability  and will keep using the quantitative and
administrative measures it takes until they work,” New York-
based Souede said in an interview in Haikou while attending the
Bo’ao Asia Forum.  There are fundamental reasons driving fund inflows into
China other than speculation on currency gains, including long-
term economic growth and higher relative interest rates, Souede
said. Banking system risks are controllable as lenders can raise
capital and regulators are doing a good job, he said.  For the past 12 months, Permal’s China-related investments
had brought a 9 percent return, according to Souede.  To contact the editors responsible for this story:
