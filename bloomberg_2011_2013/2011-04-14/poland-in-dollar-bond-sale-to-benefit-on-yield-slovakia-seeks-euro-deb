Poland  is selling $1 billion of 10-
year bonds in its fourth offering of debt in a foreign currency
this year as domestic borrowing costs rise.  Poland’s bonds may be priced to yield about 170 basis
points more than the benchmark mid-swap rate, according to
Jeremy Brewin, a portfolio manager at Aviva Investors in  London ,
who was approached by bankers arranging the sale.  Poland’s sale follows an offering by Hungary which raised a
total of $4.25 billion in the past month in a record dollar
fundraising for the country. Neighboring Slovakia, which adopted
the euro in 2009, today sold 1 billion euros ($1.4 billion) of
bonds due in 2020 at a yield to maturity of 4.664 percent, the
country’s debt agency said in an e-mailed statement from
Bratislava.  “It’s cheaper to issue in dollar right now,” said  Gyula Toth , chief strategist for emerging Europe, the Middle East and
 Africa  at UniCredit SpA said by phone from Vienna. “That’s why
in last couple of weeks we have seen Hungary doing dollars and
 Croatia  doing dollars. That’s speaks of a trend.”  The yield on Poland’s 10-year zloty bonds surged to 6.37
percent in January, the highest since June 2009, prompting the
 Finance Ministry  to skip sales of the maturity in the domestic
market in the second quarter, as accelerating inflation pressed
central bankers to increase  interest rates . Policy makers may
lift borrowing costs next month, which would be their third rate
increase this year, interest-rate derivatives indicate.  Spreads  The yield on Poland’s dollar-denominated bonds maturing in
July 2019 is currently 4.76 percent, 142 basis points, or 1.42
percentage point, lower than zloty notes due in October 2020.
The 2019 dollar bond yielded 6.22 percent in its first day of
trading in July 2009.  Hungary ’s 2021 dollar bond yielded 6.381
percent in the secondary market on March 29, compared with a
7.25 percent yield on its 2020 forint notes.  The expected yield on the bonds Poland is seeking to sell
today would be similar to the 171 basis points over mid-swaps
for  Russia ’s 2020 dollar bond. Russia is rated Baa1 by Moody’s,
its third-lowest investment grade, compared Poland’s A2, the
sixth-highest.  “We hear the transaction will yield mid-swaps plus 170,
this is the initial guidance,” Aviva’s Brewin said in a phone
interview. “They could probably do $2 billion but it’s going to
require U.S. funds to be keen. It’s fair but not cheap.”  Citigroup Inc., Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Royal Bank of
Scotland Group Plc are managing Poland’s sale, the banker said.  Poland this year sold 350 million Swiss francs ($391.9
million) of five-year bonds in February. It also raised 1
billion euros in January from bonds issued in  Europe ’s common
currency and due March 2021, and sold 18 billion yen ($216.2
million) of 15-year bonds in a private offering.  To contact the reporters on this story:
