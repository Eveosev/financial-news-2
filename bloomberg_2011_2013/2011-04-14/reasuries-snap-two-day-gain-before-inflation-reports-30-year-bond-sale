Treasuries snapped a two-day
advance before U.S. reports today and tomorrow that economists
said will show producer prices and the cost of living rose in
March for a ninth month.  The spread between yields on 10-year notes and Treasury
Inflation Protected Securities, a gauge of expectations for
consumer prices, reached 2.63 percentage points, approaching the
2.67 percentage points reached on April 11 that was the most
since March 2008. The  Federal Reserve  said yesterday the economy
expanded at a “moderate” pace in February and March. The U.S.
will auction $13 billion of 30-year bonds today, following sales
of three- and 10-year debt earlier in the week.  “Today’s producer prices are going to indicate that we
have seen the lows in  core inflation  and the only way is upward
for inflation rates,” said  Michael Leister , a fixed-income
analyst at WestLB AG in Dusseldorf,  Germany . “You have a solid
recovery and you have inflation concern and, taken together,
that’s why you are seeing a bit of pressure on Treasuries.”  The yield on the 10-year note was one basis point higher at
3.47 percent as of 8:53 a.m. in  London , according to Bloomberg
Bond Trader prices. The 3.625 percent security due in February
2021 traded at 101 9/32. The yield earlier dropped to 3.45
percent, the lowest since April 5. Ten-year yields have risen
from 3.30 percent at the start of this year.  Producer prices increased 1 percent in March from February,
economists said before the Labor Department releases the figures
today. Consumer prices rose 0.5 percent last month, a separate
Bloomberg survey showed before tomorrow’s data.  The 30-year bonds being sold today yielded 4.56 percent in
pre-auction trading, compared with 4.569 percent at the previous
sale of the securities on March 10.  Previous Auction  Investors bid for 3.02 times the amount of debt on offer
last month, versus an average 2.7 at the past 10 sales. Indirect
bidders, the group that includes foreign central banks, bought
40.7 percent, versus the 10-auction average of 39.7 percent.
Direct bidders, non-primary dealers buying for their own
accounts, purchased 6.4 percent, the least since January 2010.  The Fed said yesterday that manufacturing led a moderate
expansion across much of the U.S. in February and March, with
labor markets showing improvements in most regions. The central
bank, while keeping its benchmark interest rate close to zero
since 2008, is aiming to boost growth by completing $600 billion
of Treasury purchases through June.  To contact the reporters on this story:
