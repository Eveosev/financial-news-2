(Corrects Lockheed size and scope in first paragraph.)  Lockheed Martin Corp. (LMT) ’s bullish
options trading jumped to 23 times the four-week average
yesterday as investors bet that the largest defense contractor
by contracts received will rally even as the Pentagon seeks $400
billion in spending cuts.  More than 16,300 calls to buy the stock changed hands as of
4 p.m. yesterday in New York, 2.5 times the number of puts to
sell. The shares fell 0.7 percent to $77.73, extending
yesterday’s 2.6 percent drop following reports of the cuts.
Today’s most-active options were the May $80 calls, after about
10,000 contracts changed hands at 10:11 a.m.  “At least one investor believes this two-day selloff is
overdone and has opened a bullish five-week option position,”
 Patrick Mortimer , director of options trading at Pipeline
Trading Systems LLC in  New Hope , Pennsylvania, said in a note.
The May $80 calls “will need the shares to rise at least 5.2
percent by May expiry to begin to reap any profits.”  The U.S. Defense Department is beginning a “comprehensive
review” to find $400 billion in spending cuts as part of
President Barack Obama’s plan to reduce the federal deficit,
Pentagon spokesman  Geoff Morrell  told reporters yesterday. The
review ordered by Secretary of Defense  Robert Gates , who in
January proposed $78 billion in reductions for the next five
years, will take months and would have its first impact on the
fiscal 2013 budget, Morrell said.  Fifty-five percent of the May $80 calls traded on the ask
price yesterday while those contracts had an open interest of
452 before today, which indicate that buyers of new bullish
positions initiated most of today’s trades.  Implied volatility, the key gauge of option prices, for at-
the-money options expiring in 30 days rose to 23.19 yesterday,
the highest level in a month and at the 78th percentile of
readings in the past year, according to Bloomberg data.  To contact the reporter on this story:
