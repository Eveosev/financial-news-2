The U.S. Energy Department, urged
by President  Barack Obama  to ensure that extracting natural gas
from shale is safe, will act within six months to protect
drinking water from hydraulic fracturing, an official said.  The department plans to analyze the process that injects a
chemical solution into shale to free trapped gas, Christopher
Smith, deputy assistant secretary for oil and natural gas, said
today in an interview in Washington. The examination will seek
to ease public concern that fracking taints water supplies.  “In six months, there will be some conclusions
announced,” he said. “We will be announcing specific
actions.” He didn’t elaborate on the process or possible steps
being considered.  Obama is seeking to increase the safety of domestic natural
gas production as part of a plan to boost output and reduce U.S.
dependence on imported fossil fuels. He wants to cut purchases
of foreign oil by a third by 2025, he said on March 30.  To contact the reporter on this story:
