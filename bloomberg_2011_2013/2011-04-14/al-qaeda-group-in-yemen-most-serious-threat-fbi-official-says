The most serious terrorism threat
to the U.S. comes from members of a Yemen-based offshoot of al-
Qaeda, said a senior FBI official.  Leaders of the group called al-Qaeda in the Arabian
Peninsula, known as AQAP, have published articles on the
Internet describing their intent to strike the U.S., said Mark
F. Giuliano, the Federal Bureau of Investigation’s assistant
director for counterterrorism.  “While core AQ remains a serious threat, I believe the
most serious threat to the homeland today emanates from members
of AQAP,” said Giuliano, in  remarks  prepared for delivery today
at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy.  Several key AQAP figures were born and educated in the U.S.
and understand the country’s culture, vulnerabilities and
security protocols, he said. The group exploits social media to
share its knowledge with people of a similar mindset, he said.  “They realize the importance and value of reaching
English-speaking audiences and are using the group’s marketing
skills to inspire individuals to attack within the homeland,”
he said.  AQAP claimed credit for the December 2009 attempted bombing
of a Northwest Airlines flight on its approach to  Detroit  and
the October 2010 attempted bombings of air cargo flights headed
for the U.S. from Yemen, he said.  Efforts by the U.S. to disrupt al-Qaeda have taken a toll
on the group, making training, moving money and communicating
“very difficult,” he said. Still, “core al-Qaeda” continues
to present a “high threat” to national security, as it has the
intent and capability to attack the U.S.  To contact the reporter on this story:
