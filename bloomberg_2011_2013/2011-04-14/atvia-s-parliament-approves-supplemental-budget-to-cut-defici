Latvia’s parliament passed a
supplemental budget to lower the deficit to 4.2 percent of
economic output this year as the Baltic nation prepares to
return to international markets.  Lawmakers voted 53-37 to approve tax increases and spending
cuts in a final reading today in Riga. The shortfall before the
supplemental budget was seen at about 5.4 percent of gross
domestic product this year.  The Baltic country turned to a group led by the European
Union and the  International Monetary Fund  for a loan after its
second-biggest bank needed a state rescue in 2008. Latvia has
passed austerity measures equal to about 16 percent of GDP under
the loan program and expects to cut the deficit to less than the
EU’s limit of 3 percent of GDP in 2012 to enable euro adoption
in 2014.  Latvia used 4.4 billion euros ($6.37 billion) of its 7.5
billion-euro bailout by the end of 2010, Gunita Sapoznikova,
spokeswoman for the country’s Treasury, said in an e-mailed
response to questions from Bloomberg  today. The government
won’t draw any more from the loan after its final credit of 100
million euros from the  World Bank  this year, she said.  Latvia plans to return to markets with its first
international bond sale since 2008 in coming months. The country
may sell as much as 1.5 billion euros in bonds this year to
finance the budget.  The government may need to save a further 150 million lati
($306 million) to 180 million lati in the budget in 2012, Prime
Minister Valdis Dombrovskis said yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
