The following companies are having
unusual price changes in Bogota trading. Stock symbols are in
parentheses and prices are as of 4 p.m. New York time.  The IGBC Index fell 1.3 percent to 14,071.38, while the
Colcap Index dropped 0.7 percent to 1,670.12.  Bolsa de Valores de  Colombia  SA (BVC CB), the operator of
the country’s main securities exchange, fell 3.4 percent to
39.50 pesos, the lowest since March 16, on speculation ex-rebel
Ollanta Humala will win Peru’s presidential runoff and expand
state control of the economy after the nations integrate their
stock markets, said Carlos Eduardo Gonzalez, head researcher at
brokerage Bolsa y Renta.  Textile companies dropped on speculation a recent rally
following the Obama administration’s plans to pass a free trade
agreement with Colombia was overdone, Gonzalez said.  Enka de Colombia SA (ENKA CB), a Medellin-based synthetic
fibers producer, fell 3.5 percent to 13.8 pesos, the lowest
since Feb. 18. Textiles Fabricato Tejicondor SA (FABRI CB),
Colombia’s biggest textile maker, fell 1.4 percent to 44 pesos.  To contact the reporter on this story:
