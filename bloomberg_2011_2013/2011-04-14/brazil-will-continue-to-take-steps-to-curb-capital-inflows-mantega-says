Brazil’s Finance Minister  Guido
Mantega  said policy makers will continue to take measures to
curb capital inflows that are causing the real to strengthen,
adding that investors misinterpreted his comments about currency
gains being inevitable.  “The government will continue with a policy of containing
the strengthening of the real,” Mantega said in an interview
from Washington, where he is attending the Spring meetings of
the  International Monetary Fund . “This interpretation that now
we are worried about inflation and not the exchange rate is
wrong.”   To contact the reporter on this story:
