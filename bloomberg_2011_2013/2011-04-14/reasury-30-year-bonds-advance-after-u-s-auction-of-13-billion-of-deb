The yield gap between Treasury 2-
and 30-year securities shrank to the narrowest in a week after
claims for jobless benefits unexpectedly rose and wholesale
costs slowed, tempering speculation the economy is improving.  The spread contracted today as the U.S. drew higher-than-
forecast demand at an auction of $13 billion of 30-year debt. A
bond-market gauge that signals traders’ inflation expectations
declined after a report showed producer prices increased less
than forecast. Treasury notes fell.  “The theme over the last couple of weeks is that inflation
would be a problem, but then the data starts weakening and
people start talking about a weak economy,” said  Charles Comiskey , head of Treasury trading at Bank of Nova Scotia in  New
York . “The focus is on the inflation news for tomorrow.”  The benchmark 30-year bond yield was little changed at 4.55
percent at 2:28 p.m. in New York, according to BGCantor Market
Data. The yield touched 4.67 percent on April 11, the highest
level since March 8, after falling to 4.36 percent on March 16.  Ten-year note yields rose three basis points to 3.49
percent. They earlier touched 3.42 percent, the lowest level
since April 5.  To contact the reporters on this story:
