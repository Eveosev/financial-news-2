Peru ’s central bank sold dollars
for the first time in more than two years after the sol dropped
to a four-month low amid concern former military rebel Ollanta Humala may win a presidential runoff.  Banco Central de Reserva del Peru sold $91 million and
issued 350 million soles ($124 million) of sol-indexed
certificates amid “strong volatility” in the sol, the bank
said in an e-mail. Demand for dollars came from private pension
funds, local traders and foreign investors, it said.  Humala, a one-time ally of  Hugo Chavez  who pledged to
renegotiate contracts with foreign companies, came first in the
April 10 first round of the Andean country’s presidential
election. Investors are concerned he may win a June 5 runoff
against congresswoman Keiko Fujimori and increase state control
of the $153 billion economy, said  Enrique Alvarez , head of Latin
American fixed-income research at IDEAglobal in  New York .  “The market has a lot of doubts about what is going to
happen on the political spectrum,” Alvarez said. “There is
going to be a greater number of investors either leaving the
market or trying to hedge their positions in greater numbers as
we approach the second round vote.”  The sol ended little changed at 2.8225 per  U.S. dollar 
today, from 2.8215 yesterday. The currency earlier fell to
2.8288, its weakest level since Nov. 30.  The yield on the nation’s benchmark 7.84 percent sol-
denominated bond due August 2020 rose 20 basis points, or 0.20
percentage point, to a two-year high of 7.10 percent, according
to Deutsche Bank AG’s local unit. The yield increased 45 basis
points this week.  To contact the reporter on this story:
