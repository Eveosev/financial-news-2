The U.S. and its allies need to
provide long-term support to Egypt, Tunisia and other nations
undergoing political transitions, said  Lael Brainard , the
Treasury Department’s undersecretary for international affairs.  In an op-ed article published today on ForeignPolicy.com,
Brainard called for international efforts to educate and find
work for young men and women. She also said aid resources need
to be linked to “home-grown reforms” that incorporate local
efforts to improve governance.  “Our engagement will need to be long term and
multilateral. Economic transitions will take many years, and
formidable challenges lie ahead,” Brainard said. “While short-
term assistance on the recovery is important, to be truly
effective in underwriting a new, more inclusive growth model, we
must be prepared to work through the setbacks and scale up
successes.”  The U.S. will provide direct assistance to  Egypt  and
Tunisia while also working with development banks to aid the
region, Brainard said. The  World Bank , the International Finance
Corp. and the African Development Bank have more than $4 billion
“potentially available” to those two countries over the next
year, she said.  “Alongside our partners in the Middle East and  Europe , the
United States stands ready to support these democratic
transitions through renewed multilateralism,” Brainard said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
