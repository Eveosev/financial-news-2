Tokyo  Electric Power Co. is in
talks with the Japanese government on a plan to compensate
victims of the accident at the company’s nuclear power plant in
northern  Japan , the Yomiuri newspaper reported.  The initial plan includes a proposal for payments of about
1.5 trillion yen ($18 billion) to be deducted from Tepco’s
profits over 15 years, the newspaper reported, without saying
where it obtained the information.  The government is also considering gathering contributions
from other Japanese utilities, based on the number of nuclear
reactors in operation, the report said. The money could be used
for immediate payment to victims and as an insurance fund
against future accidents, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
