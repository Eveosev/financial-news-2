BTA Bank, the Kazakh lender that
defaulted in 2009, said it will merge two pension funds and a
company managing pension assets to create the country’s second-
largest endowment.  The merged funds will have a 20 percent market share with a
combined 1.9 million depositors, the Almaty-based lender said
today in an e-mailed statement. The bank had controlling stakes
in the UlarUmit and BTA  Kazakhstan  funds and in pension asset
manager Zhetisy, Asel Tynyshbekova, BTA’s spokeswoman, said by
phone. The lender will control the new entity, called UlarUmit,
following the merger, she said.  BTA, Kazakhstan’s third-largest bank by assets, defaulted
in April 2009, two months after being taken over by state-owned
National Wellbeing Fund Samruk-Kazyna, which now has a stake of
about 81 percent in BTA. The lender’s indebtedness fell to $4.2
billion from $16.7 billion after distributing shares with cash
to creditors and issuing new debt, it said in September.  BTA’s UlarUmit fund had 6.5 billion tenge ($44.7 million)
in assets as of March 1 and BTA Kazakhstan fund oversaw 11.5
billion tenge, according to the Kazakh financial regulator’s
 website . Halyk Savings Bank’s pension fund is the country’s
biggest with 31.4 billion tenge in assets, the data showed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
