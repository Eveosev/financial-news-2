Omnicane Ltd. (MTMD) , Mauritius’s largest
sugar producer by volume, said production of the sweetener may
rise as much as 36 percent this year after the company boosted
its refinery capacity, according to Chief Executive Officer
Jacques d’Unienville.  The La Baraque-based refinery will process about 140,000
metric tons of white sugar in 2011 compared with 102,921 tons
last year, he said in an April 8 interview in the capital, Port
Louis.  The company will invest another 200 million rupees ($7.2
million) this year on its conditioning storage silos, he said.
This will bring total investment in the refinery to 1.6 billion
rupees since 2009 and will increase capacity to 190,000 tons.  The higher output may help its sugar unit return to profit,
d’Unienville said. Omnicane said on March 30 that its sugar
division made a loss of 81.5 million rupees in full-year 2010 on
lower revenue and higher employee costs. Company profit fell 3.7
percent to 248.9 million rupees.  Omnicane, which also produces electricity, plans to start
building a 15-million liter (3.96 million gallons) a year
ethanol plant in June, while focus on improving efficiency in
all its units will probably boost revenue by about 10 percent a
year for the next five years, d’Unienville said.  “We are operating a completely different business model
compared to a decade ago as the industry has evolved away from a
raw sugar making,” he said.  Shares in Omnicane fell 0.5 rupees, or 0.7 percent, to 72
rupees at 12:40 p.m. in  Port Louis , extending the decline this
year to 2.7 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
