Soybeans dropped to the lowest in
almost four weeks on speculation that central banks will boost
 interest rates  to fight inflation, reducing demand for supplies
from the U.S., the biggest exporter. Corn was unchanged.  Rising food and fuel costs may pressure importing countries
to slow the pace of growth. The leaders of Brazil, Russia,
 India ,  China  and  South Africa  said excessively volatile
commodities pose a threat to the global economy. Corn prices
have more than doubled in the past year, and soybeans rose 37
percent.  “The bullish commodity environment is changing” with the
threat of higher interest rates, said  Don Roose , the president
of U.S. Commodities Inc. in West Des Moines, Iowa. “The markets
are focused on the potential for slowing demand,” which will
encourage speculators to reduce bets on higher prices, he said.  Soybean futures for July delivery fell 2.25 cents, or 0.2
percent, to close at $13.4275 a bushel at 1:15 p.m. on the
 Chicago  Board of Trade, after touching $13.2825, the lowest
since March 18. Prices have dropped 4.3 percent this week,
partly on speculation that China will reduce imports as the
government sells discounted supplies from state reserves to
curtail inflation.  Corn futures for July delivery were unchanged at $7.61 a
bushel in Chicago, after earlier falling to $7.475, the lowest
since April 4. On April 11, the commodity reached $7.8875, the
highest since June 2008, after the U.S. said domestic
inventories before the harvest would fall to a 15-year low.  Corn futures for December delivery, after the harvest, rose
1.6 percent on speculation that wet, cool weather the next two
weeks will delay plantings across the Midwest, said  Jerry Gidel ,
a market analysts for North American Risk Management Services
Inc. in Chicago. That could result in lower yields, as crops
reproduce during the hottest part of the U.S. summer, he said.  Corn is the biggest U.S. crop, valued at $66.7 billion in
2010, followed by soybeans at $38.9 billion, government figures
show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
