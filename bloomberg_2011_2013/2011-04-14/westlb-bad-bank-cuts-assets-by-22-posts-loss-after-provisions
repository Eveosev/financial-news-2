WestLB AG’s bad bank, Erste
Abwicklungsanstalt, has wound down 22 percent of its original
portfolio and reiterated plans to cut assets by half by 2014.  Assets decreased to 60.7 billion euros ($87.8 billion) at
the end of March, from 77.5 billion euros in December 2009, the
Dusseldorf, Germany-based company said in a statement on its
website. The bad bank posted a net loss of 600 million euros in
2010 after setting aside money to cover bad loans.  WestLB needed aid from its owners, which include the German
state of North-Rhine Westphalia, as well as the country’s Soffin
bank-rescue fund after running up losses during the global
financial crisis. The state-owned lender shifted about one-third
of its assets to the bad bank, which it established with the
help of Soffin in December 2009.  “The figures show that we are on the right track and that
the agency’s model is working,” Markus Bolder and Matthias
Wargers, board members of Erste Abwicklungsanstalt, said in
today’s statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
