Colombia ’s Finance Minister Juan Carlos Echeverry said he would analyze the need for measures to
ease gains in the peso after April 25 when companies have
finished paying their taxes,  Radio Super  reported.  “It doesn’t make sense at the moment to take specific
measures,” Echeverry said on Bogota-based Radio Super, adding
that he considers an exchange rate of about 1,900 pesos per
dollar an “equilibrium.”  The peso rose 0.8 percent today to 1,804.5 per dollar at
1:59 p.m. New York time.  Echeverry said April 7 that gains in the peso are a result
of companies bringing in funds from overseas to pay local taxes
and ruled out taking measures to ease the currency’s
appreciation given the “temporary” nature of the inflows.
Companies are slated to pay taxes between April 8 and April 25.  To contact the reporter on this story:
