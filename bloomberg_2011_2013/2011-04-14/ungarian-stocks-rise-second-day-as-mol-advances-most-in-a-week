Hungarian stocks fell as concern
European countries will reschedule debt outweighed a rally in
Mol Nyrt. on an increased estimate of oil flows from one of its
wells.  The benchmark BUX index of shares slid 0.5 percent to
23,766.05 by the 5 p.m. close in Budapest. Mol closed 0.6
percent higher at 24,650 forint. OTP Bank Nyrt., which like Mol
has a weighting of more than 30 percent in the BUX, fell 1.8
percent to 6,120 forint.  “The euro zone periphery debt market has moved back into
the fore,”  Marc Chandler , a strategist at Brown Brothers
Harriman & Co. in  New York , and colleagues wrote in an e-mail.  Bonds of  Europe ’s most-indebted nations fell, driving
Portuguese and Greek yields to records, on concern Europe’s most
indebted countries will reschedule debt repayments. Stocks and
U.S. index futures declined, while the yen and silver advanced.  Gulf Keystone Petroleum Ltd. (GKP)  jumped as much as 18 percent
in  London  after raising its estimate of gross oil in place
volumes at the Shaikan find in the Kurdistan region of Iraq,
owned jointly with Mol, to 4.9 billion barrels from 1.9 billion
barrels. The extra output from Shaikan raises Mol’s fair value
by about 450 forint per share based on its 20 percent stake in
the Kurdistan project, said Olena Kyrylenko, an analyst at KBC
Securities in Budapest.  “This kind of potential on the upstream was known on the
market, now they started to prove it,” Kyrylenko said in a
telephone interview.  OTP was downgraded to “hold” from “buy” at UniCredit
SpA and to “neutral” at Macquarie Research.  To contact the reporter on this story:
