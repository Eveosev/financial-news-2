Sul America SA (SULA3) , the Brazilian
insurer 36 percent-owned by  ING Groep NV (INGA) , may buy companies to
expand in its home market as a rising middle class spurs demand
for coverage.  “We’re looking for acquisitions that are accretive to our
portfolio that are aligned within our business segments, meaning
health, dental, auto and distribution channels for our mass-
marketing products,” Thomaz Cabral de Menezes, chief executive
officer of Rio de Janeiro-based Sul America, said yesterday in
an interview at Bloomberg headquarters in  New York . “For the
time being, the focus is 100 percent in Brazil.”  Sul America is weighing acquisitions against investments in
existing businesses after the Brazilian economy grew 7.5 percent
in 2010. Net income climbed to 426.6 million reais ($268.9
million) last year, or 3.2 percent, from 413.5 million reais in
2009 as premiums rose, according to a  statement  on the company’s
website.  “The expansion of the middle class, plus the new consumers
coming in, you’re talking between 50 to 100 million people that
eventually are going to be looking for insurance,” said Cabral
de Menezes.  The insurer said in December that it would buy Dental Plan
Ltda. to gain customers in the north and northeast regions of
 Brazil . Sul America acquired a 49.92 percent stake in health
insurer Brasilsaude Companhia de Seguros in July.  To contact the reporter on this story:
