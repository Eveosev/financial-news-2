Air France, whose entire fleet of
short-haul planes consists of Airbus SASâ€™s A320-series aircraft,
is talking to Airbus about the possible purchase of A320neo
models, which offer newer engines, an airline spokeswoman said.  Air France, the French unit of  Air France-KLM (AF)  Group,
already operates 140 A320-series planes and is talking to the
European manufacturer to learn what benefits would be available
if it chose A320neo planes to replace older aircraft or expand
the fleet, Brigitte Barrand, the spokeswoman, said today in an
e-mail.  To contact the reporters on this story:
