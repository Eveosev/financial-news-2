LyondellBasell Industries NV (LYB) , a
chemical producer, flared gases at its complex in Channelview,
 Texas , according to a message left on a community hot line.  The message, recorded at 11 p.m. yesterday, said the
company expected to stop flaring “as rapidly as possible.”  The complex has two olefin units at its north side facility
that manufacture ethylene, propylene, butadiene and benzene,
according to the Rotterdam, Netherlands-based company’s  website .
The south-side operation uses many of those to produce gasoline-
blending products and other chemicals.  The Channelview complex is about 20 miles (32 kilometers)
east of downtown Houston.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
