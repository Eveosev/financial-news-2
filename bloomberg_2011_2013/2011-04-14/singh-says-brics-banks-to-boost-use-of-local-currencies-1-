State development banks of the
BRICS countries plan to use local currencies when making loans
within the five nations in the group, Indian Prime Minister
 Manmohan Singh  said.  Singh spoke at the summit of the so-called BRICS nations in
the resort of Sanya in China today. BRICS stands for Brazil,
Russia, India, China and  South Africa .  The state development banks of the five nations will work
on a plan to allow companies from their countries to tap credit
from the lenders when they invest in any of the BRICS nations,
 Luciano Coutinho , head of Brazil’s state development bank, known
as BNDES, said. The banks signed an agreement to reinforce
cooperation during the summit in Sanya.  “We need to build reciprocity in a way that the expansion
of Brazilian companies abroad may receive the support of the
development bank of these economies,” Coutinho told reporters
in Sanya. “Our priority is the development of the Brazilian
manufacturer and the attraction on investments that add value
and technology.”  Brazil , Russia, India and South Africa are pushing China to
import more than commodities such as soy and iron ore and are
seeking ways to attract investment to increase production of
high-technology and manufactured goods.  China Development Bank Corp. said its loans to the so-
called BRICS nations has reached more than $38 billion to date,
according to a statement on the lender’s website.  That money has been invested in infrastructure and in
resources projects in Brazil, Russia, India and South Africa,
according to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
