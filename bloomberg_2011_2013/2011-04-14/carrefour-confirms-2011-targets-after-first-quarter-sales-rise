Carrefour SA (CA) , the world’s second-
largest retailer, confirmed its 2011 forecasts for revenue and
profit growth after first-quarter sales rose 3.9 percent, led by
improvement in Latin America and Asia.  Revenue climbed to 24.7 billion euros ($35.7 billion), the
Boulogne-Billancourt, France-based company said today in a
statement after markets closed. The average estimate of seven
analysts surveyed by Bloomberg was for revenue of 24.8 billion
euros. Sales in emerging markets climbed 12 percent.  Carrefour is facing intensifying competition in France, its
largest market, from rivals such as  Casino Guichard-Perrachon
SA (CO) , which this week posted a 19 percent increase in first-
quarter sales and said it’s gaining market share in the country.
The retailer is betting a 1.5 billion-euro revamp of superstores
in western  Europe  will boost sales and profit through 2015.  Carrefour has made “a weak start to the year,” Nicolas Champ, an analyst at Nomura International in  London , wrote in an
April 6 note.  Carrefour fell 40 cents, or 1.3 percent, to 31.04 euros in
Paris trading today. The shares have advanced 0.6 percent this
year, valuing the company at 21.1 billion euros.  To contact the reporter on this story:
