  FirstRand Ltd. (FSR) , South Africa’s
second-biggest financial services company, said it plans to buy
a majority stake in  Sterling Bank (STERLNBA)  Plc of Nigeria as it seeks to
expand in Africa.  “Nigeria is a key market for FirstRand’s African expansion
given the strong underlying growth prospects in the Nigerian
financial services sector,” the Johannesburg-based company said
in a stock exchange filing today. “Sterling has a national
footprint in Nigeria with 99 branches nationwide.”  FirstRand has been considering Nigerian banks since 10
lenders failed an audit in 2009 and asset prices fell, according
to the country’s central bank, which invited bidders for both
healthy and distressed banks. FirstRand said on Dec. 2 it plans
to enter Nigeria, Tanzania,  Angola , Ghana and Kenya.  The lender is expanding its investment-banking, retail and
insurance offerings across a continent with more than 1 billion
people.  While the acquisition of Sterling would be “strategically
significant,” the transaction is unlikely to have a material
effect on FirstRand’s share price if it goes ahead, FirstRand
said.  FirstRand’s shares fell the most in a month, declining 41
cents, or 2 percent, to 19.86 rand at the close in Johannesburg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
