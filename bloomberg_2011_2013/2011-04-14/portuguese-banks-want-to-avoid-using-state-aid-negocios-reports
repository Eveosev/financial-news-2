Portuguese banks will do
“everything that is within their reach” to avoid resorting to
aid from the Portuguese state, Jornal de Negocios reported,
citing unidentified people at the lenders.  Banco Comercial Portugues SA (BCP) ,  Banco Espirito Santo SA (BES)  and
 Banco BPI SA (BPI)  plan to use their own means to meet possible new
requirements if a higher capital level is required, the
Portuguese newspaper said. Measures that are being considered
include selling loan portfolios and “strategic” shareholdings,
according to Negocios. The banks don’t rule out selling new
stock, the newspaper said.   Click here for web link  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
