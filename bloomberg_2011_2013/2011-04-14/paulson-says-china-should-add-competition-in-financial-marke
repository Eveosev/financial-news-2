China should add more competition
in its financial markets,  Henry Paulson  said today at the Boao
Forum in the southern Chinese province of Hainan.  “It’s the right decision for China to diversify its
financial institutions,” the former U.S. treasury secretary
said.  The property market is a problem for China as real estate
is the investment choice for most people, Paulson said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
