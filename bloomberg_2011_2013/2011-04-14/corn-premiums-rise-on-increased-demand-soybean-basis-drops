Cash premiums for corn shipped in
April to terminals near  New Orleans  rose relative to Chicago
futures as demand improved. The soybeans basis fell as buying is
shifting to newly harvested supplies in  South America .  The spot-basis bid, or premium, for corn delivered in the
second half of this month was 51 cents to 59 cents a bushel
above May futures, compared with 51 cents to 56 cents yesterday,
 U.S. Department of Agriculture   data  show. The basis for soybeans
delivered in April fell to 58 cents to 64 cents a bushel from 58
cents to 67 cents.  “Corn export sales improved a little, and shipments will
begin to ramp up the next several weeks,” said Brian Basting, a
market analyst for Advance Trading Inc. in Bloomington,
 Illinois . “Soybean demand is slipping because of the increased
competition from Brazil and  Argentina .”  Corn futures for May delivery fell 1.25 cents, or 0.2
percent, to $7.5425 a bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade
today. Soybean futures for May delivery declined 2.5 cents, or
0.2 percent, to $13.31 a bushel on the CBOT.  In the week ended April 7, exports of corn for shipment
before Aug. 31 rose 37 percent from a week earlier to 847,959
metric tons, even as prices rose to the highest since July 2008,
the U.S. Department of Agriculture said today in a report.
Soybean sales for delivery by Aug. 31 were down 18 percent from
a year earlier, USDA data show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
