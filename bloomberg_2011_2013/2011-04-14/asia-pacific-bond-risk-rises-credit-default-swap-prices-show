The cost of protecting Asia-Pacific
bonds from non-payment increased, according to traders of
credit-default swaps.  The Markit iTraxx Asia index of 50 investment-grade
borrowers outside  Japan  rose one basis point to 107 basis points
as of 8:11 a.m. in Singapore, according to  Credit Agricole . The
risk benchmark is on course for its highest close since March 31,
according to CMA in  New York .  The Markit iTraxx Australia index advanced one basis point
to 105.5 as of 10:11 a.m. in Sydney, Credit Agricole prices show.
The Markit iTraxx Japan index rose 0.5 basis point to 132.25 as
of 9:05 a.m. in Tokyo, according to Deutsche Bank AG.  Swap contracts insuring Japanese government debt against
default were little changed at 84.5 basis points, Deutsche Bank
prices show.  Credit-default swap indexes are benchmarks for protecting
bonds against default and traders use them to speculate on
 credit quality . A drop signals improving perceptions of
creditworthiness, while an increase suggests the opposite.  The swap contracts pay the buyer face value in exchange for
the underlying securities if a borrower fails to meet its debt
agreements. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  To contact the reporter on this story:
