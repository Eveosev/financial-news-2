Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA) ’s Nigerian
unit said oil production resumed at its offshore Bonga field,
which pumps about 10 percent of the country’s crude, after the
completion of maintenance work.  “The maintenance works, which commenced on February 28
this year, were executed safely and within schedule,” Shell
said in an e-mailed statement today. “Production will be
gradually ramped up over the coming weeks.”  The Bonga field, located 120 kilometers (75 miles) in the
Atlantic waters offshore Nigeria, has the capacity to pump about
200,000 barrels of crude and 150 million cubic feet of gas a
day, Shell said. It also supplies natural gas to Nigeria LNG
Ltd.’s liquefaction plant on the coastal Bonny Island that
supplies long-term buyers in  Europe .  Nigeria is  Africa ’s top oil producer and the fifth-biggest
source of U.S. crude imports. The country’s crude is mostly of
the light, sweet variety favored by U.S. refiners for the
quantity of gasoline it produces when processed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
