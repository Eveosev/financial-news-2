(Corrects attribution in first paragraph, adds UBS
spokeswoman in third paragraph.)  UBS AG (UBSN)  may reorganize its
investment bank,  Handelszeitung  reported today, without citing
anyone.  People in banking had interpreted UBS Chief Financial
Officer John Cryan’s cancelation of a London presentation as a
sign that the investment bank, the part of UBS where most change
is under way, would see a “large reorganization,” the Swiss
paper said, citing unidentified people in the industry.  “Currently, there are no plans for a reorganization,” UBS
spokeswoman Dominique Scheiwiller said by telephone today. As
soon as it’s clear which regulatory “rules are applicable,
internationally active banks will have to re-align their
businesses -- and that also holds true for UBS,” she said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
