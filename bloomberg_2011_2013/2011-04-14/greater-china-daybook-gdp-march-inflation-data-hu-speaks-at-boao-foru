China ’s growth probably slowed in
the first quarter, helping to defuse the risk of overheating in
an economy where inflation is estimated to be running at its
fastest pace since 2008.  The government will report today that gross domestic
product rose 9.4 percent from a year earlier, according to the
median estimate in a Bloomberg News survey of 25 economists,
down from last year’s peak rate of 11.9 percent. March consumer-
price inflation probably accelerated to 5.2 percent from 4.9
percent, according to the median estimate of 23.  China’s statistics bureau is scheduled to release growth
and inflation numbers at 10 a.m. in Beijing. The government is
also scheduled to release the  producer price index , industrial
output, retail sales and fixed-asset investment.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
