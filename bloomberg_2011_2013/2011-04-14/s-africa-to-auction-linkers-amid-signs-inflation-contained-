South Africa  is offering 600
million rand ($90 million) of inflation-linked bonds tomorrow
after the central bank said price growth in  Africa ’s biggest
economy is “well-contained.”  The Pretoria-based central bank will auction inflation-
linked debt maturing in 2017, 2022 and 2033 at its weekly
auction, it said on its Bloomberg page. The bonds, known as
linkers, pay interest on a principal amount that is indexed to
the  consumer price index . When inflation is low, their value
declines relative to fixed-interest debt.  Rising oil prices probably won’t push inflation higher than
the  Reserve Bank ’s 3 percent to 6 percent target range, Gerhard
van den Heever, the central bank’s deputy chief economist, told
lawmakers in  Cape Town  yesterday. The bank said on March 24 it
expects the inflation rate to average 4.7 percent in 2011 and
5.7 percent in 2012. The rate was unchanged at 3.7 percent in
February.  “The oil price has gone right through the roof again,”
Van den Heever said. “It is not the end of the world. Other
factors have made inflation slow down quite nicely. We are
confident that this negative impact from the oil price will be
dealt with adequately.”  Inflation may quicken to an annual 5.79 percent over the
next two years, according to the yield difference, or breakeven
rate, between two-year inflation-linked bonds and standard notes
of similar maturity.  To contact the reporter on this story:
