Singapore ’s third monetary policy
tightening in a year may prompt Asian central banks to allow
further interest-rate and currency gains to prevent surging
prices from hurting their economies.  The island’s dollar, the best-performing Asian currency
outside  Japan  in the past year and the nation’s main tool to
manage inflation, will be allowed to rise further, the  Monetary
Authority of Singapore  said yesterday. While South Korea and
 Indonesia  refrained from raising rates this month, policy makers
signaled they will take steps to curb price gains if needed.  “MAS remains well ahead of the curve after aggressive
moves last year,” said  Vishnu Varathan , an economist in
Singapore at  Capital Economics  (Asia) Pte. “The other central
banks have to ask themselves how much tightening they want to do
and how soon they want to do it. There’s still some feet-
dragging and they can’t be seen hesitating too much as it will
send the wrong signals to the market.”  Asia’s policy makers are juggling the need to contain
inflation fueled by  oil prices  near a 30-month high while
protecting their economies’ export-led expansion. The region can
afford to remove fiscal and monetary stimulus at a “stronger
and faster” rate as its growth outpaces the rest of the world,
according to the World Bank.  The Singapore dollar jumped today to the strongest level
since at least 1981 when Bloomberg data began, reaching as high
as S$1.2432 a dollar. The central bank re-centered the
currency’s policy band upwards and economists including Irvin Seah at  DBS Group Holdings Ltd. (DBS)  say the move amounts to a one-
off revaluation.  Currency Tool  The currency has climbed more than 10 percent over the past
year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Unlike most
central banks that use rates to control inflation, Singapore
conducts monetary policy through its exchange rate, adjusting
the pace of appreciation or depreciation against an undisclosed
band of currencies.  The island’s gross domestic product grew 23.5 percent last
quarter from the previous three months, more than twice the pace
economists forecast, according to preliminary estimates from the
trade ministry yesterday. Earnings at Singapore companies
including lender DBS Group and property developer City
Developments Ltd. have surged after the economy’s expansion
boosted demand for loans and spurred home prices to a record.  Policy makers who remove stimulus too late won’t see a
meaningful impact and will fail to address rising inflation
expectations, Sri Mulyani Indrawati, a  World Bank  managing
director, said April 8. She cited  China , Vietnam and Indonesia
as possible examples.  China Inflation  China’s consumer prices climbed 5.4 percent in March from a
year earlier, the most since 2008, data from the statistics
bureau showed today. The economy grew a faster-than-estimated
9.7 percent last quarter.  Chinese officials are reining in lending to counter
inflation after a record expansion of credit in 2009 and 2010,
with the central bank boosting  interest rates  four times since
mid-October and raising banks’ reserve requirements. The Asian
nation will implement “prudent” monetary policy and ensure
stable consumer prices, the State Council said this week.  Indonesia has left borrowing costs unchanged at the past
two meetings, while the  Philippines  raised its key rate for the
first time since August 2008 last month. Vietnam’s inflation
accelerated to 13.89 percent in March, the fastest in 25 months,
even as the central bank raised interest rates.  Behind the Curve  In  South Korea , the central bank held its key rate at 3
percent this week even as it raised its inflation forecast for
2011 to 3.9 percent from 3.5 percent previously. Bank of Korea
Governor Kim Choong Soo said this week he will take monetary
policy action “neither too slowly nor too fast.”  Indonesia still faces the risk of “high” inflationary
pressures as food and oil prices rise, Governor Darmin Nasution
said this week, adding that the rupiah’s gains will help contain
price pressures and its appreciation may continue this year.  South Korea, Indonesia and India are already “behind the
curve” along with possibly  Thailand  and China, said  Win Thin ,
head of emerging-market strategy at Brown Brothers Harriman & Co.
in  New York . The central banks of  Malaysia  and the Philippines
are at risk of also falling behind if they don’t raise rates at
their meetings in May, he said.  “Most in  Asia  are operating at or near full capacity, and
with commodity prices still buoyant, there should be no
hesitation to tighten,” Thin said. “All of these central banks
should take a lesson from the MAS and tighten without fear of
slower growth and a stronger currency.”  Thai Decision  Unrest in  Libya  and the Middle East helped push oil prices
to $113.46 a barrel this week, increasing inflationary pressure
around the world.  The Bank of Thailand will raise its benchmark rate by a
quarter of a percentage point to 2.75 percent at its April 20
meeting, according to all eight economists surveyed by Bloomberg
News. India’s central bank raised rates last month for the
eighth time in a year, boosting the repurchase rate by a quarter
point to 6.75 percent after raising the inflation forecast twice
since late January.  Singapore’s consumer prices gained 5 percent or more in the
first two months of 2011. The central bank said yesterday
inflation may reach the upper end of its 3 percent-to-4 percent
forecast range this year.  Export Competitiveness  While the Singapore monetary authority adjusted the
currency band upwards, it also kept it below the prevailing
level of the nominal effective exchange rate.  “While growth is still strong and inflation a concern,
much tightening has already been delivered in the past, and
therefore a full additional dose is not warranted,” Perry Kojodjojo, a currency strategist at HSBC Holdings Plc in  Hong
Kong , said after the central bank decision yesterday.  The Singapore government has also said too much
appreciation would hurt the export competitiveness of the nation,
home to the world’s second-busiest container port located at the
southern end of the 600-mile (965-kilometer) Malacca Strait. The
island has remained vulnerable to fluctuations in overseas
demand for manufactured goods even after the government boosted
financial services and tourism.  Non-oil shipments may increase 8 percent to 10 percent in
2011, after growing 22.8 percent last year, according to
government forecasts.  “This ‘half re-centering’ was a likely a result of a
compromise between policy makers who acknowledged the need for
further tightening but yet had concerns on the strength of the
 Singapore dollar  and the impact on competitiveness,” Goldman
Sachs Group Inc. economists Mark Tan and Jerry Peng said in a
note yesterday. “This compromised nature of tightening also
suggests the bar to further incremental tightening moves ahead
has likely been raised.”  Singapore is next scheduled to review its monetary policy
in October.  To contact the reporter on this story:
