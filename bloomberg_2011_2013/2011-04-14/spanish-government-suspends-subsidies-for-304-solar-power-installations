Spanish energy regulators are finding
that more than one of every four solar power producers may have
been collecting excessive subsidies.  The National Energy Commission, in its latest wave of
investigations, suspended subsidy payments to 157 photovoltaic
power installations for not meeting regulatory requirements, the
 regulator  said late yesterday in statement. That brought to 808
the number of operators penalized this way out of 3,042
investigated so far this year.  The owners of photovoltaic parks and rooftop systems failed
to prove they were capable of producing power by the Sept. 30,
2008, deadline to be eligible for earning the highest consumer-
subsidized rate. That tariff is 47.5 euro cents (67.8 U.S.
cents) a kilowatt-hour, or about nine times today’s spot price
paid to operators of fossil fuel power plants.  Spain  is trying to reduce aid for many of the nation’s
renewable-energy plants as a way to lower electricity costs for
businesses and homes and help the economy emerge from its worst
slump in 60 years.  Armed with a law passed in 2010, the energy regulator this
year requested more proof from 9,041 operators of solar plants
and rooftop gear that they had completed all construction and
permitting by the September 2008 deadline. Spanish news reports
had suggested hundreds of entrepreneurs were illegally earning
the top subsidized rate, which was lowered after 2008.  Some 840 operators agreed not to challenge the regulator
and accept a lower subsidized price, of 32.6 cents a kilowatt-
hour, for the power they produced, in a form of amnesty
agreement that avoided them losing their entire subsidy payment.  That left 8,201 installations to be probed, and the
commission said it has completed 3,042 cases, or 37 percent.  The suspensions handed out so far are “precautionary”
until final judgments are made, the commission said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
