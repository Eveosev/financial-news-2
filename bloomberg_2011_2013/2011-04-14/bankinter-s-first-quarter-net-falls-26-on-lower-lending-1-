Bankinter SA (BKT) , a Spanish lender with
about two-thirds of its loan book in mortgages, said first-
quarter profit dropped 26 percent on lower lending revenue.  Net income fell to 48.6 million euros ($70.4 million) from
65.8 million euros a year earlier, the Madrid-based bank said in
a filing to regulators today. That beat the 32 million-euro
average estimate in a Bloomberg survey of 10 analysts.  Bankinter changed chief executive officer last October as
earnings plunged and announced the sale last month of as much as
406 million euros of bonds that convert to stock should the bank
fall short of minimum  capital requirements . Maria Dolores Dancausa, who replaced Jaime Echegoyen as CEO, said in January
the company aims to boost earnings by 20 percent this year.  Net interest income in the quarter fell 29 percent to 115
million euros from a year earlier, the bank said. It rose from
110.2 million euros in the fourth quarter, signaling that the
trend for revenue had “inverted,” Bankinter said.  Bad loans as a percentage of total lending was 2.97
percent, compared with 2.87 percent in December. The core
capital ratio was 8.4 percent, above the minimum 8 percent level
set by the government. The “peak” in non-performing loans is
“a couple of quarters away,” Chief Financial Officer Gloria Ortiz said on a webcast today.  The lender aims to deleverage over “the horizon of two
years,” seeking a deposit-to-loan ratio of about 60 percent,
Ortiz said. Bankinter has fully financed its debt maturities in
2011, she said.  Bankinter shares fell 0.9 percent to 5.28 euros at 11:30
a.m. in  Madrid , while the benchmark Ibex-35 index declined 0.7
percent to 10,714 points.  To contact the reporter on this story:
