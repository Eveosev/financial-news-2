Visa Inc. (V) , the world’s biggest
electronic payments network, will open an office in Kenya in
June.  The office will be responsible for operations in all East
African nations as well as English-speaking countries in sub-
Saharan  Africa , it said in an e-mailed statement yesterday.  “Kenya presents an opportunity for Visa to grow its
existing electronic payments business,” it said. “Visa also
sees an opportunity to broaden our existing range of products
and services as well as to address specific market needs.”  There are 2.96 million Visa-branded cards in the Kenyan
market. Transaction volumes climbed 24 percent to $4.1 billion
in 2010 compared with a year earlier, it said.  The company plans to grow the number of point-of-sale
terminals in  Kenya  threefold over the next three years, Gerald
Hawkins, group general manager for Africa, said April 12 in an
interview in Nairobi, the capital. Kenya currently has 9,000
terminals and 22 partner banks, Hawkins said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
