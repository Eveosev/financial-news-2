Cotton fell to a six-week low after
exports from the U.S., the world’s largest shipper, tumbled 72
percent.  Orange juice  gained.  U.S. cotton sales dropped to 69,498 bales in the week ended
April 7, from 251,501 bales a week earlier, as shipments
decreased to  China , Bangladesh and other Asian countries, the
Department of Agriculture said today. Prices have more than
doubled in the past 12 months as demand surged in China, the
biggest consumer.  “The numbers show that there has been some demand
destruction,” said Gary Raines, an economist at FCStone Fibers
& Textiles in Nashville,  Tennessee . “It will be a big cause of
concern if exports continue to dip over the next few weeks.”  Cotton futures for July delivery dropped 2.64 cents, or 1.5
percent, to settle at $1.78 a pound at 2:47 p.m. on ICE Futures
U.S. in  New York . The price earlier touched $1.7693, the lowest
since Feb. 25.  The fiber dropped 19 percent since reaching a record $2.197
on March 7.  Orange-juice futures for July delivery gained 2.8 cents, or
1.7 percent, to $1.662 a pound on ICE, gaining for the first
time in three days.  To contact the reporter on this story:
