BankMuscat SAOG (BKMB) , Oman’s biggest
bank by assets, said first-quarter profit rose 13 percent as a
better net interest margin boosted income from lending.  Net income rose to 27.8 million rials ($72 million) from
24.5 million rials a year earlier, according to a  statement 
posted on the Muscat bourse today. Analysts at EFG Hermes
Holding SAE had forecast a profit of 26 million rials.  Net interest income grew 21 percent to 53.7 million rials,
while provisions for bad loans rose 14 percent to 13.5 million
rials, the lender said today. The bank’s loan book expanded 4.1
percent from a year ago to 4.2 billion rials and customer
deposits grew 4.4 percent to 3.8 billion rials.  Bank Muscat’s shares closed unchanged 0.78 rials on the
Muscat bourse yesterday. The shares have fallen 6.8 percent this
year.  To contact the reporters on this story:
