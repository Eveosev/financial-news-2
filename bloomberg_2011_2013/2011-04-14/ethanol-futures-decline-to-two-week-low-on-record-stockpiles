Ethanol futures in  Chicago  declined
to a two-week low in Chicago a day after the Energy Department
reported record inventories of the fuel.  The gasoline additive slumped after stockpiles rose 2.3
percent to 20.5 million barrels last week. Ethanol is blended
with gasoline to stretch supply and meet federal mandates.  “There’s definitely some pressure in the front-month,”
said Jim Damask, a manager at Biofuelsconnect, a Heathrow,
Florida-based alternative energy broker. “There’s too much in
storage. A lot of tanks are full so people are selling the front
months, May and June, aggressively.”  Denatured ethanol for May delivery fell 1.9 cents, or 0.7
percent, to $2.639 a gallon on the Chicago Board of Trade.
Prices have risen 11 percent this year.  In cash market trading, ethanol in Chicago slumped 4.5
cents, or 1.7 percent, to $2.63 a gallon and in the U.S. Gulf
the additive lost 3.5 cents, or 1.3 percent, to $2.775,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Ethanol on the West Coast dipped 3 cents, or 1.1 percent,
to $2.795 a gallon and in  New York  the biofuel slid 2.5 cents,
or 0.9 percent, to $2.75.  To contact the reporter on this story:
