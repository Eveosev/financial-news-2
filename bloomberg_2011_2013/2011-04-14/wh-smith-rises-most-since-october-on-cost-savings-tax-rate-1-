WH Smith Plc (SMWH) , a U.K. magazine
retailer and stationer with more than 1,000 stores and travel
shops, jumped the most since October in London trading after it
identified more cost savings and said tax charges had declined.  Net income for the six months ended Feb. 28 rose 6.3
percent to 51 million pounds, or 35.2 pence a share, from 48
million pounds, or 31.6 pence, a year earlier, the Swindon,
England-based company said in a Regulatory News Service
statement today. Costs savings in its urban shops will be 3
million pounds more than expected, it said. Its effective  tax
rate  fell to 21 percent from 23 percent.  “The market was expecting full-year numbers to come
down,” Jonathan Pritchard, an analyst at Oriel Securities Ltd.
who rates the stock “buy”, said by phone today. “Actually the
numbers have gone up on the back of the interims.”  WH Smith improved its margins as sales declined on falling
consumer confidence in the face of the biggest government
spending cutbacks since World War II. Gross margins improved by
170 basis points from a year earlier. One basis point is 0.01
percentage point.  “We have delivered a good performance across the group,”
Chief Executive Officer Kate Swann said in the statement. “We
expect the economic environment to remain challenging and we
have planned accordingly.”  The shares rose as much as 11 percent and closed up 5.4
percent at 475.1 pence at 4:30 p.m. in  London  trading.  The interim dividend was increased 18 percent to 7.2 pence
a share.  To contact the reporter on this story:
