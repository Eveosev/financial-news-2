The yen strengthened against most
of its major counterparts as losses in Asian stocks spurred
demand for the relative safety of  Japan â€™s currency.  The yen climbed to 120.63 per euro as of 9:50 a.m. in  Tokyo 
from 121.08 yesterday in  New York . The euro fell 0.2 percent to
$1.4416.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
