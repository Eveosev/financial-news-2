San Diego  Mayor Jerry Sanders
proposed filling a $56.7 million fiscal 2012 deficit by cutting
in half the operating hours of libraries and recreation centers
in the nation’s eighth-largest city by population.  The budget restores fire services at stations that hadn’t
been fully staffed for 14 months, Sanders, 60, said in a
release. Recreation centers in the city of 1.3 million would
operate 20 hours a week starting in September, while branch
libraries would open two days a week and alternate Saturdays.  “Despite the tremendous challenges the city faces because
of reduced revenue, this budget responsibly addresses the
deficit without sacrificing public safety or our financial
stability,” Sanders said in a statement. The Republican is a
former San Diego police chief.  The plan calls for eliminating almost 249 full-time
equivalent jobs, 77 each from libraries and parks, reducing the
total by 2.4 percent to just below 10,000, according to
Sanders’s budget presentation. It projects a 0.9 percent
general-fund increase to $1.11 billion. Cuts would curb
municipal pool operations and eliminate swim teams, as well as
after-school programs at five recreation centers.  “Instead of giving taxpayers the reforms they deserve,
this budget takes a meat cleaver to their basic services,”
said Carl DeMaio, a Republican on the City Council. He urged the
council to reject the library and parks cuts, in a statement.
This week, San Diego approved labor contracts that contain
layers of “excessive management” that could be cut, he said.  The budget presentation projects a 2.3 percent drop in
property taxes to $380.9 million in the fiscal year that starts
in July compared with 2011. Receipts from sales levies are
forecast to jump almost 12 percent to $209.5 million. Revenue
from an occupancy tax on hotel rooms and franchise fees is
estimated at almost $141 million, up about 5.6 percent.  Sanders plans to pay for deferred maintenance expenses by
issuing $100 million in municipal bonds in fiscal 2012.  Editors: Ted Bunker, Mark Tannenbaum.  To contact the reporters on this story:
