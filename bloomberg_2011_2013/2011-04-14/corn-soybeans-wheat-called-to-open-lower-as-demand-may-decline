What follows are opening calls for
U.S. grain and oilseed markets.  -- Corn futures are called to open 5 cents to 7 cents a bushel
lower on the  Chicago  Board of Trade on speculation that demand
will slow as central banks from China to Europe raise interest
rates to fight inflation, said  Don Roose , the president of U.S.
Commodities Inc. in West Des Moines, Iowa.  -- Soybean futures may open 9 cents to 12 cents a bushel lower
in Chicago on speculation that U.S. exports will slow as output
rose from  South America  and higher interest rates limit demand
in China, the world’s biggest importer, Roose said. Soybean-oil
futures are expected to open 0.2 cent to 0.3 cent a pound lower,
and soybean-meal futures may open down $2 to $3 for 2,000 pounds
of the animal feed.  -- Wheat futures may open 12 cents to 14 cents a bushel lower on
the CBOT, the Kansas City Board of Trade and the  Minneapolis
Grain Exchange  as rising production from exporters Russia and
Ukraine erodes demand for higher-priced supply from the U.S.,
the world’s biggest seller, Roose said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
