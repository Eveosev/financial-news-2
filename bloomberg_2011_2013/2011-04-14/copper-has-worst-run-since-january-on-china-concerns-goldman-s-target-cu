Copper in  London  may drop for a
fourth day, the longest period of declines since January, on
concern that  China  may step up its credit-tightening measures to
cool asset prices.  Three-month-delivery copper on the London Metal Exchange
was little changed at $9,500 a metric ton at 2:31 p.m. Singapore
time, after falling as much as 0.6 percent earlier. The contract
dropped to $9,443 a ton yesterday, the lowest in a week. Zinc,
lead and tin gained.  “Higher prices hinge on China’s demand, which is unclear
at the moment,” said Yang Zhenqiang, an analyst at First
Futures Co. “We do see physical buyers emerge every time
there’s a decline, so that’s keeping the market supported.”  July-delivery copper on the Comex in  New York  gained 0.4
percent to $4.3315 a pound. The metal for June-delivery on the
Shanghai Futures Exchange dropped for a third day, declining as
much as 1.8 percent to 70,880 yuan ($10,848) a ton.  China is likely to raise banks’ reserve requirement ratios
in the “near future,” the China Securities Journal said in a
front-page commentary today. China has increased the ratio three
times this year as part of efforts to curb inflation. The
government is scheduled to release March inflation and first-
quarter economic growth data tomorrow.  Analysts’ Forecasts  The leaders of  Brazil , Russia,  India , China and  South
Africa , meeting in China, said rising commodities prices pose a
threat to global growth, according to a draft copy of the
communiqué given to Bloomberg News. Copper’s 30-day historical
volatility, a measure of how much the metal fluctuates, was at
26 percent today, the highest level since April 1.  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. lowered its year-end copper
forecast 11 percent on concern that weak Chinese demand and the
earthquake in  Japan  will delay an expected reduction in exchange
stockpiles. Copper may reach $9,800 a ton by the end of this
year, down from a previous forecast of $11,000, analysts Joshua
Crumb and  Allison Nathan  said in an April 12 report.  “The global copper market will show a small deficit this
year, even if Chinese demand does not grow at all,” Bank of
America Merrill Lynch strategist  Michael Widmer  wrote in a
report yesterday. “Reduced copper offtake from China will,
however, have a knock-on impact on 2012: if the country’s demand
increases by less than 2.5 percent in 2011, there is scope for
an oversupplied market next year.”  Zinc in London gained 0.8 percent to $2,440 a ton, lead
climbed 0.6 percent to $2,695 a ton, nickel increased 0.2
percent to $26,300 a ton and tin advanced 1.2 percent to $32,644
a ton. Aluminum was little changed at $2,664 a ton.  To contact the reporter on this story:
