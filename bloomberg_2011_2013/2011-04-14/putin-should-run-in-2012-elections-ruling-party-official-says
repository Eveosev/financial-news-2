Prime Minister  Vladimir Putin 
should run in next year’s presidential elections, according to a
senior member of  Russia ’s ruling party.  “As far as our position on the 2012 elections is concerned,
United Russia will focus on its leader, Vladimir Putin,” said
Yury Shuvalov, deputy head of the presidium of United Russia’s
general council, in  comments  posted today on the party website.
“We look at his candidacy as the priority for whom to put
forward from our party in the presidential elections.”  Putin, 58, a former KGB agent, became prime minister after
selecting  Dmitry Medvedev , 45, to succeed him as president in
2008 because of a constitutional ban on three consecutive terms.
With less than 12 months before the next presidential vote, it’s
unclear which of the men will run.  Putin said yesterday it’s too early to decide who will be
the candidate after Medvedev told Chinese state television that
he expected a speedy decision. Both men have said they may run
in the March 2012 election.  To contact the reporter on this story:
