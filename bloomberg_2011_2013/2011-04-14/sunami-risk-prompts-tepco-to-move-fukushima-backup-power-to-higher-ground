Tokyo  Electric Power Co. will move
emergency generators to higher ground to avoid further tsunamis
as it fights to stabilize the crippled Fukushima reactors amid
aftershocks that may continue for six months or more.  The diesel backup generators will be placed 20 meters (66
feet) above  sea level , double the current height, and be hooked
up to the cooling systems around April 19, the company said
yesterday. Aftershocks as big as magnitude-7 are likely to
continue striking the area, said Teruyuki Kato, a professor at
the University of Tokyo’s Earthquake Research Institute.  The emergency generators and cooling systems at the
Fukushima Dai-Ichi station were knocked out by a 15-meter surge
following a magnitude-9 earthquake on March 11, triggering the
worst nuclear disaster since Chernobyl in 1986. Work has been
hampered by hundreds of aftershocks, including one this week
that disabled power and cooling for almost an hour.  “The major problem is these aftershocks,” said Pierre
Zaleski, executive director at the Center for Geopolitics of
Energy and  Raw Materials  at the University Paris Dauphine. “You
never know if there are more aftershocks and containment may
fail -- maybe not completely -- but these structures have been
weakened.”  Tokyo Electric estimates the fight to stabilize the plant
will last through June, leaving them vulnerable to the continued
quakes and more radiation leaks, according to a person briefed
on the company’s plans.  Bad Publicity  Engineers at the utility rejected a proposal to flood the
reactors, which could lower temperatures in days rather than
months, according to the person, who asked not to be identified
because he isn’t authorized to speak to the media. Instead, the
utility is pumping in water and venting off steam, a method
called “feed and bleed.”  Tokyo Electric  is reluctant to flood the reactors because
the move might generate bad publicity, the person said. Flooding
would increase the amount of tainted water that gets into the
ocean and also raise the possibility of more hydrogen explosions
inside the containment vessels, the person said.  Tokyo Electric has poured millions of liters of water to
cool the reactors and spent fuel. Some highly contaminated water
leaked into the sea and the utility has dumped less toxic fluids
into the ocean.  Crews were still using temporary pumps for reactor cooling
April 13, and used a cement-pumping truck to spray water into a
damaged spent-fuel pool, the company, known as Tepco, said in a
 statement .  Strong Aftershocks  Four  temblors  stronger than magnitude-5 hit eastern Japan
yesterday, according to the  U.S. Geological Survey . Three
stronger than magnitude-7 have struck since the March 11
disaster, which left more than 28,000 people dead or missing.  Japan’s Nuclear and Industrial Safety Agency this week
raised the severity rating of the nuclear accident to 7, the
highest on the  International Nuclear and Radiological Event
Scale  and the same level as the Chernobyl disaster.  Tokyo Electric said it discovered uranium in soil sampled
at the power station. The levels of uranium-234, uranium-235 and
uranium-238 are almost identical to those found in nature, and
it is unlikely the uranium came from reactor fuel, Junichi
Matsumoto, a spokesman for Tokyo Electric, told reporters at a
news conference in Tokyo yesterday.  Representatives for farmers went to Tepco’s headquarters in
central Tokyo yesterday to deliver a letter of protest and
demand compensation from President Masataka Shimizu for losses
caused by the leakage of radiation.  After receiving the letter, Shimizu didn’t join talks with
the farmers, instead leaving managing director Naomi Hirose to
lead the discussions.  “We are disappointed that the Tepco president and chairman
weren’t in the room. We expect them to act with sincerity,”
Mamoru Moteki, the chairman of the Central Union of Agricultural
Co-operatives,  Japan ’s biggest farmers group, said during the
talks. “Words alone are not enough.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
