Japan  will send a team to the  Copa
America  soccer tournament in July, reversing a decision made
last week to withdraw as the country deals with the aftermath of
the March 11 earthquake and tsunami.  The Japan Football Association today decided to send a
squad of mostly Europe-based players to the South America
continental championship, according to a spokesman in  Tokyo  who
declined to be identified.  Japan and Mexico were invited to play as guest nations in
the 12-team tournament, to be held in Argentina from July 1 to
24. Asian champion Japan, ranked 13th in the world by soccer’s
governing body FIFA, last week pulled out of the event, citing
the disaster that left more than 28,000 people dead or missing
and damaged a nuclear power plant.  World champion Spain declined an offer to play in Japan’s
place because of scheduling issues, the Spanish soccer
federation said yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
