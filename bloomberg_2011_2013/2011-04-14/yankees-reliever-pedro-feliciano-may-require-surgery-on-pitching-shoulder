New York Yankees reliever Pedro Feliciano may need surgery after an MRI exam found damage in his
pitching shoulder, manager  Joe Girardi  said.  Feliciano, a 34-year-old left-hander, signed a two-year, $8
million contract with the Yankees during the offseason after
leading  Major League Baseball  in pitching appearances each of
the past three years with the  New York Mets . His 92 games last
season was tied for the  fourth-most  in history.  “He’s got a damaged shoulder,” Girardi told reporters
after last night’s game, without giving specifics about the
injury. “The MRI did not come back good. In fairness to the
player, he needs to talk about it with our doctors and the
agents and decide what the next course of action is.”  Yankees General Manager Brian Cashman told reporters on
April 2 that Feliciano’s workload with the Mets was “abusive.”
Mets pitching coach Dan Warthen said that Feliciano’s number of
appearances in recent years was a reason the team didn’t re-sign
him. Feliciano has said he doesn’t think the Mets are
responsible for his injury.  Without Feliciano, who hasn’t pitched since spring
training, Boone Logan is the lone left-hander in the Yankees’
bullpen. In his four appearances this season, Logan has allowed
three runs -- two earned -- and eight base runners over two
innings.  To contact the reporter on this story:
