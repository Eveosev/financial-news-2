Treasury Secretary  Timothy F. Geithner  said Congress needs to raise the debt limit within
weeks to prevent markets from losing confidence in the  U.S.
economy  and avert a crisis that “would shake the basic
foundation of the entire global financial system.”  “Starting at the end of May, we start to run on fumes,”
Geithner told the CBS Evening News today, according to excerpts
released by the network. “And that’s not something you want to
do for an economy that’s coming out of this severe a crisis.”  The Treasury Department has estimated that the debt limit
of $14.29 trillion will be reached May 16. Congressional action
is required to raise the cap, though the Treasury said it can
probably stave off default until early July.  Taking the debt limit “to the brink” would be “deeply
irresponsible,” Geithner said. “If you take it too far, people
will start to wonder whether we’re going to make it.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
