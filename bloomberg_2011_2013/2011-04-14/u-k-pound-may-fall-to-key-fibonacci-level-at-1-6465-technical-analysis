The pound may weaken to as low as
$1.5888 should it a fail to breach a key resistance level,
Commerzbank AG said, citing technical indicators.  “The market continues to struggle with key resistance at
$1.6425/65,”  Karen Jones , head of fixed-income, commodity and
currency technical analysis in  London , wrote in an e-mailed
report today. “This is a double Fibonacci retracement level and
the 2010 high.”  Fibonacci analysis is based on the theory that prices rise
or fall by certain percentages after reaching a high or low.  “We allow for dips back into the recent range to $1.6180
and possibly the base of the range at $1.5963/$1.5888,” she
wrote. Those levels represent the low from Feb. 11 and the
uptrend support line from May 2010, Jones said in a telephone
interview.  The pound strengthened 0.3 percent to $1.6317 as of
10:43 a.m. in London. It rose as high as $1.6428 on April 8, the
most since Jan. 19, 2010.  “We maintain our bearish bias longer term while resistance
at $1.6465 holds,” Jones said. “A break above $1.6465 would
negate this view as this would introduce scope to $1.6880, the
November 2009 high.”  In  technical analysis , investors and analysts study charts
of trading patterns to forecast changes in a security,
commodity, currency or index. Resistance is a level where sell
orders may be clustered, and so-called support is where buy
orders may be grouped.  To contact the reporter on this story:
