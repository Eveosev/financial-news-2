Renewable Energy Corp. ASA, a
Norwegian maker of solar-energy materials, said it sold 500
million kroner ($92 million) of five-year bonds and 700 million
kroner of seven-year bonds in an “oversubscribed” offer.  As part of the deal, the company offered to buy back
existing bonds and has acquired 600 million kroner of its REC01
issue, Oslo-based REC said today in a filing.  The net proceeds will be used for general corporate
