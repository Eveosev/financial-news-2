 U.S. stocks pared losses as gains
in energy and consumer-staples companies helped the market
recover from an early slump triggered by an unexpected increase
in jobless claims.  The Standard & Poorâ€™s 500 Index slipped less than 0.1
percent to 1,313.33 at 1:05 p.m. in  New York  after slumping as
much as 0.9 percent earlier. The  Dow Jones Industrial Average 
rose less than 1 point to 12,271.45 after sinking 107 points.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
