Brazil ’s central bank has been
encouraging large banks to acquire small and medium-sized
financial institutions that are facing capital needs and
recurrent losses, Valor Economico newspaper reported, without
saying how it obtained the information.  Banks in a “more comfortable situation” are being
encouraged to use resources from the deposit insurance fund,
known as FGC, to buy other banks, the Sao Paulo-based newspaper
said. Resources from the fund used to acquire another
institution are registered as capital on the purchaser’s balance
sheet, helping boost lending capacity, Valor said.  The central bank declined to comment, according to an
official who asked not to be named under the bank’s policies.  To contact the reporter on this story:
