The Chinese coal carrier Shen Neng
1, which ran aground on the Douglas Shoal off the Queensland
coast on April 3 last year, lacked an effective fatigue
management system, the  Australian Transport Safety Bureau  said
in a report.  The ship’s chief mate was affected by fatigue and this
resulted in a decreased level of performance while he was
monitoring the Sheng Neng 1’s position, the bureau said in a
final report on the accident released today.  The Chinese vessel didn’t have a system that ensured the
watchkeeper was fit to stand a navigational watch when the
accident took place near the port of Gladstone, it said.  “Fatigue is one of the key safety risks facing seafarers,
and watchkeepers in particular,” bureau Chief Commissioner
Martin Dolan said. “Failure to manage fatigue can lead to loss
of life, damage to property and damage to the environment.”  Ship operators need to ensure they have an appropriate
process in place to properly manage the level of crew fatigue,
the bureau advised in its final investigation report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
