Shareholders of  Orascom Telecom
Holding SAE (ORTE) , North Africa’s biggest mobile-network operator,
approved all measures recommended by the company’s board to
complete a merger with Russia’s  VimpelCom Ltd. (VIP)   The shareholders voted to restructure the company’s debt,
raise its capital to 14 billion Egyptian pounds ($2.4 billion)
from 7.5 billion pounds and set up a new company to hold the
assets to be merged with VimpelCom, Manal Abdel Hamid,
spokeswoman for Orascom said in a telephone interview.  VimpelCom’s investors voted in March to issue new stock to
be bought by Orascom’s parent company, Wind Telecom SpA, to
complete a $6.5 billion transaction that would create the
world’s sixth-biggest mobile network operator, over the
objection of VimpelCom’s largest shareholder,  Telenor ASA. (TEL)   Orascom’s shares gained 0.9 percent to 4.44 pounds at the
2:30 p.m. close in Cairo, valuing the company at 23.3 billion
pounds.  To contact the reporter on this story:
