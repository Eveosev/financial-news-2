(Corrects number of barrels in third paragraph.)  The Lula oil field offshore  Brazil 
may hold 6.7 billion barrels of oil, with 200 million barrels of
reserves outside an exploration block, O Estado de S. Paulo
reported, without saying where it got the information.  Brazil’s oil regulator has asked state-controlled  Petroleo
Brasileiro SA (PETR4)  to start a so-called unitization process to
determine how far the Lula field extends beyond the contract of
the block, BM-S-11, Sao-Paulo-based Estado said today.  Petrobras, as the Rio de Janeiro-based producer is known,
estimates Lula’s oil reserves at 6.5 billion barrels.  To contact the reporter on this story:
