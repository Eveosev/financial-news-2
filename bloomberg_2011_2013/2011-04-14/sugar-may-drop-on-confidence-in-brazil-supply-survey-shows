Sugar may fall next week on bets
that supply will rise in  Brazil , the world’s biggest producer.  Twelve of 16 traders, analysts and brokers surveyed by
Bloomberg News said that raw sugar traded in New York will
decline, while four said prices will gain. Before today, the
commodity fell 7.3 percent this week to 23.06 cents a pound.  Eleven respondents said refined sugar on  London ’s NYSE
Liffe exchange will slump, four said it will rise, and one said
it would be little changed. Through yesterday, the price slid 2
percent this week to $638.40 per metric ton.  Refined sugar’s premium over raw sweetener may widen next
week, according to 11 respondents. Three said the spread would
narrow, and two forecast little change.  To contact the reporters on this story:
