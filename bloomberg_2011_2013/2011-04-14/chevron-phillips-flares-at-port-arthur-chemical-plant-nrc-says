Chevron Phillips Chemical Co.
released gases at its chemical plant in  Port Arthur , Texas,
according to a filing with the U.S. National Response Center.  The flaring of benzene, nitric oxide and nitrogen dioxide
occurred at 3:40 p.m. local time yesterday, according to an
incident  report  on the National Response Center website.  U.S. refineries and chemical plants must notify the
National Response Center if they release hazardous substance in
excess of reportable quantities, according to the Comprehensive
Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act,
commonly known as Superfund.  Bloomberg News could not immediately verify whether the
information in the filing was accurate.  Chevron Phillips Chemical was preparing to restart an
ethylene unit at the plant after planned maintenance, the
Woodlands, Texas-based company said in a regulatory  filing  with
the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality yesterday.  Chevron Corp. (CVX)  and  ConocoPhillips (COP)  each own half of Chevron
Phillips Chemical, according to the companyâ€™s  website.   To contact the reporter on this story:
