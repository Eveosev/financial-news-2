Czech stocks fell to the lowest in
three weeks as concern Greece will have to restructure its debt
hurt demand for riskier assets and Czech power utility  CEZ AS (CEZ) 
shut down a nuclear reactor for unplanned repairs.  The PX gauge of 15 companies fell 1.2 percent to 1,235.2,
its lowest close since March 23. CEZ fell 1.7 percent to 879.5
koruna, its biggest drop in 1 1/2 months.  Bonds of Europe’s most-indebted nations fell after  Standard
& Poor’s  said holders of Greek government securities may see a
50 percent to 70 percent “haircut” and the European Central
Bank’s Axel Weber said higher  interest rates  may be needed.
Stocks dropped as U.S. jobless claims unexpectedly increased.  ECM Real Estate Investments AG (ECM)  fell for a fourth day after
the Czech property developer said its loss widened last year and
the management is discussing ways to reorganize its debt. The
stock slid as much as 20 percent and closed down 17 percent at
50 koruna, its lowest level on record.  Erste Group Bank AG (RBAG) , an Austrian lender with an 18 percent
weighting in the PX index, declined 1.8 percent to 864 koruna.  To contact the reporter on this story:
