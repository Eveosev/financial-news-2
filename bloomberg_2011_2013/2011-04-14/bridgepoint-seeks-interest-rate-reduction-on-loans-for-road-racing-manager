Bridgepoint asked lenders to accept
lower interest on a loan its marketing for the manager of the
MotoGP motorcycling championship, a person with knowledge of the
negotiations said.  The U.K. buyout firm asked funds investing in seven-year
term loans to Dorna Sports SL for a 75 basis-point reduction in
the interest margin to 425 basis points, said the person, who
declined to be identified because the terms are private. It
proposed banks cut the margin on a six-year  term loan  and
revolving credit by 25 basis points, also to 425 basis points.  James Murray, a spokesman for London-based Bridgepoint,
declined to comment.  Societe Generale SA, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and ING Groep
NV are arranging the deal, which will include 360 million euros
of term loans, $70 million of second-lien debt, and a 10
million-euro revolving  credit line , according to data compiled
by Bloomberg.  Bridgepoint bought a controlling stake in Madrid-based
Dorna in 2006 from CVC Capital Partners Ltd. using $445 million
of loans maturing between 2013 and 2016, the data show.  Dorna, founded in 1988, has been the exclusive commercial
and television rights holder for the FIM Road Racing World
Championship Grand Prix, known as MotoGP, since 1992. The
company also markets Ad-Time, a rotating advertising board
system, in  Spain ,  Italy ,  Portugal , the U.K.,  South America  and
 Japan , according to its  website.   The margins are set over interbank lending rates in euros
and dollars. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  Details of the refinancing are as follows:  To contact the reporter on this story:
