Eskom Holdings Ltd., the state-
owned South African power utility, may face a strike if it
doesn’t sign a minimum service level agreement, the  National
Union of Mineworkers  said.  The agreement will “allow a certain number of Eskom
workers to go on strike should there be any labor disagreement
on wages,” NUM said in an e-mailed statement today.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
