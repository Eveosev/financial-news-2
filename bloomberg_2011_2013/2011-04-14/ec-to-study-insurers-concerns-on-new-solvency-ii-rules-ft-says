The European Commission has agreed
to set up working parties to examine areas within new capital
rules, the so-called Solvency II rules, that are causing concern
to the  insurance industry  and that are due to come into force in
2013, the FT reported, without saying where it got the
information. The move comes in response to a letter of protest
sent by four industry organizations to the European Union
Financial Services Commissioner  Michel Barnier , requesting
alterations to rules the industry saw as too conservative, the
FT said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
