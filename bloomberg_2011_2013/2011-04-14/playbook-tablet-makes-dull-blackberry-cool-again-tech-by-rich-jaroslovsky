This isn’t quite hell freezing
over, but it’s close: The makers of the  BlackBerry  have come out
with something you might love.  It’s the  PlayBook  tablet, and for  Research In Motion Ltd. (RIM) 
the stakes could hardly be greater. With market share for its
pioneering smartphones falling, the company desperately needs
the PlayBook to be a success. And it deserves to be, once the
software catches up to the hardware.  The PlayBook, which arrives in stores April 19, is
initially available only with a Wi-Fi connection. It’s priced
the same as the Wi-Fi-only models of  Apple Inc. (AAPL) ’s iPad 2: $499
for 16 gigabytes of storage; $599 for 32 GB and $699 for 64 GB.  It really, though, shouldn’t be compared to the iPad,
whose bigger screen makes it better for watching movies and Web-
surfing, but is also 40 percent heavier.  The PlayBook’s true competitors are the likes of Samsung
Electronics Co.’s Galaxy Tab and  Dell Inc. (DELL) ’s Streak 7, in a
category that might be considered pocket-sized as long as you’ve
got good-sized pockets. In that realm, the BlackBerry instantly
raises the bar.  Like those competitors, the PlayBook is compact enough to
be held in one hand. It’s roughly the size of a half-sheet of
paper and weighs about 15 ounces. Along its top edge are a too-
small power button and media-playback controls; the bottom
includes a micro-USB connection and an HDMI video port.  Full HD  The beautiful display measures seven inches diagonally with
a 1024 x 600 resolution, the same as the Galaxy Tab and much
better than the Streak. Unlike the iPad 2, the PlayBook runs
videos that use  Adobe Systems Inc. (ADBE) ’s Flash technology. Its
cameras are also better than the iPad’s: three megapixels facing
front and five megapixels facing rear, and it’s capable of
capturing video in full high-definition.  RIM says it expects the PlayBook battery to provide eight
to 10 hours of use, which seems about right based on my
experience. After two days of using it for a variety of tasks,
including Web surfing, watching YouTube videos and editing
documents using the included  Docs to Go  suite of Microsoft
Office-compatible productivity apps, I had plenty of juice left.  While the Galaxy and Streak use a version of  Google Inc. (GOOG) ’s
 Android  software that was designed for mobile phones, the
PlayBook uses a new operating system called the BlackBerry
Tablet OS. It’s fast and easy -- once I got used to the unusual
fact that the border as well as the screen is touch-sensitive.
You navigate by starting with your finger on the frame and then
swiping it across the viewing area. Open apps can be dismissed
from the screen with an oddly satisfying flick gesture.  Multitasking  The new operating system is strong on multitasking. If
you’re watching a video and bring up the PlayBook’s desktop, the
video continues in a smaller window. Connect it to a high-
definition TV or projector and you can continue to access the
Internet or files on the tablet while your content plays
uninterrupted on the big screen.  The main drawback is that the PlayBook feels unfinished.
That’s because it is: A number of critical features and
applications, while promised, aren’t yet available.  For starters, there’s currently no software for accessing
all your e-mail, calendars or contacts in one place. RIM says it
will be available in the summer; in the meantime you can expect
to be doing a lot of logging into websites to access your
personal information.  BlackBerry Bridge  The exception is if you already have a BlackBerry: A
program called Bridge will let you wirelessly view your e-mail,
calendars and other data on the PlayBook’s larger screen and
share the phone’s wireless data plan between the devices.  Perhaps the most important missing feature, which won’t
show up until later in the year, is software that RIM says will
allow the PlayBook to run a limited selection from the vast
universe of Android wireless-phone applications. The mobile
marketplace is increasingly a battle of app-fueled ecosystems,
and while RIM says the PlayBook is launching with about 3,000
apps, offering Android compatibility hedges the risk that
developers won’t continue to write for it if the tablet isn’t an
immediate hit.  No one knows how well the emulation software will work; the
company didn’t make it available for preview. And there will be
strings attached: Only Android apps that RIM clears will work on
the PlayBook, and they will be available only through
BlackBerry’s  App World  store. PlayBook users won’t be able to
access Google’s thriving  Android Market .  Also yet to come are models that work over wireless  data
networks . A version for  Sprint Nextel Corp. (S) ’s WiMax 4G network
is promised for the summer, with ones for the 4G technologies
used by  Verizon Wireless  and  AT&T Inc. (T)  in the second half of the
year.  It’s impossible to say whether RIM’s bet-the-company
strategy will pay off. Still, who would have thought that the
maker of some of the world’s least exciting smartphones would
have produced a product this slick? The PlayBook makes
BlackBerry relevant again.  ( Rich Jaroslovsky  is a Bloomberg News columnist. The
