Federal Reserve Bank of
Philadelphia President  Charles Plosser  said the Fed may need to
begin its exit from record monetary stimulus as soon as this
year should forecasts on economic growth prove to be accurate.  “If you took most economists’ forecasts looking through
the end of this year and into next year,” and “if that turns
out to be the right forecast,” then the Fed “would have to
act,” Plosser said. Such a policy move may come this year, he
said.  Plosser, 62, spoke to reporters at the annual Hyman P. Minsky conference in  New York , organized by the Levy Economics
Institute of Bard College.  To contact the reporters on this story:
