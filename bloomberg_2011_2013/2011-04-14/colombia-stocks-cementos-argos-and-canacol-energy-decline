The following companies are having
unusual price changes in Bogota trading. Stock symbols are in
parentheses and prices are as of 11:37 a.m. New York time.  The IGBC Index fell 1 percent to 14,123.21, while the
Colcap Index dropped 0.7 percent to 1,670.57.  Cementos Argos (CEMARGOS CB) declined 0.2 percent to 10,480
pesos as investors expect heavy rains could slow construction,
said  Andres Jimenez , an analyst at Interbolsa SA. Colombia’s
disaster prevention agency released an  alert  on its website
yesterday warning of the possibility of landslides and floods in
seven areas.  Canacol Energy Ltd (CNEC CB), the Calgary-based  oil company 
that operates fields in  South America , dropped 3.8 percent to
2,435 pesos.  “It was a matter of time before we saw the fall on the
stock,” Jimenez said. “The petroleum story has not been that
sexy, and what you’re encountering is there are better
alternatives than Canacol at these prices.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
