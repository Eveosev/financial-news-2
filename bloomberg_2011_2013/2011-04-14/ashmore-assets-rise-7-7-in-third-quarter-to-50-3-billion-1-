Ashmore Group Plc (ASHM) , a U.K. fund
manager focusing on emerging markets, said assets under
management increased 7.7 percent in the fiscal third quarter to
$50.3 billion as clients added cash and markets rose.  Net inflows in the period added $2.3 billion to funds under
management and $1.3 billion came from  investment performance ,
the London-based company said in a Regulatory News Service
statement today.  “Trading conditions are in line with management
expectations and the group remains confident of its prospects
for the current year,” Ashmore said in the statement.  Ashmore expects to complete the acquisition of a 63 percent
stake in Arlington, Virginia-based Emerging Markets Management
LLC on May 31, it said in the statement. Ashmore agreed Feb. 24
to pay as much as $246 million for the majority stake in EMM,
which oversaw $10.4 billion at the end of January.  To contact the reporter on this story:
