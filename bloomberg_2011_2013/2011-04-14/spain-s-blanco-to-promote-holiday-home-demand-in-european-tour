Spain ’s Development Minister Jose Blanco will visit five European countries to promote Spanish
holiday homes, attracting buyers for the nation’s estimated
1 million unsold homes.  Blanco will start his tour in  London  on May 4, and travel
to  France ,  Germany ,  Switzerland  and the Netherlands in the
following weeks to encourage sales of existing Spanish holiday
homes and inform investors of the “strength” of the country’s
economy and “transparency” of its housing market, according to
an e-mailed statement from the Ministry of Development. Blanco
later plans to visit  Russia , the ministry said.  European investors have fled the market after Spanish
developers built about 100,000 illegal homes during the nation’s
real estate boom, many of which now are threatened with
demolition as regional governments try to deter clandestine
construction.  To contact the reporter on this story:
