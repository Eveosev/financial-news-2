888 Holdings Plc (888) ’s former chief
executive officer Gigi Levy, who is still a director, said a
takeover by U.K. bookmaker  Ladbrokes Plc (LAD)  is “still a
possibility” though the price is an issue.  Levy said the Gibraltar-based online gambling company is in
talks for debt funding to give it more flexibility in entering
regulated markets. 888’sFirst-quarter revenue rose 9 percent to
$75 million, led by bingo, the company said in a statement.  Analysts, including  Nick Batram  of Peel Hunt, say 888’s
share price may be difficult to sustain without a bid from
Ladbrokes. In December, 888 said it was in the “early stages”
of talks with Ladbrokes, which is trying to accelerate growth in
 Internet gambling .  “The situation with Ladbrokes is dragging on, doing
neither side any favors,” Batram wrote. “In the absence of a
bid, we continue to have fundamental concerns about the
business.” He cited concerns about “positioning, scale and
management of the business” in maintaining his “sell”
recommendation.  Analyst Michael Campbell of Daniel Stewart, said 888 needed
to raise cash for further payments for Wink Bingo, which it
acquired in December 2009 for a price based on future earnings.  “On this basis, we believe any buyer of the company will
demand a knock-down price for the business,” he wrote. He also
has a “sell” recommendation on 888.  ‘No Pressure’  Levy said the company is under “no pressure” to raise
funds, though it is looking to raise cash to enter  Greece ,  Spain 
and the Italian web-casino market. Levy, who stepped down as
chief executive officer on April 10, remains a director and
consultant.  He wouldn’t give the amount 888 is seeking, nor would he
name the parties involved. He said he didn’t leave over
disagreements with the founding Shaked and Yitzhak families,
which together control 60 percent of the shares.  “I’m not saying there were no differences, there are
always differences in a boardroom, but there were no big
differences,” he said in a telephone interview.  888 rose 1 penny, or 2.3 percent, to 43.75 pence at 10:51
a.m. in London. The shares have fallen 20 percent so far this
year, giving the company a market value of 151 million pounds
($246 million).  The number of casino, poker and sports customer accounts
rose 21 percent to 9.2 million since March 2010, 888 said today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
