U.S. Gulf crudes weakened as Brent
oil’s premium over U.S. benchmark West Texas Intermediate
narrowed for the first time in five days.  The gap between May-delivery WTI and its European
counterpart decreased $1.25 to $14.52 a barrel at 1:41 p.m. in
 New York . The differential for the contract nearest to
expiration reached a record $15.94 on Feb. 16.  When Brent falls versus WTI, it weakens the value of low-
sulfur U.S. grades that compete with West African oil priced
against the European grade.  Light Louisiana Sweet’s premium weakened 55 cents to $17.70
a barrel over the benchmark at 1:21 p.m. in New York, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg. Heavy Louisiana Sweet’s premium
was unchanged at $17.75 a barrel.  Among  Gulf Coast  sour, or high-sulfur, grades, Mars Blend
weakened 60 cents to $10.90 a barrel over WTI, and Poseidon’s
premium lost 45 cents to $11.30.  Southern Green Canyon’s premium weakened $1 to $9.50 a
barrel. Thunder Horse slipped 25 cents to $14.90 over WTI.  West  Texas  Sour’s discount was unchanged at $3.40 a barrel.
It has tracked more closely to its historical average discount
versus WTI because it’s delivered in Midland, Texas, away from
the Gulf Coast and close to Cushing,  Oklahoma , the delivery
point for oil traded on the  New York Mercantile Exchange .  The premium for Syncrude gained 30 cents to $12.60 a
barrel. Syncrude is a light, low-sulfur synthetic oil derived
from the  tar sands  in Alberta.  The discount for Western Canada Select was unchanged at
$15.75 a barrel.  To contact the reporter on this story:
