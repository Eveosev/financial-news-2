Namakwa Diamonds Ltd. (NAD) , a miner of
the gems in southern  Africa , said production more than doubled
during the first half as demand and prices increased.  The company, which has operations in  South Africa , Lesotho
and the Democratic Republic of Congo, produced 86,885 carats
during the six months to Feb. 28, up from 41,109 carats a year
earlier, it said in a statement today. Revenue rose to $45.4
million from $33.9 million, while the miner’s net loss was
largely unchanged at $11.9 million, it said.  Namakwa’s trading division saw “significant increases” in
prices for rough, or unpolished gems, while the polished market
showed “moderate signs of recovery,” the company said.  Alrosa and  De Beers , the world’s two largest diamond
producers in carat terms, are boosting output to take advantage
of prices that returned to levels last seen in June 2008, before
the global credit crunch forced buyers to cut stocks. Demand may
climb 8 percent this year, after rising 6.5 percent in 2010,
Chaim Even-Zohar, head of industry group Tacy Ltd., said on
April 4.  Namakwa, based in Johannesburg, maintained its output
targets of 200,000 carats this year from Congo and 55,000 carats
to 65,000 carats from South Africa, it said.  Shares in the company gained 0.9 percent to 55 pence as of
8:35 a.m. in  London , extending the advance so far this year to
10 percent and giving the company a market value of 119.4
million pounds ($195.2 million.)  To contact the reporter on this story:
