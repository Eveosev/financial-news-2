Gulf Coast gasoline weakened after
 Valero Energy Corp. (VLO)  started a crude unit at its refinery in  Port
Arthur , Texas.  The unit restarted yesterday and is increasing to planned
rates,  Bill Day , a company spokesman, said in an e-mail. A small
fire April 7 caused an emergency shutdown, according to a filing
with state regulators.  The discount for conventional, 87-octane gasoline in the
Gulf Coast widened 1.38 cents to 12.88 cents a gallon versus
futures traded on the  New York Mercantile Exchange  at 4:07 p.m.,
the lowest level since March 23, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. Prompt delivery slipped 2.14 cents to $3.106 a
gallon.  The refinery can process 310,000 barrels of crude a day,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The premium for reformulated, 87-octane gasoline in New
York Harbor gained 0.18 cent to 1.18 cents a gallon versus
futures traded on the New York Mercantile Exchange at 2:31 p.m.
Prompt delivery fell 0.59 cent to $3.2465 a gallon.  The fuel gained after  Sunoco Inc. (SUN)  shut a gasoline-making
fluid catalytic cracker in the Girard Point section of its
Philadelphia refinery following a fire late yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
