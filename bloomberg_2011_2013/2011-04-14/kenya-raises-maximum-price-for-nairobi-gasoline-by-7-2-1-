Kenya raised the maximum retail
price for gasoline in Nairobi, the capital, by 7.2 percent to
108.16 shillings per liter ($1.29), the  Energy Regulatory
Commission  said.  The new rate takes effect tomorrow and will last until May
14, the agency said in an e-mailed statement today. Nairobi
accounts for as much as 55 percent of total fuel consumption in
the East African country.  Unrest in the Middle East and North Africa, along with
demand for fuels in the growing economies of India and  China ,
are pushing global  oil prices  higher, Kaburu Mwirichia, director
general of the commission, said in the statement.  The  Central Bank of Kenya  unexpectedly increased its
benchmark interest rate in March to ease pressure on prices.
Inflation accelerated for the fifth consecutive month in March,
climbing to 9.19 percent from 6.5 percent in February. The
governmentâ€™s target is 5 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
