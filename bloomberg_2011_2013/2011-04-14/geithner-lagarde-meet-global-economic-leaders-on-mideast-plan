U.S. Treasury Secretary  Timothy F. Geithner  and French Finance Minister  Christine Lagarde  met with
other global economic officials and heads of financial
institutions to discuss how to help Middle East and North
African countries.  Multilateral development institutions, along with the
Islamic Development Bank, “will partner to develop a joint
action plan for aligning their investments toward a new vision
to support the aspirations of citizens for inclusive and
sustained growth, transparency and improved governance,” the
Treasury Department said in a statement today.  Recommendations will be made by the end of May, the
Treasury said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
