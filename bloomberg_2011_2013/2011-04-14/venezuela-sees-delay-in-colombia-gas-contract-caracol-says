Venezuela  wonâ€™t be able to fulfill
an agreement to supply  Colombia  with natural gas in 2012,
broadcaster  Radio Caracol  said on its website, citing Colombian
Mines and Energy Minister Carlos Rodado.  Venezuela has asked for more time to export the fuel as
part of an accord with Petroleos de Venezuela SA, Bogota-based
Caracol said today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
