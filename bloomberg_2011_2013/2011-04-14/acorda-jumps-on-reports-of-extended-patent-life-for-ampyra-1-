Acorda Therapeutics Inc. (ACOR)  gained the
most in 18 months in  Nasdaq  trading on reports the biotechnology
company may receive additional patent protection for its top-
selling drug, an RBC Capital Markets analyst said.  Trading was halted at 1:58 p.m. Acorda rose $5.71, or 27
percent, to $27.13, and trading remained stopped as of the 4
p.m. close of the Nasdaq Stock Market. The increase is the
biggest since Oct. 15, 2009. Shares of the Hawthorne,  New York- 
based company are down 28 percent in the last 12 months.  Acorda’s top seller is the multiple sclerosis medicine
Ampyra, approved in January 2010 in the U.S. to improve walking.
The drug generated revenue last year of $133.1 million. An
update of the company’s application with the U.S. Patent and
Trademark Office indicates the medicine may receive extended
patent protection, RBC’s  Michael Yee  wrote today in a note to
clients.  Intellectual property “extension would be a significant
catalyst for the shares and would make Acorda much more amenable
to be an acquisition target,” Yee wrote.  Jeff Macdonald, a spokesman for Acorda, said the company
had seen the update and wouldn’t comment further. The trading
halt was done by Nasdaq, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
