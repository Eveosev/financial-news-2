Itau Unibanco Holding SA (ITUB4) , the
biggest Brazilian bank by market value, agreed to pay 725
million reais ($459 million) for a 49 percent stake in Banco CSF
SA,  Carrefour SA (CA) ’s financial unit in Brazil.  The deal gives Sao Paulo-based Itau, which already provides
credit to customers of  Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (WMT)  and  Cia Brasileira
de Distribuicao Grupo Pao de Acucar (PCAR5) , access to Carrefour
clients, said Luis Miguel Santacreu, an analyst at Austin
Rating.  “Itau’s strategy is to go after consumers at the stores,
people whose shopping and spending habits have already been
mapped out by Brazil’s large retailers,” Santacreu said in a
phone interview today. “Carrefour will add a large potential
client base.”  The fastest economic expansion in more than two decades,
fueled by record surges in credit and employment, is prompting
banks to offer more financial services in  Brazil . The nation’s
economy grew by 7.5 percent last year and may expand 4 percent
in 2011, according to the quarterly inflation report published
March 30 by Brazil’s central bank.  Carrefour, the world’s second-largest retailer, expects
the transaction to “strongly enhance the competitiveness” of
its 114 hypermarkets in Brazil, the Boulogne-Billancourt,
France-based company said today in a statement.  Itau dropped 1 percent to 36.84 reais at 4:07 p.m. in  New
York . Carrefour declined 1.3 percent to 31.04 euros in Paris
trading today.  Outstanding Credit  Total outstanding credit in Brazil rose 1.3 percent to 1.74
trillion reais in February, compared with a 0.6 percent increase
in January. Total credit advanced 21 percent from a year ago,
according to central bank data published on March 29.  The deal, subject to approval by Brazil’s central bank, is
expected to be completed by yearend, Carrefour said in the
statement.  Banco Santander SA’s Brazilian unit and  Banco do
Brasil SA (BBAS3)  also had been interested in acquiring a 49 percent
stake in Carrefour’s financial unit in Brazil, O Estado de S.
