European Union Economic and
Monetary Affairs Commissioner  Olli Rehn  said a debt
restructuring in the euro area would cause a “chain reaction”
in the banking industry and he ruled out such an operation for
Greece.  “We see that in a still-fragile situation in the European
economy there is a risk that debt restructuring would cause a
chain reaction through the banking sector,” Rehn said today at
an event in Washington. “That would have a serious negative
impact” on lending and negative ramifications for households
and citizens and could endanger the recovery, he said.  “Nobody should underestimate the risk of contagion to
other sovereigns,” Rehn said.  “I’m aware of the public debate and recent statements as
regards the debt sustainability of  Greece ,” Rehn said. “We do
not see debt restructuring as an option.”  The euro area has managed to “contain” the sovereign-debt
crisis, Rehn said, adding that critics were “wrong to predict a
failure or the breakup” of the euro. The currency bloc will
“come out of this crisis stronger than before,” he said.  “The euro is not on the list of problems,” Rehn said.
“Instead, it’s an essential part of the solution.”  Rehn said he is “quite confident” the financial-aid package
being negotiated for  Portugal  will result in the debt crisis
being “ring-fenced.” The package for Portugal should be in place
“in a matter of weeks.”  He also said he is “confident Ireland will be able to
overcome its challenges.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
