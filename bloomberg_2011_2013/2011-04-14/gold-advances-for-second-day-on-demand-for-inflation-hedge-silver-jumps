Gold rose the most in a week on
speculation that higher raw-material costs and record-low
 interest rates  will spur demand for an inflation hedge. Silver
had the biggest gain this year.  U.S. wholesale costs increased 0.7 percent in March, led by
surging energy, the government said. Compared with a year
earlier, prices climbed 5.8 percent. Gold has gained 27 percent
in the past year, reaching a record $1,478 an ounce on April 11.  “We are seeing increasing inflationary expectations, and
investors are putting on hedges,” said  Matthew Zeman , a
strategist at Kingsview Financial in Chicago. “Gold is catching
a nice bid.”  Gold futures for June delivery rose $16.80, or 1.2 percent,
to settle at $1,472.40 at 1:42 p.m. on the Comex in  New York ,
the biggest gain for a most-active contract since April 5.  Silver futures for May delivery rose $1.427, or 3.5
percent, to $41.664 an ounce. The gain was the biggest since
Dec. 28. On April 11, the price reached $41.975, the highest
since 1980. In that year, the metal reached a record $50.35.  Palladium futures for June delivery gained $8.95, or 1.2
percent, to $774.25 an ounce on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange .  Platinum futures for July delivery climbed $18.40, or 1
percent, to $1,795.60 an ounce.  To contact the reporter on this story:
