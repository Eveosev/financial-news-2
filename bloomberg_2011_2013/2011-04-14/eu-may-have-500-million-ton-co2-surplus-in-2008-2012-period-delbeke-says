The European Union’s emissions
trading system may have a surplus of 500 million metric tons in
the current trading period from 2008 to 2012, said  Jos Delbeke ,
director general for climate at the European Commission.  Creating a gradually built set-aside from the pool of
allowances to be auctioned between 2013 and 2020 would help
improve the system, he told a conference in Brussels today.  “The set-aside is on the table of ministers,” Delbeke
said. “If there’s not an agreement we will continue with the
system as it is.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
