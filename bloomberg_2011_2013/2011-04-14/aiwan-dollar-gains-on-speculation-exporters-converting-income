Taiwan ’s dollar strengthened for a
second day on speculation exporters were repatriating income to
take advantage of recent declines in the currency, which
yesterday hit a one-week low.  Government bonds  declined.  Taiwan’s dollar climbed 0.2 percent against its U.S.
counterpart to close at NT$29.041, according to Taipei Forex Inc.
It touched NT$29.194 yesterday, the weakest level since April 6.  “You have these export earnings being converted into
Taiwan dollars,” said Suan Teck Kin, an economist at United
Overseas Bank Ltd. in Singapore.  Overseas sales rose more than economists estimated in March.
Shipments increased 16.7 percent from a year earlier, beating
the median estimate for a 13.2 percent gain in a Bloomberg
survey, an April 11 report showed. The  Taiwan dollar  is Asia’s
best-performing major currency this year, having strengthened
4.6 percent.  The yield on Taiwan’s 1.375 percent bond due March 2021
increased one basis point to 1.36 percent, according to Gretai
Securities Market, the island’s biggest exchange for bonds.  To contact the reporters on this story:
