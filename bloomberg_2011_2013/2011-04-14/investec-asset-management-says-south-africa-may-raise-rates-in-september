South Africa ’s central bank may
increase its key interest rate in September and is very likely
to boost rates in November if the oil price remains where it is,
said Malcolm Charles, a portfolio manager at Investec Asset
Management.  “We expect a normalization of 100 basis point this year”
in the key rate, he told reporters in Johannesburg today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
