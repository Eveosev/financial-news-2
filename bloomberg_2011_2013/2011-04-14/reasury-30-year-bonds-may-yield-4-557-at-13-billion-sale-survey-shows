The Treasury Department’s $13
billion sale of 30-year bonds may draw a yield of 4.557 percent,
according to the average forecast in a Bloomberg News survey of
8 of the  Federal Reserve ’s 20 primary dealers.  The offering is the second reopening of the $16 billion
auction of long bonds on Feb. 10, and the securities mature in
February 2041. They yielded 4.550 percent in pre-auction
trading. Bids are due by 1 p.m. New York time.  Last month’s sale of 30-year bonds drew a yield of 4.569
percent, compared with 4.75 percent at the February auction. The
March 10 offering’s bid-to-cover ratio, which gauges demand by
comparing the amount bid with the amount offered, was 3.02,
versus 2.51 at the February sale of the securities and an
average of 2.7 for the past 10 auctions.  Indirect bidders, a class of investors that includes
foreign central banks, bought 40.7 percent of the bonds at the
March sale and 43.1 percent at the February offering. The
average for the past 10 auctions is 39.7 percent.  Direct bidders, non-primary-dealer investors that place
their bids directly with the Treasury, purchased 6.4 percent of
the securities at the last sale, compared with 8 percent in
February and an average of 11.8 percent at the past 10 auctions.  Thirty-year bonds have lost 2.2 percent this year, compared
with little change by Treasuries overall, according to Bank of
America Merrill Lynch indexes.  The Fed’s primary dealers trade  government securities  with
the central bank and are obligated to participate in Treasury
auctions.  The U.S. is selling $66 billion in notes and bonds this
week. It auctioned $32 billion of three-year debt on April 12
and sold $21 billion of 10-year securities yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
