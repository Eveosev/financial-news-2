The  Korea Communications Commission 
said it is considering making mobile-phone  text messages  free of
charge to lower phone bills for consumers as the government
strives to curb rising prices.  “We are having in-depth reviews on it,” Choi See Joong,
chairman of South Korea’s telecommunication regulator, told
lawmakers yesterday.  SK Telecom Co., South Korea’s largest mobile-phone operator,
fell 1.9 percent to 156,000 won as of 11:38 a.m. in Seoul, while
 KT Corp. (030200)  dropped 1.3 percent to 38,050 won.  The government has already pressed oil refiners to cut
prices after inflation breached President Lee Myung Bak’s 3
percent target for the past seven months.  Consumer prices may increase 3.9 percent in 2011, faster
than the previous estimate of 3.5 percent, the Bank of Korea
said yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
