Deutsche Bank AG (DBK)  Chief Executive
Officer  Josef Ackermann  is “one of the most dangerous bank
managers in the world” because he’s sticking to the company’s
high profitability target, Simon Johnson, a former chief
economist at the International Monetary Fund, was cited as
saying by German  newspaper  Die Tageszeitung.  The target of pretax return on equity of 25 percent is only
possible because Ackermann knows Deutsche Bank poses systemic
risk and would be rescued by taxpayers, Johnson said in the
interview, according to an article on the newspaper’s website
dated April 13.  Deutsche Bank, Germany’s biggest bank, rejects criticism of
the 25 percent ROE goal, saying the industrial sector had more
than 30 percent profitability on average from 1994 to 2007,
spokesman  Ronald Weichert  said in an e-mailed statement today.
The company has low-risk businesses such as advisory that
contribute to profitability targets and the bank didn’t need
taxpayer money during the financial crisis, he said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
