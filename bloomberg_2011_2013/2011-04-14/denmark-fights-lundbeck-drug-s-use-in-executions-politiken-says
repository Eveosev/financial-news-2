Danish Foreign Minister Lene
Espersen will ask U.S. states to stop using H. Lundbeck A/S’s
anti-seizure drug in executions of prisoners on death row,
Politiken reported, citing correspondence the minister had with
another politician.  Espersen, in comments to a member of the Enhedslisten
party, said she will ask the Danish embassy in  Washington  to ask
states to stop using the Valby, Denmark-based drugmaker’s
treatment, pentobarbital, the Copenhagen-based newspaper said.
Espersen said she and European colleagues also will ask the
European Commission to allow the export of drugs only for
"acceptable" purposes, Politiken reported.  Click here for web link  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
