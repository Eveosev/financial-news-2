Iran  may be helping Syria’s
government suppress political protests, U.S. State Department
spokesman Mark Toner said.  “We believe there is credible information that Iran is
assisting” the Syrian government “in quelling protesters,”
Toner said at a briefing in Washington.  The Iranians “continue to play a meddling role in the
region,” Toner said. “We encourage them to play a more
constructive role.”  A Syrian Foreign Ministry official who wasn’t named denied
Iranian involvement, according to the state-run Syrian Arab  News
Agency , and said that if the U.S. has evidence of Iranian
assistance it should present it.  Iran is providing Syria with gear to suppress crowds and
help in blocking and monitoring the use of the Internet, mobile
phones and text messaging by protesters, the Wall Street Journal
reported yesterday, citing an unnamed U.S. official.  To contact the reporter on this story:
