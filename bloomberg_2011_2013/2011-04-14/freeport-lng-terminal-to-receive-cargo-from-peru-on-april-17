Freeport LNG’s liquefied-natural-
gas terminal in  Texas  is to receive a cargo of the fuel April 17
from  Peru , according to vessel tracking data compiled by
Bloomberg.  The tanker STX Frontier can carry 153,000 cubic meters of
LNG, or about 3.29 billion cubic feet when converted to a gas.
The cargo is equal to about 5.1 percent of daily U.S. gas
production.  The LNG is being shipped to Freeport, Texas, from a
terminal located between Cañete and Chincha, Peru, the first
export facility for the fuel in  South America , according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. Dallas-based Hunt Oil Co. owns 50 percent
of the plant,  according to the company .  LNG is gas that is cooled to a liquid for transport by ship
to markets not connected by pipelines. The fuel is received at
import terminals and converted back to a gaseous form.  To contact the reporter on this story:
