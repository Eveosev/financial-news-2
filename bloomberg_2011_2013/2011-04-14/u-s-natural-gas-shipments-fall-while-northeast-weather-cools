Scheduled natural gas deliveries to
U.S. electricity generators fell for a second day, while
shipments to the Northeast rose on forecasts of cooler weather
that may increase heating demand.  A sample of scheduled deliveries to  power plants  in the
U.S. and Canada shows shipments declined 0.3 percent to 13.3
million dekatherms (13 billion cubic feet), according to data
compiled by Bloomberg as of 10:45 a.m. in New York. Shipments to
power generators in the Northeast increased 9 percent to 1.72
million, rising for the third day in four.  Scheduled shipments for U.S. residences fell 3.8 percent to
26.9 million, the sixth decline in seven days.  High temperatures in Buffalo, New York, today are expected
to hit 52 degrees Fahrenheit (11 Celsius), 6 below normal,
according to  Weather Underground  in  Ann Arbor , Michigan. They
could fall to 47 degrees by April 17, the forecaster said.  Wholesale gas at the Tetco M3 hub, where gas is delivered
from  Texas  to New York and New Jersey, rose 1.78 cents, or 0.4
percent, to $4.4885 per million British thermal units yesterday
on the Intercontinental Exchange.  Gas at the  Henry Hub  in Erath, Louisiana, the delivery
point for futures traded on the New York Mercantile Exchange,
advanced 5.91 cents yesterday, or 1.5 percent, to $4.1417 per
million Btu.  To contact the reporter on this story:
