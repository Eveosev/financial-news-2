 Troy Tulowitzki hit his Major
League Baseball-leading seventh home run of the season as the
 Colorado Rockies  beat the New York Mets 9-4 to sweep a double-
header.  Tulowitzki, the Rockies’ shortstop, had home runs in the
four games of the series at Citi Field in New York as Colorado
won its sixth straight game last night to improve to  10-2  for
the best record in the majors.  In the nightcap, the Mets (4-9) started the scoring in the
second inning on Mike Nickeas’s two-run scoring double.
Shortstop  Jose Reyes  added two more runs batted in during the
fourth inning to give New York a 4-2 lead.  The Rockies rallied to score six runs in the sixth inning,
including a three-run homer by Jonathan Herrera.  Tulowitzki earlier took his season tally to six home runs
in the opening game, while  Carlos Gonzalez  hit his first homer.  The Mets scored two runs in the bottom of the ninth inning
to pull within 6-5. They loaded the bases before Matt Lindstrom
got  David Wright  to fly out to end the game.  To contact the reporter on this story:
