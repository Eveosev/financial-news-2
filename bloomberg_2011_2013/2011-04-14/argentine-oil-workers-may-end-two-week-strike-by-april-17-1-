Argentine oil and natural-gas
workers may end a two-week strike by April 17 in the  Santa Cruz 
province, a union official said.  "The Planning Ministry is working a lot to find a solution
and we think that maybe the strike will end" by April 17, union
official Pablo Fonseca Torres said today by telephone from Santa
Cruz. "It’s a small group of people who are blocking" fields, he
said.  About 150 members of the Santa Cruz Private Oil & Gas
Workers union’s 10,000 members are staging the protest in the
remote southern province, union official Sergio Torres said
yesterday. Santa Cruz is responsible for about 20 percent of
Argentina’s crude output, according to the energy secretariat.  The strike is affecting fields in the northern part of the
province, operated by companies including  YPF SA (YPFD) ,  China
Petroleum & Chemical Corp. (600028)  and Pan American Energy LLC, which is
50 percent owned by  Cnooc Ltd. (883) , Fonseca said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
