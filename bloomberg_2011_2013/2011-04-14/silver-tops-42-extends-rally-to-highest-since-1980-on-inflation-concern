Silver futures topped $42 an ounce,
extending a rally to the highest since 1980, on mounting demand
for the precious metal as a hedge against inflation.  U.S. wholesale costs increased 0.7 percent in March, led by
surging energy, the government said. Compared with a year
earlier, prices climbed 5.8 percent. Silver reached $42.21, the
highest in 31 years, and has climbed 36 percent this year, the
biggest gain among the 19 raw materials in the Thomson
Reuters/Jefferies CRB Index.  “Inflation is back in vogue,” said  Adam Klopfenstein , a
senior strategist at Lind-Waldock, a broker in  Chicago .
“There’s a lot of pent-up buying interest, and when silver
began to make a move earlier today, there was a scramble to back
into the market.”  Silver futures for May delivery traded at $42.085 at 4:33
p.m. in electronic trading on the Comex in  New York . Earlier,
the price rose $1.427, or 3.5 percent, to settle at $41.664.
That gain was the biggest since Dec. 28.  The metal reached a record $50.35 in 1980.  Gold futures for June delivery rose $16.80, or 1.2 percent,
to close at $1,472.40 an ounce. The price reached $1,475.90
after the settlement. The record high was $1,478 on April 11.  Based on the closing price, the metal has gained 3.6
percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
