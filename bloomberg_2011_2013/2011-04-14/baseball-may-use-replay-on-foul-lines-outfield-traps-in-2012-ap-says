Major League Baseball  may extend
instant replay next season but not to ball-strike or safe-out
calls, the  Associated Press  said.  Baseball is leaning toward expanding its video replay
policy to include reviews of whether a ball was trapped or
caught by an outfielder, and determinations of fair and foul
balls hit down the lines, AP said, citing an unidentified person
familiar with the talks.  The issue was discussed by Commissioner Bud Selig and a
group of umpires during spring training and may be implemented
for the 2012 season, AP said.  Baseball spokesman Pat Courtney said in an e-mail that no
decisions regarding instant replay have been made, though there
have been “many discussions about numerous topics” by the
league’s special committee for on-field matters.  Baseball began using instant replay in 2008 to determine if
home runs cleared the wall and were fair or foul. Expanded
replay became a popular topic during last season’s playoffs
after a series of missed calls by umpires.  To contact the reporter on this story:
