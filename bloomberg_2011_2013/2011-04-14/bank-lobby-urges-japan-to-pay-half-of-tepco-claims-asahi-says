Japan ’s government should take
responsibility for half of  Tokyo  Electric Power Co.’s
compensation claims from the accident at its Fukushima Dai-Ichi
nuclear power plant, the Asahi newspaper reported, citing the
head of the nation’s banking lobby.  The government should step in because of the unprecedented
scale of the disaster caused by the earthquake and tsunami,
Masayuki Oku, head of the Japanese Bankers Association, said
today, according to the report. Oku also spoke against
nationalization of Tepco, as the utility is known, according to
the Asahi.  To contact the reporter on this story:
