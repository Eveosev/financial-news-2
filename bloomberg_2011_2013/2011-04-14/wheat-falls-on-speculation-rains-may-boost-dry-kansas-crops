Wheat futures fell for a fourth
straight day on speculation that rain will improve the prospects
of dry fields in  Kansas , the biggest producer of U.S. winter
varieties.  Kansas may get from 1.5 inches (3.8 centimeters) to 3
inches of rain during the next week, with the heaviest amounts
falling in northern areas, according to a forecast by Martell
Crop Projections. The precipitation may “prevent  drought  from
expanding” in northern and eastern areas of the Great Plains,
while southern crops will remain dry, according to a T-Storm
Weather report.  “You’ve got rain in the forecast for the hard red winter-
wheat region, so obviously that’s very bearish,” said  Jeff McReynolds , the owner of McReynolds Marketing and Investments in
Hays, Kansas. “Some of that wheat’s already gone though, so
it’s too late, or it’ll be planted to something else.”  Wheat futures for July delivery fell 11.75 cents, or 1.5
percent, to settle at $7.7625 a bushel at 1:15 p.m. on the
 Chicago  Board of Trade. Prices have dropped 6.7 percent this
week. Futures have still climbed 59 percent in the past year as
severe drought spurred Russia to ban exports, while floods
eroded supplies from Canada and  Australia .  Wheat is the fourth-biggest U.S. crop, valued at $13
billion in 2010, behind corn, soybeans and hay, government data
show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
