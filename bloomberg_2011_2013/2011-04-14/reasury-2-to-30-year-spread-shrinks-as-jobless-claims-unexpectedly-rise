Treasury notes fell for the first
time in three days as stocks erased losses on a return in
investor appetite for higher-yielding assets.  U.S. government securities earlier rose after claims for
jobless benefits unexpectedly increased and wholesale costs
slowed, tempering speculation the economy is improving. The
difference in yields between Treasury 2- and 30-year securities
shrank to the narrowest in a week as the U.S. drew higher-than-
forecast demand at an auction of $13 billion of 30-year debt.
Data on U.S. consumer prices are due tomorrow.  “It’s choppy trading,” said  Charles Comiskey , head of
Treasury trading at Bank of Nova Scotia in New York. “The
auctions went OK. Now that they are over, the focus is on the
inflation news for tomorrow.”  Ten-year note yields increased four basis points, or 0.04
percentage point, to 3.50 percent at 5:31 p.m. in New York,
according to BGCantor Market Data. They earlier touched 3.42
percent, the lowest level since April 5. The price of the 3.625
percent security due in February 2021 dropped 10/32, or $3.13
per $1,000 face amount, to 101 1/32. Two-year yields added four
basis points to 0.77 percent after tumbling to 0.70 percent, the
lowest since March 25.  The benchmark 30-year bond yield increased less than one
basis point to 4.55 percent. It earlier fell to 4.52 percent,
the lowest level since April 6.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index ended the day little
changed after falling earlier as much as 0.9 percent.  U.S. consumer prices increased 2.6 percent last month from
a year earlier after gaining in February at an annual rate of
2.1 percent, a separate Bloomberg survey forecast before a
government report tomorrow.  Producer Prices  Wholesale costs in the U.S. rose 0.7 percent in March,
another Labor Department report showed. The median forecast in a
Bloomberg survey was for a rise of 1 percent.  Applications for unemployment insurance benefits increased
27,000 in the week ended April 9 to 412,000, the most in two
months, Labor Department figures showed today in  Washington .
Economists projected claims would be little changed at 380,000,
according to the median estimate in a Bloomberg News survey.  The difference in yields between 2- and 30-year notes
decreased to 3.78 percentage points, from 3.82 yesterday. It was
the narrowest level since April 6.  The yield gap between yields on five-year Treasury
Inflation Protected Securities and comparable U.S. notes, a
measure of trader expectations for consumer prices over the life
of the debt called the break-even rate, was 2.35 percentage
points. It touched 2.46 percentage points on April 11, the most
since July 2008. The average for the five years before the onset
that year of the financial crisis was 2.39 percentage points.  Fed’s Measure  A measure of inflation expectations that the Fed uses to
help determine monetary policy, the five-year, five-year forward
break-even rate, was 3.1 percent, compared with 3.28 percent on
Dec. 15, a 10-month high. The five-year average is 2.78
percentage points.  The 30-year bonds sold today drew a yield of 4.531 percent,
compared with the average forecast of 4.557 percent in a
Bloomberg News survey of 8 of the  Federal Reserve ’s 20 primary
dealers.  The bid-to-cover ratio, which gauges demand by
comparing total bids with the amount offered, was 2.83, compared
with an average of 2.7 at the past 10 sales.  Indirect bidders, a class of investors that includes
foreign central banks, bought 47.2 percent of the bonds at
today’s auction, compared with 40.7 percent in March. The
average for the past 10 sales is 39.74 percent.  Direct bidders, non-primary-dealer investors that place
their bids directly with the Treasury, purchased 10.8 percent of
the debt, compared with 6.4 percent at the March offering and a
10-sale average of 11.8 percent.  ‘Plenty of Demand’  Thirty-year bonds at last month’s auction drew a yield of
4.569 percent.  “There is still plenty of demand for long-term U.S.
Treasuries, especially at the back end of the curve from foreign
investors,” said Scott Sherman, an interest-rate strategist at
Credit Suisse Group AG in  New York , which as a primary dealer is
obligated to bid in U.S. debt sales. “You aren’t getting any
evidence of concern about the budget or inflation in the auction
results.”  The government sold $21 billion in 10-year notes yesterday
at a yield of 3.494 percent and $32 billion of three-year debt
on April 12 at a yield of 1.28 percent. It will auction $14
billion in 5-year TIPS on April 21, the Treasury said today.  Thirty-year bonds have lost investors 2.2 percent this
year, compared with little change by Treasuries overall,
according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch indexes.  Debt Crisis  Treasuries earlier rose after German Finance Minister
 Wolfgang Schaeuble  said  Greece  may need a debt restructuring,
reviving concern that  Europe ’s sovereign-debt crisis may worsen
and boosting investor demand for safety.  The Fed bought $7.68 billion in Treasuries today maturing
from May 2018 to February 2021 as part of its $600 billion debt-
purchase program to spur economic growth.  Minneapolis Fed President  Narayana Kocherlakota  said while
inflation pressures are currently “very low,” the central bank
will eventually need to raise rates and sell assets. He was
responding to a question after a speech in Helena,  Montana .  Philadelphia Fed President  Charles Plosser  said the U.S.
central bank should set a numerical inflation target to promote
 price stability  as it prepares to withdraw record stimulus.  “The apparent strengthening of the  U.S. economy  suggests
that, in the not-too-distant future, monetary policy will have
to begin reversing course from a very accommodative policy
stance,” Plosser said in remarks at a conference in New York.  To contact the reporters on this story:
