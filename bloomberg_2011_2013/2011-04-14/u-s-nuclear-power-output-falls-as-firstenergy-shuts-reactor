U.S. nuclear-power output fell for
the first time in four days as  FirstEnergy Corp. (FE)  shut a unit in
 Pennsylvania , the Nuclear Regulatory Commission said.  Power generation nationwide fell 1,299 megawatts, or 1.7
percent, from yesterday to 76,269 megawatts, or 75 percent of
capacity, according to an NRC report today and data compiled by
Bloomberg. Twenty-four of the nationâ€™s 104 reactors were
offline.  FirstEnergy shut Unit 1 at the Beaver Valley site. The unit
was at full power yesterday. The company also increased output
at Unit 2 to 98 percent of capacity from 87 percent yesterday.
Each reactor can produce 940 megawatts at the plant, which is
located about 26 miles (42 kilometers) northwest of Pittsburgh.  The Tennessee Valley Authority slowed output from the
1,104-megawatt Browns Ferry 2 reactor in Alabama to 65 percent
of capacity from 98 percent yesterday.  Browns Ferry Units 1 and 3, which have respective
capacities of 1,065 megawatts and 1,115 megawatts, are operating
at full power. The plant is located 84 miles north of Birmingham
on Wheeler Lake, near the Tennessee border.  Progress Energy Inc. (PGN)  started the 937-megawatt Brunswick 2
reactor in  North Carolina . The reactor is operating at 1 percent
of capacity. The Brunswick 1 unit is operating at full power.  The plant is located at Cape Fear on the Atlantic Ocean,
130 miles south of Raleigh.  Carolina Reactor  Scana Corp. (SCG)  slowed the 966-megawatt Virgil C. Summer
reactor in South Carolina to 80 percent of capacity from 85
percent yesterday. The plant is located near Jenkinsville, about
26 miles northwest of Columbia.  Some reactors close for maintenance and refueling during
the spring and fall in the U.S., when demand for heating and
cooling is lower. The outages can increase consumption of
natural gas and coal to generate electricity.  The average U.S. reactor  refueling outage  lasted 41 days in
2009, according to the  Nuclear Energy Institute .  To contact the reporter on this story:
