Kobe Bryant  was fined $100,000 for
directing “derogatory comments” toward a referee who had
called a technical foul on the  Los Angeles  Lakers guard, the
 National Basketball Association  said.  Bryant was given his 15th technical foul of the season for
arguing after he got his fourth foul during a 102-93 win against
the San Antonio Spurs at the Staples Center in Los Angeles on
April 12.  NBA Commissioner David Stern called Bryant’s comments
“offensive and inexcusable.”  “Kobe and everyone associated with the NBA know that
insensitive or derogatory comments are not acceptable and have
no place in our game or society,” Stern said in a statement.  Bryant said he didn’t mean to cause offense.  “My actions were out of frustration during the heat of the
game,” he said in a statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
