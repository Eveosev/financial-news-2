Sweden may need to push through tax
cuts at every budget if it is to reduce unemployment further,
Finance Minister Anders Borg said.  “We have a lot of work to do to secure full employment,”
Borg said at an event today arranged by  Svenska Handelsbanken AB (SHBA) 
in  Stockholm . “It will require that we make changes to taxes
and spending in practically every budget going forward if we are
to come down to unemployment rates in line with the best
European countries.”  The government yesterday raised its economic growth
forecasts for 2012 and 2013 and predicted budget surpluses,
allowing it to cut taxes when most other European countries are
grappling with austerity measures. The fastest-growing European
economy will expand 4.6 percent this year, 3.8 percent in 2012
and 3.6 percent the following year, Borg said yesterday.  The krona strengthened 0.2 percent against the euro to
9.0224 at 9:40 a.m. in Stockholm. It jumped 0.9 percent
yesterday following the government’s forecasts.  Unemployment fell to 7.9 percent in February from 8.2
percent the previous month,  Statistics Sweden  said on March 17,
citing non-seasonally adjusted figures.  To contact the reporter on this story:
