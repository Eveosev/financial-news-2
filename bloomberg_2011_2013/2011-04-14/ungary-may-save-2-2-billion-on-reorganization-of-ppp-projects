Hungary  could save 400 billion
forint ($2.2 billion) in long-term budget spending as the
government reorganizes public-private partnership projects, the
Development Ministry said.  The government will terminate all PPP projects that are
deemed to be “disadvantageous” and economically unviable, the
 ministry  said in a statement late yesterday. The cabinet will
seek other financing possibilities or will buy out these
projects at “realistic” prices, according to the statement.  There are about 100 PPP projects, entailing total state
financing obligations of 3 trillion forint, according to the
statement.  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
