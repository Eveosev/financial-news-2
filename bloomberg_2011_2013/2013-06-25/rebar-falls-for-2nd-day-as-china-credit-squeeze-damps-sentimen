Steel reinforcement-bar futures fell
for a second day as China’s biggest squeeze on credit in at
least a decade increased concern that demand for the
construction material will falter.  Rebar for delivery in October on the Shanghai Futures
Exchange fell as much as 0.8 percent to 3,423 yuan ($557) a
metric ton and was at 3,434 yuan at 10:36 a.m. local time.  China’s  CSI 300 Index (SHSZ300) , a gauge of the nation’s equities,
deepened its slump into a  bear market  today on concerns elevated
money-market rates will exacerbate the country’s economic
slowdown. The gauge had its biggest slump yesterday since August
2009 after the central bank signaled it will maintain efforts to
curb speculative lending.  “The country’s financial markets were dealt a hard blow by
surging funding costs and the prospect of a weaker economy
ahead,” Dang Man, analyst at Maike Futures Co., said by phone
from Xi’an today.  Iron ore prices  for immediate delivery at Tianjin port in
China fell 1.7 percent to $116.60 a dry ton yesterday, according
to The Steel Index Ltd.  The average  spot price  for rebar in China was little
changed at 3,389  yuan  a ton yesterday, according to data from
Beijing Antaike Information Development Co.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
