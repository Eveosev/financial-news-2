U.K. Treasury minister David Gauke
wrote to reassure Conservative lawmakers this week that the
government would introduce tax breaks for married couples before
the next general election.  Gauke wrote that “the prime minister and chancellor have
consistently made clear that we remain committed to recognizing
marriage in the tax system.” The wording of the letter was
confirmed by Chancellor of the Exchequer  George Osborne ’s
office.  “An announcement on details of how we will legislate for
this in this parliament will be made by the chancellor in due
course,” Gauke said in the letter.  Osborne is due to announce his 2015-2016 spending review
tomorrow setting out details of cuts to departmental budgets.
Gauke’s letter demonstrates recognition by the Tory leadership
that it needs to keep rank-and-file lawmakers happy ahead of the
May 2015 election. Some Tories say the party is losing support
partly because it isn’t doing enough for traditional families.  To contact the reporters on this story:
