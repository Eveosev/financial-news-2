The  Federal Reserve  added $610
million in  reserves  to the banking system when it arranged
repurchase agreements as part of its readiness program.  The one-day transactions, part of a series of open-market
operations that began in 2009, don’t represent any change in
monetary policy, according to a statement yesterday on the
 Federal Reserve  Bank of New York’s  website .   In repos, the Fed buys securities from its 21 primary
dealers for a set period, temporarily raising the amount of
money available in the banking system. At maturity, the
securities are returned to the dealers, and the cash to the Fed.
In a reverse repo, the opposite occurs.  The Fed has historically used repos and reverse repos to
help maintain the proper level of money in the banking system to
keep overnight  interest rates  close to the central bank’s
target. The Fed has held its target rate for overnight loans
between banks in a range of zero to 0.25 percent since December
2008.  To contact the reporter on this story:
