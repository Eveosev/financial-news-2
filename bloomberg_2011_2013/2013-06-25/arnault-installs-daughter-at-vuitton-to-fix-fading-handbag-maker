LVMH Moet Hennessy  Louis Vuitton  SA
named Delphine Arnault, daughter of Chairman  Bernard Arnault , as
executive vice president at Louis Vuitton, tasking her with
overhauling the handbag maker’s products amid weakening sales.  Arnault, 38, will join LVMH’s  largest brand  in September
from Christian Dior Couture, where she has been deputy managing
director since 2008, the Paris-based luxury goods maker said
today in a statement.  The executive’s knowledge of high-quality products and her
experience at Dior are “key assets to contribute to the
successful development of Louis Vuitton,” Michael Burke,
chairman and chief executive officer of the handbag maker, said
in a statement.  Vuitton is raising prices, using more leather as well as
fewer logos in its product mix and limiting store expansion to
regain its luster as sales growth slows from Barcelona to
Beijing. LVMH, the world’s largest luxury goods maker, in April
posted its weakest fashion and leather goods sales growth since 
2009.  Vuitton, which accounted for about half of LVMH’s 5.9
billion euros ($7.7 billion) in earnings before interest and
taxes in 2012, “needs fixing,” said  Luca Solca , an analyst at
Exane BNP Paribas. “I can hardly imagine a more important job
within the group than to be overseeing this process. It can be a
coming of age assignment.”  The shares gained as much as 2.5 percent in Paris trading
and were up 2.1 percent to 121.7 euros as of 4:33 p.m.  To contact the reporter on this story:
