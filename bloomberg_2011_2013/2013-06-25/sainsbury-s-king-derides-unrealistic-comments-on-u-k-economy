J Sainsbury Plc (SBRY)  Chief Executive
Officer Justin King took a swipe at politicians for talking up
the U.K. economy, saying that consumers continue to struggle.  “It’s unrealistic to paint a picture which is not the
reality that consumers are currently experiencing,” King said
at a conference in London today. “Nobody should be planning
their business today if they’re customer-facing on an
expectation that consumers have extra money to spend.”  Chancellor of the Exchequer  George Osborne  said June 23 the
economy was moving from rescue to recovery. His comments came
three days after official figures showed that  U.K. retail sales 
rose more than economists forecast in May as food sales
increased at their fastest pace for more than two years.  “It’s the job of politicians to talk things up or talk
things down,” King said, while reiterating Sainsbury’s guidance
for sales growth. “If you’re in power, you talk things up.”  Consumer spending  will remain subdued as households
struggle with inflation outpacing wage growth, King said.  Sainsbury forecasts growth of 1 percent to 1.5 percent in
same-store sales for the full financial year. The company last
repeated the target when it reported quarterly sales June 12.  To contact the reporter on this story:
