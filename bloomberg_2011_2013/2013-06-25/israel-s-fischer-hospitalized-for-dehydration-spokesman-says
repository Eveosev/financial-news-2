Outgoing Bank of Israel Governor
 Stanley Fischer  was released today after being hospitalized
overnight for dehydration and exhaustion.  Fischer, 69, was checked by medics at his home last night
before being taken to Sheba Medical Center near  Tel Aviv . He
underwent tests and was given intravenous fluids, the bank said
in an e-mailed statement today.  “The governor will return to his normal work schedule
tomorrow,” the central bank said.  Fischer is in his final days in the job after announcing in
January that he would leave at the end of June, midway through
his second five-year term.  Jacob Frenkel , chairman of JPMorgan
Chase International, was appointed June 23 by Prime Minister
 Benjamin Netanyahu  as his successor and will return to the post
he held in the 1990s.  “He was a very important and very successful governor in
terms of the development of the Israeli economy,” Fischer said
at a farewell press conference in Jerusalem yesterday. “I have
no reason to think that he won’t be an outstanding governor.”  Fischer, who oversaw the bank’s monetary policy decision
for the last time on June 24, held the benchmark rate at 1.25
percent after cutting twice last month. The panel cited as one
reason the U.S. Federal Reserve’s signal last week that it may
start scaling back the monthly bond purchasing program known as
quantitative easing.  To contact the reporter on this story:
