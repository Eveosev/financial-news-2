The forint gained the most in more
than a week and  Hungary ’s bond yields fell as the country’s
central bankers met to decide whether to extend 10 consecutive
months of rate cuts today.  The forint appreciated 1 percent to 296.19 per euro by
10:03 a.m. in Budapest. Yields on the government’s benchmark 10-year bonds dropped 23 basis points, or 0.23 percentage point, to
6.64 percent, after reaching the highest since December
yesterday.  The Magyar Nemzeti Bank will probably cut its benchmark
rate by 25 basis points to a record 4.25 percent, according to
all 25 analysts  polled  by Bloomberg. Traders cut wagers on
further monetary easing as plans by the Federal Reserve to taper
stimulus caused emerging-market assets to tumble.  “The unsettled global environment and the bulk of rate
cuts already behind us may make the Monetary Council reconsider
what has been a practice of automatic cuts until now,” Zsolt Kondrat, a Budapest-based analyst at MKB Bank Zrt., a unit of
Bayerische Landesbank, wrote in a research report today. “A
pause in easing would be a positive surprise which may make the
exchange rate strengthen by a few forints.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
