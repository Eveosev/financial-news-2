The  Memphis Grizzlies  reached an
agreement in principle to promote assistant Dave Joerger to
replace Lionel Hollins as coach,  ESPN reports , citing
unidentified people involved in the negotiations.  Joerger, 39, spent the past six National Basketball
Association seasons on the Grizzlies’ coaching staff. He emerged
as the favorite to become coach after the Grizzlies opted not to
offer Hollins a new contract earlier this month, though the team
also interviewed former Phoenix Suns coach Alvin Gentry and
Chicago Bulls assistant Ed Pinckney for the vacancy, ESPN said.  Joerger takes over a team that had a franchise-best 56-26
record this season and reached the Western Conference finals
before losing to the  San Antonio Spurs . Hollins’s contract was
expiring at the end of this month and the team opted to make a
change due to philosophical differences between the coach
and the front office, the Commercial Appeal of  Memphis  said,
citing unidentified people close to management.  Before joining the Grizzlies, Joerger coached in the
International Basketball Association, the Continental Basketball
Association and the NBA’s developmental league.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
