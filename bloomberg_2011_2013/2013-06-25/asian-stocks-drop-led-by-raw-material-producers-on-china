Asian  stocks  fell as a gauge of the
biggest Chinese shares traded in the mainland sank deeper into a
bear market amid concern a cash crunch will curb growth in the
world’s second-largest economy.  Jiangxi Copper Co. (358) , China’s biggest producer of the metal,
dropped 4.6 percent in Hong Kong. Newcrest Mining Ltd. fell 2.4
percent after  Australia ’s No. 1 gold producer cut jobs at its
Lihir mine in Papua New Guinea. Guangzhou Shipyard International
Co., a unit of China’s largest shipbuilder, plunged 17 percent
after announcing plans to sell shares and buy a shipyard.  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index fell 0.4 percent to 125.3 as of
8:05 p.m. in  Tokyo , reversing gains of 0.5 percent. Almost two
shares fell for each that rose on the measure. The gauge dropped
13 percent from this year’s high on May 20 through yesterday
after Federal Reserve Chairman Ben S. Bernanke said the U.S.
central bank may start dialing down stimulus, and as money-market rates in  China  surged to records.  “Global markets are taking off risk and will continue to
be jittery until interbank rates in China stabilize,” said
Ichiro Yamada, general manager of equities who helps oversee the
equivalent of $3 billion at Fukoku Mutual Life Insurance in
Tokyo. “Japanese shares are falling along with other markets,
but it’s also the most resilient market because it benefits from
a stronger dollar.”  Cash Crunch  China’s CSI 300 Index, representing the biggest companies
in the Shanghai and Shenzhen stock exchange, dropped 0.3
percent, extending losses for fifth day. The measure has fallen
22 percent from this year’s high, surpassing the 20 percent
threshold that some investors consider as a bear market. The
benchmark  Shanghai Composite Index (SHCOMP)  slid 0.2 percent, paring
losses of as much as 5.8 percent earlier.  The overnight interbank interest rates fell for a third
day, the longest run of declines in a month, as the central bank
refrained from selling bills amid the worst cash crunch in at
least a decade. Liquidity risks in China’s financial markets are
controllable and seasonal forces affecting interest rates will
fade, Ling Tao, deputy director of the Shanghai branch of the
People’s Bank of China, said at a briefing today.  Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index gained 0.2 percent after
falling as much as 2 percent. The  Hang Seng China Enterprises
Index (HSCEI)  fell 0.8 percent, taking its slide from a Feb. 1 high to
27 percent.  Japan ’s Topix index slid 1 percent, while the benchmark
Nikkei 225 Stock Average lost 0.7 percent.  South Korea’s Kospi index dropped 1 percent and  Taiwan ’s
 Taiex Index  retreated 1.2 percent. Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 Index
slipped 0.3 percent and New Zealand’s NZX 50 Index decreased 1.1
percent.  Singapore ’s Straits Times Index rose 0.5 percent.  Relative Value  Shares on the Asia-Pacific gauge traded at 12.2 times
estimated earnings yesterday, compared with multiples of 14.2
for the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index and 12.2 for the Stoxx
Europe 600 Index, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Futures on the S&P 500 Index added 0.6 percent today. The
gauge yesterday dropped 1.2 percent to its lowest level since
April 22. The measure briefly slipped below a 2007 closing high
of 1,565.15, a level that marked recovery of all losses from the
financial crisis.  Raw-material producers led declines among the MSCI Asia
Pacific Index’s 10 industry  groups . Jiangxi Copper dropped 4.6
percent to HK$13.02.  BHP Billiton Ltd. (BHP) , the world’s biggest
miner, fell 1.7 percent to A$30.81 in Sydney.  Newcrest Mining slipped 2.4 percent to A$9.30, the lowest
close since September 2003. The company said it will cut about
150 jobs at its Lihir mine as it reorganizes its operations in
response to the plunge in gold prices.  Glencore Drops  Glencore Xstrata Plc (805) , the world’s largest exporter of
power-station coal, sank 3.1 percent to HK$33.15 in Hong Kong,
the lowest close since its May 2011 listing. The company is
proposing to scale down operations at its Ravensworth mine in
Australia amid difficult market conditions, Tony Galvin, general
manager at the mine, said in an e-mailed statement.  Guangzhou Shipyard slumped 18 percent to HK$5.87 in Hong
Kong. The company said yesterday it plans to sell as much as 2.5
billion  yuan  ($407 million) of new shares and buy a shipyard
part-owned by parent China State Shipbuilding Corp.  ANA Holdings Inc., operator of the world’s largest fleet of
Boeing Co. 787s, slid 2 percent to 197 yen in Tokyo after
agreeing to dissolve a low-cost carrier venture with  Malaysia ’s
AsiaAsia Bhd. amid disputes over operating the company. AirAsia,
Asia’s biggest budget airline, lost 1 percent to 3.03 ringgit in
Kuala Lumpur.  To contact the reporters on this story:
