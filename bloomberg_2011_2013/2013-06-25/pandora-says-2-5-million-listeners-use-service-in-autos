Pandora Media Inc. (P) , the biggest
online radio service, said the number of U.S. listeners in cars
topped 2.5 million, a milestone in efforts to win customers from
traditional stations. The stock rose the most since March 8.  Listeners obtain the service from 23 auto brands and eight
car-stereo makers, Oakland, California-based Pandora said today
in an e-mailed statement. This year, Pandora will become
available in more than 100 models, Chief Marketing Officer Simon Fleming-Wood said.  About half of all listening takes place in autos, a crucial
battleground in the $15 billion local radio advertising market.
Pandora, with more than 70 million monthly users, will come
installed in one-third of all new vehicles sold in the U.S. this
year, the company said.  Pandora also plans to make the service available in Dodge,
Infiniti, Jeep, Kia and Ram brands. Its partnerships with the
 auto industry  started with  Ford Motor Co. (F)  in 2010.  The shares gained 8.5 percent to $16.41 at the close in  New
York , the biggest advance since March 8. The  stock  has climbed
79 percent this year, compared with the 11 percent gain for the
Russell 1000 Index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
