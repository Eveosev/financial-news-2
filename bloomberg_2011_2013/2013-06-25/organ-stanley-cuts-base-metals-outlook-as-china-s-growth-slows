Morgan Stanley reduced its forecasts
for industrial metals on concerns slowing growth in  China , the
world’s biggest consumer, and the nation’s worst cash squeeze in
at least a decade will curb demand.  The bank cut its 2013 copper estimate by 3 percent to $3.42
a pound and lowered its nickel prediction by 7 percent to $7.23
a pound, according to analysts  Peter Richardson  and Joel Crane
in a report e-mailed today. Copper for September delivery traded
at $3.0285 on the Comex in  New York .  China’s central bank said the country should fine-tune its
policies as a cash squeeze in the banking system risks
exacerbating an economic slowdown. Copper in New York yesterday
fell to the lowest in almost three years while aluminum in
 London  extended the longest slump since at least 1987 on
mounting concerns demand in China will slow.  “The headwinds to commodity price performance have been
intensified by growing signs of deterioration in the quality of
this lower growth,” the report said. “Strong  credit  growth in
total social financing in China has raised some increasingly
serious market concerns about the direction, composition and
risks embedded in this development.”  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. lowered its estimate for 2013
Chinese gross domestic product growth yesterday to 7.4 percent
from 7.8 percent, citing weaker economic indicators and
tightening of financial conditions. The  CSI 300 Index (SHSZ300)  of China’s
biggest companies tumbled 6.3 percent yesterday, taking its drop
from this year’s high to more than 20 percent and meeting the
common definition of a  bear market .  Morgan Stanley lowered its aluminum forecast for 2013 by 2
percent to 89 cents a pound, while zinc was also cut 2 percent
to 89 cents a pound. Tin was reduced by 7 percent to $10.08 a
pound and lead was lowered 1 percent to 98 cents a pound.  To contact the reporter on this story:
