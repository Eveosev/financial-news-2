a report showed a gain for U.S. housing, indicating demand for
 diesel fuel  used in trucks may grow. Crack spreads widened.  Futures rose as much as 1 percent. Orders for U.S.  durable
goods  climbed 3.6 percent in May, higher than the 3 percent

is a significant leading indicator of future economic growth,”
said Jason Schenker, president of Prestige Economics LLC, an
Austin, Texas-based energy consultant.  Ultra-low-sulfur diesel for July delivery rose 1.03 cents,
