Production of vegetable oils and
fats will probably exceed demand in 2013-14 on rising output of
sunflower-seed oil and soybean oil combined with “sluggish”
biodiesel demand, Oil World forecast.  Total production of 17 oils and fats in the year through
September 2014 is predicted to climb to 193.8 million metric
tons from 187.3 million tons in 2012-13, the Hamburg-based
industry researcher wrote today in an e-mailed report.  Soybean and soybean-oil futures have dropped 11 percent in
the past 12 months in  Chicago  on an outlook for increased
production in the U.S., the biggest grower. The outlook for
prices in the 2013-14 season is “bearish,” Oil World said.  “Supplies of seed oils will recover pronouncedly in
2013-14, if weather cooperates and current crop forecasts
materialize,” Oil World wrote. “World production is likely to
exceed demand.”  Consumption of oils and fats is forecast to climb to 192.9
million tons from 187.6 million tons, according to Oil World.
That will lift ending stocks to 24.2 million tons from an
estimated 23.6 million tons at the end of 2012-13.  Unchanged biodiesel mandates in the European Union and
“hesitatingly” implemented increases in Brazil and  Argentina 
mean there’s little scope for more growth in demand for
vegetable oils to make biodiesel, according to Oil World.  “Prices of oils and fats are therefore likely to stay near
those of crude mineral oil to attract some additional demand as
energy source in the upcoming season,” Oil World said.  Transition Period  Global production of 12 oilseed meals is predicted to climb
3.2 percent to 300.3 million tons in the year through September
2014 from 291 million tons expected for this marketing year, the
researcher said.  Oil-meal consumption may rise to 299.3 million tons from
292 million tons, helping lift ending stocks to 10.1 million
tons from 9.43 million tons.  “The global oil-meal market is in transition from
tightness to more ample supplies,” Oil World wrote. “There is
a considerable downward potential for soya meal prices in the
July-September 2013 quarter.”  World soybean meal production may advance to 186.9 million
tons next season from 179.4 million tons, with usage in 2013-14
climbing to 186.4 million tons from 179.7 million tons.  The global harvest of 10 oilseeds is predicted to climb to
484.5 million tons from 463.5 million tons in 2012-13, little
changed from the outlook two weeks ago. Soybean output may rise
to 284.2 million tons from 266.1 million tons, while rapeseed
production may rise to 63.5 million tons from 62.7 million tons.  Oilseed crush is estimated at 399.2 million tons from 387.7
million tons, according to Oil World.  To contact the reporter on this story:
