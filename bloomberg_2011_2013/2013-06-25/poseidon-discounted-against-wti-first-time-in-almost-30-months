Poseidon crude fell to a discount
versus West Texas Intermediate for the first time in almost 30
months as the spread between WTI and Brent hovered near the
lowest level since January 2011.  Brent’s premium to West Texas Intermediate shrank 4 cents
to $5.94 a barrel after breaking below $6 yesterday, as  Enbridge
Inc. (ENB)  worked to restore three pipelines in western  Canada . The
lines’ shutdown reduced the flows of Canadian oil and increased
demand for crude from Cushing,  Oklahoma , the delivery point for
WTI contracts on the  New York Mercantile Exchange .  Poseidon, a medium sour grade with about 200,000 barrels a
day of production delivered to tanks and pipelines in Louisiana,
competes with foreign oils priced against Brent. It weakened by
10 cents to a 10-cent-a-barrel discount to WTI at 1:55 p.m. in
New York, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The last time
it traded at a discount was Jan. 3, 2011.  Heavy Louisiana Sweet’s premium  shrank 35 cents to $6.85 a
barrel more than WTI.  Light Louisiana Sweet, the benchmark light, sweet crude on
the  Gulf Coast , increased 10 cents to a premium of $7.90 a
barrel over WTI.  Thunder Horse  strengthened by $1 to $5 a barrel
more than WTI.  Mars Blend’s premium  grew by 5 cents to 75 cents a barrel
more than WTI. Crude from the Southern Green Canyon gained 50
cents to a premium of 75 cents to WTI.  Bakken crude  priced in Clearbrook,  Minnesota , weakened by
25 cents to a discount of $3 a barrel less than WTI.  There were few trades in the Canadian crudes Western
Canadian Select or Syncrude as of 11:59 a.m. local time on Net
Energy Inc., a Calgary-based online oil exchange, after many
offices in downtown Calgary were vacated after power failures
caused by flooding in the city.  To contact the reporter on this story:
