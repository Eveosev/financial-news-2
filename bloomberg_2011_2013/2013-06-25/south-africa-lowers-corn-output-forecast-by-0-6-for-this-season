South Africa reduced its prediction
for corn output this season by 0.6 percent as dry weather cut
yields, the Crop Estimates Committee said.  Farmers in the continent’s largest producer of the grain
may reap 11.38 million metric tons of corn, Marda Scheepers, a
spokeswoman for the committee, said by phone from  Pretoria . That
compares with a median estimate of 11.3 million tons by six
analysts in a Bloomberg survey and the May 23 forecast of 11.4
million tons.  “Dry conditions earlier in the season impacted negatively
on yields, specifically for white maize,” also known as corn,
Scheepers said.  The country’s main growing regions, including the Free
State province, which produces 40 percent of the country’s corn
as well as the North West province which accounts for 16 percent
of the nation’s grain, hadn’t received sufficient rain for crops
to grow during the planting season, which analysts and traders
from BVG (Pty) Ltd., Senwes Ltd. and Farmwise Grains (Pty) Ltd.
said will lead to lower-than-average yields.  South Africa  produced 11.8 million tons last year, more
than the 10.4 million tons harvested in the 2011 season and less
than 2010’s 12.8 million tons, the biggest crop since 1982.  White corn for delivery in July, the most active contract,
gained 0.2 percent to 2,300 rand ($230) a ton by the close in
Johannesburg. The yellow variety for delivery in July rose 0.3
percent to 2,275 rand a ton.  The committee increased the sunflower-production forecast
by 2 percent to 565,500 tons, while the prediction for soybean
output fell 2.8 percent to 802,250 tons, the committee said. The
sorghum-production estimate was raised 3.4 to 173,884 tons and
that for groundnut output was dropped 7.3 percent to 46,900
tons.  To contact the reporter on this story:
