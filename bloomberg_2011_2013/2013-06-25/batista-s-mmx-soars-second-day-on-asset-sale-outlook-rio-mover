MMX Mineracao & Metalicos SA (MMXM3) , the
iron-ore producer controlled by Brazilian billionaire  Eike
Batista , posted the biggest two-day increase in more than four
years as it seeks to sell assets to raise cash.  MMX  surged  18 percent to 1.65 reais at the close of trading
in Sao Paulo, extending its two-day gain to 30 percent, the most
since April 2009. The stock led gains on the benchmark  Ibovespa (IBOV) ,
which climbed 2 percent.  Glencore Xstrata Plc is among three companies in talks to
buy some assets from MMX, two people with knowledge of the
negotiations said last week. The Rio de Janeiro-based company
 said  yesterday it hired advisers to sell assets to Brazilian and
foreign investors, without naming any potential buyer.  “The shares are gaining on expectations of a possible
deal,” Aloisio Lemos, an equity analyst at brokerage Agora
Corretora in Rio, said in a phone interview. “That’s absolutely
the driver of the stock at the moment.”  Batista is in advanced negotiations to sell a stake in MMX
or some assets to a joint venture formed by Glencore and  Grupo
BTG Pactual (BBTG11)  SA, newspaper  Valor Economico  reported today,
without saying how it got the information.  A spokesman for Baar, Switzerland-based Glencore declined
to comment on the Valor article. BTG said it doesn’t comment on
speculation in an e-mailed response to questions.  To contact the reporter on this story:
