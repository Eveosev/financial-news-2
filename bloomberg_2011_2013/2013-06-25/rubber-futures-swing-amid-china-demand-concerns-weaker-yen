Rubber swung between gains and
losses as investors weighed a weaker Japanese currency against
 China ’s biggest squeeze on credit in a decade.  The contract for delivery in November on the Tokyo
Commodity Exchange gained as much as 1.3 percent and fell as
much as 1.1 percent before trading at 230.9 yen a kilogram
($2,364 a metric ton) at 11:57 a.m. Futures touched a nine-month
low of 228 yen on June 21.  Japan’s currency fell to 98.06 per dollar, raising the
appeal of yen-denominated futures, amid speculation the  Federal
Reserve  may end bond buying by mid-2014 while Japan’s central
bank will sustain stimulus to end deflation.  “A weak yen gave the biggest support to futures in
Tokyo,” Takaki Shigemoto, an analyst at research company JSC
Corp. in Tokyo, said by phone today. “Still, concerns about
 China’s economy  are growing, dragging down rubber prices.”  China’s squeeze on credit is increasing the chance that Li
Keqiang will be the first premier to miss an annual growth
target since the Asian financial crisis in 1998. The Shanghai
Composite Index of stocks fell the most since August 2009
yesterday, approaching a  bear market . The overnight repurchase
rate was 6.47 percent, more than double this year’s average of
3.09 percent.  Rubber for September delivery on the Shanghai Futures
Exchange added 0.4 percent to 17,070 yuan ($2,778) a ton.
Natural-rubber inventories rose for a third week, climbing 48
tons to 114,556 tons, the bourse said June 21.  Thai rubber free-on-board dropped 0.1 percent to 85.85 baht
($2.76) a kilogram yesterday, according to the Rubber Research
Institute of Thailand.  To contact the reporter on this story:
