Italian borrowing costs rose at a
bond auction today as concern the  Federal Reserve  will begin
curbing its stimulus plan this year is damping demand for fixed-income assets.  The Treasury in Rome sold 3.5 billion euros ($4.59 billion)
of a new 2015 zero-coupon bond at 2.403 percent, the highest
since Sept. 25 and up from 1.113 percent at the previous auction
of similar-maturity debt May 28. Investors bid for 1.48 times
the amount offered, down from 1.57 times last month. The
Treasury also sold a total of 1 billion euros of inflation-linked bonds due in 2018 and 2026 to yield 2.91 percent and 3.75
percent respectively.  Market turmoil at the end of the first half is “normal”
and the  bond market  overreacted after Fed Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said bond buying may be scaled back this year if risks
to the  U.S. economy  continue to decrease, Italy debt agency head
Maria Cannata said at a conference in Rome yesterday. The
Treasury returns to the market tomorrow with the sale of 8
billion euros of bills.  To contact the reporter on this story:
