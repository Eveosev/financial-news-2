Palm oil advanced for the first time
in four days as exports from  Malaysia , the second-largest
producer, rose ahead of the Muslim fasting month of Ramadan.  The contract for September delivery climbed as much as 0.7
percent to 2,421 ringgit ($760) a metric ton on the Bursa
Malaysia Derivatives and was at 2,406 ringgit at 5:30 p.m. in
Kuala Lumpur. Futures closed at 2,404 ringgit yesterday, the
lowest price for the most-active contract since June 5. Palm for
local  physical delivery  in July was at 2,410 ringgit, data
compiled by Bloomberg show.  Shipments from Malaysia gained 9.6 percent to 1.17 million
tons in the first 25 days of June from the same period a month
earlier, Intertek said today. Consumption typically increases
ahead of Ramadan, which falls in July this year, when observers
break day-long fasts with communal meals.  “Because of Ramadan, you’ll see incremental demand coming
into the picture,” said Prathamesh Mallya, an analyst at
AnandRathi Commodities Ltd. in Mumbai.  Stockpiles of the most-used cooking oil are poised to jump
21 percent to a record 9.5 million tons in 2013-2014, U.S.
Department of Agriculture data show. Demand will advance 4.4
percent, the least in 12 years. Futures will drop 8.6 percent to
2,200 ringgit a ton by the end of December, a level last seen in
2009, according to the median of 13 trader, analyst and producer
estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  ‘The gains will be capped because the market still has to
live with the rising stocks,’’ Gnanasekar Thiagarajan, a
director at Commtrendz Risk Management Services Pvt. in Mumbai.
“So you wont have any kind of major rally.”  Soybean oil for December delivery rose 0.3 percent to 46.41
cents a pound on the Chicago Board of Trade, while soybeans for
delivery in November increased 0.4 percent to $12.7825 a bushel.  Refined palm oil for January delivery closed little changed
at 5,924  yuan  ($964) a ton on the Dalian Commodity Exchange,
while soybean oil climbed 0.8 percent to end at 7,438 yuan.  To contact the reporter on this story:
