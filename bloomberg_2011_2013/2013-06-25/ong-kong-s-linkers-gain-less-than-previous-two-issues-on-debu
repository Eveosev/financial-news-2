Hong Kong ’s inflation-linked bonds,
the third ever issue, gained less on the first day of trading
than the previous two offerings on speculation the city’s
inflation will ease because of  China ’s economic slowdown.  The price of the linkers due 2016 climbed 3.2 percent, Hong
Kong Stock Exchange data shows. Three-year inflation-linked debt
sold in 2011 rose 5.1 percent on debut, while similar-maturity
notes issued in 2012 advanced 5.3 percent. The yield on 10-year
U.S. Treasuries has  increased  15 basis points to 2.5 percent
since Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said June 19 the
central bank could rein in stimulus this year and end it in 2014.  Economic growth in  Asia ’s largest economy has remained
below 8 percent in the last four quarters, the first time that
has happened since at least 1994, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. China International Capital Corp. and Goldman Sachs
Group Inc. cut their 2013 expansion forecasts this week.
Inflation will be 4.5 percent this year in Hong Kong, compared
with 4.1 percent in 2012, a May 10 government forecast shows.  “China’s slower growth means easing inflationary pressure
for Hong Kong,” said  Castor Pang , head of research at Core
Pacific-Yamaichi in Hong Kong. “The potential tapering also
means the yield spread between U.S. and Hong Kong will narrow,
damping the attractiveness of the linkers.”  The government  received  HK$39.6 billion ($5.1 billion) of
subscriptions from 520,823 people for the HK$10 billion linker
sale this year, according to the Hong Kong Monetary Authority.
Interest will be paid every six months tied to a floating-rate
equivalent to the average change in the  consumer price index 
over the previous six months, or a 1 percent fixed rate,
depending on which is higher.  The city first sold inflation-linked debt to help citizens
preserve purchasing power as gains in consumer prices
accelerated. Demand surged at last year’s sale because of near-zero borrowing costs in the U.S., a policy the city has to
follow as its currency is pegged to the dollar.  To contact the reporter on this story:
