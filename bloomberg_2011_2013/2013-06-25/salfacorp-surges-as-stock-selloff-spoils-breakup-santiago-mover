Salfacorp SA (SALFACOR) ,  Chile ’s largest
engineering and construction company, jumped the most in almost
six years after its board canceled a plan to separate into two
smaller units amid an emerging-market selloff.  Salfacorp surged 12 percent to 675 pesos at 4:14 p.m. in
Santiago, the biggest increase on a closing basis since
September 2007. It was the biggest gainer on Chile’s benchmark
 Ipsa index , which advanced 1.1 percent.  The board canceled the breakup at a meeting today because
of “conditions in global and domestic markets,” according to a
regulatory filing. Santiago-based Salfacorp in March had
announced a plan to split off its real-estate investment unit
from its engineering and construction company.  “The market had punished Salfacorp’s stock price as
investors felt they would end up holding stakes in two smaller
companies,” Javier Gunther, an analyst at Santiago-based
brokerage IM Trust, said in a phone interview. The shares had
tumbled 38 percent this year through yesterday, the worst
performance on the Ipsa.  Under the company’s breakup plan, investors would have
received shares in both units, which would have been separately
listed on the Santiago exchange.  To contact the reporter on this story:
