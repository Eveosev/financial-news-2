verifying standard of goods entering country, Moses Kalule, CEO
of Kampala City Traders Association, says by phone.

per container depending on nature of goods: Kalule
* Strike to continue until “solution is found:” Kalule
* Levy introduced to curb entry of substandard imports, Sylvia
Kirabo, UNBS deputy spokeswoman, says by phone from Kampala
* Levy came into effect June 1: Kirabo
* UNBS staffs only 19 of 52 entry points; levy to be effective
in ensuring entry of high quality goods: Kirabo
*  Levy imposed on traders because it would be difficult to
trace foreign companies from which goods are imported: Kirabo  To contact the reporter on this story:
