Volkswagen AG (VOW) , Europe’s largest
carmaker, opened a $40 million logistics center in Roane County,
Tennessee, to reduce delivery times of components for the Passat
mid-sized sedan’s U.S. version.  The 459,000-square-foot (41,300-square-meter) complex is
starting as a redistribution center to serve warehouses and will
later expand to include spare-parts supply for more than 110
vehicle retailers in the southeast U.S., the Wolfsburg, Germany-based carmaker said today in a statement.  “This new facility serves as tangible proof of the clear
commitment that Volkswagen Group of America has to meeting the
needs of our dealers and our growing customer base,” Anu Goel,
vice president of parts and vehicle logistics at the
manufacturer’s U.S. division, said in the statement.  Growth in North America is critical to Chief Executive
Officer  Martin Winterkorn ’s strategy for VW to overtake  Toyota
Motor Corp. (7203)  and  General Motors Co. (GM)  and become the world’s
biggest carmaker by 2018. Volkswagen started making the Passat’s
U.S. variant in 2011 in Chattanooga, Tennessee. The company
plans to invest more than $5 billion in North America in new
models, technology and infrastructure in the three years through
2015.  VW already operates five parts warehouses in the U.S.  To contact the reporter on this story:
