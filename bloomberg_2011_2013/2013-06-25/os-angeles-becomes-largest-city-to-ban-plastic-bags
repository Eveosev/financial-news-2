Los Angeles  will become the most
populous U.S. city to outlaw plastic shopping bags, joining
 Seattle ,  San Francisco  and Westport, Connecticut, in concluding
that the environmental drawbacks of the sacks outweigh consumer
convenience.  The Los Angeles City Council voted 9-1 to require stores
that make more than $2 million a year or occupy retail space
measuring more than 10,000 square feet to phase out plastic bags
by Jan. 1; smaller stores will have until July 1, 2014. Paper
bags will be available for 10 cents, with proceeds going to the
stores.  The American Progressive Bag Alliance, a lobbying group for
the plastic-bag industry, said its members employ 30,800 people
in about 350 U.S. communities. The organization, which didn’t
immediately comment on today’s decision, said in a statement
after a preliminary vote last week that the ban sent a
“terrible message” to small businesses and manufacturers.  “Los Angeles is often a trendsetter,” Councilman Paul Koretz, who introduced the city ordinance, said in an interview.
“This could be a model for the rest of the country.”  A Chicago alderman has introduced a similar measure, while
a  New York  City councilman said he plans to introduce a proposal
this summer. Both cited pollution of waterways and public
spaces.  To contact the reporter on this story:
