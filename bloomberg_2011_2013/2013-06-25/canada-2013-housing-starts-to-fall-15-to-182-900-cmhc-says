Canada’s housing agency further
trimmed its forecast for housing  starts  this year amid modest
economic and employment growth.  The number of starts will drop 15 percent to 182,900 units,
Canada Mortgage & Housing Corp. said in a report today from
Ottawa, down from a May 6 forecast of 190,300 units.
Construction will increase 3.3 percent in 2014 to 188,900 units,
also less than the earlier prediction of 194,100 units.  Slow  output  and employment growth that started in the
second half of 2012 means housing demand has weakened, CMHC said
in the report, while  mortgage  rates remaining stable until
mid-2014 will encourage a rebound. The report cited risks such
as record consumer debts and a rising supply of units in some
markets, mirroring concerns expressed by the finance minister
and Bank of Canada Governor Stephen Poloz.  “Builders will be aware of the level of inventories of
multi-family units and react accordingly,” the report said.  Multiple-unit housing starts will drop 21 percent to
103,100 units this year and increase 3.3 percent to 106,500 next
year, the report said. Single-unit starts will fall 4.6 percent
to 79,800 this year and rise 3.3 percent to 82,400 next year.  Economic growth will slow to 1.6 percent this year from 2
percent last year and rebound to a 2.4 percent pace in 2014,
CMHC said. The agency forecasts that the five-year fixed
mortgage rate will average 5.28 percent this year and 5.53
percent next year.  Sales of existing homes will fall 2.2 percent in 2013 to
443,400 units before rising to 468,600 units next year, the
government-owned agency said. Home prices will rise 1.6 percent
to C$369,700 ($351,400) this year and gain 2.1 percent next year
to reach C$377,300.  To contact the reporters on this story:
