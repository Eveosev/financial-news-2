Walgreen Co. (WAG) , the largest U.S.
drugstore retailer, fell the most in a year and a half after
fiscal third-quarter profit trailed analysts’  estimates  because
of declining sales at established stores.  The  shares  tumbled 7.2 percent to $44.57 at 9:55 a.m. in
 New York  after dropping as much as 7.7 percent, the biggest
intraday decline since Dec. 21, 2011. Walgreen gained 30 percent
this year through yesterday, compared with a 10 percent increase
for the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index.  Excluding some items, profit in the quarter ended May 31
was 85 cents a share, the Deerfield, Illinois-based company said
today in a statement. The average of 19 analysts’ estimates
compiled by Bloomberg was 91 cents.  Sales at stores open at least 12 months dropped 3.9 percent
as Walgreen tries to win back customers after a contract dispute
with  Express Scripts Holding Co. (ESRX)  sent sales to rivals including
 CVS Caremark Corp. (CVS)  Walgreen has gotten back about 40 percent of
its customers since renewing its contract with  Express Scripts 
in September, according to David Magee, an analyst with  SunTrust
Banks Inc. (STI)  in Atlanta.  “We do not expect all of those former customers to return
to Walgreens,” Meredith Adler, an analyst at Barclays Plc in
New York, wrote in a note June 20. She rates the shares
equalweight, the equivalent of a  hold .  A reduction in promotions also hurt store traffic, Chief
Financial Officer Wade Miquelon told analysts today on a
conference call.  Walgreen said net income in the quarter increased 16
percent to $624 million, or 65 cents a share, from $537 million,
or 62 cents, a year earlier. Sales advanced 3.2 percent to $18.3
billion.  To contact the reporter on this story:
