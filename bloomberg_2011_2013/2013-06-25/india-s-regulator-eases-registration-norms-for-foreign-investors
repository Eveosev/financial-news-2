India ’s market regulator eased
registration rules for overseas investors and tightened share
buyback norms for companies.  Foreign investors will no longer need to have prior
registration to trade in India, the Securities & Exchange Board
of India said in a statement today after its board approved the
recommendations of a government panel. Companies will now have
to buy back a minimum 50 percent of shares of the targeted
amount, and the repurchase period has been brought down to six
months from one year, SEBI said in the statement. Companies will
also have to keep 25 percent of the repurchase amount in an
escrow account.  The move comes at a time when the nation’s currency is
trading near a record low and its current-account  deficit  is the
widest among BRIC countries. The nation is dependent on foreign
inflows to bridge this gap.  The board also approved changes to rules to allow
institutional investors, sub-accounts and qualified foreign
investors to be merged into a single category called foreign
portfolio investor.  To contact the reporter on this story:
