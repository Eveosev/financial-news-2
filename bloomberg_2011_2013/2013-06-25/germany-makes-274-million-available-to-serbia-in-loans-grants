Germany  pledged continued financial
and technical support for improving  Serbia ’s infrastructure and
administration as the Balkan nation prepares to start membership
talks with the European Union.  Germany will set aside 208.5 million euros ($274 million)
in soft loans and grants for Serbia in 2013, after providing 1.3
billion euros over the past 12 years, Anette Seidel, a director
at the German Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development,
told reporters in Belgrade today.  “The funds are available immediately and will be activated
for each project when it’s ready,” with a possible rollover
into 2014, Seidel said. The projects cover power and water
supply, waste management, financial services, loans for
entrepreneurs,  energy efficiency , communal heating, improvements
in public administration and the rule of law.  The EU will decide on June 28 whether to set a date for
starting membership talks with Serbia after its efforts to
normalize ties with its breakaway Kosovo province.  Loans with maturities of as long as 15 years and grace
periods of three to five years will go through Germany’s
development bank, Kreditanstalt fuer Wiederaufbau, said Juergen
Welschof, the bank’s representative in Serbia.  Interest rates  may vary depending on projects, “typically
between 2.5 and 3 percent, under the current market
conditions,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
