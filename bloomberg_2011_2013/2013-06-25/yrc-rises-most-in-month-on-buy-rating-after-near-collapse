YRC Worldwide Inc. (YRCW) , the trucker that
escaped bankruptcy twice in the last four years, jumped the most
in a month after Standpoint Research initiated coverage of the
stock with the only buy rating.  YRC  rose  15 percent to $25.70 at the close in  New York , the
biggest gain since May 15, after Standpoint’s Director of
Research, Ronnie Moas, wrote in a note that shares could double
by next year.  The trucker is poised to benefit as an improving economy
boosts shipping volumes and management works to cut costs, Moas
said. Before today, there were four sell and four hold
recommendations on the stock among analysts’  ratings  compiled by
Bloomberg.  “The company was left for dead,” Moas said in a phone
interview from  Miami Beach ,  Florida . “They were on the brink of
extermination. The gains you’ve seen today may be a drop in the
bucket compared to what you’ll see in the next few years.”  YRC has surged more than threefold this year compared to a
17 percent gain in the Standard & Poor’s Supercomposite Trucking
Index, which doesn’t include the Overland Park, Kansas-based
company.  To contact the reporter on this story:
