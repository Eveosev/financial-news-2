Italian  government bonds  fell,
pushing 10-year yields to the highest in almost four months, as
the nation’s borrowing costs increased when it sold 4.5 billion
euros ($5.89 billion) of debt.  Portuguese and Irish bonds also declined even after
European Central Bank President  Mario Draghi  said the region’s
economic outlook still warranted an accommodative monetary
policy. German bonds erased an earlier gain after a U.S. report
showed  consumer confidence  increased more than economists
forecast, damping demand for safer assets. Italy sold zero-coupon bonds due in 2015 as well as inflation-linked securities.  “The zero-coupon bond was priced at a very high yield but
it was not surprising given the past few days’ selloff,” said
Annalisa Piazza, an analyst at Newedge Group in  London . “The
market might have not liked it.”  Italy’s 10-year yield climbed four basis points, or 0.04
percentage point, to 4.87 percent as of 4:17 p.m. London time
after rising to 4.90 percent, the highest level since Feb. 27.
The 4.5 percent bond due in May 2023 dropped 0.315, or 3.15
euros per 1,000-euro face amount, to 97.525.  The Rome-based Treasury sold 3.5 billion euros of zero-coupon bonds at 2.403 percent, the highest since Sept. 25 and up
from 1.113 percent at the previous auction of similar-maturity
debt May 28. The Treasury also sold a total of 1 billion euros
of index-linked securities due in 2018 and 2026.  Portugal ’s  10-year yield  climbed eight basis points to 6.89
percent and Ireland’s rose three basis points to 4.29 percent.  ‘More Essential’  Draghi, speaking in Berlin, defended the ECB’s as-yet-unused Outright Monetary Transactions bond-purchase program,
signaling its presence may help ward off volatility.  “I would say that OMT is even more essential now as we see
potential changes in the monetary policy stance with associated
uncertainty in other jurisdictions of the integrated global
economy,” he said.  Current economic conditions don’t merit a change in the
ECB’s monetary-policy stance, Draghi said.  The Netherlands sold 6.1 billion euros of 1.25 percent
notes due in January 2019. The securities were priced to yield
1.392 percent, the Dutch State Treasury Agency said.  Germany ’s  10-year (GBTPGR10)  yield was little changed at 1.80 percent,
after dropping as much as five basis points. The rate climbed to
1.85 percent yesterday, the highest level since April 2012.  Italian bonds returned 0.4 percent this year through
yesterday, according to Bloomberg World Bond Indexes. Spanish
bonds gained 3.5 percent, while German bunds handed investors a
loss of 2.2 percent, the indexes show.  To contact the reporters on this story:
