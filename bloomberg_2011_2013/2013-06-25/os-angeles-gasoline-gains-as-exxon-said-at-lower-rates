Spot gasoline in  Los Angeles 
strengthened for the first time in four days as  Exxon Mobil
Corp. (XOM) ’s Torrance refinery was said to be running at about 66
percent capacity as the crude unit prepares to restart.  The 150,000-barrel-a-day Torrance plant in  Southern
California  is waiting to return parts of the crude unit, shut
since June 19, to service and will run at reduced rates until
the equipment is restarted, said the person, who asked not to be
identified because the information isn’t public. The unit, shut
last week to repair a metallurgical issue, is expected to take
about two days to return, the person said.  California-blend gasoline, or Carbob, in Los Angeles, rose
0.5 cent to a premium of 20 cents a gallon over futures traded
on the  New York Mercantile Exchange , according to data compiled
by Bloomberg at 4:11 p.m. New York time. Prompt-delivery of the
fuel climbed 0.27 cent to $2.9248 a gallon.  Gesuina Paras, an Exxon spokeswoman at the Torrance
refinery, declined by e-mail today to comment on the status of
the crude unit work. She said June 20 that other equipment at
the refinery would run at reduced rates during the repairs.  Tesoro Corp. (TSO) ’s 266,000-barrel-a-day Carson refinery in
Southern  California  was running normally yesterday after planned
maintenance, Tina Barbee, a spokeswoman at the company’s
headquarters, said by e-mail.  Carbob in San Francisco tumbled 7 cents to a premium of 8.5
cents a gallon, the lowest level in almost three weeks. The
 discount  for Carbob in  San Francisco  versus the fuel in Los
Angeles widened 7.5 cents to 11.5 cents a gallon.  Chevron Richmond  Chevron Corp. (CVX)  started a co-generation plant at the 240,000-barrel-a-day Richmond refinery in Northern California yesterday,
a notice to Contra Costa County regulators shows.  Tesoro’s 170,000-barrel-a-day Golden Eagle refinery near
San Francisco also reported a unit startup June 23, a separate
notice to the county shows. The plant was operating normally
today, Barbee said.  Retail gasoline  in California slipped 0.4 cent to $4.063 a
gallon, Heathrow, Florida-based AAA, the nation’s largest
motoring organization, said today on its website. Prices are up
from $3.845 a year ago.  The number of Californians traveling at least 50 miles for
the July 4 holiday is expected to decline to about 4.7 million
this year, a 0.7 percent drop from a year earlier, according to
AAA Northern California.  The premium for spot, conventional gasoline in  Portland ,
 Oregon , was unchanged at a premium of 15 cents a gallon.
Portland gasoline’s discount to Los Angeles Carbob widened 0.5
cent to 5 cents a gallon.  The  3-2-1 crack spread  of Alaska North Slope crude, Carbob
in Los Angeles and CARB diesel in Los Angeles narrowed a fourth
day, losing 17 cents to $17.43 a barrel at 4:13 p.m.  New York 
time. The spread, a rough indicator of short-term refining
margins, is down 47 percent from this year’s high of $32.74 a
gallon reached on June 19.  To contact the reporter on this story:
