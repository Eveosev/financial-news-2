Orange-juice  futures plunged,
heading for the biggest monthly slump in more than a year, on
signs of slowing demand in the U.S.  Retail sales of the juice fell 1.3 percent to 39.89 million
gallons (151 million liters) in the four weeks ended June 8, the
Florida Department of Citrus reported yesterday. U.S. consumers
paid $6.22 a gallon on average during the period, down 1.9
percent. Stockpiles in freezers last month rose 2 percent from
April to 1.04 billion pounds (471,736 metric tons),  U.S.
Department of Agriculture  data show.  “The cold-storage report and U.S. retail sales being down
are definitely contributing to the selloff,” Fain Shaffer, the
president of Infinity Trading Corp. in Medford,  Oregon , said in
a telephone interview.  Orange juice for September delivery tumbled 4.4 percent to
close at $1.342 a pound at 2 p.m. on ICE Futures U.S. in  New
York , the biggest decline for a most-active contract since March
1. Prices have dropped for seven straight sessions, the longest
slump since July, and are down 11 percent this month, which
would be the most since May 2012.  Earlier today, the commodity touched $1.3255, the lowest
for a most-active contract since April 1. Trading was 156
percent above the average for this time in the past 100 days,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Prices have tumbled as
much as 15 percent since touching a 13-month high on May 30,
after a drought and a citrus disease eroded prospects for the
orange crop in  Florida , the world’s second-largest producer.  Weather Risk  While fruit output will drop this year, juice supplies will
remain ample unless the state’s groves are hurt by severe
storms, Shaffer said. The  hurricane season  starts this month.  Weather models indicate a hurricane is unlikely until at
least late July, said Donald Keeney, a meteorologist at MDA
Information Systems Inc. in Gaithersburg,  Maryland . In the
season that started Oct. 1, Florida may collect 134 million
boxes of oranges, down from 146.7 million a year earlier, the
U.S. Department of Agriculture said June 12.  “A lot of funds are likely taking their profits and won’t
re-enter the market until we see a hurricane threat,” Shaffer
said.  Hedge funds  and other speculators cut their net-long
 position , or bets on price gains, by 9.3 percent in the week
ended June 21, government data show. A week earlier, the
holdings were the most-bullish since February 2012.  To contact the reporter on this story:
