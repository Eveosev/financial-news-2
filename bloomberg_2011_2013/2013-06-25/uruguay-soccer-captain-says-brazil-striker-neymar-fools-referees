Uruguay’s soccer team captain
cautioned officials in tomorrow’s game with Brazil that opposing
striker Neymar “can drop to the ground and fool the referee.”  The teams meet in the first semifinal of soccer’s
Confederations Cup, a warm up for next year’s  World Cup . Neymar,
21, has scored in every game as host Brazil completed a perfect
record in its three group games.  “Neymar is very lightweight, he can drop to the ground and
fool the referee,” Diego Lugano told reporters at the Mineirao
Stadium in Belo Horizonte. “Neymar can feign a foul so we must
be watchful that nobody’s fooled by his ability.”  According to soccer’s governing body Neymar has been fouled
18 times during the Confederations Cup. He scored a free kick in
the 4-2 victory over  Italy  on June 22 after being felled outside
the penalty area.  Brazil hasn’t lost a competitive game on home soil since
losing to Peru in  Belo Horizonte  in 1975. Uruguay defeated
Brazil in the final game of the 1950 World Cup in  Rio de
Janeiro .  To contact the reporter on this story:
