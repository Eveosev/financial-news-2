CaixaBank (CABK)  SA plans to sell
13.1 billion pesos ($990 million) of shares today in Grupo
Financiero Inbursa SAB, helping to bolster trading in the
Mexican lender controlled by the billionaire  Carlos Slim .  CaixaBank will sell as many as 482.6 million shares on the
Mexican stock exchange, including an overallotment option for
underwriters. With the so-called greenshoe option fully
exercised, CaixaBank’s stake would fall to 9 percent from 16.3
percent, bringing the public float to 34.5 percent of the total,
according to an investor presentation and offering prospectus.  Mexico’s market for equity issuance is adding to a record
pace even as the benchmark index heads for its worst month in
four years. Mexican companies have already raised a record $5.51
billion in the first six months of the year, with construction
company OHL Mexico SAB carrying out a 7 billion peso sale last
week as the IPC gauge plummeted 3.9 percent in a single day.  Inbursa’s average daily trading volume of 2.6 million
shares over the past three months is the lowest among four
financial-sector stocks on the IPC index even though it has the
highest market capitalization of the group after Grupo
Financiero Santander  Mexico  SAB, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  Inbursa shares have  retreated  31 percent this year,
compared with a 14 percent decline for the IPC.  CaixaBank is following Banco Santander SA and Banco Bilbao
Vizcaya Argentaria SA in selling Latin American assets to
replenish money lost amid Spain’s property crash.  To contact the reporter on this story:
