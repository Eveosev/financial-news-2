The coking coal  benchmark  contract
for the third quarter fell to $145 a metric ton, the lowest
level since 2009, when the terms were negotiated on an annual
basis, Doyle Trading Consultants said today.  BHP Billiton Ltd. (BHP) , the world’s biggest coking coal
exporter, agreed to a price 16 percent below that of the
previous quarter, according to the New York-based energy
research firm, which specializes in coal.  An 11 percent drop in the Australian dollar this year means
the country’s producers of the steelmaking component are
realizing a $9-per-metric-ton decline, compared with a $27 slide
in the U.S., DTC said today.  “Margins at U.S. suppliers are razor-thin, and any push
from buyers for discounts to the benchmark will be met with
production cuts,” Doyle said in a report.  Jennifer White, a BHP spokeswoman in  London , declined to
comment, citing company policy.  To contact the reporter on this story:
