Palm oil inventories are rising the
most since 1999 as demand expands at the slowest pace in more
than a decade, extending the year-long  bear market .  Stockpiles of the most-used cooking oil are poised to jump
21 percent to a record 9.5 million metric tons in 2013-2014,
U.S. Department of Agriculture data show. Demand will advance
4.4 percent, the least in 12 years. Futures will drop 8.8
percent to 2,200 ringgit ($685) a ton by the end of December, a
level last seen in 2009, according to the median of 13 trader,
analyst and producer estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  The oil used in everything from candy bars to biofuels
entered a bear market in June 2012 after prices that peaked at
4,486 ringgit in 2008 spurred farmers to expand output. The glut
is being compounded by surging supplies of competing soybean
oil, with U.S. growers poised to reap their biggest-ever crop
when the harvest starts in September. Cheaper palm cuts costs
for  Nestle SA (NESN)  and other foodmakers while crimping profit for
producers including  Felda Global Ventures Holdings Bhd. (FGV)   “You’ve got a lot of supply coming into the market,” said
Chris de Lavigne, a global vice president at  Frost & Sullivan  in
 Singapore  who advises the palm industry and has tracked edible
oils since 2006. “I’m particularly worried about the September
period,” he said, predicting that palm oil prices will drop as
low as 1,800 ringgit by the end of the year.  Soybean Oil  While prices are rallying now, they fell 20 percent to
2,412 ringgit on the Bursa  Malaysia  Derivatives in the past year
as the Chicago Board of Trade’s soybean oil futures declined 12
percent to 45.95 cents a pound ($1,013 a ton). The MSCI All-Country World Index of equities advanced 16 percent and a Bank
of America Corp. index shows Treasuries lost 2.3 percent.  Palm production,  accounting  for 35 percent of cooking oil
supply, will expand 5 percent to 58.1 million tons in 2013-2014,
USDA data show. Output doubled over the previous decade, led by
 Indonesia  and Malaysia. The predicted stockpiles are  equal  to 17
percent of demand, the highest level since 1989, data compiled
by Bloomberg show.  Supplies of  soybean oil , the second most-consumed edible
oil, will rise to a  record  for a fifth year and reach 44.6
million tons, the USDA predicts. It will average 43.50 cents in
the third quarter, Societe Generale SA estimates.  Palm rallied about 10 percent in six weeks, reaching a
three-month high of 2,491 ringgit on June 20, as buyers
accelerated purchases before the start of the Muslim holy month
of Ramadan in July. Stockpiles in Malaysia, the biggest producer
after Indonesia, fell for a fifth month in May, while remaining
1.7 percent higher than a year earlier, industry data show.  Listed Producer  Prices may advance to 2,600 ringgit in the next three
months, Mohd Bakke Salleh, chief executive officer of  Sime Darby
Bhd. (SIME) , told reporters in Kuala Lumpur on May 31. The company,
based in the city, is the biggest listed producer.  The wider discount to soybean oil may boost demand from
buyers that can switch between the products. Palm averaged
$317.09 a ton less since the start of the year, compared with
$201 in 2012, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Consumption may exceed the USDA’s forecast because of
rising demand from fuel producers. Brent crude oil averaged $108
a barrel since the start of January, 17 percent above the five-year average and increasing the attractiveness of biodiesel,
which can be made with edible oils. Global output of the
alternative fuel will rise 4.9 percent to 429,000 barrels a day
in 2013, the International Energy Agency estimates.  Industrial Users  Demand is threatened by slowing economies in some consuming
nations. While  India  will grow 5.1 percent this year, unchanged
from 2012, Indonesia’s expansion is set to drop to 6.1 percent
from 6.2 percent, according to economist estimates compiled by
Bloomberg. The  World Bank  cut its forecast for  China  to 7.7
percent from 8.4 percent this month.  While palm is produced year-round, supply typically
accelerates in the second half because of growing cycles.
Production in Malaysia increased in the third  quarter  each time
since 1989 and stockpiles expanded in all but one year, data
compiled by Bloomberg show.  The extra supply will come just as farmers in the U.S., the
largest soybean grower, start their harvest. They will reap 12
percent more, contributing to a 6.6 percent gain in global
output, according to the USDA. Inventories will jump 20 percent
to 73.7 million tons.  Instant Noodles  Record palm production is helping manufacturers because it
is used in everything from Nestle’s Maggi instant noodles to
Unilever’s soaps. Global  food  prices tracked by the  United
Nations ’ Food & Agriculture Organization are 9.5 percent below
the record reached in February 2011. The Rome-based group’s oils
and fat  index  dropped 15 percent in the past year.  Felda, which completed the world’s third-largest initial
public offering in 2012, will report an 11 percent drop in
profit to 716.8 million ringgit this year, according to the mean
of 19 analyst  estimates  compiled by Bloomberg. Shares of the
company fell 1.1 percent to 4.57 ringgit this year and will
decline to 4.09 ringgit in 12 months, according to the average
of 17 analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  Dorab Mistry, a director at Godrej International Ltd., is
bearish on prices after July. Mistry is known in the industry as
Mr. Titanic after he correctly compared vegetable oil prices to
the ill-fated liner in 1998.  “We will be closer to 2,000 ringgit at the end of the
year, unless we have a climatic problem somewhere,” said
Mistry, who has traded palm for about three decades. “You have
a huge amount of soft oils coming to the market.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
