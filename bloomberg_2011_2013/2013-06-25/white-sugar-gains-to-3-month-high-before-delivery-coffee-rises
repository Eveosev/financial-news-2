White, or refined, sugar climbed to
a three-month high in  London  on speculation about limited
supplies that can be delivered to NYSE Liffe when the August
contract expires next month. Coffee advanced.  The premium white sugar for August delivery commands over
the October futures more than doubled over the past week to
$27.50 a metric ton, data compiled by Bloomberg show. That
market structure, in which earlier contracts are priced higher
than later ones, is known as backwardation and may signal
limited supplies. The August contract expires on July 16.  “There are some concerns about deliverable supplies,”
Arthur Liming, a futures specialist at Citigroup Inc. in
 Chicago , said in a report e-mailed yesterday. There are
“concerns that deliveries from Thailand and  Mexico  will be
lighter than expected.”  White sugar for August delivery jumped 1.3 percent to
$517.50 a ton by 10:55 a.m. on NYSE Liffe in London, after
earlier today climbing to $518.50 a ton, the highest since March
26. Raw sugar for delivery in October gained 0.8 percent to
17.28 cents a pound on ICE Futures U.S. in New York.  The  premium  for white sugar over the raw variety gained to
$136.30 a ton, the highest for the most active contracts since
July 2. A week ago, the premium was $113.30 a ton. The white
premium and the structure of the white sugar market “persuades
us that white sugar is in deficit,” Robin Shaw, an analyst at
London-based broker Marex Spectron Group, wrote in a report
yesterday.  Price Gap  In New York, the price gap between raw sugar for July
delivery and the October contract widened after narrowing in the
past week. July futures were 0.17 cent a pound cheaper than
October futures compared with 0.13 cent a pound yesterday and
0.3 cent a pound a week earlier. The July futures expire on June
28.  Sugar cane growing areas in  Brazil , the world’s largest
producer, will get harvest-disrupting rain this week, Sao Paulo-based Somar Meteorologia said in a report e-mailed yesterday. A
cold front will bring plentiful rain from  Rio Grande  do Sul to
Mato Grosso do Sul and  Sao Paulo , complicating field work this
week, the weather forecaster said.  Robusta coffee for delivery in September gained 0.1 percent
to $1,763 a ton on NYSE Liffe. Arabica coffee for delivery in
September gained 0.7 percent to $1.21 a pound on ICE.  Cocoa for September delivery was unchanged at 1,428 pounds
($2,204) a ton in London. Cocoa for September delivery was up
0.3 percent to $2,155 a ton in  New York .  To contact the reporter on this story:
