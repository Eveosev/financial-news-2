South African wheat futures declined
the most in almost two weeks as the strengthening rand made
imports cheaper.  Wheat for delivery in July declined 1.8 percent to 3,530
rand ($354) a metric ton, the biggest drop since June 12, on the
South African Futures Exchange.  South Africa ’s currency strengthened against the dollar for
a third day, the longest streak on gains since April 25.  “The rand had something to do with today’s drop in wheat
prices,” Thys Grobbelaar, an analyst at Klerksdorp, South
Africa-based Senwes Ltd., said by phone today.  South  Africa , a net importer of wheat, is sub-Saharan
Africa’s largest producer of the grain after Ethiopia and the
region’s biggest importer after Nigeria and  Sudan , according to
U.S. Department of Agriculture data.  The nation imported 11,347 tons of wheat from  Australia  and
12,007 tons from Uruguay in the week to June 21, the South
African Grain Information Service said on its website.  White corn for delivery in July gained 0.2 percent to 2,300
rand a ton and the yellow variety increased 0.3 percent to 2,275
rand a ton.  To contact the reporter on this story:
