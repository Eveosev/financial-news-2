The Atlantic Coast Conference has
reached a six-year agreement with college football’s Pinstripe
Bowl, held annually at New York’s Yankee Stadium, to play a team
from the Big Ten conference in the postseason from 2014-19.  The Pinstripe Bowl announced an eight-year partnership with
the Big Ten earlier this month.  “The addition of the ACC to the New Era Pinstripe Bowl,
along with the Big Ten, will provide an annual matchup of some
of college football’s top-tier programs,” Yankees Managing
Partner  Hal Steinbrenner  said yesterday in a statement. “With
outstanding institutions all along the East Coast as well as the
Northeast, the ACC is an attractive participant and partner.”  Since the first Pinstripe Bowl in 2010, the postseason game
has featured teams from the Big East and Big 12. Syracuse
University, which moved to the ACC from the Big East this year,
played West Virginia University last season.  The 2013 Pinstripe Bowl, the final game before the
partnerships with the ACC and Big Ten take effect, will be held
Dec. 28 in the Bronx, New York, stadium.  As part of the agreements, the ACC and Big Ten will have
“significant branding presence” in Yankee Stadium, featuring
fixed signs along the first- and third-base lines and rotating
signage behind home plate, the Yankees said in a statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
