U.S. house prices  rose  7.4 percent
in the year through April, according to the  Federal Housing
Finance Agency , extending a rebound in real estate values as
buyers compete for a tight inventory of homes.  Prices  increased  0.7 percent on a seasonally adjusted basis
from March, the FHFA said in a report today from Washington. The
average economist estimate was for a 1.1 percent gain, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Property values are climbing as low borrowing costs and
rising  consumer confidence  lure buyers amid a small supply of
homes for sale. The  inventory  of homes on the market last month
was the lowest for any May since 2002, the National Association
of Realtors reported last week.  Mortgage rates  are on the rise, which may limit buyer
demand. The average rate for a 30-year fixed loan was 3.93
percent last week, up from 3.35 percent in May and a record low
3.31 percent reached in November, according to  Freddie Mac .  Prices increased 17.1 percent from a year earlier in the
Pacific area, which includes California and Oregon. In the
Mountain region, including Nevada and Arizona, the gain was
almost 15 percent, the FHFA said. The Middle Atlantic area --
New York, New Jersey and Pennsylvania -- had the smallest
increase, at 2.9 percent.  The FHFA index measures transactions for single-family
properties financed with mortgages owned or securitized by
 Fannie Mae  and Freddie Mac. The gauge is 11.7 percent below its
April 2007 peak.  To contact the reporter on this story:
