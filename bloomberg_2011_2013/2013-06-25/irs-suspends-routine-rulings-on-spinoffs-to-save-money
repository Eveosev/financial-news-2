The  Internal Revenue Service  will no
longer issue routine rulings on corporate transactions such as
spinoffs.  The IRS, in a notice issued today, cited a desire to
conserve resources. The agency said it will “rule only on
significant issues” raised by proposed transactions.  Companies pursuing spinoffs, reorganizations and other
maneuvers often submit the structure of their transactions to
the IRS, which then clears the deals as tax-free.  “Just about any ruling anyone would ask for would be a
comfort ruling” that provides an extra layer of certainty for
companies, said  Robert Willens , a New York-based corporate tax
adviser. “They feel like anyone should be able to consult the
law in the area and make that determination themselves.”  The new rules apply to transactions submitted after Aug.
23. They will affect spinoffs, reorganizations, liquidation of
subsidiaries and certain transfers of property.  The IRS had previously limited the types of letters it
would issue on spinoff transactions.  “This is just sort of the next logical step,” Willens
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
