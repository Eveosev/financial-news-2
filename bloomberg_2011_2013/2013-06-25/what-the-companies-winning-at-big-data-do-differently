Few industries illustrate the Big Data wars better than the media business. In TV programming, combatants like Netflix and Amazon challenge decades-old premium channels and other producers to gain watchers with original programming. Using their treasure troves of information on online customer viewing habits, they're designing new TV series that their data tells them will win. Early results show that it is working — and that many pre-Web media companies should be concerned. Netflix's first foray into original programming, the "House of Cards" series, has been a big hit (although the company doesn't disclose ratings). The company says the series brought in 2 million new U.S. subscribers in the first quarter of 2013, a 7% increase over the previous quarter. The company's chief content officer said in February that Netflix uses "really big data" to pick which shows to produce and how to promote them. Yet Netflix's debut as a producer also demonstrates something far more important: how Big Data can fundamentally change the structure of an industry by shifting the balance of power. The Big Data wars are hardly limited to the media industry. In December 2012 and January of this year, Tata Consultancy Services  surveyed 1,217 executives  from large companies (revenue of more than $1 billion) in a dozen global industries in North America, Europe, Asia-Pacific, and Latin America. We found that companies with huge investments in Big Data are generating excess returns and gaining competitive advantages, putting companies without significant investments in Big Data at risk. The reason: There's a big learning curve with Big Data, one that companies such as Netflix and Amazon had to embrace in the 1990s to deal with hundreds of millions of customer clicks.  It's a learning curve that most other large companies have not yet faced. So what differentiated the companies with the greatest expected returns on Big Data for 2012 from those with the smallest? We categorized as "leaders" survey respondents that estimated a greater than 50% return on their Big Data investments last year (a number far above most companies' hurdle rate). Although they tended to make much larger investments in Big Data, they also generated much higher returns on those investments than the laggards did. Higher spending correlates with more headroom for revenue growth.  Specifically, our study found that the companies estimating the greatest returns last year on Big Data outspent those with much smaller ROI by a factor of more than three — a median spend of $24 million vs. $7 million. Of the 53% of the survey respondents that had Big Data initiatives in 2012, median spending per company was $10 million, a relatively small amount given that median revenue was $6.9 billion. But that median spending masks a great polarity in Big Data investments — a huge gulf between companies that have embraced it and those that are slow to adopt.  A narrow slice of the respondents (7%) with Big Data initiatives in 2012 invested at least $500 million each on Big Data software, hardware, data scientists, consultants and other related expenses. On the other end of the spectrum, 24% spent less than $2.5 million apiece on it last year.  Of course, simply spending more is not a strategy. How else did the companies projecting the greatest ROI from Big Data differ from underperformers? We found four key differences: Companies still dabbling in "small data" would be well-advised to make serious changes or risk losing to those that have adopted Big Data in a big way.
