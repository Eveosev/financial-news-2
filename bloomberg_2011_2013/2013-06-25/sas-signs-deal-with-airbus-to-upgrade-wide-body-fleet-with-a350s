SAS Group (SAS)  agreed to buy 12 new
Airbus SAS long-range jets valued at $3.3 billion as the Nordic
region’s largest airline seeks to upgrade aging aircraft with
more efficient models.  SAS is looking to add eight A350-900s starting in 2018 and
four A330-300s from 2015, to upgrade its fleet of A330s and
A340s, the Stockholm-based airline said in a statement today.
The purchase, once final, will be financed by export credit
facilities and sale and leasebacks agreements. Aircraft
customers typically buy at a discount to list prices.  The airline has pursued asset disposals and job cuts as it
seeks to return to profit and fend off rivals including low-cost
carrier  Norwegian Air Shuttle ASA (NAS) , which is buying  Boeing Co. (BA) 
787 Dreamliners, and network long-haul operators. The new
aircraft will make SAS more competitive and help cut fuel costs,
Chief Finance Officer  Goran Jansson  said today.  “It was due time to take a decision to clear some question
marks when it comes to cost level and competitiveness in terms
of look and feel on the plane, also to get delivery positions on
new aircraft,” Jansson said in a telephone interview. “The
restructuring plan is a prerequisite to enable us to do this.”  The company’s 4Excellence Next Generation plan, introduced
in November, aims to deliver 3 billion kronor ($450 million) in
savings over the next two years. SAS is targeting earnings
before interest and tax of  more than 3 percent of sales,
assuming stable fuel prices and no external shocks.  Lease Expiry  The airline plans to replace its older A340s and A330s as
their leases expire and is looking to firm up the order “in the
next couple months,” Jansson said. SAS owns half of its fleet
and leases the remainder, a mixture that it plans to keep, the
executive said.  SAS currently operates 19 A320s single-aisle aircraft, four
A330s and seven A340s, according to Airbus. As many as seven of
the airline’s A330s and A340s will be fitted with new seats and
entertainment systems by the end of 2015, the carrier said.  The A350 aircraft is Airbus’s newest model and made its
maiden flight this month. Airbus has stopped making the four-engine A340, and airlines are looking for ways to cut their fuel
bills, the single largest expense for most carriers. Prior to
the  Paris Air Show  that wrapped up last week, Airbus had 613
firm orders for the A350.  The A350 can seat 270 to 350 passengers and uses 25 percent
less fuel than other similarly sized aircraft, according to
Airbus. The A330 seats between 250 and 300 people.  To contact the reporter on this story:
