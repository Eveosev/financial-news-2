Sunrun Inc. , a closely held rooftop
solar power provider, won financing from investors including
JPMorgan Chase & Co. to install more than $630 million of
residential systems.  Sunrun, which purchases and installs solar power equipment
for homes and then sells the output to homeowners under 20-year
lease agreements, now has commitments to finance more than $2
billion in projects, co-founder and co-chief executive officer
Ed Fenster said today in a statement.  SunRun, based in San Francisco, also hired Citigroup Inc.â€™s
Jason Cavalierre as vice president of project finance to help
expand low-cost financing for solar systems.  To contact the reporter on this story:
