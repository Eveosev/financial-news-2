Monthly wheat shipments from  Russia ,
the world’s fifth-biggest  wheat exporter , will be lower than in
the last two years as the country can’t rely on purchases from
top buyer  Egypt , according to Moscow-based ZAO Rusagrotrans.  Russia’s monthly grain shipments won’t exceed 3 million
metric tons during the new season that starts on July 1, said
Igor Pavensky, head of the analytical department at
Rusagrotrans, the nation’s biggest carrier of cereals by rail.
The largest monthly shipment this season was about 3.2 million
tons in September, compared with a record 3.8 million tons in
September 2011, according to the company’s data.  “Egypt’s readiness to buy grain on tenders is a very
significant factor for us,” Pavensky said. “How high Russia’s
monthly exports may be depend on that. There is still
uncertainty about Egypt’s international purchases.”  Egypt usually accounts for half of Russia’s grain exports
in the September through November period, Pavensky said. The
North African country, the Arab world’s most populous nation,
has struggled to pay for food as foreign currency reserves
dwindled and the country faced political upheaval and social
unrest following the 2011 ouster of former President  Hosni
Mubarak . Egypt last bought wheat through an international tender
on Feb. 20 and has held talks with countries from Kazakhstan to
the U.S. about supplies.  Wheat for September delivery rose 0.4 percent to $6.9025 a
bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade by 9:15 a.m. The grain is
down 11 percent this year.  Carryover Stocks  Russia’s carryover grain stocks, smaller than a year
earlier, will also constrain exports from the start of the
season on July 1, Pavensky said.  The country’s grain exports are seen at 1.8 million to 2
million tons in July, down from 2.06 million tons in the same
month last year and 2.5 million tons in 2011, he said. Carryover
stocks are seen at 9.4 million tons by July 1, the smallest
amount since 2007-08, according to Rusagrotrans data.  “We used to export carryover stocks in July in the past
two years,” Pavensky said. “This time, we will start exporting
grain of the new harvest only. This means Russia will have a
weaker competitive position next month and Ukraine and  France 
can benefit from this situation.”  Rusagrotrans estimates the national grain crop will be at
least 97 million tons in 2013-14, up from 70.9 million tons in
2012-13 because of stronger winter crops and a larger planting
area under spring crops, Pavensky said.  That will see exports jump to more than 23 million tons of
grain and legumes from an estimated 16.2 million tons this
season. Wheat exports will be 17 million tons, up from about 11
million tons in 2012-13. Barley exports may rise to 3 million
tons from about 2.3 million tons this season, and corn exports
may rise to at least 2.5 million tons from 1.9 million tons, he
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
