British Airways will start testing
an electronic baggage tag to speed passenger check-in times and
eliminate the need to print out a paper versions.  The suitcase tag contains information such as the
destination airport, and passengers that have checked in can
hold their smartphone over the tag to display flight
information. The tag is then scanned where bags are dropped off.  British Airways estimates the new system can cut baggage
drop-off times to about 35 seconds from the 3 minutes it
routinely takes now. Airlines have been looking to cut costs and
speed the processing of passengers through services such as
online check-in with boarding passes displayed on smartphones.  Paper tickets will still be offered, although the
electronic tag is designed to require only a hand-held scanner
so the service can be provided at any airport, said  Michael
Johnson , a spokesman for the London-based carrier. The tags will
be usable only on BA flights, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
