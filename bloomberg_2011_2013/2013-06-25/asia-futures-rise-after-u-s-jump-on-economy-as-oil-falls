Asian equity futures rose, tracking
a rebound in U.S. stocks after better-than-estimated data
bolstered the outlook for the world’s largest economy and
concern over China’s cash crunch eased. Crude oil fell the first
day this week and copper futures declined.  Futures due in September on  Japan ’s Nikkei 225 Stock
Average, which closed at 13,170 in  Chicago  and 12,940 in Osaka,
were bid in the pre-market at 13,200 by 8:05 a.m. local time.
Contracts on Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index gained 1 percent, while
S&P/ASX 200 Index futures climbed 0.6 percent in Sydney.
 Standard & Poor’s 500 Index (SPX)  futures were little changed, after
the gauge rose 1 percent in New York after a 1.2 percent slump
June 24. The dollar strengthened against other major currencies
including the yen. Copper futures lost 0.3 percent.  Almost a week after the Federal Reserve said an improving
economy could spur reductions in stimulus, data in the U.S.
showed durable goods bookings climbed in May and house prices,
new-home sales and consumer confidence beat economists’
estimates. Chinese stock volatility is the highest since 2011,
while the People’s Bank of China said in a statement late
yesterday it will use tools to ensure money-market stability and
that the shortage of cash will abate.  “The whole story over the last few weeks has been a better
U.S. economy than people expected,”  Michael Shaoul , Chairman
and CEO of Marketfield Asset Management LLC where he helps
manage the MainStay Marketfield  fund  that beat 96 percent of its
peers in the past five years, told Bloomberg TV. “That is
ultimately going to be good for the equity market.”  ‘Digesting’ Fed  The S&P 500 rebounded from the lowest close in nine weeks.
The index has climbed 11 percent this year and is up 1.2 percent
for the quarter and down 2.6 percent in June, poised for its
worst month in more than a year.  Global stocks retreated June 24 as Chinese equities entered
a bear market amid concern a cash crunch will hurt growth in
Asia’s largest economy.  China’s  CSI 300 Index (SHSZ300)  closed down 0.3 percent yesterday
after losing as much as 6.8 percent, while the Bloomberg China-US Equity Index of the most-traded Chinese stocks in New York
rose 1.9 percent. Futures on the Hang Seng China Enterprises
Index of mainland Chinese stocks traded in Hong Kong added 1.2
percent today, rising for the first time in six days.  “People are still digesting the news from the Fed, making
mental adjustments for different levels of interest rates and
what those might imply for securities’ prices over the next
several quarters,” John Carey, a fund manager at Boston-based
Pioneer Investment Management Inc., said by phone yesterday. His
firm oversees about $208 billion. “I’m encouraged the market
has stabilized a little here,” he said. “It’s not a robust
recovery of share prices but it’s at least a little bit of
improvement after last week.”  Housing Data  The U.S. durable-goods data showed that excluding
transportation equipment, where demand is volatile month to
month, orders advanced 0.7 percent, topping projections. A
separate report showed the S&P/Case-Shiller index of home values
for 20 cities climbed 12.1 percent for the year ended April, the
most since March 2006, after a 10.9 percent gain in March.  Sales of new U.S. homes in May rose to the highest level in
almost five years, gaining 2.1 percent to an annualized pace of
476,000 homes to exceed all estimates in a Bloomberg survey of
analysts, Commerce Department figures showed. The Conference
Board’s index of U.S.  consumer confidence  increased to 81.4 in
June from 74.3 a month earlier.  Chinese Options  The MSCI  Emerging Markets  Index rebounded from a one-year
low, rising 0.3 percent, while MSCI’s Asia Pacific Index ended
yesterday 0.6 percent lower. The regional benchmark is trading
at a valuation of 11.5 times projected earnings, the cheapest
level since November, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  The Chinese central bank’s statement came hours after Ling Tao, deputy director of the Shanghai branch of the PBOC, said
officials will closely monitor the money-market rate and keep it
at reasonable levels.  Ling is the first PBOC official to discuss publicly the
increase in rates since a cash squeeze helped send the overnight
repurchase rate to a record last week. Premier Li Keqiang is
seeking to wring speculative lending out of the nation’s banking
system after credit expansion outpaced economic growth.  The cost to protect against swings in Chinese stocks for a
month is surging versus longer-dated options as policy makers
sacrifice growth to make the economy less reliant on credit.  Implied volatility for  one-month contracts  on the iShares
FTSE  China  25 Index exchange-traded fund has climbed 41 percent
in the past two weeks to 32.6 yesterday, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg on options that can be exercised near the
ETF’s current level. That compares with a 9.8 percent gain to 26
for 12-month contracts, the widest gap since November 2011.  Treasuries Slip  Yields on 10-year U.S. Treasuries climbed from a record-low
1.379 percent set July 25, 2012 to 2.6 percent in New York. The
five-year average is 2.75 percent. Volatility in Treasuries as
measured by the Bank of America Merrill Lynch MOVE index climbed
to 110.98 June 24, the most since November 2011. The daily
average this year is 61.54.  Volatility in currencies has surged since the Fed signaled
June 19 that it may start reducing stimulus this year and stop
the quantitative easing program in 2014. JPMorgan Chase & Co.’s
 Group of Seven Volatility Index , based on currency option
premiums, was at 11.52 percent yesterday after rising to 11.96
percent June 24, the highest level since January 2012.  Yen, Kiwi  The yen weakened 0.3 percent to 98.12 per dollar and lost
0.3 percent to 128.31 against the euro. The Dollar Index, which
measures the U.S. currency against six major peers, climbed for
a fifth day, rallying 0.2 percent yesterday.  The Australian dollar was little changed at 92.56 U.S.
cents, while New Zealand’s currency fell 0.1 percent to 77.34
cents. The so-called kiwi is still too strong as the pickup in
the U.S. economy has taken longer than expected, New Zealand
Finance Minister Bill English said in a Bloomberg TV interview.
The currency has dropped more than 10 percent since peaking
above 86 cents April 11.  Crude declined 0.3 percent to $95.07 a barrel, after rising
0.2 percent yesterday. Platinum slipped 0.2 percent while
palladium fell the same amount. Gold was little changed at
$1,275.40 an ounce after retreating 0.2 percent yesterday.
Morgan Stanley joined banks including Goldman Sachs Group Inc.
and UBS AG in lowering its forecasts for gold on prospects the
Fed will scale back monetary stimulus and as the U.S. economic
recovery dims the precious metal’s appeal as a safe haven.  Orange juice  futures (NKA)  for September delivery sank 4.4
percent in U.S. hours, the biggest decline for a most-active
contract since March 1 and headed for the biggest monthly slump
in more than a year on signs of slowing demand in the U.S.  To contact the reporters on this story:
