Ethanol fluctuated against gasoline
on speculation demand for the biofuel will climb while
stockpiles are at seasonal record lows.  The spread, or price difference, widened 0.13 cent to 29.79
cents a gallon at 11:13 a.m.  New York  time as the  four-week
average of gasoline  demand has increased 6 percent from this
year’s low in January, data from the Energy Information
Administration show. Ethanol is blended with the motor fuel to
meet federal mandates and stretch supply.  “Gasoline production should continue to ramp up, so that
points to a little more demand,” said Mike Blackford, a
consultant at INTL FCStone in Des Moines,  Iowa . “Stockpiles are
pretty low.”  Denatured ethanol for July delivery rose 0.9 cent, or 0.4
percent, to $2.45 a gallon on the Chicago Board of Trade. Prices
are up 12 percent this year.  Gasoline for July delivery gained 1.03 cent, or 0.4
percent, to $2.7479 a gallon on the New York Mercantile
Exchange. The contract covers reformulated gasoline, made to be
blended with ethanol before delivery to filling stations.  Ethanol-blended gasoline made up about 94 percent of the
total U.S. gasoline pool in the week ended June 14, data from
the EIA, the Energy Department’s analytical arm, show.  Fuel Output  Production of the biofuel fell 1.2 percent to 873,000
barrels a day, the first back-to-back decline since March and
down 3 percent from a year earlier, according to EIA.  Stockpiles of the fuel gained 2.9 percent to 16.5 million
barrels, the EIA’s report showed. That’s down 22 percent from a
year earlier.  Blackford said ethanol production may decline during the
latter part of July and August as corn supply becomes tighter
before this year’s harvest and plants perform routine
maintenance.  Corn for July delivery climbed 1.75 cents to $6.55 a bushel
in  Chicago . The corn crush spread, or the cost difference
between a gallon of ethanol and the corn needed to make it, was
7 cents at 11:36 a.m., up 1 cent from yesterday, data compiled
by Bloomberg show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
