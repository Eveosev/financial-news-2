Newcrest Mining Ltd. (NCM) , the gold
producer facing regulatory scrutiny over its disclosure of a
possible A$6 billion ($5.5 billion) writedown, appointed a
former chairman of the Australian Securities Exchange to review
its practices.  Maurice Newman, who stepped down as  ASX Ltd. (ASX)  chairman in
2008, will act as an independent adviser to examine the
company’s disclosure and investor relations, the company said
today in a statement. He will report on his findings to the
Melbourne-based gold producer’s board as soon as possible, it
said.  “The board will consider all findings and recommendations
of the review,” Newcrest Chairman Don Mercer said in the
statement. “If steps are required to be taken as a result of
the review of these matters, the board will ensure that this
occurs without delay.”  The Australian Securities and Investments Commission is
discussing the fall in Newcrest’s share price ahead of its June
7 announcement that it expected to take a writedown on its
assets, cut jobs and trim spending. Newcrest has said it did not
selectively brief analysts ahead of the announcement.  The company is cutting about 150 jobs at its Lihir mine in
Papua New Guinea as part of its response to the plunge in
bullion prices, it said earlier today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
