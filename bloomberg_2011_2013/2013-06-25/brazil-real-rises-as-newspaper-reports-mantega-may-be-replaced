Brazil’s real climbed for a third
day as Valor Economico reported that Finance Minister  Guido
Mantega  may be replaced, spurring speculation that a new
economic team will help promote growth.  The currency appreciated 0.6 percent to 2.2129 per  U.S.
dollar  at 9:57 a.m. in Sao Paulo, paring its quarterly drop to
8.6 percent. The central bank sold $3.3 billion in currency
swaps today to support the real. Swap rates on contracts due in
January 2015 fell 12 basis points, or 0.12 percentage point, to
9.94 percent, reducing their increase since the end of March to
145 basis points.  President Dilma Rousseff is considering replacing Mantega
with central bank president Alexandre Tombini, Valor reported,
without saying where it got the information.  Henrique Meirelles 
may return to his former post as head of the monetary authority,
according to the newspaper.  Finance Ministry  and central bank
officials declined to comment.  “Today, we have these rumors of a change in Rousseff’s
economic team,” Joao Junior, a fixed-income trader at Icap in
Sao Paulo. “Meirelles is the man of the market, and foreign
investors would see that positively.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
