One-pieces and more modest bikinis have taken over the swimsuit scene in the past few years, and we're loving it. Yes, the cuts are more forgiving. But more importantly, it means you can head out for a midday piña colada without a full-on wardrobe change—or, in some cases, without dealing with any cover-ups at all. Let's be honest: These high-waisted bottoms aren't much different than a pair of hot pants. Toss on a T-shirt, and you're good to go.  Tori Praver;  Kenny Bottom , $101;  Kenny Top , $106 We might wear this Brazilian-designed one-piece with a skirt and go dancing at night, even if there weren't a beach in sight. It's metallic, it's blousy, it's a halter top—what else do you need?  Plush Swimwear;  Lenny Swimwear Leather Collar Maillot , $225 On a steamy summer day, this could almost pass for a dress—even in the city. Urban Outfitters;  Lolli Peplum one piece , $100 Tiered ruffles hide a belly, plus add just enough detail to look like a regular top. Nordstrom;  Magic Suit ,  $114 So sweetly retro. We'd add a floppy hat and espadrilles, if we're feeling fancy. Anthropologie;  Costa Tropical Bikini  top, $98; bottoms, $88 This is essentially a romper that's tighter and water-friendly. Throw on sunglasses and sandals, and you're set.  Anthropologie;  Sweetheart Maillot , $148 The skirt here provides just enough coverage to feel comfortable hopping on a beachside bar stool—ideally, with your toes dipped in the sand.  J. Crew;  Skirted Twist Bandeau Tank , $118 More from Condé Nast Traveler:
