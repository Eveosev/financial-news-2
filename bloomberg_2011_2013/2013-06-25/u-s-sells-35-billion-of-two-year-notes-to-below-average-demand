A U.S. sale of $35 billion of two-year notes drew weaker-than-average demand that almost matched
the lowest level since 2011 after economic data bolstered the
case for the  Federal Reserve  to reduce monetary stimulus.  The  bid-to-cover  ratio, which gauges demand by comparing
total bids with the amount of securities offered, was 3.05 at
yesterday’s auction, compared with an average of 3.63 for the
past 10 sales. It was 3.04 at the May offering, the lowest since
February 2011. The yield at the sale yesterday was 0.430
percent, the highest since May 2011, exceeding the forecast in a
Bloomberg survey of seven Fed primary dealers for 0.423 percent.  “It’s fair to say that people were less than willing to
step up and provide sponsorship for the auction,” said  Ian Lyngen , a government-bond strategist at CRT Capital Group LLC in
 Stamford ,  Connecticut . Overall demand was “relatively
lackluster,” he said.  The  current  two-year note yield climbed two basis points,
or 0.02 percentage point, to 0.41 percent yesterday in  New York ,
according to Bloomberg Bond Trader data. The price of the 0.25
percent note due in May 2015 declined 1/32, or 31 cents per
$1,000 face amount, to 99 22/32.  Treasuries fell yesterday as reports showed gains in U.S.
new-home sales, durable-goods orders and  consumer confidence .
Fed Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said last week policy makers may
reduce bond buying under their quantitative-easing stimulus
strategy this year and end it in mid-2014 if economic growth is
in line with their projections.  Fed Forecasts  Bernanke spoke to reporters June 19 after a two-day meeting
of the  Federal Open Market Committee . Policy makers are
forecasting growth of as much as 2.6 percent this year and 3.5
percent in 2014.  The Fed has been buying $85 billion of bonds
every month to put downward pressure on borrowing costs in its
third round of asset purchases since 2008.  Indirect bidders , an investor class that includes foreign
central banks, bought 35.8 percent of the two-year notes, the
most since February 2012. That compared with an average 23.8
percent at the past 10 offerings.  Direct bidders , non-primary-dealer investors that place
their bids directly with the Treasury, bought 7.8 percent, the
fewest since April 2012, versus an average of 24.8 percent at
the past 10 sales.  Two-year notes have lost 0.1 percent this year through June
24, versus a drop of 2.9 percent by the broad Treasuries market,
according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch indexes. Two-year
securities returned 0.2 percent in 2012, while Treasuries
overall gained 2.2 percent.  The auction was the first of three note offerings this week
totaling $99 billion. The government will sell $35 billion in
five-year debt today and $29 billion in seven-year securities
tomorrow.  The sales will raise $40.7 billion of new cash, as maturing
securities held by the public total $58.3 billion, according to
the  U.S. Treasury .  To contact the reporter on this story:
