Bank of England Governor  Mervyn King 
said Jane Austen is a “clear candidate” to appear on the next
U.K. 10-pound note.  King said the early 19th-century novelist, the author of
“Pride and Prejudice” and “Emma,” is “quietly waiting in
the wings” to be on the next note. She was a backup figure in
case of any problems with a new 5-pound note that will feature
World War II Prime Minister  Winston Churchill , he said.  “Anytime we produce a note, there are two notes in
parallel, the figure we are actually using and a reserve figure
if there are technical problems,” King told lawmakers in London
today. “That second figure often becomes the figure on the
following note.”  “The  Jane Austen  note has been up and running internally
for two years,” King said. “She is clearly a candidate for the
10-pound note down the road.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
