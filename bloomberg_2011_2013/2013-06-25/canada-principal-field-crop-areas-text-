Following is the text of the
field crop areas report according to  Statistics Canada :  As of June 10, 2013, farmers had either planted, or
intended to plant, larger areas of spring wheat, durum wheat and
oats than in 2012, but fewer acres of canola and barley. Farmers
also reported seeding record areas of corn and soybeans.  At the time of the survey, farmers reported that seeding
was well underway and conditions were relatively normal compared
with past years. However, some areas were not yet seeded because
of excess moisture.  Wheat  At the national level, total wheat area increased 9.3% from
2012 to 25.9 million acres in 2013. Spring wheat acreage
accounted for most of the advance, up 12.6% to 19.1 million
acres. Durum wheat increased 4.3% to 4.9 million acres.  In Saskatchewan, spring wheat acreage rose 14.4% to 9.7
million acres, while durum wheat was up 4.0% to 4.3 million
acres. Spring wheat area also increased in Manitoba (+19.3% to
2.9 million acres) and  Alberta  (+7.3% to 6.2 million acres).  Canola  Producers reported 19.7 million acres seeded in canola,
down 8.3% from 2012. This would represent the first decrease in
canola acres seeded at the national level since 2006.  Saskatchewan was the largest contributor to the national
decline, with canola acreage falling 8.0% to 10.3 million acres.
Seeding was also down in Alberta (-6.5% to 6.1 million acres)
and Manitoba (-12.2% to 3.1 million acres) compared with 2012.  Barley and oats  In line with results from the March 2013 Farm Survey on
seeding intentions, Canadian farmers reported seeding fewer
acres of barley, down 3.1% from 2012 to 7.2 million acres.  At the same time, land seeded to oats increased 18.1% to
3.4 million acres in 2013.  Corn for grain  Nationally, farmers reported seeding a record corn for
grain area of 3.6 million acres, up 2.9% from 2012.  Quebec  farmers planted 1.0 million acres of corn for grain,
up 6.6% from 2012. However, the largest percentage increase came
in Manitoba, where farmers reported a record corn for grain area
of 365,000 acres, up 21.7% from 2012.  In Ontario, corn for grain seeded declined 1.6% to 2.2
million acres.  Soybeans  At the national level, soybean area rose 10.5% from 2012 to
a record 4.6 million acres in 2013. This advance was mainly the
result of a higher soybean area in Manitoba (+35.6%), where
farmers reported seeding a record 1.1 million acres. This was
the sixth consecutive increase in soybean area in Manitoba.  Soybean area also rose in Quebec, up 3.0% or 21,000 acres
to 712,900 acres.  In Ontario, farmers reported a 1.5% decrease to 2.6 million
acres.  Note to readers  The June Farm Survey, which collects information on crop
seeded areas in  Canada , was conducted between May 27 and June 10,
2013, with approximately 25,000 farmers. They were asked to
report their seeded areas of grain, oilseeds and special crops.  June seeded acres are subject to updates from subsequent
surveys during the current crop year. Data on final acreages for
2013 will be released on December 4, 2013 and may be subject to
revision for two years.  To contact the reporter on this story:
