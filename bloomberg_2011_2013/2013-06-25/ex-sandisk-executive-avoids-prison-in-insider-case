Former  SanDisk Corp. (SNDK)  executive
Donald Barnetson was sentenced to probation for passing
nonpublic information to hedge fund consultant John Kinnucan,
U.S. prosecutors said.  Barnetson, 39, was sentenced today in federal court in  New
York  to one year of probation and was also ordered to pay a
$4,000 fine, said Jerika Richardson, a spokeswoman for U.S.
Attorney Preet Bharara in  Manhattan .  The former marketing director for Milpitas, California-based SanDisk, who was cooperating with the government, pleaded
guilty to one count of conspiracy to commit securities and wire
fraud in February 2012. He faced as long as five years in prison
at his sentencing today before U.S. District Judge Kimba Wood.  Kinnucan, who refused to cooperate in an insider-trading
probe, pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy and two counts
of  securities fraud  and was sentenced in January to four years
and three months in prison. Prosecutors said Kinnucan, the
founder of Broadband Research LLC, used financial incentives and
expensive meals to curry favor with corporate insiders,
including Barnetson, and gain access to non-public information.  The case is U.S. v. Barnetson, 1:12-cr-00157, U.S. District
Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
