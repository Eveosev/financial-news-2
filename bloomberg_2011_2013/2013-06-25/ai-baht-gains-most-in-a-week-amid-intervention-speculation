Thailand’s baht gained the most in a
week amid concern the central bank will step in to halt declines
that sent it to a nine-month low.  Government bonds  climbed.  The Bank of Thailand will intervene to curb excessive
volatility if needed, Deputy Governor Pongpen Ruengvirayudh said
on June 20. Her comments came after Governor Prasarn
Trairatvorakul said June 13 the bank sold “a certain amount of
dollars.” The baht reached 31.25 per dollar on June 21, the
weakest since Sept. 7. Official data showed global funds pulled
a net $2 billion from Thai bonds and equities this month through
yesterday on concern the  Federal Reserve  may trim the stimulus
that has fueled demand for emerging-market assets.  “Concern about intervention is leading to some rebound in
the baht,” said Tohru Nishihama, an economist covering  emerging
markets  at Dai-ichi Life Research Institute Inc. in Tokyo. “But
downward pressure on the baht and other assets as well as fund
outflow pressure continue as the situation surrounding emerging
markets hasn’t changed.”  The baht advanced 0.3 percent to 31.02 per dollar as of
9:12 a.m. in Bangkok, the most since June 19, data compiled by
Bloomberg show. One-month implied volatility, a measure of
expected moves in the  exchange rate  used to price options, fell
one basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 7.79 percent.  The baht weakened 1.8 percent last week, the biggest five-day drop since April, after Fed Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said
June 19 that $85 billion a month of debt purchases may be
trimmed this year and ended in 2014 if the  U.S. economy  performs
in line with the monetary authority’s projections.  The yield on the 3.625 percent government notes due June
2023 fell four basis points to 3.97 percent, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. It touched 4.01 percent yesterday, the
highest since September 2011.  Thailand will report export data tomorrow. The Customs
Department may say shipments contracted 4.2 percent last month,
after growing 2.9 percent in April, according to the median
estimate of economists surveyed by Bloomberg. Central bank
figures are due June 28.  To contact the reporter on this story:
