Mosaic Co. (MOS) , the largest U.S.
fertilizer producer, said Cargill family members blocked its
request for an early buyback of $7.2 billion of shares.  Mosaic was split off from commodity trader Cargill Inc. in
2011, which left 129 million Class A shares in the hands of
Cargill family members and charitable trusts established by the
late Margaret A. Cargill.  Mosaic has been in talks with those parties following the
second anniversary of the announcement of that transaction last
month, Plymouth, Minnesota-based Mosaic said today in a
statement. While the Margaret Cargill trusts supported a
negotiated buyback of the stock before Nov. 26, the family
members declined to amend the agreement that governs when and
how the shares can be sold.  “Mosaic is disappointed in its inability to effect share
repurchases this summer and looks forward to initiating share
repurchases after Nov. 26,” Mosaic said in the statement.  About half of the Class A shares are held by the estate of
Margaret Cargill, the late granddaughter of company founder
William Cargill, and the other half by members of the Cargill
family, Mosaic Chief Financial Officer Larry Stranghoener said
on a May 13 conference call.  Closely held Cargill divested its 64 percent Mosaic stake
to allow trustees of the Margaret Cargill estate to sell all its
Cargill shares. The transaction was completed May 2011.  To contact the reporter on this story:
