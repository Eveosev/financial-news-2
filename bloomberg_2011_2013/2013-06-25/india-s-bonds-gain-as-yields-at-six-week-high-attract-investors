Indian government bonds gained the
most in a week on speculation the highest yields in more than a
month will attract buyers.  The rate on benchmark notes due 2022 climbed yesterday to
7.70 percent, a level last reached May 8, on concern a plunge in
the rupee will spur inflation and reduce room for the central
bank to cut borrowing costs. Local-currency debt in India offer
the best yield among 12 Asian fixed-income markets tracked by
Bloomberg. Ten-year notes pay 3.37 percent in  China , 5.38
percent in  Indonesia  and 3.63 percent in South Korea.  The amount paid on the 8.15 percent notes due June 2022
fell five basis points, or 0.05 percentage point, to 7.65
percent at 9:49 a.m. in Mumbai, according to the central bank’s
trading system. That is the biggest drop since June 17. The
rupee fell 5.4 percent in June, set for the worst month since
May 2012, and touched a record low of 59.98 per dollar last
week, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  “Yields have definitely reached attractive levels,” said
Arvind Chari, a senior fund manager at Quantum Asset Management
Co. in Mumbai. “The situation, however, is still fluid given
where the rupee is and the Fed’s stance.”  Speculation that the Federal Reserve will scale back asset
purchases that have boosted dollar supply globally has fueled
capital outflows from riskier assets in recent weeks. Foreign
funds have cut  holdings  of Indian debt by $5.5 billion from a
record $38.5 billion on May 21.  India ’s monetary-policy stance will be determined by the
evolution of economic growth, inflation and the balance of
payments in the months ahead, the Reserve Bank of India said in
a June 17 statement, adding “only a  durable receding  of
inflation” will allow further policy easing. Governor Duvvuri Subbarao held the repurchase  rate  at 7.25 percent that day after
cutting it in the previous three reviews.  The one-year interest-rate swap, a derivative contract used
to guard against fluctuations in funding costs, fell five basis
points to 7.43 percent, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
