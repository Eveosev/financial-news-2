Microsoft Corp. (MSFT)  is introducing a
venture capital division that will provide funding, advice and
computing and software services to startups.  Through the newly formed Microsoft Ventures, fledgling
business will have access to funding, services such as cloud
computing and an accelerator program lasting three to six
months, Redmond, Washington-based Microsoft said in a blog. The
company already provides several of these services. The new
program will help bring cohesion to the effort, Microsoft said.  “By unifying our various efforts, we will give
entrepreneurs a single point of entry to engage with
Microsoft,” the company said. “Startups have enough to worry
about. We want to make access to us as intuitive and friction-free as possible.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
