Brazil’s President  Dilma Rousseff 
won’t dismiss Finance Minister  Guido Mantega  and other top
economic advisers after three weeks of protests for better
services and less corruption, her spokesman said.  “Mantega has the trust of the president and will remain in
office,” spokesman Thomas Traumann said in an interview today.
“The president will maintain her main economic advisers.”  Valor Economico newspaper reported today that Rousseff
could appoint central bank President Alexandre Tombini as
finance minister, without citing where it got the information.
Former central bank chief Henrique Meirelles would replace
Tombini, Sao Paulo-based Valor said.  Latin America’s biggest economy has expanded below market
expectations for five consecutive months and grew 0.9 percent
last year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
