Tim Hortons  Inc. shareholder Scout
Capital Management LLC demanded in an open letter that the
Canadian coffee and doughnut chain make changes to its corporate
strategy, including raising debt for share repurchases.  Among its other recommendations, Scout wants Tim Hortons to
curtail the use of  cash flow  to fund its U.S. expansion, the
closely held New York-based investment company said today in a
letter included in a U.S. filing. Scout, which controls a 5.5
percent stake in the Oakville, Ontario-based company, said in
the letter it wants to improve Tim Hortons’ performance compared
with its restaurant peer group.  “By all rights, the company’s brand positioning should
have led to superior shareholder returns and performance over
time,” Scout said in the letter. “Unfortunately, this has not
been the case.”  Alexandra Cygal, a Tim Hortons spokeswoman, didn’t respond
to a voicemail seeking comment.  Scout is at least the second activist investor group to
advise the company to increase debt levels and reconsider its
U.S. expansion strategy. Boston-based Highfields Capital
Management LP increased its stake in Tim Hortons to 4 percent
this year, and filed a similar open letter to the company’s
board.  Tim Hortons rose 3.2 percent to C$56.29 at 4 p.m. in
Toronto.  The shares  have gained 15 percent this year compared
with a 3.4 percent drop in the Standard & Poor’s/TSX Composite
Index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
