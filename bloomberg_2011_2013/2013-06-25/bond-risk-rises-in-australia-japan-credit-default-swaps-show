The cost of insuring corporate bonds
from non-payment increased in Australia and  Japan , according to
traders of credit-default swaps.  The Markit iTraxx Japan index advanced 4 basis points to
124.5 basis points as of 10:05 a.m. in  Tokyo , Citigroup Inc.
prices show. The gauge, which has already risen 25 basis points
this month, is on track for its highest close since Feb. 28,
according to data provider CMA.  The Markit iTraxx Australia index increased 4 basis points
to 149 as of 10:54 a.m. in Sydney, according to National
Australia Bank Ltd. The benchmark has risen 37 basis points this
month after a 6.4 basis-point jump in May, according to CMA,
which is owned by McGraw-Hill Cos. and compiles prices quoted by
dealers in the privately negotiated market.  The Markit iTraxx Asia index of 40 investment-grade
borrowers outside Japan slid 8 basis points to 167.5 basis
points as of 8:57 a.m. in  Hong Kong , Australia & New Zealand
Banking Group Ltd. prices show. The measure, which has ranged
from 99.5 basis points to 177.8 basis points this quarter, is
set for its lowest close since June 21, according to CMA.  Credit-default swap indexes are benchmarks for insuring
bonds against default and traders use them to speculate on
 credit quality . A drop signals improving perceptions of
creditworthiness, while an increase suggests the opposite.  The swap contracts pay the buyer face value in exchange for
the underlying securities if a borrower fails to meet its debt
agreements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
