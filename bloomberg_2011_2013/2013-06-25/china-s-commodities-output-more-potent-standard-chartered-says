China is becoming increasingly
powerful as a supplier of raw materials including  iron ore ,
aluminum, nickel and coal as it boosts output from local mines
and smelters, according to Standard Chartered Plc.  Gold and copper are among the raw materials that are least
vulnerable to China’s growing capacity, the bank said in a
report dated June 21. Other commodities cited as insulated from
the trend were platinum and diamonds, while tin was reported to
be somewhat resilient.  This poses a risk to  BHP Billiton Ltd. (BHP) ,  Rio Tinto , Vale SA
and Glencore Xstrata Plc, Standard Chartered said. The bank has
reduced its recommendations on BHP, Rio and Vale to underperform
and Glencore to neutral.  Gold output in China is poised to rise almost 10 percent
this year to a record 440 tons, the nation’s mining association
said last week.  “Although it is the world’s largest producer of gold, 40
percent of its production uses imported gold in concentrates,”
according to  Standard Chartered  report. “It is not
inconceivable that by 2016 China will be importing nearly 2,000
tons of gold each year, which is 80 percent of global mine
supply,”  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
