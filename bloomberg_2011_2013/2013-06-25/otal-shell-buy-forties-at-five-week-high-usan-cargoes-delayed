Total SA (FP)  and  Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA) 
bought three cargoes of  North Sea  Forties at the highest price
in five weeks. No bids or offers were made for Russian Urals
crude in Europe for a second day.  All three cargoes of Nigerian Usan crude for July loading
will be deferred to August, according to two people with
knowledge of the loading program.  North Sea  Three cargoes of Forties were sold at a premium of 5 cents
a barrel more than Dated Brent, the highest since May 16 and
compared with a discount of 15 cents for the last trade on June
19, a Bloomberg survey of traders and brokers monitoring the
Platts pricing window showed.  Shell sold Forties cargo F0709 for July 12 to July 14 and
lot F0712 for July 17 to July 19 to Total, while  Eni SpA (ENI)  sold
shipment F0707 for July 7 to July 9 to Shell, according to the
survey. Eni failed to find a buyer for Forties for loading on
July 11 to July 13 at the same price, the survey showed.  Mercuria Energy Trading SA didn’t manage to buy Forties for
July 7 to July 10 at 5 cents a barrel more than Dated Brent,

16 to July 18 at 10 cents a barrel less than the benchmark,
according to the survey.  For Ekofisk, Shell sold shipment C11389 for July 15 to July
17 to Total at 75 cents a barrel more than Dated Brent, compared
with a premium of 60 cents for the last transaction on June 18,
the survey showed.  Eni failed to sell Ekofisk for July 8 to July 10 at 65
cents a barrel more than Dated Brent, according to the survey.  Reported crude trading typically occurs during the Platts
window, which ends at 4:30 p.m. London time. Forties loading in
10 to 25 days was 21 cents more than Dated Brent, compared with
a premium of 12 cents yesterday, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. That’s the highest since May 20.  Brent for August settlement traded at $101.75 a barrel on
the ICE Futures  Europe  exchange at the close of the window,
compared with $100 in the previous session. The September
contract was at $101.37 at the same time today, a discount of 38
cents to August.  Brent cargo B0701 will load on July 10-12, three days later
than originally scheduled, and lot B0702 will load July 13-15,
deferred by one day, according to three people with knowledge of
the loading program who asked not to be identified because the
information is confidential.  Platts will cut the sulfur de-escalator for Forties to 20
cents a barrel from July 1, compared with 25 cents for May and
June, the company said in a statement on its website.  Mediterranean/Urals  Urals in the Mediterranean rose by 6 cents to a discount of
