The European Union is open to a
settlement with  Samsung Electronics Co. (005930) , the world’s biggest
maker of smartphones, over a patent-abuse case, said Cecilio
Madero, the EU’s deputy director-general for antitrust.  Samsung has to decide whether it wants to settle, he said.
“We are ok one way or the other,” Madero said, following a
speech in Brussels today.  The EU is cracking down on patent abuses as Google Inc.’s
Motorola Mobility, Microsoft Corp.,  Apple Inc. (AAPL)  and Samsung trade
victories in divergent court rulings across the world on
intellectual property.  EU Competition Commissioner  Joaquin Almunia  last year sent
Samsung a formal complaint saying its use of court injunctions
seeking to block Apple products in relation to so-called
standard-essential patents violates antitrust rules in the 27-nation bloc.  Samsung, based in Suwon, South Korea, has said it would
drop such actions in Europe. The company declined to comment on
Madero’s comments.  Industry-standard technology helps ensure products such as
mobile phone antennas and global-positioning system software can
operate together when made by different manufacturers.  To contact the reporter on this story:
