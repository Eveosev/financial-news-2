Indian (SENSEX)  stock-index futures swung
between gains and losses as overseas investors extended a
selloff of the nation’s shares and the rupee weakened.  SGX CNX  Nifty (NIFTY)  Index futures for June rose 0.2 percent to
5,610.5 at 9:58 a.m. in  Singapore  after dropping as much as 0.8
percent. The underlying CNX Nifty Index slid 1.4 percent to
5,590.25 yesterday, the lowest close since April 15. The S&P BSE
Sensex fell 1.2 percent. The Bank of  New York  Mellon India ADR
Index of U.S.-traded shares slumped 2.7 percent to the lowest
level since Sept. 5.  Overseas funds sold a net $294 million of Indian shares on
June 21 as global investors boosted sales of local bonds and
stocks on the prospect of the U.S. paring stimulus policies.
Foreigners have offloaded a net $1.31 billion of Indian shares
in a nine-day selloff through June 21. The rupee fell yesterday,
extending a seven-week slide that saw the currency plunge to a
record low on June 20.  “India doesn’t have too much of a defense against a sudden
outflow of money,” Sanjeev Prasad, co-head and senior  executive
director  at Kotak Securities Ltd., said in an interview with
Bloomberg TV India yesterday. “We run a structural current-account deficit in the range of $7 billion-plus a month, so
every month we have to get $7 billion of capital inflows.”  Foreign funds pulled $4.6 billion from Indian debt and
shares in June, exchange data show. Outflows from stocks this
month have reduced this year’s net purchases to $14.1 billion,
still a record for the period and the second-highest this year
among 10 Asian markets tracked by Bloomberg, after Japan.  The Sensex has dropped 4.6 percent this year, reversing
gains after climbing to a 19-month high on May 17. The index
trades at 12.6 times  projected 12-month profits  compared with
the MSCI  Emerging Markets  Index’s 9.2 times.  To contact the reporter on this story:
