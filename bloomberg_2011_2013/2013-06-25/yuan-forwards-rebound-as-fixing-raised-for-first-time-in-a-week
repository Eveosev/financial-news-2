Yuan  forwards rebounded from a 15-week low as the central bank strengthened the daily fixing for
the first time in a week amid a cash crunch in the nation’s
financial system.  The People’s Bank of  China  raised the  reference rate  0.06
percent to 6.1767 per dollar, ending a five-day streak in which
it weakened the fixing by 0.34 percent. Benchmark money-market
rates extended their retreat from record highs, while remaining
higher than monthly averages. Goldman Sachs Group Inc. cut its
2013 growth projection to 7.4 percent from 7.8 percent, citing
the recent tightening of financial conditions.  “Today is a rebound rather than a change of direction for
the yuan,” said Kenix Lai, a Hong Kong-based foreign-exchange
analyst at Bank of East Asia Ltd. “Downside pressure remains as
onshore liquidity is tight and there’s concern over growth.”  Twelve-month non-deliverable forwards rose 0.14 percent to
6.3065 per dollar as of 10:03 a.m. in Hong Kong, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. The contracts touched 6.3190 per
dollar yesterday, the weakest since March 7. They traded at a
2.6 percent  discount  to the yuan in Shanghai, which was little
changed at 6.1446, China Foreign Exchange Trade System prices
showed. The onshore spot rate is allowed to diverge from the
reference by a maximum of 1 percent.  Long yuan positions will come under stress in coming weeks,
Commonwealth Bank of Australia strategists Andy Ji in Singapore
and  Joseph Capurso  in Sydney wrote in a research note yesterday.
That’s because of the strength of the dollar, growth concerns
stemming from China’s ongoing credit tightening and a possible
widening of the daily trading band, the strategists wrote. A
long position is a bet a currency or security will rise in value.  In Hong Kong’s offshore market, the yuan slipped 0.02
percent to 6.1415 per dollar, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. One-month implied volatility in the onshore yuan, a
measure of expected moves in the  exchange rate  used to price
options, declined five basis points, or 0.05 percentage point,
to 1.9 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
