Treasuries fell, pushing 10-year
yields toward the highest since 2011, as data showing gains in
U.S. durable-goods orders,  home prices  and  consumer confidence 
boosted the case for the  Federal Reserve  to slow bond purchases.  Government securities  stayed lower after the U.S. sold $35
billion of  two-year  debt to below-average demand. Ten-year
yields rose for a seventh day, the longest since March 2012. Fed
Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said last week policy makers may reduce
bond buying under their quantitative-easing stimulus strategy
this year and end it in mid-2014 if economic growth is in line
with their projections.  “You’re starting to see some data today that represents
the view the Fed has in their forecasts,” said Jason Rogan,
director of U.S. government trading at Guggenheim Partners LLC,
a New York-based brokerage for institutional investors. “If you
continue to see strong economic data like today, the assumption
is that the Fed will be closer to tapering.”  The U.S. 10-year yield climbed seven basis points, or 0.07
percentage point, to 2.61 percent at 5 p.m. New York time after
falling six basis points earlier to 2.48 percent. It touched
2.66 percent yesterday, the highest since August 2011. The price
of the 1.75 percent security due in May 2023 slid 19/32, or
$5.94 per $1,000 face amount, to 92 18/32.  Current  two-year  note yields increased two basis points to
0.41 percent. They reached 0.43 percent yesterday, the highest
since July 2011. Thirty-year bond yields rose eight basis points
to 3.62 percent.  Treasury trading  volume  at ICAP Plc, the largest inter-dealer broker of  U.S. government debt , declined 12 percent to
$478 billion. The 2013 average is $320 billion.  Relative Strength  A technical gauge signaled the increase in  10-year yields 
may have been too rapid. The 14-day relative-strength index, a
monitor of momentum, rose to 79.8, exceeding the 70 level that
indicates the yields may be poised to change direction.  Treasuries have  lost  1.9 percent in June and dropped 2.9
percent this year, according to the Bloomberg U.S. Treasury Bond
Index. They have declined 2.6 percent this quarter, a Bank of
America Merrill Lynch index shows.  Bonds rose earlier as investors sought safer assets amid
speculation a credit squeeze in China will slow growth. They
reversed gains after  China ’s central bank said it will keep
money-market rates at a “reasonable” level and reports in the
U.S. showed gains in the world’s largest economy.  Bookings for U.S. goods meant to last at least three years
increased 3.6 percent for a second month, the Commerce
Department reported. The median forecast of economists in a
Bloomberg survey was for a 3 percent increase. Excluding
transportation equipment, where demand is volatile month to
month, orders advanced 0.7 percent, also topping projections.  ‘Coming Back’  “We’ve had a slow patch in manufacturing, and it looks
like we could be coming back here as we enter the second half of
the year,” said Jacob Oubina, a senior economist in New York at
Royal Bank of Canada’s  RBC Capital Markets , one of 21 primary
dealers that trade with the Fed.  Confidence among U.S.  consumers  climbed in June to the
highest level in more than five years. The Conference Board’s
index rose to 81.4. Home prices rose more than forecast in the
12 months through April, with the S&P/Case-Shiller index of
property values increased 12.1 percent from April 2012. New-home
sales increased 2.1 percent in May, government data showed.  Break-Even  The yield gap between U.S. 10-year notes and comparable
Treasury Inflation Protected Securities, a measure called the
 break-even  rate that signals traders’ expectations for inflation
over the life of the debt, widened for the first time in five
days. It increased to 1.97 percentage points after touching 1.81
percentage points yesterday, the narrowest since October 2011.  Bernanke, speaking June 19 after a two-day meeting of the
 Federal Open Market Committee , said reducing bond purchases
would depend on the economy achieving the central bank’s
objectives. Policy makers are forecasting growth of as much as
2.6 percent this year and 3.5 percent in 2014.  Volatility in Treasuries as measured by Bank of America
Merrill Lynch’s MOVE index climbed to 110.98 yesterday, the
highest since November 2011, before slipping to 108.44 today. It
has averaged 62 this year.  The Fed has been buying $45 billion of U.S. government debt
and $40 billion of mortgage securities every month to put
downward pressure on borrowing costs in its third round of asset
purchases since 2008. It purchased $1.46 billion today of
Treasuries due from February 2036 to November 2042.  ‘Fair’ Auction  Today’s two-year note auction had a  bid-to-cover  ratio,
which gauges demand by comparing total bids with the amount of
securities offered, of 3.05, almost matching the May sale’s
3.04, the least since February 2011. The average at the past 10
sales was 3.63.  The sale yielded 0.430 percent, the highest since May 2011.
A Bloomberg News survey of seven of the Fed’s primary dealers
forecast an auction yield of 0.423 percent.  “The market is moving to higher yields, and the short end
is following along,” said Justin Lederer, an interest rate
strategist at Cantor Fitzgerald LP in  New York , which as a
primary dealer is obligated to bid at U.S. government debt
auctions. “The auction was fair. The stats were mixed. The
questionable auctions will be tomorrow and Wednesday.”  The Treasury will sell $35 billion of five-year notes
tomorrow and $29 billion of seven-year securities on June 27.  Indirect bidders, an investor class that includes foreign
central banks, purchased 35.8 percent of the notes at today’s
auction, the most since February 2012. That compared with an
average of 23.8 percent at the past 10 sales.  Direct bidders, non-primary-dealer investors that place
their bids directly with the Treasury, bought 7.8 percent of the
notes, the least since April 2012, versus an average of 24.8
percent at the past 10 auctions.  Investors have bid $2.96 for each of the $1.01 trillion of
notes and bonds sold by the Treasury this year, compared with a
record high $3.15 for all of last year.  To contact the reporters on this story:
