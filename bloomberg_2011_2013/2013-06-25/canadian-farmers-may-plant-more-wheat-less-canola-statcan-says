Canadian farmers may plant 9.3
percent more wheat this year and produce less canola, according
to a government survey as of June 10, before potentially crop-damaging rain flooded parts of Western  Canada .  Total wheat acreage will probably expand from 2012 to 25.9
million  acres ,  Statistics Canada  said today in a report. The
average estimate of 10 analysts surveyed by  Bloomberg News  was
26.2 million acres. Canola acres may decline 8.3 percent to 19.7
million acres, down from 21.5 million acres in 2012. Analysts in
a Bloomberg survey expected 19.6 million acres. Barley planting
will probably decrease 3.1 percent to 7.18 million acres,
according to the report.  Statistics Canada said it surveyed about 25,000 farmers
about their seedings between May 27 and June 10, before severe
thunderstorms pummeled parts of Alberta, Saskatchewan and
Manitoba. Parts of southern Alberta received 300 millimeters (12
inches) of rain between June 19 and 22, Environment Canada
warning preparedness meteorologist Natalie Hasell said, and
areas of Winnipeg, Manitoba received 74 mm of rain on June 20.  More than 100,000 people have been displaced due to
flooding in  Alberta , the province said in a statement, and
Manitoba has issued an overland flood warning for the northwest,
Interlake and southwest regions of the province after as much as
107 mm of rain fell in parts of the province as June 23.  Alberta crop and livestock producers may suffer losses from
floods, Agriculture Minister Verlyn Olson told Bloomberg News on
Saturday.  ‘Above Normal’  “This is way above normal,” Hasell said in a telephone
interview from Winnipeg.  While planting in many parts of Western Canada was delayed
this spring by excess moisture and cool temperatures, farmers
managed to sow most of their crop by mid-June, according to
provincial reports in Alberta, Manitoba, and Saskatchewan.
Eighty-five percent of crops in Alberta were rated good or
excellent as of June 18, the agriculture ministry said in a
report, before heavy rainfall began June 19 and some residents
of Calgary were evacuated.  Wheat futures on the  Minneapolis Grain Exchange  fell 9.3
percent this year through yesterday, and Canola prices declined
5.5 percent this year on the ICE Futures Canada exchange in
Winnipeg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
