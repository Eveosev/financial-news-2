The  Federal Reserve  proposed rules
increasing its monitoring of money market transactions while
pushing forward with efforts to ensure financial market
stability.  The central bank is proposing to require daily reports by
U.S. banks with $26 billion in total assets and foreign bank
units with total third-party assets of at least $900 million on
federal funds transactions, Eurodollar trades and certificates
of deposit, the Fed said in a statement today in Washington.  Financial firms would need to report the amount, maturity
and interest rate of each transaction, the Fed said. Banks will
have a 60-day period to submit comments to the Fed Board.  To contact the reporter on this story:
