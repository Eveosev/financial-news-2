South Africans opposed to the
distribution of portable toilets in impoverished communities
have taken their protests to a low: throwing feces at government
officials.  Human waste was dumped this month on the legislature in
Cape Town and thrown at a bus carrying Helen Zille, leader of
the main opposition party, the Democratic Alliance, which
governs the Western Cape province. Members of the ruling African
National Congress’s Youth League and some residents say the
portable toilets being distributed in parts of the city don’t
address residents’ demands for clean and safe bathrooms.  “By improving these toilets they are simply improving on
apartheid’s legacy,” former ANC councilor Andile Lili told the
Johannesburg-based Times newspaper this month, in reference to
the system of white-minority rule that ended in 1994.  Human excretions were also thrown at an ANC councilor’s
house in Buffalo City, 30 kilometers (19 miles) outside of East
London, the Eastern Cape local government said on June 23,
according to the South African Press Agency.  Lili told The Cape Argus newspaper the flinging of feces at
government officials and buildings was a “warning” of things
to come.  The government has condemned the practice, with Minister in
the Presidency Collins Chabane saying in a June 13 statement,
“this particular form of protest is undignified and poses a
serious health risk to communities and the protesters
themselves.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
