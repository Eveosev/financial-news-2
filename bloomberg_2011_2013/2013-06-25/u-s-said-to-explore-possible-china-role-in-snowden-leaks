U.S. intelligence agencies are investigating whether Edward Snowden’s leaks may be a Chinese intelligence operation or whether  China  might have used his concerns about U.S. surveillance practices to exploit him, according to four American officials.  The officials emphasized there’s no hard evidence yet that Snowden was a Chinese agent or that China helped plan his flights to  Hong Kong  and then to Moscow, directly or through a witting or unwitting intermediary. Rather, they are duty-bound to probe such a worst-case scenario for the U.S., said the officials, who are familiar with the case and asked not to be identified to discuss classified intelligence.  President  Barack Obama  said yesterday that the U.S. is working with other nations to gain custody of Snowden on espionage charges, as administration officials chastised China for letting him leave Hong Kong for Moscow and pressed  Russia  to turn him over.  Russian President  Vladimir Putin  confirmed today that Snowden was in the transit zone of a Moscow airport and said he couldn’t be handed over to the U.S. because the two nations don’t have an extradition treaty.  Snowden, the former government contractor who disclosed top-secret U.S. National Security Agency programs that collect phone and Internet data, intended to seek safe passage through Russia and “other states” to Ecuador, Julian Assange, founder of the anti-secrecy group WikiLeaks, told reporters yesterday.  ‘Complete Nonsense’  Any suggestion that Snowden worked with China was “complete nonsense and extremely irresponsible,” China’s Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said at a briefing today. Asked if Snowden’s case would derail Chinese-U.S. ties, Hua said the two countries have “always maintained close dialogue and contact.”  Russian security agencies “didn’t work and aren’t working” with Snowden and any accusations against Russia are “drivel and nonsense,” Putin told reporters today near Turku,  Finland . The sooner Snowden chooses his final destination, the better for him and for Russia, Putin said.  U.S. Secretary of State  John Kerry  said yesterday in  New Delhi  that it would be “deeply troubling” if Russia had advance notice of Snowden’s arrival and “notwithstanding that, they make the decision willfully to ignore that and not live by the standards of the law.” He warned both Russia and China of “consequences” for their actions.  Behavior Standards  Today, Kerry said, “We’re not looking for a confrontation.”  While acknowledging the lack of a U.S.-Russia extradition treaty that would apply to Snowden, Kerry told reporters in  Jeddah ,  Saudi Arabia , “There are standards of behavior between sovereign nations” and “they certainly can allow him to be subject to the laws of our land.”  The involvement of China and Russia in Snowden’s travels raises questions about their relationship with Snowden and what information he may provide them, according to  Jane Harman , president of the Wilson Center, a Washington-based policy research group.  “Clearly, he now is a pawn in a big-power game, and I think that game is way too big for him,” Harman, a former Democratic congresswoman from  California  who served on the House intelligence committee, said in an interview.  While U.S. counterintelligence investigations are mandatory in all cases in which top-secret information is made public without authorization, the U.S. officials said, their suspicions about Snowden began to take root when he fled to Hong Kong, which has a 1997 extradition treaty with the U.S. but is under the political control of China.  Booz Allen  They grew deeper still when Snowden spoke publicly only about American cyber-attacks on China and Hong Kong even though he had access to information on espionage against other nations. In newly disclosed comments, Snowden, who previously worked for the Central Intelligence Agency, also said he sought out his most recent job with government contractor  Booz Allen Hamilton Holding Corp. (BAH)  in order to get more access to secrets.  “My position with  Booz Allen  Hamilton granted me access to lists of machines all over the world the NSA hacked,” Snowden told the  South China Morning Post  in a report dated today that the newspaper said was based on a June 12 interview. “That is why I accepted that position about three months ago.”  Obama, Xi  Suspicions were compounded by the timing of Snowden’s initial revelations on the eve of a summit in California between Obama and Chinese President Xi Jinping, where the American leader was planning to confront his counterpart about China’s commercial and government cyber-espionage efforts, said two of the U.S. officials.  Instead, China used Snowden’s revelations and evidence to put the U.S. on the defensive amid pro-Snowden demonstrations in the streets of Hong Kong that made it appear that denying a U.S. extradition request had popular support.  China filed a protest to the U.S., Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua said in a statement on June 23, and the government-controlled Global Times newspaper said yesterday in an editorial that Snowden’s disclosures benefited the world, showing that China must catch up in network security.  Regardless of how Snowden came to land in Hong Kong and then Moscow, U.S. intelligence agencies must assume that China and Russia have debriefed Snowden and now have all the digital information he brought with him, said one of the officials.  Snowden’s Debriefing  Such a debriefing could have been direct or through intermediaries that Snowden may not have known were giving what they learned to a foreign intelligence agency, the official said.  As a result, all the officials said, American counterintelligence and security specialists have changed the electronic locks to virtually every classified intelligence compartment to which Snowden had authorized access or to which the material made public so far suggests he gained access.  Counterintelligence experts are also reviewing all Snowden’s communications and movements in recent years, to the extent that information on them is available from mobile-phone records, geolocation, keystroke-logging, interviews with co-workers and others and additional sources, one of the officials said.  Snowden may have a technical road map of U.S. electronic surveillance systems and also know the names of spies and informants and the locations of safe houses abroad, ABC News reported yesterday, citing several officials it didn’t identify.  Acted Alone?  One pressing question is whether Snowden acted alone or got some of the material he’s disclosed from co-workers or from Chinese or other hacking activities. As a result, said two of the officials, everyone Snowden worked with while he held a top-secret clearance and everyone known to have crossed paths with him is under a microscope.  In particular, one of the officials said, investigators are searching for any evidence that Chinese intelligence officers might have played a role in his decision to flee in May to Hong Kong, where they could prevent his extradition to the U.S., debrief him and then send him on to Russia without being held legally accountable.  Albert Ho, a lawyer and Hong Kong legislator who said he was acting on Snowden’s behalf, said that if Snowden’s departure were orchestrated by the Chinese government, it would have been done behind the scenes so as not to aggravate Sino-U.S. ties.  Limited Role  “The Hong Kong government may not have had any role other than acting on instructions not to stop him at the airport,” he said.  The Hong Kong government said in a statement that the U.S. “did not fully comply with the legal requirements under Hong Kong law,” leaving the city “no legal basis to restrict Mr. Snowden from leaving.”  U.S. officials denied that, and White House spokesman  Jay Carney  said Hong Kong’s decision to let Snowden depart for Moscow “unquestionably” damages U.S. relations with China.  The U.S. officials said their doubts about whether Snowden is just a whistle-blower intensified when he flew from Hong Kong to Russia, where dissident journalists have been murdered, and WikiLeaks suggested that he would fly to Cuba and Ecuador, neither of which is known for press freedom, one official added.  Ecuador will “act upon our principles” in Snowden’s case, Foreign Minister Ricardo Patino said in Hanoi yesterday. A decision by Ecuador to embrace Snowden would advance President  Rafael Correa ’s efforts to step out from the shadow of Venezuela’s late President  Hugo Chavez  and establish himself as the U.S.’s leading critic in  Latin America .  Much of what WikiLeaks and others have said about Snowden’s possible itinerary, including previous talk of a flight to Iceland, has proved to be false, and the officials said they think Cuba may be a safer final destination than Ecuador or post-Chavez Venezuela if Snowden doesn’t stay in Russia.  The case against Snowden is U.S. v Snowden, 13-cr-265, U.S. District Court, Eastern District of  Virginia  (Alexandria).
