Val Ackerman has agreed to become
commissioner of the Big East conference, adding to a basketball-heavy resume that includes being the first president of the
Women’s National Basketball Association, a person with direct
knowledge of the hiring said.  The 53-year-old Ackerman was chosen by the presidents of
the conference’s 10 universities, according to the person, who
requested anonymity because the contract hasn’t been signed.  Other female conference commissioners include Bernadette McGlade of the Atlantic 10 and Robin Harris, executive director
of the Ivy League.  NBA Commissioner David Stern, who appointed Ackerman to
start up the women’s league, praised her choice as conference
chief.  “She brings all of that experience with intelligence, a
keen analytical ability, an intense work ethic and a winning
management style,” Stern said in an e-mail.  Ackerman didn’t immediately return an e-mail or voice
message at home seeking comment on the Big East job.  The Big East is set to begin business in its new form in
five days. It is comprised largely of Catholic colleges and
universities from the old Big East, which is now called the
American Athletic Conference.  Basketball Focus  The league, which retained the rights to the Big East name,
includes the so-called Catholic 7, whose presidents voted to
leave because they said football-related revenue was becoming
too important. The Big East started in 1979 with a focus on
basketball.  The holdover schools are Georgetown, St. John’s, Villanova,
Seton Hall, Providence, Marquette and DePaul. They will be
joined by Butler, Creighton and Xavier.  Ackerman ran the WNBA from 1996 to 2005, when she stepped
down. She was a staff attorney for the NBA, according to ESPN,
and served as the first female president of USA Basketball from
2005 to 2008. She’s a member of the Basketball Hall of Fame
board of trustees.  A basketball player at the University of Virginia prior to
getting her law degree at UCLA, Ackerman released a report this
month commissioned by the National Collegiate Athletic
Association on the state of women’s basketball and possible
changes the sport could make to improve popularity and
efficiency.  Female Roster  Linda Bruno was the first female commissioner of a major
college conference, serving as head of the Atlantic 10 from 1994
to 2008, and was replaced by McGlade. Carolyn Schlie Femovich
has been commissioner of the Patriot League since 1999 and
Brenda Weare led the Northeast Conference from 2006 until her
death in 2009. In 2011, Amy Huchthausen was chosen commissioner
of the America East, and Harris has led the Ivy League since
2009.  “It’ll be great to have another female join the
commissioner ranks, but first and foremost, her extensive
leadership experience and accomplishments give her a perspective
that will position the Big East for continued success,”
Huchthausen, a former Big East intern, said in an e-mail.  The Big East signed a 12-year television contract this year
with Fox Sports, a unit of  News Corp. (NWSA)  The league has agreed to
play its season-ending men’s basketball tournament at Madison
Square Garden in New York for the next three years.  To contact the reporters on this story:
