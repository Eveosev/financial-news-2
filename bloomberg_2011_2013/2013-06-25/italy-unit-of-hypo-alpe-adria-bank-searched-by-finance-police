Finance police are searching the
offices of the Italian unit of Hypo Alpe-Adria-Bank
International AG as part of a fraud probe, according to finance
police Colonel Stefano Commentucci.  Hypo Alpe Adria Bank SpA, based in Udine,  Italy , allegedly
defrauded clients of at least 30 million euros ($39.4 million)
from 2008 to 2013, applying higher  interest rates  to more than
14,000 leasing contracts, police said in a statement today.  Hypo Alpe’s parent company has already taken measures
against former managers and is cooperating with authorities, a
spokesman, Nikola Donig, said by phone when contacted by
 Bloomberg News  today. The Italian unit of the nationalized
Austrian lender set aside cash last year to reimburse clients
and will create additional provisions this year, Donig said.  The unit and five managers at that time are also under
investigation, Commentucci said by telephone. The unit didn’t
answer two calls to Italian headquarters seeking comment.  To contact the reporters on this story:
