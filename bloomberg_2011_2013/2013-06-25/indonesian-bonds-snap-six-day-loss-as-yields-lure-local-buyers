Indonesia ’s 10-year government bonds
rose for the first time in seven days after the central bank and
local funds bought the notes, lured by a surge in the yield to a
21-month high. Rupiah forwards advanced.  Bank Indonesia  held 101.3 trillion rupiah ($10.1 billion)
of sovereign notes on June 20, Deputy Governor Perry Warjiyo
said last week. That compares with 22.8 trillion rupiah at the
end of May, the latest finance ministry  data  show. Local-currency debt holdings at onshore banks rose 3.21 trillion
rupiah from the end of May to 309.5 trillion rupiah on June 18,
according to official figures.  “Bank Indonesia, along with local investors and banks, are
starting to lend support to bonds to tap the high yields,” said
Dini Anggraeni, a fixed-income analyst at PT Mandiri Sekuritas
in Jakarta. “Foreign investors’ risk appetite is still fragile,
so yields may still rise from here on.”  The yield on the 5.625 percent notes due May 2023 fell six
basis points to 7.19 percent as of 9:52 a.m. in Jakarta, prices
from the Inter Dealer Market Association show. It reached 7.24
percent yesterday, the highest level since September 2011.  Standard & Poor’s  stable outlook on Indonesia’s credit
rating of BB+, the highest junk level, is still valid even after
the government cut fuel subsidies, Associate Director Agost Benard said in an e-mailed response to questions late yesterday.
The reduction doesn’t “address the fundamental vulnerability of
fiscal and external balances to fuel subsidies in a lasting
manner,” the Singapore-based Benard wrote. S&P lowered its
outlook to stable from positive in May, citing stalled reform
momentum.  Forwards Strengthen  One-month non-deliverable forwards rose 0.8 percent to
10,346 per dollar, data compiled by Bloomberg show. The
contracts traded at a 3.9 percent discount to the spot rate,
which declined 0.1 percent to 9,940, prices from local banks
show. It touched 9,958 on June 18, the weakest level since 2009.  One-month implied volatility in the rupiah, a measure of
expected moves in the  exchange rate  used to price options, rose
17 basis points to 16.22 percent, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
