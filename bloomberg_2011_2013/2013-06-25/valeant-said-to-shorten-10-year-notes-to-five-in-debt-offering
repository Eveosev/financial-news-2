Valeant Pharmaceuticals
International Inc. (VRX) , the drug distributor acquiring Bausch & Lomb
Holdings Inc., dropped plans to issue 10-year notes as part of a
$3.23 billion bond sale, instead offering five-year securities.  The shorter bonds may yield about 6.75 percent and eight-year debt may pay about 7.5 percent in a sale planned for June
27, according to a person with knowledge of the transaction, who
asked not to be identified because terms arenâ€™t set. The
drugmaker had marketed the eight-year notes alongside the 10-year securities starting last week.  The company is also planning $4.05 billion in loans to help
fund the purchase, according to a person with knowledge of that
transaction.  To contact the reporter on this story:
