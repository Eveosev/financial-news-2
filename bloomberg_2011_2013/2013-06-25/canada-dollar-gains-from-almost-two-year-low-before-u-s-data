The Canadian dollar rose after
touching an almost two-year low before data in the U.S. forecast
to add evidence that economic recovery in  Canada ’s largest
trading partner is underway.  The Canadian dollar advanced against the majority of its 16
most-traded peers before reports projected to show U.S. durable-goods orders grew for a second month in May and the housing
market strengthened, according to Bloomberg surveys of
economists. The currency weakened beyond C$1.05 per  U.S. dollar 
to reach its lowest point in almost two years yesterday on bets
the U.S. currency will strengthen when the  Federal Reserve  ends
monetary stimulus.  “I think we still need to take the reversal in the
Canadian dollar in context because it’s still substantially
smaller than we’ve seen in some of the other dollar-bloc
commodity currencies, but nevertheless it is a pause for
breath,” said  Jeremy Stretch , head of currency strategy at
Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, by phone from  London . “The
growth story still looks somewhat better cyclically in the U.S.
than Canada and I think the data will disappoint and slow over
the next few months.”  The loonie, as the Canadian dollar is known for the image
of the aquatic bird on the C$1 coin, gained 0.3 percent to
C$1.0468 per U.S. dollar at 7:46 a.m. in Toronto. Yesterday the
currency touched C$1.0556 per U.S. dollar, the weakest since
Oct. 5 2011. One loonie buys 95.53 U.S. cents.  To contact the reporter on this story:
