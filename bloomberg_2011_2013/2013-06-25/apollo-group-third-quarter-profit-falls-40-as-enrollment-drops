Apollo Group Inc. (APOL) , owner of the
University of Phoenix and the biggest U.S. for-profit college,
said profit in the fiscal third quarter fell 40 percent as new
enrollment tumbled.  Net income  for the period ended May 31 dropped to $80
million, or 71 cents a share, from $134 million, or $1.13, a
year earlier, Phoenix-based Apollo said today in a statement.
Excluding some items, the company had a profit of $1.05 a share,
beating the 86-cent average of analysts’  estimates  compiled by
Bloomberg.  Apollo cut total costs by 9.5 percent in the quarter
through a restructuring program and by lowering its debt. The
for-profit college continues to face increased competition from
not-for-profit colleges that are increasingly serving Apollo’s
traditional targets: adult students who want to finish
uncompleted degree programs, said  Peter Appert , an analyst with
Piper Jaffray & Co. in San Francisco.  “What’s changed is how much more active the not-for-profits have become in what was once the purview of the for-profit schools,” Appert, who has a neutral rating on Apollo
shares, said in a telephone interview. “Fundamentally, there’s
too much capacity chasing too little demand.”  Apollo rose 3.2 percent in after-hours trading. The stock
gained 1.4 percent to $19.38 at  the close  in New York. The
company has lost 7.4 percent this year.  New students signing up for classes in the period slumped
24 percent from a year earlier to 38,900.  Revenue dropped 16 percent to $946.8 million. That compares
with $965.8 million, the average of analysts’ estimates.  Apollo, whose shares have slid 40 percent in the past year,
will lose its spot in the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index later this
week, S&P said in a statement June 20. Apollo will join the S&P
Midcap 400 Index.  (Apollo will hold a conference call at 5 p.m. New York time
