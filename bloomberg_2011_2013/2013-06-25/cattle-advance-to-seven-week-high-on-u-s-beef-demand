Cattle futures rose to a seven-week
high on signs of increasing demand for U.S. beef. Hog prices
declined.  Wholesale  beef , little changed yesterday, has climbed 2.6
percent this year, U.S. Department of Agriculture data show.
Last week, cattle futures jumped 2.8 percent, the biggest rally
in almost 12 months. The U.S. herd will continue to shrink this
year, partly because of drought, and beef supplies will be down
at least into 2015, INTL FCStone said on June 21.  “Product trade is strong,” Chad Henderson, a market
analyst at Prime Agricultural Consultants Inc. in Brookfield,
 Wisconsin , said in a telephone interview. “Long term, we want
to be positive because of the lower supplies.”  Cattle futures for August delivery climbed 0.5 percent to
$1.2175 a pound at 9:59 a.m. on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
Earlier, the price reached $1.22175, the highest for a most-active contract May 6.  Spot  steers  averaged $1.2093 a pound last week, up 3.8
percent from a year earlier, government data show.  Feeder-cattle futures for August settlement rose 0.2
percent to $1.47925 a pound.  Hog futures for August settlement dropped 0.3 percent to
97.725 cents a pound. Through yesterday, the contract gained 1.6
percent in 2013.  To contact the reporter on this story:
