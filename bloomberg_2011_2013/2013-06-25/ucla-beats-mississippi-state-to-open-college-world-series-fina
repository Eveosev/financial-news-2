UCLAâ€™s baseball team defeated
Mississippi State 3-1 in the opening game of the best-of-three
College World Series final round.  UCLA jumped out to a 3-0 lead last night at TD Ameritrade
Park in Omaha,  Nebraska , where Bruins starting pitcher Adam
Plutko allowed one run over six innings.  Three UCLA relievers then held Mississippi State scoreless
over the final three innings, with David Berg getting the final
five outs to set a National Collegiate Athletic Association
record with his 24th save of the season.  Eric Filia drove in two runs for UCLA (48-17), which can
win the national title with another victory in Game 2 tonight.
Mississippi State (51-19) needs a win tonight to force a
decisive third game, which would be played tomorrow.  Both schools are seeking their first College World Series
championship. UCLA now has a 40-0 record this season when
leading after seven innings.  To contact the reporter on this story:
