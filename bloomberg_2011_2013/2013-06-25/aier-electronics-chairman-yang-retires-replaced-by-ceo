Haier Electronics Group Co. (1169) , a unit
of  China ’s largest appliance maker, said founder and chairman
Yang Mianmian has retired and been replaced by Chief Executive
Officer Zhou Yunjie.  Yang stepped down from the board yesterday and has been
appointed senior adviser, according to a Hong Kong stock
exchange filing yesterday. Yang, 71, has no disagreement with
the board or anything to tell shareholders, Hong Kong-based
Haier Electronics said.  Her departure completes a management transition at both of
Haier Group’s publicly traded units. In April, Shanghai-listed
Qingdao Haier Co. said it approved the appointment of Liang Haishan as chairman, replacing Yang.  Zhou, 46, has been general manager and an  executive
director  at Haier Electronics since November 2009 and was
appointed CEO on March 18, the company said. He joined the Haier
Group in 1988 after completing a bachelor’s degree in
engineering.  Haier Electronics says the board has a “vast majority” of
non-executive directors, so having Zhou hold both the CEO and
chairman positions “will not have a negative influence on the
balance of power between the board and the management.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
