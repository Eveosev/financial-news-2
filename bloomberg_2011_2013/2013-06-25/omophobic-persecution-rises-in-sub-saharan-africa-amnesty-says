Homophobic persecution is surging
across sub-Saharan  Africa  as some governments introduce
punishments, such as the death penalty, on those in same-sex
relationships, Amnesty International said.  “These attacks -- sometimes deadly -- must be stopped,”
Widney Brown, Amnesty’s director of law and policy, said today
in a  report . “No one should be beaten or killed because of who
they are attracted to or intimately involved with.”  Amnesty said some police officers in Kenya threatened
citizens with laws related to same-sex relations so that they
could be bribed. In Cameroon, some people arrested for appearing
to be gay or lesbian were imprisoned for three years without
trial or charge, the London-based human rights group said.  Homosexuality is a crime in 38 countries in sub-Saharan
Africa, and in the past five years South Sudan and Burundi have
introduced new laws that criminalize same-sex sexual acts,
Amnesty said. Liberia, Nigeria and Uganda have bills pending in
parliament that seek to increase existing penalties.  “The very existence of laws criminalizing same sex-relations -- whether they are enforced or not -- sends a toxic
message that lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people are
criminals and have no rights,” Brown said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
