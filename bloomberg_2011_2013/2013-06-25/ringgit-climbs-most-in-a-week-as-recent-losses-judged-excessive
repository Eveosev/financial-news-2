Malaysia’s ringgit strengthened the
most in more than a week, rebounding from a three-year low, as
some investors judged this month’s losses excessive.  The currency’s 3.6 percent slump in June is Asia’s worst
performance after the Indian rupee’s 5.3 percent slide. The
dollar’s 14-day relative strength index versus the ringgit
reached 74 today, above the 70 threshold level that suggests it
may decline. The Malaysian unit also gained after two Federal
Reserve presidents signaled U.S. monetary policy will remain
accommodative even after asset purchases are phased out.  “The ringgit has been oversold this month,” said Yeah Kim Leng, chief economist at RAM Holdings Bhd. in  Kuala Lumpur .
“The Malaysian currency could rebound to 3.00 to 3.10 by the
end of the year as it is backed by solid fundamentals.”  The ringgit appreciated 0.3 percent to 3.2105 per dollar as
of 10:31 a.m. in Kuala Lumpur, the biggest advance since June
14, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The currency
touched 3.2222 yesterday, the weakest level since July 2010.  One-month implied volatility, a measure of exchange-rate
swings used to price options, increased two basis points, or
0.02 percentage point, to 10.39 percent today.  Fed Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  signaled on June 19 the
central bank may “moderate” its $85 billion in monthly bond
purchases, known as quantitative easing, later this year and end
it by mid-2014 if the  U.S. economy  improves.  Fed Outlook  Investors shouldn’t overreact to the Fed’s plan to reduce
the pace of asset purchases,  Richard Fisher , president of the
Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, said yesterday. Minneapolis Fed
President  Narayana Kocherlakota  said the monetary authority must
emphasize in its statement that policy will remain accommodative
“for a considerable time” after the end of quantitative
easing.  The Malaysian economy  grew  4.1 percent in the first three
months of the year, the 14th consecutive quarter of expansion,
according to official data.  Government bonds  declined for a sixth day. The yield on the
3.48 percent notes due March 2023 gained five basis points to
3.73 percent, the highest since the securities were sold in
March, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
