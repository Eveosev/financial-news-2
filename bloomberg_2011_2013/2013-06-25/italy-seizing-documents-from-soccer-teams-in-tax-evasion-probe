Italian finance police were given
authorization to seize documents from at least 35 soccer clubs
as part of a probe into fraudulent activities, according to a
statement today.  The probe involves taxes that may not have been paid on
player contracts and possible irregularities in transfers and
player-agent relationships, according to the statement, which
was issued by Naples prosecutors. Management of images and
television rights is also part of the probe, according to the
statement.  Clubs involved in the probe include  Juventus Football Club
SpA (JUVE)  and AC Milan, owned by former Prime Minister Silvio
Berlusconi.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
