A gauge of U.S. corporate credit
risk declined from a six-month high as investors awaited reports
on durable-goods orders and home sales.  The Markit CDX North American Investment Grade Index, a
credit-default swaps benchmark that investors use to hedge
against losses or to speculate on creditworthiness, decreased
2.9 basis points to a mid-price of 94.8 basis points at 8 a.m.
in  New York , according to prices compiled by Bloomberg.  Investors are concerned that the  Federal Reserve  may begin
reducing its $85 billion in monthly bond purchases that have
boosted the credit markets. The speculation has increased the
risk measure in four of the last five trading sessions.  The credit-swaps index typically falls as investor
confidence improves and rises as it deteriorates. The contracts
pay the buyer face value if a borrower fails to meet its
obligations, less the value of the defaulted debt. A basis point
equals $1,000 annually on a contract protecting $10 million of
debt.  U.S. durable-goods orders grew 3 percent in May after
rising 3.5 percent the prior month, economists in a Bloomberg
survey projected before a report from the Commerce Department at
8:30 a.m. in  Washington . A report at 10 a.m. may show sales of
new homes rose to a 460,000 annualized pace in May, the highest
since July 2008, a separate survey showed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
