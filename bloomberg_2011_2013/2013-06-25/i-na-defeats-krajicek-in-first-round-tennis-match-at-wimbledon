Top seeds Novak Djokovic and Serena Williams won in straight sets to advance to the second round of
the Wimbledon tennis tournament.  Women’s defending champion Williams beat Mandy Minella of
Luxembourg 6-1, 6-3 yesterday to extend her winning streak to 32
matches. Djokovic, the 2011 titleholder, opened with a 6-3, 7-5,
6-4 defeat of  Germany ’s Florian Mayer.  Williams’s victory put the 31-year-old American into a tie
with Justine Henin for the second-longest women’s winning streak
since 2000, when her sister, Venus Williams, won 35 in a row.
Playing at Wimbledon, where she won her fifth singles title last
year and two gold medals at the London Olympics a month later,
has brought back “amazing memories,” Serena Williams said.  “I love playing here,” she said at a news conference.
“It definitely felt good to step out there and be on the court
and hit some balls around.”  Defending men’s champion Roger Federer takes on Ukrainian
Sergiy Stakhovsky in the second round today, while No. 2 seed
Andy Murray of Britain plays Yen-Hsun Lu of  Taiwan . Women’s
second seed, Victoria Azarenka of Belarus, faces Italy’s Flavia Pennetta and Russia’s Maria Sharapova, the No. 3 seed, plays
Michelle Larcher de Brito of Portugal  China ’s Li Na, the No. 6 seed, beat Michaella Krajicek of
the Netherlands 6-1, 6-1 in another first-round match yesterday.
Krajicek’s brother, Richard, was the 1996 Wimbledon men’s
champion.  “Last two years, I didn’t doing well in the grass court,”
Li, the 2011 French Open winner, told reporters. “I was shocked
a little bit. I have to get used to play on the grass.”  Stosur Advances  Australia ’s Samantha Stosur, the 2011 U.S. Open champion,
beat Slovakia’s Anna Schmiedlova 6-1, 6-3, while American
Madison Keys defeated Britain’s Heather Watson 6-3, 7-5. No. 7
seed Angelique Kerber of Germany got past Bethanie Mattek-Sands
of the U.S. 6-3, 6-4, and Britain’s Laura Robson upset  Russia ’s
Maria Kirilenko, the 10th seed, 6-3, 6-4. Poland’s Agnieszka Radwanska, the fourth seed, beat Yvonne Meusburger of Austria
6-1, 6-1.  A year after knocking then-reigning U.S. Open champion
Stosur out of the second round of Wimbledon, Arantxa Rus
yesterday tied the longest losing streak in WTA Tour history.  The Dutch player, a former junior world No. 1, was beaten
by Russia’s Olga Puchkova 6-4, 6-2. It was Rus’s 17th straight
main-draw defeat, tying her with U.S. player Sandy Collins, who
lost the same number of matches between 1984 and 1987.  “In the beginning of the year I was serving not good,”
said Rus. “In the last month, I played better tennis, but you
need to play very good to win matches in this level.”  Oldest Woman  Japan ’s Kimiko Date-Krumm, at 42 the oldest women in the
singles event, got past Carina Witthoeft 6-0, 6-2. Date-Krumm
made her first appearance at Wimbledon in 1989, almost six years
before her German opponent was born.  In the men’s draw, Djokovic won in his first competitive
match since being beaten in the French Open semifinals by Rafael Nadal, who lost in the first round two days ago. The Paris
defeat ended the 26-year-old Serb’s attempt to win his seventh
Grand Slam after he began 2013 with the Australian Open title.  “It was a very satisfying performance,” Djokovic said.
“I can play better. For the first match, it’s normal to expect
that you’re still kind of finding your rhythm and adjusting to a
new surface and new movement. Hopefully I can elevate my game as
the tournament goes on.”  Ferrer, Del Potro  Men’s fourth seed David Ferrer of Spain beat Martin Alund
of Argentina 6-1, 4-6, 7-5, 6-2, while  France ’s Richard Gasquet,
the ninth seed, defeated Spain’s Marcel Granollers 6-7 (2-7),
6-4, 7-5, 6-4.  No. 8 Juan Martin del Potro of Argentina defeated Spain’s
Albert Ramos in straight sets. The 2009 U.S. Open champion
didn’t play in the French Open because of a respiratory illness.  No. 12 Kei Nishikori of Japan defeated Australian Matthew
Ebden 6-2, 6-4, 6-3, while  Croatia ’s Ivan Dodig advanced when
16th-seeded German Philipp Kohlschreiber, who won the first two
sets, retired in the fifth. American James Blake, Canadian Jesse
Levine and South Africa’s Kevin Anderson also advanced.  No. 21 Sam Querrey of the U.S. lost to Australia’s Bernard Tomic in five sets. Tomic, a 2011 quarterfinalist, won 7-6
(8-6), 7-6 (7-3), 3-6, 2-6, 6-3. Tommy Haas, the 13th seed from
Germany, beat Russia’s Dmitry Tursunov 6-3, 7-5, 7-5.  To contact the reporter on this story:
