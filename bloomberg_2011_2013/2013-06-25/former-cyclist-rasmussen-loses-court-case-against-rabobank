Former  Tour de France  rider Michael Rasmussen, who was banned for doping, was rightfully dismissed
by the Rabobank cycling team in July 2007, a Dutch court ruled
today.  Rasmussen was appealing against a 2012 ruling that he had
been dismissed fairly. He was ordered to repay Rabobank 663,892
euros ($871,000) of the 715,000 euros he received from the bank
due to a 2008 ruling, the Arnhem district court said.  Rasmussen in January admitted he used banned performance-enhancing substances for 12 years and retired from cycling.  The Dane was leading the 2007  Tour de France  when he was
pulled out amid claims from his Rabobank team that he lied about
his whereabouts in the period leading up the race to avoid
doping tests. He served a two-year ban and had his contract
terminated by Rabobank for missing three tests.  Rabobank Groep, a Dutch mortgage lender, in October ended
its 17-year sponsorship of cycling after the team was linked to
the doping scandal.  To contact the reporter on this story:
