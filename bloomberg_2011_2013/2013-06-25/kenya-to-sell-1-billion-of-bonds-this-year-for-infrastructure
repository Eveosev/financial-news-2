Kenya announced it’s seeking a lead
manager to help carry out the sale of $1 billion of sovereign
bonds this year to fund infrastructure projects in  East Africa ’s
biggest economy.  The country is also seeking international lead-counsel
services to arrange the sale, according to a statement published
by the Treasury in the Nairobi-based Standard newspaper today.  The offering will enable the government “to diversify its
investor base, establish a pricing benchmark for future issuance
by both the public and private sector, as well as to promote the
republic’s reputation and visibility amongst the international
investor community,” it said.  Kenyan Treasury Secretary Henry Rotich announced on June 14
the country plans to sell its first Eurobond by the end of
September. The offering, which has been delayed since at least
2007, follows sales by other African nations that were
oversubscribed as governments in the world’s poorest continent
take advantage of record-low  interest rates .  Standard & Poor’s and Fitch Ratings have a B+ rating on
Kenyan debt. That’s four levels below investment-grade and on
par with Zambia and  Cape Verde . It has the equivalent B1 rating
from Moody’s Investors Service.  The deadline for expressions of interest for both positions
is July 15, according to Treasury’s statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
