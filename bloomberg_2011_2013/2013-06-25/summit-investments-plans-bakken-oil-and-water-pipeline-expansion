Summit Investments, as closely held
 Summit Midstream Partners LLC (SMLP)  is known, will spend $60 million
to build an additional 145 miles (233 kilometers) of pipelines
in the Bakken oil-shale region, the company said in a statement
today.  The expansion, part of the Divide system, is in addition to
about $200 million in  capital spending  planned for 2013. The
projectâ€™s broadening comes after Summit said May 17 it would
construct the Polar crude oil and water-gathering system for
Bakken in Williams County, North Dakota.  Summit on June 5 announced $460 million in acquisitions in
the Bakken and Marcellus fields as it plans to nearly double the
amount of gas it gathers there.  To contact the reporter on this story:
