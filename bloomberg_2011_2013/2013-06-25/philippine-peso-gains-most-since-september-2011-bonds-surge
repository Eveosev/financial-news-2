The Philippine peso strengthened the
most since September 2011 and  government bonds  surged as the
central bank said it’s not considering measures to curb outflows.  The currency extended gains after Chinese authorities said
interbank liquidity risk is controllable, adding to speculation
they will take steps to ease a cash crunch. Bangko Sentral ng
Pilipinas isn’t thinking of measures to stem capital outflows,
Governor Amando Tetangco said in a mobile-phone text message
today. The peso fell 2.8 percent this month as Federal Reserve
Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said June 19 the central bank’s
stimulus program may be tapered this year and halted in 2014.  “The near-term rebound depends on the U.S. policy outlook,
a calmer market and some stability in China liquidity
conditions,” said Irene Cheung, a currency strategist in
 Singapore  at Australia & New Zealand Banking Group.  The peso gained 0.9 percent to 43.475 per dollar in  Manila ,
according to Tullet Prebon Plc. It reached an 18-month low of
44.2 on June 21. The yield on the 8 percent government bonds due
July 2031 fell 50 basis points, or 0.5 percentage point, to 5.25
percent, according to prices from Tradition Financial Services.
It jumped as high as 6.25 percent earlier.  The  Philippines ’ benchmark stock index dropped 3.1 percent
today after being down as much as 4.9 percent earlier. Foreign
investors pulled $391 million from local shares and bonds in the
three weeks through June 21, according to research notes from
ANZ, citing EPFR Global data.  The finance ministry plans to raise 150 billion pesos ($3.5
billion) from a sale of three- and five-year securities in the
third quarter, Treasurer Rosalia de Leon said in a memorandum
sent to traders today. It also plans to sell 30 billion pesos of
10-year retail notes next month, she said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
