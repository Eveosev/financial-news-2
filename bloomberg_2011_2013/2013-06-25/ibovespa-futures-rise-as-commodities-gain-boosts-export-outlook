The Ibovespa rebounded from its
biggest two-day drop since July 2012 as  Usinas Siderurgicas de
Minas Gerais SA (USIM3)  led steelmakers higher, following a rally in
commodity prices.  Vale SA (VALE3) , the world’s largest iron-ore producer, rose from a
four-year low.  Cia. Paranaense de Energia , the electricity
distributor also known as Copel, gained after Banco Espirito
Santo de Investimento SA raised its recommendation to buy.  The Ibovespa rose 2 percent to 46,893.04 at the close of
trading in Sao Paulo, paring this month’s decline to 12 percent.
The real climbed 0.6 percent to 2.2139 per dollar. The Bloomberg
Base Metals 3-Month Price Commodity Index added 1.4 percent as
Ling Tao, deputy director of the Shanghai branch of the People’s
Bank of China, said the central bank will keep money-market
rates at a “reasonable” level and seasonal forces that have
driven them up will fade.  “Those remarks from the official from the People’s Bank of
 China  helped to soothe investors,” Luis Gustavo Pereira, an
analyst at Futura Corretora in Sao Paulo, said by phone from Sao
Paulo. “This is particularly important for  Brazil , given that
China is a big trading partner.”  Usiminas, as Usinas Siderurgicas is also known, gained 10
percent to 8.24 reais. Steelmaker Gerdau SA advanced 2.1 percent
to 12.12 reais. Vale rose 2.3 percent to 27.50 reais. Copel
increased 3 percent to 27.19 reais.  Sugar and ethanol producer  Sao Martinho SA (SMTO3)  fell 1.8 percent
to 25.53 reais after posting a quarterly profit that missed
analysts’ estimates.  China Concern  Airline  Gol Linhas Aereas Inteligentes SA (GOLL3)  gained 11 percent
to 7.50 reais, snapping a six-day losing streak, the longest
since April 2012.  MMX Mineracao & Metalicos SA,  Eike Batista ’s mining
company, jumped 18 percent to 1.65 reais in a second day of
gains as it seeks to sell assets to raise cash.  Fifty-eight stocks climbed on the Ibovespa today while 11
fell. The benchmark dropped 4.7 percent in the previous two
sessions amid concern that slowing growth in China would sap
Brazilian exports. The gauge slumped into a bear market on June
11 after falling more than 20 percent from this year’s peak on
Jan. 3. It has since extended the loss to 26 percent.  Toll-road operator  CCR SA (CCRO3)  added 3.1 percent to 16.75 reais,
snapping a five-day rout that drove shares 11 percent lower.
Competitor  EcoRodovias Infraestrutura e Logistica SA  gained 1.7
percent to 14.75 reais today.  Stocks in the industry are attractive in part because they
are shielded from the real’s tumble, JPMorgan Chase & Co.
analysts Fernando Abdalla and Carlos Louro wrote in a research
note to clients today.  Street Protests  “We see a buying opportunity for investors seeking
exposure to a relatively stable, inflation-protected sector,
combined with little exposure to” currency depreciation, the
JPMorgan analysts wrote. The real has tumbled 8.7 percent in the
second quarter.  Toll-road operators sank yesterday after the state of Sao
Paulo canceled toll increases of as much as 6.5 percent after
street protests demanding improved transportation, better
schools and more hospitals.  The Ibovespa trades at 11.6 times analysts’  earnings
estimates  for the next four quarters, compared with 9.6 for the
MSCI  Emerging Markets  Index of 21 developing nations’ equities.  Foreign investors have pulled 4.93 billion reais from Latin
America’s largest equity market this month through June 20, data
from the exchange show. Trading volume for stocks in Sao Paulo
was 6.96 billion reais today, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. That compares with a daily average of 7.92 billion
reais this year through June 21, according to data  compiled  by
the exchange.  To contact the reporter on this story:
