For a celebrity known for keeping her private life private, a home can serve as a window into the past. Such is the case with  Jodie Foster’s Hollywood Hills home , now on the market for $6.399 million. The 50-year-old actress, director and producer has let her resume do most of the talking — from her breakthrough Coppertone commercial at age 3, to her graduation from Yale with honors and two Academy Awards. But her personal life made headlines while she was living at  9219 Flicker Way, Los Angeles, CA 90069 . Foster was set to play the lead in “Double Jeopardy” when, according to  People magazine , producer Leonard Goldberg got a note saying she was dropping out of the movie “for medical reasons.” Foster offered no further explanation at the time. But word quickly spread that she was pregnant with her first son, Charlie, raising questions about paternity and conception. Fortunately, Foster had an escape from the paparazzi in her new Spanish villa, which could be discretely accessed from a rear-gated driveway. The home, located in the distinguished Bird Streets, has 4 bedrooms, 4 full baths, 2 half-baths and an attached guest suite — plenty of room for her new baby and girlfriend at the time, Cydney Bernard. “The Silence of the Lambs” star  reportedly  updated part of the home soon after she bought it in 1997, while maintaining its 1930s Spanish style. Overhead beams, brick patios and a backyard pool are a few highlights, as well as a large media screening/kids’ play room. With her second son, Christopher “Kit” Foster, entering the teenage years, Foster isn’t an empty nester quite yet. Last year she bought a new Beverly Hills home for $11.75 million, which will likely become her new primary residence.
