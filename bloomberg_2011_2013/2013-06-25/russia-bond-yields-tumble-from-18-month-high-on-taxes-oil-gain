The ruble weakened for the first
time in three days as  ING Groep NV (INGA)  lowered its forecast for the
currency of the world’s biggest energy exporter, citing possible
U.S. stimulus curbs and lower oil prices.  The ruble fell 0.5 percent against the dollar to 32.8660 by
6 p.m. in Moscow and retreated 0.4 percent to 37.4536 against
the central bank’s dollar-euro basket.  The Russian currency and debt joined a global market rout
last week after Federal Reserve Chairman Ben S. Bernanke said
the regulator may start reducing bond purchases that fueled
asset-price gains, and end the program in 2014 should risks to
the U.S. economy abate. ING cut its third-quarter forecast for
the ruble 6.5 percent to 34.30 against the dollar from a 32.18
estimate in May, according to an e-mailed note today. ING sees
Brent oil averaging $105 a barrel from the fourth quarter to the
third next year compared with an estimate of $110-$115 earlier.  “Tighter U.S. financial conditions and our new, lower
forecast for Brent force us to revise our ruble outlook to the
weaker side,” Dmitry Polevoy, an economist at ING in Moscow,
said in the note. “We’re convinced that the U.S. dollar is
about to embark on a cyclical rally, the likes of which has not
been seen since the late 1990s.”  Brent pared last week’s 4.7 percent drop, rising 0.1
percent to $101.27 per barrel. ING sees the ruble at 36 rubles
against the dollar in the fourth quarter of 2014 and at 35.20
rubles in the same period the following year, the report shows.  Canceled Auctions  The Finance Ministry canceled a June 26 ruble-bond auction
yesterday, the last this quarter, citing market conditions.
 Russia  axed a June 5 sale and shelved an auction of 10 billion
rubles ($304 million) of 15-year notes last week on a lack of
competitive bids. The government scrapped a May 22 sale for the
same reason and sold only 900 million rubles of 20 billion
rubles in securities offered on May 29.  The central bank started buying rubles on May 29 to slow
its slide. Bank Rossii, which reports currency intervention data
with a delay and intervenes if the ruble weakens beyond certain
levels against the dollar-euro target basket,  spent  the
equivalent of 6.55 billion rubles of foreign currency on June
21, it said today.  The ruble weakened even as bond yields fell and companies
bought the local currency to pay taxes. Orders for U.S. durable
goods rose more than forecast in May, reflecting broad-based
gains that signal manufacturing is stabilizing in the world’s
biggest economy.  The yield on Russia’s Eurobonds due March 2030 fell 20
basis points to 4.431 percent, after climbing to the highest
since December 2011 yesterday. The yield on benchmark ruble
bonds due 2027 fell nine basis points to 8.28 percent, the first
drop in four days.  To contact the reporter on this story:
