Japanese  shares  swung between gains
and losses after Chinese stocks entered a bear market yesterday.
Shipping lines led advances while consumer lenders fell the most
among the 33 Topix index industry groups.  The Topix dropped 0.4 percent to 1,085.04 as of 9:39 a.m.
in Tokyo, after rising as much as 0.1 percent. The Nikkei 225
Stock Average fell 0.2 percent to 13,031.63.  Kawasaki Kisen Kaisha Ltd. (9107)  led shipping companies higher,
advancing 4 percent. eGuarantee Inc. dropped 5.2 percent, pacing
losses among consumer lenders. Rakuten Inc. fell 3.5 percent
after the online retailer’s investment rating was cut by
Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley Securities.  The Topix has fallen about 15 percent from an almost five-year high on May 22 after Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s growth
strategy disappointed investors and amid concern global stimulus
will be cut. The measure is still up 26 percent this year.  Japan ’s broader gauge traded at 13.7 times average
estimated earnings through yesterday, compared with multiples of
14.3 for the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index and 12.2 for the Stoxx
