New Zealand defeated  England  by five
runs in the first Twenty20 cricket match between the nations.  Brendon McCullum scored 68 runs and Hamish Rutherford added
62 from 35 balls at the Oval as New Zealand reached 201-4, their
highest total overseas in the shortest form of the game. Luke Wright led England with 52 runs and Alex Hales contributed 39
for the host, which finished on 196-5.  Wright also took two wickets for 31 runs, while Jade
Dernbach and Boyd Rankin claimed one each. Nathan McCullum,
Ronnie Hira, Ian Butler and Mitchell McClenaghan each took a
wicket for New Zealand.  England also lost by five runs two days ago to  India  in the
Champions Trophy final, which was reduced to 20 overs per side
by rain.  The second Twenty20 game is scheduled for June 27 at the
same south London venue, the final match of New Zealandâ€™s tour.
England swept the Black Caps 2-0 in their Test series before New
Zealand won the one-day series 2-1.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
