Turkish soccer clubs Fenerbahce and
Besiktas have been banned from European competition after an
investigation into allegations of match-fixing.  European soccer’s governing body  UEFA  announced the
sanctions in a  statement  today after saying June 10 it would
open disciplinary proceedings against the teams and club
officials.  Fenerbahce, the runnerup to Galatasaray in the Turkish
league last season, is excluded from the next three UEFA
competitions it qualifies for, including the elite  Champions
League  in 2013-14. The ban for the third season is deferred for
five years, Nyon, Switzerland-based UEFA said.  Besiktas, which finished third in the league, is banned
from next season’s Europa League, the continent’s second-tier
club competition.  UEFA also deferred for five years a ban that would keep
Romanian champion Steaua Bucharest out of the next European
competition it qualifies for. The ban is related to Steaua’s
breach of Champions League participation regulations.  All three clubs can take the decisions to UEFA’s appeals
panel, the governing body said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
