Morgan Stanley lowered its forecasts
for gold, joining Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and UBS AG in paring
estimates on prospects that the U.S. Federal Reserve will scale
back monetary stimulus as the economy recovers.  The bank cut its 2013 target to $1,409 an ounce from
$1,487, reduced its prediction for 2014 to $1,313 from $1,563,
and trimmed its 2015 estimate to $1,300 from $1,450. Morgan
Stanley also lowered its gold and silver forecasts through 2018,
analysts Peter Richardson and Joel Crane wrote in a report.  Analysts from BNP Paribas SA to Standard Bank Plc are
cutting their outlook for gold as the precious metal heads for
its biggest annual drop in more than three decades. Bullion has
fallen 24 percent in 2013 after rallying for 12 years, slumping
to the lowest level since September 2010 last week after Fed
Chairman Ben S. Bernanke said the central bank may slow its
bond-buying program if the U.S. economy continues to improve.  “With investor demand for safe-haven assets waning against
the backdrop of a strengthening U.S. dollar and rising U.S. bond
yields, market conditions for gold and silver have become
markedly less favorable,” Morgan Stanley analysts wrote.  Gold for immediate delivery fell 0.5 percent to $1,276.09
today after tumbling to $1,269.46 on June 21, the cheapest since
Sept. 16, 2010. Investors sold 541.5 metric tons from bullion-backed  exchange-traded products  this year, erasing $56 billion
from the value of the funds.  ETP Slump  Holdings in ETPs declined to 2,090.4 tons yesterday, the
least since June 2010, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
Assets are down 21 percent in 2013 after climbing every year
since the first product was listed in 2003, as waning investor
faith turned more serious, said Morgan Stanley.  “This historic and fundamental change in one of the key
drivers of the gold bull market is highlighting a sharp decline
in the desirability of this form of investment,” Richardson and
Crane wrote.  Goldman, which expects ETPs to decline at a steady pace of
1 million ounces a month, cut its 2013 year-end price target to
$1,300 from $1,435 and lowered the 2014 prediction to $1,050
from $1,270. Investors are assuming an earlier tapering of
quantitative easing and a Fed fund rate increase sooner than the
bank’s economists expect, analysts Damien Courvalin and  Jeffrey Currie  wrote in a June 23 report.  Bernanke said on June 19 that the central bank, which buys
$85 billion of Treasury and mortgage debt each month, may begin
reducing purchases this year and end the program in 2014. This
will keep gold prices under pressure, according to James Steel
and Howard Wen at HSBC Securities (USA) Inc., who yesterday
reduced their 2013 forecast to $1,396 from $1,542 and trimmed
their 2014 estimate to $1,435 from $1,600. Credit Suisse Group
Inc. lowered its estimates today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
