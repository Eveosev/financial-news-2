Zimbabwean Prime Minister  Morgan Tsvangirai  asked the Constitutional Court to delay elections in
the southern African nation, according to papers filed yesterday
at the tribunal.  Tsvangirai, who leads the main faction of the Movement for
Democratic Change, and other opponents of President  Robert Mugabe  say there’s not enough time to finish voter registration
and the nomination of potential lawmakers before the vote, which
is scheduled for July 31. Southern African leaders also called
for a delay at a June 15 meeting.  “I respectfully emphasize the need to prevent a legitimacy
deficit which would plunge the country into further
uncertainty,” Tsvangirai said in his submission to the court.
“There have been electoral disputes since 2000 where outcomes
have contested largely because of the legal and political
environment in which they are held.”  Mugabe set the date for presidential and parliamentary
elections after a  Constitutional Court  ruling in May that they
be held no later than the end of July.  The MDC has shared power with Mugabe’s Zimbabwe African
National Union-Patriotic Front party since the  Southern African
Development Community  brokered an agreement following a March
2009 vote, which the 15-nation group said wasn’t free and fair.  While the MDC won the parliamentary elections, Tsvangirai
withdrew from a presidential run-off ballot in June 2008, citing
the death of more than 200 MDC supporters and assaults on 3,000
party members by Zanu-PF loyalists in the party militia and the
security forces.  The MDC says Mugabe must end abuses by the police and
military, and allow equal access to state-owned media under the
terms of SADC’s charter for the country.  To contact the reporter on this story:
