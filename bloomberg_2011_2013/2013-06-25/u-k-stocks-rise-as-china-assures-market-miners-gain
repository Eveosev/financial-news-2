U.K. stocks  rose, rebounding from
the biggest four-day drop in 19 months, as China’s central bank
allayed concern over a cash crunch and investors awaited data
that may show U.S. durable-goods orders and house sales climbed.  Fresnillo Plc (FRES)  and  Antofagasta Plc (ANTO)  each added at least 1.5
percent as a gauge of mining companies rose from its lowest
level since July 2009.  ARM Holdings Plc (ARM)  gained the most in four
weeks after Investec Plc advised investors to buy the shares.
 Rexam Plc (REX)  fell for a fifth day as it said full-year results will
be lower than it previously expected.  The benchmark  FTSE 100 Index (UKX)  gained 31.21 points, or 0.5
percent, to 6,060.31 at 8:57 a.m. in London, rebounding from a
5.4 percent loss in the past four days. The gauge is still
heading for a 7.9 percent decline in June, the biggest monthly
retreat since October 2008, after the Federal Reserve signaled
it may end bond buying next year if the U.S. economy improves in
line with forecasts. The FTSE All-Share Index added 0.5 percent,
while Ireland’s ISEQ Index rose 0.9 percent today.  Liquidity risks in  China ’s financial markets are
controllable and seasonal forces affecting interest rates will
fade, a People’s Bank of China official said. The central bank
will monitor the money-market rate and keep it at reasonable
levels, according to Ling Tao, deputy director of the PBOC’s
Shanghai branch.  The bank yesterday urged lenders to control risks from
credit expansion, after money-market rates climbed to an all-time high last week. The Shanghai Composite Index closed 0.2
percent lower, paring an earlier slump of as much as 5.8
percent.  In the U.S.,  durable-goods orders  probably grew 3 percent
in May after rising a revised 3.5 percent the prior month,
economists forecast before a Commerce Department report at 8:30
a.m. in  Washington . Separate data may show  sales  of new houses
increased to a 460,000 annualized pace in May, the highest since
July 2008, from a 454,000 rate in April, according to the median
estimate of economists.  To contact the reporter on this story:
