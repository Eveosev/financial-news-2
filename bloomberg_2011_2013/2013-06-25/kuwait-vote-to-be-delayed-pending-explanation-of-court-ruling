Kuwait ’s parliamentary elections,
set for July 25, will be delayed pending a Constitutional Court
statement explaining its ruling last week that dissolved the
National Assembly and ordered the vote.  The  Council of Ministers  decided yesterday “to suspend all
decrees and measures taken to implement” the June 16 court
ruling until the explanation is published, to ensure that all
measures taken are constitutional, state-run  KUNA  reported. The
court explanation, based on a request by former lawmaker
AbdulHamid Dashti, is due tomorrow.  According to Kuwaiti law, a decree by the emir calling for
elections must be published in the Official Gazette at least one
month before the vote. That means the deadline for the balloting
to be held on July 25 has already passed.  The  Constitutional Court  on June 16 issued a ruling
upholding an amended voting law decreed by Emir Sheikh Sabah Al-Ahmed Al-Sabah. The court also ordered parliament, elected in
December, to be dissolved and new elections to be held.  To contact the reporter on this story:
