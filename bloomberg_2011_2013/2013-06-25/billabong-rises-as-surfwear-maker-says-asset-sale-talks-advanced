Billabong International Ltd. (BBG) , the
40-year-old Australian surfwear company, said refinancing and
asset-sale talks with former suitors Sycamore Partners
Management and Altamont Capital Partners are “well advanced.”  Shares in the company, which has breached debt repayment
terms, surged as much as 35 percent following the statement to
the Australian stock exchange and were 31 percent higher at 17
Australian cents at 2:49 p.m. in Sydney.  The Gold Coast, Australia-based retailer, whose  market
value  reached A$3.84 billion ($3.54 billion) in May 2007, has
fallen about 80 percent this year after raising capital, selling
assets and rejecting at least two takeover bids in less than two
years. The company cut its earnings forecast again earlier this
month and said it may sell Canadian retail chain West 49 to
repay debt.  Billabong, which announced the refinancing and asset-sale
talks with Sycamore Partners and Altamont on June 4, said today
any proceeds would be used to repay in full its syndicated debt
facilities.  To contact the reporter on this story:
