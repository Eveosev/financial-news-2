John Tortorella  is set to be
introduced as coach of the Vancouver Canucks today after
spending the past 4 1/2 years with the  New York  Rangers and
guiding the team to the playoffs the past three seasons.  Tortorella will replace Alain Vigneault, who took the
Rangers’ vacancy after being fired by the Canucks,  ESPN has
reported , citing people familiar with the situation.  The Canucks, who went 26-15-7 this season before getting
swept by the  San Jose Sharks  in the first round of the National
Hockey League playoffs, have scheduled a news conference for
later today.  Tortorella, who turned 55 yesterday, has won 410 games over
parts of 13 seasons as an NHL coach and captured a Stanley Cup
title with the  Tampa Bay Lightning  during the 2003-04 campaign.  Vigneault, 52, had a 313-170-57 record in Vancouver and the
team won the Northwest Division each of the last five seasons,
though 2012-13 was a step back for a franchise that has become
one of the NHL’s regular Stanley Cup contenders. The Canucks
were 19th among the league’s 30 teams in goals per game, and
ranked in the bottom 10 in power-play percentage and faceoff
percentage. They’ve also lost 10 of their last 11 playoff games.  To contact the reporter on this story:
