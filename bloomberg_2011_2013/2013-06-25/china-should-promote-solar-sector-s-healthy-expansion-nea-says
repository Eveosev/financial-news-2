China  asked local governments to
study policies supporting the development of  solar  energy in
their districts and to explore new markets for the distribution
of the technology.  Authorities should look closely into the guidelines for
adopting the use of solar power, starting with small
experimental projects before rolling them out on a bigger scale,
Wu Xinxiong, the head of the country’s National Energy
Administration, said in a  statement  on its website yesterday.  China, the world’s largest solar panel maker, is seeking to
boost domestic demand for the products as rising trade tensions
with the European Union slow exports and governments reduce
clean-energy subsidies. China and  Japan  are forecast to become
the world’s two top solar markets this year, according to
Bloomberg New Energy Finance.  The European Union this month imposed provisional tariffs
at an initial rate of 11.8 percent on imports of solar panels
from China after an investigation found they were being sold in
the 27-nation bloc at less than their production cost.  China said in a statement on the central government’s
website on June 14 that it would boost demand for solar-generated electricity on the mainland and provide easier
financing to manufacturers. Wu said solar is an important
renewable energy source and an emerging industry in which China
has a global competitive advantage.  To contact the reporter on this story:
