International Business Machines
Corp. (IBM)  started a program with Dutch authorities to investigate
how to analyze water and flood data in the Netherlands, almost a
fifth of which is covered by lakes, rivers and dikes.  “The initiative will provide water experts with a real-time intelligent dashboard to harness information so it can be
shared immediately across organizations and agencies,” IBM said
today in a statement. Collaboration partners include an
Environment Ministry office and the University of Delft, said
IBM, based in Armonk, New York.  The new management system in the Netherlands, where a
quarter of the land is below sea level, will address concerns
ranging from drinking water quality to the increasing frequency
and impact of extreme weather, IBM said. The data sources
include water level monitors, levee sensors and current and
historic maintenance information from sluices, pumping stations
and dams.  “By modeling weather events, the Netherlands will be able
to determine the best course of action including storing water,
diverting it from low-lying areas, avoiding saltwater intrusion
into drinking water, sewage overflows and water contamination,”
the largest computer-services provider said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
