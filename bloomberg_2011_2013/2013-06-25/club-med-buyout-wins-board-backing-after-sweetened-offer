Gaillon Invest, the holding company
created by Axa Private Equity and  Fosun International Ltd. (656)  to
buy  Club Mediterranee SA (CU) , secured the backing of more
shareholders after raising its bid for the resort operator.  Gaillon and partners will now offer 17.50 euros per Club
Med share, compared with an initial offer of 17 euros, and 19.79
euros per convertible bond outstanding, versus 19.23 euros
initially, the company said in a statement today.  Club Medâ€™s board favors the offer, and investors
represented on the board pledged to tender 14.9 percent of
shares outstanding, Gaillon said. That brings the stock
controlled by the bidders to 34.23 percent. The offer is valid
subject to acceptance by owners of 50 percent of the shares.  A transaction including debt would be the biggest
acquisition of a travel-services company in six years, and may
end almost half a century of public listing for Paris-based Club
Med, which started on the Mediterranean island of Mallorca in
1950 in a village of used military tents.  Club Med  shares  have closed above 17 euros every day since
May 28, the day after Axa and Fosun, its largest shareholders,
announced their plan to team up with management to buy the
company, indicating investors may be betting on a sweetened
offer. The stock rose as much as 0.9 percent to 17.47 euros and
was trading up 0.5 percent at 9:16 a.m. in Paris.  To contact the reporter on this story:
