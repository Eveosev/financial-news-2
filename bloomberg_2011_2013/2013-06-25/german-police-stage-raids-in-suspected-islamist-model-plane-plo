German authorities carried out raids
on suspected Islamists who may have planned to use satellite-guided model airplanes to carry out terrorist attacks, a  Federal
Prosecutor’s Office  spokeswoman said.  “We have carried out searches with the Stuttgart
prosecutor on suspicion of preparing serious violence
threatening the state and money laundering,” spokeswoman
Angelika Walther said by telephone from Karlsruhe. Raids were
carried out in the Stuttgart and Munich areas as well as in
eastern Saxony state and  Belgium , she said.  Walther confirmed a report by public broadcaster SWR that
special-forces units were deployed with police on suspicion of
possible terrorist preparations by Islamists. Some of those
being investigated are from  Tunisia  and study at Stuttgart
University, where they developed methods to fly model aircraft
guided by the Global Positioning System, SWR said. Documents and
technical equipment have been seized, SWR said.  Nine apartments and other sites were raided in both  Germany 
and Belgium, the prosecutor’s office said in an e-mailed
statement. About 90 police officers took part in the raids in
Germany, according to the statement, which said two suspects are
of “Tunisian origin.”  Separately, the Stuttgart public prosecutor is
investigating men who transferred money and are suspected of
money laundering to support extremists, SWR said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
