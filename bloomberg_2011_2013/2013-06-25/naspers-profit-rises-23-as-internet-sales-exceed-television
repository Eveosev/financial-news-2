Naspers Ltd. (NPN) , Africa’s largest media
group, said full-year profit rose 23 percent after a surge in
Internet revenue and growth in DSTV pay-television subscribers.  Adjusted net income was 8.5 billion rand ($848 million) in
the 12 months through March, the Cape Town-based company said in
a  statement  today. That beat the 8 billion-rand median of nine
analyst estimates in a Bloomberg survey.  “These results are underpinned by a diverse portfolio, a
fairly global presence and the spread of risk,” the company
said. “A milestone was reached this year when managed revenues
from our Internet units” exceeded that of pay television.  Naspers, which owns stakes in Russian social networking and
gaming site  Mail.ru Group Ltd. (MAIL)  and Hong Kong-based  Tencent
Holdings Ltd. (700) , is expanding its Internet business across the
world and increasing its pay-TV subscriber base in Africa. The
company said it plans to invest in new ventures as consumers
shift from computers to smartphones, a strategy that will
“reduce both earnings and cash flows in the short term.”  The company’s  shares  rose 0.6 percent to 680.98 rand by
9:42 a.m. in Johannesburg, increasing gains for the year to 25
percent. Naspers also gained from a weaker rand as a majority of
its earnings were generated outside South Africa, the company
said on June 11. The rand has declined 15 percent against the
dollar this year, the worst performer of 16 major currencies
tracked by Bloomberg.  Subscribers to the group’s pay-television service in  Africa 
increased by 1.1 million to 6.7 million homes, the company said.
Sales rose 27 percent to 50.2 billion rand as managed Internet
revenue advanced 80 percent to 34.6 billion rand.  To contact the reporter on this story:
