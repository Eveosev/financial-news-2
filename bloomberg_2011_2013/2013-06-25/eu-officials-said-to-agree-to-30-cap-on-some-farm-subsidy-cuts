European Union lawmakers and
agriculture ministers agreed to a maximum cut of 30 percent in
some subsidies to farmers as they seek to make payments more
equal within members of the 27-nation bloc, according to an
official with direct knowledge of the talks.  EU ministers, parliament and the European Commission
reached a provisional agreement overnight on how much farmers
must get or give up as part of a new farm policy for 2014-20,
said the official, who asked not to be identified because there
is no final agreement.  Officials agreed that the gap in so-called area payments to
farmers getting less than 90 percent of the regional average
must be reduced by a third by 2020. Subsidies to producers who
get the most per acre should not be cut by more than 30 percent.  Direct payments to farmers were 40.2 billion euros ($53
billion) in 2011, out of a total agriculture and rural
development budget of 58.2 billion euros.  Ministers are also discussing quotas on sugar production,
which EU Agriculture Commissioner Dacian Ciolos said yesterday
should end in 2015. The talks are focusing on 2017 and 2018 as
more likely dates, the official said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
