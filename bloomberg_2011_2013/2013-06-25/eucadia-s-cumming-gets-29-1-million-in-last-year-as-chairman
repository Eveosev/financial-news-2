Former  Leucadia National Corp. (LUK) 
Chairman Ian Cumming received $19.3 million in compensation for
2012 that exceeded pay packages for the heads of  JPMorgan Chase
& Co. (JPM)  and  Bank of America Corp. (BAC) , the two largest U.S. lenders.  Cumming, who led the board until March 1, was awarded an
$18.5 million bonus, plus salary and other pay, as the
investment company acquired Jefferies Group Inc. and brought in
new leadership, New York-based Leucadia said today in a
regulatory filing. He received $29.1 million during the calendar
year, including a $9 million bonus for performance in 2009 and
2010, the filing shows.  The pay package trumps that of JPMorgan Chief Executive
Officer  Jamie Dimon , 57, whose 2012 compensation was cut in half
to $11.5 million after the biggest U.S. bank lost more than $6.2
billion on a wrong-way derivatives bet. Bank of America CEO
 Brian T. Moynihan , 53, was granted $12 million for 2012.  To calculate bonus awards, Leucadia’s “compensation
committee considered Mr. Cumming’s and Mr. Steinberg’s
performance during 2012, the performance of the company’s
largest investments” and the terms of Cumming’s retirement
arrangement, Leucadia said in the filing.  Goldman Sachs Group Inc.’s Lloyd C. Blankfein, 58, was
awarded $26 million for 2012, making him the best-paid CEO among
North America’s 20 largest financial firms by customer deposits.  Leucadia agreed to buy Jefferies in a $3.2 billion deal
that put  Richard Handler , 52, CEO of the New York-based
investment bank, in charge of the combined company. Leucadia
shares surged 9.1 percent after the Nov. 12 announcement through
Dec. 31. Cumming ran Leucadia with Joseph Steinberg, 69, since
the 1970s, investing in mortgages, mining and  vineyards .  Steinberg, the former Leucadia president who’s now
chairman, was awarded $15.5 million for 2012, including a $14.7
million bonus, the filing shows. Compensation he received during
2012 totaled $25.4 million, including a $9 million bonus for
2009 and 2010 performance.  To contact the reporter on this story:
