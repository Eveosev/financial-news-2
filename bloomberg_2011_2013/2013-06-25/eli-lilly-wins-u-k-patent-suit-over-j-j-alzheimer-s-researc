Eli Lilly & Co. (LLY)  won a U.K. patent
lawsuit against a  Johnson & Johnson (JNJ)  unit over a potential
treatment for Alzheimer’s disease.  A patent held by J&J’s Janssen Alzheimer Immunotherapy
Research & Development unit isn’t valid, Judge Richard Arnold
said in a ruling in London today. Both companies are developing
treatments targeting the build-up of plaque in patients’ brains
that’s linked to the condition.  Companies developing the first treatments for Alzheimer’s
are competing for what might be a $20 billion market, according
to a report last year by Deutsche Bank AG analysts.  “We are disappointed by the outcome of this case, and we
are considering our options,”  Greg Panico , a U.S. spokesman for
Janssen, said in an e-mail.  Lilly is “focused on discovering and developing innovative
medicines to meet the needs of patients,” the company said in
an e-mailed statement. “This decision by the court supports
that effort.”  The case is Eli Lilly and Co. v. Janssen Alzheimer
Immunotherapy, High Court of Justice, Chancery Division,
HC11C03400  To contact the reporter on this story:
