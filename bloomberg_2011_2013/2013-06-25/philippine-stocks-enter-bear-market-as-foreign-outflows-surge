Philippine  stocks  entered a  bear
market  as the nation’s benchmark equity index slumped for a
fifth day amid the biggest monthly foreign sell-off on record.  The  Philippine Stock Exchange Index (PCOMP)  tumbled 3.1 percent to
5,789.06 in Manila, the lowest close since Dec. 19. The gauge
has lost 22 percent from a record 7,392.20 set on May 15, wiping
about $62 billion in value from the nation’s stocks as of
yesterday’s close. Valuations dropped to a seven-month low and
 volatility  climbed to the highest in more than four years.
Overseas funds sold a net $344 million of Philippine stocks this
month through yesterday, heading for the biggest monthly outflow
since Bloomberg began compiling the data in 1999.  Philippine stocks have slumped from a record, wiping  as
overseas investors sold the nation’s equities after U.S. Federal
Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said on May 22 the central bank
could consider paring stimulus if the country’s employment
market showed sustainable improvement. Bernanke said on June 19
the Fed may start reducing bond purchases this year and end the
program in 2014 should risks to the  U.S. economy  abate.  “The slump was caused by expectations the U.S. will taper
monetary stimulus and not by a deterioration in the Philippine
economic and corporate outlook,” Jerome Gonzalez, who helps
manage $230 million at Philequity Management Inc., said by phone
today. “This has opened a good window to come in and start
buying in tranches. Our fundamentals remain intact.”  Volatility Spike  The benchmark index is trading at 16.1 times  projected  12-month earnings, the cheapest since Nov. 23, from a record 20.8
times on May 15. That compares with MSCI  Emerging Markets 
Index’s 9.2 times. The Philippine gauge’s 30-day  volatility 
climbed to 38.5, the highest since January 2009.  Ayala Corp. (AC) , owner of the nation’s largest builder and
biggest bank by market value, tumbled 9.2 percent, the steepest
loss since Oct. 27, 2008. It was the biggest contributor to the
index’s decline today.  Belle Corp. (BEL) , which is building a Manila casino with Melco
Crown Entertainment Ltd., plunged 12 percent, the sharpest loss
since Feb. 28, 2007.  Aboitiz Equity Ventures Inc. (AEV) , which has
investments in power and banks, sank 5.9 percent to the lowest
close since Dec. 28, 2011.  The peso rose 0.9 percent to the dollar, paring this
month’s loss to 2.8 percent, the worst performance in  Asia  after
the Indian rupee and Malaysian ringgit. The yield on 8 percent
government bonds due July 2031 fell 50 basis points to 5.25
percent, according to Tradition Financial Services prices as of
4:06 p.m. The rate rose 5 basis points earlier.  “It’s not a question of valuations anymore,” Rico Gomez,
who helps manage $2.8 billion at Rizal Commercial Banking Corp.,
said. “It’s a matter of the level of risk that investors are
willing to take.”  Six of the 30-stocks in the nation’s equities benchmark
index are trading at a  52-week low , the most since September
2011, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The 14-day
relative strength index for 13 of the index’s stocks is below
30, a signal to some investors that shares are poised to rise.  To contact the reporter on this story:
