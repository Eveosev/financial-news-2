Authorities in Brazil’s third-largest metropolitan area,  Belo Horizonte , expect 100,000 people
to protest as the country’s national soccer team meets Uruguay
tomorrow in the semifinals of the Confederations Cup.  The city will deploy 5,000 security personnel, including
almost 2,000 to supervise the game, said Major Gilmar Luciano,
head of the press office for the military police in Minas Gerais
state, of which Belo Horizonte is the capital. The officers will
be supported by 10 aircraft, with seven helicopters among them,
he said.  “We have a special plan to guarantee law and order, and we
will arrest anyone who engages in criminal activity,” Luciano
said.  Brazil’s city and state governments and the administration
of President  Dilma Rousseff  have been struggling to respond to a
three-week wave of demonstrations sparked by a bus fare increase
in Sao Paulo. The protesters have expanded their demands to
include calls for less corruption and better public services.
Some of the demonstrations, including one in Belo Horizonte on
June 22, have taken place outside stadiums where Confederations
Cup games were being played and have featured vandalism and
clashes with the police.  The Confederations Cup is a warm-up for the FIFA  World Cup ,
which will be held next year in Brazil.  To contact the reporter on this story:
