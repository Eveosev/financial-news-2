The Tampa Bay Rays ended the Toronto
 Blue Jays ’ 11-game Major League Baseball winning streak with a
4-1 victory fueled by three consecutive home runs during the
second inning.  James Loney, rookie Wil Myers and Sam Fuld hit back-to-back-to-back blasts off Blue Jays pitcher Esmil Rogers last
night at Tropicana Field in St. Petersburg, Florida.  Rays pitcher Jeremy Hellickson allowed one hit over seven
scoreless innings, preventing Toronto from setting a new
franchise record for consecutive wins. The Blue Jays had also
won 11 straight games during the 1987 and 1998 seasons.  “Losses are never easy, but we’ve been on a nice little
roll,” Blue Jays manager John Gibbons told reporters. “You
knew it was going to happen sooner or later. Some nights you run
into really good pitching.”  Toronto’s streak was the longest since the  Detroit Tigers 
won 12 in a row during the 2011 season.  To contact the reporter on this story:
