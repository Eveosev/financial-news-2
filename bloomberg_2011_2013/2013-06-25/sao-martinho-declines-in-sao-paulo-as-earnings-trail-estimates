Sao Martinho SA (SMTO3) , the owner of the
world’s largest sugar-cane processing plant, declined after
reporting earnings that trailed analysts’ estimates for a second
straight quarter.  The shares dropped 2.2 percent to 25.43 reais at 2:03 p.m.
in Sao Paulo, snapping two days of gains. The benchmark  Ibovespa (IBOV) 
gauge advanced 1.3 percent.  The company posted adjusted net income of 12.7 million
reais ($5.7 million) for the fiscal fourth-quarter ended March
31, according to data compiled by Bloomberg after the company
reported the results late yesterday. The average  estimate  of six
analysts was 26.5 million reais.  While the results will probably “have a marginally
negative impact on shares,” Banco Santander SA analysts
including Christian Audi reiterated in a research note a buy
recommendation, citing the company’s “cheap valuation, better-than-expected guidance for the fiscal 2014 harvest, and a
substantial portion of sugar exports hedged at healthy levels.”  The Pradopolis, Brazil-based company forecasts sugar output
of 996,000 tons for the 2013-2014 season, compared with 970,400
in the prior period. Ethanol output is projected to rise 43
percent.  Sao Martinho has fallen 9.2 percent this year, while the
Ibovespa has plunged 24 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
