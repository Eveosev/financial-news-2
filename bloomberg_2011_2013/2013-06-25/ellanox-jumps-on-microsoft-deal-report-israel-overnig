Mellanox Technologies Ltd. (MLNX)  rallied
for a second day in Tel Aviv after the U.S.-traded shares
advanced on a report that the company will sell products to
 Microsoft Corp. (MSFT)  and  Google Inc. (GOOG)   The maker of equipment that speeds data transfers surged 12
percent, the most since Jan. 27, to 184 shekels, or the
equivalent of $50.65, at the close in Tel Aviv. That brought the
stock’s two-day jump to 17 percent. The company’s shares in the
U.S. climbed 2.2 percent to $50.03 at 10:57 a.m. in  New York .
They soared 11 percent yesterday.  Mellanox is close to signing a deal to provide equipment
for Internet projects by software maker Microsoft and Google,
which will generate as much as $200 million in revenue,
newspaper Globes reported yesterday, without saying where it
obtained the information. Governor Terry Branstad announced June
21 that Microsoft will expand a  data center  in Iowa and there’s
a “high probability” that Mellanox is part of the project,
according to Jonathan Kreizman, an analyst at Clal Finance
Batucha Brokerage Ltd.  “Both of these deals are not being factored into the
Street’s estimates,” Kreizman, who has the equivalent of a buy
 rating  for Mellanox, said in a telephone interview from  Tel Aviv 
yesterday. “This could strongly impact the fourth quarter of
2013 and potentially also the first half of 2014.”  Sales at the Yokneam Elit, Israel-based company will
decline 16 percent to $418.3 million this year, according to the
average estimate of  15 analysts  surveyed by Bloomberg. That
would be the first drop in revenue since at least 2005. Second-quarter sales will be as much as $97.5 million, trailing
analysts’ projections, the company said on April 24.  Brian Sparks, a spokesman for Mellanox in Sunnyvale,
California, Krista Foxwell, a spokeswoman for Microsoft, and
Kate Hurowitz, a spokeswoman for Google, declined to comment.  Israel’s benchmark TA-25 Index declined 0.2 percent today,
bringing the drop for the month to 3.1 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
