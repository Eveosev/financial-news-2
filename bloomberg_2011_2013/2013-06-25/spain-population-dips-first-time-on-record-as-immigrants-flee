Spain’s population declined for the
first time since records began in 1971 as immigrants fled the
recession-plagued country last year.  The number of foreign immigrants that left Spain in 2012
was 18 percent higher than a year earlier, as 417,023 people
exited the country, according to a  report  from the  National
Institute of Statistics , or INE, published today. Romanians,
Moroccans and Ecuadorians lead the emigration of foreign
nationals.  Spain is in the  worst recession  in its democratic history
with record unemployment weighing on domestic demand. The
 jobless rate  is at 27 percent, more than twice the euro-region
average.  More Spaniards, in particular adults between 25 and 44,
also left the country in 2012, with 59,724 departing, 7.7
percent more than in 2011. While the majority picked  Ecuador ,
the U.K. and  France  as their destination, there was
“significant growth” in Spanish citizens moving to Latin
American countries, INE said.  The number of Spaniards moving to Colombia almost tripled,
while Peru also was popular, INE said. In contrast, China and
 Bulgaria  were less sought after than in 2011, according to the
report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
