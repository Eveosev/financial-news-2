Gold slid for a second straight day
as signs of improving U.S. economic growth boosted speculation
that the Federal Reserve will end its stimulus program.  Orders for durable goods rose a better-than-forecast 3.6
percent in May, while confidence among U.S. consumers climbed in
June to the highest in more than five years, separate reports
showed today. Gold slumped 6.9 percent last week after Fed
Chairman Ben S. Bernanke said the central bank may slow its
asset-purchase program if the U.S. economy continues to improve.  Bullion has tumbled 24 percent this year as some investors
lose faith in it as a store of value and as speculation grew
that the Fed will taper debt-buying that helped the metal extend
a rally to a 12-year bull run through 2012. Morgan Stanley and
Credit Suisse Group Inc. cut their price forecasts today,
joining Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and UBS AG in paring estimates.  “Gold does not like all this good economic news,”  Frank Lesh , a trader at FuturePath Trading in  Chicago , said in a
telephone interview. “Gold is very vulnerable now, and we are
seeing a strong dollar push gold further down.”  Gold futures for August delivery slipped 0.2 percent to
settle at $1,275.10 an ounce at 1:43 p.m. on the Comex in New
York. The metal reached $1,268.70 on June 21, the lowest since
September 2010.  Dollar Gains  The dollar gained as much as 0.4 percent against a basket
of currencies, rising for the fifth straight session.  Morgan Stanley cut its 2013 gold forecast to $1,409 from
$1,487, and lowered its 2014 target to $1,313 from $1,563,
according to a report today. Russia and Kazakhstan were among
nations that expanded bullion reserves in May, while  Mexico  and
the Czech Republic reduced holdings, International Monetary Fund
data show.  Silver futures for September delivery rose 0.1 percent to
$19.552 an ounce in New York. Prices fell to $19.31 on June 21,
the lowest since August 2010.  On the New York Mercantile Exchange, platinum futures for
October delivery advanced 1.6 percent to $1,354.10 an ounce, the
biggest gain since June 3.  Trading volume was more than double the average in the past
100 days for this time of day, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  Palladium futures for September delivery added 1.7 percent
to $668.80 an ounce.  To contact the reporter on this story:
