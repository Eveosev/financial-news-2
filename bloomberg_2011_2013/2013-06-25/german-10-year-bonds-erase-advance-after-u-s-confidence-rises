German 10-year government bonds
erased an advance after a report showed U.S. consumer confidence
increased in June.  The yield on the securities was at 1.82 percent as of 3:06
p.m. London time, after falling as much as five basis points, or
0.05 percentage point, to 1.76 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
