Temperatures across the central U.S.
are expected to fall below normal through the end of the month,
boosting energy demand, said  Matt Rogers , president of Commodity
Weather Group LLC.  Readings are forecast to be at least 3 degrees Fahrenheit
(1.7 Celsius) lower than the norm for the region, including
Chicago and Dallas, from Oct. 19 to Oct. 28, he said today.  “We are still generally seeing increases in national
demand again this morning,” said Rogers, who’s based in
Bethesda,  Maryland .  Below-normal temperatures tend to raise energy consumption
as people turn up thermostats to heat homes and businesses.  Power generation accounts for 32 percent of U.S. gas
demand, according to the Energy Information Administration, the
Energy Department’s statistical arm. About 49 percent of all
homes use the fuel for heating.  The area affected by cooler air is expected to widen from
Oct. 24 to 28, reaching from southern Manitoba to the  Gulf of
Mexico  and eastward to the mid-Atlantic, including Washington
and Baltimore, Rogers said.  The normal average temperature in New York for Oct. 20 is
about 57 degrees, according to  MDA Weather Services  in
Gaithersburg, Maryland. In Boston, it’s 53; in  St. Louis , 58;
Chicago, 52; and in Burbank, California, it’s 66.  To contact the reporter on this story:
