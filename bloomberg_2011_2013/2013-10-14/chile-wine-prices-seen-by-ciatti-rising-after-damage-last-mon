Bulk wine prices in Chile are
climbing for most varieties after frost damaged many fruit crops
including grapes, according to wine broker Ciatti Co.  Chardonnay is the most affected variety after temperatures
stayed below 0 degrees Celsius (32 degrees Fahrenheit) for eight
days from Sept. 20 to Sept. 30,  San Rafael , California-based
Ciatti, a broker of bulk wines, said in an e-mailed report.  “Many growers are calling the frost a ‘catastrophe’,”
Ciatti said. “Chardonnay is the most affected varietal,
followed by Pinot Noir, Tintorera and Sauvignon Blanc. Less
afffected were Merlot and Cabernaut Sauvignon.”  Chile exported 596.4 million liters (158 million gallons)
of bulk, bottled, sparkling and packed wines in January through
August, with average prices falling from $2.50 a liter in the
same period last year to $2.03 a liter in the first eight months
this year, according to the report.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
