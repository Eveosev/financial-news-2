A court in eastern  China  sentenced
six officials to between four to 14 years in prison for willful
injury in the case of a businessman who died while in Communist
Party custody, two of the lawyers involved in the case said.  The court in the city of Quzhou handed down the verdict on
the six defendants, including five from the Communist Party’s
Central Commission for Discipline Inspection, on Sept. 30,
lawyers Pu Zhiqiang and Wu Pengbin said in separate phone calls.
They represented the family of the man who died, Yu Qiyi.  The case shone a spotlight on the party’s internal
discipline body, which has the power to detain party members
during investigations. Prosecutors charged the defendants after
the April 9 death of Yu, chief engineer at Wenzhou Industry
Investment Group Co at the time.  In a report in April, the state-run Global Times newspaper
said Yu was detained on March 1 on suspicion that he broke the
law during the approval process for a land project. Yu died in
custody and his body was covered in bruises, the Global Times
reported in April, citing Yu’s family.  “Those who work for the Central Commission for Discipline
Inspection will be more careful in the future doing their
work,” Pu said.  The Quzhou court didn’t answer a phone call seeking comment
yesterday.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
