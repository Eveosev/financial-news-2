The U.S. may default on its debts
for the first time in the nation’s history unless the White
House and  House Republicans  agree on legislation to raise the
government’s $16.7 trillion debt ceiling by Oct. 17.  China’s gross domestic product increased more in the third
quarter than the 7.5 percent growth recorded in the prior three
months, data in the coming week may show.  Google Inc. (GOOG) ,  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) ,  General Electric
Co. (GE) ,  International Business Machines Corp. (IBM) , Reliance Industries
Ltd. and British Sky Broadcasting Group Plc will be among
companies releasing results.  European Union finance ministers will meet to discuss plans
