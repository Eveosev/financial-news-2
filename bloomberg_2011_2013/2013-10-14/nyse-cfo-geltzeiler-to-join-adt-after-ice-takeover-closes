NYSE Euronext (NYX)  Chief Financial
Officer Michael Geltzeiler will join ADT Corp., the largest U.S.
home-security company, when  IntercontinentalExchange Inc. (ICE) 
completes its takeover of the bourse operator.  The executive, who has worked at New York-based NYSE
Euronext for five years, will make the switch shortly after the
acquisition closes, an event thatâ€™s currently scheduled for Nov.
4, ADT said in a statement today. Boca Raton, Florida-based ADT
was spun off from Tyco International Ltd. last year.  Geltzeiler joins other senior NYSE executives, including
Mark Ibbotson, who are leaving the operator of the  New York 
Stock Exchange as the 12-year-old energy and commodity futures
bourse, known as ICE, buys the 220-year-old company. Ibbotson,
former co-chief executive officer of the NYSE Liffe derivatives
exchange, joined GHF Financials on Oct. 7.  To contact the reporter on this story:
