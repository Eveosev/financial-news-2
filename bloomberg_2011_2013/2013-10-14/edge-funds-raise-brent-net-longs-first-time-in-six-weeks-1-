Hedge funds  and other money managers
raised  bullish bets  on  Brent crude  for the first time in six
weeks, according to data from ICE Futures  Europe .  Speculative bets that prices will rise, in futures and
options combined, outnumbered short positions by 164,994 lots in
the week ended Oct. 8, the London-based exchange said today in
its weekly Commitments of Traders report. That’s up 2.3 percent
from last week, when net-longs were at their lowest level since
July 2.  Bearish positions by producers, merchants, processors and
users of Brent outnumbered bullish positions by 331,327, a 4.1
percent increase from Oct. 1.  ICE publishes, usually each Monday, aggregate numbers for
long and short positions for speculators and institutional
investors, as well as commercial companies that buy or sell
futures to protect against price moves. Analysts and investors
follow changes in speculators’ positions because such
transactions can reflect an expectation of a change in prices.
The U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission said Oct. 1 that
it will not publish data including its weekly Commitment of
Traders report during the government shutdown.  Brent futures rose 2.1 percent to $110.16 a barrel in the
week to Oct. 8 and traded at $110.38 as of 12:51 p.m. local time
on the ICE exchange.  Swaps dealers raised net-long positions in Brent by 5.2
percent to 181,856.  Money managers’ net-long bets on European gasoil grew for
the first time in five weeks, rising 19 percent to 72,110 lots.  To contact the reporter on this story:
