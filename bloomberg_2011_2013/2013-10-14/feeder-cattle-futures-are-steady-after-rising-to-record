Feeder-cattle futures were little
changed after rising to a record on concern that U.S. ranchers
are holding animals longer as pastures rebound from a drought
and cheaper grain spurs demand from feedlots. Hogs fell.  The U.S. High Plains Regional Climate Center reported that
 drought conditions  have eased after damaging pastures last year
and forcing ranchers to sell cattle to feedlots sooner than
normal. Today, the price of corn, the main grain ingredient,
touched a three-year low, improving the profitability for
feedlots to buy young animals to fatten for slaughter.  “Weather conditions have been much better than last
year,”  Dan Vaught , an economist at Doane Advisory Services in
 St. Louis , said in a telephone interview. “Producers have
incentive to hold younger cattle longer.”  Feeder-cattle futures for November settlement fell less
than 0.1 percent to $1.692 a pound at 12:03 p.m. on the Chicago
Mercantile Exchange. Earlier, the price reached $1.6995, the
all-time high for the most-active contract. The commodity
climbed to an all-time high for the third straight session.  Feedlot operators typically buy 1-year-old cattle that
weight 500 pounds (227 kilograms) to 800 pounds, called feeders,
which are fattened on corn until they weigh about 1,300 pounds
and are sold to meatpackers.  Cattle futures for December delivery increased 0.3 percent
to $1.32925 a pound. Earlier, the price reached $1.3295, the
highest since Feb. 4.  Hog futures for December settlement fell 0.4 percent to
86.175 cents a pound.  To contact the reporter on this story:
