Cocoa declined for the first time in
three sessions on signs of weaker demand after bean processing
declined last quarter in  Malaysia , the largest grinder in  Asia .
Sugar gained, while coffee, orange juice and cotton were little
changed.  Cocoa grind fell 3.1 percent to 71,150 metric tons from a
year earlier, the Malaysian Cocoa Board said today. Processing
fell for a third straight quarter. The Standard and Poor’s GSCI
Spot Index of 24 commodities declined for a second session as
the U.S. government’s partial shutdown entered a third week and
lawmakers have yet to reach an agreement on ending a fiscal
impasse three days before the nation’s borrowing authority
lapses.  “Lower Malaysian grinding is contributing to the
negative” sentiment, John Caruso, a senior commodities broker
at RJO Futures in  Chicago  wrote in an e-mail today. Prices are
also declining as investors sell some riskier assets because of
the deadlock in  Washington , he said.  Cocoa for December delivery slid 1 percent to $2,718 a ton
at 10:45 a.m. on ICE Futures U.S. in New York, after rallying
5.2 percent last week.  Cocoa’s 14-day relative strength index was at 70.2 on Oct.
11. A level above 70 is seen by some traders and analysts as a
sign a security is overbought and poised for a decline.  Raw-sugar futures for March delivery added 0.5 percent to
19.02 cents a pound on ICE.  Arabica-coffee futures for December delivery rose less than
0.1 percent to $1.1675 a pound, while orange-juice futures for
November delivery increased less than 0.1 percent to $1.265 a
pound in  New York . Cotton futures for December delivery gained
0.1 percent to 83.46 cents a pound.  To contact the reporter on this story:
