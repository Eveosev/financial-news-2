U.K. commercial real estate values
rose for the fifth straight month in September, posting the
biggest gain since April 2010, Investment Property Databank Ltd.
said.  The average value of stores, offices and industrial
properties climbed 0.6 percent from a month earlier, London-based IPD said in a statement today. Total return, which
combines changes in real estate values and rental income, was
1.2 percent.  The International Monetary Fund raised its forecasts for
the U.K. economy by more than for any other Group of Seven
nation on Oct. 8 as the economic recovery gathers pace. Growth
is spreading beyond  London  because of improving consumer and
business sentiment, according to a survey published today by
Lloyds Banking Group Plc. The improvement bolsters demand for
stores, warehouses and office buildings.  “The property sector is back into full swing after the
summer,” Phil Tily, a managing director at IPD, said in the
statement. “An ongoing improvement in investor sentiment,
prompting further yield compression has helped the market
deliver a predominantly capital based return this month.”  Office buildings had a 1.0 percent gain in September and
warehouse values climbed 0.7 percent, according to IPD. The
average value of retail properties rose by 0.3 percent. Income-producing commercial properties lost value for 17 consecutive
months through March and were unchanged in April.  To contact the reporter on this story:
