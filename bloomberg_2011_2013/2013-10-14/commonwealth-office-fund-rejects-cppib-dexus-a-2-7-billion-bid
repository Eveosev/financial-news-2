Commonwealth Property Office Fund (CPA) 
rejected a A$2.7 billion ($2.6 billion) takeover bid from the
Canada Pension Plan Investment Board and  Dexus Property Group (DXS) 
because it is too low.  The proposal doesn’t provide compelling value, the manager
of the fund said in a statement to the Australian stock
exchange. The board of the manager, Commonwealth Managed
Investments Ltd., therefore won’t grant CPPIB and Dexus access
to due diligence material, it said.  The bidders made a cash-and-stock offer for the fund valued
at A$1.15 a share on Oct. 11 and Dexus separately offered
Commonwealth Bank an undisclosed sum to take over management
rights of the office trust as it sought to cement its position
as  Australia ’s largest office landlord. The bid, which came
after an announcement by the bank in July that it was seeking to
exit its property investments, was equal to the value of
Commonwealth Property Office’s assets.  “Should the consortium decide to submit a revised proposal
with improved terms, it will be considered on its merits,”
Richard Haddock, chairman of CMIL, said in the statement today.  Commonwealth Property Office  shares  were unchanged at
A$1.19 at 4:03 p.m. in Sydney, while  Commonwealth Bank (CBA)  shares
rose 0.1 percent to A$72.42. Dexus shares climbed 0.5 percent to
A$1.065 compared with a 0.5 percent fall in the S&P/ASX 200
Index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
