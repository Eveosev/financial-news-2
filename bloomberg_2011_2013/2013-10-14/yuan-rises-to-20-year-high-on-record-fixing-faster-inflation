China ’s  yuan  strengthened to a 20-year high after the central bank set the currency’s reference
rate at a record high and as consumer prices advanced the most
in seven months.  The People’s Bank of China raised its daily  fixing  by 0.08
percent to 6.1406 per dollar, the strongest since a peg to the
greenback was lifted in July 2005.  Inflation (CNCPIYOY)  quickened to 3.1
percent last month, the fastest pace since February, data showed
today. The nation’s foreign-exchange reserves, the world’s
largest, rose to a record $3.66 trillion as of Sept. 30 from
$3.5 trillion at the end of June, according to central bank data
released today.  “The global recovery remains patchy and China is looking
to shift growth toward domestic consumption,” said  Jonathan Cavenagh , a currency strategist in Singapore at Westpac Banking
Corp. “If inflation continues to trend up, we are going to be
in a stronger environment for the Chinese currency.”  The yuan gained 0.21 percent, the most since May 8, to
close at 6.1079 per dollar in  Shanghai , China Foreign Exchange
Trade System prices show. It touched 6.1073 earlier, the
strongest since the government unified the official and market
exchange rates at the end of 1993. The yuan has risen 35 percent
against the greenback since the end of its peg, when it traded
around 8.2765, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  There could be changes to the yuan’s trading band after
China’s central committee meets in November, according to Sacha
Tihanyi, a Hong Kong-based currency strategist at Scotiabank.
The likely outcome is for the range to be widened to 1.5 percent
or even 2 percent from the current 1 percent, he wrote in a note
today.  New Loans  New local-currency loans were 787 billion yuan in
September, compared with 623.2 billion yuan a year earlier,
official data showed today.  Exports (CNFREXPY)  dropped 0.3 percent from a
year earlier, trailing all 46 estimates in a Bloomberg survey,
while imports rose a more-than-forecast 7.4 percent, according
to trade data released over the weekend.  In Hong Kong’s offshore market, the yuan appreciated 0.09
percent to a record 6.1010 per dollar, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. Twelve-month non-deliverable forwards
rose 0.19 percent to 6.1500, the strongest since Bloomberg began
compiling the data in 1998. The contracts were at a 0.7 percent
 discount  to the onshore rate. Hong Kong’s stock market is shut
today for a public holiday.  One-month implied volatility in the onshore yuan, a measure
of expected moves in the  exchange rate  used to price options,
fell one basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 1.24 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
