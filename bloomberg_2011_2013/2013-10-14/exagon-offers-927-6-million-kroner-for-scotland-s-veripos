Hexagon AB (HEXAB) , the world’s largest
maker of measuring instruments, offered 927.6 million kroner
($154.6 million) to buy  Veripos Inc. (VPOS) , a Scottish maker of
positioning equipment for ships.  The 28-krone-a-share bid, 22 percent more than Veripos’s
23-krone closing price on Oct. 11, is 44 percent higher than the
stock’s three-month volume-weighted average, Stockholm-based
Hexagon said in a statement today. Veripos has more than 33.1
million outstanding shares, according to its  website . The stock
jumped as much as 25 percent to a record.  The combination “is a good strategic fit,” in which the
Swedish company “will provide state-of-the-art positioning
technology to Veripos as well as future growth via Hexagon’s
onshore markets,” Hexagon Chief Executive Officer Ola Rollen
said in the statement. “Veripos has, in turn, built up a strong
position in the offshore market and has world-class
infrastructure that Hexagon can leverage on immediately.”  Hexagon, whose workforce exceeds 14,000 employees with
operations in more than 40 countries, makes measuring
instruments used in industries including surveying, power and
energy, aerospace and defense, automotive, construction and
manufacturing. Veripos, based in Aberdeen, produces positioning
equipment for offshore surveying, dredging, offshore
construction, seismic exploration and dynamic positioning.  Veripos  surged  5.8 kroner to 28.8 kroner, the highest price
since the company’s July 26, 2012, initial public offering, as
of 9:03 a.m. in Oslo, where the stock is traded.  The offer is subject to approval from at least 90 percent
of Veripos’s shareholders, Hexagon said. A five-week acceptance
period will start after the Oslo stock exchange approves the
offer document, the company said. SEB AB has been Hexagon’s
financial adviser in the transaction, the company said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
