Azerbaijan said it may stop inviting
the Organization for Security and Cooperation in  Europe  to
monitor elections after the group said this month’s presidential
vote wasn’t free or fair.  The 57-member OSCE’s assessment was “an insult to the will
of Azeri voters,” Azar Sariyev, a spokesman for the Central
Electoral Commission, said today by phone from the capital,
Baku. “The CEC is forced to ask the government to reconsider
its policy of cooperating” with the OSCE in the future.  The election, which gave incumbent  Ilham Aliyev  another
five-year term, “fell short of international standards” and
was undermined by “serious shortcomings,” the OSCE’s Office
for Democratic Institutions and  Human Rights  said in a statement
the day after the Caspian Sea nation’s Oct. 9 ballot.  Aliyev, 51, won a third term in office with 84.6 percent of
the votes, according to the CEC. Camil Hasanli, the candidate
backed by opposition parties, received 5.5 percent, with eight
other candidates dividing up the remaining votes.  To contact the reporter on this story:
