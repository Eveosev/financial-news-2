Jimmy Walker rallied to win the
season-opening Frys.com Open by two strokes over  Vijay Singh ,
his first victory in 188 career starts on golf’s U.S. PGA Tour.  Walker, 34, shot a 5-under-par 66 during yesterday’s final
round at CordeValle Golf Club in San Martin, California, to
finish with a four-round total of 17 under 267. He had started
the day three shots behind 54-hole leader Brooks Koepka.  Walker, whose best previous PGA Tour result was a runner-up
finish at the 2013 Greenbrier Classic, received $900,000 for his
breakthrough title.  The 50-year-old Singh, who was seeking to become the oldest
winner of a PGA Tour event since Fred Funk at the 2007 Mayakoba
Golf Classic, finished at 15 under par, one shot better than
Koepka, Kevin Na, Hideki Matsuyama and  Scott Brown .  The Frys.com Open was the first event in the PGA Tour’s new
 wraparound schedule  that bridges two years and includes 45
tournaments over 43 weeks. The 2013-14 PGA Tour season continues
Oct. 17 to 20 with the Shriners Hospitals for Children Open in
Las Vegas and then moves to  Kuala Lumpur  the following week for
the CIMB Classic and then to Shanghai for the World Golf
Championships-HSBC Championship.  All six events for the new season held this year will award
FedEx Cup points for the first time. The McGladrey Classic is
held on Nov. 7-10 in  Sea Island , Georgia, followed by the OHL
Classic at Mayakoba in Mexico the following week. The PGA Tour
schedule then resumes in January with its traditional swing
through  Hawaii  before moving to the U.S. West Coast for six
events in California and Arizona.  To contact the reporter on this story:
