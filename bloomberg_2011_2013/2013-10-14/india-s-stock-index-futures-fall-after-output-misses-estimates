Indian (SENSEX)  stocks climbed, sending the
benchmark index to a one-month high, as a rally in software
makers offset a report showing faster-than-estimated inflation.  Tata Consultancy Services Ltd. (TCS) , the country’s top software
exporter, rose to a record, helping a measure of 10 technology
stocks advance for the fourth day.  Hero MotoCorp Ltd. (HMCL)  closed at
a one-month high. Aluminum maker  Hindalco Industries Ltd. (HNDL)  had
its biggest three-day loss since July 30.  The S&P BSE Sensex added 0.4 percent to 20,607.54 at the
close and a gauge of 223  mid-cap  companies rose to its highest
level since July 23. The Sensex rallied 3.1 percent last week,
led by software exporters, after Infosys Ltd. raised its annual
sales forecast. Wholesale prices rose 6.46 percent in September
from a year earlier, compared with a 6.1 percent climb in the
previous month, data showed. That exceeded the 6 percent median
estimate of 33 economists in a Bloomberg survey.  “Inflation has probably peaked and price pressures will
ease as good monsoon brings down food prices,” Deven Choksey,
managing director at K.R. Choksey Shares & Securities Pvt. in
Mumbai, said by phone today. “We don’t expect an increase in
 interest rates  from the  Reserve Bank  in the near term.”  Reserve Bank of India Governor Raghuram Rajan raised the
main repurchase rate for the first time since 2011 last month,
while data issued Oct. 11 showed factory output growth slowed
more than forecast. Rajan also rolled back liquidity-tightening
measures aimed at boosting the rupee after the currency jumped
13 percent from a record low on Aug. 28. Data due later today
may show consumer prices rose 9.5 percent last month, after a
9.52 percent climb in August, a separate Bloomberg survey shows.  The rupee weakened 0.8 percent to 61.5450 per dollar at the
close, the most in three weeks.  Europe Demand  Tata Consultancy advanced 4.3 percent, taking this year’s
gain to 76 percent, the best performance on the Sensex. Infosys
climbed to its highest close since January 2011. The nation’s
second-largest software exporter raised its sales forecast Oct.
10 amid rising demand from clients in Europe and the U.S. The
two markets account for 85 percent of Infosys’ revenue.  Wipro
Ltd. (WPRO) , the third largest, jumped 2.6 percent to a 13-year high.  “Infosys earnings have shown that the software sector will
benefit from stronger growth in the developed economies,” D.K. Aggarwal, chairman of SMC Investments & Advisors Ltd., said by
phone from New Delhi. “Industrial output and other indicators
will improve as steps taken by the authorities to support the
rupee and kickstart growth would take hold.”  Hero MotoCorp added 0.9 percent to last week’s 2.2 percent
jump. Hindalco fell, taking the third-day loss to 7.5 percent.
The S&P BSE India Metal Index slid 0.6 percent.  Reliance Earnings  Reliance Industries Ltd. (RIL) , owner of the world’s largest
refining complex, may today say its  second-quarter profit  rose
to 54.2 billion rupees from 53.8 billion rupees a year earlier,
according to the median of 22 analysts estimates in a Bloomberg
survey. The stock climbed 0.8 percent.  The Sensex has risen 6.1 percent this year and is  valued  at
14.1 times estimated 12-month profits, compared with 10.7 times
for the MSCI  Emerging Markets  Index.  Global investors bought a net $123 million of local stocks
on Oct. 10, data from the regulator show. They have purchased a
net $14 billion of local equities this year, the second-highest
among 10 Asian markets tracked by Bloomberg, after  Japan .  The CNX  Nifty (NIFTY)  Index increased 0.3 percent to 6,112.70. The
India VIX, which gauges the cost of protection against losses in
the Nifty, fell 3.1 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
