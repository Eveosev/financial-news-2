Danone’s (BN)  Dumex baby milk business
made improper payments to medical workers in  China ’s northern
city of Tianjin for promoting its infant formula, according to a
statement by the local government.  An official investigation found that 116 employees in 85
medical institutions had broken rules since 2011 and accepted
payments from the French infant formula maker, according to a
post on the city’s official microblog today.  Athena Wang, Dumex’s Shanghai-based spokeswoman, couldn’t
immediately comment on the government statement. Money received
by the 116 medical staff would be confiscated, and 13 people who
commited serious violations would be “severely” punished, the
local government said.  The latest government statement comes after reports by
state broadcaster  China Central Television  last month that Dumex
made improper payments to medical staff in the country to boost
sales. The government has sought to crack down on corruption in
the country’s $350 billion health-care market, probing multiple
drug companies amid claims of doctors’ involvement in
malfeasance.  Dumex had given hundred of thousands of  yuan  annually in
various forms of “sponsorship fees” to doctors and nurses in
hospitals to sell its products amid fierce competition in the
industry, CCTV reported last month.  Danone said last month its Nutricia China unit had started
an internal probe into allegations of bribery at the business.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
