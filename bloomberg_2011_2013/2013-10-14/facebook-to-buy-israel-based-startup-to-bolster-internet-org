Facebook Inc. (FB)  agreed to buy an
Israeli startup that specializes in mobile applications as part
of its effort to reduce the number of people without Internet
access.  No terms were disclosed of the purchase of  Onavo , which has
about 40 employees and was founded in 2010. As part of the
acquisition, Facebook will open its first office in  Israel .  “Onavo will be an exciting addition to Facebook,”
Facebook said in an e-mailed statement today. “We expect
Onavo’s data compression technology to play a central role in
our mission to connect more people to the Internet, and their
analytic tools will help us provide better, more efficient
mobile products.”  Facebook Chief Executive Officer  Mark Zuckerberg  joined
with other tech companies in August to form a new group called
Internet.org, which aims to expand access to the Internet for
the 5 billion people who have yet to get online. Facebook, owner
of the world’s largest social-networking service, is looking for
new ways to attract more people to its service, which has more
than 1 billion users.  To contact the reporter on this story:
