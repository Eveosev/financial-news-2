A well at  DNO International ASA (DNO)  and
 Genel Energy Plc (GENL) ’s Tawke oilfield in northern  Iraq  flowed at a
record rate, bolstering prospects for higher output from the
region as it completes an export pipeline to Turkey.  The Tawke-23 well flowed at 32,500 barrels of oil a day
after horizontal drilling, DNO said in a statement in Oslo. The
companies have initiated sales from the well, which is the
second horizontal one to be drilled at the field.  “The exceptional results from Tawke-20 and Tawke-23 have
fundamentally changed our approach to developing this field and
also our expectations for its performance,” said Bijan Mossavar-Rahmani, DNO International’s executive chairman. "By
any measure, these are prolific wells tapping into what
increasingly feels like a sea of oil.’’  Kurdistan is building a pipeline to Turkey after years of
disputes with the central government in  Baghdad  over oil
payments. The Kurds expect to export 1 million barrels a day of
oil by 2015 and 2 million by 2019, said  Ashti Hawrami , the KRG’s
minister of natural resources, in comments published on the
government’s website on Oct. 3.  DNO rose 5.1 percent to 15.4 kroner, the highest level
since June 2006. Genel rose 0.9 percent to 983 pence as of 8:31
a.m. in London.  DNO holds a 55 percent stake in the Tawke license and Genel
owns 25 percent. The Kurdistan Regional Government holds the
remaining 20 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
