Portugal’s hotels recorded a 4.6
percent rise in revenue in August from the same month last year,
bolstered by an increase in overnight stays by British, Spanish,
French and Brazilian tourists.  Revenue rose to 310.5 million euros ($421 million) in
August, the Lisbon-based National Statistics Institute said
today in an e-mailed statement. In the first eighth months of
the year, revenue increased 4.9 percent to 1.36 billion euros.  Tourism represents about a tenth of Portugal’s gross
domestic product, according to the  Economy Ministry .  To contact the reporter on this story:
