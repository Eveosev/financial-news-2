Ikea Group said full-year sales rose
3.1 percent as the flat-pack furniture retailer gained share in
most markets and benefited from growth in  Russia  and  China .  Revenue increased to 27.9 billion euros ($37.9 billion),
the company said today in an e-mailed statement. Same-store
sales gained 1.8 percent at the retailer, which owns the
majority of the world’s Ikea outlets.  “Value for money is increasingly important to our
customers -- and our sales development shows that people all
over the world appreciate our concept of good quality, well-designed products at low prices,” Chief Executive Officer Peter Agnefjaell said in the statement.  Ikea said some of the strongest growth was in Russia and
China and that  North America  showed significant progress.
Southern Europe continued to be affected by that region’s weak
economy. The group, which will release its full-year report in
January, said it gained market share in “almost all markets.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
