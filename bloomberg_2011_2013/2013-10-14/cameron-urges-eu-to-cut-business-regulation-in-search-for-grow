U.K. Prime Minister  David Cameron 
will urge the European Union to reduce the level of regulation
it applies to businesses, listing planned measures that should
be scaled back or scrapped.  A government-commissioned report by six business leaders
including Marks & Spencer Group Plc Chief Executive Officer  Marc Bolland  and  Kingfisher Plc (KGF)  CEO Ian Cheshire listed areas where
the EU should regulate less, the premier’s office said in an e-mailed statement. The six will present their proposals to
Cameron’s cabinet when it meets in London this morning.  The team’s work is an indication of some of the areas in
which Cameron is likely to seek changes to Britain’s
relationship with the EU before his pledged referendum on
membership in 2017. The business leaders warned against
regulation on shale gas and called for a reduction in reporting
requirements.  “It’s vital that business can take full advantage of the
EU’s single market,” Cameron said in the statement. “But all
too often, EU rules are a handicap for firms. I’m determined to
change that and to get the EU working for business, not against
it.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
