Total (TOTAL)  SA’s Nigerian contractors’
Total Exploration & Production Nigeria Ltd. and Total Upstream
Nigeria Ltd. agreed to borrow $7.5 billion from eight lenders in
sub-Saharan  Africa ’s second-biggest economy.  “It’s meant to finance local contractors and suppliers,”
Charles Ebereonwu, Total’s spokesman in Nigeria, said today by
phone from Abuja, the capital. “It’s in line with Total’s
development program for local contractors.”  Banks in Africa’s top crude producer have increased lending
to finance oil, power and infrastructure projects after
returning to profit from near-collapse in 2008 and 2009. Lending
to the oil industry increased as smaller producers expand
drilling. Companies such as London-based Heritage Oil Plc and
Lagos-based Neconde Energy Ltd. bought stakes in fields owned by
 Royal Dutch Shell (RDSA)  Plc,  Eni (ENI)  SpA and Total, Nigeria’s fourth-largest oil and gas producer.  The eight lenders providing the $7.5 billion facility for
Total’s contractors are  Guaranty Trust Bank Plc (GUARANTY) , Ecobank
Nigeria, Zenith Bank, Diamond Bank, United Bank for Africa,
Standard Chartered Bank, Access Bank and Fidelity Bank,
Ebereonwu said.  Royal Dutch Shell,  Chevron Corp. (CVX) , Exxon Mobil Corp., Total
and Eni pump about 90 percent of Nigeria’s oil through ventures
with state-owned Nigerian National Petroleum Corp.  To contact the reporter on this story:
