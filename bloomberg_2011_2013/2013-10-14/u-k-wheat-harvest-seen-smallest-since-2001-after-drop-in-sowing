The U.K. wheat harvest, historically
the European Union’s third-largest, may be the smallest this
year since 2001 after winter-crop planting decreased, according
to the government.  Farmers may gather 12.1 million metric tons of the grain,
the country’s main arable crop, down 8.7 percent from 13.26
million tons last year, the Department for Environment, Food &
Rural Affairs said today in its first  forecast  for 2013 grain
production. Barley output may jump 29 percent to 7.1 million
tons, the biggest crop since 1997.  The U.K. saw its second-wettest year on record in 2012,
according to the  Met Office , slashing the quality of last year’s
wheat and preventing farmers from planting winter grain and
rapeseed crops that were harvested this year. Farmers instead
boosted planting of spring crops including barley and oats after
the weather turned dryer since the beginning of 2013, said Jack
Watts, a senior analyst at the Agriculture & Horticulture
Development Board in Kenilworth,  England .  “Last year we had a small crop with poor quality,” Watts
said Oct. 11 in an interview at the European Commodities
Exchange in Paris. “This year it’s still a small crop, but the
quality is much improved. Normally we have some of the cheapest
feed wheat in  Europe , but this year we may be one of the most
expensive.”  U.S. Drought  Feed-wheat futures on NYSE Liffe in  London  climbed to a
record last year amid rallies in crop prices worldwide following
drought in the U.S., the world’s biggest corn grower and
exporter. Feed wheat for November delivery traded at 162 pounds
($258) a ton today, up 8 percent from a low on Sept. 18.  Defra said it will release estimates of wheat and barley
yields and crop area, as well as figures for other grains and
rapeseed, on Oct. 17. France and  Germany  are the EU’s two
biggest wheat producers.  Wheat use by  millers  in the U.K. totaled 497,000 tons in
August, up 4 percent from a year earlier, Defra said in a
separate report today. Brewers, malt makers and distillers used
60,000 tons of the grain during the month and 152,000 tons of
barley, for respective annual gains of 4 percent and 7 percent,
according to the report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
