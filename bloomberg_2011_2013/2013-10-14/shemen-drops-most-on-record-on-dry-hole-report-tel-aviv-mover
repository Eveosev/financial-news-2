Shemen Oil & Gas Resources Ltd. (SMOG) 
plunged the most on record after production tests at the
explorer’s Yam-3 well offshore  Israel  revealed a “dry hole.”  The  shares  tumbled 87 percent, the most since they began
trading on the Tel-Aviv Stock Exchange in December 2011, to
0.126 shekel at the close. The drop pared the company’s market
value to 67 million shekels ($19 million). Investors traded 55
times the three-month average daily volume. The benchmark  TA-25
Index (TA-25)  advanced 0.8 percent.  Rig operator Caspian Drilling Co. reported production tests
in two sections of the drill showed the well was a dry hole,
according to Shemen’s filing with the exchange yesterday after
markets closed. The explorer said today it does not plan
production tests for gas at a depth of 3,440 meters at the site
16 kilometers (10 miles) from the Mediterranean port city of
Ashdod.  “This is very disappointing news for Shemen,” Guil Bashan, an analyst at  Tel-Aviv  based IBI-Israel Brokerage &
Investments Ltd., with over 27 billion shekels under management,
said by phone. “This raises very big questions about continued
efforts, by other explorers, in the same area.”  The company said in December it was targeting as much as
120 million barrels of crude oil potential and 1.8 trillion
cubic feet of gas potential. The  U.S. Geological Survey 
estimates the Eastern Mediterranean’s Levant basin, of which
Israel covers approximately 45 percent, contains about 1.7
billion barrels of recoverable oil.  Shemen holds a 77.69 percent stake in the Shemen 387
license, according to yesterday’s filing. Caspian Drilling owns
10 percent,  Zerah Oil & Gas Explorations LP (ZRAHL)  7.15 percent and
 Zmiha Investment House Ltd. (TZMI)  holds about 5 percent.  Zerah plunged 59 percent, the most on record, while Zmiha
shares dropped 51 percent today.  “It will be harder to convince investors to put money into
oil exploration efforts in the area,” Noam Pincu, an analyst at
Psagot Investment House Ltd. in Tel Aviv, said by phone.  To contact the reporter on this story:
