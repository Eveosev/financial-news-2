JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM)  sold $5.12
million of two-year notes that yield five times  Banco Bilbao
Vizcaya Argentaria SA (BBVA) ’s gains, the first offering linked to the
lender since at least January 2010.  The securities, issued Oct. 8, pay a maximum of 40 percent
with all capital at risk, according to a prospectus filed with
the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. JPMorgan valued the
notes at 95 cents on the dollar.  Justin Perras , a spokesman for JPMorgan in New York,
declined to comment on the offering.  BBVA, Spain’s second-biggest bank, issued $1.5 billion of
contingent convertible bonds in April, the first European bank
to sell the securities complying with new rules governing how
they can be employed to bolster balance sheets. The bank is
using the proceeds for its Tier 1 capital, the riskiest segment.
The bonds automatically convert to stock if the bank’s Tier 1
ratio falls below 5.125 percent of assets weighted by risk.  The Bilbao-based bank rose 28 percent this year to 8.94
euros ($12.14) at the close of trading in  Madrid  today.  Bloomberg started collecting comprehensive data on U.S.
SEC-registered structured notes in 2010.  Banks create the securities by packaging debt with
derivatives to offer customized bets to retail investors while
earning fees and raising money. Derivatives are contracts whose
value is derived from stocks, bonds, commodities and currencies,
or events such as changes in interest rates or the weather.  To contact the reporter on this story:
