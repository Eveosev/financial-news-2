Tropical Storm Octave weakened as it
bore down on Baja California in  Mexico , according to the U.S.
 National Hurricane Center .  Octave was about 85 miles (137 kilometers) southwest of
Cabo San Lazaro, Mexico, with maximum sustained winds of 50
miles per hour, the center said in an advisory at 5 p.m.  New
York  time. It was moving north-northeast at 9 mph.  “Additional weakening is forecast during the next 48 hours
and Octave could become a tropical depression on Tuesday by the
time it nears the Baja California Peninsula,” the Miami-based
hurricane center said.  Tropical storm warnings, meaning winds of at least 39 mph,
heavy rains and surf are expected within 24 hours, were posted
from  Santa Fe  to Punta Abreojos in Mexico. As much as 3 to 6
inches (8 to 15 centimeters) of rain may fall, with some areas
getting as much as 8 inches, according to the center.  “The primary threat from Octave will be heavy rainfall
that could lead to flash floods and mudslides, especially in
mountainous terrain,” Stacy Stewart, a senior hurricane
specialist at the center, said in a forecast analysis.  The center is also tracking Tropical Storm Priscilla, which
has top winds of 45 mph and is 630 miles southwest of the
southern tip of  Baja California . Priscilla is moving north and
isn’t a threat to land.  To contact the reporter on this story:
