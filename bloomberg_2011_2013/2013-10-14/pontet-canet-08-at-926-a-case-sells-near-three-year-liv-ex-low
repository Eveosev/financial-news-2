A case of 2008 wine from Chateau
Pontet-Canet, a Pauillac estate north of  Bordeaux , sold for 580
pounds ($926) on the Liv-ex market in  London  last week, near a
three-year low amid weakening demand for top Bordeaux labels.  The transaction was at the same level as one on Sept. 30
and compared with the 578 pounds a case at which 24 bottles
changed hands on Sept. 23, the lowest level since April 2010,
according to data on Liv-ex’s Cellar Watch website. The vintage
traded as high as 630 pounds on Oct. 3.  The Liv-ex Fine Wine 50 Index has been falling since mid-March following a muted response to the sales campaign for
Bordeaux 2012 wine futures. While gains in the first 10 weeks of
the year mean it has still risen 1 percent since the end of
December, the London wine market has also had to grapple with
the effects of a sterling rally against the dollar since July.  “It makes things difficult for sterling wine prices,”
 Chris Smith , an investment manager at The Wine Investment Fund
in London, said by phone Oct. 11. The fund, invested in
Bordeaux, manages $50 million.  Pontet-Canet, a neighbor of first-growth estate Chateau
 Mouton Rothschild , has 81 hectares (200 acres) of vineyards and
traces its history back to the 18th century. It has been owned
since 1975 by the Tesseron family, according to its website.  Cabernet Sauvignon  The vines, comprising 62 percent  Cabernet Sauvignon , 32
percent Merlot, 4 percent Cabernet Franc and 2 percent Petit
Verdot, have an average age of 40 to 45 years and are planted at
a density of 9,500 per hectare.  The current trading level is little changed from the 575
pounds a case at which it fetched in May 2009 soon after its
release to the market. It fell as low as 490 pounds in both
August 2009 and March 2010 before rallying, according to Cellar
Watch data.  The vintage’s peak came in June 2011, amid strong Chinese
buying interest in Bordeaux, when three cases sold for 887
pounds each, according to the data. Its Liv-ex high this year of
667 pounds was reached in May, while four cases sold at a Hart 
Davis Hart Wine Co. sale in  Chicago  in February for $1,314 each,
according to results on the auction house’s website.  Pontet-Canet’s 2008 vintage is the second-cheapest of the
past five years, ahead only of the 2012, and trades at less than
half the level of the 2009 and 2010 wines, according to Cellar
Watch data.  The 2008 wines were assigned 96 points on a 100-point
scoring system by U.S. critic  Robert Parker , and were followed
by two perfect 100-point scores for the 2009 and 2010 vintages.  To contact the reporter on this story:
