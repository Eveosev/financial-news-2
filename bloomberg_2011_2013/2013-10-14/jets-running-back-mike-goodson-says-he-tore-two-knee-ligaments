New York Jets running back Mike Goodson said he tore two knee ligaments yesterday in the
National Football League team’s 19-6 loss to the Pittsburgh
Steelers.  Goodson, who has rushed for 61 yards in limited playing
time this season, said on his Twitter account that MRI images
revealed torn anterior cruciate and medial collateral ligaments.
An isolated ACL tear typically takes at least six months for
recovery.  “Not too happy right now but everything happens for a
reason!” Goodson, 26, said today on his Twitter account.  Jets spokesman  Bruce Speight  said in an e-mail that coach
 Rex Ryan  will address team injuries in his press conference
scheduled for this afternoon.  Goodson in March signed a three-year, $6.9 million contract
with Jets, and was suspended without pay for the first four
games of the NFL season for violating the league’s substance
abuse policy.  He returned to the field for the team’s 30-28 win over the
 Atlanta Falcons  on Oct. 7, rushing for 32 yards on three
carries. Yesterday he ran for 29 yards on four carries before
leaving in the fourth quarter clutching his left knee.  In five season with the Carolina Panthers, Oakland Raiders
and Jets, Goodson has rushed for 783 yards and three touchdowns.  -- Editors: Jay Beberman, Michael Sillup  To contact the reporters on this story:
