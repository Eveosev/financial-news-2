Water rates, which for some U.S.
customers have more than doubled since 2000, are probably going
to increase in the short term as companies struggle with rising
debt and the need to spend on infrastructure, according to a
Columbia University report.  Utility debt increased on average 33 percent from 2000 to
2010, while water rates rose 23 percent, a report by Columbia’s
Water Center concluded. For a third of the more than 1,000
utilities surveyed by the American Water Works Association, debt
and rates gained more than 100 percent in the time period.  “The problem of escalating debt and rising rates is not a
problem limited to a handful of poorly managed utilities, but
includes many well-run utilities,” Ed Pinero, head of
sustainability for  North America  at  Veolia Environnement SA (VIE) ,
said in a statement today. “Many of today’s water managers are
operating in an old framework that needs to be re-examined for
the 21st century.”  Water infrastructure in the U.S. needs at least $1 trillion
in investment to repair and replace systems, according to a
report released in March by the American Society of Civil
Engineers. The group gave U.S water infrastructure a barely
passing D grade, citing almost 240,000 water main breaks
annually and an average reservoir age of 52 years.  The report suggests companies should improve operational
efficiency, focus on environmentally sustainable water sources
and explore alternative rate structures.  Veolia Environnement ,  Europe ’s largest water company, is
one of several companies and organizations that fund the Water
Center.  To contact the reporter on this story:
