Copper futures rose for the third
straight session after imports jumped to an 18-month high in
 China , the world’s biggest user of the metal.  Shipments of unwrought copper and products rose 18 percent
to 457,850 metric tons in September, customs  data  showed Oct.
12. That was the highest since March 2012. Prices also increased
after inventories tracked by the London Metal Exchange declined
for a 28th straight session.  “People had been discounting China, so any type of news
that looks positive for the economy there is going to be
supportive for copper,”  Adam Klopfenstein , a senior market
strategist at Archer Financial Services Inc. in  Chicago , said in
a telephone interview.  Copper futures for delivery in December added 1 percent to
settle at $3.303 a pound at 1:21 p.m. on the Comex in  New York .
The metal gained 1.2 percent in the previous two sessions.  Inventories monitored by the LME are at the lowest since
March, daily exchange data showed.  Copper also rose as the dollar weakened for a second
session against a 10-currency basket, boosting the appeal of the
metal as an alternative investment. U.S. government borrowing
authority is set to lapse in three days unless politicians agree
to increase the debt ceiling.  On the LME, copper for delivery in three months increased
0.8 percent to $7,255 a metric ton ($3.29 a pound).  Lead, nickel and zinc climbed in  London . Tin and aluminum
fell.  To contact the reporters on this story:
