Clariant AG (CLN) , the Swiss specialty
chemicals maker, dropped to a two-month low after a MainFirst
Bank AG analyst said currency swings and higher-than-expected
debt levels may weigh on second-half results.  The shares fell as much as 3.8 percent to 14.63 Swiss
francs, the lowest intraday price since Aug. 7. About 2.3
million shares traded hands, 58 percent more than the average
daily volume of the past three months.  “Nasty” emerging market currencies and the dollar have
declined against the Swiss franc, Bernd Pomrehn, the analyst,
wrote in a note to investors. Clariant gets 21 percent of sales
in emerging market currencies and 34 percent of sales in
dollars, he estimates. Pomrehn downgraded the stock to
underperform from outperform.  The dollar fell 3.8 percent against the Swiss franc in the
past three months, while the  Indian Rupee  dropped 6.6 percent
against the franc over the same period.  Clariant may end the year with debt of more than 1.4
billion francs ($1.5 billion), exceeding the company’s forecast
of as much as 1.3 billion Swiss francs after lower-than-expected
proceeds from a sale of textile, paper, and emulsions chemicals
assets to SK Capital Partners LP announced earlier this month,
Pomrehn said.  The shares traded 3.5 percent lower at 14.67 francs as of
1:14 p.m. in Zurich. Clariant is scheduled to report nine-month
results Oct. 30.  To contact the reporter on this story:
