Steel reinforcement-bar futures in
 Shanghai  rose for a third day on signs demand for the building
material may be growing.  Rebar for delivery in January on the Shanghai Futures
Exchange climbed as much as 0.4 percent to 3,615  yuan  ($591) a
metric ton and traded 3,610 yuan a metric ton at 10:18 a.m.
Beijing time. The most-active contract gained 0.4 percent last
week, the most since the five days through Aug. 16.  The spot price of rebar advanced 0.5 percent last week.
Inventory was 6.06 million tons on Oct. 11, 116,000 tons less
than on Oct. 8, said Xia Junyan, an analyst at Wanda Futures
Co., citing data by researcher Mysteel.com.  “The moderate gain in spot prices and a decline in
inventory shows consumption is recovering,” said Shanghai-based
Xia. “We expect relatively good demand as we approach winter.”  Iron ore  for immediate delivery at Tianjin port was little
changed at $133.10 a dry ton on Oct. 11, according to a  price
index  compiled by The Steel Index Ltd. The average  spot  price of
rebar was little changed at 3,506 yuan a ton on the same day,
