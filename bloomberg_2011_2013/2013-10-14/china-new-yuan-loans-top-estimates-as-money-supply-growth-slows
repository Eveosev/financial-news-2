China ’s  money-supply  growth slowed
in September and new local-currency loans were more than
forecast, data from the People’s Bank of China today showed.  M2, China’s broadest measure of money supply, rose 14.2
percent from a year earlier, the Beijing-based central bank said
in a statement on its website. That compared with the median
economist estimate of 14.2 percent in a Bloomberg News survey
and 14.7 percent in August.  New yuan loans were 787 billion yuan, compared with the 675
billion yuan median analyst estimate and 623.2 billion yuan a
year earlier. Aggregate financing, the government’s broadest
measure of credit, was 1.4 trillion yuan, compared with the 1.35
trillion yuan median projection and 1.65 trillion  yuan  a year
ago.  China’s foreign-exchange reserves, the world’s largest,
rose to $3.66 trillion from $3.5 trillion at the end of June.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
