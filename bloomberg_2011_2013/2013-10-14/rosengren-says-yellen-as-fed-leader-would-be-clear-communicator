Janet Yellen  will be an effective
communicator if she becomes chairman of the  Federal Reserve ,
according to Boston Fed President  Eric Rosengren .  Yellen “would be very good at speaking precisely, very
clearly, and very calmly,” Rosengren said in an interview aired
today on Bloomberg Television’s “In the Loop with Betty Liu.”
The interview was taped on Oct. 11.  Yellen, who is President  Barack Obama ’s nominee to succeed
 Ben S. Bernanke , has led a subcommittee of the Federal Open
Market Committee focused on improving the central bank’s
communication strategies. The effort is designed to increase
openness on Fed policy, reduce market volatility and assure
consumers and investors that the Fed will continue to provide
support to the economy so long as unemployment remains high.  “If you read her speeches, she is very precise in her
language, she has really thought it through,” Rosengren said.  The shutdown of the government, now stretching into a third
week, has impaired the Fed’s ability to assess the pace of
economic improvement and decide whether to reduce its $85
billion in monthly asset purchases, Rosengren said.  The shutdown has closed the Department of Labor and
Department of Commerce which produce reports on unemployment,
inflation and economic growth.  “Ideally we’d have really good data that would be
available at the time we’re making the decision,” Rosengren
said. “It looks more than likely we are not going to have good
data.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
