India ’s rupee snapped a two-day gain
before a report that economists predict will show inflation
stayed near a seven-month-high, reducing room for the central
bank to spur slowing growth.  Wholesale prices  rose 6 percent in September from a year
earlier, according to the median of 33 estimates in a Bloomberg
survey before data due around noon in  New Delhi  today. That’s
little changed from August’s 6.1 percent, which was the fastest
pace since February.  Industrial production  climbed 0.6 percent
in August, slowing from July’s 2.8 percent, a government report
issued after the market shut on Oct. 11 showed. The median
estimate in a Bloomberg survey was for a 2 percent gain.  “Even as the growth dynamics remain on the downside it is
unlikely to attain much priority from the  Reserve Bank  of
India,” economists at Kotak Mahindra Bank Ltd., including
Indranil Pan in Mumbai, wrote in a research report today.  The rupee fell 0.2 percent to 61.1850 per dollar as of 9:59
a.m. in Mumbai, according to prices from local banks compiled by
Bloomberg. The currency has rebounded more than 12 percent from
a record low of 68.845 touched Aug. 28.  One-month implied volatility, a measure of expected moves
in the  exchange rate  used to price options, rose 16 basis points,
or 0.16 percentage point, to 14.9 percent. The rate has fallen
from a five-year high of 22.4 percent on Sept. 4.  Rate Decision  The rupee’s relative stability will allow the central bank
to further relax cash-supply curbs that had been announced to
steady the currency, even as the monetary authority raises the
benchmark rate to arrest inflation, the Kotak Mahindra
economists wrote. The bank predicts the  Reserve Bank of India 
will cut the marginal standing facility by 25 basis points to
8.75 percent at a review on Oct. 29, while the repurchase rate
will be boosted by 25 basis points to 7.75 percent.  U.S. Senate leaders have yet to reach an agreement on how
to end the fiscal impasse pertaining to raising the debt ceiling
three days before the government’s borrowing authority lapses.  One-month onshore rupee forwards fell 0.2 percent to 61.73
per dollar, data compiled by Bloomberg show. Offshore non-deliverable contracts declined 0.3 percent to 61.66. Forwards
are agreements to buy or sell assets at a set price and date.
Non-deliverable contracts are settled in dollars.  To contact the reporter on this story:
