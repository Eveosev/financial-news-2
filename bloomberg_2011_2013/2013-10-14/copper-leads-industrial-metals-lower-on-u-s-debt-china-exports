Copper led declines in most
industrial metals as deadlocked talks on the U.S. debt limit and
an unexpected decline in  China ’s exports fueled concerns that
demand may weaken from the world’s two biggest users.  The metal for delivery in three months on the London Metal
Exchange dropped as much as 0.8 percent to $7,140 a metric ton
and traded at $7,187.50 at 10:03 a.m. in Shanghai. Aluminum fell
0.4 percent and nickel retreated 0.5 percent.  The U.S. Senate wrapped up almost four hours of debate in
 Washington  without unveiling a deal, with the nation’s borrowing
authority set to lapse Oct. 17. China’s exports unexpectedly
fell in September and inflation jumped on food prices, signaling
constraints on the nation’s recovery.  “Investors expected American lawmakers to reach an
agreement and they disappointed again,” said Xu Liping, an
analyst at HNA Topwin Futures Co. in  Shanghai , “In China, the
September economic figures show that it’s no easy matter to have
a sustained recovery in demand.”  The worldwide glut of copper supply is poised to almost
triple in 2014, driving prices to the lowest in at least three
years at a time when the International Monetary Fund says
economic growth will be weaker than forecast. Copper stockpiles
tracked by the Shanghai Futures Exchange rose to the highest
level in almost two months last week.  Futures for delivery in December were little changed at
$3.268 a pound on the Comex in New York. The January contract on
the Shanghai Futures Exchange rose 0.4 percent to 51,850  yuan 
($8,474) a ton.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
