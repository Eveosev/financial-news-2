Palm shipments from  Indonesia 
advanced in September for the first time in four months on
reduced supplies of substitutes, boosting demand for the most-consumed cooking oil from the world’s biggest producer.  Exports gained 11 percent to 1.64 million metric tons from
1.48 million tons in August, the Indonesian Palm Oil Association
said in a statement e-mailed today. That’s the first advance
since May, when sales jumped 21 percent, and compares with 1.38
million tons in September 2012, data compiled by Bloomberg show.
The median of estimates from four plantation executives and an
industry official in a Bloomberg survey was for an increase to
1.6 million tons.  Rising palm demand may extend a rally in futures that
slumped to an almost four-year low in July on prospects for
record global  supplies . U.S. reserves of soybeans, crushed to
make  soybean oil , were at their lowest in four years last
month. While U.S. farmers will collect a record bean crop this
year, the harvest progress trailed a five-year average as of
Sept. 29, government data showed.  “Exports are rising strongly, so stockpiles will not build
up as fast as earlier thought,” said Sandeep Bajoria, chief
executive officer of Mumbai-based broker Sunvin Group, by phone.  Imports by  India , the world’s biggest buyer, jumped 23
percent to 431,240 tons and purchases by  China , the biggest
cooking oil consumer, climbed 7.3 percent to 182,740 tons,
according to Gapki.  Stockpile Estimates  Reserves were probably at 2.23 million tons from 2.2
million tons, the Bloomberg survey showed. Output gained 14
percent to 2.4 million tons, according to the median of
estimates from four respondents. Gapki doesn’t publish
inventories and production data. The forecasts for changes in
reserves and output were derived by Bloomberg compared with
earlier survey findings.  The contract for delivery in December traded at 2,370
ringgit ($746) a ton on the Bursa  Malaysia  Derivatives by 12:29
p.m. in  Kuala Lumpur . Prices dropped to 2,137 ringgit in July,
the lowest level since October 2009.  Soybeans traded at $12.74 a bushel on the Chicago Board of
Trade today, 9.6 percent higher from a 19-month low in August.
U.S. inventories of 141 million bushels on Sept. 1 were the
smallest in four years, according to the  U.S. Department of
Agriculture . Eleven percent of crops in the main U.S. growing
areas were harvested as of Sept. 29, less than the previous
five-year average of 20 percent, USDA data show.  Harvest Delays  Farmers in  South America  delayed soybean planting because
of dry weather, while rain curbed sunflower harvests in Ukraine
and Russia, Hamburg-based Oil World said Oct. 1.  “Delays in the U.S. soybean harvest because of rain in the
Midwest and sunflower harvest in  Russia  and Ukraine have
drastically cut shipments of oilseeds,” and that has led to an
increase in palm oil demand, said the planters and refiners
association, called Gapki.  Exports from Malaysia rose 5.2 percent to 1.61 million tons
in September, rising for a fourth month, the Malaysian Palm Oil
Board said Oct. 10. Malaysia is the top producer after Indonesia.  The USDA estimates Indonesia’s production at a record 31
million tons in 2013-2014. World output will advance 5 percent
to 58.1 million tons, boosting stockpiles by 17 percent to an
all-time high of 9.2 million tons, according to the agency.  To contact the reporters on this story:
