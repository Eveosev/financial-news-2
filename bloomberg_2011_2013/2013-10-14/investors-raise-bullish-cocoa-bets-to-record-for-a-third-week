Money managers raised bullish bets
on cocoa traded in London to a  record  for a third straight week
as demand accelerates and shortages loom, according to data from
NYSE Liffe, the derivatives arm of NYSE Euronext.  Investors were net-long, or betting on higher prices, by
65,317 futures and options in the week ended Oct. 8, the
Commitments of Traders report on the exchange’s  website  showed
today. That was the largest bullish bet since publishing of
trader holdings began in 2011 and compared with the previous
record of 64,759 contracts a week earlier. The beans for
December delivery rallied 3.7 percent in the latest period.  Cocoa processing, an indication of demand, rose 4.7 percent
in  Europe  in the third quarter, the European Cocoa Association
said Oct. 10. The so-called grind fell 16 percent in the year-earlier period. North American grindings may have risen 5.1
percent from July to September, according to the average of
estimates from 10 traders and analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  The European processing figures are “confirming the
positive uptrend in western cocoa demand,”  Kona Haque , a
London-based analyst at Macquarie Group Ltd., said in a report
e-mailed Oct. 11. “The much-needed rains in West Africa are now
here, but this is delaying harvesting, at a time when grinders
are desperate for new supplies.”  Bull Market  Global cocoa supplies will trail demand by 173,000 metric
tons in the year started Oct. 1, according to Macquarie. A
113,000-ton shortage is estimated for the following season, said
Haque, who correctly forecast a third-quarter price rally. Cocoa
entered a  bull market  in London last month. Global chocolate
sales will rise 6.2 percent next year to a record $117 billion,
according to Euromonitor International Ltd.  In robusta coffee, money managers reduced their  net-short
position , or bet on falling prices, to 4,696 futures and options
in the latest week, the data showed. That compares with 6,690
contracts a week earlier. The beans used to make instant coffee
gained 3.7 percent in the period.  Investors boosted bets on rising white-sugar prices by 12
percent. They were  net-long  by 9,925 futures and options,
against 8,831 contracts a week earlier, exchange data showed.
The sweetener rose 1.8 percent in the period.  In feed wheat, money managers were net-short by 325
contracts, down from 440 lots a week earlier. The grain advanced
4 percent in the period.  To contact the reporter on this story:
