Brazil ’s swap rates climbed after a
government official said he expects a gasoline price increase
this year, boosting bets that the central bank will extend
raises in borrowing costs to curb inflation.  Swap rates due in January 2016 rose four basis points, or
0.04 percentage point, to 11.01 percent at 3:43 p.m. in Sao
Paulo. The real slipped 0.1 percent to 2.1783 per dollar.  Energy Minister Edison Lobao told reporters in Brasilia he
is “confident” that Finance Minister  Guido Mantega  will
approve a gasoline price increase this year as chairman of the
state-run oil company Petroleo Brasileiro SA. President  Dilma Rousseff  said inflation will close the year within the central
bank’s target range of 2.5 percent to 6.5 percent.  “We have the prospect that the gas prices will be
increased, which is causing more speculation of further
borrowing cost increases,”  Jankiel Santos , the chief economist
at Banco Espirito Santo de Investimento SA, said in a telephone
interview. “The president is also saying Brazil will meet its
inflation target, which reinforces the notion that we’ll have
more austerity.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
