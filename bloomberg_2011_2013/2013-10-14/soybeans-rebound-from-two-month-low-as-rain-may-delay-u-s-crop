Soybean futures rose from an eight-week low as precipitation slows harvesting in the U.S., the
world’s biggest producer. Corn and wheat also gained.  As much as 1.3 inches (3.3 centimeters) of rain in the next
two days will curtail harvesting from  North Dakota  to
 Mississippi , with lighter amounts in the eastern portion of the
Midwest,  T-Storm Weather LLC  said in a report. Freezing
temperatures next weekend will end the growing season in much of
the Midwest with little impact on yields, the forecaster said.  “Harvesting is going to slow and farmers continue to hold
tightly to supplies, lending support to the futures and cash
markets,” Greg Grow, the director of agribusiness for Archer
Financial Services Inc. in Chicago, said in a telephone
interview. “Most of the early harvest is going into storage as
farmers will wait for a rebound in prices.”  Soybean futures for delivery in November climbed 0.5
percent to close at $12.73 a bushel at 1:15 p.m. on the  Chicago 
Board of Trade, after touching $12.6175, the lowest since Aug.
16.  U.S. soybean  reserves  left from the 2012 harvest on Sept. 1
fell to a four-year low of 141 million bushels, the government
said Sept. 30. Processing probably fell 11 percent in September
from a year earlier, the National Oilseed Processors Association
is expected to say tomorrow, according to a Bloomberg Survey of
six analysts.  “Supplies have been extremely tight and exporters are a
little more aggressive,” bidding for immediate inventories,
Grow said.  Corn futures for delivery in December rose 0.9 percent to
$4.37 a bushel in Chicago after declining five of the past six
weeks. U.S. production is expected to rise 28 percent to a
record this year.  Wheat futures for delivery in December gained less than 0.1
percent to $6.925 a bushel on the CBOT. The most-active contract
touched a 15-week high at $6.9975 on Oct. 8.  To contact the reporter on this story:
