J. Michael Yeager, the former head
of  BHP Billiton Ltd. (BHP) ’s oil and gas division, was named chief
executive officer of Maverick Drilling & Exploration Ltd., an
explorer that’s listed in Australia and focused on the U.S.  Don Henrich will retire as Maverick’s executive chairman
after running the company for more than 37 years, while
Executive Director Brad Simmons will leave, the Brisbane-based
company said today in a statement.  Yeager, who led BHP’s $20 billion move into the U.S. shale
gas industry, joins Maverick as the company moves to have its
stock trade in the U.S. before the end of the year, according to
the statement. Maverick, which has dropped 41 percent this year
in Sydney trading, holds leases in producing oil fields south of
Houston.  Maverick (MAD)  closed at 42.5 Australian cents a share on Oct.
11, before being halted, valuing the company at A$192 million
($182 million).  Yeager, a graduate of the U.S. Naval Academy who left
Melbourne-based BHP earlier this year, has previously worked at
Exxon Mobil Corp. He will receive a salary of $1.3 million and a
retirement contribution of $500,000 annually, Maverick said. He
also will get 15 million Maverick shares and 10 million
performance rights, subject to shareholder approval, according
to Maverick, whose main office is in Houston.  To contact the reporter on this story:
