Freight traders are hiring record
numbers of  iron-ore  carriers in the  spot market  as Chinese steel
production expands at the fastest pace in three years, spurring
the biggest rally in shipping rates since 2009.  One-time charters to haul the commodity on Capesizes, the
largest ore carriers, rose 51 percent to 124 in September from
the previous month, according to data compiled by Morgan
Stanley. More than 90 percent are bound for China, and the ore
they carry would make enough steel to build about 150 Golden
Gate Bridges. The surge means more demand for  Nippon Yusen K.K. (9101) 
and Mitsui O.S.K. Lines Ltd., which are based in  Tokyo  and
control the biggest fleets.  The jump in chartering reflects average monthly Chinese
steel output that’s been about 10 percent higher in 2013,
reducing the nation’s ore stockpiles to the lowest for this time
of year since 2007. Imports of the raw material into  China  rose
to a record last month. The demand is diminishing the fleet’s
biggest capacity glut in three decades, spurring an almost
sevenfold surge in rates since Jan. 2 that means ship owners are
making money again for the first time in almost two years.  “Rates have moved quicker than even the most optimistic
forecasters had hoped for only a few months back,” said Eirik Haavaldsen, an analyst at Oslo-based Pareto Securities AS, whose
recommendations on the shares of shipping companies returned 18
percent in the past six months. “We have really seen a
restocking commencing.”  Freight Swaps  Daily rates for Capesizes, each hauling about 160,000
metric tons, jumped to a 34-month high of $42,211 on Sept. 25,
according to the  Baltic Exchange , which publishes shipping costs
for more than 50 marine routes. They were at $31,545 yesterday.
Freight swaps, traded by brokers and used to bet on future
rates, anticipate a fourth-quarter average of $28,500, the most
since 2011. The 1,000-foot carriers need about $14,500 to break
even, says RS Platou Markets AS, an investment bank in Oslo.  Shares of  Nippon Yusen , with 68 Capesizes in its fleet,
rose 62 percent to 326 yen this year and will reach 333.07 yen
in 12 months, according to the average of 14 analyst forecasts
compiled by Bloomberg. Those of Mitsui O.S.K., which owns 64 of
the ships, gained 74 percent to 443 yen and will be at 438.31
yen in a year, the average of 13 estimates shows. The fleet-size
data were compiled by Clarkson Plc, the biggest shipbroker.  China may be producing more steel than it needs, according
to Morgan Stanley analyst Fotis Giannakoulis in  New York . The
surge in charters comes as growth in the nation’s $8.36 trillion
economy slows. China buys about two-thirds of all seaborne iron
ore, the second-biggest commodity cargo after crude oil.  Monetary Fund  The  International Monetary Fund  cut its 2014 growth
forecast for the country on Oct. 8, predicting a pace of 7.3
percent, from a July estimate of 7.7 percent. That would be the
slowest expansion since 1990. The  World Bank  lowered its
prediction a day earlier to 7.7 percent from 8 percent.  Owners also are contending with a fleet whose capacity more
than doubled since June 2008, when Capesize rates rose to a
record $233,988 a day and triggered an unprecedented number of
orders for new vessels, according to data from London-based
Clarkson. Trade in iron ore climbed 40 percent over the same
period, the broker’s data show.  The rally in rates is curbing the biggest ship-demolition
program in at least three decades. Owners who previously
intended to scrap vessels are now trading them again, Global
Marketing Systems Inc., the biggest buyer of obsolete carriers,
said Oct. 3. Older Capesizes sailing to China from  Brazil , the
most important trade route for iron ore, can earn $1.4 million
from a single voyage, according to Arctic Securities ASA in
Oslo. A 15 year-old ship costs about $17 million.  Fewer Demolitions  Even with fewer demolitions, the largest fleet expansion in
history is now easing. Ship yards have orders for new Capesizes
equal to 16 percent of current  capacity , down from as much as
100 percent five years ago, according to data from IHS Maritime,
a Coulsdon, England-based research company. The fleet will
expand 5 percent this year, the smallest gain in a decade,
according to Clarkson.  The rally in Capesize rates contrasts with declines
spanning most other shipping markets. The ClarkSea Index
measuring rates across the maritime industry averaged $9,472 a
day this year, heading for the lowest annual level on record.
The surplus of capacity for  oil tankers  delivering 2 million-barrel cargoes is the biggest since about 1985, according to
Fearnley Consultants A/S, a research company in Oslo.  Nippon Yusen, which also owns crude carriers, container
ships and car transporters, will report a 76 percent gain in net
income to 33.17 billion yen ($337.8 million) in its fiscal year
ending March 31, according to the mean of 16  analyst  estimates.  Narrow Losses  Mitsui O.S.K. (9104)  will make a profit of 45.63 billion yen,
compared with a loss of 178.8 billion yen in the prior year, the
average of 16 predictions shows. Seven out of 12 companies in
the Bloomberg Dry Ships Index will narrow losses or report a
profit in 2013, according to forecasts compiled by Bloomberg.  Trade in seaborne iron ore will expand 6 percent to 1.17
billion tons this year, with China taking 66 percent of the
total, Clarkson says. Shipments of dry-bulk commodities that
also include coal and grains will rise 5 percent to 4.3 billion
tons, according to the shipbroker.  Spot iron-ore fixtures provide the best indicator of
changing demand because they exclude cargoes moved under long-term contracts, according to Erik Nikolai Stavseth, an analyst
at Oslo-based investment bank Arctic Securities. The ships
booked in September will mostly unload this month and next.  Services Industry  China’s steel mills now account for 50 percent of global
output.  Manufacturing (CPMINDX)  in the country is expanding at the fastest
pace in 17 months, while growth in the services industry is the
strongest since March, government figures show.  The nation  imported  74.58 million tons of the ore last
month, 15 percent more than a year earlier, customs data show.
Its steel output averaged 65.1 million tons a month this year,
10 percent more than in 2012, according to data from the
Brussels-based World Steel Association. Stockpiles of iron ore
at China’s ports now come to 70 million tons, 24 percent less
than this time last year.  “China needs a much bigger restock in iron ore than last
year,” said Aneek Haq, a metals analyst at Exane BNP Paribas in
 London . “The recent increase in fixtures is a confirmation of
this.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
