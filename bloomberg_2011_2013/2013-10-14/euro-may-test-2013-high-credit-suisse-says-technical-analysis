The euro may rise to the strongest
versus the dollar this year if a key level of resistance fails
to hold, according to Credit Suisse Group AG.  The 17-nation currency is getting support from a key moving
average at $1.3505, above which it will test resistance in the
$1.3606-to-$1.3608 area, according to  David Sneddon , global head
of technical analysis in  London  at Credit Suisse. Further
strength above this will see the shared currency test $1.3646
and then $1.3711, the 2013 high touched Feb. 1.  “Euro-dollar continues to hold the 21-day average at
$1.3505, and we look for a basing effort here to retest the
$1.3646 peak,” Sneddon wrote today in a client note.
“Extension through here is required to see the trend turn
higher again for the $1.3711 February peak.”  The euro appreciated 0.3 percent to $1.3580 at 11:54 a.m.
in  New York  after rising as much as 0.4 percent to $1.3598.
 Europe ’s shared currency reached $1.3646 on Oct. 3, the highest
level since Feb. 4.  The European currency has gained 5.9 percent this year,
making it the best performer among 10 developed-market
currencies tracked by Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes.
The yen has lost the most, falling 11 percent, while the dollar
has risen 2.6 percent.  In  technical analysis , investors and analysts study charts
