Unit4 NV (UNIT4) , a Dutch software provider,
rose the most in five years after saying it received interest
from private-equity companies for a takeover at a price of as
much as 1 billion euros ($1.4 billion).  Unit4 gained as much as 17 percent, the biggest intraday
jump since October 2008, and was up 14 percent at 33.30 euros as
of 10:06 a.m. in Amsterdam, valuing the company at 989 million
euros ($1.3 billion).  “Following these approaches, Unit4 has engaged in
exploratory discussions,” the Sliedrecht-based company said in
an e-mailed statement today. The companies showed interest in
paying as much as 35 euros a share, Unit 4 said. “There is no
certainty that these discussions will lead to a public offer
being made.”  Unit4 said it appointed ING Groep NV and Oppenheimer as
financial advisers and De Brauw Blackstone Westbroek as legal
advisers.  “Assuming that an undisclosed private equity party pays 35
euros per share, we feel that shareholders should accept that
offer,” Martijn den Drijver, an Amsterdam-based analyst at SNS
Securities, said in a note today. SNS cut its recommendation to
sell from hold following the takeover interest.  To contact the reporter on this story:
