Ethanol futures advanced against
gasoline on low inventories and after the U.S. Environmental
Protection Agency said it hasn’t decided what to do about the
renewable fuel mandate for 2014.  The spread narrowed 2.63 cents to 92.38 cents a gallon.
Inventories sank to a record low of 15.4 million barrels in the
week ended Oct. 4, while output declined to 868,000 barrels a
day from 875,000 a week earlier, Energy Information
Administration data show.  “After the EPA said no final decision has been made on the
mandate, all the attention turned to low inventories,” Renato
Dias, an analyst at Intl FCStone in Campinas,  Brazil , said in a
telephone interview.  Denatured ethanol for November delivery rose 2.5 cents, or
1.5 percent, to settle at $1.743 a gallon at the Chicago Board
of Trade, the highest since Oct. 3. Futures have dropped 20
percent this year.  Gasoline for November delivery fell 0.13 cent to close at
$2.6668 a gallon in the  New York Mercantile Exchange . The
contract covers reformulated gasoline, made to be blended with
ethanol before delivery to filling stations.  RINs, certificates attached to each gallon of biofuel that
are submitted to the government and can be traded among
companies, rose 2 cents to 32 cents a gallon, after sinking to a
seven-month low on Oct. 11, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. Advanced RINs, which cover biodiesel and Brazilian
sugarcane-based ethanol, were unchanged at 42 cents.  EIA Shutdown  Uncertainty about ethanol inventories will increase this
week as the EIA has stopped operating because of the federal
government shutdown, Dias said. There’s no schedule for the
weekly report on output and stockpiles.  Ethanol trading volumes were down 44 percent from the 30-day average as U.S. banks were closed for Columbus Day.  Corn for December delivery rose 3.75 cents, or 0.9 percent,
to $4.37 a bushel in  Chicago . Prices fell five of the past six
weeks. The December crush spread of corn to the biofuel was 5
cents a gallon, little changed from the previous session.  In cash market trading ethanol declined 1.5 cents to $2.055
a gallon in  New York  and gained 7 cents to $2.275 on the West
Coast, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The price was
unchanged at $2.08 in Chicago and at $2.18 on the  Gulf Coast .  New York’s premium to Chicago slipped to 22 cents, while
the West Coast’s premium to the Gulf rose to 9.5 cents.  To contact the reporter on this story:
