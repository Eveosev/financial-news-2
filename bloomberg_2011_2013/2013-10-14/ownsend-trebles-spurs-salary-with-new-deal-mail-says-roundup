The following is a roundup of soccer
stories from U.K. newspapers, with clickable Internet links.  Townsend’s Contract  Tottenham Hotspur and Andros Townsend agreed on a new
contract that will nearly treble the winger’s wages to 15,000
pounds ($24,000) a week, the  Daily Mail reported .  There will be scope for Townsend, who made a goal-scoring
debut for  England  last week, to get further raises in the future
should he continue to impress, the Mail added.  Moyes Eyes Darikwa  Manchester United manager is targeting Chesterfield
midfielder Tendayi Darikwa, who’s rated at 1.5 million pounds,
the  Sun reported .  Moyes watched Darikwa, 21, play in the League Two leader’s
1-1 draw against nearest rival Fleetwood Town two days ago, the
 Daily Telegraph reported .  Valdes Hint  Barcelona goalkeeper Victor Valdes hinted he will turn down
Arsenal and instead join  Monaco  when his contract expires after
this season, the  Daily Mail reported .  Former Barca defender  Eric Abidal  moved to the French
league team in July, and the Mail cited Valdes as saying that
“playing alongside him again would be special.”  Schmeichel to Sheffield?  Ex-Manchester United goalkeeper Peter Schmeichel will apply
for the vacant manager’s job at League One bottom club Sheffield
United, the  Daily Mirror reported .  Schmeichel, 49, has completed his coaching qualifications
and will enter the race to replace David Weir, who was fired
three days ago, the newspaper added.  To contact the reporter on this story:
