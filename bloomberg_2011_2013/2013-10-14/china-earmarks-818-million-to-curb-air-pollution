China ’s central government has
allocated 5 billion  yuan  ($818 million) to curb air pollution in
six regions including Beijing.  Tianjin city and the provinces of Hebei, Inner Mongolia,
Shanxi and Shandong also will get access to the funds, according
to a statement posted on the Ministry of Finance’s website today
in Beijing.  The money will be distributed to projects based on the
reduction in pollution and concentration of fine particulates
they intend to make.  The funds will focus on the northern province of Hebei,
which has some of the heaviest pollution, the ministry said.
Seven of the 10 cities with the worst air pollution were in the
northern province of Hebei in the first half, the Ministry of
Environmental Protection said in July.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
