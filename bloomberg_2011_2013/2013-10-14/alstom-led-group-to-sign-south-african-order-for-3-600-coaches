A group led by  Alstom SA (ALO)  will sign a
contract today to build 3,600 carriages for Passenger Rail
Agency of South Africa in the decade through 2025, the agency
said in an e-mailed statement.  South Africa is revamping its rail-passenger services to
meet the needs of a growing population and replace trains that
have been in use since the 1950s. The contract is a boon for
Alstom, whose orders for the April-June period dropped 32
percent from a year earlier to 4.07 billion euros ($5.5 billion)
because of falling demand for its thermal-power and rail
equipment.  The Gibela consortium led by Levallois-Perret, France-based
Alstom was last year named preferred bidder for a contract then
valued at 51 billion rands ($5.14 billion). Alstom outbid six
other companies, including  Bombardier Inc. (BDRBF)  from  Canada  and China
CNR Corp. Ltd. The project will create 8,100 jobs in South
Africa, the agency said in December.  To contact the reporters on this story:
