India , where 200,000 children four
and under die yearly of diseases caused by dirty water, plans to
spend 110 billion rupees ($1.8 billion) for the fiscal year
ending March 2014 to improve village water supplies.  Thatâ€™s an almost 5 percent increase from a year earlier.  Of the funds alloted to provincial governments to lay water
pipes and modernize networks, 5 percent will be used for
villages where groundwater sources have been contaminated by
chemicals, according to a  statement  from the Ministry of
Drinking Water and Sanitation.  About 15 percent of the funds will be spent to operate and
maintain existing networks, the ministry said yesterday. About
105 billion rupees were alloted for the financial year that
ended in March 2013, according to the  ministry  statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
