The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index has
ended its short-term correction and will continue its rally as
the benchmark U.S. equities gauge crossed above its 50-day
 moving average , ING Groep NV said.  The S&P 500 on Oct. 10 climbed above its mean over the
previous 50 days at 1,678.48, rebounding from a 4.8 percent
slump between Sept. 19 and Oct. 9. The moving average will now
provide the support for a short-term increase, Roelof-Jan van den Akker, a senior technical analyst at ING, wrote in a note.  “A weekly close above the upper end of the rising trend
channel around 1,740 this week is required to expect an
acceleration phase within the uptrend,” Van den Akker wrote.  The gauge has surged 149 percent from a low in March 2009
as Federal Reserve stimulus and a recovery in corporate earnings
fueled price gains.  Stocks retreated in late September and early October as
lawmakers failed to pass a budget, leading the U.S. government
to shut down some of its services and send hundreds of thousands
of workers on unpaid leave. The S&P 500 rose 0.8 percent last
week amid optimism that Congress will reach a deal and avoid a
sovereign default.  In technical analysis, investors and analysts study charts
of trading patterns and prices to forecast changes in a
security, commodity, currency or index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
