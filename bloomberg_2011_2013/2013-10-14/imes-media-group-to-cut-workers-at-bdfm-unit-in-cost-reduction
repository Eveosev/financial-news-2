Times Media Group Ltd. (TMG) , a South
African publisher, will cut staff on Business Day and Financial
Mail as it seeks to reduce costs by about 15 million rand ($1.51
million) a year, according to Editor-in-Chief Peter Bruce.  BDFM Publishers Ltd. will employ “closer to 100 than 150”
employees after the cuts, Bruce said in a mobile phone interview
today. The unit has about 150 staff now, he said. “We’re near
to the bottom of the cycle.”  Times Media has appointed a committee of managers to
present proposals on where it can reduce staff by the end of the
week, according to an internal e-mail sent to employees.  The company has been selling assets and is focusing on its
television business while seeking growth opportunities in
Southern and west Africa. The Johannesburg-based publisher
bought the 50 percent of BDFM it didn’t already own from
Financial Times-owner  Pearson Plc (PSON)  in April.  To contact the reporter on this story:
