Deutsche Telekom AG (DTE) , Germany’s
biggest phone company, is lobbying the government to enforce
tougher privacy protection by helping to keep German  Internet
traffic  within national borders.  The company is asking the German government for help in
setting up a framework for keeping Internet traffic including
electronic mail within the country, rather than having e-mails
and data routed through foreign hubs, it said in an e-mail
today, confirming a report in WirtschaftsWoche.  “The business models of our industry -- especially in new
areas such as cloud services -- depend on the trust of customers
in the digital world,” said Philipp Blank, a spokesman for the
Bonn-based company. “This trust has suffered badly. The onus is
on governments when it comes to curbing espionage by their
allies. But telecommunication companies can also play a role.”  Germany  and the U.S. are in talks on an agreement not to
spy on each other after the German government faced criticism
over the extent of its cooperation with the U.S. National
Security Agency in the gathering of information on German
citizens, following revelations from former NSA contractor
Edward Snowden.  “For us, it’s extremely annoying that after four months we
still don’t know to what extent foreign secret services conduct
surveillance on German Internet and telephone communications,”
Blank said.  The company’s proposal to maintain traffic within national
boundaries could later be expanded to countries within the
Schengen Zone, he said, referring to the European Union’s
passport-free area.  To contact the reporter on this story:
