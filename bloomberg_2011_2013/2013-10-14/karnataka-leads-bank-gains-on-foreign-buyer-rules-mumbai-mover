Karnataka Bank Ltd. (KBL)  and  Lakshmi
Vilas Bank Ltd. (LVB)  led mid-sized lenders higher in Mumbai trading
after central bank Governor Raghuram Rajan was cited as saying
foreign lenders may be allowed to buy Indian peers.  Karnataka Bank jumped 15 percent to 107.15 rupees at 12:02
p.m., set for the biggest one-day gain since July 2005. Lakshmi
Vilas gained 16 percent to 75.25 rupees and  South Indian Bank (SIB) 
rose 9.1 percent to 21.5 rupees.  Planned new rules for units of foreign lenders are part of
a drive by Rajan, who took office last month, to strengthen
India’s financial industry. Other measures include making it
easier for banks to curb soured loans and lend to non-state
sectors. The S&P Bankex Index has lost 15 percent this year on
rising bad debt and falling profit as the economy slows.  “Small and mid-sized banks will gain further as the change
in rules by the RBI makes them acquisition targets,” Nitin Kumar, a Mumbai-based banking analyst at Quant Broking Ltd.,
said by phone. “With foreign banks forming local units and the
central bank giving new banking permits there will be a big
enough number of buyers.”  The central bank will publish within weeks the rules for
foreign banks to set up local subsidiaries, which might be
allowed to buy Indian lenders, the Press Trust of  India  today
cited Rajan as saying. The banking regulator is working on
issuing new permits, Rajan said Sept. 20.  To contact the reporter on this story:
