U.S. stocks pared losses as the
White House said the president and vice president will meet with
congressional leaders this afternoon, spurring optimism that a
deal will be reached to lift the debt ceiling.  President  Barack Obama  and Vice President Joe Biden will
meet with congressional leaders at 3 p.m. in  Washington , the
White House said in statement. Obama will make clear the need
for Congress to act to pay nation’s bills and reopen the
government, the statement said.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index was down 0.1 percent at
