Ndamukong Suh has become a regular
contributor to National Football League charities.  The Detroit Lions’ defensive tackle had a $100,000 fine for
a Sept. 8 low block upheld on Oct. 11 after an appeal before
retired Baltimore Ravens center Matt Birk, according to the
 Associated Press . Suh has been fined $177,500 since he joined
the league in 2010, according to the  Detroit Free Press .  The NFL has collected about $4 million in fines each of the
previous four years and donates the money to charitable
programs, including the NFL Player Care Foundation and the NFL
union’s Players Assistance Trust, which help downtrodden players
get back on their feet.  Fining players has been effective in changing behavior
across the league. The fines are supposed to increase 5 percent
annually, according to the NFL’s collective bargaining
agreement, but the minimum fines this season remained at 2012
levels because the players seem to be adjusting to the rules,
NFL spokesman Mike Signora said in an interview.  The number of fines declined 32 percent from 2009 to 2012,
Signora said, dropping to 451 from 668. Meanwhile, fines for
illegal hits on quarterbacks fell to 61 from 114, or 46 percent,
over the same period.  John Lynch , a former Tampa Bay Buccaneers safety and Fox
Sports analyst, said he sees “players making an effort” and
that changes in the CBA calling for an independent judge to
review appeals has made the system fairer.  “It used to be that no one believed this was a truly
independent arbitrator; the league was judge and jury,” Lynch
said in a telephone interview. “Maybe it’s become a little more
independent and when they get people in there like Matt Birk,
who many of them have played against, they trust the system
more. Matt has overturned fines. You have a fighting chance.”  Minimum Fines  Some minimum fines for first-time offenders are: physical
contact with an official, $26,250; horse collar tackle, $15,750;
hitting a defenseless player, $21,000; fighting, $26,250; and
excessive profanity, $10,500. Minimum penalties double for a
second offense.  Suh, a two-time Pro Bowl selection who was the No. 2
overall pick in the 2010 draft from the  University of Nebraska ,
was suspended two games his second season after he stomped on
the arm of a Green Bay Packers player, and was forced to make a
public apology. He was fined three times by the league before
the ban and met with NFL Commissioner  Roger Goodell  to discuss
how to better play within the rules.  The $100,000 fine had been the largest against a player for
an on-field violation. It was matched Sept. 18 when Birk
overturned Tampa Bay Buccaneers safety Dashon Goldson’s one-game
suspension for spearing and replaced it with a similar fine.  DeBartolo Fine  The NFL’s largest fine against an individual was in 1999,
when former San Francisco 49ers owner Edward DeBartolo was fined
$1 million for his involvement in a gambling-fraud case. New
England Patriots coach  Bill Belichick  was fined $500,000 in 2007
after his team broke NFL rules by videotaping the  New York  Jets’
signals during a game. The Saints were fined the same amount in
2012 in connection for what the league determined to be a bounty
program rewarding big hits.  Tennessee Titans owner  Bud Adams  was fined $250,000 in 2009
for making obscene hand gestures during a win over the  Buffalo
Bills . Former All-Pro  Ray Lewis  also was fined $250,000, for
obstructing an investigation into a double murder following a
post-Super Bowl fight outside an Atlanta night club in January
2000.  To contact the reporter on this story:
