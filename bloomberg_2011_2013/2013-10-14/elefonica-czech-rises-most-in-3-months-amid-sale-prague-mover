Telefonica Czech Republic AS jumped
the most in 20 months after the majority owner of the country’s
largest phone company was said to plan the sale of its stake.  The shares surged 6.6 percent, the most since February
2012, to 323 koruna by the end of trading in  Prague  today,
valuing the unit at 104 billion koruna ($5.5 billion). More than
1 million securities changed hands, almost triple the three-month daily average. The stock was the best performer on the 13-member  PX (PX)  equity index, which rose 0.4 percent.  Spain’s  Telefonica SA (TEF)  hired Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and
Societe Generale SA to help find a buyer for its 69 percent
holding in the Prague-based unit, according to three people
familiar with the matter, who asked not to be identified because
the talks are confidential. Representatives for Telefonica SA,
Goldman Sachs and Societe Generale declined to comment.  “The share gains are driven by speculation that, if the
sale does take place, the new owner will try to buy out minority
stakes,”  Josef Nemy , an analyst at Komercni Banka AS, wrote in
e-mailed comments. “Should the search for a buyer take more
time, the Spanish company may push for an exceptionally high
dividend payout.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
