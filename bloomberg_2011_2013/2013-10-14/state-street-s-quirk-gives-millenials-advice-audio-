 Alison Quirk, executive vice 
president at State Street and the sole woman on State Street's 
executive board, says millennial women should be sure to make 
career choices that open up options. Quirk says it's important 
for young women to be open-minded and not make choices before it
is necessary. Quirk talks with Bloomberg's  Kathleen Hays  and 
Vonnie Quinn on Bloomberg Radio's "The Hays Advantage," joined 
by  Bentley University  President Gloria Larson. Bentley 
University is a strategic partner of Bloomberg Radio. The 
interview took place on Oct. 11.   (Source: Bloomberg)  Running time 07:20
