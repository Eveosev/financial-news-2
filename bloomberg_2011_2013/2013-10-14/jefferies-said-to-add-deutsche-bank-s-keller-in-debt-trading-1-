Jefferies Group LLC, the New York-based investment bank, hired Robert Keller from  Deutsche Bank AG (DBK) 
as a managing director to trade investment-grade credit,
according to three people with knowledge of the matter.  Keller departed Deutsche Bank’s New York office last week,
said the people, who asked not to be identified because the move
hasn’t been announced. Richard Khaleel, a spokesman for
Jefferies, said he couldn’t comment, as did Deutsche Bank
spokeswoman Amanda Williams and Keller when reached on his
mobile phone.  Jefferies has boosted its assets almost 10-fold and more
than tripled its staff to about 3,800 since Richard Handler
became chief executive officer in 2001. In March, the firm was
 acquired  by New York-based  Leucadia National Corp. (LUK) , its largest
shareholder.  The investment bank has focused its hiring in fixed-income,
luring traders and salespeople from Wall Street’s biggest
lenders. It added high-yield bond trader Brian Zucker in
September, who was previously at Barclays Plc, according to
records maintained by the Financial Industry Regulatory
Authority. Ex-Deutsche Bank credit salesman Michael Curry joined
in April as a managing director.  Keller spent almost nine years at Merrill Lynch & Co., then
a year at Jefferies before leaving in 2010 for Deutsche Bank,
where he was a managing director in corporate-bond trading.  Companies have sold $922.2 billion of investment-grade
bonds in the U.S. this year, up from $888.7 billion by this time
in 2012, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
