The UAW Chrysler Health Care Trust
said its assets grew by $1.58 billion last year, more than half
of which came from the rising value of its Chrysler holding.  The trust’s net assets grew by 18 percent in 2012 to $10.3
billion, according to its 2012 financial statement, filed Oct.
11. Almost $900 million of the gain resulted from an increase in
the value it placed on its Chrysler stake. Expenditures for
benefits rose less than 0.1 percent to $631.1 million.  Sergio Marchionne , chief executive officer of Chrysler and
majority owner  Fiat SpA (F) , has spent four years trying to merge
the companies. Fiat filed for an initial public offering of
Chrysler shares last month at the behest of the trust. The two
sides are sparring over the value of the trust’s 41.5 percent
stake, listed as $3.6 billion in the 2012 filing.  Marchionne valued the stake at $1.7 billion in July, when
the trust said it had increased to $4.2 billion. Matt Wood, a
spokesman for the trust, and Katie Merx, a Chrysler spokeswoman,
declined to comment on the filing.  Health-care trusts for retirees from  General Motors Co. (GM)  and
 Ford Motor Co. (F)  also reported increases in net assets, a reversal 
after the three funds showed losses for 2011. Chrysler’s trust, 
organized as voluntary employee beneficiary plan, or VEBA, had 
lost $733.6 million a year earlier. Its liabilities more than 
doubled last year to $349.6 million.  Since 2009  The trust received its stake in  Auburn Hills , Michigan-based Chrysler as part of the automaker’s 2009 bankruptcy to
help pay for the medical benefits of Chrysler’s union retirees.
The trust covered the medical benefits for 61,214 people at the
end of 2012, according to its 2012 financial statement.  The GM UAW retiree health-care trust ended 2012 with almost
$30 billion in net assets, 5.8 percent increase from the
beginning of the year, according to records filed with the U.S.
Department of Labor on Oct. 11. The trust completed 2012 with a
net income of $1.65 billion compared with a $4.7 billion loss in
2011.  In September, Detroit-based GM said it plans to buy back
almost half of the trust’s preferred shares in the automaker for
$3.2 billion.  The Ford UAW retiree health care trust ended 2012 with
$15.9 billion in net assets, a 5.4 percent increase from the
beginning of the year, according to its filing. The trust ended
the year with net income of $806.8 million compared with a $973
million loss in 2011.  To contact the reporter on this story:
