Taiwan ’s five-year bonds advanced
the most in more than a week as a drop in local equities amid
concern about a possible U.S. default prompted investors to seek
safety in sovereign debt.  The benchmark Taiex stock index fell 0.8 percent, this
month’s biggest decline , as U.S. lawmakers struggled to agree
on raising the nation’s borrowing limit before the Oct. 17
deadline, when the country risks a debt default. The world’s
largest economy is the second-biggest export market for Taiwan.  “The market is a little risk-off today,” said  Albert Lee ,
a bond trader in Taipei at Cathay United Bank Co. “The stocks’
fall is due to the U.S. problem. That’s why yields are down.”  The yield on the 1.25 percent debt due October 2018 dropped
two basis points, or 0.02 percentage point, to 1.16 percent as
of 10:55 a.m. in Taipei, according to Gretai Securities Market.
That’s the biggest decline since Oct. 2.  The  Taiwan dollar  rose 0.30 percent to NT$29.395 against
its U.S. counterpart, based on prices from Taipei Forex Inc.
One-month implied volatility, a measure of expected moves in the
 exchange rate  used to price options, increased five basis points
to 3.78 percent.  The monetary authority has sold the local dollar in the
run-up to the close on most days since March 2012, according to
traders who asked not to be identified.  The  overnight interbank lending rate  was little changed at
0.388 percent, according to the Taiwan Interbank Money Center.  To contact the reporter on this story:
