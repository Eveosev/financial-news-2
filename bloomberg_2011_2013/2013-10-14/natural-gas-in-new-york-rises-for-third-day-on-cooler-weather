Natural gas futures dropped in  New
York  for the first time in four days on speculation that cold
weather in the central U.S. won’t be enough to eliminate a
surplus of the heating fuel.  Gas fell 0.8 percent as Commodity Weather Group LLC in
Bethesda,  Maryland , predicted below-average temperatures in the
Midwest from Oct. 20 through Oct. 24 and normal readings on the
East Coast. Gas inventories totaled 3.577 trillion cubic feet in
the seven days ended Oct. 4, 1.6 percent above the five-year
average, Energy Information Administration data show.  “Even if we have a cold front, we’ll have plenty of
supply,” said  Phil Flynn , a senior market analyst at Price
Futures Group in  Chicago . “The market is a little bit
overextended and traders have been overplaying the cold
weather.”  Natural gas for November delivery fell 3 cents to settle at
$3.79 per million British thermal units on the  New York
Mercantile Exchange . Trading volume was 11 percent above the
100-day average at 2:44 p.m. Prices have advanced 13 percent
this year. The futures reached $3.82 per million Btu yesterday,
the highest settlement price since June 20.  The discount of November to December futures narrowed 0.1
cent to 14.5 cents. November gas traded 23.7 cents  below  the
January contract, compared with 23.9 cents yesterday.  Goldman Recommendation  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. ended its recommendation to buy
November $4.20 calls, said Samantha Dart, senior energy
economist at the bank in  London , in a note to clients today. The
trade has lost about 30 cents since Goldman suggested it in
April, the bank said in the report.  January $3.05 puts were the most active options in
electronic trading. They were 0.1 cent lower at 0.6 cent per
million Btu on volume of 870 at 2:44 p.m. Puts accounted for 44
percent of trading volume. Implied volatility for November at-the-money options was 31.63 percent at 2:45 p.m., compared with
31.88 percent yesterday.  Year-on-year gas  production  growth was 1.3 billion cubic
feet a day from April to August, compared with 0.4 billion a day
in the first quarter, driven by rapid increases from the
Marcellus shale formation in the U.S. Northeast, Dart said in
the report. The supply gains contributed to lower-than-forecast
gas prices, she said.  Marketed gas output may climb 1.2 percent this year to a
record 70 billion cubic feet a day, the EIA said Oct. 8 in its
monthly Short-Term Energy Outlook. The agency increased its
estimate from 69.91 billion a day forecast in September.  Energy Needs  The U.S. met 87 percent of its own energy needs in the
first six months of 2013, on pace to be the highest annual rate
since 1986, according to the EIA.  The EIA ceased operations on Oct. 11 and will remain closed
for the duration of the government shutdown. Data releases,
including the weekly gas inventory report, will not be
published.  The low in Chicago on Oct. 20 may be 41 degrees Fahrenheit
(5 Celsius), 3 less than average, according to  AccuWeather Inc. 
in  State College ,  Pennsylvania . The low in New York may be 49
degrees, matching the normal temperature.  About 49 percent of U.S. households use gas for heating,
EIA data show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
