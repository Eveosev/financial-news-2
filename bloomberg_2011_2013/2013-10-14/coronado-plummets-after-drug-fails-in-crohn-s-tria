Coronado Biosciences Inc. (CNDO)  plummeted
as much as 70 percent after its lead product candidate for the
inflammatory bowel condition known as Crohn’s disease failed to
meet the goals of a study.  Coronado  plunged  65 percent to $2.01 at 9:50 a.m.  New York 
time, after declining to $1.73 in the biggest intraday drop
since the shares began trading in November 2011. The stock
gained 28 this year through Oct. 11.  The mid-stage trial found Burlington, Massachusetts-based
Coronado’s drug TSO, or trichuris suis ova, failed to improve
patient response or send Crohn’s into remission any better than
placebo, the company said in a statement today. TSO was safe and
well tolerated and patients taking the drug and the placebo
reported abdominal pain as the most-common adverse event. The
trial evaluated 125 patients on TSO and 125 who took a placebo.  Coronado will further analyze data from the study and is
awaiting data from another trial “to identify the most
appropriate development path for TSO,” Chairman and Chief
Executive Office Harlan Weisman said in the statement.  The results from the second study conducted by Dr. Falk
Pharma GmbH, Coronado’s development partner, are expected in the
fourth quarter, Coronado said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
