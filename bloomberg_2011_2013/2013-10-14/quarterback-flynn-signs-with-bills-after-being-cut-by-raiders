The Buffalo Bills signed quarterback
Matt Flynn, one week after he was released by the Oakland
Raiders.  Flynn was sacked seven times, fumbled twice and threw an
interception that was returned for a touchdown against the
Washington Redskins on Sept. 29, his lone start of the season.  Flynn, 28, played for the Green Bay Packers as a backup to
Aaron Rodgers from 2008 to 2011. After he threw for 480 yards
and six touchdowns in the Packers’ 2011 season finale, both
franchise records, he signed with the Seattle Seahawks on a
three-year, $19.5 million contract. Seahawks rookie Russell Wilson won the starting job in preseason and Flynn was traded to
Oakland in April.  In six NFL seasons, Flynn has completed 62.3 percent of his
passes for 1,329 yards and 10 touchdowns, with six
interceptions.  The Bills placed defensive back Jonathan Meeks on injured
reserve for at least six weeks to make room on the roster for
Flynn, the team said in a statement.  Thad Lewis played quarterback in Buffalo’s 27-24 overtime
loss to Cincinnati yesterday. The Bills are without rookie
starter EJ Manuel, who sprained his right knee on Oct. 3.  To contact the reporters on this story:
