The Texas Municipal Retirement
System is investing $250 million in bank loans as it shifts
money from equities and bonds.  Highland Capital Management LP will invest the money for
the fund in senior secured bank debt and collateralized loan
obligations, said Mark Okada, co-founder and chief investment
officer of the Dallas-based  investment adviser . Highland, which
manages $17.7 billion of assets, will target large, liquid,
high-quality loans, Okada said.  “The floating rate nature of  bank loan /CLO debt coupons is
particularly attractive in the current low yield environment
where the risk is exposure to higher  interest rates ,” Bill
Wallace, director of communications of Texas Municipal, wrote in
an Oct. 11 e-mail.  Highland announced it was selected Oct. 8, after the
retirement fund’s board of trustees approved a search for
managers  June 19  to invest as much as $2 billion in bank loans,
CLOs, emerging-market debt and mortgage-backed securities,
according to meeting minutes. The $2 billion, equal to about 10
percent of the Austin, Texas-based pension fund’s $21.3 billion
of assets, was shifted from passive equity and core fixed-income
allocations, according to  March  meeting minutes.  “A lot of conservative pension plans like Texas Municipal
have a lot of bond exposure,” Okada said in an Oct. 9 telephone
interview. “Now those bonds that have been performing extremely
well for them are the problem, especially if rates are going to
be rising.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
