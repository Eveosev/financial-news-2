Pace Plc (PIC)  rose the most in more than
two months after  Netflix Inc. (NFLX)  was said to be in talks to add TV
subscription-streaming services to set-top boxes of U.S. cable-television operators.  Pace supplies set-top boxes to pay-TV operators, and  North
America  accounted for 55 percent of its $2.4 billion  revenue 
last year. The Saltaire, England-based company’s stock gained as
much as 5.2 percent, the biggest intraday rise since July 30.  Netflix, the largest subscription-streaming service, has
had discussions with U.S. cable companies including  Comcast
Corp. (CMCSA)  and Time Warner Cable Inc., according to people familiar
with the matter, who asked not to be named because the talks are
private. The talks suggest cable operators increasingly see
Netflix’s $7.99 monthly service as a tool to attract and retain
customers, rather than a threat.  “Pay-TV operators seem to be getting a bit less political
about allowing such over-the-top services to be bundled on their
set-top boxes” and this will benefit Pace,  Lee Simpson , an
analyst at Jefferies LLC in London, said by phone today. Simpson
recommends buying the stock and has a 12-month price target of
338 pence on the shares.  Pace was up 3.4 percent at 271 pence as of 2:05 p.m. in
London trading, taking the advance to 44 percent this year and
giving the company a market value of about 850 million pounds
($1.36 billion).  The Wall Street Journal reported Netflix’s discussions with
Comcast and Suddenlink Communications yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
