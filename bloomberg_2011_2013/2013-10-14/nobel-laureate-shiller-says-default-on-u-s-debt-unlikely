Robert J. Shiller, who shares the
2013  Nobel Prize  in Economic Sciences, said he doesn’t expect
the U.S. government to default on its debt and doesn’t foresee
any long-term market consequences from the current impact over
raising the nation’s borrowing limit.  “I’m thinking probably nothing big is going to happen,”
Shiller said at a press conference at  Yale University , where he
is a professor of economics. “It should be OK. We still have in
this country a sense of cooperation that will emerge and prevent
a default.”  Shiller, who shares the 2013 prize with  University of
Chicago  economists  Eugene Fama  and Lars Peter Hansen, said
“this crisis will likely be resolved. We won’t see a default.
Even if we do it will be for one day or something and even if
it’s longer, it’s not the end of the world.”  Any resulting plunge in markets would most likely be
temporary, Shiller said. Recalling the market reaction after a
similar crisis in 2011, he said, “the market may drop 7 percent
in one day and come back up.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
