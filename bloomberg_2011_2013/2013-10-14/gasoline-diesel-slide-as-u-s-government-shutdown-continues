Gasoline and diesel slid as the U.S.
government shutdown extended to a 14th day with no Congressional
agreement to end the fiscal impasse or raise the debt limit.  Futures fell as the Oct. 17 deadline looms to increase the
credit limit or risk default, threatening the economy and
ultimately fuel demand. Trading volumes were below average as
banks closed for the U.S. Columbus Day holiday.  “You’ve got a bank holiday and there’s not a lot of buying
coming in,” said  Phil Flynn , senior market analyst at Price
Futures Group in Chicago. “There’s a growing sense of unease as
we get closer to the debt-ceiling deadline.”  Gasoline for November delivery fell 2.66 cents, or 1
percent, to $2.6415 a gallon at 10:02 a.m. on the  New York
Mercantile Exchange  on trading volume that was 31 percent below
the 100-day average.  The congressional deadlock over increasing the U.S. debt
ceiling from $16.7 trillion is threatening the U.S. and world
economies, said International Monetary Fund Managing Director
 Christine Lagarde .  “If the market doesn’t see any positive signs they’re
doing something, we’ll just be grinding lower,” said  Gene McGillian , an analyst and broker at Tradition Energy in
 Stamford ,  Connecticut .  The motor fuel’s  crack spread  versus WTI narrowed 56 cents
to $9.48 a barrel. The  premium  to Brent fell 2 cents to 76 cents
a barrel.  Pump prices , averaged nationwide, slipped 0.1 cent to
$3.343 a gallon, 45.1 cents below a year ago, Heathrow, Florida-based AAA said today on its website.  Ultra-low-sulfur diesel for November delivery declined 1.76
cents, or 0.6 percent, to $3.0173 a gallon on trading volume
that was 12 percent below the 100-day average.  ULSD’s  premium  versus WTI narrowed 15 cents to $25.30 a
barrel. The  crack spread  over Brent rose 31 cents to $16.50.  To contact the reporter on this story:
