Georgia  regained access to Russian
markets for its fruit, vegetable and nut exports, seven years
after its northern neighbor banned the produce, according to the
Black Sea country’s National Food Agency in Tbilisi.  Russian inspectors have carried out sanitation checks in
Georgia, Giga Kurdovanidze, a spokesman for the agency, said
today by phone from the capital, Tbilisi.  Prime Minister Bidzina Ivanishvili, a Russian-trained
economist and engineer, promised to improve political and
business ties between the countries following his upset election
victory in October over the party of President Mikhail Saakashvili.  Russia  has also lifted a ban on wine and mineral
water imports from the former Soviet republic.  “Almost all types of Georgian agricultural products are
now being allowed into Russia,” Alexei Alekseenko, a spokesman
for Russian regulator Rosselkhoznadzor, said today by phone from
Moscow. “We haven’t yet agreed on persimmon and kiwi
shipments.”  Relations between Russia and Georgia deteriorated after
Saakashvili’s election in 2004. Russia imposed the ban on
Georgian wine,  mineral water  and agricultural products in 2006,
following the expulsion of four of its soldiers accused of
spying, and closed transportation links. In 2008, Russia routed
the Georgian army in a war over  South Ossetia , and Russia
recognized the two regions’ sovereignty.  Apples, pears, citrus, grapes and hazelnuts have been
cleared for export to Russia, with more to come, Kurdovanidze
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
