Tenergy Trading sold Russian Urals
crude in the Mediterranean at a smaller discount than the
previous trade, while Total SA failed to sell the blend in
northwest  Europe . There were no  North Sea  grades traded with
bids and offers made for all four benchmark crudes.  Ineos Group Holdings SA today began shutting down the
Grangemouth petrochemical plant because of a worker strike, the
company said on its website. A full closure of the site,
including the refinery, may halt crude flows in the Forties
Pipeline System.  North Sea  Trafigura Beheer BV didn’t manage to buy Forties crude at a
higher premium than last week. The company bid for Nov. 5 to
Nov. 9 at 35 cents a barrel more than Dated Brent, according to
a Bloomberg survey of traders and brokers monitoring the Platts
pricing window. That compares with a trade at a 30-cent premium
on Oct. 11.  Mercuria Energy Trading SA was looking to buy Nov. 7 to
Nov. 9 Forties at 20 cents more than Dated, while BP Plc bid for
Nov. 6 to Nov. 10 at a 30-cent premium.  Royal Dutch Shell Plc withdrew an offer to sell either
 Brent crude  for Oct. 26 to Oct. 28 at Dated Brent plus 20 cents,
or Forties for Oct. 30 to Nov. 1 at plus 30 cents.  Statoil ASA offered two Oseberg cargoes at lower levels
than last week. It sought to sell one lot for Oct. 31 to Nov. 2
at $1.30 a barrel more than Dated Brent, and another for Nov. 3
to Nov. 5 at plus $1.65, according to the survey. That’s 25
cents and 30 cents less, respectively, than its offer Oct. 11.  Statoil was unable to sell Ekofisk loading Oct. 28 to Oct.
30 for a third time since Oct. 10, even as the company lowered
its offer to $1.00 a barrel more than the benchmark, 30 cents
less than its last offer on Oct. 11, the survey showed.  Brent for November settlement traded at $110.11 a barrel on
the ICE Futures Europe exchange at the close of the window,
compared with $110.67 from the previous session. The December
contract was at $109.32, a discount of 79 cents to November.  Flaring of gases at Grangemouth is taking place ahead of a
planned 48-hour strike on Oct. 20, Ineos said on its website.
The company and U.K. labor union Unite met today with
conciliation service ACAS to avert the strike, the union said.
The site powers the Forties Pipeline System to which over 80
offshore  oil fields  are connected. About 390,000 barrels a day
of Forties is due to load this month, October  shipping plans 
obtained by Bloomberg News show. That equates to about 40
percent of the U.K.’s North Sea oil output.  The Kinneil oil and gas processing plant may fully resume
today, according to three people with knowledge of the
maintenance, asking not to be identified because the information
is confidential. Partial maintenance, which has put restrictions
on offshore output, was last due to finish on Oct. 11 to Oct. 12
from a previous restart target of Oct. 1.  Urals/Mediterranean  Tenergy sold 80,000 metric tons of Urals to OAO Lukoil for
Oct. 31 to Nov. 4 loading at a discount of 55 cents a barrel to
Dated Brent delivered to Augusta,  Italy . That’s 35 cents higher
than the last trade on Oct. 8.  Total failed to sell 100,000 tons of Urals for Oct. 24 to
Oct. 28 at Brent minus $1.45 delivered to Rotterdam, the survey
showed. That is unchanged from a bid by Gunvor Group for the
same dates on Oct. 3.  PKN Orlen bought 100,000 tons of Urals for delivery to the
Butinge terminal in Lithuania on Oct. 28 to Nov. 1 from China
International United Petroleum & Chemical Corp., also known as
Unipec, according to two people who participate in the market,
asking not to be identified because the information is
confidential  Exports of Azeri Light from  Georgia ’s Black Sea port Supsa
will remain stable in November at four cargoes of 600,000
barrels each, a loading program obtained by  Bloomberg News 
showed.  West Africa  A 28-inch line on the Trans Niger Pipeline has been closed
because of a fire, days after it was opened on Oct. 9, Shell Plc
said today in an e-mailed statement. Force majeure on Bonny
Light exports remain, it said.  Vitol offered 950,000 barrels of Nigerian Qua Iboe at a
premium of $3.80 to Dated Brent for loading in December. A two
day loading window must be nominated by Nov. 8, according to the
survey.  Indian Oil Corp. bought one cargo each of Qua Iboe, EA and
Usan crudes from Vitol, three people who participate in the
market said, asking not to be identified because the information
is confidential. The company also bought one lot of Angolan
Palanca from Vitol and Nigerian Okwuibome from GlencoreXstrata
Plc. The cargoes are 1 million barrels each and will load in
December, the people said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
