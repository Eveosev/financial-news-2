Assured Guaranty Ltd. (AGO)  and  MBIA
Inc. (MBI) ’s municipal insurance unit are sufficiently capitalized for
any losses on municipal debt from Puerto Rico and Detroit,
according to Standard & Poor’s.  Assured has a capital cushion of $450 million to $500
million against exposure of $5.5 billion and MBIA’s National
Public Finance Guarantee Corp. has $350 million to $400 million
versus exposure of $5.3 billion, S&P credit analysts Marc Cohen
and David Veno in New York wrote in a report dated today. That’s
consistent with a BBB rating, or two levels above speculative
grade, they wrote.  To contact the reporter on this story:
