China’s benchmark stock  index  rose
to a one-month high as railway companies surged on speculation
they may help build Thailand’s high-speed train system,
offsetting data showing lower exports and faster inflation.  CSR Corp. (601766)  and  China CNR Corp. (601299) , the nation’s biggest train
makers, jumped by the 10 percent daily limit.  China Vanke Co. (000002) 
and  Poly Real Estate Group Co. (600048)  slid at least 2.5 percent after
the China Securities Journal said the government may accelerate
the establishment of long-term controls on the property market.  The  Shanghai Composite Index (SHCOMP)  advanced 0.4 percent to
2,237.77 at the close, the highest level since Sept. 12.
Thailand’s prime minister said China showed interest in
developing the Southeast Asian country’s high-speed train
system. China’s consumer  prices  rose 3.1 percent in September,
exceeding the median estimate in a Bloomberg survey, while
exports unexpectedly fell 0.3 percent.  “It’s an event-driven sentiment on the railway stocks,”
said Wu Kan, a Shanghai-based  money manager  at Dragon Life
Insurance Co., which oversees $3.3 billion. “The government is
now also adopting a ‘going out’ strategy for the railway
industry to boost competitiveness.”  The Shanghai Composite has climbed 15 percent from its
four-year low on June 27. The benchmark index trades at 8.9
times projected earnings for the next 12 months, compared with
the five-year average of 12.6 times, data compiled by Bloomberg
show. Trading volumes for index companies were 11 percent higher
than the 30-day average today.  CSR Jumps  The CSI 300 Index added 0.2 percent to 2,472.54. Hong
Kong’s exchange is shut for a holiday. The Bloomberg China-US
Equity Index, the measure of the most-traded U.S.-listed Chinese
companies, rose 0.9 percent in  New York  on Oct. 11.  CSR and China CNR both rose to the highest level on a
closing basis since June 3. China Railway Group Ltd. jumped 9.9
percent, the biggest gain since October 2010.  China Railway Construction Corp. (601186) , builder of more than half
the nation’s rail links since 1949, climbed 9 percent to 5.43
 yuan  after saying it won a project worth about 20 billion yuan
($3.27 billion) to build infrastructure and public projects on
the southern island province of Hainan.  China showed interest in developing Thailand’s high-speed
train system and Thailand wants to partially pay China with
agricultural products, Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra told
reporters after talks with Chinese Premier  Li Keqiang  in Bangkok
on Oct. 11.  Developers Drop  Vanke, the nation’s biggest listed property developer, fell
2.5 percent to 9.20 yuan. Poly Real Estate dropped 2.7 percent
to 9.90 yuan, while  China Merchants Property Development Co. (000024) 
slid 3.3 percent to 24.17 yuan.  The housing ministry will study property markets in cities
such as Chengdu in the near term, signaling acceleration of the
establishment of a system for long-term property controls, the
China Securities Journal reported, citing unidentified people.  The 3.1 percent increase in China’s consumer price index
compared with the 2.8 percent median estimate of 44 economists
in a Bloomberg survey, after a 2.6 percent gain in August. The
decline in the producer-price index narrowed to 1.3 percent from
1.6 percent the previous month.  The drop in China’s  exports  trailed all 46 estimates in a
Bloomberg News survey, while imports rose a more-than-forecast
7.4 percent.  The government is scheduled to publish third-quarter gross
domestic product figures on Oct. 18. The economy probably
expanded 7.8 percent from a year earlier, according to a
Bloomberg survey, up from the second quarter’s 7.5 percent pace.

Bank of China are due today or tomorrow.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
