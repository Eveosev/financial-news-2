Allegheny Technologies Inc. (ATI) , a
supplier of specialty metals to  Boeing Co. (BA) , said third-quarter
earnings were curbed by lower shipments and prices.  Excluding its tungsten-materials business, which is being
sold, Allegheny will post a loss of 27 cents to 30 cents a share
for the period, the Pittsburgh-based company said today in a
statement. Sales, excluding tungsten, were about $970 million,
it said.  Jet-engine manufacturers continued to reduce inventories in
the quarter, hurting demand for metal components, Chairman and
Chief Executive Officer Rich Harshman said in the statement.
Global economic uncertainties affected demand for the company’s
flat-rolled products while margins on stainless-steel products
were squeezed by higher raw-material costs, he said.  Allegheny also said that after completing a strategic
review, it closed its fabricated-products business and decided
to sell its iron-casting unit. As a result, it will take a $9
million pretax charge in the third quarter, largely comprising a
writedown on asset, the company said.  Kennametal Inc. (KMT)  agreed in September to buy Allegheny’s
tungsten-materials unit, which makes counterweights and
industrial alloys, for $605 million. Allegheny said today it
expects the deal to close in the fourth quarter.  Allegheny dropped 1.8 percent to $30.37 at 10:07 a.m. in
 New York . The company is scheduled to report third-quarter
earnings on Oct. 23.  To contact the reporter on this story:
