Hypermarcas SA (HYPE3) , the maker of
consumer products from diapers to generic drugs, rose to the
highest in two years after Credit Suisse Group AG named the
stock its only buy among Brazilian consumer companies.  The shares jumped 2.3 percent to 19.84 reais at 1:30 p.m.
in  Sao Paulo . A close at that level would be the highest since
May 2011. The  Ibovespa (IBOV)  benchmark gained 0.7 percent.  Credit Suisse started coverage of 10 Brazilian consumer
stocks, and the Sao Paulo-based consumer-health products
manufacturer was the only one with a rating the equivalent of
buy, analyst Tobias Stingelin wrote in a research note to
clients today. Hypermarcas is poised to benefit from its line of
relatively inexpensive staple products that will remain in
demand while other companies that depend on more discretionary
spending face a “tougher” outlook over the next 12 to 18
months, according to the report.  “After over two years of zero M&A activity and a clear
focus on improving its operations, we believe Hypermarcas
provides an attractive alternative to play the Brazilian
consumer sector,” he wrote. “Cash flow and earnings growth are
largely dependent on measures under management’s control that
have been implemented already.”  Hypermarcas made 15  acquisitions  from 2009 to 2011,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. There have been no
acquisitions since then, the data show.  Credit Suisse set a 12-month price target of 23 reais for
the shares, according to the research note, 16 percent higher
than today’s price.  To contact the reporter on this story:
