Delek Drilling-LP (DEDRL)  climbed to the
highest in almost a year amid increased speculation about the
viability of exports as new discoveries are made in the region.  The  shares (AVNRL)  increased 2.2 percent to 14.36 shekels, the
highest level since Jan. 13.  Avner Oil Exploration LLP (AVNRL) , Delek’s
partner in gas sites off the coasts of Israel and Cyprus, jumped
2.7 percent to 2.47 shekels, the highest since April 27.  Noble Energy Inc. (NBL) , a partner of Delek Drilling and Avner,
said Dec. 28 a field off the coast of Cyprus may hold as much as
8 trillion cubic feet of natural gas. Noble operates the well
with a 70 percent working interest, while Delek and Avner Oil
each hold 15 percent.  “The more the gas discoveries, the higher the chances for
the viability of the construction of a liquified-natural gas
plant for the area that will enable exports,” Richard Gussow, a
Tel Aviv-based analyst at Deutsche Bank AG in Tel Aviv said by
phone. The size of the find “improves the chances for finding
further discoveries for all the gas companies.”  Ratio Oil Exploration 1992 LP (RATIL)  surged the most since Nov.
13, gaining 5.9 percent to 0.344 shekel.  Isramco Negev 2 LP (ISRAL)  rose
2.8 percent, the most since Dec. 5, to 0.483 shekel.  To contact the reporter on this story:
