India ’s government will allow
overseas individual investors to directly buy local equities as
the country seeks to boost capital inflows and reduce volatility
in the stock market.  The new rule from the central bank and stock market
regulator is expected to take effect by Jan. 15, the government
said in an e-mailed statement today. Currently, individual
investors can only invest in Indian shares through so-called
participatory notes.  The move has been anticipated since October 2010 when a
Finance Ministry official, who declined to be identified at the
time, said the change was being considered. R. Gopalan,
secretary of economic affairs at the Finance Ministry, confirmed
this on Nov. 15.  The new rule will “widen the class of investors, attract
more foreign funds, and reduce market volatility,” as well as
deepen the Indian  capital market , the government said in its
statement.  Foreign investors (FIINDRGP)  pulled out $495.5 million from
India’s equities last year, compared with a record inflow of
$29.4 billion in 2010, data from the exchange regulator show.  The benchmark  BSE India Sensitive Index (SENSEX)  dropped 25 percent
in 2011 as foreign investors sold shares on concerns that a
slowdown in the U.S. and  Europe ’s debt crisis may erode company
profits already threatened by the most aggressive interest-rate
increases among major Asian economies.  To contact the reporter on this story:
