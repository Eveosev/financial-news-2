The euro may become the world’s
leading currency in a decade,  Christian Noyer , European Central
Bank governing council member, said in an interview with the
French weekly  Journal du Dimanche .  The euro already has become the second-leading reserve
currency after the U.S. dollar, the newspaper said, citing
Noyer. If countries in Europe apply the decisions made in
Brussels in December, the zone will emerge stronger, Noyer said,
according to the newspaper.  To contact the reporter on this story:
