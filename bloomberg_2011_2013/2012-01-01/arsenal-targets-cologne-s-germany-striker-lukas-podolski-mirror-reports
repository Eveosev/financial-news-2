Arsenal wants to bolster its
attacking options during this month’s transfer window with a
move for Cologne’s Germany striker Lukas Podolski,  the Daily
Mirror reported.   Podolski is keen to move to the Premier League soccer club
and Cologne is prepared to sell for 12.5 million pounds ($19.4
million), the newspaper said, without citing anyone.  Podolski, who has scored 14 league goals this season, has
reportedly fallen out with Cologne’s Director of Sport Claus
Horstman, the Mirror said.  Arsenal has already agreed to re-sign striker  Thierry Henry 
on a two-month loan from Major League Soccer’s New York Red
Bulls as cover for Marouane Chamakh and Gervinho, who depart for
the African Cup of Nations later this month.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
