Findus Foods, maker of frozen food
and Young’s Seafood, asked lenders to waive a quarterly covenant
test at the end of 2011 which determines how it’s able to meet
its debt obligations, the Sunday Times reported, without saying
where it got the information.  The company is trying to renegotiate more than 700 million
pounds ($1.09 billion) of loans it owes to banks and other debt
providers, the paper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
