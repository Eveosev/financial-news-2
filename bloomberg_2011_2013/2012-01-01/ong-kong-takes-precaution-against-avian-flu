Hong Kong suspended poultry imports
from the area in southern  China  where a man died from the H5N1
bird flu virus, according to a  statement  posted today on the
region’s Centre For Food Safety website.  The import of live, chilled and frozen poultry along with
eggs from the Chinese city of Shenzhen, where the man died, will
be suspended for 21 days, according to the statement.  The ban covers a 13-kilometer (8-mile) radius around the
man’s home, it said.  Hong Kong began culling more than 17,000 birds last month
after the bird flu virus was found in a chicken carcass at a
local wholesale market.  Avian flu is a serious public health concern with the
potential to cause a deadly pandemic, the Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention says. Since 2003, more than 500 people
have been infected with the H5N1 strain worldwide and about 60
percent have died, according to the Atlanta-based agency.  To contact the reporter on this story:
