Turkey ’s biggest risk in 2012 will be
financing its current-account deficit, not slowing growth,
according to Ergun Ozen, chief executive of  Turkiye Garanti
Bankasi AS (GARAN) , the state-run Anatolia news agency said.  Financial resources will decrease due to Europe’s debt
crisis, Anatolia cited Ergun as saying.  Turkish banks will struggle to maintain profitability in
2012 after government and central bank moves to slow credit
growth, raise reserve ratio requirements and cap fees and
commissions on some banking products, Ergun said, according to
Anatolia.  Turkey has 125 bank branches per one million citizens
compared with a euro zone average of 560 branches per million,
Ergun was quoted as saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
