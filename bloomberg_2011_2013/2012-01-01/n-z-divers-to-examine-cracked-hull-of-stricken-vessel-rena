Divers will examine the cracked hull
of a Greek-owned container ship stranded on a reef off
northeastern  New Zealand ,  according to maritime officials.  The stricken Rena is “now effectively in two pieces”
though it remains grounded on the reef and may still be joined
underneath,  Maritime New Zealand  said in an e-mailed statement
today. Divers will probably examine the hull today once weather
and sea conditions improve, according to the statement.  About 1,700 metric tons of  fuel oil  were aboard Athens-
based Costamare Shipping Co.’s vessel when it ran aground on
Oct. 5 near Tauranga, 100 miles (160 kilometers) southeast of
Auckland. An estimated 350 tons leaked into the ocean,
blackening beaches and killing seabirds, while 1,000 tons has
been pumped to a tanker moored alongside.  To contact the reporter on this story:
