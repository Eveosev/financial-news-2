Israeli and Palestinian negotiators
said they will meet this week in Jordan for the first time in
more than a year.  Israel’s chief negotiator Yitzhak Molcho and his
Palestinian counterpart,  Saeb Erakat , will get together Jan. 3
as part of a meeting hosted by Jordan of the so-called Middle
East Quartet, which is comprised of the U.S., Russia, the
European Union and the  United Nations .  “The meeting will take place in Amman on Tuesday,” Erakat
said in a telephone interview. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office issued an e-mailed statement confirming
Molcho’s attendance.  The two sides have not met since September 2010, when peace
talks broke up over the issue of construction in West Bank
Jewish settlements. Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas has since ruled out any formal negotiations unless Israel
freezes settlement-building, which Netanyahu has declined to do.  To contact the reporter on this story:
