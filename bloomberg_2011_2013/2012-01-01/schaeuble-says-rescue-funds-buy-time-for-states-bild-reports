German Finance Minister  Wolfgang Schaeuble  said indebted euro-area countries must use aid from
other  member states  to regain confidence in their finances,
Bild-Zeitung reported, citing an interview with the minister.  “The rescue mechanisms can only buy time for the affected
member states to take the necessary measures to win back
confidence,” the Berlin-based newspaper cited Schaeuble as
saying. “The states must use this time to consolidate their
budgets, to save and implement the necessary reforms to
strengthen their ability to compete.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
