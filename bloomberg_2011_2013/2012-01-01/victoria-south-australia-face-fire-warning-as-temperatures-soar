Southwestern parts of the Australian
state of Victoria face an extreme risk of bush and grassfires
today as temperatures surge as high as 40 degrees Celsius (104
degrees Fahrenheit), authorities said.  The  Country Fire Authority  banned residents in four
districts from lighting fires in the open air all day, and said
conditions there are extreme or severe, the second- and third-
highest levels on the danger scale. The remainder of the
southeastern state, while not under a ban, also faces the risk
of bushfires, according to the CFA’s website.  Melbourne , the state capital, will see temperatures as high
as 40 degrees Celsius, the  Bureau of Meteorology  said on its
website.  South  Australia ’s Country Fire Service issued a severe fire
danger warning for parts of the state as temperatures rise to
the low 40s, and relative humidity falls to below 10 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
