Iran  has “successfully” produced
its first nuclear fuel rod, the official  Islamic Republic News
Agency  said, citing the country’s atomic energy agency.  The first domestically made rod has already been inserted
into the core of Tehran’s research nuclear reactor after passing
“all physical tests in operational conditions,” IRNA cited the
agency as saying.  Nuclear fuel rods contain pellets of enriched uranium that
provide fuel for nuclear  power plants .  To contact the reporter on this story:
