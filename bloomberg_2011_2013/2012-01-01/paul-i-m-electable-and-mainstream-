U.S. Representative  Ron Paul  of  Texas 
dismissed criticism from Republican presidential rivals that his
views are outside the U.S. political mainstream, saying he is
“pretty electable.”  “I was elected 12 times once people got to know me in my
own congressional district,” Paul said today on CNN’s “State
of the Union.” “I would say that I’m pretty mainstream. I
think the people who are attacking me now are the ones who can’t
defend their records and they’ve been all over the place.”  The libertarian-leaning congressman said his Republican
rivals are too tepid in their approach to shrinking the federal
budget and deficit, while he would make dramatic cuts.  “I don’t see any actual cuts,” he said of the spending
plans put forward by his rivals during an interview airing this
weekend on Bloomberg Television’s “Political Capital with  Al
Hunt .”  Paul has predicted he’ll either win or finish second in the
Jan. 3 Iowa Republican caucuses that start the 2012 nominating
contests.  Editors: Gail DeGeorge, James Tyson  To contact the reporters on this story:
