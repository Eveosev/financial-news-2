Peruvian consumer prices rose 4.7
percent in 2011, the fastest pace in three years, the national
statistics agency said.  Inflation was forecast to accelerate to 4.8 percent last
year, according the median estimate of nine analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg. Prices increased 0.27 percent in December from the
previous month, compared with an estimate of 0.3 percent.  Inflation, which outpaced the central bankâ€™s target range
of 1 to 3 percent, was spurred by fuel prices, which jumped 14
percent, and food and clothing, which increased 8 percent and
4.8 percent, respectively, the agency said yesterday in an e-
mailed statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
