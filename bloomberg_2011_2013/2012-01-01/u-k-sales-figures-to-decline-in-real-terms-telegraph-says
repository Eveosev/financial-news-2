U.K. December retail figures will
probably show a real decline in sales even after shoppers
flocked to snap up pre-Christmas discounts, the Sunday Telegraph
reported, citing the  British Retail Consortium .  December sales figures are likely to show a modest increase
in cash terms as compared with December 2010 though they wonâ€™t
beat the impact of inflation, the Telegraph reported, citing the
BRC.  To contact the reporter on this story:
