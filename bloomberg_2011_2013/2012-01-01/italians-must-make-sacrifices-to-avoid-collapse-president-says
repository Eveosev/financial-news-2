Italians will have to make sacrifices
to avoid financial collapse and must keep faith in  Europe ,
President Giorgio Napolitano said in a New Year’s  speech .  “Nobody, today -- no social group -- can stall on the
commitment to contribute to the revival of public accounts to
avoid the financial collapse of  Italy ,” Napolitano said in his
televised speech late yesterday. “The sacrifices won’t be
useless. Only united can we progress and count as Europeans in a
radically changed world.”  A crisis that began in  Greece  has spread within the euro-
area and leaders are struggling to convince investors they can
contain the risk and assure the euro’s survival. German
 Chancellor Angela Merkel  said in a speech yesterday she expects
turbulence in 2012 and will do “everything” to save the euro
and end Europe’s sovereign debt crisis.  Greek Prime Minister  Lucas Papademos  said in an e-mailed
statement that his country faces a “difficult” year and must
continue its efforts to remain in the euro and avoid economic
collapse.  Italy must fight corruption and tax evasion, Napolitano
said, adding his country had no future without regeneration of
the political system.  “We all need to understand that for a long time the State,
grew too much and spent too much, ending up imposing heavy taxes
on honest contributors and placing a serious mortgage on the
shoulders of future generations,” the Italian President said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
