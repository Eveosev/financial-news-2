A majority of French say the  euro  has
been a handicap since 2008 though they would oppose abandoning
the single currency, according to a poll.  The survey of 901 people on Dec. 29 and Dec. 30 by Ifop for
the Journal du Dimanche found that 52 percent of those polled
said the euro has been a handicap during the past three years,
while 64 percent opposed abandoning the euro in favor of
returning to the French franc.  To contact the reporter on this story:
