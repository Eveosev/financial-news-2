A dedicated U.K. police unit will be
set up to target illegal betting and attempts to bribe athletes
at this year’s  Olympic Games  in  London , the Sunday Times said,
citing Olympics Minister Hugh Robertson.  The unit, led by the Metropolitan Police, will work with
the Serious Organised Crime Agency and Interpol to monitor any
suspicious gambling activity, the Times said.  “You cannot underestimate the threat this poses because
the moment that spectators start to feel that what they are
seeing is not a true contest, that is when spectators stop
turning up and the whole thing turns to pieces,” Robertson told
the newspaper. “At some stage over the next two or three years,
we will have some other sort of betting scandal in some sport. I
just hope it’s not at the Olympics.”  Robertson said spot-fixing, in which certain elements
within a contest are fixed rather than the outcome of a match,
is the biggest threat for this year’s games. He said “illegal
betting syndicates on the Indian sub-continent and elsewhere”
are the main focus.  Three Pakistan cricketers were jailed in November after
being convicted of accepting corrupt payments to cheat in a Test
match against  England  at Lord’s cricket ground in London  in
2010.  Former captain Salman Butt and fast bowlers  Mohammad Asif 
and Mohammad Amir were caught in an undercover sting by defunct
U.K. tabloid The News of the World for plotting to bowl no-balls
during the match.  To contact the reporter on this story:
