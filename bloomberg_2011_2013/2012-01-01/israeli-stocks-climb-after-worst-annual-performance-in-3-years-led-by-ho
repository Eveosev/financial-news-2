Israel’s  benchmark stock index (TA-25) 
climbed the most in a week, after the worst annual performance
in three years, on speculation declines were overdone.  Hot Telecommunication System Ltd. (HOT) , the country’s second-
largest fixed-line operator, posted its biggest gain since Dec.
26 as Clal Finance Brokerage Ltd. raised its recommendation on
the shares.  Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. (TEVA) , the world’s
largest generic drugmaker, rose 1.4 percent. The TA-25 Index
climbed 1.3 percent, the most since Dec. 25, to 1,099.19 at the
4:30 p.m. close in  Tel Aviv . The benchmark index fell 2.5
percent on Dec. 29, bringing the drop for the year to 18
percent.  “The magnitude of Thursday’s weakness was a little
surprising,” said Saar Golan, a trader at Clal Finance in Tel
Aviv. “We’re just seeing end of year, beginning of year
volatility. The next few days will have most fund managers
planning their strategies for 2012.”  Israel ’s benchmark tumbled in 2011 after economic growth
slowed as the European debt crisis crimps demand for exports,
which account for almost 40 percent of gross domestic product.
Concern that uprisings in Arab nations would raise security
threats in the region and local protests over the cost of living
would reduce companies’ revenue also pushed shares lower.  The  economy (ISGSANNY)  probably grew 4.8 percent in 2011, the Central
Bureau of Statistics said Dec. 29. The Bank of Israel last week
cut its 2012 growth estimate to 2.8 percent from 3.2 percent.  Hot Upgrade  Hot Telecommunication  climbed (HOT)  1.4 percent to 48.05 shekels.
The company  was raised (HOT)  to “buy” from “outperform” at Clal as
analyst Tsahi Avraham said Hot’s share of the telecommunications
market will increase.  Teva advanced the most since Dec. 18 to 155.50 shekels. The
pharmaceutical maker is shipping its generic version of
GlaxoSmithKline Plc’s Combivir for HIV in the U.S. The drug will
generate “two to three cents in earnings per share in the next
180 days,” Jonathan Kreizman, an analyst at Clal, said Dec. 29.  The yield on the benchmark 5.5 percent bonds due January
2022 fell three basis points to 4.5 percent, the lowest since
the notes were sold in April. The inflation-linked bond due June
2013 rose for the first time in five days, pushing the yield
down 7 basis points to 0.72 percent, the lowest since Dec. 26.  Shares in  Saudi Arabia , the world’s biggest oil exporter,
declined before the start of the earnings season later this
month. The benchmark  stock index , the  Tadawul All Share Index (SASEIDX) ,
lost 0.5 percent to 6,386.04 at the close in  Riyadh . The measure
declined 3.1 percent in 2011, it’s first drop since 2008.  Oman’s benchmark (MSM30)  stock index, the only other Arab market
tracked by Bloomberg that was open today, gained 0.2 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
