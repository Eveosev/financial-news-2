The New York Jets’ chances of a third
straight trip to the  National Football League ’s playoffs were
snuffed out by a 19-17 loss in Miami. The  Denver Broncos  and
Cincinnati Bengals took the American Football Conference’s
final two postseason spots even after losses.  The regular season wraps up tonight with the  New York
Giants  hosting the  Dallas Cowboys  at MetLife Stadium in East
Rutherford,  New Jersey . The winner advances to the playoffs as
the National Football Conference East champion. The losing
team’s season is over.  The Jets’ campaign ended at 8-8 after the Dolphins scored
13 straight fourth-quarter points to erase a 10-6 deficit at Sun
Life Stadium in Miami. Jets quarterback Mark Sanchez threw three
interceptions, the final one with 2 minutes, 55 seconds left
after  New York  had reached Miami’s 10-yard line.  “We played well in spurts this season, just not well
enough consistently,” Sanchez, who had 26 touchdowns and 18
interceptions this year, said at a news conference. “I’ve got
to play better to win. I can’t throw it to them three times.”  The Jets, who reached the American Football Conference
championship game the previous two seasons, entered the final
week of the regular season needing a win and losses by three
other teams to qualify for the playoffs.  The Bengals lost to the Baltimore Ravens 24-16, yet earned
the AFC’s final wild card berth with a 9-7 record because of
losses by the Jets, Broncos and Oakland Raiders.  Backing Into Playoffs  Although the Broncos were beaten 7-3 by the Kansas City
Chiefs, they won the AFC West because of Oakland’s 38-26 loss to
the  San Diego Chargers . Denver, Oakland and  San Diego  all
finished 8-8 in the division, with the Broncos taking the title
because they held the third tiebreaker advantage -- the best
record against common opponents.  “It’s obviously a little bittersweet right now,” Broncos
quarterback  Tim Tebow , who completed 6-of-22 passes for 60 yards
and an interception, said at a news conference. “We’d like to
have a little better momentum going into the playoffs. But it’s
still very special.”  The  New England Patriots  clinched the No. 1 seed in the AFC
and home-field advantage throughout the playoffs with a 49-21
win over the Buffalo Bills. Tom Brady passed for 338 yards and
three touchdowns as the Patriots scored 49 straight points to
rally from a 21-0 deficit.  Ravens Get Bye  The Ravens clinched the AFC North, No. 2 seed and a first-
round bye as  Ray Rice  rushed for 185 yards and two touchdowns in
their victory in Cincinnati.  While Baltimore and Pittsburgh finished 12-4 in the
division, the Ravens won both regular-season meetings,
relegating the Steelers to the No. 5 seed in the AFC and an
opening-round road playoff game in Denver. The Steelers capped
the regular season with a 13-9 win over the  Cleveland Browns .  The  San Francisco  49ers earned a bye in the first round of
the playoffs by beating the St. Louis Rams 34-27 to wrap up the
No. 2 seed in the NFC. Michael Crabtree caught two touchdown
passes for the 49ers, who finish the regular season with a 13-3
record.  The New Orleans Saints also finished 13-3 after beating the
Carolina Panthers 45-17, but will be the NFC’s No. 3 seed
because San Francisco held the tiebreaker advantage.  Drew Brees passed for 389 yards and five touchdowns as the
Saints set a record for total offensive yards in a season,
breaking the mark that was held by the 2000  St. Louis Rams .
Brees also eclipsed Peyton Manning’s record for completions in a
season, a week after breaking Dan Marino’s 27-year-old mark for
single-season passing yards.  Brady Passes 5,000 Yards  Brees finishes the season with 5,476 passing yards, while
the Patriots’ Brady amassed 5,235, becoming the third
quarterback in NFL history to surpass the 5,000-yard milestone.  The  Indianapolis Colts  locked up the No. 1 overall pick in
the 2012 NFL draft with a 19-13 loss to the Jacksonville Jaguars.
The Colts and Rams finish the season with 2-14 records, though
Indianapolis holds the strength-of-schedule tiebreaker advantage
for the top pick.  Stanford University quarterback Andrew Luck is projected by
draft analysts to be the No. 1 pick. Manning, a four-time NFL
Most Valuable Player, sat out this season after having neck
surgery as the Colts finished with their worst record since
going 1-15 in 1991.  The  Green Bay Packers  outscored the Detroit Lions 45-41 as
backup quarterback Matt Flynn threw his sixth touchdown pass of
the game with 1:10 remaining.  Flynn Leads Packers  Flynn finished with 480 passing yards while starting in
place of  Aaron Rodgers  for the Packers (15-1), who beat the
Lions for the 21st straight time at Lambeau Field and prevented
Detroit from clinching the NFC’s No. 5 playoff seed. The Packers
are the NFC’s top seed and will play at home throughout the
playoffs.  Matt Stafford passed for 520 yards and five touchdowns for
the Lions (10-6), who had previously locked up their first
playoff berth since 1999. The loss means the Lions, as the sixth
seed, will face the Saints in the opening round.  The  Atlanta Falcons  (10-6) gained the NFC’s No. 5 seed with
a 45-24 rout of the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. Julio Jones and
Michael Turner each had two touchdowns as the Falcons raced out
to a 42-0 first-half lead. Atlanta will meet the NFC East winner
on the road in the opening round of the playoffs.  The Tennessee Titans beat Houston 23-22 as the Texans
failed to convert a two-point conversion after scoring a
touchdown with 19 seconds left. The Titans, who finished 9-7,
had their playoff chances end when the Broncos lost.  The Texans (10-6) already had the AFC’s No. 3 playoff seed
locked up and will host the Bengals in the first round.  Dolphins Comeback  In Miami, the Jets opened a 10-3 first-half lead before the
Dolphins mounted their comeback.  Trailing 10-6, the Dolphins took the lead for good with
10:27 remaining on a one-yard touchdown run by Charles Clay. The
go-ahead score capped a 21-play, 94-yard drive that took 12:29
off the clock.  Dan Carpenter then added a pair of field goals for Miami,
the second one coming with 2:32 left after Sanchez threw his
third interception of the game. Sanchez threw a scoring pass to
Patrick Turner with 1:24 left to pull the Jets within 19-17 and
the Dolphins were able to run out the remaining time on the
clock after recovering New York’s onsides kick.  The Jets allowed nine points off turnovers to push their
NFL-leading total to 126 this season.  The  Chicago Bears  beat the Minnesota Vikings 17-13, the
 Philadelphia Eagles  defeated the Washington Redskins 34-10 and
the Arizona Cardinals beat the Seattle Seahawks 23-20 in
overtime in games between teams out of playoff contention.  To contact the reporter on this story:
