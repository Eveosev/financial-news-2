South Korea  forecast a rapid slowing
of exports this year as Europe’s debt crisis threatens the
global economy. The government said shipments increased more
than economists expected in December.  Export growth will probably slow to 6.7 percent this year,
from 19.6 percent in 2011, the Ministry of  Knowledge Economy 
said today in a statement. Overseas  shipments (KOEXTOTY)  rose 12.5 percent
last month compared with a year earlier, it also said. The
median estimate in a Bloomberg News survey of 11 economists was
for a 6.3 percent gain in December.  Europe’s debt crisis is cutting export demand and North
Korea’s leadership change threatens confidence by adding to the
risk of instability on the Korean peninsula. The economy faces
“substantial” downside risks, the  Bank of Korea  said on Dec.
29, pledging to focus policy efforts on stable prices and
“sound” growth.  “Worries over a quicker slowdown are rising,” Lee Sang Jae, a senior economist at Hyundai Securities Co. in  Seoul , said
before the release. The central bank may keep  interest rates  on
hold as it grapples with “a slowing economy and persistent
inflation pressures,” he said.  The won rose 0.3 percent to 1,151.82 per dollar in Seoul on
Dec. 29, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The benchmark
Kospi stock index gained 0.03 percent. South Korean financial
markets were closed on Dec. 30.  Export value rose to $49.7 billion last month from $46.5
billion in November, today’s report showed. Imports climbed 14
percent to $45.7 billion, and the nation recorded a trade
surplus of $4 billion.  Asia ’s fourth-largest economy expects exports to increase
to $595 billion in 2012, yielding a trade surplus of $25 billion,
the ministry said today.  To contact the reporters on this story:
