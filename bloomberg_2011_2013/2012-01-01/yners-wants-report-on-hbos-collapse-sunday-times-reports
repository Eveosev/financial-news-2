Paul Myners , a former Treasury
minister who oversaw the bailout of U.K. banks, called on the
nation’s securities regulator to publish a report on the
collapse of HBOS Plc, the Sunday Times reported.  A detailed account of the bank’s demise was the minimum a
taxpayer should expect, Myners was quoted as saying by the
newspaper.  To contact the reporter on this story:
