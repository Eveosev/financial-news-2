A.P. Moeller-Maersk A/S, owner of the
world’s largest container line, said Chief Executive Officer
Nils Smedegaard Andersen has undergone emergency heart surgery.  Andersen “has, unwittingly, had a leak in one of his  heart
valves , caused by either an infection or a weakness,” the
Copenhagen-based company said in a statement today. “During a
vacation in Switzerland his condition deteriorated acutely, and
therefore he has undergone surgery which comprised replacement
of a cardiac valve. The operation went well. Nils S. Andersen is
expected to be absent for about one month, and the doctors are
expecting a full recovery.”  Andersen, 53, was admitted to hospital in Switzerland on
Dec. 30, the statement said.   To contact the editor responsible for this story:
