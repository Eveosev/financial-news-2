Capula Investment Management LLP, a
hedge-fund firm in  London , paid its founder a 27-million-pound
($42 million) dividend this year, the Sunday Times reported,
citing company accounts.  Yan Huo, who co-founded Capula in 2005, banked the payment
as part of a 92-million-pound bonus pool shared between the
companyâ€™s 18 top executives in the year to March 31, 2011, the
paper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
