Shares in  Saudi Arabia , the world’s
biggest oil exporter, declined the most in more than two weeks
before the start of the earnings season later this month.  The country’s benchmark stock index, the  Tadawul All Share
Index (SASEIDX) , lost 0.5 percent, the most since Dec. 13, to 6,386.04 at
the 3:30 p.m. close in  Riyadh . The measure declined 3.1 percent
in 2011, it’s first drop since 2008.  Saudi Basic Industries
Corp. (SABIC) , the world’s biggest petrochemicals maker, fell for a
second day. Banque Saudi Fransi, a lender part-owned by Credit
Agricole SA, retreated 0.7 percent.  “The Tadawul is expected to trade in a tight range over
the next two days with no clear lead locally,” said Samer Darwiche, an equity analyst at Gulfmena Investment in Dubai.
“Investors are waiting for fourth-quarter announcements” and
there is a lack of global catalysts as international markets are
closed for the New Year’s holiday.  The kingdom’s gauge declined less than 0.1 percent
yesterday. Saudi Basic may report a 35 percent increase in
 fourth-quarter profit (SABIC)  on Jan. 18, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  Banque Saudi Fransi (BSFR)  may announce results on Jan. 11.
EFG-Hermes Holdings SAE expects net income at the bank of 781
million riyals ($208 million) after 709 million riyals in the
year-earlier period, according to data on Bloomberg.  Saudi Basic, which has the heaviest weighting on the index,
dropped 0.5 percent to 95.75 riyals. Banque Saudi Fransi
declined to 41.8 riyals.  Oman’s benchmark stock index, the only other Arab market
tracked by Bloomberg that is open today, gained 0.2 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
