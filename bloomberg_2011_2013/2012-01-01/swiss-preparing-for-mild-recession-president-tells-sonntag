Switzerland is making plans to
“stabilize” the nation’s economy if there is a recession this
year,  Der Sonntag  said, citing an interview with Finance
Minister Eveline Widmer-Schlumpf.  “We’re operating on the presumption that we could move
into a mild recession,” Widmer-Schlumpf, who is also the
country’s president, told the newspaper. “We are in the process
of drawing up measures to be put in place if we find ourselves
in a situation similar to 2008 or 2009.”  The minister said she expects a tax dispute with the U.S.
to be resolved in 2012, Der Sonntag reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
