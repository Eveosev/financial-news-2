Egypt  agreed to export 2,072 metric
tons of cotton in the week-ended Dec. 29, the Alexandria Cotton
Exporters Association said in its weekly bulletin.  The country has shipped 27,276 metric tons of cotton valued
at $97.3 million since the marketing year began on Sept 1. Of
last week’s sales, Egypt will ship 1,650 tons of Giza 88 cotton
variety, and 422 tons of Giza 86, the association said today.  Egypt produces the world’s finest extra-long staple cotton,
which is stronger and softer than shorter staple cotton, and is
used in high-end clothing. Switzerland, Bangladesh and  India  are
the largest importers of Egyptian cotton.  To contact the reporter on this story:
