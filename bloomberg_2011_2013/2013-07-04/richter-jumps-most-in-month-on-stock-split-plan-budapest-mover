Gedeon  Richter Nyrt .,  Hungary ’s
biggest drugmaker, jumped the most in a month on speculation a
planned 10-1 split in the stock’s face value this month will see
the company returned to  MSCI Inc. (MSCI) ’s index for the country.  The shares rose 2 percent to 34,630 forint by 11:05 a.m. in
Budapest, the strongest gain since June 7. Volume was about half
of the three-month average. Richter led a 0.9 percent advance in
the benchmark BUX stock  gauge .  Richter plans to complete the reduction in face value to
100 forints ($0.44) from 1,000 as of July 16, according to a
 statement  to the Budapest Stock Exchange today. The split, which
is happening earlier than expected, may help increase trading
volume, analysts at Erste Group Bank AG and Equilor Befektetesi
Zrt. said in research reports today.  “The news is a positive surprise because earlier the
company said this move would only happen sometime in the fall,”
analysts at Erste including Jozsef Miro in Budapest wrote in
their note.  Higher volumes may help Richter return to MSCI’s basket of
Hungarian equities, the Erste and Equilor analysts said. Richter
fell to a 6-month low in November before it was dropped from the
index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
