Six  UBS AG (UBSN)  bankers left the investment banking unit in Japan, said two people familiar with the situation, and the Swiss firm hired seven people for equities in the world’s best-performing major stock market.  The investment bankers -- four managing directors and two executive directors -- left the Japan unit this week, said the people, who asked not to be identified. Seven were hired for Japan equity sales and trading, according to an internal memo obtained by  Bloomberg News . Jason Kendy, a Tokyo-based spokesman for UBS, confirmed the contents of the document.  UBS joins  Bank of America Corp. (BAC)  in boosting Japan equity operations to compete with firms including  Nomura Holdings Inc. (8604)  on the back of Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s economic stimulus efforts. At the same time, the Zurich-based company is among banks worldwide that have announced at least 100,000 job cuts in the past year amid stricter regulations that make their business less profitable, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  “It’s getting harder for foreign banks to keep an edge in investment banking in Japan as domestic brokerages and lenders are becoming more competitive by offering lower fees,” said Tetsuya Sakabe, managing director at Kanae Associates Ltd., an executive-search firm specializing in the financial industry.  Eiko Noda, a Tokyo-based spokeswoman for UBS, declined to comment on the departures.  Global Cuts  The bankers who left covered telecommunications, media and technology, consumer and financial institutions as well as  equity capital markets  and merger advisory businesses, the people said. Switzerland’s biggest bank released plans last year to eliminate 10,000 jobs worldwide as it shrinks its  investment banking  arm to focus on  wealth management .  HSBC Holdings Plc (HSBA) , Commerzbank AG and Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc have signaled job reductions since May, as rules including stricter  capital requirements  and limits on trading dent profitability.  Barclays Plc (BARC) , Deutsche Bank AG and Credit Suisse Group AG had their credit ratings lowered by Standard & Poor’s this week as regulations and “uncertain market conditions” threaten their business. S&P affirmed UBS’s ratings.  The Swiss firm’s reduced headcount in Japan investment banking comes before Goldman Sachs Group Inc.’s Junya Nishiwaki joins the firm on Aug. 23 as a managing director and head of the corporate client solutions division. Nishiwaki, a graduate from the University of Cambridge, will oversee business including advising on mergers and acquisitions.  Equity Recruits  UBS hired Philip Denham from  Citigroup Inc. (C)  as head of cash trading in Japan and Seth Moran from Barclays Plc for sales trading business, while Takayuki Inoue also joined from UBS’s asset management unit, according to the memo. The bank also hired three sales staff for Japan equities and one person for execution services.  Japan’s  Topix Index (TPX)  has climbed 36 percent this year on optimism on the prime minister’s policies of fiscal stimulus, monetary easing and structural reforms -- known as Abenomics -- will beat deflation, weaken the yen and boost economic growth.  “Global investors still focus on Japanese stocks because of Abenomics, so it’s a bold decision for UBS to return to the classic business,” Sakabe said.
