Statkraft SF,  Europe ’s biggest
hydropower producer, is boosting capacity and trading in  Turkey 
to offset falling demand and profitability in western Europe.  Higher prices in Turkey make trading more attractive and
plants more profitable than in Europe, according to Claus
Urbanke, Oslo-based Statkraft’s head of new markets. Day-ahead
power in Turkey cost  70 percent more  on average than in Germany
in May, according to Bloomberg calculations using data from
Turkish day-ahead market PMUM and the EPEX Spot exchange.  European utilities from EON SE to CEZ AS are entering new
markets as the euro area’s longest recession cut German power
demand to a 10-year low. Electricity use has risen more than 15
percent since 2010 in Turkey, where Statkraft is currently
building two hydro plants, compared with a 2.5 percent drop in
Europe’s biggest economy.  “Turkey could surpass  Germany  as a power market by 2020
and is a good opportunity for us to make up for shrinking
markets at home,” Urbanke said in an interview in Dusseldorf.
“Turkey has a large potential for hydro power along with very
good growth in demand over the past 10 years, which we expect to
continue in the coming years.”  Day-ahead electricity sold for an average of 55.43 euros
($72.04) a megawatt-hour in May on PMUM. That compares with
32.56 euros for Germany on the EPEX Spot exchange.  A boost in  solar generation  in Germany has reduced prices
during daylight hours, when demand is at its highest. The
 premium  of next-month power for delivery in the 12 hours from 8
a.m. over the around-the-clock contract in Germany has shrunk to
an average 8.94 euros a megawatt-hour this year, according to
broker data compiled by Bloomberg. That compares with a mean of
11.38 euros in the four years through 2012.  Spark Spread  Next-year profit for German gas-fired plants, known as the
spark spread, has traded below zero since January 2012,
according to Bloomberg calculations. The measure dropped to a
record minus 18.55 euros a megawatt-hour on June 17 and was at
minus 17.96 euros today, the data show.  “The price differences in Turkey are more pronounced and
the generally higher prices make this market more attractive,”
Urbanke said on June 6.  Statkraft has one 20-megawatt hydropower  plant  in Cakit,
southern Turkey, that supplies about 32,000 households,
according to its website. The company plans to start a 102-megawatt plant in Kargi in the north in 2014 and a 517-megawatt
unit in Cetin in the southeast in 2016, Urbanke said.  Turkey’s economy is expected to grow 4 percent this year,
compared with an increase of 0.4 percent in Germany and a 0.6
percent contraction in the euro area, according to Bloomberg
News surveys of economists.  Gas Plants  Power use in Turkey rose to 242 terawatt-hours last year
from 210 terawatt-hours in 2010 according to a Statkraft
presentation. German consumption last year fell to 595 terawatt-hours, the lowest since 2003, from 610 terawatt-hours in 2010,
according to AG Energiebilanzen e.V., an association of energy
lobbies and economic research institutes.  In 2012, Turkey produced around 44 percent of its power
from natural gas-fired plants, according to Statkraft, compared
with 11 percent in Germany.  “Gas power plants are the price setters in the Turkish
market during most hours of the day,” Urbanke said. “That’s
why prices on the wholesale power market in Turkey are
significantly higher than in Germany.”  The Turkish Privatization  Administration  is currently
looking to sell 45 power plants with a total generation capacity
of 16,200 megawatts, including 27 hydro stations, according to
its website.  Statkraft is interested in the plants as it seeks to boost
its power generation capacity in Turkey, Urbanke said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
