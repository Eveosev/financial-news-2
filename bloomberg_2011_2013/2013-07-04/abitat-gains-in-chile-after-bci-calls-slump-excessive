Habitat SA ,  Chile ’s second-largest pension fund manager, rose
the most in six weeks after  Banco de Credito e Inversiones (BCI)  said
its slump in the last three weeks was an overreaction.  Habitat advanced 2.8 percent to 730 pesos at 1:34 p.m. in
Santiago, the biggest gain on a closing basis since May 22. The
IPSA benchmark index rose 0.4 percent.  Santiago-based Habitat’s shares fell 23 percent from June
17 through yesterday. Chilean President Sebastian Pinera said
June 19 in an interview with  Radio Cooperativa  that he will
submit a bill to Congress before his term ends to increase
competition among fund managers and assure higher pensions for
retirees. Chile will hold presidential elections Nov. 17, with
the winner assuming office in March 2014.  “Even as the political uncertainty may remain, there
haven’t been any changes to the company’s cash flow that justify
current prices,” BCI said in a report to clients dated today.
“The market has overreacted, which creates an attractive entry
point.”  Workers in Chile transfer 10 percent of their monthly
salaries to individual  savings accounts  managed by the country’s
pension fund managers, which invest in local and foreign
securities and draw a commission from salaries, according to the
website of Chile’s pension fund regulator.  To contact the reporter on this story:
