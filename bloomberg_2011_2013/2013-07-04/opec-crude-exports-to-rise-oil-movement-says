The Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries will boost shipments by 2.3 percent through
late July as driving demand peaks during the northern hemisphere
summer, according to Oil Movements.  The group that supplies about 40 percent of the world’s oil
will ship 24.18 million barrels a day in the four weeks to July
20, up from 23.64 million in the period to June 22, the tanker
tracker said in an e-mailed report. The figures exclude two of
OPEC’s 12 members,  Angola  and  Ecuador .  “This is it, this is the mid-year peak,”  Roy Mason , the
company’s founder, said today by phone from Halifax,  England .
“It’s the point in the year when refiners, both east and west
of Suez, are looking for crude for the summer season, when
refinery runs hit peak. So that drives demand up.”  Middle Eastern shipments will jump by 2.9 percent to 17.83
million barrels a day, compared with 17.32 million in the month
to June 22, according to Oil Movements. That figure includes
non-OPEC nations Oman and Yemen.  Crude on board tankers will increase by 6.3 percent to
496.01 million barrels versus 466.5 million, data from Oil
Movements show. The researcher calculates the volumes by
tallying tanker bookings. Its figures exclude crude held on
vessels for storage.  OPEC’s members are Algeria, Angola, Ecuador, Iran, Iraq,
Kuwait, Libya, Nigeria, Qatar,  Saudi Arabia , the United Arab
Emirates and Venezuela. It will next meet in Vienna on Dec. 4.  To contact the reporter on this story:
