Banco Nacional de Desenvolvimento
Economico & Social,  Brazil ’s development bank, will spend 210
million reais ($93.4 million) building water tanks to help the
nation’s northeast region combat the worst drought in 50 years.  The funds will go towards construction of 64,000 cisterns
in eight states for low-income families by the middle of next
year, the Rio de Janeiro-based state lender said in a  statement 
on its website. BNDES will provide 126 million reais to install
12,000 tanks in a first phase.  More than 90 percent of the 1,133 municipalities in
Brazil’s semi-arid region, which includes the whole northeast
and the north of Minas Gerais state, have declared a state of
emergency due to water shortages, according to the statement.  The program was created by the Ministry of Social
Development & Fight Against Hunger and state-run oil company
 Petroleo Brasileiro SA (PBR) , according to the statement.  The cisterns will include concrete tanks capable of storing
52,000 liters or pits lined with plastic, BNDES said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
