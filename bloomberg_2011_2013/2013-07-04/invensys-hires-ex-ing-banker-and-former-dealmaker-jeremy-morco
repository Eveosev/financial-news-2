Invensys Plc (ISYS)  said it’s re-hired
Jeremy Morcom to lead its corporate development and acquisitions
strategy after netting more than 1 billion pounds ($1.5 billion)
from the sale of a rail-software business to  Siemens AG. (SIE)   Morcom, who spent about 12 years as an M&A adviser on
industrial deals at ING Bank, will join on Sept. 9, London-based
Invensys said in a statement today. The former  management
consultant  is crossing over from U.K. engineering company
Spectris, where he helped oversee 20 deals worth about $900
million in the past five years.  “Following the sale of Invensys Rail, we have significant
funds to reinvest into our business segments mainly through
acquisitions and his appointment demonstrates our commitment to
deploy these funds in a rigorous and disciplined manner,” Chief
Executive Officer Wayne Edmunds said in the statement.  Siemens paid 1.74 billion pounds for the rail unit, with
Edmunds returning 625 million pounds of that to shareholders.
Invensys’ expansion plans come as it faces the challenge of
maintaining profitability levels, Standard & Poor’s said in a
June report. S&P highlighted a transitory period for the
company, with the likelihood of acquisitions.  To contact the reporter on this story:
