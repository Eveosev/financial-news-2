The dollar strengthened for a second
day against the euro before a U.S. report that analysts said
will show companies added enough jobs to lower the  unemployment
rate , boosting growth prospects for the world’s biggest economy.  The  Dollar Index  advanced to a five-week high amid bets an
improving U.S. economy will prompt the  Federal Reserve  to reduce
monetary stimulus that tends to weaken a currency. The pound
dropped to a three-month low against the dollar on speculation
the  Bank of England  is ready to do more to aid the U.K.
recovery. Norway’s krone fell after a government report showed
manufacturing production dropped more than economists forecast.  “A strong number will fuel expectations for a tapering
sooner rather than later and may also have implications for what
the market expects in terms of the magnitude,”  Henrik Gullberg ,
a currency strategist at Deutsche Bank AG in London, said about
the U.S. payrolls data. “The market to a significant extent is
already positioned for a strong dollar.”  The dollar gained 0.3 percent to $1.2879 per euro at 7:03
a.m.  New York  time after appreciating 0.7 percent yesterday. The
U.S. currency was little changed at 99.99 yen after rising to
100.86 yen on July 3, the strongest since May 31. The euro
declined 0.3 percent to 128.79 yen.  The Dollar Index, which IntercontinentalExchange Inc. uses
to track the greenback against the currencies of six U.S.
trading partners, gained 0.9 percent to 83.986 after rising to
84.04, the highest since May 29.  U.S. Payrolls  The Labor Department will say U.S. companies added 165,000
workers last month after hiring 175,000 in May, according to the
median estimate of economists surveyed by  Bloomberg News  before
the Labor Department report at 8:30 a.m. in Washington. The
jobless rate fell to 7.5 percent from 7.6 percent, a separate
survey showed.  The Dollar Index has gained 4.2 percent since June 18 the
day before Fed Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said policy makers may
start to reduce stimulus this year if the recovery matches the
central bank’s target. The Fed purchases $85 billion of Treasury
and mortgage bonds each month to put downward pressure on
borrowing costs.  The dollar strengthened 7.2 percent this year, the best
performer among 10 developed-nation currencies tracked by
Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes. The yen has tumbled 8.5
percent and the euro advanced 4.4 percent.  The pound weakened for a second day versus the euro after
the Bank of  England , led by newly installed Governor  Mark Carney , signaled yesterday that policy makers will keep rates at
a record low for longer than investors had anticipated.  Carney Impact  “Carney caught the market unawares, he was attempting to
ensure that market expectations remain more focused on the U.K.
economy than on the U.S.,” said Jane Foley, a senior currency
strategist at Rabobank International in London. “He wanted to
draw attention to the fact that the recovery is very nascent,
very fragile. That leaves the pound weaker.”  The pound fell 0.6 percent to $1.4979 after dropping to
$1.4964 the lowest level since March 14. The U.K. currency
declined 0.4 percent to 85.99 pence per euro after depreciating
to 86.33 yesterday, the weakest since April 17.  The krone fell for the first time in three days against the
dollar after  Statistics Norway  said the nation’s manufacturing
production declined 2.1 percent in May from the previous month,
when it gained a revised 2.9 percent.  The Norwegian currency declined 1 percent to 6.1713 against
the dollar and slipped 0.8 percent to 7.9516 per euro.  To contact the reporters on this story:
