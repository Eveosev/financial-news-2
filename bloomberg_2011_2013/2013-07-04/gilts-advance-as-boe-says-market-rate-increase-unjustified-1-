U.K. government bonds rose, reversing
an earlier decline, after the  Bank of England  said an increase
in market rates wasn’t justified and may weigh on the outlook
for growth.  The 10-year  gilt yield  fell four basis points to 2.35
percent as of 12:13 p.m. London time after rising as much as
three basis points earlier today.  “Market interest rates have risen sharply,” the London-based central bank’s Monetary Policy Committee said today in a
statement. “In the committee’s view, the implied rise in the
expected future path of  Bank Rate  was not warranted by the
recent developments in the domestic economy.”  The central bank left its asset-purchase target unchanged
at 375 billion pounds ($567 billion) and kept its benchmark
interest rate at 0.5 percent after today’s policy meeting.  To contact the reporter on this story:
