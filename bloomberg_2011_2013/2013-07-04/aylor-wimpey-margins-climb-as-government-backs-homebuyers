Taylor Wimpey Plc (TW/) , the U.K’s second-largest homebuilder by volume, said first-half profit margin
increased as the government’s Help to Buy loan program lifted
demand for homes.  Operating profit margin in the U.K. was more than 13
percent, up from 11.2 percent a year earlier, the  High Wycombe ,
England-based company, said today in a statement. More than
1,000 customers reserved homes using the government’s Help to
Buy loans and a further 232 are seeking approval, Taylor Wimpey
said.  “We have welcomed signs of significant improvement in the
housing market in the first six months of 2013,” Chief
Executive Peter Redfern said in the statement. “We have seen
increased  consumer confidence , underpinned by both generally
improved access to and affordability of mortgage finance and by
the recent government measures.”  Help to Buy, introduced in March, provides loans of as much
as 20 percent for homes valued at 600,000 pounds ($914,000) or
less. The loans are available at 98 percent of Taylor Wimpey
outlets and have resulted in more visitors, the company said.  The average selling price increased to 187,000 pounds from
176,000 pounds a year earlier. Taylor Wimpey’s order book,
excluding completions and joint ventures, stood at 1.3 billion
pounds at June 30. Net debt fell to about 70 million pounds
from 135 million pounds a year earlier.  To contact the reporter on this story:
