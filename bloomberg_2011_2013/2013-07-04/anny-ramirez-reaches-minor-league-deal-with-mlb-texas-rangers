Manny Ramirez  will begin working out
with  Texas Rangers ’ minor-league affiliate Round Rock tomorrow
after reaching terms of a contract.  Ramirez, 41, won’t be activated for a few days, General
Manager Jon Daniels said on the Triple-A team’s website. He will
be tapped as a designated hitter.  Ramirez retired from baseball in 2011 while with the  Tampa
Bay Rays  rather than face a second unspecified violation tied to
the sport’s anti-doping rules. He also was suspended 50 games in
May 2009 while playing for the  Los Angeles Dodgers .  “We like giving people second chances,” Daniels said.
“We know on-and-off the field the good and the bad of Manny’s
career. We’re inclined to give him an opportunity here.”  During his 19-year career in the majors, Ramirez
batted .312 with 2,474 hits, 1,831 runs batted in and 555 home
runs in 2,302 games.  Ramirez began this year in Taiwan where he hit .352 with
eight home runs and 43 RBIs during 49 games with the Chinese
Professional Baseball League’s EDA Rhinos. He left on June 19.  “We’ll evaluate him as we go,” Daniels said. “No
deadlines, no end dates. If he’s productive and we feel he fits
our culture in the clubhouse, then we’ll give him an opportunity.
If either of those ends don’t pan out, then no harm, no foul.”  Ramirez started last season with the  Oakland Athletics ’
minor-league Triple-A Sacramento before requesting his release
June 15.  To contact the reporter on this story:
