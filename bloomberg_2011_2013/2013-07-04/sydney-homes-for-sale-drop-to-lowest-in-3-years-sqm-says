Homes listed for sale in Sydney,
 Australia ’s most populous city, plunged 23 percent in June from
a year earlier, the lowest level since March 2010, suggesting a
housing shortage, according to  SQM Research Ltd.   The number of properties on the market in Sydney dropped to
23,707, the Sydney-based researcher said in an e-mailed release.
Listings across all major Australian cities fell 5.4 percent
from 12 months earlier.  “We may now be approaching a point where there is a
shortage of residential sale listings in the Sydney market,”
Louis Christopher, managing director at SQM, said in the
release. “This fits with other measurements indicating a
strengthening housing market for that capital city.”  Australia’s housing market is seeing a gradual recovery, as
the central bank’s record-low 2.75 percent benchmark interest
rate helps draw buyers. House and apartment prices in Sydney
jumped 5.6 percent in June from a year earlier, and rose 3.8
percent across all major cities, the  RP Data-Rismark (RPAUMED)  home value
index showed.  While Canberra had the smallest drop in listings from a
year earlier, falling 0.8 percent, the Australian capital had
the second-biggest decline during the month, falling 8.3 percent
from May, SQM said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
