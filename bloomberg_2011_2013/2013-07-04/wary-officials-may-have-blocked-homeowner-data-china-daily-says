China  may have delayed releasing a
national database detailing home ownership because officials
didn’t want their real estate holdings exposed, the  China Daily 
newspaper said in  an editorial today .  The Ministry of Housing and Urban-Rural Development must
finish the database that it had promised to introduce at the end
of June, the editorial said. It will detail home-ownership in
500 cities, according to the newspaper.  The information is a powerful anti-corruption tool because
it will expose officials who own multiple homes, China Daily
said. The editorial said rich people buying multiple homes
raises  home prices  and cuts poorer people out of the market.  “It is widely suspected that the government has missed the
deadline because of opposition from vested interest groups,”
the editorial said. “Admittedly the network-building program is
likely to have been given the cold shoulder by local
governments, as it will make it easier to track how many
properties officials own.”  Allegations of officials investing ill-gotten gains in the
 property market  are widespread. A former bank official from
northwestern China’s Shaanxi province used multiple identities
to acquire 41 properties in Beijing, the city’s police
department reported in January.  No one answered the phone at the Ministry of Housing and
Urban-Rural Development in Beijing when called for comment on
the China Daily editorial today.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
