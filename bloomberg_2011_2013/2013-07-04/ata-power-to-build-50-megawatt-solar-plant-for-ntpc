Tata Power Solar Systems Ltd., a unit
of India’s biggest industrial group, won a contract to build a
solar plant for electricity producer  NTPC Ltd. (NTPC)  as utilities and
manufacturers boost clean-energy investments to meet targets.  Tata will supply solar panels for the 50-megawatt project
and construct the plant at Rajgarh in central Madhya Pradesh
state by March, it said today in an e-mailed statement.  India, beset by blackouts as coal-power stations are idled
for lack of fuel, plans to install 20,000 megawatts of solar by
2022, up from 1,700 megawatts. The new project may help NTPC
meet targets since utilities and industrial energy users are
required to get a portion of their electricity from renewables.  NTPC will double its solar capacity with the project. The
state-controlled utility, which with 41,000 megawatts of total
capacity is  India ’s largest power generator, plans to develop
1,000 megawatts of renewables by 2017, the statement shows.  Tata Power Solar, formerly known as Tata BP Solar Ltd.,
makes panels in Bangalore and has built more than 70 megawatts
of photovoltaic projects as a contractor, according to the
statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
