John Paulson , the billionaire hedge-fund manager seeking to rebound from losses tied to gold and two
years of wrong-way calls on the economy, posted declining
returns in June as markets slumped on the  Federal Reserve ’s
warning that it may phase out stimulus.  Gains in Paulson’s main fund strategies this year were
pared last month after Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said the Fed may
start reducing bond purchases that have fueled gains in
financial markets globally, and end the program in 2014 should
the  U.S. economy  recover as forecast.  Bernanke’s comments rattled investors in stocks, bonds,
commodities and currencies. The MSCI World Index fell 8.4
percent from May 22, when Bernanke told Congress that the
central bank could begin winding down its asset buying, to a
trough on June 24. The Bank of America Merrill Lynch Global
Corporate Index of bonds fell 3.9 percent in the same period.  Paulson Credit Opportunities dropped 3.7 percent last
month, paring its gain for the year to 12 percent, according to
a performance update sent to clients of New York-based Paulson &
Co., which oversees $19 billion.  Paulson Partners Enhanced, a merger-arbitrage strategy that
uses leverage to amplify returns, declined 1.2 percent for the
month and is up 16 percent this year, according to the update, a
copy of which was obtained by  Bloomberg News . The strategy’s
unlevered Paulson Partners fund decreased 0.5 percent in June
and rose 8 percent in 2013.  Gold Losses  Other hedge-fund firms, including the $15.5 billion York
Capital Management LP and the $5.7 billion Jana Partners LLC,
also posted losses in June. Markets recovered some losses in the
last week of June and in July, with the Standard & Poor’s 500
Index up 2.8 percent since June 24 and 10-year Treasury yields
coming off their recent peaks.  Gold, which has driven losses this year for Paulson in a
fund that invests in the metal and related securities, dropped
12 percent in June, the most since October 2008. The firm said
last month it would report returns separately in the PFR Gold
Funds, which takes it name from the initials of Paulson and gold
specialists Victor Flores and John Reade. The strategy, made up
mostly of the fund manager’s own capital, has fallen 54 percent
this year through May.  Paulson Advantage Plus, an event-driven strategy that also
uses leverage and has some investments in stocks of gold
producers, decreased 3.5 percent in June, leaving it with a gain
of 3.4 percent in 2013. Paulson Advantage, the strategy’s
unlevered fund, fell 2.6 last month and rose 2.2 percent this
year.  Paulson Recovery Fund, the firm’s best-performing strategy
in 2013, slumped 1.7 percent last month and rose 26 percent for
the year.  Historical Returns  Paulson, 57, made $15 billion for his investors in 2007 by
betting against subprime mortgages before the housing collapse.
He’s seeking to continue a rebound from money-losing bets he
made in 2011 and 2012, including that the U.S. economy would
pick up, the  European debt crisis  would worsen and that bullion
and gold stocks would rise.  Paulson Advantage Plus fell 51 percent in 2011 and 19
percent in 2012. The firm’s gold strategy declined 11 percent in
2011 and 25 percent last year. The credit, merger-arbitrage and
recovery strategies dropped in 2011. Firm assets peaked at $38
billion in 2011.  Armel Leslie , a spokesman for Paulson & Co. with Walek &
Associates, declined to comment on the returns.  To contact the reporter on this story:
