Natural gas futures fell in  New York ,
snapping three days of gains.  Gas for August delivery declined as much as 1.1 percent to
$3.650 per million British thermal units in electronic trading
on the  New York Mercantile Exchange  today. Futures were down 0.5
percent at $3.673 per million Btu as of 3:43 p.m. in Singapore.
The contract rose 1 percent yesterday to $3.690.  The Energy Information Administration said yesterday
inventories rose 72 billion cubic feet in the week ended June 28
to 2.605 trillion cubic feet. A survey of Bloomberg users
predicted an increase of 75 billion.  “This storage number looks like an adjustment after a few
weeks of pretty big inventory builds,” Gordy Elliott, a risk-management specialist at Intl FCStone Inc. in  St. Louis Park ,
Minnesota said yesterday. “Supplies are still pretty heavy and
we don’t see any major weather that would lead to heavy power
demand.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
