PSA Peugeot Citroen (UG) , Europe’s second-biggest carmaker, rose the most in almost seven weeks after
analysts at Goldman Sachs Group Inc. said the unprofitable
company is likely to beat a goal of reducing cash consumption.  Peugeot  jumped  as much as 8.1 percent to 6.73 euros as of
and was trading up 8 percent at 10:59 a.m. in Paris, the
steepest intraday increase since May 17. Volume was 89 percent
of the three-month daily average. The stock has gained 23
percent this year, recovering from a 23-year low in 2012.  Reorganization measures taken by Paris-based Peugeot and
its  Faurecia (EO)  car-parts unit may lead to negative operational
free cash flow of 1.3 billion euros ($1.7 billion), narrower
than the manufacturer’s forecast of cash consumption at 1.5
billion euros, Stefan Burgstaller, a London-based analyst at
Goldman Sachs, said in a note to clients dated yesterday.
 Europe ’s economy may be improving, helping revive industrywide
car sales, he said.  Goldman Sachs raised its  recommendation  on Peugeot shares
to buy from neutral and added it to the bank’s “conviction
list.” Burgstaller also increased the stock-price estimate by
8.4 percent to 9 euros a share from 8.30 euros.  The maker of the Peugeot 308 hatchback and Citroen DS
models is struggling to return to profit as the European car
market heads into a sixth consecutive year of contraction.
Peugeot Chief Executive Officer Philippe Varin, who started his
second four-year term in June, is seeking to end cash burn at
the company by the end of 2014, after the carmaker consumed 200
million euros a month last year. The strategy includes expanding
sales outside Europe, eliminating 11,200 jobs in  France  by 2015
and shutting a factory near Paris.  To contact the reporter on this story:
