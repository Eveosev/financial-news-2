BM&FBovespa SA (BVMF3) , the Brazilian
exchange operator, is considering changing the way it determines
the relative importance of individual stocks in its benchmark
index, Chief Executive Officer Edemir Pinto said.  A group that began studying potential changes to the
 Ibovespa (IBOV)  eight months ago is scheduled to present a report on
July 31, Pinto told reporters in Rio de Janeiro today. Any
adjustments to the measure would be made in two to three years,
he said.  “Right now, there is no expectation of changing the
index.” Pinto said.  The country’s benchmark stock gauge, which is partially
weighted by volume, has been whipsawed by price swings in
companies owned by billionaire  Eike Batista , including oil
producer OGX Petroleo & Gas Participacoes SA, the most  volatile 
stock in the 823-member MSCI Emerging Markets Index.  Even after OGX’s market cap  tumbled  in the past year as it
failed to meet output targets, it has become one of the heaviest
stocks on the Ibovespa as average daily volume soared to 179.1
million shares over the past three months from 34.5 million a
year ago.  “We don’t have to worry about that,”  Pinto said when
asked about the influence of Batista’s companies in the gauge.
“We need to worry about having clear rules,”  BM&FBovespa says on its website that it hasn’t made changes
to the index’s  methodology  since its inception in 1968.  To contact the reporters on this story:
