South Korean flour millers plan to
resume imports of U.S. white wheat after the Asian government
found no unapproved gene-altered strains in shipments, according
to a local industry group.  The Korea Flour Mills Industrial Association will soon
release an official statement on the decision, Park Jeong Seop,
general manager of the Seoul-based group’s business department,
said by phone today, without specifying a date.  The group suspended purchases on May 31 after the U.S.
discovered a GM strain growing in an Oregon field. The wheat,
which showed up eight years after St. Louis-based  Monsanto Co. (MON) 
ended field tests, hasn’t been found on any other farms or in
commerce, the  U.S. Department of Agriculture  said June 14.  The Korean government hasn’t detected gene-modified
material in tests of 160 samples of U.S. wheat and flour, the
Ministry of Food and Drug Safety said July 2. The expanded tests
came after 45 products from Oregon tested negative last month.
 South Korea  will continue inspecting imports from the U.S., the
ministry said in the statement.  Japan, which halted imports of U.S. western-white and feed
wheat on May 30, is looking from  Canada  to Australia to replace
the variety favored in cakes and cookies. Asia’s second-biggest
wheat importer could face shortages if replacements are not
found, Hiromi Iwahama, a director of grain trading at the
Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries, said June 27.  Wheat for delivery in September yesterday climbed 1 percent
to $6.65 a bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade.  To contact the reporter on this story:
