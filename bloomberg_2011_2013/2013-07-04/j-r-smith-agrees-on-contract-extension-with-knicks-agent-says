J.R. Smith, the  National Basketball
Association ’s Sixth Man of the Year, and Pablo Prigioni have
agreed to stay with the  New York Knicks , according to their
agents.  Leon Rose, who represents the 27-year-old guard Smith,
declined in an e-mail to comment on the terms of the agreement.
The New York Times reported the extension is for four years and
$24 million.  Prigioni also agreed to re-sign with the team, his agent
George Bass said yesterday in an e-mail, without providing
contract terms. The three-year deal is worth $6 million,
according to the New York Daily News.  NBA players can agree on contracts, though they can’t sign
them until July 10 when the league’s moratorium on trades and
signings is lifted.  Smith averaged a career-best 18.1 points per game on 42
percent shooting last season, his second in New York, as the
Knicks finished with 54 wins, their highest total in 16 years.
The nine-year veteran’s production slowed in the postseason,
where he averaged 14.3 points per game on 33 percent shooting,
including a stretch in which he was 9-for-39 from 3-point range.  Prigioni, 36, became the NBA’s oldest rookie in 64 years
last season when he joined the Knicks after a 16-year career
playing in Argentina and Spain. He averaged 3.5 points and 3.0
assists per game last year.  When the signings are finalized, the Knicks will have
Smith, Prigioni, 2012-13 scoring champion  Carmelo Anthony , Iman Shumpert,  Raymond Felton  and  Tyson Chandler  under contract, the
Daily News said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
