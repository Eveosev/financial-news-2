Rubber declined for a second day as a
strengthening Japanese currency reduced the appeal of yen-denominated contracts and investors remained concerned that
demand is slowing in  China , the biggest user.  Rubber for delivery in December lost as much as 2.2 percent,
the biggest drop for a most-active contract since June 25, to
239.7 yen a kilogram ($2,401 a metric ton) on the Tokyo
Commodity Exchange. Futures traded at 243.7 yen at 10:24 a.m.
local time and have fallen 19 percent this year.  China may have difficulty realizing a 7.5 percent growth
target for this year, 21st Century Business Herald reported
today, citing Fan Jianping, chief economist at the State
Information Center. The country is undergoing economic
restructuring including reducing manufacturing capacity, the
report cited Fan as saying. The yen was at 99.93 per dollar
after yesterday rising 0.7 percent to 99.91.  “A strengthening Japanese currency and slower economic
growth in China reduced demand,” said Gu Jiong, an analyst at
commodity broker Yutaka Shoji Co.  China’s non-manufacturing purchasing managers’ index fell
to 53.9 in June from 54.3 in May to the second-lowest reading
since March 2011, when Bloomberg started tracking the data. The
slowdown in  service industries  underscores Premier  Li Keqiang ’s
challenge in achieving sustainable growth across the second-biggest economy through increasing consumption and reducing
reliance on exports and investment.  Rubber for January delivery on the Shanghai Futures
Exchange gained 0.4 percent 18,120  yuan  ($2,956) a ton. Thai
rubber free-on-board fell 1.2 percent to 83.65 baht ($2.69) a
kilogram yesterday, according to the Rubber Research Institute
of  Thailand .  To contact the reporter on this story:
