Ukraine’s high gross financing needs
and low foreign-currency reserves make it one of the most-exposed emerging markets to a liquidity squeeze,  Standard &
Poor’s  said.  Ukraine, Georgia and Turkey are most at risk, according to
three S&P vulnerability rankings contained in a report by
analysts Moritz Kraemer and  Frank Gill  released today.  Investors have reduced holdings of emerging-market assets
after Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said last month
that the central bank may begin reducing its bond-buying program
and end it entirely in mid-2014 if the  U.S. economy  achieves
sustainable growth. Ukrainian reserves plunged 20 percent to
$24.5 billion in the year through May as the central bank
propped up the hryvnia.  “The larger an economy’s dependence on external funding is
compared to its own stock of and capacity to generate foreign
reserves, the more vulnerable it is to a change in the
extraordinary loose monetary conditions prevailing worldwide,”
Kraemer and Gill wrote. “This is a pattern evident almost all
recent sovereign debt crises.”  Ukraine was the most vulnerable in S&P’s ranking of
countries using gross external financing needs and foreign
currency reserves. It ranked second in a measure of external
short-term debt and foreign-currency reserves and was fourth
when measured by current-account balance to gross domestic
product, according to the report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
