Mexico’s peso rose as a pledge from
European Central Bank President  Mario Draghi  to keep rates low
eased concern that near-zero borrowing costs in developed
nations were set to increase.  The currency climbed 0.6 percent to 12.8790 per U.S. dollar
at 9:13 a.m. in Mexico City, the strongest level on a closing
basis since June 17. Yields on government bonds maturing in 2024
fell two basis points, or 0.02 percentage point, to 5.80
percent.  The peso rose along with most emerging-market currencies as
Draghi said ECB policy makers expect to keep  interest rates  low
for an “extended period.” Global investors have been dumping
the country’s debt since May amid speculation the  Federal
Reserve  is poised to taper monetary stimulus that’s helped fuel
demand.  “It’s possible that you can expect higher rates in the
U.S. in 2014, but it’s still a ways away,”  Ramon Cordova , a
trader at Banco Base SA in San Pedro Garza Garcia, Mexico, said
in a telephone interview. “In the U.S. and Europe, there aren’t
signs that you’re going to raise rates over that period.”  Markets in the U.S., Mexico’s biggest trading partner, are
closed today for that country’s Independence Day holiday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
