The won snapped a two-day drop as
South Korea said it will boost policies to add service-industry
jobs and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. affirmed its view that the
currency will gain this year. Government bonds rose.  Finance Minister Hyun Oh Seok said today the government
will provide more support to enhance competitiveness and
employment in some “promising” areas to help fuel economic
growth. A Goldman Sachs report maintained the bank’s prediction
the won will climb to 1,110 per dollar in three months.  The won strengthened 0.5 percent to 1,138.45 per dollar in
 Seoul , according to data compiled by Bloomberg. One-month
implied volatility, a gauge of expected moves in the exchange
rate used to price options, fell 33 basis points, or 0.33
percentage point, to 10.58 percent.  “The government has been giving supportive comments and
the Goldman Sachs’ view on the won may help lift market
sentiment,” said Jeon Seung Ji, an analyst at Samsung Futures
Inc. in Seoul. “Investors are likely to remain cautious as U.S.
markets are shut for a holiday today, and before tomorrow’s jobs
report that may offer clues about the Federal Reserve’s
stimulus-exit strategy.”  U.S. employers added 165,000 jobs in June following an
increase of 175,000 in May, according to the median forecast in
a Bloomberg survey of economists before official figures due
tomorrow. Claims for jobless benefits decreased by 5,000 to
343,000 in the week ended June 29, the Labor Department said
yesterday in  Washington , and a private report showed companies
added more workers to payrolls in June than forecast.  Fed Chairman Ben S. Bernanke said June 19 the central bank
may slow bond purchases this year and end them in 2014 if
economic growth meets its estimates. U.S. markets are closed
today for the Independence Day holiday.  The yield on the 2.75 percent bonds due June 2016 fell two
basis points to 2.94 percent, prices from Korea Exchange Inc.
