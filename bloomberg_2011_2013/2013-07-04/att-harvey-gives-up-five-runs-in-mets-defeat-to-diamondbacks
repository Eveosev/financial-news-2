Matt Harvey pitched five scoreless
innings before giving up five runs as the New York Mets lost 5-3
to the Arizona Diamondbacks in their rain-delayed Major League
Baseball contest.  Harvey (7-2) surrendered a three-run homer in the sixth
inning to  Cody Ross  that gave the Diamondbacks a 3-2 lead. He
was relieved following  Eric Chavez ’s run-scoring double in the
seventh with no outs that put Arizona up by two runs at Citi
Field in New York.  David Wright , Josh Satin and Daniel Murphy each hit solo
home runs for the Mets (35-46).  Randall Delgado (1-2) gave up two runs on seven hits and
struck out nine in seven innings for the Diamondbacks (43-41).
Heath Bell got his 15th save, striking out one in the ninth
inning.  To contact the reporter on this story:
