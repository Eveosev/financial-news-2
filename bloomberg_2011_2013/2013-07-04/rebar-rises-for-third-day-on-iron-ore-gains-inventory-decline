Steel reinforcement-bar futures in
 Shanghai  advanced for the third day, buoyed by a rally in  iron
ore  and a reduction in rebar inventory.  Rebar for delivery in January on the Shanghai Futures
Exchange rose as much as 0.5 percent to 3,635 yuan ($593) a
metric ton, before trading at 3,625 yuan at 9:45 a.m. local
time. Futures closed at the highest level in more than six weeks
yesterday.  Iron ore  for immediate delivery at Tianjin port in  China 
rose for the fifth day yesterday, adding 1 percent to $120.50 a
dry ton, the highest since June 20, according to The Steel Index
Ltd. The raw material is a key ingredient for steel production.
 Rebar inventory  tracked by Shanghai’s Steelhome Information
Technology Co. fell by about 26 percent in the last quarter.  “Rebar inventory’s being drawn down at a healthy rate,
indicating that demand may be better than many had
anticipated,” Zhang Yichen, an analyst at Yongan Futures Co.,
said by phone from Beijing today. “Other favorable factors at
the moment include the rise in raw material prices and the fact
that a cash crunch in the Chinese banking sector seems to be
receding.”  The average spot price for rebar in China gained 0.4
percent to 3,371  yuan  a ton yesterday, according to data from
Beijing Antaike Information Development Co.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
