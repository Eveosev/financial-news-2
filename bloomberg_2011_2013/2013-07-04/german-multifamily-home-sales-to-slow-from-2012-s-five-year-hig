German residential portfolio
transactions, which reached a five-year high in 2012, are set to
slow in 2013 as fewer large groups of properties are offered for
sale and foreign investors look to other markets for higher
returns.  Institutions, including insurers, pension funds and
private-equity firms, bought 7.05 billion euros ($9.2 billion)
of German multifamily homes in the first half, little changed
from a year earlier, Chicago-based broker  Jones Lang LaSalle
Inc. (JLL)  said in a statement today. The investors are on track to
complete 10 billion euros of deals by the end of the year. In
2012, they bought homes valued at 11.1 billion euros, the most
since 2007.  “The German market has become a little too expensive for
international investors in the past year,” said Oliver Schoetz-van der Hoff, head of regional residential investment at Jones
Lang LaSalle  Germany .  German home prices are rising as institutional and private
investors seek safe and profitable investments amid the European
sovereign debt crisis. Apartment prices rose 8 percent in the 12
months through May, according to data compiled by Berlin-based
online broker ImmobilienScout24. In 2012, deals were fueled by
the sale of almost 100,000 apartments by owners who needed to
pay debts from last decade’s buyout boom.  The biggest deal of 2013 was the sale of about 30,700
Bavarian apartments by German bank BayernLB to a group of
pension funds and savings banks led by  Patrizia Immobilien AG (P1Z)  in
a transaction valued at about 2.5 billion euros, Jones Lang
said. The second-biggest was Deutsche Wohnen AG’s purchase of
7,800 Berlin apartments from Blackstone Group LP for about 420
million euros.  To contact the reporter on this story:
