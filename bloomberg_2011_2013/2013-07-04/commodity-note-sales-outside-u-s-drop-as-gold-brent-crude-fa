Offerings outside the U.S. of
structured notes tied to commodities declined 31 percent in the
first half from a year ago, following a drop in prices for gold
and  Brent crude  oil, the most-linked assets.  The number of deals in the first half fell to 378 from 550
a year earlier, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
Offerings tied to Brent crude declined 20 percent to 147, and
those tied to gold dropped 33 percent to 52, the data show.  Gold futures plunged 27 percent through the end of June,
the worst first-half performance since 1981, while Brent crude
fell 8 percent amid its longest run of quarterly losses in 15
years.  Banks from Goldman Sachs Group Inc. to Credit Suisse Group
AG last month cut their forecasts for the metal, while UniCredit
SpA and Bank of America Corp. did the same for Brent amid signs
the  Federal Reserve  is closer to ending stimulus measures.  To contact the reporter on this story:
