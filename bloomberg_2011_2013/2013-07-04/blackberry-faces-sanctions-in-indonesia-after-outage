The Indonesian government is
preparing sanctions against  BlackBerry (BBRY)  after an outage yesterday
left Indonesians without access to some messaging services from
the Canadian smartphone maker.  The sanctions are pending BlackBerry’s report into the
disruption and the government will also consult the nation’s
telecommunication regulatory board to see whether the incident
violated local rules, said Gatot Dewa Broto, a spokesman for the
Communication and Information Technology Ministry. It’s the
fourth outage for BlackBerry since April 2012, he said.  “We don’t want to be seen as allowing this to keep
happening again,” Broto said by telephone today. “We are
preparing sanctions,” he said, declining to elaborate what
these may be.  Yesterday’s outage, which affected the popular instant-messaging application BlackBerry Messenger, may hinder the
company’s efforts to sustain its market share in the world’s
fourth-most populous nation. BlackBerry has about 6.3 million
subscribers in  Indonesia , up from 6 million in 2012 and 5
million in 2011, Broto said.  Still, BlackBerry probably won’t reach the ministry’s
forecast of 7 million subscribers this year amid tighter
competition from Google Inc.’s Android-powered smartphones, he
said.  The service interruption primarily affected Web browsing,
social networking and BlackBerry Messenger, Matt Stewart, a
spokesman for the Waterloo, Ontario-based company, said today.
He declined to confirm the ministry’s figures for Indonesian
subscribers.  Subscribers Decline  BlackBerry’s worldwide subscriber base slipped to 72
million last quarter, from 76 million and 79 million in the
preceding quarters, and the company will no longer disclose a
user tally. BlackBerry last week disclosed weaker-than-expected
sales of its flagship Z10 handset, a new phone the company was
counting on to win back market share lost to  Apple Inc. (APPL) ’s iPhone
5 and  Samsung Electronics (005930)  Co.’s Galaxy S4.  Indonesia has imposed sanctions on BlackBerry before. In
September 2009 the government ended a two-month freeze on
issuing licenses for new BlackBerry models after it opened a
service center in Jakarta. The communications ministry in June
2009 halted licenses for sales of new BlackBerry models pending
the opening of a local branch office with after-sales service.  BlackBerry rose 0.4 percent to C$10.21 at 10:53 a.m. in
Toronto. The stock has dropped 13 percent this year.  To contact the reporters on this story:
