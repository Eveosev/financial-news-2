The U.K. opposition Labour lawmaker
in charge of the party’s election campaign quit his post
following a dispute about the selection of a candidate and
allegations a trade union was trying to exert too much control.  Tom Watson , who will remain a member of Parliament, said in
his resignation letter that his departure wasn’t the result of a
falling-out with Labour leader  Ed Miliband .  “I’m proud of your Buddha-like qualities of patience, deep
thought, compassion and resolve,” he wrote to Miliband in a
 letter published on his Web site . “I remain your loyal servant.
I’ll always be on hand to help you if you need me. I just don’t
think you need me in the Shadow Cabinet any more.”  Labour said this month it planned to draw up a new
shortlist of candidates to stand on behalf of the party in the
district of Falkirk,  Scotland , at the 2015 election. It has
excluded people who joined the local party in the past year from
having a say in the decision after an investigation into reports
that Unite, a labor union, paid for about 100 people to join.  Prime Minister  David Cameron  made much of the Falkirk row
during his weekly exchanges with Miliband in Parliament
yesterday, repeatedly saying in answers to questions on
different subjects that the Labour leader wasn’t standing up to
Unite’s general secretary, Len McCluskey. Unite meanwhile has
attacked Miliband for giving way to an “anti-union agenda” by
intervening in Falkirk.  To contact the reporter on this story:
