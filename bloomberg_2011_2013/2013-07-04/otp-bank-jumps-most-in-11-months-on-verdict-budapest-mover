OTP Bank Nyrt. jumped the most in 11
months after the  Hungary ’s top court ruled a foreign-currency
mortgage by the country’s largest lender was valid.  The shares rose 4.4 percent to 4,802 forint by the end of
trade in Budapest, the biggest increase on a closing basis since
Aug. 6. OTP led a 2 percent rally in the benchmark BUX stock
 index .  The court, known as Kuria, overturned a previous ruling
that voided a disputed contract while imposing changes to the
exchange-rate margin that OTP can charge, Judge Ursula Vezekenyi
said today in Budapest. Hungary’s financial regulator warned
last month that the blanket invalidation of foreign-currency
loan contracts would risk triggering bank runs and a potential
sovereign default.  OTP jumped on the “favorable” court ruling, analysts at
KBC Groep NV’s Hungarian broker unit, wrote in an e-mail to
clients.  Banks were among top  gainers  as European stocks rallied
today after the  European Central Bank  said  interest rates  will
remain low for an extended period.  To contact the reporter on this story:
