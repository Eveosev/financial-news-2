South Africa wants desalination
plants to be used to treat acid water from mines, with the
cleaned liquid potentially supplying as much as 5 percent of the
water needs of the Witwatersrand, the nation’s industrial
heartland, Business Day reported.  This is one of the proposals that are a part of the
national water resource strategy released by Water Affairs
Minister Edna Molewa yesterday, the Johannesburg-based newspaper
said, citing her.  Desalination could help increase the supply of Rand Water,
the country’s biggest water board, by 67 million cubic meters
(2.4 billion cubic feet), the newspaper said, citing Trevor
Balzer, director-general for the Water Affairs Department.  To contact the reporter on this story:
