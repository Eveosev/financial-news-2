Hyundai Merchant Marine Co. (011200)  gained
the most in more than two weeks in Seoul stock trading, on
optimism of improving relations between North and South Korea.  Hyundai Merchant climbed by the daily 15 percent limit at
the close in Seoul, the most since June 17. The company is the
biggest shareholder in Hyundai Asan Corp., which manages a
resort in communist North Korea.  Romanson Co. (026040)  and  Shinwon Corp. (009270) ,
which run plants in the North Korean border city of Gaeseong,
both jumped more than 8 percent.  The two Koreas officially restored a hotline at the border
village of Panmunjom today. North Korea said yesterday it will
allow South Korean businessmen back into the jointly-run
Gaeseong industrial complex, which has been shut since the North
withdrew its workers in April. South Korea proposed holding
talks with North Korea regarding Gaeseong on July 6 at Panmunjom,
the South’s Unification Ministry spokesman Kim Hyung Suk said at
a briefing today.  “Possibilities are rising that the two Koreas may restart
talks, giving a boost to investor sentiment that business with
North Korea may take off soon,” said Kang Seong Jin, an analyst
at Tongyang Securities, says by phone today.  The benchmark  Kospi index  rose 0.8 percent. Hyundai
Merchant was the best performer in the MSCI  Emerging Markets 
Index, which added 0.7 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
