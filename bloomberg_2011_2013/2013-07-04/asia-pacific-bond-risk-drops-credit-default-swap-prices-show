The cost of insuring corporate and
sovereign bonds in the Asia-Pacific region against non-payment
declined, according to traders of credit-default swaps.  The Markit iTraxx Asia index of 40 investment-grade
borrowers outside  Japan  fell 4 basis points to 158 basis points
as of 8:09 a.m. in  Hong Kong , Australia & New Zealand Banking
Group Ltd. prices show. The gauge is set for its biggest fall
since June 27, according to data provider CMA.  The Markit iTraxx Australia index slid 1 to 138 as of 10:08
a.m. in Sydney, according to National Australia Bank Ltd.
prices. The benchmark closed yesterday at its highest since June
25, according to CMA, which is owned by McGraw-Hill Cos. and
compiles prices quoted by dealers in the private market.  The Markit iTraxx Japan index dropped 3 basis points to 107
as of 9:09 a.m. in  Tokyo , according to Citigroup Inc. prices.
The decline follows an 8-basis-point increase yesterday that was
the biggest since June 13, CMA data show.  Credit-default swap indexes are benchmarks for insuring
bonds against default and traders use them to speculate on
 credit quality . A drop signals improving perceptions of
creditworthiness, while an increase suggests the opposite.  The swap contracts pay the buyer face value in exchange for
the underlying securities if a borrower fails to meet its debt
agreements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
