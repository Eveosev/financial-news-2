MasterCard Inc. (MA)  asked the European
Union’s highest court to overturn a regulatory decision on
transaction fees that ended its ability to set rates on cross-border credit-card payments.  MasterCard is challenging an EU decision that forces it to
maintain reduced rates for the transaction fees that are paid by
retailers. The EU court’s ruling, which will be final, will set
a precedent for card payment systems in Europe.  “The effect of the commission’s decision is to require
MasterCard issuers to continue to provide valuable services to
merchants such as guaranteeing payment to them without being
able to recover any revenues from those merchants for those
services,” Thomas Sharpe, a lawyer for MasterCard, told the EU
Court of Justice in Luxembourg today.  EU regulators have targeted credit- and debit-card fees for
a decade and this year started a probe into Purchase, New York-based MasterCard’s charges on foreign card payments such as when
tourists go shopping in the 28-nation bloc. Visa  Europe  Ltd.,
operator of the EU’s largest payment-card network, proposed a
settlement of a similar case that is being reviewed by the
European Commission.  The EU General Court, the bloc’s second-highest tribunal,
last year backed the European Commission’s 2007 decision that
MasterCard’s levies unfairly inflated the transaction fees paid
by retailers for processing payments.  Free MasterCard  “If we win this case, we would be free to set any fees we
want,” Carl Munson, MasterCard’s associate general counsel,
said in an interview after the hearing.  While MasterCard agreed in 2009 to fee changes as part of a
settlement with the Brussels-based EU regulator to avoid a daily
penalty of as much as 3.5 percent of sales, it asked the court
to overturn the EU antitrust agency’s findings.  The case hinges to a large extent on the argument that there
is no longer an “association of undertakings” between
MasterCard, which was once owned by 1,400 financial
institutions, and banks since it underwent a “radical”
transformation when the company went public in 2006.  The lower EU court’s interpretation that there is such an
association is “quite dangerous,” Bernard Amory, another
MasterCard lawyer, said today.  “MasterCard must act in the interests of its
shareholders, not the banks,” Amory said. “That is by law.”  MasterCard’s appeal is supported by  HSBC Holdings Plc (HSBA) ,
 Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc  and the  Lloyds Banking Group
Plc. (LLOY)   No Part  “Not only do the banks play no part whatsoever in the
decisions since the IPO, but there’s also no commonality of
interest,” said James Flynn, a lawyer for Lloyds. “MasterCard
simply makes these decisions and announces them to the Lloyds
banking group and other issuers.”  Retailers who back the EU decision have long fumed about
the cost of taking plastic. Unlike with checks, banks charge
them fees, known as interchange, to process debit- and credit-card payments. The amounts are set by MasterCard and Visa, which
own the payment networks and pass the money to the banks.  The multilateral interchange fee “is in reality an
additional cost of business that must be born by retailers
themselves and ultimately by their consumers,” Aidan Robertson,
a lawyer for the  British Retail Consortium , told the court.  Paolo Mengozzi, an advocate general at the EU court, said
he will issue his non-binding opinion on the case by Nov. 27.
The case is: C-382/12 P MasterCard and Others v. Commission.  To contact the reporter on this story:
