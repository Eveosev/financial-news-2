Brazilian homebuilder  Tecnisa SA (TCSA3) 
climbed the most since February after reporting a surge in sales
and new projects in the second quarter.  The shares  rose  4 percent to 7.85 reais at the close of
trading in Sao Paulo, the biggest gain since Feb. 28. The
BM&FBovespa Real Estate index  advanced  1.8 percent.  Sao Paulo-based Tecnisa’s sales booked in the second
quarter more than doubled to 555 million ($244.9 million) from a
year earlier, while new projects increased fourfold to 554
million reais, the homebuilder said in a regulatory filing late
yesterday.  “Tecnisa is starting to show an improvement in its
operations,” Eduardo Silveira and Frederico Mendes, analysts at
BES Securities  Brazil , wrote in a note to clients today.  Tecnisa has dropped 2.6 percent this year, the second-best
performance on the real estate index, which tumbled 26 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
