Getinge AB (GETIB) , a Swedish maker of
sterilization systems, rose the most in three weeks after  Nordea
Bank AB (NDA)  said demand is probably stabilizing in  Europe .  The shares gained as much as 2 percent, the biggest
intraday advance since June 11, and traded 1.9 percent higher at
209.80 kronor as of 10:14 a.m. in Stockholm trading, giving the
company a market value of 50 billion kronor ($7.5 billion).  “The impression we get from our industry contacts is that
demand for medical technology capital equipment has begun to
stabilize in Europe,” Patrik Ling, an analyst at Nordea, said
in a note. “The underlying demand is still weak but we believe
the bottom has been reached around mid-2013 –- which is good for
Getinge’s mid-term outlook.”  Nordea lifted its share-price estimate for Getinge to 200
kronor from 185 kronor on the back of “slightly higher”
forecasts for the coming years. The bank reiterated a sell
recommendation as it expects Getinge’s second-quarter results,
due July 11, to be weaker than its management expected at the
time of the first-quarter report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
