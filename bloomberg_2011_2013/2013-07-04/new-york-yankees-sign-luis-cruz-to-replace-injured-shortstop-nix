The New York Yankees signed Luis Cruz
after shortstop Jayson Nix was placed on the disabled list with
a right hamstring strain.  Free agent infielder Cruz, 29, was released by the Los
Angeles Dodgers after 45 games this season. He batted .127 with
one home run and six runs batted in.  Cruz was hitless in three at-bats last night in the
Yankees’ 3-2 win over the host Minnesota Twins.  Nix was a replacement for  Eduardo Nunez , who was injured on
May 5. Nunez was subbing for  Derek Jeter , who hasn’t played all
season after breaking his ankle.  Manager  Joe Girardi  said Jeter may be able to return to the
Yankees’ roster after the All-Star break that ends July 19.  To contact the reporter on this story:
