World food prices fell for a second
month in June, led by declines in dairy and sugar on prospects
of rising global output, the  United Nations ’ Food & Agriculture
Organization said.  An  index  of 55 food items traced by the FAO fell 0.9
percent to 211.3 points last month from a revised 213.2 points
in May, the Rome-based agency wrote in an online report today.
The measure, which climbed to a record 237.9 points in February
2011, is up 5.4 percent from a year earlier.  “Last month’s decline reflects a drop in sugar and
especially dairy prices, with more contained slides affecting
cereals and oils,” the FAO wrote. In dairy, “calm is returning
to the market, after an abrupt fall in New Zealand’s end-of-season output, as dairy supplies are being sourced elsewhere,
including  Europe  and the  United States .”  The dairy price index slid 4.3 percent in June, after
rising in April to the highest since December 2007 as drought
cut supplies in  New Zealand . The sugar index fell 3 percent last
month, while a gauge of grain prices declined 1 percent, the FAO
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
