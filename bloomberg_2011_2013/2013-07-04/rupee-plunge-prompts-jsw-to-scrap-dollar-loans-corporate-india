JSW Steel Ltd. (JSTL)  scrapped a plan to
raise dollar loans to refinance part of its 280 billion rupees
($4.7 billion) of borrowings after yields denominated in the U.S.
currency surged and the rupee fell to a record.  India ’s third-largest steelmaker, which has gross rupee
debt of about 170 billion rupees, will borrow in local currency,
Group Chief Financial Officer Seshagiri Rao said. The company
plans to cut the interest rate it pays on the loans to an
average 9.7 percent from 10.5 percent, he said. Mumbai-based JSW
planned to swap about 55 billion rupees of loans at  JSW Ispat
Steel Ltd. (JSWI)  with dollar debt after absorbing the unit, Rao had
said on April 12. Ispat was merged with JSW last month.  “Yields have gone up in the international markets and we
can’t pursue the option of refinancing in dollars,” Rao said in
an interview in Mumbai. “We wanted to do it to maintain the
ratio of foreign to domestic loans at 50 percent, as was the
case before the Ispat merger.”  JSW abandoned plans to raise dollar debt after speculation
the U.S. Federal Reserve may pare stimulus measures led to a
flight of funds out of riskier emerging market assets. The rupee
plunged after Fed Chairman Ben S. Bernanke on May 22 first
signaled a potential reduction in the monetary authority’s
monthly bond purchases. The rupee’s drop has made it Asia’s
worst-performing currency in the past three months.  The yield on benchmark U.S. Treasuries has  risen  89 basis
points since May 1 to 2.57 percent. The rate touched 2.61
percent on June 25, the highest since August 2011, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  Shares Drop  JSW shares rose 0.8 percent to 616.35 rupees at close in
Mumbai.  The stock  has fallen 24 percent this year, compared with
a 31 percent drop in the S&P BSE Metal Index and a 0.4 percent
increase in the benchmark S&P BSE Sensex.  JSW, 14.9 percent owned by  Japan ’s second-biggest
steelmaker  JFE Holdings Inc. (5411) , will borrow from non-banking
finance companies as banks aren’t allowed to lend below their
base rate, Rao said. The minimum rate of lending at  State Bank
of India (SBIN) , the nation’s largest bank is 9.7 percent, the lowest
among all state-run banks in the country.  The company is seeking shareholders’ approval to raise its
borrowing limit to 400 billion rupees from 250 billion rupees to
fund its expansion plans and finance any acquisition, JSW Steel
said in its  annual report .  Rising volatility of the rupee has also affected JSW’s plan
to borrow in foreign currency because of increased hedging costs.
The price to insurance against fluctuations is making dollar
debt more expensive than rupee borrowings, R.K. Garg, finance
director at New Delhi-based  Petronet LNG Ltd. (PLNG) , India’s biggest
natural gas importer, said on June 21.  Hedging Policy  The recent depreciation of the rupee is a result of hedging
by companies and increased speculation that the currency will
fall, Rao said. While JSW, whose sales are denominated in
dollars, hasn’t changed its hedging policy, any volatility
adversely impacts the company, he said.  “A lot of companies were not hedging earlier but the way
rupee has depreciated most companies are now looking forward to
hedge,” Hemant Dharnidharka, the Bangalore-based head of credit
research at SJS Markets Ltd. said over phone. “ With hedging
costs there is no arbitrage left in raising dollar debt.”  The currency, which fell to an unprecedented 60.7650 on
June 26, weakened 0.2 percent to 60.2400 per dollar in Mumbai
today, according to local bank prices compiled by Bloomberg. The
rupee’s one-month implied volatility has surged 452 basis points
last quarter, the most since September 2011, indicating greater
risks of exchange-rate swings.  Earnings Volatility  “Such a sharp fall will hit companies in the form of
translation or foreign-exchange losses,” Rao said. “This will
bring volatility in earnings of all corporates with foreign
exchange liabilities even though operationally they may be doing
well.”  JSW Steel, which agreed in December 2010 to buy Ispat
Industries for 21.6 billion rupees, will absorb the company,
Chairman Sajjan Jindal said on Sept. 1. The ratio of foreign
currency debt fell to 39 percent from 50 percent after the
merger, Rao said.  In November, JSW Ispat won the environment ministry’s
approval for projects worth 65 billion rupees that will boost
steel capacity by 2 million metric tons and help build a 4
million-ton pellet plant and a 300-megawatt power unit.  Mining Ban  Production at JSW, which expanded its biggest factory in
southern state of Karnataka to 10 million tons annually from 6.8
million tons in 2011, fell after a court-ordered ban in July of
the same year on iron ore mining in the state, as it probed
environmental breaches. Capacity use had fallen as low as 30
percent, Jindal had said in September, 2011. The Supreme Court
allowed mining to restart in the province in a Sept. 3 order
last year.  Improved iron ore availability from October this year as
more mines start in Karnataka will help in raising volumes for
JSW Steel, which may gain at 10 percent each year until March
2016, Jimesh Sanghvi, an analyst at Avendus Securities Pvt. Ltd.,
said in a report on June 25. The focus on increasing output of
high-value products and improving efficiency will help in
raising per ton earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation,
and amortization, according to the report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
