South African corn futures declined
as the rand gained against the dollar, making imports for the
grain cheaper.  White corn for delivery in December, fell 0.5 percent to
2,277.80 rand ($226) a metric ton by the close on the South
African Futures Exchange. The yellow variety for delivery in
September dropped 0.6 percent to 2,212.20 a ton.  The rand gained for the first time in four days as stocks
and commodity prices rebounded before interest-rate decisions
from the European Central Bank and the Bank of England.  “The rand was slightly stronger,” Benjamin Swanepoel, a
trader at Trademar Futures (Pty) Ltd., said in an e-mailed
statement from Johannesburg.  South Africa is the continent’s largest producer of corn.
Meal from the white variety is a staple food, while yellow corn
is mainly used as animal feed.  Wheat for delivery in December gained 1 percent to 3,417
rand a ton.  To contact the reporter on this story:
