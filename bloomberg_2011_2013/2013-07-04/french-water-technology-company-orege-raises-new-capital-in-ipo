Orege SA (OREGE) , a French water-technology
company, raised 20 million euros ($26 million) in capital on
completion of an initial public offering on Euronext Paris to
fund its next phase of growth, according to Climate Change
Capital Private Equity.  Alex Betts, a managing director of the European private
equity fund that invests “expansion capital” in clean power,
water and waste recovery, said the IPO values Orege at about 60
million euros, “a significant increase” since CPE’s original 6
million-euro investment in Orege in 2011.  CPE is backed by institutional investors including
Alpinvest, Robeco and Universities Superannuation Scheme, it
said in today’s statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
