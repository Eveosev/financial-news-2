German government bonds advanced,
pushing the nationâ€™s two-year yield to the lowest in almost a
month, as European Central Bank President Mario Draghi said
rates will stay low for an extended period of time.  The yield on the two-year securities slipped seven basis
points, or 0.07 percentage point, to 0.10 percent as of 1:39
p.m. London time, and touched 0.09 percent, the lowest since
June 6. The 10-year yield slipped four basis points to 1.62
percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
