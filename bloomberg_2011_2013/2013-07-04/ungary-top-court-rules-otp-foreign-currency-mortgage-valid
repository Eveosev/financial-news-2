Hungary ’s top court ruled in favor of
OTP Bank Nyrt., the country’s biggest lender, in a case related
to foreign-currency mortgages, reducing the risk of similar
lawsuits.  The court, known as Kuria, overturned a previous ruling
voiding a disputed contract while imposing a retroactive limit
on the exchange-rate margin the bank can charge, Judge Ursula
Vezekenyi said today in Budapest. The verdict can’t be appealed.  The ruling may be a test case for 3.48 trillion forint
($15.4 billion) of foreign-currency mortgages held by Hungarian
households as of March 31. Karoly Szasz, the head of the
country’s financial regulator, in a letter to the Kuria
published June 20 said the blanket invalidation of foreign-currency loan contracts would risk triggering bank runs and a
potential state default.  “The court decided that it serves the interests of the
parties if it rules the contract valid retroactively while
modifying the contract’s conditions,” Gyorgy Wellmann, head of
the civil department at Kuria said at a news conference after
the reading of the verdict.  OTP rose 4 percent to 4,784 forint as of 3:40 p.m. in
Budapest, its biggest jump in a month. The forint strengthened
0.3 percent to 293.52 per euro.  As part of the ruling, the exchange-rate margin that OTP
can charge was retroactively limited to plus or minus 0.5
percent versus the bank’s mid rate, Wellmann said, adding that
the verdict allows the borrower to seek “some minimal”
repayment from the bank.  Franc Demand  Hungarian home-buyers borrowed mainly in Swiss francs for
years to take advantage of lower  interest rates  until a drop in
the forint in the wake of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc.’s 2008
collapse sent repayments soaring and stoked bad debt.  Prime Minister  Viktor Orban  essentially banned foreign-currency mortgage lending in 2010 and temporarily allowed the
early repayment of such loans at below-market rates, forcing
lenders to swallow losses. That, along with  Europe ’s highest
bank levy made the industry unprofitable, sank lending, and cost
Hungary its investment-grade  credit rating .  The European Union started an infringement procedure
against Hungary last month saying the restriction of foreign-currency loans violates the free flow of capital.  Bank Losses  Hungarian banks may face their third consecutive year of
losses as a result of “punitive” bank taxes, “high credit
risks, weak economic activity,”  Fitch Ratings  said yesterday.  “This could ultimately lead to downward revisions of
parent support-driven ratings for the banks,” Fitch said.  The government, in agreement with banks, introduced
programs to help borrowers last year. Under one, which ended in
September, banks converted non-performing foreign-currency loans
into forint and wrote down a quarter of the debt in exchange for
deducting some of their losses from the bank levy.  In a separate initiative, foreign-currency mortgage holders
can join a government plan to help reduce repayments. The
program allows debtors to make repayments at a fixed forint rate
for as long as five years, with the difference between that rate
and the market rate accumulating in a separate bank account.
Some 150,000 borrowers, or 33 percent of those eligible, have
signed up to the program, ruling party parliamentary leader
Antal Rogan said May 24.  The amount of overdue foreign-currency mortgages stood at
1.51 trillion forint as of March 31, according to the regulator.
OTP Bank Nyrt., Hungary’s largest lender, competes with foreign
banks including  KBC Groep NV (KBC) ,  Bayerische Landesbank ,  Erste Group
Bank AG (EBS) ,  Intesa SanPaolo SpA (ISP) ,  Raiffeisen Bank International AG (RBI) 
and  UniCredit SpA. (UCG)   Commercial banks are in talks with the Cabinet to design a
“market-based” solution for mortgage holders who are more than
90 days overdue with repayments, Daniel Gyuris, deputy head of
the Hungarian Banking Association, said March 19.  To contact the reporters on this story:
