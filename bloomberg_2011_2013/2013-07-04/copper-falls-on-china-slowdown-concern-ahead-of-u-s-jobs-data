Copper slipped from a two-week high
amid concern that slowing economic growth in  China , the biggest
user, will damp demand and ahead of a U.S. jobs report tomorrow.  Metal for delivery in three months on the London Metal
Exchange fell 0.7 percent to $6,947 a metric ton at 10:17 a.m.
in Shanghai. The price jumped to $7,005 a ton yesterday, the
highest since June 19. Copper declined 7.7 percent last month,
the biggest loss since May in 2012.  China may have difficulty realizing a 7.5 percent growth
target for this year, 21st Century Business Herald reported
today, citing Fan Jianping, chief economist at the State
Information Center. Two gauges of China’s manufacturing fell in
June, data showed this week, underscoring a sustained slowdown
in the nation’s economy.  “Copper is facing a strong resistance at $7,100 amid
concerns over China and  Europe ,”  Li Ye , an analyst at Shenyin &
Wanguo Futures Co., said by phone from Shanghai. “Now all eyes
are on the non-farm payroll data tomorrow.”  The U.S. Labor Department may report that total payrolls,
including government employees, rose by 165,000 last month,
shows the median forecast in a Bloomberg survey of economists.
The jobless rate may drop to 7.5 percent from 7.6 percent. The
 Federal Reserve  weighs whether labor market progress is enough
to warrant reducing its monthly bond-buying.  Copper for delivery in October on the Shanghai Futures
Exchange declined 0.9 percent to 50,120  yuan  ($8,180) a ton.
Metal for delivery in September on the Comex fell 0.7 percent to
$3.1525 a pound.  On the LME, nickel also declined, while zinc rose. Aluminum,
tin and lead were little changed.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
