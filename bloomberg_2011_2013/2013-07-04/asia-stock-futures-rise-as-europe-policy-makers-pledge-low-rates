Asian  stocks  rose, with the regional
index on course for a second week of gains, as European policy
makers signaled they will keep  interest rates  low for longer.  Komatsu Ltd. (6301) , a maker of construction and mining equipment
that gets 80 percent of sales offshore, gained 2.4 percent in
 Tokyo .  BHP Billiton  Ltd., the world’s biggest miner, climbed 1.2
percent in Sydney, leading an advance among resource companies.
 Samsung Electronics Co. (005930)  sank 3.8 percent in  Seoul  after the
world’s largest television maker missed estimates for second-quarter earnings.  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index gained 1.1 percent to 132.06 as
of 6:27 p.m. in Hong Kong, with all of its 10 industry groups
climbing. The gauge is headed for a 1.2 percent advance this
week. Futures on the  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index (SPX)  gained 0.9
percent, with U.S. equity markets poised to rise after a public
holiday.  “The  European Central Bank  and the  Bank of England  have
both come out and tried to combat the rise in bond yields with
some forward guidance,” Keith Poore, Wellington-based head of
investment strategy at AMP Capital Investors Ltd., which manages
more than $130 billion, said by telephone. “The market was
surprised by the dovish comments. Global growth is picking up
and this should flow through to earnings.”  Regional Gauges  Japan ’s  Topix index  added 1.5 percent, with trading volume
19 percent below the 30-day average. The Nikkei 225 Stock
Average gained 2.1 percent, led by exporters, as the yen
weakened for a second day.  Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index climbed 1.9 percent and the
Shanghai Composite Index gained 0.1 percent. Australia’s S&P/ASX
200 Index advanced 1 percent. New Zealand’s NZX 50 Index climbed
0.7 percent. Singapore’s Straits Times Index rose 0.9 percent
and Taiwan’s Taiex Index jumped 1.4 percent. South Korea’s  Kospi (KOSPI) 
index fell 0.3 percent.  European Central Bank President  Mario Draghi  pledged to
keep interest rates at a record low for an “extended period”
yesterday after Bank of England chief  Mark Carney  said increases
in market rates weren’t warranted.  The rhetoric contrasts with that from the U.S. Federal
Reserve, which has fueled global equity declines by signaling
stimulus may be reduced this year. U.S. employers probably added
almost as many workers last month as in May and the jobless rate
probably fell, according to Bloomberg surveys of economists
before the data due today.  Employment Outlook  U.S. Treasury yields soared to 2.61 percent on June 25, the
highest level since August 2011, as an improving economy dimmed
the lure of bonds as a haven. Global stocks have slumped since
May 20 after Fed Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said the central bank
may reduce bond purchases if the  U.S. economy  improves in line
with forecasts.  The U.S. unemployment rate probably fell to 7.5 percent in
June, matching April’s four-year low and down from 7.6 percent
in May, according to the median estimate of 82 economists
surveyed by Bloomberg ahead of a Labor Department report due
today.  Exporters gained. Komatsu rose 2.4 percent to 2,328 yen.
Toyota Motor Corp., the world’s largest carmaker, added 2.1
percent to 6,310 yen. Nissan Motor Co. advanced 1.9 percent to
1,056 yen.  Commodity producers posted the  largest gains  among the 10
industry groups on the MSCI Asia Pacific gauge. BHP Billiton
gained 1.2 percent to A$31.60 in Sydney. Kobe Steel Ltd.,
Japan’s third-largest steelmaker, added 7.6 percent to 142 yen.
 Aluminum Corp. of China Ltd. , the nation’s biggest producer of
the lightweight metal, jumped 2.5 percent to HK$2.42 in  Hong
Kong .  Relative Value  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index fell 9.5 percent through
yesterday from a five-year high on May 20 amid concern that the
Fed will begin tapering stimulus as  China’s economy  slows and
Japan puts off unveiling economic reform policies until after
upper house elections later this month.  That left the gauge trading at 12.7 times average estimated
earnings yesterday compared with 14.7 for the Standard & Poor’s
500 Index and 12.9 times for the Stoxx Europe 600 Index,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Temasek Holdings Pte, the biggest foreign investor in
Chinese banks, said it’s not concerned by a cash crunch and
plans to increase its assets in the nation.  Industrial & Commercial Bank of China Ltd. , the world’s
largest lender, gained 3.2 percent to HK$4.82 in Hong Kong.
China Construction Bank Corp. added 2.3 percent to HK$5.36.
Agricultural Bank of China Ltd. rose 1.7 percent to HK$3.08.  Crown, Echo  Crown Ltd., the gaming company controlled by billionaire
 James Packer , gained 3.2 percent to A$12.60 in Sydney as it
moved a step closer to developing a A$1.3 billion ($1.2 billion)
casino in Sydney, beating a rival proposal from Echo
Entertainment Group Ltd. Echo sank 5.2 percent to A$2.76.  Crown’s plan for a hotel and casino will proceed to the
next stage of a government approval process, New South Wales
Premier Barry O’Farrell said today. The plan would boost tourism
and contribute more to the state economy than Echo’s proposal
for a A$1.1 billion redevelopment of its existing Star casino,
the state government said.  Among stocks that fell, Samsung lost 3.8 percent to 1.267
million won in Seoul as operating profit rose to about 9.5
trillion won ($8.3 billion) in the three months to June from 6.5
trillion won a year earlier. That compares with the 10 trillion
won average  estimate  of 34 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  China Rongsheng Heavy Industries Group Holdings Ltd. (1101) 
tumbled 16 percent to 89 Hong Kong cents as China’s biggest
shipyard outside state control said it’s seeking support from
the government and its largest shareholder amid a plunge in
orders and prices.  To contact the reporter on this story:
