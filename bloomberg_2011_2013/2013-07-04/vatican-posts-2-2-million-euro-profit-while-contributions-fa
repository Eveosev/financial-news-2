The  Holy See , the Vatican’s central
administration, generated a profit of 2.19 million euros ($2.83
million) last year even as donations from Catholics throughout
the world declined.  Last year’s earnings compare with a 14.9 million-euro
deficit in 2011, the  Holy See  said today in a  statement .
Contributions from Catholic individuals, institutes and
foundations fell 7.5 percent.  The Catholic Church, which tries to supplement donations by
investing in traded securities, benefited in the 1990s from
booming stock markets, before plunging into the red for the
first time in 2003. Last year, “the good performance in
financial management” more than offset the costs of staff and
taxes such as a new Italian property levy, according to the
statement.  The Vatican, led by Pope Francis, is located in central
Rome near the Tiber River. The Vatican Governorate, the
institution that runs  Vatican City  and its support offices, had
a surplus of 23.1 million euros last year, according to the
statement.  The Vatican bank, formally known as Institute for the Works
of Religion or IOR, last year gave the Pope a contribution of 50
million euros, the Holy See said. The bank’s director Paolo
Cipriani and deputy director Massimo Tulli stepped down this
week.  Their resignations followed the arrest on June 28 of a
senior Vatican cleric, an Italian secret service agent and a
financial broker in a corruption investigation that’s part of a
wider probe into the IOR’s transactions. The three were charged
by  Rome  prosecutors with fraud and corruption.  To contact the reporter on this story:
