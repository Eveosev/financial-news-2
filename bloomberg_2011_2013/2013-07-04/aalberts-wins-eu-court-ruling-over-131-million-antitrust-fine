Aalberts Industries NV overcame a
court bid by antitrust regulators to reinstate a 100.8 million-euro ($131 million) copper cartel fine that was erased two years
ago.  The EU Court of Justice, the bloc’s top tribunal, dismissed
the European Commission’s attempt to bring back the penalty in a
ruling today. A lower court quashed the fine against Langbroek,
Netherlands-based Aalberts in March 2011.  Europe ’s biggest maker of fittings used in taps and heaters
was one of 30 companies  fined  a total of 314.7 million euros in
2006 for unlawfully colluding on prices of copper fittings used
in plumbing and heating. Aalberts’s fine was 6 percent of its
2010  revenue  of 1.68 billion euros.  The commission, the EU’s antitrust authority, appealed the
decision to overturn the fine, which said the Aalberts unit
targeted by the penalty didn’t participate in a copper cartel
during the period it was owned by the company.  Aalberts advanced as much as 1.7 percent in Amsterdam
trading, the highest intraday level in a week, and was up 1
percent at 17.45 euros as of 10:28 a.m. local time. That values
the company at 1.93 billion euros.  Aalberts will try to recover costs related to legal
proceedings, Chief Executive Officer Wim Pelsma said in an
interview.  Today’s decision runs counter to the opinion of an adviser
to the EU top court who said in February that the earlier
decision to annul the fine was based on an “error of law” and
should be overturned.  Antoine Colombani, a spokesman for the commission, didn’t
immediately respond to an e-mail seeking comment on the ruling.  The case is:  C-287/11 P ,  Aalberts Industries NV (AALB) , Comap SA,
formerly Aquatis France SAS, Simplex Armaturen + Fittings GmbH &
Co. KG v. European Commission.  To contact the reporter on this story:
