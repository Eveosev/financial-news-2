Gennady Timchenko , a Russian
billionaire ally of President  Vladimir Putin , has been awarded
France’s Legion of Honor for his contribution to ties between
the two countries.  Timchenko, 60, co-founder of the Gunvor Group Ltd. oil
trader, helped to reach an agreement on the creation of a
permanent exhibition of Russian art at the Louvre museum in
Paris, the Franco-Russian Chamber of Commerce and Industry said
on its website today. The award hasn’t yet been presented,
Timchenko’s spokesman, Alexei Firsov, said by phone.  Russian billionaire and New Jersey Nets basketball club
owner  Mikhail Prokhorov  received the Legion of Honor in 2011,
four years after being detained in France on suspicion of what
authorities called “pimping.” He was released without charge.  To contact the reporters on this story:
