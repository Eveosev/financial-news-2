Investors should buy the krone
against the euro after the Norwegian currency fell to the
weakest in 2 1/2 years last month, according to  David Bloom ,
global head of currency strategy at HSBC Holdings Plc in London.  The krone slumped 3.4 percent in the past month, according
to Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes that track 10
developed-market currencies, the worst performer after the
Australian dollar. It tumbled the most in more than four years
versus the U.S. dollar on June 20, after Norway’s central bank
signaled it may cut  interest rates  just as the U.S. Federal
Reserve indicated it was preparing to scale back stimulus  “Norway is getting absolutely smashed like it’s an
emerging market yet it’s the greatest currency on earth,” Bloom
said in an interview on Bloomberg Television’s “Countdown”
with  Mark Barton  and Anna Edwards. “We’d be selling euros and
buying  Norway . That’s a great currency but you can see the
liquidity is quite difficult so that’s for the longer term.”  The krona strengthened 0.3 percent to 7.9281 per euro at
11:19 a.m. London time today, after depreciating to 8.0819 on
June 24, the weakest level since December 2010. It advanced 0.2
percent against the dollar to 6.0963.  The krone is the least-traded of the Group of 10 developed-nation currencies, based on Bank for International Settlements
 data . It weakened last month after the Norges Bank predicted its
benchmark rate would be 1.38 percent in the fourth quarter,
versus an earlier forecast of 1.45 percent, dimming the allure
of the currency.  Fed Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said a day before the Norges
Bank’s announcement that U.S. policy makers may end asset
purchases next year if the economy achieves the sustainable
growth the central bank has sought since the last recession
ended in 2009.  To contact the reporter on this story:
