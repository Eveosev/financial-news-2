The yield on Indian bonds due 2022
fell to the lowest in more than two weeks on optimism improving
supply of cash in the banking system will spur demand for debt.  Local lenders’ daily  borrowings  from the central bank to
meet fund shortages fell to 108.8 billion rupees ($1.8 billion)
yesterday, the least since March 31, official data show. The
overnight interbank borrowing  rate  was at 6.40 percent today,
compared with 7 percent at the end of last week. The Fixed
Income Money Market and Derivatives Association widened a daily
trading band for local debt, according to its website, after
benchmark yields fell the most in a week.  “The liquidity situation has improved and that’s providing
a boost for bond prices,” said Debendra Kumar Dash, a fixed-income trader at  Development Credit Bank Ltd. (DEVB)  in Mumbai.  The yield on the 8.15 percent notes fell 10 basis points,
or 0.1 percentage point, to 7.60 percent as of 4:15 p.m. in
Mumbai, according to the central bank’s trading system. That’s
the lowest level since June 19. The yield jumped 18 basis points
last month, the most since the securities were issued in June
2012, as the  Indian rupee  plunged 4.9 percent.  The one-year interest-rate swap, a derivative contract used
to guard against fluctuations in funding costs, fell 13 basis
points to 7.43 percent, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
