Santos Ltd. (STO) ,  Australia ’s third-biggest oil producer, and  BG Group Plc (BG/)  will connect their gas
pipelines in Queensland as they seek cost savings by cooperating
with neighboring liquefied natural gas projects.  Linking their pipelines at The Narrows Crossing on the
Queensland mainland and on  Curtis Island , where coal-seam gas
will be converted into liquid form, will allow Santos and the
Australian unit of London-listed BG to swap gas, Rod Duke,
downstream vice president at Santos for the $18.5 billion
Gladstone development, said today in a  statement .  Adelaide-based Santos said the agreement with BG will
probably be followed by more cooperation between companies
working on LNG projects in the region. Santos, BG and a
ConocoPhillips- Origin Energy Ltd. (ORG)  venture are building three LNG
developments in Queensland at a cost of more than $60 billion to
tap rising Asian demand.  “We expect that this will be just one of many mutually
beneficial arrangements across the industry in the future,”
Duke said in the statement.  The pipeline links will be completed in 2014 and allow BG
and Santos to continue gas field operations during LNG plant
maintenance, Duke said.  “Ultimately it means the two companies will be able to
buy, sell and swap gas at these points during scheduled and
unscheduled events, therefore maximizing plant productivity,”
he said in the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
