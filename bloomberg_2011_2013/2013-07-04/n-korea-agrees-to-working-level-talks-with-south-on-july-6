North Korea agrees to hold working-level talks with South Korea at the northern end
of the Panmunjom border village on July 6, the Southâ€™s
Unification Ministry says in a text message today.
* NOTE: South Korea earlier today proposed holding the talks on
normalizing operations at the jointly run Gaeseong industrial
zone, which has been closed since April after the North blocked
South Korean access and withdrew its workers.  To contact the reporter on this story:
