(Corrects company name in first paragraph.)  B.B. Energy Holdings NV, a closely-held oil trader, increased its first unsecured  credit line  to
$125 million, taking advantage of banks’ willingness to commit
funds to the sector.  “The appetite from banks to lend to traders is there,
including from banks that are not historically trade-finance
providers,” Riccardo Greco, BB Energy’s London-based chief
financial officer, said in a telephone interview. The loan can
be used by any of the  group’s  trading offices, he said.  The one-year revolving credit facility, which includes a
12-month extension option, is the company’s inaugural corporate
facility, BB Energy said in a June 27 statement. Arranged by BNP
Paribas SA, Natixis SA, Rabobank International and Standard
Chartered Plc, the deal attracted a total of 17 lenders and
increased from $100 million, it said.  Commodity traders have raised at least $35 billion of
revolving credit facilities since December, including a $17.3
billion deal for Glencore Xstrata Plc, the largest European
syndicated loan this year, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. Trading companies generate lucrative ancillary
business for lenders due to their global operations and high
liquidity needs, bankers said last month.  BB Energy, founded in Lebanon in 1937, traded 11.2 million
tons of crude oil and petroleum products in 2012, generating
revenue of $10.5 billion. The loan is a “milestone” for the
company, reflecting its increased size, Greco said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
