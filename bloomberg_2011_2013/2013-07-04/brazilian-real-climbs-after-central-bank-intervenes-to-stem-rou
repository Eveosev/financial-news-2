Brazil ’s real rose after the central
bank intervened in the foreign-exchange market to stem a three-month rout that has made the currency the second-worst performer
in  emerging markets  this year.  The real gained 0.5 percent to 2.2566 per dollar at 1:45
p.m. in Sao Paulo, after earlier falling as much as 0.2 percent.
The central bank sold $1.2 billion of swap contracts, boosting
the supply of dollars in futures markets, in its first
intervention since June 28.  The central bank stepped into the market today because the
real’s initial decline was inconsistent with the gains in other
currencies across emerging markets, Mario Battistel, currency
trader at Fair Corretora, said in a phone interview from Sao
Paulo.  “The foreign factor wasn’t what brought the real down, so
it made sense for the central bank to act,” Battistel said.  The real plunged 9.4 percent in the April-to-June period,
its worst quarterly decline in almost two years, as growth in
Latin America’s biggest economy faltered and the Federal Reserve
signaled it would begin to scale back the U.S. monetary stimulus
that has fueled demand for emerging-market assets.  Yields on Brazilian interest-rate swap contracts due
January 2015 slid one basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, to
9.64 percent today.  To contact the reporters on this story:
