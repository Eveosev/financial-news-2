Asian  stocks  outside Japan rose after
better-than-estimated U.S. jobs data added to signs that the
world’s largest economy is recovering, boosting the earnings
prospects for exporters.  CSL Ltd. (CSL) , a maker of blood-derived therapies that gets
about 38 percent of sales in the U.S., gained 3.5 percent in
Sydney.  Cnooc Ltd. (883) , China’s largest offshore energy explorer,
added 2.1 percent in  Hong Kong  as crude oil traded near a 14-month high. Dentsu Inc., a Japanese advertising company that
bought Aegis Group Plc, sank 9.2 percent after saying it will
raise as much as 120.1 billion yen ($1.2 billion) selling shares
to help pay for the deal.  The  MSCI Asia Pacific excluding Japan Index  advanced 1
percent to 424.88 as of 6:19 p.m. in Hong Kong, as all 10
industry groups on the gauge climbed. Global stocks have slumped
since May 20 after Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said
the central bank may reduce bond purchases if the  U.S. economy 
improves in line with forecasts.  “Equities are still attractive,” David Cassidy, the
Sydney-based head of equity strategy at UBS AG, said by e-mail.
“While global economic growth is traveling below long-run
trends, it is still positive and corporate earnings are still
growing at a moderate pace. Ultimately a move to taper
quantitative easing because of ongoing good news in relation to
U.S. growth shouldn’t worry equities.”  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index, which includes Japanese
companies, climbed 0.4 percent. The gauge is down 9.5 percent
since May 20 amid concern that the Fed will begin tapering
stimulus as  China’s economy  slows and Japan puts off unveiling
economic reform policies until after upper house elections later
this month.  Topix, Singapore  Japan’s Topix index slid 0.3 percent, with volume 34
percent below its 30-day average for the time of day. South
Korea’s Kospi index gained 0.8 percent and Australia’s  S&P/ASX
200 Index (AS51)  climbed 1.1 percent. New Zealand’s NZX 50 Index gained
0.2 percent. Singapore’s Straits Times Index added 0.6 percent
and Taiwan’s Taiex Index fell 0.2 percent.  Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index gained 1.6 percent with trading
volume 36 percent below the 30-day average. China’s Shanghai
Composite Index climbed 0.6 percent.  Chinese Premier  Li Keqiang  said fiscal funds should be used
to redevelop shantytowns and improve basic infrastructure as
part of efforts to stabilize the world’s second-largest economy.
Money should also be used to focus the economy more on domestic
consumption, the State Council, or Cabinet, said in a statement
on its website yesterday, after a meeting led by Li.  U.S. Holiday  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index, which includes Japan, traded
at 12.7 times average estimated earnings yesterday, compared
with 14.7 for the  S&P 500  and 12.7 times for the Stoxx Europe
600 Index, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Futures on the  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index (SPX)  added 0.3
percent. The S&P 500 rose 0.1 percent yesterday as exchanges
closed at 1 p.m. in New York. U.S. equities markets are shut
today for the Independence Day holiday.  Asian-based companies exporting to the U.S. advanced. CSL
gained 3.5 percent to A$63.38 in Sydney. Samsung Electronics
Co., which gets 22 percent of sales in America, added 1.2
percent to 1.317 million won in  Seoul .  U.S. jobless claims decreased to 343,000 in the week ended
June 29 from a revised 348,000 in the prior period that was
higher than initially reported, the Labor Department said
yesterday in Washington. Separate reports showed companies
boosted employment by 188,000 workers in June, while  service
industries  unexpectedly expanded at the slowest pace in more
than three years.  Unemployment Report  The data came before the government’s monthly labor report
on July 5 that will probably show U.S. employers created 165,000
jobs in June, after adding 175,000 a month earlier, according to
the median forecast of economists in a Bloomberg survey. The
 unemployment rate  probably fell to 7.5 percent, matching April’s
four-year low.  “Definitely the next move will be up” for our equity
weighting, Peter Elston, Singapore-based head of Asia-Pacific
strategy and  asset allocation  at Aberdeen Asset Management Plc,
told Bloomberg TV. “It’s just a question of when and it’s
probably getting quite close.”  Energy producers advanced as crude  oil prices  rallied after
the ousting of Egypt’s president fanned concern unrest will
disrupt Middle East oil supply. Cnooc gained 2.1 percent to
HK$12.80 in Hong Kong. China Petroleum & Chemical Corp., the
nation’s largest refiner, rose 2.5 percent to HK$5.25.  Woodside
Petroleum Ltd. (WPL) , Australia’s No. 2 energy producer, added 3
percent to A$35.64.  West Texas Intermediate crude for August delivery traded at
$101.02 a barrel, near a 14-month high, in electronic trading on
the  New York Mercantile Exchange  at 5:56 p.m. in Sydney.  Dentsu sank 9.2 percent to 3,155 yen as the company said it
will offer as many as 29 million shares it owns and 8 million
new shares to investors in Japan and overseas. The proceeds will
be used to repay part of its 200 billion yen short-term  debt 
from the acquisition that was completed in March, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
