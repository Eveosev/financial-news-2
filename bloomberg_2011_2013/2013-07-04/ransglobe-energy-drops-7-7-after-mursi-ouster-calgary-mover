TransGlobe Energy Corp. (TGL) , the Canadian
oil producer that gets more than 90 percent of its revenue from
 Egypt , fell after Egypt’s army ousted President Mohamed Mursi
and the outlook for the country remained uncertain.  TransGlobe dropped 3.9 percent to C$6.48 by the 4 p.m.
close in Toronto, the largest decline since June 20, when the
company revised its 2013 output and announced a $20 million
charge for exploration expenses.  “They’re just getting punished for association with
Egypt,” said David Popowich, an analyst with Macquarie Group
Ltd. in Calgary. “It’s unwarranted,” he said.  TransGlobe has operated in Egypt since 2004, through the
rule of  Hosni Mubarak  and the 2011 revolution that ended his
presidency. The parts of the government that matter to oil
production -- the Ministry of Energy and the national  oil
company  -- haven’t changed in 20 years, said Popowich.  “I really don’t expect the fiscal terms in Egypt to change
with this change in power,” he said. Popowich rates TransGlobe
a buy with a target price of $14.25. Ten analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg had buy  ratings , while two had holds.  The uncertainty of the last few years has had an impact on
the pace of permitting and new drilling approval, said Popowich.  “Things have just kind of ground to a halt and I think
that once we have certainty on who’s going to be filling the
political holes at the top then you’ll start to see this pick up
again,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
