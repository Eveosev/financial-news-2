A guitar owned by Led Zeppelin’s Jimmy Page sold yesterday at an auction in London for 26,250 pounds (39,638).  The custom-made Martin instrument, inlaid with zodiac symbols and Page’s name, had been played by the guitarist at Roy Harper’s 70th birthday celebration at the Royal Festival Hall in 2007. Proceeds from its sale at Bonhams benefited the charity Action for  Brazil ’s Children Trust, of which Page is a patron.  The guitar achieved the highest price in a 402-lot auction of entertainment memorabilia. Estimated at 10,000-15,000 pounds, it was bought by a U.K.-based collector, Bonhams said.  The auction included several lots associated with David Bowie, who is the subject of an exhibition at the Victoria & Albert museum in London after his first album in a decade.  A set of Bowie’s lyrics for “The Jean Genie,” dated 1972, sold for 18,750 pounds to a bidder in the room against an upper estimate of 15,000 pounds. A similarly estimated red Vox 12-string electric guitar used by the musician to promote his 1972 album “The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars,” fetched a further 13,750 pounds.  An Internet bidder paid 4,000 pounds for a lock of Mick Jagger’s hair. Sold to benefit the charity “Changing Faces,” the souvenir had been kept by the grandmother of Chrissy Shrimpton, an ex-girlfriend of the Rolling Stones’ singer, Bonhams said.  Jagger, 69, and the Rolling Stones performed at the Glastonbury Festival on June 29.  Muse highlights include  Jorg von Uthmann  on Paris culture and  George Walden  on books.
