Tom Hayes, the former  UBS AG (UBSN)  and
 Citigroup Inc. (C)  trader, is scheduled to enter a plea on charges
related to manipulation of the London interbank offered rate
later this year.  Hayes, 33, was told by a judge in London today to enter a
plea at a hearing in late October. Wearing a black suit and
white button-down shirt without a tie, he spoke only to confirm
his name. Prosecutors at the  Serious Fraud Office  agreed to give
him more information on their case by Sept. 30.  “The documentation in this case, to describe it as
voluminous would be a large understatement,” said Mukul Chawla,
a lawyer for the SFO.  Hayes, who remains on bail, is charged with working with
employees at JPMorgan Chase & Co.,  Royal Bank of Scotland Group
Plc , HSBC Holdings Plc, Rabobank Groep and Deutsche Bank AG, as
well as Tullett Prebon Plc, ICAP Plc and RP Martin Holdings
Ltd., over a four-year period to manipulate yen Libor rates.  At his first court appearance last month, Hayes’s lawyer,
Lydia Jonson, declined to indicate how he would plead when asked
by a judge.  Four of the charges cover the period from Aug. 8, 2006,
until Dec. 3, 2009, while he worked at UBS, and the other four
from Dec. 1, 2009 until Sept. 7, 2010, when he was at Citigroup.  Hayes tried to manipulate rates “with the intention that
the economic interests of others would be prejudiced and/or to
make personal gain for themselves or another,” the SFO said in
the indictment.  Hayes has also been charged by the U.S. Justice Department,
which is running a parallel criminal investigation.  To contact the reporter on this story:
