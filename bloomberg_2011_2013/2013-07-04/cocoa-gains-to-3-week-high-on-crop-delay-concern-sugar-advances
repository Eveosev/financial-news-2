 London  on speculation the next harvest in West Africa, the
world’s main growing region, will be delayed. Sugar gained.  It’s dry in eastern Ivory Coast, the largest producer, and
more rain is needed in second-ranking  Ghana , according to MDA
Weather Services in Gaithersburg,  Maryland . The season in West
African nations usually begins in October.  “Some dryness has developed across east central portions
of Ivory Coast, which may stress development of the main cocoa
crop,” Kyle Tapley, a meteorologist at MDA, said in a report e-mailed yesterday. “Some dryness is also a concern across west
central portions of Ghana.”  Cocoa for September delivery advanced 1.3 percent to 1,518

millimeters.  Barry Callebaut AG (BARN) , the biggest maker of bulk chocolate,

Fritsch , an analyst at Commerzbank AG in  Frankfurt . “Technicals
are also favorable.”  Robusta coffee for September delivery rose 0.3 percent to
