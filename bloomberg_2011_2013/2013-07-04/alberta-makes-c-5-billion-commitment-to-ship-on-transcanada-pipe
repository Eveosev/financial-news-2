Alberta, the Canadian province with
the world’s third-largest crude reserves, made a C$5 billion
($4.75 billion) commitment to ship oil on a pipeline proposed by
 TransCanada Corp. (TRP)  to the Atlantic Coast.  The provincial government booked capacity in March to
transport as much as 100,000 barrels a day on the proposed
Energy East plan that would convert part of TransCanada’s
natural gas mainline into an oil conduit. Tolls paid by the
government would amount to about C$5 billion over 20 years, the
Alberta Energy Department said in a report on its  website .  Canadian producers are backing new pipelines to North
America’s coasts to access higher oil prices. Heavy crude from
 Canada ’s oil sands traded at $15.75 a barrel less than U.S.
crude grade West Texas Intermediate yesterday, according to
 figures compiled  by Bloomberg.  TransCanada is considering whether to proceed with Energy
East, after a successful process to secure commercial support
ended last month, Grady Semmens, a company spokesman, said in an
e-mail today. The pipeline would deliver 850,000 barrels a day
of oil from western Canada to  Quebec  in late 2017, with
shipments to the Atlantic Coast province of New Brunswick
starting in 2018, he said.  Alberta has the third-largest proven oil reserves in the
world, after Saudi Arabia and  Venezuela , according to the
provincial government.  To contact the reporter on this story:
