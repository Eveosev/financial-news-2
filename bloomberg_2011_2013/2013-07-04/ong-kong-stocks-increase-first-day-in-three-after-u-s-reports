Hong Kong  stocks  climbed, with the
benchmark equity index rebounding from two days of declines,
after U.S. labor data beat estimates and China’s government said
fiscal funds should be used to stabilize economic growth.  Li & Fung Ltd. (494) , a supplier of toys and clothes to Wal-Mart
Stores Inc., added 1.1 percent. China Petroleum & Chemical
Corp., the nation’s largest refiner, rose 3.3 percent after oil
prices surged amid unrest in  Egypt .  Biostime International (1112) 
Holdings Ltd., a supplier of infant formula, tumbled 14 percent
after competitors said they plan to cut prices.  The Hang Seng Index increased 1.7 percent to 20,493.42 as
of 11:22 a.m. in Hong Kong, with just five of the gauge’s 50
companies falling. Trading volume on the measure was 26 percent
lower than its 30-day intraday average, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. The  Hang Seng China Enterprises Index (HSCEI)  of
mainland shares climbed 2 percent to 9,073.47.  “Investors are regaining confidence that the U.S. economy
may not be so bad,” said Jackson Wong, vice president of Hong
Kong-based brokerage Tanrich Securities Co. “Before, everyone
was betting on China to boost growth. Now the focus is shifting
back to the U.S.”  The  Hang Seng Index (HSI)  posted its  biggest monthly decline  in
in a year in June, declining 7.1 percent as China’s money-market
rates surged to a record and Federal Reserve Chairman Ben S.
Bernanke said stimulus may be dialed down if the U.S. economy
shows sustained improvement.  Shares on the benchmark gauge  traded  at 9.57 times
estimated earnings yesterday, compared with multiples of 14.65
for the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index and 12.65 for the Stoxx
Europe 600 Index, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  China Slowdown  The Hang Seng China Enterprises Index, also known as the H-share index, capped its worst first half of a year since 2008
last week. The gauge closed 27 percent below its Feb. 1 high
yesterday. The measure trades at 1.07 times the value of net
assets, a level not seen since the 2008 global financial crisis.  Just two of 11 industries on the Hang Seng Composite Index
have advanced this year. Materials and energy companies have led
declines on signs  China ’s economic growth is slowing. Reports
this week showed the country’s industrial expansion in
manufacturing and services is losing pace as the government
seeks to redirect the economy away from exports.  Chinese Premier Li Keqiang said fiscal funds should be used
to redevelop shantytowns and improve basic infrastructure to
stabilize the world’s second-largest economy. Money should be
allocated to transform the structure of the economy to focus
more on domestic consumption, the State Council said in a
statement on its website yesterday.  Growth Outlook  China’s economic growth in the second half may be 7.6%,
according to a State Information Center report published in
China Securities Journal. Goldman Sachs Group Inc., China
International Capital Corp., Barclays Plc and HSBC Holdings Plc
last month pared their China growth projections for this year to
7.4 percent, below the government’s 7.5 percent goal.  Energy companies led  gains  on the Hang Seng Composite
Index. West Texas Intermediate crude traded near the highest
price in 14 months as U.S. stockpiles shrank the most this year
and the ouster of Egypt’s president fanned concern unrest will
disrupt Middle East oil supply.  China Petroleum (386)  jumped 3.3 percent to HK$5.29. Cnooc Ltd.,
China’s biggest offshore oil company, advanced 3.8 percent to
HK$13.02.  U.S. Jobs  Futures on the S&P 500 gained 0.1 percent as the country
celebrates the July 4 holiday. The U.S. benchmark yesterday rose
to the highest level in two weeks on better-than-estimated labor
data as investors watched political developments in Egypt and
Portugal.  Jobless claims decreased to 343,000 in the week ended June
29 from a revised 348,000 in the prior period that was higher
than initially reported, the Labor Department said today in
 Washington . An official report tomorrow will probably show the
U.S. added 165,000 jobs in June.  Li & Fung gained 1.1 percent to HK$11.16.  HSBC Holdings
Plc (5) , which gets a fifth of its revenue from North America,
advanced 1.8 percent to HK$81.25.  Li Ning Co., a sportswear company named after its Olympic
gymnast founder, increased 2.4 percent to HK$3.87 on speculation
its deal with NBA basketball star Dwyane Wade will boost its
brand.  Among stocks that fell, Biostime International tumbled 14
percent to HK$32.25, headed for its steepest two-day drop on
record. Nestle SA and Danone SA said their infant-nutrition
units will charge less in China after the government started
investigating possible pricing and anti-monopoly violations.  Biostine Slumps  Biostime tumbled 20 percent since June 27 through yesterday
after saying one of its units was under investigation for
suspect pricing of infant formula.  AAC Technologies Holdings Inc. (2018) , an acoustic-components
maker, slumped 5.1 percent to HK$40.25 after Jefferies Hong Kong
Ltd. cut its rating to underperform from hold.  Hang Seng Index futures rose 1.6 percent to 20,496. The HSI
Volatility Index slipped 7.3 percent to 22.77, indicating
traders expect a swing of 6.5 percent for the equity benchmark
in the next 30 days.  “The market will continue to be volatile,” said Lewis Wan, Hong Kong-based chief investment officer at Pride
Investments Group Ltd. “I don’t expect there will be a solid
rebound from the current levels, even though valuations have
been very cheap.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
