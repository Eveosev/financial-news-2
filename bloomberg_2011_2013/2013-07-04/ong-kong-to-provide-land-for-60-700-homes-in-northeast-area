Hong Kong’s government will sell land
and build public housing for 60,700 new homes in the city’s
northeast area as part of its plan to help curb property prices
in the world’s most-expensive housing market.  The government plans to have the units in the Fan Ling
North and Kwu Tung North areas completed by the 2022 to 2023
fiscal year, Secretary for Development  Paul Chan  told reporters
in a briefing today. It plans to raise the percentage of public
housing in the areas to 60 percent of the total new supply from
the original 43 percent, he said.  Home prices  have more than doubled since early 2009 on an
influx of mainland Chinese buyers, near record-low  interest
rates  and a lack of new supply. Hong Kong’s Chief Executive
Leung Chun-ying took over in July last year after having pledged
to increase supply to help make housing more affordable for the
general public.  The new homes in the two areas will house about 170,000
people, Chan said.  Leung’s government will provide land to build 75,000 public
homes in the next five years, and the private sector may sell
67,000 units in the next three to four years, he said at his
policy address in January. The city plans to supply 450,000 new
homes over the next 10 years, the  Hong Kong  Economic Journal
reported June 21, citing transport and housing secretary Anthony
Cheung.  To contact the reporter on this story:
