Gold sales from  Australia ’s Perth
Mint, which refines nearly all of the bullion mined in the
country, declined for a second month in June as prices extended
a bear-market slump, deterring buyers.  Sales of gold bars and coins totaled 49,460 ounces in June,
compared with 92,781 ounces in May and 116,755 ounces in April,
according to data from the  mint . Sales were 52,704 ounces in
March, before the rout, the data show.  The slowdown adds to signs that while gold’s plunge
deepened over the second quarter as prices fell to the lowest
since August 2010, a buying frenzy seen in April wasn’t repeated
last month. Bullion lost 23 percent in the three-month period
amid speculation that the  Federal Reserve  will curb its asset-buying program as the  U.S. economy  recovers. Bullion may drop to
$1,050 over 12 months as haven demand wanes, UBS AG said today.  Buyers increased purchases in April “but in May and June
have realized that prices are still coming down and it’s not
doing as well,” Ron Currie, sales and marketing director at the
mint, said in a phone interview from Perth. “They’re waiting to
see how the market goes.”  Bullion for immediate delivery was little changed at
$1,252.19 an ounce at 3:58 p.m. in  Singapore . Prices tumbled 11
percent in June after dropping 6 percent in May and 7.6 percent
in April. Analysts at banks from Morgan Stanley to Goldman Sachs
Group Inc. trimmed gold forecasts last month.  Record Volume  Sales of coins and jewelry surged around the world after
bullion entered a bear market mid-April, spurring a 13 percent
rebound in prices in less than three weeks. The rush drove
volumes on the Shanghai Gold Exchange,  China ’s largest spot
bullion market, to the highest ever in April, bourse data show.  There are signs interest has slowed. The  U.S. Mint  sold
57,000 ounces of American Eagle gold coins in June from 70,000
ounces in May and 209,500 ounces in April, according to  data  on
its website. In  India , the largest user last year, imports may
drop 52 percent in the third quarter after government curbs,
according to the All India Gems & Jewellery Trade Federation.  Global physical demand has been weaker than in April,
partly as India imposed curbs on imports, Barclays Plc said on
July 1. So-called price-sensitive buyers may wait for a well-defined bottom before entering the market,  James Steel , an
analyst at HSBC Securities (USA) Inc., wrote in a June 24 report.  Goldman’s Outlook  Goldman Sachs cut its price target for the end of 2013 to
$1,300 from $1,435 and expects  holdings  in exchange-traded
products to decline by about 1 million ounces (31.1 metric tons)
a month, according to a June 23 report. Investors are assuming
an earlier tapering of quantitative easing and a Fed fund rate
increase sooner than the bank’s economists expect, it said.  Assets in the SPDR Gold Trust, the largest bullion-backed
ETP, were unchanged yesterday after decreasing to 964.69 tons on
July 2, the least since 2009. Investors have sold 595 tons from
ETPs this year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  There’s a risk that ETP holdings may contract by a further
500 tons, Dominic Schnider, head of commodities research at UBS
wealth-management unit in Singapore, said on Bloomberg
Television’s “First Up” with  Rishaad Salamat  today.  Outflows from ETPs combined with so-called positioning cuts
in futures & options will probably increase the availability of
gold by 500 tons to 800 tons in the next six to 12 months,
Schnider and Giovanni Staunovo wrote in a June 20 report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
