Middle-distillate inventories fell
for a third week to the lowest level in more than 30 months in
 Singapore ,  Asia ’s largest oil-trading and storage center,
according to a unit of the Ministry of Trade and Industry.  Onshore supplies including gasoil, or diesel, and kerosene
slid by 662,000 barrels, or 7.8 percent, to 7.8 million in the
seven days ended yesterday,  International Enterprise Singapore 
said in an e-mailed statement today. That’s the lowest since the
week ended Dec. 14, 2011.  Stockpiles of  residual fuels , including  fuel oil  and low-sulfur waxy residue and excluding bitumen, declined 1.5 million
barrels, or 6.8 percent, to 19.9 million, according to the data.
That’s the lowest level in eight weeks.  Light-distillate inventories including naphtha, gasoline
and reformate rose 308,000 barrels, or 3.5 percent, to 9.2
million, according to the data. Supplies climbed a third week to
a four-week high.  The trade ministry surveys refiners, traders and storage
terminals on a voluntary basis. The results may exclude offshore
storage capacity, International Enterprise said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
