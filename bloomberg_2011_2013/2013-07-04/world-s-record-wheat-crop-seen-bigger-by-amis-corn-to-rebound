Global wheat production, already seen
climbing to a record, will be higher than predicted last month
on good prospects in all major growers except the U.S.,
according to the Agricultural Market Information System.  Farmers worldwide will reap 704 million metric tons of the
grain in 2013-14 from 659 million tons in 2012-13, according to
an  online report  from Rome-based AMIS, which was set up by Group
of 20 countries. The outlook was raised by 2 million tons.  Wheat traded in  Chicago , a global benchmark, fell 15
percent this year on a rebound in production after drought cut
harvests across the Northern Hemisphere last year. The European
Union, the biggest grower, today forecast a wheat harvest of
138.8 million tons this year from 134.3 million tons in 2012.  “Bigger harvests are expected to result in a significant
increase in world cereal stocks,” AMIS wrote. “More ample
supplies could result in lower and more stable prices in 2013-14
compared to 2012-13.’”  Wheat estimates were raised for the EU and the countries in
the former  Soviet Union , according to Abdolreza Abbassian, a
senior economist at the  United Nations ’ Food & Agriculture
Organization who helps compile the AMIS report.  Wheat stockpiles may climb to 169 million tons from 162
million tons in 2012-13, with the outlook for inventories at the
end of the season cut by 4 million tons on lower beginning
stocks and increased consumption, according to the report.  Global corn production is predicted to jump to 972 million
tons from 874 million tons, 9 million tons more than forecast
last month on higher forecast for Argentina and  Brazil .
Consumption will rise to 931 million tons from 884 million tons
on higher feed and industrial use, AMIS said.  Corn ending stocks in 2013-14 may expand to 175 million
tons from 136 million tons, the report showed.  The global  rice  crop may be 500 million tons from 491
million tons in 2012-13, lifting ending stocks of the grain to
182 million tons from 174 million tons, according to the report,
which left the stocks estimate unchanged from June.  To contact the reporter on this story:
