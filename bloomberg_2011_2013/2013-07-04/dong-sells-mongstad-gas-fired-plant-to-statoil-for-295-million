Dong Energy AS said it sold its
Norwegian Mongstad gas-fired power plant to  Statoil ASA. (STL)   Dong agreed to sell the heat and power plant Energiverk
Mongstad in western  Norway  for 1.8 billion kroner ($295
million), the Danish company said in a statement today. The deal
is expected to close in the third quarter.  Stavanger-based Statoil’s facilities at Mongstad also
include the largest refinery in Norway. It has an annual
capacity of about 12 million tons of crude oil that’s exported
to North America, Europe and Asia.  Dong said the transaction is expected to result in a pretax
loss of 150 million Danish kroner ($26.1 million).  “With the divestment of Mongstad, we are taking another
significant step towards the realization of our financial action
plan,” Henrik Poulsen, chief executive officer at Dong, said in
a statement. “We have now divested a total of approximately 9
billion Danish kroner of non-core activities.”  Statoil spokesmen weren’t immediately available to comment
on the transaction.  To contact the reporter on this story:
