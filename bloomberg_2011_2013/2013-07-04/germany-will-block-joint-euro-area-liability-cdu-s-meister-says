Germany  will block any attempt to
introduce shared euro-area debt or a bank resolution fund, said
Michael Meister, the deputy caucus leader of  Chancellor Angela Merkel ’s party, citing the burden on German taxpayers.  “A transfer union simply isn’t feasible with us” now or
in the future, Meister, a Christian Democratic Union lawmaker,
said in an e-mailed statement. “Protection of German taxpayers
will continue to be a central policy goal for us.”  Less than three months before Merkel seeks a third term in
German elections, Meister’s rejection of joint euro-area bonds
and bills, a European debt-redemption fund, a joint bank
resolution fund and shared  deposit insurance  aimed to blunt a
European Commission initiative to study pooling  Europe ’s debt.  Merkel, whose handling of the euro-area debt crisis helped
make her Germany’s most popular politician, has consistently
rejected joint debt as an easy way out that distracts from the
need to curb spending and overhaul the bloc’s weaker economies.  European Commission President  Jose Barroso  said yesterday
that an expert group will examine a possible debt-redemption
fund and joint issuance of short-term euro bills. The group, led
by former European Central Bank council member Gertrude Tumpel-Gugerell, will deliver a report by March 2014.  “One can only wonder what motivated the European
Commission to take this step,” Meister said. “Most of all, a
transfer union wouldn’t make Europe more competitive. That has
to be the EU commission’s main focus.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
