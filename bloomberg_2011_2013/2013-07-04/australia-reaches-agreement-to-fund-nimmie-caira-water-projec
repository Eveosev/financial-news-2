An agreement has been reached to help
fund a water project in the Nimmie-Caira area of the Lower
Murrumbidgee floodplain, Australia Federal Minister for the
Environment Mark Butler and New South Wales Minister for Primary
Industries Katrina Hodgkinson said.  The Australian government agreed to provide A$180 million
($165 million) to New South Wales to purchase water and land
entitlements from 11 property owners in the Nimmie-Caira and for
the state to start infrastructure works and develop lasting
land-management arrangements, they said in a statement.  The funds will provide enduring benefits to the largest
remaining area of wetland in the floodplain, help reconfigure a
water-delivery system and protect environmental assets, the
ministers said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
