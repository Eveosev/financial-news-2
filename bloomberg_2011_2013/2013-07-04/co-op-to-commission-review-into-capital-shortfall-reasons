Co-Operative Group Ltd., whose assets
range from supermarkets to funeral homes, will start a review of
how its banking unit accumulated a capital shortfall of 1.5
billion pounds ($2.3 billion).  Customer-owned Co-Op, whose banking unit earlier this year
abandoned a bid to buy branches from  Lloyds Banking Group Plc (LLOY) ,
will appoint a leader for the study soon and update its members
next year, according to a person briefed on the process who
asked not to be identified as the details are not yet public.  The Co-Operative Bank Plc will swap some debt for equity
and sell shares on the London Stock Exchange to plug a capital
hole, it said last month. It plans to raise 1 billion pounds by
asking existing bondholders to exchange subordinated debt for
new equity and senior debt, and a further 500 million pounds
through the sale of insurance assets.  “The Co-operative Group and Bank can confirm that an
independent inquiry will be set up to examine the events that
led to the capital action plan announcement” on June 17, the
lender said in an e-mailed statement today. “Further details
will be announced in due course.”  The focus of the study will be the purchase of Britannia
Building Society in 2009 and the aborted purchase earlier this
year of the 632 Lloyds branches, known as Verde.  The Financial Times reported the news earlier today.  -- Editors: Simone Meier, Edward Evans  To contact the reporter on this story:
