Argentina owes itself more money than
ever as President  Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner  squeezes pesos
out of public institutions from the pension agency to the
lottery, a decade after losing its access to overseas financing.  Led by the central bank, government institutions are now
the nation’s largest creditors, having lent the Treasury $115
billion as of the end of 2012, according to an Economy Ministry
report published July 2. That’s equal to 58 percent of
Argentina’s total debt. The proportion  climbed  from 53 percent
in 2011 and is double the $57.5 billion that Argentina owes
private creditors.  Fernandez, 60, is ratcheting up internal borrowing to avoid
paying more than 14.53 percent for dollars abroad, the highest
rate among emerging-market bond issuers tracked by JPMorgan
Chase & Co. The debt program is adding to the world’s third-highest inflation rate as Fernandez orders the central bank to
swell the  money supply  at a 30 percent annual pace to stuff
institutions with the cash she needs to borrow.  “They swapped creditors,”  Camilo Tiscornia , a former
central bank economist who now runs research company C&T
Asesores Economicos, said in a phone interview from  Buenos
Aires . “It’s unsustainable in the long term because this policy
is inflationary. They’ll eventually need to cut spending or
devalue.”  Record Debt  Argentina’s total debt jumped to a record in 2012 of $197.5
billion, surpassing the previous high of $191.3 billion in 2004,
the year before the nation restructured debt left over from its
$95 billion default in 2001.  Adrian Cosentino, the Argentine finance secretary, told
reporters on July 2 that the report shows the “positive
evolution of the level, composition and sustainability of our
debt.”  Debt to public institutions makes up 58 percent of the
total, while private-sector obligations and money owed to
multilateral and bilateral lenders makes up 29 percent and 12.8
percent, respectively, according to the report. Argentina’s debt
is 48 percent in U.S. dollars, 23 percent in pesos, 18 percent
in inflation-linked peso bonds and 10 percent in euros.  Reserves Raid  Unable to borrow in  capital markets  abroad, Fernandez has
drawn down about $30 billion of  central bank reserves  to pay
foreign debt since changing the central bank charter in 2010.
Reserves have tumbled 29 percent to $37.2 billion from a record
$52.6 billion in 2011.  The government has sold peso and dollar-denominated notes
to the central bank, state pensions fund Anses, Banco de la
Nacion Argentina and even to a port operator and lottery company
to finance spending in the past year. The central bank’s
holdings of government debt jumped 39 percent the week ending
June 15 from a year earlier to $38 billion, or 20 percent of the
country’s total debt.  Argentina, which had to print pesos in  Brazil  in 2011 due
to shortages of bills, began to print a second series of 100-peso notes with former first lady Evita Peron’s image this week,
according to a central bank official. The bank will print 100
million new notes to go along with the 2.2 billion 100-peso
bills in circulation.  Evita, who died in 1952, once said she would return
multiplied by millions, according to Fernandez.  Peso Flood  The nation has added 24 percent more bills of the highest
denomination in the past year, according to central bank data,
while the number of  pesos in circulation  has grown 32 percent in
the past year to 493.6 billion pesos ($91.4 billion).  The peso has lost 16 percent in the past 12 months to
5.3980. The pace of depreciation for the currency still outpaces
estimated annual inflation of 24 percent.  Still,  Argentina  can devalue the peso in the future to
lower internal debt levels.  The extra yield investors demand to hold Argentine
government dollar bonds instead of U.S. Treasuries fell two
basis points, or 0.02 percentage points, to 1,203 basis points
at 12:47 p.m. in Buenos Aires, according to JPMorgan Chase & Co.  It’s typically better for a country to hold its debt
internally rather than in the hands of foreign investors,
according to Bianca Taylor, senior sovereign analyst at Loomis,
Sayles & Company in  Boston .  “When you have a period of volatility, levered investors
are often forced to dump their positions,” Taylor said in an e-mail response to questions. “Areas where foreign investors hold
a smaller share of the outstanding debt generally bodes well for
the credit during downturns.”  ‘Future Generations’  Private creditors hold $57.5 billion of Argentine debt, or
13.1 percent of GDP, according to the  Economy Ministry .  Saddling the pensions system with government debt that may
lose value in the future is a risky policy, said Eduardo Hecker,
former head of the securities regulator between 2006 and 2009,
who now runs the DEL consultancy in Buenos Aires.  “This policy raises concerns that Argentina has adopted a
strategy of highly indebting future generations,” Hecker said
in a telephone interview. “We may not see the full effect of
this policy for another 10 to 20 years.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
