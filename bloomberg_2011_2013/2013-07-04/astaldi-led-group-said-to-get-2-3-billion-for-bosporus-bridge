An Astaldi SpA-led group building a
1.3 kilometer (0.8 mile) bridge over the Bosporus in Turkey
raised $2.3 billion of project financing, according to three
people with knowledge of the matter.  The consortium obtained the 10-year debt from seven Turkish
banks to back construction of the crossing and 60 kilometers of
associated roads, said the people, who asked not to be
identified because the discussions are private. The banks are
 Turkiye Garanti Bankasi AS (GARAN) ,  Turkiye Is Bankasi AS (ISCTR) ,  Turkiye
Vakiflar Bankasi TAO (VAKBN) , TC Ziraat Bankasi AS,  Turkiye Halk Bankasi
AS (HALKB) ,  Akbank TAS (AKBNK)  and  Yapi & Kredi Bankasi AS. (YKBNK)   The Turkish government chose the consortium, which also
includes IC Ictas Insaat Sanayi & Ticaret AS of Turkey, last
year for the $3 billion project to construct a third bridge over
the Bosporus waterway that divides Istanbul. The companies have
10 years to construct and operate the bridge and toll roads,
according to bid documents.  Banks are due to sign the financing later this month with
repayments beginning after a two-year grace period, the people
said. Construction of the bridge began in May with Turkish Prime
Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan asking for the project to complete
by May 2015.  Officials at IC Ictas and Astaldi in  Turkey  declined to
comment on the financing. Akbank, Garanti Bankasi and Is Bankasi
spokesmen didnâ€™t answer phone calls seeking comment. Halk
Bankasi, Vakiflar Bankasi, Ziraat Bankasi, Vakiflar Bankasi and
Yapi Kredi officials declined to comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
