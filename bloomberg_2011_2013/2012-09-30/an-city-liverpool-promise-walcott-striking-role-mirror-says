Manchester City  and Liverpool will
promise to play Theo Walcott in his preferred role as a striker
as they attempt to sign the England international from Arsenal,
the Sunday Mirror  reported .   Walcott has yet to agree to a new contract at Arsenal and
his current deal runs out at the end of the season. He wants to
remain with the Gunners, but manager Arsene Wenger is ready to
sell in January if the matter is not resolved, the newspaper
said, without citing anyone.   Wenger has told the 23-year-old winger to be patient over
his desire to play as a striker, while the club is unwilling to
increase its 80,000 pounds a week ($129,400) contract offer, the
Mirror reported.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
