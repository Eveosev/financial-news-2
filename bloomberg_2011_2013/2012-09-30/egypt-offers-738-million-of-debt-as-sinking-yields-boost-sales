Egypt  will offer 4.5 billion
Egyptian pounds ($738 million) of treasury bills today as the
government takes advantage of the lowest borrowing costs in more
than a year to raise funds to cover the budget deficit.  The North African country will sell 1 billion pounds of
 three-month securities  and 3.5 billion pounds of  nine-month
notes , according to central bank data on Bloomberg. It sold
similar-maturity bills at 12.4 percent and 13.35 percent last
week.  Stronger demand for government debt on the back of
increased political stability and foreign aid pledges helped
reduce near-record  one-year yields  over the last month. The rate
fell to a 12-month low of 13.59 percent at a Sept. 27 auction,
helping the government raise 6 billion pounds of the notes, the
most in a single sale since Bloomberg started tracking the data
in 2006.  The government is seeking to raise 150 billion pounds at
local debt auctions this quarter after selling 169.3 billion
pounds in the previous three months, excluding 513.3 million
euros ($660 million) in one-year treasury bills. The  budget
deficit  for the year that ends in June may exceed the
government’s target of 7.6 percent of economic output, Finance
Minister Momtaz el-Saieed said last month. The ratio reached 11
percent last fiscal year.  The yield on the nation’s 5.75 percent dollar bonds due in
2020 increased 30 basis points, or 0.3 of a percentage point,
last week to 5.82 percent on Sept. 28. The pound, subject to a
managed float, retreated 0.1 percent to 6.0989 a dollar.  To contact the reporter on this story:
