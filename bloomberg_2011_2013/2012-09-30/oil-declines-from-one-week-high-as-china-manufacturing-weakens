Oil dropped from the highest close in
a week in New York as manufacturing contracted unexpectedly in
China, raising speculation that fuel demand may decline in the
world’s second-biggest crude consumer.  Futures slid as much as 1 percent after capping the biggest
quarterly gain since December on Sept. 28. China’s Purchasing
Managers’ Index was 49.8 in September, the government said
today. That compares with the median forecast of 50.1 in a
Bloomberg survey. An index from HSBC Holdings Plc and Markit
Economics showed an 11th contraction. Data released later today
is expected to show U.S. output shrank a fourth month.  “China PMI was not so good,” said  Ken Hasegawa , a sales
manager at Newedge Group in  Tokyo . “Eleven straight months of
negative numbers has had some bearish impact on oil prices.”  Crude for November delivery fell as much as 93 cents to
$91.26 a barrel in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile
Exchange and was at $91.50 at 2:31 p.m. Singapore time. It
climbed 0.4 percent on Sept. 28 to $92.19, the highest close
since Sept. 21. Prices rose 8.5 percent in the third quarter.  Brent oil for November settlement dropped 53 cents to
$111.86 a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures Europe
exchange. The European benchmark grade’s premium to New York
crude was at $20.37, after closing at a six-week high of $20.20
on Sept. 28.  China Manufacturing  Oil’s decline in New York may stall along its 100-day
moving average, at $90.10 a barrel today, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. Futures last week rebounded after falling
to this indicator. Buy orders tend to be clustered near
technical-support levels.  China ’s manufacturing shrank for a second month for the
first time since 2009, the National Bureau of Statistics and
China Federation of Logistics and Purchasing said today. The
report added to signs that growth is at risk of reaching a 22-
year low as the ruling Communist Party prepares to begin
installing a new generation of leaders next month.  OPEC production fell the most in 18 months in September,
led by reductions in Angola and Nigeria, a Bloomberg survey
showed. Output in the 12-member Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries slipped 454,000 barrels, or 1.4 percent, to
an average 31.979 million barrels a day last month from a
revised 32.433 million in August, according to the survey of oil
companies, producers and analysts.  ‘Well-Supplied’  The oil market is well supplied and there’s no scarcity,
OPEC’s secretary-general, Abdalla El-Badri, said in a speech in
Berlin on Sept. 28. September output in  Iran , the group’s third-
biggest producer, climbed 100,000 barrels a day to 2.85 million,
according to the survey. August production dropped to 2.75
million barrels a day, the lowest level since February 1990.  Sanctions aimed at stopping the Islamic republic’s nuclear
program have hindered its ability to export crude. A European
Union ban on the purchase, transport, financing and insurance of
Iranian oil went into effect on July 1.  New York oil prices advanced a second day on Sept. 28 after
the White House said President  Barack Obama  and Israeli Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu are in “full agreement” on
preventing Iran from getting a nuclear weapon.  Money managers reduced  wagers  on rising prices for the
first time in six weeks, cutting net-long positions by 17
percent in the seven days ended Sept. 25, according to the
Commodity Futures Trading Commission’s Commitments of Traders
report on Sept. 28. It was the biggest reduction since May 8.  To contact the reporters on this story:
