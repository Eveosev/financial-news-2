Geno Smith threw for eight
touchdowns to tie a Big 12 record as the ninth-ranked West
Virginia University defeated No. 25 Baylor University 70-63 in
the highest scoring game ever in the college football
conference.  In other Top 10-ranked schools on the Associated Press
Writers’ Poll, it was No. 1 Alabama 33, Mississippi 14; No. 2
Oregon 51, Washington State 26; No. 3 Louisiana State 38, Towson
22; No. 4 Florida State 30, South Florida 17; No. 5 Georgia 51,
Tennessee 44; and No. 6 South Carolina 38, Kentucky 17.  West Virginia, which snapped Baylor’s nine-game winning
streak, moved to the Big 12 from the Big East this season.  “It did feel like one of those classic Texas shootouts,”
said Smith. “That’s kind of what the Big 12 is about.”  Smith, a senior, completed 45 of 51 passing attempts for
656 yards. He had more touchdown passes than incomplete throws
for the Mountaineers (4-0).  “I could care less about a Heisman Trophy,” said Smith
who had his best game ever statistically. “The big thing for us
was that we won the game today. We’re on a mission, and we want
to win them all.”  Baylor quarterback Nick Florence threw for five touchdowns
and broke Heisman Trophy-winning Robert Griffin III’s school
record with 581 yards passing at Mountaineer Field in
Morgantown, West Virginia.  ‘Little Short’  “We expect to score that many points a game,” Florence
said. “But the goal is to score more than our opponent and we
came up a little short today.”  Baylor’s Terrance Williams set a Big 12 record with 314
yards receiving three minutes after West Virginia’s Stedman
Bailey set a new mark with 303 yards. Williams caught two
touchdown passes and Bailey had five scoring receptions.  West Virginia (3-1) also collected a school record 807
yards. Overall, the teams combined for 1,507 yards of offense
and 67 first downs, while six receivers tallied a game of at
least 100 yards.  In the Atlantic Coast Conference, Stephen Morris threw a
conference-record 566 yards and five touchdowns in Miami’s 44-37
victory over North Carolina State (3-2). Morris completed 26 of
50 passing attempts for Miami (4-1), which recorded 652 yards of
offense.  To contact the reporter on this story:
