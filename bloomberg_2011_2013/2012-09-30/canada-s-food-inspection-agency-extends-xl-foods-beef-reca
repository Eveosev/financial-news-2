Canada’s food inspection agency
extended its recall of raw beef products on concerns of E.coli
contamination.  The Canadian Food Inspection Agency said affected products
have manufacturing dates of Aug. 24, 27, 28, 29 and Sept. 5, the
same dates as previously recalled ground beef products from XL
Foods Inc., the government department said today in a statement.
The CFIA on Sept. 28 issued a warning on the XL Foods as part of
a voluntary recall.  There have been four E. coli illnesses associated with the
consumption of beef products originating from XL Foods, CFIA
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
