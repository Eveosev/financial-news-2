Justin Rose  of England beat  Phil
Mickelson  during the final-day singles at the Ryder Cup, golfâ€™s
premier team competition.  The result ties the U.S. and Europe at 11 points each.
Rose won the final hole at Medinah Country Club outside Chicago
to seal the point for his team.  The U.S. needs 14 1/2 points to regain the trophy, while
Europe requires 14 points to retain the title it won two years
ago.   After beginning the final day trailing 10-6, Europe needs
to match the biggest comeback in Ryder Cup history to log its
seventh win in nine editions. The U.S. won the 1999 edition at
Brookline, Massachusetts, after trailing 10-6 going into the 12
singles matches.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
