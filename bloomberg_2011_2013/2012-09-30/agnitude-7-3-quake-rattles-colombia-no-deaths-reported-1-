An earthquake with a magnitude of
7.3 hit near the city of Popayan in southwest Colombia today at
a depth of 162 kilometers (100 miles), the U.S. Geological
Survey said.  Colombia’s government said no injuries have been reported
from the temblor, which took place at 11:31 a.m. local time,
Bogota-based broadcaster RCN Noticias reported, citing Jaime
Raigosa, who coordinates the country’s seismological network.  The depth of the quake may have blunted its impact, RCN
reported. The temblor damaged some homes in western Colombia,
the broadcaster said.  Tremors lasting as long as one minute were felt in Bogota,
Cali, Medellin and other major cities in the South American
country, according to reports on Bogota-based newspaper El
Tiempo’s website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
