Japan Airlines Co. (9201)  canceled more
domestic flights as typhoon Jelawat passed through Tokyo and
tracked near northern  Japan , packing winds gusting to 210
kilometers (130 miles) per hour.  The airline decided to cancel 55 domestic flights as of 5
a.m. today, affecting about 7,280 passengers, according to a
faxed statement. The typhoon led to flight cancellations at
Japan Airlines and  All Nippon Airways Co. (9202)  yesterday, disrupting
air traffic for tens of thousands of people.  The storm is expected to reach about 210 kilometers east of
Kushiro on the coast of Hokkaido, Japan’s northernmost
prefecture, around noon local time, according to the  Japan
Meteorological Agency ’s website. The agency has maintained rain
and flood warnings for some northeastern coastal prefectures.  All Nippon said on its  website  it may cancel flights to
Kushiro and Nakashibetsu in Hokkaido today.  While train services in the northeastern Tohoku area are
still seeing disruptions, trains in the Kanto area that includes
 Tokyo  resumed normal operations as of 7 a.m., according to East
Japan Railway Co.’s  website .  The storm left 1 dead and 169 injured as it rolled over
Okinawa and continued up the middle of Japan’s main island of
Honshu, passing just west of Tokyo, public broadcaster NHK
reported. Most bullet train service had returned to normal as
the storm headed out to sea off Honshu’s northeast coast, NHK
said.  More than 20 people in Okinawa were injured by broken glass
due to the typhoon, according to local police.  To contact the reporters on this story:
