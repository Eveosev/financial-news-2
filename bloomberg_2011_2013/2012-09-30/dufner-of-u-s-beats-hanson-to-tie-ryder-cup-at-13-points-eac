Jason Dufner  beat  Peter Hanson  of
Sweden during the final-day singles at the Ryder Cup, golfâ€™s
premier team competition.  The result ties the U.S. and Europe on 13 points each with
two matches still to finish. Dufner won by two holes at Medinah
Country Club outside Chicago.  The U.S. needs 14 1/2 points to win the trophy, while
Europe requires 14 points to retain the title it won two years
ago.   After beginning the final day trailing 10-6, Europe needs
to match the biggest comeback in Ryder Cup history to log its
seventh win in nine editions. The U.S. won the 1999 edition at
Brookline, Massachusetts, after trailing 10-6 going into the 12
singles matches.  Steve Stricker  is tied with Martin Kaymer of Germany
through 16 holes, while Tiger Woods, in the final match, is tied
with Francesco Molinari of Italy with three holes to play. Each
team gets a half point for a drawn match.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
