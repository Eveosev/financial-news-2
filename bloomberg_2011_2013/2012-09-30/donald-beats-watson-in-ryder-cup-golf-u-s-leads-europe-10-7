Luke Donald  of  England  beat Bubba
Watson in the final-day singles at the Ryder Cup, golfâ€™s premier
team competition.  The U.S. leads Europe 10-7 in total points. Donald won 2-
and-1, meaning he led by two holes with one to play at Medinah
Country Club outside Chicago.  The U.S. needs 14 1/2 points to regain the trophy, while
Europe requires 14 points to retain the title it won two years
ago.   After beginning the final day trailing 10-6, Europe needs
to match the biggest comeback in Ryder Cup history to log its
seventh win in nine editions. The U.S. won the 1999 edition at
Brookline, Massachusetts, after trailing 10-6 going into the 12
singles matches.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
