Typhoon Jelawat disrupted air
traffic for tens of thousands of people as it approached the
central Japan city of Nagoya today, packing winds gusting to 216
kilometers (134 miles) per hour.  All Nippon Airways Co. (9202)  canceled 273 domestic flights
affecting more than 43,000 passengers, the airline said in a
faxed statement. Japan Air said it canceled 128 domestic flights
affecting almost 25,000 passengers.  The storm was about 250 kilometers southwest of Nagoya, the
hub of the nation’s third-largest metropolitan region, as of
1:45 p.m. local time, the  Japan Meteorological Agency  said on
its website. The storm was moving northeast at about 45
kilometers per hour.  Jelawat’s maximum wind velocity will probably be about 40
kilometers per hour when it makes landfall along the central
Japan coast this evening, Kenji Okada, a forecaster at the
agency, said by phone.  Rain and flood warnings were issued by the agency for
coastal prefectures from the Tokyo region to the island of
Shikoku as Jelawat approached. Residents in hilly regions were
told to be alert for possible landslides due to downpours.  More than 20 people in Okinawa were injured by broken glass
due to the typhoon yesterday, according to local police.  To contact the reporters on this story:
