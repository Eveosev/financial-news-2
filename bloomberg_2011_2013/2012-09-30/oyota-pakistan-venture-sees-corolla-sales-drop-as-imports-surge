Toyota Motor Corp. (7203) ’s  Pakistan  venture
expects demand for its best-selling Corolla to fall from last
year’s record, hurting profit, as used-car imports rise.  “The problem of used cars is absolutely enormous,” Parvez Ghias, chief executive officer of the Karachi-based unit Indus
Motor Co., said in a Sept. 28 interview. “This will have a very
significant dent on profits.” He declined to give an estimate
of how much profit and sales might be affected.  Pakistani consumers are shunning locally assembled vehicles
including the Corollas Indus makes because used imports cost
less and are available in a greater variety of models. In
January 2011, the government increased the age of used cars
allowed to be shipped into the country from 3 to 5 years,
encouraging imports and hurting local sales.  The price of locally made cars has increased 15 percent in
the past year because of the increase in steel prices in  Japan 
and the rupee-yen disparity, said Atif Zafar, an analyst at JS
Global Capital Ltd. The market share of imported cars may grow
to 30 percent from 24 percent in the year started July, he said.  Net income  rose 59 percent at Indus to a record 4.3 billion
rupees ($45.3 million) in the year ended June on a surge in
sales of the Corolla, compared with 2.74 billion rupees a year
earlier. Toyota’s Corolla has been Pakistan’s biggest selling
car since 2008 when it over took Suzuki Motor Corp.’s Mehran
hatchback, according to the Pakistan Automotive Manufacturers
Association.  Indus, which has gained 26 percent this year in Karachi
trading, fell 0.5 percent to 255 rupees as of the Sept. 28 close.
The benchmark  KSE100 Index (KSE100)  has risen 39 percent this year.  Used Imports  Pakistan used car imports jumped threefold to 56,000 units
in the year ended June from 18,000 a year earlier, said H.M.
Shahzad, chairman of the All Pakistan Motor Dealers Association.  Indus will produce 10,500 cars in the quarter ended Sept.
30 against a target of 15,000. The company produced 53,000 cars
last year, according to Ghias. Sales may fall to 44,000 units in
the year ending June, he estimates.  Pakistani importers are lobbying the government to increase
the age limit for imported cars to seven years, Shahzad said,
while Indus Motor and rival assemblers have said the age should
be restricted to three years.  “We’ve spoken with the deputy prime minister who is also
the minister for  industries  and we are hopeful the government
will reverse the decision,” Ghias said. “Since July, we shut
down the plant for 15 days and may have another 15 days shutdown
by December.”  Indus will introduce the Fortuner sport-utility vehicle in
March and expects to sell as many as 2,500 units a year, Ghias
said. The company is also testing a Corolla hybrid for possible
sale in Pakistan, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
