Rights groups condemned what they
said was the forced migration of Christian families living near
Egypt’s border with  Israel  after they were intimidated by
Islamist militants.  The National Council for  Human Rights  said nine families
living in Rafah in North Sinai left their homes on Sept. 28
after militants made death threats and two armed men riding a
motorcycle opened fire on a Coptic-owned shop on Sept. 26.  Prime Minister Hisham Qandil said yesterday he was aware
that one family had decided to relocate and that there was no
“forced evacuation” of Copts from the Sinai, according to the
state-run MENA news agency. “Egyptian authorities are to
protect the Coptic brothers wherever they may be,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
