U.S. stock futures slipped,
signaling the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index may extend losses
following its worst weekly drop since June. Oil and gold fell.  Futures on the  S&P 500 Index  expiring in December were down
0.2 percent at 1,431.80 as of 6:22 p.m. in New York. Gold for
immediate delivery decreased 0.2 percent to $1,768.55 an ounce
and oil slipped 0.5 percent to $91.74 a barrel after last week
touching a two-month low. The  Dollar Index (DXY) , a gauge of the
currency against six major peers, was little changed at 79.94.  The S&P 500 lost 1.3 percent to 1,440.67 last week amid
concern  Europe ’s debt crisis may worsen and stimulus measures
may not be enough to boost economic growth.  China ’s manufacturing contracted for an 11th straight
month, a private survey found, increasing pressure on the
government to bolster growth in the world’s second-largest
economy. The purchasing managers’ index from HSBC Holdings Plc
and Markit Economics was at 47.9 for September from 47.6 in
August. Export orders declined at the fastest pace in 42 months
and purchasing activity in manufacturing fell for a fifth month,
the Sept. 29 report showed.  An Oct. 5 Labor Department report is forecast to show the
U.S. jobless rate rose to 8.2 percent last month from 8.1
percent in August, according to the median forecast of 62
economists surveyed by Bloomberg. Payrolls increased by 115,000
in September, less than the 139,000 average over the first eight
months of the year, the report may also show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
