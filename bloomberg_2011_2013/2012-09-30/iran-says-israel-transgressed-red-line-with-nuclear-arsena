The world should speak out against
Israel’s nuclear arsenal rather than setting a “red line” for
Iran, the Persian Gulf country’s defense minister was cited as
saying by the state-run  Iranians Students News Agency .  “If having a nuclear bomb is overstepping the red line,
then the Zionist regime with its tens of nuclear warheads has
long transgressed it,” the agency cited Defense Minister
Brigadier General Ahmad Vahidi as saying yesterday.  Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in a speech
at the United Nations on Sept. 27 that the international
community must impose “red lines” on Iran’s uranium enrichment
program to prevent the country from attaining nuclear weapons.  Netanyahu and his Defense Minister Ehud Barak have
indicated that as Iran proceeds with its nuclear program, which
the U.S. and its allies say could conceal the development of
nuclear weapons, Israel may consider a strike against the
Persian Gulf country’s nuclear facilities.  Iran, which has signed the nuclear Non-Proliferation
Treaty, says its nuclear program is for civilian purposes.  Is Israel, which threatens to attack, more dangerous than
Iran, “which doesn’t have nuclear weapons, favors nuclear
disarmament and is seeking peaceful nuclear energy within
international regulations?” Vahidi was cited as saying in the
ISNA report.  Israel doesn’t confirm or deny possession of nuclear
weapons. The London-based  International Institute for Strategic
Studies  estimates that Israel has as many as 200 nuclear
warheads.  To contact the reporter on this story:
