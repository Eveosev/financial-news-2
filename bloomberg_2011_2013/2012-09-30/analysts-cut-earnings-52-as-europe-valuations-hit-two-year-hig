Analysts are lowering estimates for
European earnings growth by 52 percent, clashing with investors
whose confidence in the European Central Bank helped send equity
valuations to a 2 1/2-year high.  While the  Euro Stoxx 50 Index (SX5E)  surged 25 percent over the
past four months, matching the three biggest rallies in the past
decade, more than 12,000 estimates compiled by Bloomberg show
net income will grow 13 percent next year, down from the 27
percent forecast in January. The gauge closed Sept. 28 at 9.5
times  projected 2013 profit , near the highest since April 2010.  Bears say declining estimates for companies from  Daimler AG (DAI) 
to UniCredit SpA show analysts doubt  Europe ’s economy will
strengthen and that stocks have risen too far, too fast. Bulls
say valuations can climb more as the program of unlimited bond
purchases unveiled last month by ECB President Mario Draghi will
limit government borrowing costs and give debt-laden nations the
chance to fix their economies and preserve the euro.  “My central case would be we are at the top of a range now
and now is a time to own less rather than more,” Luke Ellis,
chief executive officer of Man Group Plc’s $19.5 billion fund-
of-hedge-fund business, said at a presentation in  London  on
Sept. 25. “The chances are we go back down from here.”  Debt Crisis  Concern the debt crisis, now in its third year, is not yet
solved helped send the Euro Stoxx 50 down 4.8 percent last week,
paring its 2012 gain to 5.9 percent. The gauge rose 1.8 percent
to 2,498.81 today. At the start of this year, analysts  projected 
companies in the index would earn 293 euros a share in 2013,
compared with 231 euros in 2011, estimates compiled by Bloomberg
show. The forecast growth over the two years had fallen by 52
percent to 261 euros by Sept. 26, the data show.  The decline in equities last week trimmed the Euro Stoxx 50
Index’s price to 9.5 times estimated 2013 earnings, from a 2
1/2-year high of 10 times on Sept. 14. The  Standard & Poor’s 500
Index (SPX)  is trading at 12.5 times 2013 forecasts, while the MSCI
Asia Pacific Index trades at 11.2 times.  “We have seen a pretty good run up but it has been based
more on quantitative easing and intervention,” Peter Garnry, an
equities strategist at Saxo Bank A/S in Copenhagen, said in a
Sept. 25 phone interview. “When you look at the fundamentals,
they are not following up. The downside is larger than the
upside.”  Business Confidence  Euro-area services and manufacturing output as well as
German  business confidence  unexpectedly dropped to the lowest
levels in more than 2 1/2 years in September. The median
prediction for 2013 gross domestic product growth in the 17-
nation euro area has slipped to 0.4 percent from 1.1 percent in
January and 2.1 percent in March 2011, according to forecasts
from 46 economists compiled by Bloomberg.  While government debt in the region has risen to 88 percent
of gross domestic product in the first quarter of this year from
70 percent in 2004, the ECB’s rescue efforts are convincing
investors to add to euro-area stocks.  A net 1 percent of money managers had a so-called
overweight allocation in European shares last month, according
to a Bank of America Corp. survey published Sept. 18. That was
the first time participants, who together oversee $524 billion,
have owned more of the region’s equities than are represented in
global benchmark indexes since April 2011.  Flows into European stocks funds based in the U.S. reached
$2.86 billion in the two weeks ended Sept. 19, according to
Cambridge, Massachusetts-based EPFR Global, the most since May.  Bond Buying  Draghi, who pledged on July 26 to do “whatever it takes”
to save the euro, unveiled an unlimited bond-buying program on
Sept. 6 to bring down borrowing costs and protect the euro. A
week later, the Fed introduced a third round of asset purchases
known as quantitative easing. The Euro Stoxx 50 surged to
2,594.56 on Sept. 14 from 2,068.66 on June 1, matching gains
over comparable periods in October and June 2009 and June 2003,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Equity valuations will probably climb as investors who
missed the gains try to catch up, said Graham Bishop, a
strategist at Exane BNP Paribas in London.  “Participation so far has been low and additional monetary
easing measures seem to be announced on a daily basis,” Bishop
wrote in a report dated Sept. 21.  For Tristan Hanson at Ashburton Ltd. in  Jersey , the Channel
Islands, stocks are cheap compared with other assets. Companies
in the Euro Stoxx 50 pay on average 4.81 percent of their share
price back to investors in earnings, topping the return on
benchmark German government bunds by 3.48 percentage points,
according to Bloomberg data. The spread was as high as 5.98
points at the start of June, the data show.  ‘Good Value’  “Equities still look good value relative to other asset
classes, which is part of the reason why they managed to grind
higher,” said Hanson, who has a neutral allocation in European
equities within the $1.6 billion he helps oversee. Still, “the
ECB action is conditional on politicians achieving the right
outcomes,” he said. “There are a lot of risks.”  French President Francois Hollande announced his first
annual budget on Sept. 28, raising taxes on the rich and big
companies to reduce a deficit that’s forecast to be 4.5 percent
of GDP in 2012. The day before, Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy’s nine-month-old government detailed its fifth austerity
package, including a new duty on lottery winnings and a raid on
a pension reserve to finance increased benefits.  As the debt crisis erodes growth, the outlook for company
earnings is suffering. Analysts have trimmed Daimler’s  profit
estimates  for 2013 by 5.8 percent in the past four months, while
predictions on Milan-based  UniCredit (UCG)  have dropped 26 percent,
Bloomberg data show.  Daimler Forecast  Daimler, based in Stuttgart,  Germany , said Sept. 20 that
earnings at its car division will drop in 2012 as a European
auto-market decline hits profits. UniCredit,  Italy ’s biggest
bank, said Aug. 3 that second-quarter net income sank 67 percent
as provisions for bad loans increased and the company earned
less from lending and fees.  Heerlen, Netherlands-based  Royal DSM NV (DSM) , the world’s
largest maker of vitamins, said Aug. 7 it will cut jobs as it
struggles to meet profit goals.  Telefonica SA (TEF) , Spain’s largest
phone company, trimmed a revenue  forecast  in July amid a
deepening crisis at home. Burberry Group Plc shares fell the
most ever on Sept. 11 as the U.K.’s largest luxury-goods maker
said full-year profit will disappoint.  Profit Estimates  Estimates for 2012 earnings at Euro Stoxx 50 companies have
fallen to 238 euros a share from 268 euros at the start of the
year and 251 euros four months ago, according to Bloomberg data.
Forecasts for the S&P 500 in 2013 have fallen 2.2 percent in the
past four months to $116 a share. Projections for the MSCI Asia
Pacific have slipped 1.4 percent to $11.20 per share, Bloomberg
data show.  For James Butterfill, who helps oversee about 40 billion
pounds ($65 billion) as a global equity strategist at Coutts &
Co. in London, analysts are likely to trim European profit
estimates further.  “Do you trust analysts estimates which price in a recovery
in earnings?” Butterfill said in a phone interview. “The
recent rally was the Draghi effect, it is not built on the back
of good fundamentals and good corporate data.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
