Iraq ’s Oil Minister Abdul Kareem al-Luaibi and the natural resources minister of the country’s
self-ruling Kurdish region are meeting today to start drafting
an energy law to regulate the industry, a lawmaker said.  Al-Luaibi is joining Ashti Hawrami, the Kurdish region’s
resources minister, at the parliament in central Baghdad today,
together with the legislative body’s committees for oil and gas
and legal affairs, Qassem Mohammad said in a telephone
interview.  They’ll discuss various options, including three different
draft laws, said Mohammad, who serves on the oil and gas
committee. “They will start the process that will help reach a
new version, which will take into consideration everyone’s views
in order to regulate this huge wealth which makes up more than
95 percent of Iraq’s revenue,” he said.  Iraq’s federal government and Kurdish authorities have been
at loggerheads over oil sales and contract terms with Exxon
Mobil Corp., Total SA and other international companies that
have defied officials in  Baghdad  and struck deals with the
Kurds. The two sides have failed to agree on a national energy
law after six years of effort. They reached an accord earlier
this month for the resumption of crude exports from the Kurdish
region, and Hawrami said Sept. 18 that parliament may approve
the energy law by the end of the year.  To contact the reporters on this story:
