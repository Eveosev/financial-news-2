Zach Johnson beat Graeme McDowell
of Northern Ireland during the final-day singles at the Ryder
Cup, golfâ€™s premier team competition.  The result gives the U.S. a 12-11 lead over  Europe . Johnson
won 2-and-1, meaning he led by two holes with one to play, at
Medinah Country Club outside  Chicago .  The U.S. needs 14 1/2 points to regain the trophy, while
Europe requires 14 points to retain the title it won two years
ago.   After beginning the final day trailing 10-6, Europe needs
to match the biggest comeback in Ryder Cup history to log its
seventh win in nine editions. The U.S. won the 1999 edition at
Brookline, Massachusetts, after trailing 10-6 going into the 12
singles matches.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
