An Egyptian judge has referred
former prime minister and presidential candidate Ahmed Shafik
and 10 others to a criminal court.  Judge Hisham Raouf referred Shafik on charges of corruption
at the Aviation Ministry, the Justice Ministry said in a faxed
statement. EgyptAir Holding Co. Chairman Tawfik Assi also faces
related charges, it said.  Shafik, a career air force officer and former civil
aviation minister, was among several officials named in lawsuits
alleging land usurpation that benefited an air force pilots’
association, the prosecutor-general’s office said on June 26.  Shafik, who was the last prime minister of ousted President
 Hosni Mubarak , lost the final round of presidential elections to
Mohamed Mursi, the candidate backed by the Muslim Brotherhood.
He travelled to the  United Arab Emirates  after Mursi was
declared president in June.  To contact the reporter on this story:
