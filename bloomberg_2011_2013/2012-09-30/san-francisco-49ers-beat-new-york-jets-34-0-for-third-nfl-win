The Philadelphia Eagles held on for a
19-17 win over the division-rival  New York  Giants as Lawrence Tynes missed a 54-yard field goal with 10 seconds left.  Alex Henery kicked four field goals for the Eagles,
including a 26-yarder with one minute, 49 seconds remaining at
Lincoln Financial Field in Philadelphia last night. The Eagles’
three wins have come by a total of four points.  The Giants drove to Philadelphia’s 26-yard line in the
closing seconds before an offensive pass interference penalty on
receiver Ramses Barden cost New York 10 yards and forced a
longer kick. Tynes pulled the first attempt to the left and got
a second chance because Eagles coach Andy Reid called timeout
just before the ball was snapped. When Tynes’s second kick fell
short, it gave the Eagles their seventh win in the past eight
regular-season meetings against the Giants.  “Football can take years off your life,” said Eagles
quarterback Michael Vick, whose 19-yard scoring pass to DeSean Jackson just before halftime was Philadelphia’s lone touchdown.
“We pulled it out.”  The Green Bay Packers dropped the New Orleans Saints to 0-4
with a 28-27 victory yesterday, while the San Francisco 49ers
routed the New York Jets 34-0 and the  Arizona  Cardinals won in
overtime to start the National Football League season 4-0 for
the first time since 1974.  The Packers rebounded from their controversial Week 3 loss
in Seattle as Aaron Rodgers passed for 319 yards and four
touchdowns at Lambeau Field in Green Bay,  Wisconsin . The Packers
withstood a 446-yard, three-touchdown game by Saints quarterback
Drew Brees and held on for the win as Garrett Hartley missed a
48-yard field goal with 2:49 remaining.  Undefeated Cardinals  The Cardinals stayed unbeaten by overcoming the Miami
Dolphins 24-21 on Jay Feely’s 46-yard field goal in Glendale,
Arizona. The Cardinals tied the game on Kevin Kolb’s 15-yard
touchdown pass to Andre Roberts with 22 seconds left in the
fourth quarter and set up the winning kick by intercepting a
pass from Dolphins rookie quarterback Ryan Tannehill on the
second overtime possession. Tannehill had 431 passing yards.  The Houston Texans also improved to 4-0 for the first time
with a 38-14 win against the Tennessee Titans, while the Atlanta
Falcons remained unbeaten through four games after a 30-28 win
against the Carolina Panthers.  The New England Patriots scored 35 straight second-half
points as they rallied to a 52-28 win over the Buffalo Bills.
The Patriots, who trailed 14-7 after 30 minutes, became the
first NFL team since the 1950 Giants to score at least 45
second-half points in a game they trailed at halftime.  Other Scores  Elsewhere it was the Washington Redskins 24, the Tampa Bay
Buccaneers 22; the Minnesota Vikings 20, the Detroit Lions 13;
the San Diego Chargers 37, the Kansas City Chiefs 20; the
Cincinnati Bengals 27, the Jacksonville Jaguars 10; the Denver
Broncos 37, the Oakland Raiders 6; and the St. Louis Rams 19,
the  Seattle  Seahawks 13.  The Week 4 schedule, which opened four days ago with the
Baltimore Ravens’ 23-16 win over the Cleveland Browns, concludes
tonight with the Dallas Cowboys hosting the Chicago Bears in a
matchup of teams with 2-1 records.  Yesterday’s games came a day after referees approved an
eight-year labor deal with the NFL. The sides reached agreement,
ending a lockout that began in early June, two days after a
national outcry began over a touchdown call by replacement
officials that gave the Seahawks a 14-12 final-play victory over
the Packers on Sept. 24.  The Packers blew a 21-7 second-quarter lead at home
yesterday before rallying to take a one-point lead on Rodgers’s
11-yard touchdown pass to Jordy Nelson with seven minutes left.  Packers’ Win  Green Bay (2-2) then held on for the win after a blown call
by the regular officials. Television replays showed the Saints’
Darren Sproles fumbled the ensuing kickoff, yet he was ruled
down before the ball came out and New Orleans retained
possession. The Saints drove to the Packers’ 25-yard line and
Hartley’s successful 43-yard field goal was nullified by a
holding penalty and he pulled the next attempt wide right.  In Philadelphia, Giants quarterback Eli Manning threw his
second touchdown pass -- a six-yarder to Bear Pascoe -- to give
the visitors a 17-16 lead with 6:45 remaining.  The Eagles, who won each of their first two games of the
season by one point, then drove 75 yards to set up Henery’s
winning kick. The Giants benefited from two defensive pass
interference penalties on their last drive to move into Eagles’
territory before Barden was flagged near the end zone.  “This is Eagles-Giants, it had to come down to the end,”
said Eagles running back LeSean McCoy, who ran for 123 yards.  Jets’ Struggles  At MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford, New Jersey, the Jets
were held to 145 yards of offense and had four turnovers in
getting shut out at home for the first time since a 9-0 loss to
the Packers on Oct. 31, 2010.  The Jets’ defense allowed 245 rushing yards, their most
since giving up 296 against the Redskins in 2007. The score
could have been worse had 49ers backup quarterback Colin Kaepernick not slid at the Jets’ 3-yard line in the closing
seconds to avoid scoring another touchdown after breaking away
for a 30-yard run.  “Our fans deserved a heck of a lot better than this,”
Jets coach Rex Ryan said at a news conference. “We had a packed
stadium and we played terrible.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
