China may adjust the  reserve
requirements  for banks to stimulate the economy if government
data tomorrow show manufacturing weakening, according to
 Australia & New Zealand Banking Group Ltd. (ANZ)   “The policy window is still open,” Liu Li-Gang, chief
China economist at ANZ in  Hong Kong , said in an interview on the
Australian Broadcasting Corp. today. Key indicators including
industrial production and power consumption are showing that the
Chinese economy is slowing faster than normal, Liu said.  China’s manufacturing contracted for an 11th straight month
in September, a private survey found yesterday, increasing
pressure on the government to bolster growth in the world’s
second-largest economy. Speculation that authorities will take
steps to counter a deepening slowdown spurred a 4.1 percent
surge in the benchmark Shanghai Composite Index in the week’s
final two trading days.  The purchasing managers’ index from HSBC Holdings Plc and
Markit Economics had a final reading of 47.9 for September,
compared with 47.6 in August and a preliminary level of 47.8
released Sept. 20.  A government-backed index for manufacturing will be
released tomorrow. The gauge probably rose to 50.1, just above
the expansion-contraction dividing level of 50, from a nine-
month low of 49.2 in August, based on the  median estimate  of 21
analysts surveyed by  Bloomberg News .  To contact the reporter on this story:
