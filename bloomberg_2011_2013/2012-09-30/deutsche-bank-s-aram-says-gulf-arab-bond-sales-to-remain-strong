Bond sales from the six-nation Gulf
Cooperation Council will remain “strong” as companies in these
countries seek a substitute for declining lending from European
banks, the regional head of  Deutsche Bank AG (DBK) , said.  The pipeline for bond sales in the GCC is “very, very
strong and I think will remain” that way, Ashok Aram, chief
executive officer for the  Middle East  and North Africa for the
bank, said at a news conference in Dubai today. The GCC region
has “relied a lot on bank loans but bank loans are going to be
more constrained” as European lenders reduce debt and seek to
raise capital to comply with more stringent rules, he said.  Governments and companies in the GCC, seeking to benefit
from the lowest  interest rates  in 20 years, have raised $28.2
billion from 58 bond issues so far this year, compared with the
$13.6 billion raised from 26 issues in the same period of 2011,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Syndicated loans have
raised $24.3 billion for borrowers so far this year, compared
with $26.1 billion in the same period of 2011, the data shows.  Frankfurt-based Deutsche Bank is the third-biggest arranger
of bond sales in the GCC this year after HSBC Holdings Plc and
Standard Chartered Plc, according to the data. Deutsche Bank has
helped clients raise $2.23 billion from seven issues this year,
and is one of the banks currently arranging the sale of Islamic
bonds, or sukuk, for  Qatar Islamic Bank (QIBK)  SAQ.  To contact the reporter on this story:
