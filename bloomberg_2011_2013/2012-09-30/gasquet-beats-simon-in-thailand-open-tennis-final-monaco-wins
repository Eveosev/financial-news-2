France’s  Richard Gasquet  beat
countryman Gilles Simon 6-2, 6-1 in the Thailand Open final in
Bangkok for his seventh career ATP World Tour tennis title.  The 26-year-old, who has now won all six meetings with
Simon, 27, secured his first title since winning in Nice in May
2010. Gasquet had lost his past three finals.  “I played against a French player who is also my friend so
of course it a little bit strange but for me it’s a title,”
Gasquet told reporters. “I’ve had some tough matches this week
so I’m very happy to win,”  In Kuala Lumpur, Juan Monaco of Argentina defeated France’s
Julien Benneteau, 7-5, 4-6, 6-3 in the Malaysian Open final. It
was the 28-year-old’s fourth title this year.  Yesterday, Russia’s Nadia Petrova beat defending champion
Agnieszka Radwanska of Poland 6-0, 1-6, 6-3 to win the Pan
Pacific Open title in Tokyo.  To contact the reporter on this story:
