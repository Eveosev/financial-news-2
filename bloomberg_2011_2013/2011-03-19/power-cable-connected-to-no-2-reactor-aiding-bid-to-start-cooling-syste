Workers have finished connecting
the power cable to the No. 2 reactor at the Dai-Ichi nuclear
power plant in Fukushima, northern  Japan , said Hidehiko
Nishiyama, a deputy director general for the Japan Nuclear and
Industrial Safety Agency.  Workers will begin work on restoring power to the cooling
system of the reactor tomorrow morning, Nishiyama said during a
press conference in Tokyo. The power would also be restored to
the No. 1 reactor’s cooling system.  “This is an important step,” Nishiyama said.  Tokyo Electric Power Co. employees worked through the
night to complete the connection after the cooling systems of
the reactors were damaged by the earthquake and the tsunami
that struck the region March 11. Troops and firefighters
sprayed water on the reactors in an attempt to cool them down
until power could be restored.  For now, workers will continue to spray water on the No. 1
and No. 2 reactors, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
