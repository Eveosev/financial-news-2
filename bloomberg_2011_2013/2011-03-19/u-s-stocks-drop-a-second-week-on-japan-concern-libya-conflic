U.S. stocks fell this week, sending
the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index to the biggest drop since
August, amid concern that Japan’s nuclear crisis and violence in
Libya and Bahrain may curb the global economy.  The S&P 500 rose 1.8 percent in the past two days after the  Federal Reserve  said some banks are strong enough to boost
dividends and buybacks, Libya called a cease-fire and FedEx
Corp.’s forecast beat estimates.  General Electric Co. (GE)  lost 5.5
percent, leading declines in the Dow Jones Industrial Average.
Utilities fell the most in the S&P 500, slumping 4.3 percent,
amid speculation Tokyo Electric Power Co.’s struggle to regain
control at a nuclear plant will prompt more U.S. oversight.  The S&P 500 retreated 1.9 percent to 1,279.20 this week,
and has slumped 3.2 percent since March 4, the biggest two-week
decline in seven months. The index plunged 3.6 percent between
March 11 and March 16 following the 9-magnitude earthquake that
was Japan’s largest on record. It erased its annual gain after
being up 6.8 percent year-to-date on Feb. 18. The Dow dropped
185.88 points, or 1.5 percent, to 11,858.52 this week.  “It’s obviously been a pretty dramatic week,” said
Jonathan Vyorst, who helps oversee $2.2 billion at Albany, New
York-based Paradigm Capital Management Inc. “There’s the
potential for a meltdown in Japan, there’s a potential war in
Libya, and there’s unrest in Bahrain and Saudi Arabia, so pick
your poison.”  The S&P 500 has tumbled 4.8 percent from its 32-month high
in February amid concern among investors that Japan’s quake and
the uprisings in the Middle East and northern Africa will
restrain the global economy.  VIX Rises  The Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility Index, or
VIX, which measures the cost of using options to protect against
S&P 500 losses, surged 22 percent to 24.44 this week. It
completed the biggest three-day jump since May on March 16.  Japan’s  Nikkei 225 (NKY)  Stock Average has plunged 10 percent
since March 11, the biggest weekly slump since a month after New
York-based Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc.’s September 2008
bankruptcy drove the global economy into a tailspin.  Prime Minister Naoto Kan said Japan’s nuclear crisis
remained “very grave.” Workers at Tokyo Electric’s tsunami-
damaged power plant are battling to cool reactors and spent fuel
to avert overheating and explosions that could spew radioactive
material into the environment. A meltdown or explosion is
unlikely to pose a health risk beyond 50 kilometers (36 miles)
of the site, doctors and scientists said.  Qaddafi, Obama  Libyan leader Muammar Qaddafi’s promise of an immediate
cease-fire, even if implemented, falls short of the demands set
by the U.S., U.K and France to avert allied military strikes as
soon as this weekend. Qaddafi’s credibility was undercut when
al-Jazeera said his forces kept advancing on Benghazi, the
opposition stronghold. U.S. President Barack Obama said Qaddafi
must stop attacks on civilians, halt his advance on Benghazi,
and pull back from three other cities.  The S&P 500’s three-day slump through March 16 sent it to
the lowest valuation since November of 14.7 times reported
earnings. It then jumped 1.8 percent through yesterday. The
index had surged 25 percent between Aug. 26, the day before
Federal Reserve Chairman Ben S. Bernanke signaled he was
prepared to take action to boost the economy, and March 11, the
day of the Japanese quake.  “The price action this week reinforces the idea that in
healthy uptrends, oversold markets should be bought,” said  Christopher Verrone , head of technical analysis at New York-
based Strategas Research Partners. “While news flow out of
Japan and the Middle East will likely continue to dictate near-
term price action, we continue to believe the integrity of the
longer-term uptrend remains intact.”  GE, Utilities  GE, the world’s biggest maker of power-generation equipment
and designer of one of the reactors that exploded at a plant
north of Tokyo, declined 5.5 percent to $19.25.  Babcock & Wilcox
Co. (BWC) , which makes nuclear components to support U.S. defense
programs, slumped 12 percent to $30.33.  The  S&P 500 Utilities Index (S5UTIL)  dropped 4.3 percent, the most
among 10 industries in the benchmark gauge.  Exelon Corp. (EXC) , owner
of the largest group of U.S. nuclear power plants, declined 7.3
percent to $40.03.  Entergy Corp. (ETR)  fell 11 percent to $65.64. The
second-largest U.S. nuclear reactor operator is subject to the
threat of regulatory pushback because it’s seeking to renew
licenses for four of its reactors, according to Hugh Wynne, a
New York-based analyst for Sanford C. Bernstein & Co.    Aflac Inc. (AFL) , the insurance company that got 76 percent of
2010 revenue from Japan, led declines among the 22 companies in
the  S&P 500 Insurance Index (S5INSU) , which lost 2.7 percent. Aflac
declined 8.8 percent to $50.67.  Hartford Financial Services
Group Inc. (HIG)  dropped 7.6 percent to $25.49.  Coach, Tiffany    Coach Inc. (COH)  and  Tiffany & Co. (TIF) , declined on speculation store
closures and shortened hours in Japan will reduce sales.
Tiffany, the world’s second-largest luxury jewelry retailer,
decreased 9.3 percent to $57.29. Coach, the largest U.S. maker
of luxury leather handbags, slumped 11 percent to $49.83.  Solar companies rallied as investors bet they may benefit
as demand for alternative energy grows following the disaster in
Japan.  First Solar Inc. (FSLR) , the world’s largest manufacturer of
thin-film solar modules, advanced 7.1 percent to $149.66.  Energy was the only group among 10 in the S&P 500 the
rallied this week, gaining 0.4 percent. Southwestern Energy Co.
rose 11 percent to $41.12.  Coal producers advanced after Jefferies Group Inc. said it
expects increased demand because of the problems at Tokyo
Electric’s facility.  Peabody Energy Corp. (BTU)  rose 11 percent to
$70.21 for the second-biggest gain in the S&P 500. Consol Energy
Inc. jumped third-most, adding 11 percent to $53.93.  Biggest Dow Gain    Caterpillar Inc. (CAT)  rose the most in the Dow, climbing 5
percent to $105.06. The world’s largest construction equipment
maker may be among the U.S. companies to benefit as Japan
rebuilds, said analysts at Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP.  While FedEx fell 1.6 percent to $89.28 this week, it
rallied 3.1 percent on March 17 for the biggest gain in a month
after the world’s biggest cargo airline predicted higher profit
than analysts estimated.  Pessimism on U.S. stocks rose for the third straight week,
according to  Investors Intelligence’s  analysis of investment
newsletters between March 9 and yesterday. About 22 percent of
writers were bearish on U.S. stocks, up from 21 percent last
week, according to the New Rochelle, New York-based firm, which
has examined forecasts in newsletters since 1963.  Nike, Intel    Nike Inc. (NKE)  sank fourth most in the S&P 500, slipping 11
percent to $77.59. The world’s largest sporting goods company
missed the average analyst estimate for the first time in 19
quarters as costs rose.    Intel Corp. (INTC)  slid 4.5 percent to $19.93 after Nomura
Holdings Inc. cut its rating to “neutral” from “buy” for the
chipmaker, citing weak personal-computer demand.  International
Business Machines Corp. (IBM)  fell 4 percent to $155.89 after Sanford
C. Bernstein & Co. cut its rating on the shares to “market
perform” from “outperform.”  Fed policy makers said March 15 that U.S. growth is on a
“firmer footing,” employment appears to be “improving
gradually” and higher energy prices will have a temporary
effect on inflation as they reiterated plans to buy $600 billion
of Treasuries through June.  “Growth won’t slow down that much,” said David Dreman,
the chairman and managing director of Jersey City, New Jersey-
based Dreman Value Management LLC, which oversees about $5.5
billion. “We can have a market that still continues to be
positive through the year. This year will continue to be a happy
year.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
