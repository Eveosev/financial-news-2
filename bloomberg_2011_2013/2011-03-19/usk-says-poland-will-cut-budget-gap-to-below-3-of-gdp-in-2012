Poland will cut its budget deficit
to below 3 percent of gross domestic product in 2012 and its
economy will expand more than 4 percent in 2011, Prime Minister  Donald Tusk  wrote in an article published in the  Gazeta Wyborcza 
newspaper.  The governmentâ€™s actions will also prevent public debt from
breaching the legal limit of 55 percent of GDP, Tusk wrote. He
also said that the debt to GDP ratio will start to fall from
2012.  To contact the reporter on this story:
