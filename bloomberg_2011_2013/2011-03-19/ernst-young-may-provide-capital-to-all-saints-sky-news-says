Ernst & Young may provide short-
term capital to U.K. retailer All Saints even as it seeks to
sell a stake in the company, Sky Newsâ€™ Mark Kleinman  reported on
his blog today , without saying how he got the information.  Ernst & Young, acting as administrator to Kaupthing Bank hf
and Glitnir Bank hf, is seeking to sell stakes in All Saints
previously owned by the two failed Icelandic banks, Kleinman
said. The company is in talks with three potential investors
including  Och-Ziff Capital Management Group LLC (OZM) , and the
directors of All Saints are meeting this weekend to try to
finalize a deal, he said.  Goode Partners LLC may have considered a stake purchase in
the retailer, he said, without saying whether they were one of
the final three potential investors.  Ernst & Young invested 20 million pounds ($32.5 million) in
All Saints several months ago, Kleinman reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
