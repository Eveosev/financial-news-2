checking on the victims at a makeshift clinic and a hospital in

Volunteers set up the clinic to care for the wounded after
police and pro-regime gunmen shot at a crowd of thousands of
demonstrators in the capital yesterday. At least 46 people were
killed and hundreds injured in the deadliest crackdown in two
months of unrest in the country  Four protesters were wounded by gunfire today in Aden,
