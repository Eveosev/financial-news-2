  Valero Energy Corp. (VLO)  reported
flaring gases related to maintenance at its refinery in  Corpus
Christi ,  Texas , according to a filing with regulators.  A company  report  to with the National Response Center
showed the incident took place yesterday.  U.S. refineries must notify the National Response Center if
they release hazardous substances in excess of reportable
quantities, according to the Comprehensive Environmental
Response, Compensation and Liability Act, commonly known as
Superfund.  The Valero refinery consists of east and west plants about
a mile apart with a capacity of about 315,000 barrels a day, the
company said on its website.  Refinery outages can increase prices for refined products
as companies turn to spot markets to help them meet supply
contracts. Operational disruptions can also depress prices for
crude oil as less feedstock is used.  To contact the reporter on this story:
