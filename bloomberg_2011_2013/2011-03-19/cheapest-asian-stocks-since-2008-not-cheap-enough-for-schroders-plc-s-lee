The lowest valuations for Asian
stocks in more than two years isn’t enough to lure Schroders
Plc’s Lee King Fuei, who says  Japan ’s nuclear crisis may spur
further losses.  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index traded at 12.6 times estimated
profit last week, the cheapest level since December 2008,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The Asian equity
benchmark slumped 4.4 percent last week, led by a 55 percent
plunge in Tokyo Electric Power Co. on concern its Fukushima Dai-
Ichi power plant is leaking radiation.  “You can’t make a clear case to buy at this stage given
prevailing risks,” said Fuei, a Singapore-based  fund manager  at
Schroders, which manages about $308 billion. “Valuations in
Asia are not yet attractive.”  Troops and firefighters again started pumping seawater on
the plant yesterday in an attempt to prevent fuel rods from
overheating, while Tepco, as  Tokyo Electric  is also known,
cautioned the tsunami-damaged cooling systems may not work even
after electricity is restored. Weather forecasts indicated
changing winds could start moving radiation closer to Tokyo this
weekend.  The magnitude 9 earthquake that shook Japan on March 11 has
killed at least 7,197 people, sent more than 300,000 to
emergency shelters and forced companies from Canon Inc. to
Suzuki Motor Corp. to halt manufacturing. The  Bank of Japan 
pumped a record 15 trillion yen ($190 billion) into money
markets on March 14 to assure financial stability.    Bear Market   Japanese stocks briefly entered a bear market last week
after the Nikkei 225 lost as much as 24 percent from a Feb. 21
high and reached the lowest level April 2009 before rebounding.
The index declined 10 percent to 9,206.75, the biggest weekly
loss since October 2008.  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. Japan strategist Kathy Matsui cut
her 2012 earnings per share estimate for companies in the Topix
index by 12 percent and to lower her 12-month target for the
index to 1,050, according to a March 18 note.  The gauge dropped
9.3 percent to 830.39 last week. In December she estimated the
index would be at 1,000 by the end of this year.  “The key unknown is the length of disruption to power
supplies, consumption and production,” the note said.  Utilities posted the biggest losses in the MSCI  Asia 
Pacific as a shortage of electricity led to rolling blackouts in
Japan and U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission Chairman Gregory
Jaczko warned on March 16 that radiation levels at Tokyo
Electric’s damaged nuclear plant are “extremely high.”  Await Nuclear Resolution  Tokyo Electric lost 55 percent to 948 yen, wiping out 1.9
trillion yen in the company’s market value. Toshiba Corp., which
supplied reactors to Tokyo Electric, slumped 27 percent to 360
yen. Tohoku Electric Power Co., which operates the Onagawa
nuclear plant, dropped 21 percent to 1,491 yen.  “Investors need to wait for the nuclear issue to be
resolved before they start buying Japan stocks,” said Ng Soo Nam, the Singapore-based chief investment officer at Nikko Asset
Management Co., which oversees about $126 billion. “If the
nuclear situation deteriorates, we could have another leg
down.”  The Nikkei Stock Average Volatility Index, a measure of
Japanese option prices, soared 113 percent to 49.95 for the
biggest weekly advance since data on the measure began in 2001.
The gauge shows options traders expect a 14 percent swing in the  Nikkei 225 (NKY)  in the next 30 days.  Toyota Motor Corp. posted the biggest weekly drop in a year,
slumping 11 percent to 3,215, after the world’s biggest car
company halted assembly in Japan and canceled overtime at North
American factories. Fuji Heavy Industries Ltd., the producer of
Subaru cars, lost 13 percent to 563.  Currency Intervention  The yen soared to a post-World War II high against the
dollar last week, spurring concern that the strengthening
currency may reduce profits for Japanese exporters and push the
world’s third-largest economy into a recession.  Policy makers in the G-7, a group of seven countries that
includes the U.S.,  Germany  and  France , intervened in the foreign
exchange market for the first time in more than a decade to
weaken the yen. Against the dollar, the yen fell to 81.70 at 5
p.m. in  Tokyo  on March 18, compared with the postwar high of
76.25 reached on March 17.  “It’s a confidence issue about how long it’s going to take
to get through the situation in Japan,” said Lorraine Tan,
director of equity research for Asia at  Standard & Poor’s  in
Singapore. “The first word that comes to mind about this week
would be volatile.”  Oil Jumps    Oil prices  jumped as high as $103.66 last week after the  United Nations  voted to establish a no-fly zone over  Libya ,
holder of  Africa ’s largest crude reserves. Energy producers in
the MSCI Asia Pacific posted the only gain among 10 industries,
rising 0.3 percent.  SK Holdings Co., the parent of oil refiner SK Innovation
Co., jumped 17 percent to 151,000 won for the biggest gain in
the MSCI Asia Pacific.  Construction companies and producers of building materials
rallied on speculation that steel and cement demand will
increase. Rebuilding work in Japan may total $200 billion,
according to an estimate from 3M Co., which makes products from
Scotch Tape to sandpaper and gets about 9 percent of sales from
Japan.  Posco,  South Korea ’s biggest steelmaker, increased 11
percent to 502,000 won. Tata Steel Ltd.,  India ’s biggest
producer of the metal, climbed 2.7 percent to 597.15 rupees.
Samsung Engineering Co. gained 6.7 percent to 198,500 won.  “The damage to factories, power supply, transport
infrastructure and confidence will depress economic activity
before rebuilding kicks in,” said  Shane Oliver , head of
investment strategy in Sydney at AMP Capital Investors Ltd,
which manages $98 billion. “It’s still too early to say that
we’ve seen the bottom yet.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
