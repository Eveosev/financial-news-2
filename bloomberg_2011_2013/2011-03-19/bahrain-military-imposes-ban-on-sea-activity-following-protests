Bahrain’s Defense Force General
Command imposed a nighttime curfew today on all activity at sea
and warned that any ship spotted between 5 p.m. and 6 a.m.
“will be dealt with appropriately,” the official  Bahrain News
Agency  said.  The agency said all people were included in the ban,
including professional and amateur fishermen. The curfew will be
in place until further notice, it said.  The island nation of Bahrain has been struggling to quell
more than a month of protests led by Shiites calling for
democracy and increased civil rights in the Sunni-ruled country.
The government declared a three-month state of emergency on
March 15 after troops from  Saudi Arabia  and other Gulf states
arrived to support the administration.  To contact the reporter on this story:
