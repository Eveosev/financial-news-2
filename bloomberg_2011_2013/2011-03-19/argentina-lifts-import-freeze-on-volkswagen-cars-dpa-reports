  Argentina  lifted a freeze on  Volkswagen AG (VOW)  import cars held by its customs in return for a
pledge by the automaker to raise exports from its own plants in
the country, the  DPA newswire  reported, citing no one.  In a bid to improve Argentinaâ€™s trade balance, President
Cristina Kirchner last week forced car importers to balance
their imports and exports or face having incoming vehicles
locked away by customs, DPA said.  While Volkswagen has two production sites in Argentina, BMW
AG has no sites and has some 1,000 imports still held by
customs, DPA said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
