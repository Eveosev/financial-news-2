  General Motors Co. (GM) ’s Adam Opel GmbH
unit said a shortage of an electronic component from a Japanese
supplier will halt production at its plants in Spain and  Germany 
next week.  “It’s one electronic component that’s halting production
lines,” said Opel spokesman Stefan Weinmann in a telephone
interview today. Weinmann declined to name the part or the
supplier. “We aim to make up the production shortfall as soon
as we can.”  The factory in Zaragoza, Spain, will be closed all day
March 21 and for half a day on March 25, Weinmann said.
Production will also be halted at Opel’s Eisenach site in
Germany on March 21 and March 22, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
