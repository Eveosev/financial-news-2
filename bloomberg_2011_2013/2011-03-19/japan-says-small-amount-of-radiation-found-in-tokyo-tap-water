Samples of tap water taken
yesterday in  Tokyo  and five nearby prefectures showed traces of
radiation that were within acceptable levels, the Japanese
government said.  Radiation was detected in water in Tokyo and the
prefectures of Tochigi, Gunma, Saitama, Chiba and Niigata,
Japan’s Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and
Technology said today in a faxed statement.  Tochigi Prefecture’s reading of radioactive iodine-131 was
77 Becquerel per kilogram, the highest among the prefectures,
while the level of iodine found in Tokyo’s Shinjuku district was
1.5. All the numbers were within the 300 Bq/kg limit, the
ministry said.  Readings couldn’t be taken in Miyagi and Ibaraki
prefectures because of disruption of water supply following the
magnitude 9 earthquake that struck  Japan  on March 11, while
Fukushima Prefecture takes its own readings, the statement said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
