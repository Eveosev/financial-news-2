William Morrison Supermarkets Plc
may buy more  convenience stores , an area into which the company
is hoping to expand, the Financial Times reported, citing an
interview with Chief Executive Officer Dalton Philips.  Morrison could be interested in buying groups of smaller-
format stores, Philips said. He declined to comment on whether
the company was studying Iceland Foods Ltd., the newspaper
reported.  Morrison is not primarily interested in buying a clothing
chain like Peacock Group Plc. or Matalan Ltd., according to the
FT. The company could support debt of up to 3 billion pounds ($5
billion), Philips said, and retain an investment-grade  credit
rating , the newspaper reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
