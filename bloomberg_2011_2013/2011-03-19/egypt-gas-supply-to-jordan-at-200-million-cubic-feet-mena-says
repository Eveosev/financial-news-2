Egyptian natural-gas supplies to
Jordan reached 200 million cubic feet a day today,  Egypt â€™s
state-run Middle East News Agency reported, citing Jordanian
Energy Minister Khalid Touqan.  Egyptian gas flows to its eastern neighbor resumed on March
15 after an explosion in the pipeline on Feb. 5, the agency,
also known as MENA, said.  Under the agreement between the two countries, Jordan
imports 240 million cubic feet a day of natural gas from the
North African country, which is used to generate 80 percent of
its electricity needs, according to MENA.  To contact the reporter on this story:
