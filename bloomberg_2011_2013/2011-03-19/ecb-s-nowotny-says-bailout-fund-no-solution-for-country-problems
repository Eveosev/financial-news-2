European Central Bank Governing
Council member Ewald Nowotny said that the European bailout fund
won’t solve the problems of some member states, Kleine Zeitung
reported, citing an interview.   “Nobody should claim we have a crisis of the euro,”
Nowotny told the Austrian newspaper. “We have a crisis of the
member states. Either because of too little productivity and too
high debt or because of their banking systems. And these issues
won’t be solved by the bailout fund.”  Kicking countries like Portugal and  Greece  out of the euro
wouldn’t be a solution, Nowotny told the paper, as this would
lead to “a run on the banks in these countries, exports would
get more expensive and we would further weaken the single
market.”  The countries facing problems need to “put their budgets
in order and if their bonds are risky, they will have to pay
more interest on them,” the report cited Nowotny as saying.
“These countries have to vow to be transparent and abandon
egoism.”  Nowotny also said that the catching-up process of the
economically weaker countries in the euro zone “is taking much
longer than we had anticipated,” Kleine Zeitung reported.      To contact the editor responsible for this story:
