German  Chancellor Angela Merkel 
called for the adoption of uniform nuclear safety standards
across the European Union and said she will address the issue at
a European Council meeting on March 24 to 25.  While the EU takes it on itself to regulate “the size of
apples and shape of bananas” it fails to ensure uniform safety
standards for nuclear plants, she said in her regular  podcast 
message.  To contact the reporter on this story:
