Star Flyer Inc., a Japanese
regional airline, canceled 20 flights this month after allowing
two foreign pilots to remain outside of the country during a
nuclear crisis.  The U.S. and Russian pilots asked to extend trips overseas
because of government advice against travel to  Japan , Yuichiro
Ando, a spokesman for the Kitakyushu, Japan-based airline, said
today by phone. The company agreed to the request, he said.  The carrier will scrap one flight from Tokyoâ€™s Haneda
airport to northern Kyushu every day from March 22 to March 31,
according to a statement on its  website . The airline will
operate 10 other daily services each way on the same route in
the period, it said.  Governments including the  U.S. , the U.K. and  Australia  have
advised citizens to avoid travel to Tokyo and other parts of
Japan as engineers battle to prevent a meltdown at a nuclear
power plant 135 miles (220 kilometers) north of the capital. The
facility was crippled by an earthquake on March 11.  To contact the reporter on this story:
