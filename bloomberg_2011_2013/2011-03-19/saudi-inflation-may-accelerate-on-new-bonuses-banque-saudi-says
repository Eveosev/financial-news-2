Saudi Arabian inflation may
accelerate after  King Abdullah  ordered new wage bonuses for
civil workers as part of a $93 billion financial package, Banque
Saudi Fransi said.  “Wage increases always have some inflationary pass-through
effect as they can directly impact consumption,” John Sfakianakis, the bank’s chief economist, wrote in an e-mailed
report yesterday. Civil servants will be paid two month bonuses
totaling 31.9 billion riyals ($8.5 billion)  within days,  Asharq
al-Awsat  reported today, citing official estimates.  Annual inflation in the Arab world’s largest economy slowed
to 5.3 percent in January, compared with 5.4 percent the
previous month, according to official data.  The new package and a $36 billion package announced Feb.
23. amounts to 29.7 percent of the kingdom’s GDP in 2010,
according to the bank’s report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
