  General Motors Co. (GM) , the largest
U.S. automaker, will suspend car production at plants in Spain
and Germany next week because of a shortage of parts from Japan.  The factory in Zaragoza, Spain, will be closed March 21,
and two shifts at the plant in Eisenach, Germany, will be
canceled on March 21 and March 22, said Klaus-Peter Martin, a
company spokesman. Both sites make the Opel Corsa small car,
while the Zaragoza factory also produces the Meriva minivan, he
said in a telephone interview.  GM is assessing inventories of key components after last
week’s earthquake and tsunami in Japan, Chief Executive Officer
Dan Akerson told reporters today in  Sao Paulo . The Detroit-based
automaker said yesterday its Shreveport Assembly plant in  Louisiana  will be closed the week of March 21 because of a parts
shortage.  “It’s hard to think that the problems in Japan are not
ultimately going to have an impact on production, whether it’s
having to slow production or even cease production of certain
vehicles,”  Maryann Keller , principal of a self-titled
consulting firm in Stamford, Connecticut, said today in a
Bloomberg Television interview. “This is going to take a few
weeks to resolve.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
