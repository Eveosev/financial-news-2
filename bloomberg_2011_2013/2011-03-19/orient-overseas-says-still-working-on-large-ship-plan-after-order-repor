Orient Overseas (International)
Ltd.,  Hong Kong ’s biggest container line, said it was still
working on plans to add larger vessels after Lloyd’s List
reported that the company was close to a deal.  “There is no announcement on any new vessels being
ordered,” Chief Financial Officer Ken Cambie said in an e-
mailed reply to Bloomberg News today. Lloyd’s List, citing an
unidentified person familiar with the situation, said the Hong
Kong-based company would sign a deal for as many as 10 ships,
each with a capacity to carry 13,000 containers, as early as
next week.  Orient Overseas is considering ordering ships able to carry
13,000 boxes, Cambie reiterated, as shipping lines add capacity
because of rising Asian exports to the U.S. and  Europe . A.P.
Moeller Maersk A/S, the world’s largest container line, last
month ordered as many as 30 ships that can carry 18,000
containers.  Lloyd’s List said yesterday that Orient Overseas would
place six firm orders with Samsung Heavy Industries Co. and take
four options.  Separately, Orient Overseas yesterday said three Asia-North
America services were omitting port stops in  Tokyo  after an
earthquake and crippled nuclear-power plant caused electricity
shortages in the city. Two of the sailings also will skip stops
in Nagoya, the company said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
