The Australian government supports
military action in Libya to prevent its leader  Muammar Qaddafi 
from committing further violence against his people, Prime
Minister  Julia Gillard  said.  “This is about a broad range of military actions to try
and protect the Libyan people,” Gillard told Sky television in
an interview broadcast today in Sydney. “We’ve seen from every
statement that he intends to wreak more and more violence.”  President Barack Obama authorized U.S. armed forces to
begin “limited” operations to enforce a no-fly zone in Libya,
as U.S. and coalition ships and aircraft hit the North African
nation’s air defenses. Gillard said today that the United
Nations Security Council would need to “meet and deliberate”
again if ground forces are needed in Libya.  The military action “is no walk in the park” and is a
difficult and complex operation, Australian Foreign Minister  Kevin Rudd  said in a separate interview on Channel Ten today.  Qaddafi is a “brutal, bloody dictator” whose threats
against his civilian population “are breathtaking,” Rudd said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
