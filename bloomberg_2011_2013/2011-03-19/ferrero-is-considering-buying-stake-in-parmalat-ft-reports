Ferrero SpA may buy a stake in  Parmalat SpA (PLT) , the Financial Times reported today, citing
unidentified people with knowledge of the matter.  Ferrero is looking at the so-called strategic fit between
the two companies and is in the early stages of considering
buying a stake, the FT said.  Parmalat, Italy’s largest dairy company, rose in Milan
trading yesterday after Groupe Lactalis said it may raise its
stake, joining a battle for control with other shareholders
including  Intesa Sanpaolo SpA. (ISP)  Investors are vying to propose
candidates for election to Parmalat’s board.  To contact the reporter on this story:
