Ferrero SpA, the Italian
confectionery maker of Tic Tac candies and Nutella spread, said
it favors Italian ownership of  Parmalat SpA (PLT) , the country’s
largest dairy company.  Ferrero would be sympathetic toward “an industrial Italian
solution,” an official for the company said in a telephone
interview today. He preferred anonymity and declined to add any
further comments.  The Financial Times reported today that Ferrero may buy a
stake in Collecchio, Italy-based Parmalat. Shares of the company
rose in Milan trading yesterday after France’s Groupe Lactalis
said it may raise its stake, joining a battle for control with
other shareholders including bank  Intesa Sanpaolo SpA. (ISP)   Italian Finance Minister Giulio Tremonti at yesterday’s
government Cabinet meeting discussed a plan to adopt measures
aimed at protecting Italy’s “strategic” companies from foreign
takeovers, according to a government statement.  Investors are vying to propose candidates for election to
Parmalat’s board. Lactalis, Intesa and a group of Parmalat
investors which includes MacKenzie Financial Corp., Skagen AS
and Zenit Asset Management AB, have each proposed separate
slates of candidates.  To contact the reporter on this story:
