German bunds advanced for a second
week as  Japan ’s battle to prevent a meltdown at an earthquake-
damaged nuclear-power plant and concern that military conflict
in Libya may escalate stoked demand for the safest assets.  The gains sent 10-year bund yields to a two-month low after
the March 11 earthquake and subsequent tsunami damaged the
Fukushima Dai-Ichi plant, threatening a nuclear meltdown at the
facility north of Tokyo. Greek, Spanish and Portuguese bonds
rallied after European Union leaders agreed last weekend to
expand a bailout plan for the region’s most indebted nations.
European Central Bank President  Jean-Claude Trichet  indicated
yesterday he favors raising  interest rates  next month to curb
inflation.  “What we’ve seen is a flight to quality from all the risk
events like the earthquake and nuclear disaster in Japan,” said
Thomas Meissner, head of fixed-income research at DZ Bank AG in  Frankfurt . “People are looking for safer assets and that’s been
supportive of bunds.”  Bund yields declined three basis points in the week to
3.18 percent as of 4:07 p.m. in London, within 11 basis points
of the 3.07 percent level reached March 16, which was the lowest
since Jan. 18. The 2.5 percent security due January 2021 rose
0.280, or 2.80 euros per 1,000-euro ($1,408) face amount, to
94.345. Yields on two-year notes declined two basis points to
1.63 percent in the week.  Quake, Oil, Libya  Japan’s magnitude 9.0 earthquake, which was followed by a
20-foot tsunami, killed an estimated 6,539 people while a
further 10,354 were reported missing and another 382,613
evacuated from the affected area, according to the  National
Police Agency .  Oil prices surged as high as $103.66 a barrel in  New York 
after the United Nations authorized the use of air strikes over
Libya to protect civilians from leader Muammar Qaddafi’s troops
following a month-long uprising against his rule. Libya later
said it would halt all action against anti-government forces.  “There’s concern about Libya and the very strong increase
in the oil price,” said  Kornelius Purps , an interest-rate
strategist at UniCredit SpA in Munich. “This might be a reason
for support in the bund market. All other factors argue for
higher yields.”  Greek 10-year bonds rose for the first week in six, sending
yields down 63 basis points to 12.18 percent. Euro-area leaders
agreed in the early hours of March 12 to expand the scope of
their 440 billion-euro bailout fund for debt-strapped nations
and eased the terms of rescue loans to  Greece .  ‘Ultimate Solution’  “The ultimate solution to  Europe ’s debt crisis needs to
come from the indebted countries themselves but what the
expanded EU rescue has done is buy them some time,” said  DZ
Bank ’s Meissner. “The situation is getting better every day.”  Ten-year Spanish yields declined 27 basis points to 5.16
percent while those on Portuguese debt of similar maturity sank
23 basis points to 7.37 percent. The gains in Portuguese debt
came even after Moody’s Investors Service on March 15 cut the
nation’s credit rating by two steps to A3, four notches above
so-called junk status, and said it may make further reductions.  EU leaders are scheduled to meet on March 24-25 to agree on
a final resolution to the 17-member euro zone’s debt crisis.  To contact the reporters on this story:
