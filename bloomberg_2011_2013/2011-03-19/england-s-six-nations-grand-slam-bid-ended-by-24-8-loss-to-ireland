  England  lost to Ireland 24-8 in its
final game in rugby’s Six Nations, ending its bid to win the
title in a Grand Slam.  England still leads the standings with eight points after
the loss in Dublin.  Wales  can match England on points by beating
France later today, but the English are likely to capture the
title because of a far superior points difference.  England was attempting to win all five of its Six Nations
matches -- known as the Grand Slam -- for the first time since
2003.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
