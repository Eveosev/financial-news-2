The U.S. and  Brazil  signed a trade
and economic cooperation agreement to boost commerce between the
Western Hemisphere’s largest economies as President Barack Obama
arrived for his first visit to  South America .  The accord creates a U.S.-Brazil commission to expand trade
and remove non-tariff barriers, according to a statement today
from U.S. Trade Representative Ron Kirk’s office. The commission
will be led by Kirk’s office and by officials from two Brazilian
ministries responsible for trade, industry and development.  Obama, appearing with Brazilian President  Dilma Rousseff  in
Brasilia today, said the nation is becoming a global economic
leader and the two governments have an “historic opportunity”
to deepen cooperation. Obama said he is starting his first visit
to South America in Brazil to highlight its economic ascendancy.  Increasing U.S. companies’ sales to Brazil would help meet
Obama’s goal of doubling exports by 2015. U.S. sales to Brazil
climbed to a record $35.4 billion last year as the Brazilian
real’s two-year, 41 percent rally against the dollar made
American goods more attractive.  A trade and economic cooperation agreement is “among the
first steps on the road to a free-trade agreement,” John Faraci, chief executive officer of Memphis, Tennessee-based  International Paper Co. (IP) , the world’s largest paper and pulp
producer, said today at the U.S.-Brazil Business Summit in
Brasilia.  To contact the reporter on this story:
