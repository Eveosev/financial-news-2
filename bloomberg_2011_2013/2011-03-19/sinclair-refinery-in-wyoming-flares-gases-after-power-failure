Sinclair Oil Corp.â€™s refinery near
Rawlins,  Wyoming , flared gases into the atmosphere after a  power
failure , the company said in a filing.  A company  report  to with the National Response Center
showed the incident took place yesterday.  U.S. refineries must notify the National Response Center if
they release hazardous substances in excess of reportable
quantities, according to the Comprehensive Environmental
Response, Compensation and Liability Act, commonly known as
Superfund.  A telephone call by Bloomberg News seeking comment was not
immediately returned.  The plant, 150 miles (240 kilometers) northwest of
Cheyenne, can process 85,000 barrels of crude a day, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Refinery outages can increase prices for refined products
as companies turn to spot markets to help them meet supply
contracts. Operational disruptions can also depress prices for
crude oil as less feedstock is used.  To contact the reporter on this story:
