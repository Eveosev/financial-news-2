German Finance Minister  Wolfgang Schaeuble  said the future capital requirements of the European
Stability Mechanism to which  Germany  will contribute may rule
out the country cutting taxes, the  Sueddeutsche Zeitung  said.  The ESM, which is due to be in operation from mid 2013, may
require as much as 80 billion euros ($113.5 billion) in capital
from the 17-member euro-group, Schaeuble is cited as saying in
an interview.  While not specifying Germany’s contribution, paying the
stake may thwart hopes of the government cutting taxes, he said.
Germany’s input will not appear on its national deficit accounts
that are reported to the European Union, Schaeuble said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
