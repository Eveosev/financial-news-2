  UniCredit SpA (UCG) , may underwrite a
capital increase for  Fondiaria-Sai SpA (FSA)  and take a stake of 7
percent in the Italian insurance company,  Il Sole 24 Ore 
reported, without saying where it got the information.  UniCreditâ€™s financial support for the capital increase,
which may surpass 460 million euros ($652 million), would be
conditional on the acceptance of new governance rules and new
management for Fondiaria, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
