Efforts to control  Japan ’s nuclear
crisis were delayed by concerns over damaging valuable assets at
the Fukushima Dai-Ichi nuclear power plant and initial passivity
from the Japanese government, the Wall Street Journal reported,
citing people familiar with the matter.  Tokyo Electric Power Co. was reluctant to use seawater to
cool one of the six reactors at the plant and hesitated because
it was concerned about harming its long-term investment in the
plant, the Journal cited people involved with the response as
saying.  Japan’s government waited more than a day to order seawater
flooding at the plant after waves generated by the largest
earthquake ever recorded in Japan knocked out power for cooling
systems, allowing heat to build to dangerous levels within the
reactor chamber. Tepco, as the utility is known, earlier
refrained from using seawater because it would corrode metal and
render the reactor useless.  “I’m aware there are many criticisms, and rightly so,”
Chief Cabinet Secretary Yukio Edano said today in response to a
question about the Journal report. “We did our best during the
whole process, and we aren’t at a stage where we can make any
judgment on that.”    Tokyo  Electric President Masataka Shimizu made the decision
when to douse the plant with sea water, said Hikaru Kuroda,
chief of nuclear facility management.  “I was there when we made the decision, but I don’t
remember when,” he told reporters in Tokyo. He said he wasn’t
aware of the Journal report and couldn’t comment.  Pumping Restarts  Troops and firefighters again started pumping seawater on
the plant today in an attempt to prevent fuel rods from
overheating, as Tepco cautioned the tsunami-damaged cooling
systems may not work even after electricity is restored. Weather
forecasts indicated changing winds could start moving radiation
closer to Tokyo this weekend.  “What we need to do now is to make sure that the situation
doesn’t get any worse,” Edano said today at a press briefing in
Tokyo. “At this point, we are dealing with the current
situation.”  Other delays also plagued Japan’s response to the nuclear
emergency, according to the Journal report. The nation’s Self-
Defense Forces didn’t take a hand in efforts to cool reactors at
the plant until March 16, by which time four of the six reactors
there were damaged and two others may have begun overheating, it
said.  ‘Difficult Decision’  “Using seawater was a difficult decision and whether the
staff at the plant reacted in a timely manner will have to be
determined at a later date,” Hidehiko Nishiyama, a deputy
director general for the Japan Nuclear and Industrial Safety
Agency, said during a press conference in Tokyo.  Engineers today missed a deadline to restore power to the
crippled plant, prolonging efforts to prevent more radiation
leaks. People living within 30 kilometers (19 miles) of the
Fukushima plant along the northeastern coast should wear masks
and long sleeves and stay out of the rain, Japan’s nuclear
safety agency said today.  Tepco will start work on repairing the cooling system of
the No. 2 reactor tomorrow morning after connecting a power
cable to the plant late today, Nishiyama of the nuclear safety
agency said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
