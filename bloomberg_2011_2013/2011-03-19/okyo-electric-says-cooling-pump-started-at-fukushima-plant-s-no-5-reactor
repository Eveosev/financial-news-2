Tokyo Electric Power Co. said it
restarted the residual-heat removal pump at the No. 5 reactor of
its stricken Fukushima Dai-Ichi nuclear plant, one of the least
damaged at the facility.  The utility began cooling the pool in the reactor that
contains spent fuel rods, it said in a statement today.
Temperatures in the pool had earlier fallen to 67.6 degrees
Celsius from 68.8 degrees,  Kyodo News  reported. Temperatures
should be kept below 25 degrees Celsius, according to
international guidelines.  The No. 5 reactor was one of three that were offline and
undergoing maintenance when the plant was crippled by the March
11 earthquake and tsunami. Firefighters and troops are spraying
sea water on the No. 1, 2, 3 and 4 reactors, which suffered more
damage and may pose a greater risk of radiation leaks.  To contact the reporter on this story:
