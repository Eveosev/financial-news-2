Saudi companies listed on the  Tadawul All Share Index (SASEIDX) , including Sabic and  Al Rajhi Bank (RJHI) , will
pay their staff two months pay in bonuses in line with a royal
decree covering Saudi civil servants,  the Saudi Press Agency 
reported.  Companies include  Kingdom Holding Co. (KINGDOM) ,  Samba Financial
Group (SAMBA) ,  Saudi Telecom Co. (STC) ,  Saudi Electricity Co. (SECO) ,  Saudi Real
Estate Co. (SRECO) , Saudi Arabian Mining Co. and  Eastern Cement (EACCO)  and the  Saudi Investment Bank (SIBC) , SPA said. They also set a minimum wage of
3,000 riyals ($800) a month for all Saudi employees, it said.  Saudi King Abdullah yesterday ordered new wage bonuses for
civil workers as part of a $93 billion financial package,
including $67 billion on housing and funds for the military and
religious groups that backed the government’s ban on domestic
protests.  Some companies will speed up the hiring of Saudi nationals
in line with the king’s instructions, the news service added,
without naming the companies.  To contact the reporter on this story:
