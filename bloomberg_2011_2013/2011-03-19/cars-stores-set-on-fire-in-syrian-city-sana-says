Cars and stores were set on fire
yesterday in  Syria ’s southern city of Daraa by people who
mingled with a crowd which gathered after Friday prayer, Syria’s
official news agency  SANA  said today.  The agency said security forces stepped in to protect
citizens and properties from the instigators who sought to
create chaos and unrest near al-Omari Mosque. SANA said another
incident occurred in the coastal city of  Banias , without
elaborating.  Syrian police have sealed Daraa following a protest in
which at least five protesters died, the Associated Press said,
citing Mazen Darwish, a Syrian rights activist. People are being
allowed out of Daraa but they cannot get back in, the news
agency cited Darwish as saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
