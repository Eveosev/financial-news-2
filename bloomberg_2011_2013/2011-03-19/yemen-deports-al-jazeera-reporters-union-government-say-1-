Yemeni authorities deported two
correspondents from the Doha-based Al Jazeera news network, the
Yemeni Information Ministry and the Journalists Syndicate said
in statements today.  Ahmed Zaidan and Abdul-Haq Saddah were ordered to leave the
country because of “professional infractions during their
coverage of the current events in Yemen,” said a statement
carried by the official SABA news agency, citing an unidentified
Information Ministry official.  Yemen’s government is trying to quell anti-government
protests. It declared a state of emergency yesterday after
government forces attacked protesters in the capital Sana’a in
the deadliest crackdown in two months of unrest.  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
