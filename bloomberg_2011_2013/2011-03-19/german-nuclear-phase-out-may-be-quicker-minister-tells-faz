German Environment Minister Norbert Roettgen said the nuclear catastrophe in  Japan  may cause a
quicker phase-out of the energy source in his country than
planned, the  Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung  said.  In light of the disaster in Japan, German reactors should
stay in operation “for as short a time as possible,” Roettgen
is cited as saying in an interview to be published tomorrow.
“Nobody’s suggesting a phase-out in one swoop but we can pull
out of the energy source quicker than planned right now.”  Chancellor  Angela Merkel ’s coalition last year passed a law
extending the average life cycle of the country’s 17 nuclear
plants by 12 years beyond 2022, the year earmarked as for a
complete shutdown of the plants in earlier legislation.  In shutting 7 of the plants temporarily last week for a
security review, the government showed that it was ready to
overrule existing legislation, Roettgen said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
