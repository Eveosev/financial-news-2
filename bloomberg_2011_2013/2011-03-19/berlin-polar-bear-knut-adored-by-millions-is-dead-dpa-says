Knut, the polar bear who drew
millions to Berlin Zoo, is dead, the DPA newswire reported.  The four-year-old polar bear collapsed and died this
morning in his pen, the newswire reported zoo official Heiner
Kloes as saying. Kloes said the zoo aims to carry out an autopsy
on the bear to find out the cause of his death.  Knut was hand-reared, notably by keeper Thomas Doerflein,
after being abandoned by his mother. He drew 3.2 million
visitors to the zoo, an incorporated company, in 2007 and
appeared on the cover of Vanity Fair magazine. Doerflein died in
2008 aged 44.  To contact the reporter on this story:
