Military rescuers dug a man out of
the ruins of his partially destroyed three-story house earlier
today in the earthquake and tsunami-ravaged city of Kesennuma,
Miyagi prefecture.  The man, aged in his 20s, returned to the home yesterday
seeking to salvage personal belongings,  Kyodo News  reported,
citing information from members of his family.  Weak and unable to speak, the man was taken to a hospital
in the city, according to a Ministry of Defense spokesman who
confirmed an earlier NHK Television report of the finding of a
survivor. A different ministry spokesman later said the military
rescuers hadnâ€™t known how long the man had been in the rubble.
Both spokesmen declined to be identified.  The toll from the magnitude-9 earthquake and tsunami that
struck  Japan  on March 11 reached 7,197 people dead and 10,905
missing as of noon local time, according to the  National Police
Agency .  To contact the reporter on this story:
