  Germany  will measure radiation
levels of people, aircraft and cars flown or shipped from  Japan ,
the Berlin-based Environment Ministry said today.  While the ministry ruled out a health problem emerging in
Germany following the nuclear disaster in Japan, the checks will
be run as “precautionary measures,” it said in an e-mailed
statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
