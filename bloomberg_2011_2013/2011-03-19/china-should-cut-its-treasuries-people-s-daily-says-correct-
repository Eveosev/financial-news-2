(Corrects source of news.)    China  should cut its holdings of
U.S. treasuries by an “appropriate amount” as prices of the
securities will trend downward, the People’s Daily website cited
Yu Yongding, a former central bank adviser, in a China Central
Television interview.  A reduction in holdings will benefit the U.S. and China, Yu
said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
