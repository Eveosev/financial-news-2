Bahrain’s Civil Service Bureau said
today that tomorrow is a normal working day for ministries and
government institutions, the official Bahrain News Agency
reported.  Bahrain’s government declared a three-month state of
emergency on March 15 after troops from  Saudi Arabia  and other
Gulf states arrived to support the administration. Bahrain has
been struggling to quell more than a month of protests led by
Shiites calling for democracy and increased civil rights in the
Sunni-ruled country.  To contact the reporter on this story:
