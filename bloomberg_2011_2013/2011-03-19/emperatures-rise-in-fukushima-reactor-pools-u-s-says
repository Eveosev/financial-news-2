Temperatures are climbing in the
spent-fuel pools for reactors 5 and 6 at the damaged Fukushima
Dai-Ichi nuclear plant in Japan, the  Nuclear Regulatory
Commission  said in a report sent to U.S. operators.  The pools “appear to be intact” and emergency power is
available to “provide cooling water flow,” the NRC said
yesterday in describing events after the March 11 earthquake and
tsunami. Water levels are low in fuel pools for units 3 and 4
and it’s not known if they are leaking, the NRC said.  The primary containment vessel for unit 2 in the six-
reactor plant may be damaged, the NRC said. Primary containment
for units 1 and 3 “remain functional” and “efforts to supply
seawater” to cool the plant’s stricken reactors persist, the
agency said.  Spent-fuel pools for units 5 and 6, which weren’t operating
at the time of the tsunami, “appear to be intact, but the
temperature of the pool water appears to be increasing,” the
NRC said.  The update on the Fukushima plant was included in a notice
to U.S. reactor operators which said they must study  Japan ’s
nuclear crisis and consider “appropriate” steps to prevent
similar problems.  The earthquake and tsunami exceeded the Fukushima plant’s
design limits, knocking out “both the off-site and on-site
power systems” needed to cool its reactors, the NRC said in the
notice.  “The NRC expects U.S. nuclear plant operators will review
the entire notice to determine how it applies to their
facilities and consider actions, as appropriate,” the agency
said in an e-mailed statement yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
