Fire raged through a refugee camp
in northeastern  India  for three hours today, killing 21 people
and injuring about 100, the  Associated Press  reported, citing
government and police officials.  Winds whipped the fire into a massive blaze that swept
across the Nifingpara camp in Tripura state before firefighters
brought it under control, the AP said, citing Police
Superintendent Darlong. Most of the thatched huts in the remote
camp located about 100 miles northeast of Tripuraâ€™s capital were
destroyed, the AP reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
