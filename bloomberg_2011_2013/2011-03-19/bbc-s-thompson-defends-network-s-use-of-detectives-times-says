Mark Thompson, director general of
the British Broadcasting Corp., said several of the network’s
projects have used the services of private investigators,
according to an interview with the  London-based Times .  “Occasionally  BBC  investigative programs have used and do
use private investigators, always under the BBC’s editorial
guidelines and under the control of the editors of the program
involved,” Thompson told the Times. “I don’t think there’s any
suggestion that I can detect of any wrongdoing.”  He also defended the U.K. state-funded BBC’s decision to
air an edition of Panorama that scrutinized the use of
detectives at the News of the World, the Times reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
