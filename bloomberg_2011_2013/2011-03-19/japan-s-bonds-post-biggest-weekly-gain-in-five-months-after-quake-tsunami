Japanese bonds posted the biggest
weekly gain in five months as the nation’s most powerful
earthquake threatened a nuclear disaster, drove the yen to a
postwar high and boosted demand for safer assets.  Yields on benchmark 10-year bonds touched a two-month low
as the central bank said it will buy more government debt to
lower borrowing costs. The yen’s appreciation prompted the Group
of Seven nations to intervene in the foreign-exchange market to
help weaken the currency. The yield spread between 40-year debt
and 10-year bonds widened to the most in three years on
speculation the government will increase debt issuance to
finance rebuilding.  “The impact of the earthquake itself is a negative for the
economy, so it’s a catalyst for bond yields to fall,” said  Masaru Hamasaki , who helps oversee about $17 billion in Tokyo as
chief strategist at Toyota Asset Management Co. “The quake will
be followed by reconstruction, which raises financial burden on
the country.”  The benchmark 10-year yield slid six basis points since
March 11, the biggest weekly drop since the period ended Oct. 8,
to 1.21 percent in Tokyo at  Japan  Bond Trading Co., the nation’s
largest interdealer debt broker. The 1.3 percent security due
March 2021 gained 0.536 yen to 100.802 yen. The yield dropped to
1.145 percent on March 15, the lowest since Jan. 5.  Ten-year bond futures for June delivery climbed 0.54 to
139.74 at the Tokyo Stock Exchange. The  Nikkei 225 (NKY)  Stock Average
lost 10 percent for the week.  Nuclear Disaster  The magnitude-9.0 earthquake on March 11 triggered a
tsunami that swept as far as 20 kilometers (12.4 miles) inland
along the northern coast, and left at least 6,539 people dead
and 10,354 missing. The government and Tokyo Electric Power Co.
are struggling to prevent a meltdown and spread of radiation at
the Fukushima Dai-Ichi power station.  The  Liberal Democratic Party  of Japan, the country’s main
opposition party, plans to seek 5 trillion yen ($61 billion) in
emergency spending to support people hit by the earthquake on
and to rebuild the devastated region,  Kyodo News  reported. The
agency cited LDP President  Sadakazu Tanigaki , who spoke at a
press conference on March 15.    Bank of Japan  Governor Masaaki Shirakawa and his board
decided on March 14 to double to 10 trillion yen a fund that
buys  government bonds , corporate debt, exchange-traded funds and
other assets. The BOJ also pumped a total of 38 trillion yen
this week into the financial system in one-day operations.  The yen fell 2.6 percent to 80.90 in  New York  yesterday
after appreciating to 76.25 on March 17, surpassing the highest
level since World War II reached in April 1995. A stronger yen
makes Japanese exports more expensive overseas and reduces the
value of overseas earnings at the nation’s companies when
repatriated.  Yield Outlook  The G-7 members agreed to sell yen as their markets open,
Japan’s Finance Minister  Yoshihiko Noda  told reporters in  Tokyo 
yesterday. Their finance ministers and central bank chiefs of
said in a joint statement after a conference call that they will
“provide any needed cooperation.”  The yield premium investors demand to hold 40-year bonds
instead of 10-year securities widened to 1.16 percentage points
on March 15, the most since April 2008.  Richard Wright, an investment manager at RBW Capital
Advisors LLC, forecast Japan’s yields will rise as stocks climb.  “You’re going to see yields go from 1.2 percent up to 3
percent in the next 12 months,” he said in an interview with
Bloomberg Television.  To contact the reporter on this story:
