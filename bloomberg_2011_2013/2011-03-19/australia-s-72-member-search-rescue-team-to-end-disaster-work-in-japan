An Australian rescue team that
specializes in finding people trapped in collapsed buildings is
ending its work in  Japan  and will return home in coming days.  The 72-strong group, which includes medical staff and
engineers, has been working in Minami Sanriku, north of Sendai,
which was devastated by the March 11 magnitude-9 earthquake and
ensuing tsunami, Australian Attorney-General Robert McClelland
said today in an e-mailed statement.  Search and rescue teams from the U.S., U.K.,  New Zealand ,  Germany  and  Switzerland  have also returned home as Japan shifts
its focus toward recovery, McClelland said. The Australian
team’s primary job was to find and recover people trapped by the
disaster using sniffer dogs from Queensland.  “The team has been searching for survivors in areas of
Northern Honshu that have been utterly devastated, tunneling
through collapsed buildings and overcoming logistical issues
such as fuel shortages and poor communications,” McClelland
said in today’s statement.  McClelland thanked the team for the “grim and difficult
work” it did in Japan.  At the request of the Japanese government, the group has
donated its 76-person tented base in Minami Kata.  To contact the reporter for this story:
