Germany’s  Maria Riesch  won the  World Cup  overall ski title over  Lindsey Vonn  of the U.S. after
the final race of the season was canceled by poor weather
conditions.  Riesch held a three-point lead over Vonn entering today’s
scheduled giant slalom in Lenzerheide, Switzerland. Officials
called off the race this morning because of warm overnight
temperatures, wet snow and fog.  “There is a crust on top of the snow and nothing
underneath,” race director Atle Skaardal said on the World Cup
 website . “It’s impossible to ski on such a soft crust. The
situation is not suitable for a giant slalom race.”  Under World Cup rules, canceled races are not rescheduled.
Vonn, 26, was attempting to win her fourth consecutive overall
title.  “Win or lose I just wanted the chance,” Vonn, who won the
downhill, super-G and super combined titles this season, said on
the  U.S. ski team’s website . “I feel devastated. But I’m
extremely proud to have been in the fight for what was one of
the most exciting seasons in ski racing history.”  Riesch, 26, finished with  1,728 points  for the season,
while Vonn had 1,725. The German took the lead by finishing
fourth in yesterday’s slalom, while Vonn was 13th. Today’s race
would have been worth 100 points to the winner.  To contact the reporter on this story:
