U.K. government forecasters are
likely to increase unemployment and deficit predictions in next
week’s budget, according to the  Times of London .  The  Office for Budget Responsibility  may have to increase
its public borrowing forecasts in the budget to be released on
March 23 because of deteriorating economic conditions, the
newspaper said, without saying where it obtained the
information. The independent office is likely to boost its
deficit forecasts for later years as well, the Times reported.  The budget will also increase the OBR’s 2011 inflation
forecast to at least 4 percent from a previous prediction of 2.8
percent, the paper reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
