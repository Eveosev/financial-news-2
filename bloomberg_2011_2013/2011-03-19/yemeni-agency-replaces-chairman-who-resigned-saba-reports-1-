Yemen’s government-run news agency
Saba today appointed a new chairman to replace Nasser Taha
Mustapha, who resigned after the most severe government
crackdown on protesters left 46 people dead.  Saba identified the new chairman as Tarek al-Shami without
referring to Mustapha’s resignation.  In a letter to the country’s president, Mustapha said he
could no longer perform his duties “especially after
yesterday’s violent events in Sana’a,” Kuwait’s official news
agency, Kuna, reported today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
