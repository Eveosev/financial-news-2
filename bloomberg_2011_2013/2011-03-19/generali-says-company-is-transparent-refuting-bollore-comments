  Assicurazioni Generali SpA (G)  said it
has always acted with transparency, refuting statements by the
company’s vice chairman  Vincent Bollore .  Generali has always acted with the “utmost transparency
toward the market and all shareholders,” the company said today
in an e-mailed statement.  Generali was responding to an interview by Bollore
published today in newspaper  Corriere della Sera , in which the
French entrepreneur said he wanted greater transparency on
investments in Eastern Europe and  Russia . Bollore told the
newspaper that the request for more transparency was behind his
decision to abstain from the Generali board’s approval of 2010
earnings.  To contact the reporter on this story:
