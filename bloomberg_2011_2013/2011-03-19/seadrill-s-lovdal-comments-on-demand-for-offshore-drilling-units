Alf Ragnar Lovdal, senior vice
president for the Asia Pacific region at  Seadrill Ltd. (SDRL) , comments
on demand for offshore drilling units such as semi-submersibles
and so-called jackup rigs. He was speaking in Singapore today.
The company has a total of 58 rigs, including 11 on order at
shipyards that will be delivered over the next three to four
years.  On  oil prices :  “We like it when it’s between $80 and $100. But we don’t
like it when oil prices are too high. Between $80 and $100 is
what we like.”  On demand for rigs for deep-water areas:  “If you go to the Gulf of Mexico, go to Brazil, West
Africa, there’s high demand for deep-water rigs. If you look at
Asia, we have two deep-water units and two to three may be in
demand going forward. But shallow water is the majority.”  On daily rates for rigs:  “For jackup rigs, we prefer to have higher rates. For
deep-water units, it’s steady.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
