Former Australian Federal Court
Judge Marcus Einfeld was released from a Sydney prison after
serving two years in jail for trying to avoid a A$77 ($76.70)
speeding fine.  The 72-year-old, speaking outside the Silverwater prison
today, told reporters that he is sorry for letting his family
and community down, the Australian Broadcasting Corp. said on
its  Web Site .  Einfeld pleaded guilty in 2009 for providing false
statements that named a dead woman as the driver of his car,
according to the ABC.  To contact the reporter for this story:
