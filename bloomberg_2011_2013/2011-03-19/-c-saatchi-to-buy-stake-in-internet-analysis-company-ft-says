  M&C Saatchi Plc (SAA)  will announce on
March 24 that it will buy a stake in  Human Digital , a social
network analysis company, the Financial Times reported today,
without saying where it got the information.  M&C Saatchi will buy 25 percent of Human Digital, Mark
Kleinman reported in his column in the FT. The company helps
clients gain insight about internet sites including Twitter, he
said. M&C Saatchi may also announce further purchases on that
day, when it is due to report full-year results, he commented,
without elaborating further.  To contact the reporter on this story:
