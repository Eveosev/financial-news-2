U.K. retailer All Saints is in
talks to sell a stake to one of three investors, including Och-
Ziff Capital Management Group LLC, the Financial Times reported,
citing unidentified people with knowledge of the situation.  All Saints is hoping to raise about 50 million pounds ($81
million) to fund expansion plans, the FT reported. The terms of
any potential investment are undecided, the newspaper said, and
hedge  fund manager  Och-Ziff may decide not to buy a stake in the
company.  Ernst & Young has been hired to sell stakes in the U.K.
clothing retailer owned by collapsed Icelandic banks Kaupthing
Bank hf and Glitnir Bank hf, the FT said. Kevin Stanford, a U.K.
entrepreneur, is an investor in the company and will own more
than 50 percent of All Saints after any stake is sold, according
to the FT.  To contact the reporter on this story:
