Mylan Inc. (MYL) , the second-biggest U.S.
maker of generic drugs, said its 2013 sales will be at the low
end of its  forecast  of $7 billion to $7.4 billion.  Chief Financial Officer John Sheehan blamed foreign
currency exchange rates, though he said the company’s sales
would still fall within the range it projected this year. The
Canonsburg, Pennsylvania-based drugmaker probably will hit its
annual earnings  forecast  of $2.75 to $2.95 a share excluding
some items, Sheehan said today at a presentation.  “We are on track to deliver on the guidance and the
commitments we made,” Sheehan said.  Mylan has focused on growing its sales through  acquisitions 
and reinvesting cash back into its businesses. Its sales have
more than tripled since 2007, when it bought Darmstadt, Germany-based  Merck KGaA (MRK) ’s generic business. This year, it announced it
would spend $1.6 billion to buy Agila Specialties, an injectable
drugs unit, from India’s  Strides Arcolab Ltd. (STR)   Foreign exchange rates have hurt U.S. drugmaker sales this
year. The  U.S. dollar   gained 2 percent  in the second quarter
against a basket of other currencies, making U.S.-produced goods
more expensive and reducing the value of sales made overseas.
Mylan reported its second-quarter earnings earlier today.  Mylan shares rose 1.3 percent to $33.98 at the close in  New
York . The stock has  gained 48 percent  in the last 12 months.  To contact the reporter on this story:
