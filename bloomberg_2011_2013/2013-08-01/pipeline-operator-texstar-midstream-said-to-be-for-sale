TexStar Midstream Services LP, the
natural-gas processor owned by EIG Global Energy Partners LLC
and Tailwater Capital, is exploring a sale, said people with
knowledge of the matter.  Evercore Partners Inc. (EVR)  is working with the San Antonio-based company on finding suitors, said the people, who asked not
to be named because the process is private. Evercore has begun
sending marketing materials to potential buyers, and first-round
bids are due by the end of August, the people said.  TexStar, which gathers and processes natural gas in the
Eagle Ford Shale of South Texas, may attract interest from
energy companies looking to expand in that region, said the
people. While the company’s market value isn’t clear, it’s
bigger than Teak Midstream LLC, another pipeline company with
Eagle Ford operations, according to one of the people.  Teak sold for $1 billion in May to  Atlas Pipeline Partners
LP. (APL)  As part of the acquisition, Atlas gained an interest in
Teak’s joint venture with TexStar, whose assets include 235
miles (378 kilometers) of pipeline, according to a statement at
the time the deal was announced.  Representatives at Evercore and EIG declined to comment.
Officials at Dallas-based Tailwater and TexStar didn’t reply to
requests for comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
