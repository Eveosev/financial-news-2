Catamaran Corp. (CCT)  surged to a record as
the pharmacy benefits manager for drugstores boosted its full-year earnings forecast after agreeing to buy competitor Restat
LLC for $409.5 million.  The  shares  rose 9.1 percent to C$59.03 in Toronto, the
highest close since trading began in 1984, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. They have climbed 26 percent this year as
the Standard & Poorâ€™s/TSX Composite Index increased 1.3 percent.  Catamaran, based in Lisle,  Illinois , raised its outlook for
adjusted 2013 earnings per share to $1.87 to $1.92, from its May
forecast of $1.81 to $1.88. The average of 22 analyst estimates
compiled by Bloomberg was $1.84. The company cited the purchase
of Milwaukee-based Restat and a 10-year partnership agreement
with  Cigna Corp. (CI)  announced in June.  The acquisition of closely held Restat is expected to add
about $650 million a year in drug spending and $45 million of
annual earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and
amortization, Catamaran said. The transaction, slated to close
in the fourth quarter, will be funded through a revolving  credit
line  and cash on hand, the company said.  Catamaran today also reported second-quarter adjusted
 earnings  of 49 cents a share, beating the 44-cent average of
20 analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Revenue doubled to
$3.38 billion, trailing the $3.46 billion average estimate.  To contact the reporter on this story:
