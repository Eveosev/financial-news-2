Former Ukrainian Prime Minister  Yulia Tymoshenko  filed a new court appeal in her home country to have
her conviction overturned after the  European Court  of  Human
Rights  ruled her pre-trial detention was unreasonable.  The appeal in Kiev first needs to be heard by the First
High Specialized Court before it is passed to the Supreme Court,
her attorney, Serhiy Vlasenko, said today in a  statement  on
Tymoshenko’s website. The government so far has not used its
three-month right to challenge the April 30 ruling by the
Strasbourg-based court.  “We are looking forward to when our appeal would be passed
on during the next 15 days,” Vlasenko said.  Tymoshenko was convicted in October 2011 of abusing her
power as prime minister by signing a 2009 natural-gas agreement
with Russia that President  Viktor Yanukovych  says costs his
country $6 billion a year more than it should. She denies
wrongdoing, saying the Ukrainian leader engineered the charges
to silence her opposition views.  Tymoshenko’s imprisonment before last year’s parliamentary
elections is an example of selective justice, according to the
European Union, which has delayed signing a pact to bolster ties
with Ukraine because of the case.  Yanukovych, whose 2004 victory in a presidential ballot was
overturned during the Orange Revolution that Tymoshenko helped
lead, has accused the former premier of involvement in crimes
including a murder.  The EU has told Yanukovych to resolve issues of selective
justice by May in order to sign a so-called Association
Agreement that includes a free-trade accord in November in
 Lithuania , when the country holds the EU’s rotating presidency.  To contact the reporter on this story:
