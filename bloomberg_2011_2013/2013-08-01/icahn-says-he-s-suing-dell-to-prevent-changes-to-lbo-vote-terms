Carl Icahn , the billionaire investor
who has been working to scuttle a $24.4 billion leveraged buyout
of computer maker  Dell Inc. (DELL) , said he is filing a complaint that
seeks to stop the company from changing the record date for
voting on the deal.  In a statement today, Icahn said he has begun litigation
against Dell and its board to prevent the company from setting a
new record date; to stop Michael Dell and his affiliates from
voting any shares acquired since Feb. 5, the day the deal was
announced; to prevent the company from changing the stockholder
voting requirements; and to get a declaration that the board
breached its fiduciary duties. Icahn is also seeking damages for
any losses, according to the statement.  Michael Dell  and Silver Lake Management LLC originally
offered $13.65 a share for the struggling maker of personal
computers. Icahn and other large shareholders have opposed the
deal, saying the bid undervalues the company, and Icahn has
proposed an alternative plan that would keep Dell publicly
traded.  The buyout group offered to raise its bid by 10 cents a
share on the condition that the board change the rules that
counted abstentions as votes against the deal. While the board
said yesterday it was unwilling to change those terms, it said
it was open to changing the date of record to give more
shareholders the chance to participate.  Icahn’s filing in Delaware Chancery Court couldn’t
immediately be confirmed in court records.  To contact the reporter on this story:
