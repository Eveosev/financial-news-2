Germany said it probably won’t follow
smart-meter guidance from the European Union -- which has
recommended that 80 percent of homes install the devices by 2020
-- because such a move would be too costly for consumers.  The EU proposal is “inadvisable” for Germany, the  Economy
Ministry  said in a  statement , citing a  study  it commissioned
from consultants Ernst & Young. For users with low power
consumption, the installation cost would be greater than the
achievable energy savings, it said.  “The results show that we in Germany have to expand smart
measuring systems and meters selectively and in line with the
energy switch,” Deputy Economy Minister Stefan Kapferer said,
referring to the country’s shift away from nuclear generation
and toward renewable power.  Smart meters allow consumers to monitor energy use and
costs, and relay the data to suppliers to help them manage
demand. Germany, which seeks to more than triple the share of
renewables to 80 percent of consumption by 2050, has yet to
adopt a firm policy on the devices.  The study on  Germany , which has about 48 million
traditional meters, “disappointed some in the industry, who had
hoped for a stronger recommendation for a mass-market rollout,”
Albert Cheung, an analyst at Bloomberg New Energy Finance, said
today by e-mail. “This is still a positive development as it
clarifies the roles and responsibilities for smart metering,
where uncertainty had previously stymied development.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
