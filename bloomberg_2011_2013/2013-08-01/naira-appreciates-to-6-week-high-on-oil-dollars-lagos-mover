Nigeria ’s naira rallied to its
strongest level in more than six weeks against the dollar after
 oil companies  in Africa’s biggest crude producer sold the U.S.
currency, boosting supply.  The naira appreciated a second day, gaining 0.6 percent to
159.65 per dollar at 2:14 p.m. in Lagos, the commercial capital,
the highest on a closing basis since June 24. The move was the
biggest gain today among 24 African currencies tracked by
Bloomberg.  “A combination of foreign-exchange sales from oil
companies and corporate dollar supply supported the currency,”
 Samir Gadio , a London-based emerging-markets strategist at
Standard Bank Group Ltd., said in an e-mail. “Additionally, the
market expects state-owned oil company foreign-exchange flows to
hit the system in the short term.”  Oil companies, which sell the U.S. currency mainly at the
month’s end to meet domestic expenses, are the second-biggest
supplier of dollars after the  Central Bank of Nigeria . The
Abuja-based institution auctions foreign exchange on Mondays and
Wednesdays. It  sold  $598 million this week, little changed from
$600 million in the previous five days.  The bank’s Monetary Policy Committee left its  benchmark
interest rate  at a record 12 percent for an 11th consecutive
meeting on July 23 to protect the currency of  Africa ’s second-biggest economy. It introduced a 50 percent cash reserve
requirement on public-sector funds after warning about the risk
of excess liquidity.  Yields on Nigeria’s $500 million Eurobonds due January 2021
fell 2 basis points, or 0.02 percentage point, to 5.5 percent.
Borrowing costs on local-currency debt due January 2022 rose 7
basis points to 13.75 percent yesterday, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  Ghana ’s cedi was unchanged at 2.0650 per dollar in the
capital, Accra.  To contact the reporter on this story:
