Cameco Corp. (CCO) , the world’s third-largest uranium producer, will sell less of the nuclear fuel via
its German trading unit than previously planned because of the
decline in the price of the commodity.  Sales volumes will be 8 million to 10 million pounds, down
from an earlier projection of 9 million to 11 million, the
Canadian company said today in a statement. It now sees the
unit’s 2013 sales at C$450 million ($435.2 million) to C$550
million, from C$500 million to C$600 million previously.  Cameco bought Nukem Energy GmbH for 107 million euros ($142
million) in January and assumed about 79 million euros of net
debt, according to the statement, to boost sales of uranium from
non-mining sources such as decommissioned nuclear warheads.  Uranium spot prices have fallen 27 percent in the past year
amid delays in resuming electricity output from nuclear power
plants in  Japan  following the March 2011 earthquake and tsunami.  Second-quarter net income rose to 9 Canadian cents a share
from 1 cent a year earlier, Saskatoon, Saskatchewan-based Cameco
also said in the statement. Excluding derivative losses and
other one-time items, profit was 15 cents, missing the 18-cent
average of 14 analysts’ estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  Sales rose 49 percent to C$421 million, trailing the
C$555.8 million average of eight estimates.  The shares fell 1.6 percent to C$20.53 in Toronto.  Uranium for immediate delivery was at $36.50 a pound
yesterday, according to data compiled by Metal Bulletin.  Cameco is the largest uranium producer after KazAtomProm,
 Kazakhstan ’s state-run nuclear entity, and  Areva SA (AREVA)  of  France ,
according to the  World Nuclear Association .  To contact the reporter on this story:
