A veteran lawmaker from Britain’s
opposition Labour Party said its leader, Ed Miliband, is failing
to set the political agenda and expressed concern about the
fragility of its opinion-poll lead.  “I have difficulty knowing what we stand for now,” George Mudie, a member of Parliament since 1992, told BBC Radio 4’s
“World at One” program today. “I think often at the moment
the government are setting the agenda, making the weather and
we’re responding to it. Tony Blair and Gordon Brown never did
that,” he said, naming Miliband’s predecessors.  Mudie, a former education minister and Labour whip,
questioned whether the party’s poll lead of about six percentage
points over Prime Minister David Cameron’s Conservatives would
be “firm enough” to withstand the 2015 general-election
campaign. Labour’s advantage has narrowed in recent weeks, amid
signs that the  economy is strengthening .  Mudie spoke out in 2006 to urge Blair to “name a date”
for stepping down as Labour leader prime minister and handing
over power to Brown.  To contact the reporter on this story:
