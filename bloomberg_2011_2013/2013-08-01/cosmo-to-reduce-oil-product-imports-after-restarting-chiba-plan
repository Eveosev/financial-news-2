Cosmo Oil Co. (5007) , a Japanese refiner
partly owned by the government of  Abu Dhabi , plans to reduce
imports of gasoline feedstock and other products after its Chiba
plant restarted two crude-distillation units.  The company bought about 100,000 kiloliters of products a
month in the quarter ended June 30, Kenichi Taki, general
manager of the accounting department, said today in Tokyo.  Restarts of the crude units at Chiba, near Tokyo, were
delayed following an asphalt leak in June 2012. Cosmo Oil said
today it had a net loss of 4.67 billion yen ($47 million) in the
April-June quarter, while maintaining an earlier forecast for a
full-year profit of 16 billion yen.  The shutdown of the Chiba refinery “was a big factor in
Cosmo Oil’s  net loss ,” as it had to import products to make up
for lost capacity, Hidetoshi Shioda, a Tokyo-based analyst at
SMBC Nikko Securities Inc., said by phone last week.  The company plans to boost exports of middle distillates to
1.54 million kiloliters this fiscal year from 45,000 kiloliters
a year earlier, it said in a statement today.  Cosmo Oil restarted the No. 2 crude distillation unit at
the Chiba refinery on July 24 after planned maintenance. The
company will complete the restart of secondary units at the
plant later this year, Taki said.  “We are planning to make a profit by flexibly selling
products at home and overseas and secure funds to resume
dividend payments,” Taki said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
