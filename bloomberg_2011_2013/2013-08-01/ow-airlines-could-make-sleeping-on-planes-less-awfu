Recently Westin Hotels & Resorts, which sparked the trend of brand-name beds in hotels worldwide, announced that its signature Heavenly bedding would take flight on Delta, if only in the airline's BusinessElite cabin. Sounds great in theory—who wouldn't want a plush comforter on an overnight international flight?—but does anyone really think that a certain type of duvet and pillow can turn something that must be endured into something that can be enjoyed? Let’s face it: Sleeping on planes sucks. I'd even go so far as to say that sleeping in business class—or, rather, attempting to—sucks. Before you accuse me of being a spoiled member of the one percent, remember that international biz-class passengers pay many thousands of dollars (or many thousands of miles) for those forward-cabin seats specifically so that they can get a few desperately needed hours of sleep. By claiming that they now offer “ the best possible sleep experience in the skies ,” Westin and Delta seem to be suggesting that all that’s needed for a decent night’s sleep in the air is a fancy duvet. Sorry, but no bedding, however heavenly, is going to magically transform Delta’s business-class seats into those of Singapore Airlines or Emirates. Just in case Delta—or any U.S. airline—actually wants to get serious about helping us sleep, I thought I’d offer up a few suggestions in addition to better bedding. Here’s my overnight-flight wish list. What’s on yours? • "Lie-flat seats" that are actually flat. Because if your "lie-flat seat" slants downward rather than staying horizontal, you have to grip the seat all night to keep from sliding off. • Dinner served right after take-off, as opposed to stretched out over three hours. Better yet, skip the in-flight meal and feed me in the lounge before I get on the plane, so I can sack out right after take-off. • A comfortable cabin temperature—one that doesn't get cranked up after meals until it's so hot you have to kick off all that Heavenly bedding. • How about Westin Heavenly pajamas to change into? Because high-thread-count softness doesn't do you much good if you're lying in it fully clothed. (Maybe one of the biz-class lavatories could be used as a changing room.) • Ear plugs that actually stay in your ears. (Mack's silicone ear plugs, for instance, not those generic foam ones that fall right out). • No unnecessary announcements over the P.A. system. Followed by the same unnecessary announcements in a different language. • A "seatbelt fastened" indicator at each seat. Because, what with all that billowy bedding, your fastened seatbelt could easily disappear while you're dozing. Surely there's a way to signal "my seatbelt is fastened" that doesn't necessitate being woken up by a flight attendant every few minutes? • Baby-scream-cancelling headphones (a notch above the noise-cancelling ones). • Slamming-overhead-bin-cancelling headphones (another notch yet). • A cold beer. Why is the beer always warm? It's minus 30 degrees outside. Can't they chill the beer? • Not being woken for breakfast a full two hours before landing. Because who wants breakfast when you're still stuffed from the three-hour dinner? • Last but hardly least, Westin Heavenly bedding for the folks in coach. Because, given the dearth of blankets, they're the ones who need it most. What's on  your  overnight-flight wish list? Write to us and let us know. More From  Condé Nast Traveler :
