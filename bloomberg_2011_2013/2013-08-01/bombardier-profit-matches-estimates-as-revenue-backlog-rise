Bombardier Inc. (BBD/B)  reported quarterly
profit that matched analysts’ estimates as sales rose more than
expected and the backlog of future contracts reached a record.  Excluding some costs and gains, second-quarter earnings
dropped to $158 million, or 9 cents a share, from $167 million,
or 9 cents, a year earlier, Montreal-based Bombardier said in a
statement today. Results matched the  average  of 21 estimates
compiled by Bloomberg. Revenue rose to $4.43 billion, beating
the $4.31 billion average projection, while the backlog climbed
to $65.5 billion from $64.9 billion at the end of last year.  Bombardier is working toward the debut flight of its
CSeries jetliner within the next few weeks, after three delays
since November. Bombardier has said it expects the CSeries to be
a key contributor in almost doubling annual revenue in the next
decade, garnering $5 billion to $8 billion a year.  “The key catalyst for Bombardier is tied to the CSeries
first flight which has slipped from end of June into late
August,”  Peter Arment , an analyst at Sterne, Agee & Leach Inc.,
said yesterday in a note to clients. “While the mini-delays are
a drag on the overall schedule planned for 2014, the momentum
for Bombardier should continue to trade favorably as there are
several catalysts tied to first flight.”  Bombardier’s widely traded Class B shares slid 3.3 percent
to C$4.96 in Toronto yesterday, cutting their gain this year to
32 percent.  Canada ’s benchmark Standard & Poor’s/TSX Composite
Index has climbed 0.4 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
