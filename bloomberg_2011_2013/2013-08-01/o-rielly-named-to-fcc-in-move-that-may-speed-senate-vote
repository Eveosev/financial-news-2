President  Barack Obama  named Michael
O’Rielly, a congressional aide, to a Republican seat on the
Federal Communications Commission, setting up a potential Senate
vote to approve a new Democratic chairman at the regulatory
agency.  O’Rielly, who advises Senator John Cornyn, a Texas
Republican, would fill one of two vacant FCC seats, according to
a White House announcement released by e-mail. The other seat is
for Obama’s choice for FCC chairman, former cable and wireless
lobbyist Tom Wheeler, who was named May 1 to succeed  Julius
Genachowski .  Senators usually pair a Democratic and Republican FCC
nominee before voting to approve them, Senator John Thune, a
South Dakota Republican, said July 30 as the Commerce Committee
cleared Wheeler.  Resignations have left the five-member commission with one
Republican and two Democrats, including Acting Chairwoman Mignon Clyburn, since May.  To contact the reporter on this story:
