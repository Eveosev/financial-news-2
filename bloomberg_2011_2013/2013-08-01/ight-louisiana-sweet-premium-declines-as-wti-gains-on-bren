Light Louisiana Sweet weakened
against West Texas Intermediate as the U.S. benchmark gained
about $1 today on international standard-bearer Brent.  WTI’s discount to Brent narrowed $1.02 to $1.65 a barrel
based on settlement prices. When Brent drops versus WTI, it
decreases the value of low-sulfur U.S. grades that compete with
West African and North Sea oil priced against the European
benchmark.  Light Louisiana Sweet weakened by 90 cents to a premium of
$4.80 a barrel over WTI at 2:18 p.m.  New York  time, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. Heavy Louisiana Sweet’s premium to
WTI narrowed 80 cents to $4.35.  Mars Blend’s premium to WTI lost $1.05 to a discount of 25
cents a barrel. Poseidon fell 75 cents to a discount of 30 cents
a barrel. The premium for  Thunder Horse , which has a lower
sulfur content than Mars, Poseidon and Southern Green Canyon,
was unchanged at $3. Southern Green Canyon was unchanged at a
75-cent discount to WTI.  To contact the reporter on this story:
