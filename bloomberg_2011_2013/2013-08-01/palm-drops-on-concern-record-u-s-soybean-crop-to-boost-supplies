Palm oil  declined on speculation that
a record soybean crop in the U.S. will add to global oilseed
supplies, reducing demand for the tropical oil.  The contract for delivery in October lost as much as 0.6
percent to 2,222 ringgit ($686) a metric ton on the Bursa
 Malaysia  Derivatives, and was at 2,231 ringgit by the close of
the morning trade in Kuala Lumpur. Futures dropped 4.6 percent
last month, the most since February, after reaching the lowest
level since October 2009 on July 26.  The U.S. soybean harvest will climb 13 percent to 93.1
million tons, bringing global production to 285.9 million tons
in 2013-2014 from 268 million tons a year earlier, according to
the  U.S. Department of Agriculture . Palm oil output, accounting
for 35 percent of world cooking-oil supply, will expand 5
percent to 58.1 million tons, the USDA estimates.  “This negativity across all oilseeds still continues
because there are hopes of high production when it comes to
soybeans in the U.S.,” said Prathamesh Mallya, an analyst at
AnandRathi Commodities Ltd. in Mumbai. “That will probably
reduce demand for palm.”  Palm oil shipments from Malaysia gained 5.3 percent to 1.39
million tons, according to SGS (Malaysia) Sdn. This compares
with a 24 percent drop in the first half of the month and a 6
percent decline in the first 25 days of July, SGS estimates show.  Expectations of lower production in the first half of
August due to the Eid festival holidays may support prices, said
Chandran Sinnasamy, head of trading at LT International Futures
Sdn. in  Kuala Lumpur . Indonesian markets are closed the whole of
next week, while Malaysia will be closed on Aug. 8 and 9.
Indonesia and Malaysia are the biggest palm oil producers.  Soybean oil  for delivery in December advanced 0.2 percent
to 42.80 cents a pound on the Chicago Board of Trade. Soybeans
for November were little changed at $12.07 a bushel, after
touching $11.9425 yesterday, the lowest intraday price for a
most-active contract since Jan. 31, 2012.  Refined palm oil for January delivery were little changed
at 5,422  yuan  ($885) a ton on the  Dalian Commodity Exchange ,
while soybean oil lost 0.2 percent to 7,014 yuan.  To contact the reporter on this story:
