The Markit Economics  final index  of
U.S. manufacturing increased in July to 53.7 from 51.9 a month
earlier, the London-based group said today.  The median  forecast  in a Bloomberg survey of 12 economists
called for the figure to hold at the preliminary July reading of
53.2. Estimates ranged from 53 to 54. A reading greater than 50
for the purchasing managers’ measure indicates expansion. The
Markit purchasers figure is based on responses from 85 percent
to 90 percent of companies in a poll of more than 600 American
manufacturers.  The data follow recent reports that showed industrial
production climbed in June, while manufacturing in the  New York 
and  Philadelphia (OUTFGAF)  regions expanded more than forecast in July.  Manufacturing in the 17-nation euro area expanded in July
at a faster pace than initially estimated as the industry
resumed growth after two years of contraction, Markit figures
showed today. The factory gauge increased to 50.3 last month,
topping the 50 mark for the first time since July 2011.  In  China , the world’s second-biggest economy behind the
U.S., manufacturing gauges today gave a mixed picture and the
government in Beijing pledged to prevent economic growth from
slipping below a “reasonable” level.  To contact the reporter on this story:
