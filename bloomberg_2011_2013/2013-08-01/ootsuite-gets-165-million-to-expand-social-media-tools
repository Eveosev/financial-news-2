HootSuite Media Inc. , a developer of
software used to manage social-networking activity, has raised
$165 million from investors in one of the largest venture
capital deals in  North America  this year.  Insight Venture Partners led the second financing round,
which also included  Accel Partners  and OMERS Ventures,
Vancouver-based HootSuite said in a statement today. Terms of
the investment weren’t disclosed.  HootSuite plans to use the funds to add more than 100
employees in the next six months and expand to new markets
including Asia and  Latin America , Chief Executive Officer Ryan Holmes said in an interview. The investment will also help
HootSuite build its business without seeking funds via an
initial public offering, he said.  “I personally would love to take this company to an
acquisition or an IPO,” Holmes said. “That being said, my goal
right now is building an amazing business. I think this raise
takes some of that pressure off.”  The company is also in talks to make at least two
acquisitions, Holmes said, declining to name the targets.  HootSuite has almost doubled in size, to 300 employees, in
the past year as it adds tools to help businesses manage their
presence on  Facebook Inc. (FB) , Twitter Inc. and other social sites.  The financing is the third-biggest venture deal for a North
American technology company this year, behind the $200 million
investment in mobile-device management company AirWatch LLC and
online bulletin board Pinterest Inc., according to data compiled
by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
