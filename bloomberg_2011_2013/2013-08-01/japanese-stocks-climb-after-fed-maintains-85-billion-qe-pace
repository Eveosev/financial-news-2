Japanese stocks  rose after the
 Federal Reserve  kept its bond-buying program at current levels.  The  Topix index  climbed 0.5 percent to 1,137.08 as of 9:04
a.m. in Tokyo. The gauge slid 0.2 percent last month, capping a
third straight monthly drop, the longest stretch since the
period ended September 2011. The Nikkei 225 Stock Average
increased 0.1 percent to 13,683.32 today.  The Fed pledged yesterday to keep buying $85 billion in
bonds every month, saying persistently low inflation may hamper
expansion in the worldâ€™s biggest economy. The Topix remains 32
percent higher for the year through yesterday amid optimism
Prime Minister Shinzo Abe will push through reforms while the
 Bank of Japan  continues record stimulus.  Of the 143 companies on the Topix measure that have posted
quarterly results and for which Bloomberg has estimates, 54
percent beat projections.  To contact the reporter on this story:
