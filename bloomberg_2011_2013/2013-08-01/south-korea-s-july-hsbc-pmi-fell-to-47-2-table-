Following is the July HSBC
 South Korea  Manufacturing PMI as compiled by  Markit Economics .  The HSBC South Korea PMI is designed to provide a single
figure snap-shot for South Korea’s economy. It is based on a
survey of over 400 purchasing executives and is designed to
provide the most up-to-date picture of business conditions
in the South Korea private sector.  Anything above 50 indicates expansion; below 50, a
contraction. The greater the divergence from 50, the greater
the rate of change.  To contact the reporter on this story:
