Bureau of Statistics  and China Federation of Logistics and
Purchasing said today in Beijing. That compared with the 49.8
median forecast of 35 analysts in a Bloomberg News survey and
June’s 50.1 level. Readings above 50 indicate expansion.  “While the economic growth has moderated, steel demand in
property and infrastructure is still pretty good,” said Wu
Zhili, Shenzhen-based analyst at Shenhua Futures Co.  The average  spot price  for rebar fell 0.2 percent to 3,454
