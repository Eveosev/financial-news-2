U.K. stocks  advanced for a fourth
day, pushing the  FTSE 100 (UKX)  Index to a two-month high, as
commodity producers climbed on Chinese manufacturing growth and
 Lloyds Banking Group Plc (LLOY)  led lenders higher.  Glencore Xstrata Plc and Rio Tinto Group rose at least 2.5
percent after a report showed manufacturing in  China 
unexpectedly expanded last month. Lloyds surged to the highest
price since October 2010 after saying it aims to resume dividend
payments.  Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA)  slid the most in two years after
profit slumped 20 percent.  The FTSE 100 climbed 60.92 points, or 0.9 percent, to
6,681.98 at the close in London, the highest since May 28. The
gauge  soared 6.5 percent  in July, the biggest monthly gain since
2011, as the Federal Reserve said it remains flexible on the
pace of bond buying and as the Bank of England provided forward
guidance on interest rates. The broader FTSE All-Share Index
added 1 percent today, while Ireland’s ISEQ Index increased 1.6
percent to its highest level since September 2008.  “There’s clearly a case for owning stocks exposed to the
Chinese economy,” said Alan Higgins, U.K. chief investment
officer for Coutts & Co. in  London . “China will go through a
great painful process to become a consumption-driven economy,
but it does have the resources to get through. That’s great for
European exporters.”  The volume of shares changing hands in FTSE 100 companies
today was 43 percent greater than the 30-day average, data
compiled by Bloomberg show.  Mining Companies  The FTSE 350 Mining Index advanced 3.3 percent, after
completing its biggest monthly rally in 18 months, as base
metals jumped on the London Metal Exchange. The official index
measuring China’s  manufacturing output  rose to 50.3 in July from
50.1 in June. Economists surveyed by Bloomberg had predicted a
drop to 49.8. Readings above 50 mean that activity increased.  Glencore and Rio Tinto increased 4.3 percent to 289.55
pence and 2.8 percent to 3,038 pence, respectively.  Anglo
American Plc (AAL) , which owns the world’s largest platinum producer,
climbed 5.3 percent to 1,483 pence.  A report from Markit Economics and the Chartered Institute
of Purchasing and Supply showed that  factory production  in the
U.K. climbed in July at a faster pace than economists had
predicted. The gauge rose to 54.6, its highest level in 28
months and more than the 52.8 reading projected by economists.  In the U.S., manufacturing expanded at the fastest pace in
more than two years, according to the Institute for Supply
Management’s factory index.  BOE Decision  The Bank of England held its  asset-purchase target  at 375
billion pounds ($570 billion), in line with all but one of 42
economist projections compiled by Bloomberg. The central bank
also left its benchmark interest rate at a low of 0.5 percent,
matching all survey  predictions . Governor Mark Carney will
present the Monetary Policy Committee’s review of how to manage
policy expectations next week. He signaled last month that rates
will remain low for an extended period of time.  The European Central Bank also left its benchmark interest
rate unchanged at 0.5 percent today, in line with the median
estimate in a Bloomberg survey of  economists .  Lloyds jumped 8.1 percent to 74 pence. The bank said it
will start talks with regulators about a timetable for resuming
payouts. Lloyds last paid a cash dividend in 2008, before it
sought a bailout from the U.K. government, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. The lender also posted profit before
exceptional items that rose to 2.9 billion pounds in the first
half, beating the 2.3 billion-pound  average estimate of analysts 
surveyed by Bloomberg.  Britain’s Banks  London-listed lenders  rose, with state-owned Royal Bank of
Scotland Group Plc adding 5 percent to 333.5 pence, its largest
increase in two weeks. RBS will post half-year financial results
tomorrow.  Shell slid 4.7 percent to 2,133 pence, its biggest decline
since August 2011. Europe’s largest oil producer said profit
excluding one-time items and inventory changes slid 20 percent
to $4.6 billion in the second quarter because of disruption to
its oil and gas pipelines in Nigeria. Earnings missed the
average analyst estimate of $6 billion in a Bloomberg survey.  Aggreko Plc (AGK)  slumped 7.7 percent to 1,643 pence, the largest
decline in seven months. The provider of mobile power generators
said the pace of orders at its Power Projects unit, which
accounted for more than  40 percent  of sales last year, may not
pick up in the immediate future.  To contact the reporter on this story:
