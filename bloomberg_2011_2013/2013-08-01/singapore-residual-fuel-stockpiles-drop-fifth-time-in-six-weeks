Residual-fuel stockpiles fell 2.9
percent in Singapore,  Asia â€™s largest oil-trading and storage
center, according to a unit of the Trade and Industry Ministry.  Onshore inventories including  fuel oil  and low-sulfur waxy
residue and excluding bitumen dropped by 601,000 barrels to 19.9
million in the week to yesterday,  International Enterprise
Singapore  said in an e-mailed statement today. Supplies declined
for the fifth time in six weeks.  Middle-distillate stockpiles including gasoil and kerosene
decreased 602,000 barrels, or 7.1 percent, to 7.9 million,
according to the data. Supplies slid from the highest level in
five weeks.  Inventories of  light distillates  including naphtha,
reformate and gasoline were down 103,000 barrels, or 1.1
percent, at 9 million, the data show.  The trade ministry unit surveys refiners, oil traders and
storage terminals on a voluntary basis. The results may exclude
some offshore storage capacity, IE  Singapore  said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
