Nintendo (7974)  Co. profit surged as the
weaker yen masked plunging sales of Wii consoles and DS handheld
players by the world’s biggest video-game machine maker.  Net income was 8.62 billion yen ($88 million) in the three
months ended June, compared with a  loss  of 17.2 billion yen a
year earlier, the Kyoto, Japan-based company said in a statement
yesterday. Nintendo booked a 16.9 billion-yen gain from currency
movements in the period.  President Satoru Iwata took the helm of  U.S. operations  to
drive sales growth at the creator of  Super Mario  before  Sony
Corp. (6758)  and  Microsoft Corp. (MSFT)  introduce new consoles for this year’s
holiday shopping season. Yet combined sales for Nintendo’s
hardware totaled 1.8 million units in the quarter ended June,
down from 3.1 million units a year earlier, as more customers
migrated to mobile devices for playing online games.  “It’s difficult to make a positive assessment for a
company that’s posting a drop in sales,” said Masamitsu Ohki, a
 fund manager  at the Stats Investment Management Co. hedge fund
in Tokyo. “The only reason the company managed to post net
income was a weaker yen. Sales of its hardware look terrible.”  Sales fell 3.8 percent to 81.55 billion yen from 84.8
billion yen a year earlier. Nintendo said almost 64 percent of
revenue last quarter came from overseas.  Net income surpassed the 1.3 billion-yen median estimate of
three analysts surveyed by  Bloomberg News . The company’s
operating loss narrowed to 4.9 billion yen from a loss of 10.3
billion yen.  Forecasts Maintained  Nintendo rose 5.1 percent to 13,050 yen as of close of
trade in Tokyo, extending this year’s gain to 44 percent. The
benchmark Topix index has risen 35 percent this year.  A weaker Japanese currency is boosting the repatriated
value of overseas earnings for the nation’s exporters. The yen
depreciated about 5 percent against the  U.S. dollar  last quarter
and about 20 percent in the 12 months ended June 30.  Nintendo posted valuation gain from its foreign reserves,
and the company affirmed its forecast for operating income of
100 billion yen and net income of 55 billion yen in the 12
months ending March.  “I don’t think Nintendo can achieve its commitment of 100
billion yen because it has no way to improve,” said  Mitsushige Akino , chief fund manager at Ichiyoshi Asset Management Co. in
Tokyo. “It cannot go back to the age when the Wii and DS sold
well as there now are many devices for killing time, such as
smartphones and tablets.”  Smartphones Surge  The company sold 1.4 million 3DS units in the quarter, down
from 1.86 million a year earlier. It also sold 160,000 units of
the Wii U, pushing the overall total to 3.6 million since its
debut in November.  By comparison, smartphone shipments surged 47 percent to
229.6 million in the second quarter from a year earlier, market
researcher  Strategy Analytics  said July 26.  “Wii U hardware sales still have a negative impact on
Nintendo’s profits,” the company said.  Since reaching an all-time high in November 2007, the
company has lost more than 80 percent of its value.  Nintendo expects to sell 9 million Wii U consoles this
fiscal year, it said in April. Nintendo forecast 3DS sales of 18
million, up from 13.95 million last year.  PlayStation, Xbox  Nintendo said last month it sold 225,000 units of the 3DS
in the U.S. in June. Games including “Animal Crossing: New
Leaf” helped the player maintain its position as the best-seller, according to market researcher NPD Group Inc.  Nintendo is scheduled to release “Mario & Luigi: Dream
Team” for the 3DS on Aug. 11 in the U.S.  The machine also was  Japan ’s best-selling gaming device in
June with sales of 192,487 units, according to market researcher
Enterbrain Inc. Sony’s PlayStation Vita sold 81,912 units in the
same period, Tokyo-based Enterbrain said July 9.  Global software sales for the 3DS jumped 49 percent to 11
million units last quarter, Nintendo said. Still, U.S. video-game retail sales fell 15 percent to $593.3 million in June,
 Port Washington , New York-based NPD said.  The Wii U, priced starting at $300, features a 6.2-inch
touchscreen controller that lets users wirelessly connect to the
console and shift the display between the device and a TV. It is
the industry’s first new home-gaming console since 2006, the
year Nintendo released its predecessor, the Wii.  Sony’s PlayStation 4, unveiled in June, will start at $399
when released in the U.S. later this year. While Microsoft’s
Xbox One will have a price tag of $499, it includes improved
Kinect voice commands and motion sensing, content partnerships
with the  National Football League  and access to Skype video
calls.  To contact the reporter on this story:
