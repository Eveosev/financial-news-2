New York  Yankee  Alex Rodriguez  is
negotiating a possible ban with  Major League Baseball  over
allegations the infielder had links to a Florida facility that
supplied performance-enhancing drugs, ESPN.com reported.  Baseball officials have told the player’s attorney that he
may face a lifetime ban for the involvement with the Biogenesis
clinic and an attempt to coerce at least one witness, the
broadcaster said, citing unidentified sources.  League executives are trying to keep the player off the
field for next season without having to go through an
arbitration hearing, ESPN said. Rodriguez attorney David
Cornwell said the infielder will fight any suspension, with the
league expected to issue bans to players involved with the
clinic in the next few days, the website said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
