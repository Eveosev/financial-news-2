Brazil  expects to have 1,400
megawatts of solar panels producing power on buildings by 2022,
up from about 11 megawatts this year, as equipment costs fall.  The forecast may be included in the country’s next energy
plan, which the Ministry of Mines and Energy is drafting now,
Mauricio Tolmasquim, president of the government energy-research
agency Empresa de Pesquisa Energetica, said today at a
conference in Sao Paulo.  The price of solar panels has fallen to 83 cents a watt
from about $4 dollars in 2008 and may reach 52 cents by 2020,
Jenny Chase, head solar analyst with Bloomberg New Energy
Finance, said today in an e-mail.  “Photovoltaic panels have been getting cheaper and cheaper
year after year,” Tolmasquim said. “We’re not discounting the
possibility” that installations will be higher than the
forecast.  To contact the reporter on this story:
