Rubber rebounded from a two-week low
as oil rallied while manufacturing in China, the biggest user,
unexpectedly strengthened and the  Federal Reserve  maintained its
bond-buying program to support recovery.  The contract for delivery in January gained as much as 2.1
percent to 245.3 yen a kilogram ($2,505 a metric ton) on the
 Tokyo  Commodity Exchange and was at 244.1 yen at 10:52 a.m. The
most-active contract settled at the lowest since July 16
yesterday, paring gains for July to 1.7 percent.  Oil in  New York  extended gains after capping the biggest
monthly rally since August. China’s manufacturing unexpectedly
strengthened in July, suggesting a slowdown in the second-largest economy may be stabilizing as the government rolls out
targeted measures to support growth. The Fed, which has floated
the prospect of reductions to its stimulus program should
economic risks abate, said yesterday while growth should pick up,
persistently low inflation may hamper the recovery.  “The Fed statement stoked speculation that they may delay
curtailment in stimulus, spurring investors to buy back
futures,” said Takaki Shigemoto, an analyst at research company
JSC Corp. in Tokyo.  The  Purchasing Managers ’ Index was at 50.3, the National
Bureau of Statistics and China Federation of Logistics and
Purchasing said today in Beijing. That compared with the 49.8
median forecast of 35 analysts in a Bloomberg News survey and
June’s 50.1 level. Readings above 50 indicate expansion.  Rubber for January delivery added 0.9 percent to 18,070
 yuan  ($2,948) a ton on the Shanghai Futures Exchange. Thai
rubber free-on-board fell 0.6 percent to 76.75 baht ($2.45) a
kilogram yesterday, the lowest level since October 2009,
according to the Rubber Research Institute of  Thailand .  To contact the reporter on this story:
