Coffee shipments from Indonesia, the
third-largest producer of the robusta variety used by  Nestle SA (NESN) 
in instant drinks, jumped in July to a four-year high after
prices surged and farmers sold beans before a festival.  Exports from southern Sumatra’s provinces of Lampung,
Bengkulu and South Sumatra climbed 378 percent to 55,709 metric
tons from 11,648 tons in June, the Lampung trade and industry
office said in a statement today. That’s the highest since
57,282 tons sold in June 2009 and compares with 21,685 tons
shipped in July 2012. The provinces account for about 75 percent
of the country’s supplies that include beans and instant coffee.  Robusta futures rallied in  London  from a 32-month low in
June as farmers in  Vietnam , the top grower, held beans to boost
prices, while wetter-than-usual weather in  Indonesia  slowed
deliveries and delayed harvesting by a month to May. Prices
advanced 6.5 percent in July, the most since May 2012.  “Farmers released fresh beans from the harvest after
prices gained,” said Mochtar Luthfie, head of research and
development at Lampung chapter of the Association of Indonesian
Coffee Exporters and Industry. Growers also needed money for the
Muslim festival of Eid al-Fitr next week, he said.  Robusta futures climbed 9.9 percent to $1,873 a ton on the
NYSE Liffe from $1,704 on June 14, the lowest level since
October 2010.  Farmers boosted sales before rains hurt the bean quality
and prices start to decline, Moelyono Soesilo, purchasing and
marketing manager at PT Taman Delta Indonesia, said in a mobile-phone text message.  Shipments from Indonesia will probably plunge 19 percent to
6 million bags (360,000 tons) this year because of the higher-than-usual rainfall, according to a Bloomberg survey published
July 29. That’s the biggest drop since at least 2007, according
to data from the Central Statistics Agency.  Output may slide to 9.58 million bags from 11.04 million,
the median of eight shipper estimates showed. Exporters are
offering beans for August delivery at $100 a ton above prices on
NYSE Liffe, down from $150 to $180 in early July, the median of
estimates from four exporters showed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
