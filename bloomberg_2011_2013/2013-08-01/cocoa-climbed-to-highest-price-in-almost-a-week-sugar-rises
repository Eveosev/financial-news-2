Cocoa climbed to the highest in
almost a week in  London  as a rising premium for September
futures over December signaled concerns about supplies just as
the weather is dry in top grower West Africa. Sugar rose.  Cocoa for delivery in September was 13 pounds a metric ton
higher than the futures for December, reversing a discount just
a month ago, exchange data showed. Earlier-dated contracts
priced higher than later ones signal concerns about supply.
Dryness is increasing in leading producers Ivory Coast and  Ghana 
after some rain last month, WeatherBell Analytics LLC in New
York said in a report e-mailed yesterday.  “We are in the ‘mini-dry’ season and the absence of rains
over West Africa is not abnormal right now,” Eric Sivry, head
of agriculture options brokerage at Marex Spectron Group in
London, said in a report e-mailed today. “This ‘mini-dry’
started earlier than usual though. Any forthcoming rains should
be seen as a ’bonus’ at this point in time.”  Cocoa for September delivery rose 0.1 percent to 1,573
pounds ($2,389) a ton by 11:27 a.m. in London. The price climbed
to 1,587 pounds a ton, the highest for this contract since July
26. Cocoa for September delivery gained 0.1 percent to $2,300 a
ton on ICE Futures U.S. in  New York .  “The next four to six weeks will bring updates on pod
counts and will clarify whether or not we may encounter supply
side problems in the next four to six months,” Sivry said. The
2013-14 crop in West Africa is set to start in October.  Cocoa rose 7.7 percent in London and 2.9 percent in New
York this year as speculators raised bets on higher prices. In
London, money managers boosted bullish bets by 30 percent in the
week end July 23 from the previous 7-day period, NYSE Liffe  data 
showed. Cocoa may gain further to $2,400 a ton on ICE “if we do
not see the needed rains,” Sterling Smith, a futures specialist
at Citigroup Inc., said in a report e-mailed yesterday.  White sugar for October delivery was 0.4 percent higher at
$492.80 a ton in London. Raw sugar for delivery in October rose
0.1 percent to 16.98 cents a pound in New York.  Robusta coffee for delivery in September was 0.3 percent
lower at $1,868 a ton on NYSE Liffe. Arabica coffee for delivery
in September fell 0.1 percent to $1.1845 a pound on ICE.  To contact the reporter on this story:
