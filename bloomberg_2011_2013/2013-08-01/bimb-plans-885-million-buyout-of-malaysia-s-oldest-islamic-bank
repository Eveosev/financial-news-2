BIMB Holdings Bhd. (BIMB)  offered $885
million to buy a 49 percent stake in Bank Islam  Malaysia  Bhd.
from its partners as it seeks full control over the Southeast
Asian nation’s oldest Shariah-compliant lender.  It will pay $550 million for Dubai Financial Group LLC’s
30.5 percent stake and $334.6 million for the 18.5 percent held
by Lembaga Tabung Haji, a Malaysian pilgrimage fund, the company
said today in a Kuala Lumpur stock exchange filing. BIMB shares
rose the most in a month after the announcement.  The deals, funded through a rights issue and Islamic bond
sale, will boost BIMB’s profitability and help implement more
“coherent” group-wide strategies, Kuala Lumpur-based BIMB said
in the statement. The increased stake would give BIMB a larger
share of global Islamic financial assets, which are forecast to
double to $3 trillion by 2015, according to Standard and Poor’s.  Shares of BIMB closed 2.5 percent higher today at 4.12
ringgit in  Kuala Lumpur , the biggest gain since July 3.
Malaysia’s  benchmark  index was 0.3 percent higher.  Bank Islam, BIMB’s largest holding, was established in 1983
and offers financial services that comply with the religion’s
ban on interest. It now has a network of  130 branches  and more
than 1,000 automated teller machines around Malaysia, according
to the bank’s website.  BIMB will raise about 1.54 billion ringgit ($475 million)
from the sale of rights shares with free detachable warrants and
as much as 1.47 billion ringgit from the planned sale of 10-year
Islamic bonds, the filing shows.  BIMB will sell two rights shares and two warrants for every
five existing shares held at price of 3.60 ringgit apiece, it
said. The transactions are expected to be completed by the
fourth quarter this year, the company said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
