European stocks  rose to a nine-week
high as banks rallied on better-than-forecast profit at  Societe
Generale  SA and Lloyds Banking Group Plc while Chinese
manufacturing data boosted mining companies.  Societe Generale climbed the most in 18 months. Lloyds rose
to its highest price since October 2010 as it returned to half-yearly profit and said it will start talks with regulators to
resume dividend payments. Rio Tinto Group and BHP Billiton Ltd.
each added more than 2 percent. Sanofi slid 4.1 percent after
cutting its 2013 profit outlook. Royal Dutch Shell Plc retreated
the most since August 2011 as profit unexpectedly fell.  The Stoxx Europe 600 Index gained 1.2 percent to 303.29 at
the close of trading, its highest level since May 30. The gauge
jumped 5.1 percent in July as the  Federal Reserve  said it stays
flexible on the pace of bond buying. The Stoxx 600 trades at a
price-earnings multiple of 13.7, its highest since 2009.  “I’m still bullish on European stocks and think they are
undervalued,” Herbert Perus, who helps oversee about $36
billion as head of equities at Raiffeisen Capital Management in
Vienna, said in a phone interview. “Banks’ earnings today are
good, while Shell is a big miss. But as a whole, the earnings
season has gone well so far this quarter. The Chinese
manufacturing data is also helping the markets.”  The  European Central Bank  and the  Bank of England  today
left their benchmark  interest rates  unchanged, as forecast by
economist in Bloomberg surveys. ECB President  Mario Draghi  said
indications are that the euro-area economy is stabilizing and
the central bank’s rates will remain low for an extended period.
The Bank of England’s Governor  Mark Carney  will present the
Monetary Policy Committee’s review of steering policy
expectations next week.  Manufacturing Expands  The final reading of a  euro-area manufacturing  gauge, based
on a survey of  purchasing managers , was for 50.3, Markit
Economics said. That beat the initial reading and average
economists’ forecast of 50.1 and signals expansion for the first
time in two years.  National benchmark indexes advanced in all the 17 western
European markets open today.  Switzerland  was closed for the
National Day holiday. The U.K.’s FTSE 100 added 0.9 percent,
while  France ’s CAC 40 gained 1.3 percent.  Germany ’s DAX climbed
1.6 percent.  Banks and mining companies were the best performers among
19  industry groups  in the Stoxx 600. Societe Generale rallied 10
percent to 33.35 euros, the biggest gain since January 2012,
after posting second-quarter profit that more than doubled and
beat analysts’ estimates.  Dividend Return  Lloyds advanced 8.1 percent to 74 pence. Britain’s biggest
mortgage lender posted its first profitable six-month period in
three years.  “As a consequence of the significant progress made in
strengthening the balance sheet, we now expect to commence
discussions with our regulators in the second half of this year
on the timetable and conditions for dividend payments,” Lloyds
said in a statement.  A gauge of commodity producers advanced for the first time
in three days. China’s official manufacturing index for July
unexpectedly rose to 50.3, compared with economists’ estimates
for a drop to 49.8. Another manufacturing gauge released by HSBC
Holdings Plc and Markit Economics fell to 47.7, an 11-month low.  Rio Tinto  added 2.8 percent to 3,038 pence and BHP rose 2.2
percent to 1,920 pence. Anglo American Plc gained 5.3 percent to
1,483 pence.  Metro Beats  Metro AG climbed 8.5 percent to 28.11 euros as Germany’s
largest retailer reported second-quarter earnings before
interest, taxes and some items of 276 million euros ($366
million). Analysts on average had estimated 269.2 million euros.  Societe Bic SA jumped 6.8 percent to 89.04 euros, its
biggest increase since April 2012. The maker of Bic Cristal pens
posted first-half revenue of 937.5 million euros, exceeding the
928.8 million euros projected by analysts.  “We are confident that we will achieve our full year 2013
objectives in an environment that remains volatile,” the
stationery maker said.  Sanofi tumbled 4.1 percent to 76.85 euros. France’s biggest
drugmaker said full-year earnings per share excluding some costs
and currency fluctuations may fall as much as 10 percent. It had
previously forecast a drop of 5 percent at worst.  Shell lost 4.7 percent to 2,133 pence.  Europe ’s biggest oil
company said second-quarter profit excluding one-time items and
inventory changes fell to $4.60 billion from $5.74 billion a
year earlier. That missed the average forecast by analysts for a
profit of $6 billion.  Aggreko Plc slumped 7.7 percent, the most since December,
to 1,643 pence. The world’s largest provider of mobile power
generators said the pace of orders at its Power Projects
division, which accounts for about 40 percent of revenue,
probably won’t pick up in the “immediate future.”  Bayerische Motoren Werke AG (BMW)  dropped 0.8 percent to 73.01
euros. The world’s biggest maker of luxury cars said second-quarter earnings before interest and taxes slid 8.8 percent to
2.07 billion euros. Chief Executive Officer  Norbert Reithofer 
said he doesn’t see the European car market rebounding until the
second half of 2014.  To contact the reporter on this story:
