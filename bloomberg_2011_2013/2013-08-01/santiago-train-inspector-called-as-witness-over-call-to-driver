The ticket inspector from the Spanish
train that crashed last week near Santiago de Compostela has
been called to testify over a cell-phone call he made to the
driver just before the accident.  The official is due to appear at 10 a.m. tomorrow at a
court in Santiago, the court said in an e-mailed ruling. The
inspector, whose name was redacted from the document, has not
been accused of wrongdoing.  The train driver, Francisco Jose Garzon, took a call from
his colleague on board the train shortly before the accident to
ask him to stop at a specific platform at a station further up
the track, Judge Luis Alaez Legeren said. The call ended moments
before the accident that killed 79 people.  To contact the reporter on this story:
