Komercni Banka AS jumped the most in
19 months after second-quarter earnings at the Czech unit of
Societe Generale SA exceeded analyst estimates.  The stock climbed 5.4 percent to 4,006 koruna at the close
in  Prague , the biggest gain since January 2012 and the best
performance in the 13-member  PX (PX)  index today. Almost 107,000
shares changed hands, or 2.7 times the three-month daily
average.  Net income for April to June was 3.16 billion koruna ($161
million), Prague-based Komercni Banka said today, beating the
3.04 billion-koruna average estimate of 10 analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg. The net interest margin, the difference between the
bank’s lending and borrowing rates, stayed unchanged from the
previous quarter at 2.9 percent after falling 20 basis points in
January to March, according to the earnings statement.  “We consider the results positive, mainly the fact that
interest margins stopped declining,” Milan Lavicka, an analyst
at J&T Banka AS in Prague, wrote in a report to clients.  Profit fell from 4.12 billion koruna a year earlier as one-time gains from an asset sale weren’t repeated and low  interest
rates , Komercni Banka said today.  Today’s advance lifted the stock’s 14-day  relative strength
index  to 72, above the 70 level signaling in technical analysis
an asset may be overbought and poised for a retreat. The shares
are trading above their 200-day moving average, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
