Hong Kong  stocks  rose, with the
benchmark  index (CPMINDX)  headed for its highest close in almost two
months, after  China ’s manufacturing unexpectedly strengthened in
July.  The Hang Seng Index gained 1 percent to 22,108.34 as of
9:33 a.m. in Hong Kong, headed for its highest close since June
4. All but three stocks advanced on the 50-member gauge, which
yesterday capped its biggest monthly increase since September.
The Hang Seng China Enterprises Index of mainland companies
listed in the city rose 1 percent to 9,755.82.  The Hang Seng Index fell 3.4 percent this year through
yesterday, the worst performance among developed markets tracked
by Bloomberg, sliding as growth weakened in China and on concern
the Federal Reserve will taper stimulus in the U.S. The gauge
yesterday  traded  at 10.4 times estimated earnings, compared with
15.3 for the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index.  China’s Purchasing Managers’ Index was at 50.3 in July, the
National Bureau of Statistics and China Federation of Logistics
and Purchasing said today in Beijing. That compared with the
49.8 median forecast of 35 analysts in a Bloomberg News survey
and June’s 50.1 level. Readings above 50 indicate expansion.  Materials and energy companies  led  declines this year on
the Hang Seng Composite Index on concern demand would weaken as
China’s economy growth slowed.  Futures on the S&P 500 rose 0.5 percent today. The U.S.
equity gauge slid less than 0.1 percent yesterday, erasing
earlier gains after the Federal Reserve refrained from
indicating when it will reduce the pace of stimulus and data
showed the economy grew more than projected in the second
quarter.  Fed’s Pledge  The Fed repeated the pledge it has used since September,
that it will continue purchases until the U.S. labor market
outlook has improved substantially. Policy makers left unchanged
their commitment to hold the target interest rate near zero as
long as the jobless rate remains above 6.5 percent and the
outlook for inflation over one to two years doesn’t exceed 2.5
percent.  The Hang Seng China Enterprises Index, also known as the H-share index, fell as much as 27 percent from a Feb. 1 high,
meeting some investors’ definition of a bear market. The  measure 
traded at 1.17 times the value of net assets yesterday, 34
percent lower than its five-year average of 1.78.  Hang Seng Index (HSI)  futures climbed 1 percent to 22,081. The
HSI Volatility Index dropped 4 percent to 17.41, indicating
traders expect a swing of 5 percent for the equity benchmark in
the next 30 days.  To contact the reporter on this story:
