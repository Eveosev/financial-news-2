Bank of America Corp.  traders lost
money on seven days during the second quarter, including $54
million on one of them, ending the perfect streak of gains set
during the first three months of the year.  The bank’s traders made money on 57 trading days, or 89
percent of the time, down from every day during 2013’s first
period,  Charlotte , North Carolina-based Bank of America said
today in a regulatory  filing . The company is the second-largest
U.S. lender after JPMorgan Chase & Co.  Chief Executive Officer  Brian T. Moynihan , 53, has relied
on trading to keep profits afloat as costs from bad mortgages
piled up after the 2008 purchase of subprime lender Countrywide
Financial Corp. The global markets division, overseen by co-Chief Operating Officer Thomas K. Montag, helped the bank post a
63 percent rise in second-quarter income to $4.01 billion.  Profit in the global markets division excluding adjustments
climbed 57 percent to $935 million, the bank said last month.
Improvement in equities trading was enough to erase a 12 percent
drop in revenue from fixed income, currency and commodities
sales and trading.  To contact the reporter on this story:
