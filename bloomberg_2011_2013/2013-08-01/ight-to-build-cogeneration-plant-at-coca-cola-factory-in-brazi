Light SA (LIGT3) , the Brazilian power
utility, plans to build a 90 million-real ($39 million)
cogeneration plant at a Coca-Cola factory by December.  Light will operate the plant in Rio de Janeiro state for 15
years, Marco Donatelli, director of the companyâ€™s energy-efficiency unit Light Esco, said today at a conference in Sao
Paulo. The facility will turn natural gas into power, steam,
carbon dioxide and nitrogen for soft-drink production, he said.
It may include a boiler that will run on wood pellets.  To contact the reporter on this story:
