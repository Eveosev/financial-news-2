(Corrects word to “fell” in second paragraph.)  Smith & Nephew Plc (SN/)  second-quarter
revenue rose as growth in wound care and  emerging markets  helped
to offset a weak  Europe  and disappointing hip and knee implant
sales.  Sales climbed 4.4 percent from a year earlier to $1.07
billion, the U.K.’s biggest medical-device maker said today in a
statement. That matched the average of 12 analyst estimates
compiled by Bloomberg. Trading profit, which excludes
reorganization and acquisition costs, fell to $232 million from
$234 million.  Smith & Nephew is looking for growth through bolt-on
acquisitions and emerging markets as sales in Europe continue to
be weak. It announced it would buy an Indian trauma business and
start a share buyback program after first-quarter results missed
analysts’ estimates. The company still expects profitability
will decline this year.  “We generated stand-out contributions from our areas of
focused investment in the emerging and international markets and
negative pressure wound therapy,” Chief Executive Officer
Olivier Bohuon said in the statement. “As expected orthopedic
reconstruction had a slow quarter and we anticipate a better
second half.”  Smith & Nephew rose 0.2 percent to 784.50 pence in  London 
yesterday, giving the company a market value of 7.07 billion
pounds ($10.7 billion.)  To contact the reporter on this story:
