Jupiter Fund Management Plc (JUP)  rallied
the most in more than a year after the U.K.-based  money manager 
run by Edward Bonham Carter boosted its first-half dividend by
40 percent as earnings almost doubled.  The stock jumped as much as 8.4 percent, the biggest
intraday gain since March 30, 2012, and was up 8.1 percent at
351 pence at 11:24 a.m. in London. Jupiter raised its dividend
to 3.5 pence after first-half pretax profit surged 89 percent to
59.1 million pounds ($90 million) from a year earlier, the
London-based company said in a statement today.  “We are toward the end of paying off our debt so we can
now use that position to invest in growth of the business and
progress our dividend development,” said Bonham Carter in a
telephone interview. We have seen “considerable strength in our
balance sheet” during the period.  First-half revenue increased 19 percent to 140.3 million
pounds from a year earlier, helping the company reduce its  bank
loan  by 36 million pounds to 42 million pounds. Net cash climbed
44.3 million pounds to 113.3 million pounds.  Assets under management increased to 29 billion pounds from
23.4 billion pounds a year earlier, boosted by 426 million
pounds of inflows from Jupiter’s mutual funds. The company also
posted a gain from selling its stake in investment firm Cofunds
to Legal and General Group Plc.  “Retail fund flows in the U.K. remained resilient on the
back of the market rally early in the year,” said Bonham
Carter. “While bond funds saw net redemptions in the early
stages of the year, demand for these products, together with
absolute return funds, recovered into the second quarter,
indicating that the widely predicted ‘great rotation’ out of
bonds is not yet underway.”  JPMorgan Chase & Co. reiterated is overweight rating for
the  shares,  the equivalent of a buy recommendation, and raised
its 12-month share price estimate by 17 percent to 375 pence.  To contact the reporter on this story:
