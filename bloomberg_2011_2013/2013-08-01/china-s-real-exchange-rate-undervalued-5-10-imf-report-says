China ’s  exchange rate  is undervalued
by 5 percent to 10 percent on an inflation-adjusted basis given
the fundamentals of the country’s economy,  International
Monetary Fund  staff said in a report released yesterday.  China’s “external position appears moderately stronger and
the currency moderately undervalued compared with the level
consistent with medium-term fundamentals and desirable policy
settings,” the staff said in the report, which assessed the
real effective exchange rates of 28 countries and the euro area.
The report, dated June 20, said China’s foreign-exchange
reserves are “somewhat above” a standard IMF measure and
“further accumulation would be undesirable.”  The fund’s staff said in the report that the  yuan 
appreciated by about 5 percent from the end of 2011 through
April 2013 and “some 35 percent since the mid-2005 exchange-rate reform.” Before that, “the real effective exchange rate
had been depreciating, so it is only 14 percent above the level
reached a decade ago, which appears somewhat below the
significant increases in China’s productivity relative to
trading partners over the past 10 years.”  “On China, where rebalancing has clearly taken place, it’s
really a question of continuing the shift from domestic
investment to domestic consumption,” IMF Managing Director
 Christine Lagarde  told reporters in  Washington  yesterday. “We
have seen it already in action for the last couple of years,
but we need to see a continuation of that.”  The Washington-based fund also said that relative to
medium-term fundamentals, the depreciation of  Japan ’s currency
since 2012 implies “moderate undervaluation, with estimates
ranging from ranging from a 20 percent undervaluation to a 10
percent overvaluation.”  The yen “is expected to move in line with fundamentals
over the medium-term assuming the implementation of
comprehensive and credible fiscal and structural reforms,” the
IMF said in the report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
