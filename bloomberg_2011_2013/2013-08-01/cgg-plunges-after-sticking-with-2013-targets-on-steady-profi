CGG, the largest seismic surveyor of
oilfields, plunged to its lowest level in five months after
reporting almost steady second-quarter profit and saying it was
“reasonably confident” of meeting financial goals.  “There could have been some disappointment that the
company didn’t raise targets,” Christine Ropert, an analyst at
Gilbert Dupont in Paris who recommends buying the shares, said
by phone. Sales and earnings before interest and taxes exceeded
expectations, she wrote separately in a research report.  Net income of $36 million compared with $34 million a year-before, Paris-based CGG said today in a statement. Sales rose 24
percent to $1.03 billion and Ebit 22 percent to $117 million. It
held a 2013 target to boost sales by a quarter, Chief Executive
Officer Jean-Georges Malcor said in a presentation.  CGG slid as much as 6 percent and fell 3.7 percent to 18.30
euros by 4:34 p.m. in Paris after earlier rising 5.3 percent.  Earnings were spurred by the purchase of  Fugro NV (FUR) ’s seismic
division, which added four vessels to its fleet, for 1.2 billion
euros ($1.6 billion) last year. Oilfield surveyors expect demand
to rise for services as explorers spend more on extraction from
depleting fields and in the search for new reserves. The seismic
business uses equipment to locate oilfields under the sea bed.  “We are reasonably confident we will be within the
bracket,” Malcor said of Ebit guidance for 2013 of $580 million
to $600 million. CGG posted $279 million for the first half.  “We are in line with our plan, maybe a little ahead,” he
said. The target range depends on “strong” equipment and
multiclient business in the fourth quarter and no further
deterioration of security in locations like the  Middle East .  Second-quarter results were “well above expectations,”
 Bertrand Hodee , an analyst at  Raymond James , said in a note.  CGG had a stable 11 percent group Ebit margin. The margin
for equipment-supply unit Sercel was 28 percent, down from 32
percent, and 5 percent for the acquisition division, up from 1
percent. The end-June order backlog was $1.3 billion.  To contact the reporter on this story:
