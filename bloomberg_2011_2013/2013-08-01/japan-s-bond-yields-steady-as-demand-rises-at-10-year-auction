Yields on Japanese  government bonds 
held steady after demand rose at an auction of 10-year debt,
while a surge in domestic shares weighed on futures.  The rate on the benchmark 10-year note was at 0.795 percent
as of 5:50 p.m. in  Tokyo , according to  Japan  Bond Trading Co.
prices, set to close unchanged since July 29. Futures on the
securities slid as much as 0.2 percent before closing little
changed at 143.61.  A government auction of 2.2 trillion yen ($22.3 billion) of
10-year notes today attracted bids valued at 3.51 times the
amount available, the most in three months, according to
Ministry of Finance data. The auction’s tail, the difference
between the average and low price, was 0.02, matching the lowest
this year and indicating strong demand.  “The 10-year bond sale was solid,” said  Satoshi Yamada ,
the chief quantitative analyst at SMBC Nikko Securities Inc. in
Tokyo, one of the 23 primary dealers obliged to bid at Japan’s
debt auction. “Bonds came under selling pressure after a large
rally in stock prices.”  The Topix index of shares surged 2.8 percent, after
yesterday sliding 1.5 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
