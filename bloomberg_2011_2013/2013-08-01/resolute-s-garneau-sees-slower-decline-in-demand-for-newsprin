Resolute Forest Products Inc. (RFP) , the
world’s largest maker of newsprint, said it expects the rate of
decline in North America’s appetite for the commodity to slow,
spurred by demand for advertising inserts.  Demand for newsprint in North America fell 9.5 percent in
the first half of this year, more than the 7 percent maximum
drop the company expected, Richard Garneau, the Montreal-based
company’s chief executive officer, said today in a telephone
interview.  “We do expect a slower decline” in the second half,
buoyed by demand from newspapers for paper ahead of the
Christmas and back-to-school shopping seasons, he said. “We’re
not expecting the same decline in the second half.”  Resolute, formerly known as AbitibiBowater Inc., is one of
the paper makers hurt by falling demand for the commodity as
newspaper circulation declines and electronic communications
become more popular.  The company’s second-quarter loss widened to $43 million,
or 45 cents a share, from a year-earlier loss of $17 million, or
17 cents, the company said today in a statement. Profit
excluding one-time items such as inventory writedowns from
facility closings, was 19 cents a share, more than the 18-cent
average of four  estimates  compiled by Bloomberg.  Resolute fell 5.9 to C$14.77 at 12:31 in Toronto, after
earlier dropping as muich as 6.6 percent. The shares have gained
13 percent this year.  Garneau said Resolute is the world’s largest newsprint
producer by production capacity.  To contact the reporter on this story:
