ArcelorMittal South Africa Ltd. (ACL) 
reported an interim loss and expects earnings to be even lower
in the third quarter due to flat demand and higher costs.  Net loss in the six months through June was 140 million
rand ($14.2 million), or 35 cents a share, compared with profit
of 102 million rand, or 25 cents a share, a year earlier, the
Vanderbijlpark, Gauteng province-based unit of  ArcelorMittal (MT) 
said in a statement. Revenue fell 11 percent to 15.9 billion
rand.  Domestic sales will remain flat and an expected increase in
steel prices will be offset by higher costs, including
electricity tariffs in the South African winter and iron ore,
ArcelorMittal said.  “Overall industrial production and construction activity
remain relatively weak which will hamper steel demand,” the
group said.  Steelmaking operations at the company’s plant in
Vanderbijlpark came to a halt after a Feb. 9 blaze, with
ArcelorMittal  South Africa  declaring force majeure and using
existing stocks to mitigate the effect on customers.  Liquid steel production was 9 percent lower at 2.5 million
tons due to the fire, the company said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
