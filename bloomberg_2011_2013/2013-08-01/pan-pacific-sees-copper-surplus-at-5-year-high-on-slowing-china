World copper supply may outstrip
demand in 2014 for the second straight year to a five-year high
as mine output increases amid slowing demand from  China , the
world’s biggest user, according to Japan’s top producer.  Supply will exceed demand by 643,000 metric tons next year,
the highest since 2009, compared with 143,000 tons this year,
said Yoshihiro Nishiyama, senior executive officer in the
marketing department at Tokyo-based Pan Pacific Copper Co.  Copper has lost 12 percent this year while inventories
almost doubled as demand dropped amid slowing growth in China
and Europe’s debt crisis. An increase in supply may further
depress prices that entered a  bear market  this month, cutting
costs for manufacturers including  Sony Corp. (6758)  and Honda Motor Co.  “The slowdown in China’s consumption growth is the key
factor for the global surplus next year,” Nishiyama said in an
interview yesterday. The country’s consumption will decline 2.5
percent next year, he said.  Copper for delivery in three months on the London Metal
Exchange was at $6,955 a ton at 5:51 p.m. in  Tokyo . Stockpiles
monitored by the LME rose to 678,225 tons on June 24, the
highest since 2003, and were at 610,725 tons today.  China’s leaders pledged at a Politburo meeting this week to
maintain steady second-half growth while pressing on with
economic reforms. Gross domestic product rose 7.5 percent in
April-to-June from a year earlier, down from 7.7 percent in the
first quarter, extending the longest streak of sub-8 percent
expansion in at least two decades.  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. projects a surplus of 257,000 tons
in 2013 and 392,000 tons in 2014, according to a July 24 report.
Morgan Stanley forecast a deficit of 70,000 tons in 2013 and a
surplus of 420,000 tons in 2014, according to a July 1 report.  Mine Output  New and expanding mine output including Oyu Tolgoi in
Mongolia, Kamoto and Kov mines in the  Democratic Republic  of
Congo and Caserones, Collahuasi and Escondida in  Chile , will add
742,000 tons in 2013 and 990,000 tons in 2014, Nishiyama said.  World production of refined metal will increase 7 percent
to 21.9 million tons in 2014 from 2013, while demand will grow
4.5 percent to 21.3 million tons, Nishiyama said. The output
forecast included an estimated loss of 6 percent by supply
disruptions, including the Garfield smelter in the U.S., the
Tuticorin smelter in  India  and the Gresik smelter in  Indonesia .  Output at Indonesia’s Gresik smelter is expected to decline
by between 30,000 tons to 40,000 tons following an accident at
the Grasberg mine in May, Nishiyama said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
