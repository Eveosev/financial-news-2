South African yellow-corn futures
gained for a third day to the highest level in a week in
Johannesburg as exports of the grain increased.  Yellow corn for delivery in September, the most active
contract, rose 0.8 percent to 2,160 rand ($217) a metric ton by
the close on the South African Futures Exchange. That was the
highest price since July 24. The white variety for delivery in
December was unchanged at 2,374 rand a ton.  Yellow corn amounting to 92,055 metric tons was exported to
 Japan  in the week to July 26, the Pretoria-based South African
Grain Information Service said in a statement on its website.
That was the biggest delivery since at least April 28, 2012,
when Sagis started providing weekly historical data.  South Africa  may run out of yellow corn if exports rise
further, potentially lifting prices for white corn, an
organization representing growers and traders said July 2.
Yellow corn is used mainly as  animal feed  in the country, while
a meal made from the white variety is one of South Africaâ€™s
staple foods.  Wheat for delivery in December rose 0.6 percent to 3,328
rand a ton, the fourth consecutive advance.  To contact the reporter on this story:
