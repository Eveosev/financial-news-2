C. Kevin Landry, who joined  TA Associates  Inc. as its second hire in 1968 and as chief executive officer oversaw the Boston firm’s growth into one of the country’s largest middle-market private-equity companies, has died. He was 69.  He died of complications from  lung cancer  at his home in Boston, Phil Nunes, a company spokesman and senior vice president at BackBay Communications Inc., said yesterday. He had been diagnosed with the disease in 2010.  Landry, who became managing partner in 1982 and CEO in 1984, was an architect of TA Associates’s evolution from a startup venture-capital firm into a private-equity business with $11 billion in assets under management and investments in three continents. In the 1980s and 1990s, TA Associates and firms such as Bain Capital Partners LLC, Advent International Corp., Summit Partners LP and Thomas H. Lee Partners LP established  Boston  as a hub for private-equity investing and leveraged buyouts.  “Kevin was a uniquely talented, multidimensional figure,” a statement on the firm’s  website  said. “He was business smart, street smart, witty, gregarious, direct to the point of being blunt, and utterly honest, fair and objective, without pretense or phoniness.”  Chief executive for 23 years, Landry was named chairman in 2007 and retired in 2012. He was a senior adviser at the time of his death.  Cab Driver  Peter Brooke, a prominent Boston venture capitalist who founded TA Associates in 1968, hired Landry shortly after he received an MBA from the  University of Pennsylvania ’s Wharton School, in Philadelphia. Landry said that his only work experience before joining the company was driving a taxi while an undergraduate at  Harvard University , according to the firm’s website.  Brooke is now chairman of Advent International, which he began in 1984 when it was spun off of TA Associates’s international investment operations.  Landry’s early successes included helping to establish Biogen Inc., a pioneering biotechnology company, with Nobel laureates Walter Gilbert at Harvard and Phillip Sharp at the  Massachusetts Institute of Technology , in the early 1980s. Now called Biogen Idec Inc., it makes multiple sclerosis drugs and helped transform Boston and its suburbs into a center for biotech companies.  Christopher Kevin Landry was born on April 18, 1944, in Boston to Barbara Sullivan Landry and Christopher Lee Landry, a neurosurgeon. He attended Middlesex School in Concord,  Massachusetts , and in 1966 graduated from Harvard, where he majored in economics.  Inducted into the  Private Equity Hall of Fame  in 1997, he also served as a former director of the  National Venture Capital Association .  He is survived by his wife, Barrie; children Christopher, Kimberly and Jennifer; nine grandchildren; a brother, Brian, and sisters, Brenda Lee and Christina.
