Citigroup Inc. (C) , the third-biggest U.S. bank, hired John “Jay” Mann from Goldman Sachs Group Inc. as head of index trading within credit markets, according to two people briefed on the matter.  Mann will report to Brian Archer, head of global credit trading at New York-based Citigroup, according to one of the people, who didn’t want to be identified because the move isn’t public.  Citigroup is hiring for the credit-index trading unit after former global head Gabriel Roberts left in February for hedge fund Saba Capital Management LP. Alexis Serero, who worked at Deutsche Bank AG, will join Citigroup’s London office in September as European head of credit-index trading. The business buys and sells  credit derivatives  tied to bundles of corporate debt.  Mann joined Goldman Sachs in 2002, according to records from the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority. He declined to comment.
