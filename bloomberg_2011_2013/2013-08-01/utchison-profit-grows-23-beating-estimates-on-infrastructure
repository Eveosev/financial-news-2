Hutchison Whampoa Ltd. (13) , controlled by
Asia’s richest person  Li Ka-shing , posted first-half earnings
that beat analysts’ estimates on growth at its infrastructure
business.  Net income  rose 23 percent to HK$12.4 billion ($1.6
billion) in the six months through June from HK$10.2 billion a
year earlier, the Hong Kong-based company said yesterday. That
compares with the HK$10.8 billion median of three analysts’
estimates compiled by  Bloomberg News .  Growth at units  Cheung Kong Infrastructure Holdings Ltd. (1038) 
and  Husky Energy Inc. (HSE)  boosted earnings as Li, 85, considers
selling Hong Kong supermarket chain ParknShop. Hutchison is
expanding in faster growing industries, saying in June that it
agreed to buy  Telefonica SA (TEF) ’s Irish unit for as much as 850
million euros ($1.1 billion).  “It would be very wise of Hutchison to sell ParknShop and
diversify its business,” Louis Tse, a Hong Kong-based director
at VC Brokerage Ltd., said yesterday. “It can get into other
businesses with stronger growth like infrastructure and
energy.”  First-half revenue at Hutchison, with investments in more
than 50 countries, increased 6.5 percent to HK$123.3 billion. It
reported a “total revenue” of HK$199.1 billion that includes a
proportionate share from associated companies.  Husky Energy  Hutchison rose 0.2 percent to close at HK$87.70 in  Hong
Kong  trading before the results. The  stock  has advanced 8.4
percent this year, compared with a 2.5 percent decline for the
benchmark  Hang Seng Index .  First-half net income at Cheung Kong Infrastructure, with
businesses in Hong Kong, the U.K., Australia, Canada,  New
Zealand  and mainland China, climbed 10 percent from a year
earlier to HK$5.17 billion.  The unit this year bought New Zealand landfill operator
EnviroWaste for NZ$490 million ($389 million). Earnings in
mainland China fell 14 percent because of lower traffic on a
road it operates and the expiry of a tax concession.  “Cheung Kong Infrastructure will continue to be the star
division in Hutch’s portfolio,” Citigroup Inc. analysts led by
Anil Daswani, who have a neutral rating on Hutchison, wrote in a
July 29 report.  Husky Energy’s profit climbed 12 percent to C$1.14 billion
($1.1 billion), Hutchison said. The Calgary, Alberta-based oil
producer is about 70 percent controlled by Li, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  “Whilst uncertainty will remain a challenge for the second
half of 2013, major economies are showing signs of stabilization
and gradual recovery,” Li said in the statement. “Each of our
major operating divisions will continue to invest and expand.”  ParknShop, Marionnaud  KKR & Co. (KKR) , the private-equity firm run by  Henry Kravis  and
 George Roberts , is evaluating a bid for ParknShop, according to
two people with knowledge of the matter. Hutchison is seeking $3
billion to $4 billion and has asked potential buyers to submit
bids by Aug. 16, people with knowledge of the process have said.
ParknShop is one of the two biggest supermarket businesses in
Hong Kong.  The retail  division , its biggest, contributed 38 percent to
Hutchison’s revenue, the company said. The business, which
includes ParknShop, European cosmetics chain Marionnaud, and
Hong Kong electrical appliance retailer Fortress, had sales that
rose 6 percent to HK$62 billion in the period. Contributions
from associates and joint ventures boosted the unit’s revenue to
HK$75.8 billion.  3 Group  The division’s sales at shops open more than a year grew
2.7 percent in Asia and 2.9 percent in Europe. It has more than
11,000 stores in 33 markets as of June.  3 Group Europe’s 3G customer base increased 9 percent to
more than 25.6 million customers, Hutchison said. Earnings
before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization for the
phone unit rose 38 percent to HK$5.7 billion. Revenue from
 Hutchison Telecommunications Hong Kong Holdings Ltd. (215)  fell by 8.6
percent to HK$6.15 billion with Ebitda increasing to HK$1.5
billion from HK$1.45 billion.  Li has a net worth of $27.1 billion, making him the richest
person in Asia, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Hutchison proposed to pay an interim  dividend  of 60 Hong
Kong cents per share, compared with 55 Hong Kong cents a year
ago.  To contact the reporter on this story:
