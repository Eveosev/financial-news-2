JBS SA (JBSS3) , the world’s largest  poultry 
producer, rose the most in two months after the Brazilian
company’s U.S. unit reported  profit  that exceeded estimates.  JBS soared 5.2 percent to 6.70 reais at 11:13 a.m. in Sao
Paulo, heading to the biggest one-day gain since May 16.
Brazil’s benchmark Ibovespa advanced 1.2 percent.  JBS’s U.S. poultry unit,  Pilgrim’s Pride Corp. (PPC) , reported
late yesterday that net income almost tripled in the second
quarter to 74 cents a share, beating the 57-cent average
estimate of four analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. Pilgrim’s Pride
accounts for about 20 percent of JBS’s annual sales.  “As corn and soybean prices drop sequentially, we expect
the division to sustain margin expansion for the remainder of
the year,” Alexander Robarts, a New York-based analyst for
Citigroup Inc., wrote in a report today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
