Kim Cattrall ’s gigolo, the Bolshoi Ballet, Ron Arad’s 3-D glasses, and a European beer festival are our choices for London this weekend.  STAGE  Kim Cattrall wakes up next to a shirtless young man she can’t recognize and reaches for a pair of half-broken glasses.  “I may have done better, but God knows I’ve done worse,” she deadpans in  Tennessee Williams ’s “Sweet Bird of Youth.” Cattrall plays a faded actress who’s just botched her comeback; her gigolo-driver-fixer is a southern boy who’d rather be with his rich hometown belle.  The play has too many parallel plots. Yet Cattrall once again proves her range as an actress. Other pluses: the columned set, and the staging by Marianne Elliott, who won an Olivier for “The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time.”  “Sweet Bird of Youth” ends Aug. 31 at the Old Vic. Information:  http://www.oldvictheatre.com  or +44-844-871-7628.  DINING  It’s the U.K. versus  Europe  in the  British Craft Beer Challenge  at the Brewhouse, London Fields, on Sunday. Brews include Alhambra from Spain, Bacchus from Belgium, Nogne from Norway and Hackney Hopster from the U.K.  There’s also street food and children’s entertainment. Tickets start at 7 pounds, including beer and food. For tickets and information:  http://britishcraftbeerchallenge.co.uk/   Hot dogs and Champagne make an unlikely combination. Yet it’s proving to be a popular one at Bubbledogs, a quirky establishment on  Charlotte  Street. Chef Ferran Adria of El Bulli, no less, recommended Bubbledogs at a July meeting of culinary masters in Berlin. There are no reservations, so it’s wise to arrive before the opening times of 11:30 a.m. or 5:30 p.m. Closed on Sundays:  http://www.bubbledogs.co.uk/  or call +44-20-7637-7770.  VISUAL ARTS  When was the last time your printer spat out a pair of branded sunglasses?  The Design Museum’s new show has colorful shades by Arad that were produced by a 3-D printer. You can actually watch a few of these printers cough up small resin objects, such as Eiffel Tower models. (Be warned: They’re painfully slow.)  Otherwise, check out the 3-D-printed “Makiedolls,” whose features can be made to look like yours. There are Makiedolls of Prince Harry and of Prime Minister  David Cameron , for example.  “The Future is Here: A New Industrial Revolution” ends Oct. 29 at the Design Museum, Shad Thames, SE1 2YD. Information:  http://www.designmuseum.org  or +44-20-7940-8790.  MUSIC  Music fans who like their rock played as fast and loud as possible have plenty of ways to damage their eardrums this weekend. Iron Maiden is at the O2 Arena on Aug. 3 and 4. Pitbull is at the O2 Academy Brixon.  Those who prefer dance music will head to the old Battersea Power Station for the Holi One event, inspired by the annual Hindu festival. Revelers walk through clouds of colored water and powdery paint, and each day ends with deejay sets.  Information:  http://www.holione.com/   Can a love potion help a peasant win a rich girl’s heart?  Find out in Donizetti’s “L’Elisir d’Amore” -- staged at Opera Holland Park, the elegant outdoor summer venue. Saturday is your last chance to see it. For more information:  http://www.rbkc.gov.uk/operahollandpark  or +44-300-999-1000.  OTHER LONDON OUTINGS  Seven months after its artistic director was targeted in an acid attack, the Bolshoi is in  London  to show what it’s best at: world-class ballet. On the program (besides the usual classics): “The Flames of Paris” -- danced by an ex-Bolshoi pair who quit before the violence, Natalia Osipova and Ivan Vasiliev.  Through Aug. 17 at the Royal Opera House. Information:  http://roh.org.uk/about/bolshoi  or +44-20-7304-4000.  Elsewhere, Cuban dance superstar Carlos Acosta celebrates his 40th birthday in style with a gala performance of career highlights. He’s joined on stage by fellow Royal Ballet dancers, including the outstanding Argentine, Marianela Nunez.  “Carlos Acosta: Classical Selection” ends Aug. 4 at the Coliseum.
