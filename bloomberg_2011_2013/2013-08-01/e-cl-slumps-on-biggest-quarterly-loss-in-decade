E.CL SA (ECL) , northern Chile’s largest
power supplier, dropped the most in three weeks as increased
fuel costs at its thermoelectric plants led to the company’s
biggest quarterly loss in a decade.  Shares of the unit of France’s GDF Suez retreated 2.4
percent to 780 pesos at 12:02 p.m. in Santiago, its biggest loss
on a closing basis since July 8. The  IPSA (IPSA)  benchmark index
climbed for the first time in six days, advancing 1 percent.  The company attributed the loss to higher costs as
maintenance work at the Mejillones liquefied natural gas port
limited imports, forcing E.CL to buy diesel fuel for its plants
at higher prices.  “After the results, we expect negative pressures” to
remain,  Banco de Credito e Inversiones  said in an e-mailed
research note today. “We don’t see a short-term catalyst for
the stock,” the bank said, citing a lack of new power projects
to boost earnings.  E.CL reported a net loss of $8.51 million in the second
quarter, compared with a profit of $6.56 million a year earlier,
according to a regulatory  filing  yesterday after the close of
trading. Analysts expected a loss of $680,000, according to the
average of four estimates compiled by Bloomberg. The loss was
the biggest since the third quarter of 2002.  To contact the reporter on this story:
