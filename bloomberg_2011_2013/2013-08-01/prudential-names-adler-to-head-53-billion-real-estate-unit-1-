Prudential Financial Inc. (PRU) , the
second-largest U.S. life insurer, promoted Eric Adler to chief
executive officer of the real estate investment unit overseeing
about $53 billion in assets.  Adler, who has been chief investment officer of Prudential
Real Estate Investors, will replace Allen Smith, who was hired
to become CEO of Four Seasons Hotels and Resorts, according to a
statement today from the Newark, New Jersey-based insurer.  Prudential invests in real estate to generate fee income
and back insurance policies. The unit has hired dealmakers to
expand in Latin America and Asia. Adler joined PREI in 2010 as
head of European operations.  “Eric’s knowledge of global real estate markets brings a
fresh view that will help us strengthen our current client
relationships and build new ones as we seek to expand PREI’s
business, particularly beyond its strong, well-known U.S.
franchise,”  David Hunt , CEO of Prudential Investment
Management, said in the statement.  Adler previously worked for Tishman Speyer Properties LP
and Morgan Stanley. He graduated from the  University of Arizona 
and has a graduate business degree from HEC Business School in
France.  To contact the reporter on this story:
