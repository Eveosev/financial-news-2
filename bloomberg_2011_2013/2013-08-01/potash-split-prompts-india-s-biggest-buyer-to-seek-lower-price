India ’s biggest potash importer will
seek to renegotiate prices for the crop nutrient after suppliers
suspended a venture controlling almost half of global exports.  “We will ask for a suitable reduction in the price”
before the current contract expires, said P.S. Gahlaut, managing
director of  Indian Potash Ltd . The company had contracted to buy
1 million metric tons from a marketing venture between  Russia ’s
OAO Uralkali and Belarus at an average $400 to $410 a ton until
March 31. Half of that has already been supplied, Gahlaut said.  The $20 billion global market for potash is set to become
freely traded for the first time in eight years after Uralkali
said this week it decided to end production restrictions that
underpinned global prices. It will no longer sell potash through
Belarusian Potash Co., the Minsk-based  marketing company  it
established in 2005 with rival miner Belaruskali. The venture
controlled about 40 percent of global potash exports.  “There is oversupply of potash and it’s putting pressure
on prices,” said Gilad Alper, a senior analyst at Tel Aviv-based Excellence Nessuah Brokerage Ltd. “Uralkali reached a
conclusion that the market is not going to rebalance any time
soon and it’s better just to let prices drop so that they can
start selling volume.”  Uralkali declined to comment. The company said July 30 it
had started talks with clients worldwide to arrange new
contracts without Belarusian Potash. Global potash prices may
fall below $300 a ton after the change in trading policy, it
said. Filipp Gritskov, a Belarusian Potash spokesman, declined
to comment on any renegotiation of prices with Indian Potash.  Untenable Contracts  “If prices fall to this level the contracts will become
untenable,” Gahlaut said today by telephone. “As long as there
is no cartel it suits India. We will renegotiate with all our
suppliers to get the best price.”  Indian Potash will hold talks on new contracts with
Uralkali and renegotiate the existing agreement with Belarusian
Potash, he said.  Buyers in India, which imports all its potash needs, have
contracted to purchase 3.5 million tons in the year through
March, according to Gahlaut. New Delhi-based Indian Potash has
arranged to buy more than 60 percent of the total.  Potash is a fertilizer ingredient that strengthens plant
roots and improves their resistance to drought. It’s used in
India to increase yields of fruits, vegetables, sugar cane, tea
and coffee.  Lower Costs  “Potash consumption in the country will definitely go up
by at least 10 percent if prices decline,” said Sopan Kanchan,
president of the Confederation of Indian Horticulture, a group
of about 200,000 farmers. “It will reduce costs for farmers.
Potash is a very important element in agriculture.”  Uralkali’s break with Belarusian Potash followed the
Belarus government’s decision to cancel the group’s exclusive
right to export the nation’s potash. It also came after record
crop prices last year failed to translate into higher fertilizer
charges, Uralkali Chief Executive Officer Vladislav Baumgertner
said this week.  “We are expecting potash consumption to rise in markets
where farmers are price-sensitive, above all in India,  Southeast
Asia  and  China ,” Baumgertner said by e-mail on July 30.  The other group dominating the market is Canpotex Ltd.,
which since 1972 has exported potash for  Canada ’s  Potash Corp.
of Saskatchewan Inc. (POT)  and  Agrium Inc. (AGU) , and Plymouth, Minnesota-based  Mosaic Co. (MOS)   The end of the Russia-Belarus marketing venture “is going
to reduce the effectiveness of Canpotex,” Excellence Nessuah’s
Alper said. “They are going to have a much harder time in
controlling prices and regulating volumes.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
