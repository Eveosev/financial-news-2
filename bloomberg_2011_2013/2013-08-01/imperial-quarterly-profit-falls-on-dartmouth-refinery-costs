Imperial Oil Ltd. (IMO) , the second-largest
Canadian crude producer by market value, said quarterly profit
fell 49 percent after recording a C$264 million charge
associated with converting its Dartmouth refinery to an  oil
terminal .  Second-quarter net income declined to C$327 million ($317
million), or 38 cents a share, from C$635 million, or 75 cents,
a year earlier, the Calgary-based company said in a statement
today. Excluding one-time items, per-share profit missed the 98-cent average of eight  analysts’ estimates  compiled by Bloomberg.
Sales increased 5.9 percent to C$7.96 billion.  Imperial announced in June it will convert its 95-year-old
refinery in  Nova Scotia  into a terminal after being unable to
find a buyer for the facility, which struggled to compete
because it used higher priced Brent crude oil. The company
continues to increase output from its Kearl oil-sands project as
it completed planned maintenance at two of its oil-sands
projects during the quarter.  “It was a messy quarter financially due to downtime and
charges related to the Dartmouth refinery,” Nick Sellmer, a
Calgary-based analyst for Macquarie Capital Markets, wrote in a
note to clients today. The company’s refining results were
weaker than expected as the margin for processing oil into fuels
fell, he wrote.  Cash from operating activities fell to $738 million from
C$1.32 billion. Gross output in the quarter averaged the
equivalent of 276,000 barrels a day of oil, up from 269,000 a
year earlier.  Imperial, which is 70 percent-owned by  Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) ,
began production at the Kearl project in  Alberta  in April, after
delaying the C$12.9 billion project several times. Kearl is on
schedule to produce 110,000 barrels a day by the end of the
year, the company said. Output is expected to rise to 345,000
barrels by the end of this decade, according to the company’s
website.  Imperial dropped 0.4 percent to C$43.89 at 9:42 a.m. in
Toronto. The stock has one sell, four buy and 10 hold
recommendations from analysts, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  Suncor Energy Inc. (SU)  is the largest Canadian oil producer by
market value.  To contact the reporter on this story:
