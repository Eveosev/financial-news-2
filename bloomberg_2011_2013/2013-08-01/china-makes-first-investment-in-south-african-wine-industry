A Chinese company bought a wine
cellar and vineyards in  South Africa , the first such investment
by an operator from the Asian nation.  Perfect China bought the cellar of the Val de Vie estate,
located between the towns of Paarl and Franschhoek, near  Cape
Town , it said in an e-mailed statement yesterday. The purchase
includes a 25-hectare (61.8-acre) wine farm with 21 hectares of
vineyards, it said. The cellar will be used by Perfect Wines of
South Africa, in which Perfect China has a 51 percent stake.
PWSA exported 2.8 million bottles of wine to the Asian country
in 2011 and 2012, or about 25 percent of all South African wine
shipments to the nation, it said.  “Perfect Wines of South Africa plans to extend the current
cellar facilities at Val de Vie and increase the maturation
capacity,” according to the statement. Perfect  China  didn’t
disclose the purchase price.  Exports rose to 469 million liters (124 million U.S.
gallons) in the year through April, up 25 percent from the
previous 12 months and more than triple the total shipped in
2000, data from the Wines of South Africa trade body show. The
U.K. took the biggest share of the nation’s wine exports last
year with 22 percent. While shipments to the U.K. and U.S. fell
in the five years to 2011, they surged sixfold to 4.28 million
bottles to China.  The cellar is part of the original manor house that was
built on the farm in 1825, according to the estate’s website.
The farm grows the Cinsaut, Carignam, Grenache Noir, Mourvedre,
Syrah, Clairette Blanche, Grenache Blanc and Viognier varietals.  Ryk Neethling, a swimmer who was part of the South African
team that once held the world record for the 4x100-meter
freestyle relay, is the marketing director of Val de Vie,
according to the estate’s website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
