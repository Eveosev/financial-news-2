South African bonds gained for a
third day and the rand strengthened after the  Federal Reserve 
said it will maintain monthly bond purchases that have fueled
demand for higher-yielding assets.  The Fed said yesterday that persistently low inflation may
hamper economic expansion and pledged to keep buying $85 billion
in bonds every month even after U.S. growth beat estimates in
the second quarter.  South Africa ’s purchasing managers’  index 
rose to a five-month high in July, extending a rebound in
manufacturing.  “Overall, if you look at the historical trend, U.S. growth
is still weak,” Sean McCalgan, head of real-time research at
ETM Analytics, said by phone from Johannesburg. “That wouldn’t
justify a large change in policy from the Fed. That will be
important for the local  bond market .”  Yields on 6.75 percent bonds due March 2021 dropped seven
basis points, or 0.07 percentage point, to 7.49 percent. South
Africa’s currency gained 0.2 percent to 9.8567 per dollar at
11:41 a.m. in Johannesburg.  Foreign investors  bought  a net 384 million rand of South
African bonds yesterday, bringing net inflows for July to 8.68
billion rand ($880 million), according to JSE Ltd. data.  The seasonally adjusted South African PMI increased to 52.2
from 51.6 in June, Johannesburg-based Kagiso Tiso Holdings said
in an e-mailed statement today. The index has remained above 50,
which indicates growth in factory output, since April.  To contact the reporter on this story:
