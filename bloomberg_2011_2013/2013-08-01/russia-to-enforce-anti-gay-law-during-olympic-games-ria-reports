Russian Sports Minister Vitaly Mutko
said a law banning gay “propaganda” will be enforced during
the 2014 Winter  Olympic Games , state-run RIA Novosti reported.  While athletes with “non-traditional sexual orientation”
aren’t forbidden from attending the games in Sochi, a resort
area on the Black Sea, they will be held accountable if they
“propagate” it, Mutko told the news service.  The International Olympic Committee yesterday  said  it
“received assurances from the highest level of government in
 Russia  that the legislation will not affect those attending or
taking part in the Games.”  President  Vladimir Putin  in July signed a law enacting a
ban on “propaganda of non-traditional sexual relations” among
minors. The maximum fine for violating the law is 1 million
rubles ($30,200), applicable to legal entities. Foreign citizens
charged under the law face as long as 15 days in jail and
deportation from Russia.  The measure has sparked protests around the world, from
calls for a boycott of the Olympic Games to gay bars in the U.S.
symbolically dumping Russian vodka. A coalition of LGBT sport
and human rights organizations, including the Federation of Gay
Games, yesterday urged the IOC President  Jacques Rogge  to host
Sochi Pride House “to offer a venue for all to meet safely and
with freedom of expression.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
