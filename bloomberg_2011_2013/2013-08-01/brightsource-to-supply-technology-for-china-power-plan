solar-thermal developer whose chief executive officer stepped
down last month, has agreed to supply its technology to China
Power Investment Corp. and the China Renewable Energy
Engineering Institute to be used in a commercial-scale power

existing agreement with Huanghe Hydropower Development Co.,
Brightsource said today in a statement. Terms were not
disclosed.  Jared Blanton, a spokesman for the Oakland, California-based company, didnâ€™t immediately reply to phone and e-mail
