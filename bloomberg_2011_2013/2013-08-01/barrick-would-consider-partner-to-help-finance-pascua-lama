Barrick Gold Corp. (ABX) , the worldâ€™s
largest producer of the metal, said it would consider a
partnership with another company or a government to help finance
its Pascua-Lama project.  While Barrick has discussed the idea in the past, there are
no talks currently, Chief Executive Officer Jamie Sokalsky said
today in an interview in Toronto.  Pascua-Lama, on the border between Argentina and  Chile , is
forecast to cost as much as $8.5 billion to construct.  To contact the reporter on this story:
