Beirut â€™s water utility is inviting
contracting companies to bid for a project to build distribution
networks, pumping stations and reservoirs, MEED said, without
saying where it got the information.  The Beirut and Mount Lebanon Water Establishment is seeking
bids for the work by Sept. 24, MEED reported. The project will
be financed by the  World Bank , according to the magazine.  The work, part of the Greater Beirut Water Supply project,
will seek to improve water supply for more than 2 million people
in southern Beirut, MEED said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
