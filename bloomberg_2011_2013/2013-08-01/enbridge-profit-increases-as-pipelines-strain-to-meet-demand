Enbridge Inc. (ENB) , the largest
transporter of Canadian crude to the U.S., said second-quarter
profit increased as demand to move oil on its pipeline network
exceeded its capacity.  Net income rose to C$42 million ($40.8 million), or 5 cents
a share, from C$8 million, or 1 cent, a year earlier, the
Calgary-based company said in a statement on Marketwired today.
Excluding one-time items, per-share profit missed the 39-cent
average of 16 analysts’  estimates  compiled by Bloomberg.  Rising production from  Alberta ’s oil sands has increased
demand for infrastructure to move the crude to refiners.
Enbridge is spending C$27 billion on pipeline and terminal
projects it plans to have online by 2016, according to its
 website . The company said in May it had curtailed deliveries on
its Seaway pipeline between the U.S. Gulf Coast and Cushing,
 Oklahoma , because some third parties weren’t able to take the
product.  Earnings per share growth “should average between 10
percent and 12 percent through 2016 driven by secured projects,
many of which are under construction,” Robert Kwan and Nelson Ng, Vancouver-based analysts for  RBC Capital Markets , wrote in a
July 18 note to investors.  The company’s pipeline network is  Canada ’s biggest,
shipping more than 2.2 million barrels of crude and liquids a
day on 24,738 kilometers (15,375 miles) of pipe, according to
its website.  Enbridge fell 0.6 percent to C$45.57 yesterday in Toronto.
The shares have 16 buy, two hold and two sell ratings from
analysts, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
