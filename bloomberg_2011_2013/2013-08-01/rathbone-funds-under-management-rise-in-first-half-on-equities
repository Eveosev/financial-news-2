Rathbone Brothers Plc (RAT) , the U.K. asset
manager founded in 1742, reported an 11 percent increase in
funds under management in the first half, helped by equity
market gains.  Assets rose to 19.9 billion pounds ($30.2 billion) by June
30 from 18 billion pounds on Dec. 31, London-based Rathbone said
in a statement today. First-half pretax profit climbed 17
percent to 23.2 million pounds from a year earlier.  “Rathbones’ outlook remains positive,” said Chief
Executive Officer Andy Pomfret in the statement. “Our continued
focus on client service and controlled investment in people and
systems ensures that Rathbones is well placed to take advantage
of healthier investment markets.”  The U.K.’s FTSE 100 Index climbed 5.4 percent in the first
six months of the year as central banks maintained stimulus
measures and U.S. lawmakers agreed on a compromise budget at the
start of the year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
