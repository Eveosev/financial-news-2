PT Adaro Energy,  Indonesia ’s second-biggest power-station coal producer, said output rose to a
record 13.5 million metric tons in the second quarter.  Production climbed 12 percent in the period, from 12.05
million tons a year ago, the South Jakarta-based company said
yesterday in an e-mailed statement, citing contractor
efficiencies and lower-than-average rainfall. The previous
record was 13.3 million tons, in fourth quarter of 2012.  Separately, Adaro said  China ’s threatened ban of lower-quality coal has yet to materialize.  “We believe that China will steadily continue to import
coal from Indonesia, especially lower-calorific value products
which are mostly blended with higher calorific value coals,”
the company said.  Adaro mined 24.9 million tons of coal in the six months
ended in June, up 8.4 percent from 23 million tons in the year-earlier period.  To contact the reporter on this story:
