A Georgian ex-minister and an ally of
President Mikheil Saakashvili, along with seven other former
government officials, was acquitted today by the Tbilisi City
Court on charges of abuse of office.  Bacho Akhalaia, who was sentenced to two months in pre-trial detention in November after being accused of abuse of
office and false imprisonment, will remain in custody with other
allegations pending against him, his lawyer, Goga Oniani, said
in televised comments broadcast on Rustavi 2. Charges against
the former defense and interior minister include instigating a
prison mutiny.  Saakashvili’s  United National (UNBK)  Movement party, which was
unexpectedly defeated by billionaire Bidzina Ivanishvili’s
opposition coalition in October elections, has described
Akhalaia’s detention as politically motivated.  To contact the reporter on this story:
