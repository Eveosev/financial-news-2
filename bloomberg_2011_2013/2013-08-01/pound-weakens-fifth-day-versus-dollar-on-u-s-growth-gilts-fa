U.K. government bonds dropped for a
second day as better-than-expected manufacturing reports in
Britain and the U.S. damped demand for safer assets.  Benchmark  10-year yields  climbed toward the highest level
in three weeks after a purchasing managers’ index of U.K.
factory output rose to the highest since March 2011 and the  Bank
of England ’s Monetary Policy Committee left its target for bond
purchases unchanged at a policy meeting. The pound fell for a
fifth day against the dollar and strengthened versus the euro.  “We’ve reacted to these stronger ISM numbers,” said Robin Marshall, director of fixed income at Smith & Williamson
Investment Management LLP in  London . “By and large sentiment is
better but we were probably expecting a bit too much from the
MPC today. It’s hard to justify yields backing up much further
here after the move we had in May and June.”  The 10-year gilt yield climbed four basis points, or 0.04
percentage point, to 2.40 percent at 4:50 p.m. London time after
rising to 2.43 percent on July 25, the highest level since July
10. The 1.75 percent bond due in September 2022 fell 0.34, or
3.40 pounds per 1,000-pound ($1,516) face amount, to 94.705.  An index of U.K. manufacturing activity rose to 54.6 from a
revised 52.9 in June, according to Markit Economics and the
 Chartered Institute of Purchasing and Supply . Economists
forecast 52.8, according to a Bloomberg News survey. Readings
above 50 signal expansion.  U.S. Expansion  The  Institute for Supply Management ’s U.S. factory index
increased to the highest level since June 2011, while the Labor
Department said claims for jobless benefits unexpectedly dropped
to the lowest level in more than five years.  The yield on 10-year Treasuries jumped 11 basis points to
2.69 percent, widening the spread over similar-maturity gilts to
29 basis points. The  difference  reached 30 basis points on July
30, the most on a closing basis since August 2006.  Gilts lost 2.8 percent this year through yesterday,
according to Bloomberg World Bond Indexes. German bunds fell 1.3
percent and U.S. Treasuries declined 2.6 percent.  The Bank of England left its  base rate  at a record-low 0.5
percent and kept its bond-purchase target at 375 billion pounds
at today’s meeting, as forecast by separate Bloomberg surveys.  After the decisions were announced, the  Bank of England 
said it would respond to Chancellor of the Exchequer  George Osborne ’s “request for its assessment of the use of thresholds
and forward guidance” in its Inflation Report to be released
Aug. 7.  ‘Downside Pressure’  “We expect pound downside pressure to continue to build,”
Morgan Stanley strategists including  Hans Redeker  in London
wrote today in a note to clients. “The move towards a more
transparent BOE is expected to continue.”  The pound weakened 0.4 percent to $1.5146, its longest run
of daily declines since the period ended March 12. The U.K.
currency strengthened 0.2 percent to 87.26 pence per euro.  Sterling has fallen 2.5 percent this year, according to
Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes that track 10 developed-nation currencies. The euro appreciated 5.8 percent and the
dollar gained 5.5 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
