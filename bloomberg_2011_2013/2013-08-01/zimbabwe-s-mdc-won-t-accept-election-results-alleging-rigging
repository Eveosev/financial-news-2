Prime Minister Morgan Tsvangirai’s
Movement for Democratic Change won’t accept the results of
yesterday’s parliamentary and presidential election in  Zimbabwe 
because of “monumental rigging,” Tendai Biti, the secretary
general of the party, said.  The elections have been invalidated, Biti, who is also the
country’s finance minister, said in a telephone interview from
Harare, the capital, today.  Tsvangirai and the MDC were competing with President Robert
Mugabe, who has been in power since 1980, and his Zimbabwe
National African Union-Patriotic Front.  Mugabe, 89, has rejected allegations of rigging while the
MDC has complained that as many as two million people were
missing from the voters’ role and voter registration was
frustrated in its strongholds.  George Charamba, a spokesman for Mugabe, declined to
comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
