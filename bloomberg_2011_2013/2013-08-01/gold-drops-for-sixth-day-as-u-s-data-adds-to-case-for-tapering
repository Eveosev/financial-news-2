Gold fell a sixth day in the longest
run of losses since May, heading for the first weekly decline in
a month, as U.S. economic data backed the case for less stimulus.  Spot gold lost as much as 0.5 percent to $1,303.02 an ounce,
and traded at $1,305.26 at 7:23 a.m. in  Singapore . The Bloomberg
Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against 10 currencies,
rose the most in more than a month yesterday as claims for
jobless benefits fell to a five-year low.  Gold has retreated 2.1 percent this week, heading the
biggest drop since the five days to June 28. Data today may show
that U.S. unemployment fell in July, while employers added
185,000 jobs. The Federal Reserve said this week that it will
maintain its $85 billion monthly  asset-buying program  and that
persistently low inflation could hamper the economic expansion.  “Gold falls on U.S. dollar strength as U.S. economic data
surprised to the upside,” James Steel, an analyst at HSBC
Securities (USA) Inc., wrote in a note. “The gold market will
likely focus on the upcoming release of nonfarm payrolls data.”  Assets in the SPDR Gold Trust, the biggest bullion-backed
exchange-traded fund decreased to 921.05 metric tons yesterday,
after being unchanged for four days. Holdings have contracted 32
percent this year to the lowest level since February 2009.  Gold for December delivery lost as much as 0.7 percent to
$1,302.20 an ounce on the Comex in New York, and traded at
$1,304, falling for a fourth day. Futures are 1.4 percent lower
this week, also the first weekly loss in a month.  Silver for immediate delivery fell 0.2 percent to $19.593
an ounce, heading for a weekly decline. Spot platinum lost 0.2
percent to $1,436.80 an ounce, trimming a fourth weekly increase
that’s the best run since January. Palladium declined 0.2
percent to $731.20 an ounce, set for a weekly gain.  To contact the reporter on this story:
