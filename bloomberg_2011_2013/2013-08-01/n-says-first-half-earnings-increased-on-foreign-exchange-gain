MTN Group Ltd. (MTN) ,  Africa ’s largest
wireless operator, said first-half headline earnings per share
would be 20 percent to 25 percent higher following a foreign
currency exchange boost.  The mobile-phone service provider made a currency gain of
of about 1 billion rand ($101 million) during the six months
through June, compared with a 1.5 billion rand loss in the
previous year, the company said in a statement today.  The increase came as a result of lower net finance costs at
some of its subsidiaries, the Johannesburg-based company said.
MTN declined to comment further in an e-mailed statement. The
 shares  rose as much as 1.7 percent to 188.46 rand, the highest
in more than two weeks, and traded 0.8 percent higher as of 1:35
p.m. in Johannesburg.  “It’s likely to be a subsidiary with debt, such as
 Nigeria ,” Bpi Capital analyst Kate Turner-Smith said in a phone
interview. “Translating Nigeria’s finance costs into South
African rand at current rates could result in the foreign
exchange gain.”  The Nigerian naira has appreciated 18 percent against the
South African currency over the past 12 months, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. Nigeria accounted for about 28
percent of MTN’s 2012 revenue. The company will report first-half financial results on Aug. 14, it said.  Net finance costs were 4.16 billion rand in the year
through December, an increase of 2.58 billion rand on the
previous year, MTN said in a statement in March. At the time,
the company said the Syrian pound had declined more than 60
percent over the year and resulted in a loss of 1.51 billion
rand related to the dividend payable.  To contact the reporter on this story:
