Braskem SA, Latin America’s largest
petrochemicals maker, slumped the most in a month after the
Brazilian government was said to allow the expiration of an
import tax that has helped to protect the domestic resin market.  Shares of the Sao Paulo-based company  fell  2.6 percent to
17.13 reais at 12:21 p.m. in  Sao Paulo , the biggest drop on a
closing basis since July 5. The Ibovespa stock benchmark  added 
1.6 percent.  The tax suspension, which would also apply to raw materials
such as steel, will be announced today to help  Brazil  to fight
inflation, a government official with knowledge of the decision
told  Bloomberg News  yesterday, asking not to be named because
the plan wasn’t public yet.  “If confirmed, the measure will mean Braskem will face
more competition in the domestic market, with negative effects
on the company’s sales and prices” Felipe Rocha, an analyst at
brokerage Omar Camargo, said by phone from Sao Paulo.  Consumer inflation in Brazil rose to 6.7 percent in June,
according to the national bureau of statistics.  Braskem has gained 34 percent this year, as the Ibovespa
slumped 20 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
