South Africa ’s purchasing managers’
 index  rose to a five-month high in July, extending a rebound in
 manufacturing , Kagiso Tiso Holdings said.  The seasonally adjusted index increased to 52.2 from 51.6
in June, Johannesburg-based  Kagiso  said in an e-mailed statement
today. The index has remained above 50, which indicates growth
in factory output, since April.  “Demand for manufactured goods has been slowly improving
in recent months and is likely due to the weaker rand,” Abdul Davids, head of research at Kagiso, said in the statement. “The
operating environment remains challenging with muted demand and
relatively high input prices.”  The rand has slumped 14 percent against the dollar this
year, the most of 16 major currencies monitored by Bloomberg,
boosting the competitiveness of South  Africa ’s exports. That’s
helped temper the effect of mining strikes and a drop in export
demand from  Europe .  Finance Minister  Pravin Gordhan  expects economic growth of
2 percent to 2.2 percent this year, well below the 7 percent
annual expansion the government is targeting to cut the jobless
rate to 14 percent by 2020 from 25.6 percent currently.
Manufacturing makes up about 15 percent of Africa’s largest
economy.  The index measuring new sales orders rose to 55 last month
from 54 in June, while the business activity sub-index fell to
51.8 from 52.2, Kagiso said. The  employment  index rose 2.6
points to 47.5, even though data released by the government’s
statistics agency on July 30 showed manufacturing shed 18,000
jobs in the second quarter.  Rising Prices  “Manufacturers are reluctant to increase production
capacity in the absence of a notable, sustained improvement in
demand,” Davids said.  The price sub-index surged 5.8 points to 88 last month,
indicating rising costs from a weaker rand and higher  oil
prices , Kagiso said. The rand fell less than 1 percent to 9.8799
against the dollar as of 10:45 a.m. in Johannesburg.  The Bureau for  Economic Research , based at the University
of Stellenbosch near  Cape Town , and the Chartered Institute of
Purchasing & Supply conducts the PMI survey for Kagiso.  To contact the reporter on this story:
