Sharp Corp. (6753)  plans to raise about 100
billion yen ($1 billion) through public and private share sales
in September, according to people familiar with the matter.  Japan’s largest maker of liquid-crystal displays will seek
most of the funding through a public offering, the people said,
asking not to be identified because the information isn’t
public.  Makita Corp. (6586)  and Lixil Group Corp. may buy stakes worth
10 billion yen each, one of the people said.  Sharp is considering ways to raise capital and no decisions
have been made, the Osaka-based company said in a statement
today. The company, which is a supplier for Apple Inc., has cut
jobs and sold stakes to  Samsung Electronics Co. (005930)  and Qualcomm
Inc. to raise cash after posting 921 billion yen of losses in
the past two financial years.  The share sale announcement will probably be made later
this month, the people said. Sharp reports first-quarter
earnings today at 3 p.m. in  Tokyo .  The Japanese electronics maker is in talks with Denso Corp.
to invest as much as 2 billion yen, a person familiar with the
plans said July 23.  Nikkan Kogyo newspaper reported earlier that Sharp plans to
raise 100 billion yen by mid-September through a public offering
and individual stakes to companies including Lixil and Makita.  Sharp  shares  rose 0.7 percent at 11:28 a.m. in Tokyo
trading. The stock is up 34 percent so far this year, compared
with a 34 percent gain by  Japan ’s benchmark Topix index.  To contact the reporters on this story:
