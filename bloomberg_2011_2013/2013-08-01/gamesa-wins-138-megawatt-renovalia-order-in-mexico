Gamesa Corp. Tecnologica SA,  Spain ’s
biggest wind turbine maker, won an order for 138 megawatts of
machines for a project by Renovalia Energy SA’s Desarrollos
Eolicos Mexicanos de Oaxaca unit in  Mexico .  The 69-turbine project in the Isthmus of Tehuantepec is due
to start generating in the third quarter of 2014, Gamesa said
today in an e-mailed statement. The contract includes
installation and a five-year service contract, with an option to
extend that by another five years,  Gamesa said.  Gamesa has already installed 765 megawatts of its wind
turbines in Mexico, including 90 megawatts for Renovalia. The
Zamudio-based manufacturer also develops and sells wind farms in
Mexico, where it’s already commissioned 170-megawatts of parks.
It’s building 144 megawatts of new farms there, and has a
further 544 megawatts of projects being developed, it said.  For the latest Renovalia project, 10 of its 2-megawatt  wind
turbines  will be delivered this year, with another 59 scheduled
for delivery in 2014, Gamesa said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
