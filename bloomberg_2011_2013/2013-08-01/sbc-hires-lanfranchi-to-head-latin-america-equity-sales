HSBC Holdings Plc (HSBA) , Europe’s largest
bank, hired Ricardo Lanfranchi from  Barclays (BARC)  Plc to head local
Latin America equity sales.  Lanfranchi, who was at London-based Barclays since 2009,
will oversee from Sao Paulo HSBC’s team covering domestic Latin
American accounts, according to an e-mailed statement today. He
will report to Thomas O’Leary, head of equities for the
Americas, and Otavio Mendes, head of global markets for Brazil,
according to the statement.  “His appointment is a strategic addition to our senior
team as we methodically continue to add to our equity
capabilities across the Americas,” O’Leary said in the
statement.  HSBC hasn’t underwritten any equity deals in Brazil this
year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The bank boosted
its Latin America research team to 25 people after hiring seven
senior analysts this year, according to the statement.  Chief Executive Officer  Stuart Gulliver  is cutting $3
billion of costs by eliminating as many as 14,000 jobs over the
next three years.  To contact the reporter on this story:
