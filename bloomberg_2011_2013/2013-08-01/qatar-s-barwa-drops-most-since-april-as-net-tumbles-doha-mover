Barwa Real Estate Co.  fell  the most
in three months after Qatar’s biggest publicly traded developer
by assets reported a 87 percent slump in quarterly profit.  The shares decreased 2.9 percent, the most since April 30,
to 25.5 riyals at the close in Doha, bringing the  drop  this year
to 7.1 percent. Some 2 million shares were traded, 2.4 times the
three-month daily average. The stock was the biggest decliner in
percentage terms on the benchmark QE Index, which increased less
than 0.1 percent, taking this year’s gain to 16 percent.  Barwa said second-quarter  profit  fell to 40.6 million
riyals ($11 million), according to a company statement today.
First-half profit slumped 66 percent on delays in “sealing
certain deals,” the company said without being more specific.
The developer, which suffered from sluggish demand for
properties since the 2008 financial crisis, said June 6 it plans
to sell 26 billion riyals of assets to government owned Qatari
Diar Real Estate Investment Co. to reduce debt.  “While Barwa has completed some projects, the bulk of
their developments hasn’t been finished because they faced
liquidity problems” before June announcement, said Taher Safieddine, an analyst at  Shuaa Capital PSC. (SHUAA)  The developer will
assess remaining projects to see which ones should be completed
amid its restructuring, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
