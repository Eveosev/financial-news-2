Ford Motor Co. (F) , the second-largest
U.S. automaker, raised $1 billion in its first sale of benchmark
10-year bonds since September.  Ford Motor Credit’s 4.375 percent securities due August
2023 yield 178 basis points more than similar-maturity
Treasuries, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The notes
are expected to be rated Baa3 by Moody’s Investors Service,
according to a person with knowledge of the offering, who asked
not to be identified citing lack of authorization to speak
publicly about the matter.  The finance unit’s $1 billion of 4.25 percent debt due in
September 2022 traded yesterday at 100.69 cents on the dollar to
yield 4.16 percent, according to Trace, the bond-price reporting
system of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority.  Barclays Plc, Citigroup Inc., HSBC Holdings Plc and Morgan
Stanley managed the offering for the Dearborn, Michigan-based
company, Bloomberg data show. Proceeds will be used for general
corporate purposes.  Benchmark sales are typically at least $500 million.  To contact the reporter on this story:
