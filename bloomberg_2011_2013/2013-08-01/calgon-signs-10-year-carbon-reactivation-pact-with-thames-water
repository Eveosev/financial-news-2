Calgon Carbon Corp. (CCC)  won a 10-year
contract from Thames Water Utilities Ltd., the U.K.’s largest
provider of water and wastewater services, to reactivate carbon
used to treat drinking water.  “The value of the contract is dependent upon the amount of
carbon that is reactivated annually, which is expected to be
approximately 11 million pounds (5 million kilograms),
Pittsburgh-based Calgon said in a statement today. Calgon’s
Chemviron unit will handle the carbon at facilities in the U.K.
and Belgium until renovations costing $9.5 million are finished
at its Tipton plant near Birmingham next year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
