French car sales rose in July, the
first increase in almost two years, as new models and dealer
discounts attracted customers.  Light-vehicle registrations advanced 1.2 percent last month
from the same period a year earlier to 181,576 units, the French
carmakers’ association  CCFA  said in an e-mailed statement today.
It’s the first rise since October 2011.  Sales of new light vehicles fell 9.4 percent to 1,301,444
units over the first seven months of the year.  “The decline is ending,” said Francois Roudier, a
spokesman for Paris-based CCFA, in a telephone interview.
“People who have the means are buying new cars. But we still
forecast an 8 percent decline in the market in 2013, which would
be the worst year since 1997.”  The French economy is showing signs of stabilizing, as
 household sentiment  increased in July, national statistics
office Insee said on July 26. Youth unemployment has fallen for
two consecutive months.  PSA Peugeot Citroen (UG)  and  Renault SA (RNO) , the
country’s two largest automakers, reported increased sales in
July, according to CCFA figures.  Peugeot, which reported yesterday a 65 million-euro ($86
million) operating loss for the first six months of the year,
sold 0.9 percent more passenger cars in  France  in July from the
same period a year earlier to 46,973 units.  Renault’s sales of new passenger cars advanced 4.7 percent
last month to 34,850 units, led by a 6.1 percent rise of its
low-cost Dacia brand, according to CCFA data.  To contact the reporter on this story:
