Natural gas futures slid to the
lowest price in more than five months in  New York  after U.S.
stockpiles increased more than forecast last week.  Gas dropped 1.7 percent after the Energy Information
Administration said supplies rose 59 billion cubic feet in the
week ended July 26 to 2.845 trillion. Analyst  estimates  compiled
by Bloomberg showed a gain of 56 billion. Commodity Weather
Group LLC said the weather may be mostly cooler than average in
the eastern two-thirds of the U.S. through Aug. 15.  “The number was just a touch above expectations and we
have a few bearish factors weighing down the market,” said Kent Bayazitoglu, an analyst at Gelber & Associates in Houston.
“We’re on track for a mild August. The summer has not panned
out in terms of cooling demand.”  Natural gas for September delivery fell 5.9 cents to settle
at $3.387 per million British thermal units on the  New York
Mercantile Exchange , the lowest closing price since Feb. 22.
Volume was 6.8 percent below the 100-day average at 2:46 p.m.
The futures have gained 1.1 percent this year.  The discount of September to October futures widened 0.3
cent to 2.8 cents.  September $3.75 calls were the most active options in
electronic trading. They were 1.2 cents lower at 1.6 cents per
million Btu on volume of 1,488 at 2:50 p.m. Calls accounted for
48 percent of trading volume. Implied volatility for at-the-money options expiring in September was 31.04 percent at 2:45
p.m., compared with 32.51 percent yesterday.  Average Gains  The stockpile increase was bigger than the five-year
average gain for the week of 47 billion cubic feet, department
data show. A  deficit  to the five-year average narrowed to 1.2
percent from 1.6 percent the previous week. Supplies were 11.5
percent below year-earlier inventories, compared with 12.5
percent in last week’s report.  The high in New York on Aug. 8 may be 80 degrees Fahrenheit
(27 Celsius), 4 lower than usual, according to  AccuWeather Inc. 
in  State College ,  Pennsylvania . The high in  Chicago  that day may
be 77 degrees, 6 less than average, AccuWeather data show.  Power generation accounts for 32 percent of U.S. gas
demand, according to the EIA, the Energy Department’s
statistical arm.  Proved reserves of wet natural gas rose by 31.2 trillion
cubic feet in 2011 to a record 348.8 trillion cubic feet, the
EIA said today on its website.  Proved Reserves  “Horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing in shale and
other ‘tight’ (very low permeability) formations continued to
drive record increases in proved oil and lease condensate and
natural gas reserves in 2011,” the EIA said.  Lower-48-state  natural gas output  was little changed in May
as new wells began operating in the Northeast’s Marcellus shale
formation while Wyoming production declined during scheduled
maintenance, the EIA said yesterday.  Production in the contiguous states totaled 73.37 billion
cubic feet a day, compared with a revised 73.38 billion in
April, according to the agency’s monthly  EIA-914  report.  The U.S. met 87 percent of its own energy needs in the
first four months of 2013, on pace to be the highest annual rate
since 1985, EIA data show.  To contact the reporters on this story:
