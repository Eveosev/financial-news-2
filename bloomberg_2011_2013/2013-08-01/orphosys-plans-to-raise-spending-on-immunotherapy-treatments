MorphoSys AG (MOR)  will seek to spend part
of its almost 190 million euros ($252 million) in cash on
expanding in the emerging class of immunotherapeutics, Chief
Financial Officer Jens Holstein said.  MorphoSys currently develops drugs based on antibodies, the
fastest growing class of drugs.  AbbVie Inc. (ABBV) ’s arthritis
treatment Humira, last year’s best-selling drug globally, is
antibody-based. Immunotherapeutics are treatments that help
enlist the immune system to fight diseases such as cancer.  “We’re looking at that, and not just since yesterday,”
Holstein said in a telephone interview. “This is an interesting
class, but it does carry a higher risk.”  The company is selective in its acquisitions and has yet to
find a suitable target, he said yesterday. Martinsried, Germany-based MorphoSys may buy rights to early stage drugs or
technologies, he said.  Other companies have expanded in the field. Both  Roche
Holding AG  and  GlaxoSmithKline Plc (GSK)  recently agreed to work with
Oxford, England-based Immunocore Ltd., a company that develops
protein-based drugs to treat cancer and viral diseases.  MorphoSys has already ventured outside the field of
antibodies by agreeing to work with Groningen, Netherlands-based
Lanthio Pharma BV, a company that develops protein-based
treatments.  Cash Position  The company will also use the cash to develop its own
cancer drugs MOR202 and MOR208, Holstein said. The company said
yesterday it had 166 million euros in cash at the end of the
second half. Second-quarter revenue rose to 31 million euros
from 12.7 million euros a year earlier.  MorphoSys also received 22 million euros from a partnership
with Glaxo in July, Holstein said. An alliance between MorphoSys
and  Celgene Corp. (CELG)  agreed to in June for an experimental cancer
drug will boost the company’s cash to about 300 million euros,
he said.  Shares in Morphosys gained 1.7 percent to 52.38 euros at
2:10 p.m. in  Frankfurt , giving the company a market value of
1.25 billion euros.  To contact the reporter on this story:
