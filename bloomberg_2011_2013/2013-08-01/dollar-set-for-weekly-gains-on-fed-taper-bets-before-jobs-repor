The dollar headed for weekly gains
versus all 16 of its major counterparts before a U.S. report
that analysts said will show the jobless rate declined last
month, adding to signs the economy is gaining momentum.  The Bloomberg U.S. Dollar Index was poised for its first
weekly advance in a month on speculation the data bolsters the
case for the  Federal Reserve  to start reducing bond purchases
that tend to weaken a currency.  Australia ’s dollar slid to the
weakest in almost three years versus the U.S. currency on bets
policy makers will cut  interest rates  to a record low. The pound
strengthened after a gauge of U.K. construction increased.  “We’ve seen the dollar coming back to life before the
employment report,” said  John Hardy , head of foreign-exchange
strategy at Saxo Bank A/S in  London . “We need to see decent
numbers because we are now dependent on incoming data. It’s
important for the  unemployment rate  to drop back to the cycle
low from April. It’s time for the dollar to prove itself.”  The dollar was little changed at $1.3204 per euro at 7:10
a.m.  New York  time, having appreciated 0.6 percent against the
common currency this week. The greenback rose 0.2 percent to
99.78 yen, extending its gain since July 26 to 1.6 percent. The
Japanese currency slid 0.2 percent to 131.78 per euro.  U.S. employers added 185,000 jobs in July, following a
195,000 gain in June, according to the median forecast of
economists in a  Bloomberg News  survey before the Labor
Department’s figures today. The jobless rate is projected to
have declined to 7.5 percent from 7.6 percent.  U.S. Data  Data yesterday showed manufacturing expanded faster than
analysts estimated and  initial  jobless-benefit claims fell to a
five-year low.  “The risk for the U.S. jobs number is to the upside,”
said  Derek Halpenny , European head of global-markets research at
Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ Ltd. in London. “The barrier is a
little bit higher for the dollar to gain. It might take a
payroll reading north of 250,000 to see the dollar appreciate
notably. We are certainly now more confident in our view that
the US economy is strengthening.”  The dollar rose 5.8 percent this year, according to
Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes, which track 10
developed-market currencies. The yen has fallen 9.5 percent, the
worst performance after the Aussie’s 11 percent drop, and the
euro gained 5.9 percent.  Fed Purchases  The  Federal Open Market Committee  kept its monthly
purchases of Treasuries and mortgage securities unchanged at $85
billion this week, while warning that persistently low inflation
could hamper the recovery. It repeated a pledge to continue
stimulus until the U.S. labor market outlook has improved
substantially.  Half of the 54 economists surveyed by Bloomberg last month
said the Fed may curb its monthly purchases to a total of $65
billion at its Sept. 17-18 meeting.  The Bloomberg U.S. Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback
against 10 major currencies, was little changed at 1,035.34,
bound for a 1.2 percent advance this week.  The Australian dollar dropped for a fifth day before
central bank officials gather for a monetary policy decision
next week, when they are expected to lower borrowing costs.  The  Reserve Bank  will cut its overnight cash rate target by
a quarter percentage point to 2.5 percent, according to all but
one of 27 economists surveyed by Bloomberg News. Traders agree,
seeing a 94 percent chance of a reduction, according to
 interest-rate swaps  data compiled by Bloomberg.  The Aussie fell 0.3 percent to 89.03 U.S. cents after
sliding to 88.79, a level unseen since August 2010. It is headed
for a 3.8 percent decline this week, the steepest drop since
September 2011.  The pound rose versus all 16 of its major peers after
Markit and the  Chartered Institute of Purchasing and Supply  said
an index of construction output reached 57 last month compared
with 51 in June. Economists forecast 51.5. A reading above 50
indicates expansion.  Sterling gained 0.2 percent to $1.5149 and added 0.2
percent to 87.16 pence per euro.  To contact the reporters on this story:
