Spain  beat its maximum target at a
bond auction in Madrid today and its borrowing costs fell ahead
of the European Central Bank’s rate decision.  The Spanish  Treasury  sold 3.22 billion euros ($4.26
billion) of debt, exceeding its maximum target of 3 billion
euros. Its three-year benchmark bond was sold to yield 2.636
percent, down from 2.768 percent on July 18 and a five-year note
fetched 3.561 percent, down from 3.735 percent last month.  Spanish  government bonds  have fallen since May amid
speculation the U.S. Federal Reserve was preparing to unwind
liquidity measures. The ECB responded last month with a
commitment to keep  interest rates  low for an extended period.  The ECB will announce today’s interest-rate decision at
1:45 p.m. in Frankfurt and President  Mario Draghi  will hold a
press conference 45 minutes later.  The yield on  Spain’s 10-year benchmark  bond fell 3 basis
points to 4.624 percent at 10:52 a.m. in Madrid.  Demand for Spain’s 2016 notes was 3.32 times the amount
sold, up from 2.57 in July, while the bid-to-cover ratio was
1.74 for the 2018 securities, down from 2.10.  The spread with German borrowing costs for 10 years widened
to 3.01 percentage points. The Treasury, which has covered 73
percent of its mid- and long-term gross funding needs for 2013,
said last week that it won’t hold a scheduled bond sale on Aug.
