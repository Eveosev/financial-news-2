Treasuries rallied after American
employers added fewer workers than anticipated in July, damping
speculation the  Federal Reserve  will trim bond purchases.
Benchmark U.S. stock indexes rose to record highs, extending
yesterday’s rally, while the dollar weakened.  The yield on 10-year Treasury notes fell 11 basis points to
2.60 percent at 4 p.m. in  New York . The Standard & Poor’s 500
Index rose 0.2 percent to 1,709.67, rebounding from an earlier
loss and adding to yesterday’s 1.3 percent rally. The Stoxx
 Europe  600 Index rose for a fifth straight day, its longest
streak since April. The dollar fell versus 12 of 16 major peers
and the Bloomberg  Dollar Index , a gauge against 10 currencies,
lost 0.6 percent. Coffee, silver and nickel jumped at least 0.8
percent, while losses in gasoline, oil and natural gas led the
S&P GSCI Index of commodities lower.  Labor Department data showed payrolls increased 162,000
last month, the smallest gain in four months and compared with a
median forecast of 185,000. The  unemployment rate  dropped to 7.4
percent and was forecast to fall to 7.5 percent, according to
the Bloomberg survey median. Reports yesterday showed factory
output from the U.S. to  China  and Europe expanded in July. The
Fed said July 31 it would maintain a monthly bond-buying
program, without indicating when it may start to reduce
purchases.  “The market will read today’s jobs report as part of the
mixed data that’s shaping the Fed’s policy,” said  Stephen Wood ,
the New York-based chief market strategist who helps oversee
about $237 billion at Russell Investments. “The pattern of
economic growth looks more lumpy coming into this quarter.”  The  S&P 500   advanced 1.1 percent this week, its biggest
gain in three weeks.  Market Movers  Chevron Corp. slipped 1.2 percent as net income fell for a
second straight quarter. American International Group Inc.
rallied 2.7 percent after saying it will pay its first dividend
since 2008 and authorizing a share buyback of as much as $1
billion. LinkedIn Corp. surged 11 percent after increasing its
full-year sales forecast. Dell Inc. advanced 5.6 percent as
 Michael Dell  agreed to sweeten his proposal to buy the computer
maker with a special dividend.  The S&P 500 briefly extended declines earlier after the
U.S. State Department issued a worldwide alert to citizens
warning of potential terrorist attacks, particularly in the
 Middle East  and North Africa.  The  equity benchmark  climbed above the 1,700 level
yesterday for the first time as central banks vowed to maintain
stimulus efforts and data on global manufacturing beat
forecasts. It dipped as low as 0.4 percent to 1,700.68 today
before paring gains and later turning higher. The S&P 500 is
 trading  at 15.5 times projected earnings, compared with an
average of 13.9 over the last five years, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  Above Average  About  83 percent  of stocks in the index traded above their
average prices from the past 50 days as of yesterday, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg. While that’s below a 19-month
high of 93 percent reached in May, it’s up from its 2013 bottom
of 12.8 percent in June.  Some 115  S&P 500 (SPX)  stocks had their 14-day  relative-strength
index  exceed 70 yesterday, the most since May 21, Bloomberg data
show. RSI measures the degree to which gains and losses outpace
each other and some analysts who watch charts to predict market
moves consider a reading over 70 an indication stock has risen
too far, too fast.  Three rounds of bond purchases by the Fed, coupled with
improving earnings and economic growth, have helped  propel  the
S&P 500 up more than 150 percent from its bear-market low in
2009. Speculation about the Fed’s monthly bond purchases has
whipsawed stocks since May, when Chairman Ben S. Bernanke first
indicated policy makers could begin reducing the stimulus this
year if the job market continues to improve.  Earnings Season  Nine companies in the S&P 500 are reporting results today,
including  Warren Buffett ’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc. after the
close of trading. Of companies to have reported so far this
period, 74 percent have topped  earnings estimates  and 56 percent
exceeded sales forecasts, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  The Stoxx 600 increased 0.3 percent, capping a weekly gain
of 1.8 percent. Trading volumes were 4.5 percent below the 30-day average today for the European benchmark and 7.5 percent
less than average for the S&P 500.  Allianz SE and Axa SA, Europe’s largest insurers, rose  as
earnings exceeded estimates. Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc,
Britain’s biggest publicly owned lender, slid 3.3 percent after
reporting results and naming a new chief executive officer.  Emerging Markets  Most stocks rose in developing nations as weaker currencies
and signs of an improving global economy boosted exporters,
sending the MSCI  Emerging Markets  Index up 0.2 percent.
 Thailand ’s benchmark index fell 1.2 percent to a three-week low
on concern a planned anti-government demonstration and
parliamentary debate on amnesty legislation will fuel political
tension.  The  S&P GSCI (SPGSCI)  gauge of 24 commodities slipped 0.6 percent,
leaving its weekly gain at 0.9 percent after falling 2.1 percent
last week. West Texas Intermediate oil fell 0.9 percent to
$106.94 a barrel, trimming this week’s advance to 2.1 percent.  “The bulls have regained control,” Matthew Sherwood, head
of investment markets research in Sydney at Perpetual
Investments, which manages about $25 billion, said in an e-mail.
“Fears eased about the global economy and reassuring comments
from central banks confirmed that the money glut will
continue.”  European Yields  Germany ’s 10-year bund yield declined two basis points to
1.65 percent.  The yield on similar-maturity U.K. gilts increased two
basis points to 2.43 percent and the pound climbed 1.1 percent
to $1.5283 after a construction index based on a survey of
 purchasing managers  exceeded analyst estimates.  The additional yield investors demand to hold Italian 10-year bonds over equivalent maturity bunds decreased for a second
day, narrowing nine basis points to 260 basis points, the least
since June.  The dollar headed for weekly gains against 14 of its 16
major peers. The U.S. currency was down 0.6 percent at $1.3285
per euro today and little changed for the week. The dollar
touched 99.95 yen, the strongest since July 25, before turning
lower and trading down 0.7 percent at 98.86. The Aussie dollar
was down 0.3 percent at 88.96 U.S. cents, a level unseen since
August 2010.  To contact the reporters on this story:
