The cost of insuring corporate and
sovereign bonds from non-payment in the Asia-Pacific region
outside  Japan  fell, according to credit-default swap traders.  The Markit iTraxx Australia index declined 2 basis points
to 121 basis points as of 10:21 a.m. in Sydney, according to
National Australia Bank Ltd. The index is on course for its
lowest close since July 29, according to data provider CMA.  The Markit iTraxx Asia index of 40 investment-grade
borrowers outside Japan decreased 1 basis point to 145 as of
8:19 a.m. in  Hong Kong , Westpac Banking Corp. prices show. The
gauge, which has ranged from 99.5 to 177.8 this year, is set for
its lowest close since July 30, according to CMA, which is owned
by McGraw-Hill Cos. and compiles prices quoted by dealers in the
privately negotiated market.  The Markit iTraxx Japan index was little changed at 100
basis points as of 9:31 a.m. in  Tokyo , Citigroup Inc. prices
show. The index fell 9.6 basis points last month, the most since
April, according to CMA.  Credit-default swap indexes are benchmarks for insuring
bonds against default and traders use them to speculate on
 credit quality . A drop signals improving perceptions of
creditworthiness, while an increase suggests the opposite.  The swap contracts pay the buyer face value in exchange for
the underlying securities if a borrower fails to meet its debt
agreements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
