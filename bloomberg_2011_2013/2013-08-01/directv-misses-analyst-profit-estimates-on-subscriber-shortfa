DirecTV (DTV) , the largest U.S. satellite-television provider, fell after reporting profit and sales that
missed estimates as it added fewer Latin American subscribers
than projected.  DirecTV declined 2 percent to $62 at the close in New York.
The stock has gained 24 percent this year.  The Latin American business, seen as the company’s biggest
source of growth, attracted 165,000 new subscribers, short of
the 426,500 estimated by analysts. DirecTV lost 84,000
subscribers in the U.S., compared with a prediction that it
would drop 74,000.  “In the near term, it’s clearly a disappointment to the
market,” said Jaison Blair, an analyst at Telsey Advisory Group
in New York. “It is very clearly a tougher quarter for
subscriber trends.”  Net income fell to $660 million, or $1.18 a share, from
$711 million, or $1.09, a year earlier, the El Segundo,
California-based company said today in a  statement . Analysts had
 estimated  $1.34 a share on average, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg. Sales rose to $7.7 billion, compared with a
prediction of $7.74 billion.  The increase in earnings per share was a result of less
stock outstanding. The company has repurchased $2 billion of
stock this year as of June 30, according to the statement.  Chief Executive Officer Mike White said on a conference
call that he would “never say never” to a merger with  Dish
Network Corp. (DISH) , the second-largest U.S. satellite TV company.  Regulatory Climate  “I certainly believe that the industry landscape is
dramatically different than it was 10 years ago, on any number
of dimensions,” White said, citing escalating programming
costs. Regulators blocked plans for a merger of the companies in
2002.  DirecTV said economic and operational challenges in  Latin
America , especially  Brazil , affected results.  An internal investigation of DirecTV’s Latin American
division found on June 27 that the company had overstated
subscribers in Brazil by 200,000. DirecTV said it would record a
$25 million pretax charge for capitalized installation costs and
subscriber-related equipment held by terminated customers.  To contact the reporter on this story:
