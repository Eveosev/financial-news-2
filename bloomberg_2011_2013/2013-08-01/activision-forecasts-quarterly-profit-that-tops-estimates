Activision Blizzard Inc. (ATVI) , the largest
U.S. video-game publisher, forecast third-quarter profit that
topped analysts’ estimates a week after it announced a deal to
buy most of  Vivendi SA (VIV) ’s stake in the company.  Earnings excluding some items may be 3 cents a share on
revenue of $585 million, for the three months ending Sept. 30,
the  Santa Monica , California-based company said in a statement
today. That exceeds the average analyst projection for profit of
2 cents a share and sales of $580.1 million excluding items,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Activision announced
its second-quarter earnings on July 25 with the stake purchase.  An investor group led by Chief Executive Officer Bobby Kotick plans to buy most of Vivendi’s stake for $8.17 billion,
leaving the French media and telecommunications company with a
12 percent holding. The maker of hit titles “Call of Duty” and
“World of Warcraft” has weathered an industry decline as
players have moved to mobile and digital games on the strength
of its shooter games and “Skylanders,” which marries a video
game with collectible figures.  “Our solid performance across our franchises and strong
digital sales, including continued significant growth this
quarter in our  ‘Call of Duty’  downloadable content business over
the previous year, validate our belief that we will enter this
new period of independence in a position to leverage the
flexibility and focus that it provides,’’ Kotick said in today’s
statement.  Annual Forecast  Net income  in the second quarter rose 75 percent to $324
million, or 28 cents a share. Sales fell to $1.05 billion from
$1.08 billion.  For the full year, the company forecast sales of $4.31
billion, up from a projection of $4.22 billion in May.
Activision sees earnings excluding items of $1.01 to $1.09 a
share for 2013, up from its earlier view of 82 cents. The
earnings forecast is on a pro forma basis excluding the impact
of the stake purchase from Vivendi.  Activision slipped 2 percent to $17.83 in extended trading
at 5:59 p.m.  New York  time. The shares gained 1.2 percent to
$18.20 at the close and have advanced 71 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
