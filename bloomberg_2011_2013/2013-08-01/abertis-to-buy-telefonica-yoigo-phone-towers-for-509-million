Abertis Infraestructuras SA (ABE)  agreed to
buy mobile-phone towers from  Telefonica SA (TEF)  and  TeliaSonera AB (TLSN) ’s
Spanish unit Yoigo as it seeks to boost its telecommunications
infrastructure business.  Abertis will buy at least 4,227 mobile-phone towers from
the Spanish and Swedish phone carriers for 385 million euros
($509 million), the Barcelona-based company said in a statement
today. The transaction will contribute about 60 million euros a
year to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and
amortization, it said.  Telefonica and Yoigo will be customers for the towers in
the coming years, and other phone carriers will be also able to
use them, Abertis said. The company expects the transaction to
close in the fourth quarter of this year.  Abertis, whose businesses range from toll roads and
airports to telecommunications, is expanding its fixed- and
mobile-telephone infrastructure business as operators start to
roll out faster fourth-generation mobile services. Last year, it
acquired 1,000 mobile phone towers from Telefonica.  Abertis  shares  fell 0.1 percent to 13.95 euros at 5:09 p.m.
in Madrid, while Telefonica gained 1.1 percent to 10.84 euros.
TeliaSonera climbed 0.9 percent to 47.61 kronor in Stockholm.  Separately, Telefonica and Yoigo signed a network sharing
agreement enabling Yoigo to sell combined fixed-mobile services
to its customers, they said in a joint statement.  Telefonica will also be able to offer its customers faster
mobile services on Yoigo’s 4G network, the companies said. Both
companies have extended their national roaming contract for
Yoigo to use Telefonica’s 2G and 3G networks until 2016.  To contact the reporter on this story:
