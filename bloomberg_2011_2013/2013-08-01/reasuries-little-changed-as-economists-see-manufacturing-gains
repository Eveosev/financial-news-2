Treasuries fell, with 30-year bond
yields rising to the highest in two years, after unemployment
claims dropped and manufacturing quickened, stoking speculation
the  Federal Reserve  has justification to reduce debt purchases.  Ten-year note yields have risen by the most in almost a
month as investors anticipated quicker economic growth even as
the Fed said yesterday the expansion has been “modest” and
pledged to keep buying $85 billion of bonds a month. The U.S.
unemployment rate dropped last month, according to the median
forecast in a Bloomberg News survey of economists before
tomorrow’s report.  “The data has been very impressive, and it’s pointing
toward growth that will likely allow the Fed to start reducing
its asset purchases,” said Ira Jersey, an interest-rate
strategist at Credit Suisse Group AG in New York, one of 21
primary dealers that are required to bid at Treasury auctions.
“There is optimism that tomorrow’s number will come in better
than expected, and people would rather be short than long at
this point.” A short position is a bet that an asset will
decrease in value while a long is a wager on gains.  Benchmark U.S. 10-year  yields  rose 13 basis points, or 0.12
percentage point, to 2.71 percent at 5 p.m.  New York  time,
Bloomberg Bond Trader data showed. The price of the 1.75 percent
note due in May 2023 declined 1 2/32, or $10.31 per $1,000 face
amount, to 91 26/32. The yield reached the highest level since
July 8.  Yield Moves  Thirty-year bond yields added 12 basis points to 3.75
percent, touching the highest since August 2011.  The  difference  between two- and 30-year yields increased to
343 basis points. A steeper yield curve reflects diminishing
demand from investors for longer-maturity bonds on speculation
that growth and inflation will accelerate at a faster pace.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index of stocks jumped 1.3
percent, climbing above 1,700 for the first time.  Treasuries fell for a third month in July, dropping 3.5
percent since the end of April, based on the  Bloomberg U.S.
Treasury Bond Index. (BUSY)  Investment-grade company debt declined 4.1
percent over the past three months even after gaining in July,
the  Bloomberg USD Corporate Bond Index (BUSC)  shows.  Fed View  “Economic activity expanded at a modest pace during the
first half of the year,” the Fed said following a two-day
meeting of the  Federal Open Market Committee  yesterday. “The
Committee recognizes that inflation persistently below its 2
percent objective could pose risks to economic performance, but
it anticipates that inflation will move back toward its
objective over the medium term.”  Applications for unemployment insurance payments declined
by 19,000 to 326,000 in the week ended July 27, the fewest since
January 2008, from a revised 345,000 the prior week, the Labor
Department reported today in  Washington . The median forecast of
50 economists surveyed by Bloomberg called for 345,000.  “The claims number gives you a sense the jobs picture is
improving,” said  Charles Comiskey , head of Treasury trading at
Bank of  Nova Scotia  in New York, one of 21 primary dealers that
trade with the Fed. “Tomorrow’s jobs number will be very
important.”  The  Institute for Supply Management ’s manufacturing index
increased to 55.4 in July from 50.9 a month earlier, the Tempe,
Arizona-based group said today. The median forecast of 84
economists surveyed by Bloomberg called for the measure to rise
to 52. Economists’ estimates ranged from 49.6 to 53.5.  Jobs Report  Payrolls increased by 185,000 in July and the jobless rate
fell to 7.5 percent from 7.6 percent, a separate poll showed
before the Labor Department report tomorrow. U.S. gross domestic
product grew faster than economists projected in the second
quarter, according to a government report yesterday.  “We have seen better data, and every good data print we
get brings the Fed a step closer toward tapering,” said Tom Tucci, managing director and head of Treasury trading in New
York at CIBC World Markets Corp. “The Fed’s statement was
meaningless. Everyone tried to make it more dovish than it was
and we had some month-end buying that bid the market up a bit.
But that quickly evaporated.”  Treasury trading  volume  yesterday at ICAP Plc, the largest
inter-dealer broker of  U.S. government debt , was $375.3 billion.
Volume averaged $277.8 billion a day in July, versus $446.2
billion a day in June.  Volatility in Treasuries as measured by the Merrill Lynch
Option Volatility Estimate MOVE Index rose to 91.40 basis
points, the highest level since July 12. The average for 2013 is
67.08.  To contact the reporters on this story:
