Each year, 1.5 million wildebeest, accompanied by vast herds of zebra, make the 3,000-mile round trip from Kenya’s Masai Mara National Park to the southern end of Tanzania’s Serengeti National Park. Known widely as the Great Migration, the animals will cross the Mara River in both directions, closely following nature’s signals. But a fear of the current, sunken boulders and predators lurking beneath the surface can stop these migrating animals in their tracks. Often, they’ll mill for hours on a bank before one is brave enough to leap into the water—eventually causing others to follow in a chaotic swirl of dust and white water, thrashing limbs and snapping crocodile jaws. How can travelers maximize their chances of witnessing on the greatest wildlife dramas on earth? I asked two of  Condé Nast Traveler ’s Africa Travel Specialists ,  Cherri Briggs  of Explore Africa, and  Mark Nolting  of the African Adevnture Company, to share some of their tips with us. Get Your Timing Right Both Briggs and Nolting suggest that travelers should stay for a minimum of three nights in order to increase their chances of witnessing a river crossing. For travelers staying in the Northern Serengeti, the specialists suggest a visit between July to early November, and for travelers staying at Masai Mara, a visit sometime between August to late October (Kenya has a slightly shorter migration season). Pick a Waterfront Location Location-wise, a waterfront property is gold, according to specialists. “It is most important is to stay very close to the river, as these camps—for example, Olakira, Sayari, Singita Mara River, Rekero, Mara Explorer—have the edge over the properties that are further away,” said Briggs. Briggs adds that the Tanzanian side also tends to be less crowded. There are currently four permanent camps up in that area now, plus a number of mobile camps. Briggs suggests the  Singita Mara River Tented Camp . “Its private position directly on the river bank enables you to see a potential crossing from the your tent balcony,” said Briggs. Briggs added that they normally try to take people to a spread of lodges (usually two) to increase the chances that they will see a crossing—sometimes even moving from Tanzania to Kenya.” Though the migration is 100 percent weather dependent, it follows general patterns: The largest crossings tend to happen upon the first arrival of the migration to the Mara River (around mid-July to early August in Tanzania) or on departure (mid-to-late October/early November in Tanzania). Wildebeest and zebra are at times are more concentrated on the Kenya or Tanzanian side, depending on weather, so a Kenya/Tanzania combo safari increases chances of seeing a crossing, both experts say. Bring Binoculars, and Patience   According to Briggs, travelers should come on safari equipped with “binoculars, a camera, sundowners, and a lot of patience.” (She speaks from experience, having once sat nine hours in a vehicle waiting for wildebeest to take the plunge). Nolting adds that the waiting game is a crap shoot: “Animals are of course, unpredictable. You can wait fruitlessly for two or three hours with 10,000 wildebeest standing at the riverbank, or they can cross just as you arrive.” But at least you have company: While two decades ago, safari vehicles were few and far between, the growing number of luxury lodges and mobile safari camps—as well as radio communication between guides—means vehicles often gather to wait for a river crossing in the safari equivalent of a sports tailgating party. Hire a Safari Guide According to both Nolting and Briggs, hiring a good guide can help your chances of witnessing a river crossing—as well as enhancing your overall safari experience by helping you score a prime location. The sheer number of vehicles and the noise they bring can add to the animals’ anxiety, not to mention your own. A good guide—which can be arranged for you by a  travel specialist —will know how to jockey for a good position and keep the atmosphere lively but as unintrusive to the wildlife as possible. Drink responsibly   Traveling with a group of friends helps pass the time. But pace yourself with the sundowners, cautions Briggs—driving away for a bathroom break can mean missing a crossing or losing your vantage point. Keep the Kids Entertained Wondering if the chaos and potential violence might be too much for children? According to Nolting, though a child’s sensitivities should be taken into account, it’s an excellent learning experience for children—especially with the right guide. “A migration safari can be a great experience with a family-oriented guide, great at keeping kids entertained and at the same time teaching them about the wildlife, the environment, and local culture.” Nolting adds that for those long stretches of waiting, parents should bring along books or other materials to keep kids occupied.
