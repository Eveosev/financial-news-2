Gasoline rose along with crude as
gains for the  U.S. economy  and Chinese manufacturing, signaling
stronger fuel demand.  Futures advanced as much as 1.7 percent and West Texas
Intermediate crude climbed to the highest level in a week. U.S.
 jobless claims  fell last week to a five-year low, the Labor
Department said. China’s Purchasing Manager’s Index increased to
50.2, above the level of expansion. The  Federal Reserve  said
yesterday it would maintain its $85 billion monthly bond buying.  “Gasoline and diesel are being dragged up by the crude
market, supported by the economic news and a better-than-expected jobs report,” said  Andy Lipow , president of Lipow Oil
Associates LLC in Houston.  Gasoline for September delivery rose 3.58 cents, or 1.2
percent, to $3.0321 a gallon at 9:50 a.m. on the  New York

100-day average.  Applications (INJCJC)  for unemployment insurance payments declined
by 19,000 to 326,000 in the week ended July 27, the fewest since
January 2008, from a revised 345,000 the prior week. The median
forecast of 50 economists surveyed by Bloomberg called for
345,000.  Gasoline’s  crack spread  versus WTI fell 85 cents to $19.97
a barrel as September WTI jumped 2.3 percent to $107.42. The
fuel’s  premium  to Brent rose 31 cents to $18.46.  Pump prices , averaged nationwide, rose 0.3 cent to $3.63 a
gallon, Heathrow, Florida-based AAA said today on its website.
