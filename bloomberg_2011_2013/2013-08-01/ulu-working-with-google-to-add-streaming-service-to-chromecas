Hulu LLC, the TV streaming company
owned by major media companies, and Time Warner Inc.’s  HBO  said
they’re working with  Google (GOOG)  Inc. to add their paid-subscription
services to the company’s new Chromecast device.  Google last month introduced Chromecast, a small $35 dongle
that plugs into a TV’s HDMI input, to allow customers watch and
control online videos without a remote control using Wi-Fi. It
works with devices using Google’s Android operating system as
well as Apple Inc.’s iPhone.  Gaining content from Hulu Plus and HBO would help to round
out Chromecast’s content lineup and put Mountain View,
California-based Google on better footing to compete with Roku
and Apple TV, two competitors that also bring Web-based content
to televisions and mobile devices. Google has said the gadget
will also work with  Pandora Media Inc. (P) ’s music-streaming service
and other content providers in the future.  “We are actively working with Google to bring Hulu Plus to
the platform,” Los Angeles-based Hulu said today in an e-mailed
statement.  Time Warner Inc.’s HBO is in talks with Google to add HBO
Go to Chromecast, according to an e-mailed statement from the
company today.  Hulu Plus, which had 4 million paid subscribers at the end
of the first quarter and charges $8 a month, is owned by  Walt
Disney Co. (DIS) ,  Rupert Murdoch ’s 21st Century Fox Inc. and  Comcast
Corp. (CMCSA) ’s NBCUniversal.  Google, owner of the world’s most popular search engine,
rose 1.9 percent to $904.22 at the close in New York. Time
Warner added 1.3 percent to $63.06.  To contact the reporter on this story:
