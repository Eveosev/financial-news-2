Vestas Wind Systems A/S (VWS)  will supply
105 megawatts of wind turbines to  Electricite de France SA (EDF) ’s
Innowind unit, its biggest ever order in South Africa.  The deal is to supply 35 of its V112 3-megawatt turbines to
Innowind’s Chaba, Waainek and Grassridge sites, Aarhus, Denmark-based Vestas said today in an e-mailed statement. The agreement
also includes a 10-year servicing contract.  Vestas is chasing orders in developing nations as demand in
traditional European markets and the U.S. slows. Chief Sales
Officer Juan Araluce said in June that he expects “significant
growth” in  emerging markets , and today’s order is at least the
third this year for the Danish manufacturer in South Africa.  “These projects mark another important step in further
developing this promising wind market,” Thomas Richterich, a
Vestas official, said in today’s statement. The three wind-power
projects are financed by  South Africa ’s Industrial Development
Corp. and  ABSA Group Ltd. (ASA) , according to Vestas.  South Africa plans to add 3,725 megawatts of renewable
energy capacity by the end of 2016 and another 3,200 megawatts
by the end of the decade to curb reliance on coal for power.  Vestas on July 3 said it won a 93-megawatt order in South
Africa from Cennergi, a joint venture between Exxaro Resources
Ltd. and Tata Power Co. It said on June 11 that it won a 94-megawatt order from a GDF Suez SA-led project in the country.  To contact the reporter on this story:
