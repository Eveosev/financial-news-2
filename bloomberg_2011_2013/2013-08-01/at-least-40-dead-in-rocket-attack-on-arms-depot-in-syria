Rockets hit a government weapons
depot in  Syria ’s central city of Homs, killing at least 40
people and sending a huge ball of fire over the area, the Syrian
Observatory for  Human Rights  said.  More than 120 people were wounded in the attack on Homs’
Wadi al-Dahab neighborhood, the U.K.-based group said in e-mailed statement today. A video posted on YouTube by Syrian
activists showed dense smoke filling the skyline after the
explosion.  “Terrorists” fired rockets on the residential Wadi al-Dahab neighborhood, wounding 16 people, state-run SANA news
agency said on its Facebook page, citing an unnamed official.  To contact the reporter on this story:
