Indonesia ’s bonds advanced, pushing
the 10-year yield to a one-week low, on speculation investors
have already priced in a forecast surge in inflation.  Consumer prices  probably increased to a four-year high of
8.04 percent last month, from 5.9 percent in June, according to
the median estimate in a Bloomberg survey before data due at 11
a.m. in Jakarta. Full-year inflation will be between 7.2 percent
and 7.8 percent,  Bank Indonesia  said in a July  statement .  “Inflation should moderate after a temporary spike,” said
Billie Fuliangsahar, Jakarta-based head of treasury at PT
Rabobank International Indonesia. “The market has priced in
inflation from the consensus, so they are more comfortable now
to adjust their positions.”  The yield on the 5.625 percent bonds due May 2023 dropped
three basis points, or 0.03 percentage point, to 7.8 percent as
of 9:37 a.m. in Jakarta, the lowest level since July 24, prices
from the Inter Dealer Market Association show. It fell 27 basis
points yesterday, paring its increase in July to 70 basis points.  The  Federal Reserve  said yesterday that persistently low
U.S. inflation could hamper economic growth and pledged to keep
buying $85 billion of bonds a month  Indonesia’s trade deficit widened to $789 million in June,
from a $590 million shortfall the previous month, according to
the median estimate of economists in another Bloomberg survey
before an official report due today.  The rupiah was little changed at 10,280 per dollar, prices
from local banks show. The currency weakened 3.4 percent in July,
its biggest drop since February 2009. The spot rate traded at a
1.8 percent premium to the one-month non-deliverable forwards,
which fell 0.2 percent in July to 10,466. A  fixing  by the
Association of Banks in  Singapore  used to settle rupiah forwards
was set at 10,299 yesterday.  One-month implied volatility, a measure of expected moves
in the  exchange rate  used to price options, rose four basis
points to 12.58 percent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
