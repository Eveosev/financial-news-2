Australia won the toss and will bat
first in the third Ashes cricket Test against England at Old
Trafford in Manchester.  England captain Alastair Cook named an unchanged team as
 Kevin Pietersen  was declared fit after missing the latter stages
of the second Test because of a calf strain.  Australia made three changes with batsman  David Warner 
returning from suspension in place of Phil Hughes, off-spinner
Nathan Lyon replacing Ashton Agar and left-arm seamer Mitchell
Starc in for injured James Pattinson.  England leads the five-match series 2-0 and will win the
Ashes for a third straight time with a victory.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
