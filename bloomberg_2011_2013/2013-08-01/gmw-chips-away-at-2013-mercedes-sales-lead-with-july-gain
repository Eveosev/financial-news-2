Bayerische Motoren Werke AG (BMW)  boosted
U.S. sales of its 3 Series cars and X5 sport-utility vehicles
last month, helping the automaker narrow the luxury-vehicle lead
of  Daimler (DAI)  AG’s Mercedes-Benz.  Deliveries of the BMW brand rose 13 percent in July to
24,043, while Mercedes reported a gain of 23 percent from a year
earlier to 23,648, according to statements yesterday.  Toyota
Motor Corp. (7203) ’s  Lexus  posted a 26 percent increase to 23,031.  The monthly results trim Mercedes’s lead this year to 1,124
vehicles as the two German automakers compete for the annual
sales crown BMW has held for two years. Daimler signaled last
month it expects to come up short again in 2013.  “I don’t think we’ll be No. 1 at the end of the year and
that’s OK,” Chief Executive Officer  Dieter Zetsche  told
reporters July 12 in Seguin, Ontario. “We won’t play any games.
I’m not sure that applies to our competition.”  As recently as May, Mercedes had a lead of more than 4,000
vehicles. Mercedes sales for the year through July gained 12
percent to 165,598, Stuttgart, Germany-based Daimler said
yesterday. BMW’s deliveries for the period rose 11 percent to
164,474. The figures don’t include Daimler’s cargo vans and
Smart cars and BMW’s Mini brand, which aren’t  luxury vehicles .  BMW’s status as annual leader for 2012 is based on reported
sales. By vehicle registrations, Mercedes topped BMW last year,
according to researcher R.L. Polk & Co.  BMW, Mercedes  Sales of Munich-based BMW’s 3 Series, its top-selling
model, surged 29 percent to 9,890, helped by the new 320i. BMW’s

$35,350. Mercedes’s CLA coupe, which is scheduled to arrive at
U.S. showrooms in September, begins at $29,900.  The two largest German luxury-auto makers, which lack a
more affordable feeder brand, are competing on incentives to
lure new buyers, said  Kevin Tynan , Bloomberg Industries auto
analyst.  “The last few months, BMW has been more aggressive than
Mercedes on incentives,” Tynan said yesterday in an interview.
“They both bottomed below $2,000 in September last year with
the new model year and that’s more than doubled since. At some
point, this just becomes a price war between those two guys.”  Lexus, Cadillac  Lexus reported an increase of 62 percent for the ES sedan
and a 15 percent gain for the RX SUV. Toyota City, Japan-based
Toyota said its luxury brand gained 12 percent to 141,446
