More than 170 years after  New Zealand 
was settled by Europeans, the nation’s two largest islands are
set to be officially named.  Until now, the two islands have been referred to simply as
North and South. The  New Zealand Geographic Board  today
recommended that in addition to those names, the islands be
given their Maori titles of Te Ika-a-Maui and Te Waipounamu.  The first means “the fish of Maui,” who in Maori legend
fished up the  North Island  from his canoe. The second means
“the waters of greenstone,” referring to the green jade found
mainly on the South Island.  The Maori names appeared in early maps and documents,
including charts prepared by Captain James Cook after his
circumnavigation of New Zealand in 1769, the Geographic Board
said. In the 1840s, when the first European settlers were
arriving, maps referred to the two islands as New Ulster and New
Munster alongside the Maori names.  The board in 2009 found that the North Island and  South
Island  titles commonly used on modern maps and in documents
weren’t formalized under any legislation. Early this year, it
began a process to make the existing names official and to
consider Maori alternatives.  The overwhelming majority of public submissions supported
giving recognition to both the English and Maori names, the
board said. Land Information Minister Maurice Williamson needs
to sign off on the recommendation before the names become
official.  To contact the reporter on this story:
