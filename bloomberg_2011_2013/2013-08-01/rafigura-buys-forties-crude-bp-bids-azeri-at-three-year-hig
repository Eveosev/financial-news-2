Trafigura Beheer BV bought  North Sea 
Forties crude at the highest differential in almost seven
months. No bids or offers were made for Russian Urals.  BP Plc (BP/) 
sought without success to buy Azeri Light blend at the biggest
premium to Dated Brent in at least three years.  OAO Surgutneftegas sold via a tender 100,000 metric tons
each of Urals for Aug. 24 to Aug. 25 loading from Primorsk and
Aug. 25 to Aug. 26 from Ust-Luga on the  Baltic Sea  to Talmay
Trading, said three people with knowledge of the matter, asking
not to be identified as the information is confidential. At
least one lot will be resold to China International United
Petroleum & Chemical Corp., known as Unipec.  North Sea  Trafigura bought Forties cargo F0806 for loading on Aug. 19
to Aug. 21 from Total SA at a premium of 90 cents a barrel to
Dated Brent, 10 cents more than its bid yesterday, a Bloomberg
survey of traders and brokers monitoring the Platts pricing
window showed. This is the highest level since Jan. 10.  Eni SpA (ENI)  was unable to sell Forties for Aug. 21 to Aug. 23
at a premium of $1.20, according to the survey.  Trafigura didn’t manage to sell Ekofisk for Aug. 20 to Aug.
22 at $1.95 a barrel more than Dated Brent, the survey showed.
The grade was last bid at a premium of 90 cents.  No bids or offers were made for Brent and Oseberg. Reported
crude trading typically occurs during the Platts window, which
ends at 4:30 p.m. London time.  Brent for September settlement traded at $109.09 a barrel
on the ICE Futures Europe exchange at the close of the window,
compared with $107.07 in the previous session. The October
contract was at $108.22, a discount of 87 cents to September.  Platts sets September Oseberg crude differential at 49.21
cents a barrel, while Ekofisk will be 40.95 cents, the oil
pricing agency said in an e-mailed note today. That’s a
reduction from August premiums, which were set at 50.56 cents
for Oseberg and 46.19 cents for Ekofisk.  Mediterranean/Urals  BP failed to buy Azeri Light for loading on Aug. 12 to Aug.
20 at $3.95 a barrel more than Dated Brent, the survey showed.
This is the highest bid in at least three years and compares
with the last offer at plus $3.25 on July 25.  Libya  closed all terminals except Zawiya amid labor
protests, Oil Minister Abdulbari Al-Arusi said yesterday at a
press briefing. The closures will reduce exports by about 1.1
million barrels a day from 1.425 million on July 30, he said.  “Depending on how long the Libyan ports are out of
operation, the Mediterranean market for sweet crude will be
considerably tighter as it comes to terms with the absence of at
least 500,000 barrels a day of overwhelmingly light and sweet
grades including staples such as Es Sider, Sarir and Amna,” JBC
Energy GmbH said in an e-mailed today. The only available grade
in the Mediterranean market is El Sharara.  A prolonged outage would also support differentials for
mostly sweet Nigerian crudes, according to the report. Closing
of ports may also encourage Libya to increase exports to  Egypt ,
and may consider building an overland pipeline in the long term,
the researcher said.  West Africa  PT Pertamina bought 1 million barrels of Nigerian Qua Iboe
crude for loading in September from Unipec, said two traders
with knowledge of the matter.  India ’s  Mangalore Refinery & Petrochemicals Ltd. (MRPL)  bought 1
million barrels of Angolan Hungo via a tender from BP, according
to two traders who participate in the market.  Gabon will maintain its Rabi Blend crude exports at three
cargoes, and Rabi Light at two cargoes for September, unchanged
from August, according to a loading program obtained by
Bloomberg News. All shipments are of 650,000 barrels each.  The West African nation will also ship one lot of 930,000
barrels of Mandji grade, another plan showed.  Indian refiners booked four supertankers and five Suezmax
to load as much as 13 million barrels of West African crude in
August to the South Asian nation, according to five shipping
reports obtained by  Bloomberg News .  Indian Oil Corp., the nation’s largest refiner, chartered
three tankers to load from Nigeria and  Angola , while Bharat
Petroleum Corp. Ltd. also booked three, the reports showed.  This is in line with a survey done by Bloomberg News on
July 24, which showed Indian refiners bought 13 cargoes totaling
12.175 million barrels, or 405,833 barrels a day from Nigeria
and Angola.  To contact the reporters on this story:
