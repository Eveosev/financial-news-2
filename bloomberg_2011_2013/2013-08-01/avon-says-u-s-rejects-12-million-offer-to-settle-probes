Avon Products Inc. (AVP) , the world’s
largest door-to-door cosmetics seller, said the U.S. rejected
the company’s offer to pay $12 million to resolve investigations
into whether executives bribed foreign officials.  The  Justice Department  and the Securities and Exchange
Commission rejected an offer made in June, including the payment
of monetary penalties, the company said today in its quarterly
filing with the SEC. Avon said it expects a counteroffer.  “There can be no assurance that a settlement with the SEC
and the DOJ will be reached or, if a settlement is reached, the
timing of any such settlement or the terms of any such
settlement,” New York-based Avon said. Recent discussions
suggest the amount will be higher than $12 million, it said.  Avon and the government have been investigating whether ex-employees in China and other countries bribed officials in
violation of U.S. law.  In regulatory filings in 2011, Avon disclosed the firing of
four executives suspected of paying bribes in  China . The company
is conducting an internal investigation along with the
government.  To contact the reporter on this story:
