Brazil ’s state development bank
expects to disburse 46 percent more in loans this year to sugar-cane mills as the nation seeks to boost ethanol production.  The lender expects to loan 6 billion reais ($2.6 billion)
this year, up from 4.1 billion reais last year, Artur Yabe Milanez, manager of the agency’s biofuel department, said today
at a conference in Sao Paulo.  Banco Nacional de Desenvolvimento Economico e Social, as
the agency is formally known, has been lowering rates on loans
for cane mills in Brazil, where demand for ethanol is growing
faster than supply, he said.  “We’ve seen very little invested in new mills the last
couple of years,” he said. “The conditions on these loans are
much better for investors.”  The bank cut rates on its Prorenova credit line for
planting sugar cane on July 29 to 5.5 percent from at least 6.3
percent. The lender expects to approve 3 billion reais of loans
for farmers this season, up from 1.5 billion last harvest, he
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
