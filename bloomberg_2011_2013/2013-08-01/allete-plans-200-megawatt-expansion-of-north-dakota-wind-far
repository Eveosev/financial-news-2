Allete Inc. (ALE) ’s Minnesota Power Co.
plans to begin construction in the fourth quarter on a $345
million expansion of its Bison wind farm in North Dakota.  The 200-megawatt project in Oliver County would be north
and west of Bison’s first three phases currently in operation
that total about 300 megawatts of capacity, Allete said today in
a statement. The project is dependent on regulatory approvals in
North Dakota and Minnesota.  Bison 4 will help Minnesota Power meet a state requirement
for utilities to provide 25 percent of their energy from
renewable resources by 2025, according to the statement. It’s
expected to enter operation by the end of 2014, Duluth,
Minnesota-based Allete said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
