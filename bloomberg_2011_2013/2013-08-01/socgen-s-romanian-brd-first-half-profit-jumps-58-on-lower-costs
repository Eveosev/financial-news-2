BRD-Groupe  Societe Generale SA (GLE) ,
Romania’s second-largest bank, said its first-half profit jumped
58 percent as loan provisions and operating costs fell.  Net income rose to 62.2 million lei ($18.7 million) from
39.4 million lei a year earlier, the Bucharest-based bank said
in a  regulatory filing  today. Net banking income declined 5% in
the first half on lower loan margins and fees.  In the first half of the year “BRD operated in an
environment marked by weak demand for loans from both individual
and corporate customers, who limited their investments,” the
bank said in the  statement .  BRD, which last year reported its first net loss since at
least 2003 on soaring loan provisions, posted a 7.8 percent drop
in bad-debt costs in the first half and an 8.9 percent decline
in operating expenses, according to the statement.  Romania ’s
banking industry posted the third year of losses in 2012 and
bad-loan growth is yet to peak, according to the central bank.  BRD’s cost-to-income ratio, a measure of profitability,
stood at 45 percent, down 1.9 percentage points from a year
earlier, according to the statement. Net assets declined 6
percent to 44.9 billion lei in the first half compared with 47.9
billion lei at the end of 2012, it said.  “After a rather poor first quarter, net earnings surprised
on the upside reaching 62.17 million lei, prompted by the
improved cost of risk,” Piraeus Bank Romania SA analysts wrote
in a research note today. “Provision expenses declined 7.8
percent, helping the bank’s bottom-line, and if costs of risk
remain on the downward trend, we might see good nine-month
results.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
