The firm that owns New York’s One
Times Square, where the ball drops each New Year’s Eve, bought a
California office-and-studio complex that houses Dick Clark
Productions and big-screen movie-theater operator  IMAX Corp. (IMX)   Jamestown , which also owns Chelsea Market in New York,
bought the 484,840-square-foot (45,043-square-meter) Lantana
campus in  Santa Monica  from Lionstone Group, Atlanta-based
Jamestown said today in a statement. The purchase price was
about $310 million, according to a person with knowledge of the
transaction.  “The innovation economy is driving demand for work spaces
that offer a vibrant mix of amenities, metropolitan ambience and
collaborative, flexible environments,” Jamestown Chief
Operating Officer Michael Phillips said in the statement.  Lantana is the company’s first purchase in Southern
California. The property’s tenants include film-sound company
Todd-AO and workout-video producer Beachbody LLC. The complex is
94 percent leased, with “exceptional in-place cash flow,”
Jamestown said. The company also owns properties in San Luis
Obispo,  California , and the San Francisco Bay area.  To contact the reporter on this story:
