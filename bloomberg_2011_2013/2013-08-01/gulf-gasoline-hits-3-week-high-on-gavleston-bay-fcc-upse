U.S. Gulf Coast gasoline strengthened
to the narrowest discount to futures in three weeks after
 Marathon Petroleum Corp. (MPC)  reported a unit upset at its Galveston
Bay refinery in  Texas .  The differential for  reformulated, 84-octane gasoline , or
RBOB, on the Gulf Coast narrowed 4.75 cents to 1.25 cents a
gallon below New York Mercantile Exchange futures at 2:40 p.m.,
the smallest gap since July 11, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. Conventional, 85-octane gasoline, or CBOB, weakened
2.5 cent to 20.25 cents a gallon below futures.  Marathon reported an upset on the No. 3 fluid catalytic
cracker at the 451,000-barrel-a-day Galveston Bay refinery
because of a boiler trip yesterday, a filing with the Texas
Commission on Environmental Quality showed. A No. 1 FCC had an
ammonia leak, according to a separate report.  The 3-2-1 crack spread on the Gulf Coast, a rough measure
of refining margins based on West Texas Intermediate oil on
Cushing,  Oklahoma , fell $2.05 to $14.16 a barrel, a second
consecutive decline, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
The same spread for Light Louisiana Sweet oil slipped $1.15 to
$9.36 a barrel.  To contact the reporter on this story:
