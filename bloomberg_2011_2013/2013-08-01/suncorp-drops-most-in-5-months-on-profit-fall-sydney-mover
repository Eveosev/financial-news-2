Suncorp Group Ltd. (SUN) , an Australian
lender and insurer, fell the most in 5 months in Sydney trading
after saying full-year profit declined as much as 34 percent,
wider than analysts’ estimates.  Suncorp shares  dropped  3.4 percent to A$12.38 at 11:38 a.m.
in Sydney, on course for the most since Feb. 26. The benchmark
S&P/ASX200  index  rose 0.4 percent.  The Brisbane-based insurer estimates a year-to-June 30
 profit  of A$480 million ($430 million) to A$500 million,
compared with A$724 million a year earlier, according to a
statement yesterday. That is lower than the A$586 million mean
 forecast  of 10 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg before the
company’s statement.  The lower profit includes a full-year A$630 million loss
from its non-core loans portfolio, it said in the statement.
Suncorp received A$940 million from  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)  for
the sale of mostly bad loans, which it sold at 60 cents for
every dollar. Suncorp said June 13, the non-core portfolio had
shrunk to A$2.8 billion as at May 2013.  The company’s board intends to declare a special dividend
of 20 cents a share, in addition to a final dividend of 30
cents, it said.  Suncorp still has “downside earnings risk” for the next
year and the “potential for further special dividends is low,”
 Credit Suisse Group AG’s (CSGN)  Sydney-based analyst, Andrew Adams,
said in a note to investors today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
