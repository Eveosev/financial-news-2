West Texas Intermediate climbed to
the highest level in a week as the  Federal Reserve  maintained
its bond-buying program, Chinese manufacturing strengthened and
 Libya  closed most of its oil terminals amid protests.  Futures climbed as much as 2.1 percent in  New York  after
rising yesterday by the most in three weeks. The Fed said
yesterday that persistently low inflation could hamper the
economic expansion and pledged to keep buying $85 billion in
bonds every month.  China ’s  Purchasing Managers ’ Index increased
to 50.3 last month, exceeding the 49.8 median forecast in a
Bloomberg survey. Libyan export capacity will plunge almost 80
percent, Oil Minister Abdulbari Al-Arusi said yesterday.  “The Fed statement is the main driver of the market for
the moment,” said Myrto Sokou, an analyst at London-based
Sucden Financial Ltd. It signaled that “quantitative easing is
here to stay for a while,” and there could be “further gains
in the oil market,” she said.  WTI for September delivery advanced as much as $2.21 to
$107.24 a barrel in electronic trading on the  New York
Mercantile Exchange , the highest since July 24, and was at
$106.78 as of 1:47 p.m. London time. The volume of all futures
traded was 49 percent higher than the 100-day average. Prices
advanced 8.8 percent in July for a second monthly increase.  Brent Premium  Brent surpassed $109 a barrel on the London-based ICE
Futures Europe exchange for the first time since July 19.
Contracts for September settlement gained as much as $1.75, or
1.6 percent, to $109.45 a barrel. The European benchmark was at
a premium of $1.95 to WTI. The spread narrowed for the first
time in six days to $2.67 yesterday.  China’s manufacturing index, reported today by the National
Bureau of Statistics and the China Federation of Logistics and
Purchasing, suggested that a slowdown in the world’s second-biggest economy may be stabilizing as the government takes steps
to support growth. The July reading above 50 indicated
manufacturing is expanding.  “China’s PMI is better than expected, and that built on
the news of the better GDP figure from the U.S.,” said Ric Spooner, a chief market analyst at CMC Markets in Sydney. “We
would need to see WTI move past its recent highs to conclude
that the current movement wasn’t an upward correction against a
bigger downward movement.”  The  Federal Open Market Committee  said after a two-day
meeting in  Washington  that it remains committed to monthly bond
purchases of $85 billion. U.S. gross domestic product rose at a
1.7 percent annualized rate in the second quarter, the Commerce
Department said yesterday. That’s more than a 1 percent gain
predicted by economists surveyed by Bloomberg.  Oil Supplies  Crude stockpiles at Cushing,  Oklahoma , the main U.S. oil
storage hub, fell by 1.9 million barrels to a 15-month low of
42.1 million in the week ended July 26, according to data from
the Energy Information Administration yesterday. Supplies are at
their lowest level since April 2012.  Total U.S. crude inventories increased by 431,000 barrels
last week, said the EIA, the Energy Department’s statistical
arm. Stockpiles were estimated to decline by a median 2.45
million, according a Bloomberg survey of 12 analysts.  The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries pumped
less crude for a second month in July amid the biggest drop in
Libyan output since the 2011 war that overthrew  Muammar Qaddafi .
The group’s production fell 245,000 barrels, or 0.8 percent, to
an average 30.662 million barrels a day from a revised 30.907
million in June, a Bloomberg survey of  oil companies , producers
and analysts shows. OPEC’s 12 members supply about 40 percent of
the world’s oil.  Libya’s port of Zawiya, capable of handling 300,000 barrels
a day, is operating, while the largest port,  Es Sider , and
others including Ras Lanuf, Marsa Brega and Hariga are shut, Oil
Minister Al-Arusi said at a news briefing in Tripoli. The
closures will reduce exports by about 1.1 million barrels from
yesterday’s level of 1.425 million, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
