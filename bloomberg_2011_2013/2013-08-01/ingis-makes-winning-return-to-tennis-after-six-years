Five-time Grand Slam singles champion
 Martina Hingis  won the first match of her comeback to the
women’s tennis tour after a six-year absence.  The 32-year-old former top-ranked player from Switzerland
and her doubles partner Daniela Hantuchova of Slovakia yesterday
beat Germany’s  Julia Goerges  and Darija Jurak of  Croatia , 6-1,
6-1 in the opening round of the Southern California Open in
Carlsbad.  “I always had it in the back of my head, probably the last
six years,” Hingis told reporters yesterday when asked why she
had come back to the tour. “It was awesome.”  Abigail Tordoff, Hingis’ agent at Octagon, said in an e-mail yesterday the Swiss player will also compete in the doubles
events of Toronto, Cincinnati and  New Haven  later this month.  Hingis said she has yet to make a decision on whether
she’ll play at the U.S. Open, which starts Aug. 26 in  New York .  The victory marks the second comeback to tennis for Hingis,
who retired in 2003 because of ankle injuries and returned in
2006.  Hingis retired for a second time in November 2007 after
testing positive for cocaine during Wimbledon. She denied using
the drug, saying at the time that someone gave her a spiked
fruit drink.  The  International Tennis Federation  took a different view,
saying in January 2008 that Hingis had committed a doping
offense and would be banned for two years.  Coached by her mother, Melanie Molitor, Hingis was the
youngest player to rise to the No. 1 spot on the WTA rankings at
16 years, 6 months. She won three consecutive Australian Open
titles from 1997-99 and triumphed at Wimbledon and the  U.S. Open 
in 1997. She also reached the French Open final in 1999.  With a game built on tactical prowess and all-court
coverage, Hingis won 43 WTA Tour singles titles and 37 doubles
tournaments, including nine majors, earning $20.1 million. She
held the season-ending No. 1 ranking in 1997, 1999 and 2000 and
spent 209 weeks at No. 1. She was inducted into the
International Tennis Hall of Fame last month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
