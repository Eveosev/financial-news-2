German stocks  advanced for a fourth
day as investors awaited a policy decision from the  European
Central Bank , and as  Metro AG (MEO)  reported earnings.  Metro rallied 6.2 percent as Germany’s biggest retailer
reported second-quarter profit that beat analysts’ estimates.
Bayerische Motoren Werke AG dropped 2.4 percent after the
world’s biggest maker of luxury vehicles reported that profit
decreased 8.8 percent in the second quarter.  The  DAX Index (DAX)  added 0.7 percent to 8,334.46 at 9:38 am in
Frankfurt. The equity benchmark climbed 4 percent last month and
has risen  8.4 percent from a low  on June 24. The broader HDAX
Index increased 0.8 percent today.  The ECB will leave its benchmark  interest rate  at a record
low of 0.5 percent today, according to economists surveyed by
Bloomberg. The central bank announces its decision at 1:45 p.m.
in Frankfurt and President  Mario Draghi  holds a press conference
45 minutes later.  The volume of shares changing hands in DAX-listed companies
was 34 percent greater than the average of the last 30 days,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
