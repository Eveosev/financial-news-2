Kyocera Corp. (6971)  said first-quarter
profit more than tripled, helped by higher sales of color
printers and solar products and the weaker yen.  Net income rose to 22.7 billion yen ($230 million) in the
three months ended June 30, from 6.57 billion yen in the same
period a year ago, the Kyoto-based company said in a statement
today. Sales rose 11 percent to 331.7 billion yen.  Sales in Kyocera’s applied ceramic products group, which
includes solar products, rose 44 percent to 61.5 billion yen,
according to the company. Profit for the group rose more than
five times to 8.04 billion yen from 1.48 billion yen.  Japan ’s solar market is booming after the country began an
incentive program for clean energy a year ago and is expected to
become the largest in the world this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
