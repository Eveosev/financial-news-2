Britain’s main political parties
announced the latest set of their donors and supporters to get
seats for life in the House of Lords.  Today’s 30 appointees include Anthony Bamford, chairman of
JC Bamford Excavators Ltd., whose company has given 2.7 million
pounds ($4.1 million) to the Conservatives, and William Haughey,
chairman of City Refrigeration Holdings UK, who has given 1.3
million pounds to the  Labour Party .  The upper chamber of Parliament was historically filled by
members of the hereditary nobility. There are still some nobles
and Church of England Bishops. Its members can introduce and
vote on legislation. Its 838 members make it one of the largest
legislative chambers in the world.  An attempt by Liberal Democrat members of the coalition
government to introduce elections to the Lords was blocked last
year by Tory lawmakers, in defiance of Prime Minister  David Cameron , who supported the plan.  Daniel Finkelstein, a journalist at the  Times newspaper ,
will sit for the Conservatives in the Lords. Doreen Laurence,
who fought a long campaign for justice after her son was killed
in a racist attack, will sit for Labour, as will Charles Allen,
senior adviser to Goldman Sachs Group Inc.  The  Green Party  nominated Jenny Jones, a former deputy
mayor of London after a ballot of all its members. John Horam,
who will sit for the Conservatives in the Lords, has represented
the Conservatives, Labour and the SDP, a fore-runner to the
Liberal Democrats, in the House of Commons.  To contact the reporter on this story:
