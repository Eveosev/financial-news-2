Taiwan (TWGDCONY)  is stocking up on rabies
vaccines after a 31 year-old man and a 9 year-old girl were
bitten by ferret badgers infected with the disease.  The government has ordered an additional 820,000 doses of
animal vaccines to boost supplies to 1.13 million by the end of
this month, according a  statement  from the island’s Bureau of
Animal and Plant Health Inspection and Quarantine. Neither the
man nor the girl were infected as a result of the bites.  The appearance of rabies last month in Taiwan, which had
been free of the disease for 50 years, has been widely covered
by the island’s television stations and newspapers. Premier
Jiang Yi-huah announced today that the island would be upgrading
its rabies task force into a command center as confirmed cases
in animals spread to six counties and cities.  Rabies was first detected in the remains of three wild
Formosan ferret badgers, the Council of Agriculture announced on
July 17. An Asian house shrew and 21 ferret badgers were
confirmed to be infected at the end of July, all of which were
found in mountain areas, according to the council. The vaccines
purchased by  Taiwan  are for domestic animals.  Taiwan hasn’t had a human rabies infection since 1959 and
hadn’t had an animal case since 1961, Liu Shih-hao, public
relations director at the island’s Centers for Disease Control,
said by telephone.  Ferret badgers are primarily nocturnal animals weighing 1-3
kilograms, according to the website of the University of
Michigan’s Museum of Zoology. They are omnivores that subsist on
insects and fruit.  The island can be declared rabies-free again following two
consecutive years without a single new case, according to the
government.  To contact the reporter on this story:
