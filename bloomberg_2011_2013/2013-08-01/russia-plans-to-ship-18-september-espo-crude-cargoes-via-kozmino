Russia  will export 18 cargoes of East
Siberia-Pacific Ocean, or ESPO, crude from the Pacific port of
Kozmino in September.  Kozmino will load 1.8 million metric tons, or about 440,000
barrels a day, of ESPO blend, according to a loading program
obtained by  Bloomberg News . Three of the shipments, which are in
lots of 100,000 tons each, will be transported by rail from
Skovorodino and the rest through a pipeline. This month it plans
to ship 17 cargoes, or about 402,000 barrels.  The ESPO link, Russia’s most expensive infrastructure
project, starts at fields in East Siberia. A second phase of the
venture was completed in December that expanded the pipeline’s
capacity and also extended it to the Pacific coast, at Kozmino,
lessening the need for rail shipments.  The September program also includes a partial rail cargo of
82,000 tons that will be topped up at Kozmino in October.  Six of the September consignments are from OAO Rosneft, six
lots from OAO Surgutneftegas, two from OAO Lukoil, one from OAO
Gazprom Neft and the remaining three are earmarked for smaller
producers.  Loading programs are monthly schedules of crude shipments
compiled by field operators to allow buyers and sellers to plan
their supply and trading activities.  To contact the reporter on this story:
