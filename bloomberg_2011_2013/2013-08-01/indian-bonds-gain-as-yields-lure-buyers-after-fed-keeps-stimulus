India ’s 10-year bonds gained the most
in a week as higher yields and the  Federal Reserve ’s pledge to
maintain stimulus buoyed demand.  The rate on benchmark debt due 2023 rose 75 basis points in
July, the biggest jump since March 2009, helping attract
investors, according to  Dhanlaxmi Bank Ltd. (DHLBK)  Global funds’
 purchases  of local notes exceeded sales on three of the four
days through July 30, exchange data show, paring last month’s
outflows to $2 billion. After a two-day meeting that concluded
yesterday, the Fed said persistently low inflation poses a risk
to the world’s largest economy and pledged to keep buying $85
billion of fixed-income securities every month.  The yield on the 7.16 percent Indian  government bonds  due
May 2023 slid 11 basis points, or 0.11 percentage point, to 8.09
percent in Mumbai, according to prices from the central bank’s
trading system. The rate has retreated 33 basis points from the
year’s high of 8.42 percent on July 24.  “The worst seems to be behind the bond markets,” said
Srinivasa Raghavan, Mumbai-based executive vice-president of
treasury at Dhanlaxmi Bank. “The fact that the Fed stayed away
from making any comments on tapering helps sentiment.”  Primary dealers underwrote 120.67 billion rupees of the
150-billion rupees worth of government bonds to be sold
tomorrow. Bond yields surged last month as the  Reserve Bank  of
India raised two  interest rates  and tightened cash supply to
arrest a slide in the rupee, which fell to a record 61.2125 per
dollar on July 8. GovernorDuvvuri Subbarao held the repurchase
rate at 7.25 percent on July 30.  The one-year interest-rate swap, a derivative contract used
to guard against fluctuations in funding costs, slumped 13 basis
points to 9.37 percent today, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
