(Corrects August price and percentage change in first
paragraph of story published July 31.)  The official selling price for Oman
crude during September will be $103.59 a barrel, based on the
average of daily futures settlement prices during July on the

percent higher than August’s  price  of $100.21.  Yesterday’s settlement at 12:30 p.m. Dubai time was $104.65
a barrel, the exchange said. Oman has set its OSP as the monthly
average of DME daily settlement prices since June 2007,
according to the exchange’s  website .  To contact the reporter on this story:
