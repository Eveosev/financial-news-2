Freezing temperatures in part of
 Brazil ’s Center South, the world’s largest sugar-producing
region, caused losses to crops, research firm Datagro Ltd. said.  Damage in parts of Parana and Mato Grosso do Sul states is
being assessed and conclusive data will be released in seven to
10 days, Datagro President Plinio Nastari said by telephone from
Leme, Brazil. Last week’s freezing temperatures affected an area
of about 65 million tons of cane, he said.  “We had losses for sure,” Nastari said. “It’s too early
to talk about numbers. My first impression is that we’ll have
more ethanol and less sugar in the market.”  Low temperatures and dry weather elsewhere in Brazil’s
Center South -- including  Sao Paulo  state, which accounts for
more than half of Brazil’s crops -- helped plants to lose water
and concentrate more sugar, Nastari said. Low temperatures in
Brazil, where it’s winter in the Southern Hemisphere, were
positive to about 280 million tons of cane, he said.  Brazil’s Center South will produce 586.1 million tons of
cane, 35.3 million tons of sugar and 25.5 billion liters of
ethanol in the crop year that started April 1, Datagro said July
5.  To contact the reporter on this story:
