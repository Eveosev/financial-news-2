Warehouse officials are removing
water-damaged bags of cocoa found among a 9,000-metric-ton batch
held in the Belgian port of Antwerp, according to a person with
direct knowledge of the matter.  The beans stored by Commodity Centre (Holdings) Ltd. are
equal to 6 percent of inventories reported by the NYSE Liffe
bourse July 22. The extent of the damage is not yet known. The
cocoa was suspended for delivery into the July contract, said
the person, who asked not to be identified because the matter is
private. Undamaged bags will be combined into the 10-ton lots
traded on NYSE Liffe, the person said.  Water stains were found on some bags of the cocoa, which
originated in  Cameroon , as they were moved to another warehouse,
two people said in May. The stains added to concern about supply
after stockpiles fell to the lowest in a decade in February.
While total inventories rose 31 percent since then, they are
still about 57 percent below the 10-year average.  Adaora Anunoby, a spokeswoman for NYSE Liffe, declined to
comment. Alec Gunn, a director at Commodity Centre, was
unavailable for comment.  Cocoa delivered into NYSE Liffe futures must have a valid
certificate from the bourse, which sets rules on origin, quality
and delivery points. Warehouses monitored by the bourse held
107,220 tons with valid certificates on July 22, with 57 percent
of the total in Antwerp depots, exchange data show. Total
stockpiles, including beans with expired certificates, were
142,140 tons.  Futures rose 8.9 percent to 1,563 pounds ($2,374) a ton on
NYSE Liffe this year, compared with a 17 percent slump in the
Standard & Poorâ€™s GSCI Agriculture Index of eight commodities.  To contact the reporter on this story:
