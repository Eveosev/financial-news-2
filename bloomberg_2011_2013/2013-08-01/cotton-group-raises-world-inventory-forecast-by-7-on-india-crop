Global cotton stockpiles next year
will be 7 percent bigger than estimated in July and the largest
ever as  India ’s crop improves and demand grows more slowly that
expected, the  International Cotton Advisory Committee  said.  Inventories on July 31, 2014, will reach 19.81 million
metric tons, up from 18.51 million forecast last month and 18.22
million held a year earlier, the Washington-based committee said
today in an e-mailed report. The surplus will have doubled in
four seasons as output exceeds demand.  While production in the 2013-2014 season will drop 3.1
percent from a year earlier to 25.59 million tons, that’s up
from 24.95 million predicted in July as ample monsoon rains in
India boost the nation’s harvest, according to the committee.
Consumption will be 24 million tons, compared with the 24.33
million tons estimated last month, it said.  On July 11, the  U.S. Department of Agriculture  boosted its
global crop estimate, citing output gains in India, the largest
grower after China, and  forecast  stockpiles of 20.5 million
tons.  Cotton futures in  New York  are down 9 percent since
reaching an 11-month high of 93.93 cents a pound in March as
concerns eased that world output will decline for a second year.
The contract for December delivery closed at 85.43 cents today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
