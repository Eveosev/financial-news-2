Reliance Communications Ltd. (RCOM) ,  India ’s
third-largest mobile-phone company by market value, reported
first-quarter profit that missed analysts’ estimates after
finance costs increased.  Net income  fell 33 percent to 1.08 billion rupees ($17.9
million) in the three months ended June, from 1.62 billion
rupees a year earlier, the Mumbai-based company said in a
statement today. That lagged behind the 1.49 billion-rupee
median of 18 analysts’  estimates  complied by Bloomberg.  The carrier posted its  15th drop  in profit in 16 quarters
after finance costs increased as the rupee weakened 8.6 percent
against the dollar last quarter. Billionaire  Anil Ambani ’s
company remains mired in  debt  as mobile income slumps and
operating costs surge, according to Harit Shah, a Mumbai-based
analyst with Nirmal Bang Equities Ltd.  “Debt remains a concern as always,” Shah said before
Reliance reported earnings. “With so much debt in hand, the
rupee’s depreciation this quarter really took its toll.”  Shares of Reliance fell 6 percent to 131.30 rupees at the
close in Mumbai trading, before the earnings announcement. They
have gained 78 percent this year, compared with the 0.6 percent
drop in the benchmark S&P BSE Sensex.
