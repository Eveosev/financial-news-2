Investec Plc (INVP) , which owns a bank and
money manager in South Africa and the U.K., said fiscal first-quarter operating profit was little changed amid receding bad
debt levels and weaker trading at its banking business.  Operating profit before goodwill, acquired intangibles,
non-operating items and taxation and after non-controlling
interests is “in line” with the same period a year earlier,
with earnings on that basis 11 percent higher on a currency
neutral basis, the Johannesburg- and London-based company said
in a statement today, without giving figures.  “The asset management and wealth and investment businesses
have continued to see net inflows and have benefited from higher
average funds under management, with both divisions recording
results ahead of the prior year,” Investec said. “The
specialist banking business reported results behind the prior
year largely due to lower activity levels from the weak trading
environment and the weakness of the rand.”  Investec is made up of asset management operations, a
wealth business and a specialist banking unit, operating across
the U.K.,  Australia  and South Africa. Investec has focused on
boosting return on equity and taking on more clients as it seeks
to increase earnings.  Investec is the best-performing bank stock in South Africa
this year, having gained 16 percent compared with the 6 percent
decline by the six-member FTSE/JSE Africa Banks Index. The stock
gained 3 percent to 67.70 rand at the close in Johannesburg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
