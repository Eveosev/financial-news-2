LivePerson Inc. (LPSN) , a maker of software
that allows businesses to track people on their websites,
rallied the most in 17 months in  New York  and  Tel Aviv  after
reporting sales that beat analysts’ estimates.  Shares of LivePerson rose 12 percent to $10.34 at 12:19
p.m. in New York, the biggest jump since February 2012. Trading
volume was almost twice the average over the past three months.
The rally trimmed this year’s drop to 21 percent. The stock
added 10 percent to 37.77 shekels, or $10.60, in Tel Aviv.  Sales at the New York-based company that has operations in
Israel rose 12 percent in the second quarter to $43.2 million,
LivePerson said in a statement after the market closed
yesterday. That  beat  the average estimate of 12 analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg of $42.9 million. Bookings, a measure of
future revenue, were $7.1 million in the last quarter, compared
to $6.9 million the year-ago period, while the company signed
139 deals and added two enterprise customers in  Japan , it said.  “That was encouraging,” Nathan Schneiderman, an analyst
at Roth Capital Partners LLC, in  Newport Beach , California, who
rates the shares buy, said in a telephone interview. “The
business looks like it’s going to improve. International seems
to be growing in momentum. Partnering is taking off.”  LivePerson tumbled 36 percent in New York on May 9, the
most in almost 12 years, as it cut the forecast for 2013 sales
after the loss of a major client.  To contact the reporter on this story:
