Roma won an All-Star game 3-1 as
 Major League Soccer  announced it will add four clubs by 2020.  The Italian team scored four minutes into last night’s game
on a goal by Kevin Strootman and added second-half goals by
Alessandro Florenzi and Junior Tallo at Sporting Park in Kansas
City. Omar Gonzalez of the  Los Angeles Galaxy  got the goal for
MLS in added time at the end of the game. The Roma team included
U.S. international midfielder  Michael Bradley .  British clubs including Manchester United, Chelsea and
Celtic contested the All-Star Game from 2005 through 2012, with
MLS winning five times.  The expansion of the U.S. and Canadian league will take the
total number of franchises to 24, Commissioner Don Garber
announced during halftime at Sporting Park.  “The addition of new teams will allow us to expand our
geographic coverage, grow our fan base and help us achieve our
vision of being among the best leagues in the world by 2022,”
 Garber said in a statement  on the MLS website.  MLS has added 10 franchises since 2005, including  New York 
City FC, which will take the total number of clubs to 20 when it
begins playing in 2015.  Orlando, Miami, Atlanta, Minneapolis, Detroit and
 Sacramento  are among cities to have expressed interest in having
an expansion team, the league said, and MLS said it has held
talks with “multiple markets and potential owners.”  The announcement came the same day the  Columbus Crew  was
acquired by Precourt Sports Ventures LLC from Hunt Sports Group,
which had operated the franchise since 1996.  To contact the reporter on this story:
