Hog futures advanced for the second
straight day on signs of lower U.S. supplies of animals. Cattle
prices dropped.  Meatpackers processed 1.17 million hogs in the first three
days of this week, down 1.8 percent from a week earlier and 4.6
percent below a year earlier, U.S. Department of Agriculture
data show. Spot  hogs  rose 1.2 percent to 95.34 cents a pound
yesterday, government data show.  “The lower kills” are supporting prices, Jason Golly, a
vice president of risk-management marketing at Lynch Livestock
Inc., said in a telephone interview. “Basically, the support of
the market is we’ve got the higher cash” prices, he said.  Hog futures for October settlement rose 0.4 percent to

Exchange. The commodity declined 2.8 percent this year through
