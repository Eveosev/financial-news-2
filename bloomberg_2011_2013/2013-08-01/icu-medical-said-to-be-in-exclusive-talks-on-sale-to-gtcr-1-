ICU Medical Inc. (ICUI) , the California-based maker of intravenous medical equipment, is in exclusive
talks to sell itself to Chicago private-equity firm GTCR LLC,
said people familiar with the matter.  GTCR reached out to investors to obtain as much as $750
million in financing for a deal, said one of the people, who
asked not to be named because the process is private. ICU
currently has a market value of more than $1 billion.  ICU’s products include medical devices used in drug
infusions such as needle-free IV connectors. The San Clemente,
California-based company is working with JPMorgan Chase & Co. on
finding buyers, people with knowledge of the matter said in May.  The shares rose 2.5 percent to $73.50 yesterday in  New
York . Representatives at JPMorgan, GTCR and ICU declined to
comment.  ICU, led by Chief Executive Officer  George Lopez , reduced
its forecasts for 2013 sales and profit last month. The
company’s roots date back almost 30 years, when Dr. Lopez
conceived of a locking device known as the ClickLock, according
to ICU’s website. Lopez remains the top  shareholder , with a
stake of about 11 percent as of June, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg.  GTCR, founded in 1980 by Stanley Golder, focuses on
financial services and technology, health care and information
technology, according to its website. The firm’s previous
 investments  include ConvergEx Group LLC and GeneraMedix
Pharmaceuticals Inc.  To contact the reporter on this story:
