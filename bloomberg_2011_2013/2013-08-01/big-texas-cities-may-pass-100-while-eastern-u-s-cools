High temperatures in Houston and
 Dallas  may pass 100 degrees Fahrenheit (38 Celsius) next week
while much of the eastern U.S. and Canada has cooler-than-normal
weather, said Matt Rogers, president of the Commodity Weather
Group LLC.  Temperatures may be 5 to 8 degrees below normal from the
Great Plains to the Great Lakes and about 3 degrees lower in the
U.S. Northeast and Canadian Maritimes from Aug. 6 to 10, said
Rogers, in Bethesda,  Maryland . Texas may be 3 to 5 degrees above
normal.  “There are timing and intensity questions still over the
details of the expected transient cool pushes over the next two
weeks, even though the models are in excellent agreement on the
prevailing pattern type,” Rogers said in a note to clients.  Seasonal to below-normal temperatures in the large cities
of the eastern U.S. and  Canada  may decrease energy consumption
because fewer people turn to air conditioning.  The normal average temperature in New York for Aug. 8 is
about 78 degrees, according to MDA Weather Services in
Gaithersburg, Maryland. In Boston it’s 74; Chicago, 74; Dallas,
87; St. Louis, 80; and  Seattle , 66.  To contact the reporter on this story:
