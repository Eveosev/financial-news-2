World corn production will be lower
in the 2013-14 season than predicted a month ago as the outlook
for the U.S. harvest was cut, the International Grains Council
said. The forecast for wheat output was raised.  Corn output may rise to 942.4 million metric tons from
859.1 million tons in 2012-13, the London-based IGC wrote in an
e-mailed report, trimming its outlook by 3.6 million tons from
an estimate on July 1. Ending stocks will still climb from the
previous season as production grows faster than usage, according
to the council.  Corn prices have slumped 32 percent on the Chicago Board of
Trade this year, the biggest such decline in more than 50 years,
as U.S. farmers are expected to harvest a record crop. The grain
is the second-worst performer this year on the S&P GSCI
Commodity Index, behind silver.  “Prices have fallen sharply through July as benign weather
conditions have reinforced good output prospects,” the IGC
said. “With record crops forecast in the U.S.,  China  and
Ukraine, world production is forecast to increase 10 percent.”  The harvest will lift end-of-season corn stocks to 148
million tons from 120 million tons, the IGC forecast, lowering
its July prediction by 1 million tons. Inventories in the four
biggest exporters will rise to a nine-year high, it said.  The U.S. corn crop may rise to 350 million tons from 273.8
million tons in the previous season, the IGC said, cutting its
forecast by 5 million tons from a month earlier. The outlook for
Ukraine was raised by 1 million tons to 24 million tons,
climbing from 20.9 million tons in 2012.  Wheat Forecast  Farmers across the world are forecast to reap 686.9 million
tons of wheat, up from a 2012-13 crop estimated at 653.6 million
tons and 3.8 million tons more than a July outlook, according to
the IGC.  Estimates were raised for the wheat crop in the European
Union, as well as  India  and the U.S. The outlook for production
in China was maintained at 118 million tons, down from 120.6
million tons in 2012.  Wheat imports by China are forecast to climb to 7 million
tons from 3.5 million tons, based on quality issues for the
country’s domestic crop, according to the council.  Global stocks of wheat are predicted to increase to 176
million tons from 175 million tons a year earlier, while 5
million tons less than previously expected after revisions to
historical inventory numbers, according to the IGC.  Total output of grains excluding rice may climb to 1.92
billion tons from an estimated 1.79 billion tons in 2012-13, the
IGC wrote.  World rice production is seen rising to 476 million tons
from 469 million tons, lifting stocks to 109 million tons from
107 million tons, the council forecast, leaving its outlook
unchanged from last month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
