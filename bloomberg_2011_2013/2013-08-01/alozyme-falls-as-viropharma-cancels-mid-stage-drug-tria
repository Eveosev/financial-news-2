Halozyme Therapeutics Inc. (HALO) , a
developer of drug-delivery systems, fell as much as 18 percent
after its partner  ViroPharma Inc. (VPHM)  ended a mid-stage trial of a
therapy for a genetic disease that causes severe swelling.  Halozyme  dropped  15 percent to $7.21 at 9:33 a.m. New York
time and fell as low as $7. ViroPharma lost 5.5 percent to
$32.45. The trial’s cancellation was announced by the companies
in statements today.  ViroPharma was running a clinical trial of a subcutaneous
formulation of Cinryze, its drug to prevent the swelling
attacks. Halozyme’s recombinant human hyaluronidase, or rHuPH20,
was being combined with Cinryze for the subcutaneous treatment.  The treatment for hereditary angioedema was in the second
of three phases of trials usually required before U.S.
regulatory approval when some patients developed unexpected
antibodies, Exton, Pennsylvania-based ViroPharma said. San
Diego-based Halozyme said that the companies hadn’t seen any
adverse effects, and called the halt a precaution.  “We support ViroPharma’s business decision,” Halozyme
Chief Executive Officer Gregory Frost said in a statement.  Frost said he was confident of the drug’s safety profile.  A trail of recombinant human hyaluronidase was halted a
year ago, as well, before being restarted.  To contact the reporter on this story:
