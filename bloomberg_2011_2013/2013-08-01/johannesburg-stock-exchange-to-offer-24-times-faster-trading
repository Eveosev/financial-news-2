The  Johannesburg Stock Exchange (JALSH) ,
 Africa ’s largest bourse, has started discussions with
contractors to begin building a co-location service next to its
own data center that will speed up trading.  The co-location facility, which will initially have space
for 35 racks for clients’ computers, could be boosted to 140 in
future, Leanne Parsons, equity market director for the JSE Ltd.,
the operator of the exchange, said in an interview today. The
site will probably be completed in the first six months of next
year. It will offer a connection speed as fast as 100
microseconds, or one-10,000th of a second, compared with 2,400
microseconds for exchange members currently in the Johannesburg
suburb of Sandton.  “If you’re in co-location, the network advantage is going
to be 24 times faster than somebody in Sandton” who isn’t using
the service, Parsons said. “You are talking about significantly
different speeds.”  The  JSE (JSE) ’s co-location facility will be the first in Africa
and the company plans to boost trading volumes through the
service, Parsons said.  The operator said on July 29 earnings excluding one-time
items for the six months through June will probably be 20
percent to 40 percent higher per share than a year earlier. The
growth was driven by “increased trading activity” in equities
and derivatives and the absence of an impairment charge,
according to a statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
