West Texas Intermediate crude climbed
the most in more than three weeks as manufacturing grew in the
U.S. and  China  and labor protests shut Libya’s oil-export
terminals.  Futures jumped 2.7 percent as the Institute for Supply
Management’s U.S. factory  index  expanded at the fastest pace in
two years in July and China’s Purchasing Managers’ Index beat
expectations. Libyan Oil Minister Abdulbari Al-Arusi forecast
yesterday that export capacity would plunge almost 80 percent
today with only one port operable. Brent oil rose 1.7 percent.  “The macro news has been positive from the oil
perspective,” said  Michael Wittner , the head of oil-market
research at Societe Generale SA in New York. “If Libya’s
exports are temporarily cut, that’s definitely supportive for
Brent and the overall complex, including WTI.”  WTI crude for September delivery increased $2.86 to $107.89
a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange, the biggest gain
since July 10 and the highest settlement since July 19. The
volume of all futures traded was 16 percent above the 100-day
average at 3:40 p.m. Prices advanced 8.8 percent in July, the
biggest monthly advance since August 2012.  Brent oil for September settlement climbed $1.84 to end the
session at $109.54 a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures
Europe exchange. The European benchmark’s premium to WTI
narrowed to $1.65 from $2.67 yesterday.  U.S. ISM  The U.S. manufacturing index rose to 55.4 in July from 50.9
in June, according to the ISM in Tempe,  Arizona . Economists
surveyed by Bloomberg had expected an increase to 52.  U.S.  jobless claims  slid 19,000 last week to 326,000, the
lowest level in more than five years, the Labor Department said
today. The department may report tomorrow that employment rose
by 185,000 last month, according to the median estimate of
economists surveyed by Bloomberg.  China’s manufacturing index, reported today by the National
Bureau of Statistics and the China Federation of Logistics and
Purchasing, increased to 50.3 last month, exceeding the 49.8
median forecast in a Bloomberg survey.  The U.S. and China are the world’s two biggest oil-consuming countries, accounting for about a third of world
demand in 2012, according to  BP Plc (BP/) ’s Statistical Review of
World Energy.  “Oil is up because the economic data is rocking today,”
said Phil Flynn, senior market analyst at the Price Futures
Group in  Chicago . “The Chinese manufacturing numbers were
better than expected, and all of the data that’s followed today
has been positive.”  Libyan Exports  Libya’sAl-Arusi said yesterday that all oil terminals
except Zawiya would close today, reducing exports by some 1.1
million barrels a day from the holder of  Africa ’s biggest crude
reserves. Exports were 1.425 million barrels July 30, the
minister said at the press briefing in Tripoli.  “The economy looks better, while the news from Libya is
lousy,” said Michael Lynch, president of Strategic Energy &
Economic Research in Winchester,  Massachusetts . “This is a very
bullish combination of factors.”  The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries pumped
less crude for a second month in July amid the biggest drop in
Libyan output since the 2011 war that overthrew Muammar Qaddafi.
OPEC output fell 245,000 barrels, or 0.8 percent, to an average
30.662 million barrels a day from 30.907 million in June, a
Bloomberg survey of oil companies, producers and analysts shows.  Equities Rally  Crude also gained as the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index jumped
above 1,700 for the first time after the release of the positive
economic data. The S&P 500 was up 1.3 percent and the Dow Jones
Industrial Average climbed 0.8 percent at 3:40 p.m.  Futures climbed 1.9 percent yesterday after the Energy
Information Administration reported that crude stockpiles at
Cushing,  Oklahoma , the main U.S. oil storage hub, fell to a 15-month low in the week ended July 26 and the Federal Reserve said
that low inflation may harm growth and pledged to maintain $85
billion a month in bond purchases to stimulate the economy.  “The Fed announcement that they are worried about
deflation makes it less likely that they will reduce stimulus
anytime soon,” Flynn said.  WTI also gained as  Enterprise Products Partners LP (EPD)  Chief
Operating Officer Jim Teague said that heavy crude has accounted
for about 30 percent of the volume on the Seaway Pipeline, which
moves oil to the Houston area from Cushing.  The line moves an average 300,000 barrels a day of crude
and has reached as much as 400,000 barrels, Teague said today on
the company’s second-quarter earnings conference call.
Enterprise and Seaway co-owner  Enbridge Inc. (ENB)  reversed the
direction of the pipeline last year.  Seaway Flows  “Seaway’s announcement was definitely bullish for the
front,” said  Andrew Lebow , a senior vice president at Jefferies
Bache LLC in New York, speaking of the oil contracts closest to
expiration. “This means they’re running 70 percent light, more
than people thought.”  Implied volatility for at-the-money WTI options expiring in
September was 21.5 percent, compared with 21.9 percent
yesterday, data compiled by Bloomberg showed.  Electronic trading volume on the Nymex was 643,067
contracts as of 3:40 p.m. It totaled 582,312 contracts
yesterday, 12 percent below the three-month average. Open
interest was 1.85 million contracts.  To contact the reporters on this story:
