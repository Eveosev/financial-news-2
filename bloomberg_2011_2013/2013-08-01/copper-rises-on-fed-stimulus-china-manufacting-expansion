Copper capped the biggest two-day
rally since early May after the  Federal Reserve  maintained bond
purchases and manufacturing unexpectedly expanded in  China , the
world’s largest user of the metal.  The Fed said yesterday it will continue buying debt to
stoke U.S. growth. China said its purchasing managers’ index for
July was 50.3, above the level of 50 that separates growth and
contraction and beating the estimate of 49.8 in a Bloomberg
survey of economists. Copper prices were down 15 percent this
year through yesterday on concern that demand would slow, so
investors are now buying copper to close out bearish bets,
according to Michael Turek at Newedge Group SA in New York.  “Short-covering accelerated as the Fed suggested that the
 U.S. economy  is not yet ready to walk, much less run, without
the crutch of stimulus,” Turek, a senior director,said in an e-mail. “Last night’s Chinese manufacturing data improved, too.”  Copper futures for delivery in September advanced 1.5
percent to $3.166 a pound at 1:09 p.m. on the Comex in  New York ,
leaving prices up 4.1 percent over two days, the most since May
6.  A separate gauge of Chinese manufacturing from HSBC
Holdings Plc and Markit Economics last week fell to 47.7, an 11-month low.  World copper supply, bolstered by rising mine output, may
outstrip demand in 2014 for a second year and touch a five-year
high, according to Pan Pacific Copper Co.,  Japan ’s top producer.  Stockpiles monitored by the London Metal Exchange dropped
for a 12th session, the longest streak since May 2012, to
610,725 metric tons, daily exchange figures showed. Inventories
in  Malaysia ’s Johor, the biggest repository in the LME’s global
network, slid 15 percent last month. Orders to take copper from
warehouses fell 0.7 percent to 312,575 tons today.  On the LME, copper for delivery in three months rose 1.7
percent to $6,999 a metric ton ($3.17 a pound).  Aluminum, lead, nickel, tin and zinc were higher in  London .  To contact the reporters on this story:
