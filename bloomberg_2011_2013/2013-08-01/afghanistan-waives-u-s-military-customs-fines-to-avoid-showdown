Afghanistan  averted a clash with the
U.S. by agreeing to waive fines on the transport of military
equipment ahead of next year’s drawdown of troops after some
senators called for cuts in foreign aid to the country.  President Hamid Karzai’s government reached an agreement
with the U.S.-led International Security Assistance Force to
waive $70 million in penalties and fines associated with the
removal of military materiel, Abdul Qader Jilani, a spokesman
for the finance ministry, said in a phone interview from Kabul.  Goods shipped into Afghanistan by foreign armies are exempt
from taxes or custom duties. To claim the exemption though each
container must be accompanied by the correct paperwork and most
of those forms were not filled out. Without the paperwork each
container faced a $1,000 fine, Jilani said.  Senator Patrick Leahy, a Vermont Democrat who heads the
Judiciary Committee, and Senator Lindsey Graham from South
Carolina last month said the U.S. should withhold $5 in foreign
aid to Afghanistan for every $1 in fees imposed on repatriating
equipment, the Associated Press  reported .  U.S. government contractors in Afghanistan are being hit
with millions of dollars in “mostly improper” fees and
penalties on top of nearly $1 billion in improper tax
assessments, a U.S. watchdog agency said last month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
