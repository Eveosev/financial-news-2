The Senate voted 87 to 10 to confirm
Samantha Power as U.S. ambassador to the  United Nations .  Power, 42, was nominated by President Barack Obama on June
5, and previously served on the staff of the White House
National Security Council. She’s a human-rights activist and
former journalist who won a Pulitzer Prize for a 2002 book about
U.S. policy in Bosnia and Rwanda titled “A Problem From Hell:
America and the Age of Genocide.”  “She has been a tireless defender of human rights and she
has seen the tragedy of human suffering firsthand,” New Jersey
Senator  Robert Menendez , a Democrat and chairman of the Senate
Foreign Relations Committee, said on the Senate floor before
today’s vote.  Senator Marco Rubio of Florida was one of ten senators, all
Republicans, who voted against Power’s nomination. Rubio said he
couldn’t support her because she hasn’t pledged to take
“significant steps” to revamp the United Nations.  Power succeeds  Susan Rice , who left the UN post to become
Obama’s national security adviser in June.  To contact the reporter on this story:
