South African vehicle  sales  growth
rebounded in July from a three-month low.  Sales rose 7.5 percent from a year earlier to 58,140, the
Pretoria-based National Association of Automobile Manufacturers
of  South Africa  said in an e-mailed statement today.  The  Reserve Bank  held the  benchmark  repurchase rate at 5
percent last month as inflation pressures prevented it from
cutting rates to stimulate the economy, which expanded at the
slowest pace since a 2009 recession in the first three months of
the year.  Passenger-car sales rose 6.4 percent in July from a year
earlier to 40,274, while sales of light commercial vehicles,
such as pick-up trucks and minivans, climbed 9.2 percent to
15,047, the industry association said. Vehicle exports fell 3.6
percent to 26,608.  The rand dropped 0.2 percent to 9.8939 per dollar at 2:46
p.m. in Johannesburg, extending the yearâ€™s decline to 14
percent.  RGT Smart compiles the data for the industry association.  To contact the reporter on this story:
