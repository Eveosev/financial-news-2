A gauge of U.S. corporate credit risk
held as central banks pledged to continue stimulus efforts.  Ford
Motor Co. (F)  sold $1 billion in its first 10-year benchmark bond
issue since September.  The Markit CDX North American Investment Grade Index, a
credit-default swaps benchmark that investors use to hedge
against losses or to speculate on creditworthiness, decreased
0.2 basis point to a mid-price of 74.4 basis points as of 4:23
p.m. in New York, according to prices compiled by Bloomberg. The
measure earlier dropped to 73.3 basis points.  The European Central Bank and Bank of England both
reaffirmed accommodative policies today to keep borrowing costs
low and to spur economic growth. The Federal Reserve said
yesterday it will continue to buy $85 billion of bonds a month
in an asset-purchase program that’s bolstered credit markets.  “The market has been pretty well comforted by the Fed’s
commentary yesterday,” Jon Sablowsky, head of trading at
Brownstone Investment Group LLC in New York, said in a telephone
interview. The central bank is still “being supportive of the
market environment.”  The credit-swaps index typically falls as investor
confidence improves and rises as it deteriorates. The contracts
pay the buyer face value if a borrower fails to meet its
obligations, less the value of the defaulted debt. A basis point
equals $1,000 annually on a contract protecting $10 million of
debt.  Jobless Claims  Applications for unemployment insurance payments declined
by 19,000 to 326,000 in the week ended July 27, the fewest since
January 2008, from a revised 345,000 the prior week, the Labor
Department reported today in  Washington .  Fed Chairman Ben S. Bernanke told lawmakers July 17 in
Washington that the pace of the Fed’s bond buying is “by no
means on a preset course” and policy makers would “be
responding to the data.”  Ford Motor Credit, a finance unit of the second-largest
U.S. automaker, sold $1 billion of 4.375 percent, 10-year notes
to yield 178 basis points more than similar-maturity Treasuries,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Celgene Corp. (CELG)  sold $1.5 billion of bonds in three-parts
with its first offering in a year. The Summit, New Jersey-based
biopharmaceutical company issued $400 million each of 2.3
percent, five-year notes to yield 85 basis points more than
benchmarks and 5.25 percent, 30-year debt at a relative yield of
155 basis points, Bloomberg data show. It also sold $700 million
of 4 percent, 10-year securities at a 135 basis-point spread.  Credit Spreads  The average relative yield on investment-grade debt
tightened 2.2 basis points to 126.6 basis points, Bloomberg data
show.  The risk premium on the Markit CDX North American High
Yield Index rose 0.8 basis point to 371.3 basis points,
Bloomberg prices show.  The 12-month trailing speculative-grade corporate default
rate fell to 2.5 percent in July from 2.6 percent the month
prior, Standard & Poor’s analysts led by  Diane Vazza  said in a
report today.  The default rate will increase to 3.3 percent by March
2014, the analysts wrote. Thirty-one companies have defaulted in
2013, compared with 28 through July last year.  The average relative yield on speculative-grade, or junk-rated, debt tightened 9.7 basis points to 547.9 basis points,
Bloomberg data show. High-yield, high-risk debt is rated below
Baa3 by Moody’s Investors Service and less than BBB- at S&P.  To contact the reporter on this story:
