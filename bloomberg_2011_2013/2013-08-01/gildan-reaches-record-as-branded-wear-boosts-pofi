Gildan Activewear Inc. (GIL) , the Canadian
producer of cotton T-shirts to underwear, rose to a record
after reporting third-quarter earnings at the high end of the
company’s guidance and analysts’ estimates.  Gildan rose 4.7 percent to C$47.97 at the close in Toronto,
the highest since the company went public in June 1998 and the
biggest one-day jump since August, 2012. The shares have gained
32 percent this year, compared with a 1.3 percent rise in the
Standard and Poor’s/TSX Composite Index.  Montreal-based Gildan posted earnings of $116.5 million or
95 cents per share, adjusted for certain items, compared with
$80.2 million or 66 cents a year earlier. The company previously
projected earnings of 92 cents to 95 cents per share. Results
beat the 94-cent  average  of analysts’ estimates compiled by
Bloomberg.  “The company began shipment of its first major Gildan-branded underwear program to a national mass-market retailer,”
the company said today in a statement. “Initial retailer sales
of the Gildan underwear products are very strong, and consumer
demand is well in excess of expectations.”  Gildan acquired New Buffalo Shirt Factory Inc.
manufacturing facilities on June 21, providing it with
screenprinting and decorating capabilities to enhance its
ability to act as a supply chain partner for larger athletic and
lifestyle brands.  Gildan narrowed its full year adjusted earnings expectation
to $2.67 to $2.70 per share, from its previous guidance range of
$2.65 to $2.70.  To contact the reporter on this story:
