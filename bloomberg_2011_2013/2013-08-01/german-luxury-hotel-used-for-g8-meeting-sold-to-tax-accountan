The  Grand Hotel Heiligendamm , a
luxury property on  Germany ’s Baltic Sea that was used for a
Group of Eight meeting in 2007 before going bankrupt, was
purchased by a German accountant for an undisclosed sum.  Paul Morzynski,  founder of a Hanover-based tax advisory
firm, acquired the 200-room property today and plans to continue
running it as a hotel, according to a statement. In May, a
Berlin-based investment firm had offered to buy the hotel for 30
million euros ($40 million), according to NDR radio’s website.  Heiligendamm, 23 kilometers (14 miles) west of the city of
Rostock in eastern Germany, is the country’s oldest seaside
health resort dating from 1793, according to its website.  World
leaders  including Angela Merkel,  George W. Bush ,  Vladimir Putin 
and  Tony Blair  stayed there during the G8 meeting in 2007.  The resort filed for insolvency in February 2012 after its
owner, Fundus-Gruppe, could no longer pay interest on its loans,
according to a  statement  from Fundus at the time.  Morzynski is also chairman of the 200-year-old Halloren
chocolate company in the eastern German city of Hallen, which he
bought out of bankruptcy in 1992, according to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
