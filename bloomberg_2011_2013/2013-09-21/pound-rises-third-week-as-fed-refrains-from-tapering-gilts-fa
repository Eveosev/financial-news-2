The pound strengthened for a third
week against the dollar after the  Federal Reserve  unexpectedly
refrained from slowing debt purchases that have devalued the
U.S. currency.  Sterling climbed to the highest level in eight months
versus the greenback as minutes of the Bank of England’s
September meeting showed U.K. officials saw no need for
additional stimulus as the economy improves. Britain’s
government bonds fell, pushing 10-year yields toward the highest
level since July 2011, as the minutes damped speculation the
central bank will resume purchasing the securities.  “Sterling has clearly seen positive momentum in recent
months,” said Lee McDarby, executive director of U.K. corporate
foreign-exchange sales at Nomura International Plc in  London .
“This is thanks to a good run of firm data and a feeling in the
market the new Bank of England chief,  Mark Carney , is not as
bearish as many feared. The longer the U.S. waits to unwind
quantitative easing, the more sterling should benefit from broad
dollar weakness.”  The pound advanced 0.9 percent this week to $1.6022 as of
5:02 p.m. London time yesterday after climbing to $1.6163 on
Sept. 18, the highest level since Jan. 11. The U.K. currency
dropped 0.8 percent to 84.40 pence per euro.  Gains in the pound were tempered after a government report
on Sept. 19 showed U.K. retail sales unexpectedly declined in
August. The U.K. currency dropped 0.7 percent that day.  Best Performer  Sterling has risen 5.8 percent in the past six months, the
best performer of 10 developed-nation currencies tracked by
Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes. The euro gained 4.1
percent and the dollar weakened 0.9 percent.  Fed policy makers said this week they want more evidence of
a recovery before paring their $85 billion-a-month quantitative-easing program. Chairman Ben. S. Bernanke said the central bank
must determine its policies based on “what’s needed for the
economy,” even if it surprises markets.  Bank of England  minutes published on Sept. 18 showed the
Monetary Policy Committee voted unanimously to keep its bond-purchase target at 375 billion pounds.  The yield on the benchmark 10-year gilt rose one basis
point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 2.92 percent this week after
rising to 3.05 percent on Sept. 11, the highest since July 27,
2011. The 2.25 percent bond maturing in September 2023 fell
0.06, or 60 pence per 1,000-pound face amount, to 94.235.  The U.K. is scheduled to sell inflation-linked securities
due in March 2068 via banks next week. The Debt Management
Office has hired Barclays Plc, Deutsche Bank AG, HSBC Holdings
Plc and Morgan Stanley to manage the deal.  U.K. government bonds lost 4.3 percent this year through
Sept. 19, according to Bloomberg World Bond Indexes. German
securities dropped 2.3 percent and Treasuries fell 3 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
