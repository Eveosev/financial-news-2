RWE AG (RWE) , the biggest producer of
electricity in Germany, plans to cut 3,400 of about 18,000 jobs
at its Generation SE unit by 2018 as margins for its
conventional power plants dwindle, said a person briefed on the
matter.  About 2,300 positions will be eliminated in Germany, while
900 people will lose their jobs in the U.K. and 200 in the
Netherlands, said the person, who asked not to be identified
before the plan is made public. Annett Urbaczka, a spokeswoman
at Essen-based RWE, confirmed that staff at the Generation SE
unit will be reduced, while declining to provide a number.  Weak European electricity demand and increased output of
alternative energy is squeezing margins at traditional gas and
coal-fired plants. RWE said in August it will shut 3,100
megawatts of capacity in  Germany  and the Netherlands, about 7
percent of its total in northern  Europe , after operating profit
from conventional power generation fell 62 percent in the first
six months of the year.  RWE’s supervisory board agreed on the job reductions when
it met to discuss future strategy in Warsaw this past week, the
person said. The company two days ago said it will cut dividend
payments in half next year as it contends with a government-imposed shift to renewable energy in Germany.  The Generation unit’s NEO cost savings program will be
increased to more than the previously announced 500 million
euros ($676 million), the person said, declining to elaborate.  RWE doesn’t plan to sell new  shares , the person said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
