Emirates Team  New Zealand  is still
one win away from capturing the America’s Cup after yesterday’s
two races on  San Francisco Bay  were canceled because of bad
weather.  Racing was delayed by rain, and then called off for the day
because the wind was coming from the wrong direction. Two more
races are scheduled today.  “We saw this day coming a few days ago,” said Regatta
Director Iain Murray. “We do have an alternate course that we
offered up to the teams, but they weren’t interested in sailing
that course. They preferred to wait until the wind is back to
the southwest on the normal racecourse.”  New Zealand needs one more race win to clinch the 162-year-old sailing trophy. Defending champion Oracle Team USA trails 8-3 in the best-of-17 series and needs to win the next six races
to retain the Cup.  “The racing that’s left is extremely important and the
teams don’t want to chance something that they’re not prepared
for,” Murray said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
