With Emirates Team New Zealand
still one win away from capturing the America’s Cup, today’s
first race on San Francisco Bay has been delayed by rain.  The race was scheduled to start at 1:15 p.m. San Francisco
time, and now is set to begin at 2 p.m.  New Zealand needs one more race win to clinch the
162-year-old sailing trophy. Defending champion Oracle Team USA
trails 8-3 in the best-of-17 series and needs to win the next
six races to retain the Cup.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
