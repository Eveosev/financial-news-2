Stephen Hawking, the physicist
whose motor neuron disease left him virtually unable to move,
escapes his wheelchair when he dreams, according to an interview
in the London-based Times today.  Hawking, 71, is always able-bodied in his dreams, the
newspaper cited him as saying. The Cambridge University
professor and best-selling author was diagnosed with the
debilitating condition when he was 21. He lost the use of his
hands and voice and communicates with a computerized voice.  International fame has affected his personal life, the
newspaper cited him as saying. “I can’t disguise myself with a
beard and dark glasses. The wheelchair gives me away.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
