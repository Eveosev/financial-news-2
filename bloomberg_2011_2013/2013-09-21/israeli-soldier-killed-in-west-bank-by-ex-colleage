An Israeli soldier was lured to the
West Bank and murdered by a former colleague who plotted to
trade his victim’s body for the release of his imprisoned
brother, Israeli security forces said.  Nadal Amar, 42, who had previously worked with the soldier
in a restaurant, confessed to the murder and said he had hidden
the body in a water well, the Israeli Defense Forces said in an
e-mailed statement.  “In his investigation Nadal added that the motive for
murdering the soldier was to trade his body for his brother’s
release - Nur Al Din Amer, a Tanzim Fatah operative imprisoned
since 2003 for his involvement in several terror attacks,” the
IDF said in the e-mailed statement.  Earlier this year, an Israeli man was killed at a road
junction in the northern West Bank by a Palestinian man who
stabbed the victim, then grabbed his pistol and shot him with
it. That death was the first time in more than a year that an
Israeli was killed in the West Bank.  Three Palestinians, including a 17-year-old, were shot dead
by Israeli security forces in August during an arrest raid
inside a West Bank refugee camp near  Ramallah .  To contact the reporter on this story:
