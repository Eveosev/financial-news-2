World champion Sebastian Vettel
will start from pole position today as he seeks a third
consecutive victory at the  Singapore  Grand Prix.  Vettel posted a time of 1 minute, 42.841 seconds on the
first run of the third qualifying round around the Marina Bay
Circuit yesterday. The Red Bull driver elected to forgo a second
run and claimed his fifth pole of the season, and 41st of his
career, as Mercedes’s Nico Rosberg finished second in 1:42.932.  “It’s a weird feeling because you’re standing in the
garage,” Vettel said at a news conference. “I was watching the
times carefully, and fortunately I was strong enough to stay
ahead. It was a great feeling because it could go wrong.”  In addition to winning the past two races in Singapore,
Vettel also has captured the last two events of the Formula One
season to extend his lead in the championship. He has 222 points
after 12 of 19 races, 53 points more than Fernando Alonso of
Ferrari.  Romain Grosjean of Lotus qualified third ahead of Red
Bull’s Mark Webber. Mercedes’s Lewis Hamilton, Ferrari’s Felipe Massa and Alonso, McLaren’s Jenson Button, STR’s Daniel
Ricciardo and Sauber’s Esteban Gutierrez rounded out the top 10
qualifiers.  To contact the reporter on this story:
