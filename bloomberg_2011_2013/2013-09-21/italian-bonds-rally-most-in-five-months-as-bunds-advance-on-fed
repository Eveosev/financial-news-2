Italy’s bonds rose this week, with
10-year yields falling the most since April, as  Europe ’s
government securities advanced amid bets central banks will
maintain stimulus that boosts demand for fixed-income assets.  Italian  10-year yields  slid to the lowest level in a month
after a motion to halt expulsion proceedings against former
Premier  Silvio Berlusconi  in the nation’s Senate was rejected.
Benchmark German bund yields dropped to the lowest since August
as the U.S. Federal Reserve refrained from reducing the pace of
its asset purchases.  Spain ’s 10-year yield spread over  Germany 
narrowed to the least in two years after euro-area investor
confidence rose. Germany holds federal elections tomorrow.  “There was a Fed-induced move which pushed fixed-income
higher,” said Christian Lenk, a fixed-income analyst at DZ Bank
AG in  Frankfurt . “There’s also a relief rally because everyone
was looking at the Berlusconi vote and worrying that was going
to destabilize the government. The focus is off that for now and
that’s helped Italian bonds.”  Italy ’s  10-year yield  fell 29 basis points, or 0.29
percentage point,  this week  to 4.29 percent as of 5 p.m. London
time yesterday. That’s the steepest drop since the period ended
April 5. The 4.5 percent security due in May 2023 climbed 2.225,
or 22.25 euros per 1,000-euro ($1,352) face amount, to 102.005.  Spread Narrows  Spain’s  10-year yield  was at 4.30 percent, down 19 basis
points since the end of last week. The spread investors demand
to hold Spanish 10-year bonds instead of similar-maturity German
bunds narrowed 16 basis points in the week to 236 basis points
after dropping to 234 yesterday, the narrowest since July 1,
2011.  The Fed maintained its monthly purchases of $85 billion of
bonds and mortgage-backed debt on Sept. 18, saying it needs more
evidence of an improvement in the  U.S. economy . Analysts had
forecast policy makers would cut Treasury purchases by $5
billion to $40 billion.  In Italy, the wrangling over Berlusconi has threatened
Enrico Letta’s government by splitting the ruling coalition.
Lawmakers in People of Liberty, the second-biggest party in the
alliance, have threatened to resign if Berlusconi loses his
seat. Letta’s  Democratic Party , the largest group in parliament,
has said Berlusconi’s expulsion is required by law.  Italy is scheduled to  auction  five- and 10-year securities
on Sept. 27.  German Yields  Germany’s  10-year bund  yield fell three basis points in the
week to 1.94 percent after falling to 1.85 percent on Sept. 19,
the  lowest  since Aug. 30.  French (GFRN10)  10-year yields slid nine basis
points to 2.45 percent, while the rate on similar-maturity
Belgian bonds also dropped nine basis points, to 2.73 percent.  Merkel, who has governed Germany in an alliance with the
pro-business Free Democrats since 2009 may have to enter a

said on Sept. 17 that its index of German investor and analyst
expectations rose to 49.6 in September from 42 in August. An
indicator of euro-area investor confidence increased to 58.6
from 44, the  highest  since September 2009.  Markit Economics will say on Sept. 23 its gauges of
manufacturing and services activity in the euro region, based on
