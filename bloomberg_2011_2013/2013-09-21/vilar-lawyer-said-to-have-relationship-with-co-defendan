The lawyer representing technology
investor Alberto Vilar, who faces resentencing for his 2008
conviction for stealing from clients, is in a romantic
relationship with his co-defendant, prosecutors said.  Vivien Shevitz’s relationship with Gary Tanaka, “by all
appearances, would impair Ms. Shevitz’s duty of loyalty to Vilar
and cloud her judgment with respect to Tanaka,” Justice
Department lawyers said in a letter today to U.S. District Judge
Richard Sullivan in  Manhattan .  The U.S. lawyers submitted a proposed list of questions for
the two former Amerindo Investment Advisors Inc. partners to
make sure that they understood the potential conflict of
interest of the lawyer, who represents them both in the case,
and that they knowingly and voluntarily waive the possible
conflict.  The U.S. Court of Appeals in New York last month reversed
the sentences of the two men and sent the case back to Sullivan.
The 2008 jury convictions weren’t overturned on appeal.  Shevitz didn’t immediately return a phone message after
regular business hours seeking comment on the letter.  The case is U.S. v. Vilar, 05-00621, U.S. District Court,
Southern District of New York (Manhattan.)  To contact the reporter on this story:
