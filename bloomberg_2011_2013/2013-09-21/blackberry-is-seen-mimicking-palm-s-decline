BlackBerry Ltd. (BBRY)  reported a more
than 40 percent plunge in sales and vowed to cut a third of its
workforce, raising concern that it’s on the same downward spiral
as Palm Inc., though without prospects for a last-minute buyer.  The company said yesterday that it’s eliminating 4,500 jobs
and recording an inventory writedown of as much as $960 million
for the fiscal second quarter. BlackBerry expects to report a
net operating loss of as much as $995 million in the period and
sales of $1.6 billion -- about half the $3.03 billion that
analysts had estimated, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The bleak results sent BlackBerry shares tumbling 17
percent and drew comparisons to Palm, another smartphone pioneer
that fell out of favor with consumers. Like BlackBerry, that
company attempted a comeback with a new operating system -- only
to see it fizzle with shoppers. Palm was able to entice
 Hewlett-Packard Co. (HPQ)  into buying it in 2010, though that didn’t
save the product line from being discontinued.  “It reminds me very much of Palm,” said Keith Lam,
managing partner with Red Sky Capital Management Ltd. in
Toronto. “HP tried to catch a knife buying Palm and it didn’t
work out. So I’m not sure why anybody would step in here. These
numbers are extremely bad.”  BlackBerry shares fell to $8.73 at the close in  New York 
yesterday, marking the biggest one-day drop in more than two
months. The stock has declined 26 percent this year, bringing its
market value to $4.6 billion.  Sale Process  BlackBerry said last month that it was forming a special
committee to evaluate its strategic options, including a
potential sale of the company. Finding a buyer may not be easy,
though. JPMorgan Chase & Co. and  RBC Capital Markets  spent close
to a year quietly canvassing potential acquirers without
success, people with knowledge of the matter said last month.  BlackBerry also has hired accounting firm
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP to evaluate the company for potential
buyers, according to two people with knowledge of the move.  The company put out its financial results a week before
their scheduled release, aiming to get the news out of the way
and show that it was charting a course toward recovery. In a
concession that it has failed to gain traction against  Apple
Inc. (AAPL) ’s iPhones or Google Inc.’s Android devices, BlackBerry is
narrowing its focus to the market for corporate users.  Still, that decision may not be enough, Lam said. The
revamped BlackBerry 10 lineup, the linchpin of the company’s
comeback plan, hasn’t sold as well as analysts had estimated.
Customers such as Morgan Stanley are holding off on committing
to new devices, concerned about BlackBerry’s future.  Nail in Coffin  “That’s the nail in the coffin,” said Lam, whose firm
manages C$220 million ($214 million). While Red Sky was a
BlackBerry investor, it’s getting rid of its stake because of
the results, he said. “There’s no point anymore.”  BlackBerry’s $1.6 billion in revenue would be its lowest
quarterly sales since 2007, when smartphones were a nascent
market. Back then, the iPhone had been out for less than three
months, and Google’s now-dominant Android operating system was
still in the development phase.  Chief Executive Officer Thorsten Heins was counting on the
BlackBerry 10 phones -- introduced in January to good reviews --
to reverse a sales slide, return the company to profitability
and make the brand hip again. Instead, its market share
continues to slide and BlackBerry remains in the red.  The Canadian company said it will record revenue for sales
of 3.7 million smartphones last quarter, mainly from earlier
BlackBerry 7 devices. In all, 5.9 million smartphones were sold
through to customers in the period, including ones shipped to
carriers earlier, the company said.  Z10 Flop  The inventory writedown is mostly for the Z10 touch-screen
device, which was seen as the company’s flagship model and chief
iPhone competitor. BlackBerry also introduced two phones this
year with physical keyboards, the Q10 and Q5.  The adjusted second-quarter net loss will be as much as
$265 million, or 51 cents a share, BlackBerry said. That
compared with the average analyst estimate of 16 cents.  The latest job cuts follow a move to eliminate 5,000 jobs
last year, part of an effort to save $1 billion in operating
costs. BlackBerry had 12,700 workers as of the end of March, the
last time it disclosed a number.  BlackBerry is the biggest spender on research and
development among publicly traded Canadian companies, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg. That makes its employee base
important for the nation’s economy.  ‘Knock-On Effects’  “Even if they aren’t all in  Canada , the knock-on effects
could be significant over the coming months,” said Terrence Connelly, principal at hedge fund Contingent Macro Advisors LLC
in Lafayette,  California .  The inventory writedown, meanwhile, extends a streak of
similar charges. The company took a pretax expense of $485
million in December 2011, a second charge of $267 million the
following March and a third writedown of $335 million in June
2012.  Still, BlackBerry continues to offer new products. Earlier 
this week the company introduced the Z30, a model with the 
company’s largest screen yet. The device goes on sale in the
U.K. and  Middle East  starting next week.  A team of accountants and lawyers from New York-based
PricewaterhouseCoopers have been working at BlackBerry since
August, said people familiar with the process, who asked not to
be identified because the contract hasn’t been made public.  The smartphone maker previously hired Perella Weinberg
Partners LP as an adviser -- alongside its bankers at JPMorgan -
- to help explore its options, a person familiar with the
decision said earlier this month.  Fairfax Financial Holdings Ltd. (FFH) , BlackBerry’s largest
shareholder, has talked to Canadian pension fund managers to try
and build support for a takeover deal, according to a person
with knowledge of the discussions. However, he hasn’t made much
progress, the person said.  “It appears the only option BlackBerry has is to
ultimately sell itself,” said Neeraj Monga, an analyst at
Veritas Investment Research Corp. in Toronto. “But it seems
nobody’s stepping up to the plate.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
