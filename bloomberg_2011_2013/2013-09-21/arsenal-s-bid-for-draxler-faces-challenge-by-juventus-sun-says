Arsenal faces a challenge from
Juventus in its bid to sign Schalke midfielder Julian Draxler,
the Sun reported.  Arsenal began lining up an move for the 20-year-old German
international in 2012 but has yet to make an official approach.
Juventus is willing to pay the 34 million-pounds ($54 million)
buy-out clause on the two-year extension Draxler signed prior to
this season, the Sun said.  Chelsea and  Manchester City  have also had Draxler on their
radar and the midfielder may have to think about going to  Italy 
as he’s said he’d like to play in England or Spain, the Sun
said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
