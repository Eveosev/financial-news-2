A Russian fishing boat was in the
line of shots fired by a North Korean navy ship in the  Sea of
Japan , where it was then detained and searched before continuing
its journey,  Russia ’s Foreign Ministry said.  No one was hurt and the ship was not damaged in the
incident, which took place yesterday, the ministry said in a
 statement  on its website today.  The North Korean navy didn’t try to communicate with the
Russian boat called “Altay” before shooting at the path the
vessel was taking and forcing it to stop, the ministry said. The
navy then boarded and searched the ship and questioned the
captain, according to the statement.  The incident occurred nearly a week after North and  South
Korea  reopened a jointly-run industrial complex in Gaeseong. It
was closed down in April following a nuclear test by  North Korea 
in February and threats against South Korea in March.  Russian ships were detained by North Korea’s navy in 2005,
according to Interfax and in 2008 and 2009, according to the
 state news agency RIA .  To contact the reporter on this story:
