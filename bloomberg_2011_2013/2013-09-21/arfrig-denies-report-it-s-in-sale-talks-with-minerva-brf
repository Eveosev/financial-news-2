Marfrig Alimentos SA (MRFG3) ,  Latin
America ’s second-largest beef producer, denied a report today
that it’s planning to sell assets to  Minerva (BEEF3)  SA and  BRF SA. (BRFS3)   The company isn’t negotiating the sale of Brazilian
operations to Minerva or international holdings to BRF,
according to an e-mailed statement. Veja magazine reported the
talks in its Radar column, without saying where it obtained the
information.  Agencia Ideal, a communications firm that represents
Minerva, said the company doesn’t comment on speculation, while
BRF didn’t immediately respond to e-mails and telephone calls.  Marfrig has been seeking to reduce its debt after it jumped
sevenfold in the past five years to about 10 billion reais ($4.5
billion) as of March 31. In June, the Sao Paulo-based company
 agreed  to sell its Seara poultry-and-pork unit for 5.85 billion
reais. This week, Marfrig bought back $188 million of its bonds
maturing in 2016 after it sold $400 million of 2021 bonds.  Marfrig has  declined  26 percent this year through
yesterday, compared with a 7 percent drop for Minerva and a 34
percent gain for BRF.  The company also denied its debt is about 11 billion reais,
as reported by Veja, saying the amount doesn’t take into account
the sale of the Seara unit.  To contact the reporter on this story:
