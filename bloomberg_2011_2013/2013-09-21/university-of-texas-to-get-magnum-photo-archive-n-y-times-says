A Magnum photo archive of about
200,000 prints will be given to the  University of Texas  at
Austin by  Michael Dell  and two executives from his private
investment firm, the New York Times reported.  Dell, along with Glenn Fuhrman and John Phelan, bought the
rights to the images several years ago when Magnum’s membership
decided to raise money, the Times said. Magnum was founded by
photographers Henri Cartier-Bresson and Robert Capa, among
others.  The images are high-quality copies that appeared in
newspapers and magazines, and is valued at about $200 million,
the newspaper said.  The archive had been on display at the university’s Harry
Ransom Center where it will now be permanently housed, the Times
said. The university announced the gift yesterday.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
