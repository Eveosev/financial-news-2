Former U.K. Prime Minister  Gordon Brown  feared he’d have to use troops to quell panic as the 2008
financial crisis worsened, according to a Daily Mail report,
citing extracts from a book written by one of his advisers.  Brown feared there would be civil disorder if banks shut
and cash machines stopped working, according to the newspaper
 report  today, citing Brown’s media adviser Damian McBride.  “Do we put the army on the streets, how do we get order
back?” Brown asked, the night before his government announced
the part-nationalization of British banks, according to McBride.  The U.K. took stakes in  Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc 
and  Lloyds Banking Group Plc (LLOY)  in October 2008 as fears mounted
about the viability of financial firms beset by debts and bad
assets.  To contact the reporter on this story:
