Iceland faces “headwinds” in
reaching a balanced budget next year as election promises boost
costs and the economy grows less than projected, the
 International Monetary Fund  said.  “The 2013 budget deficit target will be missed owing to
slower than projected growth, expenditure overruns, and lower-than budgeted dividend payments and asset sales,” the IMF said
today in an Article IV and post-program monitoring report. “The
existing target of a balanced budget in 2014 may also come under
pressure from costly electoral promises -- including those to
lower taxes and to increase household debt relief -- the
financing for which remains uncertain.”  The Washington-based IMF reiterated that the island needs
additional cuts or tax increases equal to 1.5 percent of gross
domestic product to achieve a fiscal goal of balance in 2014.  Cuts could be executed in the health and education sectors
“without compromising the quality of outcomes,” it said.  Iceland, which completed a 33-month IMF-led rescue program
two years ago after its 2008 financial collapse, has since
outperformed the euro area in recovering from the crisis. The
IMF last month also closed its local Iceland office, saying the
country’s recovery was “well established.”  Iceland will post a deficit of 2.7 percent this year and
1.8 percent next year and the economy will grow 1.9 percent this
year and 2.1 percent in 2014, the IMF forecast.  To contact the reporter on this story:
