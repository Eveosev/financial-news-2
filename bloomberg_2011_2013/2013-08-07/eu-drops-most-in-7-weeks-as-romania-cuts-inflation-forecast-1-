The leu declined the most in seven
weeks as  Romania ’s central bank lowered its inflation forecast
for the second time this year, fueling speculation the central
bank will keep cutting interest rates.  Romania’s currency depreciated for a second day, losing 0.9
percent to 4.4446 per euro at 5:03 p.m. in Bucharest. That’s
biggest drop since June 19 on a closing basis.  The Banca Nationala a Romaniei forecasts year-end inflation
at 3.1 percent compared with a prediction of 3.2 percent in May,
Governor Mugur Isarescu said today in Bucharest. Policy makers
lowered their main interest rate by 50 basis points to a record
4.50 percent on Aug. 5, more than economists forecast.  The leu declined “as the market starts to price in more
rate cuts on the back of lower forecasted inflation,” Abbas Ameli-Renani, an emerging-market strategist at Royal Bank of
Scotland Group Plc in  London , said by e-mail. While further
easing in rates is likely to weaken the currency in the short
term, “I expect the bulk of this has already happened,” he
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
