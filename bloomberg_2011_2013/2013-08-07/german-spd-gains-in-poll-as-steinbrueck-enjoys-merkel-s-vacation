Germany ’s main opposition  Social
Democratic Party  gained on Chancellor  Angela Merkel ’s bloc in a
Forsa poll as SPD challenger  Peer Steinbrueck  took advantage of
Merkel’s absence on vacation.  Support for the SPD rose a percentage point to 23 percent
with its Green party ally also up a point at 14 percent, the
weekly poll for Hamburg-based Stern magazine and RTL television
showed today. Merkel’s Christian Democratic bloc had 40 percent,
down one point, and her Free Democratic coalition partner held
at 5 percent. The Left Party dropped one point to 7 percent,
Stern said.  As Merkel holidays in the Italian Alps before hitting the
campaign trail next week before the Sept. 22 vote, Steinbrueck
has raised his profile with a television interview, a talk-show
appearance and a TV documentary about his life in the past three
days. All the same, the latest poll would still allow Merkel to
resume her coalition with the FDP, Stern said.  With an “unusually low number” of those who voted SPD at
the 2009 election saying they will do so again -- 57 percent --
the party “has a lot of work still to do” to win them over,
Forsa chief Manfred Guellner was cited by Stern as saying.
“That can only happen if the SPD is able to convince them it
can solve the country’s problems and its choice of personnel is
accepted.”  Forsa polled 3,003 voters between July 29 and Aug. 5. The
results have a margin of error of as much as 2.5 percentage
points.  To contact the reporter on this story:
