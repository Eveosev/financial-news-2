Ibovespa  futures  dropped, after the
equity gauge declined for a third day yesterday, as Banco
Santander SA lowered its forecast for the index, citing slower
economic growth and a weaker currency in  Brazil .  Steelmaker Cia. Siderurgica Nacional SA may be active after
unexpectedly posting a profit for the second quarter, while
card-payment processor  Cielo SA (CIEL3)  reported net income that missed
analysts’ estimates. Oil company  HRT Participacoes em Petroleo
SA  may move as it started drilling its third well off the coast
of  Namibia .  Ibovespa futures contracts expiring this month sank 0.1
percent to 47,120 at 9:22 a.m. in Sao Paulo. The real fell 0.2
percent to 2.3033 per dollar.  Brazil’s gross domestic product will expand 2 percent this
year, down from a previous 3 percent forecast, Santander’s
analysts Daniel Gewehr and Joao Noronha wrote in a report today.
The real will trade from 2.30 per dollar to 2.45 per dollar in
the next two years, they projected.  “Our updated economic forecasts for 2013-15 are negative
for equities,” Santander’s analysts wrote.  The Ibovespa slumped 22 percent this year through
yesterday, wiping out $257 billion from the  value  of Brazilian
stocks, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Brazil’s
benchmark equity gauge trades at 11.6 times analysts’  earnings
estimates  for the next four quarters, compared with 10.2 for the
MSCI  Emerging Markets  Index of 21 developing nations’ equities.  Trading volume in Sao Paulo was 6.43 billion reais
yesterday, compared with a daily average of 7.59 billion reais
this year through Aug. 5, according to data  compiled  by the
exchange.  To contact the reporter on this story:
