Suntech Power Holdings Co. (STP) , the
Chinese solar manufacturer involved in bankruptcy proceedings,
regained compliance with the New York Stock Exchange’s minimum
share-price requirement, allowing it to continued to be traded
on the exchange.  The American depositary receipts of Wuxi, China-based
Suntech averaged at least $1 for the 30-day trading period
ending July 31, the company said today in a statement. Each ADR
is worth one ordinary share.  Suntech fell 5 percent to $1.32 at the close in New York.
It was the world’s largest panel maker by shipments in 2011.  The company’s main operating unit was pulled into
bankruptcy proceedings in  China  in March after Suntech missed a
bond payment. It was warned in September that its ADRs faced
delisting after trading below $1 for 30 consecutive days.  To contact the reporter on this story:
