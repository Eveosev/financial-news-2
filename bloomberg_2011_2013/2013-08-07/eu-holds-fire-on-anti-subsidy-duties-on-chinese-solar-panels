The European Union refrained from
imposing preliminary anti-subsidy tariffs on Chinese solar
panels, opting to wait four more months to assess whether such
levies are warranted in the biggest EU trade fight of its kind.  The European Commission waived the right to introduce
provisional EU duties to counter alleged trade-distorting
government aid to Chinese solar-panel manufacturers. The
commission, the 28-nation EU’s regulatory arm, will study
whether “definitive” anti-subsidy levies should be applied no
later than Dec. 8.  Five days ago, the commission approved an agreement with
 China  to curb EU imports of solar panels as part of a parallel
probe into below-cost sales, a practice known as dumping. The
accord, which took effect yesterday, sets a minimum price and a
volume limit on EU imports of Chinese solar panels until the end
of 2015. Chinese manufacturers that take part are being spared
provisional EU anti-dumping duties as high as 67.9 percent.  “The provisional anti-dumping measures and the price
undertaking on the same products already remove the injury
suffered by the union industry,”  John Clancy , the commission’s
trade spokesman, said in a statement today in Brussels. “The
decision not to impose any provisional anti-subsidy measures
does, however, not prejudge the final outcome of the anti-subsidy investigation. The commission will continue working
actively on the case.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
