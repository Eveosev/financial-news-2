Honda Motor Co. (7267) , Japan’s third-largest automaker, plans to invest 1 billion reais ($435
million) building a second factory in Brazil, two people
familiar with the matter said.  The plant, located in Itirapina, about 200 kilometers (124
miles) northwest of Sao Paolo, will start production of compact
cars from 2015, the people said, confirming an earlier Estado de
S. Paulo report. The people asked not to be identified because
the company hasn’t publicly disclosed the investment.  Brazil, the largest auto market in  Latin America , will
probably see economic expansion accelerate to 2.3 percent this
year and 3.1 percent next year, according to the median of
analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
