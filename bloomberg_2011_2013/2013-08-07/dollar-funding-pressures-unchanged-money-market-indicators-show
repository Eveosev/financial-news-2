Money-market forward indicators
signaled little change in short-term dollar funding conditions.  Three-month London interbank offered rate, or Libor, was
unchanged  at  0.2664 percent, according to the British Bankers’
Association. The Libor-OIS spread, a gauge of banks’ reluctance
to lend, widened to 17.4 basis points from 16.6 basis points.  Overnight index swaps, or OIS, give traders predictions on
what the  Federal Reserve ’s effective funds rate will average for
the term of the swap. The central bank’s target rate is set in a
range of zero to 0.25 percent.  Predictions in the forward market for Libor-OIS, known as
the FRA/OIS spread, was little changed at 18.8 basis points,
according to the second rolling three month contracts.  The difference between the two-year swap rate and the
comparable-maturity Treasury note yield, known as the swap
spread, narrowed 0.15 basis point to 17.55 basis points. The gap
is a gauge of investors’ perceptions of U.S. banking-sector
credit risk as swap rates are derived from expectations for
dollar Libor.  Swap rates serve as benchmarks for investors in many types
of debt, including mortgage-backed and auto-loan securities.  The seasonally adjusted amount of U.S.  commercial paper 
fell $11.2 billion to $984.9 billion in the week ended July 31,
according to Fed data.  Euribor-OIS Spread  The cost for European banks to convert euro-denominated
payment streams into dollars-based funding via the cross
currency swaps market fell to the lowest since May 2011. The
three-month cross-currency basis swap was 8.25 basis points
below Euribor, making the cost to convert euro loans the lowest
since May 4, 2011 when the gauge was 7.63 basis points below
Euribor.  Foreign-exchange swaps are typically for periods of less
than a year, while cross-currency basis swaps usually range from
one to 30 years. The latter are agreements in which a person
borrows in one currency and simultaneously lends in a different
currency. The trade involves the exchange of two different
floating-rate payments, each denominated in a different currency
and based on a different index.  The Euribor-OIS spread, the difference between the euro
interbank offered rate and overnight indexed swaps held
unchanged. The measure of banks’ reluctance to lend to one
another was 12.2 basis points.  Repo Rates  The overnight Treasury general collateral repurchase
agreement rate opened today at 0.08 percent, according to ICAP
Plc, the world’s largest inter-dealer broker.  The  average rate  for borrowing and lending Treasuries for
one day in the repo market was 0.082 percent yesterday,
according to a GCF repo index provided on a one-day lag by the
Depository Trust & Clearing Corp.  Securities dealers use repos to finance holdings and
increase leverage. Securities that can be borrowed at  interest
rates  close to the Fed’s target rate are called general
collateral. Those in highest demand have lower rates and are
called “special.”  The  average rate  for overnight federal funds, known as the
fed effective rate, was 0.09 percent yesterday. The rate opened
today at 0.1 percent. The effective rate is a volume-weighted
average of trades between major brokers for overnight funds,
reported on a day lag by the  Federal Reserve Bank of New York .  To contact the reporter on this story:
