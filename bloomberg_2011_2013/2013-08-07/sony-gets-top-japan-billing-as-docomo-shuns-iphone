NTT DoCoMo Inc. (9437)  will order more  Sony
Corp. (6758)  smartphones as  Japan ’s largest wireless carrier keeps
 Apple Inc. (AAPL) ’s iPhone off its shelves because the iTunes Store
competes with its own e-commerce business.  Sales of Sony’s Xperia A handset could reach 2 million by
Sept. 30 after going on sale in May as DoCoMo focuses on a
smaller range of devices, Chief Financial Officer Kazuto Tsubouchi said in an interview at company headquarters in Tokyo
yesterday.  DoCoMo is trying to spark growth with discounts as it adds
users at a slower pace than  SoftBank Corp. (9984)  and  KDDI Corp. (9433) , which
both sell the iPhone. DoCoMo is reducing the number of models in
its stores by as much as half as its focuses promotions on Sony
and  Samsung Electronics Co. (005930)  handsets, Tsubouchi said.  “To win against the iPhone, we have to offer a model which
is generally easy to use,” Tsubouchi said. “Sony’s brand and
Xperia’s image are just as good as the iPhone.”  DoCoMo may consider altering its stance on the iPhone if it
can limit the smartphone’s share of sales to less than 30
percent of the company’s total, he said. The Japanese carrier’s
online store, called  dmarket , offers music, videos and games.  DoCoMo’s sales of the Xperia A reached about 1.24 million
units as of Aug. 4, and its sales of Samsung’s Galaxy S4 totaled
about 630,000, the company said.  User Growth  The carrier is “fighting back” after restarting cash-back
campaigns to win customers, Nathan Ramler, an analyst at
Macquarie Group Ltd. in  Tokyo , said in a note yesterday. The
company’s promotional campaign “continues to sell handsets.”  Sony fell 1.3 percent to 1,927 yen at the close in Tokyo
trading. The stock has more than doubled this year, compared
with a 33 percent gain by Japan’s benchmark Topix index. DoCoMo
shares fell 1.8 percent.  “We will respond to the needs of the market,” Yu
Tominaga, a spokesman for Sony in Tokyo, said by phone. The
company is targeting a wide range of customers including those
upgrading from feature phones, he said.  Sony posted a quarterly profit in the smartphone business
after losing money a year earlier, the company said Aug. 1.
Smartphone shipments in the three months ending June rose to 9.6
million from 7.4 million a year earlier. Sony expects to sell 42
million smartphones this year.  Adding Subscribers  Reviving earnings growth will depend on DoCoMo’s ability to
add new users as it plans to cut costs by 110 billion yen ($1.1
billion) in the 12 months ending March, the CFO said. While the
company has 45 percent of the Japanese market, compared to 28
percent for second-ranked KDDI, it has the slowest growth among
the top three in adding new users.  NTT DoCoMo added 172,500 users in July, compared with
225,200 at KDDI and 254,500 for third-ranked SoftBank.  The carrier  fell  1.7 percent to 154,400 yen in Tokyo
trading yesterday, paring this year’s gain to 25 percent.
SoftBank has more than doubled this year while KDDI has surged
75 percent.  DoCoMo said July 26 that operating profit fell 5.8 percent
to 247.5 billion yen in the three months ended June 30.  DoCoMo, which has more than 60 million subscribers in a
nation of 127 million people,  forecasts  a 3.9 percent increase
in net income to 510 billion yen this fiscal year and 3.8
percent growth in sales, the company said in a July 26  statement 
on its website. The carrier plans to boost handset sales to 24.5
million from 23.55 million in the year ended March 31, it said.  The company has no plan to withdraw from  India , DoCoMo
President Kaoru Kato said in July. The company has a stake in
 Tata Teleservices Maharashtra Ltd. (TTLS)  in India.  To contact the reporters on this story:
