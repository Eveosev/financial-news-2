Mars Blend and other sour Gulf crudes
weakened relative to West Texas Intermediate as U.S. Gulf Coast
refineries reduced crude consumption to the lowest level in more
than a month.  Crude runs in PADD 3  fell by 42,000 barrels to 8.34 million
barrels a day in the week ended Aug. 2, the U.S. Energy
Information Administration reported today. It was the lowest
level since June 21.  Mars Blend, a medium-sour crude from the Gulf of Mexico,
weakened by 30 cents to a premium of 25 cents a barrel compared
with WTI in Cushing,  Oklahoma , at 2:01 p.m.  New York  time.  Mars Blend is a combination of crudes from  Royal Dutch
Shell Plc (RDSA) ’s Ursa, Mensa and Mars platforms, along with crude
from the Amberjack pipeline. Shell delivered 289,562 barrels a
day in March to Louisiana Offshore Oil Port LLC’s storage
facility in Clovelly, Louisiana, according to its  website .  Poseidon crude weakened by 40 cents to a discount of 10
cents a barrel to WTI. Crude from the Southern Green Canyon
weakened by 40 cents to a 60-cents discount. Heavy Louisiana
Sweet weakened by 10 cents to $4.90 a barrel more than WTI.  Light Louisiana Sweet, the light, sweet benchmark on the
Gulf, strengthened by 5 cents to a $5.45-a-barrel premium to
WTI. Thunder Horse, a medium, sweet crude, was unchanged at a
$3-a-barrel premium.  To contact the reporter on this story:
