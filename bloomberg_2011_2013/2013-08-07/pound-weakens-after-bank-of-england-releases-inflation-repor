The pound weakened against the dollar
after the  Bank of England  published its quarterly economic
forecasts and a review of using forward guidance as a policy
tool. Gilts were little changed.  Britain’s currency declined versus all its 16 major peers
as Governor  Mark Carney  began a press conference in London.
Sterling reached a one-week high versus the dollar yesterday
amid speculation the U.K. economy is gathering pace. Reports in
the past week showed that manufacturing, construction and
services all improved in July.  Assuming the central bank advocates some sort of forward
guidance “the immediate reaction would be to sell sterling,”
UBS AG currency strategists Shahab Jalinoos and  Geoffrey Yu 
wrote in a note to clients yesterday.  The pound fell 0.2 percent to $1.5697 at 10:32 a.m. London
time and dropped 0.7 percent to 87.25 pence per euro.  The yield on the benchmark 10-year gilt fell one basis
point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 2.47 percent. The 1.75
percent security due in September 2022 rose 0.1, or 1 pound per
1,000-pound face amount, to 94.21.  Carney has already taken steps to curb higher market rates,
saying at the central bank’s July policy meeting that the
“implied rise in the expected future path of Bank rate was not
warranted” by economic developments. He introduced forward
guidance in April 2009 when he was governor of the  Bank of
Canada .  To contact the reporter on this story:
