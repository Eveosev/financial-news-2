Germany ’s average charge of 5.34
euros ($7.10) per cubic meter of drinking and waste water lags
only Denmark’s 6.19 euros in Europe, Handelsblatt says, citing
information from NUS Consulting.  The city of Potsdam has Germany’s highest water costs, at
6.28 euros per cubic meter, the newspaper reported. Germans have
reduced their daily water useage per head by 18 percent to 121
liters (31.9 gallons) since 1990, it said.  The charges, maintained by public authorities who control
92 percent of Germany’s water market, are driving private
operators out of the market,  Suez Environnement Co (SEV)  Chief
Executive Officer Jean-Marc Boursier told the newspaper.  The French company no longer has operations in Germany as a
result, he is cited as saying. Competitor Veolia Enivironnement
SA plans to sell its 25 percent stake in water operations to the
city. Berlin’s finance senator Ulrich Nussbaum was in Paris
yesterday to negotiate the sale, Handelsblatt said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
