Swiss  consumer prices  unexpectedly
remained unchanged in July, snapping 21 months of declines.  Prices held steady from a year earlier after dropping 0.1
percent in June, the  Federal Statistics Office  in Neuchatel said
in an e-mailed statement today. Economists expected an annual
decline of 0.1 percent, according to the median of 15 estimates
in a Bloomberg News  survey .  The  Swiss National Bank (SNBN)  imposed a franc ceiling of 1.20
versus the euro in September 2011 to fight deflation threats.
Even so, consumer prices continued to drop and before last month
were in their longest stretch since at least 1971, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  The SNB, headed by President Thomas Jordan, expects
consumer prices to fall 0.3 percent in 2013.  The cost of imported  consumer goods  fell 1.2 percent from a
year earlier and decreased 1.4 percent from June, today’s report
showed. Prices of domestic goods climbed 0.4 percent on the year
and were unchanged on the month.  Under a European Union harmonized method, Swiss consumer
prices rose 0.5 percent from a year earlier and were unchanged
on a monthly basis.  To contact the reporter on this story:
