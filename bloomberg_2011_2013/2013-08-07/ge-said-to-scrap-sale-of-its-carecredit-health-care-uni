General Electric Co. (GE)  is scrapping the
sale of its CareCredit health-care financing business after
offers failed to meet its expectations, according to a person
with knowledge of the matter.  The person asked not to be named as the deliberations are
private. Fairfield, Connecticut-based GE was working with
Goldman Sachs Group Inc. on the sale of the unit, people
familiar with the matter said in June. Those people said the
division could fetch $1 billion.  CareCredit, part of the company’s GE Capital division, is
the largest issuer of consumer health-care financing in the
U.S., according to the New York Attorney General’s office. GE
Chief Executive Officer  Jeffrey Immelt  has been focused on
shrinking GE Capital, as the unit faces heightened regulatory
scrutiny from the Federal Reserve, which identified it as a
potential risk to the financial system.  Susan Bishop, a spokeswoman for GE Capital declined to
comment on the decision to cancel the sale, as did  Andrew Williams , a spokesman for Goldman Sachs.  To contact the reporters on this story:
