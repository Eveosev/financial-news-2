Vestas Wind Systems A/S (VWS)  fell to its
lowest price in a week in Copenhagen trading as some investors
cashed in on recent share gains amid news the turbine maker is
facing a lawsuit.  Vestas fell as much as 6 percent to 110 kroner, the lowest
since July 31. The stock also traded at that price at 9:13 a.m.
local time with volume at 48 percent of the three-month daily
average. The drop made the share today’s biggest loser in the
Nasdaq OMX Copenhagen 20 index.  Vestas shares have more than tripled in value this year as
an inflow of new orders has boosted investor confidence that
profits will return at the Aarhus, Denmark-based producer.
Vestas said yesterday that Deminor International may claim about
300 million kroner ($53 million) in a lawsuit on behalf of some
investors who alleged a change in accounting policy hurt the
share price. Vestas denies any wrong-doing.  “After a strong run in the share we foresee that some
investors will use this noise around the company to take some
profit in the share,” Patrik Setterberg, a Copenhagen-based
analyst with Nordea Markets, said today in a note to clients.
“We believe Vestas has good arguments in order to win this
lawsuit and see the risk of losing this case as limited.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
