Venoco Inc. and Viking Cruises Ltd.
are offering a total of $400 million of bonds in separate
transactions that allow them to pay interest with extra debt.  Oil- and gas-exploration company Venoco may issue $250
million of so-called payment-in-kind toggle notes due 2018
through its Denver Parent Corp., according to a person with
knowledge of the transaction who asked not to be identified
because terms aren’t set.  Proceeds will be used to redeem debt and fund a  tender
offer  for the Denver-based company’s $150 million of 11.5
percent securities due October 2017. Citigroup Inc. and Bank of
America Corp. are managing the sale, which may close on Aug. 9.  Los Angeles-based Viking, which operates cruises on rivers
from Europe to  Asia , may issue $150 million of five-year PIK
toggle bonds through MISA Investments Ltd., according to a
person with knowledge of that transaction. Proceeds from the
sale, which may be completed as soon as today, will be used to
fund a payment to equity holders, the person said.  Wells Fargo & Co ., Credit Suisse Group AG and Bank of
America are managing that sale, the person said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
