Cia. Siderurgica Nacional SA (SID) , the
third-biggest Brazilian steelmaker, led gains in the country’s
benchmark stock index after reporting better-than-expected
profit.  Shares of the company known as CSN  jumped  6.3 percent to
6.89 reais at 11:19 a.m. in Sao Paulo, heading to its highest
close since July 29. The stock, which traded at 79 percent of
its three-month daily average volume, was the best performer on
 Brazil ’s Ibovespa index today.  CSN posted late yesterday second-quarter adjusted  net
income  of 494.5 million reais ($214.8 million),  beating  the 97.2
million reais average adjusted net loss estimated in a Bloomberg
survey. Increased margins in the company’s steel division
boosted profit above expectation, Brasil Plural CCTVM analysts
led by Renato Antunes said in a note to clients.  “Almost unscathed and significantly above consensus, CSN
rode out second quarter with a positive performance in both
steel and iron ore,” the analysts said yesterday. “The slight
decrease of off balance-sheet tax liabilities is welcomed.”  (CSN is hosting a conference call with investors today that
started at 10 a.m.  New York  time.)  To contact the reporter on this story:
