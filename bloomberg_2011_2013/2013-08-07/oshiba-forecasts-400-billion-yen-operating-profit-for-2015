Toshiba Corp. (6502) , the Japanese maker of
products from flash-memory chips to steam turbines, forecast a
2015 operating profit more than 50 percent above its 2013
estimate as it shifts to focus on energy and semiconductors.  Operating profit may rise to 400 billion yen ($4.1 billion)
for the year ending March 2016 from an estimated  260 billion yen 
this fiscal year, the Tokyo-based company said in a statement
today. The company forecast 2015 sales of 7 trillion yen.  President Hisao Tanaka plans to boost production of flash
memory chips and speed up expansion abroad with its energy
operations. The company is reorganizing its television business
after the  division  lost about 100 billion yen in the past two
years, hurt by competition from other makers including Samsung
Electronics Co.  Toshiba  fell  3 percent to 417 yen in Tokyo trading, as of
2:16 p.m. The stock has risen 23 percent this year, compared
with a 34 percent gain for  Japan â€™s benchmark Nikkei 225 Stock
Average.  To contact the reporter on this story:
