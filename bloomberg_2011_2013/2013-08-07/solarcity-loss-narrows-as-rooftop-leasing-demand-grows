  SolarCity Corp. (SCTY) , the second-largest
U.S. solar company by market value, reported a narrower second-quarter loss as demand for rooftop power systems surged 71
percent.  The company installed 53 megawatts of panels in the
quarter, up from 31 megawatts a year earlier. The net loss
shrank to $23.9 million, or 31 cents a share, from $25.8
million, or $2.37, a year earlier, San Mateo, California-based
SolarCity said today in a statement. Excluding one-time items,
the loss was 4 cents more than the 39-cent average of five
analysts’ estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  The company hasn’t reported a profit since its December
initial public offering and Chief Executive Officer  Lyndon Rive 
is boosting investment in new projects that he expects will
deliver long-term revenue.  “We remain confident we’ll deploy 270 megawatts in 2013
and be  cash flow  positive in Q4,” Rive said today on a
conference call with analysts.  SolarCity invested $158 million to install solar systems in
the quarter, compared with $138.2 million in the prior quarter.
The company installs power systems typically at little to no
upfront cost for customers, who sign decades-long contracts to
purchase the power.  Revenue slipped to $37.9 million from $46.6 million a year
earlier as the company focused on solar leases and shifted away
from selling rooftop systems to customers who paid upfront for
the projects.  The company expects to install 70 megawatts to 77 megawatts
of panels in the current quarter and a total of 270 megawatts of
panels this year.  First Solar Inc. (FSLR)  is the largest U.S. solar company.  To contact the reporter on this story:
