Brenntag AG (BNR) , the world’s largest
distributor of chemicals, forecast annual earnings below
analysts’ estimates as global economic uncertainties persist.  Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization
and one-time items will rise to 710 million euros ($945 million)
to 735 million euros this year, the company said in a statement
today. Analysts had predicted 742.6 million euros on average,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Brenntag, based in Muelheim an der Ruhr,  Germany , reported
second-quarter profit and sales that missed analyst estimates,
saying that market conditions are “challenging.” Earnings in
Europe were hurt by an antitrust fine in  France  for which the
company set aside 17 million euros, it said today.  “We do not see the promise of any significant improvement
in the macroeconomic environment but we remain positive and
confident about the underlying market opportunities,” Chief
Executive Officer Steven Holland said in today’s statement.  Operating Ebitda fell 8.3 percent to 169.1 million euros in
the quarter, missing a 186.4 million-euro analyst estimate.
Sales rose 2.2 percent to 2.54 billion euros, also lagging
behind the average estimate of 2.58 billion euros. Net income
declined 15 percent to 68.7 million euros.  To contact the reporter on this story:
