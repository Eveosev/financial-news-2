IGIS Asset Management Co. bought the
Twin Tree Towers in Seoul for $316 million from KTB Asset
Management Co., making it the second-largest transaction in the
South Korean capital in the first half, according to the seller.  Savills Plc (SVS) , which brokered the deal and made the
announcement on behalf of KTB Asset, said it will offer to find
new companies to lease space if the largest tenant moves out of
the three-year-old prime office building, according to an e-mailed statement today.  South Korea ’s worst property-mark slowdown since 2004
threatens to limit the economy’s rebound and the government’s
stop-go policies to stimulate the housing market have failed to
secure any sustained revival. Injecting life into the real-estate market was a key goal for President Park Geun Hye when
she took office in February, introducing tax breaks on April 1
to spur demand and supply-control measures to support prices.  Seoul  prime office buildings posted a 1.2 percent rental
increase in the June quarter from a year ago while prime office
vacancy rose 1 percentage point to 10.7 percent, according to a
separate Savills report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
