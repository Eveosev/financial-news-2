Five former employees of  Bernard Madoff , scheduled to go on trial in October for allegedly
helping the convicted con man carry off the largest  Ponzi scheme 
in U.S. history, are seeking a two-month postponement.  U.S. District Judge Laura Taylor Swain in Manhattan set an
Oct. 7 trial date for the fraud case against Daniel Bonventre,
Annette Bongiorno, Joann Crupi, Jerome O’Hara and  George Perez .
The defendants, who have all pleaded not guilty, are charged
with crimes including conspiracy, fraud and falsifying records.  Perez’s lawyer, Larry Krantz, said in a letter today that a
revised indictment filed by the government on July 29 “contains
a wholesale re-writing” of the previous one and includes
additional allegations. Krantz said he was making the request on
behalf of all five defendants.  “They present an entirely different spin on many of the
core facts and introduce a wealth of entirely new allegations,”
Krantz said. “We also seek a 60-day adjournment of the trial
date, so that we have adequate time for trial preparation.”  Federal prosecutors have obtained guilty pleas from Madoff
and his brother  Peter Madoff , who helped him run the firm for
four decades, and seven former employees. Bernard Madoff is
serving a 150-year sentence in federal prison in North Carolina
while Peter Madoff was sentenced to 10 years in prison.  The case is U.S. v. O’Hara, 10-cr-00228, U.S. District
Court, Southern District of  New York  (Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
