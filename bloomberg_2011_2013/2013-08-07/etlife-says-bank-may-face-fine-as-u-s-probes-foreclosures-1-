MetLife Inc. (MET) , the largest U.S. life
insurer, said it may face fines amid a government review of
foreclosures at its bank unit.  The bank received a request in May from the U.S. Department
of Justice for information on payments the lender made to law
firms tied to foreclosures, the New York-based insurer said in a
filing today. Expenses were submitted to  Fannie Mae , Freddie Mac
and the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development for
reimbursement, according to the filing.  “It is possible that various state or federal regulatory
and law enforcement authorities may seek monetary penalties from
MetLife Bank relating to foreclosure practices,” the insurer
said in the filing.  The probe adds to U.S. scrutiny of a business that MetLife
has been exiting as it seeks to focus on insurance and
retirement products. The company said last year that the Justice
Department, led by Attorney General Eric Holder, made a civil
investigative demand in a review of mortgages insured by the
 Federal Housing Administration .  John Calagna , a spokesman for MetLife, declined to comment.  To contact the reporters on this story:
