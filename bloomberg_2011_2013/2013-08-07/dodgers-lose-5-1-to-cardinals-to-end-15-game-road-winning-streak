The Los Angeles Dodgers lost 5-1 to
the St. Louis Cardinals to end their road winning streak at 15
games.  The Dodgers are the first National League team to win 15
consecutive road games since the 1957 Cincinnati Redlegs. The
1984 Detroit Tigers and 1916  New York  Giants share the Major
League Baseball record of 17 road victories in a row.  Joe Kelly (3-3) allowed one run on six hits and struck out
one in 5 1/3 innings for the Cardinals, who got home runs from
Carlos Beltran and Matt Adams at Busch Stadium in St. Louis.  Clayton Kershaw (10-7) gave up two runs on six hits and
struck out five in six innings for the Dodgers (62-50), who lead
the NL West, 5 1/2 games ahead of the  Arizona  Diamondbacks.  To contact the reporter on this story:
