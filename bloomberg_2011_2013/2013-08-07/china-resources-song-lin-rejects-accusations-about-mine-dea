China  Resources Holding Co. Chairman
Song Lin rejected as “false” allegations in the media that
described a 2010 coal-mining deal as “inappropriate,” saying
he reserves the right to pursue libel action.  The purchase was normal business practice and complied with
China’s laws and regulations, according to a signed  letter  from
Song posted on the company’s website yesterday. The transaction
also met rules governing publicly traded companies in Hong Kong,
he said.  Song’s letter is in response to a controversy last month
over the acquisition by  China Resources Power Holdings Co. (836)  of
three coal mines in Shanxi province. The company, a Hong Kong-listed unit of Song’s company, on July 18 denied allegations by
Xinhua News Agency reporter Wang Wenzhi that it had deliberately
overpaid for the acquisition.  The company paid a fair price for the assets after getting
two independent assessments, it said last month. The deal wasn’t
made public because its equity interest was below the disclosure
threshold, China Resources said.  Li Jianjun, a former investigative reporter from Shanxi,
presented Hong Kong’s anti-graft agency with evidence of alleged
wrongdoings by Song, the South China Morning Post and Standard
reported, citing Li.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
