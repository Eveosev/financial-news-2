Rwanda  may leave its key lending rate
unchanged at a policy meeting scheduled for next month in order
to balance spurring economic growth with containing inflation,
central bank Governor John Rwangombwa said.  “The liquidity in the banking sector is within the desired
level consistent with the financial needs of the economy and the
monetary inflationary pressures are limited,” Rwangombwa said
yesterday in an interview in the capital, Kigali.  Rwanda’s monetary policy makers in June cut the key lending
rate by 50 basis points, or half a percentage point, to 7
percent to support the economy. Growth is forecast by the
government to slow to 7.5 percent this year from 8 percent in
2012. The rate of inflation may increase in July and August
before falling to below 7.5 percent by the end of December,
Rwangombwa said. Consumer prices rose to 3.7 percent in June.  In May, the country raised $400 million in a debut sale of
Eurobonds to finance construction of infrastructure. The sale
has helped boost foreign-currency reserves, supporting the
franc. The currency may appreciate against the dollar this month
and next, Rwangombwa said.  “We expect the currency to gain in August and September,”
he said.  The franc declined 1 percent to 648.3 per dollar by 2:47
p.m. in Kigali, bringing it losses since the start of the year
to 2.7 percent.  Rwanda is rated B with a stable outlook by both Standard
Poor’s and Fitch Ratings, five levels below investment grade.  To contact the reporter on this story:
