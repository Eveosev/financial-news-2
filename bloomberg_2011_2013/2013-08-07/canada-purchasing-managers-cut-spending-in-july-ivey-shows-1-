Canada’s purchasing managers reduced
spending in July for the first time this year, according to a
 gauge  released today by Western University’s business school.  The Ivey Purchasing Managers  Index (IVEYSA)  fell to 48.4 in July on
a seasonally adjusted basis, the lowest since November,
following a June reading of 55.3, according to a statement on
the university’s website. Readings of more than 50 indicate
purchasing by governments and companies increased.  Weaker output by the nation’s oil and gas producers in
recent months, along with the impact of flooding in  Alberta , a
construction strike last month and concerns that the global
market for potash may deteriorate suggest the economy will
struggle to match its 2.5 percent first-quarter  gain  over the
rest of the year.  The Ivey Employment Index was little changed in July at
50.4, while a gauge of inventories rose to 53.3, from 51.6 in
June, according to the release.  A gauge of prices fell to 52.8 last month, the lowest since
May 2009, from 59 in June. The supplier deliveries  index  dropped
to 38.9 in July from 39.8 the month before.  To contact the reporter on this story:
