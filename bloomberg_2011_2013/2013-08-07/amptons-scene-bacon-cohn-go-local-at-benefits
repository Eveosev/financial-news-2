In Southampton on Saturday night, Martin Gruss, senior partner at Gruss Investments LLC, and  Wilbur Ross , chairman of WL Ross & Co., attended the Southampton Hospital Gala, which raised $1.7 million, according to a statement from the hospital.  On Sunday, the Peconic Land Trust paid tribute to the conservation work of  Louis Bacon , founder of Moore Capital Management LLC, who made the trust’s largest easement gift protecting the 540-acre Cow Neck, and who owns Robins Island in Peconic Bay.  The luncheon took place at the Port of Missing Men in Southampton, a hunting estate on Scallop Pond designed by John Russell Pope -- architect of the National Gallery of Art and the Jefferson Memorial in  Washington , D.C. -- and built in the 1920s by Colonel Henry H. Rogers.  Rogers bequeathed the estate to his grandson Peter Salm, who was steward of its buildings, wetlands, farm fields, meadows and allee of linden trees until his death in 1994. Salm’s family, who still owns the estate, was also honored by the Trust.  The meal had a local focus, with cheeses from Mecox Bay Farm, Long Island littleneck clams, Crescent duck confit and Early Girl Farm tomatoes. Dessert: Tate’s Bake Shop blueberry crumb cake and gluten-free brownies.  Hayground School  Gary Cohn , president of Goldman Sachs Group Inc., has had an outpost in the Hamptons for 21 years. He makes a point of attending the fundraiser for the progressive Hayground School in Bridgehampton.  “It makes us feel like part of the local community,” said his wife, Lisa Pevaroff-Cohn, an artist.  The Cohns are part of the Hayground family. Their daughters went to Hayground Camp when it was held under a tent in Water Mill. When the school opened, the couple began recommending it to friends, including a family displaced from their downtown Manhattan home after September 11.  Pevaroff-Cohn donates work for the auction. This year it was a LaPev moonstone bracelet with charms including an evil eye with diamonds and sapphire and a rhodium-silver skull with white sapphire eyes.  Nick & Toni’s  Dozens of chefs donate their time and dishes in memory of Jeff Salaway, a founder of the school who died in 2001. This year’s event on July 28 included a dinner at the home of Salaway’s widow, Toni Ross, with whom he opened the restaurant Nick & Toni’s.  “The cheese from the cheese shop in Sag Harbor was the best I ever tasted,” Pevaroff-Cohn said of Cavaniola’s selections, among them aged goat from Holland and mold-ripened sheep milk from the French Pyrenees.  Another highlight: “The first course, the oysters, were incredible,” Pevaroff-Cohn said. Chef Kerry Heffernan served raw Fishers Island oysters with three mignonettes, featuring cucumber, wild chamomile and garlic scape kimchi.
