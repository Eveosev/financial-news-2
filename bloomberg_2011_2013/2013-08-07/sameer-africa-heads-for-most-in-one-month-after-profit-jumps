Sameer Africa Ltd., a Kenyan tire
maker, headed for the biggest gain in a month after saying
profit from operations more than tripled as tax expenses
dropped.  The stock climbed 3 percent to 5.15 shillings by 2 p.m. in
the capital, the largest gain on a closing basis since July 2.
Almost 69 percent of the three-month daily average of shares
were traded.  Profit from operations jumped to 303 million shillings
($3.5 million) in the six months through June from 88 million
shillings a year earlier, the company said in an e-mailed
statement yesterday. Income-tax expenses narrowed to 13.3
million shillings from 41.9 million shillings.  Profit was “helped by an increase in other operating
income and a decline in tax liability,” Nairobi-based Standard
Investment Bank Ltd. said today in an e-mailed note to clients.  Sameer surged 24 percent this year, while the FTSE-NSE 25
Share Index gained 29 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
