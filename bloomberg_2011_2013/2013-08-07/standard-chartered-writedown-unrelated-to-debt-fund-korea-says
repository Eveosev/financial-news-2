Standard Chartered Plc (STAN) ’s $1 billion
writedown of its Korean business is unrelated to a fund set up
in March by the South Korean government to help low-income
borrowers, the nation’s financial regulator said.  No actual loss was incurred at the London-based bank’s
Standard Chartered Korea unit during the first half because of
the so-called National Happiness Fund and impairment of goodwill
charges at the lender aren’t related to the program, the
Financial Services Commission said in an e-mailed statement
today.  The bank is reviewing various options to improve operations
including selling its savings bank unit and consumer finance
unit, Choi Ki Hoon, a Seoul-based spokesman at the Korean
subsidiary said in a phone interview in Seoul.  South Korea  said in March it will start a 1.5 trillion-won
fund over five years to help low-income borrowers restructure
defaulted loans as part of President Park Geun Hye’s promise to
ease consumer debt burdens. The bank said yesterday its first-half profit dropped 24 percent to $2.18 billion from a year
earlier after writing down the value of its Korean businesses by
$1 billion.  South Korea is the bank’s “most difficult market” and its
Korean unit posted a 5 percent decline in income and a sharp
rise in loan impairment, driven by the government-sponsored
personal debt rehabilitation plan, the U.K. lender said
yesterday.  The Seoul-based unit said in an e-mailed statement that the
goodwill impairment isn’t related to the National Happiness
Fund.  To contact the reporter on this story:
