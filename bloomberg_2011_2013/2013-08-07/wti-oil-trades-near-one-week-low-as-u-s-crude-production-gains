West Texas Intermediate crude swung
between gains and losses as  China , the world’s second-biggest
oil consumer, increased imports to a record in July.  Futures fluctuated in  New York  after slipping for a fourth
day yesterday. China bought a net 25.9 million metric tons of
oil, or 6.13 million barrels a day last month, according to
government data. Purchases of the fuel are 13 percent higher
than in June. WTI fell yesterday after a report from the Energy
Information Administration showed U.S. gasoline supplies rose,
while  crude inventories  fell.  “Crude demand from China has remained relatively robust,”
said  David Lennox , a resource analyst at Fat Prophets in Sydney.
“The EIA numbers were a little mixed. Good numbers from China
will at least stop the crude price from falling.”  WTI for September delivery was at $104.58 a barrel, up 21
cents in electronic trading on the  New York Mercantile Exchange 
at 4:46 p.m. Sydney time. The volume of all futures traded was 7
percent below the 100-day average. The contract decreased 93
cents to $104.37 yesterday, the lowest since July 30.  Brent for September settlement rose 8 cents to $107.52 a
barrel on the London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange. The
European benchmark was at a premium of $2.94 to WTI, compared
with $3.07 yesterday.  China Imports  Total exports from China rose 5.1 percent last month,
figures from the General Administration of Customs in Beijing
show. They were projected to gain by 2 percent, according to a
Bloomberg survey. Imports climbed 10.9 percent, compared with a
forecast 1 percent increase in the survey.  China was the second-biggest oil consumer last year,
accounting for about 11 percent of global demand, compared with
21 percent for the U.S., according to  BP Plc (BP/) ’s Statistical
Review of World Energy.  U.S.  gasoline inventories  climbed by 135,000 barrels last
week, said the EIA, the Energy Department’s statistical arm.
They were projected to fall by 500,000 barrels, according to the
median estimate of 11 analyst estimates in a Bloomberg News
survey. Distillate supplies, a category that includes heating
oil and diesel, increased by 469,000 barrels, compared with a
forecast of no change in the survey.  Gasoline for September delivery fell 4.4 cents to $2.8711 a
gallon yesterday on the New York Mercantile Exchange, the lowest
settlement since July 3. Prices were at $2.8795 today.  Cushing Supplies  Refineries  operated  at an average 90.9 percent of capacity,
down 0.4 percentage point from the prior week, according to the
EIA. U.S. motor-fuel demand typically rises from the last
weekend in May through Labor Day in early September, the
nation’s peak vacation season.  Crude inventories fell by 1.3 million barrels to 363.3
million barrels, according to EIA data. They were projected to
decline by 1.5 million barrels, the survey shows.  Supplies at Cushing,  Oklahoma , the delivery point for New
York futures and the largest oil storage hub in the U.S., fell
by 2.2 million barrels last week to 39.9 million barrels, the
EIA said. It’s the lowest level since March 2012 and the fifth
week of declines.  To contact the reporter on this story:
