after Chinese trade data beat estimates and companies from

higher and Australia’s dollar gained against all 16 major peers.  The Euro Stoxx 50 Index climbed 0.4 percent at 7:18 a.m. in

0.2 percent. Copper rallied 1.7 percent, heading for its highest
close in seven weeks. The Aussie strengthened 0.9 percent. The

and it’s likely to end the year at 7.5 percent,” Ronald Chan, a
