Fraport AG, the operator of Frankfurt
airport, said its forecast for 2013 is becoming increasingly
challenging to meet after passenger numbers at  Europe ’s third-largest hub fell.  Fraport is “operating in an ever more challenging
environment,” making financial goals for this year
“increasingly demanding,” Chief Executive Officer Stefan Schulte said in a statement today.  The company reiterated its forecast that earnings before
interest and taxes, depreciation and amortization this year will
total 870 million euros ($1.16 billion) to 890 million euros,
while net income will fall. Second-quarter Ebitda rose 11
percent from a year earlier to 243.5 million euros, beating the
average 240.1 million euros of seven analyst  estimates  estimates
compiled by Bloomberg.  Airlines in Europe are cutting flights and switching to
bigger planes in an effort to stem losses amid competition from
low-cost carriers and Persian Gulf airlines. Passenger numbers
in  Frankfurt  fell 1 percent in the first half, meaning a
turnaround is needed for Fraport to reach a goal of matching
last year’s traffic figure.  Net retail sales per passenger rose 10 percent to 3.56
euros in the first six months. Fraport has said it plans to
increase the measure toward 4 euros this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
