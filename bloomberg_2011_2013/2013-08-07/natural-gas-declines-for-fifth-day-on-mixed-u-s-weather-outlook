Natural gas declined a fifth day in
 New York  after trading at the lowest in more than five months.  Futures for September delivery fell as much as 0.8 percent
to $3.292 per million British thermal units in electronic
trading on the  New York Mercantile Exchange  and were at $3.299
at 10:32 a.m. Singapore time. The contract closed at $3.318
yesterday, the lowest settlement since Feb. 22.  The U.S. Northeast and the Midwest will see milder
temperatures than normal through Aug. 20 while most of  Texas 
will be warmer, according to Commodity Weather Group LLC
predictions. Gas has tumbled 26 percent from a 21-month high on
May 1 as moderate summer heat contributed to unusually large
U.S. stockpile gains.  The high in Dallas on Aug. 19 may be 102 degrees Fahrenheit
(39 Celsius), 5 more than average, according to AccuWeather Inc.
in  State College , Pennsylvania.  “Texas is the only show in town for exceptional heat,”
 Matt Rogers , the president of Bethesda, Maryland-based CWG, said
yesterday in a note. Temperatures in the Northeast and Midwest
may be 3 to 5 degrees below normal from Aug. 11 to Aug. 20, he
said.  Texas was the largest consumer of natural gas for
generating electricity during the first five months of 2013,
accounting for 17 percent of U.S. demand, according to the
Energy Information Administration. Electricity generators, the
largest users of U.S. gas, will account for 32 percent of gas
demand this year, EIA data show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
