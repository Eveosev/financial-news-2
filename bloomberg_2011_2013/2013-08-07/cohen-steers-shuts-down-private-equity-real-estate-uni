Cohen & Steers Inc. (CNS) , a New York-based
asset manager specializing in publicly traded property
companies, is shutting down its private-equity real estate
division, according to an e-mail from the head of the unit.  “The firm has decided to no longer be active in the
private-equity real estate space,” Steve Coyle, chief
investment officer of the firm’s Global Realty Partners unit,
wrote yesterday. “As a result, my team and I will depart the
firm effective this Friday.”  Coyle joined Cohen & Steers in 2008 from Citigroup Inc.,
where he was chief investment strategist of a property division.
At Cohen & Steers, he raised money to invest with other real
estate fund managers. The company, founded in 1986 by Martin Cohen and Robert Steers, had $47.8 billion of assets under
management as of June 30.  Matthew Stadler, chief financial officer at Cohen & Steers,
didn’t return a telephone call placed after regular business
hours yesterday seeking comment on the unit shutting.  To contact the reporter on this story:
