General Motors Co. (GM)  said the United
Auto Workers Retiree Medical Benefits Trust will sell $171
million worth of warrants to purchase GM common shares.  The trust offered 45.5 million warrants that let the holder
purchase one share of GM at $42.31 a share, subject to some
adjustments. The warrants were priced at $3.85 apiece through a
modified Dutch auction, Detroit-based GM said today in a
statement. GM slid 1.3 percent to $35.48 at the close in  New
York .  The UAW health-care trust pays for medical coverage for
union retirees. The trust is selling the warrants after GM has
surged 25 percent this year, exceeding the 19 percent gain for
the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index. The trust is the  second-largest
GM shareholder  with 140.2 million shares, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. GM won’t receive any proceeds from the
offering.  Governments that helped pay for the automaker’s 2009
restructuring in bankruptcy are also selling shares.  Canada ’s
government has begun a search for investment banks to sell its
stake in GM, a person familiar with the matter said last week.
The U.S., GM’s largest shareholder, has said it will shed its
 stake  by the end of 2014’s first quarter.  The UAW’s warrants have been listed for trading on the New
York Stock Exchange, beginning today at 9:30 a.m., GM said. The
sales may close on or about Aug. 12, and Deutsche Bank AG is the
the sole book-running manager for the offering, GM said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
