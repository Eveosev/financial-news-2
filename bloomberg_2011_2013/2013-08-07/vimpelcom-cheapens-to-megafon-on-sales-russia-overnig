VimpelCom Ltd. (VIP) , the wireless carrier
owned by Russian billionaire  Mikhail Fridman  and  Telenor ASA (TEL) ,
fell in  New York  and approached the biggest discount to rival
OAO MegaFon as operations abroad ebb revenue growth.  American depositary receipts of Amsterdam-based VimpelCom
dropped 1 percent to $9.88 yesterday, widening its discount to
Moscow-based MegaFon to 32 percent. The gap reached a record 35
percent on July 9, according to data compiled by Bloomberg based
on estimated earnings. The Bloomberg Russia-US Equity Index
slumped 1.3 percent yesterday, while RTS stock-index futures
were little changed at 130,150 in New York hours.  VimpelCom, Russia’s third-largest mobile provider, posted a
2 percent drop in second-quarter earnings to $2.43 billion
today, missing the average analyst estimate of $2.45 billion.
The company, which got 39 percent of sales from  Russia  in 2012,
is working to reduce $28.6 billion of debt resulting from the
acquisition of telecommunications assets in  Italy  and Algeria.
Most of MegaFon’s sales come solely from Russia, where economic
growth is expected to accelerate in the second half of the year.  “While MegaFon remains focused on Russia and benefits from
economic growth in the country, VimpelCom’s strategy is
unclear,” Evgeny Golosnoy, an analyst at IFC Metropol, said by
phone from Moscow yesterday. “When you invest in VimpelCom you
expose yourself to its debt risk, as well as unconvincing
geography of its business.”  Estimated Earnings  VimpelCom tumbled 21 percent since reaching this year’s
high on Feb. 11 to trade at 8.2 times estimated earnings,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. MegaFon, which has a
valuation of 12, slid 0.9 percent to $30.90 in London yesterday.  The  Micex Index (INDEXCF)  sank 0.4 percent to 1,359.75 by 10:54 a.m.
in Moscow. The ruble was little changed at 37.8869 against the
dollar-euro basket used by the central bank to manage swings
that erode exporter competitiveness. Non-deliverable forwards,
which provide a guide to expectations of currency movements,
showed the ruble at 33.1566 per dollar in three months.  VimpelCom’s earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation
and amortization narrowed to 42.4 percent of sales from 43.2
percent, the company said in today’s statement. It also named
Andrew Davies chief financial officer.  Regulation Changes  Net income increased 17 percent to $573 million, helped by
lower taxes and financial expenses. Sales rose in Russia, the
company’s biggest market, and other former Soviet countries.
Revenue fell in Italy amid changes in the regulation of so-called termination rates. It operates in 15 countries and total
revenue was little changed at $5.7 billion.  The gauge of the most-traded Russian stocks in the U.S had
the biggest drop since July 18 to 89.46. The  Market Vectors
Russia ETF (RSX) , the largest dedicated Russian exchange-traded fund,
fell 2.2 percent to $25.70 in New York, the lowest level in
about a month. The RTS Volatility Index, which measures expected
swings in the  stock futures , slid 3.5 percent to 24.14.  CTC Media Inc. (CTCM)  tumbled 8 percent to a five-month low of
$10.81. The Russian television holding company reported second-quarter earnings of 20 cents per share, a 9.1 percent decline
from a year earlier.  West Texas Intermediate crude for September delivery
decreased 1.2 percent to settle at $105.30 a barrel on the  New
York Mercantile Exchange . Brent for September settlement slid
0.5 percent to end the session at $108.18 a barrel on the
London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange.  United Co. Rusal (486) , a Moscow-based aluminum producer, dropped
1.9 percent to HK$2.57 in Hong Kong trading as of 2:54 p.m.
local time. The MSCI Asia Pacific Index fell 1.3 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
