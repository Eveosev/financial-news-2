Ranbaxy Laboratories Ltd. (RBXY) ,  India ’s
largest drugmaker, reported an unexpected loss in the second
quarter, dragged by a decline in the rupee.  The loss in the three months to June narrowed to 5.24
billion rupees ($85.6 million) from 5.86 billion rupees a year
earlier, Ranbaxy said in a statement. That compared with the
median estimate for a 1.29 billion rupees profit. Sales dropped
18 percent to 26.3 billion rupees from 32 billion rupees a year
earlier, it said.  Ranbaxy, struggling with charges over the safety of its
drugs, had a loss of 3.67 billion rupees in the quarter because
of the decline in the rupee. India’s currency has declined about
11 percent this year against the dollar and is the worst-performing currency in Asia after  Japan .  The rupee’s decline adversely affected profitability
because of “accounting standards that require marking-to-market
the entire derivatives and foreign currency denominated loans,”
the company said in a statement. “The macro economic
environment continued to be challenging in certain countries in
Western Europe,” Ranbaxy said.  The  shares  rose 4.3 percent to 281.5 rupees at 3:30 p.m.
close in Mumbai before the announcement. The stock has fallen 44
percent this year, compared with a 3.9 percent drop in the
benchmark S&P BSE Sensex.  To contact the reporter on this story:
