Canadian  building permits  fell for
the first time this year in June, as contractors scaled back
intentions for new condominiums.  The value of municipal permits fell 10.3 percent to C$6.65
billion ($6.38 billion), the lowest since March, following a
revised 5.8 percent gain in May,  Statistics Canada  said today in
Ottawa.  Quebec , which underwent a construction strike in June,
led declines with a 31.1 percent drop. Economists surveyed by
 Bloomberg News  had forecast a drop of 2.8 percent, the median of
10 estimates.  Canada’s housing market has defied expectations of a hard
landing after a surge in  home prices  prompted some analysts and
policy makers to warn of a bubble. Home sales in Toronto and
Vancouver, Canada’s two largest real estate markets, soared in
July by 16 percent and 40 percent respectively, realtors said
last week. Even with the drop in June, building permits are 16
percent higher since December.  Residential permits fell 12.9 percent to C$3.97 billion in
June, Statistics Canada said, led by an 18.8 percent decline in
multiple-unit dwellings. Permits for single-family home
construction fell 7.4 percent.  Permits for  non-residential construction  fell 6.1 percent to
C$2.68 billion, as building plans fell 9.5 percent for
commercial space and 21.5 percent for industrial.  While Quebec led declines, drops were broad-based with
seven of the country’s 10 provinces recording lower building
intentions. The value of permits issued in Ontario fell 10.6
percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
