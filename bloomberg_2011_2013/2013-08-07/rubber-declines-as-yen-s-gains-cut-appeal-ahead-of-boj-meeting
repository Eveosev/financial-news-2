Rubber declined as the strengthening
Japanese currency reduced investor appetite for yen-denominated
contracts for the commodity used in tires.  Futures for delivery in January fell as much as 1.6 percent
to 245.9 yen a kilogram ($2,526 a metric ton) on the Tokyo
Commodity Exchange, before trading at 249.8 yen at 11:04 a.m.
local time. Rubber lost 18 percent this year.  The yen touched a six-week high as the  Bank of Japan  starts
a policy meeting today on prospects it will refrain from adding
to unprecedented stimulus that’s helped to weaken the currency.
Data tomorrow may show Japan posted a current-account surplus in
June, according to a Bloomberg survey of economists.  “The strong yen against the dollar and falling equities
markets drove the decline in Tocom rubber,” said  Hiroyuki Kikukawa , general manager for research at Nihon Unicom Inc.
“Investors are in risk-off mode.”  Rubber for delivery in January dropped 0.2 percent to
18,370  yuan  ($3,001) a ton on the Shanghai Futures Exchange.
Thai rubber free-on-board fell 0.7 percent to 76.75 baht ($2.44)
a kilogram yesterday, according to the Rubber Research Institute
of Thailand. Rains across the Thai south, the main plantation
area, have disrupted tapping, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
