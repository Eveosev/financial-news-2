Wheat fell the most in three weeks
after  Iraq  and  Egypt  shunned U.S. grain in tenders yesterday,
indicating ample global supplies. Corn and soybeans dropped.  Egypt, the world’s largest wheat importer, bought 60,000
metric tons each from both Romania and Ukraine yesterday, while
Iraq purchased 150,000 tons of Australian and Canadian grain.  “Wheat’s lower because we missed out on that sale to
Egypt,” Jamey Kohake, a broker and branch manager at Paragon
Investments in  Silver Lake , Kansas, said by telephone. “I don’t
think wheat’s going to fall apart completely, but since we
missed that sale,” investors are selling the grain, he said.  Wheat futures for December delivery fell 1 percent to
settle at $6.5625 a bushel at 1:15 p.m. on the Chicago Board of
Trade, the biggest decline since July 15. The grain has slumped
16 percent this year amid an outlook for bigger world
production.  Corn futures for December delivery slid 0.2 percent to
$4.5825 a bushel in Chicago. Prices retreated to $4.55
yesterday, the lowest since October 2010.  Soybean futures for November delivery slipped 0.1 percent
to $11.6575 a bushel on the CBOT, after touching $11.625, the
lowest for a most-active contract since January 2012.  To contact the reporters on this story:
