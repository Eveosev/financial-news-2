Traders at  Wells Fargo & Co. (WFC) , the
most valuable U.S. bank, recorded five days of losses during the
second quarter as the San Francisco-based lender expands its
securities business.  The company’s average trading value at risk, which measures
the potential maximum loss on any given day, fell to $15 million
during the period from $24 million in the first three months of
the year, the lender said in a quarterly report to regulators
today.  Chief Executive Officer  John Stumpf , 59, moved staff into a
new Charlotte, North Carolina, trading floor in December and
began disclosing the lender’s money-losing trading days for the
first time this year. The firm made $331 million in net trading
gains in the second quarter, a 26 percent increase from a year
earlier, the filing shows.  The bank’s traders made between zero and $15 million on at
least 90 days in the first half of the year, according to the
filing. Traders made more than $15 million on fewer than 16
days, and more than $25 million on less than four days.  Bank of America Corp. (BAC) , based in Charlotte, lost money on
seven days during the quarter, including $54 million on one of
them, according to a filing.  Morgan Stanley (MS)  posted losses on 12
days, including one that topped $50 million. Citigroup Inc.
doesn’t disclose money-losing days. Morgan Stanley and Citigroup
are based in New York.  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and JPMorgan Chase & Co., both
based in New York, haven’t yet released their quarterly
securities filings.  To contact the reporter on this story:
