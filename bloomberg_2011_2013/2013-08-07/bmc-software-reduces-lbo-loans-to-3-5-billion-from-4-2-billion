BMC Software Inc. (BMC)  reduced the amount
of two loans itâ€™s seeking for its leveraged buyout led by Bain
Capital LLC to about $3.5 billion from $4.2 billion, according
to a person with knowledge of the transaction.  The provider of software for corporate  computer networks 
cut a $3.2 billion term loan to $2.88 billion and a 750 million-euro ($1 billion) portion was reduced to 500 million euros, said
the person, who asked not to be identified because terms of the
deal are private.  BMC agreed to be taken private by a group that includes
Bain and Golden Gate Capital in a $6.9 billion deal, after
struggling to compete with newcomers better equipped to handle
the shift toward cloud computing.  The $2.88 billion  term loan  will pay interest at 4
percentage points more than the London interbank offered rate,
with a 1 percent floor on the lending benchmark, the person
said. The spread on the euro portion will be 4.5 percentage
points more than Euribor.  The Houston-based company proposed selling both pieces to
investors at a discount of 99 percent of face value, said the
person. Discounts reduce proceeds for the borrower and boost the
yield for investors.  Credit Suisse Group AG is arranging the LBO financing and
lenders are asked to let the bank know by 5 p.m. whether they
will participate in the deal.  BMC also increased its sale of dollar-denominated bonds
backing the buyout to $1.63 billion from $1.38 billion, after
yesterday scrapping plans for a 250 million-euro portion of the
sale, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
