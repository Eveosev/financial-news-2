Twenty-five Nuveen Investments Inc.
funds sued  American International Group Inc. (AIG) , claiming the
company and executives committed  securities fraud  leading to the
U.S. financial crisis that intensified in 2008.  Also named yesterday as defendants in a 237-page complaint
in federal court in Chicago were former Chief Executive Officer
Martin J. Sullivan, ex-Chief Financial Officer Steven Bensinger
and  Joseph Cassano , who led the AIG Financial Products unit.  “Plaintiffs suffered tens of billions of dollars in
losses, at least, based on false and materially misleading
statements that AIG, certain of its executives, directors,
underwriters and outside auditor made,” according to the
complaint.  The funds accused the company, Sullivan and others of
violating Illinois and federal securities laws, common law fraud
and unjust enrichment. They asked for unspecified money damages.  Matthew Gallagher, a spokesman for New York-based AIG,
declined to comment immediately on the allegations.  Nuveen Investments is based in Chicago. Among funds suing
the insurer are the  Dow 30 Enhanced Premium and Income Fund , the
 Nuveen Equity Premium Opportunity Fund (JSN)  and the  Nuveen Large Cap
Value Fund. (NNGAX)   Each bought AIG securities at allegedly inflated prices
that fell “when the truth was disclosed,” according to the
complaint.  The case is Dow 30 Enhanced Premium & Income Fund v.
American International Group Inc., 13-cv-05612, U.S. District
Court, Northern District of Illinois (Chicago).  To contact the reporter on this story:
