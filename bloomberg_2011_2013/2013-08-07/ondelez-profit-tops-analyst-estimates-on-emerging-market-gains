Mondelez International Inc. (MDLZ) , the
maker of snacks such as Oreo cookies and Ritz crackers, posted
second-quarter earnings that beat analysts’ estimates as sales
growth accelerated in  emerging markets .  Profit excluding some items was 37 cents a share, the
Deerfield, Illinois-based company said today in a statement. The
average of 17 estimates compiled by Bloomberg was 34 cents.
Mondelez also boosted its dividend for the first time since 2008
and raised its share-buyback plan fivefold.  Mondelez, facing pressure from activist investor  Nelson Peltz , increased its quarterly dividend 7.7 percent to 14 cents
a share and revised its stock repurchase authorization to as
much as $6 billion from $1.2 billion. Peltz, who holds a 2.3
percent stake and is one of the company’s largest shareholders,
has pushed for a merger with  PepsiCo Inc. (PEP)   Revenue for the quarter rose less than 1 percent to
$8.6 billion, in line with analysts’ average estimate. Sales in
emerging markets grew 9.7 percent, helped by Brazil, Russia,
India and China. Net income fell 40 percent to $616 million,
or 34 cents a share, from $1.03 billion, or 58 cents, a year
earlier.  The  shares  rose as much as 2.7 percent to $32.10 in
extended trading. They had fallen 1.9 percent to $31.26 at the
close in  New York , for a gain of 23 percent this year as the
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index advanced 19 percent.  The  dividend , increased from 13 cents, is payable Oct. 15
to shareholders of record as of Sept 30.  To contact the reporter on this story:
