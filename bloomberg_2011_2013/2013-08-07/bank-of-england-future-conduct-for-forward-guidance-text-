The following is the text of the
 Bank of England ’s guidance regarding the future conduct
of monetary policy:  At its meeting on 1 August, the Bank of England’s Monetary
Policy Committee (MPC) voted to provide some explicit guidance
regarding the future conduct of monetary policy.  The Committee intends at a minimum to maintain the current
highly stimulative stance of monetary policy until economic
slack has been substantially reduced, provided this does not
entail material risks to either price stability or financial
stability.  In particular, the MPC intends not to raise Bank Rate from its
current level of 0.5% at least until the Labour Force Survey
headline measure of the unemployment rate has fallen to a
threshold of 7%, subject to the conditions below.  The MPC stands ready to undertake further asset purchases while
the unemployment rate remains above 7% if it judges that
additional monetary stimulus is warranted.  But until the
unemployment threshold is reached, and subject to the conditions
below, the MPC intends not to reduce the stock of asset
purchases financed by the issuance of central bank reserves and,
consistent with that, intends to reinvest the cash flows
associated with all maturing gilts held in the Asset Purchase
Facility.  The guidance linking Bank Rate and asset sales to the
unemployment threshold would cease to hold if any of the
following three ’knockouts’ were breached:  - in the MPC’s view, it is more likely than not, that CPI
inflation 18 to 24 months ahead will be 0.5 percentage points or
more above the 2% target;  - medium-term inflation expectations no longer remain
sufficiently well anchored;  - the Financial Policy Committee (FPC) judges that the stance of
monetary policy poses a significant threat to financial
stability that cannot be contained by the substantial range of
mitigating policy actions available to the FPC, the Financial
Conduct Authority and the Prudential Regulation Authority in a
way consistent with their objectives.  The Committee will continue to set the level of Bank Rate and
the size of the asset purchase programme each month, taking
these criteria into account.  The action taken by the MPC if any
of these knockouts were breached would depend upon its
assessment at the time as to the appropriate setting of monetary
policy in order to fulfil its remit to deliver price stability.
There is therefore no presumption that breaching any of these
knockouts would lead to an immediate increase in Bank Rate or
sale of assets.  Further information regarding the background to this decision
can be found in the document Monetary policy trade-offs and
forward guidance published alongside today’s Inflation Report,

eport/2013/ir13augforwardguidance.pdf   As previously announced on 1 August, and consistent with the
policy guidance above, the Committee also voted to maintain the
official Bank Rate paid on commercial bank reserves at 0.5%, and
to maintain the stock of asset purchases financed by the
issuance of central bank reserves at Stg 375 billion.  The minutes of the meeting will be published at 9.30am on
Wednesday 14 August.  To contact the reporter on this story:
