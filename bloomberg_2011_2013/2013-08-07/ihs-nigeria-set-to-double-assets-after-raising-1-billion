IHS Nigeria Plc (IHS) , which operates
telecommunications infrastructure in three African countries, is
set to more than double its assets after raising $1 billion for
investment, Chief Executive Officer Issam Darwish said.  IHS wants to increase the number of telecommunications
towers under its management to 20,000 by 2016 from the 8,500
towers it currently runs in Nigeria, Cameroon and  Ivory Coast ,
Darwish said on Aug. 5 in a phone interview from Beirut,
Lebanon’s capital. “We have funding available for various
opportunities that we are currently analyzing,” he said.  The Lagos-based company said in July it raised $522 million
in new capital, $280 million in debt and $242 million in equity
in the preceding year to fund its expansion across Africa.  Nigeria has Africa’s highest number of mobile-phone users,
with 109 million subscribers at the end of 2012, according to
the regulator Nigerian Communications Commission. MTN Group
Ltd.’s Nigerian unit was the market leader with 47.4 million
customers, followed by Nigeria’s Globacom Ltd. with 24.1
million, New Delhi-based  Bharti Airtel (BHARTI)  with 23.1 million, and
Abu Dhabi-based  Emirates Telecommunications Corp. (ETISALAT) , known as
Etisalat, with 14.9 million, according to data on the NCC’s
website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
