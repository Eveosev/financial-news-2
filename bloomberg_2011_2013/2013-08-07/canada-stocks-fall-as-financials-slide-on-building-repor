Canadian  stocks  fell, erasing gains
for the year, as financials and energy producers retreated amid
weaker-than-forecast housing construction and growing concern
the U.S. Federal Reserve may reduce its bond purchases.  Dream Unlimited Corp., a real-estate manager and developer,
lost 2.8 percent to pace declines among financial stocks.
Enbridge Inc. and Encana Corp. dropped at least 1.6 percent as
energy shares slumped.  BlackBerry Ltd. (BB)  retreated 3.3 percent as
its market share fell.  Athabasca Oil Corp. (ATH)  surged 10 percent
after winning approval for its Dover oil-sands project from an
Alberta regulator. Air Canada soared 25 percent as profits
topped estimates amid falling fuel costs.  The  Standard & Poor’s/TSX Composite Index (SPTSX)  fell 56.59
points, or 0.5 percent, to 12,412.73 at 4 p.m. in Toronto. The

two days, and is down 0.2 percent for the year.  “I thought we needed a rest, a slight pause and a
correction,” said  Ian Nakamoto , director of research with
MacDougall MacDougall & MacTier Inc. in Toronto. The firm
manages about $4 billion. “If you go up in a straight line
you’re in trouble. There’s some worry over the Fed which has
caused the market to sell off, and that nervousness has spilled
over into today.”  Canadian equities sank 1.1 percent yesterday as comments
from a Fed official fueled concern the U.S. central bank may
reduce the pace of its monthly bond buying this year. Fed Bank
of Chicago President  Charles Evans  said he “would clearly not”
rule out a decision to begin curbing bond purchases in
September. Fed Bank of Cleveland President  Sandra Pianalto  said
today that a tapering may be warranted if the labor market
continues to strengthen.  Building Permits  Canadian building permits fell for the first time this year
in June, declining 10.3 percent to C$6.65 billion ($6.38
billion) as contractors scaled back intentions for new
condominiums. Economists surveyed by Bloomberg had forecast a
median drop of 2.8 percent.  Dream Unlimited slumped 2.8 percent to C$12.10 as financial
stocks dropped 0.6 percent.  Energy stocks declined 0.9 percent, falling the most as
seven of 10 industries in the S&P/TSX retreated. Trading volume
was 9.1 percent lower than the 30-day average.  Enbridge lost 1.6 percent to C$44.88 and Encana decreased
1.9 percent to C$18.07 as 42 of 58 members in the S&P/TSX Energy
Index fell.  Crude for September delivery dropped 0.9 percent to settle
at $104.37 a barrel in  New York , after the U.S. government
reported an unexpected increase in supplies of gasoline and
distillate fuels. Economists had forecast stockpiles to
decrease.  Smartphone Market  BlackBerry lost 3.3 percent to C$9.58, snapping five days
of gains. BlackBerry’s global smartphone market share in the
second quarter fell to 2.9 percent from 4.9 percent a year ago,
a report from International Data Corp. said today. Google Inc.’s
Android operating system was the top performer, climbing to a 79
percent market share, the report said.  Athabasca Oil jumped 10 percent to C$8.12. With the Alberta
regulator approving the Dover oil-sands project, Athabasca can
sell its stake in the project, worth about C$1.3 billion, to
PetroChina Co. and use the funds for other projects.  Air Canada (AC/B)  climbed 25 percent to C$2.65, the most since May
2009, after reporting second-quarter profit that topped
analysts’ estimates. The company said it spent C$831 million on
fuel in the second quarter, 6 percent less than the same period
a year ago. Capacity will grow 9 percent to 11 percent next year
as the company adds Boeing Co. 777 and 787 jets.  Valeant Pharmaceuticals International Inc. (VRX)  rose 2.1 percent
to C$101.70, a record high, after raising its full-year earnings
forecast. The drugmaker completed its $8.7 billion acquisition
of Bausch & Lomb Inc. this month and expects “significantly
more than” $800 million in cost synergies from the combined
company.  To contact the reporter on this story:
