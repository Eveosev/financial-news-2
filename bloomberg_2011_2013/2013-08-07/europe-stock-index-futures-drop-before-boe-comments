(Corrects description of jobless threshold in first and
fifth paragraphs, and size of rally in third paragraph of story
published yesterday.)  European  stocks  fell as the  Bank of
England  said it won’t raise  interest rates  or reduce bond
purchases until the U.K.’s jobless rate falls to 7 percent,
sparking concern it expects the economic recovery to be slow.  Natixis SA dropped the most in six months after posting a
29 percent decline in second-quarter net income. Rexel SA lost
4.2 percent after its largest shareholder sold a 10 percent
stake. Randgold Resources Ltd. led  mining stocks  lower after
reporting a slump in sales and earnings. ING Groep NV surged to
a two-year high after quarterly pretax profit rose.  The Stoxx Europe 600 Index declined 0.2 percent to 302.81
at the close of trading, as Bank of England Governor  Mark Carney 
said the U.K. economy hasn’t reached “escape velocity.” The
benchmark gauge has rallied 9.9 percent since June 24 as the
 Federal Reserve , the  European Central Bank  and the Bank of
England pledged to continue stimulus.  “It looks like rates are not going to rise in the next
three years, though they could, as Carney has stressed they are
not pre-committed,”  Marc Ostwald , a strategist at Monument
Securities in London, wrote in an e-mail. “This is a rather
valueless bit of forward guidance as is the case with the ECB.
Where is the evidence that there is a stable relationship
between U.K. unemployment and U.K. inflation trends?”  Threshold Set  The Bank of England said it will seek not to raise its
benchmark interest rate or reduce bond purchases until the
U.K.’s  unemployment rate  falls to 7 percent, linking stimulus
measures to a threshold for the first time. The unemployment
rate was at 7.8 percent in the quarter through May and the BOE
expects it will stay above 7 percent at least until the third
quarter of 2016.  The BOE’s Monetary Policy Committee last week voted to
maintain the  bank rate  at 0.5 percent, the level it has been
held at since March 2009, and the stock of asset purchases at
375 billion pounds ($580 billion).  In the U.S., Fed Bank of Chicago President  Charles Evans , a
proponent of monetary stimulus, said late yesterday he would not
rule out a decision to reduce bond purchases from September.  Fed Bank of Dallas President  Richard Fisher , one of the
most vocal critics of quantitative easing, said Aug. 5 that
policy makers were “closer to execution mode” in considering
the right time to begin reducing purchases.  DAX Declines  National benchmark indexes retreated in 11 of the 18
western-European markets. The U.K.’s FTSE 100 slipped 1.4
percent, while  Germany ’s DAX Index lost 0.5 percent.  France ’s
CAC 40 rose 0.2 percent.  Natixis declined 3.8 percent to 3.79 euros, its biggest
decrease since Feb. 4. Quarterly net income on a pro-forma basis
dropped to 248 million euros ($330 million). The bank took a 20
million-euro charge on its debt, after booking a 91 million-euro
gain in the year-earlier period.  Rexel (RXL)  slid 4.2 percent to 18.15 euros. Ray Investment SARL
sold 28.8 million shares at 18.25 euros each in the electrical-equipment distributor, according to a personal familiar with the
sale. Ray Investment now holds 60.8 million shares, or more than
21 percent, in the company.  A gauge of mining companies declined for a second day as
 Australia ’s highest court upheld the country’s tax on iron-ore
and coal profits, dismissing a challenge from Fortescue Metals
Group Ltd. and state governments.  Randgold, Rio  Randgold Resources retreated 1.4 percent to 4,366 pence.
The gold producer said second-quarter profit slumped 61 percent
from a year earlier to $46.3 million, while sales declined 27
percent to $252.8 million.  Rio Tinto Group fell 1.5 percent 2,953.5 pence. The
commodity producer lost three bidders for its iron-ore unit in
 Canada  after offers came below the company’s expectations,
Reuters reported, citing people familiar with the matter.  Andritz AG tumbled 7.9 percent to 39.10 euros, for its
largest decline in three months. The Austrian maker of hydro-power turbines posted second-quarter profit that missed
estimates and said full-year earnings will drop.  ING (INGA) , which received a 10 billion-euro government bailout in
2008, gained 5.1 percent to 8.26 euros. Underlying pretax profit
for the banking unit rose 14 percent to 1.15 billion euros in
the second quarter as the interest margin improved and cost cuts
paid off, the biggest Dutch financial-services company said.  Securitas AB climbed 8.4 percent to 70.50 kronor, its
largest increase since October 2008. The seven-day rally also
marked its longest winning streak since March 2011. The security
provider posted net income of 461 million kronor ($70 million)
in the second quarter, exceeding the average analyst estimate of
437 million kronor.  To contact the reporter on this story:
