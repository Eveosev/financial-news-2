The U.K. accounting regulator is
investigating Grant Thornton LLP’s audit of Manchester Building
Society over the way it recorded  interest-rate swaps , which led
to an adjustment in its financial statement.  The  Financial Reporting Council  is probing the Manchester,
England-based lender’s accounts for 2012, the regulator said in
a  statement  on its website today.  “The decision to investigate follows information received
from the Prudential Regulation Authority in relation to the
conduct of the auditors at the time,” the FRC said in the
statement.  Manchester Building Society “decided to alter the
accounting treatment of its long-term mortgage book and related
interest rate hedges” last year, according to a  statement  on
its website. It restated its 2011 retained earnings by a
decrease of 28.7 million pounds ($43.9 million) to 9.7 million
pounds, the lender said.  Christopher Gee, finance director at Manchester Building
Society, and Wendy Watherston, a spokeswoman at  Grant Thornton ,
didn’t immediately respond to voicemails seeking comment.  Grant Thornton’s audits of catering company Nichols Plc,
for 2011 and 2012, are also being probed by the accounting
regulator, the FRC said on its website. Earlier this year the
FRC opened two separate investigations into KPMG LLP, examining
its audits of a car-seller and the conduct of one of its
partners.  To contact the reporter on this story:
