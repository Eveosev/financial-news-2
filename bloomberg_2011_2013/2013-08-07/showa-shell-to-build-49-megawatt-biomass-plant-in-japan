Showa Shell (5002)  Sekiyu K.K., a Japanese
refiner, will build a 49-megawatt biomass power plant south of
Tokyo in Kanagawa prefecture as it expands it power generation
business.  The plant, the first biomass project for the company, will
be built on the site of the company’s former refinery and will
begin operating in December 2015, Tokyo-based Showa Shell said
in a statement today.  The company will invest about 16 billion yen ($164
million), Minoru Yagyuda, general manager of Showa Shell’s power
business division, said today in a briefing. Woody biomass,
mainly from  North America , and palm kernel shells from Indonesia
and Malaysia will be used to power the plant.  The location is convenient for ships to deliver fuel and is
close to an area of major power use, according to the statement.
Kanagawa is part of greater  Tokyo  in the southern Kanto region
of Japan.  Showa Shell wholly owns Solar Frontier K.K., a maker of
solar panels.  To contact the reporters on this story:
