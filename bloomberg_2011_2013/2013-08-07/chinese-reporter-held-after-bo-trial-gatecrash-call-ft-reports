A Chinese journalist who supports Bo Xilai was arrested after allegedly calling for people to
gatecrash the ousted Politburo member’s corruption trial, the
Financial Times reported.  Song Yangbiao, a Maoist and journalist with Guangzhou,
China-based The Time Weekly newspaper, was detained Monday and
faces charges of “picking quarrels and provoking troubles,”
the newspaper reported.  Song took to  Sina Corp.’s (SINA)  Twitter-like Weibo microblog
service to urge people to converge on Bo’s trial in the city of
Jinan and break him out of prison, the FT said, citing people
who read the posts it didn’t identify. It said the posts have
since been deleted.  Bo was charged last month with bribery, corruption and
abuse of power. His wife, Gu Kailai, was convicted last year of
murdering British businessman Neil Heywood.  Police have confirmed that Song was detained, the FT
reported, without citing anyone by name. It said family members
and a lawyer representing Song confirmed the charges.  To contact the reporter on this story:
