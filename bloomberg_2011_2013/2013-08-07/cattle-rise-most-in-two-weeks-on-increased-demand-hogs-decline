Cattle futures rose the most in more
than two weeks on signs of increasing demand for U.S. beef. Hogs
fell.  Beef exports in June climbed 8 percent from a year earlier
to 101,720 metric tons, the highest monthly total in 2013, U.S.
Meat Export Federation data show.  Wholesale-beef prices  climbed
0.4 percent to $1.8717 a pound yesterday. The gain signals
increased demand for the Labor Day holiday on Sept. 2, the
third-most popular barbecuing day for Americans, with 55 percent
participating, according to the Hearth, Patio and Barbecue
Association.  “We are seeing an improvement in demand,”  Rich Nelson ,
the chief strategist at Allendale Inc. in McHenry,  Illinois ,
said in a telephone interview. “We have retail buying for the
Labor Day holiday, and school programs are buying for lunches as
schools get back into session. We have football season starting
too, so we could see a few more grilling days there.”  Cattle futures for October delivery added 0.3 percent to
$1.2505 a pound at 10:09 a.m. on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange, heading for the biggest increase since July 18.  Feeder-cattle futures for September settlement slipped 0.3
percent to $1.5725 a pound.  Hog futures for October settlement slid 0.1 percent to
86.35 cents a pound on the CME, headed for the first decline in
more than a week.  To contact the reporter on this story:
