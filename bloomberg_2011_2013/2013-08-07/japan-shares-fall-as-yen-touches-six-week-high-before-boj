Japanese  shares  fell, with the  Nikkei
225  Stock Average tumbling the most in almost two months, as
exporters slipped after the yen touched a six-week high to the
dollar and earnings disappointed investors.  Toyota Motor Corp.,  Asia ’s biggest carmaker, lost 2.4
percent as the yen advanced for a fourth day.  IHI (7013)  Corp., a
manufacturer of  jet engines  and ships, dropped 5.8 percent after
its earnings forecast missed estimates. Pioneer Corp. tumbled
8.7 percent as the car-stereo maker cut its profit outlook by 92
percent. Oil refiner Showa Shell Sekiyu K.K. rose 3.7 percent
after almost doubling its net-income projection.  The Nikkei 225 retreated 4 percent to 13,824.94 at the
close in Tokyo, its biggest decline since June 13. Just six
companies advanced. The Topix lost 3.2 percent to 1,155.26, with
all 33 industry groups dropping. Volume was 10 percent below the
30-day average. The  Bank of Japan  started a two-day policy
meeting today.  “Investors are liquidating their ‘short-the-yen, buy-Japanese-stocks’ positions and becoming more neutral on the
country’s equities,” said  Hiroichi Nishi , an equities manager
in Tokyo at SMBC Nikko Securities Inc., a unit of  Japan ’s
second-biggest lender by market value. “Some investors are
taking their summer breaks and the market lacks energy. It’s
likely to remain lackluster for a while.”  Even after falling for the past three months, the Topix is
still up 34 percent this year, retaining Japan’s position as the
world’s best-performing developed equity market. The measure has
risen amid optimism Prime Minister Shinzo Abe will push through
reforms while the BOJ provides record stimulus.  Share Swings  Volatility has been high amid thin trading volume as
investors weigh Abe’s stimulus policies against concern  China’s
economy  is slowing and prospects the U.S. will end bond-buying.
The Topix moved an average of 2.4 percent a day last week, the
biggest fluctuations since June.  Historical volatility  over the
last 90 days, which includes May and June when the index plunged
more than 18 percent, reached the highest last week since 2009.  “While we’re in this vacation season and the market is
thin, intraday trading is likely to be choppy,” said  Masaru Hamasaki , a senior strategist at Tokyo-based Sumitomo Mitsui
Asset Management Co., which oversees about $111 billion. “But
volatility on a market-close basis may begin to tail off.”  A  gauge  of implied volatility on the Nikkei 225, calculated
using futures and options prices, fell 37 percent today from a
June high, suggesting investors expect swings to decline.  BOJ Meeting  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index lost 0.3
percent. The gauge yesterday posted its biggest decline since
June 24, as the trade deficit narrowed to the lowest since 2009,
fueling concern the  Federal Reserve  may reduce its bond
purchases this year.  The BOJ will probably keep policy unchanged tomorrow at the
conclusion of its meeting, according to all 26 economists
surveyed by  Bloomberg News . Twenty of the analysts expect more
stimulus in the next 10 months as Governor Haruhiko Kuroda and
his colleagues seek to achieve 2 percent inflation. Consumer
prices excluding fresh food, the BOJ’s preferred measure of
inflation,  rose  0.4 percent in June.  Exporters declined as the yen strengthened. The 120-day
correlation between gains in Japan’s currency and declines in
the Topix was at its strongest today since at least 2000,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Toyota Motor, which said a one-yen decline against the
dollar boosts operating income by 40 billion yen, fell 2.4
percent to 6,230 yen.  Canon Inc. (7751) , the world’s largest camera
maker, slipped 2.5 percent to 3,130 yen.  Pioneer Tumbles  Amid companies retreating after reporting earnings, Pioneer
plunged 8.7 percent to 178 yen, the lowest since April 5, as the
company cut its full-year profit forecast by 92 percent to 500
million yen ($5.1 million) on slumping domestic sales. The
Kanagawa-based audio-equipment maker has dropped 39 percent from
a recent high on May 14.  IHI tumbled 5.8 percent to 409 yen for its biggest loss
since May 23. The maker of rocket-propulsion systems raised its
net-income forecast 28 percent to 23 billion yen, short of the
26.6 billion-yen median estimate.  Profits have increased 91 percent at the 1,253  Topix (TPX) 
companies that have reported quarterly earnings, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. Of the 213 companies on the gauge
that posted results for which Bloomberg has estimates, 60
percent  beat  projections.  Among stocks that rose, Showa Shell climbed 3.7 percent to
961 yen for the biggest gain on the Nikkei 225. The refiner
raised its profit forecast 85 percent to 48 billion yen. The
stock also rose as the company said it would build a 49-megawatt
biomass plant outside Tokyo.  Sumitomo Seika Chemicals Co. advanced the most on the
Topix, surging 20 percent to 478 yen. The Osaka-based company
raised its profit forecast 50 percent to 4.5 billion yen after
first-quarter net income more than tripled to 1.6 billion yen.  The Topix  traded  at 1.21 times book value today, compared
with 2.49 for the S&P 500 and 1.69 for the Stoxx Europe 600
Index yesterday.  To contact the reporters on this story:
