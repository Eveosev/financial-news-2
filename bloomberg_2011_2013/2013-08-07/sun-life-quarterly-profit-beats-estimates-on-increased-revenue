Sun Life Financial Inc. (SLF) ,  Canada ’s
third-largest insurer, posted second-quarter profit that beat
analysts’ estimates as wealth-management and insurance sales
increased.  Net income from continuing operations rose 60 percent to
C$391 million ($375 million), or 64 cents a share, from C$244
million, or 41 cents, a year earlier, the Toronto-based firm
said today in a statement. Operating profit, which excludes some
items, was 71 cents a share, compared with the 65-cent average
 estimate  of 13 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  “Sun Life had a very strong quarter,” Chief Executive
Officer Dean Connor, 56, said in the statement.  Life and health insurance sales climbed 32 percent to C$496
million from a year earlier, the firm said. Sales of wealth
products were C$28.8 billion, an increase of 32 percent over the
same period in 2012, fueled largely by gains in  Asia , according
to the statement.  Sun Life completed the sale of its U.S. annuities unit last
week to Guggenheim Partners LLC shareholders for C$1.35 billion
as it seeks to cut risk. Results in that unit were excluded from
second-quarter continuing operations, the firm said.  The insurer revised its net income objective for the end of
2015 to C$1.85 billion from C$2 billion before the U.S. annuity-unit sale.  Sun Life slid 0.5 percent to C$32.99 at 4 p.m. in Toronto.
The shares have  climbed  25 percent this year, outpacing the 5.7
percent  advance  of the 45-company Standard & Poor’s/TSX
Financials Index.  (Sun Life will hold a conference call tomorrow at 10 a.m. in
