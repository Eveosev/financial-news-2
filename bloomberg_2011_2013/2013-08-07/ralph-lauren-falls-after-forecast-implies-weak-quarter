Ralph Lauren  Corp., the retailer of
its namesake brand clothing, fell the most in more than two
years after its forecast for the current quarter implied profit
would trail analysts’ estimates.  The shares sank 8.6 percent to $173.13 in New York for the
biggest decline since May 2011. The New York-based company’s
shares have jumped 15 percent this year, compared with a 19
percent gain for the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index.  Ralph Lauren said today in a statement that revenue in the
quarter through September would rise at a low single-digit
percentage rate and that its operating margin would narrow by as
much as 350 basis points. The forecast implies profit of $2.28
per share at most, Michael Binetti, an analyst at UBS AG in  New
York , wrote in a note today. Analysts estimated $2.60, on
average.  Net income in the three months ended June 29 fell 6.2
percent to $181 million because of costs from assuming direct
control of the Chaps brand and unfavorable foreign-currency
trends. The per-share profit matched the average of 14  estimates 
compiled by Bloomberg. Revenue gained 3.8 percent to $1.65
billion in the quarter, matching analysts’ average estimate.  To contact the reporter on this story:
