Swisscom AG (SCMN) , Switzerland’s biggest
phone company, reported second-quarter profit and revenue that
topped analysts’ estimates and said it plans to appoint a new
chief executive officer by the end of this year.  Net income dropped 6.8 percent to 427 million francs ($461
million), the Bern-based company said today. Profit exceeded the
408 million-franc average estimate by analysts, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. Sales rose 1.5 percent to 2.86
billion francs, compared with the 2.8 billion-franc estimate.  Swisscom, which made more than 80 percent of its revenue
last year from its  home country , is coping with sluggish
consumer demand that pushes phone bills down across Europe. Its
Italian fixed-line unit, Fastweb, boosted its broadband
connections to 1.89 million lines at the end of June from 1.67
million a year earlier.  Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and
amortization were 1.07 billion francs, compared with 1.13
billion francs a year earlier and the 1.08 billion-franc average
estimate of analysts.  Swisscom  shares  rose 1.3 percent to 418.50 francs as of
10:18 a.m. in Zurich, valuing the company at 21.7 billion
francs. The stock advanced 4.9 percent this year through
yesterday while the Bloomberg Europe Telecommunication Services
Index climbed 8.6 percent in the same period.  The company confirmed its full-year Ebitda forecast of at
least 4.25 billion francs and said revenue will be more than
11.4 billion francs, compared with its previous projection for
11.3 billion francs.  On July 23, Swisscom named the head of its Swiss business,
Urs Schaeppi, as interim chief executive officer to replace
Carsten Schloter, who was found dead at his home in what police
said was a suspected suicide. A new CEO will be appointed before
the end of this year, Swisscom said today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
