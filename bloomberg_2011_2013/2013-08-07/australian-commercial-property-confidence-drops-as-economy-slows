Australian investors’ confidence in
commercial property slumped in the three months to June 30 as
the nation’s softer economy weighed on business and consumer
sentiment.  The NAB Commercial Property Index dropped to minus 16, the
third-lowest level since the bank started the measure in March
2010 and the weakest since December 2012. Offices fared the
worst, with that index seeing the biggest drop from the first
quarter.  NAB’s  business conditions gauge  slumped to minus 8 from
minus 4, a four-year low in June as low interest rates and a
falling Australian dollar failed to boost the economy. The
Reserve Bank of Australia, which is seeking to rebalance the
economy toward industries including residential construction as
the mining investment boom wanes, yesterday cut its  benchmark
rate  by a quarter percentage point to a record-low 2.5 percent,  “ Consumer confidence  is still the main challenge facing
property businesses,” NAB said in today’s report. “The immense
impact structural change is having on the Australian economy is
becoming increasingly apparent, with the economy now growing at
its slowest pace in almost two years.”  Values and rents of office, retail and industrial
properties fell in the second quarter, according to the report.
Expectations for capital and rental growth were also lower than
earlier expected, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
