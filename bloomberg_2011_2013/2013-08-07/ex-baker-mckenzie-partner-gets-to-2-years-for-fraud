Former  Baker & McKenzie  LLP partner
Martin Weisberg, who admitted to stealing from a client and
taking part in a $55 million  securities fraud , was sentenced to
two years in prison, the U.S. said.  Weisberg, 62, pleaded guilty to conspiracy and money
laundering in May 2012 after prosecutors alleged he skimmed $1.3
million in interest from an escrow account for a hedge fund
client, SIAM Capital Management. Separately, Weisberg joined a
scheme to manipulate the stock price of technology firms
Xybernaut Corp. and Ramp Corp. prosecutors said.  “Instead of using his talents to provide wise counsel, he
lied to and stole from his own clients, lied to the Securities
and Exchange Commission, and betrayed the investing public,”
 Brooklyn  U.S. Attorney Loretta Lynch said in a statement.  U.S. District Judge Nicholas Garaufis in Brooklyn, New
York, also ordered Weisberg to pay $297,500 in restitution and
$250,000 in forfeiture, according to prosecutors.  Weisberg left Baker & McKenzie in October 2007 at the time
of his arrest in the securities case. Previously, he had worked
at firms including Cravath, Swaine & Moore LLP, Morgan Lewis &
Bockius, and Shea & Gould, according to a memorandum filed by
his lawyers in March.  He graduated from Northwestern University School of Law in
1975, where he was first in his class, according to the
memorandum.  Richard Albert, a lawyer for Weisberg, declined to comment
on the sentence.  The case is U.S. v. Saltsman, 07-cr-641, U.S. District
Court, Eastern District of  New York  (Brooklyn).  To contact the reporter on this story:
