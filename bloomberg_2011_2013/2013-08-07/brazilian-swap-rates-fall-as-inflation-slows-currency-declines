Brazil ’s shorter-term swap rates
dropped after a report showing slower annual inflation spurred
speculation that the central bank will reduce the pace of
increases in borrowing costs.  Swap rates due in January 2015 declined three basis points,
or 0.03 percentage point, to 9.68 percent at 9:58 a.m. in  Sao
Paulo . The real depreciated 0.3 percent to 2.305 per dollar.  Annual inflation as measured by the IPCA consumer price
index decelerated to 6.27 percent in July from 6.7 percent in
June, the national statistics agency reported today. The central
bank’s preferred range is 2.5 percent to 6.5 percent.  “The level of economic activity is weak and inflation is
more or less behaving,” Paulo Gala, a strategist at Fator
Corretora in Sao Paulo, said in a telephone interview.  Inflation hovering at the top of the central bank’s
target range has eroded purchasing power in  Latin America ’s
biggest economy and caused consumption to slow. To stem price
increases, policy makers have embarked on the biggest cycle of
interest-rate increases in the Group of 20 nations. A weakening
currency, which increases import prices, led Finance Minister
 Guido Mantega  to cut tariffs this month on more than 100
imported products, including steel.  Brazil’s central bank raised the  target lending rate  by a
half-percentage point on July 10 to 8.50 percent, the third
consecutive increase this year from a record low 7.25 percent.  The economy expanded 0.9 percent last year, its worst
performance since 2009. Analysts surveyed by the central bank
forecast gross domestic product will grow 2.24 percent in 2013
and inflation will end the year at 5.75 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
