Marks & Spencer Group Plc (MKS) , the U.K.’s
largest clothing retailer, is closing stores in Ireland for the
first time since it began serving the country 35 years ago as a
challenging economy prompted a review of its outlets.  The retailer will have 17 stores in Ireland once the four
unprofitable outlets are shuttered, Clare Wilkes, a spokeswoman
for the London-based grocer and clothes seller, said by phone. A
new 72,000-square-foot flagship outlet in Limerick is planned
for 2016.  Marks & Spencer has kept the Irish division under review
for several years as sales struggled during the worst recession
in the country’s modern history. The retailer said in May that
European revenue suffered from “ongoing weakness” in the Irish
economy. Retail sales in the nation have fallen in four of the
last five years.  “The retail sector outlook has not improved and we have to
act now to protect the long-term good of the company,” Jonathan
Glenister, head of M&S Ireland, said in an e-mailed statement.  The stores to be closed are in Dun Laoghaire and Tallaght,
in County Dublin, as well as Naas in County Kildare and
Mullingar in County Westmeath. About 180 jobs will be
eliminated, while the Limerick opening will yield 250 new jobs.  “We hope that the news of a new flagship store for
Limerick and an investment in our remaining estate will be
welcomed by our customers and seen as a confirmation of our
commitment,” Glenister said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
