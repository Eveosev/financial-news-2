Mexican policy makers lowered their
growth forecast for this year, with the central bank’s Governor
 Agustin Carstens  saying that considerable risks to the global
economy remain.  Gross domestic product will expand 2 percent to 3 percent,
compared with the 3 percent to 4 percent previously forecast,
the bank said in its quarterly inflation report published today.
Inflation will end the year close to 3.5 percent, before
dropping to about 3 percent in 2014, policy makers said. Prices
rose 3.53 percent in the 12 months through mid-July.  Policy makers voted unanimously to keep the key rate at 4
percent last month as the debate over stimulus policies in the
U.S. fueled instability in global  currency markets . At the same
time, inflation has slowed more than forecast to within the
central bank’s target range and analysts have lowered their 2013
economic growth forecasts in each monthly central bank survey
this year to below 3 percent.  The possibility of the Fed easing its rate of bond
purchases became “the most important change in the
international environment,” policy makers said in the minutes
to the last rate meeting released July 26. Some Banxico members
said they remain watchful for “external financial shocks.”  Carstens told reporters today after the release of the
report that  Mexico ’s economy has handled external shocks well
because of its sound economic fundamentals.  The central bank left its growth forecast for 2014 at 3.2
percent to 4.2 percent, while estimating that the economy would
create 450,000 to 550,000 jobs in the formal sector this year
and 700,000 to 800,000 next year.  Economists expect the economy to expand 2.7 percent in
2013, according to the median forecast in yesterday’s bi-weekly
survey by Citigroup Inc.’s Banamex unit.  To contact the reporter on this story:
