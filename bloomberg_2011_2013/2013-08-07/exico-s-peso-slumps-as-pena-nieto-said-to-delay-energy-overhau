Mexico ’s peso weakened for the first
time in four days as President Enrique Pena Nieto pushed back
the announcement of a proposal to overhaul the  energy industry .  The peso slumped 0.6 percent to 12.7011 per dollar at 9:44
a.m. in Mexico City. Yields on Mexican government peso bonds
maturing in 2024 rose three basis points, or 0.03 percentage
point, to 5.87 percent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  A person briefed on Pena Nieto’s energy proposal said he
would delay its release until next week, instead of today, as
lawmakers extend negotiations. People familiar with the matter
had said it would seek to bolster growth and lure investment by
amending the constitution to break  Petroleos Mexicanos ’s
monopoly on oil exploration and production. Mexico’s currency
and debt had rallied this month amid bets that Congress would
approve the measure.  “Postponing it is seen in a very bad light,” said Roberto Galvan, a currency trader at Intercam Casa de Bolsa SA in Mexico
City. “Everyone expected that today it would be presented and
that it was all good. To not do it, the market is wondering if
they’re just playing around.”  Francisco Arroyo, a lawmaker with Pena Nieto’s ruling party
and speaker of the lower house said in an interview with Radio
Formula that “they’re making the last adjustments and I
understand that with the intention of having the broadest
consensus possible.”  The peso’s selloff today is the biggest among 16 major
currencies tracked by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
