SunEdison Inc. (SUNE) , the solar power and
semiconductor maker formerly known as MEMC Electronic Materials
Inc., dropped the most in 14 months after reporting a loss
greater than analysts had expected.  SunEdison fell 24 percent to $7.39 at the close in New
York, the biggest drop since May 10, 2012. The shares had more
than quadrupled in the past year.  The net loss climbed to $102.9 million, or 45 cents a
share, from $77.2 million, or 33 cents, a year earlier, the St.
Peters, Missouri-based company said today in a statement. Thatâ€™s
more than the 18-cent average loss of six analyst estimates
compiled by Bloomberg.  SunEdison makes polysilicon wafers that can be used in
semiconductors and solar cells, and also develops and builds
solar power systems for homes and businesses.  To contact the reporter on this story:
