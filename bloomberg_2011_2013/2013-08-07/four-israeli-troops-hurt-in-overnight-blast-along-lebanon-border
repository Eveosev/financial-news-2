Four Israeli soldiers were injured in
an explosion along the border with Lebanon overnight, the
military said. Lebanon’s army said they were operating inside
Lebanese territory.  The Israeli military would not provide details about the
incident, which it said took place in the course of “overnight
activity.” The soldiers were lightly to moderately injured, it
said in a phone interview today.  Lebanon’s National News Agency, citing the country’s army,
said an Israeli foot patrol infiltrated 400 meters (yards) into
Lebanon just after midnight and triggered an explosive device.  While the border has been largely quiet since  Israel  and
Lebanese Hezbollah guerrillas fought a monthlong war in 2006,
Israel is worried Hezbollah might receive advanced arms from its
patron  Syria  amid the chaos of the Syrian civil war.  Israeli Prime Minister  Benjamin Netanyahu , referring to
the incident during a tour of a southern Israeli base, said his
country would “continue to act responsibly to defend Israel’s
borders.”  Lebanon’s caretaker foreign minister, Adnan Mansour,
condemned what he called a “flagrant violation of Lebanon’s
sovereignty” and said he would file a complaint with the  United
Nations .  To contact the reporter on this story:
