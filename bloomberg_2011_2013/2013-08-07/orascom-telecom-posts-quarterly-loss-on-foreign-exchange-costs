Orascom Telecom Holding SAE, the
biggest company on  Egypt ’s benchmark stocks index, posted a
second-quarter loss amid foreign exchange losses and financial
expenses.  The company reported a  net loss  of $28.1 million compared
with a profit of $26.5 million in the year-earlier period, it
said in a statement to the Regulatory News Service. Revenues
fell 3.3 percent to $903.8 million. The shares declined 0.9
percent to 4.59 Egyptian pounds at the close in Cairo, trimming
the gain this year to 16 percent.  “Our operations continued to be negatively impacted by
regulatory and government actions that are beyond our control
and decision,” Chief Executive Officer Ahmed Abou Doma said in
the statement. Results were hurt by local currency devaluations
in  Algeria  and Pakistan, he said.  Orascom, which merged with Russia’s  Vimpelcom Ltd. (VIP)  in 2011,
said it continues to face “challenges” in Algeria, its biggest
revenue generator and where it has been locked in an ownership
dispute with the government over the local unit since 2010.  Foreign exchange losses were $86 million and financial
expenses amounted to $126 million, the company said. Income from
Algeria’s Djezzy retreated 1.5 percent to $464.2 million, it
said. Subscribers in Orascom’s markets in Asia,  Africa  and N.
America increased 4 percent to 85.9 million.  To contact the reporter on this story:
