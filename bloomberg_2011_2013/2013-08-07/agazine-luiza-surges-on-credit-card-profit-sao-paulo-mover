Magazine Luiza SA (MGLU3) ,  Brazil ’s worst-performing retailer this year, rose the most on record as its
credit card unit’s profit exceeded the forecasts of Itau BBA.  Shares rallied 31 percent to 6.49 reais at 3:04 p.m. in Sao
Paulo, the biggest intraday gain since they started trading in
May 2011. It was the best performance on the BM&FBovespa Small
Cap index, which  declined  0.7 percent.  The Franca, Brazil-based retailer reported in a regulatory
filing yesterday that adjusted earnings before interest, taxes,
depreciation and amortization increased 14 percent to 95 million
reais ($41 million) for the quarter ended in June. Ebitda from
the LuizaCred credit card unit was 18.4 million reais, compared
with Itau’s projection of 7.4 million reais.  “Where the company most significantly surpassed our
estimates was at LuizaCred,” Itau analysts Vitor Paschoal and
Rachel Rodrigues wrote in a research note to clients.  The shares have plunged 45 percent this year and trade at
12.3 times analysts’ earnings estimates. That compares with a 17
percent decline in the BM&FBovespa Small Cap index, which trades
at a multiple of 17.5.  “We see Magazine Luiza as a high-risk, high-return
investment story, because we believe that the company could be
worth more than what the market is currently willing to pay, but
our visibility on its longer-term prospects is limited at this
point,” wrote Paschoal and Rodrigues, who have a recommendation
equivalent of buy on the stock.  To contact the reporter on this story:
