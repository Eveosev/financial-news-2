The biggest rally in U.S. stocks
since the 1990s technology bubble is poised to slow, with the
 Standard & Poor’s 500 Index (SPX)  adding 2.5 percent by the end of the
year, Birinyi Associates Inc. said.  Birinyi, among the first to advise buying American equities
before the advance began in 2009, said the  S&P 500  may set a new
high of 1,740 by December. The forecast implies a pause in the
benchmark gauge after a 19 percent surge this year.  “We are not suggesting a correction or a decline, but
instead that there will be a period of treading water,”  Laszlo Birinyi , president, and Jeffrey Yale Rubin, an analyst at the
firm, wrote in a report today.  The S&P 500 has jumped 150 percent since March 9, 2009 in
the biggest  bull market  since the index more than quadrupled
from 1990 to 1998, surpassing the rally that ended in 2007.
Stocks climbed this year as earnings exceeded analyst forecasts,
unemployment declined and the housing market improved. The S&P
500 surpassed Birinyi’s previous target of 1,600 in May and has
gained as much as 7 percent since then to set a record of
1,709.67 on Aug. 2.  The forecast from Westport, Connecticut-based Birinyi
compares with the 1,677 average of 17 Wall Street strategists
surveyed by Bloomberg, whose estimates range from 1,440 to
1,775. The S&P 500 declined 0.4 percent to 1,690.11 at 1:54 p.m.
