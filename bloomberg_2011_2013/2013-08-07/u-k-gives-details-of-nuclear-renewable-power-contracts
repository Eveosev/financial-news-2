The U.K. published details of
proposed power contracts for nuclear and renewable energy
generators in an effort to spur the 110 billion pounds ($170
billion) of investment it’s seeking through 2020.  Draft contract terms were spelled out in a 168-page
 document  posted today on the website of the Department of Energy
and  Climate Change , while the methodology for how contracts will
be awarded are detailed in a 46-page paper. They describe so-called contracts-for-difference that the government will use to
guarantee the power price paid to new plants.  The documents will provide some of the clarity sought by
U.K. utilities and project developers before they decide to
invest in new wind farms and nuclear power stations. While
ministers on June 27 published the prices they intend to pay
through to 2019 for power from different technologies, utilities
and industry lobby groups said then that more information was
needed before they could invest.  “No other sector is equal in scale to the British power
market, in terms of the opportunity that it offers to investors,
and the scale of the infrastructure challenge,” Business and
Energy Minister  Michael Fallon  said in a  statement . “The key
contract terms have been published in detail to provide the
energy sector and investment community with further certainty,
so they can get on and invest.”  Companies were invited to send feedback on the draft
contract terms, which the government will consider before
publishing final terms in December.  To contact the reporter on this story:
