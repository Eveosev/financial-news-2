The pound fell for a second day
versus the dollar as the Bank of England linked its outlook for
 interest rates  to unemployment and inflation, pledging to keep
current policy until the jobless rate falls to 7 percent.  Sterling fell against all except two of 16 major
counterparts as central bank governor  Mark Carney  holds a press
conference in  London  to outline the strategy. The central bank
said the 7 percent level is a threshold, not a “trigger,” and
will provide a point at which the Monetary Policy Committee will
reassess its stance. U.K. two-year government bonds rose, while
10-year gilts declined.  “The fact that he’s tied it to unemployment obviously
surprised a lot of people” and pushed the pound lower, said
Jane Foley, a senior foreign-exchange strategist at Rabobank
International in London. “He’s put in a very dovish slant to
the economic outlook, so definitely keeping things very
accommodative for a prolonged period.”  The pound dropped 0.4 percent to $1.5292 at 10:56 a.m.
London time after weakening as much as 0.9 percent. Sterling
depreciated 0.2 percent to 86.86 pence per euro.  The 10-year gilt yield climbed five basis points, or 0.05
percentage point, to 2.52 percent. The 1.75 percent bond due
September 2022 dropped 0.35, or 3.50 pounds per 1,000-pound face
amount, to 93.76.  The two-year yield fell one basis point to 0.37 percent.  Bank of England  officials also said they stand ready to
expand their bond-purchase program from the current 375 billion
pounds if needed. They also plan not to unwind quantitative
easing and will reinvest any cash flows from maturing gilts
while the jobless rate remains above the threshold.  To contact the reporter on this story:
