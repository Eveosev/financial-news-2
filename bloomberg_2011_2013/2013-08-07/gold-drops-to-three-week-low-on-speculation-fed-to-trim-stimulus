Gold futures rose, snapping the
longest slump in 11 weeks, as the dollar’s decline increased
demand for the metal as an alternative investment.  The Bloomberg  Dollar Index  slid 0.3 percent, heading for
the longest slide in seven weeks against a basket of 10
currencies. Gold has tumbled 23 percent this year, while the
greenback gauge has climbed 3.5 percent amid speculation that
the  Federal Reserve  will scale back U.S. debt purchases.  “The weaker dollar is helping gold,” Sterling Smith, a
Chicago-based commodity futures specialist at Citigroup Inc.,
said in a telephone interview. “The market will continue to
remain nervous until we get some clarity about the tapering
timetable” from the Fed, he said.  Gold futures for December delivery gained 0.2 percent to
settle at $1,285.30 an ounce at 2:07 p.m. on the Comex in New
York. Earlier, the price touched $1,271.80, the lowest for a
most-active contract since July 17. The metal dropped in the
previous six sessions, the longest slump since mid-May.  In July, gold rose 7.3 percent, the most since January
2012, after Fed Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said it’s too early to
decide whether to pare  asset buying  next month. Fed Bank of
Chicago President  Charles Evans , who has backed monetary
stimulus, said yesterday that the labor market showed “good
improvement,” and he indicated a cut in debt purchases may
begin in September.  Silver futures for September delivery dropped 0.1 percent
to $19.508 an ounce on the Comex. Earlier, the price touched
$19.10, the lowest since July 10.  On the  New York Mercantile Exchange , platinum futures for
October delivery climbed 0.7 percent to $1,438.30 an ounce, the
first gain in three days.  Palladium futures for September delivery rose 35 cents to
$723.15 an ounce.  To contact the reporter on this story:
