Indian (SENSEX)  stocks dropped for the second
day, led by automakers and consumer goods companies.  Tata Motors Ltd. (TTMT) , owner of Jaguar Land Rover, slid 2.8
percent ahead of its earnings report, leading a gauge of 11
automobile producers to a four-month low. Cigarette maker  ITC
Ltd. (ITC)  headed to a six-week low.  Tata Power Co. (TPWR) ,  India ’s biggest
non-state generator, extended yesterday’s 15 percent slump after
reporting a quarterly loss.  The S&P BSE Sensex retreated 0.8 percent to 18,582 at 9:48
a.m. in Mumbai, after changing directions four times. The rupee
weakened to a record low yesterday, spurring speculation the
central bank may tighten money supply further. The authority in
July increased two borrowing costs, curbed funding support for
banks and raised the daily reserve norms to shore up the rupee.  The rupee lost 0.8 percent to 61.29 per dollar today. The
currency touched an unprecedented 61.8063 yesterday.  Tata Motors may report today consolidated net income of
22.2 billion rupees ($363 million) in the quarter ended June,
from 22.4 billion rupees a year ago, according to the median of
39 analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  About 44 percent of Sensex companies that have reported
earnings so far for the June quarter missed analyst estimates.
That compares with 27 percent for the three months ended March,
and 43 percent in the quarter through December, data compiled by
Bloomberg show.  The Sensex has lost 4.2 percent this year and  trades  at
13.1 times projected 12-month earnings, compared with the MSCI
 Emerging Markets  Index’s 10 times.  Foreign investors  bought a net $24.8 million of domestic
shares on Aug. 5, a fifth straight day of net purchases, data
from the regulator show. That takes this year’s inflow to $12.4
billion, the second-biggest among 10 Asian markets tracked by
Bloomberg, the data show. Foreigners pulled $3 billion from
stocks and bonds last month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
