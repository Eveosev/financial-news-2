U.K. stocks  fell the most in more
than six weeks as Bank of England Governor Mark Carney said the
U.K.’s unemployment rate will probably remain above 7 percent
for the next three years.  Randgold Resources Ltd. (RRS)  slid 1.4 percent after second-quarter profit slumped 61 percent.  BHP Billiton Ltd. (BHP)  and Rio
Tinto Group contributed the most to a decline by U.K. commodity
producers.  Old Mutual Plc (OML)  advanced 2.9 percent after Africa’s
biggest insurer said profit rose 14 percent in the first half.  The  FTSE 100 Index (UKX)  slipped 93 points, or 1.4 percent, to
6,511.21 at the close in London. The equity benchmark has still
 rallied 8 percent  from a low on June 24 as the  Federal Reserve 
said it remains flexible on the pace of bond buying. The broader
FTSE All-Share Index lost 1.3 percent today, while Ireland’s
ISEQ Index fell 0.5 percent today.  “The BOE remarks were a bit disappointing,” Stewart Richardson, who helps oversee about $100 million as chief
investment officer at RMG Wealth Management LLP said by phone.
“To think that we can’t get unemployment down by more than 1
percent, with the stimulus and the low interest rates and the
improving economic data for the U.K., is a bit downbeat coming
from the BOE.”  The Bank of England said it will hold interest rates at a
record low until the  unemployment rate  falls to 7 percent from
its current level of 7.8 percent. The threshold will not
automatically trigger higher interest rates. New Governor  Mark
Carney  forecast that the jobless rate will remain above the 7
percent level until at least the third quarter of 2016.  Unemployment Threshold  The BOE  also said that it will not reduce the 375 billion
pounds ($582 billion)  stock of bonds  purchased using its
reserves until unemployment reaches the threshold level. The
central bank said it may reduce stimulus at any time if the
Monetary Policy Committee forecasts inflation of 2.5 percent or
more in the next 18 to 24 months. High inflation expectations in
the medium term and threats to financial stability may also
cause the bank to raise interest rates and reduce bond holdings.  Randgold slid 1.4 percent to 4,366 pence after reporting
second-quarter profit of $46.3 million, compared with $117.5
million a year earlier. Chief Executive Officer  Mark Bristow 
said the producer of gold in Africa has yet to decide whether it
needs to use a bank facility to complete its Kibali mine in the
Democratic Republic of the Congo.  A gauge of mining companies in the FTSE 350 slipped 1.5
percent. BHP Billiton dropped 1.6 percent to 1,844.5 pence and
Rio Tinto lost 1.5 percent to 2,953.5 pence.  TUI Travel Plc (TT/)  retreated 5.2 percent to 380.8 pence as
Europe’s largest tour operator said summer bookings declined 22
percent in France and 5 percent in Germany.  Old Mutual advanced 2.9 percent to 198.1 pence after
reporting first-half earnings of 555 million pounds, compared
with 487 million pounds a year earlier. The insurer increased
 its dividend  by 20 percent to 2.1 pence a share.  To contact the reporter on this story:
