Eurasian Natural Resources Corp. (ENRC) , the
metals producer that’s the subject of a takeover offer from its
founders and the Kazakh government, said ferrochrome and  iron-ore  production advanced as the units ran at full capacity.  Production of saleable ferroalloys, used in steelmaking,
rose to 386,000 metric tons in the second quarter from 377,000
tons a year earlier, ENRC said today in a statement. Iron-ore
extraction rose 9.9 percent to 10.9 million tons, and saleable
iron ore output advanced 21 percent to 4.3 million tons.  “Our operations in  Kazakhstan  and Africa have had an
excellent  quarter,” Chief Executive Officer Felix Vulis said
in the statement. “Production volumes are up year-on-year
across all of our key commodities, with the iron-ore division
having had its best quarter in three years.”  ENRC’s founders  Alexander Machkevitch , Patokh Chodiev and
Alijan Ibragimov in June offered $2.65 in cash and 0.23 of
 Kazakhmys Plc (KAZ)  stock for each share to take the company private.
Shareholders of Kazakhmys, which owns 26 percent in ENRC, last
week voted in favor of the transaction.  ENRC, which produces ferroalloys, iron ore, aluminum and
power in Kazakhstan, also owns copper and cobalt mines in
Africa. Production of saleable copper more than doubled to
22,685 tons in the quarter from 8,505 tons a year earlier,
according to the statement. Bauxite extraction advanced 2.8
percent to 1.35 million tons and alumina rose 8.5 percent to
408,000 tons, ENRC said. Aluminum output was 63,000 tons.  ENRC traces its roots to the founders’ participation in the
1990s privatizations of Kazakh state assets, which were
gradually combined into a single group of companies and listed
in  London  in 2007.  The company is under investigation by the U.K.’s Serious
Fraud Office over allegations of fraud, bribery and corruption
over its activities in Kazakhstan and Africa.  To contact the reporter on this story:
