European soccer’s ruling body  UEFA 
said it suspended two Armenian game officials in a Europa League
match-fixing case.  In a hearing at the Football Federation of Armenia, referee
Andranik Arsenyan and assistant Hovhannes Avagyan admitted
trying to fix a first qualifying round game last month between
Finland’s FC Inter Turku and Vikingur of the  Faroe Islands ,  UEFA
said .  UEFA’s betting fraud detection system, which monitors more
than 32,000 matches across Europe, detected suspicious betting
patterns around the game, prompting an investigation by UEFA and
the Armenian federation.  UEFA’s control and disciplinary body will hear the case at
its Nyon, Switzerland, headquarters on Aug. 22. Vikingur won the
second-leg match in Finland 1-0 for a 2-1 victory over two
games.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
