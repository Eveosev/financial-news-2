A PT Lion Mentari Airlines  Boeing Co. (BA) 
737-800 aircraft hit a cow after landing last night at a
regional airport in Indonesia.  The aircraft, landing in Gorontalo after flying in from
capital Jakarta with 110 passengers on board, encountered three
cows on the runway and the rear landing gear collided with one
of them, Leithen Francis, Lion Air Group spokesman, said in an
e-mailed statement. That affected steering, he said. Two people
were injured during evacuation, he said.  In April, a Lion Air passenger plane with 108 people on
board crashed into the sea off the Indonesian resort island of
Bali on landing at Ngurah Rai International Airport, according
to the airport’s operator. No deaths were reported.  Lion Air,  Indonesia ’s biggest private carrier, has placed
orders for more than $45 billion with Airbus SAS and Boeing in
the past two years and has the world’s biggest order backlog for
559 narrow-body aircraft. It aims to have 1,000 planes in 10
years.  To contact the reporters on this story:
