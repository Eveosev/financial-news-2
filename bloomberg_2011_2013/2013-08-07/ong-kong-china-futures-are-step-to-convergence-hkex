Futures linked to the CES  China  120
Index are a step toward the convergence of stock markets in  Hong
Kong  and China, according to an official from Hong Kong
Exchanges & Clearing Ltd.  Futures tied to the gauge, which tracks the most liquid
stocks listed in Hong Kong,  Shanghai  and Shenzhen, will begin
trading in the special administrative region on Aug. 12. They
will be the first derivative product that gives investors
exposure to companies listed in both Hong Kong and China, said
Calvin Tai, co-head of equities, fixed income and currencies at
Hong Kong Exchanges, at a media briefing in Hong Kong today.  “Eventually the three markets will converge,” Tai said.
“Not necessarily the exchanges, but the markets.”  The CES China 120 Index is maintained by China Exchanges
Services Co., the joint venture between Hong Kong Exchanges and
the two biggest mainland bourse operators formed last year as
the companies seek to boost investment flows between the two
markets. The gauge slumped 12 percent in 2013 through yesterday
amid concern about slowing growth and a funding squeeze in the
world’s second-largest economy.  The exchange will offer futures expiring in August,
September, December and March. There will be no commission levy
on the products for the first six months of trading, according
to a statement from the exchange, which is planning to introduce
options on the same underlying index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
