Gold investments through exchange-traded products dropped $30.9 billion this year through July, as
subdued expectations for inflation eroded demand for the
precious metal as a hedge,  BlackRock Inc. (BLK)  said.  Gold outflows totaled $2.6 billion last month, extending
withdrawals of $4.3 billion in June, BlackRock said in an e-mailed report today. Net-outflows from commodity ETP investments
this year reached $31.6 billion, after withdrawals of $2.2
billion in July.  Inflation rates tracked by the U.S. Commerce Department are
running below the  Federal Reserve ’s 2 percent target. The Fed
said last week it would maintain its $85 billion bond-buying
program, while warning persistently low inflation could hamper
economic expansion. Gold has tumbled 24 percent this year amid
speculation the Fed would taper its stimulus program.  “Continued modest inflation readings have lessened gold’s
appeal as an inflation hedge,” Dodd Kittsley, head of BlackRock
ETP research, said in today’s report. Recent outflows have been
“building on an exodus that started in January.”  ETP  holdings  in gold totaled 1,957.76 metric tons as of
yesterday, the lowest since May 2010, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg. The precious metal reached a three-week low in
 London  today at $1,273.02 an ounce.  To contact the reporter on this story:
