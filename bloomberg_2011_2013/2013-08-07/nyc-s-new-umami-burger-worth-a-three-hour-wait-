New York's food blogosphere blew up in December when the Los Angeles-based Umami Burger—the chain that forever  "changed the burger game" — announced they'd be opening a New York outpost in the city's Greenwich Village neighborhood. Fast forward seven months, and New York City's first Umami Burger has finally descended—upon crowds of eager New Yorkers, some of whom lined up as early as 11 a.m. on Monday morning to try the  "finest burger in all the land." Naturally, we too, had to assess this allegedly game-changing burger—the burger Alan Richman himself described as  "half beef, half beyond belief."  (Could it possibly be better than Chef Bloomfield's?  Than the Black Label Burger? ). So on Tuesday evening—the day after opening—we made our way down to 432 Sixth Avenue, determined to get to the bottom of this madness, crowds be damned. "The wait time is three hours," was our glum greeting, from one of the 30-odd people spilling from the shopfront and onto the sidewalk. He was wrong: that was  after  you'd already waited in a 20-minute line to be placed onto the the three hour wait list. Once on the list, you were texted a link that allowed you to track how many parties were to be seated before you. We counted 63. Three hours, 20 minutes, and a complimentary pair of bright orange Umami Burger sunglasses later, our party of four was seated. We ordered two Classic Umami Burgers, two Truffle Burgers, and truffle fries to share. And then we waited, again. The fries came to the table first, and they made us sad. Lukewarm and almost limp, they were glued together by a congealed, paste-like substance that might have once been gooey, melted truffle cheese. They tasted great—salty, cheesy, truffle-y, exactly how you'd expect truffle fries to taste—but really, they were the saddest things you ever saw. But we weren't here for the fries, right? We came for this: The Truffle Burger (pictured above) was great: grilled to a perfect medium rare with a crisp, caramelized crust. The palm-sized Portugese bun was toasted gently and slightly sweet; the meat was topped with truffle cheese, truffle glaze, and an earthy garlic aioli. Although I liked the burger—a lot—I also found it a little too rich for my tastes. I thought the truffle flavor would be more subtle, taking a backseat to the meat, but I found it overpowering. It's all a matter of preference, but I like my burgers simple: perfectly cooked meat, onions and bread—and that's about it. If you're somewhat of a burger purist, Umami's Truffle Burger may overwhelm you. If you're anyone else (and if you're really into truffles) you'll totally love this. The Classic Umami, however, was amazing. It, too, had a lot going on—shiitake mushrooms, caramelized onions, a parmesan crisp, toasted tomato and a mushroomy, umami ketchup—but each bite was somehow just right. It was just a  really good burger. But was it the best burger ever? Was it worth the three-hour wait? I would say no and no. Both burgers were fantastic and flavorful and exciting. Game-changing, even. But neither were the best I'd ever tried, nor did they come close to Minetta Tavern's  Black Label Burger —which, in contrast, essentially comprises just two ingredients: meat and onions, done to perfection. Bottom line? I really liked Umami Burger and I'm thrilled they've come to the East Coast. But call me when In-N-Out comes to town.  432 6th Ave; 212-677-8626
