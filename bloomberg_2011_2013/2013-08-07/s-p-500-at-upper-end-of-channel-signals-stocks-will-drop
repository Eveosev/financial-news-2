 The  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index (SPX)  may
fall as much as 8.7 percent after the gauge climbed to the upper
limit of a trend known as a rising channel, according to a
technical analyst at ING Groep NV.  The S&P 500 will decline to a support level of 1,540 after
it advanced to 1,709.67 on Aug. 2, Roelof-Jan van den Akker said
in a telephone interview from Amsterdam. He drew a rising
channel on a graph of weekly prices for the U.S. equity
benchmark and identified the support level by looking back at
the index’s previous peaks in 2001 and 2007. The S&P 500 will
rebound following the decline.  “Prices have approached the upper end of the longer-term
rising-trend channel around 1,710,” Van den Akker said. “The
S&P has had fantastic gains in the past few months and now it’s
too stretched and ready for just a normal correction. I believe
when the S&P is falling then other markets will follow,”  The  S&P 500   rose 20 percent  from the start of 2013 through
Aug. 2. The equity benchmark slid 0.6 percent to 1,686.74 at
11:43 a.m. in  New York .  In technical analysis, investors and analysts study graphs
