Steel reinforcement-bar futures in
 Shanghai  climbed for a sixth day to trade near the highest level
in almost two weeks after the price of  iron ore  advanced.  Rebar for January delivery on the Shanghai Futures Exchange
gained as much as 0.2 percent to 3,698 yuan ($604) a metric ton,
the highest for a most-active contract since July 25, and was at
3,693 yuan at 10:48 a.m. local time.  Iron ore  for immediate delivery rose 0.9 percent to $131.40
a ton yesterday, according to a  price index  compiled by The
Steel Index Ltd. Stockpiles of imported ore at major Chinese
ports declined 2.9 percent in the seven days to Aug. 5 from a
week earlier as market demand began to pick up, according to a
report yesterday from Xinhua News Agency, citing its research.  “Stable iron ore prices give some support to the steel
market,” said Huang Huiwen, an analyst at Shanghai CIFCO
Futures Co. “Steel prices were also buoyed by de-stocking
demand from downstream industries.”  The average spot price of rebar advanced 0.5 percent to
3,466  yuan  a ton yesterday, according to Beijing Antaike
Information Development Co.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
