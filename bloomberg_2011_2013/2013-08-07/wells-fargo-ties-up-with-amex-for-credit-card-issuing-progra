Wells Fargo & Co. (WFC)  will tie up with
 American Express Co. (AXP) , the world’s biggest credit card issuer by
purchases, to offer cards accepted on American Express’s network
of merchants.  Wells Fargo, the largest U.S. home lender, will begin a
pilot program in select U.S. markets in the third quarter of
2013 before offering all customers a full program starting in
the first half of 2014, the companies said in a joint statement.
Financial terms of the agreement weren’t disclosed.  “We are delivering on our strategy to expand our credit
card business,”  John Stumpf , chief executive officer of San
Francisco-based Wells Fargo, said in the statement. “Our goal
is to offer Wells Fargo customers a suite of cards that help
them meet their financial goals.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
