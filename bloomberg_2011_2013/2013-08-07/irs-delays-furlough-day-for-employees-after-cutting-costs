 The U.S. Internal Revenue Service
announced that it would delay a furlough day for employees
scheduled for Aug. 30, citing “substantial progress in cutting
costs.”  In an e-mail sent today to IRS employees, acting leader
Danny Werfel said officials would decide next month whether the
tax agency needs to reschedule the furlough day then.  “Our progress is such that we have decided to postpone the
furlough day scheduled for Aug. 30,” Werfel said in the e-mail.
“We still have more work to do on the budget and cost savings,
so we will re-evaluate in early September and make a final
determination as to whether we will need another furlough day in
September.”  The IRS is one of a number of government entities
furloughing employees to absorb automatic spending cuts, known
as sequestration, that began March 1. The agency was closed for
three days between May 24 and July 5.  Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel announced yesterday that the
Pentagon was reducing to six days from 11 the furlough days that
85 percent of its civilian employees must take this fiscal year
because of the automatic cuts.  The IRS previously canceled a furlough day scheduled for
July 22.  To contact the reporter on this story:
