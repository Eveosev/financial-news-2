Andritz AG (ANDR) , the world’s second-biggest maker of hydro-power turbines, fell the most in three
months after second-quarter profit missed estimates and the
company warned that full-year earnings will drop.  The stock slumped 7.9 percent to 39.095 euros, the biggest
drop since May 2, making Graz, Austria-based Andritz the worst
performer in the 298-company Euro Stoxx index today. Net income
fell 27 percent to 42.8 million euros ($57 million) in the
quarter through June, missing the average analyst  estimate  of
48.5 million euros, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  “We expect investment activity in our key customer
industries to remain subdued worldwide,” Chief Executive
Officer Wolfgang Leitner said in a statement. Full-year net
income “will be significantly lower than the last year,” the
company said.  While Andritz’s consolidation of  Schuler AG (SCUN)  lifted revenue,
the German metal company it acquired last year couldn’t make up
for the group’s falling profitability. Decreased earnings in the
company’s pulp and paper unit led the profit decline, Andritz
said in a statement today.  “The margin decline is predominantly caused by severe
margin erosion in the pulp and paper business,” Henning Breiter, an analyst at Hauck & Aufhaeuser, wrote in a note to
clients. “We are concerned that the weaker P&P margins could
stay below 6 percent given price pressure in the market.”  Andritz had warned on April 30 that profit would fall this
year after cost overruns at a pulp mill being built in  South
America .  To contact the reporter on this story:
