U.S. farmers are poised to reap their
biggest-ever corn crop, expanding global stockpiles to the most
in 13 years and spurring  hedge funds  and other speculators to
make record bets that prices will keep slumping.  The harvest in the largest grower will jump 30 percent to
14.036 billion bushels (356.5 million metric tons), the average
of 27 analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg shows. That’s 53
million bushels more than they expected a month ago and 86
million above the government’s July forecast. Record crops from
the U.S. to  Brazil  to Ukraine will expand world inventories by
23 percent to 152.36 million tons in a year, according to the
average of 12 predictions.  Surging supply spurred analysts from Goldman Sachs Group
Inc. to cut their price forecasts this week and R.J. O’Brien &
Associates in  Chicago , the U.S. grain-trading hub, says futures
may drop as much as 24 percent to $3.50 a bushel this year.
Speculators turned bearish a month ago for the first time since
2010 as crops recover from last season’s drought and farmers
planted the most acres since 1936.  “We are going to switch from wind blowing through empty
grain bins to piles of corn laying on the ground,” said  Diana Klemme , a vice president at Grain Service Corp., an adviser and
broker in Atlanta. “It is possible to see sub-$4 corn,” a
price last seen in 2010, she said.  Billion Bushels  Futures dropped 34 percent to $4.5975 on the Chicago Board
of Trade this year, reaching a 34-month low of $4.55 on Aug. 6.
Corn is the biggest decliner in the Standard & Poor’s GSCI Spot
Index of 24 commodities, which retreated 2.9 percent. The MSCI
All-Country World Index of equities rose 11 percent and the
Bloomberg U.S. Treasury Bond index lost 2.6 percent.  Goldman’s analysts lowered their three-month forecast to
$4.25 from $4.75 in a report Aug. 6 and said U.S. production
would probably reach 14.138 billion bushels as yields rebound 30
percent to the second-highest ever. Analysts at Rabobank
International last month cut their first-quarter forecast to
$4.40 from $4.80 in June.  The  U.S. Department of Agriculture  updates its estimates
for global crop production, demand and stockpiles at noon in
 Washington  on Aug. 12.  Meat Processor  Cheaper corn is boosting profit for buyers including
 Archer-Daniels-Midland Co. (ADM) , the largest processor of the grain,
and Tyson Foods Inc., the biggest U.S. meat processor. Declining
feed costs should also help curb global meat prices, which rose
to within about 2 percent of a record in June, according to data
from the  United Nations ’ Food & Agriculture Organization in
 Rome .  Hedge funds and other large speculators increased their
net-short position, or bets on lower prices, for two consecutive
weeks to 108,089 futures and options, U.S. Commodity Futures
Trading Commission data show. A futures contract represents
5,000 bushels. Their net-long holdings peaked last year at
342,893 contracts in August as the U.S. endured its worst
drought since the 1930s and prices reached a record $8.49.  The scale of bearish  bets  presents a risk because it makes
it harder to find more sellers, Morgan Stanley analysts wrote in
a report Aug. 5. Signs are “building that a corn correction
could be ripening” and export sales of this year’s crop are
running at the fastest pace in a decade, they said.  Crop Development  Weather could still disrupt the development of the crop and
curb yields. Heavier-than-normal rain delayed planting in parts
of the Midwest, the biggest producing region, in May and June.
Cooler temperatures may slow growth and increases the risk of
frost, Morgan Stanley said. Harvesting already started in Texas
and  Louisiana  and should start in late September in the Midwest.  Slumping prices should also spur demand limiting gains in
stockpiles. Global consumption jumped 6.6 percent in 2008, the
most since 1987, as futures tumbled almost 11 percent, USDA data
show. Some livestock producers added more wheat to feed rations
last year as corn surged to a record. Wheat for December
delivery is trading at a $1.98 premium to corn for the same
month, compared with an average discount of $1.26 last year,
bourse data compiled by Bloomberg show.  About 64 percent of the corn crops in the 18 biggest
producing U.S. states were in good or excellent  condition  on
Aug. 4, above the 10-year average of 59 percent, the USDA said
this week. A sampling of fields by Doane Advisory Services Co.
this month showed farms producing 30,500 ears of corn per acre,
above the record 30,200 set in 2011.  Lower Prices  “A 14 billion-bushel crop is a foregone conclusion,” said
John Cory, the chief executive officer of Prairie Mills Products
LLC, a grain processor in Rochester,  Indiana . “There is no
reason to be in a hurry to buy corn. I’m not the only consumer
that will wait for lower prices.”  ADM, which makes  animal feed , sweetener and ethanol, is
“optimistic” about margins in 2014 and 2015 because of rising
corn supply, Chief Operating Officer Juan Luciano said on a
conference call Aug. 6. Shares of the Decatur, Illinois-based
company jumped 38 percent this year.  Tyson Foods (TSN)  will report a 37 percent gain in profit to
$797.6 million this year according to the mean of eight analysts
estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Shares of the Springdale,
Arkansas-based company rose 59 percent this year. Tyson handled
an average of 41.4 million chickens, 403,000 hogs and 132,000
head of cattle last year, data on its website show.  Corn production is also rising around the world after
prices averaged a record $6.8894 last year, compared with about
$3.62 over the previous decade. Output outside the U.S. will
advance 4.2 percent to an all-time high of 605.5 million tons,
the USDA estimates. China, Argentina and Ukraine are among those
the department expects to reap the most grain ever.  Farmland Costs  U.S. farmers earned more than $112 billion in each of the
past two years, and the USDA is anticipating a record $128.2
billion in 2013. That also boosted the price of farmland in
 Illinois ,  Iowa , Indiana, Missouri and  Ohio  by 79 percent since
2009, the department estimates. Declining grain prices are
curbing cash returns and diminishing sales of cropland, said Jim Farrell, the president of Farmers National Co. in Omaha, which
manages farms in the Midwest.  “In commodities the price pendulum swings to extremes,”
said John Setterdahl, the senior vice president for grain
marketing and logistics at FC Cooperative Co. in Ames, Iowa, the
largest farmer-owned cooperative in the state. “Last year the
pendulum swung to a record high. It may go lower than people
expect this year.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
