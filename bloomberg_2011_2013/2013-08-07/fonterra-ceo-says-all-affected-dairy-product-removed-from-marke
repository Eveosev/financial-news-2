Fonterra Cooperative Group Ltd. said
all dairy product affected by a potentially contaminated
ingredient has been located and removed from the market.  “All stocks have been contained, everything is out of the
market,” Fonterra Chief Executive Officer Theo Spierings said
at a news conference in Auckland today. “There is little or no
more risk for consumers.”  Fonterra, the world’s biggest dairy exporter, said on Aug.
3 that a dirty pipe at a processing plant may have tainted whey
protein used in goods such as baby formula with botulism-causing
bacteria. The warning prompted  China  and Russia to halt imports
of some Fonterra products and caused a spate of recalls in
China, Vietnam,  Thailand ,  Sri Lanka  and  New Zealand . Spierings
flew to China in an effort to limit fallout in what he called
Fonterra’s “most important market.”  “I said in China that I would not leave China before the
situation is stable, from the perspective of markets, consumers,
customers and global authorities,” he said today. “The
situation is stable.”  Spierings said Fonterra will hold an inquiry into the
incident. Asked whether he should resign, he said that was a
question for Fonterra’s board.  “I do understand the anxiety and distress this issue has
caused,” he said. “I do apologize to consumers and to the
public.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
