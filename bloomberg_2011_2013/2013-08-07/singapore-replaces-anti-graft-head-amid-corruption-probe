Singapore  said it will replace the
head of its anti-corruption agency to help maintain trust after
an assistant director was charged with misappropriation.  Eric Tan will be replaced as director of the Corruption
Practices Investigation Bureau when his term ends Sept. 30,
according to a  statement  yesterday from Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong’s Office.  Supervisory lapses under Tan and former anti-graft chief
Soh Kee Hean resulted in deficiencies in financial controls,
according to the statement. Both Tan and Soh have been issued
formal warning letters and have accepted responsibility, Lee’s
office said.  Singapore vowed to take “strong measures” after Edwin Yeo
was charged last month with fraud and corruption over the
misappropriation of S$1.7 million ($1.3 million). Lee ordered a
government panel to probe the case and tighten financial
controls.  The anti-corruption agency didn’t immediately reply to an
e-mail seeking comment.  Wong Hong Kuan , Chief Executive of the Singapore Workforce
Development will join the anti-corruption bureau as director
designate on Sept. 1. Wong was a former deputy police
commissioner until 2010.  The criminal case is Public Prosecutor v Yeo Seow Hiong
Edwin. DAC028332-DAC028352/2013. Singapore Subordinate Courts.  To contact the reporter on this story:
