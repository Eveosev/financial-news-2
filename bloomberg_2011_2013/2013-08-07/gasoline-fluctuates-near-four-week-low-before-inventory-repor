Gasoline fluctuated near a four-week
low before the government reports last week’s U.S. inventories.  Futures swung between gains and losses as  inventories  in
the week ended July 25 were the highest seasonally since at
least 1990, according to Energy Information Administration data.
The EIA will probably say today that gasoline stockpiles fell
500,000 barrels last week as refinery rates dropped 0.3 percent
to 91 percent, according to the median estimate of 11 analysts
in a survey by Bloomberg.  “Seasonally, it’s weak, but we have fallen pretty hard on
gasoline,” said  Phil Flynn , vice president of research at
PFGBest in Chicago. “Some people are probably covering shorts
ahead of the inventory levels.”  Gasoline for September delivery fell 0.22 cent to $2.9129 a
gallon at 10:03 a.m. on the  New York  Mercantile Exchange, after
touching $2.8906. Trading volume was 13 percent below the 100-day average.  The EIA is scheduled to report last week’s inventories at
10:30 a.m. today in  Washington . The industry-funded  American
Petroleum Institute  was said to report yesterday that gasoline
stockpiles fell 1 million barrels last week.  “High inventory levels combined with no tropical storms on
the horizon are pressuring gasoline prices as the driving season
winds down over the next few weeks,” said  Andy Lipow , president
of Lipow Oil Associates LLC in Houston.  Crack Spreads  The motor fuel’s  crack spread  versus West Texas
Intermediate crude fell 1 cent to $17.12 a barrel. Gasoline’s
 premium  over Brent rose 43 cents to $14.68.  Pump prices , averaged nationwide, slipped 0.8 cent to $3.60
a gallon, Heathrow, Florida-based AAA said today on its website.
Prices are 3.4 cents below a year ago.  Distillate stockpiles, including heating oil and diesel,
probably held steady, the survey showed. The API reported
distillates increased 1.5 million barrels, according to a person
familiar with the data.  Ultra-low-sulfur diesel for September delivery declined
2.27 cents, or 0.8 percent, to $2.9856 a gallon on trading
volume that was 39 percent above the 100-day average.  ULSD’s  crack spread  versus West Texas Intermediate crude
slipped 93 cents to $20.12 a barrel. The  premium over Brent  fell
50 cents to $17.67.  To contact the reporter on this story:
