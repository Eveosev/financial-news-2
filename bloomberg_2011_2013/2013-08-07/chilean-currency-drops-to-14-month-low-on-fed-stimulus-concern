Chile ’s peso declined to a 14-month
low amid speculation that the U.S. Federal Reserve will slow
stimulus this year.  The currency depreciated 0.1 percent to 515.46 per  U.S.
dollar  at the close in Santiago, the weakest level since June
2012. The peso touched a level weaker than 800 per pound for the
first time since June 2012.  “Economists may differ on when the stimulus will end, but
sooner or later it’s ending, which means the dollar is gaining
against emerging-market currencies,” Eugenio Cortes, the head
of currency forwards at EuroAmerica Corredores de Bolsa SA in
Santiago, said in a phone interview. “The trend is for
depreciation.”  U.S. Treasury 10-year note yields climbed 0.82 percentage
points in the past three months while Chilean yields were little
changed, eroding the profit from borrowing in dollars and
investing in pesos. Cleveland Fed President  Sandra Pianalto  said
today a tapering of the U.S. central bank’s stimulus may be
warranted if the labor market continues to strengthen.  Chile’s central bank will cut its target lending rate by a
quarter-percentage point to 4.75 percent on Aug. 13, according
to the median forecast of economists surveyed by Bloomberg. A
reduction would be the first since January 2012.  Chile sold $3.35 billion of copper in July, the lowest
level since March. The metal made up 52 percent of the country’s
exports last month. The nation posted a $254 million  trade
deficit  in July, the biggest since October 2012.  To contact the reporter on this story:
