Green Mountain  Coffee Roasters Inc.,
maker of Keurig single-serve pods and machines, fell in  New York 
after reporting declining coffee brewer sales in its fiscal
third quarter.  The shares dropped 3.5 percent to $76.48 at the close.
Green Mountain, based in Waterbury,  Vermont , has  gained  85
percent this year, while the Standard & Poor’s Midcap 400 Index
has advanced 21 percent.  Brewer and accessory sales dropped 4.3 percent to $133.1
million in the three months ended June 29, Green Mountain said
in a statement yesterday. Sales growth of single-serve packs
slowed to 18 percent in the quarter from 21 percent in the prior
three months.  Chief Executive Officer Brian Kelley has been trying to
lure Americans with higher-end coffee brewers and new varieties
of K-Cups as competitors introduce less expensive single-cup
pods. Green Mountain, which has seen its sales growth slow this
year, announced in July an agreement with Cinnabon to make
cinnamon-roll flavored coffee cups for Keurig machines.  Net income  rose 59 percent to $116.3 million, or 76 cents a
share, from $73.3 million, or 46 cents, a year earlier, Green
Mountain said. Excluding certain items, profit was 82 cents a
share. Analysts projected 76 cents, the average of 12 estimates
compiled by Bloomberg.  “Our total revenue growth of 11 percent was at the low end
of our expectations, driven primarily by a sales decline in
 Canada ,” Kelley said in the statement. “Importantly, our U.S.
business is very healthy.”  The company  forecast  adjusted earnings of 69 cents to 74
cents a share in the fourth quarter. It projected an increase in
sales of 11 percent to 15 percent, which would give a range of
$1.05 billion to $1.09 billion, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. Analysts on average projected 71.5 cents on revenue
of $1.02 billion.  To contact the reporter on this story:
