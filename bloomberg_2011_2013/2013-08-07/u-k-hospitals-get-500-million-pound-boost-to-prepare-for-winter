The U.K. government is providing 500
million pounds ($775 million) to National Health Service
hospitals over the next two years to help their accident and
emergency departments cope with winter illnesses.  The cash -- 250 million pounds this year and next -- will
be targeted at “pinch points” that are most at risk of running
into capacity difficulties, the  Department of Health  said in an
e-mailed statement.  “With over a million more people visiting A&E in the last
three years, services and staff can find themselves under
pressure during the busier winter period,” Prime Minister  David Cameron  said. “The additional funding will go to hospitals
where the pressure will be greatest, with a focus on practical
measures that relieve pinch points in local services.”  Cameron’s government suffered a setback to its program to
overhaul the health service last week when the  High Court  ruled
that its decision to cut accident and emergency and maternity
services at Lewisham Hospital in south London was illegal. The
court ruled that Health Secretary  Jeremy Hunt  overstepped his
powers when he overruled local health professionals to make
the cuts.  To contact the reporter on this story:
