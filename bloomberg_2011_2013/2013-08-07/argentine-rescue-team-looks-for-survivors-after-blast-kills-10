Rescue workers in the Argentine city
of Rosario are searching through rubble as 12 people remain
missing after a gas explosion yesterday killed at least 10,
Mayor Monica Fein told reporters today.  City authorities canceled classes in 11 schools near the
site of the blast, which also injured more than 60 people.
President  Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner  has declared two days
of national mourning, her spokesman Alfredo Scoccimarro told
reporters today in Buenos Aires.  Two plumbers who were working in the residential building
where the explosion occurred were detained for questioning,
newspaper La Nacion reported, citing Judge Juan Carlos Curto.
Some witnesses said one of the workers, Carlos Garcia, fled the
building before the blast occurred, the paper said, citing
Curto.  Garcia has 20 years of expertise working with natural gas
installations, his lawyer Hugo Bufarini said in an interview
with TN television without elaborating on his client’s actions
before the blast. He didn’t immediately return a phone call from
Bloomberg seeking comment.  Litoral Gas SA supplies natural gas to  Santa Fe  and the
northeast of  Buenos Aires  province. Tibsa Inversora, which owns
92 percent of Litoral Gas, is owned by SUEZ-Tractebel SA and the
Techint Group. The remaining 8 percent is owned by individuals
shareholders, including workers and former employees, according
to the company’s  website .  To contact the reporter on this story:
