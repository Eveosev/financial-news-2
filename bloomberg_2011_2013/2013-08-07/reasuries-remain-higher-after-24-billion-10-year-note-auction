Treasuries advanced for the first
time in three days as a $24 billion sale of 10-year securities
at yields almost at the highest level at an auction of the
maturity in two years boosted demand.  The benchmark notes gained after the auction produced a
yield of 2.620 percent, compared with a forecast of 2.635
percent in a Bloomberg News survey of eight of the Federal
Reserve’s 21 primary dealers.  Indirect bidders , an investor
class that includes foreign central banks, purchased 46.3
percent of the notes, compared with an average of 37.1 percent
for the past 10 sales. Treasury will auction $16 billion in 30-year bonds tomorrow.  “Demand at the auction from investors was there across the
board,” said Thomas di Galoma, head of U.S. rates sales at ED&F
Man Capital Markets in New York. “Generally, it was a pretty
decent auction.  The  yield  on the current 10-year note fell four basis
points, or 0.04 percentage point, to 2.60 percent, at 5:02 p.m.
in New York, according to Bloomberg Bond Trader Prices. The 1.75
percent note due in May 2023 rose 11/32, or $3.44 per $1,000
face amount, to 92 23/32.  Auction Detail  The previous 10-year auction on July 10 drew a yield of
2.67 percent, the highest level since July 2011.  Direct bidders, non-primary-dealer investors that place
their bids directly with the Treasury, purchased 15.2 percent of
the notes at the sale, compared with an average of 22.3 percent
for the past 10 auctions.  The bid-to-cover ratio, which gauges demand by comparing
total bids with the amount of securities offered, was 2.45, the
lowest since March 2009 and compared with an average of 2.81 for
the past 10 sales.  “The performance of the auction suggests that we are
probably at the high end of the price spectrum, especially
because we are stating down the barrel of the $16 billion in 30-year debt sales tomorrow,” said Thomas Simons, a government-debt economist in New York at Jefferies LLC, a primary dealer.
“Tomorrow’s sale should give us further direction.”  Investors bid $2.91 for each dollar of the $1.313 trillion
in U.S. government notes and bonds sold at auction this year,
according to Treasury data compiled by Bloomberg. That’s down
from the record $3.15 for the $2.153 trillion sold at last
year’s offerings.  Debt Returns  Ten-year notes have lost 6 percent this year, compared with
a 2.9 percent drop in the broader U.S. Treasuries market,
according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch indexes. The
benchmark notes returned 4.2 percent in 2012, versus a 2.2
percent gain by Treasuries overall.  Today’s offering is the second of three note and bond
auctions this week totaling $72 billion. The government sold $32
billion in three-year debt yesterday.  The sales will raise $2.4 billion of new cash, as maturing
securities held by the public total $69.6 billion, according to
the U.S. Treasury.  “This is a decent sign for the market, which is attempting
to stabilize in this newer rate range as we creep towards
September and the Fed’s expected tapering,” John Briggs, a U.S.
government-bond strategist at RBS Securities Inc. in  Stamford ,
 Connecticut , a primary dealer, wrote in a note to clients. The
success of the sale “bodes well for tomorrow’s 30 year
auction.”  Yield Forecast  Ten-year note yields will rise to 2.75 percent by the end
of the year, according to 63 economists surveyed by Bloomberg
News from Aug. 2 to Aug 6. Yields on the 30-year bond will rise
to 3.75 percent, according to a survey of 38 economists during
the same period.  Fed Bank of Cleveland President Sandra Pianalto said there
has been “meaningful improvement” in the labor market and that
a tapering of the central bank’s bond-buying program may be
warranted if it continues to strengthen. The unemployment rate
fell to 7.4 percent in July from 7.6 percent the previous month,
the Labor Department reported Aug. 2.  “Employment growth has been stronger than I was expecting,
and the unemployment rate today is more than half a percent
lower than I projected it to be last September,” Pianalto told
an audience in  Cleveland  today. “In light of this progress, and
if the labor market remains on the stronger path that it has
followed since last fall, then I would be prepared to scale back
the monthly pace of asset purchases.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
