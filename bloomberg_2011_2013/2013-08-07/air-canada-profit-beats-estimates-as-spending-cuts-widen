Air Canada (AC/B)  surged the most in more
than four years after it reported second-quarter profit that
topped analysts’ estimates as fuel costs dropped, and said
spending this year will decline more than forecast.  The Class B shares jumped 25 percent to C$2.65 at the close
in Toronto, the biggest one-day gain since May 7, 2009. The
stock rose 51 percent this year while  Canada ’s benchmark
Standard & Poor’s/TSX Composite Index was down 0.2 percent.  Excluding some costs and gains, net income was C$115
million ($110.4 million), or 41 cents a share, beating the 13-cent average of seven analyst estimates  compiled  by Bloomberg.
On that basis, the loss a year earlier was C$7 million, or 2
cents, the Montreal-based airline said today in a statement.  Earnings were “nothing short of spectacular,” marking “a
true turnaround in the most despised sector of the market,”  Bob Decker , a  fund manager  in Toronto at Aurion Capital Management,
said by e-mail. He holds stock in Air Canada, the country’s
biggest airline, among the C$6 billion in assets he helps
manage.  Chief Executive Officer Calin Rovinescu is working to
reduce costs by about 15 percent in the medium term with the
help of higher-density aircraft, new maintenance agreements and
the July start of the Rouge leisure unit. Air Canada said today
that seat costs per mile flown will shrink by 1 percent to 2
percent in 2013, exceeding an April 22 forecast that called for
a reduction of 0.5 percent to 1.5 percent.  Cost Forecast  Costs in the quarter excluding fuel declined 1.4 percent
from a year earlier, in line with a forecast calling for a drop
of a much as 1.5 percent. Spending on that basis in the three
months through September will fall 1.5 percent to 2.5 percent,
the carrier said.  The results “are a clear indication that we are gaining
momentum in our transformation towards sustainable profitability
at  Air Canada (AC/A)  and underscore our companywide efforts to achieve
cost containment and continue to improve on our revenue and
yield performance,” Rovinescu said in the statement.  Air Canada spent C$831 million on aircraft fuel in the
second quarter, 6 percent less than in the 2012 period.
Depreciation, amortization and impairment costs tumbled 22
percent to C$130 million, the company said in a filing.  Operating revenue climbed 2.3 percent from a year earlier
to C$3.06 billion, topping the C$3.02 billion average estimate.
Passenger revenue per mile flown rose 0.9 percent.  Including a
foreign-exchange cost of C$74 million because of a declining
Canadian dollar, the net loss narrowed to C$23 million, or 9
cents a share, from C$161 million, or 59 cents, a year earlier.  Capacity Plans  Available seat miles will increase by 1.5 percent to 2.5
percent this year, Air Canada said today, reiterating an earlier
forecast. Capacity will jump 9 percent to 11 percent next year
with the addition of five  Boeing Co. (BA)  777 airliners and six
Boeing 787s, with most of the growth coming on international
routes, the carrier said.  “Overall, it was a decent quarter operationally in which
Air Canada did a solid job in managing controllable costs while
shoring up its underlying business,”  Walter Spracklin , an
analyst at  RBC Capital Markets  in Toronto, said in a report to
clients. Air Canada’s “capacity growth plans in international
markets make sense, and it is encouraging to see the cost
controls continuing.”  Cash and short-term investments as of June 30 amounted to
C$2.11 billion, or 17 percent of 12-month trailing revenue.
That’s down from the C$2.32 billion posted a year earlier, which
represented 20 percent of 12-month sales. Long-term debt widened
to about C$3.4 billion as of June 30 from C$3.26 billion on Dec.
31. Pension and benefit liabilities declined to about C$4.56
billion from C$4.69 billion.  To contact the reporter on this story:
