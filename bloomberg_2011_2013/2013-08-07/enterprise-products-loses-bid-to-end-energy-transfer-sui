Enterprise Products Partners LP (EPD)  lost
its bid to throw out a lawsuit claiming it breached a 2011
agreement with Energy Transfer Partners LP to build a pipeline
from Oklahoma to the Texas Gulf Coast.  Enterprise’s arguments to dismiss the case “lack merit,”
Dallas District Judge Emily Tobolowsky ruled today.  Energy Transfer filed the suit in September 2011, claiming
Houston-based Enterprise Products breached its contract when it
abandoned an agreement to build a pipeline while planning to
pursue a similar project with another company.  Energy Transfer sued a day after Enterprise Products
announced a new pipeline project with  Enbridge Inc. (ENB)  It also sued
Enbridge.  The case is Energy Transfer Partners LP v. Enterprise
Products Partners LP, 11-12667, District Court,  Dallas  County,
Texas (Dallas).  To contact the reporters on this story:
