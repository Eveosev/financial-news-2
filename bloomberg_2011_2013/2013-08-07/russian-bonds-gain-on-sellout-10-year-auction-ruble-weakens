Russia’s government notes gained
after the Finance Ministry sold all 10-year bonds offered at an
auction today.  The Finance Ministry sold 10 billion rubles ($303 million)
of OFZs due January 2023 at a weighted-average yield of 7.38
percent, it said on its website. The proposed yield was 7.35
percent to 7.40 percent with total demand at the top end of the
range totaling 15 billion rubles.  There was probably “good demand from foreigners,” Anton Nikitin, analyst at VTB Capital, said by e-mail. The ministry
will offer 10 billion rubles in OFZ bonds due May 2016 at 6.25
percent to 6.30 percent expected yield later today.  The yield on benchmark OFZ bonds due February 2027 fell one
basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 7.73 percent at 3:02
p.m. in Moscow. The yield on the 2023 bond dropped one basis
point to 7.37 percent.  The ruble depreciated 0.1 percent to 37.9218 against Bank
Rossii’s dollar-euro basket. The ruble weakened 0.1 percent
against the dollar to 33.0060. Brent crude fell for a fourth
day, losing 0.6 percent $107.58 a barrel. JPMorgan Chase & Co.’s
 Emerging Markets  Currency index declined by 0.1 percent to
90.097.  Rates, Fed  While Bank Rossii policy makers meet Aug. 9 to discuss
interest rates, Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago President
Charles Evans said yesterday he “would clearly not” rule out a
decision to begin curbing bond purchases in September.  “Emerging-markets currencies are under pressure on renewed
fears of the Fed tapering and the ruble is no exception,”
Vladimir Kolychev, an economist and strategist at OAO  Rosbank (ROSB)  in
Moscow, said by e-mail.  Bank Rossii sold the equivalent of 6.6 billion rubles in
foreign currency on Aug. 5, bringing the total amount spent
since interventions began on May 29 to 281.5 billion rubles,
central bank data shows.  According to central bank data, about three fourths of
daily intervention volumes are targeted selling, and the rest
are so-called non-targeted interventions, conducted to smooth
out excessive ruble volatility. As soon as the volume of non-targeted interventions reaches $450 million, the central bank
moves the currency corridor by 5 kopeks. In July, it moved it
three times to the current 31.85-38.85, according to a statement
on Bank Rossii’s website.  “Should the pressure persist, the basket could continue to
grind higher at a snail’s pace along with the 5-kopeks upward
shifts in the central bank’s floating band,” Kolychev said. The
next shift to 31.90-38.90 is possible as soon as today, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
