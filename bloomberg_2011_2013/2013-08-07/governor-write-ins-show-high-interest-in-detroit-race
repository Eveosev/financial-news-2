Michigan  Governor  Rick Snyder  said
the number of write-in votes in  Detroit ’s primary demonstrate a
high interest level in the race for mayor, even as the position
has been sidelined by an emergency manager.  The results “show there are obviously a lot of citizens
that really care,” Snyder told reporters today after speaking
at the Center for Automotive Research’s annual Management
Briefing Seminars near Traverse City, Michigan.  Unofficial results from the Detroit city clerk’s office,
with 97 percent of precincts reporting, was 48,641 write-in
ballots, led by Mike Duggan, former chief executive officer of
the Detroit Medical Center, and 27,490 for Wayne County Sheriff
 Benny Napoleon .  Detroit entered the largest U.S. municipal bankruptcy on
July 18. Emergency Manager Kevyn Orr, whom Snyder appointed, is
trying to deal with $11.5 billion in unsecured debt while
improving city services.  The primary’s results show “democracy in action,” Snyder,
a Republican, said. The mayor’s position is “clearly
relevant,” he said. “It’s important to have elected officials
in the community.”  Duggan was forced to run a write-in campaign for the
primary because he was ruled ineligible for the ballot under
residency requirements in the city charter, though he moved into
the city from a Detroit suburb in 2012.  Snyder said today he probably won’t endorse a candidate in
the race.  The case is  City of Detroit , 13-bk-53846,  U.S. Bankruptcy
Court , Eastern District of Michigan (Detroit).  To contact the reporter on this story:
