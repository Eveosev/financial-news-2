Old Mutual Plc (OML) , the London-based
insurer that generates about 70 percent of revenue in  South
Africa , said the rand’s weakness against the pound may further
erode earnings.  The currency’s depreciation has already reduced income by 1
pence per share in the first half of this year and may widen
that to 2 pence or more for the full year, Chief Financial
Officer Philip Broadley said in a conference call.  The rand has dropped 11 percent against sterling this year,
making it the world’s worst performer among 16 major peers. It
was 1 percent weaker at 15.40 per pound as of 3:03 p.m. London
time. Old Mutual reported a 14 percent increase in first-half
profit from continuing operations to 555 million pounds.
Adjusted earnings per share were 9.1 pence, missing analyst
estimates.  “The most significant external risks to earnings relate to
the concentration of businesses in South Africa and the
translation of earnings from rand to sterling,” the company
said in a statement today. “Current levels may have some
allowance for further short-term volatility priced in.”  South Africa’s rand has weakened as speculation the U.S.
