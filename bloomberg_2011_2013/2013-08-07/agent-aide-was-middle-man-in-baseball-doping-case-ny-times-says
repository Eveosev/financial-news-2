An aide for a sports agency was the
middle-man between Major League Baseball players and an anti-aging clinic in  Florida  which led to the biggest doping
suspensions handed out in the sport, the  New York Times 
reported.  Juan Carlos Nunez, a  New York  travel agent who worked as a
Spanish-speaking interpreter for ACES, a sports agency run by
Sam and Seth Levinson, helped put players in touch with Anthony Bosch, the founder of the now-shuttered Biogenesis of America
LLC anti-aging clinic in Coral Gables, Florida, the Times
reported.  Major League Baseball two days ago suspended New York
Yankees third baseman Alex Rodriguez without pay through the
2014 season, the longest ban in the sport’s history, and 12
other players for 50 games for their involvement with
Biogenesis. The 12 other players were all current or former
clients of ACES and Nunez acted without the knowledge of his
bosses, the Times said.  Michael Weiner, the executive director of the Major League
Baseball Players Association, told the Times yesterday that the
union’s investigation cleared the Levinsons of any wrongdoing in
the Biogenesis case. ACES said in a statement it had “no
involvement and no knowledge of any wrongdoing,” according to
the Times.  To contact the reporter on this story:
