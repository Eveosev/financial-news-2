South African yellow-corn futures
rose for the first time in four days after the rand weakened
against the dollar, making imports of the grain more expensive.  Yellow corn for delivery in September, the most active
contract, gained 0.2 percent to 2,145 rand ($216) a metric ton
by the midday close on the South African Futures Exchange. The
white variety for December delivery lost 0.2 percent to 2,335 a
ton.  The rand declined for a third day and South African bond
yields rose amid concern that lower commodity prices and labor
disputes in the mining industry will slow growth in the country.  “When the rand weakens, our prices are negatively
affected,” Andrew Fletcher, an independent trader in Kroonstad
in the Free State province, said by phone.  South Africa is the continent’s largest producer of the
grain. Yellow corn is mainly used as animal feed, while the
white variety is used to make one of the nation’s staple foods.  Wheat for December delivery gained 0.3 percent to 3,330
rand a ton.  To contact the reporter on this story:
