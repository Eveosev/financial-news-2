Hyundai Motor Co. (005380) ,  South Korea ’s
biggest carmaker, and affiliate  Kia Motors Corp. (000270)  fell in Seoul
trading after labor union negotiators walked out of wage talks
and threatened to ask workers to vote on a strike.  Hyundai dropped 3.2 percent, the most since July 12, to
close at 225,000 won in Seoul. Kia slid 3.7 percent, while the
benchmark Kospi index declined 1.5 percent.  The union walked out because Hyundai Motor didn’t show
sincerity even after 18 rounds of discussions, Kim Gi Hyuk, a
union spokesman, said yesterday. The union is considering voting
Aug. 13 on whether to go on strike. Kia’s union will vote the
same day to approve a strike, according to a statement on the
labor organization’s website.  “The shares are falling as the likelihood of the union
going on strike increases,” Lee Sang Hyun, an analyst at NH
Investment & Securities Co., said by phone today. “The strikes
will have an adverse impact on third-quarter profit.”  Hyundai and Kia’s union have said they are demanding a pay
increase of 130,498 won ($117) a month and 30 percent of net
income to be distributed to workers. The talks started May 28
for Hyundai Motor and July 2 for Kia.  Stalled wage talks at Hyundai last year led to the
costliest strike in its history, causing a production shortfall
of more than 1 million vehicles and 11.6 trillion won in lost
sales.  To contact the reporter on this story:
