Jerry Wolman, the former owner of the
Philadelphia Eagles, died yesterday at his home in Potomac,
 Maryland , the National Football League team said. He was 86.  Wolman was the youngest owner in the NFL when he owned the
Eagles from 1963-69. He bought the team for $5.5 million and
sold it for $16.2 million to Leonard Tose after his real estate
construction company had failed.  “I had the pleasure of meeting Jerry on multiple occasions
when he came back to watch an Eagles game,” said Eagles
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Jeffrey Lurie in a
statement. “Each time, we enjoyed reminiscing about Eagles
football and sharing in the enjoyment of owning such a historic
franchise.”  Leo Carlin, the team’s director of ticket client services,
worked for the Eagles during Wolman’s ownership.  “He was a fun-loving, charismatic man who got along with
everyone,” Carlin said. “He loved Philadelphia and was one of
those people who tried to help everyone he could reach.”  Wolman is survived by his wife of 35 years, Bobbie; two
children, Helene and Alan; and seven grandchildren.  The funeral will be tomorrow at 1 p.m. at Tifereth Israel
Congregation in Washington, D.C.  To contact the reporter on this story:
