Exchange Ltd. about about investing in the London-based
alternative trading system, according to two people with
knowledge of the discussions.  The talks are at an early stage and Diamond has made no
decision on whether to proceed, said the people, who asked not
to be named as the deliberations are private. A spokesman for
