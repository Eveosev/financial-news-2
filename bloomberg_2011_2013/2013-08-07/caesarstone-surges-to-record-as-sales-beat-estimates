Caesarstone Sdot Yam Ltd. (CSTE) , the
Israeli maker of quartz countertops, jumped to a record in New
York after reporting second-quarter revenue that beat estimates.  Shares of Caesarstone surged 13 percent to $40 at 11:32
a.m. in New York, the highest price since the company’s March
2012 U.S. initial public offering. Trading volume was three
times the daily average of the past 90 days. The company is the
best performer on the Bloomberg Israel-US Equity Index of the
most-traded Israeli companies in New York this year with a 150
percent advance.  The company reported second-quarter sales of $89 million,
beating the $84.7 million average  estimate  of two analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg. Caesarstone forecast 2013 earnings before
interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization of $82 million to
$85 million, compared with a projection of as much as $80
million in May.  “We had been looking for a lot of the positive trends that
we saw emerge in the second quarter to happen and they actually
came through stronger than we would have expected,” Stephen Kim, an analyst at Barclays Plc, who rates the stock the
equivalent of buy, said by telephone from  New York . “We’re
feeling pretty good about the back half of the year.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
