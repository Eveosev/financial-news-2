The  New York Yankees  lost their third
straight game, 3-2 against the  Chicago White Sox , to fall 10
games behind the American League East-leading Boston Red Sox.  Alex Rodriguez , who batted third as the designated hitter
in his second game this season, singled, walked, lined out to
center and advanced to first after being hit by pitcher Chris Sale at U.S. Cellular Field in Chicago last night.  The crowd booed Rodriguez, who was suspended two days ago
without pay for 211 games through the 2014 season by Major
League Baseball for using performance-enhancing drugs, except
when he was struck by Sale in the third inning.  Rodriguez, who returned to the Yankees two nights ago for
the first time since January hip surgery, can keep playing as he
appeals the ban. In his season debut, he went 1-for-4 with a
single in an 8-1 loss to the White Sox. Rodriguez was the only
one of 13 players banned Aug. 5 for their involvement with the
defunct Biogenesis of America LLC clinic in Miami to appeal his
punishment.  Sale (7-11) allowed one run on five hits and struck out six
in 7 1/3 innings. Addison Reed got his 27th save after giving up
one run on two hits and striking out two in the ninth inning.  Alfonso Soriano  scored for the Yankees in the first inning
on Saleâ€™s wild pitch, while  Brett Gardner  sent home Ichiro Suzuki with a single in the ninth.  Hiroki Kuroda (10-7) surrendered three runs on nine hits
and struck out four in seven innings.  To contact the reporter on this story:
