The Monetary Authority of Singapore
appointed Ong Chong Tee to succeed Teo Swee Lian as head of
financial supervision as part of senior management changes aimed
at strengthening the central bank’s leadership.  Teo, a deputy managing director, will step down from her
current role Sept. 1 to become special adviser in the Managing
Director’s Office, according to  a statement  on the central
bank’s website yesterday. Ong, also a deputy managing director,
will relinquish his current  positions  as head of monetary policy
and investment, and financial development.  The changes to the financial supervision arm come after the
MAS in June censured 20 banks, including  UBS AG (UBSN)  and  Royal Bank
of Scotland (RBS)  Group Plc, for attempting to fix interest rate
levels in the island state. Teo in her new role will help the
MAS “play a more active role” in international regulatory
work, according to the statement.  “These changes are intended to strengthen our leadership
bench, and to bring fresh perspectives to our core areas of
work,” Managing Director Ravi Menon said in the statement.  Jacqueline Loh will succeed Ong as head of monetary policy
and investment, and development and international, MAS said.
Andrew Khoo will lead corporate development.  Edward Robinson, an assistant managing director of economic
policy, was named chief economist in addition to his current
position. Foo-Yap Siew Hong will become assistant managing
director, special projects, in the Managing Director’s Office,
according to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
