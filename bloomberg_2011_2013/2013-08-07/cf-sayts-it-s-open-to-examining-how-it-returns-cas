CF Industries Holdings Inc. (CF) , the U.S.
fertilizer producer that hedge fund Third Point LLC said should
raise its dividend, said it’s open to examining how the company
returns cash to investors.  “Our analysis led us to the belief that executing share
buybacks has been the best way for us to return cash to
shareholders, especially since we believe that the earnings
potential of the company is not fully reflected in the market
price of our stock,” Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
Stephen Wilson said today on the Deerfield, Illinois-based
company’s second-quarter earnings conference call.  To contact the reporter on this story:
