John Isner ’s loss in the opening
round of the  Rogers Cup  in Montreal leaves no Americans in the
top 20 of the men’s tennis rankings for the first time.  Isner’s 5-7, 7-6 (7-5), 7-6 (7-4) loss to 71st-ranked Vasek
Pospisil of Canada yesterday will drop him two spots to No. 22
when the ATP World Tour rankings are published on Aug. 12, the
ATP said in an e-mail. At least one American man has been in the
top 20 since the rankings were first published in 1973.  Sam Querrey  is the next-highest man from the U.S. at No.
26, with five others between 78 and 100. The most recent U.S.
man to a major singles title was  Andy Roddick  at the 2003 U.S.
Open. Roddick retired last year.  American women have been outperforming the men recently.
There are six U.S. women ranked in the top 40 on the WTA tour,
with reigning U.S. Open and French Open champion Serena Williams
No. 1.  American men have been dominant in doubles, where brothers
Bob and  Mike Bryan  can complete a calendar-year Grand Slam of
the four majors at the U.S. Open, which begins Aug. 26 in New
York.  To contact the reporter on this story:
