Getco Holding Co. and Knight Capital
Group Inc. lost money last quarter as the trading firms were
completing a merger prompted by Knight’s brush with bankruptcy a
year ago.  KCG Holdings Inc. (KCG) , as the firm formed by the July 1 union
is known, said in a statement that Getco’s second-quarter net
loss totaled $72.9 million and Knight’s loss was $30.8 million.
Getco’s sales fell 16 percent from a year earlier to $118
million, while Knight’s revenue rose 25 percent to $315 million.  Getco said its market-making business in the U.S. and
 Europe  suffered from a decline in equity transaction volume.
Results at the company it purchased, Knight, were helped by
increased trading among small investors as the Standard & Poor’s
500 Index  rose to  a record. Excluding $76.5 million of merger
fees, a goodwill writedown and a legal reserve, Knight had
pretax earnings from continuing operations of $55 million.  Knight was left needing a suitor after bombarding U.S.
exchanges with erroneous orders on Aug. 1, 2012, losing more
than $450 million in the process. Getco agreed to the merger at
a time when dwindling equity volume was pressuring its own
business, prompting a 90 percent drop in 2012 net income.  “The second quarter of 2013 was a period of intense
activity during which the two firms together built the
foundation for KCG,” Chief Executive Officer  Daniel Coleman 
said in today’s statement.  Market Making  Excluding $61 million in expenses related to the merger
along with writedowns, restructuring charges and finance
commitment fees, Getco’s pretax loss was $8.9 million.  Getco’s market-making unit produced a loss of $2 million on
$118 million in revenue, compared with profit of $9.7 million
and sales of $136 million a year earlier. The execution-services
business, which provides trading services to clients, improved
revenue from a year earlier while posting a bigger loss. Sales
rose 41 percent to $13 million, and the loss widened to $2.9
million from $1.5 million.  Knight’s market-making profit amounted to $50 million in
the second quarter, an increase from $5.9 million a year
earlier.  In an interview on July 2, Coleman said the combined
company will focus on cutting execution costs for its broker-dealer and institutional clients and less on proprietary
trading. In the wake of the merger, Thomas Joyce, who had been
CEO of Knight, left the new company.  Getco had 396 full-time employees as of June 30, down from
398 a year earlier, according to today’s statement. Knight’s
headcount, when excluding discontinued operations, fell to 1,211
from 1,341.  KCG Holdings’s stock price peaked at $12.24 on July 2
before closing today at $8.54, down 0.8 percent for the day.
Analysts have taken a cautious stance on the stock, with six
hold ratings and one sell recommendation, according to  data 
compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
