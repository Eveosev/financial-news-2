Copper fell as better-than-expected
U.S. trade data fueled concern the  Federal Reserve  may reduce
its bond purchases this year, reducing stimulus from the economy
and weakening demand for base metals.  Copper for delivery in three months dropped 0.6 percent to
$6,966.50 a metric ton on the London Metal Exchange at 11:44
a.m. in Tokyo. Futures for delivery in September dropped 0.5
percent to $3.1580 a pound on the Comex in New York.  The U.S. trade deficit narrowed more than economists
expected in June to the least since October 2009, data showed
yesterday. A number of Federal Reserve officials have signaled
this week that cuts to asset purchases that have fueled global
stock and bond gains are possible as the U.S. economic outlook
improves.  “It’s not easy for investors to buy copper amid mounting
concern over the Fed’s stimulus,” said  Tetsu Emori , the chief
fund manager at Astmax Asset Management Inc. in Tokyo. “Still,
the physical market in Asia looks to be a bit tight.”  Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas President  Richard Fisher , a
critic of quantitative easing, said on Aug. 5 that the central
bank is closer to slowing the pace of monetary stimulus. Half of
the 54 economists in a Bloomberg survey last month expected the
Fed to trim bond purchases at its meeting in September.  Futures for delivery in November on the Shanghai Futures
Exchange were down 0.3 percent at 50,050  yuan  ($8,176) a ton.  On the LME, aluminum, zinc, lead and tin were little
changed, while nickel rose.  The LME Index of the six base metals has lost 13 percent
this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
