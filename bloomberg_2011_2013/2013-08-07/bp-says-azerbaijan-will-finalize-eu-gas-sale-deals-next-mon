BP Plc (BP/)  said partners in  Azerbaijan â€™s
Shah Deniz natural-gas project will finalize gas sales
agreements with European buyers in September.  Terms of sales have already been agreed with a number of
buyers in  Italy , Greece and Bulgaria, the BP office in the Azeri
capital of Baku said by e-mail late yesterday.  A BP-led group developing the Caspian Sea deposit selected
the proposed Trans-Adriatic Pipeline, or TAP, in June to export
10 billion cubic meters of gas a year to the European Union from
the Turkish-Greek border.  The EU is looking to Shah Deniz, estimated to contain 1.2
trillion cubic meters of gas, and other fields in the Caspian to
cut dependence on Russian supply, which feeds a quarter of its
needs. BP said a final  investment decision  on the second phase
of the Shah Deniz project is expected in the fourth quarter.  Capital expenditure on the offshore Azeri-Chirag-Guneshli
project, also led by BP, rose to $1.3 billion in the first half
from $1.2 billion a year earlier, the U.K. producer said. A
decline in production at the field slowed to 2.4 percent in the
half from a 12 percent drop in the same period a year earlier.  To contact the reporter on this story:
