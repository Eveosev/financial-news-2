Taiwan , which imports almost all its
crude oil, cut purchases in July after a refiner halted a
facility and another lowered operations at a unit.  Shipments fell 15 percent from a year earlier to 22.6
million barrels last month, the  Ministry of Finance  said in
Taipei today. The nation’s July oil bill declined 12 percent to
$2.33 billion, the ministry said in a statement.  CPC Corp., the bigger of Taiwan’s two oil refiners, halted
a residue desulfurizer in Kaohsiung on May 27 after a fire,
while  Formosa Petrochemical Corp. (6505)  cut operations at a Mailiao
gasoline unit because of a glitch.  To contact the reporters on this story:
