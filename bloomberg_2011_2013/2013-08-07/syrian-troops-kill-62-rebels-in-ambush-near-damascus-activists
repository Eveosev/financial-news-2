Syrian troops loyal to President
Bashar al-Assad ambushed rebels today outside Damascus, killing
62 fighters, the activist Syrian Observatory for  Human Rights 
said in an e-mailed statement.  The ambush took place near the industrial city of Adra, the
group said.  Syria â€™s state-run SANA news agency said army units ambushed
fighters belonging to al-Qaeda-affiliated Jabhat al-Nusra who
tried to attack a military checkpoint outside Damascus. The U.S.
designated the group a terrorist organization in December.  It said all the rebels, including non-Syrians, were killed
and their weapons and ammunition seized. It did not give a death
toll.  To contact the reporter on this story:
