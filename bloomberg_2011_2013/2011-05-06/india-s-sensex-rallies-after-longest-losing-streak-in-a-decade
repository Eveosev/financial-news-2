Indian shares rallied, paring a weekly
decline and snapping the benchmark index’s longest stretch of
losses in a decade, as a drop in oil prices eased inflation
concerns and some investors judged the stock slump as excessive.  ICICI Bank Ltd. (ICICIBC) , the nation’s second-biggest lender,
climbed 5.2 percent, pacing gains among its peers.  Tata Motors
Ltd. (TTMT) , the country’s biggest truckmaker and owner of Jaguar Land
Rover, surged the most in almost three months. Oil fell for a
fifth day today and is heading for its biggest weekly decline
since December 2008. Jet Airways (India) Ltd., the nation’s
biggest airline, jumped 12 percent, the most since March 2010.  “The fall in oil prices is giving support to the
markets,” said Apurva Shah, head of research at Prabhudas
Lilladher Pvt. in Mumbai. “The rebound is not surprising. The
markets have fallen for nine days in a row. All it needed was a
positive trigger and the fall in oil did just that.”  The Bombay Stock Exchange Sensitive Index, or Sensex, added
308.23, or 1.7 percent, to 18,518.81 at the 3:30 p.m. close in
Mumbai, the biggest gain among Asian gauges today. The measure
lost 7.1 percent in the prior nine days, the longest losing
streak since September 2001. The S&P CNX Nifty Index on the
National Stock Exchange climbed 1.7 percent to 5,551.45 and its
May futures settled at 5,547.95. The BSE 200 Index rose 1.6
percent to 2,285.46.  The central bank on May 3 increased the benchmark
repurchase rate by half a percentage point to 7.25 percent, the
most since July 2008, and Governor Duvvuri Subbarao predicted
inflation will stay “elevated” until September.  Oil prices  and
monsoon rains will shape inflation, Finance Minister Pranab Mukherjee said the same day.  Accelerating Inflation  India’s benchmark wholesale-price inflation accelerated to
8.98 percent in March and exceeded the central bank’s 8 percent
estimate. By comparison, consumer prices rose 5.4 percent in
 China , 9.5 percent in  Russia , 6.3 percent in  Brazil  and 4.1
percent in  South Africa .  The Sensex fell 3.2 percent this week, its steepest drop
since the five days to Jan. 14. The gauge has declined 9.7
percent this year on concern higher borrowing costs will hurt
corporate earnings. Sensex stocks trade at an average 14.7 times
estimated profit, down from 21.5 times in March 2010. The MSCI
Emerging Markets Index is valued at 11.3 times.  ICICI Bank climbed 5.2 percent to 1,083.8 rupees, the most
since March 1, and its May futures traded at 1,080.25 rupees.
Larger rival  State Bank of India (SBIN)  increased 1.8 percent to
2,649.9 rupees.  HDFC Bank Ltd. (HDFCB) , India’s third-biggest, rose 3.5
percent to 2,297.25 rupees, while  Housing Development Finance
Corp. (HDFC) , the country’s biggest mortgage lender, added 1.5 percent
to 664.8 rupees. The Bombay Stock Exchange Bankex Index advanced
3.7 percent, paring the 9.8 percent decline in the past nine
days. Lenders have dropped amid concern rising  interest rates 
will hurt their net interest margins.  Higher Rates  Expansion in India’s $1.3 trillion economy has increased
consumer demand and spurred manufacturing, car sales and credit
growth, stoking price risks and prompting the central bank to
increase rates nine times since March 2010. A 26 percent climb
in oil in the past year has contributed to inflation in India,
which imports about 75 percent of its annual energy needs.  Tata Motors was the biggest gainer on the Sensex today,
rallying 5.5 percent to 1,199.95 rupees, its steepest climb
since Feb. 14.  Mahindra & Mahindra Ltd. (MM) , largest maker of sport-
utility vehicles and tractors, jumped 3.2 percent to 714.4
rupees.  Hero Honda Motors Ltd. (HH) , the biggest motorcycle maker,
advanced 4 percent to 1,765.55 rupees.  Crude Drops  Crude for June delivery dropped as much as $5.17 to $94.63
a barrel in electronic trading on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange . The London Metal Exchange Index of six metals
including copper and aluminum sank for a second day yesterday,
falling 4 percent, the biggest drop since November 16.  Jet Airways surged 12 percent to 490.90 rupees, its biggest
gain since March 2010.  Kingfisher Airlines Ltd. (KAIR) , the second
biggest, jumped 11 percent to 44.40 rupees, the most since
August last year.  SpiceJet Ltd. (SJET) , a discount carrier, also
rallied 11 percent to 44.4 rupees, the steepest climb since
September 2009.  Among refiners, Indian Oil Corp., the country’s biggest,
rose 2.4 percent to 352.85 rupees, Bharat Petroleum Corp. gained
3.5 percent to 666.05 rupees, while Hindustan Petroleum Corp.
added 2.7 percent to 400.5 rupees. The three stocks gained after
Nomura Holdings Inc. raised their ratings to “neutral” from
“reduce.”  Sterlite Industries (India) Ltd., the nation’s biggest
copper producer, dropped 1.2 percent to 168.05 rupees after it
cut prices by 4 percent, the first time this year, as global
prices of the metal declined.  Overseas funds sold a net 7 billion rupees ($157 million)
of Indian stocks on May 4, paring their investments in the
equities this year to 25.8 billion rupees, according to data on
the  website  of the Securities and Exchange Board of  India .  India’s economic growth and corporate earnings lured
foreign investors to buy a record $29.4 billion of local
equities last year and made the Sensex the best performer and
most expensive among the world’s 10 biggest markets.  To contact the reporter on this story:
