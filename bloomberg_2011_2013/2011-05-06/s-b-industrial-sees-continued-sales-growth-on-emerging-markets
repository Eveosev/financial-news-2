S&B Industrial Minerals SA (ARBA) , a Greek
minerals company founded in 1934, sees continued sales growth
this year helped by demand for industrial metals from emerging
markets, said Chief Executive Officer Kriton Anavlavis.  Net income in the first quarter rose to 4.1 million euros
($6 million) from 4 million euros in the same period a year
earlier, the Athens-based minerals company said today in a
bourse filing. Sales rose 17 percent from the year earlier
period to 112 million euros.  “Metallurgical growth is a breeze in our sails and this is
what is propelling us forward,” Anavlavis said in a telephone
interview today. The company’s performance was helped by
“bullish” sales in Brazil,  China  and India, he said.  S&B manufactures and trades industrial minerals and ores
for the steel, metallurgy and construction markets, including
bauxite, perlite and bentonite. Metallurgy is the process of
separating metals from their ores and preparing them for
industrial use.  Bauxite production returned to “recovery mode,” after
resolving permit issues in  Greece , Anavlavis said. Bauxite
revenue rose 4.7 percent to 7.3 million euros in the quarter.  Bureaucracy can make permit issuance a lengthy process in
Greece, which dropped 12 places to 109 in the World Bank’s
“Doing Business 2011” report, which compares business
regulation in 183 countries.  To contact the reporter on this story:
