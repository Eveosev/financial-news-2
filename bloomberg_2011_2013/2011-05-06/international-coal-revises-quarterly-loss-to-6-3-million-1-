International Coal Group Inc. (ICO) , which
agreed May 2 to be bought by  Arch Coal Inc. (ACI)  for $3.4 billion,
revised its first-quarter results to a loss of $6.3 million,
citing an adverse court ruling on a supply contract.  The net loss was 3 cents a share, compared with the $22
million, or 10 cents a share, profit reported April 27, the
Scott Depot, West Virginia-based company said today in a
statement.  A trial court ruled May 2 that Wolf Run, a subsidiary of
International, breached a coal contract with Allegheny Energy
Supply and Monongahela Power Co. when it declared force majeure
and temporarily idled a mine in the third quarter of 2006 and
that it was liable for $104.1 million.  As a result the company recorded a $40 million charge to
its first-quarter earnings, it said.  “Although the verdict provides damages of $104.1 million,
the company has accrued $40 million as of March 31, 2011 because
it believes that it has meritorious factual and legal bases for
reversal or revision of substantial portions of the trial court
decision,” International said in the statement.  The company said May 3 that it doesn’t expect the ruling to
derail the merger with Arch, to be completed by June 30.  To contact the reporters on this story:
