UBS AG (UBSN) , Switzerland’s biggest bank,
hired Richard Eisenberg from  JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM)  as a managing
director in the technology, media and telecommunications banking
group, said a person with direct knowledge of the matter.  Eisenberg will cover information services, publishing and
education, according to the person, who declined to be
identified because the move hasn’t been made public. Eisenberg
will be based in New York starting in August and report to Aryeh Bourkoff, head of investment banking for the Americas.  UBS Chief Executive Officer Oswald Gruebel has hired more
than 1,700 bankers in the past two years to rebuild the
investment bank after more than $57 billion in writedowns and
credit losses during the financial crisis. The technology, media
and telecommunications team at Zurich-based UBS is advising
 British Sky Broadcasting Group Plc (BSY)  on its takeover by News Corp.  To contact the reporter on this story:
