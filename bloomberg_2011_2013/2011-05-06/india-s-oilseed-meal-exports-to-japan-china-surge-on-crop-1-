Oilseed meal exports from  India ,
Asia’s biggest supplier of soybean extracts, more than
doubled last month as sales to  Japan  and China increased on a
bigger crop, a processors’ group said.  Shipments climbed to 501,497 metric tons in April from
204,346 tons a year earlier, the Solvent Extractors’ Association
of India said in an e-mailed statement today. Sales to Japan,
the South Asian nation’s biggest buyer, almost tripled to
102,775 tons from a year ago, and shipments to China jumped to
85,111 tons from 46,254 tons, it said.  Shipments in the 6 months through April almost doubled to
3.68 million tons, from 1.88 million tons a year ago it said.
India’s oilseed output may increase 21 percent to 30.25 million
tons in the year ending June from a year earlier, the farm
ministry said April 6.  Soybean meal, India’s largest meal export, is added to
poultry feed as a form of protein to aid birds’ growth. The
country usually exports more than 70 percent of its output.  To contact the reporter on this story:
