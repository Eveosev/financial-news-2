Senegalese President Abdoulaye Wade
asked his Ministry of  Urban Development  to modify the countryâ€™s
urban building code to prioritize the use of solar energy,
according to an e-mailed statement.  New buildings in cities should generate 60 percent of their
energy from solar panels, Wade said in the statement.  Oil-powered plants account for 78 percent of the 549
megawatts generated by the state-owned power utility, Senelec.
Frequent blackouts have provoked political demonstrations in the
outskirts of the capital, Dakar.  To contact the reporter on this story:
