Cash premiums for soybeans and corn
shipped in May to terminals near  New Orleans  fell relative to
Chicago futures after the U.S. Coast Guard restricted barge
traffic on the  Mississippi River  because of flooding.  The spot-basis bid, or premium, for soybeans delivered this
month was 58 cents to 64 cents a bushel above July futures, down
from 60 cents to 67 cents yesterday, U.S. Department of
Agriculture  data  show. The corn basis was 56 cents to 57 cents a
bushel compared with 56 cents to 58 cents.  “Barge shipments will be very slow the next several weeks,
until the water gets flushed out into the  Gulf of Mexico ,” said
Dave Marshall, a farm-marketing adviser for Toay Commodity
Futures Group LLC in Nashville,  Illinois . “Basis deteriorated
on uncertainty about grain shipments and slowing export
demand.”  Soybean futures for July delivery rose 4.25 cents, or 0.3
percent, to $13.26 a bushel on the  Chicago  Board of Trade, the
first gain in five sessions. The price fell 4.9 percent this
week.  Corn futures for July delivery fell 22.5 cents, or 3.2
percent, to $6.8625 a bushel in Chicago, capping a 9.3 percent
drop this week.  The Coast Guard closed a five-mile portion of the
Mississippi near Caruthersville, Missouri, for eight days
because of the imminent danger of vessel wakes topping a flood
wall. Water levels rose to a record 47.57 feet (13.9 meters)
today, above the previous peak of 46 feet in 1937. The river is
forecast to crest in New Orleans about May 23.  “It’s going to be several weeks before barge shipping
returns to normal,” Marshall said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
