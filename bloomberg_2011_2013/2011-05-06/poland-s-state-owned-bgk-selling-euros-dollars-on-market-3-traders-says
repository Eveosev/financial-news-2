Bank Gospodarstwa Krajowego, the
state-owned Polish bank, sold euros and U.S. dollars, helping
the zloty snap its three-day losing streak.  The lender known as BGK sold $10 million each to at least
two banks, two Warsaw-based traders involved in the transactions
said today. The bank was also offering to sell euros at 3.9625
zloty, one of the traders said. Another trader said BGK sold
both currencies today. The zloty strengthened 0.4 percent to
3.9429 against the common currency as of 4:06 p.m., erasing an
earlier decline.  Piotr Stalega, a spokesman for Warsaw-based BGK, declined
to comment when reached on his mobile phone.  The transactions come a day after Finance Minister Jacek Rostowski said that the government started converting euros it
receives from the European Union on the foreign-currency market.
BGK may trade the currency from its own account as well as on
the  Finance Ministry ’s behalf.  The government will this year exchange as much as 14
billion euros ($20.5 billion) for the zloty, acting through BGK,
Deputy Finance Minister  Dominik Radziwill  said on April 21. The
sales “may ease pressure to increase  interest rates ,” reduce
volatility and absorb liquidity on the  interbank market ,
Rostowski said at a conference on the same day.  To contact the reporter on this story:
