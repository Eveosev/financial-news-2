Rigs used by energy explorers in Asia
fell for a second month in May, according to data compiled by
 Baker Hughes Inc. (BHI)   The Asia-Pacific region used 255 rigs on land and sea last
month, compared with 268 a year earlier, Baker Hughes, an
oilfield services company, said on its  website . Rigs in
operation climbed to a 26-year high of 286 in January.  The region accounted for about 22 percent of global rig
use, excluding the U.S. and Canada. Explorers in Asia Pacific
operated 254 rigs in April.  Oil in  New York  has climbed 38 percent in the past year to
$98.60 a barrel in electronic trade at 6:22 p.m. Singapore time.  There were 3,130 rigs operating worldwide in May, 380 more
than a year earlier, according to Baker Hughes. The
international rig count, excluding the U.S. and  Canada , stood at
1,151 last month compared with 1,090 a year earlier, Baker
Hughes said. The figures include offshore and onshore drill
sites and exclude those in Iran and onshore in  China .  Baker Hughes has published rig counts since 1944, when
Hughes Tool Co. began weekly data on U.S. and Canadian drilling,
according to the companyâ€™s website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
