Treasuries pared losses as speclation
 Greece  may leave the European Union drove investors to the
safety of U.S. goverment debt.  “One concern is what would happen to euro banks that own the
debt, and is it going to be marked down further, creating more
of an economic issue,” said Thomas Roth, senior Treasury trader
in New York at Mitsubishi UFJ Securities USA Inc.  The euro extended its losses after Der Spiegel magazine
reported that debt-strapped Greece is considering withdrawing
from the euro zone and reintroducing its own currency, and that
the European Commission called a meeting to discuss the move. A
spokesman for Luxembourg’s  Jean-Claude Juncker , who leads euro-
region finance ministers, denied the report.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
