Copper rebounded from a five-month low
in  New York  after a report showed the U.S. added more jobs than
forecast, boosting demand prospects.  Payrolls increased by 244,000 in April, the most since May
2010, the Labor Department said. Economists projected an
increase of 185,000, according to the median of 86 estimates in
a Bloomberg News survey. Prices slid 6 percent in the previous
two sessions, the biggest such decline since June.  The metal “seems to have reacted very positively to the
payrolls data,” said  Gayle Berry , an analyst at  Barclays
Capital  in London. “When you tend to see these big sentiment-
driven moves, they can reverse just as quickly as they happen.”  Copper futures for July delivery rose 4.15 cents, or 1
percent, to $4.0395 a pound at 11:27 a.m. on the Comex in New
York. The price earlier fell to $3.928, the lowest since Dec. 1.
Before today, the commodity dropped 14 percent since reaching a
record $4.6575 on Feb. 15.  Prices have slumped amid concern that higher  interest rates 
will slow growth and cool metals demand in India and China, the
world’s biggest consumer.  “Much of the play in metals is a bet on China,”  Edward
Meir , a senior analyst at MF Global Holdings Ltd. in Darien,
Connecticut, said today in a report. “With the government there
tightening the screws in order to get control of inflation,
there are legitimate concerns as to whether the authorities will
press too hard.”  On the London Metal Exchange, copper for three-month
delivery rose $68, or 0.8 percent, to $8,888 a metric ton ($4.03
a pound).  Tin, zinc, lead and nickel also gained in London. Aluminum
was little changed.  To contact the reporters on this story:
