German Chancellor  Angela Merkel  is
facing a criminal complaint from a labor judge in Hamburg for
saying she’s “happy” that U.S. forces managed to kill al-Qaeda
chief Osama bin Laden, Hamburger Morgenpost  reported .  Judge Heinz Uthmann, 54, who’s served at Hamburg’s labor
court for 21 years, claims the chancellor acted illegally by
approving of criminal offences, the newspaper said, citing an
interview with Uthmann. The judge, who said he was acting as a
law-abiding citizen, asked prosecutors to investigate.  Uthmann based his complaint on Article 140 of  Germany ’s
penal code, which punishes the endorsement of serious crimes
with up to three years in prison, the newspaper said. Merkel’s
conduct lacks tact and dignity, the newspaper cited Uthmann as
saying.  He sent his complaint to the office of Hamburg’s prosecutor
on May 4, the newspaper said.  A spokesman for the German government in Berlin, speaking
under customary conditions of anonymity, declined to comment on
the report.  Nobody answered three telephone calls made to the Hamburg
prosecutor’s office today seeking comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
