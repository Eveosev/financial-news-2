Liberty Media Corp.’s Liberty Starz
tracking stock, which includes the Starz pay-television
business, rose 4.4 percent after the company said when it
expects to split off Liberty Starz and Liberty Capital.  Liberty Media, controlled by billionaire John C. Malone,
said in a statement that it expects shareholders to vote on the
split on May 23, and to complete the splitoff “this summer.”  The company, based in Englewood,  Colorado , said last June
it planned to separate the Liberty Capital and Liberty Starz
tracking stock groups from the Liberty Interactive tracking
stock group to make the groups more efficient. The company also
reported first-quarter financial results for the units today.  Liberty Starz Class A shares rose $3.24 to $77.49 at 4 p.m.
New York time in Nasdaq Stock Market trading. The shares have
risen 17 percent this year.  Liberty Interactive Class A shares rose 81 cents, or 4.6
percent to $18.34. The shares have risen 16 percent this year.
Liberty Capital Class A shares rose $2.35, or 2.8 percent, to
$86.96. The shares have risen 39 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
