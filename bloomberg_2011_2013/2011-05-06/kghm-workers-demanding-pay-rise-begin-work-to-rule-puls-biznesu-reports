Workers at  KGHM Polska Miedz SA (KGH) ,
Poland’s sole copper producer, will begin a work-to-rule today
in pursuit of a pay increase,  Puls Biznesu  reported, citing
Jozef Czyczerski, who heads the Solidarity union.  The newspaper didn’t specify the number of workers planning
to participate in the action.  Managers at the company cut short a meeting with workers
after cans of beer were thrown at them, according to an e-mailed
statement sent yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
