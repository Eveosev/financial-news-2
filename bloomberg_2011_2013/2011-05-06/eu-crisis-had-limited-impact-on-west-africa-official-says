The austerity programs enacted by
countries in the European Union have had a “limited impact” on
economies in West Africa, said the EU’s Head of Economic
Advisory Services to  Senegal , Philippe Thomas.  “The impact has not been visible,” Thomas told reporters
in the capital, Dakar, today.  The EU, the largest donor to Senegal, a former French
colony, has maintained its levels of aid to the region, he said.
At the same time, faster domestic growth in West Africa has
reduced the region’s reliance on remittances from emigrants in
Europe. According to the  Central Bank  of West African States, as
much as 10 percent of gross domestic product comes in the form
of wire transfers from foreign countries.  To contact the reporter on this story:
