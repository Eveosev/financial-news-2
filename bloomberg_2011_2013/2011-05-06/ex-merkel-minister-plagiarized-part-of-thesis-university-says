Former German Defense Minister Karl- Theodor zu Guttenberg plagiarized chunks of his doctoral thesis,
his former university confirmed today after scrutinizing the
text in a three-month review.  Zu Guttenberg, who quit his Cabinet job in March amid the
allegations, “seriously violated good academic practice and
sought to deceive with intent” when compiling his thesis, the
University of Bayreuth said on its website.  The university said its former student plagiarized
“throughout” his 475-page thesis on constitutional law in the
U.S. and the European Union. Dubbed the “Googlegate Scandal”
by German media, the university probe was begun after a Feb. 16
story in the Sueddeutsche Zeitung newspaper sparked outcry in
the country’s academic circles.  Guttenberg, a member of the  Christian Social Union , a
Bavarian party affiliated with Merkel’s CDU, had been regarded
by the German media as a possible future chancellor. Prior to
his resignation, his approval rating outpaced Merkel’s in polls
for more than a year. Telephone calls to a number listed as zu
Guttenberg’s in Kulmbach, Bavaria, went unanswered.  To contact the reporters on this story:
