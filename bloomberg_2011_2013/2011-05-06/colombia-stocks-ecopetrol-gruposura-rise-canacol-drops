rose 1.1 percent to 3,760 pesos. The state-run company said
yesterday that high crude prices have generated enough revenue
to fund capital expenditures plan this year.  The company is waiting for “the proper moment” to issue
shares this year of as much as a 9.9 percent stake, Chief
Executive Officer  Javier Gutierrez  said yesterday on a
conference call.  Canacol Energy Ltd. (CNE)  , the Calgary-based oil
company that operates fields in South America, fell for a second
day, declining  by 2 percent to 2,165 pesos as crude capped its
biggest weekly decline in more than two years as the death of
Osama bin Laden and a strengthening dollar triggered a five-day
rout in commodity prices.  Grupo de Inversiones Suramericana SA (GRUPOSUR)  , the
parent company of Colombia’s largest bank, climbed 1.6 percent
to 36,300 after S&P rated the company BBB-, according to a
