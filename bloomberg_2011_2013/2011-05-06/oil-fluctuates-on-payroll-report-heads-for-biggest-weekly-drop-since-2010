Crude oil capped its biggest weekly
decline in more than two years as the death of  Osama bin Laden 
and a strengthening dollar triggered a five-day rout in
commodity prices.  Crude tumbled 15 percent from $113.93 a barrel on April 29,
the highest settlement price since 2008, after the al-Qaeda
leader’s death. The dollar’s advance against the euro curbed
commodities’ appeal as an alternate investment. Money managers
made near-record bets on high commodity prices in April.  “It’s been a big commodity bull run and at some point
something will happen to burst the bubble,” said  Tom Bentz , a
broker with BNP Paribas Commodity Futures Inc. in New York.
“When Osama bin Laden was killed, the market sold off quickly
and maybe tipped its hand as to what it could do on the
downside, and that spooked a lot of longs.”  Crude for June delivery tumbled $2.62, or 2.6 percent, to
$97.18 a barrel, the lowest settlement price since March 15 on
 New York  Mercantile Exchange. Oil’s five-day selloff was the
biggest weekly decline since December 2008. Futures have risen
26 percent in the past year.  Brent crude  for June settlement decreased $1.67, or 1.5
percent, to $109.13 a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures
Europe exchange.  European Central Bank President  Jean-Claude Trichet 
signaled yesterday that the ECB may wait to increase  interest
rates , boosting the dollar to a two-week high.  Stronger Dollar  The dollar gained 1.4 percent to $1.434 per euro at 4:42
p.m. in New York, the highest level since April 19. Trichet said
yesterday that inflation risks will be watched “very closely”
and dashed the bets of some investors anticipating a rate
increase next month. The currency has advanced 3.2 percent for
the week.  Oil may decline further if the dollar extends its gains,
said Stephen Schork, president of the Villanova, Pennsylvania-
based Schork Group Inc.  “If the dollar continues to strengthen, we go back to
$85,” he said. “I’m adamant about that.”  The Standard & Poor’s GSCI Total Return Index of 24
commodities dropped 11 percent this week, the most in 29 months.
The index tumbled 1.4 percent today to 674.16, the lowest level
since March 15, led by gas oil, corn, silver and sugar. Silver
fell 27 percent since April 29 in the biggest weekly decrease
since at least 1975.  “I suspect the market was overbought, but I think it’s
largely a momentum thing,” said Bruce Bullock, director of the
Maguire Energy Institute at  Southern Methodist University  in
 Dallas . “Once all the short positions are cleared, we’ll start
all the way back up again.”  Intraday Rally  Earlier today, crude jumped as much as 2.6 percent after
the Labor Department released a better-than-expected U.S. jobs
report, renewing speculation that fuel demand will increase as
the economy improves.  The Labor Department reported payrolls increased by 244,000
workers last month, the biggest gain since May 2010, compared
with a 185,000 increase forecast in a Bloomberg survey of
economists. The figures indicated that the U.S. is weathering
the impact of high fuel prices.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index gained 0.4 percent to
1,340.20, and the  Dow Jones Industrial Average  climbed 54.57, or
0.4 percent, to 12,638.74 on the jobs report.  Supply, Demand  Crude also retreated after the Energy Department reported
May 4 that oil supplies in the U.S., the world’s largest energy
consumer, increased 3.42 million barrels, or 0.9 percent, last
week to 366.5 million, a six-month high. Supplies are 1.7
percent higher than a year ago. Gasoline demand fell 2.2 percent
in the period ended April 29 to 8.94 million barrels a day.  “Crude had very definite specific fundamental reasons for
dropping,” said  Tim Evans , an energy analyst at Citi Futures
Perspective in New York. “U.S. commercial stocks are higher
than a year ago and are at their highest level since October.”  Oil has gained 6.3 percent in New York this year as unrest
in the Middle East and North  Africa  toppled leaders in Tunisia
and  Egypt  and spread to  Libya ,  Algeria ,  Bahrain ,  Iran ,  Oman ,
Syria and Yemen and output was curtailed in Libya, which started
the year as Africa’s third-largest oil producer.  “We believe the oil market remains supply constrained,”
JPMorgan Chase & Co. analysts led by New York-based Lawrence
Eagles, said in a report today. “This decline offers an
opportunity for consumers to guard against upside price risk.”  Prices May Drop  Oil may drop further next week as U.S. supplies remain at a
six-month high and on a stronger dollar, a Bloomberg News survey
showed. Fifteen of 30 analysts, or 50 percent, forecast oil will
decrease through May 13. Ten respondents, or 33 percent,
predicted prices will increase and five projected little change.
Last week, 60 percent of respondents said futures would gain.  Open interest in crude oil futures on the  New York
Mercantile Exchange  surged to 1.65 million contracts yesterday,
the fourth record in a week, based on data compiled by
Bloomberg. It topped a high of 1.63 million set May 4.  Oil volume in electronic trading on the Nymex was 972,896
contracts as of 4:41 p.m. in New York. Volume totaled 1.13
contracts yesterday, 55 percent above the average of the past
three months and the highest level since Feb. 24.  To contact the reporter on this story:
