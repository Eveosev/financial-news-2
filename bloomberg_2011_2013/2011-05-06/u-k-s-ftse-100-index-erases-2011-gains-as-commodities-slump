The U.K.’s  FTSE 100 Index (UKX)  rebounded
from a two-day selloff as banks and mining companies rallied
after a U.S. report showed the world’s largest economy added
more jobs than forecast last month.  Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc (RBS)  jumped the most since
January after the lender reported higher operating profit.  Anglo
American Plc (AAL)  gained 3.8 percent as a gauge of metal producers

travel-related shares higher.  ARM Holdings Plc (ARM)  rose on a report
Apple Inc. may consider its processors for laptops.  The benchmark FTSE 100 Index increased 56.79, or 1 percent,

0.9 percent today, while Ireland’s ISEQ Index rose 2.3 percent.  The U.S. jobs data “has been enough to encourage investors
to pick up some of the more badly beaten stocks,” said Joshua Raymond, a market strategist at  City Index  in  London . “Two
sectors which have been hit hard this week, the banks and the
miners, have both seen buyers return today.”  The Labor Department report showed non-farm payrolls in the
U.S. increased by 244,000 workers last month for the biggest

a rise of 185,000 and follows March’s figure which was revised
to a 221,000 gain.  The FTSE 100 last month climbed 2.7 percent as companies

increased 2.3 percent to 1,442 pence.  The  FTSE 350 Mining Index (F3MNG)  gained 2 percent as copper
rebound in  New York  from its lowest price in five months. The
gauge had dropped 6.2 percent the previous three trading
sessions amid a slump in commodity prices.  Carnival, the world’s biggest cruise-line operator, jumped
2 percent to 2,600 pence as crude oil heads for its biggest
weekly selloff in New York since December 2008, down more than
11 percent.  EasyJet Plc (EZJ) , which today reported a 35 percent jump in
passenger traffic for April, climbed 3.6 percent to 355.1 pence

euros in Dublin.  Airlines Gain  Airlines also advanced after International Consolidated

beating predictions, as traffic rose and the deal cut costs. The

Arctic oil exploration deal.  Admiral Group Plc (ADM)  gained 2.1 percent to 1,697 pence after
