Tim Participacoes SA (TCSL4) , the Brazilian
unit of  Italy ’s largest phone company, surged the most since
December 2008 in Sao Paulo after saying it plans to convert all
of its shares into voting stock.  Tim’s preferred shares surged 7.8 percent to 7.48 reais at
the close of trading in Sao Paulo at 4:15 p.m. New York time.
That is the highest price since November 2007. The voting shares
gained 7.2 percent to 8.78 reais.  The company said in a regulatory filing yesterday it plans
to join the Sao Paulo exchange’s Novo Mercado, a listing with
stricter disclosure requirements that only allows for the
trading of voting shares. Investors will receive 0.8406 common
share for each preferred share, the filing said. The move will
likely boost liquidity, transparency and corporate governance,
according to JPMorgan Chase & Co.  “We see this development as very positive,” Andre Baggio,
a Sao Paulo-based analyst at JPMorgan, wrote in a note to
clients yesterday.  Baggio reiterated Tim as JPMorgan’s top pick in the
industry. He rates the stock “overweight.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
