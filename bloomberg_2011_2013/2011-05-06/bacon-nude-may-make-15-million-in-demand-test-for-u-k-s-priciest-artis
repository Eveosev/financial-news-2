A 1961 female nude by  Francis Bacon 
may raise $15 million at auction next month as owners regain
confidence in the market for the U.K.’s most expensive artist.  “Crouching Nude” is valued at 7 million pounds to 9
million pounds and included in  Sotheby’s (BID)  London evening sale of
contemporary works on June 29. The canvas of a grinning woman in
an interior will be on show at Sotheby’s New York from today
through May 9, the auction house said in an e-mailed statement.  The Bacon market was boosted when his 1964 triptych,
“Three Studies for a Portrait of  Lucian Freud ,” fetched 23
million pounds at Sotheby’s in London on Feb. 10. The work was
bought, at more than three times estimates, by the Cologne-based
dealer  Alex Lachmann , who acts for Russian clients.  “The market needed good works to gauge the new levels,”
said James Holland-Hibbert, a London-based dealer. “Prices went
up so quickly, then the crash came and no one was quite sure
what Bacon was worth. The estimates had got too high.”  “Crouching Nude” -- a composite of the artist’s friends
Isabel Rawsthorne, Henrietta Moraes and Muriel Belcher -- was
one of 90 works included in a Tate Gallery traveling
retrospective in 1962. It was also in a 2006 exhibition at the
 Gagosian Gallery ,  London , where it was bought by an unidentified
private collector, who is re-offering the work now, Oliver Barker, Sotheby’s European deputy chairman, said.  The seller hasn’t been offered a guaranteed price, he said.
The estimate was based on a valuation of 7.5 million euros
($10.9 million) to 10 million euros placed on a similar 1961
Bacon female nude that fetched 13.7 million euros at Sotheby’s
in Paris in 2007.  “Conservative estimates are the way to get the best
auction prices,” Barker said. “The market’s still selective.”  Russian billionaire  Roman Abramovich  paid a record $86.3
million for Bacon’s 1976 “Triptych” at Sotheby’s New York in
May 2008, dealers said. Works by the Irish-born artist were in
short supply at auctions during 2009 and 2010.  Bacon’s 1974 “Three Studies for Self Portrait” will be
offered at Christie’s International,  New York , on May 11 with a
low estimate of $20 million.  (Scott Reyburn writes about the art market for Muse, the
