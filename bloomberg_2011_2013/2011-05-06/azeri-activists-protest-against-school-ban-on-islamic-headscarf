Several dozen religious activists
rallied outside  Azerbaijan ’s Education Ministry today to protest
against a ban on Islamic headscarves in schools.  Demonstrators in the capital, Baku, chanted “God is
great” and “Freedom to hijab,” the name for the scarves
traditionally worn by Muslim women, before being dispersed by
police, according to a video on the website of the Azeri-
language service of Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty.  It was the second major protest outside the Education
Ministry since the ban was introduced by the secular government
of President Ilham Aliyev last December.  Azerbaijan’s energy transit routes to Europe bypass Russia,
attracting oil companies such as London-based  BP Plc. (BP/)  Azeri
officials accuse Iran of trying to stir up Islamic protests to
weaken Aliyev, 49.  The president, who took over from his father in 2003 in the
first dynastic succession in a former Soviet republic, is also
facing protests led by secular pro-democracy groups who are
seeking to replicate the uprisings that ousted rulers in Egypt
and  Tunisia .  To contact the reporter on this story:
