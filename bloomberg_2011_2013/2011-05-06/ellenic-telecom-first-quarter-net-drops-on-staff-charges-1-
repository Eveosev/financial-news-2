Hellenic Telecommunications
Organization SA (HTO) ,  Greece ’s largest telephone-services provider,
said first-quarter profit dropped 54 percent, hurt by the
country’s recession as well as a staff-reduction charge.  Net income fell to 30.2 million euros ($43.9 million) from
65.8 million euros a year earlier, the Athens-based company,
also known as OTE, said in a faxed statement today. Sales
declined 13 percent to 1.22 billion euros.  Results were “severely impacted” by Greece’s adverse
economic environment, a 40 million-euro charge related to early
retirement programs, and “regulatory obstacles” in its home
market, the company said in the statement.  “With revenue showing some signs of stabilization and
cost-cutting measures gradually beginning to kick in, we expect
that OTE’s performance will start improving in the latter part
of the year,” Chief Executive Officer Michael Tsamaz said in
the statement.  OTE will cut about 250 jobs from its Greek fixed-line
operations, over 300 positions across Greek mobile operations
and at the company’s Germanos retail outlet chain, as well as
more than 1,000 jobs at RomTelecom, its Romanian unit.  “The company’s ability to compete was once again impacted
by regulatory delays in the approval of its products while its
competitors have launched intense pricing campaigns,” OTE said
in the statement.  OTE will propose a dividend of 0.1179 euros a share.  To contact the reporter on this story:
