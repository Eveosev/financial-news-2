Prudential Financial Inc. (PRU) ’s real
estate investment arm raised 492 million pounds ($805 million)
for a property-lending fund,  Europe ’s largest to date for
mezzanine loans.  Sovereign wealth funds and pension plans were among
investors that pledged to put money into the  Pramerica Real
Estate Capital 1 Fund , according to a statement today from
Prudential’s Pramerica Real Estate Investors Ltd.  Banks, which dominate property lending in Europe, are
pulling back after incurring losses in the financial crisis.
That’s forced real-estate borrowers to look elsewhere for
refinancing and new funds. Europe’s property debt funding gap --
the shortfall between existing commercial property loans that
are due to expire through 2013 and the amount of debt available
-- amounts to $118 billion, adviser DTZ Group Plc estimates.  The new fund will make mezzanine loans, which rank below
senior and junior debt and above equity investors for repayment
in the event of a default, or provide preferred equity for as
much as 75 million pounds. The fund will focus mainly on the
U.K. and  Germany , London-based Pramerica said.  Prudential Financial Inc. is the second-biggest U.S. life
insurer.  To contact the reporter on this story:
