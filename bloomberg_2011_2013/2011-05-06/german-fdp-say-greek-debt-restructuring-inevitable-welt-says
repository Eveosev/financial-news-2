Christian Lindner, General Secretary
of  Germany ’s Free Democratic Party, said the likelihood that
 Greece  may have to restructure its debt is “only a question of
time and conditions,” the  Die Welt  newspaper said.  Lindner, whose party is in coalition with Chancellor Angela Merkel’s Christian Democrats, said creditors should first be
asked to take a haircut on their bonds before any further aid is
offered to euro-area states, the newspaper said in citing a
previewed interview.  Lindner said the debt crisis would be high on the agenda at
his party’s annual conference on May 13.  To contact the reporter on this story:
