Sheryl Cwele, the wife of South
African Security Minister Siyabonga Cwele, was sentenced to 12
years in jail for trafficking cocaine, National Prosecuting
Authority spokeswoman Natasha Ramkisson said.  Sheryl Cwele and Nigerian co-accused Frank Nabolisa, who
was given the same sentence, will appeal their convictions,
Ramkisson said in a phone interview from Pietermaritzburg in
KwaZulu-Natal province, where the trial took place.  Prosecutors alleged that Cwele was involved in an attempt
to smuggle 9 kilograms (19.8 pounds) of cocaine from  South
America  in May and June 2008. Siyabonga Cwele has declined to
comment on the case and remains in his post.  “The minister is of the view that comment on this matter
might be premature because it is still a matter of the court
processes,” Brian Dube, the minister’s spokesman, said by phone
from  Pretoria . “There is still an appeal.”  Cwele’s bail was extended for the duration of her appeal,
Ramkisson said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
