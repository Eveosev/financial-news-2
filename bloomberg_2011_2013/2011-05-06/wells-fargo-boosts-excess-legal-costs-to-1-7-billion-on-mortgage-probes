Wells Fargo & Co. (WFC) , the nation’s
biggest home lender, raised its estimate of potential excess
legal expenses by 42 percent to a maximum of $1.7 billion as the
bank prepares for new costs tied to its mortgage practices.  The revised estimate as of March 31 was disclosed today in
the San Francisco-based lender’s  quarterly report  to securities
regulators. Wells Fargo had pegged the cost at $1.2 billion as
of year-end.  Attorneys general  in 50 states are investigating mortgage
servicing and foreclosures at the nation’s biggest banks, and
Wells Fargo was among lenders that have signed consent orders
with federal regulators designed to curb any abuses. The bank
said regulators could still seek civil penalties from the
investigation while other agencies, including the  Department of
Justice , continue to scrutinize its operations.  “These investigations could result in material fines,
penalties, equitable remedies including requiring default
servicing or other process changes, or other enforcement actions
and result in significant legal costs,” the bank said.  Wells Fargo reiterated that it’s cooperating with the
authorities. The bank, headed by Chief Executive Officer  John Stumpf , reported a $3.8 billion first-quarter profit last month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
