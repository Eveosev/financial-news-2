Oil fell for a fifth day, heading for
its biggest weekly decline since December 2008, after reports
indicated economic weakness in the U.S. and  Europe .  Crude slid more than $5 a barrel in  New York  to its lowest
since Feb. 22 before a Labor Department report that may show the
U.S. generated fewer jobs in April than in March. Yesterday
jobless benefit applications in the U.S. showed a surprise
increase and German factory orders unexpectedly slowed. Goldman
Sachs Group Inc. said  oil prices  may drop further if “economic
data releases in coming days continue to disappoint.”  “Demand concerns are finally outweighing recent supply
fears,” said  Andrey Kryuchenkov , an analyst in London at VTB
Capital, a unit of  Russia ’s second-largest bank. He estimates
prices will average about $100 this quarter. “There has been a
spike in  risk aversion  across the board following persistently
weak macro numbers. But the market tends to overshoot.”  Crude for June delivery dropped as much as $5.17, or 5.2
percent, to $94.63 a barrel in electronic trading on the  New
York Mercantile Exchange . The contract was at $97.80 at 12:03
p.m. London time. Oil has plunged 14 percent this week, the
largest weekly slump since the period ending Dec. 19, 2008.  Yesterday, futures in New York fell $9.44, or 8.6 percent,
to $99.80, the lowest price since March 16 and the biggest
percentage drop since April 20, 2009.  Brent crude  for June settlement fell as much at $5.65, or
5.1 percent, to $105.15 a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures
Europe exchange. Yesterday, it plunged $10.39, or 8.6 percent,
to $110.80, the lowest since March 16.  U.S. Labor Market  The  London  contract has fallen 13 percent this week. That
would be íts biggest weekly decline since Dec. 5, 2008. Brent’s
premium over the U.S. benchmark, West Texas Intermediate, rose
for the second time in a week, to $11.42 a barrel.  Applications for jobless benefits in the U.S. jumped by
43,000 to 474,000 in the week ended April 30, Labor Department
figures showed. Economists in a Bloomberg News survey estimated
they would fall to 410,000. A report today may show employers in
the world’s largest economy hired 185,000 additional workers in
April, compared with 216,000 in March.  Oil has gained 10 percent in New York this year as unrest
in the Middle East and North Africa toppled leaders in Tunisia
and  Egypt  and spread to Libya, Algeria, Bahrain, Iran, Oman,
Syria and Yemen.  “Perhaps the world is feeling less tense about the
future,” Qatari Oil Minister Mohammed Bin Saleh Al Sada said
today in Doha. Supplies of oil are “very healthy,” he said.  Oil may drop further as U.S. supplies remain at a six-month
high and as European Central Bank President Jean-Claude Trichet’s indicated the ECB may wait to raise  interest rates , a
Bloomberg News survey showed.  Fifteen of 30 analysts, or 50 percent, forecast oil will
decrease through May 13. Ten respondents, or 33 percent,
predicted prices will increase and five projected little change.
Last week, 60 percent of respondents said futures would gain.  To contact the reporter on this story:
