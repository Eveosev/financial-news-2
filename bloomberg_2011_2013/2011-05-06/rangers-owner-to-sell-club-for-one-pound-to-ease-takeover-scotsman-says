David Murray is likely to sell  Rangers
Football Club Plc (RFC) , the Scottish soccer champions, for one pound
($1.64), to facilitate a takeover by businessman Craig Whyte,
the Scotsman reported, without saying where it got the
information.  Murray had been aiming to recoup the six million pounds he
paid in 1988 for a 93 percent stake, the newspaper said.  Selling the Glasgow-based club for a token sum is a way of
ensuring the transaction is completed, and the takeover may be
announced today, once a single outstanding issue has been
resolved, the Scotsman said.  While Murrayâ€™s stake has a current book value of 10 million
pounds, the club owes 22 million to  Lloyds Banking Group Plc (LLOY) ,
making his shares effectively worthless, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
