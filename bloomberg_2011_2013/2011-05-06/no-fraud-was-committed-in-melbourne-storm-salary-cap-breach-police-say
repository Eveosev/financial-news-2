No fraud-related offenses were
committed as part of the salary cap breaches by the Melbourne
Storm National Rugby League team, police in Victoria state said.  After a 10-month investigation, Victoria Police said in a
 statement  today that detectives had uncovered no evidence of
fraud and that it “will be taking no further action in relation
to the matter.” While investigators had identified some
offenses relating to the falsification of statutory declarations,
some of them were made outside of Victoria.  “We have decided not to pursue this line of enquiry as to
do so would be extremely resource intensive and there is a high
probability it would not result in any charges being laid,”
Victoria Police said in the statement.  The NRL stripped the Storm of the 2007 and 2009 NRL titles
13 months ago for deliberate long-term breaches of the salary
cap and ruled the club would play for no points in the 2010
season. The club was also fined A$500,000 ($536,100) and forced
to hand back A$1.1 million in prize money.  In July, an audit released by the club’s owner News Ltd.,
the Australian unit of  News Corp. (NWSA) , showed that the Storm made
player payments outside the NRL salary cap of about A$3.2
million between 2006 and 2010.  Victoria Police added in the statement that the “criminal
environment is not the most suitable way to prosecute this
matter” and that “other regulatory agencies” have some
jurisdiction in relation to the cap breaches.  To contact the reporter on this story:
