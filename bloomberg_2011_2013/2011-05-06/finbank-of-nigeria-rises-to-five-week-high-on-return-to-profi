Finbank Plc (FIRSTINL) , a Nigerian lender bailed
out by the central bank two years ago, rose to a more than five-
week high after reporting a return to full-year profit.  The stock gained 3 kobo, or 4.1 percent, to 76 kobo by 2:07
p.m. in Lagos, the highest since March 29.  Net income was 14.5 billion naira ($93.7 million) for the
12 months through December from a loss of 149.77 billion for the
preceding 14 months, the Lagos-based lender said in a statement
published in Punch newspaper today. Revenue declined to 24.3
billion naira from 72.4 billion naira, it said.  First City Monument Bank Plc signed a memorandum of
understanding to merge with and recapitalize Finbank, FCMB
spokesman Kenny Aliu said yesterday. The central bank fired
eight chief executives of  Nigeria ’s 24 banks after a debt crisis
in 2008 and 2009 threatened the country’s banking industry with
collapse. The regulator bailed out the industry with 620 billion
naira, with Finbank as one of the beneficiaries.  To contact the reporter on this story:
