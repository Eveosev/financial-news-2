American employers in April added more
jobs than forecast and the labor market in the prior two months
was stronger than initially estimated, indicating the world’s
largest economy is weathering the impact of higher fuel prices.  Payrolls expanded by 244,000 last month, the biggest gain
since May 2010, after a revised 221,000 increase the prior
month, the Labor Department said today in Washington. The
jobless rate climbed to 9 percent, the first increase since
November, a separate survey of households showed. Employment was
forecast to grow by 185,000 last month, according to the median
estimate of economists surveyed by Bloomberg News.  Stocks jumped after four days of losses and the dollar
rallied as the report eased concern that the economic recovery
is cooling. The figures bolster Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke ’s forecast for a labor market that is “improving
gradually.”  “This is good news, and it’s getting better,”  James Glassman , senior economist at JPMorgan Chase & Co. in New York,
said in a radio interview on “Bloomberg Surveillance” with  Tom
Keene . “People increasingly are becoming more confident that we
are on a recovery track.”  March payrolls were revised up from a previously reported
gain of 216,000, and February employment increased 235,000 after
a prior estimate of 194,000. April payroll projections in the
Bloomberg survey of 86 economists ranged from gains of 118,000
to 325,000, while the jobless rate was projected to hold at 8.8
percent.  Shares Rally  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index advanced 0.4 percent to
1,340.2 at the 4 p.m. close in  New York .
IntercontinentalExchange Inc.’s Dollar Index, used to track the
greenback against the currencies of trading partners including
the euro and yen, rose 0.8 percent to 74.785.  The economy has generated 760,000 private jobs in the past
three months, the report showed. Overall, companies added 2.1
million jobs since last February, after the loss of 8.8 million
as a result of the 18-month recession that ended in June 2009.  “So much for the headwinds of higher gasoline prices the
economy is facing,” said  Chris Rupkey , chief financial
economist at Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ Ltd. in New York.  Private hiring, which excludes government agencies, rose by
268,000 in April, more than the 200,000 median forecast in the
Bloomberg survey and the most since February 2006, after a
231,000 increase in March.  Railroad Hiring  Among companies adding workers is  Norfolk Southern Corp. (NSC) 
The fourth-biggest U.S. railroad is expanding payrolls as it
benefits from higher shipping volumes. First-quarter profit
excluding some items was $1 a share, topping the 90-cent average
estimate from 27 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  “We still have a need for additional employees for the
business that we’ve got out there,” Mark Manion, chief
operating officer of Norfolk Southern, said in an April 27
teleconference. “There is a need to hire for our current
business as well as hiring for the growth that’s anticipated in
the first -- this year and on into 2012.”  The separate survey of households showed the size of the
labor force was little changed in April and employment shrank by
190,000. That pushed the share of the population in the  labor
force  down to 58.4 percent from 58.5 percent a month earlier.  “The labor market has shown further improvement,”
William C. Dudley, president of the  Federal Reserve Bank of New
York , said in a speech after today’s report. “Yet the recovery
remains moderate and we still have a considerable way to go to
meet the Fed’s dual mandate of full employment and price
stability.”  Obama Ratings  The report is a boost for President  Barack Obama , whose
administration is locked in negotiations with Republican leaders
in Congress to reduce record budget deficits. The president’s
approval ratings got a lift in public opinion polls after the
killing of al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden.  Americans remained concerned about the economy, which is
likely to be the top issue in the 2012 presidential election. In
a New York Times/CBS poll conducted May 2-3, 57 percent of those
surveyed said they approved of the job Obama is doing, up from
46 percent who approved last month. Thirty-four percent approved
of how Obama is handling the economy and 55 percent disapproved.  The jobs report “is obviously good news,” White House
press secretary  Jay Carney  said aboard Air Force One as Obama
traveled to an event in Indianapolis, adding, “We obviously
have a lot more work to do.”  Government payrolls decreased by 24,000 in April, the sixth
straight decline. Local-government employment dropped by 14,000.  Manufacturing Jobs  Factory payrolls increased by 29,000 last month, exceeding
the survey forecast of a 20,000 gain, after a 22,000 rise in
March.  “We are going to be hiring and growing employment in Puget
Sound and in  South Carolina  over the foreseeable future,” Jim McNerney, chief executive officer of Chicago-based plane maker
Boeing Co., said on an April 27 teleconference. “Production
rates are fueling really an unprecedented growth for commercial
airplanes.”  Employment at service-providers rose 200,000 in April after
a 184,000 gain the prior month. The health care industry added
37,300 workers in April. Construction payrolls increased on a
pickup in heavy and civil engineering employment.  Retail trade employment increased by 57,100 last month,
which may have reflected the effects of an Easter holiday that
occurred later this year than last, making seasonal adjustment
difficult for the Labor Department.  Jobs Recovery ‘Slow’  While payrolls have grown each month since October,
Bernanke said on April 27 that central bankers would like to see
more strength in the U.S. job market, noting that a recovery has
been “quite slow.”  “The labor market is improving gradually,” Bernanke said
to reporters during the first-ever press conference following a
Federal Open Market Committee meeting. “We would like to make
sure that that is sustainable.”  Fed policy makers last week decided to complete their
program to buy $600 billion in Treasuries through June to boost
the economy. At the same time, Bernanke said the Fed would
maintain record monetary stimulus and keep its balance sheet
steady by reinvesting proceeds of maturing securities.  Economic growth slowed to a 1.8 percent annual rate in the
first quarter after expanding at a 3.1 percent pace in the last
three months of 2010, according to Commerce Department figures.  Food, Fuel  Rising fuel and grocery bills are squeezing the budgets of
households whose spending makes up 70 percent of the economy and
damping  consumer confidence . The Bloomberg Consumer Comfort
Index decreased to minus 46.2 in the week ended May 1, the
lowest level since the end of March, from minus 45.1 the prior
period.  Regular gasoline was $3.99 a gallon on May 4, the highest
since July 2008, according to AAA, the nation’s biggest motoring
organization. Food costs rose 0.8 percent in March, also the
most since July 2008, consumer-price index data from the Labor
Department showed last month.  Higher incomes are helping make up for the price increases.
Average hourly earnings climbed by 3 cents to $22.95 in April,
today’s report showed, while the average work week for all
employees held at 34.3 hours.  The data also showed a decrease in long-term unemployed
Americans. The number of people unemployed for 27 weeks or more
fell to 43.4 percent of all job-seekers from 45.5 percent a
month earlier.  To contact the reporter on this story:
