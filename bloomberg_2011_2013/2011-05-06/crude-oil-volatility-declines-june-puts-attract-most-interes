Oil options volatility decreased as
the underlying futures fell a fifth day in  New York , capping a
15 percent drop this week.  Implied volatility for at-the-money options expiring in
June, a measure of expected price swings in futures and a gauge
of options prices, was 37.8 percent as of 2 p.m. in New York,
down from 39.9 percent yesterday. June $90 and $95 puts were the
most active in electronic trading.  Volatility reached an 8-week high yesterday as futures
plunged the most in more than 2 years.  “The correction brings an opportunity to go long through
 call options  on longer-dated maturities,”  Harry Tchilinguirian ,
BNP’s London-based head of commodity-markets strategy, said in a
telephone interview today. “You have a number of strikes
anywhere from $120 to $150 on longer-dated maturities that
automatically become cheaper.”  Traders snatched up August $125 calls yesterday as futures
dropped. The contract’s open interest jumped 9,968 contracts,
according to Nymex data compiled by Bloomberg. That was the
largest increase, followed by September $125 calls, which added
6,513 lots.  Crude oil for June delivery fell $2.62 to $97.18 a barrel,
the lowest settlement on the  New York Mercantile Exchange  since
March 15.  June Puts Active  The most active contracts in electronic trading today were
June $95 puts, with 5,211 lots changing hands. They gained 47
cents to $1.66 a barrel at 3:09 p.m. June $90 puts, the next-
most active option, rose 10 cents to 50 cents a barrel with
4,138 contracts trading. One contract covers 1,000 barrels of
crude.  Nymex distributes real-time data for electronic trading and
releases information on floor trading, where the bulk of options
trading occurs, the next business day.  June $100 puts were the most active options traded in the
previous session, with 26,752 lots changing hands. They
increased $2.74 to $2.95 a barrel. The next-most active option,
July $120 calls, fell 73 cents to 50 cents a barrel on 18,986
lots.  Open interest was highest for December 2012 $80 puts with
46,601 contracts. Next were June 2011 $150 calls with 44,097 and
December 2011 $120 calls with 39,295.  To contact the reporter on this story:
