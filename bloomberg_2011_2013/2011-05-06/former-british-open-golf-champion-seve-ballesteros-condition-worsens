The condition of former British Open
golf champion Seve Ballesteros, who underwent brain surgery
three years ago, has worsened severely, his family said in a
statement.  Ballesteros,  Europe ’s most successful golfer, had three
operations in 2008 to treat a malignant tumor, and another one
to fix a bone problem. His family updated his condition today on
 his website.   The Spaniard won the British Open three times and the
Masters Tournament twice while taking 87 titles globally,
including a record 48 on the European Tour. He also played in
the Ryder Cup eight times, winning three, and captained the
victorious European team in 1997. Last year,  Colin Montgomerie 
gathered his team to telephone Ballesteros, who was too ill to
attend, in preparation for their successful attempt to win back
the cup at Celtic Manor in Wales.  His family said it would continue to make public any
developments on Ballesteros’ website.  Ballesteros, 54, had the operations to remove the brain
tumor and related surgery over two months after collapsing at
Madrid airport in 2008 as he was about to board a flight to
 Germany .  After chemotherapy, he returned to public life the
following year and has made several appearances to promote his
charity that funds brain tumor research. He retired from
professional golf in 2007.  To contact the reporters on this story:
