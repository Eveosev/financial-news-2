Gasoline was little changed as the
U.S. added the most jobs since May 2010 last month, lessening
concern that higher fuel prices will reduce demand even as the
 unemployment rate  increased.  Futures swung between gains and losses as the Labor
Department reported payrolls rose by 244,000 workers in April.
Economists in a survey by Bloomberg News projected an increase
of 185,000. Employment excluding government jobs jumped the most
in five years. The jobless rate climbed to 9 percent, the first
advance since November.  “When we saw a better-than-expected increase in jobs, the
market popped up,” said  Gene McGillian , an analyst and broker
at Tradition Energy in  Stamford ,  Connecticut . “Yesterday’s
plunge has the market very skittish. The battle between how the
economy is playing out is still going on.”  Gasoline for June delivery slipped 0.53 cent to settle at
$3.0901 a gallon on the  New York Mercantile Exchange , after
trading between $2.9856 and $3.1822. Prices sank 11 percent
since April 29, the first weekly loss since March.  The premium of June futures over July increased to a 9-
month high of 9.45 cents a gallon from 7.26 cents yesterday as
supplies in Padd 1 were the lowest since October 2008, according
to Energy Department data. The region includes New York Harbor,
the delivery point of the Nymex gasoline contract.  “The spread is a function of tight Padd 1 supply,” said
 Tom Knight , vice president of trading and supply at Truman
Arnold Cos. in Texarkana,  Texas .  Total gasoline stockpiles fell 11 consecutive weeks through
April 29, losing 1.05 million barrels to 204.5 million. Gasoline
inventories have shed 36.6 million barrels, or 15 percent, since
Feb. 11.  Mississippi Flooding  Futures yesterday plunged 22.71 cents, or 6.8 percent, the
largest price drop since Sept. 29, 2008. The slide was part of
the biggest selloff in commodities in two years as a rise in the
dollar versus the euro made materials priced in the U.S.
currency less attractive to foreign investors. A jump in U.S.
first-time jobless claims increased concern that fuel demand
would shrink.  “People were just slow to react after yesterday’s selloff,
but the market is now taking in the fact that the jobs report is
better than expected, equities are up,” said Fred Rigolini,
vice president of Paramount Options Inc. in  New York  and a
broker at the New York Mercantile Exchange.  2011 Rally  Futures had gained 35 percent this year through May 4 as
the dollar dropped 11 percent and U.S. gasoline supplies slid to
a 22-month low. The rally boosted pump prices toward $4 a
gallon, causing fuel consumption to decline.  Gasoline demand dropped 2.2 percent in the week ended April
29 to 8.94 million barrels a day, according to Energy Department
data. On a four-week average, gasoline consumption was 1.9
percent lower than a year earlier, wider than the 1.6 percent
drop the prior week.  Regular retail gasoline fell 0.1 cent to $3.984 a gallon
yesterday, AAA said on its website.  Heating oil for June delivery dropped 4.12 cents, or 1.4
percent, to $2.8457 a gallon on the exchange, following
yesterday’s 8.2 percent plunge, which was the biggest percentage
drop since Feb. 17, 2009. Prices retreated 13 percent this week.  To contact the reporter on this story:
