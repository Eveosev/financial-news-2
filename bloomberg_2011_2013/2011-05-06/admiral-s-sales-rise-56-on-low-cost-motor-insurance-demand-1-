Admiral Group Plc (ADM) , the U.K. car
insurer that owns the confused.com website, said first-quarter
sales rose 56 percent as demand for low-cost car insurance
increased.  Revenue climbed to 539 million pounds ($884 million) in the
three months to March 31, compared with 345 million pounds a
year earlier, the Cardiff, Wales-based firm said today in a
statement. The stock climbed 2.1 percent to 1697 pence at the
close in  London , the most in more than a fortnight, valuing the
firm at about 4.6 billion pounds.  “Admiral’s U.K. car insurance business had another great
quarter and has continued to benefit from positive market
conditions,” Chief Executive Officer Henry Engelhardt said in
the statement. “We grew rapidly and were also able to raise
premiums.”  Admiral, which has lower costs and better underwriting than
rivals such as Aviva Plc and  RSA Insurance Group Plc (RSA) , is seeking
to win additional customers by selling cheaper policies to
motorists, its main market. Car insurance premiums in the U.K.
have risen by a third in the past year as personal injury claims
rose, according to the Automobile Association Ltd.  Admiral’s performance so far this year puts it “on track
to at least meet analysts’ consensus profit estimates for
2011,” the company said. The number of vehicles insured by
Admiral increased 33 percent in the period to 2.9 million.  To contact the reporter on this story:
