Moroccan police probing the April 28
bombing of a Marrakesh restaurant frequented by tourists
arrested three suspects "including the main perpetrator of the
terrorist act," El Pais reported, citing a government statement.  The main suspect in the attack that left 16 people dead and
24 injured, had a "jihadist ideology and links to al-Qaeda," the
report said, citing the Interior Ministry statement. The
individual once tried to emigrate to Chechnya and  Iraq  and
learned to make bombs on the Internet, the report said.  Morrocan investigators are receiving help from the FBI,
Scotland Yard, French antiterrorist officials and  Spain â€™s Tedax
bombing experts, the newspaper said.   Click here for web link  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
