U.S. stocks trimmed gains and the euro
extended losses versus the dollar as European finance officials
held an unsecheduled meeting where they may discuss options for
restructuring Greek debt. Ten-year Treasuries rose for a
seventh-straight day.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index rose 0.1 percent at 2:42
p.m. in  New York , trimming an earlier rally of as much as 1.4
percent. The euro slumped 1.4 percent to $1.4331, while the
Thomson Reuters/Jefferies CRB Index of commodities slid 1.1
percent to extend this week’s drop to 9 percent. Ten-year yields
lost one basis point to 3.14 percent.  Equities pared their advance as two European officials
familiar with the situation said finance officials meeting in
Luxembourg may discuss proposals for restructuring Greece’s
debt. Concern about the meeting wiped out most of an earlier
rally triggered by faster-than-forecast growth in U.S. jobs.  “We’re seeing some knee-jerk reaction in the  currency
market ,” said Kevin Caron, a market strategist in  Florham Park ,
 New Jersey , at Stifel Nicolaus & Co. “The dollar gets a bid as
a haven when there’s concern about risks. As investors bid the
dollar, they sell other things, like commodities and stocks.”  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
