Real Madrid coach  Jose Mourinho  got a
five-game ban from UEFA after ironically applauding a referee’s
decision and suggesting Barcelona gets preferential treatment
from European soccer’s ruling body.  The coach’s ban, which covers European matches, will be
appealed, Real said today on its website. He was also fined
50,000 euros ($72,000), UEFA said in a statement.  Mourinho applauded, gave a thumbs-up sign and said “well
done” to match officials after Real defender Pepe was red-
carded in the first part of a two-game Champions League
semifinal. Barcelona advanced 3-1.  He then said at a news conference that Barcelona is
consistently favored by referees.  Mourinho already served part of the suspension when he
missed the second match against Barcelona,  UEFA  said on its
website. He won’t have to miss a fifth match unless he has
another violation in the next three years, it said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
