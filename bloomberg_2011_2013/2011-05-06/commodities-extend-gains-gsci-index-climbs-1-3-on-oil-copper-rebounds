Commodities extended gains, with crude
oil and metals gaining after the U.S. jobs report signaled
economic growth.  The Standard & Poor’s GSCI Index of 24 commodities climbed
0.8 percent to 689.47 by 3:35 p.m. in  London , after
earlier today falling as much as 3.6 percent. Copper rose 1.1 
percent and crude oil traded in  New York  gained 1 percent.  Payrolls increased by 244,000 workers last month, the
biggest gain since May 2010, after a revised 221,000 gain the
prior month, the Labor Department said today in  Washington .
Economists projected an April rise of 185,000, according to the
median estimate in a Bloomberg News survey.  “The panic that has ensued this week has been proven to be
just that: panic,” said Alexander Ridgers, head of commodities
at CMD Markets in London, which trades more than $400 million of
crude oil a day. “We have seen strong payrolls.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
