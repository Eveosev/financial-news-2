Masdar, the Abu Dhabi government-owned
renewable energy company, is conducting tests to determine the
feasibility of building a wind farm in the  United Arab Emirates .  Masdar is conducting the wind speed measurements in parts
of the UAE though these are at a "very early stage," said
Burgess Baria, the company’s associate account manager for
renewable energy.  Masdar also denied a  report  in The National newspaper on
April 27 that it is developing a 100-megawatt wind farm costing
$200 million on the Saudi border near the coastal town of Silah.
“We have no project under consideration of this nature,” Simon
Warr, Masdar’s head of communications, said in an e-mail.  To contact the reporter on this story:
