Swiss unemployment declined to the
lowest in more than two years in April as companies boosted
their workforce to meet global export demand.  The jobless rate declined to 3.1 percent when adjusted for
seasonal swings from 3.3 percent in March, the State Secretariat
for Economic Affairs in Bern said in an e-mailed statement
today. Thatâ€™s the lowest since February 2009. Economists
expected a decline to 3.2 percent, the median of nine forecasts
in a Bloomberg News survey shows.  The unadjusted jobless rate also fell to 3.1 percent from
3.4 percent in March. The number of job openings decreased by
768 to 21,231 in April.  To contact the reporter on this story:
