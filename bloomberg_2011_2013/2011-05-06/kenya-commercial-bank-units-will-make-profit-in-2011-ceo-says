Kenya Commercial Bank Ltd. (KNCB) , the East
African nation’s biggest lender by outlets, expects all its
units will record profit in the year though December, Chief
Executive Officer Martin Oduor-Otieno said.  “As of the first quarter of this year they have all turned
around,” Oduor-Otieno told reporters today in Nairobi, the
capital. “They have been making losses because we had to invest
heavily in branches” and training employees.  KCB, as the lender is known, has units in neighboring
Tanzania, Uganda, Rwanda and  Southern Sudan . KCB plans to open
10 more outlets in  Kenya , where it already operates 170
branches, Oduor-Otieno said April 29. In Southern  Sudan , three
new offices have already opened this year and one more is
planned, bringing the total to 18. In Uganda and Tanzania, there
are 14 and 11 branches respectively, while Rwanda has nine,
Oduor-Otieno said.  Full-year profit will increase by at least the same margin
as the first quarter as it expands in the region and into agency
banking, Oduor-Otieno said on April 229.  The company’s net income jumped 33 percent to 1.77 billion
shillings ($21.2 million) in the three months through March, it
reported on April 28. Net interest income, the difference
between what banks pay out for deposits and earn for loans,
advanced 32 percent to 5.11 billion shillings.  Shares in KCB have advanced 23 percent so far this year,
compared with a 9 percent decline in the  Nairobi Stock
Exchange ’s benchmark NSE-20 index over the same period.  To contact the reporter on this story:
