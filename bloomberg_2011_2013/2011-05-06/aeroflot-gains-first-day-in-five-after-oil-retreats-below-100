OAO Aeroflot,  Russia ’s biggest
airline, gained the most in almost six months as oil fell.  The shares rose 3.8 percent to 67.35 rubles by the 6:45
p.m. close in Moscow, the strongest advance since Nov. 18.  Crude slumped 8.6 percent yesterday, the biggest drop in
two years. Futures fell as much as 5.2 percent today, before
rebounding 1.6 percent to $101.36 a barrel, leaving them down 11
percent this week.  “Aeroflot is reaping the benefits of lower crude,”  Luis Saenz , London-based director of international sales at the
Otkritie Securities Ltd. brokerage, said in an e-mail today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
