Senegal  sold 10-year dollar bonds, its
first international offering since 2009, at a yield that was
almost three percentage points higher than similarly rated
Nigeria.  The government raised $500 million in the sale of the bonds
2021 that were priced to yield 9.125 percent, a banker with
knowledge of the deal said.  Standard & Poor’s  assigned a B+
assessment, its fourth-highest junk rating, to the West African
nation’s bonds, it said in a statement today. Standard Chartered
Plc and Standard Bank Group Ltd. were underwriters of the sale.  Senegal had expected a yield of between 9.18 percent and
9.38 percent on the debt, whose proceeds will go toward building
a toll road outside of the capital, Dakar, and helping address
the country’s energy shortage,  Standard Chartered  said
yesterday. The yield on Nigeria’s Eurobonds due 2021, which were
sold in January, fell one basis point to 6.16 percent at 3:40
p.m. in London.  “It was priced attractively to entice people to
participate,”  Stuart Culverhouse , chief economist at London-
based Exotix Ltd., said in a phone interview today. “It offers
very good value. There’s not many places out there you can get a
9 percent yield at the moment.”  The yield on Senegal’s 2014 dollar bond, sold in December
2009, fell 24 basis points to 7.54 percent, an all-time low. The
yield on Ghana’s $750 million of bonds due 2017, rated one step
below Senegal at B by S&P, declined six basis points, or 0.06
percentage point, to 6.07 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
