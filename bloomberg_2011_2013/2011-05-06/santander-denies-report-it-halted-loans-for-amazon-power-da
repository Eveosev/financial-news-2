Banco Santander Brasil SA denied it
temporarily suspended financing for the Santo Antonio
hydroelectric dam in  Brazil ’s Amazon region.  Brazilian newspaper  Valor Economico  reported today that the
Sao Paulo-based bank had suspended loans for the project because
of concerns the project will harm the environment and disrupt
communities that live in the region.  Santander continues to lead the group of banks that is
financing Santo Antonio, a dam with the capacity to generate
about 3,400 megawatts of electricity, according to a statement
the bank sent by e-mail today.  Santo Antonio is part of Brazil’s plan to tap Amazon rivers
to produce electricity and prevent shortages as economic growth
stokes demand for energy. The dams include the 25.8 billion-real
($16 billion) Belo Monte project that will flood 516 square
kilometers (199 square miles) of forest and has been criticized
by the Organization of the American States, Avatar director
 James Cameron  and former U.S. President  Bill Clinton .  Santander said it complies with the Ecuador Principles, a
set of guidelines established by the  International Finance
Corporation  to evaluate and manage social and environmental
risks related to project finance.  Brazil’s development bank, known as BNDES, approved a loan
of 6.1 billion reais for the project in December.  To contact the reporter on this story:
