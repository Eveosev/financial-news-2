Cotton rebounded from a three-month
low in New York on speculation that adverse weather in  Texas 
will hurt output in the U.S., the world’s biggest exporter.
 Orange juice  declined.  Parts of Texas, the country’s biggest cotton producer, are
in “extreme” or “exceptional” drought, the most-severe
rankings on the University of Nebraska at Lincoln’s  U.S. Drought
Monitor . Farmers should hold off on planting because the soil is
too dry, the  Texas Agrilife Extension Service  said in a
statement yesterday.  “The outlook for the new crop of cotton is ugly, and the
U.S. crop could be dramatically small,” said Gary Raines, an
economist at FCStone Fibers & Textiles in Nashville,  Tennessee .
“This could work to counteract all the bearishness.”  Cotton for May delivery gained 1.28 cents, or 0.9 percent,
to $1.4814 a pound at 9:56 a.m. on ICE Futures U.S. in  New York .
Earlier, the commodity touched $1.438, the lowest since Jan. 18,
as a stronger dollar reduced investor demand for raw materials
as alternative assets.  Before today, prices tumbled 33 percent since reaching an
all-time high of $2.197 on March 7. The fiber is still up more
than 80 percent in the past year as demand surged in  China , the
largest user and importer.  Orange-juice futures for May delivery dropped 2.75 cents,
or 1.6 percent, to $1.685 a pound on ICE, heading for the third
straight loss.  To contact the reporter on this story:
