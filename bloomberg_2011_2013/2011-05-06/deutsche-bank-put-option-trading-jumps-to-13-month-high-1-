Deutsche Bank AG (DB)  put-options volume
jumped to the highest level since April 2010 in the U.S. as
investors boosted bets that the biggest German bank will retreat
this month.  Almost 9,000 puts to sell Deutsche Bank shares changed
hands at 4 p.m. in New York, 15 times the full-day average
during the past four weeks and 29 times the number of calls to
buy. The Frankfurt-based lender’s American depositary receipts
declined for a fifth day, slumping 2.2 percent to $60.59.  “Investors appear cautious over the coming weeks alongside
today’s underperformance,” strategists at Susquehanna Financial
Group LLLP in  Bala Cynwyd , Pennsylvania, wrote in a report.  Investors creating new bearish positions bought 3,000 May
$60 puts and 2,500 May $55 puts, the strategists said. Those
contracts had an open interest of 736 and 2,813 existing
contracts, respectively, before today. This month’s options
expire two weeks from today. The ADRs haven’t closed below $55
since Jan. 11.  To contact the reporter on this story:
