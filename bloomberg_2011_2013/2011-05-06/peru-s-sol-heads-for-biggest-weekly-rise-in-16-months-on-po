Peru ’s sol headed for the biggest
weekly gain since August after presidential polls showed support
declining for ex-army officer  Ollanta Humala , leading traders to
bet the country’s economic boom will continue.  The sol gained 0.7 percent in the past five days to 2.8075
per U.S. dollar at 10:44 a.m. New York time. That’s the
currency’s steepest weekly advance since January 2010. The sol
was little changed in trading today.  Humala won the first round of elections April 10 with an
eight-point lead over Congresswoman Keiko Fujimori. The
candidates are now virtually tied before next month’s runoff,
according to a poll issued this week by Lima-based Ipsos Apoyo.
Humala pledges to change Peru’s constitution to strengthen the
role of the state in the economy. Fujimori favors policies
supporting foreign investment and privatization.  “People were thinking it’s Humala’s game,” said Dirk Willer, head of Latin America local markets strategy at
Citigroup Inc. in  New York . “Now it’s probably 50:50 and local
investors are thinking Keiko probably has the advantage.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
