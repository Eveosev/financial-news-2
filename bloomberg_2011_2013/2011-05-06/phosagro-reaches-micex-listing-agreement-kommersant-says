OAO PhosAgro, the world’s second
largest maker of phosphate fertilizer, reached an agreement with
Moscow’s Micex exchange to list shares,  Kommersant  said citing a
company statement.  Last month PhosAgro asked Russia’s markets watchdog for
permission to list 21.4 percent of its stock abroad, most likely
on the London Stock Exchange, Kommersant said without citing
anybody.  To contact the reporter on this story:
