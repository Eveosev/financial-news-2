Legal & General Group Plc (LGEN) ’s fund unit
said it backs  National Express Group Plc (NEX)  in its tussle with
hedge fund Elliott Advisors over the makeup of the bus and rail
operator’s executive board.  Elliott, which holds an 18 percent stake in  National
Express , wants other investors to back three candidates it has
proposed adding to the board to help revamp strategy. National
Express Chief Executive Officer Dean Finch said yesterday that
one of the candidates had made the London-based company’s
shortlist.  “We agree with Elliott that the market is undervaluing
National Express’ unique strategic assets,” Robert Churchlow,
head of U.K. equities at London-based Legal & General, said in a
statement. “But we believe that the impressive operational
turnaround delivered by the current management and chairman was
a necessary first step towards demonstrating this value.”  Elliott, the company’s largest shareholder, plans to put
forward its three candidates at the transport company’s annual
shareholder meeting on May 10. L&G holds about 6 percent of
National Express’ shares, Churchlow said. Elliott is a London-
based unit of Elliott Associates, a New York-based hedge fund.  To contact the reporter on this story:
