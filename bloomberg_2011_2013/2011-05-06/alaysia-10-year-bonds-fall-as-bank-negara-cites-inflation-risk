Malaysia’s benchmark 10-year bonds
fell for a fourth day, pushing their yield to a one-week high,
after the central bank raised  interest rates  for the first time
since July to help tame inflation.  The yield on the 4.16 percent note due July 2021 climbed
three basis points, or 0.03 percentage points, to 4.06 percent
as of 9:45 a.m. in  Kuala Lumpur , according to data from Amanah
Butler Sdn., the nation’s biggest money broker. The price
dropped 0.22, or 2.2 ringgit per 1,000 ringgit face amount, to
100.85.  Bank Negara Malaysia raised its overnight policy rate to 3
percent from 2.75 percent in a decision after the market closed
yesterday. There are also “some signs that domestic demand
factors could exert upward pressure on prices in the second half
of the year,” it said in a  statement .  Consumer prices in  Southeast Asia ’s third-largest economy
rose 3 percent in March from a year earlier, the most since
April 2009, the government said last month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
