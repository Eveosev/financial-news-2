Chile  may slow the pace of interest 
rate increases even as it continues its efforts to curb 
inflation, Finance Minister Felipe Larrain told reporters
in Santiago today.  Today’s report by the National Statistics Institute that
Chile’s consumer prices rose 0.3 percent in April from March and
that annual inflation reached 3.2 percent was “good news,”
Larrain said. Global pressures on prices are moderating, as are
inflationary expectations in Chile, Larrain added.  Chile’s central bank estimates annual inflation will exceed
its target range of 2 percent to 4 percent by year-end on higher
fuel prices.  The bank has raised interest rates in 10 of its last 11
monthly meetings. Policy makers accelerated the pace of
increases to a half-point in the last two meetings, saying in
statements accompanying the decision that they would continue to
remove monetary stimulus.  Central bank inflation estimates in Chile have increased
because of higher oil and food prices, policy makers said in the
minutes of their monthly meeting in April.  Chile’s peso strengthened 0.3 percent today to 467.21 per
dollar at 11:22 a.m. New York time.  To contact the reporter on this story:
