Brazilian stocks rallied after four
days of losses, rising the most since February, as monthly
inflation unexpectedly slowed and U.S. employment data exceeded
estimates.  Homebuilders advanced, led by Brookfield Incorporacoes SA,
as traders pared bets for higher borrowing costs, boosting the
outlook for companies that depend on credit growth. Retailer
 Lojas Americanas SA (LAME4)  led gains on the Bovespa stock index after
posting first-quarter earnings that beat estimates.  Tim
Participacoes SA (TCSL4)  jumped after the company said in a filing it
plans to convert all its shares into voting stock.  The Bovespa jumped 1.6 percent to 64,417.33 at the close of
Sao Paulo trading at 4:15 p.m. New York time, the biggest gain
since Feb. 16. The gauge dropped 2.6 percent this week. Fifty-
nine stocks gained on the index while 10 fell. The real
strengthened 0.4 percent to 1.6150 per  U.S. dollar .  The “data signals inflation may be decelerating,” said
Rossano Oltramari, chief analyst for brokerage XP Investimentos
in Rio de Janeiro, in a phone interview. “And U.S. jobs figures
were music to my ears. They brought some relief to the
markets.”  Consumer prices in  Brazil , as measured by the benchmark
IPCA index, rose 0.77 percent last month, pushing the annual
rate to 6.51 percent, the national statistics agency said today
on its website. The annual gain exceeded the 6.50 percent upper
limit of the government’s target range for 2011, but was lower
than the median 6.58 percent increase forecast in a survey of 31
analysts by Bloomberg.  In the interest rates futures market, yields on contracts
due January 2013 dropped 8 basis points, or 0.08 percentage
point, to 12.56 percent.  Payroll Data  U.S. payrolls increased by 244,000 workers last month, the
biggest gain since May 2010, after a revised 221,000 gain the
prior month, the Labor Department said today in  Washington .  Economists projected an April rise of 185,000, according to
the median estimate in a Bloomberg survey. Employment excluding
government jobs jumped the most in five years. The jobless rate
rose to 9 percent, the first increase since November.  Brookfield jumped 5.5 percent to 8.49 reais, the most since
July.  Lojas Americanas rose 9.7 percent to 15.20 reais, the
biggest gain since April 2009. The company said in a statement
first-quarter net income rose 33 percent to 57.1 million ($35.4
million) as it opens more than two stores a month to take
advantage of Brazil’s economic expansion. The median estimate of
seven analysts surveyed by Bloomberg was for profit of 35.3
million reais.  Vale’s Results  Vale SA (VALE3) , the world’s largest iron-ore producer, fell 0.3
percent to 44.35 reais after earlier gaining 1.6 percent. The
company reported record quarterly profit fueled by higher sales
of metals such as nickel and copper.  First-quarter net income rose to $6.83 billion, or $1.29 a
share, from $1.6 billion, or 30 cents, in the year earlier
period, Rio de Janeiro-based Vale said late yesterday in a
filing. The miner was expected to post per-share profit of $1.11
on an adjusted basis, according to the median of 12 estimates
compiled by Bloomberg.  Tim’s preferred shares surged 7.8 percent to 7.48 reais,
the most since December 2008, after the company said it plans to
convert all its shares into voting stock in a bid to be listed
in the so-called Novo Mercado, a section of the  Sao Paulo 
exchange with stricter requirements for disclosure. Only voting
shares can be traded there, according to the exchange’s rules.  The Bovespa index slumped 7.1 percent this year on concern
inflation will spur additional measures to restrict economic
growth. The gauge trades at 10.6 times analysts’ earnings
estimates, according to weekly data compiled by Bloomberg. That
compares to a ratio of 13.6 for the Shanghai Composite Index,
7.3 for  Russia ’s Micex, and 15.2 for  India ’s Sensex.  Investors pulled 3.69 billion reais from  Latin America ’s
biggest equity market this year through April 28, data from the
Sao Paulo exchange show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
