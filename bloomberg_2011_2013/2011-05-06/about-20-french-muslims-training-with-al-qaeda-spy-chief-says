About 20 young French Muslims are
training at al-Qaeda linked camps in  Pakistan , Bernard Squarcini, head of  France ’s domestic intelligence service, said
in an interview with  Le Monde .  The main risk to France remains al-Qaeda in the Islamic
Maghreb, which is based in North Africa’s Sahara region and is
holding four French hostages, Squarcini said, as cited by the
newspaper. AQMI, as it is called in France, recruits locally and
has no French members, he said.  Squarcini said no specific threats against France have been
detected since the death of al-Qaeda founder Osama bin Laden. He
said France is the No. 2 target of the terror group after the
U.S.  To contact the reporter on this story:
