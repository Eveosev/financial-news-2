Former Hungarian Prime Minister  Ferenc Gyurcsany  said he may form a new political movement if the
“last effort” to revamp the Socialist Party after its election
defeat last year fails.  Gyurcsany, a lawmaker who no longer leads the Socialists,
said he will assess whether the overhaul of his party has been
successful between the middle and end of 2012. If not, a
“greenfield political investment” is an option, he told
reporters in Budapest today.  Gyurcsany served as premier for five years until 2009,
unexpectedly beating current Prime Minister  Viktor Orban  in the
2006 election to win a second consecutive term. After eight
years in opposition, Orban returned to power in 2010, when a
coalition led by his Fidesz party won a two-thirds majority in
parliament. The Socialists fell to 15 percent of the 386 seats
in parliament from 48 percent in 2006.  Editors: Andrew Langley, Willy Morris  To contact the reporter on this story:
