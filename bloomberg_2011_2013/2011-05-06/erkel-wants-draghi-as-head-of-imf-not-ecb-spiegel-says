German Chancellor Angela Merkel would
prefer that  Mario Draghi  become a candidate to lead the
International Monetary Fund rather than head the European
Central Bank, German news magazine  Der Spiegel  reported.  Merkel is nervous about a backlash in Germany if she backs
an Italian to succeed  Jean-Claude Trichet  as ECB president, the
magazine reported, citing unnamed officials at the Chancellery.  Merkel last year supported Vitor Constancio’s nomination
for the bank’s vice presidency and would be “uncomfortable”
with an ECB led by bankers from Italy and Portugal, the magazine
said. The IMF’s top post may become vacant if incumbent
Dominique Strauss-Kahn runs for the French presidency in 2012,
Spiegel said.  German Finance Ministry spokesman Martin Kotthaus told
reporters at a regular press conference in Berlin today that
Draghi, who is also Bank of  Italy  governor, is not the only
candidate to replace Trichet at the helm of the ECB.  “As far as I am aware, there are several candidates,”
Kotthaus said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
