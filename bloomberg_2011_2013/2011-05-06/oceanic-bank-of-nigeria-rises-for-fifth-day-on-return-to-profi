Oceanic Bank International Plc (OCEANIC) , the
Nigerian lender bailed out by the central bank two years ago,
had the longest winning streak in four months after reporting a
return to profit in the year through December.  The stock gained for a fifth day, adding 9 kobo, or 4.8
percent, to 1.96 naira by 12:31 p.m. in Lagos.  Net income was 29.8 billion naira ($192.6 million) for the
12 months through December, compared with a loss of 88.62
billion naira a year earlier, the Lagos-based bank said in a
statement on the website of the Nigerian Stock Exchange today.
Revenue declined 44 percent to 110.5 billion naira.  Oceanic has fallen 22 percent this year, compared with a
3.4 percent increase in the  Nigerian Stock Exchange  All-Share
Index over the same period.  To contact the reporter on this story:
