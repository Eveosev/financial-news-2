Turkey ’s internet bans and state-
mandated filtering systems are endangering technology projects
and deterring investment,  Sabah  newspaper said.  A $65 million data center project led by Superonline, the
internet unit of Turkcell Iletisim Hizmetleri AS, which is
intended to be part of a so-called “digital Silk Road,” is
being hurt by the bans, Superonline chief Murat Erkan said,
according to Sabah.  The bans and filters are increasing expenses for technology
service providers, whose call centers are overloaded with calls
from customers complaining about the government restrictions,
Erkan said, according to Sabah.  Turkey last week announced a list of more than 100 words
that were banned from internet domain names, and courts have
frequently shut down websites including Google Inc.’s YouTube,
which was inaccessible for more than a year. More than 450,000
people have joined a Turkish Facebook group called “ Internetime
Dokunma !” or “Don’t Touch My Internet!,” which is planning
country-wide protests against the web bans on May 15.  To contact the reporter on this story:
