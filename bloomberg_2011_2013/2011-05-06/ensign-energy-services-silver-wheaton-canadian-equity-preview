Canadian stocks rose for a second day,
led by raw-materials and energy producers, as an index of
commodities rebounded from its biggest weekly drop since 2008.  Goldcorp Inc. (G) , the world’s second-biggest gold producer by
market value, increased 2.2 percent as precious metals rallied.
 Suncor Energy Inc. (SU) ,  Canada ’s largest oil and gas producer,
climbed 1 percent as oil gained the most in two months.  Forzani
Group Ltd. (FGL) , Canada’s largest sporting-goods retailer, soared 49
percent after agreeing to be bought by Canadian Tire Corp.  The Standard & Poor’s/TSX Composite Index gained 110.53
points, or 0.8 percent, to 13,677.13.  “Things got overdone in the short term,” said  Doug Davis ,
vice chairman of Davis-Rea Ltd. in Toronto, which manages C$450
million ($465 million). “The economy is still recovering, both
in Canada and the U.S.”  The S&P/TSX fell 2.7 percent last week as the Thomson
Reuters/Jefferies CRB Commodity Price Index plunged 9 percent.
Precious metals dropped as CME Group Inc., the owner of the
Comex exchange, raised the amount of cash that must be deposited
when borrowing from brokers to trade silver futures. Fuels
declined after the U.S. reported a decline in gasoline
consumption and increase in natural gas inventories.  Producers of precious metals gained today as investors
speculated last week’s 4.2 percent retreat in gold and 27
percent tumble in silver were overdone.  Mining Shares  Barrick Gold Corp. (ABX) , the world’s largest producer of the
metal, advanced 1.2 percent to C$45.96. Goldcorp increased 2.2
percent to C$48.42.  Silver Wheaton Corp. (SLW) , Canada’s fourth-

percent to C$35.47.  First Majestic Silver Corp. (FR) , which mines in
 Mexico , jumped 8.1 percent to C$19.02.  Crude oil, which sank 15 percent last week, rose 5.5
percent today after  Germany  said exports advanced to a record
last month.  Canadian Oil Sands Ltd., the largest owner of the Syncrude
project, increased 3.2 percent to C$31.85. Suncor advanced 1
percent to C$40.66. Oilfield-services company  Flint Energy
Services Ltd. (FES)  soared 12 percent, the most since June 2009, to
C$15.47 before the release of its first quarter financial
results.  Contract driller  Ensign Energy Services Inc. (ESI)  climbed 4
percent to C$17.71 after reporting first-quarter earnings that
beat the average of 10 analyst estimates by 36 percent,
excluding certain items.  Nexen Inc. (NXY) , an oil and gas producer with operations on five
continents, declined 2.7 percent to C$23.14. The company said it
has suspended operations in Yemen due to a strike and that its
North Sea Buzzard oil field is operating at reduced rates due to
problems with the platform’s cooling system.  Copper Rallies  Industrial-metals producers rose as copper rallied from a
five-month low.  First Quantum Minerals Ltd. (FM) , Canada’s second-largest
publicly traded copper producer, gained 3.1 percent to C$127.50.
Ivanhoe Mines Ltd., which is developing a copper and gold mine
in  Mongolia  with Rio Tinto Group, advanced 5.7 percent to
C$24.67.  Taseko Mines Ltd. (TKO) , which produces copper in British
Columbia, jumped 5.2 percent to C$4.90.  Molybdenum Producer Thompson Creek Metals Co. sank 5.2
percent to a seven-month low of C$10.30 after cutting its 2011
production forecast.  Copper Fox Metals Inc. (CUU) , which is developing a base- and

Tire rose 2.7 percent to C$60.19.  Potash Corp. of Saskatchewan Inc., the world’s largest
fertilizer producer by market value, increased 1.6 percent to

grain handler, climbed 3.8 percent to C$11.50.  Manulife Financial Corp. (MFC) ,  North America ’s fourth-largest
insurer, rose 1.4 percent to C$17.71 after surging 5.1 percent
May 6. On May 5, the company reported first-quarter profit that
topped the average analyst estimate by 56 percent, excluding
certain items.  BlackBerry maker  Research In Motion Ltd. (RIM)  fell 2.6 percent
from a four-year low to C$43.39 after T. Michael Walkley, an
analyst at Canaccord Financial Inc., reduced his 12-month price
estimate on RIM’s U.S.-traded shares to $49 from $61. In a note
to clients, Walkley cited RIM’s market-share losses to Apple
