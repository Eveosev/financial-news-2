U.S. stocks trimmed gains and
commodities erased an earlier advance as the euro weakened
versus the dollar amid speculation that  Greece  may leave the
European Union. Treasuries reversed losses.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index rose 0.6 percent to
1,343.66 at 12:51 p.m. in New York after climbing as much as 1.4
percent. The Thomson Reuters/Jefferies CRB Index of commodities
fell 0.3 percent, while the dollar rallied 1.1 percent to
$1.4379 per euro.  The euro extended its losses after Der Spiegel magazine
reported that debt-strapped Greece is considering withdrawing
from the euro zone and reintroducing its own currency, and that
the European Commission called a meeting to discuss the move. A
spokesman for Luxembourg’s  Jean-Claude Juncker , who leads euro-
region finance ministers, denied the report.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
