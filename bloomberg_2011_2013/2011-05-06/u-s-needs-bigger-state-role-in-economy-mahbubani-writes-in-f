The U.S. needs carefully judged state
intervention and a comprehensive economic plan if it’s to adapt
to global economic realities and remain competitive, said
Kishore Mahbubani, of  Singapore ’s National University.  Writing in the Financial Times, he said manufacturing is
thriving in  China , Germany, Sweden and Singapore because the
governments in those countries set up vocational institutes to
prepare workers for new industries.  China has overtaken the U.S. in green technology because of
a coordinated national response, not just because Chinese
companies have invested, Mahbubani said.  American requests to China and Germany to cut their export
surpluses during the financial crisis showed the U.S. was out of
touch, for it would have been suicidal for Chinese and German
manufacturers to stop supplying customers, he said.  At one time, the  U.S. economy  could set its own course and
the rest of the world had to follow; but now that  Asia  is more
and more central in the global economic system, the U.S. is a
price-taker rather than a price-maker, Mahbubani said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
