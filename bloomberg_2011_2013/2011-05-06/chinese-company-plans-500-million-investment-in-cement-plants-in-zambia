An unidentified Chinese company plans
to invest $500 million to set up two cement manufacturers in
 Zambia , the southern African country’s antitrust commission
said.  The company will build plants in the nation’s Eastern and
Northwestern provinces, Brian Lingela, spokesman for the Lusaka-
based Zambia Competition and Consumer Protection Commission,
said in an e-mailed statement today. Lingela cited Chinese
Ambassador Li Qiangmin on the planned investment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
