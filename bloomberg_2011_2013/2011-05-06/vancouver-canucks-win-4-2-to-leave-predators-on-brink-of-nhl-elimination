The  Vancouver Canucks  won 4-2 to leave
the Nashville Predators on the brink of elimination from the
National Hockey League playoffs.  Ryan Kesler snapped a 2-2 tie for the Canucks with a power-
play goal in the third period and Henrik Sedin sealed the win
with an empty-net score at Bridgestone Arena in Nashville,
Tennessee, last night.  Joel Ward and Cody Franson scored goals for the Predators,
who trail 3-1 ahead of Game 5 in the best-of-seven second round
series in Vancouver tomorrow.  The Canucks have never won the NHL championship and last
reached the Western Conference finals in the 1993-94 season,
when they went on to lose the Stanley Cup finals for the second
time in franchise history.  In todayâ€™s games, the  San Jose Sharks  and Boston Bruins can
sweep the  Detroit Red Wings  and Philadelphia Flyers,
respectively, to advance to the conference finals.  To contact the reporter on this story:
