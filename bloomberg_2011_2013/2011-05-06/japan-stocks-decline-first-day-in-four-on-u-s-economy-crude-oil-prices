Japanese stocks fell for the first
time in four trading days as slower growth in U.S. service
industries, rising jobless claims and the biggest plunge in
commodity prices in almost two years fueled concern the global
economy is stalling.  Toyota Motor Corp. (7203) , the world’s largest carmaker, sank 2.4
percent.  Canon Inc. (7751) , a camera maker that gets more than 80
percent of its revenue overseas, lost 2.3 percent after the yen
rose, cutting the earnings outlook for exporters.  Inpex Corp. (1605) ,
the nation’s No. 1 oil and gas explorer, plunged 6.2 percent.  The Nikkei 225 Stock Average fell 1.5 percent to 9,859.20
at the 3 p.m. close of trading in Tokyo, the steepest drop since
April 12. The broader Topix lost 1.1 percent to 856.50, with
about five shares dropping for every three that gained. Japanese
markets were closed the past three days for national holidays.  “Investors’ optimism about a sustained economic recovery
may be waning after the U.S. economic data,” said Hideo Arimura,
who helps oversee about $2.2 billion at Mizuho Asset Management
Co. in Tokyo. “They may want to take profits.”  The Topix has lost 8 percent since March 10, the day before
a magnitude-9 earthquake and tsunami devastated  Japan ’s
northeast coast, disabled a nuclear power plant and disrupted
supply chains at companies from Toyota to Canon. In the period
through yesterday’s close, the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index
gained 3.1 percent, while the Stoxx Europe 600 Index fell less
than 0.1 percent.  U.S. Economic Data  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index dropped for a fourth day,
falling 0.9 percent to 1,335.10 yesterday in  New York .  Service industries  in the U.S. expanded in April at the
slowest pace in eight months as companies cut back in response
to higher energy costs, according to the  Institute for Supply
Management ’s index of U.S. non-manufacturing companies published
on May 4.  Applications for jobless benefits unexpectedly jumped by
43,000 to 474,000 in the week ended April 30, the most since
August, Labor Department figures showed yesterday.  Also, U.S. consumer confidence dropped last week to the
lowest level in more than a month as rising fuel costs squeezed
American household budgets. The Bloomberg Consumer Comfort Index
decreased to minus 46.2 in the week ended May 1, the lowest
level since the end of March, from minus 45.1 the prior period.  Toyota, Fuji Heavy  Toyota slipped 2.4 percent to 3,210 yen.  Fuji Heavy
Industries Ltd. (7270) , the maker of Subaru cars, lost 2.1 percent to
602 yen. Honda Motor Co., an automaker that gets more than 80
percent of its sales abroad, sank 4.7 percent to 3,075 yen after
the National Business Daily reported the company halted
production at a parts unit in  China  after the earthquake
disrupted supplies.  Carmakers were the heaviest drag on the Topix among its 33
industry groups, followed by electronics manufacturers. Canon,
the world’s biggest camera maker, retreated 2.3 percent to 3,805
yen.  Fanuc Corp. (6954) , a manufacturer of industrial robots that earns
about 75 percent of its revenue overseas, slipped 2.8 percent to
13,160 yen.  Commodities dropped yesterday by the most in almost two
years, paring this year’s gains to 8.2 percent, on concern that
economic growth will slow as central banks seek to cool
inflation by raising borrowing costs.  Oil, Metals  Oil companies  had the biggest decline in the Topix among
its 33 industry groups. Inpex plunged 6.2 percent to 563,000 yen,
the steepest drop in the Nikkei 225, followed by Toho Zinc Co.,
Japan’s third-largest producer of the metal, which tumbled 5.2
percent to 423.  Japan Petroleum Exploration Co. (1662) , the nation’s
second-largest oil explorer, retreated 3.6 percent to 3,760 yen.
Sumitomo Metal Mining Co., Japan’s No. 2 copper smelter, lost
3.9 percent to 1,390 yen.  Crude oil for June delivery plunged 8.6 percent to $99.80 a
barrel yesterday, the lowest settlement in New York since March
16. The London Metal Exchange Index of six metals including
copper and aluminum sank for a second day, falling 4 percent
yesterday, the biggest drop since November 16.  European Central Bank President  Jean-Claude Trichet 
signaled yesterday the bank will wait until after June to raise
 interest rates  again, wrong-footing some investors who had
expected a quicker move to fight inflation. The euro plunged.  Japan’s currency yesterday climbed versus all of its 16
most-traded peers and reached 79.57 against the dollar last
night in  Tokyo , the highest level since March 18, as falling
commodities prompted investors to unwind bets in higher-yielding
assets financed with yen. Against the euro, Japan’s currency
appreciated to 116.15 today from 120.66 at the close of  stock
trading  on May 2. A stronger yen cuts the value of overseas
income at Japanese companies when repatriated.  Nuclear Damages  “It’s very negative for Japanese companies that the yen is
getting stronger than the level they had assumed as their
earnings faltered in the wake of the earthquake,” Mizuho
Asset’s Arimura said, adding many companies assumed a level of
80 yen or 82 yen against the dollar.  Tokyo Electric  Power Co., owner of the Fukushima Dai-Ichi
nuclear plant crippled by the March 11 earthquake and tsunami,
soared 6.8 percent to 455 yen, the biggest gain in the  Nikkei
225 (NKY) , after Asahi newspaper reported on May 3 the government
estimated that total damages to be paid to victims of the
disaster would amount to 4 trillion yen ($50 billion). The total
may include about 2 trillion yen by Tokyo Electric, which is
expected to raise electricity prices to help pay for
compensation, the report said.  Japan’s Chief Cabinet Secretary Yukio Edano today said the
Cabinet hasn’t discussed allowing the utility to increase
electricity fees to help pay compensation from the accident at
the nuclear plant.  To contact the reporter on this story:
