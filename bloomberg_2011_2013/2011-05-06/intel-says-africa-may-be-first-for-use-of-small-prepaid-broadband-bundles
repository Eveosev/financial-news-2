Intel Corp. (INTC) , the world’s biggest
chipmaker, said small, prepaid bundles of broadband may be
piloted in  Africa .  “Africa can be the first continent to do prepaid broadband
in very small packages, such as paying 10 cents for 15
megabits,” John E. Davies, general manager of Intel’s World
Ahead program, said in an interview at the  World Economic Forum 
on Africa being held in  Cape Town  today. “Africa and Southeast
Asia will drive prepaid broadband,” Davies, who works with
governments to help bring wireless connectivity to disadvantaged
communities, said.  Africa’s population is estimated at 1 billion people and by
2015, 221 million consumers will advance from destitution to
basic-needs status, making from $1,000 to $5,000 a year,
according to a McKinsey & Co. analysis of data from IHS Global
Insight. Mobile-phone penetration is about 80 percent in much of
sub-Saharan Africa, according to Arnold Ekpe, chief executive
officer of  Ecobank Transnational Inc. (ETI)   “The billing systems are already there, the mobile
operators have done it with phones, so now we’ve got to do the
same with PC broadband,” Davies said. “With mining, farming,
fishing and tourism, many of Africa’s activities are still
rural, but we can connect them.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
