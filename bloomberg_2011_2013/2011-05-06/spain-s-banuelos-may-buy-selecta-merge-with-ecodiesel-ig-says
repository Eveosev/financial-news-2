Spanish billionaire Enrique Banuelos
may buy control of Brazilian soybean processor Sementes Selecta
and merge it with his Brasil Ecodiesel Industria & Comercio de
Biocombustiveis & Oleos Vegetais SA, news website  IG  said,
without saying where it got the information.  Banuelo’s Veremonte Participacoes SA may pay in cash and
shares to acquire 80 percent of Selecta, Sao Paulo-based IG said
today.  A spokesman for Veremonte, who can’t be named because of
the company’s policy, didn’t immediately return a telephone call
or an e-mail from Bloomberg News seeking comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
