Vietnam ’s benchmark five-year bonds
fell this week after the country’s central bank raised three key
policy rates as part of attempts to combat accelerating
inflation. The dong weakened.  The  State Bank  of Vietnam increased refinancing and
repurchase rates to 14 percent from 13 percent, and lifted the
discount rate to 13 percent from 12 percent over the last seven
days, as officials intensify the fight against the fastest rise
in consumer prices in 28 months. Inflation surged to 17.51
percent in April from a year earlier, stoked by increases in
fuel and electricity costs.  “Local institutions are staying on the sidelines due to
inflation concerns and high deposit rates,” said Nguyen Thi Ngoc Anh, the Ho Chi Minh City-based head of fixed-income
trading at  Asia Commercial Bank . Bonds also fell after the
latest government bond auction saw five-year debt sold with a
higher coupon than offered in previous sales, she said.  The yield on five-year bonds rose 30 basis points, or 0.3
percentage point, this week to 12.77 percent according to daily
fixing prices from banks compiled by Bloomberg. The rate
advanced 10 basis points from yesterday.  The dong weakened 0.2 percent this week to 20,580 per
dollar as of 4:20 p.m. in Hanoi, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The currency gained 0.2 percent today.  Vietnam’s State Treasury sold 555 billion dong ($27 million)
of five-year bonds at auction yesterday with a coupon of 13.2
percent, the Hanoi Stock Exchange said in a statement on its
website. The government offered a maximum coupon of 13 percent
in an April 28 auction, which failed to attract any buyers.  The central bank fixed the reference rate at 20,703,
compared with 20,708 yesterday, according to its website. The
currency is allowed to trade up to 1 percent on either side of
the rate.  -- Nicholas Heath . Editors: Andrew Janes, Sandy Hendry  To contact the reporter on this story:
