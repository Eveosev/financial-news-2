Private-equity officials say they are
concerned by rising levels of debt in buyouts, the Financial
Times reported.  In some instances, debt levels have reached seven times
operating profit, a level hardly seen since the credit crisis
started, the newspaper said.  Joseph Schull, European head at  Warburg Pincus , and Howard Marks, chairman of Oaktree Capital Management, said market
participants should be cautious about repeating the mistakes of
the previous credit bubble, the newspaper reported.  The average debt multiple for larger buyouts, or net debt
to earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization
rose to more than five times earnings in the first quarter in
 Europe  and the U.S. from a low of 4.5 and 4 respectively in
2009, the newspaper said, citing  Standard & Poorâ€™s .  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
