Arturo Valenzuela, the Obama
administration’s top diplomat for  Latin America , will resign in
the next few months, the State Department announced today.  Valenzuela, who has served as assistant secretary of state
for  Western Hemisphere affairs  since November 2009, will return
to teaching at  Georgetown University  in  Washington , State
Department spokesman Mark Toner said.  In coming to the State Department, Valenzuela took a leave
from his position as professor of government and director of the
Center for Latin American Studies at Georgetown’s Edmund A.
Walsh  School of Foreign Service .  Valenzuela previously served in the White House under
President Bill Clinton as special assistant to the president and
senior director for inter-American affairs at the National
Security Council and as deputy assistant secretary for inter-
American affairs at the State Department.  Chris Sabatini, senior director for policy at the Council
of the Americas, a New York-based business organization focusing
on Latin America, said Valenzuela had inherited difficult
situations, such as the decades-long trade embargo on Cuba, and
had trouble crafting a single U.S. policy that could serve the
entire region.  “There was a problem of crafting a coherent, modern vision
of the U.S.’s relation with the hemisphere,” Sabatini said in a
telephone interview from  New York . “Under him, the State
Department failed to reflect the diversity and dynamism of the
region.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
