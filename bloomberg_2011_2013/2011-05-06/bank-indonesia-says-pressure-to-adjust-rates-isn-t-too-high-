The pressure for  Bank Indonesia  to
adjust  interest rates  is “not too high” even after core
inflation accelerated in April, Governor Darmin Nasution said.  “We will continue monitoring the inflationary pressure
from commodity prices,” Nasution told reporters in Jakarta
today. At the same time, the central bank is still in a
tightening mode as inflation may accelerate in the third and
fourth quarters of 2011, he said.  Indonesia’s inflation slowed for a third straight month to
6.16 percent in April as food prices declined during the harvest
period. Core inflation accelerated to 4.62 percent from 4.45
percent.  Growth in Southeast Asia’s largest economy slowed last
quarter as  government spending  eased, boosting scope to extend a
pause in interest-rate increases. All nine economists surveyed
by Bloomberg News expect the central bank to refrain from
raising borrowing costs when policy makers meet May 12.  The rupiah has climbed 4.6 percent against the dollar this
year as officials permit gains to restrain price pressures
fueled by economic growth.  To contact the reporter on this story:
