Oil climbed from the lowest in almost
two months in  New York , trimming the biggest weekly decline in a
year, on speculation a drop below $100 a barrel was exaggerated.  Futures increased as much as 1.2 percent after sliding 8.6
percent yesterday following worse-than-expected U.S. economic
data. Oil broke through the lower Bollinger Band, a technical
signal which typically indicates prices are poised to rise. A
Labor Department report today may show the U.S. generated fewer
jobs in April than in March.  “It could be a relief rally after an aggressive sell-off
yesterday,” said Serene Lim, a commodity strategist at
Australia & New Zealand Banking Group Ltd. in  Singapore , who
predicted oil will average $111 this year. “Traders will be
very cautious at this time because tonight’s payroll data will
be something to watch out for.”  Crude for June delivery gained as much as $1.15 to $100.95
a barrel in electronic trading on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange . The contract was at $100.29 at 1:45 p.m. Singapore
time. Yesterday, it fell $9.44 to $99.80, the lowest since March
16 and the biggest percentage drop since April 20, 2009.  Oil last closed below the bottom Bollinger band on Jan. 25.
Prices rose 7 percent over the next five days. Crude’s relative
strength index, a measure of how rapidly prices are rising or
falling, slipped to 32 yesterday, the lowest since Aug. 24. A
reading of 30 typically indicates the commodity is set to climb.  Jobless Benefits  Prices are down 12 percent this week, the most since the
week ended May 7, 2010, and are 31 percent higher the past year.
Oil plunged yesterday after a surprise increase in U.S. jobless
claims and a gain in the dollar.  Applications for jobless benefits in the U.S. jumped by
43,000 to 474,000 in the week ended April 30, Labor Department
figures showed. Economists in a Bloomberg News survey estimated
they would fall to 410,000. A report today may show employers in
the world’s largest economy hired 185,000 additional workers in
April, compared with 216,000 in March.  The Labor Department report today is “the most important
data we’ve had all week,” said  Jonathan Barratt , managing
director of Commodity Broking Services Pty in Sydney, who
predicted oil will average $100 this year. “The market has
started to realign itself with proper fundamentals.”  Commodity Plunge  The Dollar Index, a measure of the greenback against six
major currencies, surged 1.5 percent yesterday to 74.12 in the
biggest one-day gain since October. It was at 74.10 today. A
stronger dollar reduces the attractiveness to investors of
commodities, which dropped the most since 2009.  Brent crude  for June settlement added as much as $1.85, or
1.7 percent, to $112.65 a barrel, on the London-based ICE
Futures Europe exchange. Yesterday, it plunged $10.39, or 8.6
percent, to $110.80, the lowest since March 16.  The European benchmark traded at a premium of $11.66 a
barrel to U.S. futures today. The difference between front-month
contracts in  London  and New York surged to a record $19.54 on
Feb. 21. The spread averaged 76 cents last year.  Oil in New York may find support around the $99 to $96
level as it’s near the 50 percent Fibonacci retracement level,
said  Stephen Schork , president of The Schork Group Inc. a
Villanova, Pennsylvania-based consultant. That level is now at
$97.44 a barrel based on Bloomberg data over a six-month period.  Fibonacci analysis is based on the theory that securities
tend to rise or fall by specific percentages after reaching new
highs or lows.  Oil Options  The price of the most actively traded oil options, June
$100 puts, rose 1,305 percent. The contract, which gives the
holder the right to sell crude for June delivery at $100 a
barrel, climbed to $2.95 yesterday from 21 cents on May 4, with
14,904 traded. It was at $2.73 today.  Oil has gained 10 percent in New York this year as unrest
in the Middle East and North Africa toppled leaders in Tunisia
and  Egypt  and spread to  Libya ,  Algeria ,  Bahrain ,  Iran ,  Oman ,
Syria and Yemen. The Obama administration said it will permit
Libyan rebels to draw on the $33 billion in Libyan assets frozen
by U.S., as allied nations opposing  Muammar Qaddafi  looked for
further measures to force him from power.  To contact the reporter on this story:
