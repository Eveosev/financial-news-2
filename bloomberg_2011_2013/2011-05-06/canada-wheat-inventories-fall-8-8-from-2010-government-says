Canada ’s wheat inventories as of March
31 were 8.8 percent smaller than a year earlier at 15.6 million
metric tons, Statistics Canada said today. Durum wheat supplies
plunged 39.7 percent to 2.87 million metric tons.  Canola stockpiles at the end of March were estimated at
4.85 million tons, down 22.8 percent from 2010, the Ottawa-based
government agency said. Barley inventories fell 31 percent to
3.52 million metric tons on March 31.  “The supply is down after weather reduced last year’s
harvest,” said Ron Frost, a cash grain consultant at The Frost
Forecast in Calgary. “We have a tightening supply scenario
developing for canola, especially if we continue to have
difficulty planting this year’s crops” after rain and snow
delayed seeding the last two weeks, Frost said before the
report.  The data come from a survey of 12,600 farmers conducted
between March 24 and March 31,  Statistics Canada  said. The
agency gives its preliminary field-crop seeded areas on June 23.  To contact the reporter on this story:
