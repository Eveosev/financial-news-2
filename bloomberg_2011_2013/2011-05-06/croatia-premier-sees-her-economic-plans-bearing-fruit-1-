The Croatian government’s efforts to
spark the economy through investment in the Adriatic Sea nation
are “bearing fruit” and there is no reason to revise growth
estimates, Prime Minister Jadranka Kosor said.  Gross Domestic Product of  Croatia , which seeks to join the
European Union as soon as in 2012, may grow 1.5 percent this
year, Kosor said today at a press conference in Zagreb,
reiterating her previous view. Her estimate for a 2011 budget
deficit of 4.3 percent of GDP is also unchanged from November.  Central bank Governor Zeljko Rohatinski yesterday predicted
the country is only at the beginning of a “long, slow
recovery” and may only grow 1 percent this year.  Croatia has been in recession since 2008 and the economy
contracted 1.4 percent last year. The nation is in the final
state of negotiations with the European Union, and hopes to join
the bloc in 2012 or early 2013.  Kosor said her economic recovery program started in April
2010, which seeks investors for projects worth 14 billion euros
($20 billion), will rekindle growth this year.  The  government  plans this quarter to offer tenders for
projects in infrastructure and tourism estimated at about 25
billion kuna ($4.9 billion), Kosor said. Projects include the
Plomin 3 thermal plant on the Adriatic coast, the Brijuni
Rivijera resorts on the Istrian peninsula as well as railroad
links and oil pipelines.  To contact the reporter on this story:
