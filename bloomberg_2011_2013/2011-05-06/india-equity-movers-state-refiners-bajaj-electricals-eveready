Corp. (IOCL IN) and Hindustan Petroleum Corp. (HPCL IN) rose

Holdings Inc., which said further “downside” may be limited
following the fall in the shares. The brokerage increased Bharat

rupees, analysts led by Anil Sharma wrote in a report. They

percent to 352.85 rupees, Bharat Petroleum, the second biggest,

third biggest, climbed 2.7 percent to 400.5 rupees.  Deccan Chronicle Holdings Ltd. (DECH)   jumped 8.3 percent
to 76.55 rupees, most in more than a month, as investors judged
the 19 percent drop in less than two weeks may have been
excessive.  “It may be a valuation play today,” Chitrangda Kapur, an
analyst with Angel Broking Ltd. in Mumbai, said by phone. “The

buyback” at as much as 180 rupees apiece, she said. Angel has a
“buy” rating and a stock price-target of 120 rupees.  Eveready Industries Ltd. (EVRIN IN) plunged as much as 11
percent to 43.3 rupees, and traded at 45 rupees, down 7.6
percent, the most in almost two years on concern profit margin
at  India ’s largest maker of batteries may be eroded as price of
zinc, a key raw material, increases.  Kolkata-based Eveready said yesterday profit in the quarter
ended March 31 plunged 96 percent and sales fell by 10.3 percent
after an increase in price of batteries depressed demand for the
product, according to a  statement  on the company’s website. The
average price of zinc, which accounts for about 17 percent of
raw material costs, rose by 9.4 percent in the quarter from a
year earlier, the company  said .  Glenmark Pharmaceuticals Ltd. (GNP)   gained 3.4 percent

to sell a 20.4 percent stake in the state-run company through a
follow on public offering, according to an advertisement in the
Economic Times newspaper today. The state-owned company today
invited bids from banks to manage the sale, the advertisement
showed.  Shriram Transport Finance Co. (SHTF IN) surged 7.3 percent
to 652.95 rupees, the most in almost five months, rebounding
from a 25 percent drop over six days that drove the price-
earnings ratio to the lowest since 2007.  “Any steep correction is a good buying opportunity in the
case of a company like Shriram Transport, which is one of the
best among the non-bank finance companies with good asset
quality,” Ambareesh Baliga, chief operating officer at
Way2Wealth Brokers Pvt., said by phone today.  SKS Microfinance Ltd. (SKSM)   lost 20 percent to a record
331.8 rupees, on speculation the company may report a loss in
three months ended March 31.  “The microfinance sector is still finding difficulties in
raising resources,” Jayne Shah, an analyst at Avendus Capital
Pvt. in Mumbai said in a telephone interview today. “The road
ahead is not smooth for the sector.”  The company, based in Hyderabad, may report a loss of 23
million rupees ($513,000) in the fiscal fourth quarter,
according to a median estimate of five analysts compiled by
Bloomberg. The figure was calculated by subtracting the annual
profit estimate of 1.79 billion rupees from nine month earnings.  To contact the reporters on this story:
