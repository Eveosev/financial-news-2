Poland has reached a partial agreement
with unions at state-owned Jastrzebska Spolka Weglowa SA that
may bring the European Union’s largest coking-coal producer
closer to its planned debut on the  Warsaw Stock Exchange (GPW)  on June
30, Rzeczpospolita newspaper reported on its Rp.pl website,
quoting Deputy Economy Minister Joanna Strzelec-Lobodzinska.  JSW unions agreed yesterday to end a work-to-rule strike in
exchange for 10-year job guarantees, rp.pl said, citing
Solidarity Union leader Slawomir Kozlowski. Still to be resolved
are union demands that the State Treasury retain a majority
stake in JSW and for a 10 percent pay increase, the newspaper
said, citing the unions.  Strzelec-Lobodzinska didn’t rule out that JSW may complete
its initial public offering by the end of June, provided that it
can file a prospectus with updated financial data to the
securities regulator by May 9.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
