Indonesia ’s rupiah completed a weekly
loss as signs the U.S. economic recovery is stalling drove Asian
stocks lower.  Government bonds  fell.  The MSCI Asia-Pacific Index of regional shares fell after
 service industries  in the U.S. expanded at the slowest pace in
eight months in April, while employment rose by the least in
five months. The currency dropped 0.4 percent yesterday as
official data showed Indonesia’s economic growth slowed in the
first quarter.  “The main issue is that the U.S. data is driving global
and regional stocks down,” said Lindawati Susanto, head of
treasury at PT Bank Resona Perdania in Jakarta. “The decline in
the rupiah is led by external issues.”  The rupiah dropped 0.2 percent this week to 8,585 per
dollar as of 3:45 p.m. in Jakarta, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The currency was little changed today.  Southeast Asia ’s biggest economy grew 6.5 percent in the
first quarter after having expanded 6.89 percent in the previous
three months, the Central Bureau of Statistics said.  The yield on the Indonesian government’s benchmark 8.25
percent bond due July 2021 rose three basis points this week to
7.71 percent, according to midday prices from the Inter-Dealer
Market Association. The rate was unchanged today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
