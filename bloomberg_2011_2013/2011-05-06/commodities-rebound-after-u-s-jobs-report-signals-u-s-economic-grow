Commodities rebounded, with metals and
crude oil  gaining after the U.S. jobs report signaled economic
growth.  The Standard & Poorâ€™s GSCI Index of 24 commodities was down
less than 0.1 percent at 683.22 by 2:10 p.m. in  London , after
earlier today falling as much as 3.6 percent. Copper rose 0.7
percent and Brent crude oil climbed 0.3 percent.  Payrolls increased by 244,000 workers last month, the
biggest gain since May 2010, after a revised 221,000 gain the
prior month, the Labor Department said today in  Washington .
Economists projected an April rise of 185,000, according to the
median estimate in a Bloomberg News survey.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
