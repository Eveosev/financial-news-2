International Consolidated Airlines
Group SA,  Europe ’s third-biggest airline, said it hedged 72
percent of its jet fuel needs for the second quarter.  The carrier, formed from the merger of British Airways and
Iberia, hedged 52 percent for the third quarter and 38 percent
for the fourth quarter, according to a  presentation  posted on
the company’s website.  Hedging allows airlines to agree on prices for future fuel
needs and is intended to help guard against cost fluctuations.
Jet fuel in northwest Europe averaged $999 a metric ton this
year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. It traded at as
much as $1,134 a ton earlier this month.  IAG forecasts a fuel bill of about 5.2 billion euros ($7.6
billion) this year based on jet fuel at $1,070 a ton and current
hedging cover, the presentation showed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
