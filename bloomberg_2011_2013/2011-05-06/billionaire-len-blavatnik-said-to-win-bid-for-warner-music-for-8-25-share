Warner Music  Group former director Len Blavatnik won a bid to buy the record company for $8.25 a share,
a person with knowledge of the situation said.  The sale of New York-based Warner, home to artists
including Bruno Mars and Cee Lo Green, to Blavatnik’s Access
Industries Holdings comes after a three-month auction whose
finalists included private-equity brothers Tom and Alex Gores
and Sony/ATV Music Publishing. The sale is expected to be
announced by Warner Music later today, the person said.  Warner, which has bond debt of $1.99 billion, according to
Bloomberg data, had hired Goldman Sachs Group Inc. to recruit
bidders for all or part of the company. Today’s sale could
position Warner Music to make a bid for London-based industry
peer EMI Group Ltd.  EMI, home to the Beatles, Coldplay and  Kylie Minogue , was
seized by creditor  Citigroup Inc. (C)  earlier this year after the
record label struggled to meet the terms of loans used to
finance its takeover by  Guy Hands , opening the way for a sale.  Spokespeople for Warner Music and Len Blavatnik could not
be reached for comment.  Warner shares closed yesterday 6.5 percent higher at $7.90
in New York trading, valuing the company at $1.22 billion.  To contact the reporter on this story:
