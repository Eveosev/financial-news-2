Spain  may trim its goal of meeting
22.7 percent of national energy needs from renewable sources by
2020, a target submitted to the European Union in December, a
government spokesman said.  The executive’s final goal will be “consistent” with a
 report  by a parliamentary committee that foresees clean power
reaching 20.8 percent of energy use, according to an Industry
Ministry spokesman who asked not to be named in line with
government policy. The country will maintain its commitment to
power from the sun and wind and retain its policy of using
subsidies to encourage investment, he added.  Industry Minister Miguel Sebastian is devising plans for
Spain to stick to its pledges on low-carbon energy as voters
struggle to pay their energy bills amid the worst economic slump
in at least 60 years.  Subsidies for renewable energy and cogeneration plants,
which turn excess industrial heat into energy, rose 8 percent to
7.1 billion euros last year, to comprise 39 percent of the
country’s electricity bill. The regulator had forecast a decline
of 10 percent.  The government will announce the main elements of the
energy plans next week and the final version is set to be
approved in July. Government policy will be flexible enough to
adapt to the changing conditions in the energy markets and the
national economy, the spokesman said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
