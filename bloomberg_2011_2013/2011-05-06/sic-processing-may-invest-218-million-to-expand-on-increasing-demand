SiC Processing AG, which recycles
waste, may spend about 150 million euros ($218 million) to
expand operations because of demand from solar-panel
manufacturers reusing materials to cut costs.  The company, which counts Renewable Energy Corp. ASA and
Yingli Green Energy Holding Co. as customers, may add about 15
production lines, including 10 in  China , in 2011 and 2012, said
Thomas Heckmann, chief executive officer of the Hirschau,
Germany-based company, said in an interview in  Singapore 
yesterday. It invested 80 million euros last year, he said.  “Wastage is very low in our process,” Heckmann said.
“Our yield rates from (recycling) are as high as 95 percent,
helping manufacturers save money on inputs.”  SiC develops and markets a process for recovering and
reusing silicon carbide and glycol while making solar panels and
wafers. Solar panel makers are bracing for increased competition
because newer markets in the U.S. and China may not compensate
for slower demand in  Europe , where governments are reining in
subsidies.  Global production capacity is set to rise to at least 41.5
gigawatts of panels this year from about 32 gigawatts last year,
with demand of 28 gigawatts at most, London-based New Energy
Finance estimates.  Sales at SiC, controlled by Jersey-based Nordic Capital,
may grow about 31 percent to 210 million euros this year,
Heckmann said. The company has a total of 32 production lines at
its plants including those in  Norway , China and  Germany .  To contact the reporters on this story:
