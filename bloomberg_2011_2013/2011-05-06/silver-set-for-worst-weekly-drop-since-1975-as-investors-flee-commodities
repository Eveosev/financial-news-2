Silver futures fell, capping the
biggest weekly plunge since at least 1975, on mounting sales by
investors following increases in Comex margin requirements. Gold
rebounded, halting a three-day slide.  Silver tumbled 27 percent this week after CME Group Ltd.,
the Comex owner, boosted the cash amount needed for a
speculative position by 84 percent in two weeks. Yesterday,
holdings of the metal in exchange-traded products dropped the
most in three years. Gold had the largest weekly drop in a year.  “At the close of business on Monday, silver’s got another
bump in margins,” said  Frank McGhee , the head dealer at
Integrated Brokerage Services LLC in  Chicago . “Gold doesn’t
have the technical breakdown that silver’s had. All gold has to
do is hold its value when everything else crumbles around it.”  Silver futures for July delivery fell 95.3 cents, or 2.6
percent, to settle at $35.287 an ounce at 2:11 p.m. on the Comex
in  New York . On April 25, the price reached $49.845, a 31-year
high.  The minimum amount of cash that must be deposited when
borrowing from brokers to trade will rise to $21,600 a contract
after May 9, CME Group said on May 4. That’s an increase from
$11,745 two weeks ago.  “The higher cash-margin requirements simply cannot be met
by all participants, and when a trader can’t make margin, the
underlying security is often liquidated,” Lachlan Shaw, a
commodity analyst at  Commonwealth Bank of Australia (CBA) , said in a
report. “Further silver-price falls are possible.”  ETP Holdings Tumble  Silver assets held in ETPs tumbled 3.6 percent to 14,546.99
metric tons yesterday, the biggest decline since Jan. 2, 2008,
while gold holdings fell 0.7 percent to 2,057.08 tons, the
biggest drop in three months, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  The liquidation in precious metals has been “egregiously
violent,” said  Dennis Gartman , an economist and the editor of
the Suffolk, Virginia-based Gartman Letter. “Speculative fervor
needed to have a bit of cold water splashed in its face.”  Gold futures for June delivery rose $10.20, or 0.7 percent,
to $1,491.60 an ounce. Yesterday, the price touched $1,462.50,
the lowest since April 14. This week, the metal dropped 4.2
percent, the most since May 2010.  “Gold below $1,500 is a line in the sand,” said  Adam Klopfenstein , a senior market strategist at Lind-Waldock in
Chicago. “There’s a scramble for gold because a lot of people
don’t want to miss the move up.”  The metal reached a record $1,577.40 on May 2.  Barclays Capital  recommended buying gold after the 4.9
percent drop in the previous three days.  Palladium futures for June delivery rose $5.50, or 0.8
percent, to $716.30 an ounce on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange . This week, the metal dropped 9.6 percent, the most
since July.  Platinum futures for July delivery gained $8.20, or 0.5
percent, to $1,786.40 an ounce. This week, the price dropped 4.2
percent, the most since November.  To contact the reporters on this story:
