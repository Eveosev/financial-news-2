The  Internal Revenue Service  is
delaying by one year the start of a rule requiring federal,
state and many local governments to withhold taxes from payments
to contractors.  The IRS said today that the rule, which requires
governments to withhold 3 percent of all contract funds, would
apply to payments made after Dec. 31, 2012. The agency initially
planned to implement the rule on Jan. 1, 2012.  To contact the reporter on this story:
