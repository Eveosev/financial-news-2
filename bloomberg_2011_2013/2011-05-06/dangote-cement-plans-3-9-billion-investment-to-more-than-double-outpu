Dangote Cement Plc (DANGCEM) , Nigeria’s biggest
company by market value, plans to invest $3.9 billion over the
next 28 months to more than double production of the building
material, Chairman Aliko Dangote said.   The Lagos-based company plans to boost cement output to 50
million metric tons by 2013 from an estimated 20 million tons
this year, Dangote said in an interview in Cape Town today,
where he is attending the  World Economic Forum  on Africa.   Growth in Nigeria, Africa’s most populous nation, will fuel
most of the demand for cement in coming years, Dangote said.
While the company plans to expand its operations, its main focus
is in sub-Saharan Africa for now, he added.    To contact the editor responsible for this story:
