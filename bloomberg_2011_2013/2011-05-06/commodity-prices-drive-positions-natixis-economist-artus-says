Commodity prices drive investors’
positions in  futures markets , rather than the reverse, Patrick Artus, chief economist at Natixis, said at a conference on
commodity-market regulation in Paris today. Following are
comments he made in a presentation:  “Empirical studies in general show a weak influence of the
 derivatives market  on commodity prices. We had about $60 billion
invested in ETFs at the end of March, which is totally
insufficient to move the commodity market.  “Almost always it’s the price that causes the position on
the derivatives market, and not the reverse. If the price moves,
the position on the commodity market moves, and not the other
way around.  “It doesn’t seem to be an immense problem, this weight of
speculation in the price of commodities.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
