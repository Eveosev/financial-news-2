Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (BRK/A) , led by
billionaire  Warren Buffett , said first-quarter results included
a $337 million charge tied to the decline in shares of  Wells
Fargo & Co. (WFC) , the largest U.S. home lender.  “Accounting regulations required us to record the
unrealized losses in earnings,” Omaha, Nebraska-based Berkshire
said today in a regulatory filing.  Berkshire announced detailed results for the first quarter
in the filing after issuing a preliminary report last week. Net
income dropped to $1.51 billion from $3.63 billion a year
earlier as the insurance segment posted an underwriting loss of
$821 million.  The Wells Fargo charge is part of a $506 million impairment
related to equity securities in the quarter. Berkshire’s Wesco
Financial unit said in a separate filing that it took a charge
tied to  Kraft Foods Inc. (KFT)   Burlington Northern Santa Fe, the railroad acquired by
Buffett’s firm last year for $26.5 billion, said in another
filing today that it will pay a $1 billion dividend to its
parent company this month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
