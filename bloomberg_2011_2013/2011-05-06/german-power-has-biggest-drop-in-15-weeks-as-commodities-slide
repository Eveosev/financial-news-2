German electricity for next year,
 Europe ’s benchmark contract, had its biggest drop in 15 weeks as
energy prices fell, signaling lower costs for power stations in
Europe’s biggest market.  Baseload power for 2012 this week declined 85 euro cents,
or 1.4 percent, to 58.35 euros ($84.74) as of 5:10 p.m. Berlin
time, according to broker data compiled by Bloomberg. That’s the
biggest weekly slide since Jan. 21. The contract was little
changed today. Baseload is delivered around the clock.  Coal prices today recouped earlier losses after yesterday
plunging along with oil. The region’s benchmark electricity
contract is declining after it last month climbed to its highest
price since June 2009 as  Germany  shut reactors for a safety
review following the nuclear disaster in  Japan . The contract
closed as high as 60.55 euros on April 4.  Hard coal for next-year delivery to Amsterdam, Rotterdam or
Antwerp yesterday fell the most since June. The contract was
little changed today at $128.50 a metric ton, a weekly drop of
3.2 percent. The fuel accounted for about a fifth of Germany’s
power last year. Germany also produces electricity from lignite,
or brown coal, natural gas, wind and solar plants.  Bloomberg tracks power prices from brokers including  GFI
