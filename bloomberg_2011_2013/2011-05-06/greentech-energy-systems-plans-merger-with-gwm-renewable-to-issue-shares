GWM Renewable Energy S.p.A. and
 Greentech Energy Systems (GES)  A/S plan to merge as GES plans to issue
new shares to GWM.  Subsequent to the completion of the transaction, GWM will
hold as much as 60.4 percent of the GES share capital and will
therefore be required to make a mandatory tender offer on all
Greentech shares at a price per share expected to be equal to
18.85 kroner, the companies said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
