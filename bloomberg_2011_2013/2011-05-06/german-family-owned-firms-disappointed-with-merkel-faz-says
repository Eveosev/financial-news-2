Germany’s family-owned businesses are
disappointed that  Chancellor Angela Merkel ’s government has
refused to take a stance on key policy issues and is relying too
much on opinion polls, Patrick Adenauer, head of the lobby of
family-owned businesses, told  Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung .  Merkel’s refusal to defend a rule that forbids the bailout
of over-indebted euro region countries is a major grievance for
family business owners, Adenauer said.  Bailouts for Greece, Ireland and Portugal are a “second
round of bank rescues” that benefit those who profited from
high yields on the peripheral countries’ bonds, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
