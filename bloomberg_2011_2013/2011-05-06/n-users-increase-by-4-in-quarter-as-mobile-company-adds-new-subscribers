MTN Group Ltd. (MTN) , Africa’s largest
mobile-phone company, said subscriber numbers rose 4 percent in
the first three months of the year as the company added
customers in Nigeria and  Iran .  MTN had 147.2 million subscribers at the end of March, the
Johannesburg-based company said in a statement today. That
compares with 141.6 million in the year ended December 31.  Mobile data and mobile money applications bolstered the
company’s performance, with mobile money subscribers up 5
percent to 4.6 million, the company said.  MTN’s subscribers rose 4 percent to 40.2 million in Nigeria
and 4 percent to 9 million in Ghana. MTN Irancell grew by 5.5
percent to 31.3 million users, the company said.  The company is facing “aggressive” competition and
increased regulation in the south and east  Africa  region, it
said. “The growth was slower than expected as a result of
higher prepaid disconnections due mainly to seasonality,” MTN
said.  Average revenue per user in  South Africa  decreased by 9
percent to 299 rand ($44.19) while in the prepaid segment
average revenue declined 10 percent to 101 rand, the company
said. In Nigeria average revenue per user dropped 6 percent to
$10.  To contact the reporter on this story: Sikonathi Mantshantsha in
