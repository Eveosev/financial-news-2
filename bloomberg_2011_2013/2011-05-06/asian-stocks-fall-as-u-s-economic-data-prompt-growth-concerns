Asian stocks fell this week, with the
regional benchmark index falling by the most in six weeks, as
U.S. economic data and plunging commodity prices added to signs
the recovery in the global economy is weakening.  Toyota Motor Corp., the world’s largest carmaker, fell 0.6
percent in Tokyo. In Sydney,  James Hardie Industries SE (JHX) , the
largest seller of home siding in the U.S., declined 4.9 percent
while Billabong International Ltd., the world’s biggest surfwear
maker, dropped 1.8 percent. Jiangxi Copper Co.,  China ’s biggest
producer of the metal, dropped 8.5 percent in  Hong Kong . Inpex
Corp.,  Japan ’s No.1 oil and gas explorer, tumbled 8.6 percent.  “Fears of the  U.S. economy  grew,” said Peter Elston, a
strategist at Aberdeen Asset Management Plc, which oversees
about $282 billion. “I haven’t been convinced by these
recoveries in the developed world as I just see them being
driven by stimulus and the major structural trend is one of
deleveraging.”  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index lost 1.4 percent to 137.57 this
week. The gauge gained 0.5 percent the previous week after the
 Federal Reserve  renewed its pledge to stimulate growth in the
world’s biggest economy with low  interest rates , boosting the
outlook for the region’s exporters.  Australia ’s S&P/ASX 200 Index declined 1.7 percent this
week, while  Singapore ’s Straits Times Index lost 2.5 percent.
Hong Kong’s  Hang Seng Index (HSI) , which completed its longest streak
of daily losses since 2003 this week, dropped 2.4 percent.
China’s Shanghai Composite Index slipped 1.6 percent. Japan’s
Nikkei 225 Stock Average climbed 0.1 percent.  Holiday-Shortened Week  Markets in China, Hong Kong, Malaysia, Singapore, Sri Lanka,
Taiwan, Thailand and Vietnam were closed on May 2 for a holiday.
Vietnam was also closed the following day. Japan’s stock market
was closed from May 3 through May 5. South Korea and Thailand’s
stock market also closed on May 5.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index lost 1.7 percent this week
in  New York .  In Tokyo, Toyota slipped 0.6 percent to 3,210 yen in Tokyo,
while Honda Motor Co., which receives 84 percent of its revenue
overseas, dropped 3.6 percent to 3,075 yen. In Sydney,  James
Hardie , which counts the U.S. as its biggest market, lost 4.9
percent to A$5.61. Billabong, which receives nearly half of its
revenue from the Americas, slumped 1.8 percent to A$6.63.  U.S. Growth Slows  Service industries in the U.S. expanded in April at the
slowest pace in eight months as companies cut back in response
to higher energy costs, according to the Institute for Supply
Management’s index of U.S. non-manufacturing companies published
on May 4.  Applications for jobless benefits unexpectedly jumped by
43,000 to 474,000 in the week ended April 30, the most since
August, Labor Department figures showed on May 5.  Also, U.S. consumer confidence dropped last week to the
lowest level in more than a month as rising fuel costs squeezed
American household budgets. The Bloomberg Consumer Comfort Index
decreased to minus 46.2 in the week ended May 1, the lowest
level since the end of March, from minus 45.1 the prior period.  “The U.S. economic data looks to have lost significant
momentum in the most recent month, and this is weighing on
markets,” said  Stephen Halmarick , Sydney-based head of
investment markets research at Colonial First State Global Asset
Management, which oversees about $150 billion.  Commodity stocks fell the most this week after crude oil
and metal prices declined on concern that economic growth will
slow as central banks seek to cool inflation by raising
borrowing costs. A gauge of energy stocks and material shares
declined the most among the 10 industry groups on the MSCI Asia
Pacific Index this week.  Commodities Producers  BHP Billiton Ltd., the world’s largest miner, dropped 2.7
percent to A$44.58 in Sydney, the biggest drag on Australia’s
S&P/ASX 200 Index this week, while Inpex tumbled 8.6 percent to
563,000 yen in Tokyo, the biggest drop on the  Nikkei 225 (NKY)  this
week. Cnooc Ltd., China’s biggest offshore oil producer, slipped
6.2 percent to HK$17.98 in Hong Kong.  Jiangxi Copper fell 98.5 percent in Hong Kong. Newcrest
Mining Ltd., Australia’s biggest gold producer, slid 5 percent
to A$39.38.  Crude oil for June delivery plunged 8.6 percent to $99.80 a
barrel on May 5, the lowest settlement in New York since March
16 and the biggest percentage drop since April 20, 2009.  The London Metal Exchange Index of six metals including
copper and aluminum sank 5.9 percent this week, its second
straight week of declines. Gold may decline as some investors
sell after the metal’s rally to a record and as other
commodities drop, according to a survey of 18 traders, investors
and analysts compiled by Bloomberg.  “Commodities are overbought and over-owned,” said Diane Lin, a  fund manager  at Pengana Capital, which oversees $1
billion in Sydney. “We’re seeing a correction on that. We don’t
think it’s something that will give structural growth.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
