Naveen Raghuvanshi, a Mumbai-based
currency trader at Development Credit Bank Ltd., comments on the
outlook for  India ’s rupee.  Three-month non-deliverable forwards for the currency
declined 0.1 percent to 45.56 per dollar as of 9:20 a.m. in
Mumbai, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The contracts
reflect bets the rupee will fall 1.6 percent from the spot rate
of 44.846 per dollar.  “For the next three months the rupee looks bearish. It is
definitely going to breach 45 and may trade at 45.30 against the
dollar. Whatever strength the rupee had is gone as the stock
markets haven’t been strong.”  This week’s “interest-rate hike is also one of the factors
for weak sentiment,” he said. “In addition, there appear to be
no major global cues that will weaken the dollar.”  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
