Slovak Telekom AS, a unit of  Deutsche
Telekom AG (DTE) , said first-quarter profit fell an annual 30 percent
as declining prices led to a drop in revenue.  Net income fell to 27.1 million euros ($39.4 million) from
38.6 million euros in the first quarter of 2010, the Bratislava,
Slovakia-based company said today in an e-mailed statement.
Revenue dropped 7.1 percent to 213.7 million euros.  Deutsche Telekom has 51 percent of Slovakiaâ€™s largest
telecommunication company with the state holding the rest. The
Slovak government plans to sell its stake within two years.  To contact the reporter on this story:
