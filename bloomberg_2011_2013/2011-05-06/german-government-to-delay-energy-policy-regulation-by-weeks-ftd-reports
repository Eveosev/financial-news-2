German Chancellor  Angela Merkel ’s
government will move parliamentary votes on the country’s  energy
policy  to the beginning of July from mid-June because lawmakers
need more time to think about the matter, Financial Times
Deutschland reported.  Laws on a timetable for closing down all nuclear  power
plants , the expansion of electricity grid power lines and the
promotion of renewable energies need more time, Gerda Hasselfeldt, who chairs the group of Christian Social Union
lawmakers in parliament, told the newspaper.  The decision creates a gap between the end of a three-month
moratorium on a planned nuclear-power plant operating extension
imposed by Merkel that expires on June 17 and new rules for the
country’s power companies, the newspaper said.  Hasselfeldt said the government will talk to utilities and
the opposition  Social Democrats  and the Greens to establish a
consensus on energy policy.  To contact the reporter on this story:
