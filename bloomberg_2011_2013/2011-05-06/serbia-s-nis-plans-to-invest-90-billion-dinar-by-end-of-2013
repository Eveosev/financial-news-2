Naftna Industrija Srbije AD, the
Serbian refinery controlled by OAO Gazprom Neft, may invest as
much as 90 billion dinars ($1.31 billion) in exploration and
upgrades by 2013 and possibly offer shares through a foreign
bourse.  The first quarter was “positive” and this year’s profit
should be “at least” the same level as 2010, when net income
stood at 16.5 billion dinars, Chief Executive Officer Kirill
Kravchenko told reporters in Belgrade today.  With the former Yugoslav republic emerging from recession,
companies are looking to expand and raise more cash from
investors. NIS may branch out into electricity generation and
chemical production as it seeks to gain market share in the
Balkans, according to a development plan through 2020.  “The plan is based on careful research of the Serbian and
regional markets,” where the company is looking for possible
acquisitions, he said, declining to name specific targets in
Romania, Bulgaria and  Hungary .  NIS’s sees its cumulative gas and oil production more than tripling
to 5 million tons of oil equivalent and trade volume nearly
doubling to 4.5 million tons by the end of the decade.  ‘Real Value’  NIS shares rose 0.97 percent today to 519 dinars in
Belgrade trading.  “As for the shares, the price does not reflect the real
value, because the Belgrade bourse is small and without many
foreign investors,” Kravchenko said. Depending on what shareholders
decide, some NIS shares may be offered on a bigger bourse, he
said.  Kravchenko forecast that earnings before interest, tax and
depreciation will almost double to 60 billion dinars in 2013 and
reach 130 billion dinars by 2020.  “Consequently, we expect the share price at around 2,000
dinars in 2013 and at about 5,000 dinars in 2020,” he said.  Of the investment plan, 50 percent is for upgrading NIS’s
two refineries, 30 percent for exploration and boosting
production and 20 percent for reorganizing the company’s retail
network of 480 fuel stations.  Using gas for electricity production instead of just
selling it should lift profit, the CEO said.  Current annual output of 500,000 million cubic meters of
natural gas can support 300 megawatts of installed capacity in
gas-fired plants, which would be built mainly in  Serbia ’s
northern Vojvodina province, close to the company’s oil and gas
fields.  To contact the reporter on this story:
