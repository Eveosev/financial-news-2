Itochu Corp. (8001) , Japan’s fourth-largest
trading company, plans to invest 800 billion yen ($10 billion)
over two years to expand in  China  and the resources industry.  The company will establish a China business promotion
committee to help it acquire more assets in Asia’s largest
economy, where it plans to invest as much as a quarter of the
total amount, Itochu said today in a  statement . It also plans to
invest in resources businesses from uranium to natural gas.  “The investment seeks to positively increase the scope of
our profits,” Chief Financial Officer Tadayuki Seki told
reporters in Tokyo today. The company has joined Mitsui & Co.,
Japan’s No. 2 trading company, and  Marubeni Corp. (8002) , the fifth-
largest, in forecasting record full-year profit.  The investments would double Itochu’s oil and natural gas
assets, and include participation in new coal projects
especially in Australia and Brazil. The plans are based on the
company’s outlook for crude  oil prices , the most bullish of the
four Japanese trading companies to so far report 2010 results.  The Tokyo-based trader forecasts crude to average $109 a
barrel in the year ending March 31, compared with  Sojitz Corp. (2768) ’s
estimate of $105, Mitsui’s $94, and Marubeni Corp.’s $85.  “A price of over $100 is probably taking into account
geopolitical risk,” Joji Okada, chief financial officer
of Mitsui, told reporters in Tokyo today. ‘In the medium-term,
we’re talking about $90 as about the right level.”  N.Y. Crude  Crude oil for June delivery fell $9.44, or 8.6 percent, to
$99.80 a barrel yesterday, the lowest settlement on the  New York
Mercantile Exchange  since March 16.  Under the investment plan, Itochu also seeks to add uranium,
basic metals, and biomass fuel businesses, as well as purchasing
infrastructure and auto retail finance assets. Machinery-related
businesses, including lithium battery manufacture to capture the
growing electric car market, and renewable energy and healthcare,
are allotted as much as 200 billion yen.  Itochu is forecast profit of 240 billion yen in the fiscal
year ending March 31, 2012, a 49 percent increase. That would
outpace the 25 percent increase Marubeni expects to hit its
target 170 billion yen and Mitsui’s forecast 17 percent increase
to 430 billion yen in the current fiscal year.  To contact the Bloomberg staff on this story:
