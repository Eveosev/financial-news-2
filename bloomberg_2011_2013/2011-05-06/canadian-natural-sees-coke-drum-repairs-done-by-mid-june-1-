Canadian Natural Resources Ltd. (CNQ)  said
it expects to complete repairs by mid-June on two fire-damaged
coke drums at the Horizon upgrader in  Alberta .  Production probably will resume several weeks later and is
targeted at 55,000 barrels a day at the 110,000-capacity
upgrader, according to the statement released yesterday. Repairs
for another set of coke drums are scheduled to be completed by
the middle of the third quarter.  The derrick above coke drums 1A and 1B, where the Jan. 6
fire occurred, has been dismantled and fabrication of a new
derrick has started, the company said. The derrick above coke
drums 2A and 2B has been repaired.  Syncrude, a light, low-sulfur synthetic oil derived from
the  tar sands  in Alberta, has strengthened from a $3.05 discount
on Jan. 6 to a $13.60 premium yesterday compared with West Texas
Intermediate.  Portions of a turnaround originally scheduled for 2012 have
been moved up and other portions are expected to be deferred to
2013, according to the statement. The rescheduling of the work
is expected to result in higher production levels.  To contact the reporter on this story:
