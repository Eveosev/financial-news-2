Japan ’s currency will strengthen to 75
yen per dollar by the end of the third quarter as the U.S.
Federal Reserve maintains its loose monetary-policy stance,
Deutsche Bank AG said, reiterating an earlier call.  The policy-setting U.S. Federal Open Market Committee has
kept its target for overnight bank lending in a range of zero to
0.25 percent since December 2008 to foster growth. Two-year
Treasury note yields are within two basis points of a seven week
low and the dollar has depreciated against all but one of its 16
major counterparts this year.  “As long as U.S. rates remain as low as they are, the
demand-supply balance remains in favor of the yen,” George Saravelos, a currency strategist at Deutsche Bank AG in  London ,
said by phone. “Dollar-yen is moving lower because of broad-
based dollar weakness, and the yen is well poised to benefit”
if risk-aversion intensifies, he said.  The yen weakened to 80.33 per dollar as of noon in London
from 80.07 in  New York  yesterday, when it reached 79.57, the
strongest level since March 18. The currency depreciated 0.3
percent to 116.78 per euro, after earlier posting the sharpest
intraday drop since April 27.  The G-7, which comprises the U.S., Japan,  Germany , the
U.K., France,  Canada  and Italy, intervened to weaken the yen on
March 18. The currency rose to a post-World War II high of 76.25
per dollar on March 17 after a magnitude 9.0 earthquake and
deadly tsunami on March 11 fueled speculation Japanese investors
would bring home overseas assets to pay for reconstruction.  To contact the reporter on this story:
