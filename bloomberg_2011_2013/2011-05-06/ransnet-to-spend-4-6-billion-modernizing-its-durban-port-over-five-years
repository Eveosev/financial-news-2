Transnet Ltd., which manages  South
Africa ’s ports and rail systems, will spend 31.1 billion rand
modernizing the Durban port over the next five years, Chief
Executive Officer Brian Molefe said.  The state-owned company will also spend 16.4 billion rand
on the Richards Bay terminal over the same period, Molefe told
reporters in  Cape Town  today. The upgrades are part of
Transnet’s 110.6 billion-rand capital expenditure program, he
said.  The company’s pipeline between Durban and Johannesburg will
be commissioned in December and will double the volume of
liquids moving through Transnet pipelines, Molefe said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
