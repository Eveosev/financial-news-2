The  United Nations  prosecutor probing
the killing of former Lebanese Prime Minister  Rafiq Hariri  filed
an amended indictment after new evidence came to light.  Daniel Bellemare sent the document today to the pretrial
judge, Daniel Fransen, “to include substantive new elements
unavailable until recently,” according to an e-mailed statement
from the Special  Tribunal for Lebanon , set up in 2007 to
investigate the killing of Hariri in a roadside bomb two years
earlier. It didn’t provide details.  The prosecutor doesn’t intend to make further amendments
unless ordered to do so by the pretrial judge, the special
tribunal said. “Other indictments could, however, be filed in
the future if warranted by the evidence,” it said.  Controversy over the UN inquiry led to the collapse in
January of the government led by Hariri’s son, Saad, after the
Hezbollah movement and its allies walked out. Hezbollah says the
U.S. and  Israel  instigated the tribunal to target the Shiite
Muslim group along with its backer,  Syria . The indictment was
filed in January and amended in March for the first time.  Hariri’s death galvanized millions of Lebanese to protest
and led to the ouster of Syrian troops from Lebanon after 29
years. Syria and Hezbollah, classified as a terrorist group by
the U.S. and Israel, have denied any role in the killing.  To contact the reporter on this story:
