Mexico ’s central bank is buying gold
to obtain the “best risk-return balance” for its investments
and won’t necessarily continue purchasing bullion this year,
said Agustin Carstens, governor of the institution.  “We want to get the best risk-return balance in our
investments,” Carstens said in an interview with Bloomberg
Television in Helsinki today. “Given the performance gold has
had in the recent past, it turns out it would allow us to have a
higher return without much risk.”  The bank bought 100 tons of gold in recent months,
accounting for 4 percent of international reserves, according to
a statement e-mailed on May 4. The institution is “so far
happy” with the purchases, Carstens said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
