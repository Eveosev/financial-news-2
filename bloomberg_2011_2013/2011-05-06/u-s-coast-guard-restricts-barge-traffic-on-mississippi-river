The U.S. Coast Guard said it will
restrict barge traffic for a five-mile stretch of the
 Mississippi River  near Caruthersville,  Missouri .  The safety zone was established to prevent flood waters
from topping the cityâ€™s flood wall, the Coast Guard said today
in an e-mailed statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
