Zinc in  London  slumped to its lowest
level since November and nickel dropped to a four-month low, on

interest rates.  Three-month zinc on the London Metal Exchange fell as much

November, and last traded at $2,094.50 by 3:11 p.m. Singapore

lowest since January, before trading at $24,487 a ton.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
