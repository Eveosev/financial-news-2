Commodities extended gains, with crude
oil and metals rising after the U.S. jobs report signaled
economic growth.  The Standard & Poor’s GSCI Index of 24 commodities climbed
1.2 percent to 692.33 by 4:26 p.m. in  London , after earlier
falling as much as 3.6 percent. In  New York , copper rose 1
percent and crude oil gained 1.5 percent.  “Today’s economic data from the U.S. took some of the
pressure off the market and prices recovered across the board
after a strong correction in the first part of the day,”  Eugen
Weinberg , head of commodity research at Commerzbank AG in
 Frankfurt , said by telephone. “We see current levels as a good
entry point for long-term investors.”  Payrolls increased by 244,000 workers last month, the
biggest gain since May 2010, after a revised 221,000 gain the
prior month, the Labor Department said today in  Washington .
Economists projected an April rise of 185,000, according to the
median estimate in a Bloomberg News survey.  Investors held a record $412 billion of raw-material assets
by the end of March, almost 50 percent more than a year earlier,
according to  Barclays Capital . Investment linked to commodity
indices reached a record-high $352 billion last month, Bank of
America Merrill Lynch said. Funds held a net 1.49 million
futures and options in 18 commodities by April 26, 57 percent
more than a year earlier, within 4.8 percent of a record,
according to U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission data
compiled by Bloomberg.  Crude oil rose 1.5 percent to $101.34 a barrel after
falling as much as 5.2 percent in New York trading, while Brent
crude oil rose 2 percent to $113.01 a barrel in London. Gasoline
rose 1.9 percent to $3.1547 a gallon on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange , and natural gas rose 0.9 percent to $4.30 per million
British thermal units.  Central Bank  European Central Bank President  Jean-Claude Trichet  said
policy makers remain “extremely alert” on inflation, and
indicated they may take further decisions on interest rates when
they have new economic projections in June.  The ECB is monitoring the situation “very closely” after
keeping its benchmark interest rate at 1.25 percent yesterday,
Trichet told Bloomberg Television in an interview in Helsinki
today. The ECB raised rates on April 7, joining  China ,  India ,
Poland and  Sweden  in seeking to control inflation.  Copper for delivery in three months rose 0.7 percent to
$8,880 a metric ton on the London Metal Exchange. Nickel, zinc,
tin and lead also gained. Gold for immediate delivery rose 1.3
percent to $1,494.02 an ounce.  Silver Futures  “The panic that has ensued this week has been proven to be
just that: panic,” said Alexander Ridgers, head of commodities
at CMD Markets in London, which trades more than $400 million of
crude oil a day. “We have seen strong payrolls.”  Silver futures traded on the Comex gained 0.1 percent to
$36.29 an ounce. Earlier it fell as much as 8.8 percent after
the exchange’s owner, CME Group Ltd., raised margin requirements
by 84 percent in less than two weeks.  The rebound in raw materials comes as Glencore
International AG sells shares in an initial public offering
which may value the Baar, Switzerland-based commodity trader at
about $61 billion.  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)  in reports on April
11 and April 15 told investors to be “underweight” commodities
in the next three to six months. The bank still expects
commodities to advance about 10 percent over the next 12 months.  In agricultural markets, cocoa for July delivery gained 1.3
percent to $3,094 a ton on ICE Futures U.S. in New York. Wheat
gained 0.6 percent to $7.58 a bushel on the Chicago Board of
Trade, while corn fell 0.6 percent to $7.04 a bushel and
soybeans rose 0.8 percent to $13.33 a bushel.  -- Editors: Sharon Lindores, John Deane  To contact the reporter on this story;
