The ruble tumbled the most in almost
two months against the dollar after oil fell below $100 a barrel
on concern fuel demand will slow after reports showed economic
weakness in the U.S. and  Europe .  The Russian currency depreciated 1.3 percent, its biggest
daily drop since March 15, to 27.7650 per dollar by 12:11 p.m.
in Moscow, adding to a 0.9 percent slide yesterday. Against the
euro the ruble weakened 0.2 percent to 40.36.  Crude for June delivery lost $9.44 yesterday after trading
ended in Moscow, closing at $99.80 a barrel, the biggest
percentage drop since April 20, 2009. The contract lost 4.3
percent to $95.55 a barrel in  New York  today.  Moves against the dollar and the euro left the ruble 0.6
percent weaker at 33.4158 against the central bank’s target
currency basket, the lowest since April 28. Bank Rossii uses the
basket to manage swings that hurt Russian exporters. It is
calculated by multiplying the dollar’s rate to the ruble by
0.55, the euro to ruble rate by 0.45, then adding them together.  -- Editors: Alexander Nicholson, Ana Monteiro  To contact the reporter on this story:
