European soccer’s leaders have backed
Sepp Blatter in his quest for re-election as president of  FIFA ,
the sport’s international governing body.  The  UEFA  executive committee gave Blatter its “unanimous
support” in FIFA’s June 1 election, the group said today in an
e-mail signed by all 16 of its members. The group recommended
that  UEFA ’s 53 member associations endorse the 75-year-old
Blatter as well.  Blatter, who is opposed by Mohamed Bin Hammam of Qatar, is
the eighth president in the Zurich, Switzerland-based FIFA’s
107-year history. Now in his third term, Blatter has been
criticized in the past year for alleged corruption during the
association’s December vote that awarded Qatar the 2022  World
Cup .  Blatter said this week that he intends to “weed out”
corrupt officials within international soccer’s leadership. The
Switzerland native has also said that if re-elected, he will
retire in 2015 at the end of his fourth term.  Bin Hammam , 61, is the head of the Asian Football
Confederation. The last challenge to Blatter’s presidency came
in 2002 when Issa Hayatou of Cameroon stood against him.  To contact the reporter on this story:
