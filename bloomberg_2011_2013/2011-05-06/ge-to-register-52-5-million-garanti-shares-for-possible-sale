General Electric Co. (GE)  may raise more
than $270 million after applying to sell 1.25 percent of  Turkiye
Garanti Bankasi AS (GARAN) , Turkeyâ€™s biggest bank by market value, on
the  Istanbul Stock Exchange .  GE registered 52.5 million shares for sale, according to a
statement by the exchange today. Garanti dropped 2 percent to
7.92 liras at 5:30 p.m., valuing the stake at about $271
million.  GE retains a 2.25 percent stake in Garanti after selling
18.6 percent of the company in November to Banco Bilbao Vizcaya
Argentaria for $3.78 billion, or about $5.08 (7.8 liras) a
share.  The sale of the remaining shares GE owns might yield profit
of as much as $100 million on the open market, GE Capital Chief
Operating Officer Bill Cary said on Nov. 2.  To contact the reporter on this story:
