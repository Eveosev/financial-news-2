European finance officials are in
Luxembourg today for an unscheduled meeting, said two European
officials familiar with the situation.  The officials couldn’t immediately say what the subject of
the discussions would be. Earlier, Spiegel reported that
ministers are convening an emergency meeting after  Greece 
threatened to withdraw from the euro region.  One of the officials said it was unlikely that the topic
would be as serious as Greek withdrawal from the currency bloc.
While German Chancellor  Angela Merkel ’s chief spokesman denied
that any discussions on a Greek exit are underway, he declined
to comment when asked whether officials are meeting tonight.  To contact the reporter on this story:
