Colombian President  Juan Manuel Santos 
said the La Nina weather pattern that has caused above-average
rainfall and flooding may end next month.                    The
government plans to begin infrastructure repairs once the
weather pattern ends, Santos said, according to an e-mailed
government statement today.  On May 1,  Colombia ’s agriculture ministry said a lack of
sunshine will hurt the nation’s coffee crop over the next few
months. Roadways also have been damaged, hampering transport of
foodstuffs, the government said then.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
