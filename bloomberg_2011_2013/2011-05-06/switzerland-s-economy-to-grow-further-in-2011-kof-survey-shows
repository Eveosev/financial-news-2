Switzerland ’s economy may continue to
expand over the coming months and most Swiss companies are
optimistic about their business opportunities, a survey shows.  “The majority of Swiss companies still assess their
business situation as excellent,” the KOF Swiss Economic
Institute said today in an e-mailed statement, citing its
business survey of Swiss companies. “The Swiss economy is
expected to have expanded further in the first quarter of 2011,
and continued strong growth is anticipated in the second and
third quarter.”  Switzerland’s economy is growing, bolstered by foreign
demand and corporate spending. Exports rose in the first three
months and unemployment declined to the lowest in more than two
years in April.  ABB Ltd. (ABBN) , the world’s largest maker of power-
transmission gear, last week said first-quarter profit climbed
41 percent as demand for automation equipment improved.  Most of the companies polled plan to hire more staff, KOF
said. “All of the sectors surveyed expect rising or at least
stagnant demand in the coming three months.”  The survey was conducted between April 1 and April 30 among
6,800 Swiss companies, KOF said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
