Morocco  arrested three suspects in the
April 28 bombing of a Marrakesh cafe frequented by tourists, and
linked one to al-Qaeda.  The individuals are Moroccans and “the main perpetrator”
behind the attack that left at least 16 people dead “swore
allegiance to al-Qaeda,” the Interior Ministry said in a
statement carried by the state-run  Maghreb Arabe Presse .  “The ongoing investigations will confirm for sure whether
he’s an ideological follower of jihadi thought or has an
organizational link to al-Qaeda,” government spokesman Khalid
Naciri said in a phone interview.  The attack, which left 21 people injured, struck at the
heart of Morocco’s tourism industry, which accounts for almost
10 percent of gross domestic product. It was the deadliest in
Morocco since 2003, when  suicide bombers  simultaneously struck
five sites in Casablanca, killing more than 40 people and
wounding at least 100.  The main suspect was previously expelled from Libya and
 Portugal , for reasons that were not immediately clear, Naciri
said.  The leading suspect had also made several attempts to
travel to Iraq and Chechnya, the ministry statement said. He
learned how to make explosives on the internet and developed two
remotely controlled explosive devices before entering the cafe
disguised as a tourist, it said. He had for weeks monitored the
site of the attack “persistently and in cold blood,” Naciri
said.  Those killed in the attack included 13 tourists, eight of
whom were French, Naciri said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
