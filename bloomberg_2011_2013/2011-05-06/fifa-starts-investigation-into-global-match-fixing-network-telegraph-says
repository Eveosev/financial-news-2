FIFA is investigating whether a
network of match fixers has been targeting soccer exhibitions
between national teams on three continents and hundreds of
European club matches, the  Daily Telegraph  reported.  Match officials are suspected of having been paid as little
as $10,000 a game to help engineer specific scores or events,
enabling fixers to make hundreds of millions of dollars on Asian
gambling markets, the Telegraph said.  “The threat from match fixing to the integrity of the
global game is significant,” Chris Eaton, the head of security
at soccer’s governing body, was cited as saying.  FIFA said March 10 it started disciplinary proceedings
against six game officials as part of a match-fixing probe. That
investigation concerns two exhibition games held in Antalya,
 Turkey , on Feb. 9. Estonia and  Bulgaria  tied 2-2 and Latvia beat
Bolivia 2-1, all seven goals coming on penalty kicks.  To contact the reporter on this story:
