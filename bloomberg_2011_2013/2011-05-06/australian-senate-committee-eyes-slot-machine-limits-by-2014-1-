An Australian Senate committee said a
system where slot machine users set their own limits for betting
should be introduced by 2014, supporting laws proposed by
independent lawmaker  Andrew Wilkie .  People should use personal cards to set a limit and would
be “locked out” of machines if they ignore electronic warnings
and try to exceed that amount, the Joint Select Committee on
Gambling Reform  said . Wilkie plans to put laws to Parliament
this year establishing the system.  The moves, which seek to address problem gambling, could
hurt earnings for companies that own gambling venues, such as
 Tatts Group Ltd. (TTS) , Tabcorp Holdings Ltd., Crown Ltd. and slot-
machine maker  Aristocrat Leisure Ltd. (ALL)  Prime Minister  Julia
Gillard ’s government will support Wilkie’s laws and he needs
backing from three other lawmakers for them to be approved.  “Addiction has resulted in children going hungry, family
breakdowns, homes and businesses lost, relationships damaged
and, most tragically, suicide,” the committee said in its
report. “Our duty of care starts well before an individual hits
rock bottom financially and emotionally.”  Wilkie today said 95,000 Australians were problem slot
machine gamblers, losing A$5 billion ($5.3 billion) each year.  “Like seatbelts reduced the road toll, mandatory pre-
commitment will save lives and diminish the human tragedy caused
by poker machines,” Wilkie said in an e-mailed statement.  Comment wasn’t immediately available from Tatts, Crown or
Tabcorp.  To contact the reporter on this story:
