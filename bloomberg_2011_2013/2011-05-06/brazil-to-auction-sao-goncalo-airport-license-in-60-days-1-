Brazil  will auction the license to
build and operate the Sao Goncalo do Amarante airport in about
60 days, the first of several airports planned to boost the
country’s infrastructure to host the soccer World Cup and the
 Olympic Games .  The minimum bid value for the facility, to be located in
the Northeast state of Rio Grande do Norte, will be 51.7 million
reais ($32 million), Rubens Vieira, a director at country’s
aviation authority, told reporters in Brasilia today. Total
construction and maintenance costs will reach about 650 million
reais, he said.  President  Dilma Rousseff  decided to auction licenses to
build and remodel airports in a bid to improve the country’s
facilities to hosts the 2014  World Cup  and the 2016 Olympic
games. The events will demand 140 billion reais in investments
in stadiums, roads and other infrastructure projects, Sport
Minister Orlando Silva said in April 22.  The winning bidder will have up to three years to construct
the airport, and the right to operate it for at least 25 years,
Vieira said.  To contact the reporter on this story: Mario Bessa Lima in
