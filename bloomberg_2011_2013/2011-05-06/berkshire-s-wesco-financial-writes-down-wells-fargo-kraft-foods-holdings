Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (BRK/A) ’s Wesco
Financial Corp. subsidiary swung to a first-quarter loss on a
$34.3 million impairment tied to declines in the value in stocks
of  Kraft Foods Inc. (KFT)  and  Wells Fargo & Co. (WFC)   The “fair values had been below cost for an extended
period of time” on some of the holdings, Pasadena, California-
based Wesco said today in a regulatory filing.  The net loss of $53.5 million compares with profit of $12.3
million in last year’s first quarter, the company said. Omaha,
Nebraska-based Berkshire, led by billionaire Warren Buffett, has
agreed to buy the 20 percent of Wesco it doesn’t already own.  To contact the reporter on this story:
