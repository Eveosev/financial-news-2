German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble supports  Mario Draghi  as the next president of the
European Central Bank, French Finance Minister  Christine Lagarde 
said.  “My colleague Schaeuble is favorable to this nomination
and thinks he has the qualities to make a good president,”
Lagarde said in an interview today with  Radio Classique .  The French, Italian and Spanish governments have backed
Draghi to succeed Jean-Claude Trichet, whose term ends this
year. Lagarde said she hopes German Chancellor Angela Merkel
will soon express her views.  “The decision is due in June, but I hope she’ll make her
views public earlier,” Lagarde said in the interview.  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
