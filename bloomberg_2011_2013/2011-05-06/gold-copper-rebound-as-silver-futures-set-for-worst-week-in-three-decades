Copper recovered from its lowest level
since December and gold gained. Oil dropped, falling for a fifth
day, and silver futures headed for their worst week since 1975.  Crude for June delivery declined 0.7 percent to $99.09 a
barrel at 2:49 p.m. after sliding 8.6 percent yesterday. Copper
for three-month delivery added 0.2 percent to $8,835 a metric
ton and gold for immediate delivery increased 0.9 percent to
$1,486.99 an ounce. Silver futures sank 28 percent this week in
 New York  after the Comex announced an 84 percent jump in margins.  The Standard & Poor’s GSCI index of 24 raw materials was
little changed after a 6.5 percent plunge yesterday that was the
most since January 2009. Silver, oil, gasoline, coffee and
cotton had gained more than 23 percent this year through April
29, spurring central banks from  China  to  India  to increase
 interest rates  to cool inflation.  “It could be a relief rally after an aggressive sell-
off,” said Serene Lim, a commodity strategist at  Australia  &
New Zealand Banking Group Ltd. in Singapore. “Traders will be
very cautious at this time because tonight’s payroll data will
be something to watch out for.”  Crude slumped 12 percent this week, the most since the
period ended May 7, 2010, after plunging yesterday because of a
surprise increase in U.S. jobless claims and a gain in the
dollar. Applications for jobless benefits jumped 43,000 to
474,000 in the week ended April 30, Labor Department figures
showed. Economists in a Bloomberg News survey estimated they
would decline to 410,000.  Silver Plunge  A Labor Department report today may show employers hired
185,000 additional workers in April from 216,000 in March. The
report is “the most important data” all week, said  Jonathan Barratt , managing director of Commodity Broking Services Pty in
Sydney, who predicted oil will average $100 this year. “The
market has started to realign itself with proper fundamentals.”  Silver for July delivery on the Comex in New York fell 3.3
percent to $35.05 an ounce, plunging for a fifth consecutive day.  The minimum amount of cash that must be deposited when
borrowing from brokers to trade silver futures will climb to
$21,600 per contract after May 9, CME Group said on May 4. That
was up from $11,745 two weeks ago. Last week, the futures price
jumped to a 31-year high of $49.845 an ounce.  “The higher cash-margin requirements simply cannot be met
by all participants, and when a trader can’t make margin, the
underlying security is often liquidated,” Lachlan Shaw, a
commodity analyst at  Commonwealth Bank of Australia , wrote in a
note. “Further silver price falls are possible.”  Copper, Corn  The dollar rose 1.5 percent this week against six major
currencies, set for its biggest weekly gain in four months.
Asian stocks fell 1.3 percent, the biggest weekly drop since
March, as rising jobless claims and lower  consumer confidence  in
the U.S. signaled the economic recovery may be faltering.  Three-month copper on the London Metal Exchange rose as
much as 0.7 percent to $8,883 a metric ton, trimming a decline
of 5.4 percent in the week to yesterday on concern global growth
may slow as central banks boost interest rates. The metal fell
to $8,744.25 yesterday, the lowest price since Dec. 8.  “Despite recent concerns, we still believe that the
physical copper market will tighten substantially over the next
twelve months,” Andrew Gardner, an analyst at MF Global, wrote
in a note today. The International Copper Study Group has
forecast a 377,000-ton shortage of refined metal this year.  July-delivery soybeans rallied as much as 0.7 percent to
$13.31 a bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade and were at
$13.235 at 3:44 p.m. Tokyo time. The contract touched $13.10
yesterday, the lowest price since March 17. Corn for July
delivery dropped as much as 1 percent to $7.02 per bushel, and
traded at $7.0225.  To contact the reporter on this story:
