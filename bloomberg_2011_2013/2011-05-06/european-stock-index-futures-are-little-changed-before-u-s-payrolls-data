European stocks gained the most in
more than two weeks, paring the Stoxx  Europe  600 Index’s weekly
retreat, after the  U.S. economy  added more jobs than forecast
last month.  Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc (RBS)  rallied the most in three
months after Chief Executive Officer  Stephen Hester  forecast a
return to profit this year.  ThyssenKrupp AG (TKA)  soared 8 percent as
Germany’s biggest steelmaker said it plans to sell or spin off
units to reduce debt.  Belgacom SA (BELG)  plunged 5.1 percent after
cutting its earnings forecast.  The Stoxx 600 gained 1.3 percent to 281.33 at the 4:30 p.m.
close in  London , erasing an earlier drop. The gauge declined 0.9
percent this week as commodities tumbled. The measure has still
climbed 7.3 percent since March 16 as companies from PSA Peugeot
Citroen to Ericsson AB reported earnings that topped estimates
and the  Federal Reserve  maintained its pledge to keep  interest
rates  low for an extended period.  “For the announcement to have come in better than expected
has given the market a positive snap,” said  Richard Hunter ,
head of U.K. equities at Hargreaves Lansdown Stockbrokers in
London. “This is a comforting piece of data which tends to
suggest that the U.S. recovery is on track, albeit at a slower
rate than most would wish.”  Payrolls Data  Payrolls increased by 244,000 workers last month, the
biggest gain since May 2010, after a revised 221,000 gain the
prior month, the Labor Department said today in  Washington .
Economists projected an April rise of 185,000, according to the
median estimate in a Bloomberg News survey. Employment excluding
government jobs jumped the most in five years. The jobless rate
rose to 9 percent, the first increase since November.  National benchmark indexes rallied in 15 of the 18 western
European markets today.  Germany ’s DAX climbed 1.6 percent and
France’s CAC 40 gained 1.3 percent, while the U.K.’s FTSE 100
advanced 1 percent.  Of the 217 companies in the Stoxx 600 that have reported
earnings since April 11, 129 have beaten analyst forecasts for
per-share profit, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. That
compares with 73 percent of U.S. companies in the period.  RBS climbed 5.6 percent to 42.74 pence, rebounding from
yesterday’s 2.9 percent slide. The U.K.’s biggest government-
owned lender said earnings from its British retail and corporate
banking division more than doubled to about 1 billion pounds
($1.6 billion) in the first quarter. The insurance unit, which
owns Churchill and Direct Line, posted its first profit in five
quarters.  ‘Strong Momentum’  “We are pleased to see the strong momentum” in the global
banking and markets division and in insurance, said Atif Latif,
an analyst at Guardian Stockbrokers in London.  ThyssenKrupp jumped 8 percent to 32.22 euros, the biggest
gain in the Stoxx 600, on plans to sell or spin off units
representing about a quarter of its sales as it seeks to cut
debt and focus on engineering.  Deutsche Lufthansa AG (LHA)  gained 4.1 percent to 15.27 euros
after UBS AG upgraded Europe’s second-biggest airline to “buy”
from “hold.” Airline stocks also advanced as the price of
crude oil fell more than 10 percent this week.  International Consolidated Airlines Group SA jumped 3.3
percent to 254.1 pence after the company, formed from the merger
of British Airways and Iberia, posted a profit in its first
quarter of operations, beating predictions, as traffic rose and
the deal cut costs.  BP, Pandora  BP Plc (BP/)  rallied 3.1 percent to 454.7 pence after Europe’s
second-largest oil company won the right to carry out a $7.8
billion share swap with state-owned Russian oil producer OAO
Rosneft in return for allowing its TNK-BP venture to take up an
Arctic oil exploration deal.  Pandora A/S, the Danish jewelry chain, rallied 7.6 percent
to 256 kroner as HSBC Holdings Plc rated the shares
“overweight” in new coverage. The 31 percent decline from
January this year presents a buying opportunity, HSBC analyst
Sophie Dargnies wrote in a note today.  Belgacom lost 5.1 percent to 25.02 euros, the biggest drop
since October 2009. The largest telephone company in Belgium
lowered its revenue and earnings forecasts after first-quarter
sales fell more than analysts estimated because of lower mobile
voice revenue and fixed-line losses.  DnB NOR ASA (DNBNOR)  plunged 5.3 percent to 80 kroner as Norway’s
biggest bank reported first-quarter net income of 2.85 billion
kroner ($520 million), missing the 3.45 billion-krone average of
15 analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
