Philippine three-year bonds dropped,
pushing yields to a three-week high, after the central bank
raised  interest rates  for a second time this year. The peso
dropped as regional stocks fell.  The Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas increased its benchmark
rate by 25 basis points to 4.50 percent yesterday after data
showed inflation accelerated in April. Reining in price
pressures is the top priority for the  Philippines , central bank
Assistant Governor Cyd Amador said in Hanoi today.  “With interest rates rising, bond yields -- especially
those on the shorter end -- will go up to align with the policy
rates,” said Antonio Espedido, a treasurer at China Banking
Corp. in Manila.  The yield on the 6.25 percent bond due January 2014 climbed
15 basis points, or 0.15 percentage point, to 4.90 percent as of
4:08 p.m. in  Manila , according to Tradition Financial Services.
That’s the highest level since April 12. The rate rose 47 basis
points this week.  Consumer prices rose 4.5 percent from a year earlier last
month, after a 4.3 percent increase in March, the  National
Statistics Office  said yesterday. That’s the biggest gain in a
year.  The peso weakened 0.3 percent today to 43.08 per dollar,
capping a 0.6  percent weekly loss, according to Tullett Prebon
Plc. The currency touched 43.205, its weakest level since April
28, as the MSCI Asia Pacific Index of regional shares dropped
for a fourth day.  To contact the reporter for this story:
