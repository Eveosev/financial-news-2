Corn, wheat and soybeans fell in
 Chicago  as investors sold commodities on speculation higher
prices and weaker economic growth will curb demand for raw
materials, including those used to make food.  Corn surged 88 percent in the past year, wheat gained 49
percent and soybeans rose 38 percent as demand increased and
stockpiles dwindled, pushing up food costs that were partly
blamed for riots in the Middle East and North Africa. Investors
are ignoring wet weather that’s slowing planting in the U.S.,
which supplies 29 percent of the world’s corn.  Commodities traders are in a “panic” to sell contracts,
said  Michael Shaoul , chairman of Marketfield Asset Management in
 New York , which oversees $1 billion. Corn and soybeans headed
for the biggest weekly declines since March as the Standard &
Poor’s GSCI Index of 24 raw materials fell for a fifth day, the
longest streak since August.  “It’s a fund selloff,” said Andrew Dewing, owner of
Dewing Grain in Aylsham,  England . “Lots of the consumers are
not buying because, historically, prices have never been this
high going forward. They’re not going to book forward at these
prices.”  Corn for July delivery dropped 10.25 cents, or 1.4 percent,
to $6.985 a bushel by 1:15 p.m. London time on the Chicago Board
of Trade after touching $6.91, the lowest price since March 31.
The grain has lost 7.7 percent this week, the most since the
week ended March 11.  Soybeans, Wheat  Soybeans for July delivery fell 3 cents, or 0.2 percent, to
$13.1875 a bushel. The oilseed touched $13.065 a bushel, the
lowest level since March 17, and is down 5.4 percent this week.  Wheat for July delivery rose 1 cent to $7.55 a bushel after
falling as much as 1.9 percent to $7.40, the lowest price since
March 31. The grain has tumbled 5.8 percent this week, the most
in three weeks. Milling wheat for May delivery traded on NYSE
Liffe in Paris dropped 3 euros, or 1.2 percent, to 241.25 euros
($350.92) a metric ton.  Prices that reached two-year highs in 2011 may crimp demand
as the cost of living in the U.S. rose at its fastest pace since
December 2009 in the 12 months ended in March. Chinese consumer
prices rose last month by the most since 2008. The People’s Bank
of  China  raised borrowing costs four times since October, and
the  European Central Bank  increased rates on April 7 for the
first time since 2008.  Export Sales  Corn sales from the U.S. fell 55 percent in the week ended
April 28 from the prior seven days and soybean sales dropped to
21,206 tons from 199,212 tons, the Department of Agriculture
said yesterday in a report. The U.S. is the largest exporter of
both commodities.  An index of food prices rose to a record 237.2 points in
February before falling in March, United Nations data show. The
UN’s Food and Agriculture Organization said yesterday the gauge
of 55 commodities rose to 232.1 points in April. World Bank
President Robert Zoellick said April 16 the world is “one shock
away” from a food crisis.  Global corn stockpiles probably will fall 16 percent to the
lowest in four years by Aug. 31 as consumption rises 37 percent,
USDA data show.  Production estimated on April 8 at 814.9 million tons may
be revised lower when the U.S. government releases its next
supply-and-demand report, Dewing said. Because of the wet
weather, 13 percent of the U.S. corn crop was seeded as of May
1, down from a five-year average of 40 percent, USDA data show.  “There’s no way the U.S. is going to write that the crop
is up,” Dewing said. “The weather is not going away. They’re
not getting the corn in the ground.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
