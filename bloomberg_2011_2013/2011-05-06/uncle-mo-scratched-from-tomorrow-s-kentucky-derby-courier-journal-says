Uncle Mo was scratched from tomorrow’s
 Kentucky Derby , depriving the season’s first Triple Crown race
of one of its biggest names.  The move was reported by the  Louisville-Courier Journal  on
its website and confirmed in an e-mail by Kelly Wietsma, a
spokeswoman for Uncle Mo’s owner, Mike Repole.  Uncle Mo, last season’s 2-year-old champion, had been
listed as the second betting choice for the 1 1/4-mile Derby at
Louisville’s Churchill Downs.  He had been working out after battling a stomach ailment
that first was diagnosed following his third-place finish at the
Wood Memorial in New York last month, his first loss in five
starts.  Repole has a second horse, Stay Thirsty, entered in
tomorrow’s race.  Churchill Downs handicapper Mike Battaglia had Uncle Mo as
the 9-2 second choice behind Dialed In, the favorite at 4-1.
Stay Thirsty is 20-1.  To contact the reporter on this story:
