Kazakh Prime Minister Karim Massimov
dismissed the chairman of the nation’s customs agency three days
after the authorities sanctioned the arrest of 16 people
suspected of smuggling goods from  China .  Serik Baimaganbetov will replace Kozy-Korpesh Karbyzov as
head of the Finance Ministry’s Committee for Customs Control,
Masimov said today on  his Twitter account . The authenticity of
the account was confirmed by the prime minister’s press service.  The nation’s economic crimes agency authorized the arrest
of 16 people, according to a May 3 statement on its  website . It
detained the head of  Khorgos , the main customs terminal on the
Kazakh-Chinese border, and a deputy head of the Akmola regional
office of the National Security Service, or KNB, successor
agency of the Soviet-era KGB in Kazakhstan.  A group of more than 100 people collected cargo in China
and smuggled it across the border, receiving a payment of as
much as $30,000 for every one of the 100 to 200 vehicles it
helped steer to  Kazakhstan  each week, the agency said.  Members of the group earned more than $130 million from
smuggling goods since it was formed in 2006, according to the
statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
