Stocks in  Switzerland  gained for the
first time in four days, trimming their weekly decline, as the
U.S. economy added more jobs than forecast last month.  Sonova Holding AG (SOON) , the Swiss hearing-aid maker, gained the
most in almost 18 months after saying annual revenue increased.
 Novartis AG (NOVN)  rose 1.3 percent after winning approval to expand
marketing of its Afinitor drug.  The  Swiss Market Index (SMI)  of the biggest and most actively
traded companies advanced 1.2 percent to 6,526.51 at the 5:30
p.m. close in Zurich. The gauge still fell 0.2 percent this
week. The broader Swiss Performance Index also climbed 1.2
percent today.  “We’ve certainly seen a temporary lift in the market from
the U.S. payrolls data, adding to earlier gains in defensive
names such as Roche and Novartis,” said Jean-Charles Gand, an
analyst at Market Securities in Geneva. “We still believe
stocks are beginning a consolidation period and equities have
more room to fall.”  Labor Department figures showed the  U.S. economy  added more
jobs than forecast in April, easing concern that higher fuel
prices are slowing the economic recovery. Payrolls increased by
244,000 workers last month, the biggest gain since May 2010.
Private hiring surged by 268,000 in April, the most since
February 2006.  Sonova Sales  Sonova, the company being investigated by the Zurich
Prosecutor’s Office and  SIX Exchange Regulation , surged 5.6
percent to 90.40 Swiss francs, the highest price since March,
after saying full-year revenue increased by 7.8 percent.  Novartis climbed 1.3 percent to 52.75 francs. The company
won U.S. approval to expand marketing of its kidney-cancer
treatment Afinitor for patients with the rare type of pancreatic
tumor diagnosed in Apple Inc.’s  Steve Jobs  in 2004.  Roche Holding AG (ROG) , the world’s biggest maker of cancer
drugs, gained 2.1 percent to 145.5 francs. The shares have
increased 16 percent since March 16.  Kuoni Reisen Holding AG (KUNN)  added 2.3 percent to 364.25 francs
for its second straight gain. The holiday bookings firm
completed the acquisition of Gullivers Travels Associates as
planned, according to a company statement.  Petroplus Holding AG, the Zug, Switzerland-based oil
refiner, gained 8.3 percent to 15 francs, as Jefferies Group
Inc. raised its rating on the shares to “buy” from “hold.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
