Kenya ’s shilling strengthened, paring
its first weekly decline in four, after the nation’s central
bank accepted more bids at a treasury-bill auction than it
offered, reducing availability of the currency in the market.  The currency of East Africa’s biggest economy appreciated
as much as 0.2 percent to 83.68 per dollar and traded 0.1
percent stronger at 83.8 by 12:29 p.m. in the capital, Nairobi,
paring its loss this week to 0.5 percent.  The Central Bank of Kenya sold 3.16 billion shillings
($37.8 million) of 91-day Treasury bills at a weighted
average rate of 4.018 percent, it said in an e-mailed statement
after the market closed yesterday. That’s the highest average
yield in a year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The
bank offered 2 billion shillings of securities and received bids
totaling 4.6 billion shillings, it said.  “The shilling has gained ground against the dollar due to
the tight liquidity in the market following yesterday’s decision
by the central bank to take more bids for the short-term debt
instruments,” Steve Lagat, a dealer at Nairobi-based CfC
Stanbic Bank Ltd., said in a phone interview today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
