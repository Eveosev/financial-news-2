Greece  is considering withdrawing from
the euro and returning to its old currency, prompting emergency
talks by European Union officials,  Der Spiegel  reported, without
saying how it got the information.  The European Commission has called a meeting in Luxembourg
today to discuss Greece’s threat and a possible debt
restructuring, the German magazine reported on its website. A
German government spokesman dismissed the report, saying
“categorically” there are no talks about a Greek withdrawal
from the euro.  Greece leaving the euro “isn’t on the table and hasn’t
been on the table for the German government and isn’t a topic at
the European level,” Steffen Seibert, Chancellor Angela
Merkel’s chief spokesman, said by telephone.  The Greek Finance Ministry denied any plan to leave the
euro in an e-mailed statement. A spokesman for  Jean-Claude Juncker , the Luxembourg prime minister who also leads the euro-
region’s finance ministers, denied the report. French Finance
Minister  Christine Lagarde  has no immediate comment on the
report, a spokesman said.  German Finance Minister  Wolfgang Schaeuble  is taking part
in the talks and wants to keep Greece from carrying out its
threat,  Der Spiegel  said. The German Finance Ministry is warning
that reintroducing Greece’s old currency would lead to a
devaluation that would boost the country’s outstanding debt by
as much as 50 percent, Der Spiegel said, citing an internal
study prepared at the ministry.  To contact the reporter on this story:
