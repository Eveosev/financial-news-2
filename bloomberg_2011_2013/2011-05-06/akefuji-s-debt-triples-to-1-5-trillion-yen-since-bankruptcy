Takefuji Corp. (8564) , the bankrupt Japanese
consumer lender, tripled its debt to 1.5 trillion yen
($18.6 billion), on rising overcharged-interest repayment
claims, its court-appointed lawyer said.  The lender has about 900,000 claims seeking repayment
valued at about 1.38 trillion yen, said Eiichi Obata, the lawyer
overseeing the lender’s debt-repayment plan. Takefuji’s debt
also includes 93 billion yen of corporate bonds, he said.  Takefuji had 434 billion yen of debt when it filed for
 bankruptcy protection  in September. The company, which agreed
last month to be acquired by South Korea’s A&P Financial Co., is
the biggest casualty of Japan’s four-year crackdown on coercive
lending.  The Korean company was selected as a preferred bidder for
the assets on April 11, among rival bids from J Trust Co., a
Japanese financial services company, TPG Capital and two others.
Takefuji plans to compile and submit its debt-repayment plan by
July 15 to the  Tokyo  district court, Obata said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
