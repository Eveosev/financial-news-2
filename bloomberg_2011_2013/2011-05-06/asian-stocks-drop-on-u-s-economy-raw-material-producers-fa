Asian stocks declined, with the
regional benchmark index erasing gains for the year, as rising
jobless claims and declining consumer confidence in the U.S.
stoked concern the recovery in world’s biggest economy is
weakening.  Toyota Motor Corp. (7203) , the world’s largest carmaker, and  Canon
Inc. (7751) , a camera maker that gets more than 80 percent of its
revenue overseas, declined at least 2.3 percent. Mitsui & Co., a
Japanese commodities trader, sank 3 percent after reporting
earnings that missed estimates.  BHP Billiton Ltd. (BHP) , Australia’s
No.1 oil producer and the world’s biggest mining company, fell
1.9 percent as crude and copper futures extended losses
yesterday.  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index declined 0.9 percent to 137.54
as of 7:39 p.m. in  Tokyo , set for its biggest drop since April
19. About three stocks fell for every two that rose. The measure
is heading for a 1.5 percent decline this week after central
banks from  India  to the Philippines raised  interest rates  and
U.S. reports showed companies added fewer jobs than estimated in
April and service industries expanded at the slowest pace in
eight months.  “Risk aversion is increasing as we’re still seeing a very
fragile global economic recovery,” said  Shane Oliver , head of
investment strategy at AMP Capital Investors Ltd., which manages
$98 billion in Sydney. “We’re going through a patch of softer
economic data in the U.S. Investors are unwinding their long
positions in commodities as monetary tightening occurs across
Asia.”  SARS, Iraq War  Japan ’s  Nikkei 225 (NKY)  Stock Average sank 1.5 percent when the
market resumed trading after a three-day holiday. South Korea’s
Kospi Index declined 1.5 percent. Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 Index
lost 0.2.  China ’s Shanghai Composite Index fell 0.3 percent.  Hong Kong ’s Hang Seng Index lost 0.4 percent, an eighth day
of decline. That’s the gauge’s longest losing streak since April
2003, when the city was in the grips of the severe acute
respiratory syndrome, or SARS, epidemic and the U.S. was
preparing to invade Iraq.  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index fell 0.3 percent
today. In  New York , the index dropped for a fourth day, falling
0.9 percent to 1,335.10 yesterday as shares of energy and raw-
material companies slumped following the biggest plunge in
commodities in almost two years and as more Americans
unexpectedly filed first-time claims for unemployment.  Applications for jobless benefits surprisingly jumped by
43,000 to 474,000 in the week ended April 30, the most since
August, Labor Department figures showed yesterday.  ‘Waning Optimism’  Also, U.S. consumer confidence dropped last week to the
lowest level in more than a month as rising fuel costs squeezed
American household budgets. The Bloomberg Consumer Comfort Index
decreased to minus 46.2 in the week ended May 1, the lowest
level since the end of March, from minus 45.1 the prior period.  “Investors’ optimism toward the  U.S. economy  is waning,”
said Juichi Wako, a senior strategist at Nomura Holdings Inc. in
Tokyo.  Gauges of consumer discretionary companies, including
automakers and electronics manufacturers, as well as energy and
raw material producers led the decline among the 10 industry
groups in the MSCI  Asia  Pacific Index. All but two of the sub-
indexes fell.  Toyota dropped 2.4 percent to 3,210 yen in Tokyo. Canon,
the world’s biggest camera maker, declined 2.3 percent to 3,805
yen. Samsung Electronics Co., the world’s largest maker of
televisions and flat-screen panels, lost 1.8 percent to 899,000
won in  Seoul .  Asian Earnings  Honda Motor Co., the Japanese carmaker that gets 44 percent
of sales from North America, slumped 4.7 percent to 3,075 yen.
The stock also declined after the National Business Daily
reported Honda’s parts unit in China halted production after the
March 11 Japan earthquake disrupted supplies.  Mitsui, Japan’s second biggest commodities trader by sales,
decreased 3 percent to 1,412 yen. The company said full-year net
income more than doubled to 367.9 billion yen ($4.6 billion).
That missed the average estimate of 378.1 billion yen by 18
analysts compiled by Bloomberg and the company’s own forecast of
370 billion yen.  United Overseas Bank Ltd. (UOB) , Singapore’s third-largest lender,
lost 1.6 percent to S$18.80 after reporting first-quarter profit
tumbled 13 percent as income from lending, trading and
investment fell.  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index increased 0.8 percent this year
through yesterday, compared with gains of 6.2 percent by the  S&P
500  and 0.7 percent by the Stoxx Europe 600 Index. Stocks in the
Asian benchmark are valued at 13.4 times estimated earnings on
average, compared with 13.5 times for the S&P 500 and 11.2 times
for the Stoxx 600.  Commodities Drop  About 39 percent of the 376 companies on the Asian
benchmark index that reported earnings since April 11 beat
analysts’ estimates. That compares with 61 percent for the MSCI
World Index of developed stock markets.  Commodities dropped the most in almost two years, paring
this year’s gains to 8.2 percent, on concern that economic
growth will slow as central banks seek to cool inflation by
raising borrowing costs.  BHP Billiton  decreased 1.9 percent to A$44.58 in Sydney.
Rio Tinto Group, the world’s second-biggest miner by sales,
slipped 1.9 percent to A$79.57. Jiangxi Copper Co., China’s No.
1 producer of the metal, sank 2.2 percent to HK$24.10 in Hong
Kong. Cnooc Ltd., a Chinese offshore oil producer, dropped 2.3
percent to HK$17.98. Inpex Corp., Japan’s largest energy
explorer, plunged 6.2 percent to 563,000 yen in Tokyo.  Transport Companies  Crude oil for June delivery plunged 8.6 percent to $99.80 a
barrel yesterday, the lowest settlement in New York since March
16. The London Metal Exchange Index of six metals including
copper and aluminum sank for a second day, falling 4 percent
yesterday, the biggest drop since November 16.  Shipping companies and airlines advanced on speculation
fuel costs will decline even as crude oil futures climbed today
from the lowest level in almost two months.  Hyundai Merchant Marine Co., a South Korean shipping line,
gained 1.9 percent to 34,150 won in Seoul. China Cosco Holdings
Co., Asia’s largest shipping line by market value, climbed 2.1
percent to HK$7.26 in Hong Kong.  Air China Ltd. (601111) , the world’s
biggest carrier by market value, advanced 5.8 percent to HK$8.39.
Smaller rival  Singapore Airlines Ltd. (SIA)  rose 2.6 percent to
S$14.38.  Tokyo Electric  Power Co., owner of the Fukushima Dai-Ichi
nuclear plant crippled by the March 11 earthquake and tsunami,
soared 6.8 percent to 455 yen in Tokyo, the biggest gain in the
in the Nikkei 225 after Asahi newspaper reported on May 3 the
government estimated that total damages to be paid to victims of
the disaster would amount to 4 trillion yen ($50 billion).  The total may include about 2 trillion yen by Tokyo
Electric, which is expected to raise electricity prices to help
pay for compensation, the report said. Japan’s Chief Cabinet
Secretary Yukio Edano today said the Cabinet hasn’t discussed
allowing the utility to increase electricity fees to help pay
compensation from the accident at the nuclear plant.  To contact the reporters on this story:
