Hungary’s government will check for
the spread of rodents in all local units of  Tesco Plc (TSCO)  after the
 Magyar Nemzet  newspaper reported that stores had failed to meet
hygiene standards, the  Rural Development Ministry  said today.  “According to press reports, several stores are not
keeping the regulations,” the ministry said in an e-mailed
statement. “For the sake of  food safety , it is vital to stop
the settlement and spread of rodents,” the ministry said.  Magyar Nemzet, in a front page story today, wrote that
certain Tesco stores had become “infested with mice.”  Tesco, the U.K.’s largest supermarket chain, said the
newspaper’s statements were “exaggerated, misleading and
without any foundation,” according to a statement on the
company’s Hungarian  website .  To contact the reporter on this story:
