Turkish banks including  Turkiye
Garanti Bankasi AS (GARAN) , the biggest by market value, had their
ratings cut to “hold” from “buy” at Citigroup Inc., which
cited the impact of policy measures by the central bank on
earnings.  Citigroup also reduced  Turkiye Is Bankasi (ISATR)  AS,  Turkiye Halk
Bankasi AS (HALKB)  and Islamic lender  Asya Katilim Bankasi AS (ASYAB)  to
“hold,” according to an e-mailed report today.  “We turn cautious on Turkish banks,” analyst Emre Izgi
said in the report. “Considering the risks from further
potential policy measures, we fail to see catalysts to further
drive a re-rating.”  While  Turkey ’s central bank has increased banks’ reserve
requirements four times since December in an attempt to slow
loan growth, the central bank is meeting banks’ liquidity needs
through open market operations, meaning the “regime isn’t
reducing liquidity,” Izgi said.  Garanti fell 2 percent to 7.92 liras at 5:30 p.m. on the
main  ISE National 100 index. (XU100)  Isbank dropped 1.8 percent to 5.34
liras and Asya Katilim declined 1.4 percent to 2.90 liras.  “Banks are now increasing loan rates, but they are too shy
and too late,” the report said.  Isbank’s price estimate was reduced to 5.70 liras from 6.25
liras and the estimate of Garanti was raised to 8.60 liras from
8.55 liras, the report said. Halkbank had its estimate cut to 15
liras from 16.2 liras, it said.  Yapi & Kredi Bankasi AS, the bank part-owned by UniCredit
SpA, is Citi’s “top pick” among Turkish banks, Izgi said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
