Canadian natural gas fell as mild U.S.
weather pared demand and additions to stored reserves of the
fuel exceeded analyst expectations.  Temperatures in Chicago may reach 70 degrees Fahrenheit (21
Celsius) May 9, 1 degree above normal, according to  State
College , Pennsylvania-based AccuWeather Inc. U.S. gas stockpiles
rose 72 billion cubic feet last week to 1.76 trillion, compared
with analysts’ expectations of 67 billion cubic feet, the
average of estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  “We expect North American gas to be oversupplied for the
next two to seven years,” Steve Laut, president of Canadian
Natural Resources Ltd., said yesterday. Canada’s second-largest
gas producer will increase spending on more profitable oil and
natural gas liquids this year, he said at the company’s annual
meeting in Calgary yesterday.  Alberta  gas for June delivery fell 3.75 cents to C$3.4925
per gigajoule ($3.42 per million British thermal units) as of
2:05 p.m.  New York  time, according to  NGX,  a Canadian Internet
market. Gas traded on the exchange goes to users in  Canada  and
the U.S. and is priced on TransCanada Corp.’s Alberta system.  Natural gas for June delivery on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange  fell 2.5 cents to $4.236 per million Btu as of 2:24
p.m.  Gas for prompt delivery fell as mild weather forecast in
the U.S. next week is likely to pare air-conditioner use.  Delivery Point Prices  Gas at the Alliance Pipeline delivery point near Chicago
dropped 30.49 cents, or 6.6 percent, to $4.2098 per million
British thermal units on the  Intercontinental Exchange . Alliance
is an express line that can carry 1.5 billion cubic feet a day
to the Midwest from western Canada.  At the Kingsgate point on the border of  Idaho  and British
Columbia, gas fell 25.13 cents, or 5.9 percent, to $4.008,
according to ICE. At Malin,  Oregon , where Canadian gas is traded
for California markets, gas was down 29.34 cents, or 6.7
percent, to $4.1193.  Volume on  TransCanada’s  Alberta system, which collects the
output of most of the nation’s gas wells, was 15.1 billion cubic
feet as of 2 p.m. in New York, 334 million below its target
level. Gas production has declined in western Canada because the
ground is too soft to move heavy equipment to well sites.  Gas was flowing at a daily rate of 2.58 billion cubic feet
at Empress, Alberta, where the fuel is transferred to
TransCanada’s main line.  At McNeil, Saskatchewan, where gas is transferred to the
Northern Border Pipeline for shipment to the  Chicago  area, the
daily flow rate was 1.88 billion cubic feet.  Available capacity on TransCanada’s British Columbia system
at Kingsgate was 1.28 billion cubic feet. The system was
forecast to carry 1.62 billion cubic feet today, about 56
percent of its capacity of 2.9 billion.  The volume on  Spectra Energy’s  British Columbia system,
which gathers the fuel in northeastern British Columbia for
delivery to Vancouver and the Pacific Northwest, totaled 2.96
billion cubic feet at 1:05 p.m.  To contact the reporter on this story:
