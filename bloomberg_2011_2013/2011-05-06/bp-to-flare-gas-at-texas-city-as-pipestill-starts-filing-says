BP Plc (BP/)  may begin restarting a second
crude unit today at the 475,000 barrel-a-day refinery in Texas
City, Texas, according to a regulatory  filing .  Emissions associated with the startup of pipestill No. 3B
may occur until May 10, according to the filing with the Texas
Commission on Environmental Quality. Pipestills, also known as
crude units, heat oil and divide its ingredients according to
the temperatures at which they boil.  A power failure April 25 forced the plant to shut down. The
refinery restarted another crude unit late April 28, and  one of
two fluid catalytic crackers was started by May 3.  The plant is operating roughly within the production range
it had prior to the  power failure , a person with knowledge of
the situation said yesterday. The person declined to be
identified because the information isn’t public.  The refinery operates two sets of processing units, known
as “trains,” which are fed by separate crude units. One of the
systems was returning to service following planned work prior to
the April 25 shutdown, according to the person.  To contact the reporters on this story:
