Financial companies led an increase in
the cost of insuring European debt on concern an employment
slowdown may add to evidence the recovery is faltering.  The Markit iTraxx Financial Index of credit-default swaps
on the senior debt of 25 banks and insurers rose 2.5 basis
points to 135, and the subordinated index was up 8 at 233.5,
according to JPMorgan Chase & Co. at 10:30 a.m. in  London . An
increase signals deterioration in perceptions of  credit quality   A Labor Department report will show payrolls rose by
185,000 workers last month compared with a 216,000 advance in
March, according to the median forecast of 86 economists
surveyed by Bloomberg News. Jobless benefit applications in the
U.S. unexpectedly increased this week and German factory orders
slowed.  “It’s going to have to take a really good number to shake
off the growth concerns we’ve seen this week,” said Harpreet Parhar, a strategist at Credit Agricole SA in London. “Economic
data has been disappointing recently and this has fueled
concerns over the economic recovery.”  The jobs numbers are due at 8:30 a.m. in  Washington .
Bloomberg survey estimates range from payroll increases of
118,000 to 325,000.  The Markit iTraxx Crossover Index of 40 companies with
mostly high-yield credit ratings rose 1 basis point to 359. The
Markit iTraxx Europe Index of 125 companies with investment-
grade ratings increased 0.5 basis point to 97.75, JPMorgan
prices show.  Sovereign risk also rose, with the Markit iTraxx SovX
Western Europe Index of swaps on 15 governments climbing 2 basis
points to 192, according to CMA. Swaps on  Spain  jumped 10 basis
points to 247, Portugal climbed 7.5 to 638.5, Ireland increased
7.5 to 660,  Italy  was up 6 at 155 and  Greece  rose 12.5 to 1,320.  A basis point on a credit-default swap protecting 10
million euros ($14.5 million) of debt from default for five
years is equivalent to 1,000 euros a year. Swaps pay the buyer
face value in exchange for the underlying securities or the cash
equivalent should a borrower fail to adhere to its debt
agreements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
