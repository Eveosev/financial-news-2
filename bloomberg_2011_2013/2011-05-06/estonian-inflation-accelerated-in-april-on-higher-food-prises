Estonian consumer price growth
accelerated in April against analysts’ forecasts of a slowdown,
as food prices rose most in five months.  Consumer prices rose 5.4 percent from a year earlier, and
compared with a 5.2 percent rise in the previous month, the
Tallinn-based statistics office said on its website today. The
median in a Bloomberg survey of three analysts was 5 percent. In
the month, prices rose 0.7 percent.  The Baltic country, which adopted the euro in January,
returned to price growth in March 2010 following 10 months of
deflation after the second-worst recession in the 27-member
European Union. Global food and fuel-price increases may raise
 Estonia ’s average annual inflation this year to 4.5 percent from
2.7 percent in 2010, the  Finance Ministry  forecast last month.  Estonia must prevent rising commodity prices from being
passed through to the economy and bar wage growth from exceeding
productivity increases to protect competitiveness, the central
bank said on Apr. 27.  Prices of food and non-alcoholic drinks rose a monthly 1.9
percent, the biggest rise since last November, for an annual
increase of 12.3 percent, the office said. Food contributed
about three quarters of the monthly price growth.  To contact the reporter on this story:
