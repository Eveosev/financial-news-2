The Australian dollar advanced after
the central bank said it will likely need to raise interest
rates “at some point” as mining investment drives down
unemployment and inflation accelerates.  The currency rose to $1.0668 as of 11:32 a.m. in Sydney
from $1.0649 before the  Reserve Bank  of  Australia  released its
quarterly monetary policy statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
