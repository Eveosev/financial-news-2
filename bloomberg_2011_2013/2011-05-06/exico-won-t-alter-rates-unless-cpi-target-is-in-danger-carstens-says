Mexico ’s central bank won’t adjust its
interest-rate policy unless its goal for 3 percent inflation
comes under threat, central bank Governor Agustin Carstens said.  “We will look into the output gap together with other
indicators,” Carstens said in a Bloomberg Television interview
in Helsinki today, “until we see that the convergence to our 3%
permanent goal is in danger, then we might adjust the policy.”  Mexico’s economy still has some “slack” before reaching
its capacity and that output gap may close in the second half of
the year, Carstens said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
