The cost of insuring against default
on European corporate bonds fell, reversing an earlier increase,
after the  U.S. economy  added more jobs than forecast in April.  The Markit iTraxx Crossover Index of credit-default swaps
on 40 companies with mostly high-yield credit ratings fell 4
basis points to 354, after trading as high as 362, according to
JPMorgan Chase & Co. prices at 2:30 p.m. in London. The index is
a benchmark for the cost of protecting bonds against default and
a decline signals improvement in perceptions of  credit quality .  The Markit iTraxx Europe Index of 125 companies with
investment-grade ratings fell 0.75 basis point to 97, JPMorgan
prices show. The Markit iTraxx Financial Index of 25 banks and
insurers was unchanged at 132.5 and the subordinated index was
1.5 higher at 227.  A basis point on a credit-default swap protecting 10
million euros ($14.5 million) of debt from default for five
years is equivalent to 1,000 euros a year. Swaps pay the buyer
face value in exchange for the underlying securities or the cash
equivalent should a borrower fail to adhere to its debt
agreements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
