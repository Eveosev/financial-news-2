Exopack Holding Corp., the flexible-
packaging company with operations in  North America  and  Europe ,
is seeking $475 million in loans to refinance debt and fund a
shareholder payout, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The company will host a call with lenders on May 11 at 10
a.m. in  New York  to discuss the financing, which includes a $400
million, six-year term loan B and a $75 million, five-year
credit line, Bloomberg data show.  Bank of America Corp. and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. are
arranging the covenant-lite deal for the Spartanburg, South
Carolina-based company, the data show. Covenant-lite means that
the loan is not governed by financial maintenance requirements.  Exopack also will sell $225 million of unsecured bonds due
2018, according to a statement distributed today by  Business
Wire . Proceeds of the loans and bonds will repay a revolving
credit line and redeem all of its 11.25 percent notes due 2014,
the company said.  In October 2007 Exopack got a $125 million revolving credit
line that is due July 2014, according to Bloomberg data. There
was $56.9 million remaining under the facility at Dec. 31, the
data show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
