Agroton Public Ltd. (AGT) , an agricultural
producer in Ukraine, said it will start a road show for its
debut Eurobonds on May 10 as it seeks to raise funds to finance
debt and expand its business.  Agroton, based in Luhansk, eastern Ukraine, appointed VTB
Capital Plc and Dragon Capital as the joint lead managers and
Jaspen Capital Partners as co-lead manager for the sale, the
company said today in an e-mailed statement.  The proceeds from the bonds will be used to redeem the $21
million of bank debt, fund construction of additional grain
storage facilities, expand the company’s land bank and purchase
more agricultural machinery, according to the statement.  Agroton’s net income climbed to $15.7 million in 2010, from
$5.1 million a year earlier, the company said April 14.  To contact the reporter on this story:
