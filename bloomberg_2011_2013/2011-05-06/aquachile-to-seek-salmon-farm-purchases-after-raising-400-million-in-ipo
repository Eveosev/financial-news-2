Empresas AquaChile SA  will look to buy
other salmon farms with proceeds from what could be  Chile ’s
biggest initial public offering in five years as emerging
markets drive demand, Chairman Victor Hugo Puchi said.  Chile’s salmon industry, which has toughened regulations
since a 2007 virus outbreak decimated production, probably will
consolidate to five or six larger producers from today’s 27,
Puchi said. Excluding potential acquisitions, AquaChile plans to
invest $470 million to increase annual salmon output to 170,000
metric tons by 2016 from 55,000 tons last year.  The company, based in Puerto Montt, Chile, seeks to raise
$350 million to $400 million by selling 387 million shares, or a
30 percent stake, on the Santiago exchange on May 19, he said.
IM Trust and Banchile Citi Global Markets are advising on the
deal.  “Historically, we’ve been the most proactive player in
Chile’s salmon industry in promoting consolidation,” Puchi said
today in an interview. After the IPO “we will remain with about
$150 million to take positions in other projects, with an
orientation toward market consolidation,” he said.  An IPO of $400 million would be the largest in Chile since
Inversiones Aguas Metropolitanas SA’s $457 million sale in 2005,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. CFR Pharmaceuticals SA
raised $370 million yesterday in Chile’s first IPO this year.  Costa Rica ,  Panama   AquaChile also aims to double tilapia output to 40,000 tons
per year in five years at farms in Costa Rica and Panama, as
demand is growing in the U.S. to replace falling production
levels of other fish, such as carp, he said. “Tilapia is the
chicken of fish,” he explained, as it is used because of its
mild taste as a way to introduce fish to children’s diets.  The company is also working to increase tilapia exports to
 Europe , where the fish suffers from a “poor quality” image due
to cheap imports from  Asia , Puchi said.  Salmon prices should remain “firm” in the next five years
as annual demand grows 6 percent to 8 percent, or about 100,000
tons, Puchi said. Demand from emerging economies has been
growing at double-digit rates, especially from  Brazil ,  Russia ,
Ukraine and  China , he said.  AquaChile’s first-quarter profit rose more than threefold
from a year earlier to $9.5 million on exports of 16,900 metric
tons, it wrote in a statement distributed yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
