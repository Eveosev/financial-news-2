The London Metal Exchange is opening
an “access point” for its LMEselect electronic trading system
at Interxion Holding NV’s  data center  in the city.  Exchange members who co-locate, or put servers in the same
data center as the LME, will benefit from the reduced amount of
time needed to place orders, Schiphol-Rijk, Netherlands-based
Interxion said in a statement e-mailed by the exchange today.
Co-locating will make screen trading less complex and cut so-
called connectivity costs, it said.  “We see increasing demand for fast access from new and
existing members of the exchange,” Michael Warren, the  LME ’s
chief technology officer, said in the statement.  The access point will also allow use of LMElive, the
exchange’s real-time price and data system, the statement shows.  To contact the reporter on this story:
