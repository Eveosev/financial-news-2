Coffee farmers in  Indonesia , the
world’s third-largest producer of robusta beans, are finding it
difficult to dry their coffee due to rains, Hamburg-based broker
Eugen Atte said.  Drying is being hampered “as rainfall didn’t stop during
the last days in the coffee areas,” the broker said yesterday
in a report on its  website .  Indonesian coffee is trading at a premium to the price on
the NYSE Liffe exchange in London for the first time this year,
the broker said. Coffee beans are priced at $60 a metric ton
above the exchange value, data from the brokerage showed.  Robusta coffee for July delivery retreated $3, or 0.1
percent, to $2,579 a ton by 11:43 a.m. in  London .  Indonesia’s coffee production will decline about 25 percent
to 8.5 million bags in the current crop year, the London-based
International Coffee Organization estimated on April 6.  Bean shipments from the port of Panjang climbed to 21,000
tons in April, almost double the amount a year earlier, Atte
said. Exports from the port totaled 11,359 tons in April 2010,
data from Dutch trader  Nedcoffee BV  showed. Coffee sales from
Indonesia accelerated in response to London prices, European
coffee brokers said on March 18.  To contact the reporter on this story:
