What follows are opening calls for
U.S. grain and oilseed markets.  -- Corn futures are called to open 9 cents to 11 cents a bushel
lower on the  Chicago  Board of Trade on speculation that warmer,
drier weather this week accelerated planting in the western
Midwest, reducing the risk for lower U.S. crop yields, said Chad Henderson, a market analyst for Prime Agricultural Consultants
Inc. in Brookfield,  Wisconsin .  -- Soybean futures may open 3 cents to 6 cents a bushel lower in
Chicago on speculation that the government will increase its
U.S. and world inventory forecasts in a report on May 11 on
rising South American production and reduced global demand,
Henderson said. Soybean-oil futures are expected to open 0.3
cent to 0.4 cent a pound lower, and soybean-meal futures may
open down $1 to up $1 for 2,000 pounds.  -- Wheat futures may open 1 cent to 2 cents a bushel higher on
the CBOT, the Kansas City Board of Trade and the  Minneapolis
Grain Exchange  on speculation that dry weather expected during
the next two weeks will reduce winter-grain production in the
southern Great Plains and parts of Europe and  China , Henderson
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
