The  International Monetary Fund 
approved a $6.2 billion  credit line  for  Colombia  today, noting
that the Colombian government doesn’t intend to draw on it.  “In the authorities’ view, Colombia remains exposed to
downside risks, including from severe commodity price
fluctuations and other adverse external developments,”  John Lipsky , the IMF’s first deputy managing director, said in a
statement.  The two-year “flexible credit line,” provided with no
conditions for countries deemed to have sound economic
fundamentals, is the third for Colombia and was increased from
the previous $3.5 billion arrangement.  Colombian central bank President Jose Dario Uribe in an
interview last month said the country’s economy may expand as
much as 5.5 percent this year, more than policy makers had been
projecting, as expansion in credit and consumer confidence
create “perfect” conditions for growth.  The IMF in a report this week warned that economies in
 Latin America  are showing signs of overheating. As growth
accelerates, inflation rates will climb and the region’s current
account deficit widen, the IMF said.  The credit line “would provide appropriate insurance
against shocks,” Lipsky said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
