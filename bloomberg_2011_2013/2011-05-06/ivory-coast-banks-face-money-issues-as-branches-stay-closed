Banks in  Ivory Coast  are yet to
restart receiving international money transfers that are needed
to fund exports of goods such as cocoa, as some local units of
foreign lenders stay closed.  The banks “are experiencing some technical problems with
international transfers,” Souleymanne Diarrassouba, managing
director of Lome-based Banque Atlantique and vice president of
an association of Ivorian bankers, said by phone from Abidjan,
the commercial capital, today.  The West African nation’s four-month political crisis over
a disputed November election caused the local units of foreign-
owned lenders to close their branches over security fears. After
the April 11 capture of ex-President  Laurent Gbagbo , some of the
sites have begun to reopen.  Citigroup Inc. said yesterday it reopened its office in the
world’s biggest cocoa producer, and Nigerian lenders  United Bank 
for Africa Plc and Access Bank Plc have also resumed operations.
BICICI, BNP Paribas SA’s unit, remains closed, Soir Info, an
Abidjan-based newspaper, reported today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
