Spanish industrial production fell the
most in five months in March, undermining the nation’s efforts
to emerge from the deepest economic slump in six decades.  Output at factories, refineries and mines fell 0.9 percent
from a year earlier, adjusting for the number of working days,
in the first decline since December, the National Statistics
Institute in  Madrid  said today in an e-mailed statement. The
institute revised its estimate of February output growth to 3.3
percent from 3.6 percent.  Spain ’s government forecasts the economy will grow 1.3
percent this year, led by exports as the deepest austerity
measures in three decades weaken domestic demand. The Bank of
Spain will publish its estimate of first-quarter gross domestic
product today at 10 a.m.  To contact the reporter on this story:
