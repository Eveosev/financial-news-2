Belgacom SA (BELG) , the largest telephone
company in  Belgium , lowered its revenue and earnings forecasts
after first-quarter sales fell more than analysts estimated
because of lower mobile voice revenue and fixed-line losses.  Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and
amortization will drop as much as 5 percent to 1.88 billion
euros ($2.71 billion) this year, the Brussels-based company said
today in a statement. That compares with a Feb. 25 forecast of
at least 1.94 billion euros, which was also the average of 23
analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Revenue may drop as
much as 2 percent rather than 1 percent, Belgacom said.  Belgacom joined Royal KPN NV, the Dutch incumbent operator,
in lowering its profit forecast because of an accelerating
decline in mobile voice revenue. The phone company lost 23,000
mobile customers in the quarter and is also facing increased
competition from cable operators Telenet Group Holding NV and
Voo in the residential fixed-line market as group line losses
accelerated to 52,000. Sales at the BICS unit, the world’s
fourth-largest voice carrier, unexpectedly declined.  “Especially the guidance change came as a surprise,”
Siddy Jobe, an analyst at Banque Degroof SA in Brussels, wrote
in a note to investors. “The lowered Ebitda guidance is the
result of near-term investments the company will make to win
back market share.” Jobe lowered his 12-month price estimate to
28.50 euros and maintained his “hold” recommendation.  Dividend  Belgacom fell 1.35 euros, or 5.1 percent, to a 10-month low
of 25.02 euros at the 5:35 p.m. close of trading on Euronext
Brussels. Today’s retreat, the biggest drop in 18 months, erased
456 million euros from Belgacom’s market value.  The Belgian incumbent operator said in February it would
maintain its dividend at 2.18 euros a share over 2011 earnings
and will “deliver” on its promise, Chief Financial Officer Ray Stewart said on a conference call with analysts today.  First-quarter sales fell 3.5 percent to 1.58 billion euros,
missing the 1.62 billion-euro average estimate of 12 analysts in
a Bloomberg survey. Voice revenue fell 11 percent in the
consumer business unit and slid 10 percent in the enterprise
division.  Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, amortization
and excluding a one-time gain a year earlier fell 3 percent to
480 million euros, or 30.3 percent of revenue. Analysts had
projected a margin of 29.8 percent, according to the average of
12 estimates in the survey.  To contact the reporter on this story:
