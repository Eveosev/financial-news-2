Korea Zinc  Co., which also produces
gold and silver, dropped the most in more than two years in
Seoul trading following declines in precious metal prices.  The Seoul-based company fell 9.5 percent to 365,500 won
($337) at 12:46 p.m. local time on the Korea Exchange. The
benchmark Kospi Index fell 2.0 percent.  Silver futures headed for the steepest weekly decline since
at least 1975 as an increase in margin requirements and slump in
commodities prompted investors to sell precious metals. Korea
Zinc generated 34 percent of first-quarter revenue from silver
refining, according to Lee Won Jae, an analyst at SK Securities
Co., who has a “buy” recommendation on the stock.  “The stock is largely affected from the sentiment on
silver on the global market,” Lee said, adding that the
company’s silver revenues exceeded its zinc sales for the first
time in the quarter. “Still, recent selling orders look too
excessive, given its improved earnings.”  Korea Zinc’s net income rose 14 percent to 193 billion won
in the three months ended March 31 on a consolidated basis.  To contact the reporter on this story:
