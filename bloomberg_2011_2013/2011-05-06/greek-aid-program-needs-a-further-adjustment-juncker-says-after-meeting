Luxembourg Prime Minister  Jean-Claude Juncker , head of the group of euro-area finance ministers, said
today that  Greece ’s financial assistance program “does need a
further adjustment” that will be discussed at the group’s next
meeting.  Juncker, speaking to reporters in Luxembourg said that EU
officials are “excluding the restructuring option which is
discussed heavily in certain quarters of the financial
markets.”  “We think that Greece does need a further adjustment
program,” Juncker said. “This has to be discussed in detail.”  European finance officials met in Luxembourg for an
unscheduled session that included talks on Greece.  Earlier, Spiegel magazine reported that ministers were
convening an emergency meeting after Greece threatened to
withdraw from the euro region. Greece rejected the report,
according to a finance ministry statement. German Chancellor
 Angela Merkel ’s chief spokesman “categorically” denied that
any discussions on a Greek exit were under way.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
