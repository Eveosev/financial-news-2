CEZ AS (CEZ) , the  Czech Republic ’s largest
power producer, may say first-quarter profit fell as global
electricity prices remained below last year’s level.  Net income in the three months through March 31 probably
dropped 11 percent to 15.6 billion koruna ($940 million) from
17.5 billion koruna a year earlier, according to a median
estimate of 10 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  While the Prague-based utility benefited from greater
demand for power as economies in central  Europe  continued their
recovery, it wasn’t enough to compensate for lower prices of
electricity. Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and
amortization will probably decline 3.7 percent to 26.3 billion
koruna and revenue in the quarter may fall 1.7 percent to 53
billion koruna, the survey shows.  “Small growth in volumes will not be strong enough to
compensate for lower electricity prices,” analyst  Pawel Puchalski  at Warsaw-based WBK Brokerage said in a note,
predicting “significant decline” in CEZ’s earnings.  CEZ is scheduled to release the first-quarter earnings
report on May 10 before trading begins on the Prague Stock
Exchange.  To contact the reporter on this story:
