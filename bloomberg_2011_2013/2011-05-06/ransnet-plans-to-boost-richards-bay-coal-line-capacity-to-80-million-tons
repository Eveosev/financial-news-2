Transnet Ltd., which manages  South
Africa ’s ports and rail system, plans to boost capacity of its
Richards Bay coal line to 80 million metric tons a year to
increase shipments from the continent’s biggest coal terminal.  The expansion project, which is still in the planning
stage, will cost about 5.1 billion rand ($758 million), Moira Moses, group executive for capital projects, said in an
interview in  Cape Town  today.  “We need to complete feasibility work on the project
before implementation can start,” Moses said. An upgrade
already underway will boost capacity to 67 million tons this
year, she said.  The rail line delivers coal to  Richards Bay Coal Terminal ,
Africa’s biggest coal export facility. The terminal won’t expand
further until the rail network and other infrastructure allows
it to utilize its current capacity, Chief Executive Officer
Raymond Chirwa said March 30. While RBCT is capable of shipping
91 million metric tons of coal a year, it exported 63.4 million
tons in 2009, according to Chirwa.  Owners of RBCT, on South Africa’s northeastern coast,
include  Exxaro Resources Ltd. (EXX) ,  BHP Billiton Ltd. (BHP) ,  Anglo American
Plc (AAL) ,  Xstrata Plc (XTA) , Total SA and  Sasol Ltd. (SOL)   Transnet will spend 16.4 billion rand over the next five
years on upgrading and maintenance at the port at Richards Bay,
and 30.1 billion rand at the Durban port, Africa’s biggest,
Brian Molefe, Transnet’s chief executive officer, told reporters
in Cape Town today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
