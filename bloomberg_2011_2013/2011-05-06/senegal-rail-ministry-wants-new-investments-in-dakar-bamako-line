Senegal ’s Ministry of Land and Rail
Transport is lobbying the governments of Senegal and Mali to
honor their debts to Transrail S.A., the Dakar-based rail
operator that runs a route between Dakar and the Malian capital,
Bamako, Senegal’s Communication Ministry said.  The rail ministry is also asking the two governments to
raise 4 billion  CFA francs  ($8.8 million) to revamp the railway,
according to an e-mailed statement from the ministry. The World
Bank has expressed an interest in financing the project, it
said.  Senegal’s port of Dakar competes with Ivory Coast’s Abidjan
in servicing Mali and Burkina Faso, both landlocked states. A
truck between Dakar and Bamako travels at just 6 kilometers (4.2
miles) an hour, according to a  World Bank  report published last
year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
