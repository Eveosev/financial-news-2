Slovakia’s largest opposition party
would win a parliamentary majority if an election were held
today as austerity measures dent the popularity of Prime
Minister  Iveta Radicova ’s government less than a year after
taking office,  SITA  reported.  Smer, headed by Radicova’s predecessor Robert Fico, would
take 81 seat in the 150-member assembly, SITA said, citing a
poll of 865 people conducted by Polis between April 30 and May
3. No margin of error was given.  The four coalition parties, led by Radicova’s SDKU, would
collect the remaining 61 deputies, according to the poll.  The next general elections in the euro-region nation are
due in 2014.  To contact the reporter on this story:
