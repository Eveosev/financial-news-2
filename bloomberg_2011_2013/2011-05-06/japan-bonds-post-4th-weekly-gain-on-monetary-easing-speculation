Japanese  government bonds  completed a
fourth weekly advance amid speculation the central bank will
ease monetary policy further to counter the yen’s gain.  The benchmark 10-year yield sank to a four-month low after
the yen strengthened beyond 80 per dollar for the first time in
seven weeks, rekindling concern the local currency’s advance
will erode exporters’ earnings. The  Ministry of Finance  is
scheduled to sell 2.2 trillion yen ($27 billion) in 10-year
bonds on May 12 and release reports on overseas investors’
transactions in Japanese securities for March.  “There isn’t a catalyst in the market that causes
investors to be bearish on bonds,” said  Akitsugu Bandou , a
senior economist in Tokyo at Okasan Securities Co., one of the
24 primary dealers obliged to bid at government debt sales.
Additional easing by the  Bank of Japan  is “likely and will be a
psychological support for the  bond market .”  The 10-year yield fell six basis points to 1.14 percent
this week in Tokyo at  Japan  Bond Trading Co., the nation’s
largest interdealer debt broker. The 1.3 percent security due
March 2021 added 0.536 yen to 101.417 yen. The yield was at the
lowest since Jan. 5. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  Five-year yields declined 4.5 basis points to 0.42 percent
this week. They slid to 0.415 percent yesterday, also the least
since Jan. 5. Japan’s financial markets were closed for the
three days through May 5 for national holidays.  Ten-year futures for June delivery jumped 0.70 to 140.75
this week at the  Tokyo  Stock Exchange.  Yield Spread  The difference in yield between 10-year Treasuries and
similar-dated Japanese government bonds shrank to 1.94
percentage points on May 5, the narrowest since Dec. 9,
increasing the allure of yen-denominated debt.  The yen gained to 79.57 per dollar on May 5, rising beyond
80 for the first time since March 18, the day after it touched a
postwar record of 76.25. A stronger local currency reduces the
value of overseas sales at Japanese exporters when repatriated.  Bank of Japan Deputy Governor Kiyohiko Nishimura proposed
expanding the asset-purchase program last month to cope with the
earthquake in March, which was voted down by the other eight
members. Kazuhiko Sano, chief strategist at Tokai Tokyo
Securities Co., said it was increasingly likely the central bank
will buy more assets after Nishimura’s proposal.  “For 10-year yields to fall below 1 percent, additional
monetary easing, namely increased buying of government bonds, is
necessary,” Sano wrote in a report yesterday. “Before the
April 28 policy meeting, I saw a chance of about 50 percent for
such a measure,” and the odds are now 70 to 80 percent, he said.  Flight to Safety  Japan’s bonds with a maturity of between one and 10 years
have returned 0.1 percent this year, according to an index
compiled by Bank of America Merrill Lynch. That compares with a
3.6 percent drop in the  Nikkei 225 (NKY)  Stock Average.  “ Risk aversion  is causing a flow of funds to bonds,” said
Kazuya Ito, a  fund manager  at Daiwa SB Investments Ltd. in Tokyo,
which oversees the equivalent of $57 billion.  The previous sale of 10-year bonds on April 5 attracted
bids for 3.97 times the amount on offer, compared with an
average of 3.18 for the past 10 auctions. The debt carried a
coupon of 1.3 percent.  “We want a coupon of at least 1.2 percent for 10-year
bonds” at next week’s sale, Okasan’s Bandou said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
