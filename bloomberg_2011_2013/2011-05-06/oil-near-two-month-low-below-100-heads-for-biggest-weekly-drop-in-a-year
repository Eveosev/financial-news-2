Oil traded near the lowest in almost
two months in  New York  and headed for the biggest weekly drop in
a year as a surprise increase in U.S. jobless claims added to
signs of slower growth in the world’s largest crude consumer.  Futures were 0.2 percent lower after declining 8.6 percent
yesterday, the biggest fall in more than two years. U.S
unemployment claims rose the most since August and German
factory orders slipped. A report today may show the U.S.
generated fewer jobs in April. Oil also slid as the dollar
advanced after European Central Bank President  Jean-Claude Trichet  said he wouldn’t raise  interest rates .  “The spike in weekly jobless claims and the drop in German
factory orders follow a series of weak economic data,” said
 John Kilduff , a partner at Again Capital LLC, a New York-based
hedge fund that focuses on energy. “The ECB is stepping back
from tightening, which is ending the commodity inflation trade.
This is a significant recasting of the environment.”  Crude for June delivery was at $99.56 a barrel, down 24
cents, in electronic trading on the  New York Mercantile Exchange 
at 10:08 a.m. Sydney time. Yesterday, the contract fell $9.44 to
$99.80, the lowest settlement since March 16 and the biggest
percentage drop since April 20, 2009. Prices are down 12.6
percent this week, the most since the week ended May 7, 2010,
and are 29 percent higher the past year.  Brent crude oil for June settlement plunged $10.39, or 8.6
percent, to $110.80 a barrel, the lowest since March 16, on the
London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange yesterday.  Technical Support  The drop came a day after Bloomberg’s Fear and Greed
Indicator generated a sell signal on New York crude for the
first time since March 11. Before the market opened Kilduff said
oil may fall as low as $98 a barrel if it settles below its 30-
day moving average. Crude closed below its 30-day and 50-day
moving averages for the first time since February.  Oil’s relative strength index, a measure of how rapidly
prices are rising or falling, dropped to 32, the lowest since
Aug. 24. A reading of 30 typically indicates the commodity may
rebound.  Oil options volatility increased and the price of the most
actively traded contract, the June $100 put, rose 1,304 percent.
The option, which gives the holder the right to sell crude for
June delivery at $100 a barrel, climbed to $2.95 yesterday from
21 cents on May 4, with 14,904 traded. It was at $3.17 today.  Brent, the European benchmark, traded at a premium of $11 a
barrel to U.S. futures yesterday. The difference between front-
month contracts in  London  and New York surged to a record $19.54
on Feb. 21. It averaged 76 cents last year.  Jobless Benefits  Applications for jobless benefits in the U.S. jumped by
43,000 to 474,000 in the week ended April 30, Labor Department
figures showed. Economists in a Bloomberg News survey estimated
they would fall to 410,000. A report today may show employers in
the world’s largest economy hired 185,000 additional workers in
April, compared with 216,000 in March.  Factory orders in  Germany  unexpectedly dropped 4 percent in
March from February, the Economy Ministry in Berlin said.
Economists forecast a gain of 0.4 percent, according to a
Bloomberg News survey.  The dollar increased as much as 2.1 percent to $1.451 per
euro yesterday, the highest level since April 26. A stronger
dollar curbs investor demand for raw materials. Commodity prices
plunged the most since 2009. Silver has fallen 25 percent in
four days, the biggest decline since 1983.  Oil has climbed 9.4 percent in New York this year as unrest
in the Middle East and North Africa toppled leaders in Tunisia
and  Egypt  and spread to  Libya ,  Algeria ,  Bahrain ,  Iran ,  Oman ,
Syria and Yemen. The Obama administration said it will permit
Libyan rebels to draw on the $33 billion in Libyan assets frozen
by U.S., as allied nations opposing  Muammar Qaddafi  looked for
further measures to force him from power.  To contact the reporters on this story:
