Banco Santander SA (SAN)  has temporarily
halted loans for the San Antonio hydroelectric dam in Brazil’s
Amazon region on concerns the project will harm the environment,
Valor Economico reported, citing internal correspondence from
the bank.  Banco Bradesco SA,  Banco do Brasil SA (BBAS3)  and Banco Itau BBA SA
are also financing the project, the Sao Paulo-based newspaper
said.  An official at Santander in Sao Paulo didn’t immediately
return calls by Bloomberg News for comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
