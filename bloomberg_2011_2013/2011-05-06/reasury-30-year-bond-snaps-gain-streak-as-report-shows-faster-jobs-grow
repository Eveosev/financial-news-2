Treasury notes gained for the seventh
day as speculation  Greece  may leave the European Union drove
investors to the safety of  U.S. government debt .  U.S. two-year note yields fell to the lowest level since
March 17 after Der Spiegel magazine reported that debt-strapped
Greece is considering withdrawing from the European monetary
union. Treasuries dropped earlier after a government report
showed the U.S. added more jobs than forecast in April. U.S.
stocks trimmed gains and commodities erased an earlier advance.  “It’s all Greece,” said Anthony Cronin, a Treasury trader
at  Societe Generale  in New York, one of the 20 primary dealers
that trade with the  Federal Reserve . “We’ve seen the front end
really catch a bid. There were a lot of shorts set after
payrolls and they’re rushing to cover.” A short position is a
bet that an asset will decline in value.  The yield on the two-year note fell two basis points, or
0.02 percentage point, to 0.55 percent at 4:59 p.m. in  New York ,
according to Bloomberg Bond Trader data. The 0.625 percent
security due in April 2013 rose 1/32, or 31 cents $1,000 face
amount, to 100 5/32.  Yields on 10-year notes were little changed at 3.15
percent, after reaching as much as 3.23 percent. U.S. 30-year
bond yields rose three basis points to 4.29 percent. Six-month
bill rates was unchanged at 0.056 percent after touching a
record low of 0.03 percent.  Hedge-fund managers and other large speculators increased
their net-long position in two-year note futures in the week
ending May 3, according to U.S. Commodity Futures Trading
Commission data.  Greece Reports  Speculative long positions, or bets prices will rise,
outnumbered short positions by 221,904 contracts on the Chicago
Board of Trade. Net-long positions rose by 43,284 contracts, or
24 percent, from a week earlier, the Washington-based commission
said in its Commitments of Traders report.  The euro today extended its losses against the dollar after
Der Spiegel magazine reported that Greece is considering
withdrawing from the  euro zone  and reintroducing its own
currency, and that the European Commission called a meeting to
discuss the move.  European finance officials are meeting in Luxembourg for an
unscheduled meeting that may discuss proposals for restructuring
Greek debt, said two European officials familiar with the
situation. A German official said the discussions would include
a German paper on options for confronting Greece’s growing debt
load, which has spurred speculation by investors that a
restructuring was a likely outcome.  Greece has been lobbying for easier terms on the 110
billion euros ($164 billion) of bailout loans as speculation of
a default mounts and officials put the finishing touches on a 78
billion-euro lifeline for  Portugal .  Euro Issues  “One concern is what would happen to euro banks that own the
debt, and is it going to be marked down further, creating more
of an economic issue,” said Thomas Roth, senior Treasury trader
in New York at Mitsubishi UFJ Securities USA Inc.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index rose 0.4 percent after
climbing as much as 1.4 percent. The Thomson Reuters/Jefferies
CRB Index of commodities fell 1.1 percent, while the dollar
rallied 1.5 percent to $1.4321 per euro.  Treasuries earlier fell after a report that payrolls
increased 244,000 last month after a revised 221,000 gain the
prior month, the Labor Department said today in  Washington .
Economists projected an April rise of 185,000, according to the
median estimate in a Bloomberg News survey. Employment excluding
government jobs jumped the most in five years.  The jobless rate rose to 9 percent from 8.8 percent in
March, the first increase since November.  Treasuries rose yesterday, pushing the yield on the 30-year
bond to 4.26 percent, the lowest since Dec. 7, as investors fled
risk assets amid a forecast for weaker economic growth and lower
inflation. Commodities plunged yesterday the most since 2009,
led by oil and silver, and stocks had posted the biggest three-
day drop since March. The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index rose 0.7
percent today, while commodities dropped for a fifth day.  Fed Stance  The Fed has held its target rate for overnight lending
between banks at zero to 0.25 percent since December 2008.
Policy makers affirmed at their April 27 meeting the plan to buy
Treasuries through June.  The Fed purchased $6.7 billion of Treasuries maturing from
November 2013 to October 2014 today.  The U.S. will sell $32 billion in three-year notes, $24
billion in 10-year debt and $16 billion in 30-year bonds on
three consecutive days beginning May 10, equaling the average
forecast in a Bloomberg News survey of 19 of 20 primary dealers
on May 2.  Yields on 10-year notes will rise to 3.60 percent by the
end of the second quarter, according to the average forecast in
a Bloomberg News survey of banks and securities firms, with the
most recent forecasts given the heaviest weightings.  “As long as the economy is in recovery mode, the risk-on
trade wins,” said  William Larkin , a fixed-income portfolio
manager in Salem,  Massachusetts , at Cabot Money Management,
which manages $500 million. “Rates are likely to rise over the
next 12 months as the economy gains traction.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
