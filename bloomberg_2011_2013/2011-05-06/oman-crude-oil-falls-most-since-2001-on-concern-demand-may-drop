Oman crude oil fell the most since
2001 amid a global slump in commodities caused by concern that
demand may decline.  Oman oil for immediate loading fell $10.88, or 9.5 percent,
to $104.08 a barrel, according to Bloomberg data. That’s the
biggest one-day decline since Nov. 14, 2001, and the lowest
since Feb. 22. Dubai for loading in July dropped 9.5 percent to
$103.65 and Murban crude declined 9.1 percent to $108.49.  Crudes from the Middle East have fallen this week amid
concern Chinese fuel demand growth may falter as the country
considers tightening measures to cool the economy and curb
inflation. Stockpiles of  diesel fuel  in Singapore also climbed
29 percent in the week ended May 4, leading to speculation that
supplies will be adequate to meet demand.  Middle East crude has been supported by a surge in refining
profits for middle distillates, including gasoil and kerosene.
Gasoil’s premium to Dubai crude was at $20.85 a barrel today,
about twice as much as a year earlier, according to data from
PVM Oil Associates Ltd., a London-based brokerage.  The Brent-Dubai exchange for swaps for June narrowed 33
cents to $5.92 a barrel, PVM data showed. The exchange for swaps
for July fell 32 cents to $6.02 a barrel.  Oman futures for July delivery dropped 68 cents to $104.40
a barrel on the  Dubai Mercantile Exchange  at 5:36 p.m.  Singapore 
time, with 846 contracts traded. The settlement price was at
$101.65 at 12:30 p.m. in Dubai.  To contact the reporter on this story:
