When Lincoln was nominated for
president, he was a former one-term congressman and a failed
Senate candidate from  Illinois . A self-made man, he came to
represent the promise of democracy.  (To listen to the podcast, click  here .)  By the time the Rail-Splitter was elected, seven states had
seceded and the country was on the brink of war. Remaining in
Springfield, Illinois, before assuming office, Lincoln was often
lampooned in the press. One cartoon in Harper’s Weekly showed
him drinking and laughing as a funeral cortege passed by -- the
coffin was labeled “Constitution” and “Union.”  On his way to  Washington , it didn’t help when in
Indianapolis he made a bawdy reference to the “free-love
arrangement” envisioned by the secessionists. After an
optimistic speech in Columbus,  Ohio , he was denounced as a
“clown.”  It was not until his brilliant July 4, 1861, address to
Congress showing the profound threat to democracy secession
represented that President Lincoln came into his own. Though he
was reviled for political reasons, after that hardly anyone
called him an “ape” or a “rube.”  I spoke with Adam Goodheart, author of “1861: The Civil
War Awakening,” on the following topics:  1. Fort Sumter  2. Strategic Blunder  3. Will to Compromise  4. Threat to Democracy  5. Emancipation  To buy this book in  North America , click  here .  ( Lewis Lapham  is the founder of  Lapham’s Quarterly  and the
