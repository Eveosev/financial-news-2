The rand headed for its first weekly
loss in three against the dollar and euro, after commodities
tumbled the most since 2009 yesterday.  The South African currency depreciated 0.2 percent to
6.7475 per dollar at 9:56 a.m. in Johannesburg, extending its
retreat this week to 2.7 percent, the biggest five-day decline
since November. Against the euro, it strengthened 0.1 percent to
9.8108, paring its decrease this week to 0.9 percent.  Gold, which along with platinum accounts for one-fifth of
 South Africa ’s exports, is set for the biggest drop since the
week to Feb. 27, 2009 on concern that economic growth will slow
as central banks seek to cool inflation by raising borrowing
costs. South Africa’s broadest stocks measure, the FTSE/JSE
Africa All Share Index, fell 0.8 percent, led by BHP Billiton
Plc, the world’s biggest and  Anglo American Plc (AGL) , the world’s
largest platinum producer.  “At the extreme, it’s possible that we are seeing a
bursting of a ‘commodity bubble,’”  John Cairns  and Nema Ramkhelawan, currency strategists at Rand Merchant Bank in
Johannesburg, wrote in a note to clients today. “The U.S. non-
farm payrolls employment report this afternoon takes even
greater-than-normal importance.”  U.S. employers added 185,000 jobs in April after an
increase of 216,000 positions in the previous month, according
to the median forecast of 86 economists in a Bloomberg News
survey before the Labor Department’s report today.  South Africa’s benchmark 13.5 percent bond due September
2015 rose less than 0.1 percent, to 121.175 rand. The yield fell
one basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 7.66 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
