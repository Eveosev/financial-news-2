Turkish prosecutors added a probe into
a plot to assassinate Greek Orthodox Patriarch Bartholomew I to
their investigation into an alleged coup plot against Prime
Minister  Recep Tayyip Erdogan , Radikal newspaper said.  The cases were united at the request of a prosecutor who
said Ismet Recber, the man allegedly chosen to kill the
Istanbul-based patriarch and six other priests, was part of an
armed group, Radikal said, citing a letter sent to the court.  The so-called Ergenekon trial alleges that military
officers, journalists, professors and others were part of a
widespread conspiracy to create havoc that would justify a coup
to overthrow Erdogan’s government.  Patriarch Bartholomew I is considered “first among
equals” in the leadership of the Orthodox Christian Church.  To contact the reporter on this story:
