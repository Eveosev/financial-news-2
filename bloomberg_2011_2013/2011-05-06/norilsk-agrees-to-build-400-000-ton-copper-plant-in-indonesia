OAO GMK Norilsk Nickel,  Russia â€™s
largest mining company, signed a memorandum of understanding to
build a copper plant in Indonesia with Nusantara Smelting Corp.  Under the accord, the companies will build a smelter with
capacity of 400,000 metric tons of copper a year, Norilsk said
in an e-mailed statement today. The two producers would also
develop copper and nickel deposits in Russia, it said, without
providing an estimate of the costs or any timeframe.  To contact the reporter on this story:
