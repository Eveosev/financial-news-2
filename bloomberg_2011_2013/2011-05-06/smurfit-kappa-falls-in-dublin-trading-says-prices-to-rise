Smurfit Kappa Group Plc (SKG) ,  Europe ’s
largest containerboard maker, fell 4.3 percent in Dublin trading
after saying cost increases have been “sharper and more
sustained than previously expected.”  Smurfit, which said it may need to raise prices to offset
increased costs, fell 37 euro cents to 8.32 euros, giving the
company a market value of 1.84 billion euros ($2.7 billion).  “Given the lag effect of passing on price increases,
margin pressure will persist in the near term,” Murray McCarter
and Conor Harnett, analysts at Dublin-based NCB stockbrokers,
said in a note today. “We are likely to review downward our
full-year 2011 and full-year 2012 forecasts. Achieving
additional corrugated price increases will be necessary to
offset the impact of rising raw material costs.”  Smurfit Chief Executive Officer Gary McGann said in today’s
statement that while the company had “good demand growth” in
the first quarter, the faster cost increases have caused “some
near-term margin pressure.” The Dublin-based company said it
had reduced net debt by 49 million euros in the first quarter.  To contact the reporter on this story:
