At least 32 people were buried in a
mass grave during weeks of heavy fighting in Yopougon, a
northern suburb of  Ivory Coast ’s commercial capital, Abidjan,
according to residents.  Mounds of dirt on an unpaved public square next to a burned
mosque covered the bodies of men, women and children, said
Tanoume Bamba, a resident of the area, in an interview today.  “I was a witness to the execution of four men that were
buried here earlier this month,” he said.  Troops loyal to President  Alassane Ouattara  declared the
area “liberated” on May 4 after clashes with militia that
occupied the area following the arrest of ex-President  Laurent Gbagbo  on April 11. His capture ended a four-month political
impasse sparked by disputed November election.  Bamba said the victims were buried by neighborhood
residents in a mass grave because medical services couldn’t get
to the area to remove the bodies earlier this month, when
fighting was still ongoing. A convoy of United Nations-marked
vehicles visited the site today.  Hundreds of shops and houses and most gas stations in the
area, which has about 1 million residents, were looted during
the fighting.  To contact the reporter on this story:
