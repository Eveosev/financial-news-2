Following is the text of
 Canada 's labor force survey released by  Statistics Canada .  Following two months of little change, employment rose
by 58,000 in April, mainly in part time. The unemployment
rate edged down 0.1 percentage points to 7.6%. Compared
with April 2010, employment has grown by 283,000 (+1.7%).  There were gains in finance, insurance, real estate and
leasing as well as in business, building and other support
services in April. Employment was essentially unchanged in
the other industries.  In April, Ontario and Newfoundland and Labrador were
the only provinces with notable employment gains. At the
same time, employment declined in Nova Scotia and Manitoba
while there was little change in the remaining provinces.  The number of employees rose in both the private and
public sectors in April. Over the past 12 months,
employment in the public sector has grown by 2.8% compared
with 1.6% in the private sector, while self-employment was
little changed.  Employment in part time increased by 41,000 in April,
and it edged up in full time. Over the past 12 months,
full-time employment grew by 1.9% compared with 0.8% in
part time.  With April's slight gain, full-time employment has
returned to the level of October 2008 for the first time.
The total number of hours worked, however, remained 0.6%
below its October 2008 level.  Employment was up among women aged 55 and over in
April, while it changed little for the other demographic
groups.  Service sector leads employment gains  The largest employment gains in April were in the
service sector, led by finance, insurance, real estate and
leasing (+19,000) and business, building and other support
services (+17,000).  In the goods sector, employment in natural resources
(+6,600) edged up in April.  Employment in both manufacturing and construction was
little changed in April. Over the past 12 months, however,
these industries had employment gains of 3.3% and 2.7%
respectively.  Despite little change over the last few months, the
fastest employment growth since April 2010 was in
transportation and warehousing (+7.7%). The second fastest
year-over-year growth was in health care and social
assistance (+3.6%), continuing its long-term upward trend.  Employment in Ontario continues upward trend  Employment in Ontario rose by 55,000 in April, driven
by gains in part time (+46,000). As a result, the
 unemployment rate  declined by 0.2 percentage points to

April's part-time gain, Ontario's employment growth of
157,000 (+2.4%) over the past 12 months was all in full
time.  Newfoundland and Labrador was the only other province
with a notable employment gain in April, up 3,100. Over
the past 12 months, the number of workers rose by 15,000
or 6.9%, the fastest rate of growth of all provinces. In

to 11.1%, its lowest rate since 1976, when comparable data
became available.  In April, employment fell by 5,500 in Nova Scotia and
by 3,300 in Manitoba.  In  Quebec , employment was unchanged in April, and the

months, employment among youths and core-aged women was
little changed, while it was up 105,000 (+1.7%) among core-

sample, and are therefore subject to sampling variability.
Estimates for smaller geographic areas or industries will
have more variability. For an explanation of sampling
variability of estimates, and how to use standard errors
to assess this variability, consult the "Data quality"
section of the publication Labour Force Information 
(71-001-X, free).  Unless otherwise stated, this release presents
seasonally adjusted data, which facilitates comparisons by
removing the effects of seasonal variations.  To contact the reporter on this story:
