PDG Realty SA Empreendimentos &
Participacoes climbed the most in four months in  Sao Paulo ,
leading gains for Brazilian homebuilders, after an unexpected
slowdown in inflation eased concern that higher borrowing costs
will damp housing demand.  PDG gained 5.6 percent to 8.93 reais at the 4:15 p.m. New
York time close, the steepest increase since Dec. 17. The
 BM&FBovespa Real Estate (IMOBBV)  Index advanced 2.9 percent.  The measure had tumbled 14 percent this year through
yesterday as central bank policy makers raised  interest rates  by
1.25 percentage points to 12 percent to rein in credit growth.
Finance Minister  Guido Mantega  said today that inflation has
peaked after a report showed the benchmark  consumer price index 
in April exceeded the upper limit of the government’s target
range for the first time since 2005.  “Anything that indicates that inflation is cooling, or
that reduces the expectation for higher interest rates, benefits
homebuilders,” said Armando Halfeld, an analyst at Rio de
Janeiro-based Ativa Corretora.  MRV Engenharia & Participacoes SA,  Brazil ’s fourth-biggest
homebuilder by revenue, gained 5.4 percent to 13.30 reais while
 Rossi Residencial SA (RSID3) , the sixth-biggest, advanced 3.4 percent to
13.70 reais.  Consumer prices, as measured by the IPCA index, rose 6.51
percent in April from the same month a year earlier, the
national statistics agency said today in a report distributed in
 Rio de Janeiro . Monthly inflation unexpectedly slowed to 0.77
percent, the agency said. Economists had expected prices to rise
0.84 percent, according to the median of 39 forecasts compiled
by Bloomberg.  Traders drove down yields on interest-rate futures, with
the yield on the contract due in January falling three basis
points, or 0.03 percentage point, to 12.29 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
