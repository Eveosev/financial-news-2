South Korea ’s Public Procurement
Service, which stockpiles strategic commodities, bought 1,000
metric tons of high-grade, primary aluminum in a tender,
according to a notice on the state-run agency’s  website  today.  The metal was so-called non-Western grade and the purchase
was made from Glencore International AG at a premium of $107 a
ton over the London Metal Exchange official cash-settlement
price for delivery to Daegu, the agency said. The premium
included insurance and shipping costs.  The agency plans to issue the result for another tender,
for 1,000 tons of Western-grade aluminum, on May 9.  To contact the reporter on this story:
