Diana Shipping Inc. (DSX) , which transports
commodities including iron ore and coal, said first-quarter
profit rose 15 percent as the company’s fleet expanded.  Net income increased to $33.1 million, or 41 cents a share,
from $28.8 million, or 36 cents, a year earlier, the Athens-
based company said today in a statement. Diana was expected to
earn 38 cents a share, according to the average of six analyst
estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Sales rose 12 percent to $69.4
million from $62.2 million.  Diana kept most of its fleet under long-term contracts to
avoid volatility in spot, or single-voyage, rates. The Baltic
Dry Index, a measure of spot shipping rates in the dry-bulk
market, dropped 55 percent in the quarter from the same period a
year earlier, according to London-based Baltic Exchange.  “It’s a conservative company with conservative
management,” said Wilhelm Gedde-Dahl, an analyst at Pareto
Securities ASA in Oslo, who has a “hold” rating on the stock.
“It’s a fairly stable business. They will have more new ships
coming online in the near future.”  Diana rose 7 cents, or 0.6 percent, to $11.19 in New York
Stock Exchange composite trading. The shares have declined 3.4
percent this year.  Diana operated an average of 23.4 vessels in the quarter,
up from 21 a year earlier. It was paid an average charter rate
of $31,592 per day in the quarter compared with $31,982 a year
earlier.  The company will continue buying ships to expand the fleet,
Chief Executive Officer Simeon Palios said in a conference call.  “Our company tends to continue its acquisition strategy
and acquire vessels with conservative leverage,” Palios said.  The Baltic Dry Index averaged 1,365 in the first quarter,
down from 3,027 a year earlier.  To contact the reporter on this story:
