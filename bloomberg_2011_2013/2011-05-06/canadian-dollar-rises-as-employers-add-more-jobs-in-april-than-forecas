Canada ’s dollar erased its gain
against the greenback as speculation Greece may stop using the
euro encouraged refuge demand for the U.S. currency.  The Canadian currency dropped 2.2 percent for the week, its
biggest loss since July, as commodities including crude oil
fell. The loonie rallied earlier today as government reports
showed Canadian and American employers added more jobs in April
than economists forecast.  “We’ve got that news coming out of  Europe  with talk about
Greece possibly wanting to leave the  euro zone , and that’s taken
a  bit of the shine off the euro and added some risk
sentiment,” said  David Watt , senior currency strategist at
Royal Bank of Canada’s RBC Capital Markets unit in Toronto. “It
seems like people are not confident being long on the Canadian
dollar at the present time.” A long is a bet an asset may gain
in value.  The loonie, as the Canadian dollar is also known for the
image of the aquatic bird on the C$1 coin, traded at 96.66 cents
per  U.S. dollar  at 5:03 p.m. in Toronto, compared with 96.69
cents yesterday, after rallying 1 percent earlier. One Canadian
dollar buys $1.0346. The currency touched 94.46 cents on April
29, the strongest level since November 2007.  Futures on crude oil dropped for a fifth day, falling 1.7
percent to $98.14 a barrel in New York. Canada is the largest
supplier of crude to the U.S., the world’s biggest economy.  Loonie Versus Euro  The Canadian dollar climbed 1.6 percent to C$1.3839 against
the euro, appreciated 0.7 percent to 83.43 yen and was little
changed at C$1.582 versus the pound.  Canadian bonds fell, pushing the 10-year yield up one basis
point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 3.19 percent. The price of
the 3.25 percent security maturing in June 2021 dropped 7 cents
to C$100.51.  Employers added a net 58,300 jobs in April after a decrease
of 1,500 in the previous month,  Statistics Canada  said. The
median forecast of 25 economists in a Bloomberg News survey was
for an increase of 20,000. The jobless rate unexpectedly dropped
to 7.6 percent.  “Blowout number,” Blake Jespersen, director of foreign
exchange at Bank of Montreal, said by phone from Toronto on the
gain in Canadian employment. “If commodity prices can
stabilize, the market will key in on this number and continue to
take the loonie higher.”  Payrolls in the U.S. increased by 244,000 workers last
month after a revised advance of 221,000 in March, the Labor
Department reported. The median forecast of 86 economists in a
Bloomberg News survey was for a gain of 185,000. The
 unemployment rate  unexpectedly rose to 9 percent.  Greece ’s Debt Turmoil  The greenback rose against most of its major counterparts
as two European officials familiar with the situation said
European finance officials are meeting in Luxembourg for an
unscheduled meeting that may discuss proposals for restructuring
Greek debt.  A German official said the discussions would include a
German paper on options for confronting Greece’s growing debt
load, which has spurred speculation by investors that a
restructuring was a likely outcome.  Earlier, Spiegel magazine reported that ministers are
convening an emergency meeting after Greece threatened to
withdraw from the euro region. Greece rejected the report,
according to a finance ministry statement and German Chancellor
 Angela Merkel ’s chief spokesman “categorically” denied that
any discussions on a Greek exit were under way. He declined to
comment when asked whether officials are meeting tonight.  To contact the reporters on this story:
