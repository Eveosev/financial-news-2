The pound pared its decline against
the dollar after a report showed U.K. producer prices climbed
more than forecast in April.  The British currency traded little changed at $1.6381 as of
9:34 a.m. in  London  after falling as much as 0.2 percent.  The cost of goods at factory gates increased 0.8 percent
from March, the  Office for National Statistics  said today in
London. The median forecast of 12 economists in a Bloomberg News
survey was for a 0.7 percent gain.  To contact the reporter on this story:
