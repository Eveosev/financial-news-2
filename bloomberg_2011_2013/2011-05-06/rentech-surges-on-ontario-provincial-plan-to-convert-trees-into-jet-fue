Rentech Inc. (RTK) , a developer of renewable
fuels and power from biomass, jumped as much as 8 percent after
Ontario agreed to use their technology to convert provincial
forests into jet fuel.  Rentech rose 7 cents, or 7 percent, the most in a month, to
$1.07 at 11:14 a.m. in New York Stock Exchange trading. Earlier,
they reached as high as $1.08 a share.  Ontario will supply Rentech with 1.3 million tons of wood
to produce about 23 million gallons (85 million liters) of its
jet fuel as well as 13 million gallons of naphtha, a chemical
feedstock, Los Angeles-based Rentech said today in a statement.
The project, which may cost up to C$500 million ($521 million)
to build, should begin operating in 2015, Rentech said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
