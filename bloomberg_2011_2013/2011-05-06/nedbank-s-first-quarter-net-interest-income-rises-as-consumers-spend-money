Nedbank Group Ltd. (NED) , the South African
bank controlled by insurer  Old Mutual Plc (OML) , said first-quarter
net interest income grew as consumers spent money and interest
rates remained low in Africa’s largest economy.  Net interest income, which is revenue from lending minus
payments to depositors, increased 5.9 percent to 4.28 billion
rand ($636 million) while non-interest revenue rose by 16.4
percent to 3.54 billion rand, according to a statement released
by the Johannesburg-based lender today. “Proactive risk
management and the lower interest rates contributed to the
credit-loss ratio improving to 1.15 percent,”  Nedbank  said,
compared with 1.46 percent a year earlier.  Nedbank, South Africa’s fourth-largest lender by assets,
has been trying to broaden its business lines and make profit in
areas other than  consumer banking , which was hurt by the global
financial crisis. Parent company U.K.-based Old Mutual has said
it may sell its stake in Nedbank in the next 18 months as it
seeks to cut debt.  “The group expects interest rates to remain unchanged
throughout 2011, but the upside risks have increased due mainly
to rising global food and fuel prices,” Nedbank said in the
statement. The lender said there will be further earnings growth
in 2011.  Nedbank dropped 45 cents, or 0.3 percent, to 140.45 rand at
9:55 a.m. in Johannesburg trading.  To contact the reporter on this story:
