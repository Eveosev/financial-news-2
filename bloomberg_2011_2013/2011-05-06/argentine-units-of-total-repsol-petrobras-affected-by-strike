Argentine liquid gas production
workers are striking at plants operated by companies including
 Total SA (FP)  and Repsol  YPF SA (YPFD) , according to a union official.  Workers started striking late yesterday at natural-gas
bottling plants and will decide today whether to extend the
strike to oil refineries, Juan Ayala, spokesman for the Oil and
Gas Workers Federation, said today in a telephone interview.  Bottled gas is mostly used for home heating in Argentina in
households that don’t have access to natural gas networks.
Leading processors of the fuel include YPF SA, which is the
local unit of  Spain ’s Repsol, and  Transportadora de Gas del Sur
SA (TGSU2) , in which Petrobras Energia SA is the biggest shareholder.  Workers are demanding a 36 percent salary increase while
the companies are offering about 20 percent, Ayala said from
 Buenos Aires . There are some 6,000 union workers at the gas
units nationwide, Ayala said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
