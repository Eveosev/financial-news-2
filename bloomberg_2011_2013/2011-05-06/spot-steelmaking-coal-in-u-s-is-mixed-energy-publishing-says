Metallurgical coal prices were mixed
this week on the U.S. spot market amid slack demand, according
to Energy Publishing Inc.  Spot prices for low-volatility coking coal rose $1, or 0.3
percent, to $316.50 a ton in the week ended today, the
 Knoxville, Tennessee-based  data provider reported. High-
volatility coal fell $12, or 4.1 percent, to $280.  “There is little activity, indicating that global buyers
have what they need for now,” Energy Publishing said.  The data provider says it surveys buyers and sellers of
coal to determine pricing.  To contact the reporter on this story:
