Camelot Ghana Ltd. (CMLT) , a printer of
checkbooks and business forms in the West African nation, rose
the most on record after declaring a dividend of 0.5 pesewa a
share for the year through December.  The stock gained 1 pesewa, or 9.1 percent to 12 pesewas by
12:30 p.m. in the capital, Accra, the biggest intraday advance
since Bloomberg started compiling the data in 1999.  Camelot Ghana will pay the dividend on Aug. 26, it said in
a statement on the Ghana Stock Exchange website today. Investors
that register in the companyâ€™s books by July 20 qualify for
dividend, it said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
