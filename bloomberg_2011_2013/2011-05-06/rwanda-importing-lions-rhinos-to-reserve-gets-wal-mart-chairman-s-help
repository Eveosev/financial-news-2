Rwandan President  Paul Kagame  named
Claver Gatete as the African country’s new central-bank governor
in a “re-shuffle” of senior officials.  The former governor, Francois Kanimba, was named the new
minister of trade and industry, according to the government
 website . Monique Nzanzabaganwa, the minister of trade and
industry, took Gatete’s former role as vice-governor of the
central bank. The appointments were made May 6.  Formal swearing-in ceremonies will take place next week
before officials in the East African country take up their new
posts, according to Kanimba.  “Change will sometimes bring new things, new visions,” the
governor said May 8 in a phone interview from the capital,
Kigali. “I hope that I will be in a position to deliver.”  A former World Bank senior economist, Kanimba was the
bank’s vice-governor in 2000, and began his first six-year term
as governor two years later. His new appointment comes about
halfway through his second term.  Gatete, a former ambassador to the  United Kingdom , was
reached by mobile phone today, but said he was not available for
comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
