Natural gas shipments for delivery to
U.S. power plants dropped for a third day as milder weather in
the Southeast cut demand for gas-generated electricity.  A sample of scheduled shipments for U.S. electricity
generation fell 6.3 percent to 12.8 million dekatherms (12.5
billion cubic feet), according to data compiled by Bloomberg as
of 11 a.m. in  New York .  Deliveries for  Florida  declined 2.6 percent to 2.85 million
dekatherms, about 22 percent of U.S. demand from power plants,
Bloomberg data show.  Wholesale gas for next-day delivery at Florida Gas
Transmission Zone 3 fell 2.6 percent to $4.54 per million
British thermal units yesterday on the Intercontinental
Exchange.  Temperatures will be in a normal range in the U.S. East and
Southeast through May 10, according to Commodity Weather Group
LLC in Bethesda, Maryland.  The high temperature in Jacksonville, Florida, may be 79
degrees Fahrenheit (26 Celsius) today, 4 degrees below normal,
according to AccuWeather Inc. in  State College , Pennsylvania.  To contact the reporter on this story:
