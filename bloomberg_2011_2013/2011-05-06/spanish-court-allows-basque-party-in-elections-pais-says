Spain ’s Constitutional Court ruled to
allow Basque party Bildu to stand in local elections this month,
overturning a decision from the  Supreme Court , El Pais reported,
citing the court.  The decision may prompt the  Basque Nationalist Party  to
resume its support of Prime Minister Jose Luis Rodriguez
Zapatero’s minority Socialist government in  Madrid , the
newspaper said. The Basque Nationalist Party suspended their
support for Zapatero after the initial court ruling, the
newspaper said.  Click here for web link  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
