Winifred Jiau, a former consultant
with expert networking firm Primary Global Research LLC who was
charged in a nationwide insider trading probe, is in plea
negotiations with federal prosecutors, according to court
filings.  In a May 3 letter to Jiau’s lawyers about evidence for her
upcoming June 1 trial in Manhattan federal court, the government
said it was supplementing the letter with additional information
“as part of the parties’ ongoing plea discussions.”  Jiau’s lawyer, Joanna Hendon, didn’t return a voicemail
message left at her office seeking comment.  Ellen Davis , a
spokeswoman for Manhattan U.S. Attorney  Preet Bharara , declined
to comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
