Cyprus’s first-quarter deficit widened
almost sevenfold, to 311.6 million euros ($453 million) from
47.1 million euros a year earlier, on lower revenue and higher
spending, the  Ministry of Finance  said.  Government revenue declined 7.4 percent to 1.4 billion
euros, as tax revenue fell 4.1 percent to 1.3 billion euros and
non-tax revenue fell 28 percent to 149.2 million euros, the
ministry said in a  statement  on its website today.  Public expenditure rose 9.6 percent to 1.8 billion euros,
causing a primary deficit of 141.4 million euros, compared with
a 64.4 million-euro surplus the year before. The primary figure
doesn’t include debt-interest payments, which rose 53 percent,
to 170.2 million euros.  To contact the reporter on this story:
