Western  Canada  Select crude weakened
the most in more than two months as producers estimated
production would rise this year in Canada.  Suncor Energy Inc. (SU)  expects to begin producing oil from an
expansion at its Firebag oil sands project in  Alberta  in early
July and be fully operational in the third quarter, the company
said in an earnings statement earlier this week.  MEG Energy
Corp. (MEG)  said yesterday that it doubled bitumen output in the first
quarter to 27,653 barrels a day from the same period a year ago.  The discount for Western Canada Select versus benchmark
West Texas Intermediate widened 85 cents to $17.10 a barrel at
11:54 a.m. in  New York , according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
That’s the largest single-day fall since Feb. 23.  The premium for Syncrude lost 50 cents to $13.10 a barrel
over WTI. Syncrude is a light, low-sulfur synthetic oil derived
from the  tar sands  in Alberta.  U.S. Gulf Coast crude premiums strengthened as the gap
between the U.S. benchmark and Brent widened. When Brent
increases versus WTI, it boosts the value of low-sulfur U.S.
grades that compete with West African oils priced against the
European grade.  The gap between WTI and its European counterpart for June
delivery decreased $1.13 to $12.13 a barrel at 12:31 p.m. in New
York.  Heavy Louisiana Sweet’s premium to WTI gained $1 to $14 a
barrel, while Light Louisiana Sweet gained 40 cents to $14.65
over the benchmark.  Among sour, or high-sulfur, grades, the premium for Mars
Blend added 35 cents to $6.35 a barrel over WTI. Poseidon’s
premium widened 55 cents to $6.75.  Thunder Horse’s premium lost 10 cents to $10.25 a barrel
over WTI. Southern Green Canyon’s premium gained 45 cents to
$4.45 a barrel.  West  Texas  Sour’s discount was unchanged at $2.75 a barrel.
It has tracked more closely to its historical average discount
versus WTI because it’s delivered in Midland, Texas, away from
the Gulf Coast and close to Cushing, Oklahoma, the delivery
point for oil traded on the  New York Mercantile Exchange .  To contact the reporter on this story:
