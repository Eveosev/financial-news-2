Barton Biggs  said he still feels
“good about the U.S. market” and that oil’s decline this week
will reduce the degree of an economic slowdown.  Biggs, speaking in a Bloomberg Television interview today,
said he likes shares of companies such as Caterpillar Inc. and
 Deere & Co. (DE)  He runs Traxis Partners LP, a hedge fund based in
New York.  “I still feel good about the U.S. market, because I think
the decline in oil prices we’ve had takes a lot of the sting out
of the threat of a soft patch,” he said. “We’re going to have
a soft patch but it’s not going to be a very long lasting one.”  Crude oil plunged 15 percent this week, the most since
December 2008, after Osama bin Laden’s death helped wipe out
gains spurred by violence in north African and the Middle East.
 Caterpillar Inc. (CAT) , the world’s biggest maker of construction
equipment, has retreated 4.3 percent since April 29 and Deere,
the largest producer of  farm equipment , has fallen 5.8 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
