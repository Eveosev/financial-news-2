Esso ( Thailand ) Pcl, a refinery unit
of Exxon Mobil Corp., rose to its highest level in a week in
Bangkok trading after  Thai Oil Pcl (TOP)  said it may buy a stake in
the company.  The shares rose 1.8 percent to 11.2 baht as of 12:30 p.m.
local time, poised for the highest close since April 27.  The board of Thai Oil, the nation’s largest refiner,
approved a four-month study of a proposal to buy shares in Esso
from Exxon, Chief Executive Officer Surong Bulakul said today.  Esso’s fair value was raised to 15.7 baht by Asia Plus
Securities Pcl, which has a “buy” recommendation on the shares,
based on an assumption that Thai Oil may pay 15.7 baht a share
for the Esso stake, analyst Nalinrat Kittikumpolrat said in a
research note today.  Thai Oil may spend 50 billion baht ($1.66 billion) to buy
2.26 billion shares of Esso, the Thai-language Krungthep Turakij
reported today, citing an unidentified official at Thai Oil.  “We haven’t started a negotiation process yet,” Surong
said by phone. “We see that there is a possibility to create
synergy and add value to our refinery.”  Shares of Thai Oil fell 3.4 to 78.75 baht, poised for the
lowest close since March 11.  To contact the reporter on this story:
