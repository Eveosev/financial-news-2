Bank of England  Governor  Mervyn King 
said officials must focus more on lenders’ structure to improve
both financial stability and the operation of monetary policy.  “In  Europe  we must pay more attention to the structure of
our banks and the state of their balance sheets not only for
financial stability but also for the conduct of monetary
policy,” King said in a speech in Helsinki today.  “Monetary policy operates partly through its effect on the
banking system,” he said. “Economic theory had paid
insufficient attention to the way the transmission mechanism of
monetary policy depends upon the details of the behavior of the
banking system.”  Officials on the  Basel Committee on Banking Supervision 
should bear in mind banks’ tendency to “be over-optimistic as
to their future liquidity” as they decide on new  capital
requirements , King said, citing former Bank of Finland Governor
Klaus Waris.  He also called on global authorities to cooperate as they
work to solve the problems caused by the financial crisis.  “In these circumstances, no country is an economic island
and our salvation must be found in international cooperation,”
he said. “That must be built on national sovereignty. But for
national sovereignty to be successful in an interdependent
economic world requires a degree of trust and mutual
cooperation. That has not always been present but is more
necessary than ever.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
