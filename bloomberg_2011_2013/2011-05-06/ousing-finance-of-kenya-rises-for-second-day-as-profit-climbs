Housing Finance Co.,  Kenya â€™s only
publicly traded mortgage lender, advanced for the second day
after saying first-quarter profit climbed 65 percent as income
from loans grew.  The stock rose 50 cents, or 1.9 percent, to 26.75 shillings
as of 12:35 p.m. today in the capital, Nairobi.  Net income increased 65 percent to 120.1 million shillings
($1.4 million) in the three months through March compared with a
year earlier, the Nairobi-based company said yesterday.  Net interest income, the money banks earn from interest
charges on loans, climbed 32 percent to 434.6 million shillings,
it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
