New Zealand ’s electricity market
regulator ruled that an undesirable trading situation developed
in the wholesale market on March 26 when prices surged as much
as 190 times normal levels over about seven hours.  In a preliminary ruling, the Electricity Authority said
today the prices should be reset at lower levels. It said the
conduct of Genesis Power Ltd., which benefitted from the higher
prices, wasn’t unlawful and didn’t constitute manipulative
trading activity.  Users complained after wholesale prices for regions in the
north of the  North Island , including the city of Auckland, rose
as high as NZ$19,000 ($15,000) a megawatt-hour after a scheduled
outage on transmission lines that bring power from southern New
Zealand. Prices are usually as low as NZ$100 a megawatt-hour
when transmission is normal.  The events “threaten to undermine confidence in and
threaten to damage the integrity and reputation of the wholesale
market,” the  authority  said.  Genesis which owns the Huntly plant located north of the
point of outage, offered extremely high prices into the market
and these became the spot price that users had to take, the
authority said in the ruling. Thirty-five parties lodged a claim,
saying they faced unacceptable losses and there had been an
undesirable trading situation, initiating the review.  The authority estimated the new prices for power should be
between NZ$1,500 and NZ$3,000 a megawatt-hour.  To contact the reporter on this story:
