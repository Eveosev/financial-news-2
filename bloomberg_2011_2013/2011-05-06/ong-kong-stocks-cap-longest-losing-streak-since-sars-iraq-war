Hong Kong stocks fell for an eighth
day, the longest stretch of losses since the 2003 spread of
severe acute respiratory syndrome and the U.S. invasion of Iraq,
as economic reports in America and falling commodity prices
damped investor confidence in the global recovery.  Li & Fung Ltd. (494) , the biggest supplier to retailers including
Wal-Mart Stores Inc., dropped 0.6 percent.  HSBC Holdings Plc (HSBA) ,
which made 20 percent of its 2009 revenue in  North America , lost
1.4 percent.  Cnooc Ltd. (883) ,  China ’s biggest offshore oil producer,
retreated 2.3 percent, while Jiangxi Copper Co., China’s No. 1
producer of the metal, sank 2.2 percent.  “There’s been a decline in sentiment,” said Peter Elston,
a strategist at Aberdeen Asset Management Plc, which oversees
about $282 billion. “Fears of the  U.S. economy  grew yesterday.
I haven’t been convinced by these recoveries in the developed
world as I just see them being driven by stimulus and the major
structural trend is one of deleveraging.”  The  Hang Seng Index (HSI)  fell 0.4 percent to 23,159.14 at the
close, its longest losing streak since April 2003. Four stocks
fell for every three that rose in the 45-member index. The gauge
declined 2.4 percent for the week. The  Hang Seng  China
Enterprises Index of Chinese companies’ H shares gained 0.3
percent to 12,848.82.  Li & Fung slid 0.6 percent to HK$36.55, while HSBC sank 1.4
percent to HK$82.70, the biggest drag on the Hang Seng Index.  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index climbed 0.4
percent today. In New York, the index dropped for a fourth day,
falling 0.9 percent yesterday.  U.S. Economy  Service industries in the U.S. expanded in April at the
slowest pace in eight months as companies cut back in response
to higher energy costs, according to the  Institute for Supply
Management ’s index of U.S. non-manufacturing companies published
on May 4.  Applications for jobless benefits unexpectedly jumped by
43,000 to 474,000 in the week ended April 30, the most since
August, Labor Department figures showed yesterday.  Also, U.S. consumer confidence dropped last week to the
lowest level in more than a month as rising fuel costs squeezed
American household budgets. The Bloomberg Consumer Comfort Index
decreased to minus 46.2 in the week ended May 1, the lowest
level since the end of March, from minus 45.1 the prior period.  Commodity stocks fell after crude oil and metal prices
declined on concern that economic growth will slow as central
banks seek to cool inflation by raising borrowing costs.  Cnooc, PetroChina  “The U.S. and global recovery is a slow recovery, not a
full swing recovery,” said Diane Lin, a  fund manager  at Pengana
Capital, which oversees $1 billion in Sydney. “Commodities are
overbought and over-owned. We’re seeing a correction on that. We
don’t think it’s something that will give structural growth.”  Cnooc slid 2.3 percent to HK$17.98, while PetroChina Co.,
the country’s largest oil company, dropped 0.8 percent to
HK$10.48. Jiangxi Copper fell 2.2 percent to HK$24.10.  Crude oil for June delivery plunged 8.6 percent to $99.80 a
barrel yesterday, the lowest settlement in  New York  since March
16. The London Metal Exchange Index of six metals including
copper and aluminum sank for a second day, falling 4 percent
yesterday, the biggest drop since November 16.  ‘Shakeout Was Due’  “There was so much money that was poured into commodities
that we were due for a shakeout,” said Aberdeen’s Elston.
“Economies in  Asia  are still essentially growing at decent
rates, and if central banks aren’t doing enough to rein that in,
then you won’t actually see real demand for commodities fall.
Once people realize that, they’ll come back in.”  European Central Bank President  Jean-Claude Trichet 
signaled yesterday the bank will wait until after June to raise
 interest rates  again, wrong-footing some investors who had
expected a quicker move to fight inflation.  Hong Kong stocks last sank for eight straight days in the
period ended April 1, 2003, after U.S. forces began their attack
on  Iraq  with cruise missiles in what commanders described as a
plan to “decapitate” Saddam Hussein’s leadership before an
all-out assault to disarm the nation.  The region’s markets also plunged in 2003 as a global
outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome, or SARS, killed
at least 774 worldwide, with China and Hong Kong accounting for
more than 80 percent of deaths, according to the  World Health
Organization .  Airlines Climb  The Hang Seng advanced 1.1 percent this year through
yesterday, as global economic data and corporate earnings eased
concern that  Japan ’s nuclear crisis and tensions in the Middle
East will derail growth. Shares in the gauge traded at an
average 12.3 times forecast earnings yesterday, compared with
14.4 times at the end of last year, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg.  While  oil companies  dropped on lower crude prices, airlines
advanced on speculation fuel costs will drop.  Cathay Pacific
Airways Ltd. (293)  gained 3.2 percent to HK$19.90, the biggest
increase in the Hang Seng Index. China Southern Airlines Co.,
Asia’s largest carrier by passenger numbers, surged 7.1 percent
to HK$4.24, while rival China Eastern Airlines Corp., the
nation’s No. 2 by people carried, increased 5.5 percent to
HK$3.64.  Futures on the Hang Seng Index dropped 0.6 percent to
22,970. The HSI Volatility Index, the benchmark gauge for Hong
Kong stock options, slid 1.2 percent to 17.09, indicating
options traders expect a swing of 4.9 percent in the Hang Seng
Index in the next 30 days.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
