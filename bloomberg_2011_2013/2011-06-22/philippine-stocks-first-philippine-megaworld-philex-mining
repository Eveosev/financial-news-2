will invest $1 billion over a three-year period to develop its
Silangan gold and copper project. The project has an estimated 5
billion pounds of copper and 9 million ounces of gold, Philex
said in a regulatory filing today. The estimate may further
increase with the inclusion of Manila Mining Corp.’s Kalayaan
mine, where Philex has a farm-in agreement, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
