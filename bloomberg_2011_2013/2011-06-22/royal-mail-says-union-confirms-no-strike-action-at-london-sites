Royal Mail  Group said no strike
action by workers would take place in four London sites after it
agreed an operational plan with the  Communication Workers Union 
about the changes to mail centers in Greater London, the company
said in an e-mailed statement today. The CWU confirmed that no
strikes would take place in the sites, the statement said. The
program of change will result in about 750 job cuts which will
be carried out without compulsory redundancies, Royal Mail said
in the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
