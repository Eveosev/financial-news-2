Nova Kreditna Banka Maribor d.d.
said it wants to buy the rest of Zavarovalnica Maribor d.d.,
Slovenia’s second-largest insurance company, according to a

50 percent of the insurer.  Pozavarovalnica Sava d.d., the second-largest investor in
Zavarovalnica Maribor with a 45.8 percent holding, said in a
separate statement that it won’t accept the offer.  Nova Kreditna shares continued to hover at the lowest level
since the initial public offering in December 2007. The stock
fell 13 eurocents, or 1.7 percent, to close at 7.27 euros. Sava
Re was unchanged at 6.80 euros on the Ljubljana stock exchange.  -- Editors: Douglas Lytle, James M. Gomez  To contact the reporter on this story:
