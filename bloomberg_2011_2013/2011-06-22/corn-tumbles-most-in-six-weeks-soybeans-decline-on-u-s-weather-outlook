Corn fell the most in six weeks and
soybeans declined on bets that favorable weather will boost
yields in the U.S., the world’s biggest grower and exporter.  National Weather Service computer models showed a shorter
period of hot weather next week, and less heat will boost
Midwest crop development, World Weather Inc. said. Increased
soil-moisture reserves from rain this week and showers in the
next two weeks will maintain favorable growing conditions, the
forecaster said.  The weather outlook “is pressuring the grain markets,”
said  Don Roose , the president of U.S. Commodities Inc. in  West
Des Moines ,  Iowa . “Rain and warmer temperatures are just what
the crops need.”  Corn futures for December delivery fell 24.5 cents, or 3.6
percent, to $6.5575 a bushel at 10:50 a.m. on the Chicago Board
of Trade. A close at that price would mark the biggest drop for
a most-active contract since May 11.  Soybean futures for November delivery declined 12.5 cents,
or 0.9 percent, to $13.3725 a bushel. On June 20, the price
touched $13.30, the lowest for a most-active contract since May
17.  About 70 percent of the corn crop and 68 percent of
soybeans were in good or excellent condition as of June 19, the
U.S.  Department of Agriculture  said this week.  “The crops are getting better,” Roose said. “The
government ratings are likely to show further improvement next
week.”  Corn is the biggest U.S. crop, valued at $66.7 billion in
2010, followed by soybeans at $38.9 billion, government figures
show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
