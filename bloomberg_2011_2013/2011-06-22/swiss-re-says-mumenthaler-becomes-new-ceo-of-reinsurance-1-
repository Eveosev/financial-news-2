Swiss Re Ltd., the world’s second-
biggest reinsurer, said Christian Mumenthaler will become head
of its reinsurance business in October.  Mumenthaler, chief marketing officer for reinsurance since
last October, will be responsible for strategy and business
performance, including financial results and asset allocation,
the Zurich-based company said today in an e-mailed  statement .  Swiss Re last month formed a new holding company that
overarches its reinsurance operations, which account for about
80 percent of the company’s business, plus the smaller corporate
solutions and Admin Re units. Chief Executive Officer Stefan Lippe will continue to run the group, Swiss Re said today.  “Swiss Re is completing a refurbishment of its leadership
structure to reflect the company’s new legal entity setup,”
said  Fabrizio Croce , a Zurich-based analyst with Kepler Capital
Markets, in a note to investors. “The good news is that capable
persons at Swiss Re are being promoted and are receiving more
power and responsibility.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
