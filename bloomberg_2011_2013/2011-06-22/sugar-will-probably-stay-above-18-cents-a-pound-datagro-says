Sugar prices will probably stay
above 18 cents a pound as production costs rise in  Brazil ,
according to industry researcher Datagro Ltd.  The cost of production is 18 cents a pound, up from 5.5
cents in 2002, Guilherme Nastari, a director at Datagro, said at
a conference in Brussels today. Brazil can make sugar or ethanol
from sugar cane.  “Brazil will make ethanol if the price falls below 18
cents a pound,” he said.  Raw sugar for October delivery was 25.99 cents a pound by
10:22 a.m. on ICE Futures U.S. in  New York .  The cost of production has climbed mainly because of the
increased value of the Brazilian real against the dollar,
Nastari said. The strengthening real means exporters earn less
converting dollar-priced sugar into their local currency.  To contact the reporter on this story:
