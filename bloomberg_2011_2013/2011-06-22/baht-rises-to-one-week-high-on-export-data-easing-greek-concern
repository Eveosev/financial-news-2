Thailand ’s baht advanced to a one-
week high after a report this week showed exports increased more
than economists forecast last month, adding to signs economic
growth is on track.  The baht strengthened for a second day as the MSCI Asia-
Pacific Index of shares rose after Greek Prime Minister  George
Papandreou  won a parliamentary confidence vote, moving the
country a step closer to avoiding a default. Thai exports, which
account for about two-thirds of the economy, increased 17.6
percent in May from a year earlier, more than the 15.6 percent
gain that economists surveyed by Bloomberg had forecast, a
government report showed on June 20.  “Concern over  Greece  has eased a bit today, which supports
sentiment for stocks and regional currencies,” said  Hideki Hayashi , a global economist at Mizuho Securities Co. in  Tokyo .
“With today’s sentiment, better-than-expected economic data is
supportive for the baht.”  The baht added 0.1 percent to 30.49 per dollar as of 3:11
p.m. in Bangkok, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The
currency reached 30.44 earlier, the strongest level since June
15.  The onshore one-year interest-rate swap, the fixed cost
needed to receive a floating payment, climbed seven basis points,
or 0.07 percentage point, to 3.19 percent. The yield on the 5.25
percent debt due May 2014 rose six basis points to 3.6 percent,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
