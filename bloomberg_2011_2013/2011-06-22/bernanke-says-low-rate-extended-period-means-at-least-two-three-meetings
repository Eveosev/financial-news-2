Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S.
Bernanke  said the “extended period” of very low interest rates
means at least two to three central bank policy meetings and
could be “significantly longer.”  “The thrust of ‘extended period’ is that we believe we’re
at least two or three meetings away from taking any further
action, and I emphasize ‘at least,’” Bernanke said today at a
press conference in  Washington .  To contact the reporter on this story:
