Shares of the following companies
had unusual moves in Indonesian trading. Stock symbols are in
parentheses, and prices are as of the 4 p.m. Jakarta-time close.  The  Jakarta Composite index (JCI)  advanced 26.89 points, or 0.7
percent, to 3,821.83, the highest close since June 8.  PT Bakrie & Brothers (BNBR IJ), an Indonesian  investment
company , climbed 2.9 percent to 71 rupiah, extending yesterday’s
6.2 percent jump. Bakrie’s television unit, PT Visi Media Asia,
said its initial share sale attracted demand of about five times
more than the amount on offer during the book-building process.  PT Bumi Resources (BUMI IJ),  Indonesia ’s biggest coal
producer, gained 3.2 percent to 3,200 rupiah, extending a 4.2
percent jump yesterday. Bumi and four of its units received $200
million of loans from UBS AG to help fund expansion,  Bisnis
Indonesia  reported, citing Bumi’s first-quarter report and
Director Dileep Srivastava. The loans have a 6 percent interest
rate per year, the newspaper said. Bumi “refinanced an old
loan,” Srivastava said in an e-mailed response to the report.  PT United Tractors (UNTR IJ), the nation’s largest heavy-
equipment seller, rose 1.1 percent to 23,500 rupiah, the highest
close since Jan. 7. United Tractors had its rating raised to
“buy” from “outperform” by Sarina Lesmina, an analyst at
CLSA- Asia  Pacific Markets, saying the company is a “direct
beneficiary of growing demand for coal.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
