Mexico’s peso declined for
the first time this week as Federal Reserve policy makers cut
their forecasts for growth in the  U.S. economy , the biggest
buyer of Mexican exports.  The peso fell 0.1 percent to 11.7945 per dollar at 5 p.m.
New York time, from 11.7775 yesterday.  The Fed said it will maintain record stimulus beyond the
completion of its $600 billion bond purchase program that ends
this month as unemployment remains above 9 percent and the
economy slows. The recovery remains “frustratingly slow” two
years after the recession ended, Fed Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke 
has said. The U.S. purchases about 80 percent of Mexico’s
exports.  “The focus is on the Fed, and the likelihood that they
will continue to emphasize the need to maintain accommodative
policy,” said Aryam Vazquez, a New York-based economist at
Wells Fargo & Co. “This impacts  Mexico  a little more if we get
a prolonged slowdown in the U.S.”  The yield on Mexico’s 10 percent peso bond due 2024 fell 6
basis points, or 0.06 percentage point, to 7.13 percent,
according to Banco Santander SA. The price of the security rose
0.59 centavo to 124.76 centavos per peso.  Retail sales rose 4.9 percent in April from last year, more
than the median forecast of 2.7 percent gain in a Bloomberg
survey, the national statistics agency said today.  The gain is a “positive start” to the second quarter and
“indicates that consumption remains a strong driving force
behind domestic demand and real GDP growth,” wrote Barclays Plc
analyst Marcelo Salomon in a note to clients today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
