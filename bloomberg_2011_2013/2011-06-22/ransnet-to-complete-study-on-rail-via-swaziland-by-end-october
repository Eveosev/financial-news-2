Transnet SOC Ltd.,  South Africa ’s
state rail operator, will complete by the end of October a study
into building a line through Swaziland to shift general freight
off the  Richards Bay  track and expand capacity for coal.  “The idea is to free up capacity” so producers are able
to ship more of the fuel, Divyesh Kalan, general manager of
group commercial at Johannesburg-based Transnet, told the
Coaltrans conference in the city today.  Most of the commodity delivered to Richards Bay,  Africa ’s
largest coal terminal with an annual capacity of 91 million
metric tons, is carried on Transnet’s railroad to the terminal.  Transnet plans to ship 70 million tons in the year through
March 2012 after carrying about 62 million tons a year earlier,
Kalan said. Capacity will rise to 81 million tons by 2015, he
said. Transnet also plans to boost the number of trains sent to
Maputo port in  Mozambique  to 35 a week from about 30 when the
harbor has capacity, he said.  Richards Bay terminal owners, including  Anglo American Plc (AAL) 
and  BHP Billiton Ltd. (BHP) , raised its capacity last year, hoping to
ship more of the fuel to  India  and other Asian countries, where
demand is rising. Prices of the fuel traded through Richards Bay
gained 30 percent to $118.83 a ton in the past year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
