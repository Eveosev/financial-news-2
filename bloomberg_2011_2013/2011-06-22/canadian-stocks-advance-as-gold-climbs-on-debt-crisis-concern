Canadian stocks fell for the first
time in three days after the U.S. Federal Reserve cut its growth
forecasts and corn, wheat and copper futures dropped.  Bank of Montreal (BMO) , Canada’s fourth-largest lender by assets,
declined 1.5 percent after the Fed lowered its 2011 forecast for
gross domestic product increase by 0.4 percentage points.
 Barrick Gold Corp. (ABX) , the world’s largest producer of the metal,
gained 1.4 percent as gold futures rose for a seventh day.
 Bombardier Inc. (BBD/B) , a maker of trains and airplanes, fell 4.8
percent after rival Airbus SAS won an order for 80 single-aisle
aircraft from Republic Airways Holding Inc.  The Standard & Poor’s/TSX Composite Index slipped 2.76
points, or less than 0.1 percent, to 13,060.56.  “The market’s still pretty edgy,” said  Irwin Michael , a
 money manager  at  ABC Group  of Funds in Toronto, which oversees
about C$1 billion ($1.03 billion). “I don’t know whether people
expected an extension of QE2,” the second round of asset
purchases begun in November.  The stock benchmark rallied 2.1 percent June 20 and
yesterday for the biggest two-day gain in seven months as Greek
Prime Minister  George Papandreou  won support for a Cabinet
shuffle. The S&P/TSX tumbled 10 percent from April 5 to June 17
as world equities retreated on concern a Greek debt default will
derail the global recovery.  The U.S. central bank today cut its 2011 and 2012 economic-
growth forecasts and said it will complete its $600 billion
bond-purchase program this month as scheduled.  Financials Decline  Canada’s four largest banks and three biggest insurers each
fell. BMO dropped 1.5 percent to C$60.20.  Manulife Financial
Corp. (MFC) , North America’s fourth-largest insurer, declined 1.3
percent to C$16.19.  Great-West Lifeco Inc. (GWO) , the country’s
second-biggest insurer, slipped 0.9 percent to C$25.19.  Fertilizer producers retreated as corn and wheat futures
decreased at least 4.2 percent on speculation more-favorable
weather will help crops in the U.S. and Europe.  Potash Corp. of Saskatchewan Inc., the world’s largest
fertilizer producer by market value, lost 2 percent to C$51.34.
 Agrium Inc. (AGU)  decreased 1.7 percent to C$81.46.  Teck Resources Ltd., Canada’s largest base-metals and coal
producer, dropped 2.8 percent to C$44.18 after jumping 5.2
percent yesterday. Copper declined 0.7 percent today in  New York 
after Beijing Antaike Information Development Co., a researcher
owned by the Chinese government, said the country’s copper
imports may plunge 32 percent this year.  Default Insurance  The cost of insuring against default on European government
and bank debt rose today, reflecting concern the confidence vote
does not guarantee the passage of austerity measures in Greece.
The euro fell against 14 of 16 other major currencies.  Gold futures gained 0.5 percent to settle at a seven-week
high.  Barrick increased 1.4 percent to C$43.57.  Goldcorp Inc. (G) ,
the world’s second-largest gold producer by market value,
climbed 2.2 percent to C$48.20.  Eldorado Gold Corp. (ELD) , which mines
in Turkey and Greece, jumped 5.4 percent to C$14.43.  Great Basin
Gold Ltd. (GBG)  soared 10 percent, the most in nine months, to C$2.01.  Bombardier, the world’s third-largest maker of civil
aircraft, lost 4.8 percent to C$6.69 after Republic, the parent
of  Frontier Airlines , agreed to buy the 80 Airbus planes, which
have a combined value of $7 billion at list prices. Republic
ordered 40 CSeries airplanes from Bombardier last year.  Sino-Forest Corp. (TRE) , the forestry company battling a short
seller’s assertion of financial manipulation, rose 51 percent to
C$3 after plunging 27 percent to an eight-year low yesterday.

from June 1 to yesterday after Muddy Waters LLC said its stated
land holdings don’t match city records.  To contact the reporter on this story:
