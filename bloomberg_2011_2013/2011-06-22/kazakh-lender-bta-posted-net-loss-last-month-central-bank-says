BTA Bank, Kazakhstan’s biggest
lender before its nationalization and default two years ago,
posted a net loss in May, the central bank said.  BTA narrowed its loss to 12.4 billion tenge ($85 million)
in the first five months of the year from 65.2 billion tenge
during the same period last year, the Almaty-based central
bank’s financial oversight committee said in a monthly report on
its  website . That compares with a 7.6 billion-tenge loss in the
January to April period this year, according to the regulator  The figures are based on unconsolidated data calculated in
accordance with Kazakh accounting standards. The bank had a
profit of 918 million tenge in the first quarter.  The bank, which defaulted in April 2009, two months after
it was taken over by sovereign wealth fund Samruk-Kazyna, said
yesterday it had enough money to make a 24.3 billion-tenge
interest payment on June 30 after yields on its debt soared. BTA
has 50.7 billion tenge in its accounts and can access 251
billion tenge through repurchase operations with the National
Bank of  Kazakhstan , the lender said.  BTA’s press service didn’t reply immediately to an e-mailed
request for comment.  The following table shows the five-month performance of
Kazakhstan’s six largest lenders, along with 14th-ranked
