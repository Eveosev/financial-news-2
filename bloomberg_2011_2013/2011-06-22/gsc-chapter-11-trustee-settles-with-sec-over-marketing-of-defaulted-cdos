GSC Group Inc.’s federal trustee
reached a settlement with the U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission over the bankrupt investment firm’s marketing of
collateralized debt obligations that defaulted in 2008.  GSC asked a U.S. bankruptcy judge to approve the SEC accord
in a motion filed yesterday in  Manhattan . GSC would pay no
monetary damages.  JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) , under a settlement
announced yesterday, agreed to pay $153.6 million to end an SEC
lawsuit tied to the CDOs.  The settlement centers on an investment managed by GSC
called Squared CDO. GSC failed to “adequately inform”
investors that Magnetar Capital LLC, a hedge fund that had a
role in selecting the portfolio of CDOs, made a bet valued at
$600 million that the securities would decline in price, the SEC
said. The CDOs defaulted in January 2008 and investors lost most
of their money, according to court papers.  A hearing to approve the settlement is set for July 13.
Black Diamond Capital Management LLC has agreed to buy GSC’s
assets.  The case is In re GSC Group Inc., 10-14653,  U.S. Bankruptcy
Court , Southern District of  New York  (Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
