India ’s rupee depreciated on
speculation oil importers will buy dollars after crude prices
climbed a third day.  Oil has risen 0.7 percent this week, following a decline of
more than 6 percent last week, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. Overseas investors sold a net 5.51 billion rupees
($122.7 million) of Indian stocks yesterday, taking their total
withdrawals from equities this year to 21.5 billion rupees, the
nation’s markets regulator said today. Slowing economic growth
due to increases in borrowing costs is probably deterring
foreign investors, said Vikas Babu, a currency trader at  Andhra
Bank .  “Refining companies continue to buy dollars,” said
Mumbai-based Babu. “The bias for the rupee in the coming day
will be on the weaker side with higher  interest rates  eroding
profitability, making it a less attractive destination.”  The rupee weakened 0.1 percent to 44.8950 per dollar as of
5 p.m. in Mumbai, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The
currency may trade between 44.50 and 45.30 until the end of this
month, Babu predicted.  Gross domestic product rose 7.8 percent in the three months
ended March 31 from a year earlier, the slowest pace in five
quarters, government data show. The central bank has boosted
interest rates ten times since the start of 2010. The repurchase
rate was last increased on June 16 and is 7.5 percent.  Offshore forwards indicate the rupee will trade at 45.42 in
three months, compared with yesterday’s expectations for 45.47.
