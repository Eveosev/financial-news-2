Dublin residential property prices
rose 0.4 percent in May from April, the first time values have
gained in more than three years as Ireland endured the worst
housing slump in its history.  Prices of houses and apartments in the Irish capital fell
11.5 percent in May from a year earlier, the  Central Statistics
Office  in Cork said.  “Care should be taken when interpreting individual monthly
figures,” the CSO said on its website today. The numbers may
“indicate short-term volatility rather than underlying change
in longer-term price trends.”  Nationwide, house prices fell 1.2 percent in May from April
as Ireland’s economy grapples with the fallout from the bursting
of a decade-long real-estate bubble. The economy has shrunk
about 15 percent since 2007 and the government has pledged 46
billion euros ($66 billion) to rescue the debt-laden financial
system amid property loan losses.  “We still expect the national property index to contract
on the back of tight credit conditions, slack employment,
increasing  interest rates  and lack of mobility,” said Brian Devine, an economist at NCB Stockbrokers in Dublin. “We would
still expect that  house prices  will continue downward in Dublin,
albeit for a shorter period than for apartments.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
