Bangladesh ’s poverty level fell to
31.5 percent in 2010 from 40 percent five years earlier because
of social welfare programs and remittances from abroad,
according to a report by the government and the World Bank.  Rural poverty declined to 35.2 percent in 2010 from 43.8
percent in 2005, while urban poverty fell to 21.3 percent from
28.4 percent, the Household Income and Expenditure Survey by the
government’s statistical agency and the World Bank showed.  Bangladesh’s central bank raised its policy rates on June
14 by half a percentage point to slow the fastest pace of
inflation in  South Asia  after Pakistan. Accelerating inflation
could stymie the government’s plan to boost economic growth to a
record 8 percent in the South Asian nation.  The  World Bank  estimates more than half of the nation’s 166
million people live on less than $1.25 a day and don’t have
access to electricity.  To contact the reporter on this story:
