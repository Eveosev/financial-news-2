The pound extended its decline
against the dollar and the euro after minutes of the Bank of
England’s last meeting showed policy makers voted 7-2 to keep
 interest rates  on hold.  The British currency fell to the weakest in almost two
weeks against the euro after some policy makers said more asset
purchases may be needed.  The pound was 0.5 percent weaker at $1.6162 and 89.13 pence
per euro as of 9:34 a.m. in London.  Chief Economist Spencer Dale and Martin Weale continued a
push for a quarter-point increase in the benchmark rate.
Governor  Mervyn King  and the other six members of the Monetary
Policy Committee, including Ben Broadbent, voted for no change.
Adam Posen kept up a call for more bond purchases.  The majority said the “current weakness of demand growth
was likely to persist for longer than previously thought,”
according to minutes of the June 8-9 meeting published today in
 London . “Moreover, the fiscal challenges in the euro-area
periphery highlighted the potential for further adverse shocks
to demand. For some of these members, it was possible that
further asset purchases might become warranted if the downside
risks to medium-term inflation materialized.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
