Botswana’s Cabinet will debate a 500
million pula ($77 million)  credit line  for  Zimbabwe  today, three
months after it was agreed with the neighboring country, said an
official at the Ministry of Finance and Development Planning.  It is unclear when the funds will be released though as
Zimbabwe’s parliament still has to endorse the credit facility,
said Kelapile Ndobano, secretary for macro-economic planning at
the ministry.  “We don’t know whether they have put it up as part of the
agenda of their parliament,” Ndobano told the annual meeting of
the Botswana Confederation of Commerce, Industry and Manpower
today in the capital, Gaborone.  To contact the reporter on this story:
