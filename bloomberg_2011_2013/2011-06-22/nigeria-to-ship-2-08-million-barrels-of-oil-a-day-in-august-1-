Nigeria, the largest oil producer in
 Africa , is scheduled to export 2.08 million barrels a day of 14
major crude grades in August, little changed from July,
according to loading plans obtained by Bloomberg News.  The country will ship 71 consignments in August totaling
64.6 million barrels, or 2.08 million barrels a day. This
compares with next monthâ€™s plan to export 70 cargoes with a
daily volume of 2.07 million barrels a day.  Nigeria will ship 12 cargoes of Qua Iboe, nine Bonny Light,
nine Agbami, eight Forcados, six Bonga, five Erha, five
Escravos, four Brass River, four Akpo, three Amenam, three Yoho,
two Okwori and one Antan in August, according to the programs.
Cargo sizes range from 300,000 barrels to 1 million barrels.
 Nigeria  will not load Oso condensate, or light crude, in August.  Loading programs are monthly schedules of crude shipments
compiled by field operators to allow buyers and sellers to plan
their supply and trading activities.  To contact the reporter on this story:
