Markus Pinger, head of brands of
 Beiersdorf AG (BEI) , will become  Celesio AG (CLS1) ’s chief executive officer
if the supervisory boards of both German companies agree on the
transfer, according to two people familiar with the talks.  An announcement will probably be made tomorrow at about
noon local time in  Germany , the people said. They declined to be
identified as the talks are private.  Celesio,  Europe ’s biggest drug wholesaler, rose the most in
four months in Frankfurt trading after Manager Magazin, citing
unidentified people familiar with the discussions, reported the
Stuttgart-based company had chosen Pinger to replace Fritz Oesterle, who steps down this month.  Rolf Lange, a spokesman for Hamburg-based Beiersdorf, and
Jens Schreiber, a spokesman for Celesio, declined to comment.  Celesio gained as much as 4.7 percent to 13.36 euros and
was up 4.2 percent as of 4:49 p.m. That pared the stock’s
decline this year to 28 percent. Beiersdorf, the maker of Nivea
skin creams and Tesa adhesives, rose as much as 0.7 percent to
44.65 euros and was up 0.6 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
