Kenya , East Africa’s biggest
economy, cut a sale of bonds to 47 percent of the amount bid
after inflation at a 25-month high sent yields up as much as 4.8
percentage points compared with the last auction.  The Central Bank of Kenya accepted 9 billion shillings ($99
million) of bids for 2-, 5-, and 20-year debt on offer, it said
in an e-mailed statement from Nairobi yesterday. It received 19
billion shillings of bids.  The bank accepted fewer bids with “the objective of
seeking to minimize the cost of contracting debt,” it said.  Yields in Kenya, the world’s largest exporter of black tea,
are soaring and the shilling has weakened to a 17-year low as
the country grapples with a fourfold increase in inflation since
October.  For the reopened 6.671 percent five-year notes, the yield
climbed to 12.529 percent. That compares with 7.636 percent at
the auction of similar-maturity debt held on Jan. 26.  The yield on the re-opened 10 percent 20-year debt
increased to 14.822 percent today from 13.974 percent at the
auction held on May 25, with 861.1 million shillings allocated.
Investors bid for 4.73 billion shillings of the bonds.  The yield on the re-opened 7.439 percent two-year debt rose
to 12.442 percent compared with 10.387 percent at the auction
held on May 25. The bank allocated 6.7 billion shillings.  Market Tightening  The  central bank  kept three-month borrowing costs from
rising above a nine-year high at its auction last week compared
with the previous week’s sale by limiting issuance to the lowest
in at least three months. The bank accepted 49 percent of the
13.7 billion shillings of bids at its June 16 auction. The yield
fell one basis point from the previous sale to 9.006 percent,
the bank’s data show.  “The recent trend of rising yields is being reflected on
the long-term securities, with investors seeking to get higher
returns especially at a time when the money market is
tightening,” Karanja Ndung’u, a fixed-income dealer at Nairobi-
based Tsavo Securities Ltd., said by phone today.  The inflation rate in East Africa’s biggest economy jumped
to 13 percent in May. Price growth is expected to advance
further this year as dry weather curbs agricultural production,
central bank Governor Njuguna Ndung’u said on June 6.  Kenya is feeling the effects of rising global commodity
prices as a drought forces the country to import more food than
it exports, according to Peter Kegode, a Nairobi-based
independent economist who advises agricultural associations.  Rate, Shilling  Kenya’s monetary policy committee raised the benchmark
interest rate by a quarter percentage point to 6.25 percent and
the  cash reserve ratio  by a quarter of a percentage point to
4.75 percent, the central bank said on May 31.  Kenya’s government plans to borrow 119 billion shillings on
the domestic market in the fiscal year through June 2012,
Finance Minister  Uhuru Kenyatta  said in his annual budget speech
on June 8.  The shilling appreciated for a second day, gaining 0.5
percent to 90.4 per dollar by 11:02 a.m. in Nairobi.  Ndung’u will address a media briefing today about
developments in the foreign-exchange market, said Samson Burgei,
head of communications at the bank. The press conference will
start at 3 p.m. in Nairobi, the capital, Burgei said by phone.  To contact the reporter on this story:
