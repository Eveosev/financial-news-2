Shareholders of  Cyfrowy Polsat SA (CPS) 
may complete the sale of 86.1 million shares in  Poland ’s second-
largest television network today, the PAP newswire reported late
yesterday, citing unnamed fund managers.  Zygmunt Solorz-Zak and Heronim Ruta are selling Cyfrowy in
a process of so-called accelerated bookbuilding, Warsaw-based
Cyfrowy said in a regulatory statement yesterday, without giving
the timing of the sale.   To contact the editor responsible for this story:
