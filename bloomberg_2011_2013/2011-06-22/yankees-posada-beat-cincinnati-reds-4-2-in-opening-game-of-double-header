The  New York Yankees  beat the
Cincinnati Reds 4-2 in the first game of a double-header as
 Jorge Posada ’s two-run home run in the sixth inning snapped a 2-
2 tie at Great American Ball Park.  Posada started at first base in place of  Mark Teixeira  for
the opener and hit his first home run since April 23.  Freddy Garcia allowed two runs -- neither earned -- over
seven innings to improve his record to 6-6 this season. David
Robertson pitched a scoreless eighth inning and Mariano Rivera
closed out the Reds in the ninth for his 19th save.  Nick Swisher and Robinson Cano drove in the first two runs
for the Yankees (43-29), who are 10-2 since getting swept in a
three-game series at home by the  Boston Red Sox . They’re a
season-high 14 games over .500 and trail first-place Boston by a
half-game in the American League Eastern Division.  The Yankees and Reds are playing a double-header today
because yesterday’s Major League Baseball game was postponed by
rain in Cincinnati. Brian Gordon is the Yankees’ starting
pitcher in today’s second game against the Reds’ Johnny Cueto.  To contact the reporter on this story:
