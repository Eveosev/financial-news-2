OAO Gazprom will agree to lower the
price Ukraine pays for natural-gas deliveries from  Russia  if
Gazprom and state-controlled NAK Naftogaz Ukrainy merge,
 Kommersant-Ukraine  reported, citing unidentified officials in
Ukraine’s Energy and Coal Ministry and Gazprom.  Another possible condition for lowering the price is a
joint venture on the basis of Ukraine’s gas pipelines, the
