The  World Bank  will consider lending
Cameroon 13 billion CFA francs ($28.5 million) at a board
meeting tomorrow to help the West African nation fund its sewage
disposal program, the  Cameroon Tribune  reported.  The loan would also help Cameroon fund agriculture,
infrastructure and professional training projects, the Yaounde-
based newspaper said, citing Gregor Binkert, the World Bank’s
director of operations for Cameroon, Gabon,  Equatorial Guinea 
and the Central African Republic.  To contact the reporter on this story:
