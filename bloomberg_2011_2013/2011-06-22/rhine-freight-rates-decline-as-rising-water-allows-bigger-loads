The cost of shipping oil products on
the Rhine River fell as water levels rose, allowing barges to
carry increased volumes.  The cost of transporting gasoil to Duisburg in  Germany  from
Rotterdam or Amsterdam dropped to 5.50 euros ($7.93) a metric
ton yesterday from 6.75 euros on June 20, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. Gasoil is used in heating.  “Part of the reason is higher water levels and better
loading especially for upper Rhine destinations,” Pieter Kulsen, founder of PJK International BV, said today by phone
from Oosterhout,  Netherlands . “The other reason is that there’s
less demand for heating oil.”  The barge clearance level at Cologne, south of Duisburg,
rose to 197 centimeters (77.6 inches) on June 20 from 171
centimeters on June 17, according to German government data
available on Bloomberg. Clearance levels mark the depth at which
a barge can travel without the risk of running aground.  To contact the reporter on this story:
