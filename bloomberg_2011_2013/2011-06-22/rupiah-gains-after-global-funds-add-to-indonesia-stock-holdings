Indonesia ’s rupiah strengthened for
a second day after global funds added to holdings of the
nation’s assets to benefit from growth in  Southeast Asia ’s
biggest economy.  Overseas investors bought $41.7 million more Indonesian
shares than they sold yesterday, boosting net purchases for the
year to $1.9 billion, according to exchange data. The MSCI Asia-
Pacific Index of regional stocks gained for a second day after
Greek Prime Minister  George Papandreou  won a confidence vote,
spurring optimism the country won’t default on its debt.  “The confidence vote helped risk appetite, that’s why we
are seeing some positive reaction in the market, including the
rupiah,” said  Gundy Cahyadi , a Singapore-based economist at
Oversea-Chinese Banking Corp. “The market is still quite choppy
and very sensitive to developments coming from  Greece . Caution
is still the word.”  The rupiah appreciated 0.2 percent to 8,593 per dollar as
of 3:40 a.m. in Jakarta, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Indonesia’s economy may expand in the “upper end” of a
range of 6 percent to 6.5 percent in 2011, the central bank said
on June 9. Gross domestic product rose 6.1 percent last year.  The government’s 10-year bonds rose, halting four days of
losses. The yield on the 8.25 percent notes due July 2021 fell
nine basis points, or 0.09 percentage point, to 7.61 percent,
according to the Inter-Dealer Market Association.  Overseas funds  boosted  holdings of Indonesian bonds by 5
percent to 236.5 trillion rupiah ($27.5 billion) this month
through June 20, according to figures from the debt-management
office.  To contact the reporter on this story:
