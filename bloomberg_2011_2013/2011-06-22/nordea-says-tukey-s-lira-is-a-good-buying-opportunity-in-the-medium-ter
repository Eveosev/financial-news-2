The lira is a “good buying
opportunity” for investors on “a medium to long-term
perspective” on prospects for a rate increase, said  Elisabeth Andreew , chief analyst at Nordea AB in Copenhagen.  Nordea “recommends forwards for hedging lira expenses,”
Andreew said in an e-mailed report to investors today.
“Revenues could be hedged by zero-cost strategies such as
participating forwards, so as to be able to participate in a
strengthening of the lira.”  The lira gained 0.2 percent to 1.6095 per dollar at 9:47
p.m., rising for the second day.  The central bank may increase  interest rates  from a record
low of 6.25 percent next month, she said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
