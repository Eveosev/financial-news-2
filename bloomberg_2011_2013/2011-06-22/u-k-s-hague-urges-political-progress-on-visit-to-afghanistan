U.K. Foreign Secretary  William Hague 
urged Afghanistan’s leaders to make progress on political
reconciliation and fighting corruption as he visited Kabul and
Helmand Province, where most of the British troops in the
country are stationed.  Britain, the second-largest contributor of foreign forces
to the country after the U.S., is due to withdraw all its 9,500
troops by 2015. Hague was accompanied by United Arab Emirates
Foreign Minister Sheikh Abdullah bin Zayed Al Nahyan. They met
Afghan President  Hamid Karzai  and Foreign Minister Zalmai
Rassoul.  The UAE also has forces in Helmand, in the south of the
country. While there, the ministers visited the security command
center in the city of Lashkar Gah.  “It has been good to see positive changes in places like
Lashkar Gah, as well as discernible economic progress being made
across the country,” Hague said in an e-mailed statement. “Now
there is more to do in the areas of security and reconciliation,
in building up economic success and fighting corruption.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
