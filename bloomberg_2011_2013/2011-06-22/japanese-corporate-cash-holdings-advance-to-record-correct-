(Corrects household asset figure in sixth paragraph of
story published June 17.)  Japanese companies’ cash holdings
reached the highest level in more than 30 years last quarter
after a record earthquake encouraged them to hoard liquid assets,
Bank of  Japan  data show.  Cash and deposits held by companies rose 7.1 percent to
211.1 trillion yen ($2.62 trillion), the highest since the data
were made available in 1979. The amount of their liquid deposits
also increased to an unprecedented 123.3 trillion yen.  “The surge in cash shows that companies were on very high
alert after the earthquake,” said Shuji Kobayakawa, director of
economic data division at the central bank in  Tokyo . “They
don’t want to experience a fund shortage again” like they did
in the aftermath of the 2008 collapse of Lehman Brothers
Holdings Inc., he said.  Toyota Motor Corp. said last week its profits will fall
almost a third this year as the March 11 temblor disrupted
production and electricity supply. Japanese machinery orders
fell for the first time in four months in April and economists
predict a report next week will show exports slumped for a third
month, the latest evidence of weakening demand.  Cash holdings of households rose 1.5 percent to 816.4
trillion yen from a year earlier, near the previous quarter’s
record 820.7 trillion yen, today’s report showed.  Japanese household assets fell 0.5 percent to 1,476.4
trillion yen after the earthquake spurred the biggest stock
decline in 10 months. The benchmark  Nikkei 225 (NKY)  Stock Average
fell 8 percent from a year earlier in March, the largest drop
since May 2010.  To contact the reporter on this story:
