Citadel Capital SAE rose for the
first time in three days after its main shareholder, Citadel
Capital Partners Ltd., started negotiations on a possible sale
of a stake in the Egyptian private-equity firm.  The shares of the firm with $4 billion in assets under
management gained 1.5 percent to 6.07 Egyptian pounds at 11:55
a.m. in Cairo, giving the company a market value of 4.02 billion
pounds ($675 million). The stock earlier gained as much as 5
percent. The benchmark  EGX 30 Index (EGX30)  fell 0.4 percent.  “Early-stage, verbal talks have started with more than one
potential strategic investor regarding the possible sale of
Citadel Capital Partners’ shares in Citadel Capital SAE as well
as the balance of the firm’s shares,” Citadel Capital said in a
 statement posted on its website  today.  Abraaj Capital Ltd., the Dubai-based private-equity company
managing about $6.2 billion, may hire  Morgan Stanley (MS)  as an
adviser on a planned acquisition of a stake in Citadel Capital,
two people familiar with the matter said June 16. Citadel
Partners may hire Citigroup Inc. to advise on the possible sale,
the two people said, speaking on condition of anonymity because
the talks are private.  To contact the reporter on this story:
