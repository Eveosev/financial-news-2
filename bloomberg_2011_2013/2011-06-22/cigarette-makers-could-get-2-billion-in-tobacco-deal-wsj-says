Altria Group Inc. (MO) ’s  Philip Morris
USA  and other companies involved in a 1998 tobacco settlement
have reached a tentative deal with state attorneys general that
may allow them to recover $2 billion, the Wall Street Journal
reported, citing people familiar with the matter it didn’t name.  The tentative accord with officials for 46 states would
resolve a dispute over payments required under the master
settlement agreement, the newspaper said.  The deal would allow the companies to keep a portion of the
money they haven’t paid states or have disputed under the
accord, in which they agreed to pay more than $200 billion to
states for the cost of treating sick smokers, the Journal said.  States and the companies have disagreed over $7.1 billion
that the companies say they shouldn’t have to pay on sales from
2003 to 2010, the paper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
