Sonangol Holdings ,  Angola ’s state
oil company, is in talks with banks for a $1 billion ten-year
syndicated loan, according to a person with knowledge of the
situation.  Credit Agricole CIB and Standard Chartered Plc are
arranging the  term loan , which will pay initial interest of 325
basis points more than the London interbank offered rate, said
the person, who declined to be identified because the
transaction is private.  Joao Rosa Santos, a spokesman for Luanda-based Sonangol,
didn’t immediately respond to a phone call and e-mail seeking
comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
