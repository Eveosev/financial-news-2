Allianz SE (ALV) , Europe’s biggest
insurer, needs to improve the returns at its fund-management
divisions, management board member Joachim Faber told
 Handelsblatt  in an interview.  “We need more products for equities, bonds and commodities
that aim for a positive return instead of only outperforming a
benchmark,” Faber told the newspaper.  Allianz’s asset-management unit, which includes  Newport
Beach , California-based  Pacific Investment Management Co. , won’t
sell RCM Capital Management as it considers the unit a main part
of the business, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
