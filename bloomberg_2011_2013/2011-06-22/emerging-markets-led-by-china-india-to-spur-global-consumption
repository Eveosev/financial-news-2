Emerging markets will replace
developed economies as the main drivers of global consumption,
with more than half the growth coming from  China  and India in
five years, Boston Consulting Group Inc. said today.  Spending by Chinese consumers is expected to more than
double and account for 22 percent of the global total by 2020,
the consulting firm  said in a report . The slice of global
discretionary spending by U.S. consumers may fall to 35 percent
from 40 percent now, according to the report.  “The economic downturn hurt both the willingness and the
ability of many consumers in the developed economies to spend,”
the report’s authors Catherine Roche, Patrick Ducasse and Carol
Liao wrote.  Attitudes toward spending are more buoyant in emerging
markets including Brazil, China, Indonesia, Mexico, Russia,
 South Africa  and Turkey, reflecting consumers’ outlook on the
economy.  Thirty-six percent of Chinese consumers surveyed said they
plan to increase discretionary spending in the next 12 months,
compared with 19 percent in  India , 11 percent in the U.S. and 8
percent in Europe, according to the report.  The report was based on a survey conducted in March and
April of about 24,000 consumers in 21 countries.  --Stephanie Wong and  Michael Wei . Editors: Nicholas Wadhams,
