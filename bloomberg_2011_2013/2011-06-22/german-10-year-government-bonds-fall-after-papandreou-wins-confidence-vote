German  government bonds  fell as
Greek Prime Minister  George Papandreou  won a confidence vote,
paving the way for the country to implement austerity measures
needed to receive aid, damping demand for the safest assets.  The losses pushed the 10-year bund yield up to the highest
in a week. Papandreou reshuffled his cabinet and sought the
approval of parliament after fending off a revolt within his
socialist Pasok party last week.  Germany  is scheduled to sell 4
billion euros ($5.8 billion) of 10-year bonds today. The MSCI
Asia Pacific Index rose for a second day, gaining 1 percent.
Futures on the Euro Stoxx 50 were little changed.  The 10-year bund yield was little changed at 2.99 percent
as of 7:40 a.m. in  London . It reached 2.91 percent on June 16,
the lowest level since Jan. 11. The 3.25 percent security due
July 2021 fell 0.120, or 1.20 euros per 1,000-euro face amount,
to 102.18. Yields on two-year notes gained one basis point to
1.54 percent after reaching 1.53 percent. They dropped to 1.43
percent last week, the least since Feb. 22.  German government bonds have returned 0.2 percent this
year, according to indexes compiled by the European Federation
of Financial Analysts Societies and Bloomberg, while Treasuries
gained 3.2 percent. Greek securities lost 19 percent, the
indexes show.  To contact the reporters on this story:
