Publicly held federal debt will
reach roughly 70 percent of the nation’s gross domestic product
by the end of this year, the highest since just after World War
II, according to the  Congressional Budget Office .  It’s likely to go past 100 percent by 2021 if lawmakers
don’t change current policy, the agency said in a report
updating its long-term budget outlook. The debt will approach
190 percent by 2035, dwarfing the 109 percent set during World
War II, the report said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
