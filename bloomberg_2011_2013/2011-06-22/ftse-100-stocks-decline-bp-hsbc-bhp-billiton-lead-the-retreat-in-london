U.K. stocks fell after the biggest
rally for the benchmark FTSE 100 Index in two months yesterday.  Glencore International Plc paced declining shares after the
company failed to sell $1 billion of shares in the so-called
over-allotment option for last month’s initial public offer.
Xstrata Plc led mining companies lower. Man Group Plc rallied
4.1 percent amid speculation that the hedge fund will be a bid
target and as analysts recommended the stock.  The FTSE 100 slid 27.71, or 0.5 percent, to 5,747.6 at
10:56 a.m. in  London , paring some of yesterday’s 1.4 percent
advance.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
