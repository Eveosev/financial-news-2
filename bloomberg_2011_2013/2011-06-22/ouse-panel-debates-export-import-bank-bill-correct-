The House Financial Services
Committee approved a measure to reauthorize the U.S. Export-
Import Bank and increase its cap on financing.  The House panel approved the measure by a voice vote, which
will increase the cap over the next three years to $160 billion
on the lenderâ€™s loans, guarantees and insurance. Record lending
by the bank since the financial crisis of 2008 has pushed its
outstanding financing level close to the current limit of $100
billion.  The measure also instructs the government-backed lender to
reevaluate its requirement that 85 percent of the content in
goods receiving financial support be made in the U.S. Changing
that policy is a priority of companies such  Boeing Co. (BA)  and
 General Electric Co. (GE)   The Export-Import Bank helps exporters get credit for
foreign sales by providing direct loans or guarantees to banks
that will be repaid. Chicago-based Boeing is the largest
recipient of financing from the bank, with more than $5.5
billion last year. The lender provided a record $24.5 billion in
financing last year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
