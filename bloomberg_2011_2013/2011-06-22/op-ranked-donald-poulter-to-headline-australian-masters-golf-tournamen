The Australian Masters, which had
been left without a slot on the golf calendar following a
disagreement over dates, will take place the week before
Christmas and feature world No. 1 Luke Donald.  The Masters, which  Tiger Woods  played the past two years
and won in 2009 for his last tournament victory, will return to
 Victoria Golf Club  in Melbourne from Dec. 15-18, event owner
 International Management Group  said today.  “There’s been a fair bit of work behind the scenes to get
us to this point,” David Rollo, director of golf at IMG
 Australia , said at a news conference. “Part of the reason we’ve
not said anything before now about where we’re at is we were
trying to join all the dots.”  IMG declined the Dec. 1-4 slot it was offered by the  PGA
Tour of Australasia , which granted the dates on either side of
the Nov. 17-20  Presidents Cup  at Royal Melbourne to the
Australian Open and Australian PGA Championship. The Masters had
occupied the second weekend in November the past two years.  Donald, who has never played in Australia, will be joined
in the field by fellow Englishman  Ian Poulter , ranked  14  on the
 Official World Golf Ranking , and defending champion Stuart Appleby of Australia, IMG said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
