Murban crude oil fell to the deepest
discount against its benchmark since 2009 as processing profits
declined and on concerns that too much supply is available in
the market.  Abu Dhabi National Oil Co.’s Murban for August loading
dropped 15 cents to a discount of 40 cents a barrel to its
official selling price, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
That’s the biggest gap since July 2009 when the discount reached
98 cents. Qatar Land declined 15 cents to 50 cents below its
official level, its largest discount since August 2009,
Bloomberg data showed.  Refiners are hesitant to purchase more crude as their
processing profits are declining. Gasoil’s premium to Dubai
crude, a measure of profitability, dropped 71 cents to $17.84 a
barrel, the lowest since May 30, according to data from London-
based brokers PVM Oil Associates Ltd. At the same time,  Saudi
Arabia , the world’s biggest oil exporter, was said to have sold
additional crude cargoes to refiners, limiting demand for Qatar
and Abu Dhabi grades sold on the so-called spot market money.  Oman crude for immediate loading dropped 88 cents, or 0.8
percent, to $106.60 barrel, according to Bloomberg data. Dubai
oil for delivery in August fell 0.8 percent to $106.03. Murban
decreased 0.9 percent to $110.60.  Oman futures for August delivery retreated 29 cents to
$105.34 a barrel on the  Dubai Mercantile Exchange  at 5:51 p.m.
Singapore time, with 696 contracts traded. The settlement price
was at $105.97 at 12:30 p.m. in Dubai.  The August Brent-Dubai exchange for swaps, which measures
the European marker versus the Persian Gulf grade, widened 14
cents to $6.28 a barrel, according to data from PVM. The
exchange for swaps for September rose 15 cents to $5.90.  To contact the reporter on this story:
