A debate on nationalizing mines in
 South Africa , the nation with the largest mineral reserves, is
“useful,” said Bridgette Radebe, chairman of Mmakau Mining.  “Don’t be averse to debating what the majority of the
people are asking to talk about,” Radebe, wife of Justice
Minister  Jeff Radebe , said at the Coaltrans conference in
Johannesburg today. If South Africa fails to address economic
imbalances, “you’re going to have a situation like  Zimbabwe ,”
she said.  The ruling  African National Congress  agreed in September to
study nationalization, responding to a call by  Julius Malema ,
leader of the party’s youth arm. Northern neighbor Zimbabwe this
year said foreign mining companies and banks should transfer
control to local entities.  South Africa has the most mineral wealth in the world,
according to a Citigroup AG note in April last year. The country
has $2.5 trillion of in-situ reserve value, the firm said,
adding it used countries’ non-energy reserve data and the firm’s
own long-term commodity price assumptions to assess the relative
“commodity wealth” of countries.  To contact the reporter on this story:
