PT Bumi Resources,  Asia ’s biggest
thermal-coal exporter, reported a 15 percent drop in first-
quarter net income under a new accounting standard adopted by
 Indonesia  this year as costs and tax charges increased.  Profit “attributable to owners of the parent” declined to
$112 million from a restated $132 million a year earlier,
Jakarta-based Bumi said in an earnings statement posted on its
website. That’s about 23 percent of a mean estimate for this
year’s net income of $494.4 million, according to a Bloomberg
survey of 18 analysts.  Revenue in the three months ended March 31 rose to $850
million from $703 million a year earlier, according to the
statement. Cost of goods sold climbed to $531.8 million from
$468.8 million, while tax payments doubled to $126.8 million
from $63.2 million, Bumi said in the statement.  Bumi’s net income in the period rose 16.5 percent to $113
million from a year ago, Director Dileep Srivastava said June 17.
Revenue gained to $1.23 billion from $1.02 billion, Srivastava
said at the time.  Bumi expects sales and prices to increase at least 10
percent this year, assuming reasonable weather conditions,
Srivastava said Jan. 21. The unit of PT Bakrie & Brothers sold a
“little over” 60 million tons of coal last year at an average
$70 a ton compared with 58 million tons at $63 a ton in 2009.  Bumi rose 3.2 percent to 3,200 rupiah a share as of 2:03
p.m. in Jakarta trading today. The stock has risen about 6
percent this year compared with a 3 percent gain in the
benchmark  Jakarta Composite Index. (JCI)   To contact the reporter on this story:
