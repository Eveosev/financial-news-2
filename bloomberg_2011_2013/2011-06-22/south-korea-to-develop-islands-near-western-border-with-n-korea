South Korea  plans to spend 910.9
billion won ($848 million) to develop five islands near the
western sea border with North Korea, including the one shelled
by Kim Jong Il’s military last year.  The 10-year project is aimed boosting security and
improving living conditions on the islands, Prime Minister Kim Hwang Sik’s office said today in a statement on its website.
North Korea lobbed artillery shells onto Yeonpyeong Island in
November, killing four people including two civilians.  The government will also seek private funds for the project,
which involves providing more frequent medical services for
residents on the islands and renovating their houses, the
statement said. The plan will also help develop the area into a
tourist zone, it said.  North Korea  doesn’t recognize the western maritime border,
demarcated by the United Nations after the 1950-53 Korean War.
The five islands are within 12 miles of the North Korean
mainland. The two Koreas remain technically at war since the
conflict ended in a cease-fire.  To contact the reporter on this story:
