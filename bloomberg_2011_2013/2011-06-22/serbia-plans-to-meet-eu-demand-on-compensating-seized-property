(Corrects name in third paragraph.)  Serbia  plans to compensate those
whose property was seized during the Communist era as it tries
to fulfill conditions for joining the European Union.  A “sustainable solution” for thousands of people who have
demanded restitution since the fall of communism in 1990 will be
adopted by early October, the office of Deputy Premier Bozidar Djelic said in e-mailed statement today.  Claimants have asked for their property to be returned
whenever possible and estimated that other forms of compensation
would cost the state some 3 billion euros ($4.3 billion),
according to Milan Parivodic, a restitution activist and former
minister for foreign economic relations. EU’s Commission has
urged Serbia to resolve the issue after ownership disputes rose
when the government offered the property to investors.  Restitution is “the most difficult task” for the
government in the coming months, Premier  Mirko Cvetkovic  told
Vecernje Novosti newspaper today. “It has to satisfy the
interests of those whose property was seized without
jeopardizing the future of coming generations. We don’t have a
political problem” with that, we “just need to find the best
way.”  Once part of Communist-era Yugoslavia, Serbia has returned
some confiscated property to religious communities and compiled
claims from individuals in 2007 to estimate the cost of full-
scale restitution. No estimate has been released after more than
30,000 people filed 73,000 claims.  To contact the reporter on this story:
