China will invest 400 billion yuan
($62 billion) in the construction of four hydroelectric dams on
a tributary of the Yangtze river to help boost the share of non-
fossil fuels in the energy consumed by the nation, the  China
Daily  reported today, citing Han Wenke, director of the Energy
Research Center at the National Development and Reform
Commission.  Total installed capacity of the four dams on the Jinsha
river will be 43 million kilowatts, the newspaper reported. They
