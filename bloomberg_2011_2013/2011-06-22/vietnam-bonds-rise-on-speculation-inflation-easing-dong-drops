Vietnam ’s bonds rose, pushing yields
to near a seven-week low, on speculation inflation is easing.
The dong weakened.  The  consumer price index  will rise 1.2 percent to 1.4
percent in June from the month before, Thoi Bao Kinh Te Vietnam
newspaper reported yesterday, citing Nguyen Tien Thoa, head of
price control at the Ministry of Finance. Prices increased 2.2
percent in May from April. The State Treasury sold five-year
bonds to yield 12.30 percent on June 16, lower than a yield of
12.65 percent at the previous auction on June 9, according to
the  Hanoi Stock Exchange .  Lower yields in the primary market indicate “demand for
bonds is increasing again, given an expectation of inflation
easing,” Luu Hai Yen, a Hanoi-based analyst at Thang Long
Securities Joint-Stock Co., wrote in a research note released
yesterday. “Abundant liquidity at banks and a prediction that
 interest rates  will fall caused many lenders to buy bonds.”  The yield on the benchmark five-year note dropped three
basis points, or 0.03 percentage point, to 12.52 percent,
according to a daily fixing from banks compiled by Bloomberg.
The rate reached 12.47 percent on June 20, the lowest level
since April 29.  The treasury will auction 2 trillion dong ($97 million) of
five-year bonds tomorrow, along with 2.5 trillion dong each of
two- and three-year notes, according to the bourse.  The dong dropped 0.4 percent to 20,670 per dollar as of
2:37 p.m. in Hanoi, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The
central bank fixed the  reference rate  at 20,618 today, unchanged
since June 13, according to its website. The currency is allowed
to trade up to 1 percent on either side of the rate.  --Diep Ngoc Pham in Hanoi. Editors: Andrew Janes, Ven Ram  To contact the Bloomberg News staff on this story:
