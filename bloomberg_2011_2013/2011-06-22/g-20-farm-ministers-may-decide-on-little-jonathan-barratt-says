Following are comments from  Jonathan
Barratt , managing director at Commodity Broking Services Pty. in
Sydney, on the outlook for a Group of 20 farm ministers meeting
in Paris today. He spoke to Linzie Janis on Bloomberg
Television’s “First Look.”  “It’s a meeting that’s coming together to collect ideas. I
don’t think we’re going to get a lot of an outcome but I feel
it’s a good chance to be able to focus on what needs to be done
because it is a real problem.”  “From an investor’s perspective it is an interesting step
from two sides. One, we feel that prices will continue to
appreciate and two, we feel that there is this need for more
clarity and more regulation because there are a lot of
speculators who have these positions and who really aren’t
involved in the market.”  “From an investor’s side I think all you need to do is buy
the dip. But from the regulators, I think they’ve got to be a
little bit more transparent in how and why we can get involved
in the market.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
