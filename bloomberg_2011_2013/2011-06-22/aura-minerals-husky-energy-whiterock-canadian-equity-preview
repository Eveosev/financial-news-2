Canadian stocks fell for a second
day after European Central Bank President  Jean-Claude Trichet 
said the continent is at a “red” level of risk and the U.S.
reported an increase in initial jobless claims.  Nexen Inc. (NXY) , an oil and gas producer with operations on five
continents, dropped 2.1 percent as crude futures slumped to a
four-month low.  Toronto-Dominion Bank (TD) ,  Canada ’s second-largest
lender by assets, lost 1.5 percent as world financial stocks
retreated.  Barrick Gold Corp. (ABX) , the world’s biggest gold-mining
company, declined 1.4 percent as the  U.S. dollar  rose against 14
of 16 other major currencies.  The Standard & Poor’s/TSX Composite Index decreased 80.98
points, or 0.6 percent, to 12,979.58. The index had rallied 2.1
percent on June 20 and June 21 on speculation Greece will pass
austerity measures to address its debt crisis.  “You get these momentary distractions, like we’ve figured
out a solution, then the next day you realize, ‘Oh darn, there
isn’t a Santa Claus,’” said Danielle Park, a partner at Venable
Park Investment Counsel Inc. in Barrie, Ontario, which manages
at least C$1 million ($1.02 million) each for more than 250
families. “We’re piled to the outer solar system in debt, and
banks are full of all these bad bonds.”  The stock benchmark fell 7.5 percent this quarter through
yesterday as concern that  Greece  will default on its debts
mounted and data on employment and manufacturing in the U.S.
indicated a slowdown in the economic recovery. The S&P/TSX
hasn’t ended a quarter with a drop of more than 6.2 percent
since 2008.  ‘Red’ Signal  When asked yesterday the level of the European Systemic
Risk Board’s planned risk “dashboard,” board chairman Trichet
said “red.”  “The message of the board is that” the link between debt
problems and banks “is the most serious threat to financial
stability in the European Union,” Trichet said after a board
meeting in  Frankfurt .  First-time unemployment claims in the U.S. climbed to
429,000 last week from 420,000 the week before, the Labor
Department said today in  Washington . None of the 47 economists
in a Bloomberg survey had forecast a reading that high.  The Thomson Reuters/Jefferies CRB Commodity Price Index
declined to the lowest level since January as 16 of 19
commodities in the index retreated. Crude oil sank 4.6 percent
in  New York .  Suncor, Canadian Natural  Nexen lost 2.1 percent to a nine-month low of C$19.89.
 Talisman Energy Inc. (TLM) , an oil and gas producer with operations in
 North America , the  North Sea  and  Indonesia , decreased 2.1
percent to C$18.53.  Husky Energy Inc. (HSE) , Canada’s third-largest energy company by
revenue, plunged 5.7 percent, the most in two years, to C$26.55
after saying it will sell shares at C$27.05 each.  Every S&P/TSX bank and all but one insurer retreated. TD
fell 1.5 percent to C$78.50.  Royal Bank of Canada (RY) , its larger
rival, dropped 1.3 percent to C$53.82.  Manulife Financial Corp. (MFC) ,
North America’s fourth-biggest insurer, declined 1.2 percent to
C$16.  The U.S. dollar gained as much as 1.6 percent against the
euro after  Markit Economics ’s composite index of euro-area
purchasing managers’ surveys trailed all 16 estimates in a
Bloomberg survey.  Gold futures fell the most since May 5, ending a seven-day
streak of gains, and silver slumped 4.7 percent. Barrick dropped
1.4 percent to C$42.98.  Goldcorp Inc. (G) , the world’s second-
largest gold producer, slipped 1.3 percent to C$47.59.  European
Goldfields Ltd. (EGU) , which is developing precious- and base-metal
projects, declined 6.4 percent to C$9.24.  Smartphone Survey  BlackBerry maker  Research In Motion Ltd. (RIM)  increased 5.5
percent to C$29.14. RIM’s smartphones are less likely than
competitors’ to develop hardware problems, WDS, a Poole,
England-based company that tracks customer-support calls, said
in a statement today.  RIM shares remain down 50 percent for the year.  Teck Resources Ltd. (TCK/B) , the country’s biggest base-metals and
coal producer, climbed 3.1 percent to C$45.54. The company said
it may buy back up to 40 million shares over the next year.  TMX Group Inc. (X) , the owner of the Toronto Stock Exchange,
advanced for a fifth day, rallying 2.4 percent to a three-year
high of C$45.30. Maple Group Acquisition Corp. raised its
unsolicited bid for the company to C$50 a share from C$48 a
share.  To contact the reporter on this story:
