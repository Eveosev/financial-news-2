Juventus said it will spend a
combined 37.25 million euros ($53.5 million) to sign four
players currently on loan with the Italian soccer team.  A club statement said it will pay 15.5 million euros to
Cagliari for striker Alessandro Matri and 10.5 million euros to
Napoli for forward Fabio Quagliarella.  Juventus, which wonâ€™t play in the  Champions League  next
season after finishing seventh in Serie A last season, will also
pay Udinese 7.5 million euros for midfielder Simone Pepe and
3.75 million euros for defender Marco Motta.  All the payments will be made over three years, the
statement said.  Juventus last month hired its former midfielder Antonio Conte as coach to replace Luigi Delneri.  To contact the reporters on this story:
