Japan ’s government will separate one
of the country’s nuclear regulators from the Ministry of
Economy, Trade and Industry as early as next year to increase
its independence, trade minister Banri Kaieda said.  Next year “is one possibility,” Kaieda said on June 20 at
a meeting of the  International Atomic Energy Agency  in Vienna to
discuss the Fukushima nuclear disaster, trade ministry spokesman
Hiroaki Wada said today.  The Nuclear and Industry Safety Agency’s lack of
independence from the ministry, which promotes atomic power,
hampered a quick response to the disaster at the Fukushima Dai-
Ichi station, the government said in a report submitted to the
IAEA earlier this month.  The IAEA is holding a ministerial meeting this week to
learn lessons from the March 11 accident, the worst since
Chernobyl in 1986.  Tokyo  Electric Power Co. is trying to bring
three damaged reactors at Fukushima under control using outside
pumps, after cooling systems were knocked out by an earthquake
and tsunami.  To contact the reporter on this story:
