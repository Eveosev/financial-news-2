Namibia ’s central bank left its
benchmark interest rate unchanged to help support a recovery in
economic growth even after the inflation rate rose to a 14-month
high.  The repo rate stayed at 6 percent, Bank of Namibia Governor
Ipumbu Shiimi told reporters today in the capital, Windhoek. The
bank has kept the rate unchanged this year after reducing it at
the last two meetings of 2010 to boost growth.  The decision was to “give the economy breathing space,”
he said. Growth in mining and agriculture may slow and the
central bank will probably cut its forecast for economic
expansion this year from 4.1 percent, Shiimi said.  The economy in Namibia, the world’s biggest miner of
offshore diamonds and the fourth-largest producer of uranium,
grew 4.6 percent last year after contracting the year before,
according to the central bank. Inflation accelerated to 5.2
percent in May, the fastest pace since March last year, the
country’s statistics office said on June 14. The inflation rate
reached a five-year low of 3.1 percent in February.  “Inflation pressures continue to rise, which is a worrying
factor,” Shiimi said. The rate was still within “reasonable
levels,” he said in an interview with CNBC Africa after the
decision.  The decision is in line with neighboring  South Africa ’s
move to keep its benchmark rate at 5.5 percent last month.
Namibia’s currency is pegged to the South African rand and the
central bank generally follows monetary policy set by the South
African Reserve Bank.  To contact the reporter on this story:
