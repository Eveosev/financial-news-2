Shareholders of  Cyfrowy Polsat SA (CPS) 
raised 1.35 billion zloty ($489.7 million) from selling their
stake in Poland’s second-largest television network to finance
investments in telecommunications.  Billionaire Zygmunt Solorz-Zak and Heronim Ruta, who put
up 86.1 million shares for sale, priced the stake in the
Warsaw-based company at 15.7 zloty per share, Cyfrowy said in
a regulatory statement today, confirming an earlier report by
Bloomberg News. The final price in the transaction was set in
the upper part of 15.5 zloty to 15.8 zloty range, at which
sellers were collecting bids earlier.  The shares fell 1.4 percent to 15.85 zloty at 4:44 p.m.
in Warsaw trading today, valuing the company at 5.52 billion
zloty.  Solorz-Zak, the second-wealthiest Pole according to
Forbes magazine, will retain majority stake in Polsat, the
company said in the statement. The billionaire has been chosen
for exclusive talks to buy Polkomtel SA,  Poland ’s second-
largest mobile phone operator, two people familiar with that
sale process said today.  Deutsche Bank AG, Credit Agricole SA and Trigon are
advising on the Cyfrowy Polsat sale. TVN SA is the country’s
biggest TV broadcaster.  To contact the reporter on this story:
