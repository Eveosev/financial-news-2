Sugar fell for the first time in
five sessions on signs that global supplies will outpace
consumption. Coffee dropped, while cocoa rose.  Sugar output will exceed demand by as much as 9 million
metric tons for the year starting in October, up from a surplus
of 1 million tons in the current season, German research company
F.O. Licht said. The cane crop in  Brazil , the world’s top
grower, may have benefited from the rains in the past months,
said  Jonathan Kingsman , managing director of Kingsman SA.  “Talks about improving yields in Brazil and a surplus
scenario are pushing the market down,” said  Jimmy Tintle , an
analyst at Transworld Futures in Tampa,  Florida .  Raw sugar for October delivery fell 0.26 cent, or 1
percent, to settle at 26 cents a pound at 2 p.m. on ICE Futures
U.S. in  New York , the biggest loss for the contract since June
6.  Prices climbed 8.7 percent in the previous four sessions on
concern that shipping delays in Brazil would limit near-term
supplies.  Also on ICE, arabica-coffee futures for September delivery
dropped 0.75 cent, or 0.3 percent, to $2.462 a pound. Cocoa
futures for September delivery climbed $15, or 0.5 percent, to
$3,041 a metric ton.  On NYSE Life in  London , refined-sugar futures for August
delivery dropped 0.5 percent to $739.90 a ton. Robusta-coffee
futures for September delivery fell $44, or 1.9 percent, to
$2,252 a ton, the lowest closing price since Feb. 9.  Cocoa futures for July delivery rose 17 pounds, or 0.9
percent, to 1,884 pounds ($3,032) a ton in London, the highest
settlement since May 11.  To contact the reporters on this story:
