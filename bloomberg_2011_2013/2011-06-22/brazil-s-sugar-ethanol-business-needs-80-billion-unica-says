Brazil ’s sugar and ethanol industry
needs $80 billion of new investment in the next 10 years to meet
global demand, according to industry association Unica.  About 250 new plants are needed to process the country’s
sugar cane, and “only” five are starting this year, Geraldine
Kutas, a senior adviser at Unica, said in an interview at a
conference in Brussels today. New investment has been limited
because of reduced profits in biofuels, she said.  “We will have a deficit of 400 million tons of sugar cane
by 2020 if the current pace of investment remains unchanged,”
Kutas said. Brazil is the world’s largest producer of sugar.  Brazil’s main producing region will have declining cane
output for the first time in 10 years, industry researcher
Datagro Ltd said. Cane output is expected to drop 4 percent to
536 million metric tons from a year ago, it estimated June 16.  The Brazilian government’s decision to limit loans for
sugar producers in favor of ethanol is unlikely to affect the
sector as only 16 mills in the country produce just sugar, Kutas
said. The remaining units produce either only ethanol or both
sugar and ethanol. Brazil has 434 mills, according to Kutas.  To contact the reporter on this story:
