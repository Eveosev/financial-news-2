(Corrects Volynets’ title in second paragraph in a story
published on April 17.)  Russian billionaire Oleg Deripaska’s United Co. Rusal aims to boost deliveries of
aluminum to  China  as demand is growing in the Asian country.  “We hope that Rusal will occupy at least 30 percent of
China’s market in the next five to 10 years,” Artem Volynets,
chief executive officer of Deripaska’s En+ Group Ltd., told
