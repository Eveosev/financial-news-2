Western Canada Select oil weakened
against benchmark West Texas Intermediate after  Enbridge Inc. (ENB) 
said it would allocate space on two pipelines for July because
demand for crude shipments exceeds capacity.  Line 6B, which has a capacity of 283,100 barrels a day and
runs between Griffith,  Indiana , and Sarnia, can meet 75 percent
of shipper requests for July, the company said. Line 5, which
runs from Superior,  Wisconsin , to Sarnia, Ontario, and has a
capacity of 491,200 barrels a day, will be able to meet 96
percent of next month’s requests to move oil.  The discount for Western Canada Select widened 50 cents to
$20.50 a barrel less than WTI at 3:54 p.m. in  New York ,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The premium for Syncrude was unchanged at $8.50 a barrel.
Syncrude is a light, low-sulfur synthetic oil derived from the
 tar sands  in  Alberta .  Heavy Louisiana Sweet’s premium lost 35 cents to $20.35 a
barrel over WTI. Light Louisiana Sweet added 25 cents to $20.50
over the benchmark.  Among sour, or high-sulfur, grades, the premium for Mars
Blend gained $2.10 to $15.50 a barrel, while Poseidon added 75
cents to $13 over WTI.  Southern Green Canyon’s premium widened 25 cents to $12.50
a barrel above WTI. West Texas Sour’s discount narrowed 20 cents
to $1.30. Thunder Horse’s premium added 20 cents to $19.40 a
