South African inflation accelerated
to 4.6 percent last month, the fastest pace in 12 months, as
increased fuel costs added to pressure on the central bank to
raise  interest rates  from a 30-year low.  The inflation rate rose from 4.2 percent in April, the
Pretoria-based statistics office said on its  website  today. The
median estimate of 24 economists surveyed by Bloomberg was 4.4
percent. Prices climbed 0.5 percent in the month.  “Much now depends on whether global food and fuel prices,
which appear to have halted their upward trend, will ease off in
the coming months and whether the second-round effects of
inflation remain dormant,” Nedbank Group Ltd.,  South Africa ’s
fourth-largest bank, said in e-mailed comments.  The central bank warned price pressures were intensifying
when it left its benchmark interest rate unchanged at 5.5
percent on May 12. The bank expects inflation to average 5.1
percent this year and 6 percent in 2012. Its monetary policy
committee is due to announce its next interest-rate decision on
July 21.  “Global commodity-price increases have begun to pose risks
to the domestic inflation outlook,”  Gill Marcus , the bank’s
governor, said in  Pretoria  on June 14.  “This is expected to
create a challenge for monetary policy going forward.”  Wait-and-See  The government increased gasoline prices by 2.9 percent on
May 4 after oil costs surged on unrest in the  Middle East . The
price of crude gained 29 percent between the start of 2010 and
the end of last month.  The central bank “is likely to continue with its wait-and-
see policy until there is greater evidence of more generalized
inflation,” before raising rates, Nedbank said. “An early
interest rate increase would risk curbing the economic
recovery.”  South African bonds fell after the release of the inflation
data. The yield on the 6.75 percent notes due 2021 rose three
basis points, or 0.03 percentage point, to 8.38 percent at 10:35
a.m. in Johannesburg. The rand traded at 6.7268 per dollar,
little changed from before the release of the inflation data.  To contact the reporter on this story:
