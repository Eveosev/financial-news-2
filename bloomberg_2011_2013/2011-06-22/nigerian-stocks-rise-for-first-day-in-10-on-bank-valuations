Nigerian stocks rose for the first
time in 10 days, led by banks, which are trading at valuations
that appeal to foreign investors,  Renaissance Capital  said.  The Nigerian Stock Exchange All-Share Index rose 0.4
percent to 24,987.78 by 12:47 p.m. in Lagos.  Guaranty Trust Bank
Plc (GUARANTY) , the country’s second-biggest lender by market value, gained
2.3 percent, to 15.51 naira, snapping four days of declines
while  First Bank of Nigeria Plc (FIRSTBAN) , the third-largest lender,
climbed 2.8 percent, the most since May 10, to 12.30 naira.
 Stanbic IBTC Bank Plc (IBTCCB)  rallied 4.9 percent, the biggest surge in
two months, to 9.76 naira.  Nigerian banks’ share prices were equal to book value by
yesterday’s close, Adesoji Solanke, a Lagos-based analyst with
Renaissance, said by phone today. That compares with a price-to-
book value of 1.8 times for the MSCI Emerging Markets Banks
Index, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  “This is too good to be ignored as there is no fundamental
justification for it to be trading this low,” Solanke said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
