Paladin Energy Ltd. (PDN)  rose the most in
three months in Sydney after Citigroup Inc. said the uranium
producer may be “vulnerable” to a takeover.  The Perth-based company gained 5.2 percent to A$2.41 at the
4:10 p.m. close in Sydney, the most since March 18. That
compared with an increase of 0.5 percent for the benchmark
S&P/ASX 200 Index.  Paladin, which operates the Langer Heinrich mine in  Namibia 
and the Kayelekera project in Malawi, has slumped 50 percent in
Sydney since the March 11 earthquake and tsunami in  Japan 
damaged reactors at the Fukushima Dai-Ichi power station. The
crisis triggered concerns that countries would delay nuclear
power expansion plans, reducing demand for uranium.  “Paladin’s declining share price has made it more
vulnerable to a potential takeover,” Citigroup analysts led by
David Haddad said yesterday in a report. It may be “attractive
to Chinese, Russian, Indian and South Korean producers and
utilities seeking long-term uranium supply.”  The company’s shares were upgraded by Citigroup to “buy”
from “hold,” while the broker kept a “hold” rating on shares
of  Energy Resources of Australia Ltd. (ERA) , operator of the Ranger
mine in  Australia ’s Northern Territory.  “While sentiment towards uranium stocks is poor, we do not
believe Paladin’s share price accurately reflects the
fundamentals of the industry and see the company offering good
long-term value at current price,” the analysts said.  Any bid may value Paladin at about A$4 a share or A$3.1
billion, Citigroup said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
