UT Bank Ghana Ltd., a lender in the
West African nation, rose to the highest in more than a year
amid speculation that first-half profit increased.  The shares gained 1 pesewa, or 3.1 percent, to 33 pesewas
by the 3 p.m. close in the capital, Accra. That’s the highest
since June 3, 2010.  “We believe profit increased in the first half, and this
is building investor confidence in the shares,” Randy Mensah, a
stock trader at Accra-based  Databank Financial Services Ltd. 
said by phone today. He declined to give a specific forecast. UT
Bank’s results are expected next month, Mensah said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
