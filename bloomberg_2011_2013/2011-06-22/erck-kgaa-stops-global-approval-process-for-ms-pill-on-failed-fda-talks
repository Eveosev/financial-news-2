Merck KGaA (MRK) , which lost the race
against Novartis AG to introduce the first multiple sclerosis
pill, will no longer seek approval for the experimental
Cladribine medicine after regulators said the German drugmaker
would have to start a new clinical trial program.  The decision will result in an exceptional charge of 20
million euros ($28.8 million) in the second quarter, the
Darmstadt, Germany-based company said in an e-mailed statement
today.  “Attempting to fulfill the FDA and the EMA requirements
would necessitate the initiation of a new clinical trial program
which would take several years to complete,” Merck said in the
statement. Cladribine’s benefit-risk profile hasn’t changed, it
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
