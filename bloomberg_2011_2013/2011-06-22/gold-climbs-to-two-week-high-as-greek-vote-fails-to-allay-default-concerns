Gold may decline for the first time
in seven days in  New York  as a stronger dollar curbs demand for
the metal as an alternative investment.  The dollar gained against six major currencies amid
speculation Greek Prime Minister  George Papandreou  will struggle
to pass additional austerity measures, even after winning a
confidence vote that will pave the way for him to seek approval
for a 78 billion-euro ($112 billion) package of budget cuts and
asset sales. Gold traded 1.8 percent from a record set in May.  “Dollar gains are holding back gold prices,”  John Meyer 
an analyst at Fairfax IS in London, said today by phone. Still,
“investors are looking at uncertainty in Europe,” which will
support gold, he said.  Gold for August delivery fell $1.20, or 0.1 percent, to
$1,545.20 an ounce by 7:58 a.m. on the Comex in New York. The
metal earlier today matched yesterday’s peak of $1,549, matching
yesterday’s highest price since June 9. Immediate-delivery gold
was 0.1 percent lower at $1,544.75 in  London .  A total of 155 lawmakers supported the motion in the 300-
seat parliament in  Athens  early this morning, with 143 voting
against. European finance ministers said this week that they
would hold off on approving a 12 billion-euro payment to the
country promised for July until passage of the plans to cut the
deficit, sell state assets and impose a “crisis levy” on
wages.  Europe Debt Crisis  The  International Monetary Fund , contributor of a third of
the bailout money for  Greece  and the two other euro-area
countries that have received bailouts, Ireland and  Portugal , has
warned EU leaders that a failure to take decisive action on the
debt crisis risks triggering “large global spillovers.”  Gold is up 8.7 percent in 2011 after climbing the past 10
years, the longest run of gains in at least nine decades in
London.  Europe ’s debt crisis helped bullion futures reach a
record $1,577.40 on May 2. The metal climbed to an all-time high
of 958.4289 British pounds today.  “In the short-term, while the European crisis hangs on, we
should remain long on gold,” said Kishore Narne, head of
research at Anand Rathi Commodities Ltd. in Mumbai. “The buying
we are seeing right now is driven by haven demand.”  Silver for July delivery fell 0.8 percent to $36.085 an
ounce in New York. Holdings of the metal in exchange-traded
products dropped 91.7 metric tons yesterday to 13,460.2 tons,
the lowest level since September.  Australia ’s Perth Mint said it sold a record 10.7 million
1-ounce silver coins since July 1 last year. That’s 66 percent
higher than the previous full fiscal year and about 10-fold more
than five years earlier. Sales of 1-ounce gold coins will be
close to a record, Sales and Marketing Director Ron Currie said.  Palladium for September delivery declined 0.3 percent to
$764.60 an ounce. Platinum for July delivery was little changed
at $1,746 an ounce.  To contact the reporter for this story:
