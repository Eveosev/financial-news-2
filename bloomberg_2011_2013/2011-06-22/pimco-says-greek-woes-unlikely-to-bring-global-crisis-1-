A global financial crisis similar to
the one that followed the collapse of Lehman Brothers Holdings
Inc. is “unlikely but not impossible” if  Greece  defaults,
according to Pacific Investment Management Co.  “The scenario of Greece contaminating direct exposures is
concentrated in Europe, especially France and Germany,” Chief
Executive Officer Mohamed El-Erian said on a teleconference
broadcast in Taipei today. “And in that sense it can be dealt
with through recapitalization.” The debt-laden nation suffers
from an “inability to grow” that is among “multiple”
problems facing the global economy, he said.  Greek Prime Minister  George Papandreou  won a confidence
vote yesterday, bolstering his new government’s chances of
pushing through austerity measures to secure further
international financial aid. Asian currencies strengthened
against the dollar, led by the South Korean won’s 0.5 percent
advance. The MSCI Asia-Pacific Index of shares climbed 0.9
percent.  Under its “new normal” philosophy, Newport Beach,
California-based Pimco expects a shrinking global role for
developed economies, as well as below-average economic growth
and investment returns.  The world economy faces a “bumpy journey to a new
normal,” El-Erian said. The balance sheets of developed
economies are “contaminated” and the  U.S. dollar , Japanese yen
and euro are “structurally impaired.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
