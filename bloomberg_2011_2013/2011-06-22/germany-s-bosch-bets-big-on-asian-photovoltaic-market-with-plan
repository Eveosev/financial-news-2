Germany ’s Robert Bosch GmbH will
invest 520 million euros ($749 million) in a photovoltaic
manufacturing site in Malaysia to tap the growing Asian solar
market, the company said.  Construction of the plant in the state of Penang would
start this year and production at the end of 2013, Stuttgart-
based Bosch said today in an e-mail. Some 2,000 people would
work in the plant producing wafers, cells and modules with a
total capacity of 640 megawatts, one of the largest in the
company’s history, Bosch said.  The Asian solar market is expected to grow 30 percent
annually over the coming years, the company said. “Bosch with
this investment continues its international growth course in the
photovoltaic sector,” Chief Executive Officer Franz Fehrenbach
said.  The world’s biggest car parts maker, Bosch has expanded
into the PV market with the acquisition of Ersol AG and an 85
percent stake in Aleo Solar AG. Bosch expects its solar energy
unit to generate sales exceeding 1 billion euros this year.  The new PV plant is the second this year after Bosch
announced in May it would build a site in Venissieux,  France .  The investment in  Malaysia  continues a trend by solar
manufacturers including First Solar Inc. to move production to
 Asia  to cut costs and tap a dynamic market, said Katharina Cholewa, a solar analyst at WestLB AG in Duesseldorf, Germany.  “European companies will be able to sell more modules in
Asia in the coming years,” she said. “But they also have to
watch the local competition. There’s significant domestic
production there already.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
