CarMax Inc. (KMX) , the largest U.S. seller
of used cars, climbed the most in the Standard & Poor’s 500
Index after selling more vehicles at higher prices in its first
fiscal quarter.  CarMax rose $2.14, or 7 percent, to $32.66 at 4:03 p.m. in
 New York  Stock Exchange composite trading. The shares surged as
much as 9.7 percent earlier, the biggest intraday gain in almost
a year.  Used-vehicle sales increased 7.5 percent to 108,511,
Richmond, Virginia-based CarMax said today in a statement. Net
income in the quarter ended May 31 rose to $126.3 million, or 55
cents a share, from $101.1 million, or 44 cents, a year earlier.
The average estimate of 13 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg was
for a profit of 47 cents.  “We achieved these results despite economic and
marketplace challenges such as lower  consumer confidence , high
unemployment, elevated gas prices and escalating wholesale
prices, which have driven up average selling prices of both new
and used vehicles,” Chief Executive Officer Tom Folliard said
today on a conference call.  Used-vehicle prices have surged to the highest on record,
according to Manheim Auctions. The largest U.S. auto auction
chain’s Used Vehicle Value Index climbed to 127.8 for May, the
highest since the index began in 1995.  “A lot of people are looking at their used vehicles and
thinking they can cash in, so they’re taking it to CarMax for
them to wholesale,” Mark Mandel, an analyst at ThinkEquity LLC
in New York, said in a telephone interview. “The dealers are
willing to buy them because they can pass on the price
increases. That business is real lively right now.”  Average Prices  CarMax’s average used-vehicle selling prices increased 5.2
percent to $18,902. Wholesale vehicle sales rose 32 percent to
85,062 units, with average prices at that business increasing 14
percent to $5,469.  Auto retailers such as  AutoNation Inc. (AN)  have said they are
stepping up efforts in the used-vehicle business this year after
the Japan earthquake and tsunami in March disrupted production
and lowered inventory of new cars and trucks.  “It’s really difficult to look at our results and say that
we’ve been impacted,” Folliard said on the conference call.
“It’s not the first time that all the new-car dealers have said
they’re going to focus on used cars. You see a lot of those
dealers out in the marketplace in a much more aggressive way.
Eventually that will subside.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
