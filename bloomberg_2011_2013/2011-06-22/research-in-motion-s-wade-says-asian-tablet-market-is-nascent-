Gregory Wade, managing director for
 Southeast Asia  at  Research In Motion Ltd. (RIM) , comments on the
region’s market for tablet computers.  The maker of the BlackBerry smartphone will start sales of
its PlayBook tablet tomorrow in  Singapore , where Wade spoke in
an interview with Bloomberg Television today.  The Waterloo, Ontario-based company said this month that it
had sold 500,000 PlayBook devices in the quarter ended May 28,
after introducing the product in the North American market in
April.  On outlook for Playbook demand in Asia:  “The great thing about the BlackBerry PlayBook from my
perspective in this part of the world is that in many ways, the
tablet category is very, very nascent.”  On support for developers of Android applications:  “When you think about the application development space,
whether it’s for the BlackBerry PlayBook, or the range of
BlackBerry smartphones, the real focus that we have is to
provide a range, a choice in terms of the application
development environments.  “We are very much focused on bringing in an unconditional
level of support as it relates to the Android applications
perspective.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
