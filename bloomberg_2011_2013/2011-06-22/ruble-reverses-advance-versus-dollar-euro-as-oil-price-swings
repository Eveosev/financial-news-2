The ruble erased its advance against
the dollar and the euro as the price of oil,  Russia ’s chief
export earner, fluctuated in  New York  trading.  Russia’s currency was little changed at 27.9899 per dollar
by the 5 p.m. close of trading in Moscow, after earlier
appreciating as much as 0.3 percent. The ruble ended the day
steady at 40.25 per euro, after strengthening as much as 0.2
percent today against that currency.  Crude, which along with natural gas makes up about 25
percent of Russia’s economic output, was 0.5 percent higher at
$94.62 a barrel at 9:53 a.m. in New York, after earlier gaining
as much as 0.8 percent and sliding as much as 1 percent. Urals
crude, Russia’s chief export oil blend, added 0.9 percent to
$109.15 a barrel today.  An industry report released yesterday showed U.S. crude
stockpiles dropped by 81,000 barrels last week. Analysts are
expecting an Energy Department report today to show supplies
dropped by 1.83 million barrels, according to a Bloomberg
survey.  To contact the reporter on this story:
