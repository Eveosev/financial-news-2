U.K. Foreign Office Minister
Alistair Burt said he is “extremely concerned” by the process
through which Bahrain sentenced 21 opposition members, the
Foreign and Commonwealth Office said in an e-mailed statement
today.  The trial of civilians by a military judge, the reports of
abuse in detention and lack of access to legal counsel are
“deeply worrying,” Burt said, according to the statement. Burt
urged the Bahraini government to take “concrete actions” to
address the country’s long-term challenges and to ensure any
appeals process addresses the “substantial concerns that have
been raised in these tribunals,” the statement said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
