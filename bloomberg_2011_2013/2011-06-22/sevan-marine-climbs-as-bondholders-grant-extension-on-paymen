Sevan Marine ASA (SEVAN)  shares rose the
most in three weeks after it was granted a one-month extension
from bondholders on interest payments on 700 million kroner
($128 million) bond.  The shares rose as much as 38 percent, and were up 22
percent to 0.49 krone as of 9:44 a.m. in Oslo. The operator of
oil production vessels has slumped more than 90 percent in 2011.  The interest payment on the senior unsecured bond was
extended to July 22 after reaching an agreement with a majority
of bondholders, the Arendal, Norway-based company said in a
statement.  Sevan is in “constructive dialogue” with its lenders and
is developing a plan to solve its liquidity problems, the
company said. “The company currently believes a solution in
principle must be agreed with relevant stakeholders during the
first half of July,” it said.  Sevan encountered financing problems after it failed to
complete a rights offer in May that would have provided the
capital to help cover costs on maintenance of its cylindrical
floating production and storage vessels.  The company is holding an extraordinary general meeting
today to vote on electing Jens Ulltveit-Moe chairman after he
bought a 5 percent stake in the company following the failed
share sale.  To contact the reporter on this story:
