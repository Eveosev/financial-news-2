As regulators remove references to
credit-rating firms from federal rules, institutional investors
should also rethink how they use the ratings, U.S. Securities
and Exchange Commission Chairman  Mary Schapiro  said.  “If your documents require a specific rating by a specific
rating agency I urge you to revisit it,” Schapiro said today at
a meeting of the American Securitization Forum in Washington. If
investors can’t buy securities rated by new firms, she said,
“how will more competition that may improve the quality of
ratings develop?”  Last year’s Dodd-Frank Act required government agencies to
rid their regulations of references to credit raters after the
firms were accused of contributing to the 2008 credit crisis by
giving top ratings to mortgage-linked bonds that later collapsed
in value.  Schapiro also said that investors are waiting for reforms
in the securitization market “before they are willing to wade
back in.”  “Efforts to implement the reforms that would bring
investors back to the markets are being met with strong and what
I believe to be short-sighted resistance,” Schapiro said. “We
should not weaken reform for short-term gain.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
