People who take high doses of
cholesterol-lowering drugs such as  Pfizer Inc. (PFE) ’s Lipitor and
 AstraZeneca Plc (AZN) ’s Crestor have a greater risk of developing
diabetes and a lower risk of heart complications than those who
take smaller amounts of the medicines, researchers said.  The finding supports work from the same researchers
published last year showing patients taking the drugs known as
 statins  were more likely to develop diabetes than those given a
placebo. The risk of diabetes rising in parallel with the amount
of medicine taken by patients strengthens the association, the
researchers said.  The researchers analyzed five earlier trials, involving
32,752 patients, to tease out the effect of the drug dose. Those
getting intensive treatment were 12 percent more likely to be
diagnosed with diabetes, the study found. Patients also were 16
percent less likely to have a heart attack, stroke or surgery to
clear their arteries or to die from cardiovascular disease
during a five-year period than those given a smaller amount,
according to the research.  “Clinicians should be vigilant for the development of
diabetes in patients receiving intensive statin therapy,” said
the investigators, led by David Preiss, a research fellow at the
University of Glasgow. “It is important to quantify any
potential long-term risks to enable physicians and patients to
make informed choices,” they said.  The study appears in today’s  Journal of the American
Medical Association .  To contact the reporter on this story:
