Alexander Lebedev , owner of
Britain’s Evening Standard and Independent newspapers, told Sky
News in an interview he will “probably” keep a stake in
Moscow-based National Reserve Bank and would keep his farming
interests.  The Russian billionaire is planning to sell most of his
Russian investments, including his holding in Russian airline,
OAO Aeroflot, and his holding in  Gazprom OAO (GAZP) , and his
investments in “airline manufacturing, properties, real
estate,” he said in the interview.  To contact the reporter on this story:
