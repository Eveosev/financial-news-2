Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  will join Treasury Secretary  Timothy F. Geithner  in
meetings with Indian officials next week, a U.S. Treasury
official said today.  Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Mary Schapiro
and Commodity Futures Trading Commission Chairman Gary Gensler
will also participate in the talks with Indian officials
including Finance Minister Pranab Mukherjee, the official said
in a briefing with reporters in Washington. The official
declined to be identified as a condition of the briefing on the
second U.S.-India Economic and Financial Partnership meetings
June 27-28.  Growth in India’s $1.4 trillion economy, Asia’s third-
largest, declined to 7.8 percent in the three months through
March 31, the lowest pace in five quarters. Manufacturing and
the service sector slowed after the central bank raised interest
rates to curb inflation. Companies including  Maruti Suzuki India
Ltd. (MSIL) , the country’s largest carmaker, have reported slowing
sales growth as rising borrowing costs and more expensive fuel
hurt consumer demand.  To contact the reporter on this story:
