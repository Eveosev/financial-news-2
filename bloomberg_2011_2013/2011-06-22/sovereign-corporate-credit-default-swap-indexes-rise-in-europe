The cost of insuring European
sovereign and bank bonds rose on concern  Greece  may still
struggle to pass austerity measures needed to secure further
international aid and stave off default.  The Markit iTraxx Financial Index of credit-default swaps
on the senior debt of 25 banks and insurers increased for the
first time in five days, jumping 8 basis points to 162, while
the subordinated index climbed 16 basis points to 288, according
to JPMorgan Chase & Co. at 4:30 p.m. in London.  Investors are concerned Greek Prime Minister George Papandreou’s victory in a confidence vote yesterday was not
strong enough to ensure parliamentary approval next week for a
78 billion-euro ($112 billion) package of budget cuts. European
finance ministers and the  International Monetary Fund  this week
said they would hold back a 12 billion-euro payment due in July
until passage of the plans.  “Yesterday’s decision was nothing which would bring a
sustainable calm to the market,” said Stefan Kolek, a Munich-
based strategist at UniCredit SpA. “Financials are the closest
proxy to the Greek story because of their exposure to government
debt.”  The Markit iTraxx SovX Western Europe Index of credit-
default swaps on 15 governments climbed 11 basis points to 224.
An increase signals deteriorating perceptions of  credit quality .  Greek Swaps  Swaps on Greece rose 50 basis points to 1,947, according to
CMA. That implies an 81 percent chance of default within five
years. Contracts on Ireland jumped 19 basis points to 755,
 Portugal  increased 26 to 778 and  Italy  climbed 11.5 to 179,
while  Spain  rose 9 to 281 and  Belgium  was 5 higher at 151.  The cost of insuring company debt also climbed with the
Markit iTraxx Crossover Index of swaps linked to 40 companies
with mostly high-yield credit ratings increasing 14 basis points
to 410. The Markit iTraxx Europe Index of 125 companies with
investment-grade ratings rose 3.25 basis point to 110 basis
points.  A basis point on a credit-default swap protecting 10
million euros ($14.4 million) of debt from default for five
years is equivalent to 1,000 euros a year. Swaps pay the buyer
face value in exchange for the underlying securities or the cash
equivalent should a borrower fail to adhere to its debt
agreements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
