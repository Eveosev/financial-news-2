The Philippine peso rose to a one-
week high as demand for emerging-market assets increased after
Greek Prime Minister  George Papandreou  won a vote of confidence,
easing concern the European nation would default.  Asian currencies and stocks climbed on optimism  Greece  will
move ahead with reforms to cut the  budget deficit  and sell state
assets in order to get further financial aid from the European
Union.  “Greece bought a new lease on life and we’re expecting the
peso to gain further,” said Marcelo Ayes, a senior vice
president at Rizal Commercial Banking Corp. in Manila. “The
risk factor on emerging markets lessened with the Greek move.”  The peso strengthened 0.2 percent to 43.365 per dollar as
of the 4 p.m. close in Manila, the highest level since June 15,
according to Tullett Prebon Plc. The MSCI Asia-Pacific Index of
regional stocks advanced for a second day, rising 0.8 percent.  Benchmark 10-year bonds slid for a second day. The yield on
the 7.375 percent note due March 2021 gained five basis points,
or 0.05 percentage point, to 6.40 percent, according to
Tradition Financial Services. That’s the highest level since
June 6.  To contact the reporter for this story:
