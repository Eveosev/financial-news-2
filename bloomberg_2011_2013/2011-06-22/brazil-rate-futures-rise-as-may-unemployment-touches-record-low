Yields on most Brazilian interest-
rate futures contracts due over the next three years rose after
the  unemployment rate  fell to the lowest ever for the month of
May.  Yields on the interest-rate futures contract due in January
2013 rose one basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 12.57
percent at 11 a.m. in  New York . The contract due in January 2014
also rose one basis point to 12.49 percent.  Brazil’s unemployment rate fell to 6.4 percent in May, from
7.5 percent a year earlier, the national statistics  agency  said
today in a report distributed in Rio de Janeiro. The jobless
rate was unchanged from April. The data show that the economy
still has a “strong pace” and that the deceleration doesn’t
warrant a slowdown in monetary tightening, said  Jankiel Santos ,
the chief economist at Espirito Santo Investment Bank.  “ Interest rates  will have to rise at least one more
time,” Santos said in a telephone interview from Sao Paulo.  May’s unemployment rate was the lowest for the month since
the statistics agency began tracking joblessness in Brazil’s six
biggest metropolitan areas in 2002. Average real wages rose 4
percent from a year ago, and increased 1.1 percent from April,
to 1,567 reais ($988) per month.  The real retreated 0.1 percent to 1.5871 per dollar, from
1.5862 yesterday, as investors awaited the  Federal Reserve ’s
outlook for stimulus programs and interest rates. The Fed will
probably affirm a decision to end bond purchases and repeat a
pledge to keep the benchmark interest rate close to zero,
economists said in a Bloomberg survey before today’s
announcement.  To contact the reporters on this story:
