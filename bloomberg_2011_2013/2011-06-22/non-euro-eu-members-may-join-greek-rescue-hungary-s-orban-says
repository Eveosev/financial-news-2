European Union nations that aren’t
part of the euro area may be asked to help solve  Greece ’s debt
crisis, said Hungarian Prime Minister  Viktor Orban , who holds
the bloc’s rotating presidency.  Under a plan to be discussed by European leaders at a
summit in Brussels this week, states that haven’t adopted the
common currency would divert a “certain percentage” of funds
they receive from the EU to Greece, without making any direct
payments for the rescue effort, Orban told Budapest-based  TV2  in
an interview late yesterday.  “For example, less money would come to  Hungary  so it can
go to Greece,” he said. “A big debate is likely to happen on
this in the coming weeks and months.” Orban didn’t say who
proposed the plan.  To contact the reporter on this story:
