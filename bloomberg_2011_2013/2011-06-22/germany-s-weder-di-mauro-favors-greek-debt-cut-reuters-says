Beatrice Weder di Mauro, a member of
the German government’s council of economic advisers, called a
“tough” cut of Greek debt unavoidable in the long run, Reuters
reported, citing a speech by the economics professor in
Brussels.  Because European banks couldn’t bear it, such a step isn’t
feasible for now, and the current debt restructuring plans will
help only to win time, the newswire cited her as saying. Di
Mauro also criticized the fact that European banking regulators
don’t include a Greek default scenario in their bank stress
tests, Reuters said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
