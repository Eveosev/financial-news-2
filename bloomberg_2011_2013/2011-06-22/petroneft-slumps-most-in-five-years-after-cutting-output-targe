Petroneft Resources Plc (PTR) , the London-
listed oil explorer focused on  Russia ’s Tomsk region, fell the
most in almost five years after cutting its output target.  Petroneft fell as much as 25 percent, the steepest intraday
decline since September 2006, and traded at 29.13 pence as of
10:45 a.m. local time. The stock has slumped 59 percent so far
this year.  The output target for the first quarter of 2012 has been
revised to 4,000 to 5,000 barrels of oil a day, and 7,000 to
9,000 barrels for the second quarter of 2013. Last month, the
Dublin-based explorer said it was targeting output of as much as
8,000 barrels by the end of the first quarter of 2012.  Petroneft said in a statement today that that the western
part of the Lineynoye field is “lower structurally and has
thinner pays.” The company said “thicker pay zones” in the
north of the field will compensate. Fewer wells available for
production in 2011 will reduce the near-term production rate.  “The overall impact on Lineynoye field reserves is
expected to be minimal,” Petroneft said in the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
