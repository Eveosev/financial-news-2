Greece ’s two-year notes rose after
Prime Minister  George Papandreou  won a confidence vote, paving
the way for the country to implement austerity measures needed
to receive further aid.  The gains drove the securities higher for a fourth
consecutive day, the longest run of price increases since June
6. A total of 155 Greek lawmakers supported the motion in the
300-seat parliament in  Athens  early this morning, with 143
voting against, the speaker, Filippos Petsalnikos, said. Irish
securities fell and Portuguese two- and 10-year yields rose to
records. German bunds advanced after the nation sold 3.4 billion
euros ($4.9 billion) of 10-year bonds at an average yield of
2.96 percent.  “Greek bonds are higher as parliament duly passed the vote
last night,” said  Huw Worthington , a fixed-income strategist at
 Barclays Capital  in London. “Attention will turn to next week’s
vote on the austerity package. It looks like that will be
passed. Then, they’ll get the money in July and we may see a bit
of a relief rally.”  Greek two-year note yields, which surpassed 30 percent for
the first time last week, fell 32 basis points to 27.32 percent
as of 11:37 a.m. in London. The 4.6 percent security due May
2013 rose 0.425, or 4.25 euros per 1,000-euro face amount, to
69.39. The 10-year bond yield was eight basis points lower at
16.89 percent. It rose to a euro-era record 18.35 percent on
June 17.  Greek Losses  Germany ’s 10-year bund yield was three basis points lower
at 2.95 percent. It declined to 2.91 percent on June 16, the
least since Jan. 11. Yields on two-year notes were four basis
points lower, at 1.49 percent. They dropped to 1.43 percent on
June 16, the lowest since Feb. 22.  Investors bid for 1.6 times the amount of German 10-year
bunds on offer. That compares with a so-called bid-to-cover
ratio of 1.7 at the previous auction of the same securities held
on May 25, which were allotted at a yield of 3.04 percent.  Greek and Portuguese securities have lost 19 percent in
2011, while Irish debt has dropped 10 percent, according to
indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the European Federation of
Financial Analysts Societies. German  government bonds  have
returned 0.2 percent, while Treasuries gained 3.2 percent, the
indexes show.  The yield on Greece’s two-year note has plunged more than
200 basis points, or 2 percentage points, in four days as German
Chancellor  Angela Merkel  dropped calls for a mandatory bond
exchange that might lead credit-rating companies to declare
Greece in default.  Parliamentary Approval  Papandreou reshuffled his cabinet and sought the approval
of the chamber after fending off a revolt within his socialist
Pasok party last week.  With the confidence vote behind him, attention now turns to
whether Papandreou can push through parliamentary approval next
week of a 78 billion-euro package of budget cuts to stave off
the threat of default. European finance ministers said this week
that they would withhold approval of a 12 billion-euro payment
to the country promised for July until passage of the plans to
cut the deficit, sell state assets and impose a “crisis levy”
on wages.  European Commission President  Jose Barroso  said the vote
“removes an element of uncertainty from an already very
difficult situation.” He said in an e-mailed statement from
Brussels it was “good news for Greece and for the European
Union as a whole.”  ‘Global Spillovers’  The  International Monetary Fund , contributor of a third of
the bailout money for Greece, Ireland and  Portugal , has warned
EU leaders that a failure to take decisive action on the debt
crisis risks triggering “large global spillovers.”  “The market is still wary, despite the Greek confidence
vote,” said Eric Wand, a fixed-income strategist at Lloyds Bank
Corporate Markets in London. “The austerity measures may have a
much rougher ride getting through parliament. The market is a
bit concerned that the situation hasn’t greatly changed and the
peripheral is still vulnerable.”  Portuguese 10-year yields rose 18 basis points to an all-
time high of 11.30 percent. Two-year note yields added 35 basis
points to 13.56 percent, also a record.  Irish 10-year yields jumped 28 basis points to 11.68
percent. The yield reached a record 11.70 percent on June 17.  To contact the reporters on this story:
