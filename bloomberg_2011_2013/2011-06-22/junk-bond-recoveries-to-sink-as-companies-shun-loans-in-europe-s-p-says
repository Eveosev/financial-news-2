Investors spurring record sales of
junk bonds this year are accepting declining credit standards as
expected recoveries plunge,  Standard & Poor’s  said.  Speculative-grade issues with a recovery rating of four
have increased to 57 percent of the market in the year through
May 15, compared to 11 percent in 2009, London-based analyst
Taron Wade wrote in a report today. A rating of four indicates
an expectation of 30-50 percent recovery in a default.  “Lower-rated credits and those under private-equity
ownership can more easily access capital,” Wade said in the
report. “It’s already leading to lower average recovery ratings
on senior secured debt.”  Companies are increasingly shunning loans in favor of high-
yield notes to fund acquisitions, Standard and Poor’s said, as
they can borrow more with fewer restrictions. Private-equity
firms can increase the amount they borrow for a buyout to 62
percent of the purchase price in a bond-financed deal, compared
with half using loans, according to S&P LCD.  The average rating for  junk bonds  has dropped to 3.2 in
2011, compared with 2.8 for 2010 and 2.2 for 2009, S&P said. A
level of three implies a 50-70 percent recovery, and two a
70-90 percent.  Investors in  Europe  bought 14.5 billion euros of junk bonds
in the first quarter, an increase of 2 billion euros from the
same period in 2010, S&P said. Issuance of 30 billion euros so
far this year is on pace to surpass 2010’s record 41.5 billion
euros of sales, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Speculative, or junk-rated, bonds are rated below BBB- by
S&P and Fitch Ratings and Baa3 by Moody’s Investors Service.  To contact the reporter on this story:
