U.K. Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg has suggested every British voter should become a
shareholder in  Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc (RBS)  and  Lloyds
Banking Group Plc (LLOY)  through the creation of a “people’s banking
system,” the Financial Times reported, citing comments by
Clegg.  Clegg said he wrote to Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne and Treasury Chief Secretary Danny Alexander this week
to ask them to consider introducing a “mass share-ownership
scheme” for when the government comes to sell back its shares
in RBS and Lloyds, the FT said, citing Clegg, speaking from Rio
de Janeiro.  To contact the reporter on this story:
