Ghana ’s cedi strengthened against
the dollar as mining companies bought the local currency to
finance their operations,  Barclays Bank Plc  said.  The currency of the world’s second biggest cocoa producer
appreciated as much as 0.4 percent to 1.5127 before trading 0.2
percent stronger at 1.5155 by 2:38 p.m. in the capital, Accra,
according to Bloomberg data. The cedi has gained 2 percent
against the dollar this year.  “There was adequate supply on the market today from mining
firms,” Kobla Nyaletey, a currency trader at the local unit of
Barclays, said in a telephone interview today. “Demand was not
very strong.”  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
