F5 Networks Inc. (FFIV)  gained the most in
almost a month after  Barclays Capital  increased its target price
and rating, citing growing demand for the Seattle-based
company’s networking products.  F5 Networks shares rose $4.64, or 4.5 percent, to $107.64
at 10:53 a.m. in New York on the Nasdaq Stock Market, after
earlier touching $108.40 for the biggest gain since May 27. The
stock dropped 21 percent this year before today.  The company will benefit as more businesses turn to so-
called cloud services, or the delivery of software, storage and
computing power over the Internet, Barclays said. The pullback
in shares this year is a buying opportunity, Barclays said,
raising the target price to $125 from $110 and increasing the
rating to “overweight.”  “We believe F5’s revenue pipeline and market is healthy,”
the Barclays analysts said in a report today. “Trends such as
server virtualization and cloud architectures are driving the
need for application delivery controllers, traffic management,
and virtual storage and security products.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
