Israel ’s 10-year bond rose, pushing
the yield to the lowest in more than a week, on bets a decline
in food and energy prices may slow inflation and reduce the pace
of interest rate increases.  All of 22 economists surveyed by Bloomberg forecast the
 Bank of Israel  will leave the rate unchanged at 3.25 percent on
June 27. The yield on the benchmark Mimshal Shiklit due January
2020 retreated for a third day, falling 3 basis points, or 0.03
percentage point, to 5.13 percent at 1:37 p.m. in Tel Aviv. The
shekel weakened 0.2 percent to 3.4184 against the dollar.  “Investors are buying long-term  government bonds  on bets
the protest against rising dairy prices will bring down prices,
and falling oil prices may moderate inflation,” Effi Cohen, a
bond trader at Leader Capital Markets Ltd. in  Tel Aviv , said by
telephone. “Yields are also moving down as the market is
expecting borrowing costs will not be raised at next week’s
decision.”  Israeli Industry, Trade and Labor Minister Shalom Simhon
yesterday named a panel to study dairy-product prices following
protests. Finance Minister Yuval Steinitz said he plans to
decide within weeks on steps the government may take to increase
competition, including removing barriers to dairy imports. Crude
