Japan ’s main stock exchange lowered
the cost of selling short the shares of  Tokyo Electric  Power Co.,
the company at the center of the worst nuclear accident in 25
years.  Tokyo Electric rose 0.3 percent to 306 yen as of the 3 p.m.
local time close of trading, the smallest advance since May 2.
Tokyo Stock Exchange Inc., which raised the level of collateral
required for short sales to 50 percent last week, said yesterday
it would reduce the price back to 30 percent. The stock surged
65 percent on June 14 and 15 after the cost of short sales was
increased and Japan’s government outlined plans to assist the
utility in paying compensation to victims of the accident.  About 6.6 percent of Tepco’s outstanding shares were sold
short as of June 20, the most since 2006 and up from 5 percent
on June 13, according to  Data Explorers , a New York-based
research firm. Shares in Japan’s largest utility by sales have
fallen 86 percent from March 10, the day before a magnitude-9
earthquake and resultant tsunami crippled Tokyo Electric’s
Fukushima Dai-Ichi nuclear power station.  The margin collateral requirement is automatically lowered
when, during a five-day period, the balance of stocks sold on
margin is less than 12 percent of a company’s outstanding shares,
stocks bought on margin represents less than 24 percent of its
total shares, and the stock price is within 15 percent of the
25-day moving average.  The balance of Tepco stocks bought on margin fell to 58.76
million shares on June 17 from 74.31 million shares on June 10,
while margin selling fell to 80.88 million shares from 97.92
million shares, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  In a short sale, a trader borrows shares and sells them,
trying to profit by repurchasing the stock at a lower price,
repaying the loan and pocketing the difference.  To contact the reporters on this story:
