China ’s money-market rate climbed to
the highest level in more than three years as a worsening cash
crunch prompted the central bank to suspend a bill sale.  The seven-day repurchase rate, which measures interbank
funding availability, has more than doubled since June 14, when
the People’s Bank of China ordered lenders to set aside more
money as reserves for a sixth time this year. The central bank
suspended a sale of bills tomorrow, according to a statement on
its website today.  “Banks have to hoard cash to meet the regulator’s capital
or loan-to-deposit requirements by the end of every quarter,”
said Liu Junyu, a bond analyst at China Merchants Bank Co., the
nation’s sixth-largest lender. “So we won’t see the shortage
easing.”  The seven-day repo rate gained 47 basis points, or 0.47
percentage point, to 8.81 percent as of the 4:30 p.m. close in
 Shanghai , according to a weighted average rate compiled by the
National Interbank Funding Center. It touched 8.93 percent, the
highest level since October 2007.  The 14-day repo rate declined 125 basis points to 7.34
percent, the biggest drop since Feb. 1. The slump in longer-term
rates shows the cash shortage will probably ease from the start
of next month, said Liu. A total of 372 billion yuan ($57.6
billion) of central bank bills and  repurchase agreements  will
mature next month, compared with 601 billion yuan in June, he
said.  One-year interest-rate swaps, the fixed cost needed to
receive the floating seven-day repurchase rate, rose eight basis
points to 3.94 percent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
They touched 3.97 percent, the highest level since Feb. 22.  The yield on the 2.77 percent government bond due May 2012
gained two basis points to 3.63 percent, according to the
Interbank Funding Center.  -- Judy Chen . Editors: Simon Harvey, Ven Ram  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
