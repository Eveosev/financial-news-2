Ukraine’s exports of wheat will
probably decline to 3.7 million metric tons in the marketing
year ending June 30 from 9.2 million tons in the previous
marketing year, a 60 percent decline, according to Kiev-based
researcher ProAgro.  Wheat exports declined in May by 52 percent to 72,600 tons
compared with the previous month, ProAgro said in an e-mailed
statement yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
