Treasury 10-year yields will have
difficulty pushing below 2.88 percent, according to Daiwa Asset
Management Co., citing trading patterns.  A Fibonacci graph shows the level is a 61.8 percent
retracement of an increase in rates from Oct. 8 to Feb. 9.
Yields fell to 2.88 percent last week yet haven’t been able to
close below the barrier. According to Fibonacci analysis, a
failure to break past one level suggests a decline is ending.  “This is a strong resistance level,” said Tsutomu Komiya,
who helps oversee the equivalent of $115.4 billion as an
investor in  Tokyo  at Daiwa, a unit of  Japan ’s second-biggest
brokerage by market value. “The market needs something new to
drive yields through these levels” such as a weak June
employment report, he said.  Ten-year Treasuries yielded 2.98 percent as of 6:45 a.m. in
 London , according to Bloomberg Bond Trader prices. Rates have
fallen from February’s high of 3.77 percent. The next Fibonacci
level after 2.88 percent is 2.67 percent.  The U.S. jobless rate unexpectedly climbed to 9.1 percent
in May, the highest level this year, and hiring grew at the
slowest pace in eight months, a Labor Department report showed
June 3. Another report like that one would be enough to push
yields to new lows for 2011, Komiya said.  Fibonacci  analysis is based on a series of numbers
developed by 13th century mathematician Leonardo da Pisa, known
as Fibonacci, who was studying growth rates. Analysts use the
numbers to determine levels where buy and sell orders may be
set.  In  technical analysis , investors and analysts study charts
of trading patterns and prices to forecast changes in a
security, commodity, currency or index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
