Gold rose to a seven-week high as
fluctuations in  currency markets  boosted demand for the precious
metal as an alternative investment.  The euro fell against the dollar in the two weeks ended
June 17 on speculation that the Greek government will struggle
to pass austerity measures to avoid a default. Gold prices in
U.K. pounds rose to a record today. The metal gained for seventh
straight sessions, the longest rally since April.  “Gold is in a unique position of being able to go higher,
despite a stronger dollar, which is a very bullish signal,”
said  Matthew Zeman , a strategist at Kingsview Financial in
 Chicago . “A lot of nations are running deficits that are not
sustainable in the long run. There comes a point where people
just don’t believe in paper currencies.”  Gold futures for August delivery rose $7, or 0.5 percent,
to settle at $1,553.40 an ounce at 1:50 p.m. on the Comex in  New
York . Earlier, the metal reached $1,559.30, the highest for a
most-active contract since May 2, when the price reached a
record $1,577.40.  Gold has climbed 25 percent in the past 12 months as
escalating sovereign-debt woes and record-low U.S. borrowing
costs increased the appeal of the metal as an alternative to
currencies. The price denominated in euros reached an all-time
high on May 25.  Greece  Vote  Greece’s government won a vote of confidence and needs
parliamentary approval next week for 78 billion euros ($112
billion) in budget cuts to prevent default.  The U.S. Federal Reserve has kept its main interest rate
close to zero percent since December 2008 and is expected to end
a second round of so-called quantitative easing at the end of
the month.  Gold may trade between $1,500 to $2,000 over the next five
years, analysts at Bank of America Merrill Lynch said yesterday
in a report.  “Given the expansion of the global  money supply  in recent
years, it is unlikely that investors will sell their gold
below” $1,000, the bank said. An average gold price above
$2,000 “would require a disorderly sovereign default in the
euro zone or QE3 in the U.S., both of which are not our base
case for the moment,” the analysts said.  Silver futures for July delivery rose 36 cents, or 1
percent, to $36.739 an ounce on the Comex.  Platinum futures for July delivery climbed $5.20, or 0.3
percent, to $1,752.40 an ounce on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange .  Palladium futures for September delivery rose $3.40, or 0.4
percent, to $770.65 an ounce on the Nymex.  To contact the reporter on this story:
