BRF - Brasil Foods SA (BRFS3)  is prepared to
share its distribution network with competitors as well as sell
brands and plants to win approval from antitrust regulators for
the purchase of Sadia SA, a person familiar with the talks said.  The world’s largest poultry exporter plans to present a new
proposal to  Brazil ’s antitrust agency, known as Cade, next week,
said the person, who asked not to be identified because the
negotiations are private. The company has no plans to include
the divestiture of top-selling brands Sadia and Perdigao in the
proposal, he said.  The company was created two years ago after Perdigao SA
bought Sadia in a $3.8 billion deal supported by state-company
pension funds. Carlos Ragazzo, one of the five commissioners
voting on the case, recommended on June 8 that the antitrust
agency block the merger, saying the combined company wielded too
much market share in processed foods and would hurt consumers.  Brasil Foods ’ American depositary receipts fell 48 cents,
or 2.9 percent, to $16.17 at 9:56 a.m. in New York Stock
Exchange composite trading. In Sao Paulo trading, Brasil Foods
rose for a seventh day yesterday, gaining 0.1 percent to 25.93
reais. Markets in Brazil were closed today for a holiday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
