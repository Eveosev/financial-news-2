Oil declined for the first day in
four in New York as investors speculated U.S. fuel demand may
weaken after the  Federal Reserve  lowered its economic growth
outlook for world’s biggest crude-consuming nation.  Futures slipped as much as 1.5 percent after Fed officials
yesterday cut their forecasts for growth and employment this
year and next. An Energy Department report showed U.S. oil
stockpiles fell less than forecast and inventories at Cushing,
 Oklahoma , the delivery point for the New York-traded West Texas
Intermediate grade, increased for the first time in four weeks.  “The fundamental story across the board is of limited
growth,” said  Jonathan Barratt , managing director of Commodity
Broking Services Pty in Sydney, who predicted prices will
average $100 a barrel this year. “We’ve got plenty of crude.
It’s got to be a geopolitical event” to push crude above $100 a
barrel again, he said.  Oil for August delivery declined as much as $1.41 to $94 a
barrel in electronic trading on the  New York  Mercantile Exchange
and was at $94.15 at 4 p.m. Sydney time. The contract yesterday
rose $1.24, or 1.3 percent, to $95.41. Prices are 23 percent
higher the past year.  Brent crude  for August delivery fell $1.16, or 1 percent,
to $113.05 a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures Europe
exchange. The contract yesterday climbed $3.26, or 2.9 percent,
to $114.21. It was the biggest gain since May 9. Prices are up
48 percent the past year.  Growth Forecasts  Fed governors and regional-bank presidents now say the  U.S.
economy  will expand by 2.7 percent to 2.9 percent this year,
down from April’s forecasts of 3.1 percent to 3.3 percent, based
on the median range of projections. Growth in 2012 will range
from 3.3 percent to 3.7 percent, compared with forecasts of 3.5
percent to 4.2 percent in April, the Fed said.  Central bankers raised their forecast range for the
 unemployment rate  to average 8.6 percent to 8.9 percent in the
fourth quarter of 2011, compared with projections of 8.4 percent
to 8.7 percent in April.  U.S. crude stockpiles fell 1.71 million barrels to 363.8
million last week, according to the Energy Department report.
They were forecast to decline 1.83 million barrels, a Bloomberg
News survey of analysts showed. Supplies at Cushing climbed
273,000 barrels.  Distillate inventories, a category which includes heating
oil and diesel, rose 1.17 million barrels, compared with a
median forecast for a 550,000-barrel gain.  Gasoline supplies unexpectedly slid 464,000 barrels to
214.6 million, the Energy Department report showed. They were
projected to increase by 1 million barrels, according to the
median estimate of 17 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg News.  Brent, the European benchmark contract, traded at a premium
of $18.90 a barrel to U.S. futures today. The difference between
front-month contracts in  London  and New York reached a record
close of $22.29 on June 15.  To contact the reporter on this story:
