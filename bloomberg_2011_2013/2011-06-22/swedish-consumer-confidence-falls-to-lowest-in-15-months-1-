Swedish households grew less
confident about growth prospects in the largest Nordic economy
after the central bank raised  interest rates  and signaled more
increases are to come.  The consumer confidence index fell to 16.7 in June, the
lowest since March 2010, from 17.9 the previous month, the
National Institute of Economic Research said today in  Stockholm .
The gauge was expected to ease to 17, according to the median
estimate in a Bloomberg survey of 15 economists. Manufacturing
confidence was unchanged at 11, unchanged from May, NIER said.  The institute also today raised its forecast for economic
growth this year to 4.4 percent from 4.2 percent in a March. It
still expects the central bank to bring the benchmark interest
rate to 2.25 percent by the end of 2011 and 3 percent by the end
of next year, it said.  The bank has raised rates six times since July, bringing
the benchmark repo rate to 1.75 percent in April, and signaled
it will continue to tighten monetary policy as it seeks to keep
inflation within its 2 percent target and prevent credit-driven
imbalances in the  property market .  The krona traded 0.1 percent higher against the euro at
9.1530 at 9:48 a.m. in Stockholm. Against the dollar, the krona
rose was little changed at 6.3566.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
