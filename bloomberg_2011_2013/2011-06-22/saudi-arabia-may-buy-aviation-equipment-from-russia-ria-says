Saudi Arabia  may buy weapons from
Russia, RIA Novosti reported, citing an official from
Rosoboronexport, Russiaâ€™s state-owned arms-selling agency.  The possible purchases include aviation equipment, the
state news service cited Sergei Kornev as saying today at the
Paris Air Show.  Russia said in September 2009 it was discussing weapons
sales to Saudi Arabia after RIA reported that the Saudis may
spend $2 billion on the S-400 missile-defense system, tanks and
helicopters.  Prime Minister  Vladimir Putin  made the first visit to Saudi
Arabia by a Russian head of state in 2007 when he was president.
The Persian Gulf state has long been an important U.S. ally in
the region.  To contact the reporter on this story:
