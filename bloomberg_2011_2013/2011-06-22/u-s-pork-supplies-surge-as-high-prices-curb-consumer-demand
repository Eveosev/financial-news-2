Pork stockpiles in the U.S. surged
22 percent at the end of May from a year earlier, the
government said, as high meat prices curbed demand from
consumers.  Warehouses held 545.1 million pounds of pork on May 31,
up from 446 million a year earlier, the  U.S. Department of
Agriculture  said today in a report. Inventories fell 0.8
percent from the end of April.  Wholesale-pork prices reached 98.31 cents a pound on May
16, the highest level since at least 1997, USDA data show.
Consumers may be eating more chicken instead of pork because
the meat is cheaper, said  Rich Nelson , the director of
research at Allendale Inc. in McHenry, Illinois.  “Last month was a big letdown, in terms of consumer
demand” for pork, Nelson said in an interview before the
report. Grilling demand shrank because “we had the problem of
cooler-than-expected weather, and also high  gas prices , and
chicken was still very cheap at the time,” he said.  Hog futures for August settlement fell 0.675 cent, or 0.7
percent, to 97.3 cents a pound at 12:54 p.m. on the  Chicago 
Mercantile Exchange. Before today, the price gained 16 percent
in the past year.  As of May 31, stockpiles of  pork bellies , which are cured
and sliced to make bacon, were 28 percent higher than a year
earlier at 56.5 million pounds, according to today’s report.
Warehouse supplies of ham rose 9.2 percent to 101.5 million
pounds.  Chicken-meat inventories at the end of May were 9.8
percent larger than a year earlier at 760.4 million pounds,
the USDA said. Beef supplies rose 25 percent to 453.8 million
pounds.  To contact the reporter on this story:
