The Dutch parliament passed
legislation to prevent phone companies such as Royal KPN NV from
charging clients extra for using Internet applications such as
Skype and from limiting access to websites on mobile handsets.  The “net neutrality” measure would allow companies to
charge for the amount or speed of data traffic and prohibits the
blocking of Internet sites that drive revenue to other
businesses. Operators would also be prevented from charging more
for the use of applications such as Skype that allow voice calls
over the Internet and messaging applications such as WhatsApp.  Telecommunications operators’ revenue is under pressure as
clients make voice calls via the Internet and use Internet
applications to chat. The phone companies are looking for ways
to cope with increasing data traffic on networks.  KPN, the largest Dutch phone company, has said it doesn’t
plan to charge customers for the use of applications such as
WhatsApp, though it did want to charge for voice calls via the
Internet. The legislation must be passed by the Senate before
becoming law.  To contact the reporter on this story:
