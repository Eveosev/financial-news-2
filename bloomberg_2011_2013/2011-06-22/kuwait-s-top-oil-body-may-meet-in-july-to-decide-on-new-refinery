Kuwait ’s Supreme Petroleum Council,
the country’s highest decision-making body for oil policy, is
due to meet in July to decide on building a refinery to meet
domestic fuel demand, the Chairman of Kuwait Oil Co. said.  “I hope it will be approved,” Sami al-Rushaid told
reporters in London today. “I don’t think it will be the case
that there’ll be no new refinery. There may be some requirement
to give a portion of it to the private sector.”  The project to build Kuwait’s fourth refinery, now
estimated to cost about 4 billion dinars ($15 billion), was put
on hold in March 2009 after the emirate signed letters of intent
with international companies. The government came under pressure
from opposition lawmakers who claimed the awarding of the
contracts circumvented the law by not going through the Central
Tenders Committee.  Kuwait may create the new refinery, known as Al-Zour, in
the form of a public shareholding company in order to expand the
role of private investment, the state news agency KUNA reported
in July, citing former minister for development, Sheikh Ahmad
al-Fahad al-Sabah.  To contact the reporter on this story:
