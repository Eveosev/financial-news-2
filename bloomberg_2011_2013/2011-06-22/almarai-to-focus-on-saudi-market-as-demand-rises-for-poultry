Almarai Co.,  Saudi Arabia ’ largest
food producer by market value, isn’t planning to expand in other
countries in the  Middle East  this year as it strengthens
domestic sales of poultry and dairy products.  “We have currently no plan for geographical expansion,”
Chief Financial Officer Georges Schorderet said in response to
e-mailed questions. The company allocated as much as 2.8 billion
riyals ($750 million) in capital expenditure this year, he said.  Almarai is focusing on domestic sales as demand for
poultry, juices and dairy products increase in the Arab world’s
largest economy. Almarai’s board approved investing 4 billion
riyals in poultry, doubling an initial allocation of 2 billion
riyals, which was approved in April 2010, according to a
statement on the  Saudi bourse website  yesterday.  This investment “will position the company to take full
advantage of the opportunity within the poultry market,” the
company said in a separate e-mailed statement today. It will
“be financed through  cash flow  and is in the line of company’s
objectives.”  In April, Schorderet said Almarai’s first-quarter earnings
were affected by unrest in the Middle East and it expects 2011
to be a challenging year. In October 2009, the company bought
International Company for Agro Industrial Projects, an Egyptian
dairy products producer, as part of plans to expand across the
region.  Almarai’s first-quarter profit missed analysts’ estimates,
rising to 235.2 million riyals from 234.1 million riyals a year
earlier, according to a company statement on April 5.  To contact the reporter on this story:
