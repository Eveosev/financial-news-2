Kelvin Tay, Singapore-based chief
investment strategist at UBS Wealth Management, said Chinese
demand for commodities will remain strong. He spoke in Singapore
today at a briefing on the economic outlook for  Asia .  “On a short-term basis, your demand for base metals is
actually still very strong and it’s not going to change because
they’ve tightened on the  property market , but they’re investing
a lot in construction and the social housing market.  So you take away from the left hand and give it to the
right. So the demand is still there. We believe that core prices,
even though they have softened recently, will remain very very
resilient.”  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
