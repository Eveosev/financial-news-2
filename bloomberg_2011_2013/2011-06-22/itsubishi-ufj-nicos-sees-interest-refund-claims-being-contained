Mitsubishi UFJ Nicos Co. will be
able to meet claims from borrowers seeking refunds of
overcharged interest without setting aside extra reserves,
President Tetsuya Wada said.  The credit card unit of  Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group Inc. (8306) ,
 Japan â€™s largest publicly traded bank, will meet its net income
target of 39 billion yen ($486 million) for the year ending
March 2014, Wada said in an interview in  Tokyo .  Mitsubishi UFJ Nicos saw no surge in claims for repayment
of overpaid interest following the bankruptcy of consumer lender
Takefuji Corp. last September, Wada said. Claims dropped by 20
percent to 30 percent in the three months ended March from a
year earlier.  Consumer lenders in Japan have had to pay back overcharged
interest, reduce interest and restrict lending following a
government crackdown to protect borrowers.  To contact the reporter on this story:
