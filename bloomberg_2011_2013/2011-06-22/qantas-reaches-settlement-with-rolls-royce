Qantas Airways Ltd. (QAN)  said it had
reached an agreement with Rolls-Royce Holdings Plc in relation
to the disruption incurred as a result of the failure of a
Rolls-Royce Trent 900 engine on Nov. 4 and the subsequent
temporary grounding of Qantas’ entire A380 fleet.  The settlement includes the discontinuance of the legal
proceedings and while the terms of the agreement are
confidential, the profit and loss impact of the settlement,
which will be recognized in Qantas’ financial results for the
2011 financial year, is A$95 million, the company said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
