Japanese and Australian stock
futures fell after the  Federal Reserve  lowered its forecast for
growth in the world’s biggest economy and as commodities dropped.  American depositary receipts of Canon Inc., the world’s
largest camera maker that gets about 28 percent of its sales in
the Americas, dropped 0.5 percent from the closing share price
in  Tokyo . Those of Sharp Corp., Japan’s biggest maker of liquid-
crystal displays, declined 1 percent. ADRs of BHP Billiton Ltd.,
the world’s largest mining company and Australia’s No. 1 oil
producer, slid 0.2 percent.  Futures on Japan’s  Nikkei 225 (NKY)  Stock Average expiring in
September closed at 9,555 in Chicago yesterday, compared with
9,610 in Osaka, Japan. They were bid in the pre-market at 9,560
in  Osaka  at 8:05 a.m. local time. Futures on Australia’s S&P/ASX
200 Index dropped 0.4 percent today. New Zealand’s NZX 50 Index
gained 0.1 percent in Wellington.  “Stocks have almost priced in the U.S. economic soft patch,
but it should take a while to identify whether the economy will
worsen further or not,” said Mitsushige Akino, who oversees
about $600 million in Tokyo at Ichiyoshi Investment Management
Co.  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index slipped 0.3
percent today. In New York, the index lost 0.7 percent to
1,287.14 yesterday.  Fed officials lowered their forecasts for U.S. growth and
employment this year and next, projecting the economy will
expand by between 2.7 percent and 2.9 percent this year, down
from forecasts ranging from 3.1 percent to 3.3 percent in April.
Inflation, excluding food and energy, will be somewhat higher
than previously forecast, policymakers said. They said the pace
of recovery is likely to “pick up over coming quarters.”  ‘Moderate Pace’  “The economic recovery is continuing at a moderate pace,
though somewhat more slowly than the committee had expected,”
the  Federal Open Market Committee  said yesterday in a statement.
“The committee will complete its purchases of $600 billion of
longer-term  Treasury securities  by the end of this month and
will maintain its existing policy of reinvesting principal
payments from its securities holdings.”  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index lost 4.2 percent this year
through yesterday, compared with a gain of 2.3 percent by the
 S&P 500  and a drop of 2.8 percent by the Stoxx Europe 600 Index.
Stocks in the Asian benchmark are valued at 13.5 times estimated
earnings on average, compared with 12.9 times for the S&P 500
and 10.9 times for the Stoxx 600.  Crude for August delivery fell as much as 1.2 percent to
$94.30 a barrel in electronic trading in  New York  today. Copper
for delivery in three months dropped 0.7 percent in  London 
yesterday.  To contact the reporters on this story:
