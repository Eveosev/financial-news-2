Bed Bath & Beyond Inc. (BBBY)  gained in New
York trading after saying profit in its current fiscal year will
gain more than the retailer previously expected as sales climb.  The shares gained $1.27, or 2.3 percent, to $55.33 at 5
p.m., after the close of regular Nasdaq Stock Market composite
trading. The Union, New Jersey-based company’s shares had
advanced 10 percent this year.  Earnings per share will rise 15 percent to 20 percent in
the year ending February 2012, accelerating from a previous
projection of 10 percent to 15 percent, Bed Bath & Beyond said
today in a statement. That translates into profit of as much as
$3.68 a share, topping the $3.54 average estimate of 23 analysts
in a Bloomberg survey. Profit was $3.07 a share last year.  Chief Executive Officer Steven Temares increased the home-
furnishings retailer’s revenue 9.7 percent to $2.11 billion in
the first quarter, exceeding analysts’ estimates. Sales at
stores open at least 12 months climbed 7 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
