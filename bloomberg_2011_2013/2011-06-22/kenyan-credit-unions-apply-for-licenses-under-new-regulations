All but five of Kenya’s 219 deposit-
taking  credit unions  applied for licenses under regulations
introduced a year ago that set a deadline of June 17, the
industry regulator said.  Savings and credit cooperatives, or saccos, account for
about one-third of savings in East Africa’s biggest economy. The
deposit-taking saccos had assets worth 171.3 billion shillings
($1.9 billion) at the end of last year, while another 3,756
cooperatives that don’t collect deposits had assets of 39
billion shillings, Carilus Ademba, chief executive officer of
the Nairobi-based  Sacco Societies Regulatory Authority , said in
an e-mailed statement today.  The new regulations aim at “enhancing governance,
accountability and transparency” at the cooperatives, he said.  Savings held by the saccos have risen at an average pace of
20 percent annually over the last five years, as Kenyans were
attracted by the lending rates they offer, which are lower than
banks, Ademba said in March.  Kenya ’s President Mwai Kibaki and
the country’s economic policy makers have urged banks to cut
borrowing costs in order to boost economic growth.  To contact the reporter on this story:
