Fidelity Investments , the second-
biggest U.S. mutual fund company, is starting four funds with
defined liquidation dates that invest in municipal bonds, the
first actively managed pools of this type.  The funds have defined end dates in 2015, 2017, 2019 and
2021, and will buy investment grade municipal bonds with
maturities close to those dates, Mark Sommer, one of the
portfolio managers, said in an interview yesterday.  Fidelity, based in Boston, is targeting investors who have
purchased municipal-bond funds in the past and are seeking to
invest over fixed periods, to meet obligations such as college
tuition or  retirement plans . The funds are designed to have
declining interest-rate sensitivity, protecting investors from
an increase in borrowing costs near the maturity date, Sommer
said.  “If you were to buy a traditional bond fund, even for a
shorter duration, and rates were to go up dramatically just on
the eve of when you needed your money, the value of those bond
funds would go down,” Sommer said. Fidelity’s new funds “will
start out at longer durations and then gradually decline to
somewhere near zero.”  States and municipalities have sold about half of the
amount of securities this year compared with the same period in
2010, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
