New York Mets shortstop  Jose Reyes 
won’t negotiate a new contract until the Major League Baseball
season is over.  “It’s not about the money,” Reyes said on the team’s
website. “I don’t want any distractions. I just want to
continue to play. We’re going to have plenty of time in the
offseason to make this happen.”  Reyes, who is in the option season of his four-year $23.25
million contract, leads the National League with a .336 batting
average and 12 triples. He’s also scored 54 runs and has 103 hits.  Mets General Manager  Sandy Alderson  said he’ll respect the
28-year-old player’s decision.  Reyes went 0-for-5 in New York’s 7-3 loss to the Oakland
Athletics last night. The Mets fell to 35-38 with the loss,
while the Athletics improved to 34-40.  The Mets are fourth in the five-team NL East, 10 1/2 games
behind the division-leading  Philadelphia Phillies .  To contact the reporter on this story:
