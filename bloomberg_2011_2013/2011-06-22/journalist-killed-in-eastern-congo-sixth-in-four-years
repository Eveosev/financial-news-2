A Democratic Republic of Congo radio
journalist was shot dead overnight in eastern North Kivu
province, the sixth journalist killed in the region since 2007.  Kambale Musonia, 29, a reporter for Community Radio of
South Lubero, was shot three times in the chest by unknown
assailants about 200 meters from his home, Jean Maliro, director
of the radio station, said today. The attackers have not been
caught, police said.  “It’s difficult to know right now if it’s because he was a
journalist,” Maliro said by phone from Kirumba, where the
station is based. “He covered all kinds of news including
politics.”  More than a dozen rebel groups are based in Eastern Congo,
where conflict has persisted since the mid 1990s.  To contact the reporter on this story:
