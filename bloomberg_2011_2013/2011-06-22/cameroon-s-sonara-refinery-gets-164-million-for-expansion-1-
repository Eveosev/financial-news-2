Cameroon’s Sonara oil refinery, the
lone crude processor in the central African nation, will receive
75 billion  CFA francs  ($164 million) from eight banks to fund
its expansion, said Charles Metouk, the general manager.  The refinery, based in Limbe, about 350 kilometers (217
miles) southwest of the capital, Yaounde, will increase capacity
to 4 million metric tons by 2015 from the current 2.1 million
tons, he told reporters in the port city of Douala yesterday.  The lenders include U.K.-based  Standard Chartered Plc (STAN) ,
 Societe Generale (GLE)  SA’s unit in Cameroon, Lome-based Banque
Atlantique and Commercial Bank Cameroon, Metouk said.  The refinery, which is currently able to only process light
crude, will be able to refine heavy crude after the
refurbishment, the type pumped in Cameroon, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
