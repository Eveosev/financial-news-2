BP Plc (BP/) , which pumps about 60 percent
of  Trinidad and Tobago ’s natural gas, shut an offshore platform
for maintenance to meet stricter safety standards, Energy
Minister Carolyn Seepersad-Bachan said.  “Since the Gulf of Mexico incident there have been
instituted a number of new safety measures,” Seepersad-Bachan
said yesterday in an interview in  London . “They are moving
their infrastructure to the level of safety that they have now
set for themselves in the global environment.”  Mark Salt, a London-based spokesman at BP, confirmed the
Mahogany A platform is shut for routine work in an e-mail
yesterday evening.  BP, which produces about  10 percent  of its oil and gas in
the country, has been assessing its facilities since the  Gulf of
Mexico  oil spill last year, the worst in U.S. history. The
company plans to maintain its extraction in Trinidad and Tobago
at about  500,000 barrels  of oil equivalent a day.  Both Salt and Seepersad-Bachan declined to say when the
platform will resume operations.  BP said in March it planned to start gas extraction at
Trinidad’s Serrette deposit this quarter.  To contact the reporter on this story:
