Samsung Electronics Co. lost a bid
to convince a federal judge it should be able to examine samples
of  Apple Inc. (AAPL) ’s new products, including fourth-generation mobile
telephones and tablet computers.  As part of the discovery process in a patent-infringement
lawsuit brought by Cupertino, California-based Apple, Samsung in
May asked to see its rival’s latest iPads and iPhones, according
to court papers.  “Samsung has cited no case” in which a plaintiff must
produce future products in a similar context, and “Samsung does
not need access to these products” at this stage in the
litigation, U.S. District Judge Lucy H. Koh wrote in an order
signed yesterday in  San Jose , California.  Apple sued Korea’s Samsung this year alleging unfair trade
competition, unjust enrichment and trademark and patent
infringement in products that “blatantly imitate” Apple’s
products, according to an amended complaint filed June 16.  The case is Apple Inc. v. Samsung Electronics Co.,
11CV1846, U.S. District Court, Northern District of  California 
(San Jose).  To contact the reporter on this story:
