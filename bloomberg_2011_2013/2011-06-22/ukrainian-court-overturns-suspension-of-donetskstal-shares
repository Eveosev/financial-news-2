A Ukrainian court overturned a May
20 decision by the Securities and Stock Market State
Commission to suspend PrAT  Donetskstal  shares, the eastern
Ukrainian metal producer said.  The commission halted trading of Donetskstal and its
units, including Yasynivka Coke and Pokrovske Mine, on May 20
for as long as a year to “protect the rights of shareholders
and prevent the widening of a corporate conflict.”  The Donetsk-based court yesterday ruled in favor of a May
30 appeal that argued the commission’s decision was illegal,
Donetskstal said today in a  statement  on its website.  “Donetskstal’s lawyers expect the commission to appeal
this ruling within 10 days, but think the lower court’s
positive verdict will remain in place,” said Kiev-based
investment bank Dragon Capital in an e-mailed note to clients.
“The news is very positive for the aforementioned stocks. We
expect trading activity with these shares to resume next
month.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
