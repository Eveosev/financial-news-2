The following companies had unusual
price changes in Bogota trading. Stock symbols are in
parentheses and prices are as of 4 p.m. New York time.  The IGBC Index rose 0.5 percent to 14,274.10 while the
Colcap Index added 0.7 percent to 1,721.61. IGBC data
“inconsistencies” were resolved after a lapse today and the
index’s calculations are again accurate, said an official for
the Bolsa de Valores de Colombia, operator of the country’s main
securities exchange, who can’t be identified because of company
policy.  Canacol Energy Ltd. (CNEC)  , the Calgary-based  oil
company  that operates fields in  South America , rose 1.2 percent
to 2,065 pesos, a one-week high. The company announced the start
of its heavy oil exploration drilling program on two contracts
in southern Colombia, according to a statement on the company’s
website.  Mineros SA (MINEROS)  , Colombia’s largest gold producer,
rose 2.1 percent, the most in two weeks, to 6,360 pesos as gold
rose to a seven-week high on fluctuations in  currency markets 
that boosted demand for the precious metal as an alternative
investment.  Pacific Rubiales Energy Corp. (PRE)  , the Toronto-based
oil producer that operates fields in Colombia, rose 0.7 percent
to 49,420 pesos, contributing to the biggest three-day gain
since April 7. Investors are betting the stock’s decline last
month was overdone and are expecting positive news when the
company announces details of future dividend payments, said
Camilo Rubiano, head of research at brokerage Afin SA.  To contact the reporter on this story:
