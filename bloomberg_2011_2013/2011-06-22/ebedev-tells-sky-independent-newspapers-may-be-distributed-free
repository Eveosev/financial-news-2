Alexander Lebedev , owner of
Britain’s Independent newspapers and the London Evening
Standard, told Sky News in an interview that his newspapers are
looking to expand online and he “wouldn’t exclude” the
possibility of print versions of the Independent titles being
given away, as the Evening Standard is now.  The newspapers are seeking “opportunities” online, and
there are no plans to charge online readers, Lebedev said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
