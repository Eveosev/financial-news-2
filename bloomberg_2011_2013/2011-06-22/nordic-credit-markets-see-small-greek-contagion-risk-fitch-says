Most Nordic credit market
participants don’t see a high risk that  Europe ’s debt crisis
will spread beyond  Greece , Ireland and  Portugal , according to a
survey conducted in the region by  Fitch Ratings .  The survey showed 64 percent of credit-market participants
in the Nordic region see a “medium” risk that Europe’s credit
crisis will spread to Spain, Italy or  Belgium , the rating
company said today in a statement. Some 15 percent found the
risk low, while 21 percent said it was high.  “Most market participants do not see a high risk of
further euro-zone contagion but they do believe the protracted
euro-zone crisis is the main threat to European credit market
stability,” Fitch said.  Concern that Greece will trigger a deeper debt crisis in
the region was greatest in Copenhagen and lowest in Helsinki,
Fitch said. Denmark is the only country in the region in a
recession, after consumers cut spending and investment fell last
quarter.  “Some 40 percent of delegates said that sovereign debt
problems were the greatest risk to the European credit markets
over the next 12 months,” Fitch said. “However, threats to the
markets from a potential double-dip recession or the end of
credit market easing,” such as the U.S. quantitative easing,
“were ranked close runners-up, with 30 percent of votes each.”  Fitch based the conclusions on delegate voting survey taken
at its seminars in the four capitals of the Nordic region last
week, it said in a statement.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
