German households’ private savings
rose to a record in 2010, the  Bild-Zeitung  reported, citing
estimates by the BDB private bank federation.  Total private savings grew to 4.93 trillion euros ($7.1
trillion) by the end 2010, equal to a per-capita value of 61,100
euros and a 5 percent growth on 2009, the newspaper said. Just 5
percent of the saved wealth was invested in shares, Bild said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
