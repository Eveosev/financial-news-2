Kuwait Oil Co. Chairman Sami al- Rushaid reaffirmed the nation’s production capacity target of 4
million barrels a day for 2020 and said this goal will be
sustained to 2030.  The Persian Gulf emirate aims to produce 60,000 barrels a
day of heavy oil by 2016, he said at a conference in  London 
today. He also said he expects a “slight increase” in crude
demand during the summer months.  To contact the reporters on this story:
