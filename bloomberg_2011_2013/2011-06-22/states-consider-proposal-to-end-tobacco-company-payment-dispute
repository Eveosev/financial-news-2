State attorneys general are
considering a proposal to end a fight with  tobacco companies 
over $7.1 billion in payments due under a 1998 settlement. The
accord with 46 states required the companies to pay
$206 billion to resolve any liability in healthcare-cost
lawsuits.  The fight over $7.1 billion in payments under the 13-year-
old accord stemmed in part from tobacco company claims that
erosion of market share has limited their liability. State
officials are scheduled to discuss the dispute at a meeting
today in  Chicago .  No agreement with the companies has been reached, state
officials said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
