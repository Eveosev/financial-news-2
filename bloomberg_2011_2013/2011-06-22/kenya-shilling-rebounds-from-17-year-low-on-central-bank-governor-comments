Kenya ’s shilling rebounded from a
17-year low after Reuters cited the country’s central bank
governor Njuguna Ndung’u as saying the regulator is ready to
take “appropriate and corrective” action to curb speculation.  The shilling gained as much as 2.2 percent to 89.58 per the
dollar and was trading 0.2 percent stronger at 91.40 by 3:35
p.m. in Nairobi, the capital. Yesterday, the currency of East
Africa’s biggest economy closed at 91.58, the weakest level
since March 1994, when the nation abolished exchange controls
and allowed the currency to trade freely.  The European debt crisis, expectations of low domestic food
supplies, and speculation by currency traders are weakening the
currency, Ndung’u said, according to Reuters, without specifying
which actions the bank will take.  “The comments from the central bank governor urging
caution against speculation contributed to the strengthening,”
Solomon Alubala, a trader at Co-operative Bank of Kenya, said by
phone from the capital Nairobi today. “In the past the central
bank has taken a hands-off approach, as the shilling has been
losing, and now they are signalling they are ready to take
action.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
