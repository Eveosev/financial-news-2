Diamond Bank Plc (DIAMONDB) , Nigeria’s ninth-
largest lender by market value, may have reduced 2011 earnings
as it cuts bad debt in a “clean-up year” for the lender, said
Chief Financial Officer Abdulrahman Yinusa.  The bank is aiming to lower its ratio of non-performing
loans to 5 percent “and below” from 14.8 percent a year
earlier after selling some to the state-owned company set up to
buy debt, Yinusa said in an interview in London yesterday.  “We believe 2011 is a clean-up year,” Yinusa said. “Then
we will see returns.”  Shares of Nigerian lenders plunged after a debt crisis in
2008 and 2009 resulting from loans to domestic stock
speculators. Central Bank of  Nigeria  Governor Lamido Sanusi
fired the chief executives of eight of the country’s 24 lenders,
bailed out the industry with 620 billion naira ($4 billion) and
set up Asset Management Corp. of Nigeria to buy bad debts from
lenders. Diamond Bank was not bailed out.  The lender will reach “normal performance” after about 30
billion naira of credit-related writedowns and disposals of
subsidiaries this year, and the Lagos-based bank will generate
around 15 percent to 20 percent return on earnings, he said.  The bank reported 2010 net income through December of 1.3
billion naira compared with a loss of 16.8 billion naira the
previous year, after reducing its non-performing loan ratio to
14.8 percent from 18.3 percent in 2009.  To contact the reporter on this story:
