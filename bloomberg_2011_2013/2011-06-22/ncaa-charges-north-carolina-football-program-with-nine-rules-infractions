The University of North Carolina
football program has been accused by the  National Collegiate
Athletic Association  of nine rules infractions.  “We made mistakes, and we have to face that,” Chancellor
Holden Thorp said in a statement on the school’s website. “We
will emerge with a stronger athletics program, and we will
restore confidence in Carolina football.”  The  Chapel Hill , North Carolina-based school has 90 days to
answer the allegations, which follow a 12-month probe by the
NCAA. School officials were told to appear before the NCAA’s
Committee on Infractions in Indianapolis on Oct. 28.  “We will gather the information the NCAA has requested and
prepare to address the notice with the NCAA in the fall,”
Athletic Director Dick Baddour said in a statement. “We have a
strong staff that will help get us through this.”  Among the charges is an accusation of unethical conduct by
former assistant coach John Blake, an alumna and former student-
athlete.  Blake, who resigned in September after the Tar Heels’
season opener, is charged with lying about his relationship with
former National Football League agent Gary Wichard, who died in
March.  “I feel terrible that these allegations occurred under my
watch,” said head coach Butch Davis. “The responsibility for
correcting any problems that put us in this position is mine,
and I take that responsibility very seriously.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
