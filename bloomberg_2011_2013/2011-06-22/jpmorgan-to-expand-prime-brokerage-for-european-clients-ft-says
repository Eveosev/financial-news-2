JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM)  will today
launch a full prime brokerage service for hedge fund clients in
 Europe , three years after it bought Bear Stearns’s U.S. business
in March 2008, the Financial Times reported.  “The right moment came in 2008, when we acquired the
platform, and we haven’t stopped investing in it,” Jes Staley,
head of JPMorgan’s investment bank said, according to the FT.  To contact the reporter on this story:
