The U.K.’s Debt Management Office
isn’t “too concerned” about the risk of contagion from
ruptures in other bond markets, according to chief executive
officer Robert Stheeman.  “We’re always mindful of the potential for spillover from
other parts of the world,” Stheeman said yesterday in an
interview at the Euromoney Global Borrowers and Investors Forum
in  London . “But at the moment we’re not too concerned. We have
received anecdotal evidence that overseas demand has been quite
strong, that we’ve also been the beneficiaries of safe-haven
flows.”  U.K. government bonds rose, sending the yield on the 10-
year gilts down three basis points to 3.19 percent today after
it earlier reached 3.15 percent, the lowest this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
