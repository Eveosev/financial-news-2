CABB, a specialty chemical maker
owned by Bridgepoint Private Equity Ltd., agreed to buy KemFine
from 3i Group Plc for about 140 million euros ($200 million),
said a person with knowledge of the transaction.  The deal ends an almost seven-year investment, during which
the buyout firm increased revenue by 80 percent and more than
doubled profit, 3i said in a statement earlier today, without
disclosing the price.  “This acquisition will further strengthen our leading
market position, particularly in the area of custom
manufacturing and tolling for the European and global life
science majors,” CABB Chief Executive Officer Martin
Wienkenhover said in the statement.  The purchase gives CABB a custom manufacturer of fine
chemicals with a shared customer base spanning the drug,
personal care and agrochemical industries, and sales of 81
million euros. Bridgepoint acquired CABB from Axa Private Equity
earlier this year for an undisclosed sum, saying that it planned
to make targeted bolt-on acquisitions to grow the business.  CABB reported sales of 311 million euros last year  Valence Group advised Bridgepoint on today’s deal.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
