Irish and Portuguese bonds fell amid
speculation Greek Prime Minister  George Papandreou ’s confidence-
vote victory doesn’t signal an end to the euro region’s
sovereign debt crisis.  Ireland’s two- and 10-year yields rose to all-time highs,
while Portugal’s two- and 10-year yields reached records.
Attention now turns to whether Papandreou can push through
parliamentary approval next week of a 78 billion-euro ($112
billion) package of budget cuts to stave off the threat of
default. German bunds rose as investors sought the euro area’s
safest assets.  “The market is still wary, despite the Greek confidence
vote,” said Eric Wand, a fixed-income strategist at Lloyds Bank
Corporate Markets in London. “The austerity measures may have a
much rougher ride getting through parliament. The market is a
bit concerned that the situation hasn’t greatly changed, and the
periphery is still vulnerable.”  Portuguese 10-year yields rose 18 basis points to 11.31
percent as of 4:27 p.m. in  London  after reaching 11.36 percent.
Two-year note yields added 49 basis points to to 13.71 percent.
They earlier touched 13.75 percent. Irish 10-year yields jumped
32 basis points to 11.72 percent. The two-year note yield
reached a euro-era high of 13.25 percent, up 48 basis points
from yesterday.  The  International Monetary Fund , contributor of a third of
the bailout money for  Greece  and the two other euro-area
countries that have received bailouts, Ireland and Portugal, has
warned European Union leaders that a failure to take decisive
action on the debt crisis risks triggering “large global
spillovers.”  Greek Notes Drop  Greek two-year notes dropped, erasing an earlier advance
made after Papandreou’s victory paved the way for the country to
implement austerity measures needed to receive further aid.  Papandreou reshuffled his cabinet and sought the approval
of the chamber after fending off a revolt within his socialist
Pasok party last week. A total of 155 Greek lawmakers supported
the motion in the 300-seat parliament in  Athens  early this
morning, with 143 voting against, the speaker, Filippos Petsalnikos, said.  European finance ministers said this week that they would
withhold approval of a 12 billion-euro payment to the country
promised for July until passage of the plans to cut the deficit,
sell state assets and impose a “crisis levy” on wages.  European Commission President  Jose Barroso  said the vote
“removes an element of uncertainty from an already very
difficult situation.” He said in an e-mailed statement from
Brussels it was “good news for Greece and for the European
Union as a whole.”  Austerity  Greek two-year note yields, which surpassed 30 percent for
the first time last week, rose 25 basis points to 27.89 percent.
They reached as low as 27.23 percent earlier. The 4.6 percent
security due May 2013 fell 0.45, or 4.50 euros per 1,000-euro
face amount, to 68.815. The 10-year bond yield dropped 12 basis
points to 16.85 percent. It rose to a euro-era record 18.35
percent on June 17.  “Attention will turn to next week’s vote on the austerity
package,” said  Huw Worthington , a fixed-income strategist at
 Barclays Capital  in London. “It looks like that will be passed.
Then, they’ll get the money in July and we may see a bit of a
relief rally.”  Greek Losses  Greek and Portuguese securities have lost 19 percent in
2011, while Irish debt has dropped 10 percent, according to
indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the European Federation of
Financial Analysts Societies. German  government bonds  have
returned 0.2 percent, while Treasuries gained 3.2 percent, the
indexes show.  The cost of insuring European sovereign debt against
default rose on concern Greece may still struggle to pass
austerity measures needed to secure further international aid.  Swaps on Greece rose 36 basis points to 1,933, according to
CMA. That implies an 81 percent chance of default within five
years. Contracts on Ireland jumped 12 basis points to 748,
 Portugal  increased 17 to 769 and  Italy  climbed 10.5 to 178,
while  Spain  rose 7 to 275.  German bunds rose as the nation sold 3.4 billion euros of
10-year bonds at an average yield of 2.96 percent.  Germany ’s 10-year bund yield was three basis points lower
at 2.95 percent. It declined to 2.91 percent on June 16, the
lowest since Jan. 11. Yields on two-year notes were five basis
points lower, at 1.49 percent. They dropped to 1.43 percent on
June 16, the lowest since Feb. 22.  Investors bid for 1.55 times the amount of German 10-year
bunds on offer. That compares with a co-called bid-to-cover
ratio of 1.70 at the previous auction of the same securities
held on May 25, which were allotted at a yield of 3.04 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
