Wheat futures gained for a second
day on speculation three weeks of declines have attracted buyers
amid concern that wet weather in  Canada  may cut acreage, curbing
supply from the world’s fourth-largest shipper.  September delivery wheat gained as much as 0.8 percent to
$7.11 a bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade, before trading at
$7.1025 a bushel at 3:45 p.m. in  Singapore . The contract slumped
16 percent in the first 20 days of this month.  Japan  plans to purchase 103,252 metric tons of wheat from
Canada and Australia in a regular tender on June 23, according
to the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries. The
nation is the second-largest wheat buyer in Asia after Indonesia,
according to the  U.S. Department of Agriculture .  “The wheat complex is higher due to buying on dips,” said
Ker Chung Yang, an analyst at Phillip Futures Pte., in a report
e-mailed today. Prices also rose as sentiment spilled over from
other markets, he said.  Asian stocks rose, driving the region’s key index up for a
second day as Greek Prime Minister  George Papandreou  won a
parliamentary confidence vote, moving the country a step closer
to avoiding a default on its debt.  Grain planting in Canada is about 87 percent complete, and
“little additional” acreage likely will be planted because the
crop-insurance deadline across the prairies has lapsed, the
Canadian Wheat Board said June 20.  Corn for December delivery rose as much as 0.7 percent to
$6.85 a bushel in Chicago, before trading unchanged at $6.8025.
Soybeans for November delivery slipped 0.2 percent to $13.465 a
bushel.  To contact the reporter on this story:
