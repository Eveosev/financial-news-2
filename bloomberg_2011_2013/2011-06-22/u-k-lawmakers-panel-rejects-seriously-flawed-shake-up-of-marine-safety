U.K. government proposals to cut the
number of coastguard centers while removing funding from
emergency towing ships and marine firefighters were rejected by
a cross-party panel of lawmakers.  The plans should be redrawn to protect the safety of ships
and mariners and prevent pollution, the  House of Commons
Transport Committee  said in a report today.  “We accept there is a need for some modernization, but the
government’s proposals for the future of the Coastguard Service
are seriously flawed,” the committee chairwoman, Louise Ellman,
said in an e-mailed statement. “We found little support for the
current proposals and we have no confidence that, under these
proposals, the coastguard will in future be able to respond to
emergencies at sea as well as they do now, let alone in a more
effective way.”  The Department for Transport started a  consultation  in
December 2010 on the proposed changes, which include closing 10
of the 18 Maritime Rescue Coordination Centres around the
British coast, with all but three of the remaining eight working
during daylight hours only.  The existing contract for three emergency tugs will not be
renewed, Chancellor of the Exchequer  George Osborne  announced in
his October 2010 spending review. Funding for the  Maritime
Incident Response Group , which provides a national firefighting
capability, is also under review.  To contact the reporter on this story:
