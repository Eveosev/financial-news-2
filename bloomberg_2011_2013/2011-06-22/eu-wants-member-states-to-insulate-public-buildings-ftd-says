European Union Energy Commissioner
Guenther Oettinger wants to force member states to insulate
public buildings as part of a drive to cut energy consumption,
the  Financial Times Deutschland  reported.  The 27-nation trade bloc wants to mandate that member
states improve insulation in 3 percent of public buildings,
based on floor space, on a year-by-year basis from 2014, the
newspaper reported, citing EU Commission plans it said it had
obtained. The proposals include new public procurement rules
aimed at awarding contracts to energy-efficient products and
services, the newspaper said.  The EU wants to cut energy consumption in buildings by 20
percent by 2020, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
