The European Bank for Reconstruction
and Development and the  International Finance Corporation  will
lend 114.8 million euros ($165 million) to wind farms that  EDP
Renovaveis SA (EDPR)  is developing in Romania.  The EBRD and the  World Bank ’s private-sector lending unit
are each lending 57.4 million euros to Cernavoda Power SA, a
company majority-owned by EDP Renovaveis, to co-finance the
building and operation of the Dobrogea area wind parks, the EBRD
said today in a statement. Further terms weren’t disclosed.  The institutions will keep 42.2 million euros for their own
accounts and syndicate 15.2 million euros each to a group of
commercial banks, the EBRD said. It also said this is the first
investment and project financing by the EBRD and IFC in clean
energy in Romania, which is seeking to boost renewable energy
production to meet European Union goals.  EDP Renovaveis, the renewable energy unit of  Portugal ’s
biggest power company, is developing the 138-megawatt Cernavoda
I and II wind farms. The Cernavoda I facility is operating and
the second phase is being commissioned. Each phase has a 69-
megawatt capacity that together account for a quarter of
Romania’s wind generation capacity, according to the EBRD.  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
