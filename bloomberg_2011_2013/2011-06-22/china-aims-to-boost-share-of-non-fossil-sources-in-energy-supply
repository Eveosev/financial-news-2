China  aims to boost the share of
non-fossil sources in its energy mix to 20 percent by 2030 and
to 33 percent by 2050, said Han Wenke, head of energy research
at the National Development & Reform Commission.  Non-fossil sources including wind, solar, biomass, hydro
and nuclear power accounted for about 9.6 percent of Chinaâ€™s
energy supply at the end of last year, Han said at a conference
in Beijing today, citing government data.  To contact the reporter on this story:
