Authorities disrupted an
international scam that infected computers with a virus that
helped sell $72 million worth of bogus security software,
according to the U.S.  Justice Department .  The software, known as scareware, tells users they need to
purchase whatâ€™s described as anti-virus software to repair their
machines, the Justice Department said in a statement today.
Computer users received a barrage of notifications seeking
credit-card numbers to pay for fake anti-virus software, the
department said.  An estimated 960,000 computer users in the U.S. and
elsewhere were victimized, according to the Justice Department.
The fake repair software sold for as much as $129.  Authorities seized computers and servers in the U.S. and in
countries including the Netherlands,  Latvia , U.K. and  France 
that were linked to the scam, according to the statement.
Latvian authorities seized bank accounts that were allegedly
used to funnel profits from the scam.  The investigation is continuing and no documents were filed
publicly in the U.S. indicating charges had been filed,
according to Alisa Finelli, a Justice Department spokeswoman.  Also today, the Justice Department said two people were
indicted in  Minnesota  and arrested in Latvia in connection with
online advertising that infected computers with malicious
software prompting users to buy bogus anti-virus software. That
scam resulted in at least $2 million in losses, the department
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
