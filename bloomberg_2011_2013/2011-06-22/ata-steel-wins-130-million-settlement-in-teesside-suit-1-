Tata Steel Ltd. (TATA) , which shut and sold
part of its Teesside Cast Products unit after four of its
largest customers halted orders, said it received $130 million
as settlement from the violators of the 10-year contract.  An arbitration tribunal ruled the buyers unlawfully
terminated the agreements, Mumbai-based Tata Steel said today in
a statement to the Bombay Stock Exchange.  Tata Steel  Europe  lost about 150 million pounds ($242
million) running Teesside in northeast  England  after the buyers,
accounting for about 80 percent of its business, didn’t honor
the 2009 contract. Italy’s Marcegaglia SpA, South Korea’s
Dongkuk Steel Mill Co., Luxembourg-based Ternium SA and Swiss-
Italian steelmaker Duferco Participations Holding Ltd. walked
away from taking deliveries of slab steel, which they process
into other steel products.  Tata Steel shares were little changed at 558.10 rupees at
the 3:30 p.m. close in Mumbai. The shares have fallen 18 percent
this year, compared with a 14 percent drop in the Sensitive
Index of the Bombay Stock Exchange.  The company mothballed some of Teesside’s operations in
February last year. A year later,  Thailand ’s largest steel
producer Sahaviriya Steel Industries Public Co. agreed to buy
the unit for $469 million. The deal includes the sale of coke
ovens, power generation facilities and the Redcar Blast Furnace.  To contact the reporter on this story:
