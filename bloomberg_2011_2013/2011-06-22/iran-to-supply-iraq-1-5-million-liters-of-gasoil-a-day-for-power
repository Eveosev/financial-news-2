Iran  agreed to supply 1.5 million
liters, or 9,400 barrels, of gasoil a day to  Iraq  over 12 months
for power generation, said Masaab Serri, a spokesman for the
Iraqi Electricity Ministry.  The fuel will enable  power plants  to generate 250
megawatts, according to the agreement signed by officials from
the neighboring countries in  Baghdad  today, Serri said in a
telephone interview. The gasoil will be transported by trucks
and sold at international prices, he said.  Iraq, holder of the world’s fifth-largest crude reserves,
is seeking fuel to meet domestic demand. The nation’s refineries
in Baghdad’s Dora district, in the southern region of Basra and
in the northern city of Baiji have a combined capacity of about
700,000 barrels a day. In practice, they process less crude than
that because of wartime damage and are unable to meet domestic
demand of about 600,000 barrels a day, according to a  U.S.
Energy Department  report.  The country is trying to rebuild its oil industry after
years of conflict and limited investment reduced output and
efficiency. Iraq has signed 15 gas and oil licenses since the
2003 U.S.-led invasion that ousted the regime of former
President  Saddam Hussein . Crude exports from the semi-autonomous
Kurdish region resumed last month.  To contact the reporters on this story:
