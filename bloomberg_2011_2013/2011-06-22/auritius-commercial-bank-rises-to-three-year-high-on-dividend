Mauritius Commercial Bank (MCB) , the
Indian Ocean island nation’s largest lender by market value,
climbed to a more than three-year high after saying it will pay
a dividend of 3.25 rupees for the year through June.  The stock advanced 2 rupees, or 1.1 percent to 190 rupees,
the highest since February 2008, by the 1:30 p.m. close in Port
Louis, the capital.  “The stock price increased following the lender’s dividend
announcement yesterday,” Kishen Nadassen, a research analyst at
Cim Stockbrokers Ltd., said in a phone interview. “The total
dividend has increased by 9.5 percent to 5.75 rupees this
year.”  Nadassen added that the dividend attests to “the lender’s
good performance and its target of a record profit exceeding 4
billion rupees ($142 million).”  To contact the reporter on this story:
