Americans are growing more 
dissatisfied with President Barack Obamaâ€™s handling of the 
economy, and only 30 percent said they are certain to re-elect 
him, according to a Bloomberg National Poll conducted June 
17-20.  Fewer than a quarter of respondents see signs of 
improvement in the economy, and two-thirds say they believe the 
country is on the wrong track overall. Hans Nichols reports on 
Bloomberg Television's "InsideTrack." (Source: Bloomberg)  Running time 02:52
