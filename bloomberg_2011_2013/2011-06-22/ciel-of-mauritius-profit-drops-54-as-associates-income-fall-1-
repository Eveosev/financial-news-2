Ciel Investment Ltd. (CIEL) , a Mauritian
investment-holding company, said full-year profit fell 54
percent as income from its associate companies declined.  Net income declined to 203.8 million rupees ($7.2 million)
in the year through March from 439.7 million rupees a year
earlier, the Port Louis-based company said in a statement on the
Stock Exchange of Mauritius’s website today. Revenue increased
37 percent to 295.3 million rupees, it said.  Ciel’s share of associates’ after-tax profit slumped to
114.2 million rupees from 507.6 million rupees, the company
said. Earnings were boosted in the previous year by
“exceptional profits” after  Ireland Blyth Ltd. (IBL)  distributed
dividends to dispose of its 29 percent stake in Sun Resorts
Ltd., it said. Ciel was a shareholder in Ireland Blyth.  Ciel Investment has assets of 5 billion rupees and holds
stakes in tourism, healthcare and financial services companies,
according to the company.  To contact the reporter on this story:
