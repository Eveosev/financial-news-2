Japanese stocks rose the most in
three weeks after Greek Prime Minister  George Papandreou  won a
parliamentary confidence vote that moved the country one step
further from default.  Sony Corp. (6758) , which gets more than 20 percent of its sales in
Europe, climbed 3.7 percent.  Toyota Motor Corp. (7203)  gained 1.1
percent after Deutsche Bank AG. raised its profit estimate for
the world’s biggest carmaker. Oji Paper Co. jumped 3.5 percent
after  Daiwa Securities  Capital Markets Co. raised its rating on
Japan’s largest papermaker to “outperform,” citing improving
profits at the company’s cardboard business.  The Nikkei 225 Stock Average rose 1.8 percent to 9,629.43
at the 3 p.m. close in Tokyo. The broader Topix index gained 1.6
percent to 828.99, the gauge’s biggest advance since May 31.
More than ten stocks climbed for each that dropped.  “ Greece  is one step closer to getting additional loans,
said  Hiroichi Nishi , an equities manager at SMBC Nikko
Securities Inc. in Tokyo. “That helps ease concern about
 Europe ’s debt crisis.”  In Athens early today, Papandreou won a vote of confidence
in Greece’s 300-member parliament, with all 155 lawmakers in the
Socialist Party expressing their support for the prime
minister’s government. The vote averted a leadership crisis that
would have made it more difficult to pass austerity measures
that Europe is demanding in return for bailout money.  Budget Cuts  Attention now turns to whether Papandreou can push through
parliamentary approval next week of a 78 billion-euro ($112
billion) package of budget cuts.  European finance ministers
said this week they would hold off on approving a 12 billion-
euro payment to the country until passage of plans to cut the
deficit, sell state assets and impose a “crisis levy” on wages.  Sony rose 3.7 percent to 2,012 yen.  Seiko Epson Corp. (6724) , a
maker of printers and watches which makes more than 20 percent
of its sales in Europe, climbed 3 percent to 1,349 yen.  The Topix has lost 7.8 percent since March 10, the day
before a magnitude-9 earthquake and tsunami devastated Japan’s
northeast coast, triggering the worst nuclear accident in 25
years, disrupting supply chains, and leaving more than 23,000
people dead or missing. The decline was the biggest among the
world’s 40-largest benchmark indexes.  ‘Discounted Level’  The slump has pushed valuations on the Topix index to 1.21
times book value, compared with 2.18 on the Standard & Poor’s
500 Index and 1.56 on the Stoxx Europe 600 Index. About two
thirds of the 1,671 Topix companies trade at less than book
value, meaning that investors could theoretically buy the firms
at current prices and liquidate them at a profit.  “Japanese stocks are trading at very discounted levels,”
said  Junichi Misawa , head of equity investment at Tokyo-based
STB Asset Management Co., which oversees about $17 billion.
“The economy will get a boost in the second-half of the year as
production recovers and companies rebuild inventories. That
should support stock prices.”  Bank of  Japan  Governor Masaaki Shirakawa said on June 1
supply constraints are easing faster than expected as companies
rush to repair factories. While gross domestic product shrank at
an annualized 3.5 percent rate in the three months ended March
31, economists predict the economy will expand in the second
half of the year as reconstruction work kicks in.  Toyota gained 1.1 percent to 3,240 yen afer Deutsche Bank
analyst Kurt Sanger raised his estimate for Toyota’s operating
profit in the year ending in March 2012 to 500 billion yen ($6.2
billion) from 461 billion yen. Sanger said the carmaker, which
forecasts operating profit of 300 billion yen, was being
“conservative” in its predictions for car sales, warranty
provisioning rates and material prices.  Jtekt Rises  Jtekt Corp. (6473) , a supplier of parts to Toyota, advanced 3.2
percent to 1,189 yen. The company, which had delayed earnings
forecasts because of damage from March’s earthquake, said net
income will rise 20 percent to 24 billion yen in the year ending
in March 2012.  Makers of cardboard and other pulp products advanced the
most among the Topix’s 33 industry groups after Oji Paper had
its rating increased to “outperform” from “neutral” at Daiwa
Securities. Oji Paper rose 3.5 percent to 382 yen. Closet rival
 Nippon Paper Group Inc. (3893)  climbed 3 percent to 1,735 yen.  Among stocks that fell, Seven & I Holdings Co., operator of
Ito-Yokada Co. supermarkets, dropped after the Japan Chain Store
Association said Japan’s supermarket sales fell 1.4 percent last
month, following a 1.3 percent decline in April. Seven & I lost
0.8 percent to 2,175 yen.  To contact the reporters on this story:
