Vale SA (VALE3) , the world’s biggest iron-
ore producer, may have the suspension of its $5.9 billion
fertilizer project in  Argentina  lifted as early as tomorrow
after presenting a revised plan to authorities.  Officials will assess the revised plan today, Augusto
Rosales, cabinet chief at the Mendoza province’s environment
secretariat, said in a telephone interview from Mendoza,
Argentina. The government may extend the suspension if the
revised plan doesn’t meet requirements, he said.  “If the information submitted is what was requested, the
suspension will be lifted,” Rosales said. “If not, we will
request additional information.”  The provincial government suspended on June 17 Vale’s
potash mine project, expected to be the world’s largest, after
saying it didn’t comply with required contract demands. The mine
is scheduled to start operating in 2014. Vale is building a
railway and a port to ship the mineral to  Brazil .  Rio de Janeiro-based Vale  gained  30 centavos, or 0.7
percent, to 43.95 reais in Sao Paulo trading at 3:31 p.m.  New
York  time. The shares have  declined  about 8.9 percent since the
start of the year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
