  Petroleo Brasileiro SA (PETR4) , Brazil’s
state-run oil company, will use a fuel additive from
 International Fuel Technology Inc. (IFUE)  to improve the chemical
composition of biodiesel.  International Fuel’s PerfoLift BD-4 provides oxidation
stability and controls the formation of deposits in biodiesel
blends, the Saint Louis, Missouri-based company said today in a
statement. The value of the contract wasn’t disclosed.  Petrobras will use the additive at its three biodiesel
plants, which can manufacture at total of 150 million liters
(39.6 million gallons) of fuel a year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
