The Netherlands is in talks with the
country’s banks, insurers and pension funds to see whether they
would participate in a second  Greece  bailout, according to a
person with knowledge of the matter.  The government has initiated talks with the country’s
financial industry on a voluntary rollover of outstanding Greek
debt, said the person, who declined to be identified because the
talks are private. A spokesman for the  Finance Ministry  declined
to comment.  Finance Minister Jan Kees de Jager last week said the
country’s banks had risks related to Greece of about 3.7 billion
euros ($5.3 billion) at the end of last year. Dutch pension
funds and insurance companies have additional risks of “several
billion euros,” he said.  De Jager earlier this week said a commitment from the
private sector in a rescue operation for Greece is
“important.”  ING Groep NV (INGA) , the biggest Dutch financial-services company,
had risks tied to Greek  government bonds  totaling 1.4 billion
euros at the end of the first quarter.  Insurer  Aegon NV (AGN) , which finished repaying state aid last
week, has a “negligible” exposure to Greece, Chief Executive
Officer Alex Wynaendts said yesterday, adding his company could
rollover Greek debt without being affected.  To contact the reporter on this story:
