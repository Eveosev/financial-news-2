SABMiller Plc (SAB) , the world’s second-
largest brewer by volume, dropped to the lowest level in three
months in Johannesburg after Citigroup Inc. cut its
recommendation on the stock.  The shares fell 1.1 percent to 228.90 rand by 11:29 a.m. in
Johannesburg. A close at that level would be the lowest since
March 22.  SABMiller was reduced to “hold” from “buy” by analysts
including London-based Adam Spielman, according to an e-mailed
note dated today. The price estimate on the brewer’s stock was
cut to 23.50 pounds a share from 27 pounds. The company offered
to buy  Foster’s Group Ltd. (FGL)  for $10 billion in cash yesterday.
The bid was immediately rejected by Australia’s largest brewer.  “The stock will be dead money for several months as the
market waits for clarity about the Foster’s deal and assesses
the likelihood of SABMiller being able to successfully grow the
Foster’s business,” the analysts wrote. SABMiller will need to
raise its offer of A$4.90 a share to more than A$5.50, they
wrote.  “This isn’t financially attractive,” according to the
analysts. “The decision to pay up for  Australia  shows there are
few large attractive options left for SAB,” they wrote, adding
that they “don’t like the dilution of the emerging-market
story, nor the exposure to what we regard as the over-valued
Australian dollar.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
