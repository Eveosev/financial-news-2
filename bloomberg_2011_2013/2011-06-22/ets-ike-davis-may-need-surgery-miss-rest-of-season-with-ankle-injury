New York Mets first baseman  Ike Davis  may be sidelined for rest of the Major League Baseball
season with an ankle injury, the team said on its  website .  Davis, 24, hasn’t played since May 10, when he was hurt in
an infield collision in  Colorado  with Mets third baseman  David Wright . He will be out at least another month.  Medical tests taken yesterday showed no improvement of the
bone bruise in Davis’s ankle, according to MLB.com. He’ll
continue rehabilitation for the next three weeks and then be re-
evaluated to determine if season-ending surgery is needed.  “Surgery is like an athlete’s nightmare,” Davis said,
according to MLB.com. “If it’s going to get me on the field
again, then that’s something we have to do, but obviously we’re
going to get a second opinion.”  Sandy Alderson , the Mets general manager,  told the New York
Post  that he doesn’t see Davis “coming back any time soon.”  Should Davis need surgery, it would be similar to a
microfracture procedure that increases blood flow to the area,
the newspaper said.  Davis was hitting .302 in 36 games and leading the team
with seven home runs and 25 runs batted in at the time of the
injury.  To contact the reporter on this story:
