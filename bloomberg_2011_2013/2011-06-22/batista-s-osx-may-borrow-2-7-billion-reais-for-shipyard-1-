OSX Brasil SA (OSXB3) , the Brazilian ship
builder controlled by billionaire  Eike Batista , said it gained
approval for financing from a government-run fund and estimates
it may borrow as much as 2.7 billion reais ($1.7 billion).  The proceeds from  Brazil ’s Merchant Marine Fund will be
used to build the biggest shipyard in the Americas at the Acu
port, the Rio de Janeiro-based company said today in a
regulatory filing. OSX didn’t disclose terms for any loan.  Batista, the world’s eighth-richest person with $30 billion
according to Forbes magazine, is building what he says will be
the world’s third-biggest port in the southeastern state of Rio
de Janeiro. The Acu port project, scheduled to begin operations
in the second half of next year, will handle iron-ore, oil, coal
and steel from Batista’s companies and partners including Anglo
American Plc.  “This decision by the fund affirms a national interest of
making OSX’s naval construction unit happen,” Batista said in
the filing.  OSX gained 10 reais, or 2.3 percent, to 449.99 reais in Sao
Paulo trading at 9:49 a.m. New York time. Before today, the
stock fell 8.9 percent this year, less than the 11 percent drop
in the benchmark Bovespa index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
