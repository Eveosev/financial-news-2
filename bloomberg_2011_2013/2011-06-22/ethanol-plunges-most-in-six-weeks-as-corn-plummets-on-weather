Ethanol futures fell the most in six
weeks in  Chicago  as corn plummeted on good planting weather.  The biofuel followed grains lower, dropping 2.5 percent,
amid forecasts for rain and warm weather in the corn-abundant
Midwest. Ethanol in the U.S. is made from corn, with one bushel
distilling into at least 2.75 gallons.  “Corn prices were hammered down today, pressured by a big
sell-off in the wheat market, settling down limit and dragging
ethanol prices down along the way,” SCB & Associates LLC in
Chicago said in a note to clients.  Denatured ethanol for July delivery tumbled 6.7 cents to
$2.658 a gallon on the Chicago Board of Trade, the steepest one-
day drop since May 11. Futures have gained 12 percent this year.  In cash market trading, ethanol was unchanged in the U.S.
Gulf at $2.775 a gallon and on the West Coast the additive
increased 6 cents, or 2.1 percent, to $2.90, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  Ethanol in Chicago fell 2.5 cents, or 0.9 percent, to $2.70
a gallon and in  New York  the biofuel declined 2 cents, or 0.8
percent, to $2.79.  Corn futures for December delivery plummeted the exchange-
limit 30 cents, or 4.4 percent, to $6.5025 a bushel in Chicago.  The drop in corn helped ethanol production margins because
the fuel didn’t fall as much as the grain did, SCB said.  Average ethanol mills in  Iowa  earn 4 cents on every gallon
produced, while plants in  Illinois  are pocketing 11 cents on a
spot basis, according to Ag Trader Talk, an online grains
information service in Clive, Iowa.  To contact the reporter on this story:
