Global sugar production will rise by
10.5 million metric tons in the season starting in October to
about 176 million tons, according to German researcher F.O.
Licht.  Output in  Brazil , the world’s largest producer and
exporter, was estimated at 40 million tons in the 2011-12
season, unchanged from the previous crop year, analyst Stefan Uhlenbrock said at a conference in Brussels today.  Production in  Thailand , the world’s second-biggest
exporter, may climb 500,000 tons next season to 10.5 million
tons. The Southeast Asian country produced 10 million tons in
the current season, 3 million tons more than estimated, he said.  Sugar supplies will exceed demand by 8 million to 9 million
tons in the 2011-12 marketing year, Uhlenbrock told Bloomberg
News at the conference.  World sugar production will be 165.6 million tons in the
current season, up 500,000 tons from a previous estimate, Licht
said. Supplies will exceed demand by 1 million tons in the
current crop year, the researcher estimated.  To contact the reporter on this story:
