The weather in much of the U.S. may
be warmer than normal in the first part of July, according to
the latest forecast from  Matt Rogers , president of Commodity
Weather Group LLC.  Temperatures in most of the country will be about 3 degrees
Fahrenheit (1.6 Celsius) higher than normal, with areas of the
Rocky Mountains and western Plains rising to 5 to 8 degrees
above normal from July 2 to July 6, according to the forecast.  Next week, the East and West Coasts will have more
seasonable weather, Rogers said. For the rest of this week,
temperatures on the Atlantic Coast from  Pennsylvania  to  South
Carolina  will probably be about 3 degrees higher than normal.  Another area of higher heat will grip the U.S. Southwest,
Rogers said from his office in Bethesda, Maryland.  Natural-gas traders monitor  weather forecasts  to determine
whether temperatures may boost heating or cooling demand.
Predictions of below-normal or above-normal temperatures may
prompt traders to buy or sell gas futures. Commodity traders
watch precipitation forecasts for impact on planting and yields.  To contact the reporter on this story:
