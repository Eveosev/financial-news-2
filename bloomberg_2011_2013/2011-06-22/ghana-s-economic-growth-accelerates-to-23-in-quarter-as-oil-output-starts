Ghana ’s economic growth accelerated
to an annual 23 percent in the first quarter as the West African
nation began producing oil for export, the country’s statistics
agency said.  Growth compared with 9.5 percent in the fourth quarter,
 Grace Bediako , head of the  Ghana  Statistical Service, told
reporters in the capital, Accra, today.  Expansion was led by a 162 percent jump in mining and
quarrying, which includes the oil industry, while agriculture
grew 39.2 percent. Ghana began production of oil from its
offshore Jubilee field in December. Output is about 70,000
barrels a day and may climb to 120,000 next month, according to
the field’s operator, London-based  Tullow Oil Plc. (TLW)   “Base effects imply that industry will continue to show
strong year-on-year growth from the second quarter to the
fourth,” Yvonne Mhango, a sub-Saharan Africa economist at
 Renaissance Capital , said in an e-mailed note today.  Ghana’s currency, the cedi, gained 0.1 percent to trade at
1.5165 per dollar by 1:14 p.m. in Accra.  Gross domestic product expanded 7.7 percent last year,
compared with growth of 4 percent in 2009, the statistical
agency said May 11.  Faster growth does not pose a threat to the Bank of Ghana’s
 monetary policy , Sampson Akligoh, an economist at Accra-based
Databank Financial Services Ltd., said in an e-mailed note
yesterday.  “Monetary policy will remain expansionary in line with
inflationary expectations,” Akligoh said.  The inflation rate fell for a third month in May, reaching
8.9 percent, the statistical service said June 15. The central
bank cut its key lending rate to 13 percent from 13.5 percent
last month, after leaving it unchanged for three consecutive
meetings.  To contact the reporter on this story:
