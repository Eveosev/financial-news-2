California Governor  Jerry Brown  told
Democrats that he’s preparing a new budget plan that won’t need
support from Republican lawmakers in order to pass, according to
two people with knowledge of the matter.  Brown, who vetoed a proposal by fellow Democrats last week,
met privately today with Senate and Assembly members to brief
them on his ideas, according to legislative aides apprised of
what the governor said. They declined to be identified because
they weren’t authorized to speak about the meetings.  Brown, 73, and lawmakers are at an impasse over how to
bridge a $10 billion deficit. Without a budget, the biggest
issuer of municipal debt in the U.S. is unable to borrow on  Wall
Street  to pay bills when the fiscal year starts July 1.  “I’ll be sharing some very specific ideas tomorrow,”
Brown said late today. “There will be several ideas I’ll
propose.”  The governor’s earlier spending plan, to balance the budget
by extending more than $9 billion of expiring taxes and fees,
was blocked by Republicans. He then vetoed an alternative
designed by Democrats, saying it used legally doubtful
maneuvers.  To contact the reporters on this story:
