Mitsubishi Corp. (8058) ’s Princes unit
offered to sell a canned-pie business after Britain’s antitrust
regulator decided its planned purchase of  Premier Foods Plc (PFD) 
would create a near-monopoly on the product.  The divestment of the Fray Bentos brand and some
manufacturing assets may prevent the deal from being referred to
Britain’s Competition Commission for another probe, the U.K.
Office of Fair Trading said today in a statement.  “The evidence in this case suggests that post-merger the
parties would have a near monopoly in the provision of canned
pies,” said OFT economist Amelia Fletcher. “We are concerned
that consumers will be left with extremely limited choices in
relation to this product, as well as unwelcome price rises.”  Premier Foods, which makes Hovis bread, agreed to sell its
canned-food division to Princes for 182 million pounds ($294
million) in February, to help reduce its debt.  The company said in a statement that it expects to complete
the disposal “at the end of July.”  The Brussels-based European Commission said in May that
U.K. regulators were best placed to review the deal, partly
because they had recently conducted an in-depth study of the
buying power of supermarkets.  If an up-front buyer isn’t found for Fray Bentos, the OFT
said it will refer the deal to the  Competition Commission .  To contact the reporter on this story:
