U.S. Treasury Secretary  Timothy F.
Geithner  said that his department has received applications for
$11.6 billion from its Small Business Lending Fund and plans to
start distributing the funds soon.  “Small-business owners, however, face disproportionate
challenges in the aftermath of the recession and credit
crisis,” Geithner said in testimony prepared for a hearing
today before the House Small Business Committee. “Small
businesses are concentrated in sectors that were especially
hard-hit by the recession and the bursting of the housing
bubble: construction and real estate.”  The $30 billion small-business lending program was set up
in September by Congress and the administration of President
 Barack Obama  to provide low-interest capital injections to
community banks that increase their lending to small businesses.
The program permits them to use the new capital to essentially
refinance their Troubled Asset Relief Program debt. So far,
Treasury has received 869 applications and expects to begin
providing capital very soon, Geithner said.  Lawmakers have criticized the administration for the speed
of the small-business lending fund and other assistance
programs. Geithner is informing the committee about overall
efforts by the Treasury to jump-start small-business lending.  Half of all U.S. workers are employed by companies with
fewer than 500 employees, and small businesses create two-thirds
of all private-sector jobs, Geithner said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
