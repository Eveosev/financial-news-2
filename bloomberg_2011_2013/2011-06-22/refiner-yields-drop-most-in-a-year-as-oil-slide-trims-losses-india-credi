Investor confidence in  India ’s oil
refiners is improving the most in a year as the 8 percent drop
in crude prices this month boosts the companies’ profit outlook.  Bonds of Indian Oil Corp. are rallying the most since May
2010 and  government bonds  in the world’s fourth-largest importer
of crude were the best performers in the so-called BRIC nations
in June after  Saudi Arabia  increased oil supplies and  Europe ’s
debt crisis clouded the outlook for the global economy. Two
months ago, the Indian Oil said it was borrowing as much as $1.3
billion a month as it awaited compensation to make up for losses
selling fuels at state-set prices.  “Cheaper oil relaxes the mind a little,” Mahendra Jajoo,
the Mumbai-based head of fixed-income investments at Pramerica
Asset Managers, a unit of  Newark , New Jersey-based Prudential
Financial Inc., said in a telephone interview yesterday. “It
will reduce uncertainty on the inflation front and losses for
refiners.”  The yield on Indian Oil’s 10.25 percent local-currency debt
due July 2014 has fallen 11 basis points, or 0.11 percentage
point, this month to 9.99 percent, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The rate on Bharat Petroleum Corp.’s 7.73 percent
notes due October 2012 has slid 18 basis points, the biggest
decline since April 2010, to 9.7 percent.  Greek Crisis  Asia ’s third-biggest economy caps diesel and cooking-fuel
prices to shield 66 percent of the population that lives on less
than $2 a day from price pressures. India’s inflation is running
at 9.06 percent, more than twice the rate in the U.S. and almost
four times  Germany ’s.  Crude oil slumped 18 percent from a 31-month high reached
on May 2 as the Greek crisis deepened. European finance
ministers and the  International Monetary Fund  this week said
they will hold back a 12 billion-euro ($17.2 billion) bailout
payment due in July until  Greece  passed plans to cut expenditure
and raise revenue. The contract for August delivery in New York
traded at $94.32 at 12:52 p.m. Sydney time.  The yield on Hindustan Petroleum Corp.’s 7.7 percent note
due in April 2013 has dropped 15 basis points this month to 9.67
percent, heading for its biggest monthly drop since it started
trading on April 8, 2010. The rate offered by Seoul-based SK
Innovation Co.’s security maturing October 2014 has risen 5
basis points in the same period.  Easing Pressure  Lower energy costs for India, which imports almost 80
percent of the oil it needs, mean slower inflation, a smaller
subsidy bill and a better chance for Finance Minister Pranab Mukherjee to achieve his target of cutting the  budget deficit  to
4.6 percent of gross domestic product, a four-year low,
according to Madan Sabnavis, the chief economist at Mumbai-based
CARE Ratings.  A 10 percent increase in global crude prices may add 1
percentage point to wholesale-price inflation and 2 percentage
points over time as input costs rise, the central bank said in a
report on May 2.  “The recent softening definitely eases pressure on fuel
prices,” capping inflation, Sabnavis said. “It also offers the
government some comfort on the subsidy front.”  Benchmark 10-year government bonds are also headed for
their best month since May 2010, with the yield on the 7.8
percent note due April 2021 sliding 17 basis points to 8.24
percent. That compares with a two basis-point decline in  Brazil ,
six basis-point increase in  Russia  and 14 in  China . The rate in
India slipped one basis point today.  The difference in yields between India’s notes due in a
decade and similar-maturity securities in the U.S. has narrowed
to 529 basis points from a seven-month high 543 reached June 15.  Below Cost  Rupee bonds have returned 2.4 percent this year, more than
the 1.4 percent offered by China, according to 10 Asian local-
currency debt markets outside  Japan  monitored by HSBC Holdings.  The rupee has strengthened 0.3 percent this month, the best
performance among the 10 most-traded regional currencies,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. It was little changed
from yesterday at 44.92 as of 10:15 a.m. in Mumbai.  Government-owned refiners in India are losing 4.6 billion
rupees ($102 million) a day selling fuels below cost, according
to the oil ministry’s  website . That’s 6.1 percent less than the
4.9 billion rupees in the first half of May. The government
hands out cash to make up for part of those losses.  Dollar Debt  Indian Oil plans to raise $500 million from dollar bonds
next month and has hired Citigroup Inc., Royal Bank of Scotland
Plc and BNP Paribas SA to manage the sale, Finance Director P.K. Goyal said this week.  It is too early to predict a further drop in yields as a
reversal in crude  oil prices  could cause a rebound, said Ritesh Jain, the Mumbai-based head of investments at Canara Robeco
Asset Management Ltd. that oversees $2.2 billion.  “Oil needs to fall even further and remain low for a while
for the companies and the economy to benefit,” he said in a
telephone interview yesterday.  New Delhi-based Indian Oil boosted the price of gasoline by
5 rupees a liter to 63.37 rupees on May 15, the biggest raise
since June 2008.  Finance Minister Mukherjee, in his Feb. 28 budget,
estimated to spend 236.4 billion rupees on fuel subsidies in the
year to March 31, compared with 383.8 billion rupees in the
previous 12 months.  Immediate Relief  Indian Oil has about 700 billion rupees of total debt,
Goyal said in an interview June 21. The refiner’s debt was at
527.3 billion on March 31, Chairman R.S. Butola said May 30.  The cost of protecting the debt of government-owned  State
Bank  of India, which some investors perceive as a proxy for the
nation, has increased 29 basis points this year to 190,
according to data provider CMA, which is owned by CME Group Inc.
and compiles prices quoted by dealers in the privately
negotiated market.  Credit-default swaps pay the buyer face value in exchange
for the underlying securities or the cash equivalent should a
government or company fail to adhere to its debt agreements. A
basis point equals $1,000 annually on a contract protecting $10
million of debt.  New York  crude oil may average $94.93 a barrel in 2011,
according to an average estimate of 36 analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg.  “Lower oil prices will give the refiners some immediate
relief,” said K. Ravichandran, the Mumbai-based co-head of
corporate ratings at ICRA Ltd., said in an interview on June 21.
“It increases cash liquidity somewhat.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
