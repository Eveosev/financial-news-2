Birmingham City hired former
Newcastle coach  Chris Hughton  to replace  Alex McLeish  as coach
of the newly demoted English soccer club.  Hughton, 52, led Newcastle back into the Premier League
after taking over as manager in October 2009 and was fired in
December 2010. He played at Tottenham, West Ham and Brentford.  McLeish left City for cross-town rival  Aston Villa  earlier
this month. Birmingham was relegated to the Championship after
finishing in the bottom three teams of the Premier League last
season.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
