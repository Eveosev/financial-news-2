U.S. Secretary of State  Hillary Clinton  said businesses in  Latin America  must pay their “fair
share” of taxes to fight drug trafficking.  “True security cannot be funded on the backs of the
poor,” Clinton said today at a security conference in Guatemala
City, where she was joined by presidents from Central America,
 Mexico  and Colombia.  Clinton said the U.S. will pledge $300 million to counter
drug trafficking in Central America this year as Mexican drug
cartels deepen roots in the region. Guatemala, which borders
Mexico, joins neighboring Honduras and El Salvador as having
among the highest murder rates in the world, Clinton said.  The aid package will boost police forces and intelligence
gathering, as well as establish a fund to promote tax reforms,
Clinton said.  Colombia’s President  Juan Manuel Santos  called for a
regional cooperation strategy to fight organized crime and said
Central America should create a financial information unit,
similar to the one Colombia has had for 12 years, to track down
money in “suspicious bank accounts.”  “You have to have political will to defeat organized
crime,” said Santos. “This is no child’s game.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
