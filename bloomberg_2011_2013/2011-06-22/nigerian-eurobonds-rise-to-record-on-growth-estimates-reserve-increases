Nigeria ’s dollar bonds climbed to a
record on speculation that  Africa ’s most populous country will
continue to experience growth as high  oil prices , rising foreign
reserves and recent elections spur investor confidence.  The 6.75 percent Eurobonds of Africa’s biggest oil producer
due 2021 rose 0.1 percent to 104.981 cents on the dollar, the
highest level since the debt was issued in January, lowering the
yield two basis points, or 0.02 percentage point, to 6.056
percent as of 12:02 p.m. in London, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg. The $500 million of bonds are Nigeria’s only
international notes.  “There’s just not a lot of supply and with oil prices high
and the election having gone better than expected,” investors
“are looking for yield,” Rachel Ziemba, a senior analyst at
Roubini Global Economics in  London , said by phone.  Nigeria’s foreign reserves have climbed 3.8 percent this
month to $33.3 billion as of June 20, according to data from the
 Central Bank of Nigeria  in Abuja. Bonny Light oil has risen 18
percent this year. President  Goodluck Jonathan , who was returned
to power in April elections, rejected spending proposals by the
legislature and slashed almost 500 billion naira ($3.2 billion)
of spending plans adopted two months earlier in the final 4.5
trillion-naira budget passed May 25.  “The high oil price bodes well for Nigeria’s petroleum
industry,” Renaissance Capital analysts, led by London-based
Charles Robertson, wrote in a research report today. The smaller
budget “implies that spending, particularly on imports, will
slow and pressure on reserves will ease.”  The West African nation’s economic growth will rise to 7.8
percent in 2012, compared with 7.6 percent this year, according
to  Renaissance Capital  estimates.  To contact the reporter on this story:
