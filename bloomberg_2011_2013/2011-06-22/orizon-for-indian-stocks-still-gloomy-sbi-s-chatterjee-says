Deepak Chatterjee, managing director
of SBI Funds Management Pvt., which manages $9.3 billion in
assets, comments on the outlook for  India ’s stocks. He spoke in
an interview in Mumbai.  The Bombay Stock Exchange Sensitive Index, or Sensex, fell
0.2 percent to 17,516.97 at 2:12 p.m. in Mumbai.  “The horizon is still gloomy. Inflation doesn’t seem to be
tamed and we are not at the end of the rate-rise regime. As it
sometimes happens, the interest-rate rise itself is feeding
inflation.  ‘‘The government has to try to fix the structural problems.
I do not see the possibility of a deregulation in diesel prices.
It is a question of sentiment rather than fundamentals. The
long-term consumption-led story is still intact. We see no
concern on a long-term basis. The government investigations on
scams may help restore sentiment. At least investors can say
that something good is happening.  ‘‘We are positive on sectors which have pricing powers even
in a high-inflation scenario, like pharmaceuticals and consumer-
discretionary.’’  To contact the reporters on this story:
