MAp Group (MAP)  said it has entered into
exclusive talks with the Ontario Teachers’ Pension Plan Board on
a swap of assets owned by the two groups.  Under the proposal, MAp would sell its non-controlling
interests in Brussels Airport and Copenhagen Airport in exchange
for Ontario Teachers’ 11.02 percent interest in Sydney Airport
and a cash payment of A$850 million ($899 million), the Sydney-
based company said today in a statement to the Australian stock
exchange. The deal would take MAp’s stake in Sydney Airport to
85 percent, it said.  The swap proposal from the Canadian pension fund is non-
binding and highly conditional and there is no certainty the
transaction will proceed, MAp said.  MAp shares climbed 3.4 percent to A$3.39 as of 12:31 a.m.
in Sydney.  To contact the reporter on this story:
