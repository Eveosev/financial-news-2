Spain ’s Parliament agreed to amend
the government’s wage-bargaining law, a process the
 International Monetary Fund  and the Bank of Spain have said
should toughen up the country’s economic overhaul.  Lawmakers ratified the decree passed by the Cabinet on June
10 and agreed to discuss amendments to the legislation in the
coming weeks, Parliament Speaker Jose Bono said in Madrid today
after the vote.  Bank of Spain Governor Miguel Angel Fernandez Ordonez
called yesterday for a deeper overhaul of labor laws to tackle
the country’s 21 percent unemployment rate, the highest in
 Europe , which he said is an obstacle to the economic recovery
and sustainable public finances. The IMF also urged “bold”
measures to tackle the “dysfunctional” labor market and said
amendments made to the law in Parliament should give companies
more flexibility in the way they manage workers.  “The wage-bargaining law contains positive elements, but
it leaves arbitration as still playing a strong role and this
may not be for the best to increase flexibility at the firms’
level,” said Tullia Bucco, an economist at Unicredit Global
Research in Milan. “The IMF means that should the labor reform
prove inadequate to force internal flexibility, the government
must take swift action to reinforce it.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
