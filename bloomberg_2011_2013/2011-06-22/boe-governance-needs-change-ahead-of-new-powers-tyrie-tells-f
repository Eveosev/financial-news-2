U.K. Treasury Committee Chairman
 Andrew Tyrie  said the Bank of England’s governance structure
will have to be changed before the committee could give its
approval to legislation giving the central bank oversight of
banking and financial stability, the Financial Times reported,
citing an interview with Tyrie.  “I have no doubt that the legislation will have
substantial changes,” Tyrie said, suggesting that other changes
may also be needed before the committee approved the
legislation, according to the FT.  To contact the reporter on this story:
