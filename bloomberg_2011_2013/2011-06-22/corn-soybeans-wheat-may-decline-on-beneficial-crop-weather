What follows are opening calls for
U.S. grain and oilseed markets.  -- Corn futures are called to open 7 cents to 9 cents a bushel
lower on the  Chicago  Board of Trade as warmer temperatures,
variable rainfall and adequate soil-moisture reserves in the
U.S. Midwest will promote plant growth, said  Don Roose , the
president of U.S. Commodities Inc. in West Des Moines, Iowa.  -- Soybean futures may open 6 cents to 8 cents a bushel lower in
Chicago on speculation that Midwest crops will benefit from
improved weather conditions during the next two weeks, Roose
said. Soybean-oil futures are expected to open 0.3 cent to 0.5
cent a pound lower, and soybean-meal futures may open down $1 to
up 50 cents for 2,000 pounds of the  animal feed .  -- Wheat futures may open 8 cents to 12 cents a bushel lower on
the CBOT, the Kansas City Board of Trade and the  Minneapolis
Grain Exchange  as rain boosts yield potential for crops in
Ukraine, Russia and other parts of Europe, which compete with
higher-priced U.S. supplies, Roose said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
