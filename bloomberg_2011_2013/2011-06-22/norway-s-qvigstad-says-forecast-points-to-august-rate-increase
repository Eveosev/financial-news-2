Jan Qvigstad, deputy governor of
 Norway ’s central bank, said new forecasts indicates the bank is
moving to raise interest rates again in August. He spoke in an
interview today after the bank left its benchmark rate unchanged
at 2.25 percent.  “The very marginal changes in the interest path is that,
in the previous path it was fifty-fifty between the August and
September meeting,” he said, adding that now the forecast “is
more or less certain” of an increase in August. “The reason
for that is stronger output growth has slightly more weight.
But for next summer it is more or less the same.”  “The output gap, the balance of resources - previously we
thought that would be balanced in the second half of this year,
now we say that it is balanced now. In that sense the Norwegian
economy is a bit tighter than anticipated.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
