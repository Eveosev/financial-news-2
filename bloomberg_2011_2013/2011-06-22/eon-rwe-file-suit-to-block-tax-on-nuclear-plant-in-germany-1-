EON AG and RWE AG,  Germany ’s biggest
atomic energy companies, filed a suit to block a tax on their
Gundremmingen nuclear plant in the state of Bavaria.  The companies filed the complaint at a court in Munich
yesterday, Brigitte Lambertz, an RWE spokeswoman, said today.
The utilities operate two reactors at the Gundremmingen
facility, of which EON owns 25 percent while Essen, Germany-
based RWE holds the rest, according to RWE’s  website .  Germany plans to exit nuclear power while maintaining a tax
on reactors to help plug the  budget deficit . Finance Minister
Wolfgang Schaeuble had said the levy was linked to longer
running times for reactors. EON and RWE say the exit may risk
 energy security  and that the tax will slice profits.  The tax was originally designed to raise 2.3 billion euros
($3.3 billion) a year from the country’s 17 reactors.  Chancellor
Angela Merkel  has since announced the permanent closure of eight
nuclear plants.  Petra Uhlmann, a spokeswoman for EON’s German nuclear power
unit, wasn’t immediately available for comment when contacted by
Bloomberg News today. EON, which is based in Dusseldorf, said
May 31 that it will sue to block the tax introduced this year.  Swedish state-owned Vattenfall AB and EnBW Energie Baden-
Wuerttemberg AG also operate nuclear power plants in Germany.  To contact the reporter on this story:
