Vale SA (VALE3) , the world’s second-biggest
mining company by market value, offered to buy all the shares of
its fertilizers unit that it doesn’t already own for as much as
2.22 billion reais ($1.4 billion).  Vale will offer 25 reais for each share of  Vale
Fertilizantes SA (FFTL4)  in circulation, or about 16 percent of the
unit’s total capital, according to a regulatory filing today.
The offer is 32 percent more than the subsidiary’s closing price
of 18.90 reais for the preferred shares in Sao Paulo trading
today.  The Rio de Janeiro-based company will seek to triple potash
and phosphate rock output by 2015 to meet rising demand for the
crop nutrient in  Brazil , the world’s biggest grower of sugar
cane, coffee and oranges. The company bought assets worth about
$5.8 billion for its fertilizer unit last year.  The company said it’s no longer studying a plan to list
shares of the fertilizers subsidiary on any exchanges through
new stock issues. Vale previously said it may combine all its
fertilizer assets and sell shares in an initial public offering.  Vale rose 20 centavos, or 0.5 percent, to 43.85 reais in
Sao Paulo trading today. Shares of Vale Fertilizantes have
rallied 22 percent since mid-April, compared with an 8.2 percent
drop for Brazil’s benchmark Bovespa index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
