Former Le-Nature’s Inc. Chief
Executive Officer Gregory J. Podlucky pleaded guilty to fraud,
 tax evasion  and money-laundering charges related to the 2006
collapse of the bottled-water company.  Podlucky may be sentenced to a maximum of 20 years in
prison when he appears in U.S. District Court in Pittsburgh in
October, under a plea agreement he negotiated with federal
prosecutors, Assistant U.S. Attorney James Y. Garrett said today
in an interview.  Federal prosecutors accused Podlucky of masterminding a
$800 million scheme that created fake invoices and transferred
funds among various accounts to create the appearance of sales
revenue. The fraud was uncovered after a court-appointed
custodian arrived at the company’s headquarters in Latrobe,
Pennsylvania, in October 2006, Garrett said.  “They found very little cash in the bank,” Garrett said,
describing what he told the judge when Podlucky pleaded guilty
on June 20.  Podlucky’s brother Jonathan and at least three other Le-
Nature’s employees also have pleaded guilty to charges related
to the fraud, which cost lenders and other investors about $800
million, according to court records.  Some of the money was used to buy gems, watches and toy
trains, which investigators found in a secret room at the
company’s Latrobe bottling plant, according to court records.  Le-Nature’s filed for bankruptcy in 2006 and was
liquidated.  The case is U.S. v. Podlucky, 2:09-cr-00279, U.S. District
Court, Western District of  Pennsylvania  (Pittsburgh).  To contact the reporter on this story:
