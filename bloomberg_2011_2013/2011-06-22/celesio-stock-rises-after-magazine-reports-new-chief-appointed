Celesio AG (CLS1) , Europe’s biggest drug
wholesaler, rose the most in four months in Frankfurt trading
after  Manager Magazin  reported the company had chosen a new
chief executive officer.  Celesio jumped as much as 4.7 percent to 13.36 euros in the
biggest intraday gain since Feb. 24, and was up 4.1 percent as
of 3:54 p.m.  The drug wholesaler will appoint Markus Pinger, an
executive at German skin-cream maker  Beiersdorf AG (BEI) , to replace
Fritz Oesterle, who steps down as Celesio CEO this month,
Manager Magazin cited unidentified people close to the situation
as saying. Jens Schreiber, a spokesman for Stuttgart, Germany-
based Celesio, didn’t immediately return two phone messages
seeking comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
