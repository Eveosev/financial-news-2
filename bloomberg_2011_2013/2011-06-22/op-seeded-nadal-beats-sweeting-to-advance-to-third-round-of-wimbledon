Top-seeded  Rafael Nadal  defeated
Ryan Sweeting of the U.S. to move into the third round at the
Wimbledon tennis tournament.  Nadal, 25, won 6-3, 6-2, 6-4 over the 23-year-old Sweeting.
The Spaniard now has a 16-match winning streak at the grass-
court major, having last lost in the 2007 final to  Roger
Federer . Nadal missed the 2009 event with a knee injury.  Sweeting, ranked 69th by the men’s ATP tennis tour, played
for the Bahamas in the Davis Cup before becoming a U.S. citizen
in 2006. He won the U.S. Open boys’ single title in 2005.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
