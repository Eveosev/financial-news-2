Telstra Corp.,  Australia ’s former
phone monopoly, said it will receive about A$11 billion ($11.6
billion) for agreeing with the government to phase out the
company’s copper telecommunications network and participate with
NBN Co. in the rollout of the National Broadband Network.  The deal has a number of conditions and won’t have a
material impact on Melbourne-based Telstra’s finances in fiscal
2012, the company said in a statement today to the Australian
stock exchange. Telstra shares advanced 1.3 percent to NZ$4 as
of 11:17 a.m. in Wellington trading.  “After rigorously assessing the options before it,
including the regulatory and commercial implications of each,
the Telstra Board expects to recommend that shareholders approve
a proposal to participate in the NBN rollout, subject to the
conditions precedent being satisfied,” Telstra Chairman
Catherine Livingstone said in the statement  Telstra will have to lease access to the NBN’s A$35.9
billion network after it transfers control of its fixed-line
grid to the government. The national network plans to connect to
93 percent of Australia’s population by 2018.  The plan to bring high-speed Internet to some of
Australia’s remotest corners drew fire ahead of last year’s Aug.
21 general election for its cost. Gillard clung to power by
forming a minority government with independent lawmakers from
rural regions who welcomed improved services.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
