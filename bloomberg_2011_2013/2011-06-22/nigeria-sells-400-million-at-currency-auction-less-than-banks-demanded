Nigeria ’s central bank offered less
foreign currency than demanded by lenders for a fifth straight
auction today as the naira continued to depreciate against the
dollar.  Nigeria , sub-Saharan Africa’s second-biggest economy, sold
$400 million at a foreign-exchange auction, less than the $476
million sought by lenders, the Abuja-based  Central Bank of
Nigeria  said in an e-mailed statement.  Dollars were sold for between 153.81 naira and 153.50 naira
each. The marginal rate, which is also used as the prevailing
exchange rate, was 153.63 naira, compared with 153.38 naira at
the previous auction, held June 20.  “Traders have seen pressure in the foreign-exchange market
in the past weeks and are buying on speculation” that the
central bank might continue to not meet demand, Babatunde Obaniyi, a currency analyst with Afrinvest West Africa Ltd.,
said by phone from Lagos, the commercial capital, today.  The West  Africa  nation’s currency weakened on the
interbank market today, declining 3 kobo to 156.55 naira per
dollar by 6:41 p.m. in Lagos, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
