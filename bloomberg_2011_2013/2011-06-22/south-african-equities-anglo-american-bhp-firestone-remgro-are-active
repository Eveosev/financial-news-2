The FTSE/JSE  Africa  All Share Index
declined 179.01, or 0.6 percent, to 30,792.87 by the 5 p.m.
close in Johannesburg, extending its retreat this month to 5.4
percent.  The following were among the most active stocks in the
South African market today.  AVI Ltd. (AVI)  ,  South Africa ’s third-largest consumer
goods company, gained 56 cents, or 1.9 percent, to 29.86 rand,
the highest close in more than a week. Consolidated per share
earnings after one-time items for the 12 months to June 30 are
expected to increase as much as 33 percent from a year earlier,
the company said in a statement.  Firestone Energy Ltd. (FSE)  , an Australian exploration
company with operations in South Africa, sank to the lowest
level since at least April 2009, losing 2 cents, or 12 percent,
to 15 cents. The company raised $1.7 million in capital by
issuing 85.1 million shares.  Imuniti Holdings Ltd. (IMU)  , a manufacturer of
pharmaceutical products, increased 1 cent, or 13 percent, to 9
cents, erasing yesterday’s 11 percent drop. Imuniti intends to
seek a dual listing on the Alternative Investment Market in
 London , the company said in a statement.  MTN Group Ltd. (MTN)  , Africa’s largest mobile-phone
Operator, fell the most in two months, slipping 2.70 rand, or 2
percent, to 134.10 rand. Group revenue improved only
“marginally” as a result of the strengthening rand against the
dollar, MTN said in a statement.  Remgro Ltd. (REM)  , a diversified investment holding
company, snapped two days of gains, losing 1.84 rand, or 1.7
percent, to 108.75 rand. Remgro has delayed a dividend payment
to November as a result of the change in its year-end to June
from March, it said in a statement late yesterday.  SABMiller Plc. (SAB)  , the world’s second-largest brewer
by volume, dropped to the lowest level in three months, falling
2.63 rand, or 1.1 percent, to 228.86 rand. Citigroup Inc. cut
its recommendation on the stock to “hold” from “buy,”
lowering its price estimate to 23.50 pounds from 27 pounds.  Ububele Holdings Ltd. (UBU)  , an investment group with
food and agriculture interests, slipped the most since Feb. 8,
losing 5 cents, or 12 percent, to 38 cents. Shareholders are
advised to exercise caution when dealing in their shares as the
company has entered into price-sensitive talks, Ububele said in
a statement.  With assistance Stephen Gunnion in Johannesburg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
