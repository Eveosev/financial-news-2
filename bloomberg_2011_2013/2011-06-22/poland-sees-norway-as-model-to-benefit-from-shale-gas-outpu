Poland  hopes to benefit from
prospective shale gas output and may pass laws similar to those
that helped Norway build its sovereign wealth fund, Economy
Minister Waldemar Pawlak said.  “In Norway oil and gas deposits allowed it to create funds
that accumulate money for the future,” Pawlak told a news
conference today. “We will also need this type of solution.”  Norway, a nation of 4.9 million people, generates money for
its $570 billion sovereign wealth fund from taxes on oil and
gas, ownership of petroleum fields and dividends from its 67
percent stake in Statoil ASA, the country’s largest energy
company.  Poland has awarded 87 licenses to companies including  Exxon
Mobil Corp. (XOM) ,  Chevron Corp. (CVX)  and  Talisman Energy Inc. (TLM)  to explore
for gas trapped in shale rocks. The country’s recoverable
reserves of shale gas may amount to 5.2 trillion cubic meters,
enough to supply more than 300 years of domestic consumption,
according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. The
companies have so far drilled fewer than 10 exploratory wells of
the required 124, and they plan to conduct commercial tests
later this year.  Pawlak said commercial output of shale gas should precede
passage of any laws aimed at helping Poland reap greater
benefits from the resource.  “Gas should start flowing before we prepare new
regulations for commercial output,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
