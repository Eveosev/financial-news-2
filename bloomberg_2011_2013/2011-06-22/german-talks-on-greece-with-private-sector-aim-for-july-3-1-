Germany is pursuing talks with the
private sector on encouraging banks and insurers to participate
on a voluntary basis in a second  Greece  bailout, the  Finance
Ministry  said.  “One is trying at national and international level to get
into talks with the private sector in order to make the
voluntary contribution by the private sector quantifiable,”
ministry spokesman Martin Kotthaus told reporters in Berlin
today. “The target date is July 3.”  Asked if some form of compulsion was being held out as
encouragement, Kotthaus said that the stability of Greece and
the euro region should be “enough” of an incentive for the
private sector to participate.  To contact the reporter on this story:
