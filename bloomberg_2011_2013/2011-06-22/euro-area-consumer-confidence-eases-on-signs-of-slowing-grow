European  consumer confidence 
weakened in June as governments struggled to contain a worsening
fiscal crisis and the economy showed signs of slowing down.  An index of household sentiment in the 17-nation euro area
fell to minus 10 from minus 9.9 in May, the Brussels-based
European Commission said in an initial estimate today.
Economists forecast a drop to minus 10.4, the median of 25
estimates in a Bloomberg News survey showed.  The euro-area economy is losing momentum as governments
step up budget cuts just as increasing energy costs sap
householdsâ€™ spending power. German investor confidence fell to
the lowest in 2 1/2 years in June, European services growth
slowed last month and  Hermes International (RMS)  SCA Chief Executive
Officer  Patrick Thomas  on May 30 forecast sales growth to
weaken.  The commission is scheduled to publish its monthly report
on euro-area economic confidence, which includes the consumer-
confidence gauge, on June 29.  To contact the reporter on this story:
