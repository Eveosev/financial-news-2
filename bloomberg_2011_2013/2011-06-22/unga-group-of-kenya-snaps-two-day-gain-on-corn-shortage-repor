Unga Group Ltd. (UNGL) , a Kenyan grain
miller, headed for the lowest level in more than a week after
 Business Daily  reported retailers have started rationing corn
flour due to shortages.  The stock snapped two days of gains, losing 55 cents, or
5.2 percent, to 10 shillings by 12:04 p.m. in Nairobi. A close
at this level would be the weakest since June 13.  “There are reports that some millers are closing down
because of the shortage,” Wycliffe Masinde, an analyst at
Nairobi-based Kestrel Capital East Africa Ltd., said in a phone
interview today. “There is a feeling that they may not be able
to produce to their capacity.”  Retailers are restricting the amount of flour customers can
buy as millers have introduced limits and suppliers say there
are corn shortages, Nairobi-based  Business Daily  said, citing
supermarket managers including Uchumi Supermarkets Ltd. Chief
Executive Officer Jonathan Ciano.  Kenya lowered the tax on imported corn to 10 percent from
50 percent, to offset the rising cost of living, Finance
Minister  Uhuru Kenyatta  said in his budget speech on June 8.  To contact the reporter on this story:
