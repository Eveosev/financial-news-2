The  Federal Reserve  will aim to keep
the domestic securities holdings in its System Open Market
Account at about $2.654 trillion, according to a statement today
from the Federal Reserve Bank of  New York .  The central bank is this month completing a $600 billion
bond purchase-program as scheduled and will maintain its
existing policy of reinvesting principal payments from its
securities holdings, the policy-setting  Federal Open Market
Committee  said today in a statement after a two-day meeting in
 Washington . Fed officials said they will maintain their record
monetary stimulus to support a flagging economic recovery.  The Fed’s purchases “will be allocated across maturities
according to a distribution that is nearly identical to that
executed under the Treasury purchase program,” according to the
statement from the New York Fed, the branch of the  Federal
Reserve System  that implements monetary policy.  When the central bank announced its second round of bond
purchases in November, it said it aimed to buy assets with an
average duration of between five and six years, according to a
Nov. 3 statement from the New York Fed.  The Open Market Trading Desk planned to make about 86
percent of its purchases in securities maturing between 2.5
years and 10 years, the statement said. Duration, a measure of a
bond’s price sensitivity to interest rate changes, generally
increases with maturity.  To contact the reporter on this story:
