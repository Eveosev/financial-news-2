The United Arab Emirates central
bank will begin offering an Islamic facility tomorrow that
accepts Islamic certificates of deposit as collateral, according
to a circular sent to banks today.  The facility is being offered “to provide a source of
liquidity to banks,” according to the bank’s circular. Banks
wishing to participate will be asked to sign a “collateralized
murabahah facility agreement,” the bank said. A murabahah
transaction is a sale and deferred-payment agreement based on an
asset in which the cost and profit margin are agreed in advance
between a bank and its customer.  Short-term liquidity management at Islamic banks and other
financial institutions is a challenge, central bank Governor
Sultan bin Nasser al-Suwaidi said at an Islamic-banking
conference in  Singapore  last year. With the new facility, banks
will be able to use their excessive liquidity to invest in
dirham instruments, Saif al-Shamsi, senior executive director at
the U.A.E. central bank’s treasury department, said Nov. 8.
“There was no instrument for Islamic banks,” he said at the
time.  The central bank said it auctioned the first Shariah-
compliant certificates of deposits on Nov. 10. Transactions in
Islamic finance are based on the exchange of assets rather than
interest to comply with the principles of Shariah, or Islamic
law.  To contact the reporter on this story:
