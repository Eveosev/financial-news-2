BRF - Brasil Foods SA (BRFS3)  and the
Brazilian antitrust agency are far from reaching an agreement
that would save the $3.8 billion deal that created the country’s
biggest maker of frozen meals and meat products, a government
official who is working on the case said.  Brasil Foods didn’t make a specific proposal on which
assets it’s willing to sell during the second meeting with
regulators yesterday since the vote on the merger was postponed
June 15, said the official, who asked not to be identified
because the talks are private. Cade, as the regulator is known,
is scheduled to vote on the case July 13, said the person.
Brasil Foods declined to comment when contacted by Bloomberg
News.  Chief Executive Officer Jose Antonio do Prado Fay told
reporters in Brasilia he presented a new proposal to the
antitrust agency during the meeting.  Brasil Foods  was created
two years ago after Perdigao SA bought Sadia SA in a deal
supported by state-company pension funds.  Carlos Ragazzo, one of the five commissioners voting on the
case, recommended on June 8 the agency block the merger, saying
the deal wielded too much market share in processed foods and
would hurt consumers.  To contact the reporter on this story:
