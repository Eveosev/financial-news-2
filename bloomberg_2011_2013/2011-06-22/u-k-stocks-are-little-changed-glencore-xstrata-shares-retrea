The U.K.’s  FTSE 100 Index (UKX)  closed
little changed, failing to extend yesterday’s biggest rally for
the benchmark gauge in two months, as a retreat by  Barclays Plc (BARC) 
offset a surge in  Man Group Plc. (EMG)   Barclays lost more than 2 percent as HSBC Holdings Plc
downgraded U.K. lenders. Man Group jumped 4.9 percent as
analysts recommended the hedge-fund manager, while  Randgold
Resources Ltd. (RRS)  climbed with the price of gold.  The FTSE 100 slid 2.32, or less than 0.1 percent, to
5,772.99 at the 4:30 p.m. close in London after earlier falling
as much as 0.6 percent. The  FTSE All-Share Index (ASX)  retreated 0.1
percent today, while Ireland’s ISEQ Index gained less than 0.1
percent.  U.K. stocks rallied the most since April 20 yesterday as
investors anticipated that Greek Prime Minister  George Papandreou  would win a confidence vote in his government.  Papandreou won the vote with 155 out of 300 lawmakers
backing the motion in  Athens  last night. The Greek government
still needs parliamentary approval next week for a 78 billion-
euro ($112 billion) package of budget cuts.  “Markets are less than convinced about the validity of the
Greek vote of confidence,” said  David Buik  of BGC Partners in
London. “No surprise that banks have been given a bit of a
whipping.”  Barclays, the U.K.’s second-largest bank, fell 2.6 percent
to 252.3 pence, while RBS lost 0.7 percent to 38.7 pence and
Lloyds Banking Group Plc slipped 0.7 percent to 47 pence.  HSBC lowered its recommendation for all three lenders to
“neutral” from “overweight,” warning that proposals from the
Independent Commission on Banking to ring fence retail and
investment banking units may cost the companies as much as 10
billion pounds ($16.1 billion).  Man Group Rallies  Man Group paced advancing shares, surging 4.9 percent to
241.8 pence after Goldman Sachs Group Inc. initiated coverage of
the world’s biggest publicly traded hedge fund with a “buy”
recommendation and Credit Suisse Group AG upgraded the stock to
“outperform” from “neutral.”  Separately, the  Daily Mail  reported that JPMorgan Chase &
Co. may be preparing a 400 pence-a-share friendly takeover offer
for Man. The newspaper did not cite anyone.  Randgold, a miner of the metal in west Africa, rallied 3
percent to 4,928 pence as gold climbed to a seven-week high in
 New York .  African Barrick Gold Ltd. (ABG)  rose 1.3 percent to 405
pence.  Dixons Jumps  Dixons Retail Plc (DXNS)  surged 7.7 percent to 16.5 pence on the
broader FTSE All-Share after the London-based Times reported
that Best Buy Co. may be interested in acquiring the U.K.
retailer, without citing anyone. Dixons shares dropped 13
percent in the previous five days.  Cable & Wireless Worldwide Plc (CW/)  dropped 2.5 percent to 49.9
pence after the shares rallied 8 percent over the previous two
days. The company late yesterday said it had rejected an
approach for its global business division.  The Financial Times reported on June 19 that the U.K.
telecommunications company is considering selling most of its
international assets.  To contact the reporters on this story:
