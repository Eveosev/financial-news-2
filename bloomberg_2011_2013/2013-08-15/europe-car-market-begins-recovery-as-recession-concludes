The European car market is showing the first signs of improvement as a recession ends in the 17 countries using the euro, industry executives said.  Car sales in July rose in Germany, France, the U.K. and  Spain , and the decline in  Italy  was the least this year, following a drop across the region in June to the lowest demand since 1996.  Ford Motor Co. (F) ’s deliveries last month in its 19 main European markets increased 8.7 percent from a year earlier to 90,000 cars, the Dearborn, Michigan-based company said today.  “The worst is over,” Roelant de Waard, head of sales and marketing for the Ford of  Europe  division, said in a phone interview yesterday from the unit’s headquarters in Cologne, Germany. “It’s a bit early to say that we’re now on the way up. Certainly the outlook has improved.”  Gross domestic product in the euro area rose 0.3 percent in the three months through June, led by expansions in  Germany  and France, ending a six-quarter streak of contractions, the European Union statistics office in Luxembourg said yesterday. Even so, car sales in Europe, including the non-EU countries of Switzerland, Norway and Iceland, are still projected to reach a two-decade low for the full year in a sixth annual drop.  “Markets are stabilizing in Europe and we will see some positive numbers in the second half,” Christoph Stuermer, a Frankfurt-based analyst at IHS Automotive market research company, said today by phone. “The second half of the year will be better than the first as markets are bottoming out, yet the total year will remain negative.”  Decline Forecasts  Auto sales in the region may fall to 12.1 million vehicles, 24 percent off the 2007 peak exceeding 16 million deliveries, according to a forecast provided by IHS. The market research group projects a gradual recovery starting next year with a 2.6 percent gain. That prediction contrasts with a gloomier forecast by  Carlos Ghosn , head of French carmaker  Renault SA (RNO) , who said in July that European demand may continue shrinking through 2015.  Any economic revival in the  euro zone  has yet to be matched by a recovery in hiring. Unemployment in the euro area remains at a record high of 12.1 percent, while governments have adopted spending-austerity strategies to reduce budget deficits and hold back state debt.  “The connection between economic performance, fiscal deficit and the car market is stronger than it’s ever been,” said Allan Rushforth chief operating officer of Seoul-based  Hyundai Motor Co. (005380) ’s European business, in an interview yesterday at his office in the Frankfurt suburb of Offenbach. “Europe is a very mixed picture at the moment and it will remain so for some time to come.”  Monthly Growth  Registrations in western Europe increased to 950,444 cars in July from 914,274 a year earlier in the second regionwide monthly gain in 2013, LMC Automotive research company estimated on Aug. 6. The car-sales gain in  France  was the first in the country since October 2011, according to figures reported by the Ministry of Ecology.  Ford’s July sales in Europe were bolstered by demand for the Fiesta small car, Kuga compact sport-utility vehicle and B-Max minivan. The company said today that the gain was double the industry’s 4.3 percent expansion, taking the brand’s market share to 8 percent from 7.6 percent a year earlier in the fourth consecutive month of performance that beat the market average.  The U.S. company is among carmakers struggling to restore profit in Europe. Manufacturers have sought to counter the car market’s decline by offering discounts, and Ford doesn’t expect the strategy to end soon, de Waard said.  ‘Competitive’ Pricing  “I don’t see any relief on pricing pressure at the moment,” de Waard said. “It’s still very competitive.”  European first-half car sales fell 6.7 percent to 6.44 million vehicles, according to the Brussels-based ACEA industry group. The organization is scheduled to report figures for July and August registrations on Sept. 17.  Volkswagen AG (VOW) , Europe’s biggest carmaker, narrowed the sales decline of its namesake passenger car brand in the region to 3.9 percent in July, according to figures derived by subtracting published first-half from seven-month numbers. VW’s European deliveries from January through July fell 6.8 percent from a year earlier to about 980,000 vehicles, the Wolfsburg, Germany-based company said in a  statement  on Aug. 13.  “Given that the uncertain economic conditions will continue over the coming months, we are keeping a very close eye on developments in global automotive markets,” Christian Klingler, VW’s head of sales and marketing, said in the statement.
