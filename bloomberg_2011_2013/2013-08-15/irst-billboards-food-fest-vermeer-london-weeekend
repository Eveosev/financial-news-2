Damien Hirst billboards, a foodie festival, Vermeer, and jazz in  Canary Wharf  are our choices for  London  this weekend.  STAGE  As many as 80,000 young people end up homeless in the U.K. each year. The National Theatre is giving voice to a few.  “Home” is a patchwork of interviews that director Nadia Fall conducted at a real-life foyer in East London. Her gritty production is staged inside the National’s temporary Shed space (the red four-legged structure parked outside the theater).  What makes “Home” stand out are the movement and music -- especially by beat-boxer Grace Savage, who mimics a newborn baby one minute, an ear-splitting drum machine the next.  Ends Sept. 7 at the Shed, National Theatre, SE1 9PX:  http://www.theshed.nationaltheatre.org.uk  or +44-20-7452-3244.  DINING  The new Foodies Festival at Battersea Park this weekend brings together chefs such as Ian Pengelley of Gilgamesh or Omar Allibhoy of Tapas Revolution. There are pop-up restaurants, drinks master classes, a producers’ market and a children’s cookery theater. The event runs all weekend, with tickets starting at 12 pounds. Information:  http://foodiesfestival.com/ .  Izakayas are popular in  Japan : They’re informal bars with inexpensive food. Flesh & Buns brings the formula to  Covent Garden . It’s the new venue of Ross Shonhan, whose menu includes tataki, sashimi and California rolls, as well as steaks and fish: +44-20-7632-9500 or  http://www.fleshandbuns.com/ .  VISUAL ARTS  There are no more than three dozen known works by Vermeer. Five are currently hanging in the  National Gallery’s  niche exhibition devoted to the theme of music, how it was used as a seduction tool and even an aphrodisiac.  Vermeer’s “Young Woman Seated at a Virginal” (1670-2) looks innocent enough. Yet the picture on the wall behind her shows a prostitute charming a client by playing a lute while the procuress demands payment.  Don’t overlook the other Dutch masters and period instruments in the show. “Vermeer and Music: The Art of Love and Leisure” ends Sept. 8 at the National Gallery. Information:  http://www.nationalgallery.org.uk  or +44-20-7747-2885.  MUSIC  As London rock music fans make the 40-minute journey to Chelmsford this weekend for the  V Festival  starring Beyonce and the Kings of Leon, jazz enthusiasts will have less far to go. The Canary Wharf Jazz Festival is free and features Soweto Kinch,  YolanDa Brown  and Zoe Rahman.

The 57 works chosen by the public are mostly modern and contemporary -- think Hirst and  David Hockney  -- though Holbein and Whistler have also made the cut. Nice change from the usual ads for underwear and energy drinks.  Information:  http://www.arteverywhere.org.uk .  (Farah Nayeri writes for Muse, the arts and leisure section of  Bloomberg News .
