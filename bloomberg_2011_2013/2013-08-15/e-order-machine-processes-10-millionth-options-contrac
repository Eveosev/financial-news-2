The Order Machine, a Dutch trading
venue for options, said it processed its 10 millionth contract
today as it takes business from  NYSE Euronext (NYX) ’s Liffe
derivatives market.  “We’ve seen a lot of newcomers to the market,” Willem Meijer, chief executive officer of TOM, said in a telephone
interview today. “We will continue to grow. In 2014 we will aim
for more than 50 percent market share in index options.”  TOM’s volume is driven mostly by clients using its so-called smart order router, which compares different prices on
exchanges and executes against the best available, Meijer said.
 BinckBank NV (BINCK) , a shareholder in Amsterdam-based TOM, is the only
broker using the router. Another broker will join by year-end,
he said. In addition, the broker Timber Hill LLC will become a
market maker for TOM, Meijer said.  TOM, which is 25 percent owned by Nasdaq OMX Group Inc.,
said it will increase market share in options of the
Netherlands’s benchmark AEX Index to 50 percent next year from
35 percent currently. TOM changed its ticker symbols for options
based on the AEX last month after a court ruled it infringed
NYSE Euronext’s trademark rights.  NYSE Euronext owns Liffe, bourses in Amsterdam, Brussels,
Paris and Lisbon, and the  New York  Stock Exchange. The company
has agreed to be bought by Intercontinental Exchange Inc.  To contact the reporters on this story:
