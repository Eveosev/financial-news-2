Taiwan’s  interest-rate swaps  rose to
the highest level since June 2011 on speculation the  Federal
Reserve  will start cutting bond purchases next month that have
driven demand for emerging-market assets.  Five-year contracts have climbed 32 basis points since Fed
Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  indicated on May 22 that the central
bank could pare its monetary stimulus, compared with a 33 basis-point increase on benchmark 10-year bond yields. Global funds
sold $235 million more Taiwanese shares than they bought today,
taking net sales this month to $1.4 billion, according to
exchange data.  “At the moment, short-selling of bonds is difficult as
liquidity isn’t good enough,” said Ray Cheng, a fixed-income
trader at Sinopac Securities Corp. in Taipei, referring to a
trade where investors sell a borrowed asset in the hope of
buying it back at a lower price. “Interest-rate swaps are a
better tool to bet on rising yields.”  The swaps were little changed at 1.37 percent as of 4:56
p.m. in Taipei and touched 1.38 percent earlier, the highest
level since June 2011, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The  overnight interbank lending rate  was little changed at
0.385 percent, a weighted average compiled by the Taiwan
Interbank Money Center showed.  Taiwan Dollar  Ten-year government debt fell for a third day, with the
yield rising one basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 1.62
percent, according to Gretai Securities Market. The yield on the
0.875 percent notes due January 2018 dropped one basis point to
1.155 percent.  The  Taiwan dollar  was little changed at NT$30.035 against
its U.S. counterpart, compared with NT$30.032 yesterday, Taipei
Forex Inc. prices show. The currency was 0.1 percent stronger 15
minutes before the 4 p.m. close.  The central bank has sold its currency in the run-up to the
close on most days since March 2012, according to traders who
asked not to be identified.  One-month non-deliverable forwards rose 0.1 percent to
NT$29.93 per dollar, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
One-month implied volatility, a gauge of expected moves in the
 exchange rate  used to price options, gained four basis points to
3.49 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
