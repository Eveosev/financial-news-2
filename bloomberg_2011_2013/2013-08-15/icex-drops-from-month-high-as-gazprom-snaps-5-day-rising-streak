Russian stocks fell after climbing
to the highest level in a month and OAO Gazprom, the natural-gas
export monopoly with the biggest weighting in the benchmark
index, snapped five days of gains.  The  Micex Index (INDEXCF)  lost 0.9 percent to 1,410.87 as of 3:23
p.m. in Moscow. The gauge rose to the strongest since July 17
yesterday. Gazprom sank 0.9 percent to 133.30 rubles after
advancing 7.7 percent in the previous five days. OAO Sberbank,
Russia’s largest lender and the third-biggest stock by weighting
in the Micex, dropped 1.4 percent to 96.60 rubles.  The 14-day  relative strength index  on the Micex subsided to
57 from 63 yesterday, the highest in three weeks. The RSI
measures how rapidly prices have advanced or dropped during a
specified time period. Readings below 30 indicate a security may
be poised to rise, while those above 70 signal a potential drop.
Sixty-five percent of economists surveyed by Bloomberg predict
the U.S. Federal Reserve will opt next month to pare bond-buying
that helped fuel a rally in emerging-market assets.  “Russian markets are undergoing a slight correction,”
Vadim Bit-Avragim, a portfolio manager at Kapital asset
Management in Moscow, said by phone. “The uncertainty of not
knowing what the Fed will do is weighing on the markets.”  The Micex rallied 4.5 percent in the four days through Aug.
14. The dollar-denominated RTS Index dropped 0.7 percent to
1,347.17.  Equities in  Russia , the world’s biggest energy exporter,
sank even as Brent crude advanced to its highest intraday level
in more than four months. Worsening violence in  Egypt  fanned
concern that Middle East oil supplies may be disrupted.  Brent climbed 0.7 percent to $110.93 a barrel in  London .
Russia receives about half of its budget revenue from oil and
natural gas sales. OAO Lukoil, the nation’s biggest non-state
controlled crude producer, fell 0.5 percent to 1,969.10 rubles.  To contact the reporter on this story:
