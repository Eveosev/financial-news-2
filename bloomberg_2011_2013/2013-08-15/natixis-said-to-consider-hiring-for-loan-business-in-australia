Natixis SA (KN) , the investment-banking
unit of  France ’s second-largest bank by branches, is considering
hiring loan bankers in Australia after curbing operations there
last year, two people familiar with the situation said.  The lender is looking to hire people in leveraged and
project finance-related roles in the country, the people said,
asking not to be identified because the details are private.
Isaure Gruffaz, a Paris-based spokeswoman for the  bank , declined
to comment on any hiring plans.  Natixis is considering the boost in lending activity as
Lloyds Banking Group Plc, Britain’s biggest mortgage lender,
tries to sell its unprofitable Australian business.  Westpac
Banking Corp. (WBC) , National Australia Bank Ltd. and Macquarie Group
Ltd. have made bids for the assets in  Australia , two other
people familiar with the matter said this week.  In January last year, Natixis closed its Australian
origination activities in project and acquisitions finance,
according to documents filed with the Australian Securities &
Investments Commission. European banks have been forced to scale
back offshore business units to preserve balance sheets as
liquidity deteriorated during the sovereign debt crisis.  Natixis’s net profit in Australia almost halved to A$7.7
million in fiscal year 2012, when its main activity in the
nation was providing financial guarantees to group companies,
according to documents filed with the Australian Securities &
Investments Commission.  To contact the reporter on this story:
