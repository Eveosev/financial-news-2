Steel reinforcement-bar futures
advanced for the 11th time in 12 days in  Shanghai  as rising
power consumption buoyed optimism for demand from industry.  Rebar for January delivery rose as much as 0.4 percent to
3,833 yuan ($627) a metric ton on the Shanghai Futures Exchange,
and was at 3,822 yuan a ton at 10:01 a.m. local time.  Power use by companies in mining, manufacturing and
construction increased 8.1 percent last month from a year
earlier to 366.6 billion kilowatt-hours, data from the National

that’s lending bullish support to the futures market too,” said
Zhang Lei, an analyst at Nanhua Futures Co. in Shenyang.  The average  spot price  for rebar rose 0.5 percent to 3,559
 yuan  a ton yesterday, the highest since May 20, according to
