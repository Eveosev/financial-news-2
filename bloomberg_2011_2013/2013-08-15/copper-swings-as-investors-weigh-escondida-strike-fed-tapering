Copper swung between gains and
losses as investors weighed a strike in the world’s biggest
copper mine against the timing of the U.S. Federal Reserve’s
tapering of stimulus.  Futures for delivery in three months on the London Metal
Exchange were little changed at $7,312.50 per metric ton at
10:51 a.m. in  Shanghai , after gaining as much as 0.4 percent and
losing as much as 0.1 percent. The metal touched $7,354.75 on
Aug. 13, the highest since June 7.  Most of the workers at  BHP Billiton Ltd. (BHP) ’s Escondida mine
in  Chile  agreed to a one-day strike today, according to a labor
union. A report today may show U.S. jobless claims fell in the
week to Aug. 3, fueling speculation that has 65 percent of
economists surveyed by Bloomberg predicting the Fed will pare
bond purchases next month.  “All eyes are on the Fed’s meeting next month,” said Jia
Zheng, an analyst at East Asia Futures Co. in Shanghai. “Still,
the Escondida strike will tighten supply if it continues.”  The contract for delivery in December rose 0.2 percent to
52,260  yuan  ($8,545) a ton on the Shanghai Futures Exchange. 
Stockpiles fell to the lowest since September in warehouses
monitored by the SHFE last week.  Futures for delivery in December dropped 0.5 percent to
$3.324 a pound on the Comex in New York. On the LME, aluminum
was little changed, while zinc, nickel, tin and lead fell.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
