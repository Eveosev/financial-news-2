China ’s one-year interest-rate swap
climbed for a fifth day, poised for the longest run of gains in
eight weeks, as the central bank refrained from lowering
borrowing costs in money-market operations today.  The People’s Bank of China conducted 28 billion yuan ($4.58
billion) of 14-day reverse-repurchase agreements at 4.1 percent,
according to a statement on its website. That matches the  rate 
at the last auction on Aug. 8 and compares with 4.50 percent on
Aug. 1, when the contracts were made available for the first
time since February. Seven-day reverse repos were  conducted  at
3.9 percent on Aug. 13, down from 4 percent last week and 4.4
percent on July 30.  “Today’s reverse-repo rate didn’t go down further, so
market rates will probably continue climbing in the next few
days,” said Guo Caomin, an analyst at Industrial Bank Co. in
 Shanghai . “Frankly, the central bank’s recent moves have
created some confusion regarding its true intentions. The market
is waiting to see clearer signals.”  The one-year swap contract, the fixed cost needed to
receive the floating seven-day repurchase rate, rose three basis
points, or 0.03 percentage point, to 4.03 percent as of 10:50
a.m. in Shanghai, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. It
touched this month’s high of 4.06 percent.  The  seven-day repo rate , a gauge of cash availability,
climbed 12 basis points to a one-week high of 3.99 percent,
according to a weighted average compiled by the National
Interbank Funding Center. It has averaged 3.92 percent this year
and touched a record 11.62 percent on June 20. the height of a
cash crunch that was engineered by the central bank to address
risks in the banking system.  Deposits Auction  The monetary authority auctioned 50 billion  yuan  of three-month deposits on behalf of the Ministry of Finance today at a
rate of 4.69 percent, according to a statement on its website.
The rate was high than the 4.3 percent paid for a similar amount
of three-month deposits at the last sale on July 18.  The yield on the government’s 3.38 percent bonds due May
2023 was unchanged today at 3.99 percent, according to prices
from the Interbank Funding Center. That is the highest rate for
a benchmark 10-year note since September 2011, ChinaBond data
show.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
