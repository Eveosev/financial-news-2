More people in  California  are paying
too much for water when factoring in household income levels,
according to the Pacific Institute.  Water in the Golden State is less affordable than policy
makers may realize, the group said. The Sacramento area has
100,000 households exceeding a 2 percent “affordability
threshold” for water bills, according to a  statement  today from
the Oakland, California-based institute. Eighteen percent of
Tulare Lake basin systems had unaffordable rates, it also said.  The study was released as precipitation in the most
populous U.S. state for January through May registered its
lowest level in about 90 years. Poseidon Resources Group is
developing the largest desalination plant in the Western
Hemisphere in Carlsbad, California, to provide 50 million
gallons of drinking water daily to the San Diego area.  The U.S. awarded almost $21 million to California,  Nevada 
and nine other states in May to encourage homeowners to replace
thirsty lawns with drought-resistant plants and conserve water.  To contact the reporter on this story:
