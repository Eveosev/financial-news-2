Japanese power companies cut their
consumption of crude and  fuel oil  in July from a year earlier as
two nuclear reactors reduced the country’s reliance on more
expensive sources to generate electricity.  Japan ’s 10 regional power utilities used 1.09 million
kiloliters of fuel oil, 13 percent less than a year earlier,
according to data released by the  Federation of Electric Power
Cos. of Japan  today. Crude demand fell 7.3 percent to about
846,000 kiloliters, the data shows.  Kansai Electric Power Co. restarted two 1,180-megawatt
reactors at its Ohi plant in western Japan in July 2012, ending
a two-month nuclear-free period after the Fukushima disaster in
March 2011. The country, where nuclear power provided about 30
percent of electricity prior to the disaster, would have no
operating reactors again next month if the two Ohi reactors are
shut as scheduled for regular maintenance by September 15.  The 10 power companies generated and purchased 83.21
billion kilowatt-hours of electricity last month, up 1.7 percent
from a year earlier, the power federation said today, citing
power demand for air conditioning.  The average temperature in Tokyo’s Otemachi financial
district in July was 27.3 degrees Celsius (81 degrees
Fahrenheit), compared with the monthly average of 25.8 degrees
Celsius between 1981 and 2010, according to data compiled by the
 Japan Meteorological Agency .  The following table shows Japanese utilities’ consumption
and purchases of fuel oil, crude, LNG and coal in July. Fuel oil
and crude volumes are in kiloliters, while those for LNG and
coal are in tons.  Source: The Federation of Electric Power Cos. of Japan  To contact the reporter on this story:
