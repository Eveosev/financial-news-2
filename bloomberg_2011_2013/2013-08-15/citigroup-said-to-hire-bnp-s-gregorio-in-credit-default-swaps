Citigroup Inc. (C)  has hired Glen Gregorio, a derivatives trader at BNP Paribas SA for the past
three years, according to a person with knowledge of the matter.  Gregorio will join Citigroup’s credit-default swaps group
in New York, said the person, who asked not to be identified
because the move hasn’t been announced. He departed BNP as of
July 31, spokeswoman Cesaltine Gregorio said in a telephone
interview.  Danielle Romero-Apsilos, a spokeswoman for New York-based
Citigroup, declined to comment. Gregorio didn’t respond to e-mail messages requesting an interview.  Gregorio started at BNP in August 2010 and worked at
Deutsche Bank AG from 2002 through 2010, according to  records 
from the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority.  To contact the reporter on this story:
