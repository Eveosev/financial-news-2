Mexico’s government will send a bill
to Congress in September to improve state-owned Petroleos
Mexicanos’s capacity to invest in projects by reducing the oil
company’s tax burden, Finance Minister Luis Videgaray said.  The bill, which comes as the government tries to give other
companies access to Mexican oilfields, would lower Pemex’s
royalties and license fees, Videgaray wrote in  an article  posted
on the ministry website today. To partially compensate for lower
fees, Pemex would start paying income taxes on its drilling and
exploration operations, he said.  The world’s fifth-largest crude oil producer, whose taxes
fund about 34 percent of the  federal budget , is headed for its
ninth straight year of output declines, according to Pemex.
President Enrique Pena Nieto sent a bill to Congress this week
to arrest Mexico’s production declines by enticing private firms
to develop oilfields in the country for the first time since
1938.  “It’s time to give Pemex a new tax regime,” Videgaray
wrote. “A decision would be made whether the largest remaining
resources are reinvested in the company or if a part is
transferred to the Treasury as a dividend.”  The yield on dollar-denominated Pemex bonds due in Jan.
2023 rose two basis points at 2:07 p.m. in Mexico City to 4.61
percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
