The U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission said it’s working to post a backlog of corporate
filings on a day when investors await quarterly reports on
holdings by investment firms including  Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (BRK/A)   The SEC’s system for receiving documents from companies
“remained up and running and able to accept filings throughout
the day, but dissemination of the filings stopped at 3:43 p.m.”
in Washington, said  John Nester , an SEC spokesman. “We have
since restored the dissemination service and are processing the
backlog of filings,” he said today, without elaborating on what
caused the delay.  Institutional money managers overseeing $100 million or
more of equities listed on U.S. exchanges must file a Form 13F
within 45 days of the end of a quarter. The forms list the
number of shares held in each company and the market value of
the stake on the period’s final trading day. Managers also are
required to include information on some convertible debt
securities and exchange-traded options.  Today was the deadline for second-quarter filings. While
the SEC released 13Fs from firms including Daniel Loeb’s Third
Point LLC and  George Soros ’s Soros Fund Management LLC minutes
before 6 p.m. in New York, the report by Omaha, Nebraska-based
Berkshire, led by  Warren Buffett , wasn’t posted as of 8 p.m.  To contact the reporter on this story:
