Most Hong Kong  stocks  rose as the
bourse reopened after being shut yesterday for a typhoon. Shares
advanced as utilities climbed and Li & Fung led gains even after
missing earnings estimates.  The  Hang Seng Index (HSI)  gained 0.2 percent to 22,585.87 as of
9:33 a.m. in Hong Kong, with 28 shares rising on the 50-member
gauge. The Hang Seng China Enterprises Index added 0.4 percent
to 10,223.30.  The  Hang Seng Index  retreated 0.5 percent this year through
Aug. 13 the only decline among developed markets tracked by
Bloomberg, amid concern China’s growth is slowing and
speculation the  Federal Reserve  will pare stimulus this year.
The gauge traded at 10.76 times estimated earnings on Aug. 13,
compared with 15.28 for the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index
yesterday.  Hong Kong Exchanges & Clearing Ltd. scrapped trading
yesterday, airlines canceled flights and the government shut
schools for the first typhoon of the year. The bourse will
announce earnings today after delaying the annoucement due to
the storm.  The  Hang Seng China Enterprises Index (HSCEI)  of mainland stocks
traded in Hong Kong, also known as the H-share index, fell 17
percent through Aug. 13 from a Feb. 1 high. The index traded at
1.23 times book value on Aug. 13, compared with a five-year
average of 1.77.  Materials and energy companies led declines this year on
the Hang Seng Composite Index amid concern weaker expansion in
China will sap demand. Utility and information-technology shares
were the biggest gainers.  Futures on the  S&P 500  fell 0.1 percent today. The equity
gauge lost 0.5 percent in  New York  yesterday after economists
predicted the Fed will reduce stimulus in September as European
data added to signs that the global economy is strengthening.  The central bank, led by Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke , will
probably reduce its $85 billion in monthly bond purchases at its
meeting on Sept. 17-18, according to 65 percent of economists
surveyed by Bloomberg from Aug. 9 to Aug. 13. In a survey last
month, half of economists predicted tapering in September.  Data yesterday showed the euro area’s economy emerged from
a record-long recession in the second quarter, led by Germany
and France. Gross domestic product expanded 0.3 percent after a
0.3 percent contraction in the first quarter, the European
Union’s statistics office said. The region’s economy had
contracted six straight quarters, the longest slump since the
euro’s debut in 1999.  To contact the reporter on this story:
