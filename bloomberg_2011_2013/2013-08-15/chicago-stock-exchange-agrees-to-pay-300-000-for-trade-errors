Chicago Stock Exchange Inc. agreed
to pay $300,000 to settle U.S. regulatory claims that it failed
to comply with rules designed to ensure all investors get the
best prices.  Some brokers were able to abuse a component of the
exchange’s order-matching system to obtain better prices at the
expense of other investors, according to an order from the
Securities and Exchange Commission made public today. One broker
manipulated the system to advantage hedge-fund clients at the
expense of other traders, the order said.  The exchange, which has averaged 0.4 percent of daily U.S.
equity volume in 2013, didn’t implement policies designed to
detect and prevent such misconduct from 2006 to 2010, the SEC
said. The exchange also didn’t implement surveillance procedures
to monitor brokers’ use of its system from 2006 to 2008, the SEC
said.  “The validated cross system permitted institutional
brokers to execute transactions at stale prices within
previously captured NBBO,” or national best bid and offer, the
SEC said in the order. “The system was thus not reasonably
designed to prevent validated cross trades from trading through
the NBBO prevailing at the time of execution.”  A phone message seeking comment from Chicago Stock Exchange
Chief Executive Officer David A. Herron was not immediately
returned.  To contact the reporter on this story:
