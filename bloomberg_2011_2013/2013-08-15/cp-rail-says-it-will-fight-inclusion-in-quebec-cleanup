Canadian Pacific Railway Ltd. (CP)  said
it will contest Quebec’s decision to add the railroad to an
emergency decontamination order in the wake of the train
disaster that killed 47 people in the province last month.  Quebec Environment Minister Yves-Francois Blanchet
yesterday added CP Rail to the list of companies targeted by the
order. The legal notice requires companies including Montreal,
Maine & Atlantic Railway Ltd. to recover oil and other
contaminants and submit a cleanup plan to the government.  “As a matter of fact and law CP is not responsible for
this cleanup,”  Ed Greenberg , a spokesman for  Canadian Pacific ,
said in a telephone interview. “CP will be appealing.”  Canadian Pacific had carried the tank cars from North
Dakota to Montreal, where it interchanged with Montreal, Maine &
Atlantic.  To contact the reporter on this story:
