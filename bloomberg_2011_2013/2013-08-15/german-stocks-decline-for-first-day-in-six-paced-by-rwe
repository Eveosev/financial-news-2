German stocks  dropped for the first
day in six, with the benchmark  DAX (DAX)  Index falling from its
highest level since May, as investors awaited U.S. data for
further evidence of a rebound in the global economy.  RWE AG (RWE)  extended yesterday’s loss as analysts cut earnings
estimates on the utility and amid concern the stock may exit the
Euro Stoxx 50 Index.  The DAX slipped 0.4 percent to 8,407.54 at 10:42 a.m. in
Frankfurt. The measure has still  rallied 9.3 percent  from its
low on June 24 as the  European Central Bank  said  interest rates 
will remain low for an extended period, while gauges of
manufacturing and gross domestic product in the region exceeded
forecasts. The broader HDAX Index retreated 0.3 percent today.  In the U.S., a Labor Department report at 8:30 a.m. in
Washington may show more Americans applied for  unemployment
benefits  last week. Jobless claims in the week ended Aug. 10
increased to 335,000, from 333,000 a week earlier, according to
the median forecast of economists surveyed by Bloomberg.  The volume of shares changing hands in DAX-listed companies
was 32 percent lower than the average of the past 30 days,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  RWE fell 2.5 percent to 20.83 euros. Exane BNP Paribas cut
its 2014 profit estimate for Germany’s second-largest utility by
3 percent and by 12 percent for 2015. Exane analyst Christophe Wakim separately wrote that RWE risks being removed from the
Euro Stoxx 50 after a 33 percent drop in its shares this year.  Nordex SE (NDX1)  jumped 12 percent to 8.50 euros, its biggest gain
since March 11. The maker of wind turbines reported first-half
sales and pre-tax earnings that beat analysts’ estimates, and
raised its forecasts for full-year sales and profit margins.  To contact the reporter on this story:
