The ruble gained the most in two
weeks as monthly tax payments bolstered demand for the Russian
currency from exporters in the world’s biggest energy supplier.  The ruble climbed 0.4 percent to 37.7668 against the
central bank’s euro-dollar basket by 12:16 p.m. in Moscow, the
strongest advance on a closing basis since Aug. 2. The yield on
the government’s ruble bond due 2027 fell four basis points, or
0.04 percentage point, to 7.69 percent.  Companies must pay about 80 billion ($2.4 billion) to 100
billion rubles in taxes today, with 530 billion rubles due in
total in August, OAO Promsvyazbank analyst Alexei Egorov said in
an e-mailed note on August 14. Brent crude gained for a fifth
consecutive day in  London , rising 0.5 percent to $110.74 a
barrel. Oil is  Russia ’s main export earner.  “There’s good demand for the ruble on large tax
payments,” Vladimir Miklashevsky, a trading desk strategist at
 Danske Bank A/S (DANSKE)  in Helsinki, said in e-mailed comments. Demand
will continue to be “strong” next week as companies make
value-added tax payments, he said.  The ruble strengthened 0.6 percent against the dollar to
32.8850 and advanced 0.3 percent against the euro to 43.7220.  Oil above $110 per barrel and the ruble 0.3 percent weaker
against the dollar this month are a “fantastic gift” for
exporters, Dmitry Polevoy, an economist at ING Groep NV in
Moscow, said in an e-mailed note.  The central bank raised the ruble’s trading corridor by
another 5 kopeks to 32 to 39 rubles against the basket from Aug.
14, according to a statement today. Bank Rossii shifts the band
every time the accumulated amount of its non-targeted
interventions reaches $450 million.  Currency Sales  The regulator, which reports interventions with a lag, sold
the equivalent of 10.79 billion rubles of foreign currency on
Aug. 13 compared with 6.59 billion rubles the previous day, it
said on its website.  The Russian currency has declined about 8 percent against
the dollar-euro basket since the beginning of 2013. That
compares with a 6 percent drop for JPMorgan Chase & Co.’s  index
of emerging-market currencies  and a 4.2 percent increase for
Brent oil.  To contact the reporter on this story:
