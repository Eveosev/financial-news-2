U.K. stocks  declined for a second
day before reports that may show British retail sales and U.S.
jobless claims climbed last month.  AstraZeneca Plc (AZN)  headed for its largest two-day drop in more
than seven weeks as Morgan Stanley recommended investors sell
the shares.  Antofagasta Plc (ANTO)  lost 1.3 percent as JPMorgan Chase &
Co. downgraded its rating on the copper producer.  Ophir Energy
Plc (OPHR)  slumped 7.3 percent after saying exploration costs
contributed to a loss for the first half of this year.  The  FTSE 100 Index (UKX)  dropped 0.4 percent to 6,559.6 at 8:32
a.m. in London. The equity benchmark has still gained 8.8
percent since its low on June 24 as the Bank of England gave
forward guidance on  interest rates  for the first time. The
broader FTSE All-Share Index slipped 0.5 percent today, while
Irelandâ€™s ISEQ Index lost 0.4 percent.  The number of shares trading hands in FTSE 100-listed
companies was 13 percent lower than the average of the past 30
days, data compiled by Bloomberg showed.  A report at 9:30 a.m. will probably show  U.K. retail sales 
including automobiles increased 0.7 percent in July, according
to the median estimate of economists surveyed by Bloomberg.
Sales rose 0.2 percent in June.  In the U.S., a Labor Department report at 8:30 a.m. in
Washington may show more Americans applied for  unemployment
benefits  last week.  Jobless claims  in the week ended Aug. 10
advanced to 335,000, from 333,000 a week earlier, according to
the median forecast of economists surveyed by Bloomberg.  Separately, a Federal Reserve release at 9:15 a.m. New York
time may show that output from U.S. factories, mines and
utilities climbed 0.3 percent in July, economists predicted.
That would match the pace for the prior month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
