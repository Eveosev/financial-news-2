Fidson Healthcare Plc (FIDSON) , a Nigerian
drugmaker, expects revenue growth of 40 percent next year driven
by sales from a new plant in  Africa ’s second-largest economy,
Chief Financial Officer Olatunde Olanipekun said.  Fidson had first-half revenue of 4.66 billion-naira ($29
million), up 31 percent on the prior period, the company said
last month. Fidson is constructing a 5 billion naira facility
that will produce about 10 infusion drugs and comply with World
Health Organization standards, Olanipekun said in an interview
yesterday in Lagos.  “That will increase the number of drugs produced and
marketed by the company to 140,” he said.  The company, based in Lagos, is targeting a home market of
more than 160 million people for its cardiovascular,
antiretroviral, anti-diabetic and infusion drugs, Olanipekun
said. Fidson started an expansion program in 2009 after raising
3.5 billion naira in a private placement.  “By building a WHO compliant plant, we want to be an
international company that can bid for tenders anywhere in the
world,” Olanipekun said, adding that a team from the WHO will
visit the company next year to inspect the facilities and pre-qualify its products.  “Over the long term we think we will have exceeded the
demand of the Nigerian market due to expansion,” Olanipekun
said. “We’ll move to West Africa, preferably Ghana, Liberia and
 Ivory Coast .”  Fidson’s shares fell 3.3 percent to 2.05 naira at the close
in Lagos. The stock has risen 93 percent this year, compared
with a 32 percent increase in the  Nigerian Stock Exchange All-Share Index. (NGSEINDX)   To contact the reporter on this story:
