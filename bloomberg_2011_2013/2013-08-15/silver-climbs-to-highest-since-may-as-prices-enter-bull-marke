Silver futures rose to the highest
since May, entering a  bull market , as equities slumped and the
dollar declined, increasing demand for the precious metal as an
alternative investment.  The MSCI All-Country World Index of shares headed for the
biggest drop in seven weeks. The Bloomberg  Dollar Index , a gauge
against 10 major currencies, fell as much as 0.5 percent,
declining for the second straight day. Gold rose to an eight-week high. Holdings in exchange-traded funds backed by silver
rose to a record 19,890 metric tons yesterday and are up 5.1
percent this year.  “We are seeing  money flow  into precious metals from stocks
today,”  Frank McGhee , the head dealer at Integrated Brokerage
Services LLC in Chicago, said in a telephone interview. “The
weakness in the dollar is also a big support.”  Silver futures for September delivery advanced 5.3 percent
to settle at $22.935 an ounce at 1:49 p.m. on the Comex in  New
York , the biggest jump since July 22. Earlier, prices rose to
$23.19, the highest since May 22. Trading was 72 percent higher
than the average in the past 100 days, data compiled by
Bloomberg show.  Prices have jumped 24 percent from a 34-month closing low
on June 27 as the dollar heads for a second straight monthly
drop and physical demand surges. Sales of American Eagle silver
coins by the  U.S. Mint  were 31 million ounces so far this year,
compared with 33.7 million ounces sold in all of 2012, data on
the website  showed .  The U.S. Mint had suspended sales of silver coins for more
than a week because of a lack of inventory in January.  “Physical demand has been very strong,” McGhee said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
