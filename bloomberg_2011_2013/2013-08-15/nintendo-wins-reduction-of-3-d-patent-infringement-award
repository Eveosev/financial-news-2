Nintendo Co. won a 50 percent
reduction of the $30.2 million in damages a jury awarded to a
former  Sony Corp. (6758)  employee who claimed the company’s 3DS game
and video player infringed his 3-D technology patent.  “The jury’s damages award was at least twice as large as
the amount a reasonable jury could have awarded based on the
evidence presented at trial and thereby must have involved the
degree of excessive speculation that shocks the judicial
conscience,” U.S. District Judge Jed Rakoff in Manhattan said
in a decision yesterday.  The judge gave plaintiff Seijiro Tomita and his company the
choice of accepting $15.1 million in damages or undertaking a
new trial on damages.  Tomita, who worked for Sony for almost 30 years before
quitting in 2002, sued Nintendo in June 2011. That year
Nintendo, the world’s biggest video-game console maker,
introduced the 3DS, which allows users to see 3-D images without
special glasses.  Joe Diamante, a lawyer for Tomita, didn’t immediately
respond to a call to his office after regular business hours
yesterday seeking comment on the judge’s ruling.  “Nintendo will appeal the jury’s verdict and reduced
damages award,” Charlie Scibetta, senior director of Nintendo
of America’s corporate communications, said in an e-mailed
statement.  Nintendo fell 2 percent to 12,380 yen in  Tokyo  at the 11:30
a.m. trading break. The benchmark Nikkei 225 Stock Average
slipped 1.6 percent.  The case is Tomita Technologies USA LLC v.  Nintendo Co. (7974) ,
11-cv-04256, U.S. District Court, Southern District of  New York 
(Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
