Corn futures in  South Africa  gained
after a government report showed that deliveries for the grain
are at the lowest level this season.  White corn for delivery in December, the most active
contract, rose 1.3 percent to 2,324.80 rand ($234) a metric ton
by the midday close on the South African Futures Exchange. The
yellow variety, for September delivery, climbed 1.2 percent to
2,126 rand a ton.  South Africa delivered 118,406 tons of both varieties in
the week through Aug. 9, the smallest amount since the season
started on April 27, according to the country’s grain
information service. Drought in corn-growing provinces has cut
output of both crops, with the harvest estimated to be smaller
in the year through April than in 2010, which was the largest
harvest since 1982, acccording to the Crop Estimates Committee.  “Prices are on the rise today on concern coming from the
tapering off of deliveries,” Andrew Fletcher, an independent
trader in Kroonstad in the Free State province, said by phone.  Farmers are expected to produce 11.4 million tons of corn
this season, the committee said in its sixth prediction for the
year. That compares with 11.8 million tons in the 2012 season.
The next forecast is scheduled for Aug. 27.  South Africa is the continent’s largest producer of corn
with the white grain being the main staple food, while the
yellow variety is mainly used as  animal feed .  Wheat for delivery in December fell 0.7 percent 3,307 rand
a ton.  To contact the reporter on this story:
