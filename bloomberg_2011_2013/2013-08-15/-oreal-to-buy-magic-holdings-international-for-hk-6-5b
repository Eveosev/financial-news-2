L’Oreal SA, (OR)  the world’s largest
cosmetics maker, agreed to buy China’s  Magic Holdings
International Ltd. (1633)  for HK$6.54 billion ($843 million) to expand
in a market where sales growth is outpacing that of the company.  L’Oreal will pay HK$6.30 a share in cash for Magic, the
companies said yesterday, 25 percent more than the last traded
price of HK$5.05. Magic  surged  as much as 21 percent in  Hong
Kong  trading today, headed for the biggest gain since its
listing in September 2010.  The acquisition gives L’Oreal the top-selling facial mask
brand in China, where beauty and personal-care product sales
will expand 8 percent to $34 billion this year, according to
Euromonitor estimates. Paris-based L’Oreal last month posted
second-quarter sales growth that missed estimates amid the
weakest performance in  North America  for two years.  “China is still a 1.3 billion population market and
personal care is growing,” said  Norman Chan , the Hong Kong-based head of investment at Calibre Asset Management Ltd. “The
faster growing markets are the low- to mid-end, which the
domestic companies would have a better foothold” in than
L’Oreal, said Chan, who doesn’t own either company’s shares.  Magic sells MG-branded beauty products such as facial masks
with snail essence. The company, which established MG 10 years
ago, is the facial-mask industry leader in China with a 26.4
percent share as of 2012, Magic said on its  website , citing data
from AC Nielsen.  Stock Gains  Magic climbed 19 percent to HK$6.01 at the close of trading
in Hong Kong, while the city’s  Hang Seng Index  fell 0.1 percent.
The stock has advanced 69 percent this year.  L’Oreal  shares  rose 0.4 percent to 129.45 euros in Paris,
extending this year’s gain to 23 percent.  Facial masks are one of the fastest-growing areas in
 China ’s beauty market, with “very promising development
prospects,” L’Oreal said in a  statement .  Magic has 288 distributors in 32 provinces and regions in
China, according to its  website .  “This should allow L’Oreal to accelerate the growth of its
own brands in China through a greater distribution reach,” said
Chas Manso de Zuniga, an  analyst  at Societe Generale SA.  The cosmetics maker is paying 20 times Magic’s 2012
earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization,
Manso de Zuniga estimated.  Net income in the six months ended Dec. 31 rose 21 percent
from a year earlier to HK$100 million ($13 million), Magic  said .
Sales gained 31 percent to HK$821.4 million.  China Growth  L’Oreal entered China in 1997 and has 3,500 employees in
the country. The company’s first-half sales rose 5.4 percent,
excluding currency fluctuations, to  11.7 billion euros  ($15.6
billion). L’Oreal’s first-half revenue in China climbed 11
percent on a similar basis, the company said in July.  The cosmetics maker plans to pay for the acquisition from
internal resources. BNP Paribas SA, L’Oreal’s adviser, offered
the company a 650 million-euro credit facility to help fund the
purchase if needed, according to the filing.  L’Oreal said Magic’s board, as well as shareholders
representing 62 percent of the company’s equity, support the
proposed transaction.  --Celeste Perri,  Julie Cruz , Liza Lin. Editors: Lena Lee,
