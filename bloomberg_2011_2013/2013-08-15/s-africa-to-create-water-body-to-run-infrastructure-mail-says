South Africa plans to create an
agency to build and manage water infrastructure, the Financial
Mail reported, citing the Department of Water Affairs.  The agency will work like state power-generator Eskom
Holdings SOC Ltd., owning, financing, operating and maintaining
water infrastructure such as dams and pipelines, the weekly
magazine reported, citing a department strategy document.  The plan hasnâ€™t yet been formally announced by Edna Molewa,
the water affairs minister, the Financial Mail said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
