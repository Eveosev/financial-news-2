Facebook Inc. (FB) , owner of the world’s
most popular social-networking service, unveiled a new $6.5
billion credit line that replaces two separate facilities for
borrowing money in the same amount.  The Menlo Park, California-based company terminated a
previously held $5 billion revolving credit facility that it
hadn’t drawn down, according to a regulatory filing today.
Facebook also had a $1.5 billion loan facility -- used for
paying taxes tied to its 2012 initial public offering -- that it
recently repaid, the company said.  The new five-year credit facility will be used to fund
“working capital and general corporate purposes,” with
interest at the London Interbank Offered Rate, or Libor, plus 1
percent.  JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM)  is the administrative agent for
the new  credit line , as well as the previous facility and loan.  Facebook is streamlining its access to credit as it
strengthens its financial performance. The company last month
said second-quarter sales rose 53 percent to $1.81 billion,
topping analysts’ estimates of $1.62 billion.  To contact the reporter on this story:
