Alfonso Soriano  hit two home runs
for the second consecutive game and drove in a career-high seven
runs as the  New York Yankees  won their fourth straight game,
11-3 against the Los Angeles Angels.  Soriano, 37, hit a grand slam in the first inning, a two-run double in the second and a solo home run in the fifth before
walking in the seventh at Yankee Stadium last night. Two nights
ago Soriano, who was acquired by the Yankees on July 26 from the
 Chicago Cubs , drove in six runs.  Soriano became one of three Major League Baseball players
since 1920 to drive in at least six runs in consecutive games,
joining  Milwaukee ’s Geoff Jenkins on April 28-29, 2001, and
Texas’ Rusty Greer on Aug. 22-23, 1997.  Soriano’s 13 runs batted in over two games rank second in
Yankees history to Tony Lazzeri, who drove in 15 runs on May
23-24, 1936, according to the Elias Sports Bureau.  The Yankees are in fourth place in the American League
East, 8 1/2 games behind the division-leading  Boston Red Sox ,
who lost 4-3 to the Toronto Blue Jays in 10 innings last night.  Yankees starter Ivan Nova (6-4) got the win after allowing
three runs on 10 hits in 7 1/3 innings. Jered Weaver (7-6), who
gave up the two home runs to Soriano, surrendered nine runs on
nine hits in five innings for the Angels.  Robinson Cano and  Curtis Granderson  each hit run-scoring
singles in the second inning before Soriano hit his double to
give the Yankees an 8-0 lead.  Cano went 4-for-4 to surpass Phil Rizzuto for sole
possession of 15th place in franchise history with 1,590 hits.  Chris Stewart hit a two-run single in the seventh to end
the scoring for the Yankees.  To contact the reporter on this story:
