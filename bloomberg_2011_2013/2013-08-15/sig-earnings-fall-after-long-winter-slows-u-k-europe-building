SIG Plc (SHI) , a U.K. distributor of
insulation to builders, said first-half earnings declined after
extended winter weather slowed construction in  Europe  and cut
demand for the company’s products.  Underlying operating profit excluding amortization and one-time items dropped 13 percent to 36.2 million pounds ($56.2
million), as revenue fell 0.2 percent to 1.28 billion pounds,
the Sheffield, England-based company said in a statement today.
Revenue declined 4.5 percent on a like-for-like basis in
continental Europe.  “While there are signs that market conditions are starting
to improve in the U.K., construction activity in mainland Europe
remains weak,” Chief Executive Officer Stuart Mitchell said in
the statement.  There were signs of improvement in the U.K. toward the end
of the half, with increased activity in the residential sector
and the British government’s Help-to-Buy program, the company
said. First-half revenue in the U.K. and Ireland fell 2.2
percent on a like-for-like basis.  SIG shares fell 3.1 percent to 182.20 pence at 8:45 a.m. in
London trading, paring their advance to 51 percent this year and
giving the company a market value of 1.08 billion pounds.  To contact the reporter on this story:
