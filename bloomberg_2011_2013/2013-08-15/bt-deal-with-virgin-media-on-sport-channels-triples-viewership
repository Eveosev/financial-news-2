Virgin Media Plc, the U.K. pay-TV
provider bought by  John Malone ’s  Liberty Global Plc (LBTYA)  this year,
will offer  BT Group Plc (BT/A) ’s new sport channels this week, more
than tripling the number of BT Sport viewers.  The three-year wholesale deal was signed in time to provide
the channels to Virgin Media TV customers before the Premier
League soccer season begins this weekend, according to a BT
statement today.  The accord “increases the audience for BT Sport to around
three million homes overnight,” BT TV Chief Executive Marc Watson said in the statement. “We are keen to make our services
as widely available as possible and to do so via wholesale
agreements.”  It’s the first such agreement BT Sport has signed for the
channels, which debuted Aug. 1. More than 1 million British
households are equipped already for the BT Sport and ESPN
channels, according to the statement. BT, the biggest fixed-line
phone operator in the U.K., offers the channels free to its
broadband subscribers, who can also stream them on the Web and
through applications for mobile phones.  The Virgin Media agreement is another strike against pay-TV
rival  British Sky Broadcasting Group Plc (BSY) , which has been
battling it out with BT over sports rights. BSkyB has fought
back, bringing on  David Beckham  to star in a new Sky Sports ad
campaign. It will also broadcast matches on the first day of the
Premier League’s soccer season free to customers who don’t
subscribe to its sports channels already.  To contact the reporter on this story:
