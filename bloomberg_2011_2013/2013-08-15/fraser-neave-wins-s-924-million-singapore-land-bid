Fraser & Neave (FNN)  Ltd., the 130-year-old property and beverage conglomerate, won a bid for a
commercial plot of land in Singapore’s central business
district.  FC Commercial Trustee Pte, a subsidiary of F&N, put in the
highest bid at S$924 million ($727 million), or S$11,974.18 per
square meter (10.76 square feet), according to a statement by
the  Urban Redevelopment Authority  on its website today. That was
19 percent higher than the next bidder, Euland Pte, which
offered to pay S$777.78 million.  Average grade A office rents in Singapore rose 4.2 percent
in the second quarter to S$9.03 per square feet per month from
the previous quarter, according to Cushman & Wakefield. The
office market has started to recover with increase in demand and
rents, Cushman said on June 26.  “Given the view that the office market is at its trough,
the top bidder can ride on the possible upswing in rents in the
next few years,” Desmond Sim, associate director at CBRE Pte,
said in an e-mailed statement.  Based on the top bid of S$923.95 million, CBRE estimates
the break-even for this site will be as much as S$1,900 per
square feet, he said.  The 7,603.2 square-meter site at Cecil and Telok Ayer
streets was tendered on 18 June 2013. The site was offered for
sale on a 99-year lease, according to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
