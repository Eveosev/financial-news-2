Hennes & Mauritz AB (HMB) ,  Europe ’s
second-biggest clothing retailer, reported an unexpected drop in
same-store sales for last month, sending the shares lower.  Revenue at stores and operations open at least a year fell
1 percent from the same month a year earlier, the Stockholm-based company said in a statement today. The average estimate in
a SME Direkt survey was for an increase of 0.8 percent. Total
sales rose 9 percent, missing the 10 percent average estimate.  “As so often happens after a good month, H&M’s sales fell
back in July,” Richard Chamberlain, an analyst at Bank of
America Merrill Lynch, said in a note. Still, this month’s entry
to the U.S. online clothing market should enable the company to
regain momentum and post positive like-for-like sales for the
third quarter as a whole, he said.  Market statistics from  Germany  and  Sweden  suggest that H&M
lost some share in July, Nordea analysts said in a note today.
Germany is the retailer’s biggest market, accounting for about
21 percent of revenue.  H&M  fell  1.5 percent to 242.20 kronor at 9:48 a.m. in
Stockholm trading, trimming this year’s gain to 8.1 percent.  The Swedish company said it had 2,940 stores at the end of
July, up from 2,603 a year earlier. H&M has said it plans to
open 350 outlets this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
