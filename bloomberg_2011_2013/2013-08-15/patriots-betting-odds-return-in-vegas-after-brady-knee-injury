Las Vegas sportbooks resumed taking
wagers on New England Patriots’ games, less than 24 hours after
taking down betting lines following a knee injury to quarterback
Tom Brady.  Brady, a two-time National Football League Most Valuable
Player who missed almost all of the 2008 season with a left knee
injury, will be back at practice today after leaving yesterday’s
workouts with a sprained left knee, ESPN reported.  A scan on the knee showed no ligament damage, ESPN said,
and Brady plans to play in a preseason game tomorrow against the
Tampa Bay Buccaneers, pending a follow-up examination, ESPN
reported, citing unidentified people close to the situation.  The Las Vegas Hotel’s Super Book was among the sports books
in  Nevada  and online that took down many betting lines on the
Patriots yesterday following Brady’s injury. Among the lines
that are back up -- with no change -- are the Patriots’
estimated season win total of 11 and the point spread for their
regular-season opening game against the Buffalo Bills, in which
New England is listed as a 7-point favorite.  Brady, a three-time Super Bowl winner, was hurt yesterday
in a joint practice with the Buccaneers when Tampa Bay defensive
end Adrian Clayborn pushed Patriots offensive tackle Nate Solder
into the side of the quarterback’s left leg as Brady was
throwing.  Brady, 36, was the reigning league MVP on Sept. 8, 2008,
when he suffered a torn anterior cruciate ligament in his left
knee during the first quarter of the Patriots’ regular-season
opener. A year after going 16-0 in the regular season, the
Patriots went 11-5 without Brady and missed the playoffs.  To contact the reporter on this story:
