Zenith Bank Plc (ZENITHBA) , Nigeria’s third-largest bank by market value, said first-half profit was little
changed after reductions in fees ordered by the central bank
offset revenue from lending.  Net income in the six months to June rose to 45.4 billion
naira ($281.6 million) from 42.4 billion naira a year earlier,
the Lagos-based lender said in an e-mailed statement today.
Revenue rose 13 percent to 171 billion naira, while loans and
advances increased 7.9 percent to 1.1 trillion naira.  “The second quarter of this year was a particularly
challenging one, especially with the commencement of the revised
bank tariffs on services and products,” Chief Executive Officer
Godwin Emefiele said in the statement.  The bank’s first-half net interest income rose 15 percent
to 91.4 billion naira, while operating expenses rose 14 percent
to 70 billion naira.  The Central Bank of Nigeria directed banks in sub-Saharan
 Africa ’s second-biggest economy to lower fees and commissions
starting April 1 to minimize conflict with clients. The Asset
Management Corp. of Nigeria, or Amcon, which is partly funded by
the nation’s lenders, also increased the assets banks are
required to contribute to set aside for failed loans to 0.5
percent this year from 0.3 percent.  Zenith Bank’s shares fell 0.5 percent to 20.9 naira at 2:30
p.m. in Lagos. The stock rose 7.2 percent this year compared
with a 19 percent increase for the Nigerian SE Banking Index,
which tracks the 10 largest banks in Africa’s biggest oil
producer.  To contact the reporter on this story:
