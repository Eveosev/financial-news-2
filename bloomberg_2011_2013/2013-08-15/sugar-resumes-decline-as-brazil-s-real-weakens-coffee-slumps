Sugar resumed its decline in New
York on speculation further weakening of  Brazil ’s real will
prompt the world’s biggest producer to boost sales. Coffee fell.  The real weakened 13 percent against the dollar since May
14, the most among 31 major currencies tracked by Bloomberg, and
touched a 4 1/2-year low of 2.3275 per dollar yesterday. The
currency is still 10 percent stronger than a measure of its
historical value, raising the prospect of further losses.  “The advance in prices was halted by continued producer
selling and also by the weakness of the real, which closed at a
new low,” Nick Penney, a senior trader at Sucden Financial Ltd
in London, said in a report e-mailed today.  Raw sugar for October delivery fell 0.3 percent to 17.20
cents a pound by 7:09 a.m. on ICE Futures U.S. in New York.
White sugar for delivery in October gained 0.1 percent to $505 a
metric ton on NYSE Liffe in  London .  The amount of sugar waiting to be loaded at ports in Brazil
rose 7.7 percent in the week ended yesterday, data from Williams
Servicos Maritimos Ltda. showed. The total at the country’s main
ports was 1.65 million tons, data from the Recife, Brazil-based
shipping agency e-mailed yesterday showed. That’s up from 1.53
million tons a week earlier.  Sugar rose in the past four weeks on speculation rain and
frost in Brazil’s center south, the main producing region, will
cut output this year. If prices reach 17.30 cents a pound, it
could trigger more buying, Penney said.  Cocoa for December delivery fell 0.1 percent to $2,493 a
ton on ICE. Cocoa for December delivery was down 0.1 percent to
1,653 pounds ($2,575) a ton on NYSE Liffe.  Arabica coffee for December delivery fell 0.4 percent to
$1.248 a pound in New York. Robusta coffee for delivery in
November declined 0.3 percent to $1,919 a ton in London.  To contact the reporters on this story:
