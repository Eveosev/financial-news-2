The  dollar  registered its biggest
weekly advance in more than a month against the yen as gains in
new-home construction and worker productivity added to signs the
world’s biggest economy is improving.  The U.S. currency climbed versus 13 of its 16 major
counterparts as growth data fueled speculation the  Federal
Reserve  will start to reduce its unprecedented monetary
stimulus. Dollar gains were limited as bond yields rose to the
highest level in more than two years and stocks fell.  India ’s
rupee slid to a record low amid concern the nation’s current-account deficit will keep widening.  “The housing data today doesn’t change any of the views
that the Federal Reserve will likely taper its asset purchases
in September,” said Charles St-Arnaud, a foreign-exchange
strategist at Nomura Holdings Inc. in New York. “We expect a
broad-based appreciation of the U.S. dollar between now and the
end of the year.”  The dollar rose 0.2 percent to 97.53 yen at 5 p.m. in New
York, with its 1.4 percent week gain the most since the period
ended July 5. The U.S. currency added 0.1 percent to $1.3329 per
euro after appreciating to $1.3206 yesterday, the strongest
level since Aug. 2. The yen was little changed at 130.00 per
euro.  The Bloomberg  U.S. Dollar  Index added 0.2 percent to
1,022.06 and climbed 0.5 percent this week.  Rupee, Real  The rupee extended its all-time low after the  Reserve Bank 
of India boosted efforts this week to stem its slide by cutting
the amount local companies can invest overseas without seeking
approval to 100 percent of their net worth, from 400 percent.
The rupee  declined  0.3 percent to 61.66 per dollar after
weakening to a record 62.005 and slumped 12 percent this year.  Brazil ’s real fell versus all 16 of its major peers as
concern the Fed will reduce stimulus overshadowed the central
bank’s plan to begin rolling over more than $5 billion in
currency swap contracts today. The currency depreciated 2.2
percent to 2.3925 per dollar after touching 2.3983, the lowest
level on a closing basis since March 2009.  The rupiah extended yesterday’s loss and touched a four-year low after  Indonesia ’s foreign-currency reserves dropped to
the least since 2010 before data today that may show the current
account deficit widened to a record. The Indonesian currency
reached 10,435, the weakest level since June 2009.  Options Trading  Trading in over-the-counter foreign-exchange options
totaled $20 billion, compared with $28 billion yesterday,
according to data reported by U.S. banks to the Depository Trust
Clearing Corp. and tracked by Bloomberg.  Volume in options on the dollar-yen  exchange rate  amounted
to $3.1 billion, the largest share of the trades at 16 percent,
trading at 47 percent less than average for the past five
Fridays at a similar time in the day. Pound-dollar, the second
most-traded exchange rate, amounted to $3.1 billion, a 15
percent share and up 134 percent on average.  Treasury  10-year yields  jumped 25 basis points this week
and reached 2.86 percent today, the highest level since July
2011. The Standard & Poor’s 500  Index (SPX)  of stocks fell 0.3 percent
today and 2.1 percent this week, the most since June.  “With bond yields higher and equities lower, it means that
people are selling these dollar-denominated assets,” said Eric Viloria, senior currency strategist for Gain Capital Group LLC
in New York. “In the longer term, tapering from the Fed and the
diverging direction of monetary policy across the major
economies is something that could be a positive for the
dollar.”  Economic Indicators  Housing starts climbed 5.9 percent to an 896,000 annualized
rate, from a revised 846,000 pace in June that was higher than
previously reported, according figures from the Commerce
Department. That compared with a median estimate of 82
economists surveyed by Bloomberg for a 900,000 rate.  The measure of employee output per hour increased at a 0.9
percent annualized rate, after a 1.7 percent decline in the
prior three months, a Labor Department report showed today in
 Washington . The median forecast in a Bloomberg survey of
economists called for a 0.6 percent advance.  Separate reports this week showed that applications for
 unemployment insurance  declined to the fewest since October
2007, and the cost of living in the U.S. rose in  July for a
third month.  ‘Very Encouraging’  Fed Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  will reduce the central bank’s
$85 billion of monthly bond purchases next month, according to
65 percent of economists surveyed by Bloomberg. The Federal Open
Market Committee’s first step may be small, with monthly
purchases tapered by $10 billion to a $75 billion pace,
according to the survey conducted Aug. 9-13.  “Even though the Fed has said tapering is not tightening,
it just feels like yesterday’s data was a little better, and CPI
earlier in the week was a little higher,” said Brian Kim, a
currency strategist at RBS Securities Inc. in  Stamford ,
 Connecticut . “So people are saying ’OK, there’s tapering.’”  The dollar has appreciated 3.9 percent this year, the best
performer behind the euro among 10 developed-nation currencies
tracked by Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes. The euro
gained 5.1 percent, while the yen tumbled 8.8 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
