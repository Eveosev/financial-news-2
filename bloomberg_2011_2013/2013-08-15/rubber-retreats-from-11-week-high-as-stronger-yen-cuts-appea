Rubber fell from an 11-week high as
the Japanese currency strengthened after a U.S. Federal Reserve
official cautioned against excessive optimism over the economy.  Rubber for delivery in January on the Tokyo Commodity
Exchange declined as much as 1.1 percent to 263.1 yen a kilogram
($2,693 a metric ton) and was at 265 yen at 11:25 a.m. Futures
settled at 265.9 yen yesterday, the highest close for a most-active contract since May 29. Rubber has lost to 13 percent this
year.  The yen climbed against the dollar for a second day after
St. Louis Fed President  James Bullard  said yesterday policy
makers should be careful in changing course based solely on
their economic forecasts. Economists predict a report today will
show gains in U.S. consumer prices slowed last month.  “The stronger yen prompted investors to sell Tocom rubber
after the recent rally,” said Gu Jiong, an analyst at commodity
broker Yutaka Shoji Co.  Rubber for delivery in January gained 0.7 percent to 19,810
 yuan  ($3,239) a ton on the Shanghai Futures Exchange. Thai
rubber free-on-board gained for a fifth day, adding 0.9 percent
to 81.25 baht ($2.60) a kilogram yesterday, according to the
Rubber Research Institute of  Thailand .  To contact the reporter on this story:
