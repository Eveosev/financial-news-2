(Corrects offering period, terms in headline, first, second
paragraphs; removes unrelated definition in fifth.)  Investec Plc (INVP)  is selling 10-year
notes backed by the debt of  Scottish Widows  Plc.  The securities, being issued through its Investec Bank Plc
unit, will pay a spread over the three-month sterling London
interbank offered rate, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
They are backed by debt from an $850 million pound offering of
5.5 percent, 10-year notes that Scottish Widows sold in April.  Izzy Ansell, a spokeswoman for Investec in London, didnâ€™t
return requests for comment.  Scottish Widows traces its origins to 1812, when a group of
Edinburgh businessmen set up a fund to provide for the wives of
British soldiers killed in the Napoleonic wars.  To contact the reporter on this story:
