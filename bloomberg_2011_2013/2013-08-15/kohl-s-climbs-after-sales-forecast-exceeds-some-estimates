Kohl’s Corp. (KSS) , the third-largest U.S.
retailer, rose the most in more than a year after it forecast
sales for this quarter that beat some analysts’ estimates.  The  shares  climbed 5.3 percent to $53.51 at the close in
 New York , their biggest increase since July 2012. They’ve gained
24 percent this year, compared to 16 percent for the Standard &
Poor’s 500 Index.  Kohl’s expects sales during the quarter that ends Nov. 2 to
increase by 1 percent to 3 percent, according to a statement
today by the  Menomonee Falls , Wisconsin-based company. The
average of 18 estimates compiled by Bloomberg had been $4.55
billion, which would be up 1.4 percent from a year earlier.  Chief Financial Officer Wes McDonald told investors on the
company’s second-quarter earnings conference call that Kohl’s
was “very pleased” with initial back-to-school sales.  The company reported profit of $1.04 a share for its second
quarter ended Aug. 3, meeting estimates. Sales at stores open at
least a year rose 0.9 percent, after larger competitor  Macy’s
Inc. (M)  yesterday posted a 0.8 percent decline.  Kohl’s also forecast annual profit of $4.15 to $4.35
percent a share, reducing the top end by 10 cents from its
previous outlook.  To contact the reporter on this story:
