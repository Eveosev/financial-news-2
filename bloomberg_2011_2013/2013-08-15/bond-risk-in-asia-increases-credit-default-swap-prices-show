The cost of insuring corporate and
sovereign bonds from non-payment in  Asia  rose, according to
credit-default swap traders.  The Markit iTraxx Japan index increased 1.5 basis points to
93.5 basis points as of 9:19 a.m. in  Tokyo , Citigroup Inc.
prices show. The benchmark is set for its first increase in
three days and its highest close since Aug. 12, according to
data provider CMA.  The Markit iTraxx Asia index of 40 investment-grade
borrowers outside Japan climbed 1 basis point to 136 as of 8:26
a.m. in  Singapore , Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc prices show.
The measure is also on track for its highest level since Aug. 12
after falling to a three-week low of 134.5 yesterday, according
to CMA, which is owned by McGraw-Hill Cos. and compiles prices
quoted by dealers in the privately negotiated market.  The Markit iTraxx Australia index was little changed at 115
basis points 10:17 a.m. in Sydney, according to Westpac Banking
Corp. prices. The benchmark, which has ranged from 96.1 to 149.5
this year, is poised to decrease 8.3 basis points from July 31,
CMA data showed.  Credit-default swap indexes are benchmarks for insuring
bonds against default and traders use them to speculate on
 credit quality . A drop signals improving perceptions of
creditworthiness, while an increase suggests the opposite.  The swap contracts pay the buyer face value in exchange for
the underlying securities if a borrower fails to meet its debt
agreements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
