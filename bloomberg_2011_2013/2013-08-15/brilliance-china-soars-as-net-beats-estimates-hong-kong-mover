Brilliance China Automotive Holdings (1114) 
surged to a record in Hong Kong trading on first-half profit
that beat estimates and higher projected vehicle sales volume
for the rest of this year.  Brilliance, the local manufacturing partner of  Bayerische
Motoren Werke AG (BMW) , climbed as much as 13 percent to HK$12, the
highest since it started trading in 1999, before changing hands
at HK$11.62 as of 11:44 a.m. local time.  BMW has said  China  will probably surpass the U.S. as its
top market this year as the brand enters more communities and
wins buyers with its 3- and 5-series sedans. The automaker,
which trails  Volkswagen AG (VOW) ’s Audi in China, has grown faster
than its competitor for at least four straight years since 2009.  “We see these results as a continuation of Brilliance’s
growth trajectory. Brilliance expects 50 more BMW dealers to
open in H2, which should support growth in future years,”
analysts at Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. led by  Max Warburton 
wrote in a note yesterday. “We see Brilliance as the Chinese
auto stock with the best guaranteed growth.”  Brilliance reported a half-year net income gain of 52
percent to 2.03 billion  yuan  ($332 million) on Aug. 13, beating
the 1.4 billion yuan median estimate of five analysts surveyed
by Bloomberg.  Brilliance announced the local production of one new BMW
model a year from 2015 to 2017 at an earnings briefing in Hong
Kong. It told analysts in a separate briefing that it expects to
sell 205,000 units this year, up from an earlier estimate of
200,000, and projects a 30 percent volume growth next year,
Bernstein said.  Today’s share-price surge extends Brilliance’s advance this
year to 22 percent, compared with a 0.1 percent decline for the
benchmark Hang Seng Index.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
