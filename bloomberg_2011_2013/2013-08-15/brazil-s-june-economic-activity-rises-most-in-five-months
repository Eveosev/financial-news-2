Brazil ’s economic activity in June
increased the most since January after falling more than first
reported the month prior, as the world’s second-largest emerging
market expands at an uneven pace.  The seasonally adjusted economic activity  index , a proxy
for gross domestic product, rose 1.13 percent percent in June
from the previous month after falling a revised 1.5 percent in
May, the central bank said today in a report posted on its
website. Analysts expected a 1.2 percent increase, according to
the median estimate of 25 economists surveyed by Bloomberg.  President  Dilma Rousseff ’s administration has cut taxes and
subsidized credit to revive Latin America’s largest economy
while trying to tamp inflation that twice breached the target
range in 2013. While tax cuts and an improvement in industrial
production helped economic activity accelerate 0.9 percent
during the second quarter compared to the previous three months,
a drop in  consumer confidence  will bring slower growth in July,
according to Flavio Serrano, senior economist at Banco Espirito
Santo de Investimento.  “It’s a positive number, but we don’t think it’s going to
last,” Serrano said by phone from  Sao Paulo . “We have numbers
that indicate a strong deceleration in July.”  Swap rates on the contract maturing in January 2015 rose 11
basis points, or 0.11 percentage point, to 10.13 percent at 9:10
a.m. local time. The real strengthened 0.13 percent to 2.3218
per  U.S. dollar .  Worst Performance  Economists surveyed by the central bank on Aug. 9 forecast
the economy would increase 2.21 percent this year after growing
0.9 percent in 2012, which was the worst performance since 2009.
They estimate inflation will reach 5.74 percent in 2013, within
the central bank’s 2.5 percent to 6.5 percent target range.  Annual  inflation  in July eased to 6.27 percent, the lowest
rate since January. The central bank board in its Aug. 27-28
meeting will decide whether to raise the benchmark  interest rate 
for the fourth consecutive time.  The non-seasonally adjusted economic activity index rose
2.35 percent from a year ago, compared with a median estimate of
a 2.7 percent gain, the central bank said today.  To contact the reporters on this story:
