Pakistan Oilfields Ltd., the
nationâ€™s third-biggest energy explorer, reported a 9.2 percent
decline in full-year profit as exploration costs tripled.  Net income was 10.8 billion rupees ($105 million), or 45.78
rupees a share, in the 12 months ended June 30, from 11.9
billion rupees, or 50.13 rupees a share, a year ago, the
Rawalpindi-based company said today in a filing. That missed the
12.8 billion rupees mean estimate of seven analysts compiled by
Bloomberg.  Exploration costs surged to more than 1.8 billion rupees,
from 593 million rupees a year ago, Pakistan Oilfields said.
Sales were little changed at 31 billion rupees.  The stock fell as much as 1.6 percent to 513 rupees in
Karachi trading and was at 518 rupees as of 10:36 a.m. local
time. The  shares  have advanced 19 percent this year, compared
with a 40 percent gain in the benchmark KSE100 index.  The company will pay a final  dividend  of 25 rupees a share.  To contact the reporter on this story:
