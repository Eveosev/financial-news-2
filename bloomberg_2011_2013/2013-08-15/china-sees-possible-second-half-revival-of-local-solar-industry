China ’s solar industry may revive
this half as consumption grows abroad and local demand takes
off, the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology said.  Production of polysilicon, used to make solar cells, fell
25 percent in the first half to 31,000 metric tons from a year
earlier, the ministry said yesterday in a  statement  on its
website. The figure accounted for 27 percent of world output.  The China Photovoltaic Industry Alliance between companies
and the state sees annual output of 80,000 tons of polysilicon
and 23 gigawatts of solar panels, according to the statement.
China will also install more than 8 gigawatts of solar power.
Some polysilicon makers will resume output after suspensions,
possibly leading to reduced imports, the ministry said.  China, with capacity to produce more than 40 gigawatts of
panels, made about 11.5 gigawatts in the first half as exports
slid 37 percent to 7.5 gigawatts. The top seven companies made
45 percent of output. They include  Yingli Green Energy Holding (YGE) 
Co. and  Trina Solar Ltd. (TSL) , figures compiled by Bloomberg show.  While sales to  Japan , the U.S. and  India  expanded in the
period, they fell to Europe, which buys about half the exports.
China agreed with the European Union last month to curb panel
shipments to the region to avoid punitive tariffs.  China’s 10 biggest photovoltaic companies have debt of more
than 100 billion  yuan  ($16.4 billion), with profit margins down
and financial institutions tightening credit, the ministry said.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
