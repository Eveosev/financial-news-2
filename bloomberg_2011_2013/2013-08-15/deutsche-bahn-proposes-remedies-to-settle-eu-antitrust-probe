Deutsche Bahn  AG,  Germany ’s state-owned railway, proposed remedies in a bid to settle a European
Union  antitrust probe  into prices a unit charges for power used
by trains.  The European Commission last year opened a formal probe
into Deutsche Bahn’s DB Energie unit, the only supplier of
traction current in Germany, and whether it offers discounts
that may inflate prices for Deutsche Bahn rivals, putting them
possibly at a “competitive disadvantage.” The Brussels-based
EU regulator is now testing the company’s proposed settlement
commitments with rivals and interested parties, according to an
EU filing today.  The EU watchdog in 2011 raided Deutsche Bahn’s offices to
check allegations that DB Energie was favoring the group’s rail-freight arm over others. EU Competition Commissioner  Joaquin Almunia  has said enforcement must give potential competitors in
industries dominated by ex-state monopolies “the opportunity to
launch their own services and compete effectively.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
