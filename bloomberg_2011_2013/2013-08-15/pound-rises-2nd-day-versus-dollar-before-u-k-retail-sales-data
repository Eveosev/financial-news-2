The pound strengthened to an eight-week high against the dollar after U.K. retail sales increased
in July more than analysts forecast, adding to evidence
Britain’s economy is gathering pace.  Sterling advanced for a fifth day against the euro, the
longest run of gains since April, as the improving data spurred
bets the Bank of England will need to raise interest rates to
restrain inflation. U.K. government bonds fell, pushing 10-year
yields to the highest since August 2011, as demand for the
safety of fixed-income assets waned. Britain’s borrowing costs
rose as the Debt Management Office sold 2.25 billion pounds
($3.5 billion) of 20-year gilts.  “It’s consistent with all the data that has come out
recently,” said Adam Cole, head of Group-of-10 foreign-exchange
strategy at Royal Bank of Canada in  London . “We are generally
bullish on sterling.”  The pound advanced 0.5 percent to $1.5574 at 4:43 p.m.
London time after rising to $1.5594, the highest level since
June 19. The U.K. currency appreciated 0.4 percent to 85.18
pence per euro after reaching 85.05 pence, the strongest since
July 3.  Sterling jumped 4.1 percent in the past six months, the
best performer of 10 developed-nation currencies tracked by
Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes. The euro gained 2.9
percent and the dollar strengthened 3.7 percent.  Positive Signs  The pound has rallied as reports showed purchasing managers
indexes of manufacturing, services and construction all improved
in July while house prices increased and economic growth
accelerated in the second quarter.  U.K.  retail sales  including fuel climbed 1.1 percent last
month from June, when they increased 0.2 percent, the Office for
National Statistics said in London. Economists surveyed by
Bloomberg predicted a gain of 0.7 percent.  Bank of England governor Mark Carney said last week policy
makers plan to keep the benchmark interest rate at a record-low
0.5 percent until the jobless rate falls to 7 percent, which
they don’t expect until at least the fourth quarter of 2016.  Seventeen of 25 forecasters in a Bloomberg survey predict
unemployment will fall to the level by mid-2016, with 13
predicting it will happen in 2015 at the latest.  Short-sterling futures contracts expiring in September 2016
fell, signaling traders are adding to bets interest rates will
rise. The implied yield increased as much as 15 basis points to
2.23 percent, the highest since June 25.  ‘Decent Improvement’  “The pound has been doing better,” said Peter Kinsella,
senior foreign-exchange strategist at Commerzbank AG in London.
“The main factors have been a decent improvement on the yield
side and positive PMI and unemployment data. The economy is
slightly better but that’s coming from a low base.”  The 10-year gilt yield climbed five basis points, or 0.05
percentage point, to 2.68 percent after reaching 2.71 percent,
the highest since Aug. 9, 2011. The 1.75 percent bond due in
September 2022 fell 0.345, or 3.45 pounds per 1,000-pound face
amount, to 92.535.  Investors boosted bets that inflation will stay above the
central bank’s 2 percent target over the next decade.  The 10-year  break-even rate , derived from the difference in
yield between gilts and index-linked bonds, climbed as much as
four basis points to 3.12 percentage points, the highest level
since July 17. The rate, which reflects the inflation level
traders expect during the life of the security, has jumped from
a 2013 low of 2.65 percentage points set in January.  The 30-year measure reached 3.58 percentage points, the
most since July 2011.  The U.K. sold gilts maturing in September 2034 at an
average yield of 3.52 percent, compared with 2.79 percent at the
previous sale of 20-year securities on June 13.  “It certainly wasn’t the strongest result,” said Sam Hill, a gilts strategist at RBC Capital Markets in London. “The
momentum behind this idea there’s an economic recovery taking
hold is putting upward pressure on yields across markets.”  Gilts lost investors 4.3 percent this year through
yesterday, Bloomberg World Bond Indexes show. German securities
dropped 2 percent and Treasuries declined 3.1 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
