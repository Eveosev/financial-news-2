Hog futures fell, snapping a three-day rally, on speculation that demand will not match increasing
U.S. supply. Cattle advanced.  Meatpackers processed 1.27 million hogs in the first three
days this week, up 5.2 percent from last week and 0.7 percent
from a year earlier, Department of Agriculture data show.
Wholesale  prices  fell 1.1 percent yesterday to $1.0314 a pound,
the lowest since Aug. 1, according to the government. Labor Day,
on Sept. 2, is the third-most popular day for barbecuing in the
U.S., according to the Hearth, Patio and Barbecue Association.  “The rising supply picture is moving the market, and the
end of this week is the end of Labor Day procurement,” Rich Nelson, the chief strategist at Allendale Inc. in McHenry,
 Illinois , said in a telephone interview.  Hog futures for October settlement slumped 0.6 percent to
87.625 cents a pound at 9:14 a.m. on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange. Yesterday, the price reached 88.375 cents, the highest
since July 9.  Cattle futures for October delivery rose 0.1 percent to
$1.2825 a pound in  Chicago .  Feeder-cattle futures for September settlement fell 0.1
percent to $1.573 a pound.  To contact the reporter on this story:
