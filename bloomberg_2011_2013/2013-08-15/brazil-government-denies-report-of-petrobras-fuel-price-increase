Brazil ’s Energy Minister Edison Lobao today denied a report the government is studying plans to
allow Petroleo Brasileiro SA to raise fuel prices to stem losses
at the state-controlled oil company.  Lobao also denied today’s report from Valor Economico
newspaper the government is considering plans to lower
requirement for Petrobras to hold a minimum 30 percent stake in
groups to explore pre-salt fields.  “There is no bigger help for Petrobras than assuring them
a stake of the wealth that will be found in the pre-salt,” the
minister told reporters in Brasilia. “There is no news
regarding a fuel increase.”  Petrobras sells imported fuel at a loss as part of a
government policy to control inflation, which has breached the
central bank’s target range twice this year. Lobao told
reporters Aug. 13 a fuel increase would hurt government efforts
to contain consumer price increases.  Petrobras shares rose 4.2 percent to 17.66 reais at 1:14
p.m. in Sao Paulo.  Valor Economico columnist Claudia Safatle reported today
the government was considering plans to allow Petrobras to
gradually increase gasoline and diesel prices, citing an
unidentified government official. The financial newspaper also
reported the government was considering plans to change the law
governing Petrobras’s 30 percent stake in pre-salt fields.  To contact the reporter on this story:
