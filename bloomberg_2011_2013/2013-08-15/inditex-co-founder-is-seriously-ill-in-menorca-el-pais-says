Rosalia Mera, co-founder of Zara
brand owner  Inditex SA (ITX) , is in a serious condition after
suffering a brain hemorrhage while on vacation in the Balearic
island of Menorca,  El Pais  reported.  Mera, who created Inditex with her former husband  Amancio Ortega , called emergency services yesterday morning after
feeling unwell and walked unaided into Mateu Orfila hospital,
the newspaper reported, citing unidentified health-care staff.
Mera’s health worsened in the hospital following a cardio-respiratory failure, El Pais said.  Mera’s current estimated net worth is $5.5 billion, making
the 69-year-old Spain’s richest woman, according to the
 Bloomberg Billionaires Index . Ortega, 77, owns a 59.3 percent
stake in Inditex and is the world’s fourth-richest person with a
net worth of $56.5 billion. Mera owns almost 7 percent of
Inditex through the family investment vehicle Rosp Corunna,
according to data from the Spanish stock-market regulator.  Jose Leyte, director of Rosp Corunna, wasn’t immediately
available when his office was contacted by phone and e-mail by
 Bloomberg News  today. Hospital spokeswoman Maria Coll declined
to comment by phone.  To contact the reporter on this story:
