A case of 2005 wine from Chateau
Pontet-Canet, a Pauillac wine estate north of  Bordeaux , sold for
996 pounds ($1,545) on the Liv-ex market in  London , its lowest
level since early March, as demand for Bordeaux wines slowed.  Yesterday’s transaction was 2 percent below the 1,020
pounds at which five deals took place between July 3 and Aug.
12, and was 15 percent down from the vintage’s peak of 1,175
pounds reached in July 2011 at the height of Chinese demand for
Bordeaux, according to data on Liv-ex’s Cellar Watch website.  The Liv-ex Fine Wine 50 Index is heading for its fifth
straight month of declines following a muted response to the
sales campaign for Bordeaux 2012 wine futures. Gains in the 10
weeks to mid-March mean it has still risen 3 percent since the
start of this year.  “The younger vintages have been hit a bit harder than the
older, more mature vintages,”  Chris Smith , investment manager
at The Wine Investment Fund in London, said by phone. Pontet-Canet 2003 last traded on Liv-ex at a 28-month low while the
2002 vintage in June touched its lowest level since 2010. The
fund, invested in Bordeaux, manages $50 million.  Pontet-Canet, a neighbor of first-growth estate Chateau
Mouton-Rothschild, has 81 hectares (200 acres) of vineyards and
traces its history back to the 18th century. It has been owned
since 1975 by the Tesseron family, according to its website.  Cabernet Sauvignon  The vines, comprising 62 percent  Cabernet Sauvignon , 32
percent Merlot, 4 percent Cabernet Franc and 2 percent Petit
Verdot, have an average age of 40 to 45 years and are planted at
a density of 9,500 per hectare.  Pontet-Canet’s 2005 vintage is the third-most expensive in
the past two decades, after its 2009 and 2010, according to
Cellar Watch data.  The 2005 wines were awarded a 96+ rating on a 100-point
system by U.S. wine critic  Robert Parker , higher than scores for
preceding vintages while overtaken by the perfect 100-point
ratings he accorded more recently to the 2009 and 2010 wines
from the estate.  To contact the reporter on this story:
