Gold climbed to the highest level in
three weeks on signs of increased physical and investment demand
as the dollar weakened. Silver gained to a two-month high, while
platinum and palladium advanced.  Spot gold rallied as much as 0.8 percent to $1,346.61 an
ounce, the highest price since July 24, and traded at $1,342.78
at 9:24 a.m. in Singapore. Today’s advance came even as a U.S.
filing showed billionaire  John Paulson  had reduced his holding
in the SPDR Gold Trust by 53 percent in the second quarter.
Bullion advanced 1.1 percent yesterday as the Bloomberg U.S.
 Dollar Index  retreated for the first time in three days.  Assets in the SPDR Gold Trust, the biggest bullion-backed
exchange-traded product, climbed yesterday to 913.23 metric tons
after gaining on Aug. 9 for the first time in two months. In
 China , the second-largest consumer, the  volume  for Shanghai’s
benchmark spot contract increased to 10,739 kilograms yesterday,
the most since Aug. 6, according to the Shanghai Gold Exchange.
Gold is heading for a second monthly advance after rising 7.4
percent in July, the best gain since January 2012.  “Gold is benefiting from a weaker dollar,” said Wang Xiaoli, chief investment strategist at CITICS Futures Co., a
unit of China’s biggest listed brokerage. “The SPDR is
beginning to show signs of life again but it’s too early to tell
if the liquidation that has hurt gold this year is over.
Physical demand, especially in  Asia , remains supportive.”  Soros Sells  While holdings in the SPDR have fallen 32 percent this year,
wiping out $33.4 billion of the fund’s value, they are on course
for their first weekly increase since December. The 13F filings
yesterday also showed that billionaire  George Soros  sold his
entire position in the SPDR in the three months to June.  Bullion for December delivery rose as much as 0.9 percent
to $1,345.90 an ounce on the Comex in  New York , the highest
level since July 24, before trading at $1,341.20. Prices are
rising for the sixth day in seven.  Gold slumped 20 percent this year as some investors lost
faith in the metal and sold it at record pace from ETPs on
speculation that the  Federal Reserve  will scale back its $85
billion in monthly bond buying as the  U.S. economy  recovers.  Silver for immediate delivery gained as much as 0.7 percent
to $22.021 an ounce, the highest since June 17, before trading
at $21.9995. The metal is up for a seventh day in the longest
winning run since January.  Spot platinum climbed as much as 0.9 percent to $1,517.85
an ounce, the highest level since June 7. The metal traded at
$1,514.90, increasing for a third day. Palladium advanced as
much as 1 percent to $747.30 an ounce, matching the highest
price on July 29.  To contact the reporter on this story:
