Mortgage rates in the U.S. were
little changed as investors wait for signals from the  Federal
Reserve  about its plans to scale back bond purchases.  The average rate for a 30-year fixed mortgage held at 4.4
percent, McLean, Virginia-based  Freddie Mac  said in a statement.
The average 15-year rate climbed to 3.44 percent from 3.43
percent.  Mortgage rates have risen from near-record lows in May amid
anticipation that the Federal Reserve may begin reducing its
bond purchases at next month’s policy meeting. The  10-year (USGG10YR) 
Treasury yield, a benchmark for  consumer debt  including home
loans, jumped two days ago to the highest level this month.  “We’re in a little bit of the summer doldrums,” said
 Keith Gumbinger , vice president of HSH.com., a Riverdale, New
Jersey-based mortgage-data firm. “We are still waiting for
clear signals that the economy is running fast enough to help
foster the Fed into a move as early as September. We’re not
getting those signals, we’re getting sort of a mix and match.”  The central bank will probably begin to slow its $85
billion in monthly bond purchases next month, according to 65
percent of economists surveyed by Bloomberg on Aug. 9-13. The
Fed may start by tapering purchases to a $75 billion pace, the
median estimate of 48 economists.  The  Mortgage Bankers Association ’s index of home-loan
applications dropped 4.7 percent in the week ended Aug. 9. The
 purchase  measure fell to its weakest reading since February,
while the  refinance  gauge dropped to the lowest since April
2011, the Washington-based trade group reported yesterday.  The 30-year fixed mortgage rate has climbed from 3.35
percent in early May. It’s below the average of about 5.3
percent for the past 10 years,  data  compiled by Bloomberg show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
