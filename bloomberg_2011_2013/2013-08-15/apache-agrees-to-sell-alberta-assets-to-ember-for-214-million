Apache Corp. (APA)  agreed to sell oil and
natural gas assets in western  Alberta  to closely held Ember
Resources Inc. for $214 million.  The sale includes 530,000 net acres and more than 2,700
wells that produced 67 million cubic feet of gas and 237 barrels
of liquids a day on average during the second quarter, Houston-based Apache said in a statement today. The transaction is
expected to close during the third quarter and has an effective
date of April 1, 2013, the company said.  Apache will use proceeds to reduce debt and buy back
shares. The transaction, which includes the Nevis and North and
South Grant Lands areas, is part of the company’s plan to sell
$4 billion in assets by year end.  “Apache is focused on growing our liquids production from
a deep inventory of crude oil and liquids-rich opportunities
that generate attractive rates of return on our extensive
remaining acreage in  Canada ’s Western Sedimentary Basin,” Chief
Operating Officer Rodney J. Eichler said in the statement.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
