Swiss stocks  fell the most in seven
week as Zurich Insurance Group AG reported profit that missed
estimates and an unexpected drop in U.S. jobless-benefit claims
fueled speculation the Federal Reserve will cut stimulus.  Zurich Insurance, Switzerland’s largest insurer, tumbled
3.6 percent for the biggest slide in four months.  Novartis AG (NOVN) 
declined 1.2 percent and  Roche Holding AG (ROG) , the world’s biggest
maker of cancer drugs, retreated 1.5 percent.  The  Swiss Market Index (SMI)  lost 1.2 percent to 7,982.43 at the
close of trading in Zurich, retreating from an 11-week high. The
benchmark gauge has still surged 17 percent this year as central
banks around the world maintained stimulus measures. The broader
Swiss Performance Index slipped 1.1 percent today as U.S.
Treasuries fell, pushing the yield on the 10-year notes to the
highest level in two years.  “Good news is bad news for markets at the moment,”  Serge Berger, a Zurich-based trader at Blue Oak Advisors LLC, said in
a telephone interview. “It’s the combination of Fed tapering
fears, the unrest in  Egypt  that is also weighing on sentiment
today, and the huge selloff in Treasuries that’s causing the big
decline we’re seeing.”  In Egypt, the deathtoll from a crackdown on the supporters
of ousted President Mohamed Mursi rose above 500 as members of
the Muslim Brotherhood called for rallies nationwide. The army-backed government declared a state of emergency yesterday
following the worst violence since Egypt’s 2011 uprising against
 Hosni Mubarak .  Volume Decline  The volume of shares changing hands in SMI companies was 12
percent lower than the average of the last 30 days, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  The SMI has dropped 5.1 percent from its peak on May 22 as
Fed Chairman Ben S. Bernanke said the U.S. central bank could
pare stimulus measures if the economy improves as forecast.  A U.S. Labor Department report showed claims for
 unemployment benefits  fell last week to the lowest level in
almost six years. Jobless claims declined to 320,000 from a
revised 335,000 a week earlier.  The U.S. consumer-price index increased 0.2 percent in
July, boosting the case for tapering of Fed bond purchases.  Zurich Insurance (ZURN)  fell 3.6 percent to 243 Swiss francs, the
largest decline since April 8, as second-quarter net income
dropped to $789 million from $1.09 billion a year ago on
natural-catastrophe losses. That missed the $823.8 million
average estimate of five analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. The
company also said the target for its general insurance business
is “challenging.”  Baloise Drops  A gauge of insurers was among the  worst performers  of the
19 industry groups in the Stoxx Europe 600 Index.  Baloise
Holding AG (BALN) , Switzerland’s third-largest insurer, slid 1.3
percent to 100.60 francs. The company reports first-half results
on Aug. 29.  Swiss Life Holding AG slipped 1.4 percent to 179.70 francs.
The country’s biggest life insurer rallied 5.3 percent yesterday
as first-half profit beat analysts’ projections.  Novartis, a Swiss drugmaker, lost 1.2 percent to 68.25
francs, snapping a four-day advance. Roche decreased 1.5 percent
to 237.40 francs, contributing the most to the SMI’s drop.  Walter Meier AG (WMN)  fell 4.1 percent to 50.85 francs even as
the maker of air conditioning systems posted first-half net
income of 30.5 million francs ($32.7 million), up from 22.2
million francs a year earlier.  “In order to grow, Walter Meier seems to continue to rely
on acquisitions,” Alexander Koller, an analyst at Zuercher
Kantonalbank AG in Zurich, wrote in a report today. “The
significant increase in the tax rate could cause profit figures
to decline in the near future.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
