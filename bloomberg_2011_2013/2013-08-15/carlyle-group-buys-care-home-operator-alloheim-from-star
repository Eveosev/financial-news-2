Carlyle Group LP (CG) , the world’s
second-largest manager of alternative assets such as private
equity, agreed to purchase German nursing-home operator Alloheim
AG from Star Capital Partners Ltd. for an undisclosed fee.  The purchase will be funded through Carlyle Europe Partners
III, a 5.3 billion-euro ($7 billion) pool raised in 2006,
Carlyle said in an emailed statement today, without disclosing
details of the transaction. Star Capital purchased Dusseldorf-based Alloheim for 125 million euros in March 2008, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  “The Alloheim management team has a long and successful
track record in the health-care-services industry and an
outstanding record of quality care and support,” Gregor Boehm,
managing director at Carlyle, said in the statement.  Star Capital, based in  London , expanded the company from 13
to 49 homes with over 6,000 beds, providing a range of services
including assisted living, ambulatory care and specialized-nursing services, according to the buyout firm’s website.  BNP Paribas SA (BNP)  and Berenberg Bank acted as financial
advisers for Carlyle, with Milbank, Tweed, Hadley & McCloy LLP
and Latham & Watkins LLP were legal advisers, according to the
statement. Carlyle had $180 billion of assets under management
across 118 funds at the end of June.  To contact the reporter on this story:
