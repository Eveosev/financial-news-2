Ethanol’s discount to gasoline
narrowed as the biofuel followed corn higher after the
government reported an increase in the number of acres farmers
weren’t able to plant.  The spread between the fuels trimmed 2.59 cents to 75.11
cents a gallon. Growers filed insurance claims on 3.411 million
acres of corn they were unable to plant due to wet weather in
May and June, up from 262,467 last year, USDA data show.  “Trading today is tied to the corn market,” said Jerrod Kitt, an analyst at Linn Group in  Chicago .  Denatured ethanol for September delivery gained 3.1 cents
to $2.237 a gallon at 11:40 a.m. New York time on the Chicago
Board of Trade. Futures have gained 2.1 percent this year.  Gasoline for September delivery rose 0.51 cent, or 0.2
percent, to $2.9881 a gallon on the New York Mercantile
Exchange. The contract covers reformulated gasoline, made to be
blended with ethanol before delivery to filling stations.  Corn for September delivery rose 11.5 cents, or 2.5
percent, to $4.7625 a bushel in Chicago. The more active
December contract gained 13 cents, or 2.9 percent, to $4.6825.  The corn crush spread, or the difference between a gallon
of ethanol and the corn needed to make it, was 50.5 cents, down
from 51.6 cents yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
