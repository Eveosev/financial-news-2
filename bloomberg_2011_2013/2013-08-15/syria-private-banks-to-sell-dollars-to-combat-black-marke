Syria ’s 15 private banks have been
allowed to sell dollars to Syrians at a rate fixed by the
central bank, another effort by the government to stabilize the
local currency, Central Bank Governor Adib Mayaleh said.  The decision is part of the government’s “positive
intervention” in the market, Mayaleh said in a telephone
interview from Damascus today. Syrians will be able to buy
dollars at 175 Syrian pounds each, cheaper than the black market
rate of 195, Mayaleh said.  “The measure aims at helping stabilize the pound,
decreasing pressure on it and fighting the black market,”
Mayaleh said.  Syrians can buy as much as $10,000 a year for non-commercial purposes from more than 200 bank branches across the
country, Mayaleh said. He said the measure will also relieve
pressure on money-exchange bureaus, which have seen long lines
of Syrians waiting to buy foreign currency.  The decision is the latest in a series of measures the
Syrian government has taken to limit the decline of its
currency. President Bashar al-Assad has recently issued a decree
banning the use of foreign currencies for payments and offenders
may face prison sentences of three years.  Syria’s economy has been crippled by an insurgency that
began in March 2011 and international sanctions that have
affected its oil and banking sectors. The pound, which traded at
47 to the dollar before the conflict, plunged as low as 345 a
dollar last month, prompting the central bank to sell foreign
currencies to support it.  To contact the reporter on this story:
