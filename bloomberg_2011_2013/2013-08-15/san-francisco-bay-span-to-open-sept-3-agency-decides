A new span of the  San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge  will open to traffic on Sept. 3, a day after
the U.S. Labor Day holiday and 11 years after work began, the
Metropolitan Transportation Commission said.  Agency officials agreed today to close the existing bridge,
which carries Interstate 80 across San Francisco Bay, beginning
at 8 p.m. Aug. 28 until 5 a.m. Sept. 3 to finish construction
work and shift traffic to the new $6.4 billion section. The
decision was made in a commission hearing in Oakland.  During the closure, traffic will be rerouted from an old
span to the new east section between Oakland and Yerba Buena
Island. The work began in 2002 on the bridge, which carries
about 280,000 vehicles a day and was damaged by an earthquake in
1989. It is six years behind schedule. The west portion, from
the island to San Francisco, required seismic retrofits and
wonâ€™t be replaced.  Last month, officials announced an estimated $20 million
repair to the 2.2-mile (3.5-kilometer) structure after 32 steel
rods failed in stress tests in March. The examination showed
that as many as 600 massive bolts that reinforce the east span
against temblors may need replacement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
