Canadian  stocks  rose to a three-week
high, as commodities producers rallied after unrest in  Egypt 
sent crude higher and gold surged amid concern the U.S. Federal
Reserve will curb stimulus measures.  Eldorado Gold Corp. (ELD)  and Iamgold Corp. soared more than 7.7
percent as gold rose to an eight-week high. Bankers Petroleum
Ltd. jumped 5.7 percent to pace gains among energy producers.
 Brookfield Asset Management Inc. (BAM/A)  declined 3.4 percent after
existing home sales in July recorded their smallest gain in five
months. Valeant Pharmaceuticals International Inc. slid 1.1
percent, giving health-care stocks the biggest drop in the
benchmark index.  The  Standard & Poor’s/TSX Composite Index (SPTSX)  rose 65.22
points, or 0.5 percent, to 12,704.52 at 4 p.m. in Toronto, the
highest since July 23. Trading volume was 31 percent higher than
the 30-day average at this time of the day.  “The tapering view has been reinforced today,” said
 Andrew Pyle , a  fund manager  with ScotiaMcLeod Inc. in
Peterborough, Ontario. He manages about C$210 million ($204
million). “Gold is picking up because of the volatility in
bonds and stocks, and then you also have what’s going on in
Egypt, which is a very significant development given the extent
of what’s happening. Any type of volatility in that region tends
to support crude prices due to supply disruptions.”  The S&P/TSX erased earlier losses of as much as 0.6
percent, initially following U.S. and global equities lower amid
concern the Fed will withdraw stimulus this fall after data
showed  U.S. jobless claims  dropped to the lowest level in almost
six years.  Gold, Oil  The central bank has said it will consider reducing its
monthly bond purchases as the economy shows signs of
improvement. The tapering concerns drove U.S. Treasury yields to
two-year highs and gave U.S. equities the worst drop since June.
Monetary support has bolstered equities around the world.  The tumble in global stocks -- only four of 24 developed
markets rose today -- boosted demand for gold as an alternative
investment. The metal traded above $1,350 for the first time
since June 20, reversing an earlier decline of as much as 1.2
percent. Oil rose for a fifth day as unrest in Egypt bolstered
concern supplies could be cut. Commodity stocks account for
nearly 39 percent of S&P/TSX.  Materials producers rallied 3.8 percent and energy
companies added 0.8 percent, as four out of 10 groups in the
benchmark index advanced.  Eldorado Gold soared 7.7 percent to C$9.50 and Iamgold
climbed 11 percent to C$6.66. Centerra Gold jumped 11 percent to
C$6.20, extending its winning streak to seven days, the longest
since May 2012.  Buffett Stake  Suncor Energy Inc. (SU)  advanced 3.5 percent to C$34.97, the
highest since January, after  Warren Buffett ’s Berkshire Hathaway
Inc. reported a stake in the energy producer.  Buffett’s firm owned 17.8 million Suncor shares on June 30,
valued at more than $500 million, Berkshire said today in a
regulatory filing.  Five energy stocks rose for every one that fell, led by a
5.7 percent surge in Bankers Petroleum to C$3.32.  Telus Corp. rallied 4.8 percent to C$32.21 and Rogers
Communications Inc. gained 5 percent to C$42.45 to pace gains
among phone stocks. The Globe and Mail reported that Verizon
Communications Inc. has delayed possible takeover bids for
smaller wireless carriers Wind Mobile and Mobilicity, without
naming sources.  Financials Rout  Financial stocks lost 0.6 percent, as data showed existing
home sales in  Canada  rose 0.2 percent last month, down from a
3.3 percent pace in June and 3.6 percent in May.  Toronto-Dominion Bank (TD) , Canada’s second-largest lender, slid 0.6 percent
to C$86.75  Brookfield Asset Management dropped 3.4 percent to C$37.01
and Canadian Apartment Properties Real Estate Investment Trust
retreated 0.6 percent to C$20.68 to pace declines among real-estate stocks.  Valeant Pharmaceuticals slid 1.1 percent to C$106.12,
extending a two-day decline after closing at a record Aug. 13.
The drop helped drag health-care stocks 1.4 percent lower as a
group.  To contact the reporter on this story:
