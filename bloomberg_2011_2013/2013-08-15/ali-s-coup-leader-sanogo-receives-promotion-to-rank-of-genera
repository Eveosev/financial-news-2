Mali ’s outgoing government promoted
an army captain who led a coup last year to the rank of general
in a move that New York-based  Human Rights Watch  called
“outrageous.”  The council of ministers made the announcement yesterday in
a statement in Bamako, the capital. The promotion of Amadou Sanogo came as Mali is preparing for a new government. While
official results from a presidential run-off haven’t been
announced, candidate Soumaila Cisse conceded defeat on Aug. 12
and congratulated former Prime Minister Ibrahim Boubacar Keita
on his victory.  “Sanogo and forces loyal to him have been implicated in
extremely serious abuses including arbitrary detention, enforced
disappearances, attacks against journalists, and torture” after
the coup,  Corinne Dufka , West Africa researcher at Human Rights
Watch, said in an e-mailed statement late yesterday.  Middle-ranking soldiers overthrew the government of
President Amadou Toumani Toure in March 2012, citing the lack of
government support in a battle against ethnic-Touareg rebels in
the north. After the Touaregs linked up with Islamist militants
in an offensive that almost split the nation, former colonial
ruler  France  started an air and ground campaign to drive them
out of the main northern cities.  “Instead of being rewarded with this promotion, Sanogo
should have been investigated for his alleged involvement in
these acts,” Dufka said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
