MMG Ltd. (1208) , the Hong Kong-listed unit
of  China ’s biggest state-owned metals trader, said first-half
profit plunged about 75 percent after prices and sales fell.  Gold sales slumped 47 percent by volume and zinc dropped 7
percent, Melbourne-based MMG said today in a statement. Prices
for copper, zinc and gold averaged 7 percent, 2 percent and 8
percent lower respectively compared with a year ago, it said.  MMG, controlled by China Minmetals Corp., follows companies
including Rio Tinto Group in reporting lower profits as slowing
economic growth in China cut demand for raw materials. MMG will
release its finalized first-half results on Aug. 28.  Profit was also affected by increased operating and
depreciation expenses as it mined more ore in the first half.
Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization
fell about 25 percent in the period, the company said.  MMG maintained its 2013 production target of 170,000 metric
tons to 185,000 tons of copper and 572,000 tons to 590,000 tons
of zinc. It operates the Century mine,  Australia ’s largest open-cut zinc mine.  The  stock  gained 3.4 percent to HK$2.12 in  Hong Kong 
trading on Aug. 13. The announcement was made today before
trading started and the stock exchange was closed yesterday due
to a typhoon.  To contact the reporter on this story:
