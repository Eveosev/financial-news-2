McGraw Hill Financial Inc. (MHFI)  and its
 Standard & Poor’s  unit lost a bid to throw out a false claims
lawsuit brought by California to recover losses to state pension
funds that relied on the company’s credit ratings.  California Superior Court Judge Curtis Karnow in San
Francisco today overruled the companies’ demurrer to the
lawsuit.  McGraw Hill and S&P had argued that California’s lawsuit
didn’t meet the requirements of a false-claims case. S&P wasn’t
the seller and didn’t present any claims for payment, and the
case was filed too late, the companies said.  “I can infer from the complaint that S&P ‘caused’ PERS and
STRS to purchase the securities,” the judge said in his order,
referring to two state pension funds. “This is good enough for
present purposes.  The California Public Employees’ Retirement System and the
California State Teachers Retirement System lost about $1
billion after the housing market collapsed in 2007 and the
securities backed by residential mortgages were downgraded to
junk status, California Attorney General  Kamala Harris  said
after her office filed the complaint on Feb. 5.  Catherine Mathis, a spokeswoman for S&P, didn’t immediately
respond to an e-mail after regular business hours seeking
comment on the ruling.  The case is the People v. McGraw-Hill Cos., CGC-13-528491,
San Francisco County Superior Court.  To contact the reporter on this story:
