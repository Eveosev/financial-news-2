Boeing Co. (BA)  today unveiled pricing
for its newest 787 Dreamliner as it boosted prices for most of
its commercial jets by 1.6 percent, a lower rate to last year’s
hike of 5.5 percent.  The newest and largest Dreamliner, the 787-10, has a list
price of $288.7 million, down from the $290 million ballpark
that Boeing provided for the jet to reporters at the  Paris Air
Show  in June. The company also lifted prices for its two other
Dreamliner models, the 787-8 and 787-9, by about 2.4 percent to
$211.8 million and $249.5 million, respectively.  The price fluctuations reflect changes in wages, goods and
services for Boeing’s commercial aircraft, its biggest source of
sales, Doug Alder, a spokesman for the Chicago-based planemaker,
said in an email.  The company also raised prices for its 737 Max models,
tying each variant’s cost to engine thrust ratings that were
finalized in April, Alder said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
