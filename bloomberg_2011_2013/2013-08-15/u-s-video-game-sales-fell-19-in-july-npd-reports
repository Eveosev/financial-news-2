U.S. retail sales of video-game
software, hardware and accessories slumped 19 percent last month
to $443 million as consumers shift to titles on mobile devices
and await next-generation consoles.  Hardware sales fell 34 percent to $99.4 million from a year
earlier,  Port Washington , New York-based NPD Group Inc. said in
an e-mail today. Software sales for current-generation consoles
declined 19 percent to $210.1 million.  The games and consoles industry is in decline as consumers
increasingly play Web-delivered titles on smartphones and
tablets, while hard-core gamers are holding out for new
entertainment systems from  Microsoft Corp. (MSFT)  and  Sony Corp. (6758)   Nintendo Co., based in Kyoto, Japan, led video-game
hardware sales with its 3DS handheld console for a third month,
the company said in an e-mail, citing NPD data. The 3DS title
“Animal Crossing: New Leaf” sold more than 150,000 copies at
retail, helping increase sales of the handheld by 14 percent
over a year ago, according to Nintendo.  Sales of Microsoft’s Xbox 360 console fell 47 percent to
107,000 units last month, enough to retain the No. 1 spot in the
market for the 31st straight month. The Redmond, Washington-based company disclosed the figures, citing NPD, in a separate
statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
