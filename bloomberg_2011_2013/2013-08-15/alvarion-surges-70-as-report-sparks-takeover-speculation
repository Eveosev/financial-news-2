Alvarion Ltd. (ALVR) , an Israeli developer
of wireless access solutions, surged 70 percent in  New York 
after daily Globes said private-equity firm Sigma Wave Ltd. may
acquire the company.  Shares of Tel Aviv-based Alvarion soared the most since
March 2000 to 38 cents at 2:47 p.m. in New York, extending a
four-day rally to 105 percent. Trading volume was five times the
average of the past 90 days. The stock climbed 78 percent in
Israel, capping the biggest advance since July 2001.  Private-equity firm Sigma may acquire Alvarion through
 SuperCom Ltd. (SPCBF) , an Israeli developer of electronic identity
solutions,  Globes  reported yesterday, without saying where it
obtained the information. Alon Fishman, an adviser at Sigma,
confirmed the company is in negotiations to acquire Alvarion.  “It’s not final yet, but we are surely interested,” he
said by phone from  Tel Aviv . “We hope the process will end
positively before the end of this month.”  Alvarion’s Vice President of Investor Relations Elana Holzman based in Tel Aviv, did not respond to e-mails or phone
calls requesting comment after regular business hours.  “It’s just the report about a possible acquisition,”
Daniel Rapoport, head of equity and derivatives at Bank Leumi
Le-Israel Ltd. said from Tel Aviv by phone. “This is why people
are buying.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
