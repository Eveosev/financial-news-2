Duke Energy Corp., the largest U.S.
utility owner, bought San Francisco’s biggest solar farm from
 Sharp Corp. (6753) ’s Recurrent Energy unit.  The San Francisco Public Utilities Commission is buying
power from the 4.5-megawatt Sunset Reservoir solar farm under a
25-year agreement, according to a statement today from
Charlotte, North Carolina-based Duke. Terms of the sale weren’t
disclosed. The plant went into operation in 2010 atop the city’s
largest reservoir.  Duke has invested more than $3 billion since 2007 in U.S.
solar farms, which generate more than a combined 100 megawatts,
according to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
