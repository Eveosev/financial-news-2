Pole vaulting world record holder
Elena Isinbaeva criticized a fellow-athlete for protesting
against a law banning gay “propaganda” that has sparked calls
for a boycott of the Winter Olympic Games next year in  Russia .  “If we will allow to promote and do all this stuff on the
streets, we are very afraid for our nation,” Isinbaeva, a
supporter of President Vladimir Putin, said speaking in English
today, state news service RIA Novosti reported. “We consider
ourselves as a traditional people when men live with women. I
hope this problem won’t affect the Sochi Games.”  Swedish athlete Emma Green Tregaro competed today in
Moscow’s Luzhniki stadium at the World Championships with her
fingernails painted in rainbow colors in a sign of protest, RIA
said.  Russian Sports Minister Vitaly Mutko said Aug. 1 that the
law will be enforced during the Sochi Games even after the
International Olympic Committee said it had received assurances
that it wouldn’t be applied against athletes or spectators.  Putin signed a law in July banning “propaganda of non-traditional sexual relations” among minors. The maximum fine
for violating the law is 1 million rubles ($30,400), applicable
to legal entities. Foreign citizens charged under the law face
as long as 15 days in jail and deportation from Russia.  To contact the reporter on this story:
