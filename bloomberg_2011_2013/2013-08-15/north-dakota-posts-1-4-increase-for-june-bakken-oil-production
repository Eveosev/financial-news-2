North Dakota ’s portion of the Bakken
shale formation, the largest unconventional oil field in the
U.S., posted a 1.4 percent increase in production in June.  Output increased to a record 756,980 barrels a day, from
746,340 in May, according to the state’s Industrial Commission.
The field produced less than 70,000 barrels a day in June 2008.  The Bakken’s rising output has fueled a U.S. oil
renaissance, propelling  national crude production  to the highest
level since 1989. The U.S. met 87 percent of its energy needs in
the first four months of 2013, which would be the highest annual
rate since 1985, according to U.S. Energy Information
Administration data.  Bakken production growth has slowed this year as a severe
winter made it more difficult for trucks to bring the water,
chemicals and sand needed for the hydraulic fracturing process
to drilling sites. Production increased by 52,820 barrels a day
over the first six months of the year, compared to 128,030 a
year earlier.  Total oil production in North Dakota in June was 821,410
barrels a day, below the 830,000 level the state had forecast,
Lynn Helms, director of the state’s Department of  Mineral
Resources , said during a conference call.  Load Restrictions  “The biggest reason was we still had load restrictions on
in the first week or two in June,” Helms said. “That cause
will go away and we’ll see a pretty significant surge in
production in July or August as a result.”  July production figures will be reported in mid-September.  The state  Pipeline Authority  said 68 percent of Bakken oil
output left by rail and 25 percent by pipeline. That’s the
lowest portion of rail shipments since January and the highest
share of pipeline transportation since December. Most of the
remainder is used by  Tesoro Corp. (TSO) ’s refinery in Mandan, North
Dakota.  Bakken’s discount to U.S. benchmark West Texas Intermediate
widened by 35 cents to $4 a barrel at 3:31 p.m.  New York  time,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
