Gold imports by  India , the world’s
largest buyer, more than doubled in the second quarter after a
slump in prices in April spurred demand for bars and coins,
according to the  World Gold Council .  Inbound shipments climbed to 338 metric tons in the three
months ended June 30 from 153 tons a year earlier, the London-based, producer-funded group said in a report today. Total
demand rose 71 percent to 310 tons, with consumption of bars and
coins increasing to 122 tons from 56.5 tons and sales of jewelry
gaining 51 percent to 188 tons, the council said.  The surge in shipments prompted the government this week to
increase a tax on imports for a third time this year to contain
a record  current-account deficit  that’s weakened the rupee to an
all-time low. Higher tariffs, and central-bank rules linking
overseas purchases to re-exports, may cut imports in the second
half to not more than 150 tons from 478 tons in 2012 and spur
smuggling, the All India Gems & Jewellery Trade Federation said.  “The strength of second-quarter gold demand again
demonstrated how Indians remain committed to gold,” P.R. Somasundaram, managing director for India at the council, said
in a statement. “However, in the current quarter, demand in
India has slowed down considerably due to the various policy
changes undertaken by the government to restrict gold imports.”  Strong Demand  Full-year demand is seen at 900 tons to 1,000 tons in 2013
as a reduction in recycled supply, festivals and a good monsoon
spur consumption, he said.  “Consumer demand is extremely strong, driven by the price
drop,” Somasundaram said. “The import-tax hike will only lead
to lesser supply in the official channel.”  Gold plummeted 14 percent in two sessions through April 15
in the worst slide since 1983, boosting demand from India to
 China  and  Australia . In the second quarter, bullion slumped 23
percent as some investors lost faith in the metal as a store of
value amid expectations that the  U.S. economy  was recovering.  Spot gold gained 0.5 percent to $1,342.80 an ounce at 5:41
a.m. in Mumbai. The metal rebounded 14 percent since reaching a
34-month low of $1,180.50 on June 28.  Gold is bought in India during festivals, for marriages as
part of the bridal trousseau and gifted in the form of jewelry
by relatives. The festival season in India runs from August to
October, followed by the wedding season from November to
December and from late March through early May.  Finance Minister Palaniappan Chidambaram plans to curtail
imports to 850 tons in the year ending March 31, compared with
845 tons in 2012-2013. Overseas purchases surged 87 percent to
383 tons in the four months through July from a year earlier,
according to the Ministry of Finance.  Consumption in India, which imports almost all the bullion
it needs, accounted for about 20 percent of global demand in
2012, according to data from the gold council.  To contact the reporters on this story:
