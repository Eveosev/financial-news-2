China’s stocks  fell, dragging the
benchmark index down the most in two weeks, as drugmakers slid
amid the start of a corruption probe and automakers declined.  Jiangsu Hengrui Medicine Co. (600276)  and Beijing SL Pharmaceutical
Co. sank more than 5 percent. Regulators will crack down on
illegal competition and bribery in drug sales and medical

maker, gained 2.4 percent after reporting first-half earnings.  The  Shanghai Composite Index (SHCOMP)  lost 0.9 percent to 2,081.88
at the close. The gauge has climbed 6.8 percent since reaching a
more than four-year low on June 27 as July data from exports to
industrial output improved. The probe will target “unfair
competition” by companies abusing a dominant market position,
Xinhua said late yesterday, citing the State Administration for
Industry and Commerce.  “The crackdown on irregularities in the medical sector has
undermined confidence among investors and they expect drug
prices to fall,” said Wu Kan, a Shanghai-based  fund manager  at
Dragon Life Insurance Co., which oversees $3.3 billion in
assets. “Investors are still cautious about whether an economic
recovery will be sustained.”  The CSI 300 Index dropped 1.2 percent to 2,321.58. The Hang

times.  SAIC, China’s largest carmaker, fell 2.9 percent to 13.50

freight rates next year and the passenger rates will follow
suit,” said Dai Ming, a  money manager  at Hengsheng Hongding
Asset Management Co. “That’s reflecting accelerating reforms of
the state-controlled railway industry.”  Rail Plan  China will announce an investment and financing plan for
the railway industry by the end of the year, China Business News
