U.S. Midwest diesel fuel
strengthened to the highest premium in a month relative to
futures after  HollyFrontier Corp. (HFC)  shut units at its Tulsa,
 Oklahoma , refinery.  The premium for  ultra-low-sulfur diesel  fuel in Group 3
swelled 0.05 cent to 2.75 cents a gallon above futures on the
New York Mercantile Exchange at 4:25 p.m., the  strongest level 
since July 17. Group 3 includes states north from Tulsa to
 Minnesota  and North Dakota.  The spread widened after filing with regulators showed
HollyFrontier’s 70,300-barrel-a-day  Tulsa East refinery  shut
units after a power failure yesterday. The company’s Tulsa West
refinery reported a malfunction on the same day, according to
the notice.  The refineries primarily process sweet crude oils and
serves the markets in the midcontinental part of the U.S. known
as Group 3, according to the company’s website.  Ultra-low-sulfur diesel  in  Chicago  gained 1.25 cents,
narrowing its discount to futures to 5.75 cents a gallon. The
3-2-1 crack spread in Chicago, a rough measure of refining
margins for gasoline and diesel fuel based on West Texas
Intermediate oil in Cushing, Oklahoma, advanced 51 cents to
$14.39 a barrel. The same spread for Group 3 dropped 8 cents to
$17.82.  To contact the reporter on this story:
