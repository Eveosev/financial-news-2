Singapore Telecommunications Ltd. (ST) ,
Southeast Asia’s biggest phone company, will buy more shares in
Bharti Telecom Ltd. to tap potential growth in India.  SingTel, as the company is known, will buy 788,538 shares,
or 3.62 percent, of Bharti Telecom for S$383.6 million ($302
million) from MacRitchie Investments Pte, SingTel said in a
statement to the  Singapore  stock exchange today.  SingTel plans to spend S$2 billion on acquisitions as
growth in wireless earnings slows in Singapore and other
countries. The company has said it is considering increasing
stakes in its associates as it taps into the growth
opportunities in faster-growing markets in Asia.  SingTel also owns stakes in phone companies including
Thailand’s  Advanced Info Service Pcl (ADVANC) , Indonesia’s PT
Telekomunikasi Selular and Globe Telecom Inc. in the
 Philippines .  SingTel’s stake in Bharti Telecom, which is linked to
 Bharti Airtel Ltd. (BHARTI) , will increase to 39.78 percent from 36.16
percent after the acquisition. The company’s effective interest
in Bharti Airtel will rise to 32.34 percent from 30.76 percent.  The deal is expected to be completed Aug. 28, according to
SingTel.  To contact the reporter on this story:
