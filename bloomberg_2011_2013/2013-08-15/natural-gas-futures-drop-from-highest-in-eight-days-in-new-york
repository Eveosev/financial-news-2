Natural gas futures slid from the
highest price in eight days in New York.  Futures for September delivery fell as much as 0.3 percent
to $3.332 per million British thermal units in electronic
trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange and were at $3.335
at 12:20 p.m. Singapore time. The contract rose 1.7 percent
yesterday to settle at $3.342, the highest since Aug. 2, on
forecasts for above-normal temperatures in the U.S. that may
boost demand from power plants.  The weather may be hotter than normal in the Northeast and
upper Midwest from Aug. 19 through Aug. 28, said MDA Weather
Services in Gaithersburg,  Maryland . The high in New York on Aug.
23 may be 92 degrees Fahrenheit (33 Celsius), 10 more than
usual, while the high in Detroit on Aug. 23 may be 88 degrees, 8
above average, according to AccuWeather Inc.  Power generation accounts for 32 percent of U.S. gas
demand, according to the Energy Information Administration, the
Energy Departmentâ€™s statistical arm.  To contact the reporter on this story:
