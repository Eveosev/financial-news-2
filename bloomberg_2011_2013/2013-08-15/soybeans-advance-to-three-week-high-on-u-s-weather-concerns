Corn gained the most in five weeks
after the  U.S. Department of Agriculture  said the number of
acres farmers were unable to plant surged, and as dry weather
threatens Midwest crops. Soybeans and wheat rose.  Growers filed insurance claims on 3.411 million acres of
corn they were unable to plant due to wet weather in May and
June, up from 262,467 last year, USDA data show. Little or no
rain has fallen in parts of Iowa and  Illinois , the biggest
growers of corn, in the past two weeks, National Weather Service
data show. Prices are down 32 percent this year on government
forecasts that output will rebound to a record after drought
reduced the harvest in 2012.  “There’s a lot of dryness in the Corn Belt with no rain in
the forecast,” Jamey Kohake, a broker and branch manager at
Paragon Investments in  Silver Lake ,  Kansas , said in a telephone
interview. The number of acres that were abandoned “was in the
ballpark of the range we were putting out,” he said.
“Everybody knew it was going to be a big jump.”  Corn futures for December delivery climbed 3.7 percent to
settle at $4.7225 a bushel at 1:15 p.m. on the Chicago Board of
Trade, the biggest increase since July 9.  Soybean futures for delivery in November gained 2.1 percent
to $12.655 a bushel in Chicago, after reaching $12.69, the
highest since July 24.  About 1.619 million acres of land originally slated for
soybeans were left unplanted, according to the USDA. That
compares with 159,579 in 2012, government data show.  Wheat futures for December delivery rose 1.1 percent to
$6.495 a bushel on the CBOT, the third advance in four days and
the biggest this month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
