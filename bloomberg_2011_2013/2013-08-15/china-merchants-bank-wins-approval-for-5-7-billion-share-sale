China Merchants Bank Co. (3968) , the
nation’s sixth-largest lender by assets, won approval for the
Hong Kong portion of a share sale, clearing the way for what may
be the world’s second-largest stock offering this year.  The bank was given permission by the China Securities
Regulatory Commission to sell about 680 million Hong Kong-listed
shares to existing shareholders, the Shenzhen-based lender said
in a statement yesterday. The regulator granted Merchants Bank
approval on July 23 to sell 3.07 billion yuan-denominated shares
in  Shanghai .  The lender said July 22 it planned to raise as much as 35
billion yuan ($5.7 billion) in proceeds. Merchants Bank, which
postponed a sale twice because of approval delays, needs to
strengthen its capital buffer after regulators tightened
requirements and policy makers cracked down on banks’ use of
short-term financing.  Merchants Bank’s capital-adequacy ratio stood at 11.41
percent as of March 31 under new capital requirements that took
effect at the beginning of this year, with a core Tier-1 ratio
of 8.6 percent. While both measurements are higher than the
minimum regulatory requirement, they are the second-lowest among
nine Hong Kong-listed Chinese lenders.  The sale would improve the bank’s Tier-1 ratio to 9.85
percent, Richard Xu, an analyst at Morgan Stanley, wrote in a
report last month. He estimated the Shanghai shares will be
priced at 9.4  yuan  apiece.  Merchant Bank’s shares in Shanghai lost 1 percent to close
at 11.04 yuan yesterday, taking its slump this year to 20
percent. In Hong Kong, the stock rose 1 percent to HK$14.38,
narrowing its 2013 loss to 16 percent.  Should Merchants Bank’s share sale raise the maximum
amount, the offering would be the second largest this year after
a 747 billion yen ($7.6 billion) sale of  Japan Tobacco Inc. (2914) 
shares by the Japanese government in March.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
