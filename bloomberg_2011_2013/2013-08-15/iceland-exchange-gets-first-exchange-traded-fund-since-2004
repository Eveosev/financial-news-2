The Nasdaq OMX Iceland bourse will
offer its first exchange traded fund since 2004 as the nation
emerges from its 2008 financial collapse.  The Landsbref Equity fund will be issued by asset-manager
Landsbref hf and be based on an index of the six most-traded
companies, the Reykjavik-based exchange said in a statement.  “In our rebuilding of the Icelandic market we have
experienced a great increase in equity trading,” Magnus
Hardarson, vice president at Nasdaq OMX, said in the statement.
“This new issuance of an ETF will certainly support the growth
potential of the equity market.”  The Iceland All-Share index, which has 13 members, has
risen 14.8 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
