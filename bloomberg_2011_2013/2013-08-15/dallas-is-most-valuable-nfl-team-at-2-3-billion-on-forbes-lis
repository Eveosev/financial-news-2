The  Dallas Cowboys  topped Forbes
magazine’s list of National Football League teams for the
seventh straight year with a value of $2.3 billion, a 10 percent
rise from 2012.  The  New England Patriots  were second at $1.8 billion,
followed by the  Washington Redskins , who were valued at $1.7
billion. The  New York  Giants at $1.6 billion and the Houston
Texans at $1.5 billion rounded out the top five, with the  New
York Jets  next at $1.4 billion.  The 32 teams are worth an average of $1.17 billion, making
the NFL the most lucrative sports league in the world, the
magazine said. The world’s top 20 soccer teams have an average
value of $968 million, followed by  Major League Baseball ’s 30
teams at $744 million. The  National Basketball Association ’s 30
teams are next at an average value of $509 million, with the
 National Hockey League  at $282 million per team.  The average value of an NFL team increased 5 percent during
the period, fueled by a 3.6 percent rise to $286 million from
$276 million in 2011 in league revenue per team.  The Super Bowl champion  Baltimore Ravens  ranked ninth on
the Forbes NFL list at $1.2 billion, while the four least-valuable teams were the  St. Louis Rams , $875 million;  Buffalo
Bills , $870 million;  Jacksonville Jaguars , $840 million, and
 Oakland Raiders , $825 million.  Profitability increased to an average of $44 million in
2012, 7 percent more than the previous year, Forbes said. The
 Detroit Lions  were the only team to post an operating loss, $3.5
million, the fourth consecutive season they lost money. The
league had an operating margin of 15.4 percent.  The NFL franchises are worth more than teams in other
sports because of television deals, state-of-the-art stadiums
and hard salary caps for players, the magazine said. Additional
future revenue will come from technology-driven sources and
fantasy football, Forbes said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
