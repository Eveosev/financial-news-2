The U.S. and U.K. ambassadors to
Yemen have returned after their missions were evacuated
following the interception of communications about a planned al-Qaeda attack, Yemen’s Foreign Minister Abu Bakr al-Kurbi said.  Both embassies should open next week, al-Kurbi said today
in a telephone interview from Sana’a. The U.S. and the U.K. said
Aug. 6 they had withdrawn their personnel from Yemen and asked
citizens to leave the country because of fears of an al-Qaeda
attack.  Al-Kurbi said leaving and closing the embassies sends “the
wrong signal to the terrorists” and any such future threats
should be dealt with “in a manner that doesn’t disrupt
relations or the normal functioning of diplomatic missions.”  “The threat of al-Qaeda can never be excluded in Yemen or
in any other part of the world,” he said.  The U.S. closed its Yemen embassy along with 21 other
missions from West Africa to  South Asia  after intercepting a
message from  Ayman al-Zawahiri , Osama bin Laden’s successor as
al-Qaeda chief in  Pakistan , to the head of al-Qaeda’s Yemen
branch, Nasir al-Wuhayshi.  Last September, Yemeni protesters in Sana’a breached the
U.S. Embassy compound’s security perimeter and set two cars on
fire. The attack followed the killing of the U.S. ambassador to
 Libya , Chris Stevens, and three colleagues during an assault on
consular buildings in the eastern Libyan city of Benghazi on
Sept. 11.  To contact the reporter on this story:
