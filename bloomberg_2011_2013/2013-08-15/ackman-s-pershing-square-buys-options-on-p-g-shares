Bill Ackman ’s Pershing Square
Capital Management LP purchased options giving it the right to
buy 25 million shares of  Procter & Gamble Co ., while reducing
its holdings of the actual stock by 68 percent.  Pershing Square slashed the number of shares held in  P&G (PG)  by
19 million, to 8.94 million in the quarter ending in June,
according to a filing yesterday. Including the call options, the
company has exposure to about 33.9 million P&G shares, compared
with 28.9 million in the previous quarter.  Ackman bought a $1.8 billion stake in P&G about a year ago
and pushed for the replacement of Chief Executive Officer Bob
McDonald, who stepped down in May. Investors sometimes use
options as a way of tying up less cash to hold a stake, since
they can be purchased for a fraction of the price of a common
share.  P&G, based in Cincinnati, fell 0.9 percent to $80.48 at the
close in  New York . The shares have gained 19 percent this year.  To contact the reporters on this story:
