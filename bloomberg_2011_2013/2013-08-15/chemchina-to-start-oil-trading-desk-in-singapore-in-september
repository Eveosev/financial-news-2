China National Chemical Corp., the
country’s largest chemical producer, will open a Singapore
office next month initially to trade crude and fuel oil, said an
official.  The company known as ChemChina plans to have about 10
employees in the office, said the official, who asked not to be
named because the information isn’t public. It has hired three
traders from state-owned China ZhenHua Oil Co.  Zhou Chuanrong, the Beijing-based spokesman for ChemChina,
didn’t reply to two calls to his office.  ChemChina started importing crude earlier this year to
supply its smaller refineries under the country’s first
allowance for processing imported crude at so-called teapot
plants. ChemChina’s annual oil-processing capacity is about 25
million metric tons a year, or about 500,000 barrels a day,
according to the company’s  website .  To contact the reporter on this story:
