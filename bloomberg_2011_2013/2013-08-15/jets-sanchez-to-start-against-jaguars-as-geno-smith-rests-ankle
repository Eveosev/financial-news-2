Mark Sanchez  will start at
quarterback for the New York Jets in their preseason home opener
against the Jacksonville Jaguars in two days.  Sanchez, who was briefly benched late in the 2012 National
Football League season, also started the Jets’ first preseason
game on Aug. 9. Rookie quarterback Geno Smith injured his right
ankle in that game and isn’t practicing, a day after coach  Rex Ryan  said Smith had a “brutal” practice and didn’t look
comfortable while throwing four interceptions.  The Jets have their final training camp practice today in
Cortland, New York, before returning to their facility in East
Rutherford, New Jersey. The Jets host the Jaguars at MetLife
Stadium on Aug. 17.  Sanchez has a 14-17 record and committed a total of 52
turnovers the past two years after helping  New York  reach the
American Football Conference championship game in each of his
first two NFL seasons.  To contact the reporter on this story:
