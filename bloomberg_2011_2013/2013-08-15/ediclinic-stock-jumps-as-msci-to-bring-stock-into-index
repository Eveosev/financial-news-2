Mediclinic International Ltd. (MDC)  jumped
to the highest in at least 23 years following an announcement
that South Africa’s largest private-hospital owner by market
value will be included in the MSCI Emerging Market Index.  Mediclinic climbed as much as 8.6 percent to 76 rand and
traded at 72.38 rand as of 11:50 a.m. in Johannesburg, the
highest since at least August 1990, based on closing prices.
More than 3.6 million shares traded, almost four times the
three-month daily average. Mediclinic will join the 819-stock
index starting Sept. 2, MSCI Inc.  said  late yesterday.  Investors “will have to reshuffle their portfolio and
index trackers,” Henre Herselman, a derivatives trader at
Nedbank Private Wealth in Johannesburg, said today.  Mediclinic, which is based in Stellenbosch, said on May 22
that sales in the 12 months through March rose 12 percent
because of increases in patient numbers and rising average
income per stay. The company’s stock also reached the highest
since 1990 in December after being included in the  FTSE/JSE
Top40 Index (TOP40)  of companies with the highest capitalization in
 South Africa .  To contact the reporter on this story:
