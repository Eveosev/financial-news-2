Swire Properties Ltd. (1972) , the biggest
commercial landlord in Hong Kong’s Island East district, said
first-half underlying profit rose 16 percent after booking more
sales from a luxury apartment project in the city.  Earnings excluding revaluation gains and deferred taxes
rose to HK$2.81 billion ($362 million) in the six months ended
June 30 from HK$2.44 billion a year earlier, the company said in
a statement to Hong Kong’s stock exchange. That compares with a
HK$2.95 billion median estimates of five  analysts  surveyed by
 Bloomberg News .  The sale of apartments at the luxury Azura project helped
boost Swire Properties’ profit as Hong Kong maintains its place
as the world’s most expensive city to buy a home on record-low
 interest rates  and a shortage of new supply. Earnings were also
supported by rising demand for office space in Island East as
companies relocate away from the city’s Central business
district to reduce occupancy costs.  “At Island East, rents are expected to remain robust due
to high occupancy,” Swire Properties Chairman Christopher Pratt
said in today’s statement. Demand for the group’s shopping malls
will also stay strong “albeit at a moderate pace than
hitherto,” he added.  Shares of Swire Properties have declined 7.9 percent this
year, compared with the 0.4 percent drop in the benchmark  Hang
Seng Index . The stock gained 2.2 percent to HK$23.80 at the noon
trading break today, before earnings were announced.  To contact the reporter on this story:
