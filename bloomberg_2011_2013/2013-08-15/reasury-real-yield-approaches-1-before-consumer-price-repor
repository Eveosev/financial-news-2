Treasuries fell, pushing yields on
10- and 30-year securities to the highest since August 2011, on
speculation stronger U.S. growth will prompt the  Federal Reserve 
to reduce its bond buying program as soon as next month.   Yields (USGG10YR)  on 10-year notes, a benchmark for corporate and
consumer borrowing rates, climbed above 2.8 percent for the
first time in two years as reports showed U.S. initial jobless
claims declined last week to the lowest level in almost six
years and confidence among U.S. homebuilders rose in August to
the highest level since 2005. Treasury data showed private
investors abroad sold a  record amount  of notes and bonds in
June, when Fed policy makers indicated they are considering a
slowing of their quantitative-easing policy.  “Expectations are that the Fed will be withdrawing its
stimulus and that’s definitely a negative for rates,” said
Thomas Simons, a government-debt economist in  New York  at
Jefferies LLC, one of 21 primary dealers that trade with the
Fed. “Jobless claims were taken with the most weight. Clearly
it’s a good sign for the labor market when you have an indicator
of layoffs at its pre-recession level.”  Ten-year  notes  yields climbed five basis points, or 0.05
percentage point, to 2.77 percent at 5 p.m. New York time. The
yield reached 2.82 percent, the most since Aug. 1, 2011. The
benchmark 2.5 percent note due in August 2023 fell 14/32, or
$4.38 per $1,000 face amount, to 97 21/32.  The rate on the 3.625 percent bond maturing in August 2043
climbed as high as  3.84 percent , the most since Aug. 8, 2011,
when the  bond market  was rallying after  Standard & Poor’s  cut
the U.S. credit rating from AAA for the first time.  Markets Slump  Sixty-five percent of economists in a Bloomberg survey
conducted Aug. 9-13 said the Fed will trim its monthly bond
purchases at the next scheduled meeting Sept. 17-18. In a survey
last month, half of respondents predicted a September reduction.  Stocks tumbled and the  dollar  slumped as concern an easing
of stimulus will reduce demand for assets denominated in the
U.S. currency. The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index slipped 1.4
percent, the most since June. The dollar dropped 0.7 percent to
$1.3347 per euro.  “There is a strong sense that the Fed wants to step back -
- that the Fed no longer wants to increase the wedge between
weak fundamentals and very high asset values,” Mohamed El-Erian, co-chief investment officer at Pacific Investment
Management Co., said in a radio interview on “Bloomberg
Surveillance” with  Tom Keene . “Combine the fact that people
are starting to question this disconnect and the fact that the
Fed put is no longer perceived as strong as it was before, then
you get the across the board sell-off. You are not seeing a
flight to quality.”  Employment Growth  The number of applications for unemployment insurance
payments declined by 15,000 to 320,000 in the week ended Aug.
10, the fewest since October 2007, from a revised 335,000, a
Labor Department report showed. The median forecast of 44
economists surveyed by Bloomberg called for 335,000. There was
nothing unusual in the data and no states were estimated, a
Labor Department spokesman said.  “Things are starting to change for the positive in the
economy,” said  Charles Comiskey , head of Treasury trading in
New York at  Bank of Nova Scotia (BNS) , a primary dealer. “The
question for the market is not whether they are going to taper,
but by how much.”  Fed Forecasts  The U.S. added 162,000 jobs in July, while the  unemployment 
rate fell to 7.4 percent, from 7.6 percent, the Labor Department
reported Aug. 2. The Fed has been purchasing government debt
since 2008 to strengthen the economy and has set a long-term
unemployment forecast of 5.2 percent to 6 percent.  When Fed officials last released their economic forecasts
in June, estimates for the jobless rate centered at 7.2 percent
to 7.3 percent for this year, 6.5 percent to 6.8 percent for
2014, and 5.8 percent to 6.2 percent for the average of the
final three months in 2015. The central bank has left the Fed
funds rate at the zero to 0.25 percent level since December
2008.  The  Federal Open Market Committee  said on July 31 at the
conclusion of a two-day meeting in  Washington  its fed funds
target “will be appropriate at least as long as the
 unemployment rate  remains above 6.5 percent, inflation between
one and two years ahead is projected to be no more than a half-percentage point above the Committee’s 2 percent longer-run
goal, and longer-term inflation expectations continue to be well
anchored.”  Market Re-pricing  The yield on the 10-year note has risen from a record low
of 1.379 percent in July 2012. It touched a 2013 low of 1.6
percent on May 1 and has climbed amid improving economic data
and speculation of Fed reducing its purchases.  “The market is continuing to re-price to the data and
keeping a close eye on where the Fed will go,” said Aaron Kohli, an interest-rate strategist at BNP Paribas SA in New
York, a primary dealer. “The data is following the script the
Fed had laid out.”  The cost of living in the U.S. rose in July for a third
month, supporting the Fed’s forecast that inflation will move
closer to its target. The consumer-price index increased 0.2
percent after a 0.5 percent gain in June, Labor Department
figures showed. The advance matched the median forecast of 82
economists surveyed by Bloomberg.  Foreign Selling  The National Association of Home Builders/Wells Fargo index
of  builder confidence  climbed to 59 from a revised 56 in July,
which was lower than previously reported, the Washington-based
group reported today. The median forecast in a Bloomberg survey
of economists called for the gauge to be 57. Readings above 50
mean more builders view conditions as good than poor.  Treasuries have fallen 3.1 percent this year, according to
Bloomberg World Bond Indexes. German securities dropped 2
percent and gilts declined 4.3 percent.  Foreign selling of U.S. long-term portfolio assets rose for
a second straight month in June as private investors abroad sold
a record amount of Treasury notes and bonds, a government report
showed.  The net long-term portfolio investment  outflow  for the
month was $66.9 billion after a decline of $27 billion the prior
month, the Treasury data showed. Net selling of long-term
Treasuries by private foreign investors increased to $40.1
billion from $29 billion the prior month.  The U.S. announced today it will sell $16 billion in five-year inflation-indexed securities on Aug. 22. The last sale of
the securities in April was for $18 billion.  The Fed today purchased $3.767 billion in securities
maturing from August 2019 to July 2020. The Fed’s holdings of
Treasuries on its balance sheet rose $11.4 billion in the period
from Aug. 8-14, bringing the total to $1.998 trillion, the
central bank said today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
