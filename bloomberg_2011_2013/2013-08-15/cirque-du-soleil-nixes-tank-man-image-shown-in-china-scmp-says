Cirque du Soleil removed the iconic
“Tank Man” image of the 1989  Tiananmen Square  protests from
its show after the photo flashed on screen during a performance
in Beijing, the  South China Morning Post  reported today.  The Associated Press image of an unidentified man standing
in front of a line of tanks appeared for four seconds during the
Aug. 9 performance, drawing a gasp from the crowd, the SCMP
reported, citing a now-deleted blog post on the web site of
“That’s Beijing” magazine.  Cirque du Soleil is scheduled to perform four times in
 Shanghai  starting today before going to Hong Kong on Monday as
part of its Michael Jackson-themed tour, the newspaper said.  “The image was removed immediately and is no longer
shown,” tour publicist Laura Silverman said, according to the
SCMP. The newspaper said Cirque du Soleil submitted full details
of the show to Chinese censors for approval beforehand.  Silverman declined to say if the image would be shown
during performances in  Hong Kong , according to the newspaper.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
