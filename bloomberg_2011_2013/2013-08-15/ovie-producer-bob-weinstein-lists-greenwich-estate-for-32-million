From “Project Runway” to “Lord of the Rings” and “My Week With Marilyn,” there are few productions Bob Weinstein is not involved in. He and his brother, Harvey Weinstein, founded Miramax Films, and their combined projects have raked in millions upon millions of dollars, not to mention awards. So it’s no surprise that one of Bob Weinstein’s homes is a $32 million waterfront estate in Greenwich, CT that just hit the market. Listed at an  undisclosed address  by  Coldwell Banker real estate agent Tamar Lurie , the home sprawls across 3.28 acres with 440 feet of shoreline. If Weinstein gets his $32 million ask, he stands to make quite a profit.  Curbed  reported that he and his wife, Annie Weinstein, bought the home for $16 million in 2000, and the listing states that the couple completed a full “top to bottom museum” renovation. The two are in the midst of a divorce,  as recently reported by the New York Post , which could explain the home’s presence on the market. Measuring 12,788 square feet, the estate was built in the early 1900s by an “American industrialist” and captures views of the water from enormous windows lining the rear of the home. A stone terrace leads to a sloping, manicured lawn and private sandy beach with dock. A known playground for the wealthy, Greenwich home prices are generally in the upper millions, with the  median home value at $1.107 million . The most expensive U.S. home on the market is in Greenwich,  listed at a whopping $190 million .
