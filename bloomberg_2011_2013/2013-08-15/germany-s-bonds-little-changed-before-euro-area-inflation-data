Italy’s bonds led losses in European
government securities as a drop in U.S. jobless claims and an
increase in the cost of living boosted bets the Federal Reserve
will cut stimulus, damping demand for fixed-income assets.  Italian  10-year yields  jumped to the highest in almost two
weeks as securities issued by  Germany ,  France , Belgium and
Austria all declined. German  benchmark yields  climbed to the
highest level in 16 months amid signs the euro-area recovery is
gaining momentum.  Portuguese (GSPT10YR)  bonds advanced for a fourth day
after a report yesterday showed the economy expanded for the
first time since 2010.  “There’s a broad-based selloff of fixed-income,” said
 Peter Schaffrik , head of European interest-rates strategy at
Royal Bank of Canada in London. “The data set we’ve seen has
been strong. The story is people betting on higher rates.”  Italy’s 10-year yield rose seven basis points, or 0.07
percentage point, to 4.25 percent at 4:27 p.m. London time after
climbing to 4.29 percent, the highest since Aug. 5. The 4.5
percent bond due in May 2023 fell 0.515, or 5.15 euros per
1,000-euro ($1,326) face amount, to 102.31.  Similar-maturity Austrian yields added six basis points to
2.26 percent, while France’s rose seven basis points to 2.41
percent and those in the Netherlands increased seven basis
points to 2.25 percent.  Growth Signs  U.S. jobless claims fell to 320,000 last week, the fewest
since October 2007, the Labor Department said. The cost of
living increased for a third month, with the consumer-price
index increasing 0.2 percent after a 0.5 percent gain in June, a
separate report showed.  Gross domestic product  in the euro region rose 0.3 percent
in the second quarter after shrinking 0.3 percent in the
previous three months, the European Union statistic’s office
said yesterday.  Germany’s 10-year yield climbed six basis points to 1.88
percent after reaching 1.91 percent, the highest level since
March 2012.  “There’s an acknowledgment that the economy is turning
around,” said  Michael Leister , a senior fixed-income strategist
at Commerzbank AG in London. “The markets are thin and that’s
exaggerating the move. We think pressure will stay on bunds,
however there may be some buyers above 1.80 percent and the jury
remains out as to whether the positive-growth run we’ve seen can
extend.”  Most Volatile  Volatility on Austrian bonds was the highest in euro-area
markets today followed by those of Germany and the Netherlands,
according to measures of 10-year debt, the yield spread between
two- and 10-year securities, and credit-default swaps.  Portuguese 10-year yields declined eight basis points to
6.42 percent after falling to 6.37 percent, the lowest level
since Aug. 2. They surged to a record 18.29 percent in January
2012 as the region’s debt crisis escalated.  The nation’s GDP rose 1.1 percent from the first quarter,
when it fell 0.4 percent, the Lisbon-based National Statistics
Institute said yesterday. That followed 10 consecutive quarters
of contraction.  German bonds lost investors 2 percent this year through
yesterday, according to Bloomberg World Bond Indexes. Italy’s
securities returned 4.6 percent and Spain’s earned 8 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
