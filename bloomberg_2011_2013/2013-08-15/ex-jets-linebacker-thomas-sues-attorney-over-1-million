A company owned by former  New York 
Jets linebacker Bryan Thomas sued an Alabama attorney and
several of his businesses, claiming he was defrauded of a
$1 million investment in a waste-to-energy company.  Thomas is the principal and managing member of Thomas
Global Group LLC, which sued Donald V. Watkins, a Birmingham
attorney who owns Watkins Pencor LLC, according to a complaint
in federal court in Newark, New Jersey.  Thomas, a Birmingham native, invested $1 million in Watkins
Pencor in March 2009 after Watkins gave him “highly optimistic
representations regarding the profit potential and low risk of
the investment opportunity,” according to the complaint filed
Aug. 13.  Watkins represented that former Secretary of State
Condoleezza Rice had joined the board of a Watkins Pencor
affiliate and Martin Luther King III was politically promoting
Watkins’s business interests. Four years later, Thomas “has not
received back one dollar” and “has not been provided with any
information or detail of any kind,” according to the complaint.  Watkins didn’t immediately return a call yesterday seeking
comment on the lawsuit.  The Jets released Thomas, 34, last year after he had played
with the football team since 2002.  The case is Thomas Global Group LLC v. Watkins, 13-cv-04864, U.S. District Court, District of New Jersey ( Newark ).  To contact the reporter on this story:
