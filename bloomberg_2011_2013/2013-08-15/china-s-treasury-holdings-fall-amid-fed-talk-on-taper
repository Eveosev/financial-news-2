Holdings of Treasuries in  China , the
largest foreign lender to the U.S., fell in June for the first
time in five months amid discussion by Federal Reserve officials
about slowing the pace their bond purchases.  China’s stake dropped by $21.5 billion in June, or 1.7
percent, to $1.276 trillion, according to Treasury Department
data released yesterday. Yields climbed after June 19 when Fed
Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said policy makers might reduce the
size of their $85 billion a month in purchases of Treasuries and
mortgage securities in coming months.  The pullback by China comes as  overseas holdings  of
Treasuries have grown $26.8 billion, or 0.5 percent this year,
the slowest pace since a 2.8 percent decline in the first six
months of 2006. Treasuries have lost 3.1 percent this year,
according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch indexes, headed for
the worst performance since 2009.  “What you saw was a knee-jerk reaction” from China, said
 Adrian Miller , director of fixed-income strategies at GMP
Securities LLC in  New York . The drop wasn’t “any kind of a
message as to a concerted effort to wind down excess exposure
because of some duration risk given the Fed’s tapering goals,”
he said.  Treasury Selloff  China’s holdings in May were $1.297 trillion, less than the
$1.316 trillion reported by the Treasury last month. The
Treasury revises the data on a monthly basis based on the
nationality of the beneficial holder of the debt, while the
initial figure is derived from the location of the purchase.  The benchmark 10-year  Treasury yield  rose 36 basis points
or 0.36 percentage point, to 2.49 percent in June. It touched
2.82 percent yesterday, the highest since Aug. 1, 2011.  The decline in China’s stake “does help explain why the
Treasury market sold off in June,” said Michael Pond, head of
global inflation-linked research at Barclays Plc, one of 21
primary dealers that trade with the Fed.  Currency reserves have risen 5.6 percent through June to
$3.5 trillion, according to data from the People’s Bank of
China. Reserve growth in 2012 was 4.1 percent, the slowest pace
since 1998, the data show. Reserves had grown at a double-digit
pace for 11 consecutive years.  China’s Treasury position has risen $55.4 billion or 4.5
percent so far this year after a 5.9 percent increase in 2012.
The holdings declined 0.7 percent to $1.152 trillion in 2011,
the first annual decline on record going back to 2001.  Investors in China held 11.1 percent of the $11.4 trillion
of marketable  U.S. debt  in June compared with a record 14
percent in June 2009.  All foreign investors owned 49.1 percent of the marketable
debt, the least since May 2011, the data, known as Treasury
International Capital, show.  Demand for the debt from overseas investors fell by $56.5
billion, or 1 percent in June to $5.6 trillion. It was the first
three-month decline in overseas holdings since 2001.  To contact the reporter on this story:
