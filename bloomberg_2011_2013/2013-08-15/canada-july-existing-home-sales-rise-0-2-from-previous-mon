Canadian existing home sales
recorded their smallest gain in five months in July as real
estate markets in  Montreal  and Ottawa weakened.  Unit home sales rose 0.2 percent during the month, the
 Canadian Real Estate Association  said in a statement today, down
from a 3.3 percent pace in June and 3.6 percent in May.  “The numbers for July suggest that national activity is
leveling off at what might best be described as average
levels,” Gregory Klump, the group’s chief economist, said in
the  statement .  Canada ’s housing market has defied expectations of a hard
landing after some analysts and policy makers warned of a bubble
in some areas. Today’s data show the country’s two largest real
estate markets -- Toronto and  Vancouver  -- remain buoyant,
recording gains of 4 percent and 11 percent, respectively.  From a year earlier, sales in Canada rose 9.4 percent, the
realtor association said. Average sales prices increased 1.9
percent from June and 8.4 percent from a year earlier.  There are some signs of weakness. The value of  building
permits  issued by municipalities fell 10.3 percent to C$6.65
billion ($6.43 billion), the lowest since March,  Statistics
Canada  said in an Aug. 7 report.  Unit sales fell 2.4 percent in Montreal and 4.2 percent in
Ottawa, CREA said today. Both markets recorded declines from a
year earlier.  To contact the reporter on this story:
