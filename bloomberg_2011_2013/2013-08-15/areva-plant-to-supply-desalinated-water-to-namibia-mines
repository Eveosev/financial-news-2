Areva SA (AREVA) , the biggest producer of
nuclear reactors, signed an agreement with Namibia Water Corp.
for the utility to distribute water from the company’s
desalination plant to mines in the central Erongo region.  The pact to supply 10 million cubic meters (2.6 billion
gallons) of water a year was signed yesterday, Hilifa Mbako,
managing director of Paris-based Areva’s Namibian unit, said by
e-mail. The water will be distributed to  Paladin Energy Ltd. (PDN) ’s
Langer Heinrich uranium mine, China Guangdong Nuclear Power
Co.’s Husab uranium project and  Rio Tinto Plc (RIO) ’s Rossing mine.  Erongo is in a semi-arid area that suffers from severe
water shortages. The southwest African nation is enduring its
worst drought in three decades with all 13 regions affected by
water scarcity and a third of the people severely or moderately
food insecure, the  United Nations  said Aug. 12 on its  website .
The government declared an emergency in May, it said.  The water from the Areva desalination plant has become
available it’s linked with the Trekkopje uranium project, which
Areva halted last year after prices of the nuclear fuel slumped.
The company has spent $970 million on the mine and $250 million
in investments are needed to complete the project.  The plant has a design capacity of 20 million cubic meters
a year. The Erongo region’s annual demand is 13 million cubic
meters of water.  To contact the reporter on this story:
