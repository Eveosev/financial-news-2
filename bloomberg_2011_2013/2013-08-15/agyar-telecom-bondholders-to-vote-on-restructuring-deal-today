Magyar Telecom BV, the owner of
Hungarian telecommunications company Invitel, asked its
bondholders to vote on a debt-for-equity swap today as the
company seeks to reduce borrowings and attract new investment.  Magyar Telecom, controlled by  Mid Europa Partners LLP , set
an Aug. 15 deadline for responses to its restructuring proposal
and has support from holders of as much as 65 percent of its
notes, it said in an Aug. 13 statement. It’s preparing a scheme
of arrangement, a U.K. court process requiring a positive vote
from holders of 75 percent of the notes, if it doesn’t get 90
percent approval for the deal.  Mid Europa offered to invest 25 million euros ($33 million)
as part of a restructuring deal for Magyar Telecom that would
include bondholders swapping 174 million euros of notes for a 49
percent stake in the business, the company said on July 15.  Magyar Telecom defaulted on its 9.5 percent notes due
December 2016 in June and the notes are now trading at about 45
percent of face value, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
Some 329 million euros of the bonds are outstanding, according
to the company’s July 15 statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
