Jo-Wilfried Tsonga of  France 
withdrew from tennis’s  U.S. Open  to continue his recovery from a
left knee injury suffered at Wimbledon.  Tsonga, ranked eighth by the ATP World Tour, was among a
number of players forced out of Wimbledon by injury in June
before the end of the second round.  “Today I have to take care of myself and make sure I can
play at 100 percent,” the 28-year-old said on his official
 website . “The thinking is simple, the doctors told me it would
be at least two months before my tendon is partially healed and
five months to be completely healed. It would be stupid to go
there knowing full well that I have no chance because I’m not
prepared enough.”  Tsonga said he’s looking to return to the ATP Tour at a
tournament in Metz, France, which starts Sept. 16.  “I still have one month,” he said. “It will come soon
enough, but I am optimistic.”  The U.S. Open, the year’s final Grand Slam championship,
begins Aug. 26 in  New York .  To contact the reporter on this story:
