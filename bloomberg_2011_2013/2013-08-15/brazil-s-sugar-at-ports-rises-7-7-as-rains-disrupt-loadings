The amount of sugar waiting to be
loaded at ports in top producer  Brazil  rose 7.7 percent in the
week ended yesterday as vessels headed for  China  amid rains that
are disrupting loadings, data from Williams Servicos Maritimos
Ltda. showed.  The total amount of sugar waiting to be loaded at the ports
of Recife, Maceio, Vitoria, Paranagua and Santos, the country’s
biggest, was 1.65 million metric tons, data from the Recife,
Brazil-based shipping agency e-mailed yesterday showed. That’s
up from about 1.53 million tons the week earlier.  The ports of Santos and Paranagua got rain yesterday,
disputing loading operations, Luiz Carlos dos Santos Jr., head
of sugar brokerage and operations at SA Commodities in Santos,
said in a report e-mailed yesterday. Harvesting and crushing may
also have been disrupted, he said.  Vessels scheduled to go to China were set to take 270,720
tons of the sweetener, while those bound for  Egypt  would carry
152,500 tons, the data show. Ships headed for Iraq were set to
carry another 78,450 tons.  China was the world’s biggest raw sugar importer last
season and  Indonesia  is forecast to be the top buyer this year,
according to U.S. Department of Agriculture data.  Raw sugar for delivery in October was 0.2 percent lower at
17.22 cents a pound by 5:43 a.m. on ICE Futures U.S. in  New
York .  To contact the reporter on this story:
