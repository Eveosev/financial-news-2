Wesfarmers Ltd. (WES) ,  Australia ’s largest
employer, announced a A$579 million ($530 million) capital
return to shareholders as earnings rose 6 percent amid a
supermarket discounting drive.  Net income rose to A$2.26 billion in the 12 months ended
June 30 from A$2.13 billion a year earlier, the country’s
second-largest retailer said in a regulatory statement. That was
in line with the A$2.27 billion average of eight analyst
estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  Wesfarmers has cut the prices on staples including bread
and milk to win customers as it attempts to turn around its
Coles supermarkets, which it bought alongside the Target, Kmart,
and Officeworks chains in a A$19.6 billion takeover in 2007.
Sales from Coles stores open at least 12 months have grown
faster than those from Woolworths’ supermarket division for at
least 14 consecutive quarters, according to data compiled by
 Bloomberg News .  “The next two to three years will be very positive for
Wesfarmers shareholders,” David Errington, an analyst at Bank
of America Corp.’s Merrill Lynch unit, wrote in a July 31 note
to clients. The company has a “very cash rich generating
business, combined with a balance sheet that looks to be near an
excess capital position,” he wrote.  The Perth-based company said it will make a capital return
of 50 cents per share, representing 1.2 percent of its stock,
according to a separate regulatory statement. Wesfarmers shares
rose 2.4 percent to A$42.93 at 11:08 a.m. in Sydney, marking a
16.5 percent gain this year that’s outpaced the 11 percent
improvement in the benchmark S&P/ASX 200 index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
