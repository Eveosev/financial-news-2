(Corrects debt amount in first paragraph.)  Germany  would transfer about 500
billion euros ($670 billion) of its debt into a redemption fund
amid a proposal by German Finance Minister  Wolfgang Schaeuble ,
Passauer Neue Presse  reported , citing an interview with him.  Schaeuble this week proposed that each euro-area country
set up a national fund to pay down its debt to boost market
confidence in the joint currency. The plan would allow member
countries of the euro region to reduce their debt to 60 percent
of gross domestic product over a span of 20 years, he said.  In Germany’s case, to reduce the country’s current debt
level of 80 percent of gross domestic product to 60 percent, the
fund would amount to about 500 billion euros, including federal,
state and municipal debts, Schaeuble is  quoted as  saying by
Passauer Neue Presse.  To contact the reporter on this story:
