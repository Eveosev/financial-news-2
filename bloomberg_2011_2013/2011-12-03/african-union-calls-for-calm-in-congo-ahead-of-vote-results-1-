African Union Commission President
 Jean Ping  appealed for calm ahead of the Dec. 6 announcement of
provisional results from the Democratic Republic of Congo’s
presidential elections.  Any candidate planning to contest the outcome should do so
“exclusively through the legal channels provided for this
purpose,” Ping said in an e-mailed statement today from Addis
Ababa, the Ethiopian capital where the organization is based.  Ten candidates are challenging incumbent President  Joseph Kabila  in the Congo’s second election since the end of 40 years
of dictatorship and war. At least 18 civilians were killed and
100 were wounded in clashes linked to the election from Nov. 26
to Nov. 28, with most of the dead shot by government soldiers,
according to  Human Rights Watch .  “The announcement of results on Dec. 6 could prompt further
unrest,” the New York-based advocacy group said in a statement
yesterday.  Kabila leads with 15 percent of the voting stations counted
from the vote that was held earlier this week, according to the
country’s electoral commission. Kabila has about 1.5 million
votes so far, while Etienne Tshisekedi, his main rival, has
about 1 million, Daniel Ngoy Mulunda, head of the commission,
told reporters in Kinshasa today.  Final results are expected on Dec. 17, according to the
commission.  To contact the reporter on this story:
