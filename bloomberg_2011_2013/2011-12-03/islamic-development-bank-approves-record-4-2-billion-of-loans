The  Islamic Development Bank , a
Jeddah-based multilateral lender, said it approved a record $4.2
billion in financing for projects around the world this year.  Funding included $105 million for a power-generation,
transmission and distribution program in Mauritania’s capital,
Nouakchott, $53 million for the Saudi Arabian SME Fund and $11
million to support the second phase of a road project in
Morocco, the lender said in an e-mailed statement today.  “As part of IDB’s vision to become a world-class
organization by 2020, the board of directors has also approved
the launching of five IDB pilot gateway offices in Egypt,
Turkey,  Indonesia , Bangladesh and Nigeria to follow up on the
implementation of IDB projects,” President Ahmed Mohamed Ali
said in the statement. “If after three years the progress of
these offices is positive, similar offices could be opened in
the future.”  The bank in July approved a $250 million grant to support a
youth-employment program in Arab countries, including  Egypt  and
Tunisia where protests toppled those countries presidents.  To contact the reporter on this story:
