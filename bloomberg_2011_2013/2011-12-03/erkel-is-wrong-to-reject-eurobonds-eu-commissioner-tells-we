Angela Merkel  is wrong to reject the
possibility of introducing eurobonds, Guenther Oettinger,
European Union commissioner for energy, told  Die Welt .  Joint bonds may help consolidate euro members’ national
budgets so shouldn’t be ruled out, Welt cited Oettinger as
saying, adding he believes Merkel will change her mind.  To contact the reporter on this story:
