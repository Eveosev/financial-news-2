Societe Television Francaise 1 (TFI) , owner
of  France ’s most-watched television channel, will begin offering
pay-TV services next week, Le Figaro reported, citing comments
by Laurent Solly, who heads its TF1 Publicite SA unit.  In the initial phase of the roll-out plan, customers will
be able to buy TF1 pay-TV boxes and cards at 120 Boulanger
stores in France, according to the newspaper. Each card will
cost 19.90 euros ($26.65), be valid for three months and grant
access to three pay-TV channels including LCI, Le Figaro said.
Clients will be able to recharge the card, the daily said.  TF1 is seeking to retain market share and advertising
revenue as it competes with pay-TV operators such as  Vivendi
SA (VIV) ’s Canal Plus. TF1 aims to win thousands of new clients with
its pay-TV offering by the end of 2012, the daily said. It
exited the pay-TV market five years ago with the sale of its
Television Par Satellite unit, according to the newspaper.  To contact the reporter on this story:
