The U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission is investigating an agreement between the Miami
Marlins and the city of Miami and Miami-Dade County to build a
ballpark, the Miami Herald reported, citing two letters.  The SEC is seeking a range of information regarding about
$500 million in bond sales as well as documents on campaign
contributions from the Marlins to local and state officials, the
newspaper said. The letters were delivered to government
attorneys Dec. 1.  The subpoenas give  Miami  and the county until Jan. 6 to
deliver the documents, including information on parking garages
built by Miami and minutes of meetings between government
officials and Marlins owner Jeffery Loria and Major League
Baseball commissioner  Bud Selig , the newspaper said.  Marlins team president David Samson declined to comment to
the Herald, telling the newspaper the Marlins hadn’t received a
subpoena. Miami City Attorney Julie Bru declined to comment to
the newspaper.  Miami-Dade County Deputy Mayor Ed Marquez told the Herald
they were cooperating with the probe.  There was no answer at the Miami Marlins executive offices
when contacted by Bloomberg News over the weekend. Miami City
Attorney Julie Bru and Miami-Dade County Attorney Robert Cuevas
didn’t immediately respond to a voicemail and e-mail sent by
Bloomberg seeking comment. SEC spokesman  John Nester  didn’t
immediately reply to an e-mail sent by Bloomberg News seeking
comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
