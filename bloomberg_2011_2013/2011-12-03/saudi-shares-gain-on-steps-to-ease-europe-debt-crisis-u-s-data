Saudi Arabian shares rose, led by
banks and petrochemical companies, for the first in three days
after central banks took action to ease Europe’s debt crisis and
the U.S. reported record Thanksgiving holiday retail sales.  Saudi British Bank, which is 40 percent owned by HSBC
Holdings Plc, gained as much as 8 percent, the most since
January 2010, and  Al Rajhi Bank (RJHI) , the kingdom’s largest lender by
market value, climbed the most in the month.  Saudi Basic
Industries Corp. (SABIC) , or Sabic, the world’s biggest petrochemicals
maker, rose to the highest value since Nov. 20.  The  Tadawul All Share Index (SASEIDX)  advanced 1.1 percent to
6,169.61, its highest level since Nov. 20, in Riyadh at the
close. The Middle East’s largest bourse has declined 6.8 percent
this year.  “The Saudi market is following global events,” Asim Bukhtiar, an equity analyst at Riyad Capital, said in a phone
interview today. “Any news coming out of Europe is driving
sentiment in the local market as well.”  The  Federal Reserve  and five other central banks lowered
the cost of dollar funding and China cut the capital that banks
need to hold in reserve. Germany and France are leading a push
for tougher enforcement of euro-area budget rules to counter the
debt crisis, now in its third year.  The  S&P 500 (SPX)  climbed 7.4 percent to 1,244.28 since Nov. 25,
snapping a two-week decline to trim its 2011 loss to 1.1
percent. The  Dow Jones Industrial Average  added 787.64 points,
or 7 percent, to 12,019.42 this week and is up 3.8 percent for
the year.  U.S. Retail Sales  U.S. retail sales during the Thanksgiving weekend increased
16 percent to $52.4 billion, the  National Retail Federation 
said, citing a survey conducted by BIGresearch. Jobs data
released by the U.S. Labor Department Dec. 2 showed that
payrolls climbed 120,000, with more than half the hiring coming
from retailers and temporary-help agencies.  “Saudi banks shares have been beaten down quite a bit
because of what is happening in Europe,” Bukhtiar said. “We
were keen to see how they respond to the events when the market
opens today.”  Saudi British Bank (SABB)  gained 5.4 percent to 39 riyals and Al-
Rajhi rose 1.1 percent to 68.5 riyals. Sabic advanced 1.4
percent to 93.75 riyals.  Saudi Arabia’s stock exchange is the only Gulf Arab bourse
open on Saturdays.  To contact the reporter on this story:
