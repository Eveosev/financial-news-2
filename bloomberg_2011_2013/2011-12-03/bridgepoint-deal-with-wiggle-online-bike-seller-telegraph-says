Wiggle Ltd., a U.K.-based online
bicycle retailer, signed a 180-million pound ($281 million)
exclusivity agreement with the private-equity company
 Bridgepoint Capital Ltd. , the Telegraph said.  Under the deal, which values Wiggle at 12 times its
earnings, former owner Isis Equity Partners Plc will receive a
payment if the bike seller is re-sold by Bridgepoint at a
certain price, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
