Bank of England  Governor  Mervyn King 
has been criticized by some senior bankers and business people
for being too gloomy and undermining confidence, the Times said.  King’s comments, including a statement that the economy
faced “extraordinarily serious times,” threatened to reinforce
investor anxiety and worsen funding problems for lenders, the
newspaper cited one unidentified banking official as saying.  Others were less concerned, saying the financial markets
were aware of King’s style of address, the newspaper reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
