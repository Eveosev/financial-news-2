The U.K. economy won’t return to its
2008 peak until early 2014, the Times reported today, citing
 Robert Chote , chairman of the  Office for Budget Responsibility .  There is a 1-in-3 chance of a recession even if the euro
zone recovers, the U.K. newspaper cited Chote as saying. The
economy will grow at 0.7 percent next year compared with a
forecast made by the OBR eight months ago of 2.5 percent, it
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
