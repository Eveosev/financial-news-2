Chinese makers of Christmas ornaments
are experiencing increased sales as growth in the domestic
market makes up for reduced demand in  Europe  and the U.S., the
Financial Times reported.  The industry has been boosted by a rise in the number of
Chinese people who grew up with the holiday, as well as a
growing number of offices, malls and restaurants using Christmas
decorations as marketing tools, the newspaper reported today.  China â€™s Yiwu manufacturing center in eastern Zhejiang
province -- the self-declared Christmas ornament capital of the
world -- has seen a 10 percent increase in exports, while some
companies have had record sales, the FT reported. The number of
companies making Christmas ornaments in Yiwu has risen to 600
from 80 in three years, the FT said.  The increase in demand comes as Chinese manufacturing is
shrinking for the first time in three years and export margins
have been hit by the rising value of the renminbi currency, the
FT said. A  labor shortage  in Yiwu has caused some decoration
makers to outsource production to small workshops, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
