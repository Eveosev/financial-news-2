The European Central Bank should
“significantly lengthen” the maturity of loans to the region’s
banks and “widen the criteria” to accept assets as guarantees,
the chairman of  Intesa Sanpaolo SpA (ISP) ’s management board, Andrea Beltratti, wrote in a commentary in financial daily Il Sole 24
ore.  Banks can continue to lend to companies only if they are
able to secure medium and long-term funding, Beltratti wrote.  The new budget measures that Italy will adopt in the coming
days should be credible and the country shouldn’t rule out
asking the  International Monetary Fund  for aid, he wrote.  To contact the reporter on this story:
