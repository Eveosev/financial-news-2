Turkish President  Abdullah Gul 
overturned a law reducing prison terms for match-fixing charges
to one to three years from as much as 12 years, according to the
presidential  website .  Gul returned the bill for review to Turkish parliament,
saying sentencing reductions “give the impression that they are
aimed at releasing particular people from jail,” it said.
Parliament approved the law on Nov. 25, the website said.  Scores of people, including Aziz Yildirim, league-champion
 Fenerbahce’s (FENER)  chairman, executives, coaches, players, journalists
and former officials have been jailed as part of a probe into
alleged match-fixing charges in Turkish soccer.  Special prosecutor Mehmet Berk’s investigation became
public July 4 after raids on clubs, including runner-up
 Trabzonspor (TSPOR)  and cup winner  Besiktas .  To contact the reporter on this story:
