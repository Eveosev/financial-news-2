Brazil ’s Federal Police and the
nation’s securities regulator are investigating whether certain
institutions had access to privileged information regarding a
central bank interest rate decision,  Veja  columnist Lauro Jardim
reported, without saying where he got the information.  Federal Police and CVM, as the regulator is known, are
seeking to know whether the institutions benefited from the 50
basis-point rate cut on Aug. 31, the Sao Paulo-based magazine
reported. The column didn’t name any of the firms being probed.  Brazil’s central bank declined to comment to Bloomberg News
in an e-mailed statement. CVM and Federal Police didn’t
immediately return calls and e-mails seeking comments during out
of regular working hours.  To contact the reporter on this story:
