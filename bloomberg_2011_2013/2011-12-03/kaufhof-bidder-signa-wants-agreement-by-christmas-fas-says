Signa Holding GmbH, the Austrian
real-estate company aiming to buy  Metro AG â€™s Kaufhof department-
store chain, wants an agreement completed by Christmas,
Frankfurter Allgemeine Sonntagszeitung said, citing investor
Rene Benko.  Signa will make a concrete offer in the coming days to
allow the Metro supervisory board to decide at its Dec. 16
meeting, FAS reported Benko as saying in a preview of an article
to be published tomorrow. He declined to define the size of the
bid, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
