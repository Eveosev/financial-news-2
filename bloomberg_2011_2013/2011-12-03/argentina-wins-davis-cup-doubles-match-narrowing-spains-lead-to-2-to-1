Argentina’s  David Nalbandian  and
Eduardo Schwank defeated Feliciano Lopez and Fernando Verdasco
in Davis Cup doubles to prevent Spain from retaining the trophy.  The challengers won 6-4, 6-2, 6-3 in Seville, Spain today
to cut Spain’s lead in the best-of-five competition to 2-1.  Rafael Nadal  and  David Ferrer  yesterday both won singles
matches to open the country’s defense of the cup, the top team
competition in men’s tennis.  Tomorrow, Nadal takes on 11th-ranked Juan Martin del Potro
before Ferrer is scheduled to meet Juan Monaco, who is ranked
26th by the men’s tennis tour.  Ferrer, No. 5 in the ATP World Tour rankings, came back to
beat del Potro 6-2, 6-7 (2-7), 3-6, 6-4, 6-3 in a 4 hour, 43-
minute match on indoor clay courts.  Ferrer is now 17-4 in Davis Cup matches, including a 12-0
record on clay. Del Potro’s record dropped to 9-3 at the Davis
Cup.  In the first match, Nadal, ranked No. 2, won 6-1, 6-1, 6-2
over  Monaco . Nadal is now 19-1 in singles for Spain, with his
only loss coming as a 17-year-old in 2004.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
