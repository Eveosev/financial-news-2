     Dec. 3 (Bloomberg) -- Italy ’s new government should define a
long-term national energy plan aimed at strengthening the
country’s infrastructure and ensuring production costs are in
line with the European average,  Enel SpA (ENEL)  Chairman Paolo Andrea Colombo told daily Il Sole 24 Ore.  While the global situation is “problematic,” “our growth
abroad allows us to look to the future with more optimism,”
Colombo told the newspaper in an interview.  Net debt at Enel, Italy’s largest utility, increased to
47.8 billion euros ($64 billion) as of Sept. 30 from 46.1
billion euros at the end of the first half.  “We have to take into account seasonal effects,” Colombo
said when asked if he was worried about rising debt. He added
that the company is defining its strategic financing plan for
the coming years.  To contact the reporter on this story:
