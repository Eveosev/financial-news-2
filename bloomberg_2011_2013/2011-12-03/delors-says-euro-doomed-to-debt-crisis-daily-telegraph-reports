Jacques Delors, the former European
Commission president who played a central role in creating the
euro in 1999, told the  Daily Telegraph  that politicians’ errors
at the time “doomed” the currency to the current debt crisis.  Delors, who led the commission from 1985 to 1995, said
leaders ignored the “fundamental weaknesses and imbalances” of
the member countries’ economies and failed to create strong
central powers for the group, the newspaper  reported  today.  All European countries must now share the blame for the
crisis, which was triggered by excessive borrowing by  Greece ,
Italy and other countries that took the euro region to the
“brink of disaster,” Delors told the Daily Telegraph.  Delors blamed part of the crisis on Germany’s strict demand
that the  European Central Bank  shouldn’t support highly indebted
euro users over inflation fears, the Daily Telegraph said.
Delors also blamed the “stubbornness of the Germanic idea of
monetary control” and the lack of a shared vision among the
member countries, according to the report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
