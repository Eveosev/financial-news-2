Steve Thompson , who was part of
England’s Rugby World Cup winning team in 2003, retired after a
neck injury, the Rugby Football Union said today.  Thompson, 33, played 73 times for his country and was a
member of the Lions in 2005. In March, he became the English
hooker with the most appearances for his country, beating Brian
Moore’s mark.  He spent 10 seasons with Northampton and also played for
Leeds Carnegie and Brive. He suffered a neck injury training
with his new club,  London Wasps , and aggravated it in a match
against Worcester at the end of October. He’ll need surgery, the
RFU said today in an e-mailed statement.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
