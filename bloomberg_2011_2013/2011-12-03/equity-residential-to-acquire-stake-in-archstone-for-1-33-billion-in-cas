Equity Residential (EQR)  said it will
acquire a 26.5 percent stake in closely held Archstone for $1.33
billion in cash.  Equity Residential, in a statement, said the properties
under contract represent one-half of the interests owned by
affiliates of  Bank of America Corp. (BAC)  and  Barclays Plc. (BARC)   Archstone is an owner, operator and developer of
multifamily apartment properties. Archstone’s remaining
“significant holder,” Equity Residential said, has the first
right to acquire this stake from the sellers.  Chicago-based Equity Residential is the largest publicly
traded U.S. apartment landlord. It said it will record $5.8
million in expenses from the acquisition in the fourth quarter,
which will affect per-share earnings and funds from operations.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
