     Dec. 3 (Bloomberg) --Chelsea got goals from Didier Drogba,
Salomon Kalou and  Daniel Sturridge  to defeat Newcastle and move
up to third place in English soccer’s Premier League.  Newcastle’s Tim Krul saved a Frank Lampard penalty before
Drogba’s header put the visitors ahead. Kalou scored in the 88th
minute and Sturridge scored in injury time.  The three points push Chelsea into third place with 28 
points, even with Tottenham. The Blues are ahead of Spurs, which
hosts Bolton this afternoon at home, on goal difference.
Manchester City, which plays Norwich today, is on 35 points and 
second-place  Manchester United , on 30 points, visits Aston Villa 
in the late match.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
