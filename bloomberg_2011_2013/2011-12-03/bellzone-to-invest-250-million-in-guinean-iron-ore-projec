Bellzone Mining Plc (BZM) , an  iron-ore 
company operating in West Africa, will spend at least $250
million developing the Forecariah mine in Guinea, said Frederic
Materne, the project manager.  “The funds will be invested in iron ore, the construction
of roads and the port,” Materne said in remarks broadcast on
Radio Television Guineenne, the state-owned broadcaster based in
Conakry, the capital. “The investment may increase to $350
million” if production is boosted, he said.  Bellzone Chief Executive Officer Nik Zuks said in August
iron-ore production is expected to start at Forecariah in March.  To contact the reporter on this story:
