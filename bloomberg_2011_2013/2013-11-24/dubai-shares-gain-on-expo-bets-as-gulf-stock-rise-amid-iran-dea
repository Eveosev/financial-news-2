Dubai’s  benchmark stock index  rose
to the highest in almost two weeks on bets the emirate will win
the right to host the World Expo 2020. Shares in other Gulf
markets climbed as Iran signed a nuclear accord.  The  DFM General Index (DFMGI)  climbed 0.8 percent to 2,913.89 at
10:56 a.m. in the emirate, bringing the gain for the year to 79
percent. Emaar Properties PJSC, builder of the world’s biggest
shopping mall by floor space, rose 0.3 percent and  Dubai
Investments PJSC (DIC)  was poised for the highest close since October
2008. Kuwait’s gauge advanced 0.5 percent and Qatar’s increased
0.7 percent.  Dubai is one of four cities competing to host the World
Expo and results will be announced Nov. 27. A successful bid
would be a milestone in Dubai’s recovery from a property crash
in 2009 that wiped as much as 65 percent off home prices. It
would boost economic growth by 0.5 of a percentage point per
year and by about 2 percentage points in 2020, Bank of America
Corp. said in a Sept. 26 report.  “The market is completely focused on is Expo 2020
decision,” said Mohammad Ali Yasin, managing director at Abu
Dhabi-based NBAD Securities, “I don’t see an immediate impact”
on the markets in the United Arab Emirates from  Iran  as it
“wasn’t the risk market was seeing or fearing.”  Iran and world powers struck an accord that broke a decade-long diplomatic stalemate, setting limits on the Islamic
Republic’s nuclear program in exchange for relief from
sanctions. The agreement with Iran, which is separated from the
Gulf by the Strait of Hormuz, is the first to be reached since
the country’s nuclear program came under international scrutiny
in 2003, and may help avert a nuclear arms race in the region.  Abu Dhabi’s ADX General Index and Oman’s MSM30 Index were
little changed, while Bahrain’s measure lost 0.4 percent. Emaar
climbed to 6.28 dirhams and Dubai Investments, which holds
stakes in more than 40 businesses, rose 0.9 percent to 2.24
dirhams.  The Iran accord “is not a total surprise,” said Fadi Al Said, head of investments at ING Investment Management Middle
East Ltd. “Some of it has already been priced in.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
