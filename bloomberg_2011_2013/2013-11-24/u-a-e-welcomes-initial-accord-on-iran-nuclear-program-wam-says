The  United Arab Emirates , the Arab
world’s second biggest economy, welcomed the agreement between
 Iran  and world powers over the Islamic republic’s nuclear
program, according to the state-run news agency WAM.  The nation’s cabinet hopes the interim accord will lead to
a permanent settlement to help preserve regional stability and
prevent nuclear proliferation, WAM reported. “The deal is a
step in the right direction,” Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, the nation’s vice president and Dubai’s ruler, said on
Twitter. He led the cabinet meeting today.  Iran and world powers struck an accord that broke a decade-long diplomatic stalemate, setting limits on the Iranian nuclear
program in exchange for about $7 billion in relief from
sanctions over six months. The U.A.E. is among U.S. allies in
the six-member Gulf Cooperation Council that oppose allowing
Iran to develop nuclear weapons. Iran says it has no intention
of developing an atomic arsenal.  Commerce between Iran and the U.A.E. declined 83 percent to
$4 billion because of international sanctions imposed on the
Islamic republic, U.S. Secretary of State  John Kerry  said Nov.
11. Direct trade between Iran and Dubai, the U.A.E.’s financial
hub, stood at 36 billion dirhams ($9.8 billion) in 2011.  To contact the reporter on this story:
