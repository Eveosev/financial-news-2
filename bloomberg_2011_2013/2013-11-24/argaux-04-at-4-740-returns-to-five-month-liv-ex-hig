Twelve bottles of 2004  Chateau
Margaux , a first-growth wine estate in the Medoc region north of
Bordeaux, sold for 2,920 pounds ($4,740) on Liv-ex, reaching a
five-month high after selling pressure since June.  The sale two days ago, involving two half-cases, was 4.3
percent up from the low for this year of 2,800 pounds at which
the vintage traded in January, May and on three occasions since
September, according to data on Liv-ex’s Cellar Watch website.  The Liv-Ex Fine Wine 50 Index has given up all of the gains
it made in the first 10 weeks of the year as investors deterred
by prices of recent Bordeaux wines, particularly first growths,
have diversified outside the region. The index fell 1.5 percent
in October, its sixth monthly decline in the past seven,
extending a slide which has taken it down 8 percent since mid-March.  While first growths are underperforming, they “provide
liquidity in normal trading conditions, and will always play a
major role in the portfolio,” Will Beck, partner of London-based Wine Asset Managers LLP, said in a market report. The fund
has $20 million under management.  The 2004 vintage of Margaux has more than tripled in price
since June 2005, when it traded at 900 pounds a case after it
first came to market, according to Liv-ex data. It is still 26
percent down from the 3,950 pounds it fetched in April 2011 at
the height of Chinese demand for Bordeaux.  Left-Bank Estate  The 2004 Margaux ranks as the estate’s second-cheapest wine
of the past 10 years, ahead only of the 2012 vintage, according
to merchant prices collated by Liv-ex on its Cellar Watch 
website.  The vintage was awarded a 93 rating on a 100-point scale by
U.S. critic  Robert Parker , putting it below at least six
subsequent years, according to the eRobertParker.com website.
Vintages with higher ratings since then include the 2005 and
2006 wines, as well as every year from 2008 to 2011.  Greek retail magnate Andre Mentzelopoulos bought Chateau
Margaux, whose wines have been sold in London since the early
18th century, in 1977. It has been run since his death in 1980
by daughter Corinne.  The estate has 80 hectares (198 acres) planted with red-grape vines  Cabernet Sauvignon , Merlot, Petit Verdot and
Cabernet Franc and 12 hectares with white Sauvignon Blanc.  It produces an annual average 130,000 bottles of its main
wine, a similar quantity of second wine Pavillon Rouge du
Chateau Margaux and 15,000 bottles of white Pavillon Blanc,
according to its website.  The vineyard is on the left bank of the Gironde estuary and
ranked among the top Medoc first-growth estates in the
classification drawn up for Napoleon III’s 1855 Paris
Exhibition, which remains in force.  To contact the reporter on this story:
