Former Foreign Minister Alexander Downer said Australia needs to maintain its intelligence-gathering abilities as tension with  Indonesia  escalates to the
highest level in 14 years amid claims of spying.  Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott has written to
President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono seeking to repair relations
after Indonesia called a halt to co-operation on asylum seekers
and withdrew its ambassador from Canberra following a media
report that the phones of leaders were tapped.  “We need to preserve the integrity of our intelligence
capabilities but we need to try to work on fixing up the
relationship with Indonesia as best we can,” Downer,
Australia’s longest-serving foreign minister, said on Sky News
television today.  Yudhoyono received Abbott’s letter and is studying it,
Teuku Faizasyah, a spokesman for the president, said yesterday.  Indonesia has also called a halt to military co-operation
and is reviewing cattle exports from  Australia . Several hundred
people gathered outside the Australian Embassy in Jakarta on
Nov. 21, burning that country’s flag, police said.  Yudhoyono’s mobile phone activity was tracked for 15 days
in August 2009, the Australian Broadcasting Corp. said on its
website Nov. 18, citing documents leaked by Edward Snowden, a
former U.S. intelligence contractor who is wanted in the U.S.
for releasing secret information. At least once, intelligence
agencies tried to listen to a conversation although the call
lasted less than a minute and couldn’t be tapped, according to
the report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
