The average price for regular
gasoline at U.S. pumps rose 3.41 cents in the past two weeks to
$3.2517 a gallon, according to Lundberg Survey Inc.  The survey covers the period ended Nov. 22 and is based on
information obtained at about 2,500 filling stations by the
Camarillo, California-based company. The average, which reached
a year-to-date peak in the survey of $3.795 on Feb. 22, is about
22.02 cents below a year earlier. The increase is the first
since the period ended Sept. 6.  “This is the end of the price cutting,”  Trilby Lundberg ,
the president of Lundberg Survey, said in a telephone interview
today. “Refiner margins are still squeezed, and now retailers
are paying higher wholesale prices so they’re getting squeezed.
There’s probably another five to 10 cents increase to come on
the street even if crude  oil prices  don’t jump higher.”  The highest price for gasoline in the lower 48 U.S. states
among the markets surveyed was in  San Diego , at $3.58 a gallon,
Lundberg said. The lowest price was in Tulsa, Oklahoma, where
customers paid an average of $2.93 a gallon. Regular gasoline
averaged $3.50 gallon on Long Island,  New York , and $3.54 in  Los
Angeles .  Gasoline futures  on the  New York Mercantile Exchange  rose
17.27 cents, or 6.8 percent, to $2.7261 a gallon in the two
weeks ended Nov. 22 as refinery upsets and longer-than-expected
plant turnarounds reduced supplies.  Gasoline stockpiles  fell 345,000 barrels in the week ended
Nov. 15 to 208.9 million, the lowest since the week of Nov. 23,
2012, according to the Energy Information Administration, the
statistical arm of the Energy Department.  To contact the reporters on this story:
