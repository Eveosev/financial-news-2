Total SA (FP)  will decide whether to
proceed with the Kaombo oil project offshore Angola by mid-2014,
the same time as it plans to start pumping from the CLOV fields
that may help push the country ahead of  Nigeria  as Africa’s
largest crude producer.  Feasibility studies are under way for the 600-million-barrel Kaombo site in Block 32, which is expected to produce
200,000 barrels a day after its scheduled start by mid-2017,
Jean-Michel Lavergne, the local unit’s general manager, told
reporters yesterday in Porto Amboim, Angola, 260 kilometers (162
miles) south of the capital, Luanda. He was leading a tour of
the first floating production, storage and offloading vessel to
be finished in  Angola  with local labor.  The $10 billion CLOV project in Block 17 will produce
160,000-barrels-a-day, helping Angola achieve a target of 2
million barrels a day by 2015 and rival Nigeria as the
continent’s leading producer. Paris-based Total, which pumps the
most crude in Angola, is among companies such as  Chevron Corp. (CVX) ,
 BP Plc (BP/)  and  Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM)  being urged by the state to use
more Angolans in an industry that employs just 1 percent of
nationals while accounting for nearly all exports.  “One third of current Angolan oil is produced by Total,”
Lavergne said. “We want to help young Angolans to obtain
quality education so that they can have decent jobs with good
salaries,” Lavergne said.  Angola pumped 1.71 million barrels a day in October
compared with 1.99 million barrels a day by Nigeria, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg. Cobalt Energy International Co.’s
Cameia, Mavinga and Lontra projects will further boost the
country’s output, Minister Jose Maria Botelho de Vasconcelos
said in a Nov. 7 interview. Total currently pumps about 600,000
barrels a day in Angola, according to company documents.  Local Hiring  The company plans to drill two wells next year in Blocks 25
and 40, Lavergne said. Each well reaching 6 kilometers below  sea
level  will cost $120 million, he said.  Total spent $1.6 billion in Angola on CLOV, hires 100
nationals each year and will invest $4 million in the Porto
Amboim community, Lavergne said. Total is increasing the number
of Angolans on its staff to 76 percent this year from 68 percent
in 2006 and half the managers will be locals, Lavergne said in a
June interview.  CLOV, which stands for the fields Cravo, Lirio, Orquidea,
and Violeta, has 34 sub-sea wells at depths of 1.1 to 1.4
kilometers located 140 kilometers northwest of Luanda and is
estimated to hold 505 million barrels of crude, company
documents show.  Biggest Crane  The 305-meter (1,000-foot) long CLOV FPSO, as it’s known,
will be christened Dec. 5 at the Paenal Porto Amboim Estaleiros
Navais fabrication yard at Porto Amboim, Lavergne said
yesterday. A Paenel crane,  Africa ’s largest, added final units
to the $2 billion ship constructed by Daewoo Shipbuilding Marine
and Engineering Co. in  South Korea .  The FPSO can store 1.78 million barrels of oil and process
160,000 barrels a day. It will produce two types of oil: 32-35
degree American Petroleum Institute gravity, which is considered
light oil, from the Cravo and Liro fields, and 20-30 degree API
medium-weight-oil from Orquidea and Violeta, the company said.  A crane called Jamba with capacity to lift 2,500 metric
tons was installed in June at Paenal to work on the 119,000-ton
CLOV FPSO, N’goma FPSO for  Exxon Mobil  and the Mafumeira Sul
project for Chevron. Crews manufactured 7,700 tons of equipment
for the CLOV ship and installed units on its deck including a
water treatment module, company documents show.  After Girassol, Dalia, and Pazflor, CLOV is the fourth
deep-water project to be undertaken on the block operated by
Total with a 40 percent share. Partners include  Statoil ASA (STL)  with
23.3 percent, Exxon Mobil with 20 percent and BP at 16.7
percent.  Brent crude oil for January delivery fell 1.1 percent to
$109.97 a barrel as of 4:02 p.m. London time.  To contact the reporters on this story:
