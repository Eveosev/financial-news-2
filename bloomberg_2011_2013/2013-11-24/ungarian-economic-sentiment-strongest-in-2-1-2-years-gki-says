Hungary’s economic-sentiment index
jumped to its strongest level in more than 2 1/2 years in
November as businesses and consumers became more optimistic
about their prospects.  The  index  rose to minus 6.1, the best reading since
February 2011, from minus 9.3 in October, the GKI research
institute in Budapest said in an e-mailed statement. Business
confidence increased to minus 0.1, the highest since April 2011,
from minus 2.3 in October, while the  consumer-confidence  gauge
rose to minus 23.3 from minus 29.4.  Prime Minister  Viktor Orban , who leads in opinion polls
before parliamentary elections next year, is seeking to aid a
recovery from a second recession in four years. Gross domestic
product advanced 0.8 percent last quarter from the previous
three months, more than economists expected.  The government predicts the economy will expand 2 percent
next year.  The improvement in business confidence was driven by
manufacturing companies, which became “significantly more
optimistic,” while the outlook in other sectors mostly
stagnated, GKI said.  Construction companies and retailers reported an increasing
willingness to boost hiring, while households saw an improvement
in the economic outlook, GKI said.  Consumer confidence soared “at a rarely seen” pace, as
fears of becoming unemployed diminished significantly, according
to GKI.  GKI’s indexes are calculated as a balance of positive and
negative answers to questions about the outlook for the economy.  To contact the reporter on this story:
