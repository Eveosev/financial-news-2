Luxoft Holding Inc. (LXFT) , the software
development unit of Moscow-based IBS Group Holding Ltd., rallied
to the highest level in five months in New York on prospects the
company will benefit from revenue outside of  Russia .  The company, whose clients include Boeing Co. and UBS AG,
has more than doubled since its June debut, climbing 12 percent
to $37.70 last week. The advance sent valuations to 20 times
estimated earnings, surpassing the average multiple of 6.7 for
the average company on the Bloomberg-Russia-US Equity Index. The
gauge of the most-traded Russian stocks in the U.S. posted a
fifth weekly decline. RTS index futures rose 0.3 percent to
145,090 in U.S. hours.  While most of Luxoft’s programmers are based in Russia and
Ukraine, the Zug, Switzerland-based company generates the
majority of its revenue from Europe and the U.S. Companies in
Russia, which is expanding at the slowest pace since the
recession in 2009, are trading at 4.3 times estimated earnings
on average, the cheapest valuation among 21  emerging markets 
tracked by Bloomberg.  “Luxoft is a global play, rather than a Russia play,”
Mansur Mammadov, a  money manager  at Kazimir Partners, which
oversees $300 million in assets, said by phone from Moscow Nov.
22. The firm owns about $500,000 worth of Luxoft stock, he said.
“They aren’t exposed to so many of the potential Russian risks.
Even though they have their programmers in Russia and enjoy low
cost and great education of Russian labor, they don’t depend on
contracts from the government or state companies.”  A software engineer makes $20,000 in Russia outside the
biggest cities, compared with $95,000 in the U.S., Otkritie
Capital said in a Nov. 13 note.  India, China  Russia’s benchmark index’s valuation compares with ratios
of 13.2 for India’s  S&P BSE Sensex Index (SENSEX) , 11 for Brazil’s
 Ibovespa (IBOV)  and 8.6 for China’s  Shanghai Composite Index (SHCOMP) , according
to data compiled by Bloomberg. Russia was ranked the most
corrupt among the Group of 20 nations in Transparency
International’s 2012 corruption perceptions index.  Russia’s jobless rate increased to a six-month high of 5.5
percent in September, the Federal Statistics Service in Moscow
said a Nov. 20 statement. Growth this year may miss the
government’s 1.8 percent forecast by as much as 0.3 percentage
point, Economy Minister  Alexei Ulyukayev  said Nov. 13.  Rus Lux Limited, a subsidiary of Russia’s VTB Group, is
selling 2.8 million of Luxoft shares for $34 each and the offer
is oversubscribed by more than three times, according to Alina Plaia, head of external communications at Luxoft. The company
won’t receive any proceeds from the sale, it said in a Nov. 21
statement. Luxoft had raised $69.6 million in its IPO in June as
the company sold 4.1 million shares for $17 each.  Higher Forecast  Luxoft raised its revenue forecast for the fiscal year
ending March 2014 to at least $384 million, a 22 percent
increase from a year earlier, Dmitry Loschinin, chief executive
officer at Luxoft, said on a Nov. 13 conference call.  “Liquidity helps and fundamentals are good,” Moshe Katri,
an analyst at New York-based Cowen & Co. said by phone Nov. 22.
He rates the stock the equivalent of buy. “Luxoft has a very
unique business model, which helps them do work in more
effective way.”  The  Market Vectors Russia ETF (RSX) , the largest dedicated
Russian exchange-traded fund, rose 0.2 percent to $28.73,
gaining for the first time in five weeks. RTS Volatility Index,
which measures expected swings in the  stock futures , decreased
2.6 percent to 20.02.  Polyus Gold International Ltd. (PGIL) , Russia’s biggest gold
producer, fell 3.9 percent last week to $3.02 in New York to
trade at a 2.8 percent discount to its London shares. German Pikhoya, 43, will resign as chief executive officer at Polyus
Gold, the company said in a Nov. 22 statement.  United Co. Rusal (486) , a Moscow-based aluminum producer,
dropped 0.9 percent to HK$2.17 in Hong Kong trading as of
11:17 a.m. local time. The MSCI Asia Pacific Index gained 0.5
percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
