The U.K. said it will give “long-term support” to the  Philippines  after Super Typhoon Haiyan,
pledging 11 million pounds ($18 million) to build infrastructure
and protect women after the storm killed more than 5,000 people.  The U.K. government will send four extra flights carrying
tents, blankets and cooking sets over the next six days,
International Development Secretary Justine Greening said in an
e-mailed statement today as she visited the Cebu and Tacloban
regions.  “I have visited some of the worst-hit areas and heard from
survivors who have lost everything,” Greening said in the
statement. “The U.K. will be working hard to help build a
better future for all the people of the Philippines, including
girls and women, who are often the ones who suffer
disproportionally in the wake of crises like this.”  The U.K.  Department for International Development , together
with the Rockefeller Foundation and the  Asian Development Bank ,
are providing 5 million pounds to improve cities with measures
such as flood defenses, while 3 million pounds will be allocated
to help women, according to the statement. The remaining 3
million pounds will fund food and tools.  The British government has donated more than 50 million
pounds to provide shelter, food, water and medicine after the
typhoon, the Department for International Development said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
