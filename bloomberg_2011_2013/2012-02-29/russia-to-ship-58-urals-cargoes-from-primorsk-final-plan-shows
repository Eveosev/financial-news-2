Russia will export 58 cargoes of
100,000 metric tons each of Urals crude from the Baltic Sea port
of Primorsk in March, four more than this month, according to a
final loading schedule obtained by Bloomberg News.  This is in line with the volume shown in the preliminary
program released on Feb. 27.  The final loadings for Urals from Novorossiysk on the  Black
Sea  were revised up to 3.435 million tons from 3.415 million
tons in the provisional program after a 20,000-ton lot was
added, the plans show. That compares with 3 million tons of
crude, including 160,000 tons of Siberian Light, from the port
this month.  The nation will ship three cargoes totaling 200,000 tons of
Siberian Light crude from Tuapse on the Black Sea, unchanged
from the preliminary plan, the document shows.  Loading programs are monthly schedules of crude shipments
compiled by field operators to allow buyers and sellers to plan
their supply and trading activities.  To contact the reporter on this story:
