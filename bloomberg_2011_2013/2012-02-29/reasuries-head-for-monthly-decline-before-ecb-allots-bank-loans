Treasuries headed for their first
monthly decline since October on speculation optimism about the
U.S. recovery and a European Central Bank allotment of loans
today will bolster investor appetite for higher-yielding assets.  U.S. government securities handed investors a 0.5 percent
loss in February as of yesterday, according to Bank of America
Merrill Lynch indexes, dropping as the economy showed signs of
improvement. The ECB will grant euro-region banks 470 billion
euros ($633 billion) in its second offering of three-year loans
today, according a Bloomberg News survey of analysts.  Concern about “the euro area for the time being seems to
be a diminished factor,” said Alessandro Mercuri, an interest-
rate strategist at Lloyds Bank Corporate Markets in  London . “If
the euro area painfully and slowly sorts itself out we should
see yields moving higher towards 2.25 percent in the next three-
to-six months, because we’re optimistic about the ability of the
 U.S. economy  to keep growing.”  The 10-year  note  yielded 1.96 percent at 10:08 a.m. London
time, according to Bloomberg Bond Trader prices. The 2 percent
security due February 2022 traded at 100 11/32. The yield has
climbed from 1.8 percent at the end of January.  To contact the reporters on this story:
