A Paris court rejected a request by
 Areva SA (AREVA) ’s former chief executive for an investigation into what
prompted the world’s largest nuclear reactor builder to
commission a report on the acquisition of UraMin Inc.  Anne Lauvergeon  didn’t have “a legitimate reason” to
request the probe, Areva said today in an e-mailed statement on
the decision. The report “didn’t target Mrs. Lauvergeon. This
study was meant to verify that the interests of the company
hadn’t been harmed.”  Lauvergeon accused the company of commissioning the report
on the buyout, done during her time as CEO, to find information
that might damage her reputation. Her husband was spied on to
see if he profited inappropriately from the 2007 acquisition of
UraMin, a Canadian uranium miner, she claimed. Lauvergeon was
denied a third term at the state-controlled company last year
and replaced by Luc Oursel in June, two weeks before her
contract expired.  Her lawyers didn’t immediately respond to requests for
comment on the decision. The ruling on the request is an interim
measure while Lauvergeon pursues a broader case against the
company, claiming she was undermined by other Areva employees.  Lauvergeon has also filed a criminal complaint over the
spying allegations. Areva announced this month that an
investigation ordered by its board into the UraMin acquisition
found no evidence of fraud, though it did recommend greater
oversight of such deals. The company has taken a 1.46 billion-
euro ($2 billion) write down for 2011 on the value of UraMin.  To contact the reporter on this story:
