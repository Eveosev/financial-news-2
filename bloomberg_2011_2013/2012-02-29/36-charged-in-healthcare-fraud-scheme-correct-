Thirty-six people, including 10
doctors and three lawyers, were charged in a no-fault auto
insurance scheme that made more than $275 million.  The ring, which consisted mostly of Russian-born U.S.
residents, used “medical fraud mills,” phony clinics that
billed insurers for unnecessary treatments, according to the
indictment.  Lawyers connected to the scheme filed fraudulent personal
injury claims and suits to make additional money, the government
said in the indictment. Charges against participants in the
alleged scheme include racketeering conspiracy, health-care
fraud conspiracy, conspiracy to commit mail fraud and conspiracy
to launder money.  New York  law requires vehicles registered in the state to
carry no-fault insurance providing as much as $50,000 per person
to cover injuries sustained in auto accidents, according to the
government.  The case is U.S. v. Zemlyansky, 12-CR-171, U.S. District
Court, Southern District of New York ( Manhattan ).  To contact the reporter on this story:
