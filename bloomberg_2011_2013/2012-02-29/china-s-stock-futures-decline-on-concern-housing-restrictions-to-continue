China’s stocks  fell, dragging the
benchmark index lower for the first time in nine days, on
concern the government will retain measures to curb gains in
housing prices this year.  China Vanke Co. (000002)  led a gauge of developers down the most in
three months after the  China  Securities Journal said Shanghai
scrapped a plan allowing some non-local residents to buy second
homes. PetroChina Co. slid the most in almost two weeks as  crude
oil  traded near a one-week low. Chinese liquor maker Kweichow
Moutai Co. and Wuliangye Yibin Co. advanced at least 1.3 percent
on speculation earnings growth for consumer staples producers
will be shielded from an economic slowdown.  The  Shanghai Composite Index (SHCOMP)  sank 23.37 points, or 1
percent, to 2,428.49 at the close, snapping an eight-day, 4
percent gain. The  CSI 300 Index (SHSZ300)  lost 1.1 percent to 2,634.14.
The  Bloomberg China-US 55 Index (CH55BN) , the measure of the most-traded
U.S.-listed Chinese companies, added 1.7 percent yesterday.  “The property policy reversal has damped investors’
expectations that an easing of policies would put the economy
back on track,” said Dai Ming, a  fund manager  at  Shanghai 
Kingsun Investment Management & Consulting Co. “That will weigh
on sentiment given we’ve had a good rally this year.”  The  Shanghai index  advanced 5.9 percent in February,
capping its biggest monthly gain since October 2010, on the
prospect the central bank will add to a Feb. 18 cut in  reserve
requirements  to halt a decline in economic growth. For the year,
the measure has rebounded 10 percent and trades at 10.1 times
estimated profit, compared with a record low of 8.9 times on
Jan. 6,  weekly data  compiled by Bloomberg showed.  Residence Permits  The 14-day  relative strength measure  for the Shanghai
Composite, measuring how rapidly prices have advanced or dropped
during a specified time period, was at 71.7 yesterday. Readings
above 70 indicate a price may be poised to fall.  A measure tracking property stocks in the Shanghai
Composite sank 3 percent today, the most since Nov. 30. It had
advanced 17 percent this year through yesterday on expectations
local governments will challenge Beijing’s policy of cooling
housing prices.  Vanke, the biggest listed property developer, dropped 2.8
percent to 8.28 yuan. Poly Real Estate Group Co., the second
largest, declined 3.3 percent to 11.10 yuan.  Gemdale Corp. (600383) 
retreated 3.2 percent to 5.80 yuan.  Shanghai halted a plan to allow non-local residents who
have held the city’s residence permits for three years to buy
second homes, the China Securities Journal reported yesterday,
citing local housing transaction centers. The city was loosening
its definition of locals to let the residence-permit holders to
make second home purchases, the Shanghai Securities News
reported last week.  Crude Oil  The city’s policy reversal is negative for property stocks
and it’s a clear message that the central government doesn’t
want loosening to take place too fast, Alan Jin, an analyst at
Mizuho Securities  Asia , wrote in a note to clients.  PetroChina, the nation’s biggest oil company, fell 0.8
percent to 10.52 yuan, its biggest loss since Feb. 16.  China
Oilfield Services Ltd. (2883) , the drilling unit of the nation’s
largest offshore oil producer, lost 1.6 percent to 17.39 yuan.  Oil for April delivery in  New York  dropped as much as 0.3
percent to $106.20 a barrel in electronic trading today. The
contract yesterday slipped 1.9 percent to $106.55, the lowest
close since Feb. 22 and the biggest drop since Jan. 20.  Consumer Stocks  A measure of 23 consumer staples stocks in the CSI 300
climbed 0.5 percent, the only gain among the 10 industry groups.  Kweichow Moutai, China’s biggest producer of baijiu liquor
by market value, rose 1.9 percent to 204.46 yuan. Wuliangye, the
second biggest, added 1.3 percent to 35.24 yuan.  Beijing Yanjing
Brewery Co. (000729) , the third-biggest brewer, climbed 1 percent to
15.04 yuan.  Valuations for food and beverage companies were 24 percent
more expensive than the broader market as of Feb. 27, less than
half of the average historical premium of 58 percent since 2005,
Tong Xun, an analyst at Shenyin & Wanguo Securities Co., wrote
in a report yesterday. First-quarter profits for Kweichow Moutai
and Wuliangye may increase as much as 45 percent from a year
earlier, according to the report.  China’s statistics bureau and logistics federation is
scheduled to release a  manufacturing index  for this month
tomorrow. The measure may rebound to 50.9, according to the
median estimate of 22 economists in a survey by Bloomberg News.
It was at 50.5 in January, above the 50 threshold for expansion.  In U.S. trading yesterday, the  Dow Jones Industrial Average (INDU) 
closed above 13,000 for the first time since 2008 after The
Conference Board’s index of  consumer confidence  increased in
February to the highest level in a year.  --Zhang Shidong. Editors: Darren Boey, Chan Tien Hin  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
