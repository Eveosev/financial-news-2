Boston Properties Inc. (BXP)  agreed to buy
 Bank of America Corp. ’s skyscraper at 100 Federal St. in  Boston 
for $615 million, which would add to a portfolio that already
includes the city’s Hancock Tower and Prudential Center.  The company made a $25 million deposit as part of a
contract that it completed on Feb. 16, it said in an annual
report filed today with the U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission. The  deal  is subject to “customary closing
conditions,” Boston Properties said.  Bank of America, the second largest U.S. lender by assets,
is weighing the sale of all its corporate-owned offices except
for its  North Carolina  and New York City headquarters buildings,
as a cost-cutting move. The company said it will lease back
space in properties it sells.  The Boston tower, which bulges out from its base, is 37
stories tall and has 1.3 million square feet (121,000 square
meters) of rentable office space, according to the Boston
Properties filing.  Arista Joyner, a Boston Properties spokeswoman, declined to
comment beyond the filing.  Scott Silvestri , a Bank of America
spokesman, didn’t immediately return a telephone call seeking
comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
