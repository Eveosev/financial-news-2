Spanish inflation eased for a fourth
month in February as the euro area’s fourth-largest economy
shrinks and high unemployment curbs demand.  Consumer prices , based on European Union calculations, rose
1.9 percent from a year earlier after a 2 percent increase in
January, the  National Statistics Institute  in Madrid said today.
Economists had expected a gain of 1.9 percent, according to the
median of 12 forecasts in a Bloomberg News survey.  Prime Minister  Mariano Rajoy , in power since December, is
trying to convince investors and voters he can overhaul the
economy and implement the deepest budget cuts in at least three
decades amid a contracting economy.  Spanish gross domestic product may fall more in the first
quarter than in the last three months of 2011, when it declined
0.3 percent, Deputy Economy Minister Fernando Jimenez Latorre
said on Feb. 16. The  unemployment rate  was 22.9 percent in
December, according to EU data.  The government expects inflation to slow to 1 percent this
year, it said on Dec. 30. The European Commission has forecast
that Spanish consumer-price growth will ease to 1.3 percent this
year from 3.1 percent in 2011.  To contact the reporter on this story:
