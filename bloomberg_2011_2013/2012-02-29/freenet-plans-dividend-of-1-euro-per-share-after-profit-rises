Freenet AG (FNTN) ,  Germany ’s biggest non-
network telecommunications company, proposed to pay a dividend
for last year of 1 euro per share after profit increased.  Group earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and
amortization rose to 337.4 million euros ($450 million) in 2011
from 334.9 million euros a year earlier, the Buedelsdorf,
Germany-based company said in a statement today. Restructuring-
related one-off items declined to 22.9 million euros from 31.6
million euros in 2010.  Freenet, which buys access to wireless networks from
operators like  Deutsche Telekom AG (DTE)  and  Vodafone Group Plc (VOD) , aims
to “stabilize” revenue in the coming two years at the level
seen in 2011 while Ebitda is likely to be about 340 million
euros for 2012 and 2013, the company said. The company plans to
continue paying out 40 percent to 60 percent of its free  cash
flow  as dividends.  “From today´s perspective, the company assumes a stable
development of its customer base in 2012, and expects slight
growth in 2013,” Freenet said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
