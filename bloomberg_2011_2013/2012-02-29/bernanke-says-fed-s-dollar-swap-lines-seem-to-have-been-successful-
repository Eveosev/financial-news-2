Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S.
Bernanke  said that financial stresses appear to have eased after
the U.S. central bank cut the rate on swap lines with its
counterparts in other countries.  “The swap lines seem to have been very successful,”
Bernanke said in response to questions during testimony today to
the House Financial Services Committee. “It looks at this point
like the demand for those swaps is starting to go down.”  Bernanke said that if  Europe  had a “major financial
accident,” the  U.S. may be affected through “general
contagion, flight from risk-taking, loss of faith in the
financial system, economic stress and so on” rather than
direct losses at U.S. banks from holdings of European sovereign
debt.  To contact the reporter on this story:
