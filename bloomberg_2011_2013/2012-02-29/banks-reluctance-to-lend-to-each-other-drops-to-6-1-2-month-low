A measure of European banks’
reluctance to lend to one another held near the lowest level in
six months as the  European Central Bank  allotted a second round
of three-year crisis loans to financial firms.  The Euribor-OIS spread, the difference between the euro
interbank offered rate and overnight indexed swaps, was 64 basis
points at 12:10 p.m. in London, data compiled by Bloomberg show.
That’s the lowest since Aug. 31 and down from 97 basis points at
the start of the year.  The money-market gauge has fallen for three consecutive
months after the ECB’s first so-called longer-term refinancing
operation fuelled a credit-market rally and boosted confidence
in  Europe ’s banking sector. The Frankfurt-based bank allotted
529.5 billion euros ($712 billion) in its second LTRO today,
more than the 470 billion euros predicted by economists in a
Bloomberg News survey.  The rate banks pay to convert euro interest payments into
dollars fell to the lowest in seven months. The three-month
cross-currency  basis swap  was 67 basis points below Euribor, the
lowest since Aug. 5, from minus 69 yesterday. The measure was
114 below Euribor at the start of the year.  The one-year basis swap was little changed at 57 basis
points less than Euribor. A basis point is 0.01 percentage
point.  Lenders increased  overnight deposits  at the ECB yesterday,
placing 481 billion euros with the central bank, up from 475
billion euros on Feb. 27.  Three-month Euribor, the rate banks say they pay for three-
month loans in euros, fell to 0.983 percent from 0.991 percent.
One-week Euribor fell to 0.357 percent from 0.360 percent.  The London interbank offered rate, or Libor, for three-
month dollar loans fell to 0.484 percent from 0.488 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
