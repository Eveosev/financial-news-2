Nokia Siemens Networks, the joint
venture of  Nokia Oyj (NOK1V)  and Siemens AG, ended a service deal
with Oi in Brazil, resulting in 3,500 job cuts on top of
17,000 already announced.  Most of the employees involved have left the company, Ben Roome, a spokesman for Nokia Siemens, said by e-mail. Reuters
reported the news earlier today.  Nokia Siemens announced a five-year field maintenance deal
with Oi, the telephone services brand of  Telemar Norte Leste SA (TMAR5) ,
in 2009, taking on  about 3,000  Oi and third-party employees. The
company is cutting about 17,000 jobs in its main businesses as
it pares business lines to focus on mobile broadband equipment
and related services.  “The exit obviously contributes to our focus and cost-
reduction plans,” Roome said. It doesn’t affect the company’s
 Sao Paulo  global network operations center, he added.  To contact the reporter on this story:
