Cia. Hering (HGTX3) ’s fourth-quarter
earnings beat analysts’ estimates as the company opened more
stores than expected, boosting sales.  Net income rose 4.4 percent to 105.2 million reais ($61.3
million) from 100.8 million reais a year earlier, the Blumenau-
based company said today in a statement sent to the website of
 Brazil ’s securities regulator. The result was above the 95.23
million reais average estimate for adjusted net income of nine
analysts compiled by Bloomberg.  Hering’s same-store sales increased 8.1 percent in the last
three months of 2011 from a year earlier, according to
preliminary results released by the company Jan. 9. While that
was the third straight quarterly slowdown, it exceeded the 5
percent expansion Banco Santander SA had forecast and is
“probably the strongest growth rate among Brazilian apparel
retailers,” analysts including Tobias Stingelin wrote in a note
to clients on Jan. 10.  Same-store sales increased 13 percent in 2011 and the
company finished the year with 432 stores after opening 85 new
ones, 14 more than initially expected, the company said in its
statement today. Hering plans to open a total of 95 stores this
year, including 20 Hering Kids stores. The company said on Jan.
9 it may open as many as 200 to 250 youth-targeted locations.
That could add as much as 3 reais a share to the stock,
according to Santander’s note.  Hering  rose  1.3 percent to 46.19 reais today in  Sao Paulo 
trading. The stock is up 42 percent since the beginning of the
year, compared to a 16 percent jump in the  Bovespa (IBOV)  benchmark
index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
