Centrais Eletricas Brasileiras SA (ELET6) 
may help bail out  Rede Energia SA (REDE4)  should the government request
it to do so, Reuters said, citing the chief executive officer of
the state-controlled utility known as Eletrobras.  The problems faced by debt-laden Rede Energia may have a
wider impact on society and the economy, Reuters cited Jose
Carvalho Neto, the CEO of Eletrobras, as saying, after Centrais
Eletricas do Para, a unit of  Rede Energia, (REDE3)  filed for  bankruptcy
protection .  To contact the reporter on this story:
