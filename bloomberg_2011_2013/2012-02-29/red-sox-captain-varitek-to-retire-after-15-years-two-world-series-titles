(Corrects that Varitek was drafted by Mariners in third
paragraph).  Boston  Red Sox  captain  Jason Varitek 
is retiring from Major League Baseball after 15 seasons and two
World Series championships.  The 39-year-old catcher will make his announcement tomorrow
evening at the team’s spring training facility in Fort Myers,
Florida, the Red Sox announced today in an e-mailed release.
Varitek, the team’s captain from 2005 through last season, is
the only player in MLB history to catch four no-hitters.  A native of Rochester, Michigan, Varitek was drafted by the
Seattle Mariners in 1994 and made his major-league debut three
years later with the Red Sox. He batted .256 with 193 home runs
and 757 runs batted in during his major-league career, spent
entirely in  Boston .  A three-time All-Star and a Gold Glove winner for defense
in 2005, Varitek won World Series titles with the team in 2004
and 2007. He caught no-hitters thrown by Hideo Nomo in 2001,
 Derek Lowe  in 2002, Clay Buchholz in 2007 and Jon Lester in
2008.  To contact the reporter on this story:
