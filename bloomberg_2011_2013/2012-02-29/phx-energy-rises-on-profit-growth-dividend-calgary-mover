PHX Energy Services Corp. (PHX)  rose the
most in three years after the Canadian oil and natural-gas
drilling company said profit last year reached a record and
boosted its dividend.  PHX Energy rose 11 percent to C$11.02 at 1:40 p.m. in
Toronto. Earlier, the Calgary-based company jumped 13 percent,
the biggest intraday gain since Feb. 25, 2009.  Earnings before interest, depreciation and amortization
increased 79 percent in 2011 to C$45 million ($45.5 million)
helped by a “robust” demand for drilling in  North America , the
company said in a statement after the close of regular trading
yesterday.  The company also boosted its dividend 50 percent for this
year to 72 cents a share from 48 cents, according to the
statement.  PHX Energy plans to expand this year with projects in
Russia, Albania and  Colombia , the company said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
