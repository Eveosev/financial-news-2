Banca Comerciala Romana SA,
 Romania ’s largest bank by assets, said its 2011 profit dropped
85 percent from a year earlier, citing growing bad-loan
provisions amid faltering economic recovery.  Net income dropped to 71 million lei ($22 million) from 468
million lei a year earlier, the Bucharest-based bank, also known
as BCR, said today in an e-mailed statement. Net-interest
income, or the difference between money paid on deposits and
earnings on loans, fell about 16 percent to 3.13 billion lei
from 3.75 billion because of “low eligible loan demand.”  Romania’s banking industry, including BCR and its main
rival  BRD-Groupe Societe Generale (BRD)  SA, have been hit over the
past two years by the European debt crisis, which forced the
government to cut wages and spending and raise taxes. These
actions eroded people’s income and reduced loan repayments.  Last year was difficult “as the economic recovery was
slowing in the second half, beyond expectations,” BCR chief
executive officer Dominic Bruynseels said in the statement.
“This is affecting the business and income of our customers and
therefore had a negative impact on their transactions with
BCR.”  BCR’s bad-loan costs grew 7.9 percent in 2011 to 2.15
billion lei from about 2 billion lei a year earlier, according
to the statement. Bad loans stood at 20.6 percent of total
lending at the end of last year.  BCR, majority-owned by  Erste Group Bank AG (EBS) , posted net
income of 2 million lei in the fourth quarter compared with a
net loss of 90 million lei in the third quarter “mainly due to
a decrease in quarter-on-quarter provisions,” it said.  The bank’s total assets grew 4.3 percent to 76.75 billion
lei in 2011 from 73.6 billion lei at the end of 2010.  To contact the reporter on this story:
