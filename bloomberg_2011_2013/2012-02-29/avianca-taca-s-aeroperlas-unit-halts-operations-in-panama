Aeroperlas, a  Panama  City-based unit
of  Avianca Taca Holding SA (PFAVTA) , said it has ceased operations in
Panama.  “The airline regrets to announce the decision to cease
operations in Panama,” the domestic carrier said in a  statement 
on its website. The decision was caused by “market conditions
and the business model of the airline,” the company said.  The airline didn’t give further details. Press officials at
Bogota-based Avianca Taca didn’t immediately respond to phone
calls and e-mails seeking comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
