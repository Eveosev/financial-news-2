Japan  bought 1,500 metric tons of
feed barley today through a tender system introduced to loosen
government grain-import controls, according to the Ministry of
Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries.  Shipment must be made by May 31, Masafumi Otsuka at the
ministry’s grain-trade division said today by phone. A breakdown
of the countries of origin wasn’t available, he said.  The ministry, which holds feed-grain import tenders every
Wednesday, plans to hold its next tender on March 7. The tender
is held under the so-called simultaneous buy-and-sell system.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
