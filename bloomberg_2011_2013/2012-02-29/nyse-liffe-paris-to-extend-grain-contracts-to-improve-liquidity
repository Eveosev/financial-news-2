NYSE Liffe in Paris will begin
offering grain contracts that expire as far out as January 2015
to improve commercial users’ ability to hedge prices, the
exchange said.  Wheat, barley, corn and rapeseed contracts will all be
extended beyond their current 2013 expiration dates, said
Nicholas Kennedy, head of business development for commodity
derivatives for NYSE Liffe. The change will take effect on March
13. The August wheat and barley contracts will be eliminated
after they expire this year, he said by phone today.  “We know from regular discussions with the users of the
contracts that they were looking for hedging tools going out
further,” Kennedy said. “From a commercial perspective you can
hedge out to an extra crop year, which they couldn’t do.”  The August contract for wheat traditionally had little
volume and wasn’t needed, Kennedy said. The August 2012 contract
had 31 trades today compared with 84,182 for May and 85,313 for
November, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
