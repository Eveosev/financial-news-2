GenOn Energy Inc. (GEN) , the third-largest
U.S. independent power producer by market value, expects to shut
about 13 percent of its generating capacity by May 2015 because
of environmental regulations.  Shutdowns will begin in June at the units, which don’t
generate enough profit to cover the costs of complying with the
rules, Houston-based GenOn said today in a statement. The
plants, located at eight sites in Pennsylvania, Ohio and  New
Jersey , generate 3,140 megawatts in the wholesale market
overseen by PJM Interconnection. Except for one unit, all of the
plants burn coal, according to GenOn’s  website .  GenOn joins other power-plant owners, including  FirstEnergy
Corp. (FE)  and American Electric Power Co., that have announced
closures because of environmental rules. A U.S. Environmental
Protection Agency air-pollution rule to reduce power-plant
emissions that cross state lines was halted by a federal court
last year. Separate regulations to cut mercury pollution are
scheduled to go into effect in 2015.  GenOn will have 19,490 megawatts of generating capacity
after these and other announced closures and completion of a
gas-fueled plant in California. Total current capacity is 23,692
megawatts, according to the company’s website.  The announcement was made before regular trading began on
U.S. markets. GenOn fell 5.7 percent to $2.30 yesterday in New
York.  Calpine Corp. (CPN)  and  NRG Energy Inc. (NRG)  are the largest U.S.
independent power producers by market value. Independent power
producers generate electricity without a utility unit, which has
its rates set by local regulators.  To contact the reporter on this story:
