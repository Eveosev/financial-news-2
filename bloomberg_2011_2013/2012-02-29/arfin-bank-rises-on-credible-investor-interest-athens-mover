Marfin Popular Bank Pcl (MARFB) , the second-
largest lender in Cyprus, surged in Athens trading after the
bank said it received approaches from “credible” strategic
investors to help the firm meet capital requirements.  Marfin Bank rose 22 percent to 29.5 euro cents at 1:23
p.m., its biggest intraday gain since Aug. 29.  The company made the comment in a filing to the Athens
bourse today after a report in Politis newspaper said that
 Russia ’s  VTB Bank OJSC (VTBR)  is in talks with the lender.  Marfin reported today a 3.3 billion-euro ($4.4 billion)
loss for 2011 after writing down its holdings of Greek bonds.
The bank said it needs to raise 1.35 billion euros to comply
with the required Core Tier 1 capital ratio of 9 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
