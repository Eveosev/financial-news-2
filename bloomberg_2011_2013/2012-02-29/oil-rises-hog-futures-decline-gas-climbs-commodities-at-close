10 percent in the past year.  NATURAL GAS  OIL PRODUCTS  The premium of gasoil, or diesel, to Asian marker Dubai
crude slid 3 cents to $14.90 a barrel at 11:30 a.m.  Singapore 
time, according to data from PVM Oil Associates Ltd., a broker.
This crack spread, a measure of refining profit, is the
narrowest since Jan. 11. It is down 20 percent so far in
February, the most since April 2009.  Naphtha’s premium to London-traded Brent crude futures fell
$18.45 to $127.80 a metric ton, according to data compiled by

percent, to $1,048 a ton, based on PVM data. The petrochemical
feedstock is down for a second day, the longest losing streak in
four weeks.  PRECIOUS METALS  Gold climbed to the highest level in more than three months
as investors sought alternatives to a weaker dollar before the

lenders. Silver reached a five-month high.  Spot gold  rose as much as 0.4 percent to $1,790.57 an
ounce, the most expensive since Nov. 14, and was at $1,787.25 at

percent this month and 14 percent this year. The Comex May
contract climbed 0.4 percent to $3.936 per pound.  GRAINS, SOFT COMMODITIES  Palm oil  headed for the biggest monthly gain in more than a
year as lower output in  Malaysia  may pare stockpiles, while
increased tightness in global oilseed markets drives a rally in
soybeans, which produce a rival oil.  The May-delivery contract fell as much as 1.1 percent to
3,260 ringgit ($1,087) a metric ton on the Malaysia Derivatives
Exchange, before trading at 3,262 ringgit at 11:44 a.m. in  Kuala
Lumpur . The drop snapped a four-day rally that saw prices reach
the highest since June 9, while paring the monthly advance to 6
percent. That’s still the best performance since December 2010.
Soybeans were headed for the biggest monthly advance in more
than a year on signs of a second global annual shortage as
drought wilted crops in Brazil and  Argentina .  The May-delivery contract was little changed at $13.115 a
bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade at 3:27 p.m. in Singapore,

percent gain this month, the most since December 2010.  Corn for May delivery  was little changed at $6.57 a
bushel, trimming the monthly gain for the most-active contract

dropping to 85.64 cents a pound yesterday, U.S. Department of
Agriculture data show.  Hog futures for April settlement fell 0.7 percent to settle
