Western  Australia  will impose a 2.5
percent royalty on rare earth production as part of changes to
the state’s mining regulations.  The royalty was included in its Feb. 24 amendment to the
1978 mining act, according to a statement on the West Australian
government  website .  Lynas Corp., which produces rare earths from its Mount Weld
mine in the state, may be liable for about A$17 million ($18
million) a year in royalty payments as a result of the
regulation, the Australian Financial Review reported today.
Lynas wasn’t immediately available to comment, according to Alan
Jury, an external spokesman for the company who works for FTI
Consulting.  To contact the reporter on this story:
