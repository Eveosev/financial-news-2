Kazakhstan  may construct the
country’s fourth oil refinery within the framework of the
Kashagan development in the Caspian Sea, Prime Minister Karim Massimov said.  “We are returning to the issue of building a fourth
refinery in Kazakhstan so that we can be 100 percent sure that
we will be physically independent in energy terms,” Massimov
said today in an address to parliament in the capital, Astana.  The Kashagan field, one of the world’s largest, is expected
to begin producing in 2013, Deputy Oil Minister Lyazzat Kiinov
said in December, before he was appointed as head of KazMunaiGaz
National Co. The company will raise $4 billion from the
country’s National Oil Fund through bond sales to develop the
field, President Nursultan Nazarbayev’s press office said today.  KazMunaiGaz,  Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) ,  Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA) ,  Eni
SpA (ENI)  and  Total SA (FP)  each hold a 16.8 percent stake in the field,
according to the website of the North Caspian Operating Co.,
which manages the project.  ConocoPhillips (COP)  holds 8.4 percent and
Japan’s  Inpex Corp. (1605)  has 7.56 percent.  Kazakhstan will raise oil production to 90 million metric
tons a year by 2015 and to 120 million by 2020 from 81 million
currently, Oil and Gas Minister Sauat Mynbayev said today during
the parliament meeting.  “This increase is mostly connected with existing contracts
such as TengizChevroil and especially Kashagan,” he said,
adding that Kazakhstan will have enough oil sources to produce
at an annual level of 120 million to 130 million tons for the
next 40 to 45 years.  Crude oil and gas condensate output reached 80.1 million
tons last year, less than planned by the government and an
increase of 5 percent from 2010, the oil and gas ministry said
on Feb. 2.  To contact the reporter on this story:
