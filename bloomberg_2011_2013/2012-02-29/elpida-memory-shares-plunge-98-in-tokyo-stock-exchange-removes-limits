Elpida Memory Inc. (6665) , which has filed
for Japan’s biggest bankruptcy protection in two years, plunged
97 percent after the  Tokyo  stock exchange removed daily limits.  The stock fell 247 yen to 7 yen after dropping to as low as
4 yen at the close of trading on the Tokyo Stock Exchange.
Elpida’s 0.5 percent convertible bond due October 2015 plunged
60 yen to 14 yen per face value of 100 in Tokyo as of 4:56 p.m.
from Feb. 27, according to Barclays Plc.  The last Japanese maker of computer-memory chips, which
lost money for five straight quarters, sought protection at the
Tokyo District Court on Feb. 27 with  liabilities  of 448 billion
yen ($5.5 billion), according to a filing with  Japan ’s finance
ministry.  Elpida’s woes  came as the Tokyo-based company failed
to mimic  South Korea ’s  Samsung Electronics Co. (005930)  in diversifying
into specialty memory needed in mobile handheld devices such as
 Apple Inc. (AAPL) ’s iPad and iPhone.  “Elpida’s shares are worth zero after the delisting
announcement,”  Mitsushige Akino , who oversees about $600
million in Tokyo at Ichiyoshi Investment Management Co., said by
phone today.  The Tokyo Stock Exchange will apply regular daily trading
limits to Elpida shares from tomorrow. The bourse had yesterday
removed limits on how far the stock could move in a day.  Elpida’s rivals in South Korea advanced. Samsung rose 1.8
percent to 1.2 million won in  Seoul  and  Hynix Semiconductor Inc. (000660) 
added 1.2 percent to 30,200 won.  Micron Technology Inc. (MU) , the
Boise, Idaho-based chipmaker that will probably emerge as the
top winner from Elpida’s bankruptcy filing, rose 3.7 percent to
$8.88 in  New York  yesterday.  Elpida President Yukio Sakamoto met with creditors in Tokyo
today to explain bankruptcy procedures, including drawing up
revival plans.  DRAM Prices  Elpida, Hynix and other makers of DRAM chips lost a
combined $14 billion in the past three years, according to
Bloomberg calculations.  Troubles at Elpida were exacerbated by DRAM prices falling
85 percent and a stronger yen that cuts overseas sales when
repatriated. Japan’s government and banks bailed out the  company 
in 2009 with 140 billion yen in financial aid and loans.  Elpida said it defaulted on six bonds as they came due for
redemption Feb. 27, according to a company statement. The face
value of the bonds totaled 138 billion yen, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  The supplier to companies such as Apple said earlier this
month it saw “uncertainty” over remaining in business because
it might not have the necessary financing. Elpida hadn’t been
able to reach a deal with the trade ministry, the  Development
Bank of Japan  and its main lenders over financing for 92 billion
yen in bonds and loans due by April, the company said Feb. 14.  Japan Airlines  Elpida’s bankruptcy would be the nation’s biggest since
 Japan Airlines Corp. (9205)  sought protection in January 2010 with 2.32
trillion yen in liabilities, according to data from Tokyo Shoko
Research. Elpida employed 5,898 people as of March 31, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Bondholders of the chipmaker may salvage more cash than
investors in Japan Air.  The recovery rate for the failed chipmaker’s notes would be
about 19 percent, according to Bank of America Corp. Deutsche
Bank AG predicts between 10 percent and 20 percent, compared
with 12.5 percent for the airline that emerged from  bankruptcy
protection  in March 2011.  Elpida got 140 billion yen in financial aid and loans from
the government and banks in 2009 after falling chip prices
caused it to post a record loss.  DRAM prices plunged to a record low last year after PC
shipments missed analyst forecasts and sales of Apple’s iPad
surged. The price of the benchmark DDR3 2-gigabit DRAM declined
to a record 71 cents in November, compared with $4.85 on Sept.
1, 2010, amid slowing PC sales, according to Taipei-based
DRAMeXchange,  Asia ’s biggest spot market for the chips.  DRAM is the most common chip in computers. Samsung
controlled 38 percent of the market by revenue last year,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg Industries. Hynix held a
25 percent share and Elpida 18 percent.  To contact the reporter on the story:
