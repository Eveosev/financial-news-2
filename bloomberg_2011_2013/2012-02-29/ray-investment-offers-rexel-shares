Ray Investment SARL, the largest
investor in  Rexel SA (RXL) , is seeking as much as 483 million euros
($644 million) in its sale of a stake in the French electrical
equipment distributor, said a person familiar with the process.  The range is 15.75 euros to 16.10 euros a share, said the
person, who declined to be identified as the terms are private.
The mid-point of that price range is 3.7 percent less than
Rexel’s 16.55 euro closing price in French  trading  today. The
sale may be completed as early as tonight, the person said.  Ray is selling 30 million shares, or about 11 percent of
the Paris-based company, and expects to hold about 60 percent of
the  voting rights  following the sale, according to a statement
today. Deutsche Bank AG is managing the sale.  Ray’s shareholders include funds controlled by Clayton
Dubilier & Rice Inc. and Caisse de Depot et Placement du Quebec.
Rexel announced plans this month to reduce branches and staff in
Spain and Italy as a result of  Europe ’s sovereign debt crisis.  Rexel said a spokesman wasn’t available outside of regular
business hours. A Deutsche Bank spokesman in  New York  declined
to comment.  To contact the reporters on this story:
