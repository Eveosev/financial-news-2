Caterpillar Inc. (CAT)  expects Latin
American demand for mining equipment to outpace other regions in
the next two to three years as the Chinese economy recovers from
a slowdown, Chief Executive Officer  Doug Oberhelman  said.  Brazilian demand is growing 5 percent to 6 percent annually
as new mines and oil field development are planned in the
region’s biggest economy, Oberhelman told reporters in Santiago
today. He forecast a recovery in China and record global demand
this year.  “China is recovering a little bit and before the end of
the year we will see more activity” there, Oberhelman said in
comments that were translated from Spanish.  Caterpillar predicts the company’s total revenue in 2012
will surpass last year’s record of $60.1 billion, Oberhelman
said. The company has spent about $20 billion on capacity
expansions, research and development and  acquisitions  such as
Bucyrus International Inc. over the last two years, Chief
Financial Officer Ed Rapp said Feb. 2.  Chile and  Peru  will provide “significant” demand for
Caterpillar’s mining equipment division, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
