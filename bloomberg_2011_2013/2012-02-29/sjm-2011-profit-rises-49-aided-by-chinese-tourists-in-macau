SJM Holdings Ltd. (880) ,  Asia ’s biggest
casino company, said it’s in advanced talks with the Macau
government to build a new casino after 2011 profit rose 49
percent.  Net income climbed to HK$5.31 billion ($685 million), as
tourists from mainland  China  stoked gambling revenue in Macau,
the company said in a statement to Hong Kong’s stock exchange
today. That matched the HK$5.31 billion average of nine  analyst
estimates  compiled by Bloomberg.  The company joins  Sands China Ltd. (1928) ,  MGM China Holdings Ltd. (2282) 
and  Melco Crown Entertainment Ltd. (6883)  in reporting income gains
fueled by rising tourism to the former Portuguese colony, the
world’s biggest gambling hub and the only place in China where
it’s legal. SJM, founded by billionaire  Stanley Ho , has lost
market share as rivals open new  luxury resorts  in Macau, where
casino revenue jumped 35 percent to 25 billion patacas ($3.1
billion) in January and has tripled in the past four years.  “My concern remains with the falling market share,”  Kenny Tang , Hong Kong-based general manager of AMTD Financial Planning
Ltd., said today.  SJM “is still in talks and there’s no
concrete plan. It will take several years before it can build a
new casino.”  SJM will pay a final dividend of 43 Hong Kong cents a share
and a special dividend of 22 cents, compared with a final
dividend of 30 cents paid in 2011, the casino operator said.  Earnings per share rose to 95.4 cents from 66.2 cents a
year earlier, while gaming revenue gained 32 percent to HK$76
billion, the company said.  Falling Market Share  SJM, with casinos including Grand Lisboa and Ponte 16 on
Macau Peninsula, had a market share of 29 percent in the Macau
gambling market in 2011, it said today. It was down from 31.3
percent in 2010. Its market share may fall to 26.5 percent this
year, said Richard Huang, a Hong Kong-based analyst at CLSA
Asia-Pacific Markets.  Las Vegas Sands Corp. (LVS)  and  Galaxy Entertainment Group Ltd. (27) 
benefit from the increasing popularity of the city’s Cotai
strip, where they have integrated resorts. Galaxy opened a new
casino in Macau last year and Sands will have one opening this
year which gives them greater growth potential than SJM, Tang
said.  “Macau is a supply driven market, not demand driven,” he
said. “If you have new projects that will boost demand.”  SJM has applied to develop a 70,468-square-meter integrated
resort in Cotai which will include mass market and VIP gaming,
lodging, dining and entertainment. The project, which will take
several years to develop, is subject to government approvals,
the company said today.  New Casinos  Las Vegas Sands, through Hong Kong-listed unit Sands China,
is developing casino resorts in  Macau  to add to its existing
properties, the Venetian, Four Seasons and Sands.  The first phase of Sands Cotai Central, featuring three
hotels and two casinos, is on track to open in about eight
weeks, the company said on Feb. 2.  Galaxy opened Galaxy Macau resort last May which helped
almost triple its profit in the third quarter ended September.
It lifted the company’s market share to about 17 percent,
Chairman Lui Che-woo said in June. Huang from CLSA expects its
market share to increase to 18 percent this year.  SJM’s VIP gambling revenue climbed 36 percent to HK$52.8
billion during the year. Revenue at Casino Grand Lisboa
increased 46 percent and profit gained 41 percent, according to
the statement.  SJM rose 1.8 percent to HK$16.24 at the close in  Hong Kong 
trading before the earnings announcement. The stock climbed 28
percent this year, compared with a 17.6 percent gain on Hong
Kong’s benchmark Hang Seng Index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
