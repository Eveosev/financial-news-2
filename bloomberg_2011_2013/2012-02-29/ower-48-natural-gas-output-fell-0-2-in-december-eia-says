U.S. natural gas production  in the
lower 48 states fell 0.2 percent in December as output in
 Wyoming  declined, an Energy Department report today showed.  Output dropped to 72.54 billion cubic feet a day from a
revised 72.68 billion in November, the departmentâ€™s Energy
Information Administration said in the monthly EIA-914 report,
released at noon today in  Washington .  Total U.S. gas production dropped 0.3 percent to 82.52
billion cubic feet a day from a revised 82.77 billion.  Gas production in Wyoming slid 3.4 percent to 6.6 billion
cubic feet a day, dropping partly because of a fire at a
compressor station, the Energy Department said.  Output from states that include the Marcellus shale
formation in the U.S. Northeast rose 1.9 percent to 21.08
billion cubic feet a day. Louisiana production, which includes
gas from the Haynesville shale, decreased 1.5 percent to 8.95
billion cubic feet a day, the government said.  Texas production dropped 1 percent to 22.27 billion and
output from the  Gulf of Mexico  climbed 1.3 percent to 4.64
billion cubic feet a day.  Natural gas for April delivery rose 4.6 cents, or 1.8
percent, to $2.565 per million British thermal units at 12:43
p.m. on the  New York Mercantile Exchange . Gas futures have
gained 2.5 percent this month.  The EIA-914 report covers gas gross withdrawals, which
include gas used for repressuring, quantities vented and flared,
and non-hydrocarbon gas removed in treating or processing
operations.  To contact the reporter on this story:
