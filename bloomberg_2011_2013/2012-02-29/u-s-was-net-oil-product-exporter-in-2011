The U.S. exported more gasoline,
diesel and other fuels than it imported in 2011 for the first
time since 1949, the Energy Department said.  Shipments abroad of petroleum products exceeded imports by
439,000 barrels a day, the department said today in the
Petroleum Supply Monthly  report . In 2010, daily net imports 
averaged 269,000 barrels. U.S. refiners exported record amounts
of gasoline, heating oil and diesel to meet higher global fuel
demand while U.S. fuel consumption sank.  Oil demand in  Latin America  will climb 2.5 percent to 6.64
million barrels a day this year, while contracting 2.4 percent
in Europe and 0.5 percent in  North America , the Paris-based
 International Energy Agency  said Feb. 10.  Mexico ’s use of U.S.-
made gasoline was 44 percent higher last year than in 2010,
Energy Department data show.  “There’s stronger global demand for clean fuels and
stronger demand for fuel, outpacing production in places like
 South America ,” said  Sander Cohan , a global transportation
fuels analyst and principal with Energy Security Analysis Inc.
in Wakefield,  Massachusetts .  Gasoline futures for March delivery on the  New York
Mercantile Exchange  settled at $3.0423 a gallon today, up 11
percent in the past year. Heating oil was up 9 percent during
that period to $3.188 a gallon.  Distillate Exports  Distillate shipments rose 30 percent from a year earlier to
a record 854,000 barrels a day, and daily exports of finished
gasoline and blending components jumped 57 percent to 526,000
barrels in 2011.  Refiners are expanding on the Gulf Coast and in the
Midwest, even as unprofitable plants along the East Coast were
shut. Operable capacity in the U.S. climbed 0.8 percent to 17.7
million barrels a day in December from a year earlier.  U.S. refineries in the Gulf Coast, where about half of U.S.
capacity is located, operated at 88.8 percent last year, up from
88.6 percent in 2010.  “It helps keep refinery utilization rates up in this
country,”  Bill Day , a spokesman for  Valero Energy Corp. (VLO)  in San
Antonio, said in a telephone interview. “Otherwise we would see
what we’re seeing on the East Coast, where refineries are
shutting.”  In the fourth quarter, Valero, the largest U.S. independent
refiner with 14 North American plants, exported about 5 percent
of its gasoline output and 17 percent of its heating oil and
diesel production, Day said.  Export Forecast  The U.S. will ship abroad 350,000 barrels a day more
petroleum products that it imports in 2012 and 320,000 barrels
daily in 2013, according to the department’s Short-Term Energy
Outlook report released on Feb. 7.  Gasoline demand in the U.S. sank 2.9 percent to 8.736
million barrels a day last year as pump prices averaged $3.521 a
gallon, the highest in records dating back to 1919.  Total U.S. oil product demand fell 9.5 percent to 18.8
million barrels a day last year from 20.8 million in 2005,
department data show.  “The reason we can export so much is demand in the U.S. is
weak,” Cohan said. Since 2005, the U.S. has lost nearly 2
million barrels a day of total product consumption, he said.  Diesel Demand  Global demand for diesel is rising faster than for
gasoline, prompting refiners to increase yields of distillate
fuels. A barrel of crude refined in the U.S. yielded 31.2
percent distillate fuel in December, the most ever. Distillate
exports reached 1.13 million barrels a day during the month as
cold weather in  Europe  boosted demand. Shipments to the
Netherlands doubled, the data show.  “This year was one of the most mild winters on record in
the U.S. at a time when the winter weather in Europe was just
atrocious,” said  James Cordier , portfolio manager at
OptionSellers.com in Tampa,  Florida .  Total net crude and product imports fell 11 percent from a
year earlier to 8.436 million barrels a day, the lowest level
since 1995, department data showed. Domestic oil output rose 3.6
percent to 5.673 million barrels a day, an eight-year high.  To contact the reporter on this story:
