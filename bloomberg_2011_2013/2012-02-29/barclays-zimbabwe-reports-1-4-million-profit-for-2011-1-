Barclays Bank of Zimbabwe Ltd (BARC) .
reported a profit of $1.4 million for 2011 after a loss the
previous year, Chief Financial Officer Sam Matsekete said.  The bank received $7.7 million  in “special support” from
main owner  Barclays Bank Plc (BARC)  during the year to cover the
expenses of a restructuring exercise, Matsekete told reporters
in Harare, the capital.  The bank has targeted 14 percent growth in 2012 and plans
to increase its customer base by 6 percent, from 155,000
customers, Managing Director George Guvamatanga said.  Barclays is one of three foreign-controlled banks that may
soon be forced to cede a percentage of shares to black
Zimbabweans under the country’s Indigenization and Empowerment
Act. Negotiations are under way between banks, the  finance
ministry , the central bank and Indigenization Minister Saviour
Kasukuwere.  “After 100 years of operations in Zimbabwe, we don’t see
ourselves as a foreign bank, but there have been various
engagements with the indigenization ministry and those
discussions continue,” Guvamatanga said, adding that he
believed an “amicable” solution would be found.  The law may also affect London-based  Standard Chartered
Plc (STAN) , and Johannesburg-based  Standard Bank Group Ltd (SBK) .  To contact the reporter on this story:
