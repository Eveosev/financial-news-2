Colombia ’s peso erased earlier gains
after Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke ’s remarks to
Congress damped speculation of more quantitative easing to
bolster the world’s largest economy.  The peso was little changed at 1,767.70 per  U.S. dollar  at
11:49 a.m. in Bogota, from 1,767.35 yesterday when it touched
1,762.07, the strongest intraday level since Aug. 2. The
currency has advanced 11 percent in the past three months, the
second-best performer after the South African rand among 25
emerging-market currencies tracked by Bloomberg.  Bernanke’s testimony today to the House Financial Services
Committee in  Washington  indicates that recent signs of strength
in the  U.S. economy  won’t change the Fed’s view that
“exceptionally low”  interest rates  are likely to be warranted
at least through late 2014. At the same time, Bernanke gave no
signal that additional policy easing is under consideration.  “Bernanke’s comments are impregnating the market with risk
aversion,” said Nicolas Bernal, an analyst at Ultrabursatiles
SA brokerage in Bogota.  The Colombian currency strengthened earlier on speculation
investment flows will increase into the South American country
after the  European Central Bank  provided lenders with a larger
amount of cash than economists forecast. The ECB allotted 529.5
billion euros ($708 billion) in three-year funds. Economists
predicted 470 billion euros, a Bloomberg survey showed.  In a bid to ease gains in the peso, Colombia’s central bank
said Feb. 24 it will extend a program of daily purchases of a
minimum of $20 million to at least Aug. 4, from the initially
announced minimum three-month period.  While Banco de la Republica’s dollar purchases are helping
stem some of the peso’s gains, the trend for a stronger peso
continues, said Bernal. Should the peso strengthen beyond 1,764,
it will likely rise towards 1,745, he said.  The yield on the government’s 10 percent peso bonds due
July 2024 rose one basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, to
7.34 percent, according to the central bank. The price fell
0.122 centavo to 121.103 centavos per peso.  To contact the reporter on this story:
