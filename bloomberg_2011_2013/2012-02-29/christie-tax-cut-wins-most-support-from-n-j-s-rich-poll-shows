Support for Governor  Chris Christie ’s proposed 10 percent income-tax cut is highest among
wealthier New Jerseyans, a  Quinnipiac University (78104MF)  poll shows.  Registered voters back the plan, 56 percent to 33 percent,
according to the survey released today. Support rises with
earnings from 49 percent among those in households making less
than $30,000 a year to 60 percent from those exceeding $100,000.  The first-term Republican proposed the rate rollback as
part of his $32.1 billion fiscal 2013 budget. An analysis by
Assembly Democrats showed that the wealthiest residents would
gain the most. New Jersey had the third-highest per-capita
income in the U.S., at $51,167 in 2010, trailing only
Connecticut and  Massachusetts , according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  “No sooner did Christie propose his 10 percent income-tax
cut than legislative Democrats denounced it,”  Maurice Carroll ,
director of the Quinnipiac University Polling Institute, said in
a statement. “But -- so far -- he wins with the voters. Even
nonmillionaires think the plan is fair.”  The survey also gauged support for President Barack Obama’s
re-election campaign among Garden State voters, with 49 percent
favoring the Illinois Democrat over 39 percent for  Mitt Romney ,
the Republican former Massachusetts governor. The gap narrowed
to 49 percent to 43 percent when Christie, 49, was named as a
Romney running mate.  No 2012 Run  Christie said in October that he wouldn’t seek his party’s
presidential nomination, and has scoffed publicly at suggestions
he might be a vice presidential candidate.  “Putting him on the ticket helps the Republicans a little,
but not enough, in  New Jersey ,” Carroll said in the statement.
“If the measure of a vice presidential pick is carrying his or
her home state, then Governor Christie comes up short.”  The survey also showed former Republican Pennsylvania
Senator  Rick Santorum  losing to Obama 52 percent to 34 percent.  Poll takers surveyed 1,396 registered voters by telephone
Feb. 21-27. The general results have a margin of error of plus
or minus 2.6 percentage points.  Respondents approve of Christie’s job performance 55
percent to 38 percent, close to his high of 58 percent in
October, according to the poll.  “Voters continue to give the gov good marks on how he’s
doing his job in Trenton,” Carroll said in the statement.  Wealthy State  Under Christie’s tax-cut proposal, couples making $500,000
a year would save almost $2,781, while those bringing home
$30,000 would pay about $45 less, according to the analysis by
legislative Democrats. The governor’s budget counts on a 7.3
percent gain in revenue, the most since before the recession
began in December 2007.  The spending plan is structurally unbalanced because it is
built on “optimistic” growth projections, according to a Feb.
24 report from  Standard & Poor’s . The budget also would spend
$288 million from reserve funds and increases the reliance on
one-time revenue sources to $1.6 billion, the report said.  “We think S&P should learn from its own experience and
make more of an effort to avoid reaching premature
conclusions,” Treasurer Andrew Sidamon-Eristoff said in a
statement later the same day. “This governor has an unbroken
record of creating responsible, balanced budgets without tax
increases that have been built on solid, conservative revenue
estimates.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
