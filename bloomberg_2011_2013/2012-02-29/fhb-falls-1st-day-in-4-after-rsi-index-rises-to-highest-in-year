Foldhitel es Jelzalogbank Nyrt. , a
Hungarian mortgage lender known as FHB, fell for the first time
in four days as a technical indicator suggested the rally was
overdone.  The shares fell 1.2 percent to 579 forint by the close in
Budapest. FHB’s 3.5 percent jump yesterday pushed the stock’s
14-day  relative strength index  to 75, the highest in a year. A
reading above 70 indicates to some technical analysts a security
may decline. The RSI last stood at 71.  The company surged 25 percent this year compared with a 14
percent rise in  Hungary ’s BUX Index. FHB has rallied 6.6 percent
so far this week.  OTP Bank Nyrt., Hungary’s largest lender, today unveiled a
plan offering to fix the exchange rate on Swiss-franc
denominated municipality bond repayments for a three-year
period, Pal Kovacs, a managing director at the bank, said at a
press conference in Budapest today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
