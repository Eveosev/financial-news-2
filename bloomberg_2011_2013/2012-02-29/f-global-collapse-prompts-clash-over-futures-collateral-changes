(Corrects time element in second paragraph.)  CME Group Inc. (CME)  sparred with the
Vanguard Group Inc. and other derivatives buyers over whether
U.S. regulators should extend collateral-protection rules
designed for the swaps market to the futures industry following
the collapse of MF Global Holdings Ltd.  Speaking today at the opening of a two-day roundtable
organized by the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission,
derivatives buyers including Tudor Investment Corp. and  Fidelity
Investments  urged the commission to add the new collateral-
segregation standards to the futures market.  “We know it’s going to cost more. We know it might
increase margining. There are a bunch of buy-side participants
who are willing to pay more,” said John Torell, Tudor’s chief
financial officer.  Tim Doar, managing director at CME, the world largest
futures exchange, said the agency shouldn’t “rush to judgment”
with regulatory changes.  The CFTC, Securities and Exchange Commission and  Justice
Department  are investigating the collapse of MF Global. The New
York-based broker filed for bankruptcy last year and the trustee
overseeing the liquidation has estimated a $1.6-billion gap
between customer claims and the amount available to pay them.  The CFTC voted 4-1 in January to adopt final Dodd-Frank Act
regulations for the swaps market that would protect clients’
collateral if their broker defaults, while also allowing the
customer funds to be pooled before a bankruptcy. Regulators
should not move too quickly to put “a single customer
protection standard in place for these diverse markets,” Doar
said at the roundtable.  Oversight Recommendations  CFTC Chairman  Gary Gensler  has asked the agency’s staff to
develop recommendations for oversight of the futures markets’
system of self regulation. The roundtable is an early step
toward possible regulatory changes. “There will be significant
public input” on any changes to be proposed by the CFTC,
Gensler told lawmakers today at a House Agriculture Committee
hearing.  The review of regulatory ideas stemming from the MFGlobal
collapse may lead to recommendations for changes requiring
congressional action, according to a Jan. 26 letter from Jill E. Sommers, a Republican commissioner, to Senator  Pat Roberts , a
Kansas Republican. Sommers is overseeing the agency’s work on
the collapse of MF Global.  The Futures Industry Association, a Washington-based trade
group, recommended more rigorous reporting and internal controls
for brokerages following the MF Global collapse. Brokerages
should be required to submit daily reports of how much customer
money must be held separate from the firm’s own money to their
self-designated regulator, often a clearinghouse the firm uses,
the association said in a statement today.  The group, which represents the banks, brokerages and asset
managers active in the exchange-traded  derivatives market , also
recommended that firms file twice-monthly accounts of how
customer money is being invested.  To contact the reporter on this story:
