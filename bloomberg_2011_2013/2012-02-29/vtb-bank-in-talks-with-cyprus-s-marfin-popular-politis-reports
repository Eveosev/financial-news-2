Russia’s  VTB Bank OJSC (VTBR)  is in talks
with Marfin Popular Bank, Cyprus’s second-biggest lender,  which
is searching for strategic investors,  Politis  reported today,
without saying where it got the information.  The two countries’ supervisory authorities are aware of the
talks, which may lead to VTB taking control of Marfin Popular,
the Nicosia-based newspaper said.  -- Editor: Alan Purkiss  To contact the reporter on this story:
