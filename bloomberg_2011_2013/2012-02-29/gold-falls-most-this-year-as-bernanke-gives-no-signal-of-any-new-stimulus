Gold futures fell as much as $100 to
below $1,700 an ounce on signs that that the  Federal Reserve 
will refrain from offering more monetary stimulus to bolster the
U.S. economy.  In testimony before Congress today, Fed Chairman  Ben S.
Bernanke  gave no signal that the central bank will take new
steps to boost liquidity. The dollar rose as much as 0.8 percent
against a basket of major currencies, eroding the appeal of the
precious metal as an alternative investment. Yesterday, gold
reached $1,792.70, a three-month high, even as coin sales by the
U.S. mint slumped in February .  “People were expecting that the Fed would loosen policies,
even if the perception is that the economy is doing well,”
James Dailey, who manages $215 million at TEAM Financial
Management LLC in Harrisburg,  Pennsylvania , said in a telephone
interview. “The investor sentiment changed as the Fed committed
to nothing. This is the manic nature of the market.”  In electronic trading on the Comex in  New York , gold
futures for April delivery fell $90.30, or 5 percent, to
$1,698.10 at 5:14 p.m., compared with yesterday’s settlement.
Earlier, the price tumbled as much as $100, or 5.6 percent, to
$1,688.40, the lowest for a most-active contract since Jan. 25.  The settlement at the close of floor trading was $1,711.30,
down 4.3 percent, the most since Dec. 14. The price, down 1.7
percent this month, has gained 9.2 percent in 2012.  Bullish Bets  In the week ended Feb. 21,  hedge funds  and money managers
boosted bullish bets on gold futures by 9.9 percent to 179,132
contracts, the highest since Sept. 13, the latest government
data showed on Feb. 24.  Holdings in exchange-traded products backed by gold rose to
a record 2,403.2 metric tons today, according to  data  compiled
by Bloomberg. Assets increased 0.4 percent, the most since Jan.
27. The total reached an all-time high for the third time in
four sessions.  “Bernanke’s comments seem to have eliminated hopes of U.S.
quantitative easing coming anytime soon,”  William O’Neill , a
partner at Logic Advisors in  Upper Saddle River ,  New Jersey ,
said in a telephone interview after the Comex settlement.
“There were excessive net longs on hopes of more credit easing,
so the market was vulnerable to these kind of statements, and it
almost seemed as if Bernanke was trying to take the steam out of
the commodity market.”  Sales of gold coins by the U.S. mint tumbled 83 percent in
February to an estimated 21,000 ounces from January, data on the
Mint’s website showed today.  Inflation ‘Subdued’  The Fed chairman said today that the inflation outlook is
“subdued.” Gold had climbed this month as gasoline costs
jumped, spurring demand for the metal as a hedge against
increasing consumer prices.  Keeping monetary stimulus is warranted even as the
unemployment rate falls and rising crude-oil prices may cause
inflation to accelerate temporarily, Bernanke said.  The Fed said today in its Beige Book business survey that
the  U.S. economy  expanded at a “modest to moderate pace” in
January and early February, bolstered by manufacturing.  Total Comex volume was an estimated 342,701 contracts, the
highest since Jan. 27.  To contact the reporter on this story:
