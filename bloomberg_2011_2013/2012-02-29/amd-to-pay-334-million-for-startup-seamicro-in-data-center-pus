Advanced Micro Devices Inc. (AMD)  said it
will pay $334 million to buy SeaMicro Inc., a chip designer with
expertise in servers, adding technology that can help it compete
with  Intel Corp. (INTC)  in the market for data centers.  AMD will pay $281 million in cash and the remainder in
stock for Sunnyvale, California-based SeaMicro, AMD said in a
statement. SeaMicro Chief Executive Officer Andrew Feldman will
head a new AMD division that will target the market for
computers that run data centers, which help companies deliver
software and computing tasks over the Internet.  Through the acquisition, AMD gains SeaMicroâ€™s designs for
chips that link processors together in server computers, making
them simpler and more power efficient than standard models.  AMD fell 2.3 percent to $7.35 at the close in  New York .
That trimmed its year-to-date gains to 36 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
