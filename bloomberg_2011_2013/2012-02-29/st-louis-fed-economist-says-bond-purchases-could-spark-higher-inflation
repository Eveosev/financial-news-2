Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis
economist Daniel Thornton said the central bank’s asset
purchases, or quantitative easing, could spark higher  money
supply  growth that leads to a surge in inflation.  The Fed’s two rounds of asset purchases totaling $2.3
trillion have resulted in an “enormous increase” in excess
reserves, which “constitute an enormous potential to increase
the money supply as the economy improves and banks’
opportunities to lend and invest improve,” Thornton wrote in an
essay posted on the bank’s Website.  Fed Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  and central bank policy makers
have said the Fed can avoid an inflation surge by removing
accommodative policies at the right time and that inflation
results in part from rising expectations of the public rather
than money growth. The Fed has defined  price stability  as price
increases of 2 percent, and policy makers described inflation on
Jan. 25 as “subdued in recent months” with the public’s
expectations “stable.”  “While discussions of the money supply are nearly
nonexistent in modern monetary theory and policy, both economic
theory and historical experience suggest that a significant and
persistent expansion in the money supply will be associated with
a significant increase in the longer-run inflation rate,”
Thornton wrote.  “The recent acceleration in the growth of the money supply
is of particular concern because the year-over-year consumer
price index inflation for December 2011 is 3.0 percent,” or
more than the Fed’s target.  To contact the reporters on this story:
