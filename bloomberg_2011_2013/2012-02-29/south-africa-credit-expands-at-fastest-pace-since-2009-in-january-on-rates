South African credit expanded at the
fastest pace in more than 2 1/2 years in January, easing
pressure on the central bank to provide more stimulus to the
economy.  Borrowing (SACEIYY)  by households and businesses rose 7.3 percent
from a year earlier, up from a revised 6.1 percent in December,
the Pretoria-based  Reserve Bank  said on its website today. The
median  estimate  in a Bloomberg survey of 11 economists was 7.1
percent.  The central bank “must be heartened by the numbers coming
out this morning,”  Colen Garrow , an economist at Brait SA in
Johannesburg, said in a telephone interview. “The numbers seem
to be headed in the right direction.”  The central bank kept its benchmark interest rate at 5.5
percent last year to support  consumer spending  after a slump in
manufacturing and mining production. Economic growth accelerated
to an annualized 3.2 percent in the fourth quarter from a
revised 1.7 percent in the previous three months, as mining and
manufacturing rebounded.  The Reserve Bank gives the next monetary policy decision on
March 29.  The broad  M3 (SAMYM3Y)  measure of  money supply  rose 6.6 percent in
January from a year earlier, from 8.2 percent in December, the
central bank said. The median  estimate  in a Bloomberg survey was
8.6 percent.  The rand was little changed at 7.4703 per dollar at 8:30
a.m. Johannesburg time. The yield on the benchmark rand bond due
in 2015 fell 1 basis point, to 0.01 percentage point, to 6.64
percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
