The Polish zloty jumped to the
strongest level in almost seven months after euro-area financial
institutions sought to borrow a record amount from the  European
Central Bank .  The zloty advanced 0.5 percent to 4.1117 per euro as of
4:11 p.m. in Warsaw, the strongest level on a closing basis
since Aug. 8. It has appreciated 2.9 percent this month for the
steepest gain among 25 emerging-market currencies tracked by
Bloomberg.  The Frankfurt-based ECB said it will lend banks 529.5
billion euros ($712.2 billion) for 1,092 days, topping the 489
billion euros handed out to 523 institutions in the first three-
year operation in December. Using the longer-term refinancing
operations, banks can borrow from the ECB at around 1 percent
and invest the proceeds in higher-yielding securities.  To contact the reporter on this story:
