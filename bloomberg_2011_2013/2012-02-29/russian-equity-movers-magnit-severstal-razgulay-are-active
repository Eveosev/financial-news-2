traded 1.9 percent stronger at 3,652 rubles. Russia’s largest
food retailer by market value climbed ahead of an increase in
its weighting in the MSCI Russia gauge as the index provider
MSCI rebalanced the measure.  OAO Razgulay (GRAZ)  (GRAZ RX) surged 30 percent to 33.77 rubles,
the biggest gain since May 2009. Kommersant reported that VEB,
the state development bank, is in talks to acquire a 16.8

steel producer will buy back 17 percent of its shares for $2.2
billion, Kommersant reported, citing bankers it did not

necessary to redeem treasury shares created during the spinoff
of its Nordgold NV unit, according to the Russian newspaper.
Severstal plans to buy back 170 million shares at an average
price for the last four months’s trading, Kommersant reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
