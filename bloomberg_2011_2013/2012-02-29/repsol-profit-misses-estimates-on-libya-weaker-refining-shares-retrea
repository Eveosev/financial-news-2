Repsol YPF SA (REP) ,  Spain ’s biggest oil
company, said fourth-quarter profit fell more than analysts
predicted on lower output from  Libya  and weaker refining.  Net income, adjusted to exclude inventories and one-time
items, slid 29 percent from a year earlier to 355 million euros
($478 million), the company said today in  Madrid . The mean of 20
analyst estimates was for profit of 380.6 million euros.  Repsol is bolstering exploration to stem declines in
production, which slipped 14 percent in the fourth quarter from
a year earlier. The company is investing in  Brazil ’s offshore
 Santos Basin  and has sold off part of its interest in its YPF
unit to reduce dependence on mature fields in  Argentina .  “The fundamentals of the company remain solid,” Chief
Financial Officer Miguel Martinez said on a conference call.
“We expect this year to be better than 2011.”  Shares fell 4.8 percent to 19.57 euros, the lowest since
Oct. 4. Repsol is down 20 percent in the past year.  Repsol reported a reserve replacement ratio of 131 percent
for 2011, indicating it found more oil and gas than it produced
in the year. The ratio was 162 percent for the upstream unit and
112 percent for YPF in  Argentina . Output in Libya from wells
where Repsol has a stake is now at a gross level of about
300,000 barrels of oil equivalent a day, with Repsol’s share at
about 50,000 barrels, the company said.  Output to Rise  Repsol’s output was 299,000 barrels a day in 2011. That
will rise 12 percent to about 335,000 this year and the
exploration program will include as many as 24 wells, the
company said in a presentation to investors.  The company has reported discoveries in Brazil and  Sierra
Leone  this year. YPF said this month that its shale oil
resources probably hold almost half that of Brazil’s pre-salt
reserves, estimated at about 50 billion barrels.  Repsol is exploring in  Brazil  in a joint venture with China
Petrochemical Corp., known as Sinopec, which in 2010 invested
$7.1 billion in Repsol’s Brazilian unit. Repsol said today that
it’s sticking with longer-term targets for production growth of
4 percent a year.  Lower refining profit margins reduced income by 116 million
euros, the company said. Income for the refining unit dropped by
19 percent in the fourth quarter from a year earlier.  To contact the reporter on this story:
