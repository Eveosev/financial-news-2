available for immediate sale of an asset. The offer is the price
available for immediate purchase of an asset.  Current issues are the most recently issued securities, and
old issues are those sold previously with the same maturity.  Specific  Treasury securities  in the greatest demand are
considered to be “on special.” Firms that want to borrow them
are willing to lend money overnight at rates below those on
general collateral or other Treasuries in exchange for them.  Behind the Numbers  Securities firms use repos to borrow money to finance
positions in Treasury, corporate and mortgage-backed securities.
They also borrow securities on reverse repos to make deliveries
of sales of securities the dealers don’t own, and engage in
speculative repo trading based on expectations for the future
direction of  interest rates .  Current 5- and 10-year notes often trade at the lowest repo
rates because they are widely used as hedges against positions
in corporate, mortgage and global debt.  General Collateral  Delivery repos: 0.25 percent, unchanged. The collateral is
sent to an investor’s bank against receipt of funds.  Triparty repos: 0.28 percent, unchanged. A clearing bank
acts as a third party to make sure there’s adequate collateral
behind the repo and that it conforms throughout the life of the
transaction to the investor’s requirements, providing the
customer with an additional layer of safety.  Securities firms are willing to pay higher rates to borrow
money through triparty repos because they can allocate leftover
collateral remaining at their clearing bank late in the day as
backing for the transactions, saving on delivery costs.  Rates on general repos, or those backed by non-specific
collateral, are usually set slightly below federal funds levels.  Treasury Bills  The three- and six-month Treasury bills closed at 0.19
percent, down from 0.20 percent.  Federal Funds  Federal funds, the overnight interbank lending rate, was at
0.12 percent, within the  Federal Reserve ’s target range of zero
to 0.25 percent, according to ICAP.  To contact the reporter on this story:
