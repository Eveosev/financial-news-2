Ultra-low-sulfur diesel in  Chicago 
rose the most in almost a week after the Energy Department said
distillate inventories in the Midcontinent fell for the first
time in three weeks.  Distillate stocks  in Padd 2, which includes Chicago,
dropped 355,000 barrels to 32.9 million barrels in the week
ended Feb. 24, according to the Energy Department. Thatâ€™s the
lowest level since Jan. 6.  The discount for ultra-low-sulfur  diesel  in Chicago
narrowed 9 cents to 23 cents below heating-oil futures at 12:52
p.m. in  New York , according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
Prompt delivery rose 6.13 cents to $2.9614 a gallon.  The discount for conventional, 87-octane gasoline on the
 Gulf Coast (MOSGC87P)  narrowed 2.25 cents to 23.25 cents a gallon versus
futures. Prompt delivery fell 1.15 cents to $3.0032 a gallon.  The same fuel in  New York Harbor (MOSNY87P)  strengthened 1.37 cents to
a premium to futures of 2 cents a gallon.  To contact the reporter on this story:
