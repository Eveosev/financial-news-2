Blizzard Entertainment, maker of the
online game “World of Warcraft,” is cutting about 600 jobs.  About 90 percent of the firings will come from departments
not related to video-game development, the  Irvine , California-
based company, a unit of  Activision Blizzard Inc. (ATVI) , said in
statement today.  Activision reduced defections from “World of Warcraft” in
the fourth quarter after losing almost 1 million customers
during the third quarter. The number of paying subscribers fell
to 10.2 million at the end of 2011, the company said on Feb. 9.
The comparable figure a quarter earlier was 10.3 million.  “As Blizzard and the industry have evolved, we’ve also had
to make some difficult decisions in order to address the
changing needs of our company,” Mike Morhaime, Blizzard’s chief
executive officer, said in the statement.  Activision had 7,300 employees, including part-time workers,
at the end of 2011, according to a company filing yesterday.  The company this year plans to release “Diablo III” and
may release updates to other online games, Activision Blizzard
Chief Executive Officer Bobby Kotick said in February.  Activision’s shares were unchanged at $12.04 at 2:15 p.m. in
 New York .  To contact the reporter on this story:
