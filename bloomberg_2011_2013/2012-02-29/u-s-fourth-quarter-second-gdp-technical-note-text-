Following is the text of the
Gross Domestic Product from the Commerce Department.  Technical Note  Gross Domestic Product  Fourth Quarter of 2011 (Second Estimate)  February 29, 2012  This technical note provides background information about
the source data and estimating methods used to produce the
estimates presented in the GDP news release.  The complete
set of estimates for the fourth quarter is available on
BEA's Web site at www.bea.gov; a brief summary of
"highlights" is also posted on the Web site.  In a few
weeks, the estimates will be published in BEA's monthly
journal, the Survey of Current Business, along with a more
detailed analysis of the estimates ("GDP and the
Economy").  Sources of Revision to Real GDP  Real GDP increased 3.0 percent (annual rate) in the fourth
quarter, an upward revision of 0.2 percentage point from
the advance estimate.  The upward revision to real GDP
reflected an upward revision to nonresidential fixed
investment, a downward revision to imports, and an upward
revision to  consumer spending .  * The upward revision to nonresidential fixed investment
reflected an upward revision to nonresidential structures
that was based on newly available Census Bureau
construction spending data for December and revised data
for October and November.  * The downward revision to imports reflected a downward
revision to goods that was based on newly available Census
goods data for December and revised data for November.  * The upward revision to consumer spending was more than
accounted for by an upward revision to services. The
largest contributor to the revision was "other" services,
specifically cellular phone services, based on newly
available cellular telephone service provider revenue data
for the fourth quarter.  The  price index  for gross domestic purchases increased 1.1
percent in the fourth quarter, an upward revision of 0.3
percentage point.  This revision was mostly due to prices
for personal consumption expenditures and reflected
revised Bureau of Labor Statistics seasonally adjusted
consumer price indexes.  Revisions to Wages and Salaries and Disposable Personal
Income  In addition to presenting revised estimates for the fourth
quarter, today's release also presents revised estimates
of third-quarter wages and salaries, personal taxes, and
contributions for government social insurance.  Wage and
salary disbursements are now estimated to have increased
$107.2 billion in the third quarter of 2011, an upward
revision of $82.4 billion.  These estimates reflect newly
available wage and salary tabulations for the third
quarter from the BLS quarterly census of employment and
wages (QCEW).  These data are more comprehensive than the monthly
employment and earnings data that were used for the
earlier estimates√πthe QCEW data include irregular pay,
such as bonuses and gains from the exercise of  stock
options .  Real disposable personal income is now estimated to have
increased 0.7 percent in the third quarter and 1.4 percent
in the fourth.  (By comparison, the estimates that were
available last month showed an decrease of 1.9 percent in
the third quarter and an increase of 0.8 percent in the
fourth.)  Brent R. Moulton

(202) 606-9606  Table A.--SOURCE DATA FOR THE ADVANCE AND SECOND  ESTIMATES OF GDP FOR THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2011  This table shows the actual data used for the second
estimate of GDP for the fourth quarter of 2011.  For these
key series, actual data for December were not available in
time for inclusion in the advance GDP estimate released on
January 27, 2012, and BEA made assumptions for these
source data.  The numbers in brackets show the December
values that had been assumed for the advance estimate.
For most series, the data incorporated for November and,
in some cases, for October, were preliminary, and the
numbers shown in brackets are the values used last month.  All series shown in the table are in billions of dollars,
seasonally adjusted at annual rates, and are published by
the Bureau of the Census.  2011  Jul.      Aug.      Sep.      Oct.      Nov.      Dec.  Private fixed investment:  Nonresidential structures:
