General Electric Co. (GE) , the biggest
maker of  wind turbines  in the U.S., won a partial appeals court
victory in its patent-infringement case against rival  Mitsubishi
Heavy Industries Ltd. (7011)   A U.S. appeals court ordered the U.S. International Trade
Commission to review whether Mitsubishi Heavy violated GEâ€™s
rights under one patent, while affirming a decision that there
was no infringement of a second patent. The decision was posted
on the website of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal
Circuit   To contact the reporter on this story:
