European Union leaders are “taking
all necessary measures” to restore growth while also paring
excessive debt, according to a draft EU summit statement.  Countries drawing on aid or under “market scrutiny” must
abide by budget targets while better-off countries “should let
automatic stabilizers operate fully,” said the draft of the
statement to be released at the end of a March 1-2 summit in
Brussels.  Europe  has made “insufficient” progress on targets for
research, employment,  climate change , education and social
inclusion, the draft said. It called for “more precise,
operational and measurable commitments.”  The statement echoed prior warnings that banks strengthen
their capital positions “without excessive deleveraging.”  It set a June target for launching a “project bond”
initiative that will guarantee some new bonds sold for energy
and transport projects.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
