Italian and Spanish  two-year notes 
jumped as the  European Central Bank  lent financial institutions
more three-year cash than economists predicted, fueling bets the
extraordinary loans will be used to buy the nations’ debt.  French two-year rates slid to a euro-era record, posting
their third monthly drop. Italian notes yielded the least in 15
months as the ECB agreed to lend 800 financial institutions
529.5 billion euros ($711 billion) through its longer-term
refinancing operation. That was more than the 470 billion-euro
median of 28 estimates in a Bloomberg survey. Portuguese notes
gained as the ECB was seen to be buying the securities.  “What we saw after the first LTRO is likely to develop
further, with yields falling, and it will be no surprise to see
further support for Italian and Spanish bonds,” said  Patrick Jacq , a senior fixed-income strategist at BNP Paribas SA in
Paris. “Demand was relatively strong and far stronger than the
demand we saw in December.”  German  bunds  slipped with  U.S. Treasuries  as Federal
Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  signaled the central bank may
not expand stimulus.  The Italian two-year note yield fell 29 basis points, or
0.29 percentage point, to 2.15 percent at 4:30 p.m. London time
after dropping to the least since Nov. 5, 2010. The 2.25 percent
note due November 2013 gained 0.47, or 4.70 euros per 1,000-euro
face amount, to 100.185. That’s the first time the price of the
securities has climbed to more than 100 cents on the euro.  Spanish, Italian Spreads  Spain ’s  two-year notes  advanced for a 10th consecutive day,
with the yield dropping 13 basis points to 2.32 percent.
 France ’s 2 percent security maturing in September 2013 gained
for a fourth day, with the yield dropping five basis points to
0.56 percent, after being as low as 0.53 percent.  Volatility in Portuguese debt was the highest in euro-area
markets, according to measures of 10-year bonds, two- and 10-
year yield spreads and credit-default swaps. The two-year note
yield slipped 10 basis points to 12.70 percent as the ECB bought
the nation’s bonds, according to two people with knowledge of
the transactions, who declined to be identified because the
trades are confidential.  Italy’s government note yields have tumbled about 4
percentage points since the ECB announced its plan to offer
unlimited loans for three years on Dec. 8. Banks took 489
billion euros in the first operation later that month.  Decline After LTRO  “An obvious use of LTRO funding is to purchase  government
bonds  paying higher rates,”  Fitch Ratings  said in an e-mailed
report yesterday. “Sovereign spreads showed a marked decline
following the LTRO” in December, it said.  The extra yield, or spread, that investors get for holding
Italian 10-year bonds instead of similar-maturity German debt
securities dropped three basis points to 3.52 percentage points.
The spread between bunds and French bonds narrowed to 1.07
percentage points from 1.13 percentage points yesterday.  Demand for the safest securities waned as Bernanke said
today in prepared testimony to the House Financial Services
Committee in  Washington  that current policy “is consistent with
promoting” the central bank’s objectives on jobs and inflation.
He didn’t discuss options for further easing.  The Treasury 10-year  note  yield rose three basis points to
1.98 percent.  Germany ’s  10-year bond yield  rose one basis point
to 1.81 percent.  Union Investment  Italian bonds returned 10 percent in 2012 and added 4.1
percent profit this month, according to indexes compiled by
Bloomberg and the European Federation of Financial Analysts
Societies. Spanish securities have gained 2.6 percent this year,
and German bonds rose 0.3 percent, the indexes show.  Germany’s Union Investment said it’s buying Italian and
Spanish bonds because the liquidity measures from the ECB makes
them attractive.  “We’re actively exposed to Spain and  Italy ,” Frank Engels, a Frankfurt-based managing director of fixed income,
said in a Feb. 24 telephone interview. Engels’ 46-member team
manages about 74 billion euros. “We like the idea that
liquidity and reform measures should lead to further
stabilization.”  Germany’s 10-year bund yields increased from as low as 1.78
percent yesterday, the least since Jan. 31. It also rose as a
report showed the nation’s unemployment rate stayed at the
lowest in more than two decades last month.  Europe ’s largest economy sold 3.26 billion euros of 2022
debt securities today.  The 2 percent bonds were priced to yield an average 1.83
percent, attracting bids equivalent to 1.4 times the amount
allotted. The so-called bid-to-cover ratio was unchanged from an
auction on Feb. 1, when the country offered 4.1 billion euros of
the debt. Total bids dropped to 4.69 billion euros from 5.68
billion euros.  The auctions “went smoothly, overshadowed by the outcome
of the ECB’s three-year LTRO injection,” Annalisa Piazza, a
fixed-income analyst at Newedge Group in  London , wrote in a
client note.  To contact the reporters on this story:
