Sri Lankan inflation slowed to a 28-
month low as the cost of food and beverages dropped.  Consumer prices  in the capital,  Colombo , increased 2.7
percent from a year earlier after gaining 3.8 percent in January,
the Department of Census and Statistics said on its website
today. The median of six estimates in a Bloomberg News survey
was for a 4 percent advance.  Sri Lanka raised fuel prices this month and allowed its
currency to weaken to a record low, part of measures to curb
demand for imports such as oil and shield currency reserves. The
steps may cause inflation to accelerate, and the central bank on
Feb. 3 increased  interest rates  for the first time since 2007 to
contain credit growth.  “There is no need to raise rates again to cool inflation
or support the currency, as that would hamper growth,” Sarath Rajapakse, director of research at Capital Trust Securities Pvt.
in Colombo, said before the report.  Sri Lanka  scrapped a trading band for the rupee on Feb. 9.
The currency slid to 122.35 per dollar today, its weakest level
against the U.S. currency. It has tumbled almost 7 percent so
far this year, the most in the world after  Iran ’s rial. The
Colombo All-Share Index has declined 10.2 percent in the period.  To contact the reporter on this story:
