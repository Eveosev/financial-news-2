South Korea ’s won rose to its
highest level in more than two weeks and government bonds fell
after industrial output unexpectedly increased for the first
time in four months and U.S. consumer confidence picked up.  Output rose 3.3 percent in January from December, when it
dropped a revised 0.7 percent, Statistics Korea said today.
Economists forecast a 0.5 percent decline, a Bloomberg survey
showed. Overseas investors bought more Korean shares than they
sold today, following two days of net selling. The Conference
Board’s gauge of U.S. consumer confidence in February increased
to the highest level in a year, figures from the New York-based
research group showed yesterday.  “Positive U.S. data set a favorable tone for won trading
today,” said Lee Kun Hee, a Seoul-based currency dealer at
Korea Exchange Bank.  The won strengthened 0.5 percent to 1,118.96 per dollar in
 Seoul , according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The currency
touched 1,117.90 earlier, the highest level since Feb. 10. The
Kospi index of shares climbed 1.3 percent.  The economy expanded in the fourth quarter at the slowest
pace in two years and growth may bottom in the current period
through March, Finance Minister Bahk Jae Wan said last week.  The yield on South Korea’s 3.5 percent bonds due September
2016 rose one basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 3.54
percent, Korea Exchange Inc. prices show.  To contact the reporters on this story:
