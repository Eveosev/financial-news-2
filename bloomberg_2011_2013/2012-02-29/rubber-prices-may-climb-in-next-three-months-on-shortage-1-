Natural rubber may advance in the
next three months because of a seasonal reduction in output and
expanding demand from China and  India , according to the
 Association of Natural Rubber Producing Countries.   Production from members, representing 92 percent of global
supply, may increase 2.6 percent to 10.53 million tons, the
group said in its monthly bulletin. That compares with 8.2
percent growth last year, it said.  Demand from members, accounting for 57 percent of use, may
grow 4.4 percent to 6.37 million tons, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
