Akenerji Elektrik Uretim AS (AKENR)  , the utility owned by  CEZ AS (CEZ)  and Akkok Group, fell to its
lowest in almost a month after reporting its full-year loss that
was bigger than analysts expected.  The shares dropped 0.9 percent to 2.2 liras at 4:43 p.m. in
Istanbul, headed for the lowest close since Feb. 3.  The loss widened to 211 million liras ($121 million) last
year from 26.4 million liras a year earlier, it said in a
statement to the Istanbul Stock Exchange after the market closed
yesterday. That was more than the 93.5 million liras average of
17 analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
