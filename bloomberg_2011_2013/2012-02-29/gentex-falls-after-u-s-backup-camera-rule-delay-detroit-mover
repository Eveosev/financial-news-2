(Corrects date of share decline in second paragraph.)  Gentex Corp. (GNTX)  slid 9.9 percent after
the U.S. again delayed issuing a rule that may require cars and
light trucks to have rear-view cameras.  Gentex  fell  to $24.90 at 9:21 a.m. New York time before the
start of regular trading. The shares declined 6.6 percent this
year through Feb. 28 after rising 0.1 percent in 2011. The rule
was to have been posted by today’s deadline. Gentex rose 4.5
percent yesterday as investors anticipated issuance of the rule.  A 2008 auto-safety law signed by President  George W. Bush 
mandated the Transportation Department to issue the requirement
by the end of 2011. It’s now being pushed back a second time by
Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood and will be posted by the
end of this year, the department said in an e-mailed statement
yesterday.  Gentex makes rear- and side-view mirrors that include
camera displays. It competes against  Magna International Inc. (MG) ,
an Aurora, Ontario-based maker of the mirrors and the cameras,
as well as producers of systems that display images from backup
cameras in navigation systems.  Gentex, based in Zeeland,  Michigan , may have a revenue
increase of as much as 20 percent on shipment growth of as much
as 14 percent spanning three to four years,  David Leiker , a
Robert W. Baird & Co. analyst, said in a Dec. 28 report. He
recommends buying the shares. The company reported $1.02 billion
in revenue last year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
