A liquefied natural gas tanker owned
by  Mitsui O.S.K. Lines Ltd. (9104)  that typically shuttles between
Qatar and  Europe  is sailing for the first time in at least a
year to  Asia , where the cargo costs almost twice as much.  The Al Aamriya left Ras Laffan on Jan. 19, according to
AISLive Ltd. ship-tracking data compiled by Bloomberg. It is
currently in the Bay of Bengal and signaling for South Korea.
The carrier brought seven Qatari cargoes to the U.K. and Belgium
in the past year, data show.  One million British thermal units of Qatari LNG costs
$17.12 in South Korea, compared with $8.87 in the U.K.,
according to January data from New York-based shipbroker Poten &
Partners. Accounting for costs to transport the fuel and convert
it back into gas, the return from shipping Qatari LNG to  South
Korea  is 140 percent higher, the figures show.  Akika Hamakawa, a spokeswoman for Tokyo-based Mitsui
O.S.K., declined to comment. The company owns the largest global
shipping fleet. Qatar is the worldâ€™s biggest exporter of LNG,
which is natural gas that has been chilled to a liquid state for
transportation.  To contact the reporter on this story:
