Iran  is exporting about 2 million
barrels of crude a day and has an increasing number of buyers
even as countries impose sanctions, state-run  Mehr  news agency
said, citing Deputy Oil Minister Ahmad Qalebani.  “There isn’t at this point any crude production that
remains without clients,” he said, according to the report
today. Iran’s storage facilities in the  Persian Gulf  are almost
empty because of sales to a growing number of foreign customers,
Mehr quoted Qalebani as saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
