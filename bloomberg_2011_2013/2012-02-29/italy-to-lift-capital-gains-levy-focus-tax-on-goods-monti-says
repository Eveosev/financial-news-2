Prime Minister  Mario Monti  said
 Italy  will raise the levy on capital gains and start shifting
the focus of taxes from income to goods as part of an overhaul
of the country’s tax system.  “We will present drafts of regulations aimed at
rebalancing the tax system, including the taxation of capital
gains,” Monti said in  guidelines  for Italy’s fiscal policy in
the three years through 2014 posted on the Treasury’s website
today. The proposals will also include “the gradual shift from
direct taxation to indirect taxation,” according to the
document.  A measure to raise the capital-gains tax to 20 percent from
12.5 percent was included in an austerity package passed in
August by the government led by Monti’s predecessor,  Silvio Berlusconi . The increase was then dropped during the plan’s
approval by Parliament.  To contact the reporters on this story:
