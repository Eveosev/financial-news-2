PNC Financial Services Group Inc. (PNC) ,
the sixth-largest  U.S. bank  by deposits, may need to eliminate
as much as $1.32 billion in invested capital under the Volcker
rule.  PNC held $880 million in private equity and hedge funds and
sponsored three such funds with total invested capital of $441
million as of Dec. 31, the Pittsburgh-based bank said today in
its annual filing with regulators. PNC said it’s likely some of
the amounts will fall over time “in the ordinary course of
business before compliance is required.”  “A forced sale of some of these investments due to the
Volcker rule could result in PNC receiving less value than it
would otherwise have received,” the bank said in the filing.  PNC and other U.S. regional lenders are grappling with how
the Volcker rule, a proposal made under the 2010 Dodd-Frank Act
that seeks to limit risky trading, will affect their companies.
Executives at lenders such as Buffalo-based  M&T Bank Corp. (MTB)  have
said the rule would place a burden on smaller banks just to
prove they’re not in the business of proprietary trading.  “Any meaningful limitation on PNC’s ability to hedge its
risks in the ordinary course or to trade on behalf of customers
would likely be adverse to PNC’s  business ,” the company wrote
in the filing. “The proposed rules contain extensive compliance
and recordkeeping requirements related to permissible trading
activities. Such requirements, if included in a final rule,
could increase the costs of hedging or other types of
permissible transactions.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
