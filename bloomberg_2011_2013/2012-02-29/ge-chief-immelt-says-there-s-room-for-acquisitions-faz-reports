  General Electric Co. (GE)  Chief
Executive Officer Jeffrey Immelt said the U.S. company always
has “room for acquisitions” and is eyeing candidates that
could cost $3 billion each,  Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung 
reported today, citing an interview.  GE raised its  forecast  for the industrial businesses and
now sees full-year revenue rising about 15 percent to $110
billion, the German newspaper said, citing the interview, which
was sent via e-mail.  A GE spokeswoman, Deirdre Latour, told Bloomberg News later
in a telephone interview that the Fairfield, Connecticut-based
company hasn’t changed its forecast for this year. Revenue at
the industrial units may increase 5 percent to 10 percent in
2012, GE said in December.  To contact the reporters on this story:
