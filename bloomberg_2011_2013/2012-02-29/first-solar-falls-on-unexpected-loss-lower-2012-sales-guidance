First Solar Inc. (FSLR) , the world’s
largest maker of thin-film solar panels, fell the most in more
than two months after reporting an unexpected loss and reducing
sales guidance for the year.  First Solar dropped 12 percent to $32.30 at the close in
New York, the biggest drop since Dec. 14. Shares of the Tempe,
Arizona-based panel manufacturer have lost 4.3 percent this
year.  The company reported a net loss of $413 million, or $4.74 a
share, compared with net income of $155.9 million, or $1.80 a
share, a year earlier, according to a statement after the close
of trading yesterday. First Solar was expected to earn $1.02 a
share, the average of 18 estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  “The fourth quarter was a washout,” Hari Chandra Polavarapu, an analyst at Auriga USA LLC in  New York , said today
in a note to clients. He has a “buy” rating on the stock.
“First Solar is walking away from below-cost module competition
from  China  even as it makes forays into non-subsidized markets
that are yet to take hold.”  The company wrote down the value of goodwill by $393
million, and spent $60 million for restructuring costs and $164
million for warranties for flawed equipment. Excluding those
items, fourth-quarter profit was $1.26 per share.  First Solar reduced its 2012 revenue  forecast  to $3.5
billion to $3.8 billion, compared with a December forecast of
$3.7 billion to $4 billion. Their per-share profit forecast was
unchanged at $3.75 to $4.25, excluding any additional
restructuring expenses.  To contact the reporter on this story:
