Michael Jordan , who led the  Chicago
Bulls  to six National Basketball Association championships
during his Hall of Fame career, is selling his suburban home for
$29 million.  The 56,000-square-foot Highland Park, Illinois, estate has
nine bedrooms, more than 15 baths and five fireplaces, and
features a separate indoor basketball complex with specially
cushioned hardwood flooring, according to a press release
from Baird & Warner Real Estate in Chicago.   In addition to the main residence, the property, which was
built between 1993 and 1995 and renovated in 2009, includes a
three-bedroom guesthouse, indoor/outdoor entertaining and pool
area, outdoor tennis court, putting green, deep-water pond and
three climate-controlled multicar garages.  Katherine Chez-Malkin of Baird & Warner, who is selling the
property, didn’t immediately respond to an e-mail asking what
conditions, if any, must be met by potential buyers who want to
see the property.  Jordan, 49, won the NBA’s Most Valuable Player award five
times in a career that began in 1984 with the Bulls and ended in
2003 with the Washington Wizards. The  Nike Inc. (NKE)  pitchman and
majority owner of the  Charlotte Bobcats  averaged 30.1 points,
6.2 rebounds and 5.3 assists.  To contact the reporter on this story:
