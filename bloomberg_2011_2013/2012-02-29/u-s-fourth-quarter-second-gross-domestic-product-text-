Following is the text of the
Gross Domestic Product from the Commerce Department.  Real gross domestic product -- the output of goods and
services produced by labor and property located in the  United
States  -- increased at an annual rate of 3.0 percent in the
fourth quarter of 2011 (that is, from the third quarter to the
fourth quarter), according to the "second" estimate released by
the  Bureau of Economic Analysis .  In the third quarter, real GDP
increased 1.8 percent.  The GDP estimate released today is based on more complete
source data than were available for the "advance" estimate issued
last month. In the advance estimate, the increase in real GDP was
2.8 percent.  The increase in real GDP in the fourth quarter reflected
positive contributions from private inventory investment,
personal consumption expenditures (PCE), exports, nonresidential
fixed investment, and residential fixed investment that were
partly offset by negative contributions from federal  government
spending  and state and local government spending. Imports, which
are a subtraction
in the calculation of GDP, increased.  The acceleration in real GDP in the fourth quarter
primarily reflected an upturn in private inventory investment and
accelerations in PCE and in residential fixed investment that
were partly offset by a deceleration in nonresidential fixed
investment, a downturn in federal government spending, an
acceleration in imports, and a larger decrease in state and local
government spending.  Final sales of computers added 0.12 percentage point to the
fourth-quarter change in real GDP after adding 0.22 percentage
point to the third-quarter change.  Motor vehicle output added
0.43 percentage point to the fourth-quarter change in real GDP
after adding 0.12 percentage point to the third-quarter change.  The  price index  for gross domestic purchases, which
measures prices paid by U.S. residents, increased 1.1 percent in
the fourth quarter, 0.3 percentage point more than in the advance
estimate; this index increased 2.0 percent in the third quarter.
Excluding food and energy prices, the price index for gross
domestic purchases increased 1.2 percent in the fourth quarter,
compared with an increase of 1.8 percent in the third.  Real personal consumption expenditures increased 2.1
percent in the fourth quarter, compared with an increase of 1.7
percent in the third.  Durable goods increased 15.3 percent,
compared with an increase of 5.7 percent.  Nondurable goods
increased 0.4 percent, in contrast to a decrease of 0.5 percent.
Services increased 0.7 percent, compared with an increase of 1.9
percent.  Real nonresidential fixed investment increased 2.8 percent,
compared with an increase of 15.7 percent.  Nonresidential
structures decreased 2.6 percent, in contrast to an increase of
14.4 percent. Equipment and software increased 4.8 percent,
compared with an increase of 16.2 percent.  Real residential
fixed investment increased 11.5 percent, compared with an
increase of 1.3 percent.  Real exports of goods and services increased 4.3 percent in the
fourth quarter, compared with an increase of 4.7 percent in the
third.  Real imports of goods and services increased 3.8 percent,
compared
with an increase of 1.2 percent.  Real federal government consumption expenditures and gross
investment decreased 6.9 percent in the fourth quarter, in
contrast to an increase of 2.1 percent in the third.  National
defense decreased 12.1 percent, in contrast to an increase of 5.0
percent.  Nondefense increased 4.4 percent, in contrast to a
decrease of 3.8 percent.  Real state and local government
consumption expenditures and gross investment decreased 2.5
percent, compared with a decrease of 1.6 percent.  The change in real private inventories added 1.88 percentage
points to the fourth-quarter change in real GDP, after
subtracting 1.35 percentage points from the third-quarter change.
Private businesses increased inventories $54.3 billion in the
fourth quarter, following a decrease of $2.0 billion in the third
quarter and an increase of $39.1 billion in the second.  Real final sales of domestic product -- GDP less change in
private inventories -- increased 1.1 percent in the fourth
quarter, compared with an increase of 3.2 percent in the third.  Gross domestic purchases  Real gross domestic purchases -- purchases by U.S. residents of
goods and services wherever produced -- increased 2.9 percent in
the fourth quarter, compared with an increase of 1.3 percent in
the third.  Current-dollar GDP  Current-dollar GDP -- the market value of the nation's output of
goods and services -- increased 3.9 percent, or $144.7 billion,
in the fourth quarter to a level of $15,320.8 billion.  In the
third quarter, current-dollar GDP increased 4.4 percent, or
$163.3 billion.  Revisions  The "second" estimate of the fourth-quarter increase in real GDP
is 0.2 percentage point, or $7.5 billion, higher than the advance
estimate issued last month.  The upward revision to the percent
change
in real GDP primarily reflected an upward revision to
nonresidential fixed investment, a downward revision to imports,
and an upward revision to personal consumption expenditures
(PCE).  Advance Estimate        Second Estimate  (Percent change from preceding quarter)  Real GDP..........                    2.8                  3.0

Gross domestic purchases price index  0.8                  1.1  2011 GDP  Real GDP increased 1.7 percent in 2011 (that is, from the 2010
annual level to the 2011 annual level), compared with an increase
of 3.0 percent in 2010.  The increase in real GDP in 2011 primarily reflected positive
contributions from PCE, exports, and nonresidential fixed
investment that were partly offset by negative contributions from
state and local government spending, private inventory
investment, and federal government spending.  Imports, which are
a subtraction in the calculation of GDP, increased.  The deceleration in real GDP in 2011 primarily reflected
downturns in private inventory investment and in federal
government spending and a deceleration in exports that were
partly offset by a deceleration in imports and an acceleration in
nonresidential fixed investment.  The price index for gross domestic purchases increased 2.5
percent in 2011, compared with an increase of 1.5 percent in
2010.  Current-dollar GDP increased 3.9 percent, or $567.9 billion, in
2011 to a level of $15,094.4 billion.  In 2010, current-dollar
GDP increased 4.2 percent, or $587.5 billion.  During 2011 (that is, measured from the fourth quarter of 2010 to
the fourth quarter of 2011), real GDP increased 1.6 percent.
Real GDP increased 3.1 percent during 2010.  The price index for
gross domestic purchases increased 2.6 percent during 2011,
compared with an increase of 1.4 percent during 2010.  Next release March 29, 2012, at 8:30 A.M. EDT for:
