New World Resources Plc (NWR) , the biggest
Czech coking-coal producer, rose to the highest in almost three
weeks after the  Daily Telegraph  reported that Polish rival
Jastrzebska Spolka Weglowa SA held talks to merge with NWR.  The stock added as much as 4.2 percent to 163 koruna, the
highest since Feb. 9. NWR pared the rally to 2.9 percent at 161
koruna after Jaroslaw Zagorowski, the chief executive officer of
JSW, denied the newspaper report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
