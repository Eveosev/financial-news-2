Intesa Sanpaolo SpA (ISP)  Chief Executive
Officer Enrico Tommaso Cucchiani said  Italy ’s second-biggest
bank requested 24 billion euros ($32.3 billion) in three-year
loans from the  European Central Bank  today.  Intesa joined about 800 euro-area banks that tapped the ECB
for 529.5 billion euros, more than economists’ median estimate
of 470 billion euros in a Bloomberg News survey. In the ECB’s
first three-year operation in December, 523 banks borrowed 489
billion euros. Cucchiani’s comments, reported earlier by Ansa
newswire, were confirmed by a spokesman in Trieste, Italy.  “Banks are now largely insulated from shocks in the
funding market, having pre-funded through 2014,” analysts at
Goldman Sachs wrote in a note today. “Consequently, the costs
of bank and sovereign funding have now been detached,” they
said, including Intesa in their group of “investible banks.”  Mediobanca SpA applied for 4 billion euros, CEO  Alberto Nagel  told analysts last week. Federico Ghizzoni, CEO of
UniCredit SpA, said last week that Italy’s biggest bank was
planning to participate in the auction, without giving details.  To contact the reporter on this story:
