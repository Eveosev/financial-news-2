Mohegan Tribal Gaming Authority, the
operator of Mohegan Sun casinos in  Connecticut  and Pennsylvania,
lowered the participation requirement on a $1.1 billion debt
swap offer to complete the exchange.  The casino operator, which extended deadlines for the offer
nine times, sought to refinance the debt before a  credit line 
matures next month. The Uncasville, Connecticut-based company
will accept the exchange of $500 million of notes due in 2012
and 2013 with at least 83.5 percent of holders having tendered,
down from the previous threshold of 90 percent required in the
offering, according to a statement today. Holders offered 83.6
percent of the notes, the company said.  The casino operator is overhauling its capital structure
after it warned that its failure to refinance debt last year
raised “substantial doubt” about its ability “to continue as
a going concern,” according to a Dec. 29 regulatory filing.
Mohegan had total debt including capital leases on Sept. 30 of
$1.64 billion.  The company had previously said that minimum tender
requirements were met for its $200 million of second-lien notes
and for $375 million of subordinated notes due in 2014 and 2015.  To contact the reporter on this story:
