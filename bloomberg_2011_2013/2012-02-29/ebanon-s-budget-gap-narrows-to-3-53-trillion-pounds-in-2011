Lebanon’s budget deficit narrowed in
2011 because of increased revenue from telecommunications.  The shortfall narrowed to 3.53 trillion Lebanese pounds
($2.3 billion) from 4.36 trillion pounds the previous year, the
Ministry of Finance said in an e-mailed statement.  The ministry included estimated revenue of 2.26 trillion
pounds from the Telecommunications Ministry in its calculations,
up from 957 billion pounds a year earlier.  To contact the reporter on this story:
