OAO Gazprom,  Russia ’s natural-gas
exporter, held talks with the Greek government on the possible
sale of national gas company Depa SA.  Gazprom Export chief  Alexander Medvedev  met with Greek
Energy and Environment Minister Giorgos Papaconstantinou in
Athens yesterday, Gazprom said in a statement. The men discussed
“the prospects of privatization of Greek energy companies Depa
and Desfa,” Gazprom said, without elaborating.  Greece  plans to sell Desfa SA, a fully-owned unit of Depa,
either as a separate entity or together with its parent,
Papaconstantinou said Feb. 15.  To contact the reporter on this story:
