Jazztel Plc (JAZ) , the Spanish phone
company that’s winning market share from  Telefonica SA (TEF) , expects
net income to climb as it attracts more broadband customers.  Jazztel, which said today that 2011 profit soared to
50.7 million euros ($67.8 million) from 7.2 million euros a
year earlier, forecast that net income will climb to 55 million
euros to 65 million euros this year. The prediction makes
assumptions about taxes and tax credits, the company said in a
statement.  “The main reason we are growing significantly in Spain is
because of the quality of the service we provide,” Chief
Executive Officer Jose Miguel Garcia told reporters in
Barcelona. “Even as the Spanish market is a very competitive
one, we are managing to prosper.”  As  Spain ’s economy weakens amid growing unemployment and
declining incomes, many broadband customers are switching
providers for better prices or service. Jazztel said earnings
before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization this year
will be 170 million euros to 180 million euros.  “Results beat the guidance for 2011 and show an
improvement in growth forecast for 2012,” Marta Gomez, a
Madrid-based analyst at Banesto Bolsa who recommends buying the
stock, wrote in a report to investors. “There’s still value in
the company.”  Jazztel  shares  fell 3.2 percent to 4.29 euros in Madrid
today, valuing the company at 1.06 billion euros. The shares
have climbed 15 percent this year, outperforming the IBEX 35
Index’s 1.2 percent decline.  To contact the reporter on this story:
