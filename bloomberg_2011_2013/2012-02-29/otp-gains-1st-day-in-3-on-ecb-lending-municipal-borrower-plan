OTP Bank Nyrt. (OTP)  rose for the first
day in three as the  European Central Bank ’s three-year lending
operation boosted appetite for riskier assets and  Hungary ’s
largest bank unveiled a plan to help municipal borrowers.  The shares gained 1.2 percent to 3,998 forint by the end of
trading in Budapest. The benchmark BUX stock index advanced 0.4
percent to 19,286.54.  The Frankfurt-based ECB said today it will lend 800
financial institutions 529.5 billion euros ($712.2 billion) for
1,092 days, a bigger allotment than economists estimated in a
Bloomberg News survey. OTP offered the option of fixing the
exchange rate on Swiss-franc denominated municipality bond
repayments at a below-market rate for a three-year period, OTP
Managing Director Pal Kovacs said at a press conference in
Budapest today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
