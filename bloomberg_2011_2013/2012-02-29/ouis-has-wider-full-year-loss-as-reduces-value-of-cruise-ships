Louis Plc, the largest tourism
company in Greece and Cyprus, reported increased losses for last
year after reducing the value of two cruise ships.  Louis posted a loss of 60.9 million euros ($82 million) for
2011 compared with 10.2 million euros a year earlier. Sales fell
10 percent to 247.5 million euros.  “The reduction of the value of two cruise ships negatively
affected 2011 earnings by 25.4 million euros,” the company said
today in a  statement  on the website of the Cyprus Stock
Exchange. “A 8.9 million euros provision for a bad debt in
relation to the sale of the ship Aegean Pearl in 2010 was also
made.”  The company’s cruise unit Louis Cruises will focus on the
east Mediterranean and seek to further restructure its fleet,
the company said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
