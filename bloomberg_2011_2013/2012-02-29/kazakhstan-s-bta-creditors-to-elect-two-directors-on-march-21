BTA Bank (BTAS)  will hold a meeting with
investors to select two directors representing the interests of
creditors on the lender’s board.  Senior bondholders will appoint one of the directors, with
another elected by holders of so-called original-issue discount-
debt instruments, the Almaty-based lender said in a statement e-
mailed today. The creditors will choose among five  candidates ,
the bank said.  Two creditor directors resigned as BTA sought its second
debt restructuring in as many years after failing to make an
interest payment on its July 2018 dollar bonds in January.
Kazakhstan’s sovereign wealth fund Samruk-Kazyna took over BTA
in February 2009, two months before the nation’s largest lender
at the time defaulted on $12 billion of debt.  A group of unidentified creditors said in a Dec. 30 letter
to BTA, the Kazakh central bank and Samruk-Kazyna that it’s
“critical that the board of directors includes creditor
directors.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
