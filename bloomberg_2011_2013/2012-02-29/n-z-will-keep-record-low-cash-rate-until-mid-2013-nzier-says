New Zealand ’s central bank will keep
the  official cash rate  at a record-low 2.5 percent until
mid-2013 because of a sluggish economy and subdued inflation,
the New Zealand Institute of Economic Research said.  “The economic outlook is flat. Most indicators are moving
sideways,”  Shamubeel Eaqub , principal economist at the
Wellington-based organization, said in a report today. “Any
increases in  interest rates  should be contingent on convincing
evidence of a sustained economic recovery.”  New Zealand’s economy will grow 1.5 percent this year,
Eaqub said, reiterating a December forecast. The pace may
quicken to 2.4 percent in 2013 as the reconstruction of
earthquake-damaged Christchurch and the surrounding province of
Canterbury accelerates.  “We are less optimistic than most on the timing of the
rebuild, as we think persistent aftershocks, tougher building
codes and insurance issues will slow Canterbury’s recovery,”
Eaqub said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
