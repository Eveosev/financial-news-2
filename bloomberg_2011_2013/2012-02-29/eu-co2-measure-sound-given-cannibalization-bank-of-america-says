A decision to potentially set aside
European Union carbon allowances, temporarily cutting supply,
makes sense because energy efficiency laws would otherwise
cannibalize emission reductions, said  Bank of America  Corp.  The EU parliament’s industry committee voted yesterday in
Brussels to amend the planned efficiency law by saying
regulators should put forward, “if appropriate,” measures that
“may include withholding of the necessary amount of
allowances” from auctions as early as next year. Prices in
 Europe ’s cap-and-trade system dropped to a record last month
because of oversupply.  The vote “makes clear there is strong and widespread
support to rehabilitate the EU emissions-trading system,” said
Abyd Karmali, head of carbon markets at Bank of America in
London. “It is an example of an ex-post adjustment, but one
that has a sound analytical basis given the cannibalizing of EU-
allowance demand by measures complementary to the emissions
trading system,” he said yesterday by e-mail.  The proposal probably will receive approval from EU nations
via an amended carbon-permit-auction regulation, or “as part of
a bundle of changes to the energy efficiency directive,” said
Karmali, who is also president of the Carbon Markets and
Investors Association, the lobby group.  Carbon permits for December fell 4 cents today to 8.98
euros a metric ton on ICE Futures Europe in  London  as of 8:26
a.m. They’ve risen 37 percent after reaching a record low on
Jan. 4.  To contact the reporter on this story:
