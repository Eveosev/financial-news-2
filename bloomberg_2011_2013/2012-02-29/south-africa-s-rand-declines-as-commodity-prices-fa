The rand extended its longest
winning streak in seven months and yields fell to the lowest in
more than a week after euro-area banks tapped the  European
Central Bank  for more than economists forecast.  South Africa ’s currency climbed as much as 0.7 percent to
7.4221 versus the dollar, a sixth day of gains, the longest
advance since July 27. The rand traded 0.5 percent stronger at
7.4364 as of 4 p.m. in Johannesburg. The yield on the nation’s
77 billion rand ($10 billion) of 6.75 percent bonds due 2021
dropped three basis points, or 0.03 percentage point, to 7.815
percent, the lowest since Feb. 20. Bond risk fell to the lowest
in four months.  The Frankfurt-based ECB said today it will lend 800
financial institutions 529.5 billion euros ($712.2 billion) for
1,092 days. Economists predicted an allotment of 470 billion
euros, according to the median of 28 estimates in a Bloomberg
News survey. The loans will help ease concerns about funding
pressures and provide liquidity for investment in riskier assets
including commodities and South  Africa ’s stocks and bonds.  “Some of this additional liquidity could also find its way
into the South African  bond market ,”  Kevin Lings , a
Johannesburg-based economist at Stanlib, the money manager unit
of Standard Bank Group Ltd., said in e-mailed comments. “The
rand is expected to remain firm.”  The rand gained as much as 1.7 percent and 10-year yields
fell seven basis points after the first ECB tender on Dec. 21,
when banks took 489 billion euros.  South Africa’s benchmark stock  index  climbed for a second
day, after posting its biggest one-day gain in a month
yesterday, as  commodity prices  rallied. Mining companies
including Anglo American Plc and BHP Billiton Ltd. led the
advance. Commodities, including metals, account for 64 percent
of South Africa’s exports, according to government data.  Default Risk  Credit default swaps for South Africa’s foreign-currency
sovereign bonds fell one basis point to 157 basis points today,
the lowest since Oct. 27 on a closing basis, according to CMA.
The contracts, which drop as perceptions of creditworthiness
improve, traded below default swaps from higher-rated  Austria 
and France 163 and 178.4, respectively.  Bonds gained as investors bet an expansion in private-
sector borrowing won’t be enough to persuade the central bank to
raise  interest rates  soon.  Borrowing by households and businesses rose 7.3 percent
from a year earlier, up from a revised 6.1 percent in December,
the Pretoria-based  Reserve Bank  said on its website today. The
median estimate in a Bloomberg survey of 11 economists was 7.1
percent.  Staying Neutral  “These credit numbers do not change our view that the
monetary policy committee is likely to keep policy neutral while
the economic climate remains cloudy in the face of weak global
conditions,” Dennis Dykes, an economist at Nedbank Group Ltd.
in Johannesburg, and colleagues wrote in e-mailed comments.  South Africa’s central bank has left its benchmark repo
rate at 5.5 percent for the past 18 months to aid a recovery in
Africa’s biggest economy. Forward-rate agreements starting in
November, after the MPC’s last meeting of 2012, dropped six
basis points today to 5.86 percent as investors pared bets on an
interest-rate increase this year.  The yield on the nation’s $1.5 billion of 4.665 percent
bonds due 2024 dropped three basis points to 4.2 percent, the
lowest since the bonds were first sold on Jan. 17. The extra
yield investors demand to hold the debt rather than U.S.
Treasuries narrowed one basis point to 229 basis points.  To contact the reporters on this story:
