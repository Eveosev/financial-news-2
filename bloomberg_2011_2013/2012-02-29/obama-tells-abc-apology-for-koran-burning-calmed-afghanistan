President  Barack Obama  said his
apology to Afghan President Hamid Karzai over the burning of the
Koran at a U.S. base has “calmed things down.”  Obama said in an ABC News interview released today that,
while tensions are still high in Afghanistan over the incident,
the apology in a letter to Karzai has helped ease the situation.
He dismissed criticism of the apology from Republicans.  “My criteria in any decision I make, getting
recommendations from folks who are actually on the ground, is
what is going to best protect our folks and make sure that they
can accomplish their mission,” Obama said, according to an
excerpt released by ABC.  The burning of Korans at an air base in  Afghanistan  sparked
riots and attacks on U.S. personnel in the country. The Pentagon
said the Korans were with religious materials that were
improperly disposed of by being put in a pile of debris for
burning.  Republican presidential candidates  Mitt Romney  and  Rick Santorum  have been among the critics of the apology.  To contact the reporter on this story:
