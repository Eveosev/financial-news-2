The ruble weakened for a second day
amid speculation the central bank bought dollars and euros to
curb gains and as the monthly tax period ended.  The Russian currency depreciated 0.1 percent to 29.07 to
the dollar at the 7 p.m. close in Moscow, paring its monthly
advance to 3.8 percent. The ruble slipped 0.3 percent to 39.13
against the euro and retreated 0.2 percent to 33.5970 against
the central bank’s target euro-dollar basket.  Bank Rossii manages the currency against the basket and at
current levels is buying about $250 million a day to slow the
ruble’s advance, according to Vladimir Kolychev, chief economist
for Societe Generale SA’s OAO  Rosbank (ROSB)  unit in Moscow. About 400
billion rubles ($14 billion) in taxes were due to be paid Feb.
27 and 28 according to VTB Capital.  “The central bank is still on the offer side,” Kolychev
said by e-mail today. “There’s no support from export sales as
the tax period has ended.”  Investors increased bets the Russian currency would weaken,
with non-deliverable forwards showing the ruble at 29.42 per
dollar in three months, compared with expectations of 29.3463
per dollar yesterday.  Urals crude’s 9.5 percent gain in February helped the
currency of the world’s biggest energy exporter rally for a
second month. The ruble is more likely to strengthen than weaken
in the first half of this year, Bank Rossii First Deputy
Chairman Alexey Ulyukayev said in an interview published in the
government’s official Rossiiskaya Gazeta newspaper today.  Bonds Climb  Developing nation bonds, stocks and currencies advanced and
oil rose today as the  European Central Bank  provided lenders
with a larger amount of cash than forecast and U.S. economic
growth topped forecasts. Oil and gas account for about 50
percent of Russia’s state revenue.  Russia’s current-account surplus and $504.4 billion of
reserves make it one of the least exposed Eastern European
countries to the euro-area debt crisis,  Standard & Poor’s  said
in an e-mailed note today.  The yield on the government’s $3.5 billion of bonds due
2020 dropped two basis point, or 0.02 percentage point, to 3.983
percent, the lowest on a closing basis since the notes first
traded in April 2010.  Russia’s Eurobonds due 2015 rose for a fourth day, pushing
the yield down three basis points to 2.326 percent. Dollar notes
due the same year issued by OAO Sberbank,  Russia ’s largest
lender, yielded 16 basis points less than yesterday at 3.728
percent, while the yield on similar-maturity debt from state gas
monopoly OAO Gazprom fell 15 basis points to 3.566 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
