Impala Platinum Holdings Ltd. (IMP)  may
restart the world’s biggest platinum mine next week after
employees agreed to return to work, ending a four-week stoppage
that cut global supplies by more than 100,000 ounces.  “It was agreed to call an end to the illegal work
stoppage,” Johannesburg-based Impala said in an e-mailed
statement today after meeting with the  National Union of
Mineworkers  and a delegation of rock-drill operators. “We hope
to start ramping up production from Monday,” it said. Platinum
pared earlier gains in  London .  The stoppage cut global supplies of the the metal, used in
cars and jewelry, by 3,000 ounces daily, costing Impala more
than 2 billion rand ($270 million) of revenue. Mines restart
gradually after a stoppage and take time to revert to full
production. Impala’s Rustenburg mine produces about 12 percent
of global output of the metal.  Impala, the world’s second-largest platinum supplier,
warned customers last week that April deliveries may be half the
usual volumes.  Impala gained 2 percent to 167.10 rand at the 5 p.m. close
in Johannesburg. Platinum traded at $1,722.25 an ounce as of
5:30 p.m. compared with $1,737.25 earlier.  Operations Halted  About 5,000 rock-drill operators walked out last month
after they didn’t get a pay increase awarded to miners,
disrupting production. More mineworkers then didn’t report for
duty on Jan. 30, bringing the operation to a complete halt and
boosting global prices for the metal used in cars and jewelry.  Four were killed and at least 50 hurt in violent protests
and attacks on employees who continued to go to work. About
11,600 miners and 4,200 processing and services employees didn’t
participate in the work stoppage.  Of the 17,200 workers the company dismissed for striking
illegally, 13,500 had reapplied for jobs so far, including 3,000
rock-drill operators, Impala said today.  Impala will need to follow a careful startup process to
ensure it can get the mine going again safely, and this will
take some time, Theron said, adding the company won’t compromise
safety “to rush back into production.”  Impala said Feb. 25 that workers applying for jobs after
today won’t be reinstated and therefore won’t receive their
former conditions and benefits. They would be employed as new
employees.  To contact the reporters on this story:
