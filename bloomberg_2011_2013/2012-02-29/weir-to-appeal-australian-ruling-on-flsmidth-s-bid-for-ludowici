Weir Group Plc (WEIR) , the world’s biggest
maker of pumps for the  mining industry , plans to appeal an
Australian Takeovers Panel ruling allowing  FLSmidth (FLS)  & Co. to
raise a bid for  Ludowici (LDW)  Ltd., which Weir is also wants to buy.  Weir wants  FLSmidth (FLS)  to be held to a statement that it
wouldn’t increase its offer for Ludowici under the Australian
“truth in takeovers” policy, the Glasgow, Scotland-based
manufacturer said in a statement today.  Weir Chief Executive Officer Keith Cochrane declined to
comment further on a conference call with reporters today. Weir
offered A$10 a share on Feb. 23 for Ludowici,  Australia ’s
largest producer of hydraulic and pneumatic packaging and seals,
matching a bid by Valby, Denmark-based FLSmidth. FLSmidth has
since raised its offer to A$11 a share.  The U.K. company spent $851 million buying Seaboard
Holdings Inc. in November and Novatech LLC in January to expand
in the U.S. Acquiring Ludowici would cost another $320 million.  Weir fell as much as 5.8 percent to 2,077 pence, the
biggest intraday drop since Jan. 20, and was trading down 1.8
percent at 2,165 pence at 11:47 a.m. after Chris Dyett, an
 analyst  at  Investec Plc (INVP) , said the manufacturer’s cautious
forecast for the second half of 2012 would disappoint investors.  Net income  from continuing operations last year jumped 33
percent to 282.1 million pounds ($450 million), or 132.2 pence a
share. Earnings beat the average estimate of 268.9 million
pounds of nine analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  “We have a strong order book,” Cochrane said. “We expect
to make further good progress in 2012, with results in line with
current consensus expectations.”  The development of oil and liquid-rich gas shale formations
remains “very attractive,” even with a decline in U.S. gas
prices, Cochrane said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
