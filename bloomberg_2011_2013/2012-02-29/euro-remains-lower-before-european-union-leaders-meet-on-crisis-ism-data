The dollar and yen weakened before a
report that may show a U.S. manufacturing index rose for a
fourth straight month and after a similar gauge in China showed
an expansion, sapping demand for haven assets.  Higher-yielding currencies such as the Australian and  New
Zealand  dollars rose after Japanese companies’ capital spending
jumped by the most in almost five years in the fourth quarter,
brightening the outlook for global growth. Demand for the euro
was limited before European Union leaders meet in Brussels today
to discuss the region’s debt crisis.  “Risk-on sentiment is definitely on the table at the
moment,” said Justin Harper, head of research in Singapore at
IG Markets. “You’re seeing the  U.S. dollar , the yen -- safe
havens -- start to show some pressure there as people think
things are maybe getting better.”  The dollar slid 0.1 percent to $1.3341 per euro at 10:43
a.m. in  Tokyo  from the close in  New York  yesterday. The U.S.
currency was little changed at 81.18 yen. The yen weakened 0.2
percent to 108.31 per euro.  Australia’s dollar gained 0.3 percent to 87.34 yen and
climbed 0.2 percent to $1.0758. New Zealand’s currency added 0.3
percent to 67.88 yen. It bought 83.63 U.S. cents, 0.3 percent
higher than its close yesterday.  The Institute for Supply Management’s factory index rose to
an eight-month high of 54.5 from 54.1 in January, according to
the median estimate of economists surveyed by Bloomberg News
before the data today. Readings above 50 signal growth. A
separate report today may show consumer purchases in the world’s
largest economy increased 0.4 percent in January.  China ’s  purchasing managers’ index  rose to 51.0 from 50.5
in January, China’s statistics bureau and  logistics federation 
said in a statement today.  Japan ’s capital spending excluding
software rose 4.9 percent from a year earlier in the final three
months of 2011, after declining 11 percent in the previous
quarter, the  Finance Ministry  said today in Tokyo.  To contact the reporters on this story:
