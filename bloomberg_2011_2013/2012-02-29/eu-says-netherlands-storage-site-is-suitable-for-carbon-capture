The European Union said a storage
site off the coast of the Netherlands at a depth of more than 3
kilometers (1.9 miles) was suitable for a  carbon capture 
project.  “The opinion confirms the suitability of the chosen
storage location for the permanent storage of CO2, as was
demonstrated by a detailed characterization and assessment of
the storage site and complex,” the European Commission in
Brussels said today in a  statement  on its website.  The project was awarded 180 million euros ($242 million) of
funding under the European Energy Programme for Recovery, the EU
said.  After more than a decade on the political agenda, no carbon
capture plant is operating at a commercial scale. While smaller
facilities are demonstrating that so-called CCS technology can
work, none is attached to a plant generating more than about 50
megawatts of electricity, which is less than 10 percent of the
capacity of the average U.S. nuclear power reactor.  To contact the reporter on this story:
