Perrigo Co. (PRGO)  headed for the highest
close in six weeks in  Tel Aviv  as the U.S. Food & Drug
Administration is considering rule changes that would allow more
 prescription drugs  to be sold over-the-counter.  The shares of the maker of over-the-counter drugs rose 2.9
percent to 379.50 shekels at 1:56 p.m. in Tel Aviv, poised for
the highest close since Jan. 19. The shares have gained 7.5
percent this week.  “It’s definitely an interesting development to see the FDA
proactive about switching drugs and not just responding to
requests or applications,” said Jonathan Kreizman, analyst at
Clal Finance Batucha Brokerage Ltd.  The FDA will hold a public hearing on the matter next
month, it said on its website earlier this week.  To contact the reporter on this story:
