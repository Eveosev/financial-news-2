India ’s Gujarat state, home to the
country’s largest solar program, will issue a new policy next
month to draw more investments for sun-powered plants.  A solar policy issued in 2009 to invite companies to set up
plants is being revised before further capacity is awarded, Venu
Birappa, executive engineer of the state-run  Gujarat Energy
Transmission Corp. , said in an interview in Jaipur today. She
declined to give details as the policy hasn’t been completed.  The northwestern state was the first in India to issue
permits to companies for solar projects, awarding 958 megawatts
of capacity under its original policy. Of that, 455 megawatts of
plants have been completed, Birappa said. Another 145 megawatts
have been built and are awaiting connection to the grid by March
31, she said.  The remaining 358 megawatts of projects will miss the March
cut-off and will be paid 33 percent less for the electricity
they produce because the state-run power buyer has lowered the
tariff to be paid to delayed plants, she said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
