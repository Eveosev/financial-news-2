Italian two-year notes stayed
higher as euro-area banks tapped the  European Central Bank  for
more three-year cash than economists forecast.  The gains left the yield 21 basis points, or 0.21
percentage point, lower at 2.23 percent at 10:29 a.m. London
time. The Spanish two-year note yield fell eight basis points to
2.36 percent.  The ECB said today it will lend 800 financial institutions
529.5 billion euros ($712.2 billion) for 1,092 days. Economists
predicted an allotment of 470 billion euros, according to the
median of 28 estimates in a Bloomberg News survey. Banks
borrowed 489 billion euros in the first operation in December.  To contact the reporter on this story:
