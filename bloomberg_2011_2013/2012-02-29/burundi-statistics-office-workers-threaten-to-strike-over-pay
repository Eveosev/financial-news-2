Employees at the Burundi Institute
for Statistics and Economic Studies plan to go on strike after
not being paid for two months, said Jean-Marie Nkeshimana,
president of the Free Union of Isteebu Personnel.  Staff at the state-run institute, which publishes economic
statistics including monthly inflation data, haven’t received a
salary since December, Nkeshimana said in a phone interview
today from Bujumbura, the capital. He didn’t say when the strike
would begin.  “If we are not paid like all other civil servants, we will
strike because no one can ever agree to work without being
paid,” he said. The government is expected to respond to the
labor union’s demands in the “coming days,” he said.  The  Finance Ministry  suspended all salaries last month
while it calculated new salaries for a group of workers at the
institute who had demanded a pay increase, Nkeshimana said.  Finance Ministry spokesman Joseph Ndayikeza said he
couldn’t immediately comment when contacted today in Bujumbura.  To contact the reporter on this story:
