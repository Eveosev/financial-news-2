Hungary ’s benchmark BUX stock index
rose 0.4 percent to 19,286.54 at the close in Budapest. The
following were among the most active equities in the Hungarian
market today. Stock symbols follow company names.  OTP Bank Nyrt. (OTP)   climbed 1.2 percent to 3,998 forint
as Hungary’s largest lender unveiled a plan to help municipal
borrowers and euro-area banks tapped the European Central Bank
for more three-year cash than economists forecast.  Foldhitel es Jelzalogbank Nyrt.  (FHB HB), a Hungarian
mortgage lender, fell 1.2 percent to 579 forint. FHB’s 3.5
percent jump yesterday pushed the stock’s 14-day relative
strength index to 75. A reading above 70 indicates to some
technical analysts a security may decline. The RSI last stood at
71.  Magyar Telekom Nyrt. (MTEL)  , Hungary’s former phone
monopoly, rose 1.9 percent to 591 forint as government bond
yields fell, increasing the attractiveness of the company’s
dividends.  To contact the reporter on this story:
