Greek Prime Minister  Lucas Papademos 
won approval from parliament for changes to pensions and health
care linked to austerity measures to secure an international
bailout after at least 151 members of the chamber voted in favor
of the measure, according to a tally of votes by deputies.  The roll-call voting in  Athens  is being televised live on
state-run Vouli TV and is continuing.  To contact the reporter on this story:
