South Africa  posted a trade  deficit 
of 13.5 billion rand ($1.8 billion) in January, the biggest in
three years, as machinery imports surged and exports slumped.  The shortfall followed a surplus of 4.7 billion rand in
December, the Pretoria-based South African Revenue Service said
in an e-mailed statement today. The  median estimate  of eight
economists in a Bloomberg survey was for a deficit of 3.1
billion rand.  Exports may come under pressure this year as a debt crisis
in  Europe , which buys a third of South Africa’s manufactured
goods, pushes the region into recession. South Africa’s  current
account deficit , the broadest measure of trade in goods and
services, will probably widen to 4.3 percent of gross domestic
product this year from an estimated 3.3 percent in 2011, the
National Treasury said on Feb. 22.  “It does raise certain alarm bells,” Dennis Dykes, chief
economist at  Nedbank Group Ltd. (NED) , said in a telephone interview
from Johannesburg. The slowdown in Europe “must have played
some role. As we go deeper into this year it could play a bigger
impact.”  The rand was at 7.4473 against the dollar as of 3:28 p.m.
in Johannesburg from 7.4325 before the data was published. The
yield on the benchmark rand bond due in 2015 fell four basis
points, or 0.04 percentage point, to 6.61 percent.  Precious Metals  Exports dropped 14 percent from a month earlier to 54
billion rand in January, led by a 43 percent decrease in
vehicles and aircrafts and a 28 percent decline in precious
metals. Imports rose 16 percent to 67.5 billion rand, as
machinery shipments surged 20 percent.  Interest rates  at the lowest level in more than three
decades and rising credit demand may help fuel  consumer spending 
on imports. Growth in  borrowing  accelerated to 7.3 percent in
January, the fastest pace in more than two years, the  Reserve
Bank  said today. The central bank has kept its benchmark
 repurchase rate  at 5.5 percent since November 2010 to help
support the economy’s recovery.  The monthly trade figures are often volatile, reflecting
the timing of shipments of commodities such as oil and diamonds.  To contact the reporter on this story:
