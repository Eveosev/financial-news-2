Chancellor  Angela Merkel ’s Christian
Democratic Union-led bloc held its record support in the German
public for the fourth straight week as her Free Democratic Party
coalition partner gained, a poll showed.  Merkel’s CDU and its Bavarian sister party, the  Christian
Social Union , had 38 percent support among voters, according to
a Forsa poll commissioned by Stern magazine and RTL television.
That’s the highest level since Merkel formed a government in
2009 with the pro-business FDP, which gained 1 percentage point
to 3 percent.  A public spat between Merkel and the FDP leadership over
the appointment of former East German dissident Joachim Gauck to
the German presidency didn’t harm Merkel and may have helped the
FDP, Forsa said. The FDP on Feb. 19 joined the opposition in
supporting Gauck in the face of Merkel’s initial objection.  The opposition  Social Democratic Party  climbed 1 percent in
the poll to 26 percent, while the  Green Party  fell a percentage
point to 14 percent. The Left Party, former East Germany’s
communists, held at 8 percent, while the Internet-activist
Pirate Party slid a percentage point to 7 percent, according to
Forsa.  The poll surveyed 2,502 German voters between Feb. 20 and
24 and had a margin of error of 2.5 percentage points.  To contact the reporter on this story:
