Chinese equities  traded in the U.S.
posted a second monthly gain, led by companies dependent on
domestic consumption, on prospects the government will take
further steps to bolster the economy after lowering  reserve
requirements  on banks for the second time in three months.  The Bloomberg China-US 55 Index of the most-traded Chinese
stocks in the U.S. gained 4.7 percent last month after reaching
a six-month high of 109.09 on Feb. 16. Online game operator
 Shanda Games Ltd. (GAME)  and wealth manager  Noah Holdings Ltd. (NOAH)  jumped
more than 20 percent for the month. Digital advertising company
 Focus Media Holding Ltd. (FMCN)  surged after short seller  Muddy Waters 
LLC’s fifth report failed to convince investors.  Chinese Premier  Wen Jiabao  will target an 8 percent
economic growth this year in his report to the National People’s
Congress in Beijing on March 5, according to eight of 15
economists surveyed by Bloomberg. The People’s Bank of China cut
lenders’ reserve-requirement ratio on Feb. 24, the second time
since December, to provide credit support to businesses.  “The government has many tools to influence the
performance of the economy and we’ll see some stimulative
measures starting from the second quarter,” Alexander Muromcew,
who manages $500 million in emerging-market stocks at TIAA-CREF
Investment Management LLC in  San Francisco , said by phone
yesterday. “We continue to like the consumer sector. That tends
to be a general theme across my portfolio.”  China , the world’s second-largest economy,  expanded  8.9
percent in the last quarter of 2011, the least in two years. The
pace slowed to 9.2 percent last year from 10.4 percent in 2010.
 Exports (CNFREXPY)  from the nation, which counts the European Union as its
biggest trading partner, fell for the first time in two years in
January.  Noah Jumps  The Bloomberg China-US 55 index retreated 0.4 percent to
108.21 yesterday in New York. The measure’s gain in February
extended this year’s increase to 13 percent after the gauge lost
8.3 percent in 2011.  Noah, a Shanghai-based wealth management company, jumped 25
percent last month on prospects the regulators’ license allowing
it to distribute mutual funds in China will boost sales this
year. Its monthly gain was the biggest among members of the
Bloomberg measure of most-traded Chinese companies in the U.S.
Noah added 0.1 percent to $8.01 yesterday.  The company expects its 2012 net income to rise 15 percent
to 34 percent from last year to $35 million, according to a
statement issued after U.S. markets closed on Feb. 28. The
company said in the statement it will pay a cash dividend to
shareholders as of March 30. The payment, the first since the
company’s initial public offering in November 2010, will be 14
U.S. cents for each American depositary receipt of Noah, it
said.  ETF Climbs  Noah got a license to distribute mutual funds to high net-
worth individuals from China’s securities regulator, it said in
a Feb. 22 statement.  The  iShares FTSE China 25 Index Fund , the biggest Chinese
exchange-traded fund in the U.S., was little changed at $40.29
yesterday and gained 3.8 percent last month. The  Standard &
Poor’s 500 Index (SPX)  slipped 0.5 percent yesterday to 1,365.68,
trimming its monthly rally to 4.1 percent.  ADRs of Shanghai-based Shanda climbed 22 percent in
February, the most in four months, after fourth-quarter profit
reported Feb. 22 beat analysts’ predictions. Its shares added
0.5 percent yesterday in New York to $4.36.  Focus Media, based in  Shanghai , advanced for a second day,
climbing 1.2 percent yesterday to $24.26 and extending the
February gain to 21 percent. It has  rebounded  57 percent since
Muddy Waters issued its first report on Nov. 21 accusing the
company of overstating the size of its advertising network and
overpaying for acquisitions.  Chalco  Jiong Shao, an analyst at Macquarie Capital Securities
Ltd., maintained his “outperform” rating on the stock on Feb.
28. Ten of 13 analysts  recommended  a “buy” on the stock while
two rated it “hold,” according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Aluminum Corporation of China Ltd. , the nation’s biggest
producer of the metal, known as Chalco, retreated 2.1 percent
yesterday to $13.54 in New York, trimming its advance in
February to 11 percent. Chalco’s ADRs, each representing 25
common shares, traded 2.1 percent  below  its Hong Kong stock, the
biggest discount in two weeks. Its Shanghai-traded shares slid 1
percent yesterday to 7.51 yuan, the  equivalent  of $1.19.  The Shanghai Composite Index (SHCOMP)  fell for the first time in
nine days, sliding 1 percent to 2,428.49. The gauge has risen
5.9 percent in February.  Spreadtrum, Sohu  Spreadtrum Communications Inc. (SPRD) , a Chinese designer of
mobile-phone chips, fell to a six-month low after the company
provided a forecast for first-quarter sales that was below
analysts’ estimates. Its ADRs tumbled 18 percent yesterday to
$13.88, the lowest closing level since Aug. 8.  Shanghai-based Spreadtrum said sales in the first quarter
this year will be between $158 million and $163 million in a
statement yesterday. That was below the $171 million average
estimate of seven analysts compiled by Bloomberg. The company’s
forecast also compared with revenue of $192.2 million in the
previous three months.  Sohu.com Inc. (SOHU) , which owns the third-biggest online search
engine in China, slid 2.4 percent yesterday to $49.34. The
stock’s 17 percent slump last month was the worst performance
among companies on the Bloomberg China-US 55 index.  Sohu’s fourth-quarter profit unexpectedly declined from a
year ago, it said on Feb. 6. Its revenue forecast for this
quarter missed analysts’ estimates by as much as $21 million due
to slower growth in advertising revenue. Twelve out of 22
analysts recommended to “hold” the stock while the rest rated
it “buy,” according to Bloomberg data.  Youku, Tudou  Youku Inc. (YOKU)  and  Tudou Holdings Ltd. (TUDO) , China’s two biggest
video sharing websites, both climbed in February. Youku slid 1
percent yesterday to $25.14, trimming its monthly gain to 18
percent.  Youku is  scheduled  to report its fourth-quarter results on
March 14. Sales for the quarter probably rose 97 percent from a
year earlier to 300.07 million yuan ($47.7 million), according
to the average estimate of five analysts in a Bloomberg survey.
That would exceed the company’s previous forecast of 297.3
million yuan.  Tudou added 0.1 percent to $16.01 yesterday before
announcing fourth-quarter results after U.S. markets closed.  The China Federation of Logistics and Purchasing is due to
release a manufacturing index for this month today. The gauge
may rise to 50.9 from 50.5 in January, according to the median
estimate of 24 economists in a Bloomberg survey. The level 50 is
the dividing line between expansion and contraction.  To contact the reporter on this story:
