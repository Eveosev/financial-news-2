Soybeans, poised for the biggest
monthly advance since 2010 in  Chicago , rose to a five-month high
on signs of a second year of global shortage as South American
crops wilt amid a drought.  The oilseed has gained 9.6 percent in February, the most
since December 2010. Dry weather in South America has slashed
output and inventories are forecast by Jefferies Bache LLC to
drop 20 percent from the prior year. Oilseed stockpiles will
reach a three-year low of 74.1 million metric tons in the 2011-
12 season, researcher Oil World said yesterday.  “The dry weather in South America and the view that yields
are going down are starting to gather some momentum,” Neil Burgess, a Sydney-based analyst at Westpac Banking Corp., said
by e-mail. “The focus is turning to U.S. supplies and export
demand from  China .”  Soybeans for May delivery climbed 0.2 percent to $13.145 a
bushel by 1:15 p.m. London time on the Chicago Board of Trade.
Prices touched $13.15, the highest level for a most-active
contract since Sept. 22. A gain today would be the longest
winning streak since the eight sessions through Dec. 27.  Wheat for May delivery added 0.7 percent to $6.7275 a
bushel. The grain is poised to rise for a fourth month in five.
Hedge-fund managers and other large speculators may make
purchases to cover short positions, or bets on a decline, as
higher soybean futures buoy wheat prices.  Bearish Wagers  Speculative  short positions  in wheat outnumbered long
positions by 56,672 contracts in Chicago as of Feb. 21,
Commodity Futures Trading Commission figures showed. The dryness
in  South America  is supporting oilseed and grain prices.  “It’s the age-old excuse for any rally, but with the size
of the shorts in wheat, the move higher by beans is causing
people to short-cover,” said Christopher Gadd, an analyst at
Macquarie Bank Ltd. in London. “Wheat looks as if it’s going to
get more bearish as we get into the second quarter and see the
return of Black Sea wheat.”  Milling wheat for May delivery traded on NYSE Liffe in
Paris gained 1.2 percent to 208.25 euros ($280.45) a ton.  Corn for May delivery added 0.2 percent to $6.585 a bushel
in Chicago, set for an eighth climb in nine sessions. The grain
is up 3.1 percent this month.  To contact the reporters on this story:
