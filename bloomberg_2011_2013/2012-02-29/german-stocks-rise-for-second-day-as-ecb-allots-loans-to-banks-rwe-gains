German stocks  declined after Federal
Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke ’s damped speculation of further
quantitative easing to bolster the economy, paring the benchmark
 DAX Index (DAX) ’s best start to a year since 1988.  Daimler AG (DAI)  and Porsche SE paced declines.  Hochtief AG (HOT) 
retreated 5 percent after reporting a net loss and canceling its
dividend.  RWE AG (RWE) ,  Germany ’s second-biggest utility, rose 1.7
percent after Morgan Stanley said the company offered a “high
and safe” dividend yield.  Commerzbank AG (CBK) , the second-largest
German lender, advanced.  The DAX declined 0.5 percent to 6,856.08 at the close in
 Frankfurt . The gauge has still advanced  6.2 percent this month 
and  16 percent this year . The DAX posted its biggest January-
February gain since the data started in 1988, outperforming
every other national index in western  Europe  this year apart
from  Denmark . The broader HDAX Index fell 0.4 percent today.  “Adding liquidity has cut the risk of a shutdown of the
euro area and helped stock markets,” said Mikkel Petersen, a
senior equity adviser at Nordea Private Bank in Copenhagen, in a
note to clients. “The result of today’s auctions will affect
stock markets beyond today, and the more money allotted the
better it’ll be for the stock market.”  The ECB said today it will lend 800 financial institutions
529.5 billion euros for 1,092 days. Economists had predicted an
allotment of 470 billion euros, according to the median of 28
estimates in a Bloomberg News survey. In the ECB’s first three-
year operation in December, 523 banks borrowed 489 billion
euros.  Carmakers Slide  Bernanke told Congress gave no signal that the central bank
is considering additional measures to spur the economy.  A gauge of carmakers posted the second-biggest decline of
the 19 industry groups in the  Stoxx Europe 600 Index (SXXP) . Daimler,
the maker of Mercedes luxury sedans, slipped 1.4 percent to
45.40 euros. Porsche, the maker of the  Porsche 911 , declined 2.3
percent to 48.87 euros.  Hochtief, the German construction company controlled by ACS
Actividades de Construccion y Servicios SA, slumped 5 percent to
52.41 euros, its biggest decline this month. The builder, which
paid a 2-euro-a-share dividend for 2010, said it won’t propose a
payout to shareholders for 2011 because it posted a 160 million-
euro loss for the year. The company predicted that it will
return to profit in 2012.  Q-Cells SE (QCE)  dropped 2.9 percent to 30.5 euro cents and  SMA
Solar Technology AG (S92)  slipped 3.5 percent to 38.40 euros as a
spokeswoman said German Chancellor Angela Merkel’s Cabinet has
approved draft legislation cutting solar-power subsidies.  RWE (RWE)  added 1.7 percent to 34.20 euros after Exane BNP
Paribas upgraded the company to “outperform” from “neutral.”  Commerzbank AG climbed 1.5 percent to 1.89 euros, for the
second-largest advance in  the DAX .  To contact the reporter on this story:
