The  World Bank  said today that the
number of people living on less than $1.25 a day declined
between 2005 and 2008.  An estimated 1.29 billion people in 2008 lived in extreme
poverty, equal to 22 percent of the population of the developing
world, the World Bank said in an e-mailed release. By contrast,
1.94 billion people in 1981 were living below $1.25 a day.  The
reduction over the period “marks a first since the Bank began
monitoring extreme poverty,” it said.  Analysis since 2008 shows that, “while the food, fuel and
financial crises over the past four years had at times sharp
negative impacts on vulnerable populations and slowed the rate
of poverty reduction in some countries, global poverty overall
kept falling,” the release said.  “The crisis certainly caused a lot of pain and suffering
around the world but the momentum in reducing poverty has been
maintained,” Martin Ravallion, director of the Bank’s research
group, said in a press conference.  The percentage of those living in extreme poverty dropped
in every region of the developing world, the release said.
Preliminary estimates for 2010 -- based on a smaller sample size
than in the global update -- indicate that the $1.25-a-day
 poverty rate  had fallen to under half of its 1990 proportion by
2010, the Bank said.  ‘Less Progress’  “We’ve made less progress in getting people over the $2-a-
day line,” Ravallion said during the press conference.  The
release  said there was only a “modest drop” in the number of
people living below $2 a day, from 2.59 billion in 1981 to 2.47
billion in 2008, though the level has been falling more sharply
since 1999.  The progress made by sub-Saharan Africa in reducing extreme
poverty is particularly notable, Ravallion said in the press
conference. Less than half its population, 47 percent, lived
below $1.25 a day for the first time since 1981, with 9 million
fewer people living at that level in 2008 than 2005, the report
said.  East Asia  and the Pacific region had about 14 percent of
its population living in extreme poverty in 2008, down from 77
percent in 1981 when the region had the highest poverty rate in
the world, the release said. In  China , 13 percent or 173 million
people, lived below $1.25 in 2008.  ‘Excellent Conditions’  “China had excellent conditions for economic growth and
poverty reduction,” Ravallion said.  Widespread access to
health and education and generally low inequality made it easier
for China to reduce poverty with economic growth, he said.  The World Bank has also seen “a lot of progress” in  Latin
America  in reducing poverty, which, in contrast to China, had
greater levels of  inequality , he said. “ Brazil  had the dubious
distinction” of one of the highest levels of inequality but has
had a turnaround in social policies, he said.  “Despite the crisis in 2008 and 2009 the reduction in
poverty has been sharp” in Latin America, said Jaime Saavedra,
director of the World Bank’s Poverty Reduction and Equity Group,
during the press conference.  For Latin American and the Caribbean, the poverty rate fell
to a record low of 6.5 percent in 2008 from a peak of 14 percent
living below $1.25 a day in 1984, the release said.  Biggest Threat  The biggest threat to continuing to reduce poverty levels
would be economic contraction, Ravallion said. The leader of the
team that produced the numbers said initially he was
“pessimistic” about the ability of  developing countries  to
sustain the reduction of extreme poverty during the financial
crisis of 2008-2009 because fiscal stabilization efforts have
come too late in the past. “I was proven wrong,” Ravallion
said.  “This time, they got it right,” he said. “In the end,
the governments did the right thing,” he added, noting  India ’s
efforts in particular. “India was lucky because it was pumping
up a huge anti-poverty program just as the crisis came,” he
said.  While there has been a lot of progress, with 43 percent of
the population living below $2 a day, “we still have
homework,” Saavedra said. Growth is still high in the
developing world but the fiscal space that countries have to
react “is smaller than in 2008 or 2009,” he said.  In terms of making further progress, “there is no one
single recipe and the attack on poverty has to be on multiple
fronts,” he said. “Making sure growth generates more and
better jobs will have a huge dent on poverty.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
