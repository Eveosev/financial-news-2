MP banki hf  reported a 484 million
kronur ($3.9 million) loss in 2011, the Icelandic lender’s first
year of operations.  Operating revenue was 1.83 billion kronur while office
costs were 2.12 billion, the Reykjavik-based bank said today in
a  statement  on its website.  “The bank’s loan portfolio has grown consistently,”
Sigurdur Atli Jonsson, the bank’s chief executive officer, said
in the statement. “The growth is in accordance with our plans
and emphasis on supporting small and medium size corporations in
the resurrection of Iceland’s economy.”  MP’s capital-adequacy ratio was 19.2 percent of its risk-
weighted assets at the end of December, the lender said. The
country’s  Financial Supervisory Authority  requires banks to have
a capital buffer of no less than 16 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
