The  New Orleans Saints  will meet the
 Arizona Cardinals  to open the National Football League’s
preseason in the Pro Football Hall of Fame Game on Aug. 5 in
Canton, Ohio.  The game will be televised on the NFL Network with kickoff
scheduled for 8 p.m. Eastern time, the NFL said today in a
statement. The Hall of Fame’s 2012 class -- Jack Butler,
Dermontti Dawson, Chris Doleman, Cortez Kennedy,  Curtis Martin 
and former Saints tackle Willie Roaf -- will be enshrined the
day before.  Roaf is the second player elected to the Hall of Fame from
the Saints, who will be making their fifth appearance in the
game. The Cardinals played in the first Hall of Fame Game in
1962, tying the New York Giants 21-21.  The NFL said yesterday it will open the 2012 regular season
on Sept. 5, when the Super Bowl champion Giants will host an
opponent to be determined.  To contact the reporter on this story:
