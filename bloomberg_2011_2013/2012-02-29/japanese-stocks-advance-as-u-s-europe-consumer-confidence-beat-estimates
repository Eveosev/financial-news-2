Japan ’s  Topix Index (TPX)  fell, reversing
gains in the last hour of trading, after a sharp increase in the
yen’s strength clouded the earnings outlook for exporters.  Toyota Motor Corp. and  Sony Corp. (6758)  dropped.  Elpida (6665)  Memory
Inc., the chipmaker which this week filed Japan’s biggest
bankruptcy in two years, plunged 97 percent after limits were
removed on how much the stock could fall in a day. Fuji Electric
Co. slid 4.5 percent after saying some of its money was managed
by AIJ Investment Advisors Co., a firm that’s unable to account
for clients’ money.  The Topix, Japan’s broadest equities index, slid 0.3
percent to 835.96 at the 3 p.m. close in  Tokyo , ending a five-
day winning streak. The  Nikkei 225 Stock Average (NKY)  was little
changed at 9,723.24 after earlier rising as much as 1.5 percent.  “Exchange rates are bouncing around,” said Naoteru Teraoka, general manager at Tokyo-based Chuo Mitsui Asset
Management Co., which oversees about $29.6 billion. “Investors
won’t be able to buy more unless the yen takes a clear weakening
direction.”  Sony, Japan’s biggest export of consumer electronics,
finished the day down 2 percent at 1,737 yen, after rising as
much as 1.4 percent.  Toyota (7203) , which relies on  North America  for
about 30 percent of its sales, fell 0.9 percent to 3,355 yen.  The yen appreciated to as high as 80.26 against the dollar
today in Tokyo. A stronger yen cuts the value of repatriated
income for Japanese companies.  Overheating Signs  Shares gained early in the day even as technical indicators
suggested the market was overbought after a rally that has
boosted the Topix 15 percent this year. The 25-day  Toraku (TORAKU)  index,
an indicator of market momentum, exceeded the 120 threshold that
suggests the market may be poised to fall. The gauge has been
above the level that indicates overheating for 13 days.  Oil companies  declined after crude for April delivery fell
1.9 percent to $106.55 a barrel yesterday in  New York , the
biggest drop since Jan. 20.  Inpex Corp. (1605) , Japan’s biggest oil
explorer, slid 0.9 percent to 577,000 yen. Japan Petroleum
Exploration Co. lost 0.6 percent to 3,945 yen.  Elpida tumbled 97 percent to 7 yen after the Tokyo Stock
Exchange removed bid and offer limits on the chipmaker’s shares,
which are set to be delisted on March 28. Elpida filed for
bankruptcy on Feb. 27.  Investing With AIJ  Fuji Electric dropped 4.5 percent to 211 yen. The maker of
vending machines and factory equipment said yesterday it
invested 9.3 billion yen with AIJ Investment Advisors, which
regulators suspended on Feb. 24 after it couldn’t account for
all of the money it managed for clients, sparking the biggest
investigation in the history of the nation’s fund industry.  The  Topix (TPX)  has risen 6.3 percent since Feb. 14, when the
 Bank of Japan  increased its bond purchases, weakening the yen.
The  value  of stocks listed on the index has risen to 1.02 times
book value, up from 0.88 in December, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg. A number below 1 means companies can be bought for
less than value of their assets.  Among stocks that rose today,  Advantest Corp. (6857)  gained 2.3
percent to 1,146 yen after Daiwa Securities Group Inc. lifted
the investment rating for the maker of memory-chip testers to
“outperform” from “neutral.” Chip-related companies also got
a boost after the  Philadelphia Semiconductor Index (SOX)  gained 1.6
percent yesterday, the biggest rise since Feb. 16. Sumco Corp.
added 1.5 percent to 874 yen.  -- With assistance from Toshiro Hasegawa in Tokyo. Editors:
