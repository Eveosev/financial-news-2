GDF Suez SA (GSZ)  will invest more than
100 million euros ($134 million) in  Romania  this year in wind
and gas projects, exceeding its annual investment average, said
 Eric Stab , GDF Suez’s country manager in Romania.  The operator of Europe’s biggest natural-gas network will
invest about 75 million euros in a 48-megawatt windfarm in
eastern Romania, to be completed in November, and the remainder
in its gas business, Stab said in a Bucharest interview
yesterday. GDF Suez has invested between 60 million euros and
100 million euros on average in past years in Romania and about
75 million euros in 2011.  Romania investment incentives in renewable energy have
lured companies, including  CEZ AS (CEZ)  and  Iberdrola SA (IBE) , with plans
to build the continent’s largest land-based windparks in the
southern Black Sea region of Dobrogea, where the average wind
speed is about 25.2 kilometers per hour (15.7 miles per hour).  “We’re going to invest more because of our windfarm
project and it’s going to be a bit over 100 million euros,”
Stab said. “We have some other projects in the pipeline, mostly
in the renewable sector, in wind as well, but not only” that
industry.  To contact the reporter on this story:
