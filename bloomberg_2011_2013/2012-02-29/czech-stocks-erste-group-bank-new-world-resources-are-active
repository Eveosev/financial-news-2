The Czech Republic’s  PX (PX)  stock index
rose 1.3 percent to 1,005.6 by 1:03 p.m. in Prague, headed for
the highest close in a week.  The following are among the most active equities in the
Czech market today. Stock symbols follow company names.  Erste Group Bank AG (EBS)   jumped 4.1 percent to 467.5
koruna after the Austrian lender published fourth-quarter profit
that exceeded analysts’ estimates and said it is close to
filling its capital shortfall.  New World Resources Plc (NWR)   rose 1.3 percent to 158.4
koruna. The biggest Czech coking-coal producer earlier jumped as
much as 4.2 percent after the  Daily Telegraph  reported that
Polish rival Jastrzebska Spolka Weglowa SA held talks to merge
with NWR. The stock pared the rally after Jaroslaw Zagorowski,
the chief executive officer of JSW, denied the report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
