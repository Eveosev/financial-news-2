Russia , the worldâ€™s largest oil
producer, may lower the export duty for heavy crude to 10
percent of the standard rate as it seeks to stimulate
production, according to Kommersant newspaper.  A government commission headed by Deputy Prime Minister
 Igor Sechin  approved the Energy Ministry proposal, which would
extend the discount for heavy, or viscous, oils for 10 years
from July 1, Kommersant  reported , without citing any sources.  The lower duty would save companies $100 million a year at
current production levels of heavy crude and could provide as
much as $1.3 billion in annual tax savings if output of that
grade increases according to Energy Ministry forecasts, the
newspaper said.  Heavier crude grades yield less lucrative products such as
gasoline and diesel compared with lighter blends and typically
contain more sulfur.  To contact the reporter on this story:
