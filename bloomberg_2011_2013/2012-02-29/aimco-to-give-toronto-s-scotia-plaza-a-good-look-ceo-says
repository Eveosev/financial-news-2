Alberta Investment Management Corp.,
the Canadian pension fund manager, may consider bidding for  Bank
of Nova Scotia (BNS) ’s Scotia Plaza office tower in Toronto, Chief
Executive Officer Leo de Bever said.  “This building is being aggressively marketed to all the
usual suspects,” de Bever said today in an e-mailed statement.
“It’s a good building, so AIMCo will give it a good look for
whether it adds value for our strategy.”  Bank of  Nova Scotia  said last month it may sell the Toronto
office tower, the corporate headquarters for Canada’s third-
biggest bank. The 68-floor office building is the second-tallest
in Canada after First Canadian Place,  Bank of Montreal (BMO) ’s head
office.  Canada Pension Plan Investment Board, the country’s second-
largest pension fund manager, and Ontario Municipal Employees
Retirement System have also said they’d consider a bid for the
building.  To contact the reporter on this story:
