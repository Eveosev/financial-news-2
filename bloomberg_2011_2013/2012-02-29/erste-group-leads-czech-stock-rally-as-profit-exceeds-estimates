Erste Group Bank AG (RBAG)  led Czech stocks
higher after the Austrian company published fourth-quarter net
income that exceeded analystsâ€™ estimates and said it is close to
filling its capital shortfall.  The stock jumped as much as 4.7 percent before paring its
gain to 3.1 percent at 463 koruna by 10:06 a.m. in  Prague ,
headed for its biggest one-day gain in three weeks. The  PX (PX)  share
index, where Erste has a 22 percent weighting, rose 0.9 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
