Icelandic support for joining the
European Union declined this month, a Capacent Gallup poll
commissioned by the  Federation of Icelandic Industries  showed.  Support for joining the EU fell to 26.3 percent from 37
percent, according to the  poll , published on the pro-membership
groupâ€™s website. Opposition to joining the 27-nation bloc fell
to 56.2 percent from 63 percent in a January survey.  Capacent Gallup polled 1,350 people from Jan. 12 through
Jan. 20. Of those questioned, 64.2 percent answered. The margin
of error was 0.1 percent.  Iceland started EU accession talks in 2010 and the
government has said it targets a referendum on membership as
early as next year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
