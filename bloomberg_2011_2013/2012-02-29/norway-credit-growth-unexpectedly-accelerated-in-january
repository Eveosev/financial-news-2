Norwegian  credit growth  accelerated
in January after the country’s central bank cut  interest rates 
to protect the economy from the fallout of  Europe ’s debt crisis.  Credit growth was 6.9 percent in January, up from 6.7
percent in December, the Oslo-based statistics agency said
today. It was estimated to remain unchanged, according to the
median forecast of six analysts.  The central bank in December lowered its main rate by half
a percentage point to 1.75 percent, its biggest cut since May
2009, to avoid excessive krone gains and guard against the
fallout of Europe’s debt crisis. Low borrowing costs coupled
with stable unemployment have encouraged households to take on
more debt. Governor Oeystein Olsen said this week that consumer
debt as a percentage of disposable income has reached a record
level at 220 percent.  Credit growth has fueled real estate investments. Norway’s
house prices rose an annual 8.4 percent in January, according to
the Real Estate Brokers Association.  Robert Shiller , the co-creator of the S&P/Case-Shiller
home-price index, said in January Norway is in the grip of a
house price bubble, while the  International Monetary Fund  on
Feb. 2 warned of real estate and credit market risks in Norway.  To contact the reporter on this story:
