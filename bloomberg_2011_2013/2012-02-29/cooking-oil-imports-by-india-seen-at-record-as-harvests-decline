Cooking-oil imports by  India , the
biggest  palm oil  buyer, will climb as much as 12 percent to a
record after dry weather and excessive rain curbed oilseed
crops, according to  GG Patel & Nikhil Research Co .  Purchases will total 9.2 million metric tons to 9.4 million
tons in the year that began on Nov. 1, compared with 8.37
million a year earlier, said Managing Partner Govindlal G.
Patel, who has traded vegetable oils for more than three
decades. India bought a record 8.82 million tons in 2009-2010.  The tropical oil, used in everything from candy bars to
biofuels, advanced to the highest level in eight months on Feb.
28 as dry weather cut soybean harvests in  South America . Global
inventories of soybean and palm oils will drop to 7.84 million
tons by the end of 2011-2012, the lowest in four years, U.S.
Department of Agriculture data show. About 80 percent of India’s
purchases consist of palm oil.  It’s “a cheaper option for India,” Ryan Long, vice
president of futures and options at OSK Investment Bank Bhd.,
said by phone from  Kuala Lumpur . “Higher demand from India will
support palm-oil prices.”  The May-delivery contract gained 0.5 percent to 3,285
ringgit ($1,094) a ton on the Malaysia Derivatives Exchange
today. Futures, which have rallied from a 12-month low of 2,754
ringgit on Oct. 6, may reach 4,000 ringgit by June as demand
growth outstrips production, according to Dorab Mistry, director
of Godrej International Ltd.  Malaysian Exports  Shipments (PEXPCPO)  from  Malaysia  may jump to a record 19.8 million
tons in 2012 from last year’s 18 million tons, aided by rising
demand in India and  China , Lee Yeow Chor, chairman of the
Malaysian Palm Oil Council, said last month.  Exports (POEXINDI)  to India
climbed 25 percent to 460,220 tons in the four months ended Feb.
29 from a year earlier, according to surveyor  Societe Generale 
de Surveillance.  Oilseeds production in India may drop to 30.5 million tons
in the year ending June 30 from 32.48 million tons a year
earlier, according to the farm ministry.  The soybean harvest was damaged in Madhya Pradesh state,
the biggest grower, because of excessive rains, while the
mustard harvest crop will decline after dry weather in November
and December curbed yields, Patel said.  A lower crop may boost domestic oilseed prices by 20
percent in June from a year earlier, said Sujan Hajra, the chief
economist at Anand Rathi Financial Services Ltd. in Mumbai. The
wholesale oilseeds-price index climbed 13 percent in January
from a year earlier, according to the commerce ministry.  Cooking-oil imports climbed 2.9 percent to 2.13 million
tons in the three months ended Jan. 31 from a year earlier, the
Solvent Extractors’ Association of India said on Feb. 14. Palm-
oil purchases rose 4.9 percent to 1.8 million tons, it said.
Consumption may gain 3.8 percent to 16.3 million tons in
2011-2012 from 15.7 million tons a year earlier, said Patel.  To contact the reporters on this story:
