Stanbic IBTC Bank Plc (IBTCCB) , a unit of
 Standard Bank Group Ltd. (SBK) , rose to its highest close in five
weeks on speculation the stock’s decline is overdone.  The shares rose 5 percent, the daily limit, to 7.39 naira
by the end of trading in Lagos, its highest since Jan. 23. That
pares its decline for the year to 11 percent, compared with a
2.9 percent drop in the Nigerian Stock Exchange All-Share Index
in the same period.  “The stock is attractive at current valuations given the
weakness on the price in the last few weeks,” Abiola Rasaq, a
Lagos-based analyst with Vetiva Capital Management Limited, said
by phone today. Vetiva has a price target of 8.58 naira on the
stock for the year, according to Razaq.  Earnings are climbing for the Lagos-based lender after
 Nigeria ’s central bank implemented reforms following a debt
crisis in 2008 and 2009 triggered by loans given to stock market
speculators. Profit for the nine months through September rose
10 percent to 7.9 billion naira ($50 million) on higher revenue,
Stanbic said on Oct. 28.  To contact the reporter on this story:
