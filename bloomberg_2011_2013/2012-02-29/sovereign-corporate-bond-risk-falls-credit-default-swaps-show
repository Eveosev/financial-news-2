The cost of insuring against default
on European sovereign and corporate debt fell, according to BNP
Paribas SA prices for credit-default swaps.  The Markit iTraxx SovX Western Europe Index of swaps on 15
governments dropped 2.5 basis point to 339.5 at 8:15 a.m. in
London. A decline signals improvement in perceptions of  credit
quality .  Contracts on the Markit iTraxx Crossover Index of 50
companies with mostly high-yield credit ratings decreased 7.5
basis points to 556.5. The Markit iTraxx Europe Index of 125
companies with investment-grade ratings fell one basis point to
127.5 basis points.  The Markit iTraxx Financial Index linked to senior debt of
25 banks and insurers decreased 4.5 basis points to 198.5 and
the subordinated index dropped eight to 341.  A basis point on a credit-default swap protecting 10
million euros ($13.5 million) of debt from default for five
years is equivalent to 1,000 euros a year. Swaps pay the buyer
face value in exchange for the underlying securities or the cash
equivalent should a borrower fail to adhere to its debt
agreements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
