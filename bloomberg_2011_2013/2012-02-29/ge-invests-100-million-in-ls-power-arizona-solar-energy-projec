A  General Electric Co. (GE)  unit bought a
$100 million stake in a 127-megawatt solar project that LS Power
Group is developing in Arizona.  The $550 million Arlington Valley Solar Energy II project
near Arlington, Arizona, is expected to be complete at the end
of 2013 and will sell power to  Sempra Energy (SRE) ’s San Diego Gas &
Electric Co., Stamford, Connecticut-based GE Energy Financial
Services Inc. said today in a statement.  GE Energy Financial Services more than doubled its
investment in solar energy in the past year to more than $1.4
billion. The company has backed projects in Australia, Canada,
Italy, Portugal, the U.S. and Spain valued at almost $5 billion.  Solar projects offer returns that are comparable to GE’s
other energy investments, said Kevin Walsh, managing director
and leader of power and renewable energy at GE Energy Financial
Services. He expects to back more large-scale solar projects.  “Solar will continue to be a bigger part of the picture,”
he said in an interview today.  Prudential Financial Inc. (PRU) ,  Banco Santander SA (SAN) , and other
commercial banks and investors provided debt financing for
Arlington Valley.  Fluor Corp. (FLR)  is building the project and will
maintain and operate it.  To contact the reporter on this story:
