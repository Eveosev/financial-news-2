A pair of chopped legs in bunched-up
white socks and New Balance sneakers greets visitors in the
foyer of the Luhring Augustine gallery in  Manhattan ’s Chelsea
art district.  Made of Styrofoam and paint, “Untitled (nobody)” sets the
tone for Tom Friedman’s solo debut at the gallery.  Ranging from tiny to gigantic, hyper-realist to abstract,
most pieces combine meticulous execution with imperfect, even
sloppy, subjects and big-boy humor.  There’s an 8-foot-tall stainless-steel figure of a peeing
man with his pants around the ankles.  Next door, red apples are scattered on the floor, each
bitten into and featuring teeth marks. There is also a wrinkled
sheet of white paper pinned to the wall, depicting another sheet
of white paper pinned to the wall.  Prices range from $65,000 to $475,000. The show runs
through March 17 at 531 W. 24th St.; +1-212-206-9100;

midtown locations, includes many of the art world’s top players.
Simon de Pury, chairman of auction house Phillips de Pury & Co.,
sits in an armchair with the artist Anh Duong sprawling naked in
his lap (he has since married Michaela Neumeister).  The setting is often domestic or relaxing: beaches,
backyards, swimming pools. Fischl contrasts meaty, robust
brushstrokes with flattened-out areas, sunlight with deep
shadows.  Here’s  Paul Simon  in baggy jeans, with wife Edie Brickell;
the sunlight almost bleaches his T-shirt. A nude Andrew J. Hall,
head of Astenbeck Capital Management LLC, is seen on a St.
Bart’s beach with his wife.  Other canvases star billionaire philanthropist Eli Broad
without his trademark red tie, but otherwise clothed; actor
 Steve Martin , tennis player  John McEnroe  and model Stephanie Seymour.  Prices range from $100,000 to $1.2 million. The show runs
through March 17 at 541 W. 24th St. and 745 Fifth Ave.; +1-212-
752-2929;  http://maryboonegallery.com .  Concrete Blocks  Architecture and sculpture come together in Ned Smyth’s
lyrical concrete compositions from 1973 to 1976 at  Salomon
Contemporary  gallery.  Small blocks, slender arches and narrow planks are arranged
on the floor or lean against the walls, their configurations
evocative of Minimalist sculpture, Romanesque cathedrals and
ancient ruins. Each varies subtly in color and texture.  Prices range from $12,000 to $60,000. The show, “Ned
Smyth: Reverence,” runs through March 17 at 526 W. 26th St.;
