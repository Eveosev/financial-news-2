Overseas  investors  bought a net  8.57
billion rupees  ($174.3 million) of Indian stocks yesterday,
raising their investment in the equities this year to 355.7
billion rupees, according to the nation’s market regulator.  Foreigners bought 29.6 billion rupees of shares and sold 21
billion rupees, the Securities & Exchange Board of  India  said on
its  website  today. The flows helped the benchmark BSE India
Sensitive Index post its best January gain since 1994 and fueled
the rupee’s record monthly advance.  Overseas investors bought a net 24.7 billion rupees of
bonds, taking total inflow into debt this year to 259.9 billion
rupees, the data  show . They invested 421 billion rupees in bonds
last year.  Foreigners have invested 4.8 trillion rupees in stocks and
1.467 trillion rupees in bonds since they were allowed into the
country in 1993. Investments in debt increased after Prime
Minister  Manmohan Singh ’s government raised the cap on foreign
ownership of local currency bonds by 20 percent to $60 billion
in November to stem a slide in the rupee. The currency tumbled
16 percent in 2011,  Asia ’s worst performer.  India’s $1.2 trillion stock market, Asia’s fifth-biggest,
is influenced by flows from overseas. Inflows from abroad surged
to a record in 2010, making the Sensex the best performer among
the world’s top 10 markets. The largest-ever outflow in 2008 led
to the biggest annual slump of 52 percent.  Offshore funds pulled out 27.1 billion rupees from local
equities last year, compared with record flows of 1.33 trillion
rupees in 2010, as  Europe ’s debt crisis threatened the global
economy and cooled demand for emerging-market assets. That led
to a 25 percent drop in the  Sensex (SENSEX) , the second worst annual
loss, and sent the rupee to an all-time low.  The regulator provides data on shares bought and sold by
large investors, including trades in the primary and secondary
markets, with a delay of at least a day.  To contact the reporter on this story:
