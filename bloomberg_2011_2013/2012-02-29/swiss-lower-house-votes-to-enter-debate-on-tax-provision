Switzerland ’s lower house voted to
enter a debate on an amendment to a 2009 double-taxation
agreement with the U.S. allowing so-called group requests in
cases of suspected  tax evasion .  The amendment will allow U.S. authorities to obtain data on
groups of American clients holding Swiss bank accounts without
knowing their identities. While the debate continues on Monday,
the vote suggests the amendment will be approved, according to
officials and lawmakers in the Swiss capital, Bern.  “The vote clearly indicates that the lower house will
eventually also approve the amendment,” Parliament spokeswoman
Marie-Jose Portmann said in a telephone interview.  Switzerland and the U.S. are holding talks to resolve an
investigation involving 11 Swiss financial firms after the
 Department of Justice  indicted Wegelin & Co. on Feb. 2 for
allegedly helping customers hide money from the Internal Revenue
Service. The amendment would “significantly increase” the
amount of client data eligible for administrative assistance,
the Swiss government said last week.  There were 116 lawmakers in favor of entering the debate on
the amendment with 51 against and eight abstentions. The  Swiss
People’s Party  voted against the debate.  “After the decision to enter into the debate, it’s all but
sure that the government proposal will be adopted on Monday,”
said Ada Marra, a lawmaker for the Swiss Social Democrats.  To contact the reporter on this story:
