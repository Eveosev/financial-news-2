German stocks declined as the
benchmark DAX Index fell 0.6 percent to 6,846.51 at 4:52 p.m.
after Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke â€™s remarks to
Congress damped speculation of more quantitative easing.  The index of 30 companies traded on the Frankfurt Stock
Exchange erased an earlier gain of as much as 1.2 percent after
the  European Central Bank  alloted 529.5 billion euros to 800
financial institutions in 3-year loans.  To contact the reporter on this story:
