U.K.  consumer confidence  held at the
highest since June last month as slowing inflation eased
pressure on consumers, GfK NOP Ltd. said.  An index of sentiment remained at minus 29 from January,
the strongest reading since June, the London-based research
group said in an e-mailed report today. A measure of Britons’
outlook for the economy rose 4 points to minus 29.  U.K.  inflation  slowed to the weakest in 14 months in
January, and consumer spending rose for the first time in 1 1/2
years in the fourth quarter. Still,  Bank of England  Governor
 Mervyn King  said Feb. 15 the recovery will be “slow and
uncertain” as  Europe ’s sovereign debt crisis weighs on growth.  Today’s report provides “grounds for cautious optimism,”
Nick Moon, GfK Social Research managing director, said in a
statement. “Next month’s results will determine whether we are
seeing the beginnings of a sustained improvement in  consumer
confidence , or whether this is merely a steadying of the ship.”  An index of shoppers’ assessment of the economy over the
previous 12 months fell 2 points to minus 60. A measure of the
climate for making major purchases dropped 5 points to minus 27.  A gauge of Britons’ personal situation over the previous
year rose 1 point to minus 21, and of their situation in the
coming 12 months gained 3 points to minus 6, the highest since
May. GfK interviewed 2,000 people from Feb. 3 to Feb. 12.  Inflation slowed to 3.6 percent last month as an increase
in  sales tax  last year dropped out of calculations. Policy
makers forecast price gains will slow further this year as the
recovery struggles to gain traction.  While  consumer spending  rose 0.5 percent in the fourth
quarter,  gross domestic product  fell 0.2 percent, the  Office for
National Statistics  said Feb. 24.  The Bank of England’s quarterly forecasts published this
month show the economy expanding 1.25 percent this year, and
picking up to 2.76 percent in 2013. The bank expanded its  bond-
purchase program  by 50 billion pounds ($79 billion) to 325
billion pounds this month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
