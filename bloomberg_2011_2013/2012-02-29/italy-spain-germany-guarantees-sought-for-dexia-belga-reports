Belgium will ask Italy, Spain and
 Germany  to take a share of the government guarantees on  Dexia
SA (DEXB) â€™s borrowings because the French-Belgian lender has units and
public-finance loans in those countries, Belga news agency
reported, citing Belgian Finance Minister Steven Vanackere.  Vanackere told lawmakers in a committee of the Belgian
parliament in Brussels today that the circle of guarantors
should be expanded, according to Belga. Italy, Spain and Germany
also have an interest in the rescue of Dexia, the newswire said,
citing Vanackere.  To contact the reporter on this story:
