Kenya Electricity Generating Co. (KEGC) ,
the East African nation’s biggest power producer, said it will
seek “concessionary funding” for the $745 million needed to
drill 209 geothermal wells over the next four years.  The company, based in Nairobi, plans to drill 168 wells
from 2012 to 2014 and 41 wells in the 2015-16 period, Managing
Director Eddy Njoroge told reporters today in the capital.  KenGen, as it’s known, expects to produce 585 megawatts of
electricity from geothermal sources by 2018, he said. The
company is also targeting production of 80 megawatts of thermal
power and 120 megawatts of  wind energy  by 2014, Njoroge said.  “KenGen has in total acquired seven drilling rigs to
enable it meet the ambitious targets,” the company said in a
statement handed to reporters.  KenGen yesterday reported first-half profit jumped 33
percent to 1.19 billion shillings ($14.4 million) as revenue
increased to 7.8 billion shillings from 6.6 billion shillings.
The company currently has an installed capacity of 1,185
megawatts, Njoroge said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
