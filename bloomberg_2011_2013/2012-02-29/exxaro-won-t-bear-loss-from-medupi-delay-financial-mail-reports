Exxaro Resources Ltd. (EXX)  shareholders
won’t bear any loss in value because of delays of at least a
year in the Medupi power plant, Financial Mail reported, citing
Chief Executive Officer Sipho Nkosi.  Exxaro’s contract with Eskom Holdings SOC Ltd. to supply
coal to Medupi from May is on a take-or-pay basis and  South
Africa ’s electricity utility will have to pay for the coal
whether it’s used or not, the Johannesburg-based magazine said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
