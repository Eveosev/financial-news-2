CME Group Inc. (CME) , the world’s largest
futures exchange, said there is no indication of erroneous
trading in 10-year Treasury futures contracts today after
Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  spoke.  The June 2012 10-year note futures contract slid from
about 131 11/32 to the day’s low of 130 23/32 in the five or so
minute after Bernanke’s comments were released. That corresponds
to a drop of $625 per $100,000 contract.  Bernanke affirmed that  interest rates  are likely to stay
low at least through late 2014 without offering any indication
that further monetary easing is under consideration. He
testified to the House Financial Services Committee in
Washington.  “There were no issues that were reported,” said  Michael Shore , a spokesman for the Chicago-based futures exchange owner.
“We have not called any trades into question and have no
reports of error trades.”  The contract had changed hands 1.36 million times today as
of 2 p.m. in Chicago, Shore said. That compares with an average
daily volume this year to date in the 10-year futures of 1.13
million, he said.  Trading volume in the contract was 2.77 million yesterday and 3.12
million the day before, Shore said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
