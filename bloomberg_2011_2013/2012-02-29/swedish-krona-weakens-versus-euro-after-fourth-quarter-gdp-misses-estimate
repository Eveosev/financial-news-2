Sweden’s krona slid against the euro
and was weaker against all of its 16 major peers after a report
showed the nation’s economy contracted more than analysts
estimated in the fourth quarter.  The krona slipped 0.2 percent to 8.8321 per euro at 8:35
a.m. London time. It was 0.1 percent weaker versus the dollar at
6.5587.  Gross domestic product fell a seasonally adjusted 1.1
percent in the three months through December, Stockholm-based
 Statistics Sweden  said today. That compared with a median
estimate for a 0.7 percent contraction in a Bloomberg survey of
15 economists.  To contact the reporter on this story:
