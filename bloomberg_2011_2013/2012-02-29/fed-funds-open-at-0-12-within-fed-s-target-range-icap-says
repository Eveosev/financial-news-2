Fed funds, the U.S. overnight inter-
bank lending  rate , opened at 0.12 percent, within the  Federal
Reserve ’s target of zero to 0.25 percent.  Fed funds closed at 0.1 percent yesterday after trading
from 0.05 percent to 0.3125 percent and averaging 0.09 percent,
ICAP Plc, the world’s largest inter-dealer broker, said in an e-
mailed statement.  The  Federal Reserve Bank of New York  will begin a series of
“small-scale” reverse repurchase agreements as it prepares one
of the tools for the eventual withdrawal of monetary stimulus.
The operations, part of a series first announced in 2009, don’t
represent any change in monetary policy, the New York Fed said
yesterday in a statement on its website.  The central bank will also acquire $1.5 billion to $2
billion of Treasuries maturing from May 2036 to February 2042.
The purchases are part of the Fed’s program to replace $400
billion of short-term debt in its portfolio with longer-term
Treasuries in an effort to reduce borrowing costs further and
counter rising risks of a recession.  The  New York  Fed will also release its monthly schedule for
its Treasury purchases and sales as part of its maturity
extension program. The announcement is schedule for 2 p.m. New
York time.  To contact the reporter on this story:
