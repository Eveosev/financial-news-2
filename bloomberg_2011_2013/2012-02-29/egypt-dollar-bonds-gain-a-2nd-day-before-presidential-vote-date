Egypt government’s dollar bonds
rose, sending the yield down for the second day, before the
announcement of a timetable for presidential elections.  The yield on the 5.75 percent notes due April 2020 declined
three basis points, or 0.03 percentage point, to 6.93 percent,
the lowest level since Jan. 27, at 4:31 p.m. in Cairo, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The Supreme Committee for Presidential Elections is due to
provide an election schedule today, after last year’s ouster of
 Hosni Mubarak .  The pound was little changed at 6.0312 a dollar. Five-year
credit default swaps rose five basis points to 614, according to
data provider CMA, which is owned by  CME Group Inc. (CME)  and compiles
prices quoted by dealers in the privately negotiated market.  To contact the reporter on this story:
