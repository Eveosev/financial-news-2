Azerbaijan’s non-oil economy
expanded more than 10 percent in January from the same month a
year earlier, President  Ilham Aliyev  said in comments broadcast
on state television channel AzTV.  The government will spend heavily in the coming years to
develop industries outside of oil production, with $7.3 billion
to be allocated from the budget in 2012 as part of a state
investment program, Aliyev said. A further $1.7 billion will be
channeled in state-guaranteed loans, bringing the total in
capital investments to at least $20 billion this year.  Aliyev said the goal for the next 10 years is to double the
Caspian Sea nation’s gross domestic product by relying on faster
growth of the non-oil economy as crude output remains flat,
according to AzTV.  Azerbaijan, the third-largest oil producer in the former
 Soviet Union , pumped 45.4 million metric tons of crude and 25.7
billion cubic meters of natural gas last year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
