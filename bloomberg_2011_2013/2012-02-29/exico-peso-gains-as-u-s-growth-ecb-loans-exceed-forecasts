Mexico ’s peso rose to a four-day
high after euro-area banks tapped the  European Central Bank  for
more cash than forecast and stronger U.S. growth boosted the
outlook for the Latin American country’s exports.  The peso gained 0.3 percent to 12.8065 per  U.S. dollar  at
1:53 p.m. in Mexico City, from 12.8444 yesterday. It earlier
touched 12.7538, the strongest since Feb. 23. The currency has
advanced 8.8 percent this year.  The number of financial institutions flocking to the ECB’s
three-year loans soared to 800, and borrowing rose to a record
in an operation that may boost the euro-area economy. U.S. gross
domestic product climbed at a revised 3 percent annual rate last
quarter, Commerce Department figures showed today. The median
estimate of economists surveyed by Bloomberg was for no change
from the previously reported 2.8 percent.  “It’s always significant when there’s a more positive
outlook” for U.S. growth,  Rafael Camarena , a Mexico City-based
economist at Banco Santander SA, said by phone. “It’s the
liquidity that the European Central Bank is injecting, plus the
revision of the GDP number in the U.S. that’s helping the
peso.”  The U.S. buys about 80 percent of Mexico’s exports.  The Frankfurt-based ECB said it will lend banks 529.5
billion euros ($706.2 billion) for 1,092 days, topping the 489
billion euros handed out to 523 institutions in the first three-
year operation in December. Economists predicted an allotment of
470 billion euros in today’s tender, according to the median of
28 estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  The yield on peso-denominated debt due in 2024 rose one
basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 6.5 percent, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg. The price fell 0.12 centavo to
130.33 centavos per peso.  To contact the reporter on this story:
