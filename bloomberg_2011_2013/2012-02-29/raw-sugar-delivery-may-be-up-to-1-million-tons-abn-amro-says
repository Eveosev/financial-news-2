Raw sugar delivered against the
expiring March futures in  New York  may be as much as 1 million
metric tons, according to  ABN Amro  Markets U.K. Ltd.  The sugar is likely to come from Brazil, Thailand, Central
America and “possibly” India, James Kirkup, a broker at the
bank in London, said by e-mail today.  Raw sugar for March delivery was 0.76 cent a pound more
expensive than May-delivered sweetener by 6:06 a.m. on ICE
Futures U.S. in New York, a so-called backwardation that may
signal limited supplies.  The March contract expires today on ICE and the first
notice for delivery is tomorrow. Cargill Inc. took delivery of
almost 1 million tons of raw sugar after the March 2011 contract
expired on ICE.  To contact the reporter on this story:
