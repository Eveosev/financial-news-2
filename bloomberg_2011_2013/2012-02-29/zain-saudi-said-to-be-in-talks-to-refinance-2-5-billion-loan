Mobile Telecommunications Co. of
Saudi Arabia , known as Zain Saudi, is in talks with lenders to
refinance its $2.5 billion Islamic loan facility that matures in
July, two people familiar with the matter said.  The company, 25 percent owned by Mobile Telecommunications
Co. of Kuwait, is looking to refinance the loan as it is unable
to repay the debt now, one of the people said, declining to be
identified because the talks are private. The company has good
support from banks and shouldn’t have any problem refinancing
the facility, another person said.  A spokesman for Mobile Telecommunications Co. of Kuwait
couldn’t be reached for comment when contacted by Bloomberg News
today. Reuters reported the refinancing yesterday.  Investors approved a six-month extension of the loan in
January. Zain Saudi got the $2.5 billion Murabaha loan from
eight banks in August 2009 to finance the company’s network
expansion.  The company’s fourth-quarter loss narrowed to 461 million
riyals ($123 million) from 521 million riyals in the year-
earlier period.  To contact the reporters on this story:
