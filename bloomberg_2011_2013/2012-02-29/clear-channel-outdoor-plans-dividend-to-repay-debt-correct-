(Corrects use of proceeds in first, third paragraphs.)  Clear Channel Outdoor Holdings Inc. (CCO) ,
the billboard company controlled by Bain Capital Partners LLC
and Thomas H. Lee Partners LP, plans to pay a $2.2 billion
dividend, mostly to repay debt.  The dividend of $6.08 a share will be paid March 15 to
holders of record as of March 12, according to a Business Wire
statement today from the San Antonio-based company.  Proceeds from the issuance will go toward paying a dividend
to shareholders, including Clear Channel Holdings Inc., a
subsidiary of Clear Channel Communications Inc., which owns an
89 percent stake and will use the money to pay back secured debt
that comes due in 2014, according to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
