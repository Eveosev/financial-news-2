Banca Civica SA (BCIV)  Co-Chairman Antonio Pulido said the Spanish bank is talking to potential merger
partners as the government promotes consolidation.  Civica is holding conversations with other banks just as
others are, Pulido said today in a news conference in Madrid.  Civica, a lender formed from the merger of four savings
banks that last year raised 600 million euros ($807 million) in
an initial public offering, has to make provisions of about 575
million euros because of a government order for banks to
recognize more losses on real estate. The bank said previously
that its has “different alternatives” to cover the
requirements, and Pulido said today the company will be able to
do so while remaining independent if it wants.  The lender said today net income fell 6.5 percent to 183.5
million euros in 2011 from a year earlier.  To contact the reporter on this story:
