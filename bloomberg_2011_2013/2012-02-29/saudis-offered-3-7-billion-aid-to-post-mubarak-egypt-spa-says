Saudi Arabia  offered $3.7 billion to
aid the Egyptian economy after mass protests led to the ouster
of Hosni Mubarak,  Egypt â€™s former president, a year ago, the
official  Saudi Press Agency  reported last night, citing Foreign
Minister Prince Saud Faisal.  The kingdom transferred $500 million in May, SPA said.
Egypt has delayed talks over a $1.45 billion aid package offered
by the Saudi Development Fund, the Riyadh-based news service
