Philippine three-year bonds rose for
a second day as economists predicted policy makers will cut
borrowing costs at a review tomorrow. The peso advanced.  The central bank will reduce the rate it pays lenders for
overnight deposits by a quarter of a percentage point to 4
percent, according to 14 of 18 economists surveyed by Bloomberg.
The monetary authority has “room for further calibrated
accommodation” in its benchmark  interest rates , Governor Amando
Tetangco said in an e-mail late yesterday.  “Philippine bonds could probably rally if they make a
decisive rate cut,” said  Enrico Tanuwidjaja , a Singapore-based
senior currency analyst at Malayan Banking Bhd. “We think they
will cut. The market will want to know if there is room for
further cuts.”  The yield on the government’s 12.375 percent notes due
February 2015 fell 13 basis points, or 0.13 percentage point, to
3.83 percent in Manila, the lowest level since Jan. 5, according
to noon fixing prices from Philippine Dealing & Exchange Corp.
It dropped 21 basis points in February.  The peso appreciated 0.2 percent to 42.747 per dollar in
 Manila , according to Tullett Prebon Plc. The currency gained 0.3
percent this month.  Consumer-price increases slowed to a 13-month low of 3.9
percent in January, according to government data. Inflation
probably eased to between 2.7 percent and 3.6 percent in
February, Tetangco said yesterday. Price pressures should
“continue to be manageable, barring oil-supply surprises due to
any acceleration in the tensions in the  Middle East ,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
