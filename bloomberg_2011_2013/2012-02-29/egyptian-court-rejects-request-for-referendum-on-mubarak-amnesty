An Egyptian court rejected a lawsuit
requesting a public referendum on whether to grant ousted former
President Hosni Mubarak amnesty in exchange for the return of
funds he allegedly amassed while in office, the state-run Al-
Ahram reported today.  The State Councilâ€™s Administrative Court, in dismissing the
case, ruled that there was no constitutional basis for holding
such a referendum, the Cairo-based daily said.  Mubarak is accused of complicity in the deaths of some of
the more than 800 protesters killed during the 18-day uprising
that forced him from power a year ago. The charge carries a
possible death sentence. His sons Gamal, who had been groomed to
succeed him, and businessman Alaa face corruption charges.  Egyptians have clamored for the return of the fortune
Mubarak and his family are accused of amassing during his almost
30 years as president.  To contact the reporter on this story:
