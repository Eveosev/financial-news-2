Deere & Co. (DE) , the world’s largest
maker of agricultural equipment, raised its quarterly dividend
by 12 percent and reiterated its goal of expanding sales by
about 56 percent by 2018.  The company said today it will increase the dividend to 46
cents a share from 41 cents a share. Chairman and Chief
Executive Officer Samuel R. Allen said Deere is seeking to
increase revenue to $50 billion by 2018, with half of that
revenue from outside the U.S. and Canada.  “Our recent performance shows we’re making good
progress,” Allen said at the company’s annual shareholder
meeting at its headquarters in Moline,  Illinois . Profit and cash
flow provide “a sturdy foundation for the company to pursue its
growth aspirations, which are shifting into higher gear.”  Sales of the company’s signature green and yellow farm,
forestry and construction machines will rise 15 percent in the
fiscal year ending Oct. 31, Deere said Feb. 15. Revenue in
fiscal 2011 climbed to a record $32 billion, of which 39 percent
came from outside the U.S. and  Canada .  Deere dropped 0.5 percent to $82.93 at the close in  New
York .  To contact the reporter on this story:
