Yingli Green Energy Holding Co. (YGE) , the
sixth-biggest silicon-based solar module maker, said it expects
shipments to rise as much as 56 percent this year after a slump
in the fourth quarter when the market was oversupplied.  The company forecast module shipments of 2.4 gigawatts to
2.5 gigawatts this year, compared to 1.6 gigawatts during 2011,
according to a statement. Shipments in the fourth quarter were
down 30 percent from the third quarter as gross margins slipped
to 3 percent from 10.8 percent.  Yingli posted a net loss of $509.8 million for the full
year even as it increased shipments by 51 percent from 2010. The
industry experienced “tremendous” pressure on margins as
manufacturers boosted supply while European nations that are the
biggest solar markets cut incentives for the technology.  “The potential risks are mitigated by the clear increase
in PV applications globally as solar electricity has become much
more affordable,” said Yingli Chairman Liansheng Miao. “We are
confident that we will continue to gain market share.”  China Growth  Yingli, based in Baoding, increased its sales in  China , the
country it sees as one of the most promising markets. The
company’s sales there rose to 22 percent of its output, compared
to 6 percent a year ago, and are forecast to reach 35 percent
this year.  “China is expected to sustain its strong growth momentum
supported by the boom of the utility segment and the steady
growth of the roof-top segment,” Miao said.  In a conference call with investors, Chief Financial
Officer Bryan Li said sales to China will amount to 15 percent
to 17 percent of the country’s 5,000-megawatt market this year.
 Germany  will amount to about 25 percent of output and the U.S.
about 20 percent, he said.  Total module shipments are forecast to rise 30 percent in
the first quarter and gross margins will reach about 10 percent,
according to Li. Average selling prices will fall by a
percentage in the “mid-teens” range compared to the last
quarter of 2011 and will continue falling during the year, he
said.  After its 750-megawatt expansion, Yingli’s total
manufacturing capacity will reach 2,450 megawatts this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
