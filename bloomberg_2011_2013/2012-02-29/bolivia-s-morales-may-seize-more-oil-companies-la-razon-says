Bolivia’s President Evo Morales said
he may seize more  oil companies  if they fail to meet investment
commitments, daily  La Razon  reported.  Bolivia has the “capacity to recover shares from companies
who are sabotaging investment,” the La Paz-based newspaper
reported Morales as saying. Last month he stripped Argentina’s
Pan American Energy LLC of its stake in the $1.6 billion
Caipipendi natural-gas project.  Bolivia aims to boost natural-gas production by 10 percent
this year to 51.9 million cubic meters per day and liquid-gas
output by 12 percent to 50,046 barrels per day, La Razon said.  Total SA (FP)  and  Petroleo Brasileiro SA (PETR4)  will boost gas output
at the San Alberto field by 12 percent with the startup of the
$80 million Sabalo 8 gas well in June, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
