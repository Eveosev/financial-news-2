Housing prices  in the U.S. will fall
a further 5 percent in the next year before the bottom as the
government plans to sell foreclosed properties to investors,
according to  Laurie Goodman  of Amherst Securities Group LP.  “Policy makers have finally gotten the prescription
right,” Goodman, New York-based senior managing director of the
firm, said today in a Bloomberg Television “Surveillance
Midday” interview with  Tom Keene . The “quickest solution” to
resolving an overhang of foreclosed properties that’s
restraining housing’s recovery is through bulk sales of
properties held by government-supported mortgage financiers, she
said.  The Federal Housing Finance Agency said this week it will
send detailed information to investors who qualify to
participate in a pilot program to turn about 2,500 foreclosed
homes into rentals. President  Barack Obama ’s administration also
proposed this month to expand loan modifications for delinquent
homeowners to include some principal reductions through the Home
Affordable Modification Program.  “Principal reductions have been the most successful kind
of modification,” said Goodman.  The S&P/Case-Shiller index of property values in 20 cities
fell 4 percent in December from a year earlier and values are
down 34 percent from a July 2006 peak.  To contact the reporter on this story:
