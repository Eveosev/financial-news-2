The South Korean government will not
take expansionary policy action to spur the economy as the
nation is expected to follow a growth path projected last
December, Finance Minister Bahk Jae Wan said.  The economy faces both “upside and downside risks,” Bahk
said at a press briefing today. Upside risks include a better-
than-expected  U.S. economy , progress on the European debt crisis,
the Korea-U.S. free trade agreement taking effect in March, and
stabilizing global financial markets, he said.  The nation’s exports in February may have expanded more
than 10 percent from a year ago after a 7 percent fall in
January, Bahk said. The trade data will be released tomorrow.  To contact the reporter on this story:
