Accor SA (AC)  is changing its strategy in
China to offer a product better tailored to Chinese travelers,
particularly in the luxury sector, after 27 years of operating
in that market,  Les Echos  reported.  Accor yesterday in Shanghai unveiled its first Mei Jue
hotel, an adaptation of its Grand Mercure brand, using Chinese
calligraphy for the lettering of the signs, offering daily tai
chi sessions, and having the staff dress in more traditional
Chinese garb, the French newspaper said, citing comments by
executives.  In the short term, a dozen Grand Mercure hotels will be
transformed, with possible plans for another 10 later, the
newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
