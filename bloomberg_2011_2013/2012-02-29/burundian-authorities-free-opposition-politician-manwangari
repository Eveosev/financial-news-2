Burundi’s authorities freed
opposition politician Jean-Baptiste Manwangari after he was held
in custody for more than two months on suspicion of involvement
in clashes in which one person died, his lawyer said.  Manwangari, the former leader of the opposition Union for
National Progress, was arrested on Dec. 11 following fighting
between supporters of different factions of the party, Anatole
Miburo, his lawyer, said in a phone interview today from
Bujumbura, the capital. Manwangari was released after the
authorities found no evidence linking him to the death of one of
the party’s members, he said.  Manwangari is head of a group that opposes Bonaventure
Niyoyankana’s leadership of the Union for National Progress.  To contact the reporter on this story:
