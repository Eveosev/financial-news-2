The U.S. Internal Revenue Service
rejected $1.6 billion in erroneous claims for the first-time
homebuyer tax credit, according to a  report  by the Treasury
Inspector General for Tax Administration.  The refundable tax credit, worth as much as $8,000, was
available to first-time homebuyers who made purchases in 2008,
2009 and 2010. As of July 30, 2011, the IRS processed 4.3
million claims for the credit totaling almost $30.4 billion,
according to the inspector general’s report.  The report was issued today as a follow-up to a 2009 audit
by the inspector general that said the IRS didn’t do enough to
prevent fraudulent claims for the credit. More than two years
later, the IRS is still falling short, the report said.  “Examination resources could have been used more
effectively,” according to the report.  The inspector general said the IRS didn’t implement filters
to detect potential fraud related to the credit until after the
agency had processed more than 1.1 million claims. Of those
claims, the IRS went back and found that 250,159 were
“questionable.” The watchdog said the IRS audited 69,953 of
the claims -- fewer than a third -- because it decided it didn’t
have the resources to review all of the questionable claims.  Many of the 180,206 suspicious claims the IRS didn’t audit
posed a higher risk of error than the 69,953 it reviewed, the
report said.  Implementation of the credit “presented significant
administrative challenges,” Peggy Bogadi, IRS commissioner for
the wage and investment division, wrote to the inspector general
in response to the report. “As with any new process, valuable
lessons were learned as we implemented and refined our strategy
for detecting and addressing questionable claims.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
