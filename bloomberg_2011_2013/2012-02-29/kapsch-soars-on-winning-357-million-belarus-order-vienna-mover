Kapsch TrafficCom AG (KTCG)  climbed the
most in almost five months after winning a 267 million-euro
($357 million) order for a toll collection system in Belarus.  Kapsch  advanced  6.4 percent, the biggest rise since Oct. 5,
to 63.99 euros at the 5:30 p.m. close of Vienna trading. Shares
have advanced 9.3 percent this year, giving the company a market
value of 831.4 million euros.  The Austrian toll-road-system developer won an order for
the implementation and operation of a nationwide electronic toll
collection system in Belarus.  “The total contract value for the implementation of the
system reaches approximately 267 million euros, out of which 158
million euros fall upon the first two phases within the next two
years,” it said in a statement today.  Separately, Kapsch said earlier today that nine-month net
income increased 47 percent to 24.7 million euros as sales rose
58 percent to 408.2 million euros.  “The fourth quarter of the fiscal year 2011/12 will be
marked by the acceptance of the Polish toll collection system
and the continued developments in  South Africa  as well as other
existing and potential projects,” the company said in a
statement.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
