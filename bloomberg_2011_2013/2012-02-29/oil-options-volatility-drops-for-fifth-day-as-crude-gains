Oil options volatility declined for
the fifth day as crude fell after government data showed U.S.
supplies rose to a five-month high and on expectations that the
 Federal Reserve  won’t take new action to bolster the economy.  Implied volatility for at-the-money options expiring in
April, a measure of expected price swings in futures and a gauge
of options prices, was 28 as of 2:06 p.m. in New York, down from
29.4 yesterday and the lowest level for the contract.  Crude oil for April delivery rose 52 cents, or 0.5 percent,
to settle at $107.07 a barrel on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange  after touching $104.84 earlier. Futures reached a nine-
month high of $109.95 a barrel in intraday trading on Feb. 24.  “The prospect of a supply disruption while the April
contract is on the board has diminished greatly,” Ray Carbone,
president of Paramount Options Inc. in  New York , said by phone.
“Prime Minister of  Israel  is coming to meet with President
Obama, whatever it means, nothing will happen until that
meeting. April contract volatility is down more than May and
June because April doesn’t have a lot of time left.”  The most active options in electronic trading today were
April $100 puts. They fell 6 cents to 61 cents a barrel with
3,608 contracts trading as of 2:15 p.m. in New York. Next were
April $95 puts, which dropped 5 cents to 18 cents a barrel on
2,494 lots. A contract covers 1,000 barrels of crude. Puts were
58 percent of the volume.  The exchange distributes real-time data for electronic
trading and releases information on floor trading, where the
bulk of options trading occurs, the next business day.  Calls accounted for 48 percent of the volume in the
previous session. June $90 puts were the most actively traded
options, with 10,042 lots changing hands. They added 23 cents to
$1.31 a barrel. The next-most active options, April $100 puts,
climbed 20 cents to 67 cents on volume of 4,974 lots.  April options expire on March 15.  Open interest was highest for December $80 puts with 45,933
contracts. Next were December $150 calls with 37,407 lots and
December $100 calls with 34,426.  To contact the reporter on this story:
