Sun Resorts Ltd. (SUN) , Mauritius’s
second-biggest leisure company by market value, fell to the
lowest level in almost three years as investors anticipate lower
full-year earnings.  The  stock  retreated for a second day, losing 4.9 percent to
39 rupees by the end of trading in  Port Louis , the capital, the
lowest since April 2009, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  The number of visitors in the Indian Ocean island nation
advanced 0.7 percent in the fourth quarter through December, the
first half of the tourism peak season, compared with a 9.8
percent rise a year earlier. Tourist arrivals for 2011 advanced
3.2 percent to 964,642 tourists against a January forecast of 7
percent.  The weakness is in “anticipation of its final year 2011
results, which are expected to be in line with the industry,”
said Kishen Nadassen, a senior research analyst at CIM
Stockbrokers, in a phone interview from the city. Sun Resorts is
rated as “hold” at the brokerage.  Sun Resorts reported Nov. 15 its loss in the third quarter
through September widened to 172.5 million rupees ($6 million)
from 133 million rupees a year earlier.  New Mauritius Hotels Ltd. (NMH) , the country’s largest leisure
operator by market value, said Feb. 10 net income for the three
months through December declined to 548.9 million rupees from
567.9 million rupees a year earlier.  To contact the reporter on this story:
