Piraeus Port Authority (PPA)  SA called on
architects to submit designs for a 118 million-euro ($158.7
million) Maritime Antiquities Museum, the biggest such tender in
Greece since the new Acropolis Museum.  “It will be a unique museum by both Greek and
international standards,” Piraeus Port said in an e-mailed
statement today. “Its focus will be on archeology but special
attention will be given to balancing between antiquity findings
and new technology, as well as its role as an educational
center.”  The museum will be situated on the Piraeus Cultural
Waterfront, which will span 180 stremmata (44.5 acres), and show
antiquities that are currently spread across Greece in various
museums or are in storage, according to the statement.  Greece ’s biggest port operator plans to announce the winner
on Sept. 20 with the official tender process set to start on
March 20, the statement showed.  Greece opened the $181 million New Acropolis Museum in June
2009.  To contact the reporter on this story:
