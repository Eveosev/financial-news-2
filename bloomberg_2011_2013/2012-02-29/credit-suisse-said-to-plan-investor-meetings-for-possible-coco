Credit Suisse Group AG (CSGN) ,
 Switzerland ’s second-biggest lender, is planning a sale of
contingent capital notes in Swiss francs meeting regulators’
demands that banks strengthen their protection against losses.  The Zurich-based lender plans to meet bond investors in
Switzerland on March 5-6 before a possible sale of the
securities, according to a banker with knowledge of the
arrangements, who declined to be identified because the
information is private.  A sale would follow Zurich-based  UBS AG (UBSN) ’s offering on Feb.
15 when it priced $2 billion of 10-year contingent capital notes
that are permanently written down if the bank’s core Tier 1
capital falls below 5 percent or if UBS reaches a point where it
would require a bailout to avoid collapse.  Credit Suisse sold contingent convertible securities, or
CoCos, in February 2011 that become equity if reported capital
falls below 7 percent of assets weighted by risk. It isn’t known
what form the bank’s new securities will take, the banker said.  Regulators worldwide are insisting banks hold more, higher-
quality capital to prevent financial crises, while Swiss
authorities are insisting the nation’s biggest banks hold about
twice as much capital as demanded under the international Basel
III rules.  Credit Suisse spokesman Adam Bradbury in  London  declined to
comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
