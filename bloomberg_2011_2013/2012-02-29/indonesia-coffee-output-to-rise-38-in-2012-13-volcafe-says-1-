Coffee production in  Indonesia , the
world’s third-largest producer of the robusta variety, will jump
38 percent in the season starting in April, according to
Volcafe, the coffee unit of ED&F Man Holdings Ltd.  Production will total 9.1 million bags in 2012-13, up from
6.6 million bags in the current season, the Winterthur,
Switzerland-based trader estimated in a quarterly report e-
mailed today. Rains caused by the La Nina weather pattern,
associated with cooler-than-normal equatorial waters in the
Pacific Ocean, cut output in the current season.  A larger crop in Indonesia may help ease tight supplies
that have lifted prices for robusta coffee by 11 percent in
London this year. The variety is grown mainly in  Asia  and parts
of  Africa  and used to make instant coffee and espresso.  “It is very tight until April, and then once the new
Indonesian crop arrives, there will be a reversal of this
tightness and a rebuilding of stocks,” Volcafe said.  Vietnam , the biggest robusta producer, will harvest 22.1
million bags in the 2011-12 season started in October, up from
20 million in the previous season, the trader estimates.  “Vietnam is almost the lone supplier of volume robusta
these last couple of months, until  India , Uganda, Indonesia,
Ivory Coast or even  Brazil  start to ship more volume come April
and May,” Volcafe said in the report.  Honduras, Colombia  Coffee output in Honduras, Central America’s largest
producer, will advance 21 percent to 5.1 million bags in 2011-12
as yields improve, Volcafe said. The season there started in
October. Production in Colombia, the second-biggest producer of
the arabica variety, will “struggle to reach” 7 million bags
in 2011-12. Output will be no higher than 7.5 million bags in
2012-13, it said.  Arabica beans are grown mainly in  Latin America  and favored
by companies such as  Starbucks Corp. (SBUX)  for specialty beverages.  Farmers in Brazil, the world’s biggest coffee grower, will
harvest 55.7 million bags in 2012-13, up from 48 million bags in
2011-12, as trees enter the higher-yielding half of a two-year
cycle, according to Volcafe. Output in the last high-yielding
season in 2010-11 was 57.6 million bags. Harvesting there
usually starts in July.  “We have estimated that there is still more coffee stored
internally than we originally expected, and so have revised up
our Brazil 2011-12 crop number by 1 million to 48 million
bags,” Volcafe said. “Rainfall for the new crop has been a
touch patchy through February so far.”  Global coffee demand will outpace supplies by 7 million
bags in 2011-12, the trader estimates. The market may move into
a surplus of 2 million bags in 2012-13, according to Volcafe. A
bag of the beans weighs 60 kilograms (132 pounds).  To contact the reporter on this story:
