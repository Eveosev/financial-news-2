Royal BAM Group NV (BAMNB) , the largest
builder in the Netherlands, rose the most in five weeks after
agreeing to sell its Tebodin unit and saying the transaction
will result in a 65 million-euro ($87.5 million) gain.  BAM  jumped  as much as 4.4 percent to 3.58 euros, the
biggest intraday increase since Jan. 23, and traded up 3 percent
at 3.53 euros as of 10:25 a.m.in Amsterdam. The stock has  gained 
8.4 percent this year, valuing the Bunnik, Netherlands-based
company at 823 million euros.  The construction company agreed to sell Tebodin, a
consulting and engineering services provider, for 145 million
euros in cash to Mannheim, Germany-based  Bilfinger Berger SE (GBF)  and
said it will use the book profit mainly to reduce net debt. The
companies expect to complete the transaction in the second
quarter, BAM said in a  statement .  BAM is “divesting Tebodin at an excellent price,” Michel Aupers and Micha Tiekink, Utrecht, Netherlands-based analysts at
Rabobank International, wrote in an investor note. Including the
disposal in December of its stake in dredging company Van Oord,
BAM is free of recourse debt, a competitive advantage in today’s
depressed construction markets, said the analysts, who have a
“buy” recommendation on BAM stock.  BAM sold its 21.5 percent interest in Van Oord on Dec. 22
for 200 million euros to investment companies including Cobepa,
Janivo, Breedinvest and Rinkelberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
