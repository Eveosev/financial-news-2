  Royal DSM NV (DSM) , the world’s largest
maker of vitamins, reported better-than-expected fourth-quarter
earnings, helped by the acquisition of baby-food ingredient
maker Martek Biosciences.  Earnings before interest, taxes, amortization and
depreciation from continuing operations increased to 293 million
euros ($395 million) from 276 million euros a year earlier, the
Heerlen, Netherlands-based company said in a statement today.
Analysts predicted 284 million euros, on average. Sales
increased to 2.22 billion euros from 2.08 billion euros.  The company said it is on track to achieve its 2013 target
of earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization
of 1.4 billion euros to 1.6 billion euros. Chief Executive
Officer Feike Sijbesma has transformed DSM into a maker of
enzymes, specialty plastics and nutritional supplements,
dropping commodity-chemical products by making disposals. DSM
bought baby-food ingredient maker Martek Biosciences last year
and recently announced a joint venture with Poet LLC to produce
cellulosic ethanol.  “We are conscious that risks to the macro-economic global
outlook remain, and that weakness in some of our end markets,
especially building and construction, persists,”  said in a
statement today.  The company proposes dividend of 1.45 euros per share for
2011, up 10 cents from a year earlier.  To contact the reporter on this story:
