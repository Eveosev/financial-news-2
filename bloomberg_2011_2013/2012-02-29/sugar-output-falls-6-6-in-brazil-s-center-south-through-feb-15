Sugar output in  Brazil ’s Center
South, the world’s largest producing region, dropped 6.6 percent
after growers harvested the smallest crop in four years,
industry association  Unica  said.  Production fell to 31.3 million metric tons through Feb.
15, from 33.5 million tons a year earlier, Sao Paulo-based Unica
said in an e-mailed statement today. The volumes were little
changed from those reported previously because most of the
region’s sugar cane was harvested and processed between April
and December. The current crop year ends on March 31.  Sugar-cane fields in Brazil’s Center South, which produces
about 90 percent of the country’s sweetener and ethanol, were
damaged by freezing temperatures last year following a drought
in 2010.  Latin America ’s largest economy produces about half of
global sugar exports.  Growers in the region harvested 494.3 million tons of cane
through Feb. 15, down 11 percent from a year earlier, Unica
said.  Ethanol output declined 19 percent to 20.6 billion liters
(5.4 billion gallons) in the period.  Mills turned 48.3 percent of the cane into sugar and the
rest into ethanol. That compares with 44.9 percent processed
into sweetener a year earlier.  Unica will release its first estimate for the next crop
year by the end of March, according to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
