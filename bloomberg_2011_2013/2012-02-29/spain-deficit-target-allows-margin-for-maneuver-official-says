Spain  can deviate from its 2012
deficit target of 4.4 percent of gross domestic product without
breaching European Union budget rules, said a government
official who declined to be named in line with policy.  The European Stability and Growth Pact allows for a certain
margin of maneuver as long as correction measures are taken, the
official said, adding that the target was set by the previous
Socialist government and that the People’s Party government of
Prime Minister  Mariano Rajoy  is working on a revised stability
program.  Spain said on Feb. 28 that it missed last year’s deficit
target by a wider margin than projected after economic growth
slumped. The government is pushing for the EU to review
stability programs to take into account  recession forecasts .  Rajoy has already adopted a 15-billion euro ($20 billion)
package of measures to reduce the deficit since taking over in
December and needs to find another 25 billion euros, according
to a Moody’s Investors Service estimate, if the deficit goal
remains unchanged.  Rajoy said he will present the nation’s budget for 2012 on
March 30.  To contact the reporter on this story:
