Henderson Group Plc (HGG) , the dual London
and Sydney-listed fund manager, posted a bigger-than-estimated
gain in full-year profit as management fees climbed after its
purchase of Gartmore Group Ltd.  Underlying net income, which excludes costs related to the
Gartmore acquisition, climbed 56 percent to 125.7 million pounds
($200 million), the  Jersey , Channel Islands-based firm said in a
statement today. That beat the 122.5 million-pound estimate of
11 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  The Gartmore acquisition helped Henderson to raise the
average fee it charges clients because it added  hedge funds  and
individual investors, who typically pay more than institutional
investors and pension funds.  “The acquisition of Gartmore has exceeded our expectations
on all counts and made a significant contribution to these
results,” Chief Executive Officer Andrew Formica said in the
statement.  Assets under management rose 4 percent to 64.3 billion
pounds over the 12-month period.  Henderson had 59 percent of its funds performing ahead of
their benchmarks over one year, compared to 70 percent in 2010,
the firm said. Over three years, 66 percent of funds beat their
benchmarks, up from 62 percent a year ago.  To contact the reporter on this story:
