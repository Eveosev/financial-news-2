The cost of insuring Asia-Pacific
sovereign and corporate bonds from non-payment fell, with
 Australia ’s contracts declining to a three-week low, according
to traders of credit-default swaps.  The Markit iTraxx Australia index dropped 2 basis points to
140 basis points as of 11:12 a.m. in Sydney, according to
 Westpac Banking Corp. (WBC)  That would be the lowest level since Feb.
8, according to CMA.  The Markit iTraxx Japan index decreased 3 basis points to
139 basis points as of 9:10 a.m. in Tokyo, according to Deutsche
Bank AG prices. Japan’s contracts fell to 137 on Feb. 24, the
lowest since Aug. 18, according to CMA, which is owned by CME
Group Inc. and compiles prices quoted by dealers in the
privately negotiated market.  The Markit iTraxx Asia index of 40 investment-grade
borrowers outside Japan fell 1 basis point to 161 basis points
as of 8:27 a.m. in  Hong Kong , according to  Credit Agricole SA (ACA) 
prices.  Credit-default swap indexes are benchmarks for protecting
bonds against default and traders use them to speculate on
credit quality. A drop signals improving perceptions of
creditworthiness, while an increase suggests the opposite.  The swap contracts pay the buyer face value in exchange for
the underlying securities if a borrower fails to meet its debt
agreements. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  To contact the reporter on this story:
