A government report tomorrow will
probably show a below-normal decline in U.S. gas stockpiles as
unusually mild weather east of the  Rocky Mountains  crimped
demand for the furnace fuel, analyst estimates compiled by
 Bloomberg (DOENUSCH)  show.  Inventories dropped 91 billion cubic feet, or 3.6 percent,
to 2.504 trillion cubic feet in the week ended Feb. 24, based on
the median of 15 estimates. The five-year average decline for
the week is 118 billion, according to the Energy Department,
which is scheduled to release the weekly report at 10:30 a.m.  Stockpiles  (DOENT5YP) in the week ended Feb. 17 were 40 percent above
the five-year average, last week’s report showed.  “The cold will not get cold enough to burn much gas while
the warmer winter weather will kill any need to burn gas at
all,”  Peter Beutel , the president of Cameronhanover.com in  New
Canaan ,  Connecticut , said in a note to clients today.  The stockpile estimates ranged from declines of 74 billion
to 93 billion cubic feet. About 51 percent of U.S. households
use gas for heating, according to the Energy Department.  Demand for heat in the U.S. was 19 percent below normal in
the week ended Feb. 25, according to Belton, Missouri-based
forecaster Weather Derivatives.  Natural gas for next-month delivery fell 13.4 cents, or 5
percent, to $2.55 per million British thermal units last week on
the  New York Mercantile Exchange . The April contract rose 3.3
cents, or 1.3 percent, to $2.552 at 12:22 p.m. today. Prices
have dropped 15 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
