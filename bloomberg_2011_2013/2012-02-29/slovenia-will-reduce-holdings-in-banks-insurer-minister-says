Slovenia will reduce holdings in its
major financial firms, including Nova Ljubljanska Banka d.d. and
insurer  Zavarovalnica Triglav d.d. , to lower public spending and
avoid the need for government support.  “The government wants to keep the 25 percent stake plus
one share in the major financial firms, Nova Ljubljanska Banka,
 Nova Kreditna Banka Maribor d.d.  and Zavarovalnica Triglav if we
want to carry out the fiscal consolidation,” Finance Minister
Janez Sustersic told reporters in Ljubljana today. He said the
government will aim to cut the  budget deficit  to about 3 percent
of gross domestic product as it seeks to allay investors’
concern over its debt and “reduce the pressure” on government
bond yields.  The government, via state agencies, holds majorities in the
country’s two biggest lenders, NLB and Nova Kreditna, as well as
in Zavarovalnica Triglav, it’s biggest insurer.  Slovenia, a euro-region member since 2007, wants to sell
state assets to avoid injecting cash into unprofitable companies
that threaten its deficit-reduction targets. NLB reported a loss
of 239 million euros ($321 million) for last year and Nova
Kreditna will probably also report a loss, its first since it
sold shares to the public in 2007.  Triglav is the most profitable of the group as its nine-
month profit rose to 35 million euros and the insurer aims to
earn 61 million euros of net income in 2012.  To contact the reporter on this story:
