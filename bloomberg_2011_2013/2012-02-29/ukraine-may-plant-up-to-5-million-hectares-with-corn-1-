Ukraine may plant 4.5 million
hectares (11.1 million acres) to 5 million hectares of corn this
year after an autumn drought and winter frosts ruined almost
half of winter grains, said Leonid Sukhomlyn, head of the grain
department at the  Agriculture Ministry .  That compares with 3.6 million hectares planted with corn
last year, Sukhomlyn told reporters in Kiev today. Farmers will
probably double plantings of spring barley and spring wheat in
comparison with last year, he said.  Winter grains will be harvested from between 5.5 million
hectares and 6 million hectares, compared with 7.1 million
hectares of winter grains sprouted before winter frosts, he
said.  The ministry expects 3.5 million hectares of winter grains,
mostly wheat, to be reseeded with crops that can be planted in
the spring. Winter grains were damaged by the worst autumn
drought in at least 50 years, which lasted more than three
months and weakened plants before freezing temperatures in
winter.  Winter wheat for the 2012 harvest will be harvested from
4.5 million to 5 million hectares and winter barley from 800,000
hectares to 1 million hectares, Sukhomlyn said today.  Ukraine may also plant 4.5 million hectares with
sunflowers, almost on par with last year, Sukhomlyn said. The
former Soviet state planted 4.4 million hectares last year,
according to the state statistics committee.  The countryâ€™s sunflower oil output will climb by almost 18
percent to a record 3.7 million metric tons in the marketing
year that started Sept. 1 compared with a year earlier,
researcher UkrAgroConsult said Feb. 21.  To contact the reporter on this story:
