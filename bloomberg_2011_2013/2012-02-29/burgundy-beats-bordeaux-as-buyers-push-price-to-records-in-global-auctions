Prices of top Burgundies are at
record levels in auctions around the world this month as wealthy
wine investors favor them over Bordeaux.  Buyers from  Asia  and other regions are focusing on
Burgundy, especially Domaine de la Romanee-Conti, the region’s
most desirable and expensive label. Demand for top Bordeaux
remains steady, though prices are down about 20 percent from
record levels in mid-2011, dealers said.  “Burgundy continues to lead the charge,” said Jeff Zacharia, auction director of  New York  state-based specialist
seller  Zachys . “Bordeaux is certainly firming up, if not
gaining back some of what it lost over the past few months.”  The Bordeaux-focused  Liv-ex 100 Fine Wine Index (LIVX100)  increased
1.4 percent in January, its first monthly gain since June. The
benchmark indicator declined 15 percent in 2011 after two years
of gains, with a 40 percent jump in 2010.  Domaine de la Romanee-Conti, which produces seven Grand Cru
reds and one white, notched up the top lots at sales in London,
New York and  San Francisco  this month. Broker prices of the
Vosne-Romanee-based estate’s stable of Burgundies increased 31
percent during the six months to mid-January 2012, according to
data compiled by London-based  IGWines Ltd .  San Francisco  Six bottles of  Romanee-Conti  from the 1996 vintage sold for
$63,440 at Zachys’s two-day Burgundy-focused sale in San
Francisco ended Feb. 24. Seven bottles of the same Domaine de la
Romanee-Conti (DRC) pinot noir from its sole-owned 4.3 acre
vineyard, this time from 1982, topped Bonhams’s auction in New
York and  California  on Feb. 25 with a price of $47,600. Both
results, including fees, just exceeded presale estimates based
on hammer prices.  Zachys was the most lucrative of this latest series of
auctions, raising $4.6 million against an upper estimate of $4.8
million, with 98.5 percent of the 1,358 offered lots successful.  Burgundy also led the way on Feb. 23 at  Christie’s
International (CHRS)  in  London , where 99 percent of 293 lots found
buyers. A case of Vosne-Romanee Cros Parantoux 1999 Emmanuel
Rouget took 10,925 pounds ($17,286), more than doubling its low
estimate, and 12 bottles of Leroy’s 1998 Chambertin climbed to
10,350 pounds against an upper estimate of 3,500 pounds. The
sale was topped by a 12-bottle assortment of DRC wines from the
2002 vintage at 20,700 pounds.  “We’re telling our clients that Domaine de la Romanee-
Conti is very highly priced,” Paul Hammond, director of IGWines
Ltd, said in an interview. “The market for Burgundy is
broadening outside DRC.”  A case of Vosne-Romanee Cros Parantoux 1985 from the
private cellar of winemaker Henri Jayer fetched a record HK$2.06
million ($265,645) at Christie’s in Hong Kong on Feb. 11.  Chateau Petrus  Pomerols from  Chateau Petrus  and Le Pin were the dominant
names in the Bordeaux market. An Asian buyer gave a top price of
30,550 pounds, exceeding the upper estimate of 26,000 pounds,
for a case of Le Pin 1990 at Sotheby’s in London on Feb. 22.  All 10 of the most expensive of the 600 lots in the sale
were bought by Asian bidders.  “Recently Asian buyers haven’t been as active as they have
been and now they’ve come back,” Stephen Mould, Sotheby’s
London-based senior director of wine, said in an interview.
“They perhaps feel that prices have now reached a level that is
more attractive.”  Cases of Chateau Petrus 1982 were the biggest sellers at
 Sotheby’s (BID)  New York on Feb. 25, two reaching $58,188 each, just
below the high estimate. The auction raised $2.2 million with
fees, beating a high estimate of $1.9 million, with 99 percent
of the material successful.  Super Tuscan  A Nebuchadnezzar (15 liters) of the Super Tuscan Masseto
from 2007 was bought by an Asian bidder for $49,000, more than
four times the low estimate.  “It’s shifting from a buyer’s market to a seller’s,”
Hammond said. “They’re confident that prices are on the rise.”  That said, cases of Chateau Lafite Rothschild 2000 were
selling at February auctions in both London and the U.S. for
about $27,000. In October 2010, this same vintage of what Asian
buyers at the time regarded as the world’s most desirable wine -
- albeit directly from the chateau -- was selling at Sotheby’s
 Hong Kong  for as much as HK$556,600 ($71,751) a case.  (Scott Reyburn and Guy Collins write about the art and wine
