A Canadian man and  California  woman
were indicted by a federal grand jury for running a $129 million
Ponzi scheme selling fraudulent certificates of deposit to 1,200
people through banking entities they controlled.  William Wise, 62, a Canadian citizen formerly of Raleigh,
North Carolina, and Jacquline Hoegel, 55, of American Canyon,
California, were charged with conspiracy, mail fraud and wire
fraud, U.S. Attorney Melinda Haag in  San Francisco  said today in
a statement.  The CDs, which purportedly carried a guaranteed return of
as much as 16 percent and were supposedly based on overseas
investments, were issued by Millennium Bank, Haag said. Wise and
Hoegel used investor money to enrich themselves and make
interest payments to earlier investors, prosecutors said.  Hoegel was arrested and released on bond, according to the
statement. Wise is believed to be in  Canada  and a warrant was
issued for his arrest, Haag said.  The case is U.S. v. Wise, 12-111, U.S. District Court,
Northern District of California (San Francisco)  To contact the reporter on this story:
