KGHM Polska Miedz SA (KGH)  said fourth-
quarter unconsolidated net income almost tripled as the copper
producer with the largest European mine output sold its stake in
mobile phone operator Polkomtel SA.  Unconsolidated net income, which excludes earnings at
certain units such as power utility Energetyka Sp. z o.o.,
jumped to 3.81 billion zloty ($1.24 billion) from 1.32 billion
zloty a year earlier, the Lubin, southwestern Poland-based
company said in a regulatory statement today. That beat the 3.72
billion-zloty mean estimate of 13  analysts  surveyed by
Bloomberg.  KGHM sold its 24 percent stake in Polkomtel,  Poland ’s
second-largest wireless phone company, in November making a
pretax profit of 2.31 billion zloty. The transaction helped the
world’s third-largest silver producer report an annual profit of
11.3 billion zloty, a record for any Polish company.  Fourth-quarter sales increased 2 percent to 4.85 billion
zloty, compared with an estimate of 4.82 billion zloty.  In a separate statement today KGHM said it received all
approvals needed to complete its C$2.87 billion ($2.89 billion)
acquisition of  Quadra FNX Mining Ltd. (QUX) , part of the company’s
global expansion plans. In 2010 KGHM bought a stake in Canadian
Afton-Ajax mining project and it has until April 4 to decide
whether to invest $795 million to develop the site, it said in
the earnings statement today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
