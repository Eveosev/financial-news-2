JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) , the largest
U.S. bank by assets, said the Securities and Exchange Commission
warned in January that it may bring civil claims after two
investigations relating to mortgage securitizations.  One inquiry focuses on due diligence and disclosures in two
securitizations by a subsidiary, the New York-based bank said
today in a regulatory filing. The other probe relates to
“settlements of claims against originators” involving loans
included in securitizations handled by Bear Stearns Cos., which
JPMorgan acquired in 2008.  To contact the reporter on this story:
