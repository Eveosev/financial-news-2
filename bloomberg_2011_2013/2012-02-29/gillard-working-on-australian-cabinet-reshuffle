Australian Prime Minister  Julia Gillard , who won a leadership ballot on Feb. 27, said she’s
working on changing her cabinet lineup, without giving an
indication when it may be announced.  “My door is open to talk to people as I work my way
through the reshuffle,” Gillard told reporters in Canberra
today. “The decisions are mine and I’ll make them.”  Gillard, who defeated  Kevin Rudd  in a party leadership
challenge earlier this week, is undertaking her second
reorganization of ministers in three months. The prime minister
has given no indication she’ll take retribution on supporters of
Rudd, a Chinese-speaking former diplomat who headed the
government from 2007 to 2010.  Resources Minister Martin Ferguson, Infrastructure and
Transport Minister Anthony Albanese, Immigration Minister  Chris
Bowen  and Manufacturing Minister Kim Carr indicated before the
Feb. 27 leadership vote that they intended to back Rudd, who
resigned last week as foreign minister.  Gillard,  Australia ’s first female prime minister, today
denied a story in the Australian newspaper that her decision to
approach former New South Wales Premier Bob Carr to take a
vacant Senate position and become foreign minister had been
vetoed by senior ministers.  To contact the reporter on this story:
