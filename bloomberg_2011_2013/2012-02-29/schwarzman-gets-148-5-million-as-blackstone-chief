Stephen Schwarzman, chairman and
chief executive officer of  Blackstone Group LP (BX) , received $148.5
million in pay and cash dividends in 2011, topping rivals at
 Carlyle Group  and KKR & Co.  The Blackstone co-founder was paid a $350,000 salary and
$4.6 million of his share of the firm’s profits, known as
carried interest, the New York-based company said yesterday in a
regulatory filing. He received $74 million in distributions from
funds started before the company went public in 2007, and $69.6
million in cash dividends from his ownership of Blackstone
stock.  Carried interest and its taxation has come under public
scrutiny this year as U.S. lawmakers consider proposals to
eliminate tax breaks that benefit some of the richest Americans.
 Mitt Romney , the former Bain Capital LLC CEO endorsed by
Schwarzman, said last month his effective  tax rate  was 13.9
percent on income of $21.6 million in 2010, less than half the
top rate on ordinary income.  Schwarzman, 65, told the CNBC cable network in September
that he was taxed at 36 percent by the U.S. and 17 percent by
state and local governments in 2010. He had a net worth of $4.7
billion as of September, making him the 66th wealthiest
American, according to an estimate by Forbes magazine.  Real Estate  Blackstone isn’t required by the New York Stock Exchange,
where its shares are listed, to have a compensation committee
because the firm is considered a limited partnership. As a
result, executive compensation is left in the hands of the
executive committee of the board, which includes Schwarzman,
President  Tony James , Vice Chairman J. Tomilson Hill and
 Jonathan Gray , a senior managing director.  James, 61, was paid a total $41.1 million in 2011,
including a salary of $350,000, a $26.2 million bonus and $12.8
million in cash dividends, according to the filing with the U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission. He collected $1.7 million in
carried interest.  Gray, the head of global real estate, joined Blackstone’s
board of directors this month after his business brought in $1
billion in profit in 2011, accounting for 71 percent of the
firm’s profit last year. He joined Blackstone in 1992 after
graduating from the  University of Pennsylvania  and became a
senior managing director eight years later.  March Dividend  Gray, 42, received $36.5 million in 2011, including
$350,000 in salary, a $21.4 million bonus based upon the
performance of the real estate segment, $2.6 million in carried
interest and $12.2 million in cash dividends, according to the
filing.  Schwarzman, James and Gray are also set to receive $64.9
million, $9.5 million and $11.4 million, respectively, on March
30 from a premium dividend for Blackstone’s limited partners,
according to the filing.  Though Blackstone said on Feb. 2 that 2011 profit fell 2
percent to $1.4 billion as performance fees and investment
income declined, the firm ended the year with a record-high
$136.8 billion fee-earning assets under management, up 25
percent from 2010. The firm deployed a near-record $16 billion
in 2011 and returned $9 billion to investors, said James,
Blackstone’s president.  Carlyle, KKR  Carlyle Group, the Washington-based private equity firm
seeking to go public, said in a filing last month that its three
founders received a combined $413 million last year.  William Conway ,  Daniel D’Aniello  and  David Rubenstein  each earned a
$275,000 salary, a $3.55 million bonus and $134 million in
distributions.  Schwarzman earned $398.3 million in 2006, the year before
Blackstone went public.  KKR (KKR)  said in a Feb. 27 filing that  Henry Kravis  and  George Roberts , the firm’s co-founders and co-CEOs, received more than
$94 million in pay and cash dividends in 2011, about 30 percent
more than the year before. Almost all of their compensation was
from carried interest, or their share of profits from the firm’s
private equity funds.  To contact the reporter on this story:
