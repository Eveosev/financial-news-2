Egyptians at home will vote in the
country’s first presidential ballot since the ouster of  Hosni Mubarak  on May 23 and May 24, the head of the elections
commission said.  The final result will be announced on June 21, Farouk
Soltan, the chairman of the Supreme Committee for Presidential
Elections said in a press conference in Cairo. Egyptians living
abroad will vote from May 11 until May 17, he said.  The timing of the ballot, one of the last steps in the
transition to civilian rule, has been the focus of political
wrangling. The ruling military council, which took interim rule
from Mubarak, has previously only said that the vote would be
held before the end of June. Activists who accuse the ruling
generals of mismanaging the transition have called on the
generals to speed up the handover of power.  Presidential candidates will have from March 10 to April 8
to register, the commission said on Feb. 19. Campaigning will
start on April 30 and end on May 20, Soltan said today. If
needed, local runoffs will be held on June 16 and 17, he said.  In a poll of Egyptians released last month by Gallup Middle
East &  Africa , 86 percent said they planned to vote though a
majority said they didn’t know for whom. Amre Moussa, the former
head of the  Arab League , led the poll with 17 percent of votes.  To contact the reporter on this story:
