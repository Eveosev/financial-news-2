Asian  stocks  fell, with the region’s

means the economy hasn’t bottomed out yet,” said  Wang Zheng ,
Shanghai-based chief investment officer at Jingxi Investment
Management Co., which oversees about $120 million. “These
negative factors will put the rally into doubt.”  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index fell 1 percent to 127.69 as of
5:13 p.m. in Tokyo. The gauge entered a bull market yesterday,

through yesterday, compared with an 8.6 percent advance by the
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index and an 8.1 percent increase by the

at 15 times estimated earnings on average, compared with 13.1
