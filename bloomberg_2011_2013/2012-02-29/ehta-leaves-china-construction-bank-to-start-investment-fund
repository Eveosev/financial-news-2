Mickey Mehta, the assistant general
manager and head of corporate banking and structured finance at
 China Construction Bank Corp. (939) ’s  Hong Kong  unit, said he has left
the lender to start a private equity firm.  Mehta, who was also a managing director of China
Construction Bank International Finance Ltd., the bank’s funding
arm, said he is no longer working at the lender when contacted
on his mobile phone in Hong Kong today.  Willa Wong, head of corporate communications in Hong Kong
for China Construction Bank ( Asia ), said media inquiries for the
Hong Kong unit are handled by Ketchum Inc., a global public
relations firm with offices in the city.  Two telephone calls and an e-mail to Angela Hui, at Ketchum
in Hong Kong, requesting comment on Mehta’s departure weren’t
immediately returned.  Mehta said he planned to visit the U.S. before returning to
Hong Kong to establish a private equity firm which he expects to
open in April. One of the firm’s funds, to be called CCB Topgun
Fund 1, will invest in media, real estate and telecommunications
assets, he said.  About $25 million has been raised from private investors
and Mehta said he’s seeking a further $75 million. He declined
to reveal the private equity firm’s name, as that hasn’t yet
been determined.  To contact the reporter on this story:
