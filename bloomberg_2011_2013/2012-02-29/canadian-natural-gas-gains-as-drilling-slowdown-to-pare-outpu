Canadian natural gas rose after
seven straight days of declines amid signs that producers are
slowing drilling programs to help bolster prices.  Alberta  gas advanced 3.5 percent.  Encana Corp. (ECA) ,  Canada ’s
biggest gas producer, said Feb. 17 it would cut output and
direct drilling efforts to oil and natural-gas liquids. The
number of rigs drilling for gas in the U.S. dropped to 710 last
week, the seventh consecutive decline, according to  Baker Hughes
Inc. (BAKEGAS)  data.  “Horizontal gas rigs are down 26 percent from the average
October level,” said  Stephen Smith , an energy analyst and
president of Stephen Smith Energy Associates in Natchez,
 Mississippi . “A visibly slower U.S. gas production growth rate
lies ahead, probably during the second quarter.”  Alberta gas for March delivery rose 6.25 cents to C$1.87 a
gigajoule ($1.79 per million British thermal units) at 1:30 p.m.
New York time on  NGX , a Canadian Internet market. NGX gas has
dropped 11 percent this year.  NGX gas for April delivery advanced 3.75 cents, or 2
percent, to C$1.90 per gigajoule. Gas traded on the exchange is
shipped to users in Canada and the U.S. and priced on
 TransCanada Corp. (TRP) ’s Alberta system.  Natural gas for April delivery on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange  rose 7.9 cents, or 3.1 percent, to $2.598 per million
Btu as of 1:35 p.m. The futures have gained 3.8 percent this
month.  Volume on TransCanada’s Alberta system, which collects the
output of most of the nation’s gas wells, was 16.3 billion cubic
feet, 461 million below target.  Pipeline Flows  Gas was flowing at a daily rate of 2.85 billion cubic feet
at Empress, Alberta, where the fuel is transferred to
TransCanada’s main line.  At McNeil, Saskatchewan, where gas is transferred to the
Northern Border Pipeline for shipment to the Chicago area, the
daily flow rate was 2.08 billion cubic feet.  Available capacity on TransCanada’s British Columbia system
at Kingsgate was 596 million cubic feet. The system was forecast
to carry 2.06 billion cubic feet today, or 77 percent of its
capacity of 2.65 billion.  The volume on  Spectra Energy’s  British Columbia system,
which gathers the fuel in northeastern British Columbia for
delivery to Vancouver and the Pacific Northwest, totaled 2.99
billion cubic feet at 11:50 a.m.  To contact the reporter on this story:
