OAO Magnit (MGNT) ,  Russia ’s largest food
retailer by market value, headed for its highest in seven months
ahead of a rise in its weighting in the MSCI Russia index.  The stock rose 1.8 percent today to 3,650.10 rubles as of
10:58 a.m. in Moscow, on course for its strongest level since
Aug. 4. The stock added 1.1 percent to $29.40 per depositary
receipt in London trading.  Magnit’s weight in the MSCI Russia gauge will probably be
increased to 3 percent from 2.6 percent, effective March 1,
which may lead to as much as $140 million in inflows into the
stock, analysts at VTB Capital led by Alexey Zabotkin said in a
note today. The rebalancing of Magnit, the only change in the
MSCI Russia, is part of the index provider’s plan to implement
changes announced in February, according to VTB.  To contact the reporter on this story:
