Ethanol futures in  Chicago  fell for
the first time in more than a week after a government report
showed that supplies increased for an 11th consecutive week.  Prices sank after the Energy Department said ethanol
 stockpiles  jumped to a record 22 million barrels last week even
as  production  fell 2.5 percent, the most since September, to
896,000 barrels a day.  “Today’s lower DOE production number was no match for the
continuing ethanol inventory glut and weak gasoline demand,”
said Michael Breitenbach, an analyst and trader at Blue Ocean
Brokerage LLC in  New York .  Denatured ethanol for March delivery slipped 0.3 cent to
$2.26 a gallon on the Chicago Board of Trade, the first decline
since Feb. 21. Prices gained 4.3 percent this month.  Distillers are losing 13 cents per gallon of ethanol, based
on current prices for corn and the biofuel and assuming a bushel
of corn generates 2.75 gallons of ethanol, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
