Troika Dialog, the Russian brokerage
acquired by  OAO Sberbank (SBER) , hired mergers and acquisitions
specialists Dirk Werner and Angelo Morganti as part of 40 hires
to aid its expansion and challenge state rival VTB Capital.  Morganti was hired from Renaissance Capital while Werner
has worked for companies including  Bank of America Corp. (BAC) ,  Morgan
Stanley (MS)  and Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc., Moscow-based Troika
said in an e-mailed statement today.  “The importance of Troika’s M&A business to our clients
continues to grow as we see the cost of assets in central and
eastern Europe decrease and consolidation of businesses
increase,” Todd Berman, head of  investment banking , said in the
statement.  Sberbank Chief Executive Officer  German Gref , a former
economy minister, is seeking to turn the former Soviet Union’s
savings bank into a full-service financial firm that can compete
at home and abroad in areas from bond underwriting to  stock
trading . Troika plans to increase its 100 investment banking
employees by 25 percent to 40 percent this year, Berman said in
a Nov. 29 interview.  VTB Capital, created from scratch three years ago by VTB
Group, was the largest organizer of debt and equity sales last
year in  Russia , according to data compiled by Bloomberg. It
ranked 42nd among advisers in Russian M&A deals last year, seven
places ahead of Sberbank, the data show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
