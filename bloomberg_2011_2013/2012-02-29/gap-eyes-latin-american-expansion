Gap Inc. (GPS) , operator of the largest
U.S. apparel chain, plans to expand in Latin America after its
first namesake store in the region topped sales expectations.  The Gap store in Santiago, which opened in October, was
among the leading franchise performers out of 200 stores
worldwide, said Stefan Laban, managing director of strategic
alliances for Gap. The San Francisco-based company opened Gap
and Banana Republic stores in Panama and will expand to
Colombia, Uruguay and Peru, it said in a statement today. The
company will probably expand to  Brazil  as well, Laban said.  “We’re kind of making our way around Brazil,” Laban said
in an interview yesterday in Panama City. “Awareness is really
high in  Latin America . As everyone travels through Miami, they
all know the brand.”  Gap is turning to global expansion to improve profit, which
declined 40 percent in the fourth quarter from a year ago, the
retailer said on Feb. 23. International sales could drive 30
percent of income next year as the company opens stores
throughout  Asia  and Latin America, Laban said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
