Nasdaq OMX Group Inc. and Nord Pool
Spot ASâ€™s N2EX exchange plans to offer futures contracts based
on the profitability of U.K. power stations by the end of June.  The futures, known as sparks, are based on the
profitability of burning natural gas for power generation and
will be made available once the exchange develops an index
trusted by the market, Geir Reigstad, head of Nasdaq OMX
Commodities  Europe , said in an interview in London today. The
platform currently publishes a benchmark based on natural-gas
prices submitted by its members and the power price achieved in
its daily auction.  N2EX is in talks with energy price-reporting companies
including ICIS Heren, Platts and Argus, about gathering
information to help create a sparks index, Reigstad said.  N2EX handled 196 gigawatt-hours in its auction for next-day
power today. Baseload power rose 0.2 percent to 46.84 pounds a
megawatt-hour in the sale, which ends at about 10 a.m. in
London. Baseload power traded at 46.20 pounds in the over-the-
counter markets before the auction cleared, broker data on
Bloomberg show.  Nordic banks are among members of Nasdaq that will have
access to the U.K. power market from March 5, after the exchange
starts its new trading platform, Reigstad said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
