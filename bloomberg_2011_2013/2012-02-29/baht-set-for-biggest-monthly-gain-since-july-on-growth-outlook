Thailand ’s baht was poised for its
biggest monthly advance since July on optimism the economy will
rebound from the worst floods in 70 years that struck the nation
last year.  Global funds bought $1.4 billion more Thai equities than
they sold this month through yesterday, data from the stock
exchange show. The economy may expand by 5.5 percent to 6.5
percent this year, compared with last year’s growth of 0.1
percent, Arkhom Termpittayapaisith, secretary general of the
National Economic and Social Development Board, said on Feb. 20.  “With some risk appetite in the market, we still see some
dollar selling against the regional currencies and the  Thai baht 
is following others,” said Paisarn Lertkowit, a currency trader
in Bangkok at Bangkok Bank Pcl. “Investors may think Thailand
will have a V-shape recovery from last year’s floods, attracting
fund inflows.”  The baht strengthened 2.3 percent this month, the most
among  Asia ’s 11 most-traded currencies, to 30.24 per dollar as
of 8:47 a.m. in Bangkok, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The currency advanced 0.4 percent today and touched
30.22 on Feb. 24, the strongest level since Sept. 15.  Government data due later today will show that exports were
unchanged in January from a year earlier after decreasing in the
previous two months, according to the median forecast of
economists in a Bloomberg survey.  The yield on the government’s 3.25 percent notes due June
2017 rose 22 basis points, or 0.22 percentage point, to 3.30
percent this month, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporters on this story:
