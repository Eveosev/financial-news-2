Asian currencies gained, capping the
best two-month advance since April, after reports showed factory
production in Japan and  South Korea  beat economists’ estimates
and confidence among U.S. consumers reached a one-year high.  The Bloomberg-JPMorgan Asia Dollar  Index (ADXY) , which tracks the
region’s 10 most-traded currencies excluding the yen, rose 0.6
percent this month, adding to a 1.7 percent rally in January.
Overseas investors bought $6.3 billion more equities than they
sold in South Korea, Taiwan and  Thailand  in February, helping
spur a bull run in Asian stocks, identified as a 20 percent
increase from the previous low.  “The market is slowly removing the risk of a hard-landing
scenario as economic data are holding up well and not keeling
over,” said  Matthew Huang , a strategist in Singapore at
Macquarie Group Ltd. “You also have an easing in  Europe ’s
funding stress, which is a risk-positive event.”  Thailand’s baht gained 2.2 percent to 30.27 per dollar this
month as of 3:41 p.m. in Bangkok and climbed 0.3 percent today,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Malaysia’s ringgit
jumped 1.8 percent from Jan. 31 to 2.9930, a level last seen in
September.  India ’s rupee strengthened 1 percent to 48.9663 and
Taiwan’s dollar appreciated 0.7 percent to NT$29.42.  Demand for riskier assets helped lift the MSCI Asia-Pacific
Index of stocks by 5.1 percent this month and it’s up more than
20 percent from an Oct. 5 low. Global funds purchased a net $21
billion of equities in India, the Philippines, South Korea,
 Taiwan  and Thailand this year, according to stock exchange data.  Bonds Rally  Local-currency government  bonds  in  emerging markets  handed
investors a 2.6 percent return this year through yesterday,
according to a JPMorgan Chase & Co. index, the best start to a
year since 2006. An index tracking such debt in Asia’s 10
biggest markets rose 4.1 percent, according to HSBC Holdings Plc.  The Thai baht was set for its best month since July, while
Malaysia’s ringgit reached the strongest level in more than five
months.  “With some risk appetite in the market, we still see
dollar selling against regional currencies,” said Paisarn Lertkowit, a currency trader in Bangkok at Bangkok Bank Pcl.
“Investors may think Thailand will have a V-shaped recovery
from last year’s floods, attracting fund inflows.”  Factory, Confidence Reports  South Korea’s won completed a 0.4 percent advance in
February as  oil prices  traded near a one-week low after
retreating from the highest level in nine months reached on Feb.
24. The currency rose 0.5 percent to 1,118.960 per dollar today
and touched 1,117.90, the strongest level since Feb. 10.  Industrial production in South Korea rose  3.3 percent  last
month from December, the government said today, versus analysts’
forecasts for a 0.5 percent drop. In  Japan , factory output
increased  2 percent , according to a Trade Ministry report, more
than the 1.5 percent median estimate in a Bloomberg survey.
Consumer confidence in the U.S. reached a one-year high of 70.8
in February, according to the Conference Board.  “A retreat in oil prices and positive U.S. data set a
favorable tone for won trading,” said Lee Kun Hee, a currency
dealer at Korea Exchange Bank in Seoul. “Depending on month-end
export settlements, gains may widen later in the day.”  China ’s yuan gained 0.24 percent to 6.2936 per dollar in
 Shanghai  this month. The People’s Bank of China fixed its daily
reference rate 0.07 percent stronger at a 6.2919 today, the
highest level since the nation ended a fixed exchange rate in
July 2005.  “A record fixing shows the PBOC is still comfortable with
yuan appreciation even amid slowing economic growth,” said
Stella Lee, president of Success Futures & Foreign Exchange Ltd.
in  Hong Kong .  Philippine Rate Cut  The Philippine peso rose 0.2 percent to 42.747 per dollar
in  Manila , headed for a 0.3 percent gain in February, after the
central bank said yesterday it will tolerate appreciation
because of capital inflows.  Policy makers will cut the benchmark  interest rate  to 4
percent from 4.25 percent at a meeting tomorrow, according to 14
of 18 economists in a Bloomberg News survey. Three expect no
change and one a reduction to 3.75 percent.  Elsewhere, Indonesia’s rupiah slipped 0.4 percent to 9,029
per dollar in February, ending a two-month advance. The currency
