SodaStream International Ltd. (SODA)  had
its steepest drop in six months after the Israeli company said
sales of its soda machines grew at a slower pace than in the
previous period.  Shares of the Airport City, Israel-based company plummeted
14 percent to $40.75, the largest decline since Aug. 16.
SodaStream said global soda maker unit sales rose 8 percent to
767,000 in the fourth quarter after increasing 60 percent in the
third quarter.  “Until we have further clarity on the deceleration in soda
maker unit sales we see reason for pause,” Stifel Nicolaus
analyst Jim Duffy wrote in an e-mailed report today.  Fourth-quarter revenue increased 32 percent to 66.1 million
euros, beating a 60.9 million euro ($88.4 million) average
 estimate  of seven analysts in a Bloomberg survey.  To contact the reporter on this story:
