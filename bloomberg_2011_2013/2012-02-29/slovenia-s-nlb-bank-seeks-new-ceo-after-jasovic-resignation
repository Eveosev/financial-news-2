Nova Ljubljanska Banka d.d. is
seeking a new chief executive officer after Bozo Jasovic
resigned in December over Slovenia’s biggest bank’s failure to
sell its holding in  Mercator Poslovni Sistem (MELR)  d.d. to Croatia’s
Agrokor d.d.  Applications for the post at the state-owned bank should be
submitted by March 30., the Ljubljana-based lender said in an
advertisement published in the Slovenian Delo newspaper today.  NLB, which reported a third consecutive loss for 2011,
wants to raise 400 million euros ($539 million) by the end of
June to improve its capital ratio as demanded by the country’s
central bank and the European Banking Authority.  To contact the reporter on this story:
