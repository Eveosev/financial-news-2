Treasuries fell, the dollar rallied
and U.S. equities trimmed gains after Federal Reserve Chairman
 Ben S. Bernanke ’s remarks to Congress damped speculation of more
quantitative easing.  The 10-year U.S. Treasury note yield increased three basis
points to 1.98 percent and the Dollar Index rose as much as 0.3
percent after falling 0.2 percent earlier. The Standard & Poor’s
500 Index gained 0.2 percent at 10:19 a.m. in New York after
rising as much as 0.4 percent earlier.  While Bernanke told Congress that keeping monetary stimulus
is warranted, he said rising gasoline prices are likely to push
up inflation temporarily and the drop in the  unemployment rate 
has been more rapid than expected.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
