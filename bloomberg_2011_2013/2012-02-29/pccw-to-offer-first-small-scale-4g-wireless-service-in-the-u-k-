PCCW Ltd. (8) , Hong Kong’s biggest phone
company, said it will offer a small-scale high-speed wireless
network in south London in May, making it the first operator to
start a fourth-generation technology service in the U.K.  PCCW’s U.K. Broadband unit will deploy Huawei Technologies
Co Ltd. equipment and plans to offer services on a wholesale
basis, according to a statement today. The rollout would take
place in advance of a national auction of frequencies that is
scheduled for this year.  U.K. Broadband owns high-frequency spectrum that was
formerly used for an older wireless technology. PCCW, controlled
by billionaire Chairman  Richard Li , is seeking to move ahead of
operators including  France Telecom SA (FTE)  and  Deutsche Telekom AG (DTE) ’s
British venture in high-speed wireless services.  To contact the reporter on this story:
