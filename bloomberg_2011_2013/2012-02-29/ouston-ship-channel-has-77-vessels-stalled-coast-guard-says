Seventy-seven ships were idled at
the  Houston Ship Channel , which serves the largest U.S.
petroleum port, as fog limited visibility for a second day, the
U.S. Coast Guard said.  As of 6 a.m. local time, 34 ships were waiting to enter the
port and 43 were waiting to depart, Thomas Barbay, a Coast Guard
watch supervisor, said in a telephone interview. Houston ship
pilots had suspended boardings at 12:30 a.m. yesterday because
of poor visibility, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
