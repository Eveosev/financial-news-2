President  Richard Fisher  said the  U.S. economy  is accelerating
as businesses are increasing hiring and risks of a recession
have fallen in recent months.  “We worry less about a double-dip recession,” while risks
from the European debt crisis remain, Fisher said today in
response to questions following a speech at the Mexican Stock
Exchange.  “We do believe we have inflation under control at the
central bank, or near control,” Fisher said. “Now the object
is to put people back to work. It will only happen when private
businesses have more confidence. They are beginning to hire, but
it is a slow process.”  Fisher also repeated his view that the biggest U.S. banks
are too large and should be broken up. “The power of the five
largest banks is too concentrated,” he said. The banks have
become larger since the 2008 financial crisis and are now ‘too
bigger to fail.’”  To contact the reporters on this story:
