DreamWorks Animation SKG Inc. (DWA) , maker
of the “Kung Fu Panda” films, retreated the most in almost two
years in Nasdaq trading after reporting a 72 percent drop in
fourth-quarter profit, missing analysts’ estimates.  DreamWorks Animation fell 10 percent to $17.68 at 10:28
a.m. in  New York . The intraday drop of as much as 11 percent was
the biggest since May 24, 2010.  Analysts at Goldman Sachs advised investors today to sell
shares of the Glendale, California-based DreamWorks Animation.
The company  reported  yesterday that net income fell to $24.3
million, or 29 cents a share, from $85.2 million, or 99 cents, a
year earlier, on lower DVD sales. Analysts had projected profit
of 31 cents, the average of 13  estimates  compiled by Bloomberg.  “Kung Fu Panda 2,” one of two films DreamWorks Animation
released in 2011, reached the home-video market in mid-December.
 Michael Pachter , an analyst at Wedbush Securities in Los
Angeles, cut his profit estimate in a Feb. 24 note, citing weak
holiday demand for DVDs. This month, DreamWorks Animation
announced plans to develop entertainment products in  China .  “The overall home-entertainment environment remains
challenging,” Chief Executive Officer  Jeffrey Katzenberg  said
on a conference call. Consumer purchases of digital copies of
movies remain “modest,” he said.  Fourth-quarter sales declined 21 percent to $219 million
from $275.7 million a year earlier, beating analysts’ average
estimate of $205.1 million.  Earnings Estimate  Goldman Sachs today also cut its earnings estimates on
DreamWorks Animation, citing higher production costs and lower
consumer-products revenue.  DreamWorks Animation plans to announce new distribution
arrangements for its films by midyear or later, Katzenberg said.
Viacom Inc.’s Paramount Pictures distributes DreamWorks
Animation movies under a deal that expires at the end of this
year.  “We are looking at this as a major strategic opportunity
for us,” Katzenberg said. “We think there are a number of
different options. And we want to explore each and every one of
them.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
