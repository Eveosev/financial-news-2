Coca-Cola Hellenic Bottling Co SA (EEEK) ,
the world’s second-biggest bottler of Coke beverages, will cut
its production plants in  Greece  to three from five as the
recession hits revenue in the country.  Sales have declined over the last three years as Greek
consumers cut spending amid austerity measures, the Athens-based
company said in an e-mailed statement today. The cuts will
affect 30 employees, according to the e-mail.  The  Greek economy  is in its fifth year of recession and the
government has committed to additional austerity to secure a 130
billion-euro second international bailout.  Coca-Cola Hellenic is “consolidating its operational
structure to improve efficiency, reduce costs and continue to
contribute to the Greek economy,” according to the statement.  Production from the Thessaloniki and Patras plants will be
moved to Schimatari, Volos and Heraklion, according to the
statement.  Coca-Cola HBC reported a fourth-quarter net loss of 11.8
million euros ($15.9 million) compared with a profit of 22
million euros in the same period a year earlier.  Revenue rose
2.7 percent to 1.53 billion euros in the quarter, Coca-Cola HBC
said in a statement on Feb. 15.  To contact the reporter on this story:
