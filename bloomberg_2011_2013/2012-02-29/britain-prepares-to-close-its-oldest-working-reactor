Britain shut its oldest working
atomic reactor after 44 years.  The Oldbury site’s reactor 1, a 215-megawatt unit on the
banks of the River Severn in southwestern  England , halted at
about 11 a.m. London time after generating since 1967, Magnox
North Ltd. said by e-mail. Magnox North operates the reactor for
the U.K.’s Nuclear Decommissioning Authority.  The station closed because it’s not economical to keep it
open, Magnox North said in October. Radioactive fuel will be
removed from the reactors over the coming months, Phil Sprague,
a site director, said in an e-mailed statement.  The Oldbury power station has generated 137.5 terawatt-
hours since starting, enough electricity to supply 1 million
homes for 20 years, according to the statement.  The unit was granted permission to generate until the end
of this year after originally being scheduled to shut in 2008.
Magnox closed reactor 2 at the site at the end of June. The
company also operates the 980-megawatt Wylfa nuclear plant in
Anglesey,  Wales , due to shut at the end of this year. The NDA is
seeking to extend operations at Wylfa until the end of 2014,
according to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
