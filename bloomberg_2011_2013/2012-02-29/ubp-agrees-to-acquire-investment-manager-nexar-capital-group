Union Bancaire Privee, the Geneva-
based wealth manager that reorganized after clients lost money
with  Bernard Madoff , agreed to buy Nexar Capital Group for an
undisclosed sum.  Nexar, an alternative investment manager based in Paris and
 New York , had about $3 billion of assets under management at the
end of last year, UBP said today in an e-mailed  statement .  The purchase will bring UBP’s managed assets in the  hedge
funds  area to 13 billion Swiss francs ($14.5 billion), Jerome Koechlin, a spokesman for the company, said by telephone. The
deal should close by the end of April or May, subject to
regulatory approval, he said.  “UBP strongly believes in the important role of funds of
hedge funds,” the firm said in the statement. A fund of funds
charges customers to pick hedge-fund investments.  UBP oversaw total assets of 72 billion francs at the end of
December after acquiring ABN Amro Group NV’s Swiss wealth-
management unit.  To contact the reporter on this story:
