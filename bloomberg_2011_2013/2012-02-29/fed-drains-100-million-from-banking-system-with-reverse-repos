The  Federal Reserve  drained $100
million in  reserves  from the banking system when it arranged
one-day tri-party reverse repurchase agreements.  The Treasury transaction, part of a series of temporary
open-market operations that began in 2009, doesn’t represent any
change in monetary policy, according to a statement posted on
the  Federal Reserve  Bank of  New York ’s  website  yesterday.
Settlement is tomorrow.  In a reverse repo, the Fed lends securities for a set
period, temporarily draining cash from the banking system. At
maturity, the securities are returned to the Fed, and the cash
to its counterparties. The central bank added more than $1
trillion in extra cash to its balance sheet as part of its
effort to combat the financial crisis.  The repos were the first in the series of “readiness
exercises” to utilize eight new banks and two new primary
dealers added last year as counterparties. The Fed began adding
counterparties in 2010.  In a tri-party arrangement, a third party functions as the
agent for the transaction and holds the security as collateral.
JPMorgan Chase & Co. and  Bank of New York Mellon Corp. (BK)  are the
only banks that serve in a trade-clearing capacity in the tri-
party repo market.  To contact the reporter on this story:
