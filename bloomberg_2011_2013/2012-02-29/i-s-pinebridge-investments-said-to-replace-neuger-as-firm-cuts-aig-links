PineBridge Investments, the money-
management firm controlled by  Hong Kong  billionaire Richard Li,
replaced Chief Executive Officer Win Neuger as the firm reduces
ties to former parent  American International Group Inc. (AIG)   David Jiang, 46, previously the head of  Bank of New York
Mellon Corp. (BK) ’s money-management arm in  Asia , will assume the CEO
role tomorrow, New York-based PineBridge said today in a
statement. Neuger, 62, will stay on as vice chairman to “work
with sales and distribution teams across the firm to manage
client relationships,” according to the statement.  PineBridge, which had been used by AIG as a tool to invest
its own money, has had to develop new fundraising plans since
Li’s Pacific Century Group bought the New York-based firm in
March 2010 for about $500 million. PineBridge was among the
businesses disposed of by AIG following the New York-based
insurer’s near collapse in 2008 and $182.3 billion U.S.
government bailout.  Since the split, AIG has been shrinking the amount of
investment overseen by PineBridge, said two people with
knowledge of the firm’s operations who asked not to be named
because the company’s financial results are private. Assets
under management stood at $67.3 billion as of Dec. 31, 2011,
according to the  PineBridge website , down 19 percent from the
prior year.  Davies, Hornig  Neuger’s departure completes a management overhaul in which
non-AIG executives are now in charge. In  September 2010 , the
firm announced the appointment of former Standard Chartered Plc
CEO Mervyn Davies as non-executive chairman. Two months later,
PineBridge  hired  George Hornig, 57, a former Credit Suisse Group
AG executive, to serve as chief operating officer.  The firm is planning a push to raise more money from
investors in  emerging markets , and to expand the amount of
assets devoted to hedge funds and private equity, the people
said. According to the PineBridge website, such “alternative”
strategies represented about $22.1 billion of assets under
management as of Dec. 31, or about a third of the total.  Under Jiang, PineBridge will “build upon its current
franchise strengths across emerging and developed markets,”
Davies, 59, said in the statement.  Jiang worked at Bank of  New York  Mellon from January 2003
through October 2011, his  LinkedIn page  says. According to the
site, he “added over $1 billion of incremental revenue” during
his 7-year tenure as head of the Asian unit.  Li, 45, is the chairman of  PCCW Ltd. (8) , Hong Kong’s biggest
phone company. He is also the son of  Li Ka-shing , 83, who
according to Forbes Asia was Hong Kong’s richest man, with a
fortune estimated at $24 billion as of January 2011. In
September 2010, the elder Li’s foundation announced it had
invested $300 million with PineBridge.  Ryan O’Keeffe, a PineBridge spokesman, declined to say how
much of the Lis’ money was currently invested with PineBridge.  To contact the reporters on this story:
