Spanish wind farms produced a record
amount of power in February, covering 22 percent of the nation’s
electricity demand, the industry lobby said.  Wind generators produced 4,890 gigawatt hours of
electricity, equivalent to  Portugal ’s total power demand for the
month, making it the third-biggest  power source  behind coal and
nuclear reactors, the Wind Energy Business Association said in
an e-mailed press release.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
