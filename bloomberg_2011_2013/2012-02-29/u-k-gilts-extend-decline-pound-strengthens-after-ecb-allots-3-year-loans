U.K. 10-year government bonds
extended a decline and the pound rose against the euro and
dollar after the  European Central Bank  allotted 529.5 billion
euros ($712.2 billion) of three-year loans to banks, exceeding
analyst estimates.  The 10-year gilt yield rose three basis points to 2.13
percent at 10:44 a.m. London time.  The pound strengthened 0.4 percent to 84.27 pence per euro.
It appreciated 0.2 percent to $1.5939.  European banks were forecast to tap the ECB for 470 billion
euros in the longer-term refinancing operation, according to the
median estimate in a Bloomberg News survey of 28 economists. The
amount compares with 489 billion euros taken at the first
offering of such loans in December.  To contact the reporter on this story:
