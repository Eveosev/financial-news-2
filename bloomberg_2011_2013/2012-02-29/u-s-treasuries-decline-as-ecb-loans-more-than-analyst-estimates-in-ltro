U.S. Treasuries fell as the  European
Central Bank  allotted 529.5 billion euros ($713 billion) in its
second tranche of three-year loans to euro-area banks, exceeding
analyst estimates.  European banks were forecast to take 470 billion euros in
three-year loans from the ECB, according to the median estimate
of 28 economists in a Bloomberg News survey. The amount compares
with 489 billion euros borrowed in the first three-year longer-
term refinancing operation in December.  Ten-year  yields  rose two basis points, or 0.02 percentage
point, to 1.96 percent at 10:30 a.m. London time, according to
Bloomberg Bond Trader prices. The 2 percent security due
February 2022 fell 6/32, or $1.88 per $1,000 face amount, to 100
11/32.  Benchmark 10-year yields rose four basis points on Dec. 21,
when the ECB awarded the previous round of three-year cash.  To contact the reporter on this story:
