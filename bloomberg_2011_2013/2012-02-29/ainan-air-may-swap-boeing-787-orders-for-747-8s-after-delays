Hainan Airlines Co. (600221) , backed by the
government of  China ’s Hainan province, may swap  Boeing Co. (BA)  787
Dreamliner orders for larger 747-8s following delivery delays,
said Chen Feng, the chairman of its parent.  “If it is a good airplane we will consider it because the
787 has taken so long to come out,” HNA Group’s Chen said
yesterday in an interview in Beijing. The late arrival of the
Dreamliners has caused “a lot of trouble,” he said. The
carrier has ordered 10 787-8s, according to Boeing’s  website .  The airline, which intends to grow its fleet at least 10
percent a year, may opt for the larger 747-8 as China’s economic
growth spurs travel, Chen said. A swap would also boost the
backlog for Chicago-based Boeing’s biggest passenger plane,
which has won 36 orders in more than five years.  “We’re loyal customers,” Chen said. “We’re promoting the
development of Sino-U.S. economic relations.”  Hainan Air closed unchanged at 5.10 yuan in Shanghai
trading today. It has risen 14 percent this year.  Boeing delivered the first 787 to All Nippon Airways Co. in
September, more than three years late, because of delays caused
by new production techniques and materials. The plane is the
first to be largely built from carbon-fiber reinforced plastics.  China Eastern Airlines Corp., the nation’s second-biggest
carrier, dropped 24 orders for the 787 in favor of 45 737 planes
last year, citing delays. China Southern Airlines Co. and Air
China Ltd., the nation’s other two big carriers, still hold
Dreamliner orders.  HNA Investments  HNA Group, which also controls Hong Kong Airlines, as well
as having investments in airports, retail and shipping, is still
interested in acquisitions in  Europe , Chen said. The group last
year withdrew from talks to invest in  Hungary ’s now-shuttered
state-owned carrier Malev Zrt.  Deutsche Lufthansa AG is the biggest customer for the 747-8
Intercontinental, with 20 orders. Boeing has also sold the
aircraft to  Korean Air Lines Co. (003490) , Arik Air and unidentified VIP
customers.  Boeing expects to complete the test flights needed for the
747-8 to win certification for commercial service within a week,
it said Feb. 28. The freighter version entered service last year.  The 747-8 has a  list price  of $332.9 million, compared with
the 787-8’s $193.5 million cost, according to Boeing’s website.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
