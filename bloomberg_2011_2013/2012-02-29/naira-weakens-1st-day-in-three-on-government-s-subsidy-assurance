Nigeria ’s naira weakened for the
first time in three days as dollar demand increased after the
government promised refunds to importers for selling fuel at
subsidised rates.  The currency of  Africa ’s largest oil producer depreciated
0.1 percent to 157.73 per dollar as of 4:06 p.m. in Lagos, the
commercial capital, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Nigeria is revising its 2012 budget to include 888 billion
nairas ($5.6 billion) in fuel subsidies as the spending plans
put to lawmakers in December did not make provisions for the
financial assistance, the  Finance Ministry  said in a statement
Feb. 16.  “The non-inclusion of subsidies in the 2012 budget
proposal created uncertainty over payments, with the result that
some importers stayed away, causing a fall in dollar demand, ”
Sewa Wusa, currency analyst at Lagos-based Sterling Capital
Ltd., said today by phone. “Dollar demand is rising from oil
imports after the government assured payments.”  President Goodluck Jonathan backed out of a plan last month
to fully remove fuel subsidies after gasoline prices more than
doubled from 65 naira a liter, sparking a strike by labor
unions.  To contact the reporter on this story:
