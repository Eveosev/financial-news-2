Nedbank Group Ltd. (NED) , the South
African bank controlled by  Old Mutual Plc (OML) , said full-year profit
rose 26 percent after expanding its retail banking network and
charging clients more fees for transactions.  Net income climbed to 6.5 billion rand ($870 million) in
the year ended in December from 5.14 billion rand a year
earlier, the Johannesburg-based lender said in a statement
today. Earnings per share excluding one-time items climbed 25
percent to 13.40 rand, beating the 13.34 rand  median estimate 
for adjusted earnings per share from 15 analysts. The company
increased its full-year dividend 26 percent to 6.05 rand.  Chief Executive Officer  Mike Brown  said Nedbank would slow
its pace of expansion to contain costs after acquiring 160,000
retail customers, adding 121 outlets and 400 automated teller
machines and extending banking hours in 60 branches during the
year. Nedbank, the third-largest lender in  South Africa , hasn’t
sought growth through acquisitions on the rest of the continent,
unlike larger rivals  Standard Bank Group Ltd. (SBK)  and FirstRand Ltd.  “The net interest income and margins were higher than I
expected,” Faizal Moolla, a banking analyst at Avior Research
Ltd. in  Cape Town , said in a telephone interview today. “It was
a fair set of results, but I’m still concerned about the
operating expenses.”  The  stock  rose as much 3.4 percent and was 1.1 percent
higher at 161.22 rand at 10:55 a.m. in Johannesburg trading.  Slowing Expansion  Nedbank, which said it will meet its medium- to long-term
earnings growth target in 2012, was the second-best performing
stock on the six-member  FTSE/JSE Africa Banks Index (JBNKS)  last year
after RMB Holdings Ltd., gaining more than 11 percent.  Brown said Nedbank’s slower expansion should reduce the
ratio of expenses to non-interest income to “mid to high single
digits” this year from 14 percent in 2011.  Nedbank’s  return on equity , excluding goodwill, grew to
15.3 percent in 2011 from 13.4 percent a year earlier. Brown
said there’s “more work ahead” to meet the bank’s target ratio
of 18 to 19 percent, and more room to reduce bad debts.  “What was disappointing was that credit impairments and
retail impairments didn’t improve as much as expected,” Avior’s
Moolla said.  Nedbank has an alliance with  Ecobank (ETI)  Transnational Inc.,
 Africa ’s most geographically diverse retail lender. Last year,
Nedbank provided the Togo-based company with a three-year, $285
million loan in an agreement that will allow it to take a stake
of as much as 20 percent in Ecobank in the next two years.  Brown said Nedbank is looking at the potential cost of
buying that stake, which could be equal to 1 percent of its core
Tier 1 capital adequacy ratio. If the lender takes a 20 percent
stake in the West African bank after December 2013, it will have
access to that institution’s profits, Brown said.  Through Ecobank, Nedbank has access to 36 African countries
with over 2,000 outlets.  While South African rivals may make profit from African
operations faster, “we unashamedly run this bank for the long
term,” Brown said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
