The U.S Commodity Futures Trading
Commission has delayed a vote on a rule defining swap dealers
under the Dodd-Frank Act and may take up the measure on March
20, according to a person briefed on the schedule.  The CFTC’s five commissioners were planning to vote March 9
on the rule that will determine which banks,  hedge funds  and
energy companies face the highest capital and collateral
requirements, said the person who spoke on condition of
anonymity because the schedule isn’t public. The agency had
already delayed a Feb. 23 vote on the regulation.  The regulation is among the most contentious measures
required by Dodd-Frank and has led to hundreds of meetings and
comment letters involving firms such as Vitol Inc., DRW Holdings
LLC and  JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM)  Energy companies have said they
shouldn’t be considered dealers because they use swaps to reduce
risk tied to oil and natural gas assets.  Dodd-Frank, the regulatory overhaul enacted in response to
the 2008 credit crisis, requires the CFTC and Securities and
Exchange Commission to complete rules defining which firms are
dealers or other major swap users.  To contact the reporter on this story:
