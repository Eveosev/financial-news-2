An Australian and his company were
charged with conspiring to export sensitive military and other
technology to  Iran  from the U.S., the  Justice Department  said.  David Levick, 50, and ICM Components Inc., located in a
suburb of Sydney,  Australia , were accused yesterday in an
indictment filed in federal court in  Washington  of conspiring to
defraud the U.S. and violating the International Emergency
Economic Powers Act and Arms Export Control Act, the government
said in a statement. The technology is used in missiles, drones,
torpedoes and helicopters, according to the statement.  Levick is seeking legal advice after being informed of the
indictment “about half an hour ago,” he said in a telephone
interview just before noon in Sydney today. If convicted, he
faces as long as five years in prison for the conspiracy count
and 20 years for each of four Economic Powers Act violations,
prosecutors said.  Levick and ICM solicited purchase orders from a trading
company in Iran from 2007 to 2009, according to the statement.
They then placed the orders on behalf of a representative for
the trading company for goods and services that couldn’t be
purchased directly from the U.S. without government permission,
the Justice Department said.  Levick said he co-owns with his wife the business and
described it as a “one-man” operation that supplies semi-
conductors. He declined to comment on the allegations and said
he was about to telephone his lawyer.  “What I’ve been told is not to speak to anybody,” he
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
