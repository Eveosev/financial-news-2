The yuan advanced the most in three
weeks after the People’s Bank of  China  set the currency’s
 reference rate  at the strongest level on record.  The central bank raised the daily fixing by 0.07 percent to
6.2919 per dollar, the strongest level since a dollar peg ended
in July 2005. Oil prices rose 0.5 percent to $107.04 a barrel in
 New York  after sliding 3 percent in the previous two days. Crude
reached a nine-month high of $109.95 on Feb. 24. The  European
Central Bank  will probably grant euro-area lenders 470 billion
($633 billion) euros of loans this week, according a Bloomberg
News survey, which may spur inflows into emerging markets.  “A record fixing shows that the PBOC is still comfortable
with yuan appreciation even though economic growth is slowing,”
said Stella Lee, president of Success Futures & Foreign Exchange
Ltd. in Hong Kong. The “slide in  oil prices  also boosted
sentiment,” she said.  The yuan strengthened 0.09 percent, the most since Feb. 8,
to close at 6.2936 per dollar in Shanghai, extending this
month’s gain to 0.24 percent, according to the China Foreign
Exchange Trade System. It touched 6.2884 on Feb. 10, the
strongest level since the country unified the official and
market exchange rates at the end of 1993. The currency is
allowed to trade 0.5 percent either side of the reference rate.  In Hong Kong’s offshore market, the yuan advanced 0.1
percent this month to 6.2940 per dollar. It was little changed
today. Twelve-month non-deliverable forwards gained 0.07 percent
to 6.2822 today, a 0.2 percent premium to the onshore spot rate,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The contracts were
little changed in February.  To contact the reporter on this story:
