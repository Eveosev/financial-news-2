OAO Russian Railways, the state-run
rail monopoly, booked 6.5 billion rubles ($222 million) in
asset-impairment charges because of  Libya â€™s military conflict.  Russian Railways had to suspend building a $1.5 billion
railroad linking Sirte and Benghazi and lost money after ongoing
construction works went unpaid, the Moscow-based company said in
its earnings report for the six months ended June 30.  To contact the reporters on this story:
