Brazil , the world’s biggest soybean
grower after the U.S., will harvest 70 million metric tons of
the oilseed this year, down 7 percent from 75.3 million a year
earlier, according to a U.S. Department of Agriculture agency.  Soybean exports may fall to 33 million tons in the
marketing year that began Feb. 1, down from 33.79 million a year
earlier, the USDA’s Foreign Agricultural Service said in a
 report  posted today on its website. Reserves before the 2013
harvest may fall to 576,000 tons from 2.85 million estimated
this year, according to the report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
