Bankrupt  Lehman Brothers Holdings
Inc. (LEHMQ) , in a settlement with its Bermuda-based Lehman Re life
insurance unit, reduced the subsidiary’s $2.3 billion in claims
to $1 billion, according to a court filing.  The settlement between Lehman and two affiliates and Lehman
Re and a subsidiary and creditor, resolves claims connected to a
1999 repurchase agreement involving residential and commercial
mortgages and a 2007 “Net Worth Maintenance Agreement,”
lawyers for the entities said in a filing in federal bankruptcy
court in Manhattan.  The repurchase agreement claim is now valued at $490
million, and the maintenance agreement is now an allowed claim
of $415 million, the attorneys said.  Lehman Re filed a Chapter 15 petition for  bankruptcy
protection  in August 2009, citing alleged shortfalls on its
reinsurance obligations and lawsuits against it in the U.S.  Lehman, which is preparing its first payment to creditors
after more than three years in bankruptcy, has been whittling
down claims and settling disputes to boost the distribution. The
former investment bank has said it could distribute
$11.9 billion to $14.7 billion initially, depending on cash
reserves for disputed claims. Lehman has estimated disputed
claims at $112 billion.  Attorneys for the Lehman entities are seeking bankruptcy
court approval for the settlement.  The case is In re Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc., 08-13555,
 U.S. Bankruptcy Court , Southern District of  New York 
(Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
