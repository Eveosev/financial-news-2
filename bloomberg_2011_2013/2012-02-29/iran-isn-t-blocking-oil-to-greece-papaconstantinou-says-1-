Iran  isn’t disrupting supplies of
crude oil to Greece, Greek Environment, Energy and Climate
Change Minister  George Papaconstantinou  said.  “At the moment, we have contracts with Iran that are being
executed normally,” Papaconstantinou said today in an interview
in Athens. “We have had no disruption so far, there is no
disruption and we do not expect any disruption until the start
of the sanctions period.”  The European Union, including Greece, on Jan. 23 agreed to
ban crude imports from Iran from July 1 to pressure the country
over its nuclear program.  Iran refused to supply 500,000 barrels of crude oil to a
Greek tanker for delivery to  Hellenic Petroleum SA (ELPE) ,  Greece ’s
largest refiner, the Tehran-based Fars News Agency reported Feb.
26.  “Greece’s problem is that, because of financing issues,
the oil bought from Iran moved to more than 30 percent of our
total from less than 10 percent in the last year owing to easier
financial terms given by Iran,” Papaconstantinou said.  Greece’s European partners are aware of this situation and
they have said “very clearly” that they will assist the
country to find alternative means of getting a secure supply of
oil if a problem arises, he said.  “The exact way this will happen will depend on Greece’s
economic and financial situation,” Papaconstantinou said. “We
hope things will have normalized” by the start of the sanctions
period and that “it will be easier for us to get oil from other
sources as we will have finished the Greek debt exchange program
and passing legislation for Greece’s new aid program.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
