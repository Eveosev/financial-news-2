The Obama administration will need
Congress to pass legislation for swift action on trade deals to
complete an accord with at least eight Pacific nations by the
end of the year, U.S. Trade Representative  Ron Kirk  said.  Administration officials are in talks with congressional
leaders on a bill, Kirk told reporters today after testifying to
the House Ways and Means Committee. The so-called fast-track
authority granted to the White House, which bans amendments,
limits debate and ensures an up-or-down vote on trade agreements
submitted by the president, expired after Democrats won control
of Congress under President George W. Bush in 2007.  “In order for us to conclude the agreement we’re going to
have to have trade-promotion authority,” Kirk said. “And at
the right time we will work out the terms of that with the
leadership of the committees.”  President Barack Obama is pursuing a deal with Australia,
Chile, Peru and  Singapore , Malaysia,  New Zealand , Vietnam and
Brunei that would be the biggest for the U.S. since the North
American Free Trade Agreement that took effect in 1994.  Japan ,
along with NAFTA parties Canada and Mexico have expressed
interest in joining the Pacific talks. If they do, it would be
the largest free-trade deal ever for the U.S.  To contact the reporter on this story:
