Bank BPH SA (BPH)  fell to a one-week low
after UBS AG recommending selling the Polish lending unit of
General Electric Co. following gains this year.  Bank BPH lost as much as 2.7 percent to 42.52 zloty, the
lowest since Feb. 23 and traded 1.6 percent lower to 42.99 zloty
at 11:33 a.m. in Warsaw. The shares have advanced 36 percent
this year, the second-best performance in the  WIG Banking Index. (WIGBANK)   BPH had its recommendation cut to “sell” from “neutral”
at UBS, which said the bank traded at 16.3 times its 2012
estimated earnings, compared with a 12.7 average for Polish
lenders and a 10.1 average for peers in emerging markets in
 Europe , the  Middle East  and  Africa .  To contact the reporter on this story:
