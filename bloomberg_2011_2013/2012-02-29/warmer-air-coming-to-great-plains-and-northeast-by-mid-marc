The upper Great Plains to the U.S.
Northeast are expected to warm up by mid-March, according to
forecasters.  Average temperatures may be 8 degrees Fahrenheit (4.4
Celsius) above normal in those regions, which includes Chicago
and  New York , from March 10 to March 14 said  Matt Rogers ,
president of Commodity Weather Group LLC in Bethesda, Maryland.  “With few exceptions here and there, the models are
generally offering a very warm pattern for much of the U.S. and
southern Canada over the next two weeks,” Rogers said in a note
to clients.  Traders watch temperature predictions to gauge energy use
and demand. About 51 percent of U.S. households use natural gas
for heating, according to the Energy Department.  Forecasters are split about the location of warmer weather
next week.  Rogers and MDA EarthSat Weather in Gaithersburg, Maryland,
predict above-normal temperatures will take hold in the eastern
U.S., with the warmest weather centered on  Chicago  and the Great
Lakes, from March 5 to March 9.  Weather Derivatives’ David Salmon said he expects the East
Coast to cool down, with temperatures dropping about 6 degrees
below normal along the southern coast from March 6 to March 10.  The warmest air will be over the Great Plains, according to
Salmon, located in Belton, Missouri.  The normal average temperature in New York for March 7 is
about 40 degrees, according to MDA. It’s 36 in Boston, 41 in
Philadelphia, 35 in Chicago, 43 in  St. Louis , 56 in Dallas, 61
in Houston, 52 in Atlanta, 45 in Seattle and 58 in Burbank,
California.  To contact the reporter on this story:
