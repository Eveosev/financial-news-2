The premiums for Light Louisiana
Sweet and Heavy Louisiana Sweet oils over the benchmark West
Texas Intermediate widened as the difference between WTI and
Brent increased.  Brent’s premium to WTI based on April futures contracts
widened 82 cents to $15.82 a barrel. When Brent increases versus
WTI, it strengthens the value of low-sulfur U.S. grades that
compete with West African oil priced against the European
benchmark.  Light Louisiana Sweet (USCSLLSS) ’s premium to WTI added 65 cents to
$17.30 a barrel as of 11:57 a.m. in  New York , according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. Heavy Louisiana Sweet increased 35 cents
to a premium of $19.75.  Thunder Horse’s premium to WTI added $1 to $16.75 and Mars
Blend’s increased 55 cents to $13.05.  Poseidon (USCSPOSE) ’s premium
increased 10 cents to $12.60 a barrel.  Southern Green Canyon (USCSSGCN) ’s
premium added 50 cents to $12.50 over WTI.  West Texas Sour (USCSWTSM) ’s discount widened 25 cents to $3.25 a
barrel.  Syncrude (USCSSYNS)  oil’s discount narrowed $2 to $4.  Western
Canada Select (USCSWCAS) ’s discount widened $2.75 to $33.25 a barrel.
 Bakken (USCSUHC1)  oil’s spread was unchanged at $14 a barrel below WTI.  To contact the reporter on this story:
