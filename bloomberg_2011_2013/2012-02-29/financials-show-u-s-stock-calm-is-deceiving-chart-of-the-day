Investors are less immune to the
risks in U.S. stocks than a decline in the market’s volatility
would indicate, according to Nicholas Colas, ConvergEx Group’s
chief market strategist.  The CHART OF THE DAY shows how Colas reached his conclusion
in a report yesterday: by looking at implied volatility, or the
potential stock-price swings, built into options on the shares
of companies in the  Dow Jones Industrial Average .  Financial stocks in the Dow industrials --  American Express
Co. (AXP) ,  Bank of America Corp. (BAC) ,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM)  and Travelers
Cos. -- have failed to keep pace as a group with a broader
decline in implied volatility.  The chart illustrates the relationship by comparing the
average reading for the four stocks with a similar figure for
the 30 Dow industrials. The latter gauge fell within the past
week to its lowest level since May.  “People aren’t giving the financials a pass,” Colas said
yesterday in an interview. The disparity between the industry
group and the Dow average shows stocks are poised for “a slow
grind higher,” the New York-based strategist said, even though
the broader easing of volatility suggests otherwise.  The Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility Index, or the
VIX, fell on Feb. 23 to its lowest level since July. The earlier
low in the so-called fear gauge preceded a slump that sent the
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index down as much as 18 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
