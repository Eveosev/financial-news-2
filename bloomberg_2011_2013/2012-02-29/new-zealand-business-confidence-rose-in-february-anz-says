New Zealand business confidence rose
to a five-month high in February, while a second gauge of sales
and profits also advanced, according to a survey by ANZ National
Bank Ltd.  A net 28 percent of companies expect the economy will
improve over the next 12 months, up from 16.9 percent in
December, according to the survey released in Wellington today.
The bank doesn’t publish a report for January.  A measure of expectations for companies’ own sales and
earnings increased to 31.2 percent from 25.7 percent in
December. The net figure subtracts the number of pessimists from
the number of optimists.  To contact the reporter on this story:
