Bank of Montreal ,  Canada ’s fourth-
biggest bank, promoted Darryl White as head of global investment
and corporate banking, replacing William Butt who is retiring.  White is deputy head of investment and corporate banking in
Canada at the BMO Capital Markets unit. He will take on the new
role March 31, the Toronto-based bank said today in a statement.
White takes over from Butt, 49, who announced last week that
he’s retiring in April after 19 years with the firm.  White joined BMO Capital Markets in 1994 and has covered
various areas including mergers and acquisitions, diversified
industries, and communications and technology, the bank said.
He’ll report to Tom Milroy, chief executive officer of BMO
Capital Markets.  The firm also said it promoted Charles Gavsie to head of
foreign exchange products, overseeing global foreign exchange
and sales trading. Luke Seabrook was promoted to head of
financial products and debt products. Both are effective March
