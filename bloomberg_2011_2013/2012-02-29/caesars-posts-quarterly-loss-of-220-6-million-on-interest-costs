Caesars Entertainment Corp. (CZR)  posted a
widening loss of $220.6 million in its last full period as a
private company, as growth at its  Las Vegas  casino resorts
fueled a 2.4 percent increase in revenue.  Fourth-quarter net loss expanded to $1.76 a share from a
loss of $196.7 million, or $1.71, a year earlier, after interest
expenses gained 32 percent, Las-Vegas Caesars said today in a
statement. Revenue rose to $2.17 billion at the casino chain,
which completed an initial public offering this month.  Caesars, with about $19.8 billion in long-term debt, has
cut costs and its Caesars Palace and Planet Hollywood properties
will perform better than Las Vegas generally, JPMorgan Chase &
Co. credit analysts Susan Berliner and Richard DeGaetani said in
a Feb. 23 report. Gambling revenue on the  Las Vegas Strip  rose
5.1 percent in 2011, its second annual increase, a sign that the
recovery in the biggest U.S. betting market is gaining strength.  “We remain more bullish with regards to Las Vegas versus
all other markets,” the New York-based analysts wrote.  Caesars added 7.6 percent to $11.68 at 9:49 a.m. in  New
York . The shares have gained 21 percent since the offering.  Property earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and
amortization, a closely watched measure of  cash flow , increased
7.6 percent to $492.8 million, the company said.  Caesars raised $16.3 million in an initial public offering
on Feb. 7 of less than 2 percent of its stock. The IPO gave
firms such as Paulson & Co., the hedge fund run by billionaire
 John Paulson , a chance to exit and potentially return cash to
investors.  The company was taken private by  Apollo Global Management
LLC (APO)  and TPG Capital in 2008 in a $30.7 billion transaction. The
IPO, priced at $9 a share, gave Caesars a $22.5 billion
enterprise value, including debt.  To contact the reporter on this story:
