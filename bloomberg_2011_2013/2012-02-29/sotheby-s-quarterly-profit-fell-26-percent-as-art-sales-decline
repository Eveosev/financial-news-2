Sotheby’s (BID) , the publicly traded
auctioneer of fine arts and collectibles, said fourth quarter
profit fell 26 percent as sales slid.  The New York company’s net income fell to $71.5 million
from $96.2 million a year earlier. It earned $1.04 a share, less
than the average $1.25 estimate of six analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg. Quarterly revenue fell 11 percent, to $284 million.  A year earlier, Sotheby’s had its most profitable quarter
since 2008.  Sotheby’s shares fell 62 cents today to $39.34 in New York
Stock Exchange composite trading. They’re up 38 percent this
year, more than four times the gain of the Standard & Poor’s 500
Index. The shares declined 20 percent in the past 52 weeks.  The results were released today after the close of regular
trading.  To contact the writer on the story:
