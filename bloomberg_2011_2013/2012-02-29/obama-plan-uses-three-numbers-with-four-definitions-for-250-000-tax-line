In President Barack Obama’s tax
policy, $250,000 means $250,000 -- except when it means $247,450
or $267,500.  Obama’s simple 2008 campaign pledge to prevent tax
increases for all but the highest earners has been transformed
into tax-code arcana. The dividing line in his speeches -
-$250,000 a year for married couples and $200,000 for
individuals -- is established in  his policies  with four separate
definitions and three different numbers.  “It’s much more complicated than it sounds,” said Nick
Kasprak, an analyst at the  Tax Foundation , a Washington group
that favors a simpler tax code.  The multiple definitions show what happens when a political
talking point becomes a tax proposal. Across-the-board income
tax cuts first enacted in 2001 and 2003 expire Dec. 31, and
Obama wants Congress to continue the breaks for people below the
threshold.  Obama’s line separating those who would face tax increases
-- fewer than 2 percent of U.S. taxpayers -- and the rest who
wouldn’t was central to his 2008 campaign. As president, he has
urged Congress to adopt a similar approach.  Technical proposals from the Treasury Department meet
Obama’s objectives of preventing tax increases for anyone making
less than his thresholds and even for some people who make more
money than that. They also make it tougher for taxpayers to
figure out in advance what tax breaks they will receive and
which they will lose.  Thriving on Complexity  The administration and Congress thrive on complexity that
makes people throw up their hands and write a check for whatever
their accountant or tax software says they owe, said Jack
Bogdanski, a tax law professor at Lewis &  Clark University  in
 Portland ,  Oregon .  “They can do whatever they want because they know nobody
can figure it out any more,” Bogdanski said. “It’s all handed
over to  computer programs .”  The three numbers and four definitions used to set the line
for tax increases can be found in the administration’s budget
plan for fiscal 2013 and the health care law that Obama signed
in 2010.  The most significant definition of the $250,000 barrier in
Obama’s budget separates the top two brackets from the rest.
Above that line, taxpayers’ wages, business income and dividends
would be taxed at 36 percent or 39.6 percent and their  capital
gains  would be taxed at 20 percent.  They also would face limits on deductions and exclusions
such as employer-sponsored health insurance and interest on
municipal bonds.  Tax Arithmetic  Tax brackets are based on taxable income after deductions
and exemptions. Obama’s plan starts with $250,000 and subtracts
a standard deduction for married couples and two personal
exemptions. There is a similar calculation for single people.  The administration decided to set the $250,000 and $200,000
thresholds in 2009 dollars and index them for inflation. In
2013, when Obama wants the tax increase to take effect, the
thresholds for taxable income would be $247,450 for married
couples and $203,950 for individuals, according to Treasury
Department estimates.  Some people could use deductions to stay out of the higher
brackets. A married couple with $280,000 in wages wouldn’t face
any tax rate increase if they paid $15,000 in state taxes and
donated $30,000 to charity.  The second definition, also in the budget, sets the
threshold for limits on personal exemptions and itemized
deductions. The numbers are indexed for inflation and apply to
adjusted gross income, a broader measure than taxable income.  Adjusted Gross Income  Under this standard, married couples with adjusted gross
incomes exceeding $267,500 would face higher taxes in 2013, as
would individuals with  adjusted gross income s of more than
$214,000, according to the Treasury Department.  The third and fourth definitions became law as part of the
2010 health-care overhaul.  Starting in 2013, annual wages of more than $250,000 for
married couples and $200,000 for individuals will be subject to
an additional 0.9 percent tax. That’s a different concept of
income, because it’s based only on  wages .  Unearned income, such as capital gains and dividends, will
be subject to a 3.8 percent tax for high earners. The tax will
apply to those exceeding the $250,000 and $200,000 thresholds,
using a modified definition of adjusted gross income. It will be
levied only on unearned income that pushes the taxpayer over the
threshold.  Not Indexed  Unlike the proposals in the president’s budget, the
thresholds in the health care law aren’t indexed for inflation
and will remain at $250,000 and $200,000 unless Congress acts.
That means they will capture more money and more taxpayers over
time.  Even without the Obama proposals, the  tax code  is full of
varying definitions of income, said Melissa Labant, director of
tax advocacy at the  American Institute of Certified Public
Accountants , a trade group in Washington.  “It increases confusion, frustration and creates a
perception that the tax system is unfair,” she said. “You want
to know in advance whether or not a particular benefit applies
to you, particularly on the business side and the cash-flow
side.”  The changes proposed by Obama would come on top of the
alternative minimum tax, which already requires many people in
the same income group to pay more. The AMT, a parallel tax
system, requires taxpayers to calculate their liability twice,
once under the regular code and once under a system that denies
some deductions and exemptions.  Some of the complexity stems from a desire to have
statutory tax rates that seem lower than they really are,
Bogdanski said. Obama’s plan would return the top income rate to
39.6 percent while limiting deductions and exemptions.  “Own up,” Bogdanski said. “Make it 40. Make it 41. Just
tell the truth about what you’re doing. The game-playing with
giving you deductions and taking them away, it’s absurd.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
