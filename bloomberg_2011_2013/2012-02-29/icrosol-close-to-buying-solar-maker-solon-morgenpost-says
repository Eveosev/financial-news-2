United Arab Emirates-based solar-
cell maker Microsol International is close to agreeing to buy
 Solon SE (SOO1) , a German solar-panel maker in bankruptcy proceedings,
Berliner Morgenpost reported.  The deal would include keeping about 400 of Solon’s
employees in Berlin, where it’s based, and firing about two
dozen, the newspaper said, without saying where it got the
information.  Solon’s insolvency administrator Ruediger Wienberg from the
law firm HWW Wienberg Wilhelm plans to issue a statement on the
bankruptcy proceedings toward the end of the week, Christoph
Moeller, his spokesman, said by phone today. He declined to
comment on the ongoing negotiations.  To contact the reporter on this story:
