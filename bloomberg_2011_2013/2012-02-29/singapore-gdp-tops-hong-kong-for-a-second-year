Singapore ’s economy surpassed Hong
Kong’s for a second year as the Southeast Asian nation gained
from a stronger currency, faster population growth and expansion
of the casino and pharmaceutical industries.  The CHART OF THE DAY shows Singapore’s gross domestic
product was S$326.8 billion in 2011, about $260 billion based on
average exchange rates or $252 billion based on year-end
currency rates. In Hong Kong, GDP was HK$1.89 trillion, or
$243.3 billion using the average and $243.8 billion based on Dec.
30 rates.  Singapore’s dollar appreciated 10 percent against the
greenback in the three years through December 2011, while Hong
Kong has pegged its currency at about HK$7.8 per dollar since 
1983. Hong Kong, with a population of 7.1 million, remains the
larger financial center. Still, Singapore has diversified by 
luring pharmaceutical companies to build plants and ending a 
four-decade ban on casinos. Its population has risen by more 
than 1 million since the beginning of 2005, to 5.2 million, 
based on government data that include residents and transient 
workers.  “The fact that the  Hong Kong dollar  is pegged to a  U.S.
dollar  that has weakened and the fact the  Singapore dollar  has
been strengthening has been one major point especially in the
past two, three years,” said Chua Hak Bin, an economist at Bank
of America Merrill Lynch. “Singapore’s very liberal immigration
policy and the willingness to push for some new industries such
as the biomedical sector and gaming has seen some success.”  Singapore’s exchange rate averaged S$1.2573 last year,
compared with an average of S$1.3632 in 2010. The Hong Kong
dollar’s average of HK$7.7843 in 2011 was little changed from
HK$7.7688. Further gains by Singapore’s currency may be limited
as immigration rules were tightened after a voter backlash led
the ruling party to win the general elections in May with the
smallest margin of popular votes since independence in 1965.  “Singapore may be reaching the limits of the growth
model,” said Singapore-based Chua. “Singapore’s GDP will
probably still be higher than  Hong Kong ’s in coming years but
the rates of growth will probably converge.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
