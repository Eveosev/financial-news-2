China , the largest foreign U.S.
creditor, reduced its   (HOLDCH) holdings of U.S. government securities
last year for the first time since the Treasury Department began
compiling the data in 2001.  The world’s second-largest economy held $1.15 trillion
Treasuries as of Dec. 31, down from $1.16 trillion at the end of
2010, according to  Treasury data  released yesterday. The U.S.
revised the figures to show that China held about $51 billion
more than  reported  earlier last month. The revision shows
nation’s holdings peaked at $1.3149 trillion in July.  China’s policy makers have advocated diversification of the
nation’s foreign-exchange reserves away from U.S. assets after
more than doubling its holdings of Treasuries since 2007 in the
wake of the global financial crisis.  Yields (USGG10YR)  on benchmark 10-year
Treasury notes dropped to a record low of 1.67 percent in
September as investors sought a haven from  Europe ’s sovereign-
debt crisis and the  Federal Reserve  pledged to keep borrowing
costs close to zero to sustain economic growth.  “What we may be seeing from China is similar behavior to
many domestic investors,” said  William O’Donnell , head U.S.
government bond strategist at Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc
in  Stamford , Connecticut, one of 21 primary dealers that trade
with the Fed. “With 10-year notes sub 2 percent they don’t have
a lot of interest or appetite for Treasuries.”  The 10-year note yield rose one basis points, or 0.01
percentage point, to 1.98 percent at 11:04 a.m. in  Tokyo ,
according to Bloomberg Bond Trader prices. The 2 percent
security due February 2022 fell 1/8, or $1.25 per $1,000 face
amount, to 100 1/8.  European Purchases  Japan  maintained its place as America’s second-largest
lender, with $1.06 trillion of Treasuries in December, while
 Brazil  held $226.9 billion, the Treasury Department said.  Hong
Kong  held $121.7 billion at the end of last year, according to
the data. Total foreign holdings amounted to $5 trillion, up
from $4.44 trillion in December 2010.  As China’s demand for Treasuries has waned, buyers in
Europe have taken up the slack as the region’s debt crisis
worsened. Luxembourg increased its holdings by 74 percent to
$150.6 billion last year, Switzerland boosted its stake 33
percent to $142.5 billion and Belgium’s position in the debt
more-than-quadrupled to $135.2 billion.  The Treasury data is inconsistent month-to-month as a new
methodology has been phased in from a mainly transaction-based
survey to a custodian survey.  As of January 2012, the new data on foreign holdings of
 Treasury securities  is being collected monthly instead of
quarterly.  Largest Owner  The Fed remains the top holder of  U.S. debt  with $1.66
trillion on its balance sheet. The central bank said in
September it would sell $400 billion of short-term debt in its
holdings and buy an equal amount of longer-maturity Treasuries.
Traders call the program Operation Twist after a similar effort
in 1961 to contain borrowing costs for companies and consumers.  “It makes sense that China would sell into the Fed’s
twist, but while they are cutting their holdings they are still
far and away one of the largest holders of U.S. debt, and that
isn’t changing anytime soon,” said Thomas Simons, a government
debt economist in  New York  at Jefferies Group Inc., another
primary. “While there has been speculation that there would be
potential alternative for Treasuries as a reserve asset, we’ve
seen over the last year that that just isn’t true, and the U.S.
is where it’s at.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
