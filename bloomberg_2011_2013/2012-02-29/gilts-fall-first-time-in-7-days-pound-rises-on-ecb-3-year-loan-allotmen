The pound rose the most in four
months against the euro after the  European Central Bank  loaned a
record amount of cash to euro-area banks, fueling speculation
financial-sector earnings will boost the U.K. economy.  Ten-year gilts fell for the first time in seven days.
Sterling gained for a second day versus the dollar after reports
showed U.K. consumer confidence held at the highest level since
June and mortgage approvals increased, adding to speculation
Britain will avoid a recession.  “The pound is the FX world’s way of expressing any bullish
financial institutional factors at play,” said  Neil Jones , head
of European hedge-fund sales at Mizuho Corporate Bank Ltd. in
London. “If financial institutions gain more access to
liquidity it should lead to a higher pound.”  Sterling climbed as much as 1.1 percent, the steepest
intraday gain since Oct. 31, before trading 1 percent higher at
83.76 pence per euro at 4:46 p.m. in  London . The pound gained
0.3 percent to $1.5947 after rising to $1.5993, the highest
since Nov. 14.  Gilts fell after the ECB said it will lend banks 529.5
billion euros ($712 billion) for three years, exceeding the 489
billion euros handed out to 523 institutions in the first three-
year operation in December. Economists surveyed by Bloomberg
predicted an allotment of 470 billion euros in today’s tender.  Improving Sentiment  The take up of ECB loans was “pretty much in line with our
expectations so I think the mild risk-on sentiment that we were
seeing will sustain,” said Vatsala Datta, an interest-rate
strategist at Lloyds Bank Corporate Markets in London. “Gilts
should remain under slight pressure as a consequence.”  The 10-year gilt yield was five basis points higher at 2.15
percent. The 4 percent security due March 2022 fell 0.460, or
4.60 pounds per 1,000-pound face amount, to 116.615. Two-year
yields were little changed at 0.41 percent.  An index of U.K. consumer sentiment remained at minus 29
from January, the strongest reading since June, London-based GfK
NOP Ltd. said in an e-mailed report today. A measure of Britons’
outlook for the economy rose 4 points to minus 29.  Mortgage approvals climbed to a two-year high in January,
the  Bank of England  said. Lenders granted 58,728 loans to buy
homes, compared with 55,019 the previous month. It was the
fourth successive monthly increase.  Extend Gains  The pound is poised to extend gains versus the dollar after
breaking through its 200-day moving average at $1.5902, said
 Axel Rudolph , a senior technical analyst at Commerzbank AG in
London. Sterling may advance to $1.60 by the end of this week
and reach as high as $1.6129, London-based Rudolph said.  Sterling has risen 0.9 percent in the past week according
to Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes, which track 10
developed-nation currencies, trimming its declined for the past
year to 3.2 percent.  U.K. government bonds also fell after Bank of England
Deputy Governor  Paul Tucker  said policy makers must be ready to
withdraw stimulus when the U.K. economy strengthens.  Gilts have handed investors a 0.7 percent loss this year,
according to indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the European
Federation of Financial Analysts Societies.  -- Editors: Mark McCord, Nicholas Reynolds  To contact the reporter on this story:
