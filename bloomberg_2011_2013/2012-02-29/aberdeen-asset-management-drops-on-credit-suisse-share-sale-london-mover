Aberdeen Asset Management Plc (ADN)  fell
the most in a year after  Credit Suisse Group AG (CSGN)  sold shares in
the Scottish firm at a 5.3 percent discount to yesterday’s
closing price.  Credit Suisse offered as many as 57 million shares at
240 pence apiece, according to terms of the offering obtained by
Bloomberg, in a sale managed by the Swiss bank and  Barclays Plc. (BARC)   Aberdeen declined as much as 7.3 percent in London trading,
the biggest drop on the  FTSE 250 Index (MCX)  and the stock’s sharpest
intraday decline since Feb. 10, 2011. The shares were down
5.6 percent at 239.20 pence at 9:18 a.m.  Today’s sale comes after Credit Suisse sold a 5 percent
stake in Aberdeen Asset Management on Feb. 24, reducing its
holding to less than 15 percent. The earlier disposal, which the
Swiss bank said was for regulatory reasons, left Mitsubishi UFJ
Financial Group as Aberdeen’s largest investor. It owns almost
18 percent of the company, according to Bloomberg data.  Aberdeen issued 207.5 million new shares to Credit Suisse
after completing the purchase of some Credit Suisse funds in
2009. The Zurich-based bank originally held a stake equivalent
to 23.9 percent of Aberdeen following the transaction. Credit
Suisse owned 19.8 percent as of December last year, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  Aberdeen, which manages investments for institutions and
individuals, had $270.3 billion under management and advice as
of Dec. 31, according to its website. The firm was founded in
1983 by a group including current Chief Executive Officer Martin Gilbert.  To contact the reporters on this story:
