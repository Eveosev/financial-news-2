Burundi is targeting economic growth
of 8.2 percent in 2015 by attracting investment in the East
African nation’s mining, agriculture and tourism industries,
Second Vice President Gervais Rufyikiri said.  Rufyikiri spoke in Bujumbura, the capital, at a meeting
yesterday with a Belgian business delegation currently visiting
the country. Burundi relies on  Belgium  for 14 percent of its
imports and 5 percent of its exports, President Pierre Nkurunziza said at the meeting.  Burundi’s economic growth is expected to 6 percent in 2014,
compared with an estimated 4.2 percent last year, former Finance
Minister Clotilde Nizigama said earlier this month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
