Algeta ASA (ALGETA)  was the biggest gainer in
Oslo’s benchmark OBX index after Edison Investment Research Ltd.
predicted the Norwegian developer of a prostate-cancer drug
would become a “fully fledged commercial presence.”  Algeta rose as much as 3.8 percent and was up 2.7 percent
to 150.5 kroner as of 1:53 p.m. in Oslo, the  largest gain  in the
OBX index.  “Alpharadin looks set to become a standard of care in
metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer,” Jacob Plieth
and Robin Davison, analysts with London-based Edison Investment,
said in the report.  Algeta is developing Alpharadin with Leverkusen, Germany-
based Bayer AG. The drug emits radioactive alpha particles that
kill cancer cells in patients’ bones. It plans to present the
treatment for regulatory approval in mid-2012, the Oslo-based
company said this month. Algeta said last year that it has an
option in its agreement with Bayer to participate in the
promotion of the treatment as well as earnings in the U.S.  The events will see Algeta become “a business with a fully
fledged commercial presence,” the analysts said. They value the
company at 10.8 billion kroner ($1.95 billion) on a risk-
adjusted net present value basis. Algeta has a market
capitalization of 6.1 billion kroner.  Algeta sold 260 million kroner in shares earlier this month
to fund commercial operations in the U.S. for the introduction
of Alpharadin and to pay for research and fund working capital,
spending and general costs, the company said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
