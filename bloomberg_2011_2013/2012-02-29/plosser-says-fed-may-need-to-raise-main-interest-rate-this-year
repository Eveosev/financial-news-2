President  Charles Plosser  said he believes the  U.S. economy  will
improve and may prompt policy makers to raise the benchmark
 interest rate  this year.  “The economy is doing a lot better,” Plosser said today
in an interview on CNBC. “We’ve actually seen a pretty
substantial firming of growth. We’re entering growth here in the
first part of the year on a much firmer stance than last year.”  The Fed may need to raise interest rates “sooner than
people expect,” Plosser said. Economic growth increased to 3
percent in the fourth quarter and the  unemployment  rate fell
last month to an almost three-year low of 8.3 percent.  “We could raise rates somewhat and still be at a very easy
policy stance,” Plosser said. “One percent is still pretty
accommodative.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
