U.S.  banks  increased financing for
commercial real estate in the fourth quarter for the first time
in almost two years as default rates dropped and lenders shed
more foreclosed properties,  Chandan Economics  said.  Balances on loans for properties including office buildings
and shopping malls rose by $3.69 billion from the prior three
months to $1.06 trillion, after falling for six consecutive
quarters, the New York-based real estate researcher said in a
report today. The last time such lending rose was the first
three months of 2010, when balances increased by $101.9 million
from the previous quarter, according to the report.  Lending has been constrained by upheaval in the market for
commercial mortgage-backed securities, the financing engine that
drove property deals and prices to record highs in 2007. With
loans from the boom years coming due, property owners need to
refinance and CMBS volume remains a fraction of what it was at
the peak, according to  Sam Chandan , chief economist at the firm.  “We still face significant headwinds in commercial
property but the latest findings are encouraging,” Chandan said
in an e-mail.  In the three months through December, the default rate on
commercial real estate loans fell to 3.8 percent of total loan
balances from 4.3 percent a year earlier and 3.9 percent in the
third quarter. It was the lowest since 3.4 percent in the third
quarter of 2009. A loan in default is 90 or more days past due
or in “non-accrual status,” meaning the lender doesn’t expect
to make a full recovery, according to Chandan Economics.  Apartment Buildings  The default rate on  apartment-property  loans fell to 2.5
percent from 3.8 percent a year earlier and 2.9 percent the
prior quarter, the lowest since the first three months of 2009,
when it was 2.4 percent, the researcher said. The report covers
rental buildings with five or more dwelling units.  Banks reduced their holdings of repossessed commercial
properties to $10.5 billion from $10.9 billion in the third
quarter, according to the report. So-called real estate-owned
properties were up from $10.2 billion a year earlier. Holdings
of foreclosed apartment buildings fell to $1.45 billion from
$2.55 billion in the third quarter and $2.59 billion a year
earlier, Chandan Economics said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
