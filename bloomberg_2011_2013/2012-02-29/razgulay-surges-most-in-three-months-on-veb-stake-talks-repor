OAO  Razgulay Group (GRAZ) , a Russian grain
producer, jumped the most in more than three months after
Kommersant reported that VEB, the state development bank, is in
talks to acquire a 16.8 percent stake.  Razgulay climbed 11 percent to 28.80 rubles as of 10:20
a.m. in Moscow, its strongest intraday advance since Nov. 14.  VEB may gain the stake as part of the grain companyâ€™s debt
restructuring, according to the Russian newspaper, which cited
an investment banker it did not identify. Razgulay got
regulatory approval to issue 31.9 million shares in December,
Kommersant reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
