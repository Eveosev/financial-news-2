CEZ AS (CEZ) , the Czech Republic’s largest
power utility that controls  Bulgaria ’s biggest electricity
distributors, needs to invest 151 million lev ($104 million) to
support and expand the Balkan country’s grid.  CEZ will seek approval to raise power prices in Bulgaria
6.44 percent to finance the investment needed for the year
starting from July 2012 to replace 440 kilometers (274 miles) of
power cables with expired service life, install new transformers
and extend the grid to new clients, the Prague-based company
said in an e-mailed statement today.  Bulgaria’s energy regulator capped CEZ’s 2011-2012
investment program at 111 million lev, after 71 million lev in
each of the previous three years it said. CEZ controls the power
companies serving the capital Sofia and the northern city of
Pleven, which together account for 41 percent of the country’s
electricity consumers or more than 2 million clients.  “Delaying renovation of the grid will exacerbate its
problems and will further postpone in time achieving European
standards of power-supply quality and security,” CEZ Bulgaria
AD Regional Manager Peter Dokladl said in the statement.  The investment volume of 53 lev per client approved by the
energy regulator for CEZ is less than that of its competitors,
even though it services the biggest part of the country
including the capital and major mountain resorts, the company
said.  The Austrian utility  EVN AG (EVN) , which services 1.5 million
customers in southern Bulgaria gets a 75 lev per client cap and
 Germany ’s  E.ON AG (EOAN)  which sells electricity to 1.2 million clients
in northeastern Bulgaria has the limit of 65 lev per client,
according to the statement.  Damages to the  power grid  caused by severe snowstorms in
the first two months of the year exceeded 2 million lev, CEZ
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
