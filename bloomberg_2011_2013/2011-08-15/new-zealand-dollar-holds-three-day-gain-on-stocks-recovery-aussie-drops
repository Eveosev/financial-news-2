The Australian dollar fell against
most of its 16 major counterparts after minutes of the central
bank’s Aug. 2 meeting showed policy makers were concerned that
turmoil in financial markets may slow global economic growth.  The Aussie weakened against the dollar for the first time
in four days as traders bet the  Reserve Bank  of Australia will
reduce  interest rates . New Zealand’s dollar extended a four-day
winning streak against the greenback.  “I see the Aussie going back to parity again” versus the
U.S. dollar, said Lee Wai Tuck, a currency strategist at
Forecast Pte in Singapore. “If turmoil continues, it could
actually temper inflation over time,” easing pressure on the
RBA to raise interest rates.  The Australian dollar slid 0.4 percent to $1.049 at 11:58
a.m. in New York from $1.0507 yesterday. The Aussie fell 0.3
percent to 80.52 Japanese yen.  New Zealand’s dollar gained 0.4 percent 83.66 U.S. cents
from 83.28. It advanced 0.4 percent to 64.21 yen.  Traders see a 100 percent chance  Australia ’s central bank
will cut its overnight cash-rate target by 50 basis points by
October, contracts on the Sydney Futures Exchange show.  RBA Governor  Glenn Stevens  held the key rate at 4.75
percent for a record eighth-straight meeting on Aug. 2.  To contact the reporter on this story:
