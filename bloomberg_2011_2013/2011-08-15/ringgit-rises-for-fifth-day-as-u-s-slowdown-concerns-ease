Malaysia ’s ringgit strengthened for
a fifth day, the longest winning streak in six weeks, after U.S.
retail sales rose the most in four months and  Japan ’s economy
shrank less than economists forecast.  Currencies appreciated across  Southeast Asia ’s five biggest
economies and the MSCI Asia Pacific Index of stocks snapped a
two-day decline as investors favored riskier assets, helping
emerging markets attract funds. U.S. retail sales climbed 0.5
percent in July, the U.S. Commerce Department said on Aug. 12.
Japan said today its gross domestic product shrank at an
annualized 1.3 percent rate in the three months ended June 30,
less than the 2.5 percent pace predicted in a Bloomberg survey.  “This is a trading market,” said Yeo Chin Tiong, head of
financial markets at Alliance Bank Bhd. in  Kuala Lumpur . “The
ringgit’s strength today is helped by the better-than-expected
retail sales data in the U.S.”  The ringgit climbed 0.7 percent to 2.9805 per dollar as of
4:39 p.m. in Kuala Lumpur, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. It’s gained 1.7 percent in the past week, trimming
this month’s loss to 0.5 percent.  A government report on Aug. 17 will show Malaysia’s
inflation held at a two-year high of 3.5 percent in July,
according to the median estimate of economists in a Bloomberg
Survey.  Malaysia’s bonds fell. The yield on the 4.262 percent note
due September 2016 rose three basis points, or 0.03 percentage
point, to 3.42 percent, according to Bursa Malaysia.  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
