CEZ AS (CEZ) , the  Czech Republic ’s largest
power producer, said profit fell more than 40 percent in the
second quarter as lower electricity prices, taxes on carbon
credits and electricity produced by solar plants hurt earnings.  Net income dropped to 6.7 billion koruna ($397.4 million)
from 11.2 billion koruna a year ago, the Prague-based company
said today on its website, below the median estimate of 7.6
billion koruna of 14 analysts in a Bloomberg survey. Revenue
rose 4.5 percent to 46.8 billion koruna, operating costs jumped
16 percent gain to 35.6 billion koruna and Ebit, or earnings
before interest and tax, declined 21 percent to 11.14 billion
koruna.  Lower electricity prices and newly introduced taxes on
carbon credits and on solar-plant produced energy has affected
earnings this year, CEZ said in a separate statement today.  While market power prices rose after  Germany ’s shutdown of
old nuclear power stations and the decision to phase out nuclear
power in the next decade, CEZ had already pre-sold most of its
electricity, causing net income to fall. The value of CEZ’s
share options in Mol also declined when Mol shares fell as much
as 13 percent during the three-month period, analysts said
before the results were published.  CEZ raised the full-year forecast for 2011 net profit by
500 million koruna to 40.6 billion koruna, the company said in a
separate statement today.  CEZ closed at 753 koruna, up 0.1 percent, in Prague,
erasing earlier gains of as much as 3.2 percent  Power Sources  CEZ, which generates power from sources such as two nuclear
 power plants  in the country along with wind farms and
distribution grids outside of the Czech Republic, reported net
income of 24 billion koruna for the first six months of the
year, also missing the median forecast of 25.4 billion koruna.  CEZ was originally scheduled to report results tomorrow
before the market’s open.  To contact the reporters on this story:
