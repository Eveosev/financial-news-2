The following is the text
of  Canada â€™s new motor vehicles sales report for June
released by  Statistics Canada .  The number of new motor vehicles sold rose 10.8% in June to
141,882 units, more than offsetting losses reported in the
previous two months. Sales of passenger cars and trucks
contributed equally to the increase.  Preliminary industry data indicate that the number of new motor
vehicles sold in July decreased 6%.  Sales increase for passenger cars and trucks
Passenger car sales in June were up 12.9% to 60,492 units. Sales
of North American-built passenger cars bounced back from the
previous month, up 20.7%. Overseas-built passenger car sales
increased 1.0%, the third advance reported this year.  Sales of trucks (which include minivans, sport-utility vehicles,
light and heavy trucks, vans and buses) grew 9.3% to 81,390
units in June. This was the largest increase since February
2010.  Sales up in all provinces
New motor vehicle sales were up in all provinces in June.  The largest increase was in Ontario, where sales rose 13.2%.
Other large gains were reported in Quebec (+8.7%), Alberta
(+10.9%) and British Columbia and the territories (+11.5%).  Newfoundland and Labrador registered the smallest increase in
sales at 5.8%, the first gain after four consecutive monthly
declines.  Note to readers
Seasonally adjusted data of new motor vehicle sales have been
revised from 2007 to reflect an update in seasonal adjustment
factors. Because of the constant evolution of seasonal factors,
revisions can be more significant for some months of the year.
However, the annual sum of seasonally adjusted figures
corresponds to the annual sum of unadjusted estimates.  The unadjusted data of new motor vehicle sales have been revised
back to January 2010.  To contact the reporter on this story:
