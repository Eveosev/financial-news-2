Kevin Cassidy, the former chief
executive officer of  Optionable Inc. (OPBL) , will plead guilty to his
role in a scheme to hide millions of dollars of losses at the
 Bank of Montreal (BMO) , a clerk in Manhattan federal court said today.  The case stems from C$680 million ($690.5 million) of
pretax commodity-trading losses the bank announced in April
2007. Those losses grew to C$853 million for the fiscal year,
paring profit by C$440 million. Cassidy was charged with fraud
in 2008 for helping a former trader at the bank conceal the
losses.  Cassidy, an ex-convict who hid his criminal record, helped
former trader David Lee hide commodity losses from the bank to
win business for Optionable, according to prosecutors.
Optionable was a brokerage firm focusing on energy derivatives  Cassidy was sentenced to 30 months in prison for credit-card
fraud in 1997 and six months for income-tax evasion in 1993,
court records show.  The case is U.S. v. Cassidy, 08-CR-1101, U.S. District
Court, Southern District of  New York  (Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
