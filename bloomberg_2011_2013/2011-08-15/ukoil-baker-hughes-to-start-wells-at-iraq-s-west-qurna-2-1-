OAO Lukoil, the Russian  oil company 
with the most assets overseas, signed a deal with  Baker Hughes
Inc. (BHI)  to begin drilling in the Mishrif formation in  Iraq ’s West
Qurna-2 field.  Baker Hughes, the Houston-based oil-services provider,
agreed to start drilling in the fourth quarter and plans to
complete 23 wells in two years, Lukoil said today in a
statement.  Lukoil and Norwegian partner  Statoil ASA (STL)  won rights to
develop the second phase of the West Qurna field in December
2009 as Iraq’s government sought to increase the nation’s oil
output. The companies agreed to produce 1.8 million barrels a
day from the field for a fee of $1.15 a barrel.  The Russian oil producer plans to begin output from the
field in 2013, Chief Executive Officer Vagit Alekperov said in
June.  To contact the reporter on this story:
