     Aug. 15 (Bloomberg) - Arsenal and Newcastle were charged
with failing to control their players during the 0-0 draw at St.
James’ Park two days ago, English soccer’s Football Association
said.   Players from both teams were involved in a melee after a
clash between Newcastle’s  Joey Barton  and Arsenal’s Gervinho,
who was red-carded.  The Gunners’  Alex Song  was charged separately with violent
conduct following an incident earlier in the game when he
appeared to stamp on Barton.  Arsenal has appealed over Gervinho’s red card, saying a
standard three-game ban would be excessive. Barton got a yellow
card.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
