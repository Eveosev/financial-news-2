New Zealand  travel services were
disrupted a second day as rare Antarctic conditions shut tourist
routes and brought the heaviest snow in at least half a century
to the centers of government and commerce.  Further snowfalls were forecast for today by the nation’s
MetService in areas throughout the country. Christchurch
Airport, the  South Island ’s biggest, reopened for flights while
expecting disruptions, according to its  website . Queenstown
Airport, which serves tourists on skiing and sight-seeing
holidays in the same island, also reopened after shutting for
most of the morning. Many highways throughout the country remain
closed.  “A strong and extremely cold southerly flow, with polar
origins, continues to affect much of the country,” the
MetService said on its website.  Afternoon temperatures sank to 0 degrees Celsius (32
degrees Fahrenheit) in parts of New Zealand as a large mass of
Antarctic air covered the country. Wellington, the capital city
located in the lower  North Island , yesterday saw its heaviest
snowfall in 50 years. Auckland, the biggest city, saw its first
snow in more than seven decades.  Some flights between Auckland and other towns and cities
including Christchurch were delayed or canceled, according to
Auckland Airport’s website. While some flights from Wellington
to the South Island were also disrupted, its airport remained
open. Wellington police said that only essential travel should
be made across the region this evening.  Snow was expected to fall in parts of the North Island
until Saturday and clear in the South from Thursday, according
to the MetService.  To contact the reporters on this story:
