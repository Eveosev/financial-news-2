Pramerica Real Estate Investors has
raised 98.3 million pounds ($160 million) for a fund that buys
ground rents in the U.K., as investors move out of traditional
assets such as index-linked  government bonds  into alternative
investments that offer potential for higher returns with
comparably low levels of risk, the Financial Times reported.  The extra capital has taken the fund to 225 million pounds,
the newspaper said.  Pramerica is targeting leases of at least 75 years; yields
on such investments are typically 4 percent to 4.5 percent, the
FT said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
