Sugar fell the most in a week on
signs of increased exports from  India , the world’s biggest
producer after  Brazil . Coffee and cocoa gained.  India’s sugar supplies may outpace demand by 4 million
metric tons in the 2011-2012 season, and “large quantities”
may be exported, according to Abinash Verma, director-general of
the Indian Sugar Mills Association. On Aug. 12, the country said
it would allow mills and traders to ship 24 percent more than
previously permitted.  “The additional exports for the fourth quarter and the
talk of a larger surplus in the new season could be playing a
major role in the market being lower,” Keith Flury, a London-
based analyst at Rabobank International, said in a telephone
interview.  Raw sugar for October delivery dropped 0.36 cent, or 1.3
percent, to settle at 27.48 cents a pound at 2 p.m. on ICE
Futures U.S. in  New York . That’s the biggest decline since Aug.
8.  Arabica-coffee futures for December delivery advanced 5.55
cents, or 2.3 percent, to settle at $2.494 a pound on ICE.
Earlier, the price jumped as much as 3.2 percent to $2.5175, the
highest since July 19.  Prices gained as the dollar dropped by as much as 1.1
percent against a basket of six major currencies, increasing
investor demand for commodities as alternative assets,  Hector Galvan , a senior trading adviser at RJO Futures, said in a
telephone interview from  Chicago .  Cocoa futures for December delivery advanced $24, or 0.8
percent, to settle at $2,931 a ton on ICE.  On NYSE Liffe in  London , sugar retreated, while coffee and
cocoa advanced.  To contact the reporters on this story:
