The  Port of Hamburg , Europe’s third-
busiest harbor for seaborne containers, said first-half cargo
handling rose 9.4 percent as trade with  Asia  and the countries
around the  Baltic Sea  increased.  Cargo volume totaled 64.1 million tons compared with 58.6
million tons a year earlier, the state-owned port authority said
in a statement distributed at a press conference in the German
city today. The number of standard containers handled increased
17 percent to 4.3 million.  Hamburg won market share from other northern European ports
in the period as container volume growth outpaced a 4.3 percent
expansion in Antwerp, Europe’s second-largest container port,
while traffic fell 6.8 percent at Zeebrugge, Belgium, according
to the statement. Rotterdam,  Europe ’s largest port,  posted  a 10
percent increase in container volumes in the first quarter, its
most recent reporting period.  Hamburger Hafen & Logistik AG, which handles two-thirds of
containers at the German port, raised forecasts on Aug. 12,
saying it now expects sales and earnings to increase 15 percent
this year and total container throughput to expand by as much as
20 percent, after first-half profit jumped 22 percent. The
previous forecast was for growth “well above” 10 percent in
sales and earnings.  To contact the reporter on this story:
