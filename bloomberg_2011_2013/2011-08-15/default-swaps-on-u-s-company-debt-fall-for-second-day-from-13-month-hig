A benchmark measure of U.S.
corporate credit risk fell for a second day after reaching its
highest level in more than a year last week.  The Markit CDX North America Investment Grade Index, which
investors use to hedge against losses on corporate debt or to
speculate on creditworthiness, declined 2.8 basis points to a
mid-price of 112.6 basis points as of 7:56 a.m. in  New York .  The gauge, which typically falls when investor confidence
improves and rises as it deteriorates, climbed 12.3 basis points
last week on concern that  Europe â€™s debt crisis was deepening and
the U.S. economic recovery was faltering. The index reached
116.6 on Aug. 11, its highest level since July 2010.  Credit swaps pay the buyer face value if a borrower fails
to meets its obligations, less the value of the defaulted debt.
A basis point equals $1,000 annually on a contract protecting
$10 million of debt.  To contact the reporter on this story:
