Tanzania’s shilling headed for the
weakest close in 17 years against the dollar as  oil companies 
sought to buy the U.S. currency to pay for imports.  The currency of East Africa’s second-biggest economy
currency depreciated as much as 0.8 percent to 1630.5 per
dollar. A close at this level would be the weakest since 1994.
It traded 0.3 percent down at 1,622.73 at 2:21 p.m. in Dar es
Salaam, the commercial capital.  “There is a lot of demand that has come in from the oil
sector since morning,” Eric Chijoriga, a trader with Absa Group
Ltd.’s Tanzanian unit, said by phone.  Tanzania, which has experienced fuel shortages at gas
stations this month, raised the cost of gasoline by 5.5 percent
after international  oil prices  climbed and the shilling weakened
against the dollar, the Energy and Water Utilities Regulatory
Authority said in a statement today. Tanzania’s inflation rate
climbed to 13 percent in June, the fastest pace in 15 months, on
higher energy and food costs, the National Bureau of Statistics
said today.  Motorists in  Dar es Salaam  have faced queues at stations
since Aug. 5 amid a gasoline shortage that the regulator said
was caused by fuel retailers disrupting supplies after a price
cut on Aug. 3. Last week, the regulator suspended British
Petroleum Tanzania Ltd.’s wholesale license for three months and
issued warning letters to three other suppliers for causing the
disruption.  To contact the reporter on this story:
