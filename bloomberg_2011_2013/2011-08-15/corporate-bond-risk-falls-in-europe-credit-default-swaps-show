The cost of protecting European
sovereign and corporate bonds from default fell after global
markets stabilized as  Japan  said its economy contracted less
than economists forecast.  The Markit iTraxx Crossover Index of credit-default swaps
on 40 companies with mostly high-yield credit ratings dropped
35.5 basis points to 593.5, according to JPMorgan Chase & Co. at
3:30 p.m. in London. The Markit iTraxx SovX Western Europe Index
of swaps linked to the debt of 15 governments dropped 7 basis
points to 276, the lowest since July 29.  Japan’s gross domestic product shrank at an annualized 1.3
percent rate in the three months ended June 30, compared with a
median forecast of a 2.5 percent drop from 25 economists
surveyed by Bloomberg News. French President Nicholas Sarkozy
and German  Chancellor Angela Merkel  will meet tomorrow in Paris
to discuss measures to curb  Europe ’s debt crisis.  “The market is back onto risk-on mode, but it’s more a
reaction to the degree of negativity that hit markets last week
rather than any reversal in trend,” said Simon Ballard, senior
credit strategist at  RBC Capital Markets  in London. “Risk is
improving and spreads are back in, but we haven’t seen any
fundamental change.”  Global markets are stabilizing after a week of record
swings in U.S. stocks that was sparked by S&P’s downgrade of its
 credit rating  for the world’s largest economy. The MSCI Asia
Pacific Index gained 1.8 percent, snapping a two-day loss, and
the Stoxx Europe 600 Index gained 0.3 percent. The Standard &
Poor’s 500 Index advanced 1.4 percent.  Spain , Italy  Credit-default swaps on Spain dropped 4 basis points to
349, according to CMA. The cost of insuring Italian  government
bonds  declined 10 basis points to 344. France was down 2 at 150
and Ireland was 6 lower at 741. Greece rose 9 to 1,758 and
Portugal increased 6 to 841.  The Markit iTraxx Europe Index of 125 companies with
investment-grade ratings fell 10.5 basis points to 140 basis
points. The Markit iTraxx Financial Index dropped 16 to 213.  The  European Central Bank  spent a record 22 billion euros
($31.7 billion) on government bonds last week as it began buying
Italian and Spanish securities to contain the debt crisis.  A basis point on a credit-default swap protecting 10
million euros ($14.3 million) of debt from default for five
years is equivalent to 1,000 euros a year. Swaps pay the buyer
face value in exchange for the underlying securities or the cash
equivalent should a borrower fail to adhere to its debt
agreements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
