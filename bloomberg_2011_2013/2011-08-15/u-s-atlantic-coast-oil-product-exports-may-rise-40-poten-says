Oil product exports from U.S.
Atlantic Coast refineries may advance as much as 40 percent this
year, said Poten & Partners Inc., a New York-based shipbroker
and consulting firm.  Buyers in northern  Europe  will account for about 9 million
barrels in 2011, making them the largest purchasers, while
shipments to the Caribbean and Mediterranean will also advance,
Poten said in a  report  on its website and sent by e-mail Aug.
12.  “While this increased activity is over a relatively small
base, the point of note is the willingness of the international
markets to snap up incremental supplies made available from a
region that has long been a net importer,” Poten said.  The Baltic Clean Tanker Index, an overall measure of the
cost of hauling gasoline,  jet fuel  and other refined cargoes,
gained 7 percent this year to 678 points, according to the
Baltic Exchange in  London . By contrast, the bourse’s equivalent
gauge for crude oil transportation has declined 17 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
