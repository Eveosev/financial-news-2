Home sales in  Southern California 
fell 4.5 percent last month from a year earlier as mortgages
were hard to obtain and the U.S. debt crisis rattled some high-
end buyers, according to  DataQuick .  A total of 18,090 houses and condominiums sold in July in
 Los Angeles , Riverside, San Diego, Ventura, San Bernardino and
Orange counties, a 12 percent decline from June, the property
research firm said today in a statement. The median price paid
was $283,000, down 4.1 percent from July 2010 and the fifth
consecutive decline on a year-over-year basis.  “Reports on the economy became increasingly downbeat and,
no doubt, some people fretted over the possibility the country
would default on its obligations,”  John Walsh , president of San
Diego-based DataQuick, said in the statement. “If there’s a
shred of good news in the data it’s that last month’s sales
weren’t much worse than a year earlier.”  Foreclosures and short sales, where the property sells for
less than the amount owed, accounted for more than half of all
Southern California deals last month. Transactions involving
homes at $800,000 or more declined more than any other price
category.  Properties in Los Angeles fell to a median $320,000, down
5.6 percent from a year earlier and the steepest decline among
the six Southern California counties DataQuick tracks.  To contact the reporter on this story:
