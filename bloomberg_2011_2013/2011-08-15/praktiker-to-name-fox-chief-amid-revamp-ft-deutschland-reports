Praktiker AG’s supervisory board
will name Thomas Fox as chief executive officer today as the
retailer faces a revamp,  Financial Times Deutschland said ,
citing unidentified people close to the company’s board and the
consulting industry.  Fox, who headed department-store chain Karstadt for two
years after its insolvency, has the mandate to stop the cash
outflow and reduce the retailer’s losses, the German newspaper
said. The closure of some stores hasn’t been ruled out, FTD
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
