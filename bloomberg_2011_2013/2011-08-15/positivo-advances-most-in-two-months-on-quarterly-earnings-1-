Positivo Informatica SA (POSI3) ,  Brazil ’s
biggest computer maker, rallied in Sao Paulo after Banco
Santander SA said second-quarter results showed the company is
keeping costs under control even as profit declines.  Positivo gained 6.8 percent to 5.51 reais at 4:15 p.m. New
York time, the steepest increase since June 6. The stock is down
43 percent this year, compared to a 21 percent drop for the
benchmark Bovespa index.  Profit excluding some items fell 69 percent from a year
earlier to 9.5 million reais ($6 million), the company said in a
regulatory filing Aug. 12 after the market closed. While
adjusted net revenue slid 6.8 percent to 551 million reais,
operating costs declined at a faster pace, dropping 7.6 percent
to 127.7 million reais, according to the statement. The company
posted 6.8 million reais in net income without adjustments, an
item for which it didn’t provide a year-earlier number.  “We applaud Positivo’s improved discipline on cost
control,” analysts at Banco Santander SA, including Valder Nogueira, wrote in a note to clients today. “We see more
positives than negatives” in the second-quarter results, he
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
