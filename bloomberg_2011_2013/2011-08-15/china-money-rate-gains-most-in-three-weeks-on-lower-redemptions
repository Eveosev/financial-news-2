China ’s money-market rate gained the
most in more than three weeks on speculation cash supplies will
become tighter as redemptions of central-bank bills are set to
decline this week.  A total of 89 billion yuan ($13.9 billion) of central bank
bills and repurchase agreement will mature this week, compared
with an average of 112 billion yuan over the past 10 weeks,
according to Wee-Khoon Chong, a fixed-income strategist at
Societe Generale SA in  Hong Kong . China’s government said last
week the  trade surplus  surged 20.4 percent in July from a year
ago to $31.5 billion, the highest level in more than two years.  “The underlying pressure on fixings is still high, looking
at redemptions,” said Chong. “The seven-day repo has gone down
because of strong inflows into China with the stronger-than-
expected July trade balance. We expect the seven-day repo to see
a floor at 3 percent unless there’s another wave of big
inflows.”  The seven-day repurchase rate, a measure of interbank
funding availability, gained 16 basis points, or 0.16 percentage
point, to 3.24 percent as of 4:29 p.m. in  Shanghai , according to
the National Interbank Funding Center.  The one-year swap contract, the fixed cost needed to
receive the floating seven-day repurchase rate, increased six
basis points to 3.63 percent, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  The yield on the 3.44 percent government bonds due June
2016 dropped two basis points to 3.81 percent, according to the
Interbank Funding Center.  To contact the reporter on this story:
