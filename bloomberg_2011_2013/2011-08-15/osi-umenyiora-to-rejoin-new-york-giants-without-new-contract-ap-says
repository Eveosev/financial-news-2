Osi Umenyiora, who hasn’t practiced
with the  New York Giants  during a contract dispute,  told the
Associated Press  he’ll rejoin the team today and play this
season under the terms of his current deal.  Umenyiora said in an e-mail to AP that his contract hasn’t
been reworked and the team’s offer to pay him $7.1 million over
the next two seasons isn’t acceptable. He told AP the Giants
offered to put undisclosed incentives in his deal.  The 29-year-old Umenyiora has spent his seven-year career
with the Giants, recording 60 sacks and 219 tackles. He had 11
1/2 sacks and a career-high 10 forced fumbles last year.  Umenyiora reported to camp July 30 after having offseason
hip surgery. The Giants gave his agent permission to seek a
trade, provided they got a first-round draft pick in return, and
then withdrew the offer. Giants coach  Tom Coughlin  said
yesterday on a conference call that Umenyiora has been cleared
by team doctors to resume practicing.  “I don’t know anything just yet,” Coughlin said when
asked if Umenyiora would be at practice today. “We certainly
expect that, yes. But I don’t know that for a fact.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
