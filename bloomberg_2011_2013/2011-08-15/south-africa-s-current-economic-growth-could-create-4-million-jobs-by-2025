South Africa ’s current economic
growth trajectory will probably result in the creation of 4
million jobs by 2025, not enough to make a “significant dent”
in unemployment, Finance Minister  Pravin Gordhan  said.   The debt crisis in  Europe  and the U.S. may “dampen
growth” in some parts of the world, Gordhan said in a speech in
Johannesburg today.    To contact the editor responsible for this story:
