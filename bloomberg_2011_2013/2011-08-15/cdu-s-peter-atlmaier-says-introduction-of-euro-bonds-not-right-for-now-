German Chancellor  Angela Merkel ’s
government doesn’t favor the introduction of joint euro bonds
“for now,” the deputy floor leader of her party said.  “In the last 12 months we’ve always had to decide which
was the right course to take on a case-by-case basis and we’ve
always said in the past that we don’t find euro bonds to be a
good solution, because they take away the pressure to save among
the affected countries,”  Peter Altmaier  said in an interview on
Deutschlandfunk radio today. “We have a joint stability culture
in  Europe  and that means solidarity with those who are in
trouble. Those are the two sides of the coin -- and until now
we’ve been able to maintain this difficult balance.”  At the same time, circumstances are changing all the time,
he said.  “I’m also of the view that it doesn’t make sense to go
around with principles and absolutist positions, rather it’s
about solving concrete problems,” Altmaier said.  “In this whole debate, nobody knew at the beginning how
these events would proceed, so we’ve been careful about making
categorical decisions on a permanent basis but rather talk about
the foreseeable future,” he said. “So for that reason we’re
saying that euro bonds are not the right solution for now.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
