Keegan Bradley’s three-hole playoff
win at the  PGA Championship  drew a 14 percent lower major-market
television rating than the final round a year ago.  The golf season’s final major tournament was seen yesterday
on CBS in an average of 4.3 percent of U.S. homes in the top 56
markets, Gerard Caraccioli, a spokesman for the  CBS Corp. (CBS) 
network, said in an e-mail.  That’s 14 percent lower than the 5.0 major-market rating
the tournament got last year, when Germany’s Martin Kaymer won
in a playoff at Whistling Straights in Kohler, Wisconsin,
beating Bubba Watson.  Bradley, a 25-year-old U.S.  PGA Tour  rookie who entered the
tournament 108th in the  Official World Golf Rankings , forced a
playoff with fellow American Jason Dufner after making a triple-
bogey on the par-3 15th hole at Atlanta Athletic Club. The one-
shot win raised Bradley’s ranking to 29th.  Several of the contending golfers yesterday were lesser-
known names on the PGA Tour. Bradley, who was 108th in the
Official World Golf Ranking heading into the tournament,  became
the first player since Francis Ouimet in 1913 to win his major-
tournament debut in the U.S. Dufner has never won a Tour event,
while third-place finisher Anders Hansen of  Denmark  was ranked
45th.  Tiger Woods, the 14-time major champion and former No. 1-
ranked golfer in the world, failed to make the cut for weekend
play, and four-time major champion  Phil Mickelson  tied for 19th.  To contact the reporter on this story:
