State-owned Nigerian National
Petroleum Corp. plans to accept a $2 billion loan from a group
led by the  Japan  Bank for International Cooperation to fund its
share of a $5 billion liquefied natural-gas project.  NNPC, as the company is known, will cut its stake in the
proposed Brass LNG plant in the oil-rich Niger River delta to
30 percent from 49 percent, according to Levi Ajuonuma, a
spokesman.  The decision over the financing of the Brass LNG plant
followed a meeting with the Japanese companies last month in
Abuja, he said. The others involved in arranging the loan
include LNG Japan,  Itochu Corp. (8001)  and  Sojitz Corp (2768) , Ajuonuma said.  A final investment decision on the plant at Brass in the
southeastern Bayelsa state will be taken in the first quarter,
Ajuonuma said.  Total SA (FP) ,  Eni SpA (ENI)  and  ConocoPhillips (COP)  each have 17
percent stakes in the project.  NNPC has “offered 4 percent and 3 percent to LNG Japan and
ITOCHU respectively,” Ajuonuma said.  A further 2 percent has
been offered to a joint venture between Sahara Group and  Sempra
Energy. (SRE)   Nigeria has proven natural gas reserves of 187 trillion
cubic feet, according to the Petroleum Ministry.  To contact the reporter on this story:
