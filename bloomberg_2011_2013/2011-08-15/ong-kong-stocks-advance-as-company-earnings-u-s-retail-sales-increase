week, supporting investor sentiment,” said  Alex Wong , asset-
management director at Ample Capital Ltd. in Hong Kong. “The
market moved too fast last week. After the weekend, investors
are calming down and rethinking about what is happening. But
sentiment remains cautious and people are reluctant to chase the
rally.”  PICC surged 10 percent to HK$13.40 after saying its first-
half profit almost doubled from a year earlier, while China
