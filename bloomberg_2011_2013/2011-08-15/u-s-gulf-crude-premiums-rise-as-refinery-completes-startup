U.S. Gulf oil premiums strengthened
after  ConocoPhillips (COP)  said it completed the startup of its Ponca
City refinery in  Oklahoma , increasing demand for crude.  The 213,162-barrel-a-day refinery had shut after Aug. 8
power failure. “Refinery start-up operations at Ponca City are
complete,” Janet Grothe, a Houston-based ConocoPhillips
spokeswoman, said in an e-mail today.  Light Louisiana Sweet’s premium widened 60 cents to $21.50
a barrel at 4:02 p.m. in  New York , according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. Heavy Louisiana Sweet added 85 cents to $24.10 a
barrel over WTI.  Among sour, or high-sulfur, grades, the premium for Mars
Blend added 60 cents to $19.60 while Poseidon’s gained 40 cents
to $19.35 a barrel.  Southern Green Canyon’s premium was unchanged at $18 a
barrel over WTI. West Texas Sour’s discount narrowed 1 cent to
87 cents below the benchmark. Thunder Horse’s premium gained $2
to $24.25.  The premium for Syncrude lost 65 cents to $14.25 a barrel.
Syncrude is a light, low-sulfur synthetic oil derived from the
tar sands in  Alberta .  The discount for Western Canada Select widened 40 cents to
$13.75.  To contact the reporter on this story:
