U.S. banks may slow job cuts after
the nation’s Labor Day holiday next month, holding to a seasonal
trend as they weather market turmoil, said Brad Hintz, an
analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein & Co.  U.S. lenders, whose stocks have plunged this month along
with those of European peers, are more resilient than during the
credit crisis after they reduced reliance on short-term funding
and bolstered capital, Hintz said today in an interview on
Bloomberg Television’s “Surveillance Midday” with  Tom Keene .
Consumer loan demand also is “a little bit better,” he said.  “We do not have an end-of-the-world phenomenon like we had
in 2009,” the analyst said. Job cuts “are going on now. After
Labor Day, you tend not to have layoffs,” Hintz said.  The 50 largest global banks announced almost 60,000 job
reductions through the first week of August, the fastest rate
since 2008, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Regulators
are pushing firms to hold more capital, and companies are
restructuring businesses to improve profitability as the U.S.
economy stagnates.  The 24-company KBW Bank Index has declined 18 percent this
month through Aug. 12, brought down by a 22 percent decline in
New York-based  Citigroup Inc. (C)  and a 26 percent slide for
 Charlotte , North Carolina-based  Bank of America Corp. (BAC)  A
recession would hurt bank stocks more than the banking business,
Hintz said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
