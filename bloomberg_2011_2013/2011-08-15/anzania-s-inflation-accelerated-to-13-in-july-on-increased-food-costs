Tanzania’s annual inflation
accelerated to 13 percent in July, the fastest pace in 15
months, as energy and food costs surged, the country’s
statistics agency said.  The inflation rate rose from 10.9 percent in June, the
National Bureau of Statistics said in a statement handed to
reporters today in  Dar es Salaam , the commercial capital.  Energy inflation climbed to 34 percent from a year earlier,
while food prices increased 14.8 percent in July from the same
month last year, the bureau said. Inflation, excluding food and
energy prices, was 7.4 percent, it said.  Gasoline prices in Dar es Salaam rose 5.5 percent today,
while diesel will cost 6.3 percent more after the Tanzanian
shilling weakened against the dollar as international  oil prices 
rose, the Energy and Water Utilities Regulatory Authority said
in a statement in the Daily News newspaper.  To contact the reporter on this story:
