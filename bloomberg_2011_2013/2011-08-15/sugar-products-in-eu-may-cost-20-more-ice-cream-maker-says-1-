R&R Ice Cream Plc,  Europe ’s largest
private-label producer of ice cream, said prices for sugar-based
foods in the European Union may rise by as much as 20 percent by
April due to higher costs of the sweetener.  “It will definitely happen unless something is done,”
said James Lambert, chief executive officer. The EU regulators
should relax sugar import tariffs and increase the import quota
“dramatically” for the 2012-2013 season, he said in a
telephone interview today.  The 27-nation bloc backed a proposal in May to import the
sweetener at a reduced rate and authorized duty-free imports of
200,000 metric tons of sugar to boost supplies in the region.
That came on top of a 300,000 ton import allowance at zero duty
earlier this year, bringing the total of duty-free imports to
500,000 tons. The EU will hold its third of five planned tenders
to import sugar at a reduce duty on Aug. 25.  There is a shortage of sugar in the U.K., where R&R can’t
buy enough sugar, Lambert said. R&R buys as much as 50,000 tons
of sugar a year, including 10,000 tons in the U.K., he said.  “We can’t buy enough in  England ,” Lambert said. “The
U.K. quota has all been sold. There is a shortage of sugar.”  Europe produces about 13.5 million tons of sugar, with
demand estimated at 16.5 million tons, he said.  White sugar for October delivery was down 0.3 percent at
$741.40 a ton by 1:01 p.m. on NYSE Liffe in  London . It rose 35
percent in the past year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
