Vietnam ’s government bonds fell
after a debt auction by a state lender failed last week. The
dong gained the most in almost two weeks.  The Vietnam Bank for Social Policies, a lender that raises
money mainly for the government’s social-welfare projects,
failed to sell notes at an auction on Aug. 12, according to the
Hanoi Stock Exchange’s website. The bank offered 1 trillion dong
($48.3 million) of three-year bonds at 12.5 percent and 500
billion dong of five-year securities at 12.6 percent.  “Banks’ appetite for bonds has reduced now after many of
them bought a lot of the notes in the past months,” said Nguyen Thi Ngoc Anh, the Ho Chi Minh City-based head of fixed-income
trading at Asia Commercial Bank. “We also have enough bond
holdings after many purchases at government debt auctions in
June and July,” Anh said, without revealing the value of
purchases.  The yield on benchmark five-year notes rose three basis
points, or 0.03 percentage point, to 12.58 percent, according to
a daily fixing from banks compiled by Bloomberg.  The dong gained 0.5 percent, the most since Aug. 3, to
20,717 per dollar as of 3:30 p.m. in Hanoi, according to
indicated prices from banks compiled by Bloomberg. The currency
fell 1.1 percent last week, the most since February.  The  State Bank  of Vietnam set its  reference rate  at 20,618
today, unchanged from Aug. 10, according to its website. The
currency is allowed to fluctuate by as much as 1 percent on
either side of that rate.  --Nguyen Dieu Tu Uyen. Editors: Ven Ram, Sandy Hendry  To contact reporter on this story:
