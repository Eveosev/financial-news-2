Oil fell, reversing earlier gains,
before reports this week from the U.S. and  Europe  forecast to
indicate that the global recovery is losing momentum.  Data this week may show U.S. housing starts and building
permits fell in July, while consumer prices rose the least in
three months as unemployment restrained spending, according to
surveys by Bloomberg News. The euro-zone economy probably
expanded 0.3 percent in the second quarter, down from first-
quarter growth of 0.8 percent.  Hedge funds  and other money
managers cut bullish bets on  Brent crude  by 49 percent in the
week ended Aug. 9, according to ICE Futures Europe.  “It’s unlikely we’ll see a pronounced rebound in crude
prices here as fears over a global economic slowdown are still
rife,” said  Andrey Kryuchenkov , an analyst at VTB Capital in
London.  Crude for September delivery fell as much as 98 cents, or
1.2 percent, to $84.40 a barrel in electronic trading on the  New
York Mercantile Exchange  and was at $84.98 at 12:33 p.m. London
time. Earlier it climbed to $85.82. Brent oil for September
settlement was at $107.83, down 20 cents, on the London-based
ICE Futures Europe.  The European benchmark was at a premium of $22.84 to U.S.
futures, compared with a record close of $23.79 on Aug. 10.  Speculative bets that Brent will rise, in futures and
options combined, outnumbered short positions by 95,871
contracts, the London-based exchange said today in its weekly
Commitment of Traders report. Net-long positions fell by 47,019
contracts from 95,871 a week earlier.  Tropical Storm  Tropical Storm Gert is expected to pass near  Bermuda  today.
The storm is about 105 miles (170 kilometers) southeast of the
Caribbean island and is moving north at 14 miles an hour. It has
maximum sustained winds of 60 miles an hour, the Miami-based
center said in an advisory issued at 5 a.m. Bermuda time, and
these extend up to 70 miles, mostly to the north and east.  Hedge funds cut bullish bets on New York crude to the
lowest level in more than eight months in the week ended Aug. 9,
according to a report last week. The funds and other large
speculators reduced their net-long positions, or wagers that
prices will rise, by 11 percent, according to the Commodity
Futures Trading Commission’s weekly Commitments of Traders
report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
