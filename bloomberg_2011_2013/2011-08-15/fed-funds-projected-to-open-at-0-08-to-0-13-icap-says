Fed funds, the U.S. overnight
inter-bank lending rate, is projected to open in a range of 0.08
percent to 0.13 percent, within the  Federal Reserve ’s target of
zero to 0.25 percent.  Fed funds closed at 0.1 percent on Aug. 12 after trading
from 0.06 percent to 0.15 percent and averaging 0.11 percent,
ICAP Plc, the world’s largest inter-dealer broker, said in an
e-mailed statement. ICAP’s monthly average is 0.107 percent.  The Federal Reserve Bank of  New York  will conduct tri-party
reverse repurchase agreements today as policy makers prepare for
the eventual withdrawal of monetary stimulus.  The transactions, part of a series of open-market
operations that began in 2009, don’t represent any change in
monetary policy, according to a statement posted Aug. 12 on the
New York Fed’s website. Today’s reverse repos are with both
 Fannie Mae  and  Freddie Mac , which were added as eligible
counterparties July 27, as well as money funds and the Fed’s 20
securities firms that act as primary dealers.  In a reverse repo, the Fed lends securities for a set
period, draining cash from the banking system. At maturity, the
securities are returned to the Fed, and the cash to the primary
dealers. In a tri-party repo, a clearing bank acts as a third
party to make sure there’s adequate collateral behind the repo
and that it conforms throughout the life of the transaction to
the investor’s requirements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
