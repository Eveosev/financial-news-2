(Corrects analyst’s name in fourth paragraph.)  The Bovespa stock index advanced for
a fifth straight session after a central bank survey showed
analysts covering  Brazil ’s economy lowered their inflation
forecasts, boosting speculation policy makers will cut interest
rates. An increase in commodities prices sent producers higher.  Oil companies Petroleo Brasileiro SA and OGX Petroleo & Gas
Participacoes SA rose, following crude prices higher. Duratex
SA, a Brazilian producer of bathroom fixtures and wood panels
for furniture, headed to its biggest advance in almost two
years, leading gains by companies that depend on domestic
demand.  Brazil’s benchmark equity index increased 2.2 percent to
54,636.62 at 11:42 a.m. New York time. Sixty-one stocks rose on
the gauge, while four declined. The real strengthened 1.1
percent to 1.5934 per  U.S. dollar .  “There are signs that the central bank will stop raising
 interest rates  and might even reduce them sometime soon, which
would be positive for stocks,” Leandro Martins, an analyst at
Sao Paulo-based brokerage Walpires SA, said in a telephone
interview. “Many stocks are very cheap, but it’s early to say
if gains we’re seeing since last week will hold for much longer.
The only thing we know for sure now is that volatility will
remain high for a while.”  Consumer prices will rise 5.23 percent in Brazil next year,
according to the median forecast in an Aug. 12 central bank
survey of about 100 economists published today. The figure was
down from a forecast of 5.27 percent the previous week.
Economists also cut their prediction for 2011 inflation. Prices,
as measured by the IPCA index, will rise 6.26 percent this year,
down from a forecast of 6.28 percent the previous week, the
survey found.  Rate Cut Bets  Yields on interest-rate futures contracts signal traders
are betting the central bank will cut the benchmark rate a
quarter-percentage point from 12.5 percent by year-end, data
compiled by Bloomberg show.  Duratex surged 6.6 percent to 10.23 reais, the most on a
closing basis since October 2009.  Oil traded near its highest in a week as better-than-
forecast economic data from  Japan  allayed concern that the
global recovery has faded. Crude for September delivery rose as
much as 2.5 percent to $87.49 a barrel on the  New York
Mercantile Exchange .  The UBS Bloomberg CMCI Index of 27 raw materials rose 0.6
percent. Petrobras, as Petroleo Brasileiro is known, jumped 2.1
percent to 20.72 reais. OGX increased 1.4 percent to 11.32
reais.  Hypermarcas  Hypermarcas SA, Brazil’s fifth-largest consumer-goods
company by market value, rose 3.9 percent to 11.71 reais after
announcing a plan to buy back as many as 35 million of its
shares by August 2012, according to a regulatory filing.
Separately, the company reported second-quarter net income of
53.3 million reais ($33.4 million), trailing the average
estimate for profit excluding some items of 92.8 million reais
in a Bloomberg survey of 10 analysts.  PDG Realty SA Empreendimentos & Participacoes, Brazil’s
biggest homebuilder by revenue, gained 3.6 percent to 7.54 reais
after it said second-quarter adjusted net income rose 12 percent
to 247.5 million reais from 220.3 million reais a year earlier,
according to a statement published on the company’s website.  Diagnosticos da America SA, the medical-diagnostics firm
known as Dasa, slumped 4.3 percent to 17.74 reais. The company
said second-quarter net income fell 45 percent from a year
earlier to 25.7 million reais, according to a regulatory filing.
That compares with an average forecast of 49.3 million reais in
a Bloomberg survey of six analysts.  Bear Market   The Bovespa entered a bear market on July 27 after plunging
20 percent from its bull-market peak in November. The measure
extended that slide to 27 percent through Aug. 12.  The index trades at 8.7 times analysts’ earnings estimates,
near the lowest since February 2009, according to weekly data
compiled by Bloomberg. That compares to a ratio of 12 for the
Shanghai Composite Index, 5.9 for  Russia ’s Micex and 13.9 for
 India ’s Sensex.  Traders moved 6.92 billion reais in stocks in Sao Paulo on
Aug. 12, data compiled by Bloomberg show. That compares to a
daily average this year of 6.46 billion reais through Aug. 10,
according to data from the exchange.  To contact the reporter on this story:
