Canadian natural gas fell as normal
temperatures were forecast for most of the U.S., curbing demand
for the power-plant fuel.  Canadian gas prices, which usually follow their U.S.
counterparts on the  New York Mercantile Exchange , dropped 0.6
percent as MDA EarthSat Weather of Gaithersburg, Maryland, said
most of the U.S. besides Texas and the southern Plains will have
seasonal-to-cool weather until Aug. 19.  “The weather is getting less hot so the market is leaning
toward the downside,” said Eric Bickel, an analyst at Summit
Energy Services Inc. in Louisville, Kentucky. “Storms aren’t
really threatening production right now.”  Alberta  gas for September delivery declined 2 cents to
C$3.45 per gigajoule ($3.33 per million British thermal units)
as of 3 p.m.  New York  time, according to  NGX , a Canadian
Internet market. October gas fell 3.75 cents to C$3.435. Gas
traded on the exchange goes to users in Canada and the U.S. and
is priced on  TransCanada Corp. (TRP) ’s Alberta system.  In New York, natural gas for September delivery fell 3.6
cents to settle at $4.024 per million Btu.  The high in New York today may reach 77 degrees Fahrenheit
(24 Celsius), 6 below normal, according to AccuWeather Inc. of
 State College , Pennsylvania.  Gas Flows  Volume on TransCanada’s  Alberta system , which collects the
output of most of the nation’s gas wells, was 15.8 billion cubic
feet as of 2 p.m. in New York.  Gas was flowing at a daily rate of 2.54 billion cubic feet
at Empress, Alberta, where the fuel is transferred to
TransCanada’s main line.  At McNeil, Saskatchewan, where gas is transferred to the
Northern Border Pipeline for shipment to the Chicago area, the
daily flow rate was 2.03 billion cubic feet.  Available capacity on TransCanada’s British Columbia system
at Kingsgate was 1.32 billion cubic feet. The system was
forecast to carry 1.44 billion cubic feet today, about 52
percent of its capacity of 2.58 billion.  Gas at the Alliance Pipeline delivery point near Chicago
fell 12.71 cents, or 3 percent, to $4.0923 per million Btu as of
1:33 p.m. on the  Intercontinental Exchange . Alliance is an
express line that can carry 1.5 billion cubic feet a day to the
Midwest from western  Canada .  At the Kingsgate point on the border of  Idaho  and British
Columbia, gas dropped 8.43 cents, or 2.2 percent, to $3.7997.  To contact the reporter on this story:
