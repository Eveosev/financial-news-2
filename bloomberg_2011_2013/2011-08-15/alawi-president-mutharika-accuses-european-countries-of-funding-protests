Malawi’s president, Bingu wa
Mutharika, accused ‘some’ European countries of funding protests
to overthrow his government.  “We know some European governments are behind instability
in this country,” Mutharika said in a speech on Malawi
Broadcasting Corp. radio yesterday. “They have given the non-
governmental organizations money to organize a second round of
demonstrations. Their aim is to topple a legitimate
government.”  Civil society groups have called for a second round of
demonstrations against government policies and continuing fuel
and currency shortages. Malawi devalued the kwacha by 10 percent
last week to help alleviate foreign exchange shortages,
Mutharika said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
