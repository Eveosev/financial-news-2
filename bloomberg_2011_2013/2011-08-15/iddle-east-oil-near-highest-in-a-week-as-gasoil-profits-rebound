Middle East crude oil for sale to
 Asia  traded near the highest in a week as profits from making
gasoil rebounded. Murban’s premium over spot prices was the
widest in two months.  Murban, produced by Abu Dhabi National Oil Co., for loading
in October traded at a premium of 16 cents a barrel to its
official selling price for a second day, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg News. The gap is the highest since June 3
as the profit from making gasoil rebounded from a 3.8 percent
decline last week.  Gasoil’s premium to Dubai crude, a measure of processing
profit, rose 27 cents, or 1.5 percent, to $18.75 a barrel,
according to data from PVM Oil Associates, a London-based
broker.  Oman crude for immediate loading was at $103.10 a barrel,
down 14 cents, Bloomberg data showed. Prices were at $103.24 a
barrel on Aug. 12, the highest since Aug. 4.  Dubai oil for delivery in October was at $102.73, down 9
cents. Murban fell 9 cents to $106.85 a barrel.  Oman crude futures for October delivery on the  Dubai
Mercantile Exchange  rose 51 cents, or 0.5 percent, to $103 a
barrel at 4:40 p.m. Singapore time, with 1,016 contracts traded.
The settlement price was $103.15 at 12:30 p.m. in Dubai.  The September Brent-Dubai EFS rose 9 cents to $5.51 a
barrel, according to PVM data. The exchange for swaps for
October gained 6 cents to $5.10 a barrel.  To contact the reporter on this story:
