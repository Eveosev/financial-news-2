Libyan leader  Muammar Qaddafi  called
on his followers to resist rebels and NATO forces, according to
state media, as rebel fighters claimed advances on the
battlefield after several weeks of stalemate.  “Move forward, challenge, take up arms, go fight in order
to liberate  Libya  inch-by-inch from the traitors and NATO,” the
state’s Jamahiriya news agency, JANA,  cited  Qaddafi as saying in
an address yesterday in the capital, Tripoli, that was carried
in an audio version on state television. “Prepare for battle,
prepare to march.”  The speech came after rebel fighters said they had taken
Zawiya, a town west of Tripoli, and cut the coastal highway to
Tunisia from the capital. They also said they took Tawarga, near
the rebel-held western city of Misrata.  Anti-government protests that began in February were met by
a crackdown by Qaddafi. A month later, the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization began an air campaign that it said was aimed at
protecting civilians.  To contact the reporter on this story:
