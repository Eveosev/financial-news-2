The  European Central Bank  spent a
record amount on  government bonds  last week as it began buying
Italian and Spanish securities to contain the debt crisis.  The Frankfurt-based ECB said today it settled purchases
worth 22 billion euros ($31.7 billion) in the week through Aug.
12, more than the 15 billion-euro median estimate in a Bloomberg
News survey of 19 economists and strategists. That also
surpasses the 16.5 billion euros the ECB spent during the first
week of its initial foray into Greek markets in May last year.  “The market optimists will interpret this number as good
news as it underscores the ECB’s resolve,” said  Christoph Rieger , head of fixed-income strategy at Commerzbank AG in
 Frankfurt . “Equally, the pessimists will point out that it is
bad news as it shows how much money the ECB had to commit for
the yield compression seen.”  The ECB was forced to start buying Italian and Spanish
bonds on Aug. 8 after politicians failed to convince investors
they could contain the debt crisis. Ten-year yields in both
countries, which had soared to euro-era highs, last week dropped
by more than 100 basis points to about 5 percent.  The ECB will take seven-day term deposits from banks
tomorrow to absorb the 96 billion euros of liquidity created
since its bond program started on May 10 last year, a practice
it employs to ensure the purchases don’t fuel inflation.  To contact the reporter on this story:
