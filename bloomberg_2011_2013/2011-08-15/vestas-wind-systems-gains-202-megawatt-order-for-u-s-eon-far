Vestas Wind Systems A/S, the world’s
biggest wind-turbine maker, won an order for 202 megawatts of
 wind turbines  from an EON AG unit for a project in the U.S.  EON Climate & Renewables North America LLC ordered 112
V100-1.8 megawatt turbines to be delivered in the first half of
2012, Randers, Denmark-based Vestas said in a  statement . Once
the project is commissioned in mid 2012, it will provide enough
electricity to power more than 60,000 American homes for a year.  “EON chose a turbine that is specifically designed to
capture the lower wind speeds,” Martha Wyrsch, president of
Vestas-American Wind Technology Inc., said in the statement.  Vestas has announced six North American deals in 2011 with
three turbine types, totaling 976 megawatts. The location and
name of the latest project will be disclosed later, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
