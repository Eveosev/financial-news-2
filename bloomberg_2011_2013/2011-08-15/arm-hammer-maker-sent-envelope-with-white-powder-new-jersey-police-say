A hazardous materials team was sent
to the New Jersey headquarters of Church & Dwight Co., the maker
of Arm & Hammer baking soda, after an employee got an envelope
with a substance that turned out to be powdered sugar.  Princeton  Township police  were called to the company’s
headquarters on North Harrison Street at about 11 a.m. local
time for a report that an employee at a satellite office
received an envelope containing the white powder, Sergeant
Michael Cifelli said in a telephone interview.  Police called the  Trenton Fire Department , which dispatched
a hazardous materials unit to the evaluate the substance and
later determined it was sugar, Cifelli said. Maureen Usifer, a
spokeswoman for Church & Dwight, didn’t immediately return a
voice-mail message seeking comment on today’s incident.  The envelope also contained a letter, the contents of which
Cifelli declined to reveal. An investigation is continuing and
police plan to work with the U.S. Federal Bureau of
Investigation and the Homeland Security Department, he said.  Five people were killed and 17 others were sickened in 2001
after handling anthrax-laced letters sent through the U.S. mail,
including some that were sent from a mailbox in Princeton. U.S.
investigators later concluded that the late Bruce Ivins, a
government scientist, acted alone in the attacks.  To contact the reporter on this story:
