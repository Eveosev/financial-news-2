Asian oil refiners plan to reduce
West African crude imports for next month by 18 percent to 41
cargoes, 9 fewer than August, according to a survey of seven
traders involved in the transactions.  Shipments totaling 39.4 million barrels, or 1.31 million
barrels a day, will be exported from  Angola , Nigeria and the
Republic of Congo in September, according to the poll and an
analysis of loading programs obtained by Bloomberg News. That
compares with 47.6 million barrels, or 1.54 million barrels a
day for this month.  Chinese refiners will import 24 cargoes, unchanged from
August, while Indian processors bought nine shipments for
September, down from 17 this month, according to the survey.  Indian Oil Corp., the nationâ€™s largest refiner, purchased
five cargoes for loading in September, compared with 13 this
month, the survey showed. The company plans to shut part of its
Mathura plant in northern  India  for about 20 days in September,
two people with knowledge of the schedule said on March 30.  The August program was revised to 50 cargoes from 49
previously.  Most Nigerian and many Angolan grades are trading at higher
premiums to North Sea Dated Brent, used to price more than half
of global oil, from a month ago.  Nigerian benchmark Qua Iboe was at a premium of $2.83 a
barrel to Dated Brent on Aug. 4, the highest since June 1,
compared with an average of $1.96 in July, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg News. The grade was yesterday at $2.81
more than the benchmark.  Nigeria  plans to export 2.23 million barrels a day of crude
next month and Angola will ship 1.67 million barrels, Bloomberg
calculations based on loading programs showed.  The following table shows details of planned Asian imports
of West African crude. Each cargo ranges from 950,000 barrels to
1 million barrels.  To contact the reporter on this story:
