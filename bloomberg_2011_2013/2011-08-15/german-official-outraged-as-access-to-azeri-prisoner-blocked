Germany ’s commissioner for human
rights expressed “outrage” after the government in Azerbaijan
blocked his access to political prisoners in the capital Baku.  Markus Loening, who is on a three-day visit to the Caucasus
republic, said the Azeri Justice Ministry prevented him from
visiting a prisoner, Bakhtiyar Hajiyev, even though the German
official announced his trip three weeks ago, the Foreign
Ministry said in an e-mailed statement from Berlin. Such
treatment doesn’t conform with the standards of the  Council of
Europe , he said.  “This fits in with a country that blocks youth activists,
represses freedom of speech and bans peaceful demonstration,”
Loening said in the statement.  Hajiyev, a Harvard University graduate who used Facebook
Inc. to call for anti-government protests in  Azerbaijan  earlier
this year, was sentenced to two years in prison in May for
dodging military service. The protests, an effort to replicate
the uprisings that ousted authoritarian rulers in Egypt and
 Tunisia , resulted in the detention of hundreds of protesters.  Azerbaijan exports oil to  Europe  through the Baku-Tbilisi-
Ceyhan pipeline and counts BP Plc, Europe’s second-biggest oil
producer, among its largest investors.  To contact the reporter on this story:
