STX OSV Holdings Ltd. (SOH) , the offshore-
vessel making arm of  Europe ’s largest shipyard, rose by a record
in Singapore trading after forecasting “healthy” orders.  The company jumped 9.9 percent to S$1.39 at the close. It
has advanced 22 percent this year, compared with a 12 percent
decline for the Straits Times Index.  Alesund, Norway-based STX OSV said on Aug. 13 that demand
for offshore and specialized vessels will lead to “healthy”
orders this year and that earnings will be no less than in 2010.
The company, whose vessels are used to support oil-rigs, also
boosted its operating margin to 15 percent in the first half
from 8.5 percent a year earlier.  “The company is in a sweet spot to benefit from a recovery
in the newbuild cycle,” Jeremy Thia, an analyst at DBS Vickers,
said in a note today. STX OSV may win about 5.6 billion kroner
($1 billion) of orders in the second half, compared with 3.1
billion kroner in the first six month, he said.  STX OSV doubled operating profit in the second quarter to
420 million kroner. Net income dropped 21 percent to 272 million
kroner.  To contact the reporter on this story:
