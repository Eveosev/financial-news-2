India has paid two-third of its debt
to  Iran  for crude oil imports from the Persian Gulf nation,
Iranian Central Bank Governor Mahmoud Bahmani said.  “The rest of the debt is being received and there is no
problem regarding this matter,” Bahmani said today, according
to state-run  Iranian Students News Agency .  Indian refiners’ debt to Iran stood at $4.8 billion in
early August, National Iranian Oil Co. Managing Director Ahmad Qalebani said on Aug. 8, adding that the country had at that
time received about 1 billion euros ($1.4 billion) from India.  The Gulf state is constrained by international sanctions
over its nuclear program and Indian refiners have said banks are
unwilling to transfer payments for their oil purchases.  India 
has sorted out the financial impasse with Iran, the country’s
Finance Minister Pranab Mukherjee said in parliament on Aug. 12,
without providing details.  Iran is the second-largest oil producer in the Organization
of Petroleum Exporting Countries after  Saudi Arabia .  To contact the reporter on this story:
