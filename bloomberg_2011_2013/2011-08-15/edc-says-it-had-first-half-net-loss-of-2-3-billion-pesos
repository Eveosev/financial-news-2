Energy Development Corp. (EDC) , the
 Philippines â€™ largest geothermal company, said it recorded a net
loss of 2.3 billion pesos in the first half of the year from a
profit of 5.63 billion pesos a year earlier.  The loss was due to a 5 billion-peso impairment charge for
its Northern Negros Geothermal Power Plant and a 900-million
peso reduction in steam revenues, the company said in a
disclosure to the stock exchange today.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
