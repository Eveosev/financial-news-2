Alex Rodriguez  said he plans to
rejoin the  New York Yankees  this week after missing more than a
month following arthroscopic knee surgery.  The Yankees’ All-Star third baseman is completing a
rehabilitation program and said he could be back with the
Yankees by Aug. 18, according to MLB.com.  Rodriguez has played two games with the Yankees’ Class-A
minor league affiliate in Tampa,  Florida , and is set to play two
games for Triple-A Scranton/Wilkes Barre this week.  “Just don’t want any setbacks,” Rodriguez, a three-time
American League Most Valuable Player, said on  MLB.com . “It’s
just about taking one step at a time.”  Rodriguez, 36, was injured in a game against the  Chicago
Cubs  on June 19 and had surgery on July 11. Before going on the
disabled list, he hadn’t hit a home run in 85 at-bats, the
longest single-season drought of his career. Rodriguez ranks
sixth in Major League Baseball history with 626 home runs.  Rodriguez went 2-for-6 with a double and homer for Tampa.  “Just to be able to drive the ball out of the park,
whether it’s A, Double-A, Triple-A, the fact that I could drive
the ball, hopefully it’s a sign of good things to come,” said
Rodriguez, who is batting .295 with 13 home runs and 52 runs
batted in over 80 games this season.  New York trails first-place Boston by a half-game in the
American League Eastern Division. The Yankees are scheduled to
finish the regular season Sept. 28 and 11 of their final 27
games are against the division-rival Red Sox and  Tampa Bay Rays .  To contact the reporter on this story:
