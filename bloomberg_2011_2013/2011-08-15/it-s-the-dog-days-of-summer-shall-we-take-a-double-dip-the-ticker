Now that the U.S. has survived the debt-ceiling debate, the downgrade and the topsy-turviest Wall Street week in recent memory, we can get back to focusing on the gloomy big picture. Specifically, are we going to have a  double-dip  recession? More specifically, are we already in one? The  Wall Street Journal  did an informal poll of 46 economists who "put the odds that the U.S. is already in another recession at 13%, while they peg the chances of going that way in the next year at 29% -- up from 17% only a month ago."  USA Today  followed suit: "The 39 economists polled Aug. 3-11 put the chance of another downturn at 30% -- twice as high as three months ago, according to their median estimates."  OK, insert your own "two economists walked into a bar" joke here if you'd like,  but I'm going to take a more thorough look at what the big brains have been saying recent days. Let's start with the official line, courtesy of  William C. Dudley , president of the New York Fed.  “We do not expect a double-dip recession, but clearly when the economy is growing more slowly you would have to say that the risks have risen somewhat,” Dudley said in a Q&A session with reporters on Friday. “We’re still expecting our economy to accelerate in the second half of the year.”   Reassured? Not if you listen to the ex-official line, in the person of  former top Obama economic adviser  Lawrence Summers : Mark Zandi  of Moody's Analytics likes those odds, or at least agrees with them: While omnipresent analyst  Meredith Whitney 's prediction of widespread municipal defaults hasn't been fulfilled, she's just as bearish on the economy as a whole: "I think you're getting increasing signs that we're at a risk for a double dip," she warned. "Our GDP number on Friday was an indication that states and local governments, which make up 12 percent of GDP, are really pulling back. We're certainly at a double dip of housing. That puts enormous pressure on the economy." And if you're expecting something more hopeful from that great prophet of doom and gloom  Nouriel Roubini , you haven't been paying attention.  "At this point there is serious risk of a double-dip recession in the U.S. and most other advanced economies," he told Foreign Policy magazine. "If you look at the latest numbers from the  United States , from GDP growth in the first quarter, to consumption, to housing, to even the labor market figures today, they are very weak. [The unemployment figures] were better than expected because expectations were low and the  unemployment rate  fell only because 200,000 people got so discouraged that they left the  labor force . Otherwise it would have gone up." For dissent, Roubini need only look at his own website, Economonitor. "What’s the decline in the rolling 12-month percentage for new claims suggesting?" asks  James Picino .  "The odds of a new recession are still minimal. Economic contractions aren’t normally associated with jobless claims falling by double-digits on an annual basis. And with last week’s relatively encouraging numbers for jobs creation in July offering some positive corroboration, perhaps the labor market isn’t set to capitulate after all. Yes, hope may be hanging by this one thread, but it’s a rather thick thread. If it gives way, all may be lost, but so far we’re hanging on." Also on the optimistic side are a gaggle of economists  -- Maury N. Harris, Drew T. Matus, Samuel D. Coffin and Kevin Cummins --  at UBS Global Economic Research: Mark Thoma  of the University of Oregon factors in last week's  report  on the decline in Americans filing for  unemployment benefits , and comes up smiling. Or, at least he's not sobbing. "We are having trouble gaining the traction needed to grow robustly -- the growth rate of output and employment is far too slow -- but it is not what you’d expect to see if a double dip was just around the corner," he explains. "Don’t get me wrong, we can’t rule out a double dip by any means and the slow growth we are experiencing calls for policymakers to provide help in any case, but this does tip the scales a little bit in the other direction." Bob Doll , the chief equity analyst at BlackRock, also finds a silver lining: “I see plenty of excellent buying opportunities amongst defensive and cyclical companies,”   James Bevan,  chief investment officer at CCLA Investment Management Ltd., told Bloomberg Television. “I am not really worried about a double-dip recession.” "Everyone is gloomy. But is this pessimism getting a little overbaked?" asks  Larry Kudlow . "Granted, the economy is sputtering, with less than 1 percent growth in the first half of the year. But if there is a recession in the cards, it will be the first time one occurs when the yield curve is steeply positive (an ultra-easy Fed) and corporate profits are strong. And since we do have ultra-easy money and strong profits.  I don’t believe we’re heading into a recession. Nor do I believe stocks will continue to swoon.  The principal reason for the sub-par first-half economy is the rise of inflation, which severely damaged real incomes and  consumer spending . We experienced a mini oil shock, which has dampened the whole economy. Actually, it’s worth remembering that oil shocks and inverted yield curves, along with  falling profits, are the most important leading indicators of recessions. We don’t have this right now." Perhaps the ultimate word in noncomforting optimism comes from Pimco's  Mohamed El-Erian : "Because of the nature of our economy, it's not enough for us to have 1 to 2 percent growth. We need more than that. We already have a large unemployment problem that is becoming more structural in nature, and we have overindebted sectors that need growth. So the likelihood is that we won't have a recession, but we will feel like we're in a recession." If  the economists can't agree, can the financial journalists? "Odds of recession have risen in the last month but I’d still put them below 50%," writes  G.I. at the Economist's Free Exchange .  "Yes, stock and bond markets have discounted the worst, but the hard data has actually gotten better. First, there was the positive employment report last Friday, largely drowned out by Standard & Poor’s downgrade of America’s credit rating. And we now have three consecutive weeks of relatively low initial unemployment insurance claims, hinting that the labour market’s improvement continued into early August." "If this is the beginning of a new double dip, it will have two significant things in common with the dual recessions of 1980 and 1981-82," adds  Floyd Norris  of the New York Times. "In each case the first recession was caused in large part by a sudden withdrawal of credit from the economy. The recovery came when credit conditions recovered. And in each case the second recession began at a time when the usual government policies to fight economic weakness were deemed unavailable. Then, the need to fight inflation ruled out an easier monetary policy. Now, the perceived need to reduce government spending rules out a more accommodating fiscal policy." In the end, we can all spout predictions as easily as we can complain about the weather, but in the end neither the market gods nor Mother Nature pay us any heed. Let's leave off with the wisdom of  George Soros :  "The indebtedness of the US is not all that high. But if a double-dip recession was in doubt a few weeks ago, it is less in doubt now, because financial markets have a very safe way of predicting the future. They cause it." So, View readers, what self-fulfilling prediction do you think the markets will make? Let us know in the comments section. (Tobin Harshaw is a member of the Bloomberg View editorial board.)
