Legislation allowing issuance of
covered bonds by Australian lenders may be introduced in
Parliament by November, according to the Treasury.  John Lonsdale, general manager, financial system division
of the markets group at the Treasury, spoke at a conference on
covered bonds in Sydney today.  Covered bonds, which typically have the highest  credit
rating , are backed by assets that stay on the bankâ€™s balance
sheet and can be sold in a default. Australian lenders are
banned from offering the securities at home under laws that
favor depositors over creditors.  The government released draft legislation in March to lift
the ban and give local banks access to cheaper funding in a
nation with the highest interest rates in the developed world.  To contact the reporter on this story:
