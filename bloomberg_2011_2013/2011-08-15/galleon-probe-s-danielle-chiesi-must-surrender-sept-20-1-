Danielle Chiesi, the former New
Castle Funds LLC analyst sentenced to 2-1/2 years in prison
after pleading guilty to passing inside stock tips to Galleon
Group LLC co-founder  Raj Rajaratnam , must surrender to begin her
prison term on Sept. 20, a federal judge ruled.  U.S. District Court Judge Richard Holwell in Manhattan
issued the order today. He sentenced the 45-year-old former
beauty queen last month after calling her crimes “deplorable.”  Holwell also sentenced Chiesi to a $25,000 fine, ordered
her to do 250 hours of community service and imposed two years
of supervised release after her prison term.  Chiesi pleaded guilty Jan. 19 to three counts of
conspiracy, telling Holwell at the time that she was “deeply
ashamed” of what she had done.  The case is U.S. v. Rajaratnam, 09-cr-1184, U.S. District
Court, Southern District of  New York  ( Manhattan ).  To contact the reporter on this story:
