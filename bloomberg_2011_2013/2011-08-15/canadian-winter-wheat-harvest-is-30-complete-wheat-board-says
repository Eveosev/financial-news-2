Canada ’s winter-wheat harvest is 30
percent complete, while 2 percent of barley crops have been
collected, the Canadian Wheat Board said.  About 2 percent of all crops have been harvested across the
prairies, “slightly behind” the normal 3 percent pace because
of late planting this year, the board said today in an e-mailed
statement. Crops in Manitoba have developed the fastest, with
the spring-crop harvest beginning in some areas because of
warmer temperatures, according to the report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
