South African council workers
started a strike to demand an 18 percent pay increase, said
Tahir Sema, a spokesman for the South African Municipal Workers’
Union.  More than 200,000 employees in the municipal and water
industries will stop working today, Sema said by phone from
Johannesburg. The South African Local Government Association,
which represents 278 councils across the country, said yesterday
it can’t afford the pay rise demanded by labor unions.  South
Africa ’s annual inflation was 5 percent in June.  “There are no meetings with the employers scheduled today
or any time soon,” Sema said. “If they come to us with a
reasonable offer and are prepared to meet with us, we’re
prepared to call off the strike.”  Strikes have affected South Africa’s petroleum, mining and
chemical industries in the last month. A five-day strike by
municipal workers in July 2009 over wages was marred by violence
as workers tipped rubbish bins into streets and disrupted street
sweeping and vehicle-licensing services. That strike ended after
local councils agreed to increase wages by 13 percent.  It’s too early to say how many employees went on strike,
City of Johannesburg spokesman Gabu Tugwana said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
