Indonesia ’s rupiah advanced,
snapping two days of losses, as U.S. economic data tempered
concern the global economic recovery is stalling.  The MSCI Asia-Pacific Index of regional shares rose 1.2
percent after the Commerce Department said on Aug. 12 retail
sales in the U.S. rose 0.5 percent in July, the most in four
months. The world’s largest economy was the third-biggest buyer
of Indonesia’s non-oil exports in June, according to official
data.  “Better data from the U.S. helped to calm investors,”
said Lindawati Susanto, head of treasury at PT Bank Resona
Perdania in Jakarta. “Asian stocks and currencies are up.”  The rupiah strengthened 0.3 percent to 8,536 per dollar as
of 8:19 a.m. in Jakarta, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  The currency has appreciated 5.2 percent this year, the
second-best performance among  Asia ’s 10 most-traded currencies
excluding the yen, as global investors bought $2.1 billion more
local shares than they sold. They boosted  ownership  of the
nation’s bonds by 24 percent to 243.12 trillion rupiah ($28.5
billion) this  year  through Aug. 11, according to the debt-
management office.  To contact the reporter on this story:
