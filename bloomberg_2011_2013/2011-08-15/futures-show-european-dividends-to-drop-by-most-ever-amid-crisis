Dividend futures for  Europe ’s
biggest companies expiring in two years dropped to the lowest
level compared with next year’s contracts amid concern the debt
crisis and slowing growth will force reductions in payouts.  Euro Stoxx 50 Index dividend futures expiring in 2013 are
14 percent lower than those for 2012, data compiled by Bloomberg
show. The difference between the contracts was the highest ever
on Aug. 10 at 17 percent.  Concern a global economic slowdown will reduce payouts to
investors is focusing on 2013 because next year’s level is tied
to earnings that are being reported now, according to Davide Silvestrini, head of European equity derivatives strategy at
JPMorgan Chase & Co. Companies in the gauge cut dividends 29
percent from their high in 2008 through 2010 during the worst
global recession since World War II.  “The market correction particularly hurt 2013 and longer-
dated dividend futures, where earnings visibility is
considerably lower compared with 2012 dividends,” Silvestrini
said in a phone interview from  London . “Consensus estimates for
dividends have been declining, and the risk of substantial cuts
from banks and utilities remains.”  Euro Stoxx 50 Sinks  The Euro Stoxx 50 plunged 22 percent from July 22 to Aug.
10, when it fell to the lowest level since April 2009, as
concern grew that measures taken to stave off the European debt
crisis are insufficient and that growth in the U.S., the world’s
largest economy, is slowing. The index rose 0.7 percent to
2,324.48 today.  Banks, which account for 16 percent of the Euro Stoxx 50,
have declined for three straight weeks, driving the Stoxx 600
Banks Index down 24 percent this year through Aug. 12.  Societe
Generale (GLE)  SA,  France ’s second-biggest lender, tumbled 15 percent
on Aug. 10, the most since October 2008, and  Credit Agricole SA (ACA) 
that day touched a record low of 6.07 euros, as the cost of
insuring French government debt rose to an all-time high.  Euro Stoxx 50 2013 dividend futures, whose value depends on
2012 earnings, sank 18 percent from July 22 to Aug. 10, versus a
7.3 percent decline for the 2012 contracts. Companies in the
index will pay 133.46 points in dividends in 2012, according to
Bloomberg Dividend Forecasts. That corresponds to a yield of 5.7
percent compared with today’s Euro Stoxx 50 closing level.  Missed Projections  About 60 percent of the 33 Euro Stoxx 50 companies that
have reported earnings from July 11 through Aug. 12 missed
analysts’ projections, data compiled by Bloomberg show.
Companies from  Alstom SA (ALO) , the world’s third-largest power-
equipment maker, to EON AG have revised their forecasts.  Alstom Chief Executive Officer Patrick Kron last month said
sales will be “slightly down,” and EON,  Germany ’s largest
utility, on Aug. 10 cut its full-year dividend to 1 euro a share
from a projected 2011 and 2012 payout of at least 1.30 euros.  Even so, the potential returns from dividend futures
expiring in 2013 and beyond are attractive relative to the risk
taken because the difference between the 2012 and 2013 contracts
has reached “extreme levels,” Goldman Sachs Group Inc. said in
a note last week.  While investors are currently more bullish on 2012
dividends than 2013, next year’s payouts may also be at risk
from the slowing economy, according to BNP Paribas SA. The
Paris-based bank recommended selling Euro Stoxx 50 2012 dividend
futures and buying the 2014 contracts, a strategy designed to
perform even in the event of another recession, according to an
Aug. 11 report.  ‘Vulnerable’ Dividends  “In the event there is a recession, we find it unlikely,
given the high percentage of banks and other financials in the
index, that all expected dividends would be able to be paid,”
Orrin Sharp-Pierson, global equity strategist at BNP in London,
said in a phone interview. “Dividends to be paid in 2012 are
vulnerable in the scenario of a further economic downturn.”  Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc on Aug. 2 recommended
investors buy FTSE 100 December 2012 dividend futures rather
than the Euro Stoxx 50 equivalent as banks and insurers account
for a higher portion of the European index. The Edinburgh-based
bank reiterated its recommendation on Aug. 11.  “Exotics desks have been notable sellers of implied
dividends as the equity markets have fallen,” RBS’s strategists
Stephen Einchcomb, Bhavin Patel and Richard Kind wrote in the
Aug. 11 note, referring to the dividend contracts. “Dividend
markets are now pricing in growth rates lower than seen
previously in 2010 with Euro Stoxx 50 estimated earnings yields
dramatically falling.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
