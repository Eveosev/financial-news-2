Cash premiums for corn shipped in
August to export terminals near  New Orleans  fell relative to
Chicago futures on signs of reduced exports. The soybean basis
was unchanged.  The spot-basis bid, or premium, for corn delivered this
month was 76 cents to 78 cents a bushel above September futures,
down from 77 cents to 78 cents on Aug. 12, U.S. Department of
Agriculture  data  show. The soybean basis was 58 cents to 64
cents a bushel.  “Farmers aren’t selling, and exporters are waiting for the
start of the harvest,” which has begun for corn in parts of
Missouri, Kentucky and  Illinois , Bryce Stremming, a risk
consultant at Mid-Co Commodities Inc. in Bloomington, Illinois,
said in a telephone interview. “Export shipments are slowing,
and that’s not a good trend heading into the harvest.”  Corn futures for September delivery rose 5.5 cents, or 0.8
percent, to close at $7.0725 a bushel on the Chicago Board of
Trade. The price rose 1.3 percent last week after the government
said farmers would harvest a smaller crop this year than
analysts forecast.  Soybean futures for November delivery rose 16.5 cents, or
1.2 percent, to $13.5125 a bushel. The price climbed for the
fourth straight session, the longest rally in a month.  The amount of corn inspected for export in the week ended
Aug. 11 fell 22 percent to 27.6 million bushels from a week
earlier, the USDA said today. Soybean inspections tumbled 30
percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
