The condition of the U.S. corn and
soybean crops was unchanged last week, the  U.S. Department of
Agriculture  said.  About 60 percent of the corn in the top 18 producing states
was in good or excellent condition as of yesterday, the USDA
said today in a report. A year earlier, 69 percent got the top
rating. An estimated 61 percent of the soybean crop was in good
or excellent condition, down from 66 percent a year earlier, the
USDA said.  The cotton crop improved, with 31 percent in good or
excellent condition, up from 30 percent a week earlier, the USDA
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
