California  scientists witnessed a
spike in radioactive airborne material in March following the
meltdown of Japan’s wrecked Fukushima Dai-Ichi nuclear power
plant, a study showed.  Researchers at the University of California,  San Diego ,
observed the highest levels ever detected of radioactive sulfur
in the atmosphere, 15 days after Fukushima’s operators cooled
the damaged reactors by pumping in seawater, according to a
study published today in the  Proceedings of the National Academy
of Sciences .  The 40-year-old Fukushima plant withstood the country’s
worst earthquake on record, only to have its power and back-up
generators knocked out by the 7-meter (23-foot) tsunami that
followed. Lacking electricity to pump water needed to cool the
atomic core, engineers vented radioactive steam into the
atmosphere to release pressure. A series of explosions ensued,
blowing out concrete walls around some reactors.  The amount of radioactive material that escaped from the
reactor’s core and found a kilometer above Fukushima was 365
times higher than normal, researchers calculated in the study.
About 0.7 percent of the material made its way 5,800 miles
across the  Pacific Ocean  to California, the study said.
Researchers made their measurements in La Jolla, California.  To contact the reporter on this story:
