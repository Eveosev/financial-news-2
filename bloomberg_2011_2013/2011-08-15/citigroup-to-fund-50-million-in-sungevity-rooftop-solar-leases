Citigroup Inc. (C) , the third-biggest
U.S. bank, has created a tax-equity fund to finance the
installation of $50 million worth of residential rooftop power
systems by Sungevity Inc.  The funds add to $120 million in similar tax-equity funds
Sungevity has raised since last year, the Oakland, California-
based company said today in a statement.  The fund will support projects in the eight states where
Sungevity operates -- Arizona, California, Colorado, Delaware,
Massachusetts, Maryland,  New Jersey  and New York. Sungevity
develops rooftop solar systems that it leases to homeowners.  In July, Citigroup created a fund to build about $105
million in residential solar projects with Sungevity rival
SunPower Corp. Citigroup began a 10-year initiative in 2007 to
invest $50 billion in alternative energy worldwide.  To contact the reporter on this story:
