Graham Onions has been called into
the England cricket squad for the fourth and final Test match
against India after  Chris Tremlett  was ruled out with a back
problem.  Another bowler,  James Anderson , is not sure to play because
of a leg injury. The game starts Aug. 18 at the Oval in London.  “We are hopeful that Jimmy will overcome this niggle by
Thursday but more time is required before a decision on his
availability can be made conclusively,” the England and Wales
Cricket Board said on its website.  England leads the series 3-0, so guaranteeing the No. 1
place in the Test rankings.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
