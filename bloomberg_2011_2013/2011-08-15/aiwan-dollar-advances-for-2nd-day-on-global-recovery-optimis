Taiwan ’s dollar gained for a second
day after better-than-forecast global economic data spurred
optimism the global recovery is intact, brightening the outlook
for the island’s exports.  The Taiex index of shares snapped a two-day decline after
the U.S. Commerce Department reported on Aug. 12 that retail
sales excluding autos increased 0.5 percent in July from a year
earlier after a revised 0.2 percent rise in June.  Japan ’s
economy shrank 1.3 percent in the second quarter from a year
earlier, less than the median estimate for a 2.5 percent
contraction in a Bloomberg survey.  “The retail sales rebound supported U.S. stocks on Friday
and boosted sentiment in  Asia  today,” said  Frances Cheung , a
senior strategist at Credit Agricole CIB in  Hong Kong . “The
better-than-expected Japanese GDP data shows the disruption to
supply chains the earthquake caused is dissipating.”  Taiwan’s dollar strengthened 0.2 percent to NT$28.952
against its U.S. counterpart as of the 4 p.m. local close,
according to Taipei Forex Inc. It reached NT$29.128 on Aug. 11,
the weakest level in almost four months.  Foreign funds bought $47 million more local shares than
they sold today, the first net purchase in ten days, according
to exchange data.  Government bonds were little changed. The yield on the 2
percent notes due July 2016 was 1.065 percent, from 1.062
percent at the end of last week, prices from Gretai Securities
Market show.  The overnight money-market rate, which measures interbank
funding availability, was little changed at 0.384 percent,
according to a weighted average compiled by the Taiwan Interbank
Money Center.  To contact the reporter on this story:
