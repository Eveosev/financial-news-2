Cocoa production in Cameroon,
 Africa ’s fourth-biggest grower of the chocolate ingredient, rose
20 percent during the 2010-11 season, according to the Cocoa and
Coffee Board.  The central African nation produced 236,690 metric tons
during the harvest that started in August 2010 and ended last
month, said Michael Ndoping, general manager of the board, in a
statement handed to reporters in Yaounde, the capital, today.
That compares with 198,000 tons produced a year earlier, he
said.  The number includes 28,413 tons of cocoa grindings,
according to the statement. The average annual export price was
1,496  CFA francs  ($3.27) and the average farmgate rate was 1,210
francs.  Cocoa for December delivery rose 0.2 percent, or 3 pounds
($4.91), to 1,855 pounds by 2:31 p.m. in London trading today.
 Ivory Coast , Ghana and Nigeria are the top cocoa producers in
Africa. The continent accounts for 68 percent of global output,
