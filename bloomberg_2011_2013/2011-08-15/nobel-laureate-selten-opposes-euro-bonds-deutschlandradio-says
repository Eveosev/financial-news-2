Reinhard Selten, who won the  Nobel
Prize  in economic sciences in 1994, is opposed to euro bonds,
 Deutschlandradio  said, citing an interview.  “It’s not the right thing,” because euro bonds would
undermine  Germany ’s creditworthiness, Selten was quoted as
saying. The European Union needs a new pact enforcing budgetary
discipline, Selten said, according to the report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
