Wells Fargo & Co. (WFC)  and  Barclays Plc (BARC) 
will be senior managers of California’s $5.4 billion short-term
notes sale the week of Sept. 12, a spokesman for state Treasurer
Bill Lockyer said.  The first such issue since November will have De La Rosa &
Co. as co-senior manager and Wells Fargo as book runner,  Tom Dresslar , a Lockyer spokesman, said in an e-mail yesterday.  Proceeds from the sale of the revenue anticipation notes,
or RANs, will repay a bridge loan from a syndicate of eight
banks and investors led by  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)  and Wells
Fargo, Dresslar said in an interview earlier this month.  Lockyer arranged the loan last month in the event of
credit-market disruption should the U.S. have defaulted on its
debt. RANs, which are typically issued by states when cash on
hand is low, are repaid from later tax collections.  To contact the reporter on this story:
