Israeli archaeologists excavating in
the Jezreel Valley uncovered a 1,800-year-old marble statue of a
naked Hercules leaning on a club and showing off the skin of a
Nemean lion.  “This is a rare discovery,” Israel Antiquities
Authority’s Walid Atrash said in an e-mailed statement. He said
the statue was about half a meter tall, made of smooth, white
marble and “of exceptional artistic quality.”  The statue was found in Horvat Tarbenet as part of an
excavation before a new railway that will link northern Israeli
communities of Haifa, Afula and Beit Shean,  the Antiquities
Authority  said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
