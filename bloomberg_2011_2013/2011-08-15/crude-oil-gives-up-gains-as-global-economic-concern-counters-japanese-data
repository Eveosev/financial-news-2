Oil fluctuated in  New York , after
declining for three weeks, as concern that the global economy is
slowing countered a less-than-expected contraction in  Japan , the
world’s third-biggest consumer of crude.  Futures were little changed after falling as much as 0.6
percent and climbing 0.3 percent. Reports this week may show the
U.S. housing industry remained depressed in July and European
growth eased last quarter. Japan’s economy shrank at an
annualized 1.3 percent rate in the three months ended June 30,
compared with the median forecast for a 2.5 percent drop in a
Bloomberg News survey of 25 economists.  “The market is still nervous,” said  Jonathan Barratt , a
managing director of Commodity Broking Services Pty in Sydney,
who maintained his forecast for New York oil to average $100 a
barrel this year. “We’ve got a big week of numbers. I think the
market has to try and get into the week on a positive note.”  Crude for September delivery was unchanged at $85.32 a
barrel in electronic trading on the  New York Mercantile Exchange 
at 5:33 p.m. Sydney time. The contract slid 34 cents, or 0.4
percent, to $85.38 on Aug. 12. Prices have fallen 15 percent in
the past three weeks and 7 percent this year.  Brent oil for September settlement was at $108.44, up 41
cents, on the London-based ICE Futures  Europe . The European
benchmark was at a premium of $23.04 to U.S. futures, compared
with a record close of $23.79 on Aug. 10.  Economic Reports  Reports this week will show U.S. housing starts and
building permits fell in July, while consumer prices rose the
least in three months as unemployment restrained spending,
according to surveys by Bloomberg News. The eurozone economy
probably expanded 0.3 percent in the second quarter, down from
first-quarter growth of 0.8 percent.  Most European stocks climbed, rebounding from three weeks
of losses. The benchmark Stoxx Europe 600 Index rose 0.2 percent
to 237.95 at 8:22 a.m. in  London  as eight stocks gained for each
that fell. Standard & Poor’s 500 Index futures increased 0.7
percent and the MSCI Asia Pacific Index advanced 1.8 percent.  New York oil futures slumped as low as $75.71 a barrel and
climbed as high as $87.37 last week before closing 1.7 percent
lower, the third straight weekly decline.  Hedge funds  cut bullish bets on crude to the lowest level
in more than eight months in the week ended Aug. 9, according to
a report last week. The funds and other large speculators
reduced their net-long positions, or wagers that prices will
rise, by 11 percent, according to the Commodity Futures Trading
Commission’s weekly Commitments of Traders report.  Technical Support  Oil has technical resistance at $89.84 a barrel, the 50
percent Fibonacci retracement of the drop in December 2008 to
$32.40 from a record $147.27 in July that year, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. Futures last week rebounded after
dropping below the 38.2 percent retracement at $76.28, signaling
a failure to sustain a breach of chart support.  Tropical Storm Gert is expected to pass near  Bermuda  today,
the National Hurricane Center said in an  advisory  at 11 p.m.
Miami time yesterday. Gert was located about 170 miles (275
kilometers) south-southeast of Bermuda with maximum sustained
winds of 45 mph, and was moving north-northwest at about 12 mph.  The U.S. is the world’s biggest crude-consuming nation,
followed by  China .  To contact the reporter on this story:
