OAO Surgutneftegas, a Russian oil
producer, said first-half profit rose 39 percent, helped by
higher crude prices.  Net income increased to 77.8 billion rubles ($2.7 billion)
from 56 billion rubles a year earlier, the Surgut-based company
said today on its  website . It reports earnings based on Russian
accounting standards.  Crude oil traded in  New York  averaged $98.38 a barrel in
the first half, peaking at $114.83 on May 2. That compares with
an average $78.48 a year earlier. Higher prices pushed sales up
38 percent to 381.3 billion rubles, Surgutneftegas said.  Surgutneftegas’s preferred shares rose 4 percent to 12.707
rubles as of 4:48 p.m. in Moscow.  The company may pay a dividend in 2012 of 1.29 rubles for
preferred shares, up from this year’s payout of 1.18 rubles,
according to Bloomberg data. It currently trades at a dividend
yield of 9.3 percent.  “Realistically we are going to have a higher dividend even
if  oil prices  go below $100 a barrel,” said  Alexei Kokin , an
oil and gas analyst at UralSib Financial Corp. in Moscow. “We
look at income because of dividends for preferred shares.”  The company said financial investments fell 5.4 percent to
449 billion rubles. That figure may exclude funds from the sale
of the company’s stake in Mol Nyrt, Kokin said.  The Hungarian state bought Surgutneftegas’s 21.2 percent
stake in the nation’s largest refiner in July, according to a
filing on the Budapest Stock Exchange.  Hungary had called Surgutneftegas a hostile shareholder and
opposed its participation in company affairs. The eastern
European state agreed to pay 1.88 billion euros ($2.68 billion)
for the stake in May. Surgutneftegas had acquired the stake from
OMV AG for 1.4 billion euros in 2009.  To contact the reporter on this story:
