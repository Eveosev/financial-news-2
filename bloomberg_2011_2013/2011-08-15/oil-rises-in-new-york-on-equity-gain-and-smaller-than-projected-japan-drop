Crude oil rose as equities climbed
and  Japan ’s economy contracted less than economists estimated in
the second quarter.  Futures advanced 2.9 percent after  Google Inc. (GOOG)  agreed to
buy mobile-phone maker Motorola Mobility Holdings Inc. for $12.5
billion. Japan’s gross domestic product shrank at an annualized
1.3 percent rate in the three months ended June 30, the Cabinet
office said in  Tokyo . Economists forecast a 2.5 percent drop,
according to a Bloomberg News survey.  “Oil will be taking its direction from the equity market
and the economy,” said Carl Larry, director of energy
derivatives and research at Blue Ocean LLC in New York.
“Everyone will be on pins and needles until we have a better
idea of where this economy, and with it oil demand, is going to
go.”  Crude oil for September delivery increased $2.50 to settle
at $87.88 a barrel on the  New York Mercantile Exchange . Futures
are up 17 percent in the past year.  Brent oil for September settlement rose $1.88, or 1.7
percent, to $109.91 on the London-based ICE Futures  Europe . The
European benchmark traded at a $22.03 premium to U.S. futures,
down from a record $25.54 on Aug. 11.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index advanced 1.9 percent to
1,200.74 and the  Dow Jones Industrial Average  gained 1.7 percent
to 11,454.48.  “It seems like the crude-oil market is following
equities,” said  Kyle Cooper , director of research for IAF
Advisors in Houston.  Euro Gain  The euro climbed on speculation a meeting tomorrow between
French President Nicolas Sarkozy and German Chancellor Angela Merkel in Paris may result in action to contain the region’s
debt crisis.  The dollar dropped 1.4 percent to $1.4444 against the euro,
from $1.4248 Aug. 12. A weaker U.S. currency bolsters the appeal
of dollar-denominated raw materials as an investment.  “The European situation seems to have settled down since
last week,” said  Michael Lynch , president of Strategic Energy &
Economic Research in Winchester,  Massachusetts . “Things are a
little calmer, which is good for the market.”  Middle East crude oil for sale to  Asia  traded near the
highest level in a week as profits from making gasoil rebounded.
Murban oil’s premium over spot prices was the widest in two
months.  Murban for loading in October traded at a premium of 16
cents a barrel to its official selling price for a second day,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The gap is the highest
since June 3 as the profit from making gasoil rebounded from a
3.8 percent decline last week. Murban is produced by the Abu
Dhabi National Oil Co.  Watching Gert  Tropical Storm Gert is turning north-northeast on a track
away from  Bermuda  and the North American coast, while a new
system over the Lesser Antilles will probably move toward
 Mexico , forecasters said.  Both Gert and a cluster of thunderstorms to the southeast
that lost strength today “are going to be fish storms,” said
 Matt Rogers , president of Commodity Weather Group LLC in
Bethesda,  Maryland .  Gert, with top winds of 60 miles (97 kilometers) per hour,
was 155 miles east-southeast of Bermuda and moving north at 12
mph, the U.S. National Hurricane Center said in  an advisory  at
about 10:40 a.m. East Coast time.  Gert is the seventh named storm of the Atlantic hurricane
season, which began June 1 and ends Nov. 30. None of the storms
have become hurricanes. From 1966 to 2009 there were, on
average, 11.3 named storms, of which 6.2 became hurricanes,
according to the  NHC website .  Hedge Funds  Hedge funds reduced bullish bets on  New York  crude to the
lowest level in more than eight months in the week ended Aug. 9,
according to a report last week.  The funds and other large speculators cut their net-long
positions, or wagers that prices will rise, by 17,313 futures
equivalents, or 11 percent, to 142,938, according to the
Commodity Futures Trading Commission’s weekly Commitments of
Traders report.  Speculative bets that Brent will rise, in futures and
options combined, outnumbered short positions by 48,852
contracts, the London-based exchange said today in the
Commitment of Traders report. Net-long positions fell by 47,019
contracts from 95,871 a week earlier.  “It appears that investors are ready to get back into the
market after the big sell-off,” Lynch said.  Manufacturing in the New York region unexpectedly
contracted for a third straight month in August as orders and
inventories dropped, a sign the industry that has led the
economic recovery is at risk of stumbling.  The Federal Reserve Bank of New York’s general economic
index fell to minus 7.7 from minus 3.8 in July, a report showed
today. The median forecast in a Bloomberg survey called for an
index of zero, the dividing line between expansion and
contraction. The so-called Empire State Index covers New York,
northern  New Jersey  and southern  Connecticut .  Oil volume in electronic trading on the Nymex was 520,834
contracts as of 3:35 p.m. in New York. Volume totaled 662,052
contracts on Aug. 12, 2.9 percent below the average of the past
three months. Open interest was 1.57 million contracts.  To contact the reporter on this story:
