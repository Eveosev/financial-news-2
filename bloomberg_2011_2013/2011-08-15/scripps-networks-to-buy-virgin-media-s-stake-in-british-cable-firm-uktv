Scripps Networks Interactive Inc. (SNI) ,
the U.S. television company that runs Food Network, agreed to
buy  Virgin Media Inc. (VMED) ’s 50 percent in British cable TV company
UKTV amid a push to expand outside its home market.  Scripps Networks, based in Knoxville, Tennessee, will pay
about 339 million pounds ($552 million) to buy the 50 percent
stake and the debt owed by UKTV to Virgin Media, the companies
said in a joint statement today.  BBC Worldwide, the commercial arm of public broadcaster
British Broadcasting Corporation, owns the remaining stake and
is in talks with Scripps to potentially increase its stake to a
maximum of 60 percent, the companies said.  UKTV produces television channels based on the  BBC ’s
program library and other acquired programming which are carried
on Virgin Media’s cable platform and also on satellite. In the
last quarter, UKTV contributed 6.8 million pounds in net income
to Virgin Media, the U.K.’s second-largest pay-television
company after British Sky Broadcasting Group Plc.  To contact the reporter on this story:
