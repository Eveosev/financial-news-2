Nigeria ’s naira depreciated to the
weakest in almost two months against the dollar at a foreign-
currency auction today after the central bank failed to meet
demand that rose to highest level this year.  The currency of sub-Saharan  Africa ’s second-biggest economy
declined to 151 per dollar at the central bank’s twice-weekly
auction, its weakest since the June 29 sale. The central bank
sold $400 million at the currency auction, less than $592
million demanded by lenders, the largest amount sought since
Dec. 15. The sale is the 11th consecutive auction where the
central bank didn’t meet lenders’ demand.  Africa’s biggest oil producer has been using foreign-
currency reserves to keep the naira within a 3 percentage-point
band above or below 150 per dollar at its bi-weekly auctions to
help check inflation, which slowed to 10.2 percent in June from
12.4 percent in May, remaining above the targeted rate of 10
percent.  “The naira bowed to pressure from cumulative demand for
dollars, for refined petroleum and manufactured-goods imports,”
Wale Abe, chief executive officer of the Financial Market
Dealers Association, an interbank clearing house for Nigerian
banks, said by phone from Lagos today. “Many requests that were
not met at previous auctions were presented by lenders.”  The central bank doubled the amount of dollars banks can
sell to foreign-exchange bureaux on Aug. 12 to $1 million to
further reduce demand pressure which has seen a widening in the
gap between their exchange rates and those used by banks and
bureau de change operators.  The external reserves of the West African country stood at
$35.3 billion as at Aug. 11, compared to $38.6 billion a year
earlier.  The naira weakened 0.2 percent to 153.85 per dollar in
interbank trading, at 5:18 p.m. in Lagos, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
