OAO Cherkizovo Group,  Russia ’s
largest meat producer, expects to receive state subsidies
totaling about 550 million rubles ($19 million) for poultry and
pork production.  Payments will come to 382 million rubles for poultry output
and about 168 million rubles for making pork, the Moscow-based
company  said  on its website today. The subsidies are part of
grants to regional budgets totaling 9 billion rubles that the
government plans to allot this year, it said.  “If the company gets the expected amount of subsidies, its
forecasted consolidated Ebitda will add 8 percent and forecasted
net profit will gain 13 percent in 2011,” said Natalia
Zagvozdina, an analyst at  Renaissance Capital  in Moscow. The
subsidies “flow directly to the company’s profit,” she said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
