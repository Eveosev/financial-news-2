Australia ’s dollar advanced against
a majority of its 16 most-traded counterparts as stocks rallied,
supporting demand for higher-yielding assets.  The Aussie rose against the yen after Japanese Finance
Minister  Yoshihiko Noda  signaled he’s ready to intervene in
markets again to bring down his nation’s currency. It reached
the highest level since Aug. 5 versus the greenback after
falling against the U.S. currency for the past two weeks. New
Zealand’s dollar depreciated against the greenback and the yen.  “The Aussie has been oversold the last couple of weeks,”
said  Omer Esiner , chief market analyst in Washington at
Commonwealth Foreign Exchange Inc., a currency brokerage. “It’s
no surprise to see it bounce back in a generally risk-on
session.”  The Australian dollar strengthened 1.3 percent to $1.0490
at 1:54 p.m. in  New York , from $1.0355 on Aug. 12. The Aussie
advanced 1.3 percent to 80.50 yen, from 79.44 yen.  New Zealand’s currency, nicknamed the kiwi, weakened 0.3
percent to 82.94 U.S. cents, from 83.22 cents, and declined 0.2
percent to 63.69 yen, from 63.85.  The MSCI World Index of stocks climbed 1.6 percent, and the
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index increased 1.5 percent.  Noda said yesterday “an unstable situation” was
continuing and that he will take “bold action if it becomes
necessary.”  Japan  stepped into the foreign-exchange market this month
for its third attempt in a year to weaken the yen to help
exporters.  To contact the reporters on this story:
