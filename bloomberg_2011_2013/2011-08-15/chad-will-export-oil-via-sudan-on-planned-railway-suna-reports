Chad  agreed to export oil pumped in
its east via neighboring Sudan, the state-run  SUNA   news agency 
 reported  yesterday, citing Sudanese Ambassador Abdalla al-
Sheikh.  The Khartoum-based news agency didn’t provide details of
the agreement.  A railway between the two African countries will be
completed by 2012, SUNA said, citing al-Sheikh. The railway will
stretch from Nyala, the capital of Sudan’s South Darfur state,
across the border into Chad, it said.  Chad will extend the line to reach into Cameroon, the
agency said, without providing a timeline for the extension.
Sudan and Chad agreed on July 29 to establish a joint oil
venture, Sudanese state-run SMC news agency reported July 30.  To contact the reporter on this story:
