Telecom Egypt (ETEL) , the Arab nation’s
fixed-line telephone monopoly, said second-quarter profit fell
11 percent because of the disruptive effect of the revolution in
February.  Net income declined to 826.4 million Egyptian pounds
($138.7 million), or 0.48 pounds per share, from 926.3 million
pounds, or 0.54 pounds per share, a year earlier, the Cairo-
based company said in a statement on its website today.  The median estimate of five analysts was for a profit of
831 million pounds, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
Revenue fell 0.8 percent to 2.61 billion pounds from 2.63
billion pounds. Total fixed-line subscribers stood at 9 million
at the end of June the company said.  “While the immediate effects of the Egyptian revolution
started to subside during the quarter, the prevailing operating
environment has yet to normalize in  Egypt ,” Chairman Akil
Bashir said in the statement. “Government curfews were fully
lifted in mid June, but tourism levels and business activities
remain low and we continue to experience higher levels of copper
cable theft than would be the case under normal conditions.”  Shares of Telecom Egypt rose 0.1 percent yesterday to 14.9
Egyptian pounds, valuing the company at 25.4 billion pounds.  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
