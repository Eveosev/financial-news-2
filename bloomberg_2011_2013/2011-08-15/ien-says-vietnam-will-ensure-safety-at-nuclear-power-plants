Le Dinh Tien,  Vietnam ’s deputy
minister of science and technology, said the country considers
safety a priority in its nuclear energy development following
the disaster in  Japan  earlier this year.  Tien was commenting in Hanoi today on the challenges that
the Southeast Asian nation may face when implementing its first
nuclear projects.  On Vietnam’s nuclear plans:  “We already have investors for the first nuclear power
plants and we will still go ahead with our plan in building
those projects.  “We are now in the preparation process with Japanese and
Russian partners to sign feasibility studies, preparing to
choose consultants for the projects.  “For Vietnam, since this is the first time we are building
nuclear  power plants , we are facing a lot of challenges in all
aspects, from human resources to infrastructure, from legal
issues to setting safety standards.”  On Safety standards:  “After the breakdown at the nuclear plant in Japan, the
international community has discussed and taken steps to raise
safety standards at nuclear power plants. In Vietnam, safety
will also be one of the most important factors during
construction.  “We hope that when the first two nuclear power plants are
put into operation, they will meet about 4.5 percent of total
electricity demand.  “We will start construction of the first nuclear plant in
2014 which will have two turbines with capacity of 2,000
megawatts. The second one will also be implemented after that,
with the same capacity.”  --Nguyen Kieu Giang in Hanoi. Editor: Ryan Woo.  To contact the Bloomberg News staff on this story:
