Tropical Storm Gert, bearing winds
of 60 miles per hour (97 kilometers per hour), is forecast to
brush past the shores of  Bermuda  today, causing heavy rain and
high ocean surf, the U.S. National Hurricane Center said.  The storm is about 100 miles southeast of Bermuda, moving
north at 14 miles an hour, the Miami-based center said in an
 advisory  at 9 a.m. Bermuda time. “A turn toward the north-
northeast and an increase in forward speed are expected in the
next couple of days,” the center said.  Gert is the seventh named storm of the  Atlantic hurricane
season , which began June 1 and ends Nov. 30. None of the storms
have become hurricanes so far. From 1966 to 2009 there were on
average 11.3 named storms, 6.2 of which became hurricanes,
according to the  NHC website .  The storm may drop as much as 3 inches (7.6 centimeters) of
rain on Bermuda and large swells could cause “life-threatening
surf and rip current conditions,” the center said.  The NHC also signaled that a tropical wave, 325 miles east
of the Lesser Antilles, is producing a “large area of
cloudiness and thunderstorms” and will cause heavy rain and
winds over the central and northern Lesser Antilles today and
tomorrow. There’s a 10 percent chance of it forming a tropical
cyclone as it moves west at 15 to 20 miles an hour.  To contact the reporter on this story:
