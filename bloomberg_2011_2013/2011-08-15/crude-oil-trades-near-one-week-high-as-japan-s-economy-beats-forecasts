Oil traded near its highest in a
week as advancing U.S. equity futures and better-than-forecast
economic data from  Japan  allayed concerns that the global
recovery has faded.  Futures rose as much as 0.8 percent in London and 0.5
percent in  New York  after falling in each of the past three
weeks. Japan’s economy shrank at an annualized 1.3 percent rate
in the second quarter, compared with the median forecast for a
2.5 percent drop in a Bloomberg News survey of 25 economists.
Reports this week may show the U.S. housing industry remained
depressed in July and European growth eased last quarter.  “The market is continuing to hold in the wider range,
still seeking to consolidate after heavy losses in August,”
said  Andrey Kryuchenkov , an analyst at VTB Capital in  London .
“It’s unlikely we’ll see a pronounced rebound in crude prices
here as fears over a global economic slowdown are still rife.”  Crude for September delivery gained as much as 44 cents to
$85.82 a barrel and was at $85.69 on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange  at 1:24 p.m. London time. Brent oil for September
settlement was at $108.25, up 22 cents, after rising as high as
$108.80 a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures  Europe .  The European benchmark was at a premium of $22.56 to U.S.
futures, compared with a record close of $23.79 on Aug. 10.  U.S. stock-index futures gained, indicating the Standard &
Poor’s 500 Index may climb after three weeks of losses dragged
the gauge to near its cheapest level compared with earnings in
more than two years.  Brent Long Positions  Speculative bets that Brent will rise, in futures and
options combined, outnumbered short positions by 95,871
contracts, the London-based exchange said today in its weekly
Commitment of Traders report. Net-long positions fell by 47,019
contracts from 95,871 a week earlier.  Tropical Storm Gert is expected to pass near  Bermuda  today.
The storm is about 105 miles (170 kilometers) southeast of the
Caribbean island and moving north at 14 miles per hour. It has
maximum sustained winds of 60 mph, the Miami-based center said
in an advisory issued at 5 a.m. Bermuda time, and these extend
up to 70 miles, mostly to the north and east.  Hedge funds  cut bullish bets on New York crude to the
lowest level in more than eight months in the week ended Aug. 9,
according to a report last week. The funds and other large
speculators reduced their net-long positions, or wagers that
prices will rise, by 11 percent, according to the Commodity
Futures Trading Commission’s weekly Commitments of Traders
report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
