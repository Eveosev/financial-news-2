U.S. stocks rose, erasing last
week’s drop, as $21.5 billion in takeovers and valuations near
the cheapest level in two years helped the Standard & Poor’s 500
Index extend its best three-day rally since 2009.  Motorola Mobility Holdings Inc. soared 56 percent as  Google
Inc. (GOOG)  agreed to buy the company for about $12.5 billion in cash.
 Bank of America Corp. (BAC)  rallied 7.9 percent on plans to exit the
international credit-card business by selling its $8.6 billion
card business in Canada to TD Bank Group and leaving the U.K.
and Irish markets.  Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM)  advanced 3.2 percent,
pacing gains in energy companies, as oil climbed.  The  S&P 500  added 2.2 percent to 1,204.49 at 4 p.m. in New
York and was up 7.5 percent in three days. The gauge traded at
12.9 times reported earnings on Aug. 12, near the lowest
valuation level since 2009. The  Dow Jones Industrial Average 
climbed 213.88 points, or 1.9 percent, to 11,482.90.  “We’ve been putting money back in the equity market,”
 Jeffrey Saut , chief investment strategist at Raymond James &
Associates in  St. Petersburg , Florida, said in a telephone
interview. His firm manages $275 billion. “You’re dealing with
oversold levels. I do expect to see more takeover deals. If we
don’t go into a recession, we’ve made a low for the year. All
the ingredients are there for some kind of bottom.”  The S&P 500 fell 18 percent from the end of April through
this year’s low on Aug. 8, when the index closed at 1,119.46.
More than $2 trillion was erased from U.S. equity values in the
last three weeks amid  Europe ’s debt crisis, signs the economy is
slowing and S&P’s downgrade of the government’s credit rating.  ‘Not Out of Bullets’  Benchmark gauges also rose after  Federal Reserve  Bank of
Atlanta President  Dennis Lockhart  said the central bank could
purchase more Treasuries or alter its balance sheet if the  U.S.
economy  were to slow further. “If additional actions are
required, I can assure you the Federal Reserve is not out of
bullets,” Lockhart said today in a speech in Florence, Alabama.  Fed Chairman Ben S. Bernanke and his policy-making
colleagues pledged on Aug. 9 to hold the main  interest rate  at a
record low near zero at least until mid-2013, saying economic
growth is “considerably slower” than anticipated. Treasuries
dropped today after a three-week rally in  government bonds  that
pushed 10- and two-year note yields to record lows.  “The market is reacting to the relative attractiveness of
stocks to bonds,”  Jack Ablin , chief investment officer for
Chicago-based Harris Private Bank, which oversees $60 billion,
said in a telephone interview. “Investors are seeing that
company managements are still pretty aggressive with these high-
profile acquisitions. It suggests that if management is
optimistic, we can be optimistic.”  Motorola Mobility Soars  Motorola Mobility soared 56 percent to $38.12. Motorola
shareholders will get $40 a share in cash, the company and
Google said in a statement today. That’s 63 percent more than
Motorola Mobility’s closing price on the  New York  Stock Exchange
on Aug. 12. Both boards have approved the deal. Google shares
dropped 1.2 percent to $557.23.  Bank of America rallied 7.9 percent to $7.76, driving
financial stocks higher. The TD Bank transaction is expected to
close in the fourth quarter and boost Tier 1 common and tangible
common equity ratios, the company said.  Chief Executive Officer  Brian T. Moynihan  is focusing on
retail-banking customers, commercial borrowers and investment
banking, and getting rid of unrelated assets to raise capital.
The Charlotte, North Carolina-based company, which took a $45
billion government bailout during the financial crisis, has
struck deals to sell an insurance unit and mortgage-servicing
rights. Bank of America sold its $200 million portfolio of
small-business card loans to Barclays Plc in April.  Banks Rally  Other banks climbed.  JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM)  added 2.7 percent
to $36.88, while Citigroup Inc. jumped 4.8 percent to $31.27.
The KBW Bank Index advanced 4.2 percent as all of its 24 stocks
gained.  Time Warner Cable Inc. (TWC)  fell 0.8 percent to $65.02. The
second-largest U.S. cable-television operator agreed to buy
Carlyle Group’s Insight Communications Co. for $3 billion in
cash to gain customers in the Midwest. The deal may generate
cost savings of $100 million within two years, Time Warner Cable
said in a statement today.  “Companies have a lot of cash and they are taking
advantage of the great valuation out there in what they see as a
still good earnings environment,” New York-based Kevin Shacknofsky, who helps manage about $6 billion for Alpine Mutual
Funds, said in a telephone interview. “If it happens to a great
degree, it will be very beneficial for the market. It will be a
strong catalyst.”  Energy Shares  Energy shares had the second-biggest gain within 10
industries in the S&P 500, rising 3.4 percent as a group. Exxon
Mobil advanced 3.2 percent to $74.29.  Chevron Corp. (CVX)  increased
3.4 percent to $99.10.    Visa Inc. (V)  added 2.4 percent to $85.87 as the biggest
payments network was added to the “Conviction Buy” list at
Goldman Sachs Group Inc.  The Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility Index, which
measures the cost of using options as insurance against declines
in the S&P 500, tumbled 12 percent to 31.87. The index has
fallen 26 percent in three days, the biggest drop since March
21.  Stocks rose today even after a report showed that
manufacturing in the New York region contracted for a third
straight month in August as orders and inventories dropped. The
Federal Reserve Bank of New York’s general economic index fell
to minus 7.7 from minus 3.8 in July, a report showed today. The
median forecast in a Bloomberg survey called for a reading of
zero, the dividing line between expansion and contraction.  To contact the reporter on this story:
