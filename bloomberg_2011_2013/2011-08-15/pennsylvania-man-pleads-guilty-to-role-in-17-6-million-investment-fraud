A  Pennsylvania  man admitted to his
role in a $17.6 million  Ponzi scheme  that defrauded more than
260 investors.  Robert Stinson Jr., 56, of Berwyn, pleaded guilty in
federal court in Philadelphia today to 26 charges, including
wire fraud, mail fraud,  money laundering  and bank fraud, the
 Justice Department  said in a statement. There was no plea
agreement, according to the plea memorandum.  Stinson was charged in November, accused of lying about his
education and promising returns of 10 percent to 16 percent from
real estate hedge funds. He allegedly told investors that the
funds made short-term commercial mortgage loans, while he used
the money to pay himself and relatives and to buy expensive cars
and vacations, according to an indictment.  He falsely claimed to have degrees from the  Massachusetts
Institute of Technology  and Pennsylvania State University and
concocted a long history of employment in currency trading and
investment management, prosecutors said. In reality, he had been
convicted of fraud multiple times, they said.  The charges carry a maximum penalty of 329 years in prison
and a $6.8 million fine. His sentencing is scheduled for Dec. 13
before U.S. District Judge Michael M. Baylson in Philadelphia.
Non-binding federal guidelines call for a term of 324 to 405
months in prison, prosecutors said.  The case is U.S. vs. Stinson, 10-cr-00724; a related
lawsuit is Securities and Exchange Commission v. Stinson, 2:10-
cv-3130, both in U.S. District Court, Eastern District of
Pennsylvania (Philadelphia).  To contact the reporter on this story:
