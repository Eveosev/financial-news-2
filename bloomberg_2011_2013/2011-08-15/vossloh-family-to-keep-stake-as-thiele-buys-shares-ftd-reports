The Vossloh family plans to keep its
31 percent stake in  Vossloh AG (VOS)  as Heinz Hermann Thiele boosts
his investment in a possible bid to merge the railroad-equipment
maker with his company,  Financial Times Deutschland said .  Thiele, who controls brake-systems maker Knorr-Bremse AG,
probably wants to raise his stake in Werdohl, Germany-based
Vossloh to at least 25 percent from 15 percent, the newspaper
said, citing a cartel office filing. The Vossloh family plans to
maintain its stake, FTD said, citing spokesman Peter Langenbach.  Thiele may want to merge Munich-based Knorr-Bremse with
Vossloh, building a company with more than 5 billion euros ($7.2
billion) in annual sales, FTD said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
