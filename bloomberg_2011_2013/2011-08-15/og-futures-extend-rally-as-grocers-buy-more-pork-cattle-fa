Hog futures rose, capping the
longest rally in more than a month, on signs that U.S. grocers
are buying more pork in preparation for the Labor Day holiday on
Sept. 5. Cattle declined.  Wholesale pork gained 0.9 percent last week, climbing to a
record $1.1019 a pound on Aug. 8, U.S. Department of Agriculture
data show. On Aug. 11, the government lowered its estimate of
pork production for next year.  “We usually see buying three weeks ahead of time for these
holidays,”  Rich Nelson , the director of research at Allendale
Inc. in McHenry,  Illinois , said in a telephone interview. “We
are seeing supplies tighten more than people were expecting.”  Hog futures for October settlement gained 0.5 cent, or 0.6
percent, to close at 89.975 cents a pound at 1:12 p.m. on the
 Chicago  Mercantile Exchange, rising for the third straight
session, the longest rally since July 7. The most-active
contract has advanced 21 percent in the past year.  Labor Day is the second-most popular day for barbecues,
with 75 percent of U.S. grillers cooking out, a National
Cattlemen’s Beef Association  study  found.  Independence Day  ranks
No. 1.  Cattle futures for October delivery fell 0.35 cent, or 0.3
percent, to settle at $1.201 a pound on the CME. The commodity
has jumped 26 percent in the past 12 months.  Wholesale beef climbed to $1.8113 a pound, the highest
since July 14. Cash prices gained because animals weigh less on
average in the summer heat,  Don Roose , the president of U.S.
Commodities Inc. in  West Des Moines , Iowa, said by telephone.  Recently, “temperatures have moderated quite a bit in the
Corn Belt, and that’s going to add a bit of tonnage,” he said.  Feeder-cattle futures for October settlement gained 0.375
cent, or 0.3 percent, to close at $1.39075 a pound in Chicago.  To contact the reporter on this story:
