8.7 percent in July as demand rose.  The nation bought 2.25 million metric tons of LNG compared
with 2.07 million tons a year earlier, according to data on the
Korea Customs Service’s  website  today. The country paid $1.57
billion, or $694.7 a ton, compared with $1.13 billion, or
$547.41 a ton, a year earlier, the data show.  South Korea purchased 108,058 tons in the spot market at an
