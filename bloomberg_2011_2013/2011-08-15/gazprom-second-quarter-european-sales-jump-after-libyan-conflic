OAO Gazprom said natural-gas sales
in  Europe  increased 20 percent in the second quarter after
Libya’s supply disruptions boosted demand for the Russian fuel.  Gazprom sold 38.3 billion cubic meters of gas to Western
and central European customers, the Moscow-based gas export
monopoly said today in a second-quarter report on its website.
Sales in the same period of 2010 amounted to 31.8 billion cubic
meters.  The company, which supplies about a quarter of Europe’s
gas, benefited as unrest in Libya caused Italian importers to
turn to  Russia  for their supplies. Demand for Russian fuel has
been climbing this year at an increasing pace compared with a
year earlier, Chief Executive Officer  Alexei Miller  said in May.  Italy, whose imports from  Libya  halted because of conflict
in the North African country, bought 4.15 billion cubic meters
from Gazprom, an increase of 179 percent from the 1.49 billion
cubic meters purchased in the same period a year earlier.  Sales volumes to Europe fell 13 percent compared with the
first quarter, according to the statement.  To contact the reporters on this story:
