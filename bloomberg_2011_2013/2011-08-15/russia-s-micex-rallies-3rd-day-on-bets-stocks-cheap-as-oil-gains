Russian stocks rallied as oil
climbed and the steepest weekly drop in a year left shares near
the lowest level relative to earnings since February 2009. OAO
Surgutneftegas, an oil producer, rose to its highest since
January after first-half profit jumped.  The Micex Index gained 2.7 percent to 1,510.69 by the 6:45
p.m. close in Moscow. Surgutneftegas surged 5.4 percent, while
Transneft, the country’s oil pipeline monopoly operator, rose
4.7 percent. Of the 30 stocks in the gauge 29 advanced while one
fell. The dollar-denominated RTS Index rallied 3.8 percent to
1,655.03, its biggest gain in more than two months.  Global equity markets sank last week and the Micex tumbled
7.3 percent on concern the  U.S. economy  is slowing and the
European debt crisis is worsening. The gauge has dropped 11
percent this year, and currently trades at 4.5 times earnings.
That compares with a 21 percent slide for  Brazil ’s Bovespa
Index, which trades at 8.2 times earnings, data compiled by
Bloomberg show.  “Things are simply oversold,” Peter Westin, chief
strategist at Aton Capital in Moscow, said by phone. “It’s not
a dead cat bounce, nor are we seeing the signs of a recovery.”  Investors withdrew $412 million from Russia-focused equity
funds in the week to Aug. 10 as concern increased the recovery
will slow, according to data from EPFR Global, a Cambridge,
Massachusetts-based researcher. That was the biggest outflow
since May 2006,  Brad Durham , an EPFR managing director, said by
phone Aug. 12.  India ’s benchmark Sensex measure, which trades at 15 times
earnings, slid 18 percent since the start of the year, while
 China ’s Shanghai Composite, which trades at a multiple of 14.3,
fell 6.5 percent.  ‘Transient’  Rostelecom, Russia’s dominant fixed-line phone operator,
jumped 10 percent to 161.59 rubles, extending a 15 percent jump
on Aug. 12 and paring the stock’s 37 percent decline from the
start of the month through Aug. 11.  Surgutneftegas, the country’s fourth-largest oil producer,
rose after reporting first-half net income jumped 39 percent to
77.8 billion rubles ($2.7 billion) under Russian accounting
standards. Crude oil traded in  New York  averaged $98.45 a barrel
in the first six months of the year, compared with an average
$78.47 a year earlier. The higher prices pushed sales in the
period up 38 percent to 381.3 billion rubles, the company said.  Oil, which along with natural gas accounts for 17 percent
of  Russia ’s gross domestic product, erased earlier losses,
advancing 1.5 percent to $86.86 a barrel in New York.  “We can’t be confident about this transient recovery,”
Andrei Kuznetsov, an equity strategist at Citigroup Inc., said
by phone in Moscow. “The recent selloff shows investors have
lost confidence in global growth and nothing has been said or
published to show global recovery is bouncing back.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
