Bruce Berkowitz , founder of
Fairholme Capital Management LLC, added to his stake in  Bank of
America Corp. (BAC)  in the second quarter, while selling all of his
 Cisco Systems Inc. (CSCO)  holdings.  Berkowitz, who is betting on a rebound in financial stocks,
bought 7 million new shares of Charlotte, North Carolina-based
Bank of America, bringing his holdings to 100 million shares,
according to a document filed today with the U.S. Securities and
Exchange Commission. Bank of America’s stock has declined 21
percent since the beginning of August. The fund also bought
544,000 of shares of Citigroup Inc., increasing its position to
26 million shares.  The value of Fairholme’s stakes in financial stocks rose
8.2 percent in the quarter, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. Financial stocks make up 91 percent of its holdings.  Berkowitz sold 36 million shares of San Jose, California-
based Cisco, his entire stake, which he purchased in the first
quarter. He also pared his stakes in  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) 
and  Morgan Stanley. (MS)   Berkowitz hosted an open conference call with Bank of
America CEO Brian T. Moynihan on Aug. 10 in an effort to
reassure investors in his Fairholme family of mutual funds that
he hasn’t lost his touch after being named the U.S. domestic
stock fund manager of the decade last year by Chicago-based
Morningstar Inc.  Berkowitz’s flagship  Fairholme Fund (FAIRX)  dropped 25 percent this
year through Aug. 12.  To contact the reporter on this story:
