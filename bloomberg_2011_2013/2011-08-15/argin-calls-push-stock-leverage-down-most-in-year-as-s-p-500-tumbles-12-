Investor credit at Wall Street
brokerages is falling by the most in a year as the Standard &
Poor’s 500 Index suffers its biggest losses since the bull
market began.  Borrowed money in accounts at 61  New York  Stock Exchange
firms has fallen 4.6 percent, the biggest drop since June 2010,
according to a July 22 statement from New York-based NYSE
Euronext. The decline at NYSE firms followed a 36 percent
increase to $320.7 billion in eight months, the biggest
expansion since 2007. Leverage slipped to the lowest level of
2011 last week, according to Morgan Stanley’s prime brokerage.  Lenders have been calling in loans since April, when the
benchmark gauge for American equities began a plunge that has
wiped out more than $2 trillion in value. While withdrawals
preceded bear markets in the past and may worsen losses by
leaving investors with less money to spend, they foreshadowed a
return to the market by  hedge funds  and other speculators after
the European credit crisis receded in August 2010.  “We cut leverage through the course of the year, keeping
it as minimal as possible,” Brian Jacobsen, who helps oversee
$228 billion in 118 mutual funds as chief portfolio strategist
at Wells Fargo Advantage Funds in Menomonee Falls,  Wisconsin ,
said in an Aug. 12 telephone interview. “People tend to lever
up in bull markets. When you look at risks in these markets,
when there’s more downside risk than upside in the short term,
people don’t want to amplify losses.”  Debt Downgrade  The S&P 500 has declined 12 percent from July 22 through
Aug. 15, falling 6.7 percent on Aug. 8, its biggest drop since
the 2008 crisis, as investors sold stocks from  Bank of America
Corp. (BAC)  to Chemtura Corp. on signs the economy is faltering. The
selloff deepened as S&P downgraded the U.S. government’s long-
term debt to AA+, conflicting with Moody’s Investors Service and
Fitch Ratings, which reaffirmed the highest rating on
Treasuries.  Billionaire  Warren Buffett  said on Aug. 6 that the U.S.
merits a “quadruple A” rating and the country isn’t facing a
double-dip recession. Treasuries gained last week, pushing 10-
year yields down the most since 2008, after the  Federal Reserve 
pledged to keep the target rate for overnight loans between
banks close to zero through at least the middle of 2013.  Stock swings were among the widest on record last week,
even though the  S&P 500  only fell 1.7 percent. The  Dow Jones
Industrial Average  alternated between gains and losses of more
than 400 points for four days in a row, the longest streak ever.
The S&P 500 closed as low as 1,119.46 on Aug. 8, within 29
points of a bear market, or a 20 percent drop.  France ,  Italy ,
 Spain  and  Belgium  enacted bans on short selling or on short
positions last week.  Hedge Funds  The S&P 500 rose 2.2 percent to 1,204.49 at 4 p.m. in New
York today. The gauge closed at 1,178.81 last week.  Net hedge-fund leverage slumped to its lowest point this
year at 49 percent of balances as of Aug. 10, according to an
Aug. 12 note from Morgan Stanley’s prime brokerage, which was
sent to Bloomberg by a client of the bank who asked not to be
identified for reasons of privacy. Last year, it reached its
lowest point on Aug. 31 at 41 percent, data from the New York-
based company show. Mary Claire Delaney, a spokeswoman for
Morgan Stanley, declined to comment.  “It’s all part of the avoidance-of-risk trade,”  Uri Landesman , who helps oversee $1 billion as managing general
partner of New York-based hedge fund Platinum Partners LLP, said
in a telephone interview Aug. 12. Landesman said leverage was
reduced in his fund as the value of securities dropped. “People
are dumping equities, emerging market equities, things seen as
risk assets, and alongside with that we’re seeing leverage being
taken down.”  Record High  Margin debt at NYSE firms peaked in July 2007 at $381.4
billion, a 41 percent increase from the level in November 2006.
The S&P 500 reached its record high of 1,565.15 on Oct. 9, 2007,
then tumbled 57 percent through March 2009. Margin debt climbed
to its previous high of $278.5 billion in March 2000. The S&P
500 also peaked at a record that month before entering a bear
market in which it lost 49 percent through October 2002, data
compiled by Bloomberg show.  “The high this year was within two weeks of this number,
so it does tell us something,”  Mike Shea , a managing partner
and trader at Direct Access Partners LLC in New York, said in an
Aug. 9 telephone interview. “Smart money started selling the
market at its high and taking risk off the table, and the market
chopped along a little more for June and July before following
through to the downside.”  Still Bullish  Institutional investors expect leverage to decrease this
year. Seventy-eight percent of investment managers said hedge
funds will use “significantly less leverage now than prior to
the 2008 credit crisis,” up from 70 percent a year earlier,
according to an April report by Rothstein Kass, a Roseland, New
Jersey-based adviser to alternative investment companies.  To Laszlo Birinyi, president of Birinyi Associates Inc. in
Westport,  Connecticut , investor sentiment eroded because of the
debate over raising the debt ceiling and the decline of the past
15 days has gone too far because earnings are still rising. S&P
500 profits may increase 17 percent to $99.24 a share in 2011
and 14 percent to $113.11 in 2012, analyst estimates show.11  “While this is painful to me, it’s just a correction, it’s
being saturated by political circumstances and unfortunately
political circumstances create emotion and emotion creates
volatility,” Birinyi, one of the first investors to recommend
buying when the bull market began in March 2009, said in an Aug.
12 Bloomberg Television interview. “But I think the market
situation is much more reminiscent of a 10 percent decline, not
too dissimilar from what we had last May and June. I’m not of
the belief that the bull market is over.”  European Crisis  Artemis Wealth Advisors LLC’s Peter Rup said the decline in
margin shows professional investors are protecting clients’
money, not bailing out of stocks. The S&P 500 will rally because
companies have record capital and earnings are growing, he said.  Margin debt fell by a similar amount in April through June
2010 as concern rose the European debt crisis would spread and
the S&P 500 tumbled 16 percent between April and July. The index
reversed itself and gained as much as 30 percent after Fed
Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  signaled Aug. 27 that the central bank
would buy Treasury bonds to stimulate the economy and boost
asset prices.  Chemtura, Valeant  “It could be an indicator of participation in the market
and capital preservation, people just don’t want the risk,”
Rup, chief investment officer at the New York-based firm that
invests in hedge funds on behalf of clients, said in an Aug. 10
telephone interview. “Once this fear subsides, I would expect
the equity market to very rapidly recoup all of its losses.”  Hedge fund managers sold a net 3.68 million shares of
Chemtura, the Philadelphia-based maker of specialty and farm
chemicals, last quarter, according to regulatory filings
compiled by Bloomberg. The stock is down 24 percent in the past
three weeks. They sold 5.9 million shares of Mississauga,
Ontario-based  Valeant Pharmaceuticals International Inc. (VRX) , which
has dropped the second-most among the 51 companies in a Goldman
Sachs Group Inc. index of stocks with the biggest hedge fund
ownership.  Analysts are starting to revisit earnings estimates for
banks after the Fed said last week the economy is slowing more
than it anticipated. Charlotte, North Carolina-based Bank of
America had its earnings estimates cut last week by
International Strategy & Investment Group Inc., which predicted
a “revenue recession” for lenders.  Selling Stock  The largest  U.S. bank  has the biggest loss since July 22 in
the Goldman Sachs index. Hedge funds sold more than 13.2 million
shares in the second quarter, filings compiled by Bloomberg
show.  Economists estimate U.S. GDP will rise 1.8 percent in 2011,
down from forecasts of 3.2 percent the month before margin debt
peaked, according to the median projection of respondents in a
Bloomberg survey. The country expanded at a 3 percent rate in
2010, Commerce Department data show. The Fed damped its forecast
on Aug. 9, saying disruptions caused by  Japan ’s earthquake and
tsunami did not account for all of the slowdown.  Stocks have lost about 35 percent in bear markets since
1966 with the average decline lasting about 413 days, according
to data compiled by Birinyi and Bloomberg. The worst bear market
since the Great Depression was the 2008 crisis. The last U.S.
 recession  began in December 2007 and lasted through June 2009.
The S&P 500 is down 14 percent since April 29.  “In environments like this not only do investors pull in,
but also lenders get skittish as well,”  Lawrence Creatura , a
Rochester, New York-based fund manager at Federated Investors
Inc., said in an Aug. 11 telephone interview. His firm oversees
about $350 billion. “We will come back from this, but it’s not
entirely clear that this is over yet. The amount of investor
discomfort has not been large enough to cause raw fear yet. It
doesn’t feel like the weaker hands have been cleared out.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
