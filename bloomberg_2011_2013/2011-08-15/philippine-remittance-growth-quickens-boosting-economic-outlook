Remittances sent home by Philippine
citizens overseas rose at a faster pace in June, helping sustain
 consumer spending  and economic growth.  Money sent from abroad increased 7 percent to $1.737
billion from a year earlier, the  central bank  said in a
statement in Manila today. The funds grew 6.9 percent in May,
according to previously reported data.  Remittances make up about a 10th of the Philippines’ $200
billion economy and are the nation’s largest source of foreign
exchange after exports. Funds from the more than 8 million
Filipinos living in countries from the U.S. to  Saudi Arabia  have
boosted consumer purchases locally, helping lift earnings at San
Miguel Corp. and  Ayala Land Inc. (ALI)   “Remittances remain resilient despite the crisis in the
Middle East and suggest consumer demand, and probably economic
growth, will remain strong,”  Jonathan Ravelas , chief market
strategist at Banco de Oro Unibank Inc. in Manila, said before
the report.  Street demonstrations toppled the leaders of Tunisia and
Egypt this year, and more than 2,400 people have been killed
since the uprising against Syrian President Bashar al-Assad’s
government began in March, according to the National
Organization for Human Rights in Syria.  To contact the reporter on this story:
