Gold declined for a third day in New
York as gains in equity markets tempered concerns that economic
growth is slowing, reducing demand for the metal as a protection
of wealth.  The MSCI All-Country World Index of equities climbed for a
third day after a report showed  Japan ’s economy shrank less than
forecast. U.S. retail sales rose the most in four months in
July, while applications for jobless benefits were the lowest
since April, reports showed last week. Gold futures touched a
record $1,817.60 an ounce on Aug. 11.  “Given the return of some risk appetite and the influx of
bargain-hunters into the equity markets, gold seems likely to
face further pressure in the coming sessions,”  James Moore , an
analyst at TheBullionDesk.com in  London , wrote in a report.
Still, “we expect the dip-buying mentality to continue, with
gold remaining underpinned by investment demand.”  Gold for December delivery fell $6.70, or 0.4 percent, to
$1,735.90 an ounce by 8:08 a.m. on the Comex in New York.
Immediate-delivery gold was down 0.7 percent at $1,735.45 in
London.  CME Group Inc. (CME) , the largest futures market, hiked margins
on gold contracts, or the minimum amount of cash speculators
must keep on deposit, by 22 percent from the close of trade on
Aug. 11. Global equities dropped to the lowest level since
September last week as  Standard & Poor’s  lowered its  credit
rating  for the U.S. from AAA, stoking concern the global
economic recovery may be at risk.  Gold’s Gain  Gold is up 22 percent this year, heading for an 11th
straight annual gain, the longest winning streak since at least
1920 in London. The MSCI All-Country World Index fell 8.1
percent this year, the Standard & Poor’s GSCI Index of 24
commodities rose 1.9 percent, while Treasuries returned 6.7
percent in 2011, a Bank of America Merrill Lynch index showed.  Demand for gold as a haven and last week’s drop in equities
pushed bullion’s ratio to the  S&P 500 index  to the highest level
since at least 1992, data compiled by Bloomberg show. The level,
calculated by dividing an ounce of gold by the index, reached
1.6 on Aug. 10 and has averaged 1.1 so far this year.  The “uncertainty in financial markets, whether from the
growth outlook or the ongoing sovereign-debt crisis, is expected
to remain a benefit to perceived safe-haven commodity assets, of
which we believe gold is the standout,” Morgan Stanley analysts
led by  Hussein Allidina  said in a report today.  Coin Sales  The U.S. Mint’s American Eagle gold-coin sales are 55,500
ounces so far in August, according to figures on the mint’s
website. Sales are heading for the best month since January,
when the total was 133,500 ounces, according to the figures.  Holdings of the metal in exchange-traded products fell for
a second day on Aug. 12, declining 3.8 metric tons to 2,182.1
tons, data compiled by Bloomberg show. Assets reached a record
2,216.8 tons on Aug. 8.  Richard Nixon , the former U.S. president, abandoned the
gold standard 40 years ago today. Between 1968 and 1971, the
metal and the dollar were officially exchanged at a fixed rate
after the system had tied gold at about $35, according to the
World Gold Council.  The system “was devised precisely to prevent the sort of
economic conditions that we suffer today,” Ross Norman, chief
executive officer of Sharps Pixley Ltd., a London-based bullion
brokerage, said in an Aug. 12 e-mail. “The solution to today’s
problems is not, in my opinion to head back down the yellow
brick road and reintroduce a gold standard. The gold market is
insufficiently large to sensibly play that role by itself.”  Silver for September delivery in  New York  rose 0.1 percent
to $39.16 an ounce. Palladium for September delivery gained 1
percent to $756 an ounce. Platinum for October delivery was
little changed at $1,797.70 an ounce.  To contact the reporters for this story:
