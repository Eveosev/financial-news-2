Peru’s benchmark borrowing costs in
dollars fell to a one-week low as concern eased that  Europe ’s
fiscal crisis may worsen, boosting demand for higher-yielding
assets.  The extra yield investors demand to own Peruvian government
bonds instead of U.S. Treasuries fell 12 basis points, or 0.12
percentage point, to 204 at 11:43 a.m. New York time, according
to JPMorgan Chase & Co.  European stocks tumbled last week amid speculation that the
region’s government-debt crisis will spread to France, and after
 Standard & Poor’s  downgraded the U.S. credit rating. European
stocks rose today.  “Over the weekend there was an absence of bad news, so for
the time being the market is passing by this risk of a downgrade
to France,” said Bret Rosen, a Latin America debt strategist at
Standard Chartered Bank in  New York . “The market is more
disposed to taking on risk.”  Peru’s sol was little changed at 2.7422 per U.S dollar,
from 2.7430 on Aug. 12.  To contact the reporter on this story:
