India ’s Malabar Cements Ltd. is
seeking to import 40,000 metric tons of power-plant coal through
a tender, according to a document on the company’s  website .
Suppliers must submit their offers by Sept. 2.  The imported coal must be of South African or Chinese
origin with a minimum gross calorific value of 6,300
kilocalories per kilogram, a maximum total moisture content of
12 percent, maximum ash content of 15 percent and maximum sulfur
content of 1 percent, according to the document. Deliveries of
7,000 to 7,500 tons should start in October and be completed by
