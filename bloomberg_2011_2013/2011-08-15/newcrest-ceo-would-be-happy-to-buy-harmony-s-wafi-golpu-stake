Newcrest Mining Ltd. (NCM) , the world’s
third largest gold mining company by market value, said the
company would acquire Harmony Gold Mining Co.’s 50 percent stake
in the A$4 billion ($4.2 billion) Wafi-Golpu joint venture if it
was for sale.  “If they wanted to sell it we’d be happy to buy it,” Greg Robinson, chief executive officer of Melbourne-based Newcrest
told reporters today on a conference call. Newcrest hasn’t had
any recent talks with Harmony about a potential sale, he said.  Newcrest expects the gold-copper project in  Papua New
Guinea  to produce 600,000 to 800,000 ounces of gold and 300,000
to 500,000 metric tons of copper, it said in a presentation
accompanying its full-year results. Production may start in 2017
with total construction costs estimated at A$4 billion, the
company said.  The company will pay its share of the project from  cash
flow  from its operations in  Australia ,  Indonesia , Papua New
Guinea and West Africa, Robinson said.  Newcrest reported a record second-half net profit of A$470
million in the six months to June 30, up 23 percent on the same
period last year, according to figures derived from full-year
earnings posted today and confirmed by the Melbourne-based
company. That compares with a forecast of A$523 million from
Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc.  Newcrest fell 1.5 percent to A$40.12 at 2:50 p.m. in Sydney
trading, trimming gains over the past twelve months to 14
percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
