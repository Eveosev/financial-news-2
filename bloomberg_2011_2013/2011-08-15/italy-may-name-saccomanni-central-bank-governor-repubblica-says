Italy’s Prime Minister  Silvio
Berlusconi  reached an agreement with Bank of Italy Governor
 Mario Draghi  to name Fabrizio Saccomanni as his successor to
lead the central bank,  La Repubblica  reported, without saying
how it obtained the information.  Saccomanni, director general at the Bank of Italy, would
replace Draghi in November when he becomes head of the European
Central Bank, the newspaper said. Spokesmen at the bank and the
government press office didn’t answer calls for comment today, a
holiday in Italy.  To contact the reporter on this story:
