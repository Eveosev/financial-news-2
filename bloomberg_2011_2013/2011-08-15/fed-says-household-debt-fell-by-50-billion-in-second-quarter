U.S.  household debt  declined by 0.4
percent in the second quarter as mortgage and home equity line
balances shrunk, according to a survey by the  Federal Reserve
Bank of New York .  Consumer indebtedness fell $50 billion from the end of
March to $11.4 trillion on June 30, according to a quarterly
report on household debt and credit released today by the
district bank. Households have cut debt by $1.08 trillion, or
8.6 percent, from its peak in the third quarter of 2008 as the
financial crisis escalated.  The  Federal Open Market Committee  said on Aug. 9 that
“recent weakness in economic activity” stems in part from
slack  consumer spending , and pledged to keep the benchmark
 interest rate  at a record low at least through mid-2013.  The household debt level was “essentially flat” and was
“basically a repeat of the previous quarter,” Andrew
Haughwout, vice president in the Research and Statistics Group
at the New York Fed, said in a statement today. In the first
quarter of 2011, households expanded their debt by 0.3 percent
for the first time in more than two years, the New York Fed said
in May.  “This is more evidence that the pace of consumer
deleveraging that began in late 2008 has slowed,” Haughwout
said.  $10 Billion Decline  Mortgage and home-equity line balances both fell by $20
billion, and non-real estate borrowings declined by $10 billion,
the survey showed.  Delinquency rates fell for the sixth straight quarter, with
9.9 percent of outstanding debt “in some stage of
delinquency,” down from 10.5 percent on March 31, according to
the survey. About 284,000 consumers showed new foreclosures on
their credit reports in the second quarter, 22.8 percent less
than in the first three months of the year, the report showed.  Credit card limits rose by $60 billion, or 2.1 percent, the
second straight quarterly increase, the  New York  Fed said.  The report is based on data compiled by the New York Fed’s
Consumer Credit Panel, a “nationally representative random
sample” from Equifax Inc. credit-report data, the statement
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
