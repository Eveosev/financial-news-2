Google Inc. (GOOG)  agreed to lease a four-
building office complex in  California ’s Silicon Valley as the
world’s largest Internet search company devotes more resources
to smartphones.  Google plans to occupy 715,500 square feet (66,500 square
meters) in the Technology Corners development in Sunnyvale,
California, near the junction of Highways 101 and 237, Cornish &
Carey Commercial Newmark Knight Frank said in a statement. The
broker represents landlord Jay Paul Co., which built the complex
in 2000.  Google today said it’s buying smartphone maker Motorola
Mobility Holdings Inc. in a $12.5 billion deal that would give
the company mobile patents and help it expand in the hardware
business. The Sunnyvale office complex, near Google’s
headquarters in  Mountain View , sits on about 27 acres (11
hectares) and can house almost 3,000 workers.  Office rents in Sunnyvale rose to $41.76 a square foot in
the second quarter, up 10 percent from a year earlier, as
technology companies stepped up leasing, according to Cornish &
Carey. Facebook Inc. in February agreed to lease about 1 million
square feet in Menlo Park, and Hewlett-Packard Co. in April
signed a deal for 394,000 square feet in Sunnyvale.  To contact the reporter on this story:
