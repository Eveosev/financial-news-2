Former  Optionable Inc. (OPBL)  Chief
Executive Officer Kevin Cassidy pleaded guilty to his role in a
scheme to hide millions of dollars in losses at the  Bank of
Montreal. (BMO)   Cassidy, 52, pleaded guilty today in  Manhattan  federal
court to one count of conspiracy to commit wire fraud. The judge
set a Dec. 15 sentencing date.  The case stems from C$680 million ($690.5 million) of
pretax commodity-trading losses the bank announced in April
2007. Those losses grew to C$853 million for the fiscal year,
paring profit by C$440 million. Cassidy was charged with fraud
in 2008 for helping a former trader at the bank conceal the
losses.  Cassidy, an ex- convict  who hid his criminal record, helped
former trader David Lee hide commodity losses from the bank to
win business for Optionable, a brokerage firm focusing on energy
derivatives, according to prosecutors.  Cassidy was sentenced to 30 months in prison for credit-card
fraud in 1997 and six months for income-tax evasion in 1993,
court records show.  The case is U.S. v. Cassidy, 08-CR-1101, U.S. District
Court, Southern District of  New York  (Manhattan).  To contact the reporters on this story:
