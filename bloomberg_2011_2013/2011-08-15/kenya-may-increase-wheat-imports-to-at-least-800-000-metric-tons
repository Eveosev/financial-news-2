Kenya may increase wheat imports to
at least 800,000 metric tons, according to Diamond Lalji,
chairman of the Cereal Millers Association.  Kenya usually imports 700,000 to 750,000 tons, Lalji said.
“We will have to import more than usual because local
production has been very low this year,” Lalji said.  Kenya is paying 3,300 shillings ($35.42) for 90 kilograms
(198.4 pounds), according to the chairman.  To contact the reporter on this story:
