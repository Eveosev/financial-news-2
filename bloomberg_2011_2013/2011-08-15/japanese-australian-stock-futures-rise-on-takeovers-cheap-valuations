Japanese and Australian stock
futures rose as global markets rebounded amid increasing
corporate takeovers, rising commodity prices and reduced
valuations that investors say make stocks from New York to
London and Tokyo “cheap.”  American depositary receipts of  Sony Corp. (6758) , a Japanese
maker of smartphones, climbed 1.5 percent from the closing share
price in Tokyo. Those of  Mitsubishi Corp. (8058) ,  Japan ’s largest
commodities trader, increased 0.3 percent. ADRs of Woodside
Petroleum Ltd., Australia’s second-biggest oil and gas producer,
advanced 0.8 percent after crude prices jumped.  Futures on Japan’s  Nikkei 225 (NKY)  Stock Average expiring in
September closed at 9,135 in Chicago yesterday, compared with
9,060 in Osaka, Japan. They were bid in the pre-market at 9,130
in Osaka at 8:05 a.m. local time. Futures on Australia’s S&P/ASX
200 Index gained 0.6 percent today. New Zealand’s NZX 50 Index
rose 1 percent in Wellington.  “Large-scale acquisitions are increasing in the U.S.,
indicating stocks are relatively cheap,” said  Fumiyuki Nakanishi , a strategist at Tokyo-based SMBC Friend Securities Co.
“There’s no doubt that Japanese stocks are cheap in terms of
valuations and the rebound will continue.”  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index slid 0.2 percent
today. In  New York , the index gained 2.2 percent to 1,204.49
yesterday, erasing last weeks’ drop, as $21.5 billion in
takeovers and valuations near the cheapest level in two years
helped the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index extend its best three-day
rally since 2009.  Google, Motorola  Google Inc., the biggest maker of smartphone software,
agreed to buy Motorola Mobility Holdings Inc. for $12.5 billion
in its largest acquisition, gaining mobile patents and expanding
in the hardware business.  “Google’s buying a hardware company indicates the smart
phone market will grow from now on,” Nakanishi said. “High-
tech and smartphone-related stocks may attract investors.”  Benchmark gauges in the U.S. also rose after  Federal
Reserve  Bank of Atlanta President  Dennis Lockhart  said the
central bank could purchase more Treasuries or alter its balance
sheet if the  U.S. economy  were to slow further. “If additional
actions are required, I can assure you the Federal Reserve is
not out of bullets,” Lockhart said yesterday in a speech in
Florence, Alabama.  Europe Rebound  European stocks gained, extending the biggest three-day
rally for the benchmark Stoxx Europe 600 Index in 15 months,
after last week sliding to the cheapest valuation in more than
two years.  The Stoxx 600 advanced 0.2 percent to 237.85 in  London . The
gauge has rallied 6.4 percent over the past three days after a
global equity rout left stocks trading at the cheapest since
March 2009 amid concern the global economic recovery is stalling.  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index lost 9.7 percent this year
through yesterday, compared with drops of 4.2 percent by the S&P
500 and 13.8 percent by the Stoxx Europe 600 Index. Stocks in
the Asian benchmark are valued at 12.5 times estimated earnings
on average, the lowest since December 2008, compared with 12.1
times for the S&P 500 and 9.8 times for the Stoxx 600.  Crude oil for September delivery increased 2.9 percent to
settle at $87.88 a barrel in New York yesterday. Copper futures
for December delivery gained 0.5 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
