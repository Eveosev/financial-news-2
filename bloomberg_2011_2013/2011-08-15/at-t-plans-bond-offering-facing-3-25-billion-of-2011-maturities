AT&T Inc. (T) , the second-largest U.S.
wireless carrier, sold $5 billion of bonds to help pay back debt
maturing this year.  AT&T sold $1.5 billion of 2.4 percent, five-year notes that
yield 148 basis points more than similar-maturity Treasuries,
$1.5 billion of 3.875 percent, 10-year debt at a spread of 160
basis points and $2 billion of 5.55 percent, 30-year bonds that
pay 185 basis points more than benchmarks, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. Proceeds may also be used for general
corporate purposes, said a person familiar with the offering,
who declined to be identified because the terms are private.  Corporate bond offerings are showing signs of life, with
borrowers from Occidental Petroleum Corp. to San Diego Gas &
Electric Co. joining Dallas-based AT&T in tapping the market as
yields on investment-grade debt hover at about the lowest on
record. Sales rose 37.6 percent last week to $13.6 billion after
falling to the lowest since June during the period ended Aug. 5,
Bloomberg data show.  AT&T has $3.25 billion of bonds coming due this year,
according to Bloomberg data.  Fitch Ratings  said the company
planned to sell about $4 billion of bonds earlier today.  Barclays Plc and JPMorgan Chase & Co. managed AT&T’s
offering, Bloomberg data show. Fitch assigned the notes a grade
of A, it said today in a statement. The company is rated A2 by
Moody’s Investors Service and A-, one step lower, by  Standard &
Poor’s .  Previous Sale  AT&T last sold bonds on April 26, when it issued $1.75
billion of five-year, 2.95 percent notes that yielded 97 basis
points more than similar-maturity Treasuries and $1.25 billion
of 10-year, 4.45 percent debt that paid a spread of 115 basis
points, Bloomberg data show. A basis point is 0.01 percentage
point.  The notes due May 2016 traded at 104.4 cents on the dollar
on Aug. 12 to yield 1.98 percent, 102 basis points more than
benchmarks, according to Trace, the bond price reporting system
of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority.  Yields on bonds in the Bank of America Merrill Lynch U.S.
Corporate Master Index averaged 3.64 percent on Aug. 12 after
touching 3.503 percent on Aug. 9, the lowest in daily data
extending to October 1986.  Verizon Wireless  is the biggest U.S. wireless carrier.  To contact the reporters on this story:
