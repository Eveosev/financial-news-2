An Italian aid worker was kidnapped
in  Sudan ’s western region of  Darfur ,  Italy ’s Foreign Ministry
said in an e-mailed statement today.  Francesco Azzara, a doctor with the Italian aid group
Emergency, was kidnapped yesterday in Nyala, the capital of
south Darfur state, the ministry said. “The mission confirms an
Italian aid worker, a doctor, was abducted,” Kemal Saiki, a
spokesman for the United Nations and African Union peacekeeping
mission in Sudan’s western region of Darfur, said today by phone
from El Fasher, the capital of North Darfur state.  Bandits and armed groups have targeted aid groups in
Darfur, where an eight-year old conflict between the government
and rebel groups has led to the deaths of as many as 300,000
people, mainly due to illness and starvation, and forced about
2.7 million to flee their homes, according to UN estimates.  Insurgents in Darfur took up arms in 2003, accusing
President Umar al-Bashir’s government in Khartoum of neglecting
the region. The Sudanese government has put the death toll at
about 10,000.  To contact the reporter on this story:
