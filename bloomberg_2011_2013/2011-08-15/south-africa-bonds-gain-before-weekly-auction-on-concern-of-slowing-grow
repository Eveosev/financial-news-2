South African bonds gained for the
first day in three before tomorrow’s government debt auction on
bets the central bank will keep borrowing costs on hold amid
signs growth in  Africa ’s biggest economy is faltering.  The Treasury is selling 1.1 billion rand ($153.6 million)
of 8.25 percent notes maturing in 2017 and 1 billion rand of 6.5
percent securities due 2041. The secondary market yield on the
2017 bonds dropped six basis points, or 0.06 percentage point,
to 7.607 percent by 1:10 p.m. in Johannesburg. The yield has
retreated 49 basis points in the past month.  The  Reserve Bank  has kept its key  interest rate  at a 30-
year low of 5.5 percent this year to help spur  consumer spending 
and shore up growth, even as inflation accelerated. The debt
crises in the U.S. and  Europe , which have driven Treasury 10-
year note yields to record lows, have also clouded growth
prospects of other parts of the world, Finance Minister  Pravin
Gordhan  said today.  “Slower growth and the low U.S. Treasury 10-year yield
continue to be the dominant factors” driving local bond prices,
Rand Merchant Bank analysts led by Theuns de Wet wrote in a
research note. Investors’ expectations of slower growth were
“evident in the divergent trends between bond inflows and
equity inflows,” they wrote.  Foreign investors bought a net 4.7 billion rand ($654.2
million) of South African bonds in the past two weeks, while
selling a net 3.7 billion rand of stocks, according to JSE Ltd.
data.  Manufacturing Decline  Factory output slowed to 0.9 percent in June, from 1
percent the previous month, Pretoria-based Statistics South
Africa reported on Aug. 11, adding to evidence the nation’s
manufacturing sector is struggling to recover. Retail-sales data
due on Aug. 17 may provide further evidence of sluggish growth,
the Rand Merchant Bank analysts said.  Rand Merchant Bank, a unit of  South Africa ’s second-biggest
lender, and  Standard Bank  Group Ltd., the nation’s biggest bank,
have revised their outlook for interest rates in the past week,
seeing borrowing costs remaining unchanged until the second half
of 2012.  “The significant deterioration in the external
environment, and our recent downward revision of domestic growth
prospects for 2012, justify a review of our” interest-rate
expectations, Standard Bank analysts led by Johannesburg-based
Michael Keenan wrote in a note today.  Standard Bank now expects the first rate increase to be in
the third quarter of 2012, rather than the first, the analysts
said. The repo rate will likely rise by a total of 2 percentage
points by the end of 2013, rather than the previously-expected 3
percentage points, they wrote.  Forward-rate agreements starting in August next year, which
investors use to lock in borrowing costs, dropped 5.5 basis
points today to 5.77 percent. The rate has declined from a 2011
high of 7.145 percent on March 3.  The debt auction starts at 11 a.m. in  Pretoria  and the
results are expected at about 11:30 a.m., according to the
Reserve Bank, which is conducting the auction on behalf of the
Treasury.  To contact the reporter on this story:
