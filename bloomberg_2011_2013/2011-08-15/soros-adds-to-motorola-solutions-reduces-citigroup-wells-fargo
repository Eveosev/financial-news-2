George Soros , the billionaire who is
returning money to outside investors to focus on his family’s
assets, added to shares of Motorola Solutions Inc. while cutting
most of his stakes in Citigroup Inc. and  Wells Fargo & Co . in
the second quarter.  Soros Fund Management LLC bought 1.2 million shares of
Motorola Solutions, bringing his holding to 5.7 million, the
firm said today in a filing with the U.S. Securities and
Exchange Commission. The New York-based firm sold 2.9 million
shares of Citigroup and 3.4 million shares of Well Fargo,
according to the filing.  New financial regulations would have forced the firm to
register with the SEC by March 2012, prompting the decision to
run it as a family office, Soros’s sons, Jonathan and Robert,
wrote last month in a letter to investors. Soros, who controls
more than $24.5 billion for himself, his family and his
foundations, will return about $1 billion in clients’ money by
year-end, two people briefed on the matter said at the time.  Motorola Solutions, the maker of bar-code scanners and
walkie-talkies, split in January from Motorola Mobility Holdings
Inc., which today said it would be acquired by Google Inc. for
$12.5 billion. Motorola Solutions shares have climbed 9.2
percent this year.  Soros sold his entire stake of 116,210 shares in Internet
company Google in the quarter, the filing shows. He added
498,240 shares of Polo Ralph Lauren Corp., doubling his stake.  Soros, 81, is best known for his 1992 bet that the  Bank of
England  would be forced to devalue the pound, a wager that
resulted in a $1 billion profit for him.  Sree Vidya Bhaktavatsalam in Boston at +1-617-210-4627 or
