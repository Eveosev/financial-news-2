Russia will set up a company to
handle construction of  Turkey ’s first nuclear power plant,
Hurriyet reported, citing  Hasan Koktas , head of the country’s
energy regulator.  The company will have a capital of 1.4 billion liras ($787
million) and will apply to the Ankara-based regulator for a
power-production license this year, the newspaper said.  Turkey selected Rosatom Corp. and Atomstroyexport ZAO to
build the plant in the town of Akkuyu on the Mediterranean
coast. The $20 billion project includes four units with a
combined capacity of 4,800 megawatts, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
