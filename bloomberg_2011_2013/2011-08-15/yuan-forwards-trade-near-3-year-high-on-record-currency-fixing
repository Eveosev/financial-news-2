Yuan forwards traded near their
strongest level in more than three years after the central bank
fixed  China ’s currency higher for a fourth straight day.  The People’s Bank of China set the  reference rate  0.03
percent higher at a record 6.3950 per dollar. The yuan had its
biggest gain since 2007 last week as official data showed
consumer prices rose the most in three years last month and
China’s  trade surplus  surged.  “Fundamentals really support the yuan to be stronger,”
said Leong Sook Mei, a currency strategist in Singapore at Bank
of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ Ltd. “The data for the trade surplus as
well as inflation were very elevated.”  The twelve-month non-deliverable forward was at 6.2713 per
dollar as of 4:51 p.m. in  Hong Kong , compared with 6.2706 at the
end of last week, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The
contract reached 6.2650 earlier, the strongest level since April
2008. The premium to the  exchange rate  in Shanghai was 2
percent, up from a two-year low of 0.4 percent on Aug. 9.  The yuan was little changed at 6.3904, according to the
China Foreign Exchange Trade System. The currency advanced 0.8
percent last week and touched 6.3890 on Aug. 12, the strongest
level since the country unified official and market exchange
rates at the end of 1993.  In Hong Kong’s offshore market, the yuan gained 0.1 percent
to 6.3770.  Consumer prices climbed 6.5 percent from a year earlier in
July, the most since June 2008, according to official data
released on Aug. 9. China had a trade surplus of $31.5 billion
in July, the biggest since January 2009, the government said the
next day.  To contact the reporter on this story:
