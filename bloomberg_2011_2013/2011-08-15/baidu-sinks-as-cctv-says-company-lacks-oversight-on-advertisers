Baidu Inc. slumped the most intraday
since Aug. 10 after a Chinese state broadcaster said the owner
of the country’s most popular search engine lacks oversight on
companies that advertise on its site.  The Beijing-based company lost 3.7 percent to $144.66 at
3:40 p.m. in  New York  today, compared with a 1.9 percent rally
by the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index to 1,200.93. A program on
China Central Television today had “negative coverage” on
Baidu, according to Andy Yeung, a New York-based analyst at
Oppenheimer & Co.  The CCTV program alleged that some of the company’s
platforms such as its Baidu Union and PhoenixNest lacked
“internal controls and oversights over their paid
advertisers,” Yeung wrote in an e-mail today. Kaiser Kuo, a
spokesman at Baidu.com, didn’t respond to an e-mail seeking
comment that was sent after normal business hours.  Baidu tumbled 25 percent on Nov. 17, 2008, and the company
issued a public apology after CCTV reported that the website led
patients to unlicensed medical care. The company cut its fourth-
quarter sales forecast by 13 percent less than a month later.
The Beijing Morning Post reported in July 2010 the company
profited from selling online-search keywords to a website that
offered unlicensed drugs.  Baidu took steps in 2008 to correct problems highlighted in
the report on CCTV. It removed unlicensed providers of drugs and
other medical care from its search screens and said it’s
redesigning its site so that paid search results are more
distinguishable from free ones.  Last month, Baidu forecast third-quarter revenue that beat
all 11 analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg as customers
spend more on search-engine advertising in the world’s second-
biggest economy. Revenue will rise to between 3.95 billion yuan
($620 million) and 4.05 billion yuan in the three months to
Sept. 30, Baidu said in a statement on July 25.  To contact the reporter on this story:
