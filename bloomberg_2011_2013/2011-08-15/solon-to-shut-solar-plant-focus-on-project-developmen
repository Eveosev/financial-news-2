Solon SE (SOO1) , a German solar company,
will close a module-manufacturing plant in Tucson, Arizona, to
focus in  North America  on developing solar projects for
utilities and large commercial clients.  “We regret the near-term impact of this business decision
on our employees and the Tucson community, but as a company
Solon is adapting to a rapidly changing solar market,” Dan
Alcombright, chief executive officer of North America for Solon,
said today in a statement.  Manufacturing at the facility will be phased out by the end
of October, resulting in the elimination of about 60 of the 130
jobs there, Berlin-based Solon said in the statement.  Employees that focus on sales and marketing, engineering,
research and product development, project management, finance,
and other support functions will remain at the location.  Solon intends to invest further in new product development
and will introduce new products before year-end, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
