Morgan Stanley raised its allocation
to emerging-market equities to the highest level since April
2009, citing “historic” low valuations and prospects the
stocks will outperform developed nations’ shares.  The brokerage increased its equity allocation in its multi-
asset emerging-market portfolio to 58 percent, 8 percentage
points over benchmark, analysts led by  Jonathan Garner  wrote in
a report today. They lowered their recommended weighting in
dollar- and euro-denominated debt to fund the change, according
to the report.  The MSCI Emerging Markets Index has lost 15 percent since
Morgan Stanley last lifted its developing-nation equity
allocation on July 4, as the European debt crisis spread and
 Standard & Poor’s  reduction of U.S. credit rating fueled concern
the global economy will falter. The gauge, which added 0.8
percent to 997.46 as of 9:43 a.m. in  Hong Kong , trades at 9.9
times estimated earnings, compared with its five-year average of
10.7 times, according to weekly data compiled by Bloomberg.  A global recession remains a “relatively low risk”
because of “resilient” commodity markets, central bank
policies in developed markets and slowing inflation in emerging
markets, Garner, the brokerage’s chief Asian and emerging-market
strategist, said in the report. The crises in  Europe  and the
U.S. have increased their conviction that emerging markets will
outperform their developed peers in the second half, he wrote.  Morgan Stanley cut its end-2011 forecast for the MSCI
Emerging Markets Index by 8 percent to 1,200 from 1,305 and
trimmed their yearend estimate for the MSCI Asia Pacific
excluding Japan Index to 510 from 550, according to the report.  Next Year’s Targets  A “fair” mid-2012 target for MSCI’s emerging-market index
would be 1,305, they wrote, saying that the gauge trades at 1.62
times net assets and is valued at about 9.2 times 2012 earnings
estimates. They set a forecast of 1,355 for the end of 2012,
according to the report.  “Back tests on these variables and the equity risk premium
to 10-year U.S. Treasuries suggests returns of 11 to 56 percent
over six months and 21 to 85 percent over 12 months, which are
consistent with the upside to our revised target prices,”
according to the analysts.  China  allowing the yuan to appreciate at a faster pace is
also “positive for global re-balancing,” Asian consumption and
emerging-market stocks, Morgan Stanley said. “China’s urban
household income is considerably larger than officially
estimated and can support global growth.”  Morgan Stanley’s is “overweight” on markets including
 Brazil , China,  South Korea , Malaysia and  Russia . The brokerage
has an “overweight” recommendation on the energy, materials
and financial industries, according to the report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
