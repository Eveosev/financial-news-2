Gold declined for a third day, set
for the worst run in seven weeks, as concern eased that the
global economy is stalling, boosting global equities and cutting
demand for haven investments.  Spot bullion lost 0.5 percent to $1,738.88 an ounce at 2:43
p.m. in Singapore, after shedding as much as 1.1 percent. Gold,
which reached a record $1,814.95 on Aug. 11, is still 22 percent
higher this year on debt woes in  Europe  and the U.S. The metal
in Swiss francs rose to this year’s high of 1,390.91 today.  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index rose for the first day in three
after  Japan ’s economy contracted less than estimated in the
second quarter, adding to signs of a rebound from a record
earthquake and tsunami in March. U.S. retail sales climbed the
most in four months in July, while applications for jobless
benefits were the lowest since April, reports showed last week.  “The market’s taking a step back and I’m still thinking
it’s just a little bit too high,”  Jonathan Barratt , a managing
director at Commodity Broking Services Pty., said in a Bloomberg
Television interview. “If the equity markets start to pick up,
then I think people will switch out of their gold positions.”  December-delivery gold dropped 0.2 percent to $1,739.10 an
ounce, after losing as much as 0.7 percent on the Comex in  New
York  as higher margins on contracts encouraged sales.  CME Group
Inc. (CME) , the largest futures market, hiked initial- and maintenance
margins, or the minimum amount of cash that investors must keep
on deposit, by 22 percent from the close of trade on Aug. 11.  Hedge Funds  Exchange-traded product holdings decreased for a second day
on Aug. 12 to 2,182.083 metric tons, after reaching a record
2,216.756 tons on Aug. 8, Bloomberg data show. Hedge funds and
other money managers trimmed their net-long gold positions by 18
percent to 203,573 contracts in the week to Aug. 9, data from
the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission showed.  In Europe, the Stoxx Europe 600 Index trimmed its third
weekly drop last week after  France ,  Spain , Italy and Belgium
imposed bans on short selling to stabilize markets amid
speculation the region’s debt crisis may spread to France.  The “uncertainty in financial markets, whether from the
growth outlook or the ongoing sovereign-debt crisis, is expected
to remain a benefit to perceived safe-haven commodity assets, of
which we believe gold is the standout,” Morgan Stanley analysts
led by  Hussein Allidina  said in a report today.  Spot silver declined as much as 1.1 percent to $38.6875 an
ounce, while palladium advanced as much as 1.7 percent to
$759.50 an ounce. Cash platinum shed 0.4 percent to $1,789 an
ounce, after earlier climbing 0.4 percent.  To contact the reporter for this story:
