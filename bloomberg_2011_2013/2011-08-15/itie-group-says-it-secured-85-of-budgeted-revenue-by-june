Mitie Group Plc (MTO) , a U.K. services and
maintenance company, said it’s trading in line with forecasts
after securing most of its budgeted full-year revenue.  The Bristol, England-based company made 85 percent of
predicted annual sales by June 30, compared with 78 percent a
year earlier, it said today in a statement distributed by the
Regulatory News Service. Mitie said its energy services business
accounted for 34 percent of the group’s revenue.  Last month it acquired the remaining 50 percent of Service
Management International from Germany’s Kluh Service Management
for 1.5 million pounds ($2.4 million), as well as securing 250
million pounds of new banking facilities, the statement said.  The company’s services include providing security guards to
all law courts in  England  and Wales and energy management for
customers such as Vodafone Group Plc and Rolls-Royce Group Plc.
Mitie is the U.K.’s second-largest energy services provider.  To contact the reporter on this story:
