Starbucks Corp. (SBUX)  Chief Executive
Officer  Howard Schultz  urged other CEOs to boycott donating to
U.S. political campaigns to encourage leaders to solve the
nation’s growing budget deficit.  “I am asking that all of us forego political contributions
until the Congress and the President return to  Washington  and
deliver a fiscally disciplined long-term debt and deficit plan
to the American people,” Schultz wrote in an e-mail sent to
business leaders that was obtained by Bloomberg News.  Schultz, 58, joined Starbucks about three decades ago and
later served as CEO until in 2000. He took the reins again in
2008 amid slumping sales growth after the company expanded too
rapidly. The Starbucks leader has spoken on issues such as the
high price of coffee, which he says is driven by market
speculation.  Among the recipients of Schultz’s e-mail were NYSE Euronext
CEO Duncan Niederauer and Bob Greifeld, CEO of Nasdaq OMX Group
Inc., who in turn e-mailed letters to companies listed on their
respective exchanges.  Schultz encouraged fellow business leaders in the e-mail to
“voice your perspective publicly” and said that “businesses
need to do all they can to accelerate  job creation .”  Corey duBrowa, a spokesman for Seattle-based Starbucks,
said the e-mail was sent last night and dated Aug. 15.  Schultz donated to Senator  Maria Cantwell , a Washington
state Democrat, in March, according to OpenSecrets.org.  Starbucks is the world’s largest coffee-shop operator with
about 10,900 U.S. stores.  The New York Times earlier reported on Schultz’s e-mail.  To contact the reporter on this story:
