Burkina Faso  will increase gold
production this year by 32 percent as mines that operate in
the landlocked West African nation ramp up their output of the
precious metal.  Mines are forecast to generate 33.7 metric tons of gold,
compared with 25.6 tons in 2010, said Mabourlaye Nombre,
director-general of mines and geology for Burkina Faso, which
neighbors Ghana,  Africa ’s second-biggest gold producer, and
Mali, which vies with Tanzania as the third.  The production boost comes amid an “interesting” world
gold market, he said in an interview in Ouagadougou, the
capital, Aug. 11. The price of gold rose to a record $1,814.95
an ounce on the same day as investors sought a haven during a
decline in global equities. It traded at $1,740.75 by 11:43
a.m. in  London  today.  Nombre declined to say which of the six mines operating in
the country plan to boost output.  Iamgold Corp. (IMG) ’s Essakane mine is forecast to produce as
much as 360,000 ounces this year, said Gordon Stothart, executive
vice president and chief operating officer, during a
conference call Aug. 11. The mine produced 122,000 ounces last
year, according to the Toronto-based company’s website.  George Town, Grand Cayman-based  Endeavour Mining Corp. (EDV) 
operates the Youga mine and expects production of 84,000
ounces this year, compared with 82,400 ounces in 2010,
according to its  website .  After winning a new five-year term in office in November
that extended his rule of one of the world’s poorest
countries, Burkinabe President Blaise Compaore pledged to lure
investment in gold mining. The industry accounts for 7.7
percent of  Burkina Faso ’s gross domestic product and employs
5,000 people, said Nombre.  Burkina Faso ranks 161st out of 169 countries in the
United Nations’ Human Development Index, and its GDP per
capita of $517 for a population of 17.7 million people is less
than half the sub-Saharan African average of $1,127, according
to the  World Bank .  To contact the reporter on this story:
