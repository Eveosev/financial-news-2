EON AG plans to break up its Ruhrgas
unit and search for a buyer for the gas-transmission network,
 Financial Times Deutschland said , citing unidentified people
close to the company.  EON, based in Dusseldorf,  Germany , will shrink the
division’s unprofitable gas-trading unit and tie it to EON’s
energy-trading business and shift Ruhrgas’s gas-production
operation to the parent company, the German newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
