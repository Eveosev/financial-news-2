Mauritius’ rupee weakened for a
third day against the euro as hotel operators cut the supply of
the currency of the island nation’s biggest trading partner.
Tourism is the country’s largest foreign-currency earner with
textiles.  The currency had its longest streak of losses since June
29, depreciating 0.6 percent to 40.3724 per euro by 12:55 p.m.
in  Port Louis , the capital. A close at this level will be its
lowest since July 27. Against the dollar, the rupee declined 0.7
percent to 28.20.  Arrivals for the seven months through July rose 5.1 percent
to 542,638 visitors, according to data published by the
government on Aug. 12.  “It seems that euro holders, mainly hotel groups, are
looking for a better price, and they are not willing to sell
below the 40-rupee level,” said Fabien Gebert, treasurer at
GML, an investment group that says its the country’s biggest by
assets. “The low volume of foreign-currency purchases doesn’t
presently contribute to increase the value of their proceeds.”  Buying prices for the dollar were from 27.3208 to 27.4859
rupees, while the selling price was 28.7841 per dollar, versus
28.8588 on Aug. 12, according to indicative exchange rates
published today on the  Bank of Mauritius’s website .  To contact the reporter on this story:
