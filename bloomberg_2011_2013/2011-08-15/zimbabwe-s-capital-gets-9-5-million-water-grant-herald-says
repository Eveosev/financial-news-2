The  African Development Bank  has
allocated the City of Harare a $9.5 million grant to help repair
its water and sewer systems, the state-controlled  Herald  said,
citing the capital’s water director, Christopher Zvobgo.  The grant will be used to install a chemical dosing plant
and new flow meters in the city, the Harare-based Herald said on
its website. About 30 percent of Harare’s water leaks out of the
system before it reaches users, the Herald said.  For Company News:  To contact the reporter on this story:
