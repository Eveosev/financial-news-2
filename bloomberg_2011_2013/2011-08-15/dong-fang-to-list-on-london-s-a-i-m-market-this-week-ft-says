Dong Fang Shipbuilding Co., a
Chinese builder of chemical tankers, is likely to join  London ’s
Alternative Investment Market this week, the Financial Times
reported.  The company will probably have a market value of about 32
million pounds ($52 million) after raising $14.3 million in a
pre-listing exercise, mainly from investors in  Singapore , the
newspaper said.  Dong Fang, which has yards in Anhui and Zheijang provinces,
said it opted to join A.I.M. rather than an Asian market because
most of its customers are European, the FT reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
