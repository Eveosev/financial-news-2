The U.S. is encouraged by recent
advances of the forces fighting  Muammar Qaddafi ’s regime in
 Libya , State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland said today.  “What we are seeing is an effort by the rebels to choke
off the access routes to Tripoli,” Nuland said. With that
military progress, “we’ve seen a steady march of senior Qaddafi
officials abandoning him.”  “We’re encouraged by the progress they’re making and
they’re increasing the pressure on Tripoli,” she said of the
Libyan rebel forces.  To contact the reporter on this story:
