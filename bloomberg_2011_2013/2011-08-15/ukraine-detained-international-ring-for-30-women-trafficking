Ukraineâ€™s security service and the
police detained members of an international ring that allegedly
helped send young Ukrainian women to  Germany  and  Poland  and
forced them to become prostitutes.  The ring, which included at least three citizens of Ukraine
and two of Germany, was operating for more than two years, the
security service, based in capital Kiev, said today in a
 statement  on its website.  They carried 30 Ukrainians from eastern and western regions
of the former Soviet republic, promising jobs, according to the
statement. In reality, the women were forced to work as
prostitutes at night clubs, the security service said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
