Bright Food Group Co.,  China ’s
second-largest food company, agreed to buy a majority stake in
Australia’s Manassen Foods.  Both companies are “finalizing the details” of the
transaction, Pan Jianjun, Shanghai-based spokesman for Bright
Food, said in an interview.   The state-owned Chinese foodmaker will pay A$400 million
($416 million) for a 75 percent stake, according to two people
familiar with the deal who declined to be identified because the
negotiations aren’t public. Bright Food will buy the stake from
Champ Private Equity in a deal that gives Manassen, the maker of
Albatros bread and Harringtons chocolates, an enterprise value
of about A$530 million, said the people.  Bright Food will import Manassen’s brands into China, Pan
said. The Chinese foodmaker will also sell its products through
Manassen’s network in  Australia , he said.  Pan declined to comment further on the transaction.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
