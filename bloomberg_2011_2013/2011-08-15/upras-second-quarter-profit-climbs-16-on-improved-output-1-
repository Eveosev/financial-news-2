Tupras Turkiye Petrol Rafinerileri
AS (TUPRS) ,  Turkey ’s sole oil refiner, said second-quarter profit rose
as sales climbed 59 percent on increased capacity utilization.  Net income advanced 16 percent to 258.1 million liras ($146
million) from 222.1 million liras in the same period of 2010,
the Izmit, Turkey-based company said in a statement to the
 Istanbul Stock Exchange  today. That compares with the 262.4
million liras average estimate of seven analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg.  Tupras used more of its refining capacity to meet growing
demand in the quarter, increasing the utilization rate to 77.4
percent from 70.6 percent a year earlier, it said. The company
boosted production by 10.8 percent to 5.2 million metric tons
and sales by 14.1 percent to 6.4 million tons in the second
quarter, it said.  “Good performance in production and sales helped increase
the profitability of the company,” Tupras said in an e-mailed
statement later.  The shares advanced 1.2 liras, or 3.6 percent, to 34.4
liras at the 5:30 p.m. close in Istanbul, the highest since Aug.
4.  The refinery margin, or the profit from turning oil into
fuel, fell to $4.30 a barrel in the second quarter from $4.90 a
year earlier, the company said. The margin rose to $4.10 a
barrel in the first half of the year from $3.40 a year earlier.  Cleaner Fuels  The company expects refinery margins to remain almost
unchanged if  oil prices  are at about $100 a barrel, Jonathan
Lamb, Tupras investor relations officer, said in an analyst
teleconference today. Tupras doesn’t foresee an impact on its
foreign exchange position after the lira weakened to the lowest
in more than two years earlier this month, Lamb said.  Sales in the second quarter rose to 10.5 billion liras from
6.6 billion liras a year ago, it said.  Tupras, owned by  Koc Holding AS (KCHOL) , is also seeking to meet
rising demand for cleaner fuels by investing $2.38 billion in a
residuum upgrade. The project will produce 2.55 million tons of
additional diesel, 772,000 tons of gasoline and 203,000 tons of
liquefied petroleum gas a year from 2014.  About $2 billion of loans to finance the project is
guaranteed by  export credit agencies , Lamb said in the
teleconference. Commercial loans will also be used, he said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
