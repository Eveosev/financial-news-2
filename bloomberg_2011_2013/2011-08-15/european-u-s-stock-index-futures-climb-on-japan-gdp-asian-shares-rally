European stocks rose, extending the
biggest three-day rally for the benchmark Stoxx Europe 600 Index
in 15 months, after last week sliding to the cheapest valuation
in more than two years.  Nokia Oyj jumped 9.1 percent after Google Inc. agreed to
buy U.S. rival Motorola Mobility Holdings Inc. for about $12.5
billion.  Swatch Group AG (UHR)  paced gains among Swiss exporters as
the franc headed for its largest three-day decline on record
against the euro.  Michael Page International Plc (MPI)  tumbled 8.1
percent after the recruiter’s earnings missed analyst estimates.  The Stoxx 600 advanced 0.2 percent to 237.85 at the 4:30
p.m. close in London after swinging between gains and losses at
least 20 times today. The gauge has rallied 6.4 percent over the
past three days after a global equity rout left stocks trading
at the cheapest since March 2009 amid concern the economic
recovery is stalling.  “I see plenty of excellent buying opportunities amongst
defensive and cyclical companies,” James Bevan, chief
investment officer at CCLA Investment Management Ltd., said on
Bloomberg Television. “I am not really worried about a double-
dip recession.”  An 18 percent decline from this year’s high on Feb. 17 has
left the Stoxx 600 trading at 9.7 times the estimated earnings
of its companies, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. That
compares with the average multiple of 12.1 over the past five
years.  Record Swings  Global markets are stabilizing after a week of record
swings in U.S. stocks that was sparked by S&P’s downgrade of its
 credit rating  for the world’s largest economy. More than $6
trillion in market value has been wiped off global equities
since July 24 amid concern the global economic recovery may be
at risk.  A report today showed  Japan ’s gross domestic product shrank
at an annualized 1.3 percent rate in the three months ended June
30. The median forecast of 25 economists surveyed by Bloomberg
was for a 2.5 percent drop.  National benchmark indexes in  Europe  climbed in all 14
western European markets that were open.  Germany ’s DAX rose 0.4
percent, the U.K.’s FTSE 100 gained 0.6 percent and France’s CAC
40 increased 0.8 percent. Italy, Luxembourg, Austria and  Greece 
were closed for a holiday.  Nokia, the world’s biggest maker of mobile phones by
volume, jumped 9.1 percent to 4.09 euros after Google agreed to
buy Motorola Mobility, gaining wireless patents and entering the
hardware business. That was the largest gain since January 2010.  Swiss Exporters  Swiss exporters advanced as the franc weakened against the
euro, heading for its biggest three-day decline since the
European currency’s 1999 debut, amid speculation Switzerland
will take further action to counter recent gains. The
SonntagsZeitung newspaper said the Swiss government and the
central bank are in “intense” talks over setting a target for
their currency.  Swatch, the world’s biggest watchmaker, added 3.1 percent
to 371 francs and Cie. Financiere Richemont SA gained 2.4
percent to 44.08 francs.  Zurich Financial Services AG (ZURN)  rallied 3.6 percent to 177.7
francs after both Credit Suisse Group AG and Keefe, Bruyette &
Woods Inc. raised their recommendations for the Swiss insurer to
“outperform.” The stock had tumbled 29 percent this year
through the end of last week.  Aker Advances  Aker Drilling ASA, controlled by billionaire Kjell Inge Roekke’s  Aker ASA (AKER) , jumped 96 percent to 26.20 kroner after
 Transocean Ltd. (RIG) , the world’s largest offshore driller, offered
to buy the company for 7.9 billion kroner ($1.4 billion), or
26.50 kroner a share.  Aker ASA rallied 12 percent to 138 kroner while  Fugro NV (FUR) ,
the world’s largest surveyor of deepwater  oil fields , jumped 5
percent to 41.65 euros.  Hochtief AG (HOT)  climbed 3.3 percent to 49.60 euros after
 Australia ’s Leighton Holdings Ltd. reiterated it expects to
swing to profit this year. Australia’s biggest builder, 54
percent owned by Hochtief, boosted its work in hand 11 percent
to a record A$46.2 billion ($48.1 billion) and repeated its
forecast for an after-tax profit of between A$600 million and
A$650 million for the current year.  Michael Page  plunged 8.1 percent to 368 pence as the U.K.
recruiter said gross profit growth is slowing in the banking
industry. The company also reported a 26 percent drop in first-
half pretax profit to 45.5 million pounds ($76 million), missing
the average analyst estimate of 52.1 million pounds.  To contact the reporter on this story:
