AS Premia Foods, the largest Baltic
frozen-food producer, said second-quarter profit rose 38 percent
from a year earlier, helped mainly by its ice-cream unit.  Net income rose to 1.1 million euros ($1.6 million) from
758,000 euros a year earlier, the Tallinn-based company said in
a regulatory statement today. Revenue rose 30 percent to 27.6
million euros.  The companyâ€™s ice-cream unit, boosted by the acquisition of
Saint Petersburg, Russia-based OOO Khladokombinat No. 1 in May
last year, increased gross profit by 41 percent from a year
earlier to 5.3 million euros.  To contact the reporter on this story:
