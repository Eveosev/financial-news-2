Iran  plans to start the initial
phase of its first nuclear power plant in early September,  Press
TV  reported, citing the head of the country’s Atomic Energy
Organization, Fereydoun Abasi-Davani.  The Bushehr power plant, located in southern Iran, will at
that time join the national grid, operating at 40 percent
capacity, Abasi-Davani said, according to the state-run news
channel.  The official start of the 1,000-megawatt Russian-built
facility in full is scheduled to take place by December, the
official added in the report published late yesterday on Press
TV’s website.  Safety at the plant will be observed “at the highest
level” especially in light of the accident at  Japan ’s Fukushima
nuclear power plant and its impact on public opinion, Abasi-
Davani said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
