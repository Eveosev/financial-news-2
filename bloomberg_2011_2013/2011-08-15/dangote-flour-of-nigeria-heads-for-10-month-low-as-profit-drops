Dangote Flour Mills Plc (DANGFLOU) , a Nigerian
producer, headed for 10-month low after it reported a 51 percent
drop in annual profit.  The stock lost 76 kobo, or the maximum daily limit of 5
percent, to 14.4 naira by 1:43 p.m. in Lagos. A close at this
price will be its lowest since Oct. 11.  Net income for the period declined to 2.72 billion naira
($17.7 million) from 5.56 billion naira a year earlier, the
company said in a statement published on the website of the
 Nigerian Stock Exchange  on Aug. 12.  “That was a bad result, so I think investors will react
negatively,” Adedoyin Adelakun, a consumer-goods analyst at
Lagos-based Vetiva Asset Management Ltd., said by phone today.
“The negative performance was due mainly to the poor
performance of Dangote Noodles, a subsidiary of Dangote Flour,
and high wheat prices in 2010.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
