South  Africa ’s rand advanced against
the dollar for a fourth day as stocks and commodity prices rose
on optimism the global recovery is intact, supporting demand for
higher-yielding assets.  The currency strengthened as much as 1.4 percent to 7.0806
per dollar, and traded 0.6 percent up at 7.1355 as of 4:22 p.m.
in Johannesburg. The rand has rebounded 3.9 percent since
falling to a one-year low versus the dollar on Aug. 9.  Emerging-market stocks headed for the biggest gain since
April 20 after Morgan Stanley lifted its allocation to the
shares to the highest since 2009. The prices of metals including
copper and platinum advanced after  Japan ’s economy shrank less
than economists surveyed by Bloomberg estimated, improving the
global outlook for raw materials.  South Africa ’s benchmark stock
index gained for a fourth day, led by mining companies including
Anglo American Plc and BHP Billiton Ltd.  “Global equity markets are recovering, volatility has
moderated and safe-haven assets such as gold have stopped
rallying, implying that the panic after the U.S. credit rating
downgrade is subsiding,”  Standard Bank  Group Ltd. analysts led
by Johannesburg-based Michael Keenan wrote in a research note.
“Given that the rand remains a key barometer for risk appetite,
it could enjoy further” gains to 6.96 per dollar, the analysts
wrote.  The rand’s three-month volatility versus the dollar dropped
67 basis points, or 0.67 percentage point, to 18.5 percent
today, indicating traders see swings in the currency narrowing
in coming weeks. The measure has dropped from a one-year high of
19.57 percent on Aug. 9.  Bonds Gain  “Intraday volatility has slowly dropped away,”  John Cairns  and Nema Ramkhelawan-Bhana, currency strategists at Rand
Merchant Bank in Johannesburg, said in a research note. “This
is a positive environment for risk assets.”  Bonds gained for the first day in three on expectations
that the central bank will leave its key  interest rate  on hold
longer, to aid a recovery in Africa’s largest economy.  The 13.5 percent notes due 2015 rose 27 cents to 122.916
percent, driving the yield down seven basis points to 6.932
percent. The 6.75 percent securities due 2021 climbed 54 cents
to 91.376 rand, reducing the yield eight basis points to 8.053
percent.  Standard Bank, Africa’s largest lender, said it expects the
South African Reserve Bank to delay raising interest rates until
the third quarter of next year. The lender previously predicted
rates would begin rising in the first quarter.  The benchmark lending rate is likely to be raised by a
total of 2 percentage points by the end of 2013, or 1 percentage
point less than previously expected, analysts said in a research
note.  Forward-rate agreements starting in August next year
dropped 5.5 basis points to 5.77 percent as traders pared bets
of a central bank rate increase within the next year. The rate
has declined from a 2011 high of 7.145 percent on March 3.  To contact the reporter on this story:
