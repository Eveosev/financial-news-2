Ethanol futures gained for a fifth
day in  Chicago  as gasoline and other commodities rose amid
economic optimism.  Futures climbed 0.4 percent as equities gained and after
 Japan  said its second-quarter gross domestic product shrank less
than economists estimated. Ethanol, made from corn in the U.S.,
is blended with gasoline to stretch supply and meet federal
mandates to reduce dependence on foreign sources of crude oil.  “The energies, corn, the stock market’s higher,” said  Dan Flynn , a trader at PFG Best in Chicago. “Of course ethanol is
going to fly, too.”  Denatured ethanol for August delivery climbed 1 cent to
$2.785 a gallon on the Chicago Board of Trade. Futures are up 18
percent this year.  In cash market trading, ethanol was unchanged in  New York 
at $2.895 a gallon and in Chicago the additive increased 1 cent,
or 0.4 percent, to $2.805, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  Ethanol in the U.S. Gulf rose 0.5 cent to $2.92 a gallon
and on the West Coast the biofuel was unchanged at $2.975.  Gasoline for September delivery advanced 5.23 cents, or 1.9
percent, to settle at $2.8745 a gallon on the exchange.  Corn futures for December delivery rose 5.5 cents, or 0.8
percent, to $7.20 a bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade, after
touching $7.2425, the highest price since June 9.  U.S. and European stocks rose, erasing all of last week’s
losses for the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
