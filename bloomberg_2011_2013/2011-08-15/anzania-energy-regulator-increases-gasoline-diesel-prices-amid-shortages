Tanzania, which has experienced fuel
shortages at gas stations this month, raised the cost of
gasoline by 5.5 percent after international  oil prices  climbed
and the shilling weakened against the dollar.  Gasoline prices will increase to 2,114 shillings ($1.31)
per liter in Dar es Salaam, the commercial capital, with effect
from today, the Energy and Water Utilities Regulatory Authority
said in a statement in the Daily News newspaper. The cost of
diesel rises by 6.3 percent to 2,031 shillings and kerosene,
used as a cooking fuel and for lighting, by 5.3 percent to 2,005
shillings, it said.  “The price increases have been caused by a rise in the
petroleum-product prices in the world market and depreciation of
the Tanzania shilling compared to the  U.S. dollar ,” it said.  Motorists in Dar es Salaam have faced queues at gas
stations since Aug. 5 amid a gasoline shortage that the
regulator said was caused by fuel retailers disrupting supplies
following a price cut on Aug. 3. Last week, the regulator
suspended British Petroleum Tanzania Ltd.’s wholesale license
for three months and issued warning letters to three other
suppliers for causing the disruption.  To contact the reporter on this story:
