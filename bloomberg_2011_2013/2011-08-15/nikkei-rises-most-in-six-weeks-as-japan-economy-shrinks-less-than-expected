Japan’s Nikkei 225 Stock Average
rose the most in more than six weeks after gross domestic
product shrank less than economists expected, signaling the
country is rebounding from March’s earthquake disaster.  Toyota Motor Corp. (7203) , the world’s largest carmaker, climbed
2.9 percent after Finance Minister  Yoshihiko Noda  pledged to
take “bold action” to curb gains in the yen. Exporters
including  Sony Corp. (6758)  also got a boost after U.S. retail sales
gained the most in four months. Nintendo Co. surged 9.8 percent
on speculation the gamemaker may be included in the Nikkei 225
if  Osaka  Securities Exchange Co. merges with the Tokyo bourse.  “Investors were trying to avoid risk last week, but the
better-than-expected GDP figures, easing yen gains and better
U.S. retail sales have helped restore some calm,” said
Seiichiro Iwamoto, who helps oversee about $35 billion at Mizuho
Asset Management Co. in Tokyo. “Still, there’s no way of
knowing if this will continue. We might see some big ups and
downs in the market.”  The  Nikkei 225  rose 1.4 percent to 9,086.41 at the 3 p.m.
close in Tokyo, its biggest gain since June 29. The broader
Topix index advanced 1.2 percent to 777.12. The gauge dropped
4.1 percent last week as sentiment weakened amid signs  Europe ’s
debt crisis may spread and after  Standard & Poor’s  cut the U.S.
credit rating.  Japan GDP  The decline reduced the average price of stocks in the
Topix to 0.91 times book value, the lowest level since March
2009. A level below 1 means a company’s assets are worth more
than its market capitalization.  Gross domestic product shrank at an annualized 1.3 percent
rate for the quarter ended June 30,  Japan ’s Cabinet office said
today. The contraction was less than the median estimate of a
2.5 percent drop by 25 economists surveyed by Bloomberg News.  A magnitude-9 earthquake and tsunami devastated Japan’s
northeast coast on March 11, leaving about 20,000 people dead or
missing, causing an estimated 16.9 trillion yen ($220 billion)
in damage and triggering the world’s worst nuclear accident
since Chernobyl. Disruptions to supply chains caused exports to
plunge 18.1 percent last quarter from the previous three months
on an annualized basis, the Cabinet Office said.  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index advanced 0.9
percent today. The index gained 0.5 percent in  New York  on Aug.
12 after U.S. retail sales rose the most since March, showing
 consumer spending  in the world’s biggest economy was holding up
at the start of the third quarter.  ‘Unstable Situation’  Japanese exporters also got a boost after the yen weakened.
Japan’s finance minister said he is ready to sell the currency
again to protect the country’s exporters. The yen has gained 5
percent against the dollar in the past three months.  “An unstable situation is continuing,” Noda said during a
talk show yesterday on public television broadcaster NHK. “As
foreign-exchange market matters are my prerogative, I will
continue to closely watch the markets and take bold action if it
becomes necessary.”  Toyota, which had its operating profit cut by 50 billion
yen last quarter because of the currency’s appreciation, climbed
2.9 percent to 2,901 yen. Honda Motor Co., which counts  North
America  as its biggest market, rose 3.4 percent to 2,624 yen.
Sony, Japan’s biggest exporter of consumer electronics, advanced
3.9 percent to 1,694 yen.  The yen depreciated to 77.1 against the dollar, compared
with 76.81 at the close of  stock trading  in Tokyo on Aug. 12.
Against the euro, Japan’s currency weakened to 110.26 from
109.06. A weaker yen boosts the value of overseas income at
Japanese companies when converted into their home currency.  Nintendo, Murata  Stocks listed on the Osaka Security Exchange including
Nintendo, Murata Manufacturing Co. and  Omron Corp. (6645)  advanced
after the Yomiuri newspaper reported on Aug. 13 that Tokyo Stock
Exchange Inc. is close to reaching a takeover agreement with the
Osaka bourse. While both exchanges denied the report, it spurred
speculation some companies listed in Osaka may be included in
the Nikkei 225.  Nintendo surged 9.8 percent to 11,970 yen, the most since
November 2008. Murata Manufacturing, a Kyoto-based electronic
parts maker that supplies capacitors for Apple Inc.’s iPhone,
advanced 3 percent to 4,875 yen. Omron, which makes products
ranging from digital thermometers to ticket gate machines,
climbed 4 percent to 1,883 yen.  Isetan Mitsukoshi Holdings Ltd. (3099) , a department-store
operator, jumped 5.5 percent to 801 yen, the most on the Nikkei
225. The company boosted its full-year profit forecast by 83
percent to 33 billion yen ($428 million), citing deferred tax
assets. The company will pay an annual dividend of 10 yen per
share this year, up from the previous year’s payout of 7 yen,
according to a statement to the  Tokyo  Stock Exchange.  To contact the reporters on this story:
