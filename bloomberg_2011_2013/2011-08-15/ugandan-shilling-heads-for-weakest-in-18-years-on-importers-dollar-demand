Uganda ’s shilling, the world’s
worst-performing currency in the last month, headed for the
weakest closing level on record because of increased demand for
dollars by companies to pay for raw-material imports.  The currency of Africa’s second-biggest coffee producer
depreciated as much as 1.3 percent to 2,800 per dollar and
traded 0.9 percent down at 2,790 by 1:17 p.m. in the capital,
Kampala, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. A close at
this level would be the weakest since at least June 1993.  “We are seeing the shilling depreciating because of demand
for the dollar by manufacturers,” Faisal Bukenya, the head of
 currency trading  at  Barclays Bank  of Uganda Ltd., said by phone
from Kampala. Dollar sales by the central bank on Aug. 12 didn’t
strengthen the shilling because “there is still low donor
inflows into the country,” he said.  The currency of East  Africa ’s third-biggest economy has
depreciated 8.6 percent over the last month, and weakened 17
percent since the beginning of the year, making it the world’s
worst-performing currency against the dollar over both periods,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  A surge in food and fuel prices pushed inflation to a more
than 18-year high of 18.7 percent in July from 15.7 percent in
June.  To contact the reporter on this story:
