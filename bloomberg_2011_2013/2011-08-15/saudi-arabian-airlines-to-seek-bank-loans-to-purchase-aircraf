Saudi Arabian Airlines, the national
carrier of the kingdom, plans to obtain loans from local banks
to finance the purchase of Airbus and Boeing Co. aircraft.  “We are still in negotiations with aircraft manufacturers
Boeing and Airbus for the purchase of 50 additional planes by
the year end,” vice president of public relations Abdullah Al-
Ajhar said today in a phone interview. “The airline is also in
the process of beginning talks with local banks to secure loans
for financing.”  The carrier has also approached the government for funds,
he said, declining to provide further details. Al-Ajhar said the
airline has no plan to sell bonds or sukuk to raise money.  To contact the reporter on this story:
