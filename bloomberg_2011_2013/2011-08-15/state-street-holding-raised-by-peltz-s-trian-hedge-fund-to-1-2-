Trian Fund Management LP, the hedge
fund run by billionaire  Nelson Peltz , raised its stake in  State
Street Corp. (STT)  to 1.2 percent last quarter from 0.5 percent of
common shares outstanding three months earlier.  Trian and its affiliates held 6.1 million State Street
shares as of June 30, up from 2.3 million on March 31, according
to a Form 13F filed today with the U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission. The June 30 holdings have a market value of about
$214 million.  State Street, the Boston-based company that ranks as the
third-largest custody bank, has been cutting spending in an
attempt to minimize the impact of record low interest rates,
which reduce the return it earns on investments and lending to
institutional clients. The shares have fallen 25 percent this
year.  Trian, based in New York, also holds about 14.7 million
shares of Legg Mason Inc., a stake of almost 10 percent in the
Baltimore-based asset-management company. Trian, whose
principals also include President Peter May and Vice Chairman
Edward Garden, sometimes takes activist stakes in which it seeks
to work with management to turn companies around.  In addition to its increased State Street holdings, Trian
also reported owning 1.35 million  CoreLogic Inc. (CLGX)  shares and
699,700  Consol Energy Inc. (CNX)  shares at June 30. Neither company
was listed in Trian’s Form 13F for the first quarter. CoreLogic
is a  Santa Ana , California, real estate information company and
Consol is a Canonsburg, Pennsylvania, coal producer.  To contact the reporter on this story:
