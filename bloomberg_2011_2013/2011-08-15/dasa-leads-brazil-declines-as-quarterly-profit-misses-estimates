Diagnosticos da America SA (DASA3) , a
Brazilian medical-diagnostics firm, led declines in Sao Paulo
trading after second-quarter profit missed analysts’ estimates.  Dasa, as the company is known, slumped 4.2 percent to 17.75
reais at 4:15 p.m. New York time, the third-steepest drop on the
IBrX index of  Brazil ’s 99 most-traded stocks, which rose 2.2
percent. Dasa is down 21 percent this year, compared to 18
percent for the IBrX.  Net income fell 45 percent to 25.7 million reais ($16.1
million) from 46.8 million reais the same quarter last year, the
company said in a regulatory filing today. That compares to an
average forecast of 49.3 million reais in a Bloomberg survey of
six analysts.  “The results are weak, indicating that it is becoming
challenging for Dasa to deliver its guidance for the year,”
Rafael Frade and Carlos Firetti, analysts at Banco Bradesco SA,
wrote in a note to clients. “Dasa continues to suffer the
impact of discontinuation of some contracts in the public
segment.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
