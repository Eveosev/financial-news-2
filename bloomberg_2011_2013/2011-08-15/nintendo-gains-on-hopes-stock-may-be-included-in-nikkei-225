Nintendo Co., the world’s largest
maker of video-game players, rose the most in 33 months in Osaka
on speculation it will be included in the  Nikkei 225  Stock
Average should the city’s exchange merge with the Tokyo’s.  Nintendo rose 9.8 percent, the biggest gain since November
2008, to 11,970 yen, as of the 3:10 p.m. close on the Osaka
Securities Exchange. Murata Manufacturing Co. jumped 3 percent,
and  Omron Corp. (6645) , also listed in Osaka, advanced 4 percent.  Tokyo Stock Exchange Inc. is close to reaching a takeover
agreement with Osaka Securities Exchange Co., the Yomiuri
newspaper reported Aug. 13. Both companies denied the report.
Inclusion in the Nikkei 225 means managers of  index funds  would
have to buy the shares.  “The expectation that Nintendo and other Osaka-listed
shares would be included in the Nikkei if the two bourses manage
to merge drove the shares higher,” Toshihiko Matsuno, a senior
strategist at SMBC Friend Securities Co. in  Tokyo , said today by
phone.  Japanese exporters including Nintendo also got a boost
after the yen weakened, Matsuno said. Yoshihiko Noda,  Japan ’s
finance minister, said yesterday that he’s ready to step in
again to stem a yen advance that risks slowing the nation’s
recovery.  The yen depreciated to as weak as 77.10 against the dollar
in Tokyo trading, compared with 76.71 on Aug. 12.  To contact the reporter on this story:
