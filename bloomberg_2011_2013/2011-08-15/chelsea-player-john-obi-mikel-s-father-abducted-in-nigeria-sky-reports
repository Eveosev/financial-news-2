Chelsea soccer player John Obi
Mikel’s father has been abducted in the family’s home nation
 Nigeria ,  Sky Sports  reported.  Mikel played in yesterday’s 0-0 draw at Stoke City, the
Blues’ first league game of the season, even though he knew his
father Michael had been taken two days previously, the
broadcaster added, citing the player’s representative Sport
Entertainment and Media Group.  “SEM confirms that client John Obi Mikel’s father was
abducted in Nigeria on Friday,” SEM said, adding that no ransom
demand has been received. “Mikel was informed by his manager
prior to the Stoke v Chelsea match and decided to play so as not
to let down his team and family.”  Chelsea said everyone at the club is “very concerned” to
hear that Mikel’s father has been reported as “missing 
and possibly abducted.”  “We will give Mikel and his family our full support at
this most difficult time,” the club said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
