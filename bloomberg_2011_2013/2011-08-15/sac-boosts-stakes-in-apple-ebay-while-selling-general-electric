SAC Capital Advisors LP, the hedge
fund founded by billionaire  Steven A. Cohen , boosted stakes in
 Apple Inc. (AAPL)  and  EBay Inc. (EBAY) , while buying new positions in  Deere &
Co. (DE)  and LinkedIn Corp. during the second quarter, according to a
regulatory filing today.  SAC sold stakes in  Toyota Motor Corp. (7203)  and  Lexmark
International Inc. (LXK) , and decreased its holdings of  General
Electric Co. (GE)  and  News Corp. (NWSA)  The Stamford, Connecticut-based fund
increased its equity weighting to energy and industrial shares
by 2.7 percent and 2.6 percent respectively, and lowered
telephone and financial stocks by 2.3 percent and 1.1 percent in
the period that ended June 30.  SAC brought the stake in Apple to almost 600,000 shares --
making it the fund’s number-two holding, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. Cohen’s top position by value was in
 Dendreon Corp. (DNDN) , the maker of the prostate-cancer drug Provenge,
which earlier this month withdrew its 2011 revenue estimate and
said sales of the medicine didn’t meet projections.  Plains
Exploration & Production Co. (PXP)  and  Suncor Energy Inc. (SU)  were the
next two most-valuable stakes, the Bloomberg data show.  The fund also bought new stakes in J.C. Penney Co., the
third-biggest U.S. department-store chain, and  Clorox Co. (CLX) , while
selling all its shares in biotechnology company Genzyme Corp.
and paring its stake in  Newmont Mining Corp. (NEM)   To contact the reporter on this story:
