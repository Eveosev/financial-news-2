Vietnam Oil & Gas Group, a state-
owned oil producer, is targeting average earnings growth of 18
percent to 20 percent a year through 2015.  PetroVietnam, as the company is known, is also targeting to
produce 23 million to 24 million metric tons of crude oil
annually during the period, according to a statement on the
government’s website that cited a plan approved by Prime
Minister Nguyen Tan Dung.  The Hanoi-based company also aims to meet as much as 60
percent of domestic demand for petroleum products during the
period, with refining capacity of about 16 million to 17 million
tons a year, according to the statement.  The oil producer expects to put three ethanol plants into
“stable” operation to ensure output of ethanol products by
2012, according to the statement.  --Nguyen Kieu Giang in  Hanoi . Editor: Ryan Woo.  To contact Bloomberg News staff on this story:
