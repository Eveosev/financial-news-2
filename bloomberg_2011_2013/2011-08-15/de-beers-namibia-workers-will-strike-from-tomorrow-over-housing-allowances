Namdeb , a diamond-mining venture
between  De Beers  and the government of  Namibia , said workers
plan to start a strike tomorrow over housing allowances.  The Mineworkers Union of Namibia notified the company of
its intention to begin industrial action tomorrow morning,
Pauline Thomas, Namdeb’s brand manager, said today in an e-
mailed statement. “The principle of No Work No Pay will apply
as per the Labor Act,” she said.  The dispute was initiated by 124 miners who lost housing
allowances earlier this year when they were relocated from the
halted Bogenfels mine to new sites. The union has urged Namdeb
to maintain housing benefits for all its workers, while the
company says Bogenfels miners only received the benefits because
of the project’s remote location in the coastal Namib Desert.  While Namdeb says only the 124 affected miners may walk
out, the union last week rallied the entire workforce to join
the stoppage. The industrial action is illegal because some
employees have been forced to participate, Thomas said.  “Namdeb is committed to minimizing the impact of
unemployment following the closure of any of our operations,”
Thomas said. “Alternative positions were sourced for all
affected Bogenfels employees within current operational areas.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
