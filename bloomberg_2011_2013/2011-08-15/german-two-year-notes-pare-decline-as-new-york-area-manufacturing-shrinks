German two-year notes pared a drop
and 10-year bonds rose after a report showed manufacturing in
the  New York  region unexpectedly contracted for a third straight
month in August.  The yield on the two-year securities was one basis point
higher at 0.70 percent as of 1:34 p.m. in  London , after climbing
to 0.74 percent earlier. The 10-year bund yield fell two basis
points to 2.32 percent.  The Federal Reserve Bank of New Yorkâ€™s general economic
index fell to minus 7.7 from minus 3.8 in July, a report showed
today. The median forecast in a Bloomberg survey called for an
index of zero, the dividing line between expansion and
contraction.  To contact the reporter on this story:
