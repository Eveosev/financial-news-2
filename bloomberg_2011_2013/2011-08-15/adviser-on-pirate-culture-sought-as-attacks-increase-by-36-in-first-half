The European Union Naval Force, or
EUNavfor, is seeking to recruit an adviser on pirate culture
after attacks jumped 36 percent in the first half of the year,
according to a notice posted on its website.  The person will advise the operational commander on
“pirate culture, business model and modus operandi in the
 Indian Ocean ,” according to the notice.  Several dozen anti-piracy ships are deployed daily in the
region around the Horn of  Africa  by groups including the
European Union and North Atlantic Treaty Organization. Attacks
reached 266 globally in the first half, more than 60 percent of
them carried out by Somali pirates, the London-based
International Maritime Bureau reported in July.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
