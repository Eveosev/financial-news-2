Former  Brocade Communications
Systems Inc. (BRCD)  Chief Executive Officer Greg Reyes, convicted of
securities fraud for backdating employee stock-option grants,
agreed to pay $845,251 to resolve a regulator’s lawsuit.  The settlement with the U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission, if approved by a judge, would resolve the agency’s
case “in its entirety,” SEC Assistant Regional Director Robert
Leach said in a filing today in  San Francisco  federal court.  The amount includes a $550,000 fine and $295,251 in
disgorgement and interest, the filing said. Reyes also agreed
not to violate securities laws, according to a filing signed by
his attorney Neal Stephens.  Reyes was found guilty of securities fraud and other
charges last year at his second trial stemming from stock-
options manipulation at  San Jose , California-based Brocade, the
biggest maker of switches for data-storage networks. He was
sentenced to 18 months in prison.  Stephens and Leach didn’t return voice-mail messages
seeking comment on the settlement.  The case is SEC v. Reyes, 06-4435, U.S. District Court,
Northern District of  California  (San Francisco).  To contact the reporters on this story:
