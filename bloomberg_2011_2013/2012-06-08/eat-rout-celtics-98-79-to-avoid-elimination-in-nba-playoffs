LeBron James  scored 45 points and had
15 rebounds as the  Miami Heat  handed the Boston Celtics a 98-79
home drubbing to force a decisive seventh game in the National
Basketball Association Eastern Conference finals.  The series will conclude tomorrow in Miami, with the winner
advancing to face the Oklahoma City Thunder in the NBA Finals.  “We’re not going to celebrate this win, we had to win this
game,” James said in a televised interview. “The series is a
one-game series now and it’s in our building.”  James scored 30 first-half points as the Heat led 55-42 at
the intermission at TD Garden in Boston last night. James’s
layup with seven minutes, 15 seconds remaining in the game gave
Miami its largest lead at 89-64.  “I was glad to get this win and force a Game 7,” James
said. “I just do what I’ve been taught -- to play at a high
level and have fun at it.”  Dwyane Wade  scored 17 points and  Chris Bosh  added seven
points in 28 minutes for the Heat. It was Bosh’s second game
back after missing nine playoff contests with a strained lower
abdominal muscle.  “Whatever I needed to do on this floor, I tried to be
there,” James said.  Rajon Rondo led the Celtics with 21 points and 10 assists,
while  Brandon Bass  and  Kevin Garnett  each added 12 points for
Boston, which converted one of 14 3-point attempts. The Heat
went 7-of-16 on 3-pointers to end a run of three straight
defeats in the series.  The Thunder will host the first two games in the NBA
Finals, on June 12 and 14.  To contact the reporter on this story:
