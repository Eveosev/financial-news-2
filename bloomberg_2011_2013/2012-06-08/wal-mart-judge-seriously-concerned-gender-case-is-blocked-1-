Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (WMT)  may be able to
block a discrimination suit brought by 45,000 female employees
in  California  because of an earlier U.S.  Supreme Court  ruling in
the retailer’s favor in a broader case, a judge said.  U.S. District Judge Charles Breyer in San Francisco said at
a hearing today that he’s “seriously concerned” that lawyers
for the women haven’t shown enough evidence to allow the group,
or class action, complaint filed in October to proceed. The
judge said he’ll review the matter and issue a ruling later.  A group of more than 1 million women across the U.S. were
barred from proceeding with their discrimination claims in a
single lawsuit when the Supreme Court ruled last June that the
plaintiffs failed to prove the world’s largest retailer had a
nationwide policy that led to gender discrimination.  Lawyers for the women filed new lawsuits, narrowing
plaintiff groups to workers in California and Texas,
after the Supreme Court threw out the lawsuit involving a
nationwide group.  The California case is Dukes v. Wal-Mart Stores Inc., 01-
cv-02252, U.S. District Court, Northern District of California
( San Francisco ). The Supreme Court case is Wal-Mart v. Dukes,
10-00277, U.S. Supreme Court (Washington).  To contact the reporter on this story:
