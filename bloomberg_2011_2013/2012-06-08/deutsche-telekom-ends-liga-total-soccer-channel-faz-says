Deutsche Telekom AG (DTE)  will end its
“Liga Total” soccer channel after  Sky Deutschland AG (SKYD)  won an
auction of  broadcasting rights for the soccer matches of
 Germany ’s Bundesliga,  Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung  reported,
without saying where it got the information.  The channel will only be active for the next season, FAZ
said. Deutsche Telekom management board member Niek Jan van
Damme assumes the company will reach a “negotiated decision”
with Sky and will use a Sky feed from 2013, he told the German
newspaper.  To contact the reporter on this story:
