Global standards to identify parties
in financial trades should be in place by March next year, the
 Financial Stability Board  said today.  “This system would be a building block for many financial
stability and regulatory objectives, and it would deliver
substantial benefits to financial firms,” FSB Chairman  Mark Carney  said in an e-mailed statement.  The lack of global standard practices for capturing data
prevents financial institutions from producing timely and
accurate assessments of their risk management,  Bank of England 
official  Andrew Haldane  said in a speech in March. He said
Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. mistakenly excluded a $6 billion
real-estate exposure in reports to its board months before its
collapse.  The FSB, based in  Basel , Switzerland brings together
global regulators and central bankers. It proposed a system for
identifying financial counterparties in transactions which would
include a 20-character alphanumeric code and the official name
and address of the legal entity involved.  The March 2013 implementation date is “ambitious,” the
FSB said in its report, and “will require high level political
support and strong engagement and co-operation with a wide range
of private sector stakeholders.”  The FSB proposed a three-tiered system, consisting of a
central oversight committee, an organization to develop detailed
standards and a network of national bodies to implement the
rules.  To contact the reporter on this story:
