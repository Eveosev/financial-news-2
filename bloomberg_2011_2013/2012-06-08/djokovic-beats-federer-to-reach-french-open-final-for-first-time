Top-ranked Novak Djokovic defeated
 Roger Federer  to reach the final of tennis’s French Open as he
attempts to hold the sports four major titles at the same time.  The Serb won 6-4, 7-5, 6-3. He’ll face six-time Roland
Garros champion  Rafael Nadal  in two days.   The second set was pivotal, as Federer got two early breaks
to go up 3-0. Djokovic came back to tie the set 4-4, only for
Federer to break again. Djokovic broke back and took his first
lead of the set at 6-5. Federer had won 14 of the 25 times they
played before today, although Djokovic had won five of their 
last six matches.  Djokovic, 25, will play in his first final at  Roland
Garros . Federer, 30, won the title in 2009, one of his men’s
record 16 Grand Slam championships.  Nadal defeated fellow Spaniard David Ferrer 6-2, 6-2, 6-1.
The defending French Open champion is going for a men’s record
seventh title on the clay courts of Paris.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
