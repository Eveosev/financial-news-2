Warren Buffett’s lunch auction, an
annual fundraiser for the Glide Foundation in San Francisco,
raised a record $3.46 million as online bidding nearly tripled
the price in the last minute of the weeklong event.  The auction on  EBay Inc. (EBAY) ’s  website  attracted 106 bids. The
winner, who wasn’t immediately identified, and seven companions
get to dine with Buffett at the Smith & Wollensky steakhouse in
 New York . Bidding stood at $1.23 million about 30 seconds before
the auction ended last night, according to EBay.  The event has brought in more than $14.6 million in 13
years for Glide, which serves meals to the needy and runs a
church in San Francisco’s  blighted  Tenderloin district. The
billionaire investor was introduced to the Rev. Cecil Williams,
the founder of Glide, by his first wife,  Susan Buffett , a
volunteer for the charity who died in 2004.  “We met at Glide,” Williams, 82, said of Buffett at a
gathering to watch auction results last night in San Francisco.
“He just said, ‘I haven’t seen anything like this.’”  Buffett is chairman and chief executive officer of Omaha,
Nebraska-based  Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (BRK/A)  He earned his fortune and
reputation investing in out-of-favor stocks, transforming his
firm from a failing textile mill into a $200 billion seller of
insurance, energy and freight hauling. He has pledged almost all
of his wealth to charity.  “I was suspicious when I heard my wife raving about this
place in San Francisco,” Buffett, 81, said in a video posted on
the auction website. “What I witnessed was an institution and
an individual that really gave up on nobody. They took the
people that the rest of the world had forgotten, people who’d
given up on themselves, and they felt that every human being had
a potential.”  The past two auctions were won by Ted Weschler, who was
subsequently hired by Buffett last year to help oversee
Berkshire’s investments.  Glide Lunch With  Warren Buffett  Results:  Year  Winner                                        Winning Bid
