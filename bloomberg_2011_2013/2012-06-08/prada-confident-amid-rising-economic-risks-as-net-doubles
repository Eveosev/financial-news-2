Prada SpA (1913) , the Italian fashion
company that owns the Miu Miu and Church’s brands, jumped in
 Hong Kong  trading after it reported first-quarter profit more
than doubled.  The stock jumped 7.9 percent to HK$49.05 at the close of
Hong Kong trading, the biggest gain since May 22. The city’s
benchmark  Hang Seng Index  declined 0.94 percent.  Net income at the maker of $2,950 perforated patent-leather
handbags rose to 121.7 million euros ($152 million) in the three
months ended April 30, from 57.7 million euros a year earlier,
the Milan-based company said yesterday. Revenue climbed 48
percent to 686.7 million euros.  Europe’s sovereign-debt crisis and slowing economic growth
in  China  have so far failed to reduce demand for high-end goods.
Prada joins Paris-based  LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton SA (MC)  in
posting higher revenue, with the world’s largest maker of luxury
products saying in April that sales growth was accelerating.  “Prada delivered a set of goods results despite uncertain
macro conditions, demonstrating brand strength and the
resilience of handbags,” Candy Huang, an analyst at Barclays
Plc in Hong Kong, wrote in a note to clients. Barclays raised
its 12-month price estimate to HK$65 from HK$60 and maintained
an “overweight” rating after the earnings announcement.  Prada’s  revenue  increased in all regions during the
quarter, including 34 percent in the Americas and 54 percent in
each of Greater China and  Italy . Sales climbed 57 percent in
Europe and 47 percent in the Asia-Pacific region. Leather goods
was Prada’s best-performing category.  Retail sales climbed 49 percent on a reported basis and 19
percent at stores open at least a year, excluding currency
swings.  To contact the reporters on this story:
