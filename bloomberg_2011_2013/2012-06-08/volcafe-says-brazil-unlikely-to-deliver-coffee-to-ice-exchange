Coffee producers in  Brazil , the
world’s largest grower, are unlikely to make substantial
deliveries to ICE Futures U.S. because the exchange will apply a
discount to their beans, according to Volcafe.  ICE, where arabica coffee trades in New York, will start
accepting delivery of Brazilian beans as of next March. A 9
cent-a-pound discount will apply to coffee from the South
American nation, the biggest among origins accepted by the
exchange, according to ICE’s  website . The exchange began grading
coffee from Brazil this month.  Brazilian coffee would have to sell in the physical market
at a discount of 16 cents a pound or more to the exchange price
for delivery to ICE to be profitable for sellers, Volcafe, a
unit of ED&F Man Holdings Ltd., said in a report e-mailed today.  Beans from the 2012-13 crop now under way were trading at a
discount of 5 cents a pound that’s already a “soft” price not
seen since summer 2009, the Winterthur, Switzerland-based trader
said. “So we have some way to go,” Volcafe said, adding that
chances of large deliveries to the exchange were “fair to
low.”  Beans from  Colombia , the second-biggest arabica grower,
were selling at the exchange price, while coffee from  India  to
 Ecuador  incurred discounts of 2 cents to 4 cents a pound,
depending on origin.  To contact the reporter on this story:
