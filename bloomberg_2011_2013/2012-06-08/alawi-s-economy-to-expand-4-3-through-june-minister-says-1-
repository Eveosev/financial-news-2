Malawi’s economy will probably expand
4.3 percent this fiscal year, with reduced farming production,
power outages and a shortage of foreign currency the main risks
to growth, Finance Minister Ken Lipenga said.  The expansion is forecast to accelerate to 5.7 percent next
year, Lipenga said in a budget speech today in Lilongwe, the
capital.  The southern African nation will record a budget deficit of
13.5 billion kwacha ($50 million) with total revenue, including
grants, rising 20 percent to 394.5 billion kwacha in the year
through June 2013, he said.  The deficit will be entirely financed from foreign grants
and loans, “reflecting our main fiscal anchor of no net
domestic financing,” Lipenga said.  He also announced the removal of price controls and
subsidies on fuel and utilities. “This is an austerity budget
and some of the reforms implemented will be painful, but these
are required to put the economy onto a path of sustainable
growth,” Lipenga said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
