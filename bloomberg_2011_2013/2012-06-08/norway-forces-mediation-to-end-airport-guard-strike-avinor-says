Norway’s government called a forced
mediation to end the security guard strike that had shut
airports and threatened oil and gas output, the country’s
airport operator said.  The government called both parties in for forced salary
mediation to end the conflict, Avinor, the state-owned airport
company, said in a statement on its website. The strike had shut
airports and risked curtailing production from the country’s
offshore oil and gas fields.  As of tomorrow morning there will be full capacity at the
security controls at the 14 airports that had been hurt by the
strike, Avinor said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
