Colombia ’s oil output rose to 936,052
barrels a day in May, up 1 percent from the same month a year
earlier, Mines and Energy Minister  Mauricio Cardenas  told
reporters today in Cartagena.  May output was hampered by infrastructure and transport
difficulties, particularly in the Transandino pipeline, the
Mines and Energy Ministry said today in an e-mailed statement.  Colombia is  South America ’s third-largest oil producer
behind Brazil and  Venezuela .  To contact the reporter on this story:
