British consumers’ expectations for
inflation rose last month and a measure of their satisfaction
with the  Bank of England  dropped close to the lowest on record.  Consumers anticipated prices to increase 3.7 percent in the
coming 12 months, up from 3.5 percent in February, the Bank of
England said in a quarterly survey published in  London  today.
Net satisfaction with the central bank fell to 11 percent from
20 percent in the prior report.  Inflation slowed to 3 percent in April, the first reading
within the government’s limit since February 2010. The central
bank’s forecasts last month showed the rate will stay above its
2 percent target for longer than officials predicted in
February, though it will ease as growth struggles to pick up.  The bank’s Monetary Policy Committee held their bond-
purchase plan at 325 billion pounds ($503 billion) yesterday,
and kept their benchmark interest rate at a record low of 0.5
percent, as forecast in two Bloomberg News surveys. Officials
will publish the minutes of the decision on June 20.  Expectations for longer-term inflation also increased.
Consumers predicted prices to rise an annual 3.6 percent in five
years, the highest since the question was first posed in 2009.  Net satisfaction with the way the bank is “doing its job
to set  interest rates  to control inflation” is measured by
taking the balance of those satisfied minus those dissatisfied.
The reading was close to the 9 percent reached in November, the
lowest since the survey began 1999.  The poll of 1,966 people aged 16 or over was conducted by
GfK NOP Ltd. from May 17 to May 22.  To contact the reporter on this story:
