Fitch Ratings  downgraded 234 tranches
of Spanish asset-backed securitizations after cutting the nation
to within two steps of junk.  Among the deals Fitch downgraded were 150 residential
mortgage-backed securities and three commercial MBS, the New
York-based ratings company said today.  Fitch downgraded Spain by three levels to BBB yesterday,
saying the cost to the government of restructuring the country’s
banking system may be as high as 100 billion euros ($125
billion), compared with a previous estimate of about 30 billion
euros. Spain’s economy is set to remain in recession through
2013, the ratings company said, having earlier forecast a
recovery for next year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
