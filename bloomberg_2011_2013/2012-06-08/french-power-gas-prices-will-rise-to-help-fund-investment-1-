French power and natural- gas prices 
will increase to help fund investment by the industry, Ecology,
 Sustainable Development  and Energy Minister Nicole Bricq said.  “Prices will rise because there is enormous investment
that has to be made,” Bricq said on Public Senat television,
declining to say whether gains will be from July 1. “I won’t
confirm because I haven’t looked at the files or decided.”  Electricite de France SA and  GDF Suez (GSZ)  SA’s household rates
are set by the state. GDF Suez last year won a 4.4 percent gain
from Jan. 1 after challenging a government decision to freeze
gas prices in the country’s highest court. Changes to power
prices are typically introduced during France’s summer months.  “I know there is a strong trend for costs of energy to
increase,” Bricq said today. “Even if we make new  fossil fuel 
finds, they will be expensive and in electricity there is huge
investment to be made to ensure grid quality.”  At least half a million households had power or natural gas
supply cut off or reduced last year because they couldn’t pay
their bills, the energy ombudsman said in March. A spokesman for
Paris-based GDF Suez declined to comment today on gas prices.  France has to find a way to make energy more affordable for
people on low incomes, Bricq said. “We have to find calculation
methods that would penalize less those who use less,” she said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
