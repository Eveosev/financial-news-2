State Oil Co. (ATPG)  of  Azerbaijan  drilled a
second well at the Caspian natural-gas field of Umid to produce
a daily 1.2 million cubic meters of gas and 150 metric tons of
condensate, the Baku-based company said on its website.  “Information obtained from the well once again showed that
the Umid field contains large reserves,” the national energy
producer said.  Socar reported the discovery of the deposit about 40
kilometers (25 miles) off the Azerbaijani coast in November
2010. It may contain 200 billion cubic meters of gas and 40
million tons of condensate, according to company estimates.  Azerbaijan last year produced 25.8 billion cubic meters of
gas, mostly from the BP Plc-led Shah Deniz field. The third-
largest oil producer in the former  Soviet Union  also pumped 45.6
million tons of oil.  To contact the reporter on this story:
