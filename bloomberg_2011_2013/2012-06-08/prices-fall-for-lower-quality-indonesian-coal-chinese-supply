Thermal-coal swap contracts for
 Indonesia , the world’s biggest exporter of the fuel, fell
yesterday, according to Ginga Petroleum Singapore Pte. China
prices also dropped.  The price for sub-bituminous coal with a heating value of
4,900 kilocalories a kilogram for loading in July from Indonesia
was 10 cents lower at $66.90 a metric ton on a net as-received
basis, the energy broker said in an e-mail today. The contract
for the third quarter fell $1.75. or 2.6 percent, to $65.25.  Coal with a calorific value of 5,500 kilocalories a
kilogram for shipments to South China for July was down 25 cents
to $90.25 a ton on a net as-received basis, Ginga said. The swap
for the third quarter was 25 cents lower at the same price.  A commodity swap is a financial agreement whereby a
floating price is exchanged for a fixed rate over a specified
contract period.  About 60 percent of Indonesia’s coal is classified as sub-
bituminous. The grade is typically softer, with a dull, earthy
appearance, according to the London-based World Coal Association.
Higher moisture levels and a lower carbon content reduce the
heating value compared with grades with a better quality stock.
Sub-bit coal has kilocalories of less than 6,100 per kilogram,
according to the Indonesian energy ministry.  To contact the reporter on this story:
