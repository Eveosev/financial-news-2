Gates Corp., a U.S. maker producer of
rubber belts for the automotive industry, applied to the
Leningrad regional government to build a factory near St.
Petersburg,  Russia .  Gates is looking for as much as 10,000 square meters (2.5
acres) for a plant to make automotive belts, said Alexander
Butenin, a spokesman for Leningrad’s regional committee for
economic development. The Denver-based company hasn’t disclosed
more detail so far, he said.  The five automotive plants that operate in St. Petersburg
and the surrounding Leningrad region -- the Ford-Sollers joint
venture,  Toyota Motor Co. (7203) ,  Nissan Motor Co. (7201) ,  General Motors (GM)  Co.
and  Hyundai Motor Co. (005380)  -- produced 123,400 cars in the first four
months, 6 percent more than in the same period a year earlier,
according to AutoDealer-SPb, an automotive research
organization.  To contact the reporter on this story:
