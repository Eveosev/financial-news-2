Lululemon Athletica Inc. (LULU)   put volume 
surged to a record the day before the yoga-wear retailer issued
a disappointing earnings estimate, giving one trader a paper
profit of $2.42 million.  More than 64,000 bearish contracts traded on June 6, hours
before the company said sales and profit would trail analyst
forecasts. An investor bought 10,000 June $67.50 puts and sold
the same number of June $60 puts, according to OptionsHawk.com
and Trade Alert LLC. The position cost about $1.3 million and
was worth $3.72 million as of yesterday’s close, up 186 percent,
data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Lululemon’s 8.8 percent  decline  yesterday was the biggest
since August. Before the report, the Vancouver-based seller of
products such as $118 yoga pants  traded  for 51 times reported
earnings, almost three times as much as the Standard & Poor’s
500 Index. The stock retreated at least 4.6 percent following
two of its previous three quarterly reports.  “The trade in Lululemon was clearly a well-timed strategy
into earnings,” Joe Kunkle, founder of Boston-based
OptionsHawk.com, said in an e-mail yesterday. “Although the
natural reaction is to jump to the conclusion that this was
 insider trading , to me it was just a well-executed trade, and
provided a nice tell to those of us that follow large
institutional trades in the options market.”  Sari Martin, an external spokeswoman for Lululemon,
declined to comment on the options trading.  Tiffany’s Example  Tiffany & Co. (TIF) , the world’s second-largest luxury jewelry
retailer, declined the most in four months on May 24 after
cutting its full-year profit and sales forecasts as smaller Wall
Street bonuses and restrained spending from European tourists
hurt sales growth in the U.S.  That concern wasn’t reflected in analyst projections prior
to the earnings release from Lululemon, which made 54 percent of
its  sales  in the U.S. during the last fiscal year. The company’s
revenue has more than doubled in the past two years as its
workout apparel attracted customers willing to pay premium
prices for its products.  The average analyst  estimates  for Lululemon’s full-year
revenue and profit have been almost unchanged since the end of
March at $1.35 billion and $1.63 a share, respectively,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  “Drop a guidance bomb into a market not in love with
luxury names, no matter if you normally guide conservatively,
your stock will get smashed,”  Brian Sozzi , an independent
analyst in New York, wrote in a note published yesterday after
the earnings report. He recommended on May 23 that investors
sell the stock, which is also his current rating. “I would
still follow the suggestion given pre-earnings on Lululemon,
avoid the stock.”  Profit, Revenue  The $1.3 million options trade turned profitable after
Lululemon said yesterday that this year’s profit will be no more
than $1.60 a share, less than the average of 24 analyst
 estimates  compiled by Bloomberg. Revenue for the year will total
as much as $1.34 billion, also trailing the average of analysts’
estimates.  The shares had gained 50 percent in 2012 to $70.02 through
June 6. The company closed at $63.84 yesterday.  The trader spent $1.81 million for 10,000 June $67.50 puts
by 11:30 a.m  New York  time on June 6, giving the right to sell
Lululemon shares at that price, according to Trade Alert, a New
York-based provider of options-market data. The investor then
sold 10,000 June $60 puts for about $510,000, the data show.
Buying a spread rather than simply purchasing put options cuts
the cost of the trade while capping the potential profit.  Spread Trade  The price of the June $67.50 put option soared to $4.30
yesterday, while the June $60 contract closed at 58 cents, data
compiled by Bloomberg show. The value of the spread trade was
$3.72, which is equivalent to a profit of $2.42 per spread or
$2.42 million in total if the trader exited the position
yesterday.  “It was a very short-term bearish trade, probably on
concerns about the earnings report,” Frederic Ruffy, a senior
options strategist at WhatsTrading.com, said in a phone
interview yesterday. “It can either have been initiated to
hedge a stock position or as a straight bearish bet.”  Put volume jumped to a  record  64,758 on June 6, almost
eight times more than the average for the previous 20 trading
days and almost three times the number of calls, data compiled
by Bloomberg show. The six contracts that changed hands the most
were puts, led by June $67.50 puts and June $60 puts. Ownership
of June $67.50 puts increased by 12,276 contracts, while June
$60 puts gained 11,903 contracts, the data show.  Calls Sink  Bullish Lululemon options had some of the biggest losses in
the U.S. stock options market yesterday, with June $72.50 calls
expiring today tumbling to 1 cent from $1.96 on June 6. Weekly
June $70 calls plunged to 2 cents from $3.15, while June $67.50
calls fell to 4 cents from $4.60, the data show.  The Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility Index, known
as the  VIX (VIX) , slipped 2 percent to 21.72 yesterday. Its European
counterpart, the VStoxx Index, a measure of Euro Stoxx 50 Index
option prices, rose 0.3 percent to 31.53 at 9:57 a.m. in
 Frankfurt  today.  Options traders have been boosting bearish bets. Since its
March 23 low, the ratio of outstanding puts to sell Lululemon
versus calls to buy  climbed  84 percent to 1.07-to-1 on June 5,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  “Props to the buyer of the large put-spread on
Lululemon,” Caitlin Duffy, an options analyst at Greenwich,
Connecticut-based Interactive Brokers Group Inc., said via e-
mail yesterday. “The sharp pullback in shares of the athletic
apparel retailer on full-year earnings and revenue forecasts
that missed consensus estimates saw the value of the bearish
spread spike.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
