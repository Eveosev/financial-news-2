More than half of Greeks, or 54
percent, said the next government will be able to re-negotiate
the terms of the country’s bailout agreement, a poll showed.  About 58 percent of interviewees expect that  Greece  will
need more than four years of harsh austerity measures, according
to a survey of 1,028 Greeks by the Hellenic Polling Company for
the  Friday-13  newspaper published today.  The next government in Greece, which will hold a general
election on June 17, has three main priorities: combating
recession with measures to boost growth, cutting unemployment
and ensuring the provision of  health services , according to the
poll results.  Greece’s economy shrank 6.5 percent in the first quarter
this year compared with the same period a year earlier, the
Hellenic Statistical Authority said today. The  Greek economy 
will contract 5.3 percent in 2012, the Organization for Economic
Cooperation and Development said May 22. Unemployment in Greece
stood at 21.9 percent in March.  Almost one in two Greeks, or 48 percent, said the best way
to combat crime in Greece is to improve policing while 45
percent said the best way to deal with immigration is to expel
all illegal immigrants, the poll showed.  The poll was conducted on June 5 and June 6 and had a
margin of error of 2.8 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
