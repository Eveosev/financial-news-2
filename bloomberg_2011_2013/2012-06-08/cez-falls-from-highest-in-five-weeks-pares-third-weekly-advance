CEZ AS (CEZ) , the biggest Czech utility,
fell from a five-week high, paring its third week of gains as
the price of electricity fell to the lowest in 19 months.  The stock fell 1.4 percent to 742.5 koruna by 3:20 p.m. in
Prague, reducing this weekâ€™s advance to 1.6 percent after being
unchanged yesterday. CEZ rose 3 percent in the three days ending
June 6 to the highest price since April 30.  Next-year power in  Germany , where CEZ exports part of its
output, slid 0.4 percent to 48.10 euros per megawatt-hour, the
lowest since November 2010. Global stocks and oil fell and the
euro weakened as German exports and Italian industrial output
shrank while policy makers damped expectations for monetary
stimulus.  To contact the reporter on this story:
