Bank  St. Petersburg ’s first-quarter
profit slumped 94 percent because of rising provisions on bad
loans and higher interest expenses.  Net income dropped to 123.3 million rubles ($3.8 million)
from 2.09 billion rubles a year earlier, the lender based in
 Russia ’s second-biggest city said today on its website.  The share of overdue loans to total lending expanded to 6
percent from 5.7 percent at the start of the year, Bank St.
Petersburg said.  “Since last autumn, the negative impact of external
factors on the Russian economy and banking sector has increased
significantly,” Alexander Savelyev, chairman of the bank’s
board, said in the statement. “As a result, the increase in
cost of funding puts more pressure on a margin than we
forecast.”  The lender’s  share price  slumped as much as 3.1 percent and
was down 2.5 percent to 55.65 rubles at 1:01 p.m. in Moscow.  To contact the reporter on this story:
