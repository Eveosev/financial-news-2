(Corrects percentage change in gasoline price in first
paragraph of story published June 7.)  Vietnam  cut fuel costs for the third
time in a month, lowering gasoline by 3.5 percent, as policy
makers pass on lower world prices to domestic consumers in a bid
to contain inflation and counter slowing economic growth.  The cost of 92-RON gasoline, the most commonly used fuel
grade in Vietnam, was lowered to 21,900 dong ($1.04) a liter
from 22,700 dong, the  Ministry of Finance  said in an e-mailed
statement. Diesel was reduced to 20,500 dong per liter from
21,200 dong.  Fuel oil  was reduced to 18,250 dong per kilogram
from 18,900 dong, while kerosene was lowered to 20,400 per liter
from 21,100 dong. The new prices took effect from 2 p.m. today,
according to the statement.  Crude prices have fallen 5.3 percent since May 23, when
Vietnam last cut petroleum prices, amid concerns that  Europe ’s
debt crisis and weaker-than-expected Chinese manufacturing could
dent demand. Lower fuel costs may help aid an economy that grew
at 4 percent in the first quarter, the  slowest  pace since 2009.
Vietnam’s  inflation  rate slowed to 8.34 percent in May from
23.02 percent in August 2011.  “We saw Vietnam’s growth slowing very sharply,”
Singapore-based Vishnu Varathan, market economist at  Mizuho
Corporate Bank , said by telephone. “Trying to relieve the
pressure on consumers as well as business can only be a good
thing.”  Brent crude , used to price more than half the world’s oil,
rose as much as 20 percent this year, amid speculation that
Western sanctions aimed at halting  Iran’s nuclear program  will
disrupt Middle East shipments. Brent for July settlement fell as
much as $1.02 to $99.62 a barrel on the London ICE Futures
exchange as of 3:50 p.m. in Hanoi.  To contact the reporters on this story:
