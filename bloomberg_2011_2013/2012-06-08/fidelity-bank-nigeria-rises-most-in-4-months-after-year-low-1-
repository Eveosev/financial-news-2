Fidelity Bank Plc (FIDELITY) , a Nigerian lender,
climbed the most in more than four months, rebounding from the
lowest this year.  The stock rose by the daily limit of 5 percent to close at
1.26 naira in Lagos, the commercial capital. The stock traded at
1.20 naira on June 6, the lowest since Dec. 8.  “The current prices present an opportunity for a technical
investor to come in because the stock is trading at the lower
end of its price range this year,” Adesoji Solanke, a Lagos-
based Africa bank analyst at  Renaissance Capital , said by phone
today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
