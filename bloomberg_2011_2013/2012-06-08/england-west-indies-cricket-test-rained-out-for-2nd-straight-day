Rain washed out the start of the
third cricket Test between  England  and West Indies for a second
straight day.  The decision to abandon play at Edgbaston in Birmingham
came about 2 p.m. local time, about an hour earlier than
yesterday. No coin toss has taken place and neither side has
named its team.  England has already clinched a series victory by winning
the first two matches.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
