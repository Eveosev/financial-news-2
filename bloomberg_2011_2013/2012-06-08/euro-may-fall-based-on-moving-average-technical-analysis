The euro may fall in the coming days
to $1.2464, its 200-hour moving average, according to  Australia
& New Zealand Banking Group Ltd. (ANZ) , citing trading patterns.  The 17-nation euro may be poised for a downward
“correction” after failing to rise to $1.2667 yesterday, said
Alex Sinton, director for institutional foreign exchange at ANZ
Bank. That is near the euro’s 38.2 percent retracement from its
May 1 high of $1.3284 to the June 1 low of $1.2288 on the
Fibonacci chart, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  “With the euro correcting from the recent spike up, I
would expect it to fall further,” said Sinton. “The corrective
move I would have liked to have seen in the recent rally would
have been around $1.2667. We didn’t see it as far as that. The
euro might peter out at the moment and fall.”  The euro slid 0.3 percent to $1.2524 as of 6:27 a.m. in
 London  from yesterday, when it touched $1.2625, matching the
highest since May 23. The shared currency is poised for a 0.7
percent advance since June 1.  In technical analysis, investors and analysts study charts
of trading patterns to forecast changes in a security,
commodity, currency or index. Fibonacci analysis is based on the
theory that prices rise or fall by certain percentages after
reaching a new high or low.  To contact the reporters on this story:
