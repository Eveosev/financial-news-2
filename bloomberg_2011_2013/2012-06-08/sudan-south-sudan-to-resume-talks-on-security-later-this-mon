Sudan  and  South Sudan  will resume
negotiations this month on border security after failing to
agree on the boundaries of a demilitarized zone during talks in
Ethiopia’s capital, a South Sudanese minister said.  Officials from Khartoum, the north’s capital, refused
international arbitration of a security border, Cabinet Affairs
Minister Deng Alor told reporters today in Addis Ababa, the
Ethiopian capital where the discussions are being held.  “We can agree if there’s commitment by the north to
international arbitration,” he said. “They said no.” The two
sides may be forced to accept a border map proposed by mediators
after rejecting each other’s versions, Alor said.  Officials from Sudan and South Sudan began meeting on May
29 in the Ethiopian capital, Addis Ababa, to negotiate accords
on issues outstanding since the South declared independence on
July 9. Points of contention include the status of Abyei, border
demarcation and fees South Sudan should pay to export its oil
through pipelines and processing facilities in Sudan.  To contact the reporter on this story:
