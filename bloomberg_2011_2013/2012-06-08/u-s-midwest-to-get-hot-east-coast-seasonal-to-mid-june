The Midwest may have another round of
heat by the middle of June while temperatures are closer to
seasonal for the large cities of the East Coast.  Average temperatures from  North Dakota  to Kansas and east
to Iowa and parts of Wisconsin may reach 5 to 8 degrees
Fahrenheit (2.8 to 4.4 Celsius) above normal from June 13 to
June 17, said  Matt Rogers , president of Commodity Weather Group
LLC in Bethesda, Maryland.  The warmer-than-normal weather is expected to drift
eastward into the Great Lakes region, including Chicago, and
reach south into  Arkansas  from June 18 to 22, he said.  “The Midwest seemed more favored versus the East Coast,”
Rogers said in a note to clients today. “Given this pattern, we
should be able to translate the heat to the East in occasional
pulses, but timing and intensity details are an immense
challenge this far ahead.”  High temperatures in the cities of the U.S. East Coast
often set off extra demand for electricity as residents turn on
air conditioners to keep buildings cool.  The normal average temperature in  New York  for June 17 is
about 73 degrees, according to MDA EarthSat in Gaithersburg,
Maryland. It’s 68 in Boston, 76 in Washington, 78 in Atlanta, 83
in Houston, 81 in Dallas, 61 in Seattle and 70 in Burbank,
California.
