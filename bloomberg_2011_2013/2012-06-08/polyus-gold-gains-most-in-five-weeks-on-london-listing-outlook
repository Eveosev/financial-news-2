Polyus Gold International Ltd. (PLGL) ,
Russia’s largest producer of the metal, jumped to the highest in
five weeks in U.S. trading after it said shareholders approved a
plan for a primary listing of shares on the London Stock
Exchange.  Polyus’s  American depositary receipts  rose 4.3 percent to
$2.94 in  New York , the highest since May 3. The miner was the
biggest gainer on the Bloomberg Russia-US 14 Index of Russian
companies traded in New York today and over the past week. The
benchmark advanced 0.5 percent to 85.60.  “The market’s reaction to the decision is positive and the
stock is gaining,”  Mikhail Stiskin , chief analyst for metals
and mining at Troika Dialog in Moscow, said by phone today.
Stiskin recommends investors hold the company’s shares and said
he doesn’t plan to revise his recommendation in the near term.  Polyus plans a primary listing of shares on the LSE on or
about June 19, according to the company’s statement today. The
company seeks the LSE listing to expand its access to funding
from international investors, said analysts, including Valentina Bogomolova at UralSib Capital in Moscow. Polyus will offer to
convert its global depositary receipts traded in  London  into the
shares, the company has said in a May 17 statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
