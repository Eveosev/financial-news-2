Syncrude’s discount to West Texas
Intermediate oil narrowed after Plains Midstream Canada LP shut
a portion of its Rangeland pipeline in  Alberta  following a
release.  The portion of the affected line was not transporting oil
at the time of the release, estimated to be 1,000 barrels to
3,000 barrels, Plains said in a statement. “The entire
Rangeland pipeline is not shut down,” Darlene Crowell, a
Calgary-based spokeswoman, said in an e-mail.  Syncrude strengthened 75 cents a barrel to a discount of
$5.50 at 12:05 p.m. in  New York , according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. Bakken oil’s discount narrowed 50 cents to $10.50.
Western Canada Select’s discount was unchanged at $24.75.  Light Louisiana Sweet’s  premium  to benchmark West Texas
