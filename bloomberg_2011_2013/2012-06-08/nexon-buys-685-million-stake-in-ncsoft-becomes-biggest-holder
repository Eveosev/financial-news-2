Nexon Co. (3659) , a Tokyo-based maker of
online games, bought a 804.5 billion won ($685 million) stake in
 NCSoft Corp. (036570)  to become the South Korean company’s biggest
shareholder.  Nexon purchased 3.2 million NCSoft shares, a 14.7 percent
stake, from NCSoft Chairman Kim Taek-Jin for 250,000 won apiece,
it said in a statement today. That’s 6.7 percent less than
today’s closing price in Seoul for NCSoft, which offers online
games including Lineage and Aion.  Nexon sees “a lot of opportunities” for acquisitions in
Asia, North America, and Europe, Chief Financial Officer Owen Mahoney said last month. The Tokyo-based company is interested
in investing in companies that develop games for Facebook Inc.
and mobile-phone users, he said at the time.  NCSoft, based in  Seoul , rose 0.4 percent to 268,000 won in
trading on the city’s stock exchange today before the
announcement. Nexon fell 0.2 percent to 1,319 yen on the Tokyo
stock exchange today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
