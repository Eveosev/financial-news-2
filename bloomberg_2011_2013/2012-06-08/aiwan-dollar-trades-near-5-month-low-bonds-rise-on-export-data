Taiwan’s dollar completed its longest
weekly losing streak since September 2008 and  government bonds 
gained on concern a slowing global economy is crimping demand
for the island’s goods.  The currency retreated for a fifth straight week after
government data showed yesterday exports dropped 6.3 percent in
May from a year earlier, a third month of contraction.  China ,
Taiwan’s biggest trade partner, cut  interest rates  for the first
time in more than three years yesterday as economists predicted
that official data this week will show growth in industrial
production slowed last month to the least since November 2009.  “China’s rate cut is a sign of a bleaker economic
outlook,” said  Albert Lee , a Taipei-based fixed-income trader
at Cathay United Bank Co. “The current environment will support
a rally in bonds.”  Taiwan ’s dollar retreated 0.2 percent this week and today
to NT$29.976 against its U.S. counterpart, according to Taipei
Forex Inc. It touched NT$30.070 on June 5, the weakest level
since Jan. 17.  The currency’s one-month implied volatility, a measure of
exchange-rate swings traders use to price options, dropped two
basis points to 5.33 percent. It fell 68 basis points for the
week.  The yield on the government’s 1 percent bonds due January
2017 dropped one basis point this week and today to 0.922
percent, according to Gretai Securities Market. It reached 0.91
percent on June 4, the lowest level for benchmark five-year
rates since October 2010.  Traders are shifting focus to longer-maturity debt,
especially 10-year notes, on concern Greece elections next month
will fan volatility, Lee said. The yield on Taiwan’s generic 10-
year bonds fell one basis point today and two basis points this
week to 1.17 percent.  The  overnight interbank lending rate  was steady today and
for the week at 0.514 percent, according to a weighted average
compiled by the Taiwan Interbank Money Center.  To contact the reporter on this story:
