The  New England Patriots  released
receiver Chad Ochocinco after one season and signed tight end Bo Scaife.  The 34-year-old Ochocinco caught one pass in the Patriots’
21-17 loss to the New York Giants in the  Super Bowl  on Feb. 5.
Ochocinco spent 10 National Football League seasons with the
Cincinnati Bengals after joining them as a second-round pick in
the 2001 draft.  Six-time Pro Bowl selection Ochocinco became the first
player in NFL history to lead his conference in receiving yards
in four straight seasons, from 2003 to 2006.  Ochocinco had 751 receptions for 10,783 yards and 66
touchdowns in 151 games with the Bengals, and 15 catches for 276
yards and one touchdown in 15 regular-season appearances with
the Patriots.  He was scheduled to earn $925,000 in salary in 2012,
according to the NFL Players Association.  Scaife, 31, joins a tight-end lineup led by  Rob Gronkowski 
and  Aaron Hernandez , and will compete with Daniel Fells for the
No. 3 spot, according to NFL.com.  The team doesn’t disclose financial terms and a call to
Scaife’s agent,  Drew Rosenhaus , wasn’t returned.  A sixth-round draft pick out of the University of Texas in
2005, Scaife spent six seasons with the Tennessee Titans. His
most productive year was 2008, when he caught 58 passes for 561
yards and two touchdowns. The Titans placed the franchise tag on
him the following season.  The 6-foot-3, 249-pound Scaife caught 36 passes for 318
yards and four touchdowns in 2010 and was allowed to enter free
agency. He injured his neck during preseason and was placed on
injured reserve after signing a one-year, $1 million contract
with the Bengals in 2011.  To contact the reporters on this story:
