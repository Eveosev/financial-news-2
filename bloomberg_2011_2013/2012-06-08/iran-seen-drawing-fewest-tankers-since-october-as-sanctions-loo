The fewest supertankers in at least
eight months were headed for  Iran  as the deadline neared for a
Europe Union embargo against the nation’s oil, ship-tracking
data showed.  The Daylam, owned by Tehran-based NITC Co., was the only
very large crude carrier signaling a future destination in Iran,
according to IHS Inc. data compiled by Bloomberg. That’s the
fewest ships since at least October, based on a weekly snapshot
of the global fleet’s movements. The latest signals from 23 NITC
tankers are more than a week old, data showed.  International tanker owners are avoiding Iran because
carrying the country’s crude will cause them to lose insurance
under EU sanctions taking full effect July 1. Iran is under
pressure to stop a nuclear program that the U.S. and  Europe 
suspect involves weapons development and will export 1.2 million
barrels a day starting next month, down from 2.2 million last
year, Barclays Plc estimates.  The following table shows the destinations and combined
carrying capacity in deadweight tons of 419 VLCCs, out of a
global fleet of 566, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
Average drafts are expressed as a percentage of maximum sailing
depth and are an indication of cargo size. Each country’s
percentage share of total oil shipments is shown for the current
and previous weeks.  To contact the reporter on this story:
