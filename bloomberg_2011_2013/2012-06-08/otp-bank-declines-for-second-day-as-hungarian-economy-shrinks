  OTP Bank Nyrt. (OTP) ,  Hungary ’s largest
lender, fell for a second day as data showed Hungary’s economy
contracted for the first time in more than two years and bets on
monetary stimulus for the global economy decreased.  The shares dropped as much as 1.6 percent and traded 0.6
percent lower at 3,385 forint by 12:26 p.m. in Budapest. A close
at that level would mean a weekly gain of 0.4 percent.  Gross domestic product in Hungary, the European Union’s
most indebted eastern member, fell 0.7 percent in the first
quarter from a year earlier, declining for the first time since
the last quarter of 2009, after a 1.4 percent expansion in the
last three months of 2011, the Budapest-based statistics office
said today. Demand for riskier assets fell as Federal Reserve
Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  damped expectations for monetary
stimulus and German exports dropped.  To contact the reporter on this story:
