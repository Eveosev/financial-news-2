     June 8 (Bloomberg) -- Unga Group Ltd. (UNGL) , a Kenyan grain
miller, gained the most this month after Business Daily reported
it ended a 12-year  management contract  with  Seaboard Overseas
Management Co. (SEB)   The stock advanced 3.6 percent to 12.80 shillings by the 3
p.m. in close Nairobi, the capital, the biggest jump since May
29, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Seaboard, based in Merriam, Kansas, was hired in March 2000
to return the Kenyan company to profit,  Business Daily  said,
citing Unga’s annual report. Seaboard owns 35 percent of Unga
Holdings, the parent company of Unga Group, the Nairobi-based
newspaper said.  “It was effectively a toll charge on the growth of the
company because they were paying a huge management fee,” Aly- Khan Satchu, chief executive officer of Nairobi-based Rich
Management, said in a phone interview today.  In the year to June 30, 2011, net income climbed to 441.04
million shillings ($5.2 million), from 236.2 million shillings a
year earlier, Unga said in September.  To contact the reporter on this story:
