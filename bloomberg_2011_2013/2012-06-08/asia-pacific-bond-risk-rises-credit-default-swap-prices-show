The cost of insuring Asia-Pacific
corporate and sovereign bonds from non-payment rose, according
to traders of credit-default swaps.  The Markit iTraxx Japan index increased 4 basis points to
191 basis points as of 9:49 a.m. in  Tokyo , Citigroup Inc. prices
show. The benchmark is headed for the biggest one-day gain since
June 1, according to data provider CMA.  The Markit iTraxx Australia index advanced 2 basis points
to 198 as of 10:38 a.m. in Sydney, according to  Westpac Banking
Corp. (WBC)  The gauge is set for its first daily gain since June 4,
according to CMA, which is owned by CME Group Inc. and compiles
prices quoted by dealers in the privately negotiated market.  The Markit iTraxx Asia index of 40 investment-grade
borrowers outside Japan climbed 2 basis points to 194.5 basis
points as of 8:30 a.m. in  Hong Kong , Standard Chartered Plc
prices show. The measure is poised for its first increase in
June 4, according to CMA.  Credit-default swap indexes are benchmarks for protecting
bonds against default and traders use them to speculate on
 credit quality . A drop signals improving perceptions of
creditworthiness, while an increase suggests the opposite.  The swap contracts pay the buyer face value in exchange for
the underlying securities if a borrower fails to meet its debt
agreements. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  To contact the reporter on this story:
