Multimedia Polska SA, Poland’s
second-largest cable television operator, sold 250 million zloty
($72.6 million) of five-year bonds to refinance a bank loan and
fund acquisitions, the company said in an e-mailed statement
today.  Multimedia will use about 180 million zloty from the sale
to repay the loan, it said in the e-mail. The cable TV operator
didn’t give the spread above Warsaw interbank offered rate it
paid to sell the securities.  PKO Bank Polski SA, Poland’s biggest lender, managed the
sale. Banks, pension and mutual funds were buyers of the
securities, Multimedia said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
