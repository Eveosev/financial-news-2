Turkish  industrial production 
unexpectedly expanded in April from a year ago. Bond yields
climbed.  Production grew 1.8 percent from April 2011, the statistics
agency in Ankara said on its website today. Output was expected
to be unchanged, according to the median estimate of six
economists questioned by Bloomberg. Production expanded an
annual 2.6 percent in March.  Economic growth in  Turkey  is slowing after the debt crisis
in  Europe  intensified and the central bank tightened monetary
policy to stem inflation and bank lending. The annual expansion
in the economy slowed for three-straight quarters to 5.2 percent
in the final three months of 2011. The government targets growth
of 4 percent this year.  Yields on  two-year lira bonds  rose six basis points to 9.19
percent at 10:16 a.m. in Istanbul.  Monthly output climbed 1 percent from April, the statistics
agency said. Annual adjusted output rose 1 percent, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
