England’s attempt to sweep the three
Test cricket series with West Indies is being hurt by a second
day of heavy rains that are delaying the start of the match at
Edgbaston in Birmingham.  The teams lost a full-day’s play yesterday, when the day
was called after 3 p.m. without any action or even the toss.
England has already clinched a series victory by winning the
first two matches.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
