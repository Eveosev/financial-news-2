The Nigerian Stock Exchange  All-Share
Index (NSEASI)  retreated 1 percent to 20,902.95 in Lagos, according to an
e-mailed statement from the bourse. The gauge has dropped for
nine days, the longest series of declines since June 2011.  The  FTSE/Namibia Overall Index (FTN098)  slid for the first day in
six, losing 0.5 percent to 891.29 in Windhoek. Mauritius’s
 SEMDEX Index (SEMDEX)  snapped four days of declines, rising 0.1 percent
to 1,794.46 by the close in Port Louis. Kenya’s All-Share Index
weakened 0.3 percent to 64.53 in Nairobi.  Fidelity Bank Plc (FIDELITY)  , a Nigerian lender, rose by
the daily limit of 5 percent, the most in fourth months, to
close at 1.26 naira, rebounding from the lowest this year.  Kenya Airways Ltd. (KNAL)  , sub-Saharan Africa’s third-
biggest carrier, slipped for a fourth day, plunging 3.4 percent
to 14.25 shillings, the lowest close since April 18. The
Nairobi-based company said today it achieved a minimum
subscription rate for its share sale, raising less than it had
planned to expand across Africa.  Unga Group Ltd. (UNGL)  , a Kenyan grain miller, advanced
3.6 percent to 12.80 shillings, the biggest jump since May 29,
after Business Daily reported it ended a 12-year  management
contract  with Seaboard Overseas Management Co.  “It was effectively a toll charge on the growth of the
company because they were paying a huge management fee,” Aly-
Khan Satchu, chief executive officer of Nairobi-based Rich
Management, said in a phone interview today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
