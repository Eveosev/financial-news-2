Fed funds, the U.S. overnight inter-
bank lending  rate , opened at 0.17 percent, within the Federal
Reserve’s target of zero to 0.25 percent.  Fed funds closed at 0.16 percent yesterday after trading
from 0.1 percent to 0.25 percent and averaging 0.15 percent,
according to ICAP Plc, the world’s largest inter-dealer broker.  The central bank will acquire $1.5 billion to $2.25 billion
of Treasuries maturing from February 2036 to May 2042. The
purchases are part of the Fed’s program to replace $400 billion
of short-term debt in its portfolio with longer-term Treasuries
in an effort to reduce borrowing costs further and counter
rising risks of a recession.  To contact the reporter on this story:
