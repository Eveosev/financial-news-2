German government spokesman Steffen Seibert said it’s up to  Spain  to decide to apply for aid from
the euro area’s rescue fund and declined to comment on whether
Spain has already decided to seek aid.  “The decision lies with the Spanish government,” Seibert
told reporters at a government briefing in Berlin today. “If it
takes the decision,  Europe ’s instruments will be ready for it.”  “If it happens, it will follow the usual procedure: a
state files an application, it accepts liability and is bound to
conditions,” Seibert says. “The decision whether that’s the
Spanish way will be taken by the Spanish government.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
