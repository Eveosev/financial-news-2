Crude-oil options volatility rose to
the highest level this week as underlying futures fell as much
as 3.3 percent on concern that the deepening  European debt
crisis  and China’s growth slowdown threaten global fuel demand.  Implied volatility for at-the-money options expiring in
July, a measure of expected price swings in futures and a gauge
of options prices, was 35.12 percent at 1:10 p.m. on the  New
York  Mercantile Exchange, up from 33.41 yesterday. Volatility
reached 40.56 on June 1, the highest level since Oct. 20.  “The volatility came down as the market stabilized, but
the market is back down again today and only something very
constructive out of  Europe  will give us a rally,” said  James
Cordier , portfolio manager at OptionSellers.com in Tampa,
 Florida .  Crude oil for July delivery fell $1.27, or 1.5 percent, to
