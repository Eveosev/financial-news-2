China Petroleum & Chemical Corp. (600028)  and
 PetroChina Co. (857) , the nation’s biggest refiners, face more losses
from processing crude after the government cut fuel prices by
the most since 2008 as global crude costs tumbled.  State-controlled retail gasoline prices  fall  by 530 yuan
($83) a metric ton and diesel by 510 yuan starting today, the
National Development and Reform Commission, the nation’s top
economic planner, said on its website yesterday. The cut is the
steepest since the government’s current pricing system was
introduced in December 2008.  A drop in fuel prices threatens to reduce revenue at
PetroChina and  China  Petroleum, known as Sinopec, offsetting
cheaper crude costs and extending processing losses that widened
last quarter. Brent oil in  London , a benchmark price tracked by
the government, entered a so-called  bear market  on June 1 after
sliding more than 20 percent from this year’s peak.  “Margins at the refiners are looking quite bad for the
second quarter,” said Shi Yan, a Shanghai-based analyst at UOB-
Kay Hian Ltd., who predicted prices would be lowered by 600  yuan 
a ton. “The government may want to help trim refiners’ oil-
processing losses” by cutting fuel prices by less than
expected, she said.  Sinopec had a 16-fold increase in its first-quarter
refining loss to 9.2 billion yuan compared with a year earlier,
the company said April 26. PetroChina said its operating loss
from processing widened to 10.4 billion yuan in the three months
from 6.1 billion yuan a year earlier.  Not Reflecting  A drop of 530 yuan a ton, or 24 cents a gallon, doesn’t
fully reflect the decline in crude, according to calculations by
C1 Energy, a Shanghai-based commodity researcher. It  correctly
 reported the fuel-price changes on its website yesterday before
official announcements. Rates should have fallen by as much as
620 yuan under government rules, it said.  The cut is equivalent to a 5.5 percent drop in average
retail gasoline prices, according to government data. Brent fell
11 percent to close at $99.93 a barrel on June 7 compared with
May 10, when Chinese fuel prices were last adjusted.  The maximum price for 90-RON, Euro III-equivalent gasoline
at the pump in Beijing falls to 9,520 yuan a ton, or $4.27 a
gallon, data from the NDRC show.  Fuel Pricing  Sinopec rose 0.7 percent to HK$7.07 in Hong Kong yesterday
and PetroChina gained 0.8 percent to HK$10.12. The benchmark
 Hang Seng  index fell 0.9 percent.  The NDRC considers adjusting fuel rates when the 22-day
moving average of Brent, Dubai and Indonesia’s Cinta crude
changes more than 4 percent from the previous revision.
Yesterday was the 22nd working day after the last adjustment on
May 10, the official Xinhua News Agency said June 6.  The nation has a plan to revise its fuel-pricing mechanism
and is waiting for an “appropriate time” to implement it, Zhou Wangjun, deputy director of the pricing department at the NDRC,
said in a webcast by Xinhua on April 26. The system will be
implemented when  oil prices  are “relatively low,” Zhou said.  China will let  oil companies  set fuel prices according to
guideline rates posted by the government as part of planned
changes, Xinhua reported March 28, citing Peng Sen, a former
vice chairman at the NDRC.  The new system may also shorten the pricing cycle to 10
days from 22 days and replace  Indonesia ’s Cinta with New York-
traded West Texas Intermediate, China Petrochemical Corp., the
parent company of China Petroleum, said in its online newsletter
March 28.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
