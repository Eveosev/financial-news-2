President  Barack Obama  welcomed the
 Super Bowl  champion New York Giants today, and both expressed
the hope they’ll see each other in the White House again in
2013.  “We both have a goal to get back here next year,” Giants
coach  Tom Coughlin  said on the South Lawn, joined by Super Bowl
MVP Eli Manning and the rest of the football team, along with
hundreds of guests looking on.  The Giants in February won their second Super Bowl in five
seasons, defeating the New England Patriots both times.  “For some of you, this is just welcome back,” Obama said.
The Giants also visited the White House in 2008, the last time
they won the National Football League championship.  Coughlin and the team presented Obama with a Giants jersey
and a football.  “We hope when you think about the 2011-12  New York 
Football Giants, a smile will come to your face,” Coughlin
said. “No one gave us a chance.”  Obama’s opponent in November is also from Massachusetts,
former Governor Mitt Romney.  To contact the reporter on this story:
