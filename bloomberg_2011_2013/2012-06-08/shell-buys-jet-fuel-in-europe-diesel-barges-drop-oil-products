Royal Dutch Shell Plc bought a cargo
of  jet fuel  in northwest for the first time this month. Diesel
barges fell as BP Plc sold six lots.  Gasoil on the ICE Futures  Europe  exchange in London fell
for a second day, trading at the lowest in 16 months after  Brent
crude  plunged to less than $98 a barrel on concern that an
economic slowdown in the U.S. and Europe will worsen, curbing
fuel demand.  Light Products  Greenergy International Ltd. bought a gasoline cargo from
Vitol Group at $934 a metric ton for delivery to the U.K.,
according to a survey of brokers and traders monitoring the
Platts pricing window, which ends at 4:30 p.m. London time.  Statoil ASA sold a cargo to Harvest Energy Ltd. at $920 a
ton, also to the U.K., the survey showed. That compares with a
trade on May 29 at $1,019 for delivery to the Thames.  Gasoline for immediate loading in Amsterdam-Rotterdam-
Antwerp traded at $913 to $917 a ton, according to a similar
survey of the Argus Bulletin Board. That’s the lowest price
since Dec. 21 and compares with yesterday’s $930 to $959 range.  The trades are for Eurobob grade to which ethanol is added
to make finished fuel and are typically for lots of 1,000 tons
or 2,000 tons.  Gasoline’s  premium  to Brent increased 11 cents to $9.78 a
barrel as of 2:01 p.m. local time, according to data from PVM
Oil Associates Ltd., a broker in  London .  Naphtha’s  discount  to Brent widened to $13.90 a barrel from
$13.38 yesterday, PVM data show. That’s the most since Nov. 14.  Middle Distillates  Shell purchased the jet fuel cargo from BP for delivery to
Rotterdam at $1 less than European benchmark prices, the survey
of Platts prices showed. That compares with a deal on May 31 at
a $2 premium for delivery to  France .  Diesel  barges  changed hands thirteen times at a premium of
$14 a ton to June gasoil, the survey showed. That’s lower than
yesterday’s deals at $15 to $16. BP was the main seller. Vitol
and Morgan Stanley were the biggest buyers.  Barges of heating oil traded at parity to discounts of $1 a
ton to June gasoil, it showed. That’s in line with yesterday.  Gasoil for June delivery dropped 1.5 percent to $846.25 a
ton as of 5:16 p.m. local time on the ICE exchange. Earlier in
the day, it traded at $839.75 a ton, the lowest intraday price
since Feb. 7, 2011. The July contract was at $843 a ton,
narrowing the discount to $3.25 from $4.50 yesterday.  Gasoil’s  crack , a measure of refining profitability, rose
to $15.23 a barrel from $14.70 yesterday, ICE data show. Brent
dropped 2.1 percent to $97.89 a barrel.  Residues  High-sulfur  fuel oil  traded at $562 to $565 a ton, the
survey of Platts showed. That compares with $571.25 to $577
yesterday. The low-sulfur grade changed hands at $604, down from
$618 to $618.50 in the previous session.  Refineries  Anonima Petroli Italiana SpA, the Italian refiner known as
API, plans to shut its 78,000 barrel-a-day Falconara facility
for one year from Jan. 1, 2013, according to a company official.

site to run on natural gas, the official said today by phone
from  Rome , declining to be identified because of company policy.  To contact the reporter on this story:
