Fintage House BV, the performance
collection agency of Elvis Presley, and Rights Agency Ltd.,
which counts  Paul McCartney  among its clients, formed a venture
to capture artist royalties.  Fintage House, based in the Netherlands, and London-based
Rights Agency Ltd. will combine their operations that collect
money for recording artists when their music is played on radio,
television and other formats, the companies said today in an e-
mailed statement. Financial terms of the deal, which includes
cost-sharing on technology upgrades, weren’t disclosed.  Income from the radio play and other commercial uses has
become more important to artists in the past decade as album
sales have declined. The closely held companies said the deal
gives clients of both access to a shared global collections
network and more efficiency.  “We invested in RAL because we believe together we can
achieve more for our clients on a global scale,” Niels Teves,
co-Chief Executive Officer of Fintage House, said in the
statement. “Our clients are traditionally from the U.S., Canada
and continental Europe, while the clients of RAL are primarily
from the U.K. Collectively, our client base is worldwide.”  RAL clients include  Phil Collins , Celine Dion,  Eric Clapton 
and Pet Shop Boys, according to the statement. Fintage House’s
roster includes  Britney Spears , Foo Fighters, Jason Mraz and The
Black Eyed Peas.  To contact the reporter on this story:
