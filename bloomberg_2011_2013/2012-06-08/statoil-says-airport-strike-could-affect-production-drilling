Statoil ASA (STL) ,  Norway ’s biggest oil
producer, said a strike of security personnel at airports that
is grounding helicopters may start affecting offshore
production and drilling next week.  Statoil, based in Stavanger, is considering alternative
routes over the weekend for offshore workers unable to reach
platforms as the company has fallen three days behind planned
rotation schedules after five days conflict, spokesman Ola Anders Skauby said.  Statoil is mulling whether to send workers by boat or use
less affected airports because all five of its regular heliports
will be shut this weekend and risk remaining closed next week,
he said. Statoil can maintain normal production until “a few
days into next week,” he said.  “We would then start to see an impact on operations,”
Skauby said by phone. “But I don’t want to get into what that
would mean, whether it would mean shutdowns, reductions in
production, or that we would be unable to drill the wells we
plan to drill.”  Almost 3,500 security workers are on strike, including 375
airport guards. It’s second conflict to hit Statoil in as many
weeks. A resolved strike of pilot boat workers last week
threatened output at land-based facilities such as the Mongstad
refinery, the country’s oil processing plant.  To contact the reporter on this story:
