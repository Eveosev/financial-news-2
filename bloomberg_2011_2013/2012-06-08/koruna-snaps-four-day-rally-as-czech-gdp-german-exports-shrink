The Czech koruna weakened, snapping a
four-day rally against the euro after data confirmed that the
country’s recession deepened in the first quarter and exports
from  Germany  contracted in April more than analysts expected.  The koruna depreciated 0.6 percent to 25.468 per euro as of
4:46 p.m. in Prague, paring weekly gains to 1.2 percent.  Gross domestic product shrank 0.8 percent from the previous
quarter, the Prague-based statistics office said today, adding
to pressure on the central bank to reduce interest rates.
Exports from Germany, Europe’s biggest economy, dropped 1.7
percent from March and industrial output in Italy declined as
the region’s worsening debt crisis curbed demand. The euro area
is the biggest buyer of Czech exports, which account for about
75 percent of Czech GDP.  “GDP data support an idea of the Czech National Bank’s
rate cut,” said  David Marek , chief economist at Patria Finance
AS. The Prague-based brokerage estimates the economy will shrink
1 percent this year, Marek wrote in an e-mail to clients today.  Global stocks and oil fell after Federal Reserve Chairman
 Ben S. Bernanke  damped expectations for monetary stimulus in the
world’s largest economy and  Fitch Ratings  reduced Spain’s credit
grade.  To contact the reporter on this story:
