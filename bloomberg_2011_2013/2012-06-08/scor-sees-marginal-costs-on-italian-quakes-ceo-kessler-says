Scor SE (SCR) ,  France ’s largest reinsurer,
will be “only marginally affected” by two earthquakes that hit
Italy last month, Chief Executive Officer Denis Kessler said.  “This event, in terms of intensity and destruction force,
is much lower than L’Aquila’s in 2009,” Kessler said in a
telephone interview. Scor, based in Paris, had losses of less
than 10 million euros ($12.5 million) from the earthquake that
struck the area of L’Aquila in central Italy.  The earthquakes that hit parts of northern Italy in May
caused more than 4 billion euros in economic damage, Gaetano Maccaferri, employer lobby Confindustria’s president for the
Emilia Romagna region, said this week. About 600 industrial
companies employing more than 12,000 workers were “directly”
damaged by the quakes, Maccaferri said.  “You must expect insurance losses, even if we don’t
believe that the cost for the market will be very significant,”
Kessler said. “Unfortunately, very few households in  Italy  are
insured against natural disasters. Companies are more often
insured.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
