Swedish industrial production
unexpectedly stalled in April as the  European debt crisis  saps
export demand in the largest Nordic economy.  Industrial production  was unchanged in April, and output
growth for March was revised down to 0.2 percent, Stockholm-
based Statistics Sweden said today. Production was  estimated  to
rise 0.6 percent, according to the median forecast in a
Bloomberg survey. Output fell an annual 6.2 percent.  Swedish manufacturing shrank for the first time since
December last month, a survey indicated, as spending cuts by
European governments hamper demand for exports, which make up
about half of the countryâ€™s output. Economic growth will slow to
0.6 percent this year from 3.9 percent in 2011, the Organization
for Economic Cooperation and Development predicted last month.  Industrial orders fell a  monthly  1.6 percent and plunged an
 annual  9 percent in January,  Statistics Sweden  also said today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
