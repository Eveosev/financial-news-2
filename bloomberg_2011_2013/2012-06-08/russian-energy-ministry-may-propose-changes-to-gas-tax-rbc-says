Russia ’s Energy Ministry may propose
a new formula to calculate the natural-gas extraction tax that
would take into account the fuel’s market price and the
complexity of the fields, RBC Daily  reported , citing an
unidentified gas industry official.  The proposal will be presented at a government meeting
tomorrow, the Moscow-based newspaper said.  The government is reviewing a planned jump in the
extraction tax for Russia’s gas-export monopoly OAO Gazprom and
independent producers that was announced in May, Deputy Prime
Minister  Arkady Dvorkovich  said last month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
