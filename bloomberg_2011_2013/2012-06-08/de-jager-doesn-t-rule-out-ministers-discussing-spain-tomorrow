Dutch Finance Minister Jan Kees  de Jager  said he doesn’t rule out the possibility European finance
ministers will tomorrow discuss the situation in  Spain , whose
banks need to be recapitalized.  “I don’t rule that out, but I can’t comment further on
what we would discuss,” De Jager said in  The Hague  today when
asked if European finance ministers would hold a conference call
about Spain tomorrow. “The situation is urgent. We see what is
happening in Spain.”  Spain is preparing to become the fourth euro-area nation to
seek emergency assistance, with the currency bloc’s finance
chiefs planning weekend talks on potential aid to shore up the
nation’s lenders.  “The European aid fund isn’t able to directly recapitalize
banks,” De Jager said, repeating the Dutch government’s
position. “We always want the risk and the costs to be for the
country where the banks are located.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
