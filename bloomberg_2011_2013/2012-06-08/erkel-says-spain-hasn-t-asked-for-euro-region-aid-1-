German Chancellor  Angela Merkel  said
 Spain  hasn’t applied for aid from the euro region’s financial
backstop and  Germany  won’t apply pressure on any state to do so.  “It’s always clear that those countries wishing to
participate in solidarity have to file this application
themselves,” Merkel told reporters at the Chancellery in Berlin
today in response to a question whether the euro region can be
stable without Spain seeking aid.  “We have everything necessary for a stable development in
the euro zone,” Merkel said at a press conference with New
Zealand Prime Minister John Key. “Now it’s up to individual
countries to approach us. This hasn’t happened yet and that’s
why Germany will not apply any pressure.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
