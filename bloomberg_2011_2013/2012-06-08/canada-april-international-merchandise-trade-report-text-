The following is the text of
 Canada ’s international merchandise trade report for April
from Statistics Canada.  Canada’s merchandise exports declined 1.2% in April, while
imports edged up 0.1%. After five consecutive monthly surpluses,
Canada posted a trade deficit of $367 million in April,
down from a surplus of $152 million in March.  Exports fell to $39.1 billion, the result of a 1.9%
decline in prices. The main contributors to the overall
decrease were exports of industrial goods and materials,
as well as machinery and equipment.  Imports rose to $39.5 billion, their fifth consecutive
monthly increase. The gains were led by higher imports of
automotive products and other consumer goods, while imports
of energy products declined.  Exports to the  United States  fell 1.2% to $28.4 billion
in April, the fourth consecutive monthly decrease. Imports from
the United States rose 1.3% to $24.6 billion. As a result,
Canada’s trade surplus with the United States decreased from
$4.5 billion in March to $3.8 billion in April.  Exports to countries other than the United States decreased
1.2% to $10.7 billion in April, while imports declined 1.9% to
$14.9 billion. Canada’s trade deficit with countries other than
the United States narrowed from $4.4 billion in March to $4.2
billion in April.  Exports: Widespread declines in industrial goods and materials
sector  Exports of industrial goods and materials fell 5.8% to
$9.3 billion in April, as widespread declines were recorded
throughout the sector. Volumes fell 3.7%, while prices declined
2.1%. Metal ores as well as metals and alloys were the main
contributors to the sector’s decline, which was partially offset
by gains in chemicals, plastics and fertilizers, particularly
potash.  Exports of machinery and equipment decreased 3.1% to $6.7
billion,
as volumes fell 3.4%. The main contributor to the decrease was a
14.1% decline in exports of aircraft, engines and parts.  Exports of energy products decreased 0.8% to $9.9 billion
in April,
as prices fell 6.7%. Crude petroleum exports dropped 9.0%, the
third
consecutive monthly decline that was a result of lower prices.
Exports of petroleum and coal products increased 18.5%.  Automotive products exports rose 2.8% to $5.5 billion in
April.
Leading the gain were exports of passenger autos and chassis
(+2.4%),
followed by motor vehicle parts, which recorded its fifth
consecutive
monthly gain. These increases were on the strength of volumes.  Exports of agricultural and fishing products, which
increased
3.8% to $3.7 billion, have been on an upward trend since March
2011.
Volumes rose 2.7%. The main contributors to the sector’s gain
were
higher exports of fish and fish preparations (+18.7%) and wheat
(+12.1%).  Counterbalancing movements in imports  Imports of automotive products rose 2.6% to $6.8 billion in
April, as volumes grew 3.2%. Imports of motor vehicle parts, up
5.4% to $2.9 billion, led the sector’s gain.  Imports rose 2.6% to $5.1 billion in the other  consumer
goods 
sector, where widespread gains were recorded. The main
contributor
to the increase was imports of apparel and footwear (+11.1%),
mostly
the result of higher imports of apparel and apparel accessories.  Imports of industrial goods and materials rose 0.7% to $8.2
billion in April. Other industrial goods and materials (+2.5%)
led
the sector’s increase on the strength of metal fabricated basic
products.  Imports of energy products fell 6.8% to $4.1 billion, the
result
of lower prices and volumes. After three consecutive monthly
increases,
imports of crude petroleum fell 6.5% to $2.5 billion, as prices
dropped
11.1%. Petroleum and coal products also contributed to the
decline.  Imports of machinery and equipment decreased 0.6% to $10.8
billion
in April. The decline was led by lower imports of office
machines and
equipment as well as other machinery and equipment, primarily
 laboratory
equipment .  Note to readers  Merchandise trade is one component of Canada’s
international
balance of payments (BOP), which also includes trade in services,
investment income, current transfers as well as capital and
financial
flows.  International merchandise trade data by country are
available on
both a BOP and a customs basis for the United States,  Japan  and
the
 United Kingdom . Trade data for all other individual countries
are
available on a customs basis only. BOP data are derived from
customs
data by making adjustments for factors such as valuation,
coverage,
timing and residency. These adjustments are made to conform to
the
concepts and definitions of the Canadian System of National
Accounts.  Data in this release are on a BOP basis, seasonally
adjusted and
in current dollars. Constant dollars are calculated using the
Laspeyres
volume formula.  New aggregation structure  Statistics Canada  will introduce the North American Product
Classification System (NAPCS) for merchandise import and export
statistics. The new structure will replace the classification
structures known as the summary import groups (SIG) and the
summary
export groups (SEG) and the higher level aggregations (major
groups,
subsectors, sectors and sections) that have been in use for
several
decades.  Revised data based on NAPCS for the reference period of
January
1988 to August 2012 will be disseminated on October 18.  The first regular release of data based on NAPCS will be on
November 8 for the September reference month.  Readers interested in this upcoming change can find more
detailed
information on our web page dedicated to classification
( http://www.statcan.gc.ca/concepts/consult-napcs-scpan-eng.htm )
consultation and notification.  Revisions  In general, merchandise trade data are revised on an
ongoing basis
for each month of the current year. Current year revisions are
reflected
in both the customs and BOP based data.  The previous year’s customs data are revised with the
release of the
January and February reference months as well as on a quarterly
basis.
The previous two years of customs based data are revised
annually and
are released in February with the December reference month.  The previous year’s BOP based data will be revised with the
release
of the January, February, March and April 2012 reference months.  Factors influencing revisions include late receipt of
import and
export documentation, incorrect information on customs forms,
replacement
of estimates produced for the energy sector with actual figures,
changes
in classification of merchandise based on more current
information, and
changes to seasonal adjustment factors.  Revised data are available in the appropriate CANSIM tables,
free
of charge.  Table: Merchandise trade: Principal trading areas - Seasonally
