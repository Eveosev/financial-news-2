Navistar International Corp. (NAV) , the
maker of International brand trucks, advanced the most in more
than three years after investor  Carl Icahn  disclosed he boosted
his stake in the company.  Navistar rose 18 percent to $28.36 at the close in  New
York , the most since Jan. 5, 2009.  Icahn lifted his ownership to 11.9 percent, according to a
regulatory filing dated yesterday. He had owned 10.6 percent.
Icahn bought an additional 883,200 shares at an average price of
$24.44 each, according to the filing.  Navistar slid 14 percent yesterday after the Lisle,
Illinois-based truckmaker reported a second-quarter loss,
excluding some costs, of $137 million, or $1.99 a share. The
average estimate of analysts surveyed by Bloomberg was for a
profit of 67 cents a share. The company also lowered its full-
year profit forecast to a range of break-even to $2 a share.  The company is struggling to meet 2010 federal emission
standards for one of its truck engines. Navistar in February
forecast 2012 profit of as much as $5.75 a share. The company
reduced the figure to as much as $5.25 a share in March.  The second-quarter net loss was $172 million, or $2.50 a
share, compared with a profit of $74 million, or 93 cents, a
year earlier.  To contact the reporter on this story:
