Mexico ’s peso posted its biggest
weekly rally since January as China’s first  interest-rate  cut
since 2008 prompted speculation more central banks will act to
bolster the global economy.  The currency erased earlier losses today after Mexican
policy makers held the benchmark interest rate at a record low
4.5 percent and as Spain prepared to become the fourth nation in
the euro area to seek emergency assistance, with finance chiefs
planning weekend talks.  The peso rose 1.1 percent to 13.9212 per dollar at 4 p.m.
in Mexico City, extending its rally this week to 2.8 percent,
the biggest gain since the five days ended Jan. 20.  “Most of what’s behind this recovery has been the
expectation that central banks might implement more aggressive
strategies to stimulate their economies,”  Mario Copca , a
foreign-exchange strategist at Metanalisis SA, said in phone
interview from Mexico City. “This has helped ease some of the
volatility.”  Mexico’s central bank sold $258 million of foreign reserves
May 23 in its first such intervention since December 2009. It
intervened again on May 31 after the peso fell to a three-year
low, marking the second time policy makers had used the program
they introduced in November.  The bank has been offering $400 million at three daily
auctions at an  exchange rate  at least 2 percent weaker than the
previous day’s fix rate since Nov. 30.  Dropping Bonds Yields  The yield on Mexican local-currency bonds due in 2024 fell
nine basis points, or 0.09 percentage point, to 6.12 percent
this week, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The price
rose 0.97 centavo to 133.87 centavos per peso.  Mexico’s central bank kept its benchmark interest rate
unchanged for the 27th straight meeting as a pick-up in
inflation and a slump in the peso offset concern that a
faltering  U.S. economy  may undercut export demand.  China’s one-year deposit rate was reduced this week to 3.25
percent from 3.5 percent. The  Reserve Bank  of Australia cut its
target lending rate by a quarter-percentage point to 3.5
percent, the lowest level since 2009. Federal Reserve Chairman
 Ben S. Bernanke  said policy makers will need to assess
conditions before deciding if more measures are needed to
bolster the U.S. economy.  Fitch Ratings  cut Spain’s credit rating to BBB from A
yesterday, saying the nation may need as much as 100 billion
euros ($125 billion) to bolster its banking system, compared
with an earlier estimate of about 30 billion euros.  To contact the reporter on this story:
