Latvia’s  economy  expanded at the
quickest pace in the European Union in the first quarter and
more than previously estimated as growth in trade, manufacturing
and construction accelerated.  Gross domestic product increased a revised 6.9 percent from
a year earlier, compared with a previous 6.8 percent reading,
the  statistics office , based in the capital, Riga, said today by
e-mail. The economy grew a seasonally adjusted 1.1 percent on
the quarter.  Latvia is rebounding from the world’s deepest recession in
2008-2009, which erased almost a quarter of economic output
after a property bubble bust and inflows of credit dried up,
prompting an  International Monetary Fund  bailout. GDP grew 5.5
percent last year, buoyed by exports and industrial output, and
may expand 3.5 percent in 2012, the IMF predicts.  Consumer prices rose 2.2 percent from a year earlier in May
after increasing 2.8 percent the previous month, the statistics
office said in a separate release. That compares with a 2.4
percent median estimate of five economists in a Bloomberg
survey. Prices declined 0.2 percent from the previous month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
