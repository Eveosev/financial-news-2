South African resource stocks fell
the most in more than a week after comments by Federal Reserve
Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  overshadowed  China ’s first interest-
rate cut since 2008.  The  FTSE/JSE Africa Resource 10 Index (RESI20)  fell 1.8 percent, the
most since May 30, to 47,880.47 by the 5 p.m. close in
Johannesburg.  BHP Billiton Ltd. (BHP) , the world’s largest commodities
company, dropped 2.7 percent, the most since May 23.  Anglo
American Plc (AGL)  retreated 1.6 percent, the most this month.  China’s announcement of a reduction in lending and deposit
rates came two days before the nation is due to report
inflation, investment and output figures. The biggest buyer of
South African raw materials is trying to boost a flagging
economy amid concern that  Europe ’s worsening debt crisis
threatens global growth. Bernanke said yesterday the Fed will
need to assess conditions before deciding if more measures are
needed to stoke the economy.  “The real loss of risk-on sentiment appears to be
Bernanke’s Congressional testimony which apparently offered
little clue of more stimulus,” Quinten Bertenshaw, a
Johannesburg-based analyst at Tradition Analytics, said in e-
mailed comments. “Until Chinese numbers start improving we are
likely to see a lot of nerves in markets generally, and toward
China-exposed  emerging markets  in particular.”  Standard & Poor’s  GSCI index  of commodities fell for a
second day. Metals and other commodities account for 45 percent
of  South Africa ’s exports, according to government data.  To contact the reporter on this story:
