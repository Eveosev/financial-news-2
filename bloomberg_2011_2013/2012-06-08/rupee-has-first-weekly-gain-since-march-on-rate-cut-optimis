India’s rupee completed its first
weekly gain since March, snapping the longest losing streak
since 2008, on speculation the central bank will lower borrowing
costs this month to spur economic growth.  The  Reserve Bank  of India has more room to cut  interest
rates  after economic growth slowed and  oil prices  dropped,
Deputy Governor Subir Gokarn said this week. On June 6, Prime
Minister  Manmohan Singh  pledged measures to revive economic
growth, echoing similar statements from global policy makers.
 China  cut rates yesterday for the first time since 2008.  “A rate cut will benefit the rupee as the currency needs a
strong growth outlook and lower rates will work towards boosting
domestic consumption,” said Dariusz Kowalczyk, a strategist at
Credit Agricole CIB in Hong Kong. “We expect the repurchase
rate to be cut by 25 basis points at the June 18 review.”  The rupee advanced 0.2 percent to 55.4550 per dollar in
Mumbai, the first advance since the five days ended March 30,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. It fell 0.9 percent
today. The currency’s one-month implied volatility, a measure of
exchange-rate swings used to price options, rose five basis
points, or 0.05 percentage point, to 11.7 percent. The gauge
dropped 170 basis points this week.  India ’s  gross domestic product  rose 5.3 percent last
quarter from a year earlier, the least since 2003, government
data showed last week. Brent crude oil has dropped 21 percent
this quarter to $97.47 per barrel. India imports about 80
percent of its oil.  Three-month onshore currency forwards traded at 56.41 a
dollar, compared with 56.02 yesterday, and offshore non-
deliverable contracts were at 56.58 from 56.15. Forwards are
agreements to buy or sell assets at a set price and date. Non-
deliverable contracts are settled in dollars.  To contact the reporter on this story:
