EON AG,  Germany ’s biggest utility,
said it suspects an unspecified former employee “falsified”
trading positions and may have concealed internal-rule
violations and trading limits.  The company, based in Dusseldorf, Germany, said the 
financial impact is expected to be below 20 million euros and 
no customers, counterparties or exchanges suffered damage, 
Georg Oppermann, a spokesman for EON’s trading unit, said today 
in an e-mail. EON first said it had suffered losses because of 
the trader on June 4.  To contact the reporter on this story:
