European Central Bank Governing
Council member Ewald Nowotny said any delay in  Spain  requesting
a European Union aid would increase the costs of a bailout.  While declining to comment on rumors that Spain may ask for
aid this weekend, Nowotny said that he “of course considered it
sensible to request aid, because the longer you wait with revamp
measures, the more expensive it gets. Therefore, I consider it
sensible as part of a coordinated plan,” Nowotny told reporters
in Vienna today.  “Spain currently has a problem with its banks and of
course a real estate bubble,” Nowotny said. “This means we
have a situation that isn’t completely dissimilar to what we had
in Ireland.”  Regarding measures that would be part of a bailout plan,
Nowotny listed a “reduction of the  budget deficit  as quickly as
possible,” the merger of banks and a reduction of their balance
sheets. “As Ireland showed, if one does this consequently, it
definitely can be successful,” he said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
