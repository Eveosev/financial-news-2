Telkom SA Ltd. (TKG) ,  Africa ’s biggest
fixed-line telephone company, fell 1.8 percent after saying it
won’t pay a dividend for the year ended March 31 because it
plans to use any funds for expansion.  Telkom declined to 20.30 rand at the close in Johannesburg.
The stock has dropped 30 percent this year, the fourth-worst
performance on the 162-company  FTSE/JSE Africa All Share Index. (JALSH)   Increased competition in  South Africa  and a failed
expansion into Nigeria have cut  profit  excluding one-time items
at Africa’s largest fixed-line operator every year since 2006.
Telkom has paid dividends each year since 2004, with special
cash payments in five of the six years through 2010. A final
 payout  of 1.50 rand was expected, according to Bloomberg
dividend estimates. Telkom posted a net loss for fiscal 2012.  “The company has been harvested for a long time and now
there is nothing left to harvest,” Simon Fillmore, an analyst
at Independent Securities (Pty) Ltd., said by phone from
Johannesburg. “It has to start growing, and this will take
significant capital outlay.”  South Africa’s cabinet decided a week ago to block the
planned 2.7 billion-rand ($321 million) sale of 20 percent of
Telkom to  KT Corp. (030200) ,  South Korea ’s biggest phone and Internet
provider. The government, which owns 40 percent of Telkom, is
considering a sale of stock to current Telkom investors or an
increase in debt to help fund a return to profit, Communications
Minister Dina Pule said on June 5.  The net loss attributable to shareholders in the 12 months
through March 31 was 216 million rand versus profit of 1.22
billion rand in fiscal 2011, the company said in a statement
today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
