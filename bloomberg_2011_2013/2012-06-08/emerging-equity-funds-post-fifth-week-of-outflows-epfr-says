Emerging-market stock funds posted
their fifth consecutive week of outflows for the week ended June
6 after worse-than-expected U.S. employment data and the lack of
consensus among euro zone leaders, EPFR Global said.  Developing-nation  equity  funds registered outflows of $1.3
billion, according to a report e-mailed today by the Cambridge,
Massachusetts-based data provider. Total net investment into
emerging-market fund has totaled $13.5 billion on net inflows in
2012, compared with outflows of $7.7 billion for the same period
of 2011.  To contact the reporter on this story:
