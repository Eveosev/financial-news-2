Trafigura Beheer BV failed to sell
two cargoes of  North Sea  Forties blend at lower prices than
yesterday. Eni SpA bought Russian Urals at a bigger discount to
Dated Brent than the last trade in the Mediterranean.  Daily exports of Azeri Light crude from a port in  Turkey 
will increase by 1 percent in July from June, according to a
loading program obtained by Bloomberg News.  North Sea  Trafigura was unable to sell the Forties cargo for loading
on June 24 to June 26 at 5 cents a barrel more than Dated Brent,
and a second shipment for June 28 to June 30 at a premium of 25
cents, a Bloomberg survey of traders and brokers monitoring the
Platts trading window shows. This compares with trades yesterday
at premiums of 35 cents and 45 cents.  Statoil ASA didn’t manage to find buyers for a consignment
of the grade for July 1 to July 3 at 30 cents more than Dated
Brent, while Vitol Group failed to sell the blend for July 4 to
July 6 at the same price, the survey shows.  BP Plc sought to buy Forties for June 28 to July 6 without
success at 10 cents more than Dated Brent, while Chevron Corp.
failed to buy at parity to the benchmark for July 1 to July 7,
according to the survey.  Reported crude trading typically occurs during the Platts
window, which ends at 4:30 p.m. London time. Before the session,
Forties loading in 10 to 25 days was 29 cents a barrel more than
Dated Brent, compared with yesterday’s two-month high of a
premium of 38 cents, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Brent for July settlement traded at $97.65 a barrel on the
ICE Futures  Europe  exchange in London at the close of the
window, down from $99.88 yesterday. The August contract was at
$97.27, a discount of 38 cents to July.  Two Flotta cargoes for loading in June were delayed because
of lower-than-expected production, according to an official at
Talisman Energy Inc., which operates the field.  The first cargo was deferred by 12 days and will load now
from June 26 to June 28, while the second originally for June 27
to June 29 will be shipped in July, said the official who
declined to be identified citing company policy. Both shipments
are for 600,000 barrels each.  Mediterranean/Urals  OAO Lukoil sold Eni 80,000 metric tons of Urals for
delivery on June 19 to June 23 to Augusta,  Italy , at $2.10 a
barrel less than Dated Brent, compared with a discount of $1.95
for the last trade on June 6, the survey showed.  No bids or offers were made for Urals in northwest Europe.
The  blend  was at $1.50 a barrel less than Dated Brent in
northwest Europe, the highest since May 18, compared with a
discount of $1.90 yesterday, the Bloomberg data show.  Vitol Group sold CPC Blend for June 28 to June 29 to Exxon
Mobil Corp. at $3.50 a barrel less than Dated Brent, the survey
shows. This compared with a discount of $3.15 for the last
transaction on June 1.  Algerian Saharan Blend was at 50 cents a barrel less than
Dated Brent today, the lowest since June 2005, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  “Mediterranean light grades have fallen to exceptionally
low levels in recent months as they struggle to cope with
structural change,”  Johannes Benigni , managing director at the
Vienna-based researcher JBC Energy GmbH, said today in an e-
mailed report.  Shipments of Azeri Light from the Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan
pipeline for next month will total 20.75 million barrels, or
669,355 barrels a day, compared with 663,333 this month, the
schedule shows.  West Africa  A Mangalore Refinery & Petrochemicals Ltd. tender for
600,000 barrels of low-sulfur crude loading in the second half
of July closed today, a document released on May 29 showed.  Nigerian benchmark Qua Iboe crude was at a premium of $2.03
a barrel to Dated Brent, up 1 cent from yesterday, data compiled
by Bloomberg show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
