The Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan pipeline led
by  BP Plc (BP/)  delivered 8 percent less Azeri oil in the first five
months of the year,  State Oil Co. (ATPG)  of Azerbaijan said.  The line shipped 13 million metric tons, down from 14.2
million tons a year earlier, the company known as Socar said on
its website without giving a reason for the decline.  The BTC pipeline, connecting the Sangachal terminal south
of the Azeri capital of Baku to Turkey’s Mediterranean port of
Ceyhan via  Georgia , exports oil from the offshore Azeri-Chirag-
Guneshli field, also operated by BP. As of June 1, BTC shipped
188.8 million tons of crude since it opened in 2006, Socar said.  The field produced 8.8 million tons of oil in the first
quarter, down 8.3 percent from a year ago, BP said last month.
 Azerbaijan , the third-largest oil producer in the former  Soviet
Union  after Russia and Kazakhstan, pumped 45.6 million tons of
oil and 25.8 billion cubic meters of natural-gas last year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
