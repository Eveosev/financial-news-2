Quiksilver Inc. (ZQK) , the maker of
clothing for skateboarders and surfers, climbed the most in
almost six months after avoiding a wipeout in its European
sales.  Quiksilver, based in Huntington Beach, California,  rose  11
percent to $2.70 at 1:15 p.m. in  New York  trading, after
advancing as much as 13 percent. The intraday gain was the
biggest since Dec. 16.  Quiksilver is “quite proud” that its European unit posted
second-quarter revenue growth in constant currency while rivals
reported declines, Chief Financial Officer Richard Shields said
yesterday on a conference call with analysts. The shares, which
reached $4.74 in February, had declined as economic turmoil
mounted in Europe,  Andrew Burns , an analyst with D.A. Davidson &
Co., said in an e-mail.  “The report wasn’t as bad as some had feared so it’s a bit
of a relief rally,” said Burns, who is based in Lake Oswego,
Oregon, and rates Quiksilver a buy. He projects the stock will
reach $5 within 18 months.  Quiksilver yesterday reported a second-quarter loss,
adjusted for some items, of 2 cents a share on revenue of $492.2
million. Analysts had estimated a 1 cent profit on sales of
$495.9 million.  Pacific Sunwear of California Inc. , an Anaheim, California-
based retailer that specializes in surfwear, climbed 4.4 percent
to $1.66.  To contact the reporter on this story:
