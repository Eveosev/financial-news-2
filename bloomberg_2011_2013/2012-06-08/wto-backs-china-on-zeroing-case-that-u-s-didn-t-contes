The  World Trade Organization  backed
China in its complaint against the U.S. use of so-called zeroing
to calculate anti-dumping duties on Chinese shrimp and diamond
sawblades in a case the Obama administration didn’t contest.  The WTO has ruled several times against the methodology,
under which the U.S. sets the cost of a product at zero rather
than the actual amount, saying it unfairly increases the amount
of anti-dumping levies that must be paid. The U.S., which has
already agreed to recalculate the dumping margins on the Chinese
imports, said in February that it would stop using zeroing.  Dumping occurs when companies export goods at a loss, or at
prices below what the products fetch in their domestic market.
In most investigations, the Commerce Department averages prices
for each product under review and the comparable goods in the
U.S. It then compares the prices and sets duties based on the
difference.  Today’s ruling by the Geneva-based WTO mirrors findings in
past complaints lodged by  Brazil , Canada, Ecuador, the European
Union, Japan, Mexico, South Korea,  Thailand  and  Vietnam .  To contact the reporter on this story:
