The cost for European banks to borrow
in dollars rose for a second day, according to a money-markets
indicator.  The three-month cross-currency  basis swap , the rate banks
pay to convert euro interest payments into dollars, was 53 basis
points below the euro interbank offered rate at 12:14 p.m. in
London, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Thatâ€™s from
minus 51 basis points yesterday and compares with minus 59 on
June 4, which was the most expensive in three months.  The one-year basis swap was 58 basis points below Euribor,
from minus 57 yesterday. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  Prices in the forward market for three-month Euribor
relative to overnight indexed swaps -- known as the FRA/OIS
spread -- were little changed at 35 basis points.  The Euribor/OIS spread widened to 40 basis points from 38
basis points yesterday. The measure has ranged from 38 basis
points to 42 basis points since the end of March. The three-
month Euribor benchmark rate was unchanged at 0.663 percent
today, according to the European Banking Federation.  Lenders cut  overnight deposits  at the Frankfurt-based
European Central Bank yesterday, placing 757 billion euros ($943
billion) from 785 billion euros the day before.  To contact the reporter on this story:
