Wheat dropped on speculation that
yields in  Kansas , the biggest U.S. producer of winter varieties,
will increase, while the pace of the harvest was faster than
normal. Soybeans also fell.  About 20 percent of the nation’s winter wheat was collected
as of June 3, up from the average in the previous five years of
3 percent, U.S. Department of Agriculture  data  show. Yields in
Kansas will probably average about 40 bushels an acre, up from
35 bushels a year earlier,  Kansas Wheat , an industry group, said
this week.  “The yields we’re hearing from Kansas are pretty good,”
 Jason Britt , the president of Central States Commodities Inc. in
 Kansas City , Missouri, said in a telephone interview.  Wheat futures for July delivery slid 1.8 percent to settle
at $6.3025 a bushel at 1:15 p.m. on the  Chicago  Board of Trade.
This week, the price gained 2.9 percent, partly because dry
weather threatens Russia’s crop.  The commodity also declined as the dollar rose against a
basket of major currencies, eroding the appeal of shipments from
the U.S., the world’s biggest exporter.  Soybean futures for November delivery, the contract with
the highest open interest, dropped 0.7 percent to settle at
$13.325 a bushel.  Wheat is the fourth-largest U.S. crop, valued at $14.4
billion in 2011, behind corn, soybeans and hay, government data
show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
