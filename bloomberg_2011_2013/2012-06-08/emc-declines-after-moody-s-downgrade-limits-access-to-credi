MEMC Electronic Materials Inc. (WFR) , the
second-largest U.S. polysilicon maker, fell after a ratings
downgrade “limited” its access to a  credit line .  MEMC dropped 2.3 percent to $1.68 at the close in New York.
The shares have declined 57 percent this year.  Moody’s Investors Service downgraded MEMC’s corporate
family rating to B3 from B2 and its 2019 notes to Caa1 from B3
yesterday, while raising the company’s speculative grade
liquidity rating to SGL-3 from SGL-4.  “As a result of the downgrade, we will be limited from
making any additional borrowings under our North American non-
recourse revolving construction facility,” Brian Wuebbels, the
St. Peters, Missouri-based company’s chief financial officer,
said yesterday in a statement.  MEMC said the downgrade won’t require it to accelerate
repayment of about $110 million outstanding on the construction
facility.  The company also may see a $15 million to $20 million
reduction in its second-quarter cash balance, Wuebbels said.
“We are comfortable with the company’s cash and liquidity
position.”  The downgrade “reflects the financial distress in MEMC’s
solar operations, which we expect will continue to burn cash for
the near term,” Terry Dennehy, a Moody’s senior analyst, said
in a statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
