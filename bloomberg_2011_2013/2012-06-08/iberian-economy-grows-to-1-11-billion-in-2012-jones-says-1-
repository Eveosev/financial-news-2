Economic output in  Liberia  grew to
$1.11 billion this year from $600 million in 2006, according to
central bank Governor Joseph Mills Jones.  The country, which is recovering from 11 years of civil war
that ended in 2003, has more than 10,000 registered businesses,
double the number from 2006, and is planning higher budget
spending for the 2012-13 fiscal year, he told lawmakers in
Monrovia, the capital, today.  Jones was answering questions about the country’s
depreciating currency. The Liberia dollar dropped to 76 per
dollar, the lowest since at least September 2001, when Bloomberg
began compiling the data, on May 30. The currency has pared the
loss and traded at 73.51 per dollar today.  “Illegal money peddlers are undermining the  exchange rate 
by posting artificial rates on the market,” he said.  Still, the country’s inflation rate is “not alarming,” he
said. Inflation is expected to slow to 5.2 percent this year
from 8.5 percent in 2011, according to the  International
Monetary Fund .  To contact the reporter on this story:
