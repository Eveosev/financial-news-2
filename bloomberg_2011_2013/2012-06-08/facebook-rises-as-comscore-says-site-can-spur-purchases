Facebook Inc. (FB) , operator of the
world’s largest social network, rose after researcher  ComScore
Inc. (SCOR)  suggested that marketers can use the site effectively to
encourage users to buy products.  Shares of  Menlo Park , California-based Facebook climbed 3
percent to $27.10 at the close in New York. Facebook has
 declined  29 percent since it started trading at $38 on May 18.  Companies marketing to Facebook users who have signaled
they “like” a business or have mentioned a brand in a post can
have a “a statistically significant positive lift on people’s
purchasing,”  ComScore  said in a blog post. The findings counter
a Reuters/Ipsos poll earlier this week that showed sagging
interest in the site and a minority of users being influenced by
advertising when deciding what to buy.  Facebook has faced investor concerns about its ability to
leverage its more than 900 million users to boost advertising
revenue fast enough to justify its valuation. The  company  has
said its user growth is outpacing advertising gains as more
people use smartphones to access the site.  To contact the reporter on this story:
