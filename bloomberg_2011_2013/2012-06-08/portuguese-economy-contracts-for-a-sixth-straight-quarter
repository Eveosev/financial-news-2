Portugal ’s  economy  shrank for a sixth
quarter in the three months through March as the government and
consumers reduced spending.  Gross domestic product declined 0.1 percent from the fourth
quarter, when it fell 1.3 percent, the Lisbon-based National
Statistics Institute said in an e-mailed statement today. That
matches a preliminary report on May 15. GDP dropped 2.2 percent
from a year earlier.  Prime Minister  Pedro Passos Coelho  is cutting spending and
raising taxes to meet the terms of a 78 billion-euro ($97
billion) aid plan from the European Union and the  International
Monetary Fund . As the country’s borrowing costs surged, Portugal
last year followed Greece and Ireland in seeking a bailout.  Household spending dropped 2.1 percent in the first quarter
from the previous three months, while  government spending  fell
0.6 percent. Exports rose 1.8 percent and imports increased 1.7
percent.  Portuguese  economic growth  has averaged less than 1 percent
a year for the past decade, placing it among  Europe ’s weakest
performers. The economy may contract 3.3 percent this year
before expanding 0.3 percent in 2013, the European Commission
forecast on May 11. The government predicts GDP will shrink 3
percent this year and expand 0.2 percent in 2013.  Cars, Construction  Car sales may drop 18.5 percent this year from 2011,
according to a forecast by ACAP, the Portuguese Automobile
Association. An estimated 2,600 companies in the  auto industry 
may close in 2012, with 21,000 job losses, ACAP said.  Portugal’s construction sector is on the “verge of
collapse” and needs an emergency program to help restructure
debt, the country’s biggest industry group said on June 5. The
industry owes banks about 25 billion euros and insolvency risks
are rising as banks cut back on loans, Ricardo Pedrosa Gomes,
president of the Public Works and Construction Association, said
in a statement.  The country’s  jobless rate  rose to a euro-era record of
14.9 percent in the first quarter. The government forecasts the
 unemployment rate  will climb to 15.9 percent for all of 2013
from 15.5 percent this year.  The government targets a budget deficit of 4.5 percent of
GDP in 2012 and 3 percent in 2013. Debt was 107.8 percent of
output in 2011 and the government forecasts it will reach 114.4
percent in 2012 and peak at 118.6 percent in 2013.  To contact the reporter on this story:
