Japan’s Nikkei 225 Stock Average (TPX)  fell
the most in three weeks after Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S.
Bernanke  declined to specify options for further easing. Shares
extended their drop after the settlement for Nikkei futures on
speculation the market will keep falling, and as the yen rose.  Mazda Motor Corp. (7261) , an automaker that gets 28 percent of its
sales in  North America , dropped 2.9 percent.  Sony Corp. (6758) , a
consumer electronics company that relies on Europe for a fifth
of its sales, lost 5.3 percent after Spain’s credit grade was
cut by  Fitch Ratings . Renesas Electronics Corp. soared 19
percent on a report that the maker of microcontrollers for cars
canceled a share sale.  The Nikkei 225 lost 2.1 percent to 8,459.26 at the 3 p.m.
close of trading in Tokyo, the biggest drop since May 18. It
extended losses after the futures settlement, known as the
“special quotation.” The Topix Index fell 1.8 percent to
717.74, gaining 1.2 percent on the week. Shares fell even after
China announced its first interest-rate cut since 2008.  “That Bernanke didn’t say anything concrete seems to be
weighing on the market in the short term,” said Ichiro Yamada,
general manager of equities who helps manages about $3.77
billion in stocks at Fukoku Mutual Life Insurance. “We had a
special quotation, and today’s drop is also largely due to
technical reasons.”  Trading volume on the  Nikkei 225 (NKY)  was 42 percent above the
30-day average as the price for the equity gauge’s futures and
options contracts for June delivery was settled at 8,613.40,
according to traders.  Topix Valuations  The Topix capped its first weekly advance in 10 weeks after
the measure on June 4 closed at its lowest since 1983. The index
fell 18 percent from this year’s high on March 27 amid concern
the European crisis is deepening and as growth in China slows.
Equities on the measure are valued at 0.85 times book value,
about the same level as in October 2008 amid the global
financial crisis.  Shares fell today even as data showed that  Japan ’s economy
grew more than initially estimated. Separately, the nation
posted a smaller-than-expected current-account surplus.  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index fell 0.6 percent
today. The gauge closed little changed yesterday, paring earlier
gains as the Fed’s Bernanke said the central bank will assess
the  U.S. economy  before deciding if more stimulus is needed and
after a report that Greece’s upcoming election could be derailed,
intensifying concern the nation may exit the euro.  Exporters to the U.S. fell, with Mazda sliding 2.9 percent
to 99 yen. Dainippon Sumitomo Pharma Co., a drug maker that gets
31 percent of its sales in the U.S., fell 2.6 percent to 750 yen.  The People’s Bank of China said on its website yesterday
that its benchmark one-year lending rate  will drop  to 6.31
percent from 6.56 percent effective today. The one-year deposit
rate will fall to 3.25 percent from 3.5 percent.  Spain Downgrade  Stocks linked to  Europe  fell as Spanish Prime Minister
 Mariano Rajoy  said he’s talking to European leaders about how to
shore up the country’s banks after Spain’s credit grade was cut
to within two levels of junk by Fitch Ratings. Spain is trying
to overcome German opposition to a plan to allow the euro
region’s bailout funds recapitalize lenders directly.  “The key issue really is around European sovereign debt,”
said  Donald Williams , Sydney-based chief investment officer at
Platypus Asset Management Ltd., which manages about $1 billion.
“Even though China’s rate cut was unexpected, people are
selling because it confirms in their minds that the growth
outlook is problematic.”  Sony lost 5.3 percent to 1,015 yen.  Nippon Sheet Glass Co. (5202) ,
the company on the Nikkei 225 that relies the most on Europe,
slumped 3.6 percent to 81 yen.  Shares of exporters extended losses as the yen gained
against all 16 of its major counterparts. A stronger yen cuts
the value of Japanese companies’ earnings abroad when
repatriated back home.  Renesas Soars  Renesas Electronics rose 19 percent to 316 yen after the
Mainichi newspaper said the company shelved plans to sell 100
billion yen ($1.26 billion) in shares.  The  Nikkei 225 Volatility Index (VNKY)  added 12 percent to 28.56,
indicating traders expect a swing of about 8 percent on the
benchmark gauge over the next 30 days.  To contact the reporter on this story:
