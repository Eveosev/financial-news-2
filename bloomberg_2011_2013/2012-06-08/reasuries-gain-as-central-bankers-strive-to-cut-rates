Treasuries rose for a second day amid
concern  Spain  may become the fourth of the 17 euro-bloc
countries to require emergency assistance, stoking investor
demand for safety.  U.S. 10-year yields dropped from the highest this month
before European finance leaders hold a conference call this
weekend to discuss a potential aid request to shore up Spain’s
lenders. Treasuries were also supported after  Federal Reserve 
Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said yesterday the U.S. has options for
further monetary easing. The U.S. will sell $66 billion of notes
and bonds next week.  “It is a different version of the same story every
morning,” said  Dan Greenhaus , chief global strategist at the
broker-dealer BTIG LLC in New York. “There are concerns about
 Europe , the stability of the banking system and what it means
for the global economy. Supply hasn’t mattered since the crisis
began, so there’s no reason to think that in the middle of next
week supply will be a concern.”  Ten-year note  yields  dropped six basis points, or 0.06
percentage point, to 1.58 percent at 9:08 a.m.  New York  time,
according to Bloomberg Bond Trader prices. The 1.75 percent
security due in May 2022 advanced 18/32, or $5.63 per $1,000
face amount, to 101 18/32. The yield climbed to 1.68 percent
yesterday, the highest level since May 30.  An index of Treasuries maturing in more than a year
returned 1.3 percent in the past month, the best performance
among 26 sovereign-debt markets tracked by Bloomberg and the
European Federation of Financial Analysts Societies, after
accounting for the dollar’s appreciation.  Expensive Level  A valuation measure showed Treasuries are at almost the
most expensive level ever. The term premium, a model created by
economists at the Fed, was at negative 0.88 percent after
closing on June 1 at negative 0.94 percent, the record. The
average over the past year is negative 0.44. A negative reading
indicates investors are willing to accept yields below what’s
considered fair value.  Ten- and 30-year yields reached record lows of 1.4387
percent and 2.5089 percent on June 1. The yields touched 2012
highs in March, 3.49 percent for the long bond and 2.4 percent
for the 10-year note.  “The situation in Europe poses significant risks to the
U.S. financial system and economy and must be monitored
closely,” Bernanke said yesterday in testimony to Congress’s
Joint Economic Committee in  Washington . “As always, the Federal
Reserve remains prepared to take action as needed.”  The  Federal Open Market Committee  opens a two-day policy
meeting on June 19.  Yield Gap  The difference in yields between 10-year notes and Treasury
Inflation Protected Securities, which represents traders’
expectations for inflation over the life of the debt, was 2.1
percentage points, down from this year’s high of 2.45 percentage
points in March. The average over the past decade is 2.15
percentage points.  Reports showing German exports and Italian industrial
production declined in April added to evidence Europe’s crisis
is harming the global economy.  German  exports , adjusted for work days and seasonal
changes, slid 1.7 percent in April from a month earlier, when
they gained 0.8 percent, the Federal Statistics Office said in
Wiesbaden. Italian output fell 1.9 percent from March, when it
rose a revised 0.6 percent, the national statistics office said
in  Rome . A separate report showed French confidence declined.  Spain Downgraded  Fitch Ratings  downgraded Spain yesterday by three levels to
BBB, taking the rating to two steps off non-investment grade.
The cost to the state of shoring up banks may amount to as much
as 100 billion euros ($124.6 billion), compared with its
previous estimate of 30 billion euros, Fitch said.  Spain’s 10-year bond yield climbed as much as 18 basis
points to 6.27 percent today, and the euro slid 0.9 percent to
$1.2446. Prime Minister  Mariano Rajoy  said for the first time
he’s discussing with European leaders how to help Spanish banks.  European finance ministers will discuss this weekend a
possible aid package for Spain, according to a German official
who declined to be identified because the matter is
confidential.  The U.S. central bank plans to buy as much as $2.25 billion
of Treasuries today due from February 2036 to May 2042,
according to the Fed Bank of New York’s  website . The purchases
are part of its program to replace $400 billion of shorter-term
debt in its holdings with longer maturities by the end of this
month to keep down borrowing costs.  Program Extension  U.S. policy makers will probably extend and modify the
program,  Ward McCarthy , chief financial economist at Jefferies &
Co., told Pimm Fox yesterday on Bloomberg Television’s “Taking
Stock.”  The central bank will probably buy $300 billion of
mortgage-backed securities and $115 billion of 30-year bonds in
the second version of the program, according to Jefferies, one
of the 21 primary dealers that trade Treasuries with the Fed.
U.S. central bankers next meet on June 19-20.  The U.S. will auction next week $32 billion of three-year
notes, $21 billion of 10-year securities and $13 billion of 30-
year bonds. The three sales start June 12.  Japanese investors cut their holdings of long-term
Treasuries by 2.86 trillion yen ($36.1 billion) in April, the
Ministry of Finance reported today, the most based on MOF data
since 2005.  To contact the reporters on this story:
