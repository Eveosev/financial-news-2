Argentinaâ€™s central bank eliminated
for two months the minimum reserve requirement on dollar
deposits in a bid to help them face dollar withdrawals,
newspaper El Cronista reported.  The measure, which lasts from June 1 to July 31, was made
necessary by an acceleration of withdrawals from dollar accounts
after the government tightened controls on the foreign exchange
market, the Buenos Aires-based newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
