Kwame R. Brown, the former chairman
of the  District of Columbia  council, pleaded guilty to a federal
charge of bank fraud and a second charge related to a violation
of campaign finance laws.  Brown, 41, who resigned from office, admitted in federal
court in Washington today to providing false documentation to
get loans totaling more than $220,000. In the second matter,
Brown admitted in the District of Columbia Superior Court to
facilitating a cash payment in excess of legal limits to a
person who worked on his 2008 campaign, according to a statement
by U.S. Attorney Ronald Machen.  “While sitting on the council, Kwame Brown repeatedly
falsified and forged documents to deceive the bank into giving
him money, even faxing one of the fraudulent documents from his
council office,” Machen said. “The people of the District of
Columbia deserve better from their elected officials.”  Brown is the second member of the D.C. Council to plead
guilty to criminal charges this year. In January, Harry L. Thomas Jr. pleaded guilty to federal theft and tax charges.
Thomas was sentenced to more than three years in prison.  Brown faces a sentence of about six months in prison for
the bank fraud charge and as much as six months for the campaign
finance charge, according to prosecutors. He is scheduled to be
sentenced on Sept. 20.  Frederick Cooke, a lawyer for Brown, didn’t immediately
return an e-mail message seeking comment on the pleas.  The bank fraud case is U.S. v. Brown, 12-00135, U.S.
District Court, District of Columbia ( Washington ).  To contact the reporter on this story:
