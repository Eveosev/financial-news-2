Indian stocks had the year’s best
weekly rally amid expectation the nation’s central bank will
join regional peers in slashing borrowing costs to boost growth.  Larsen & Toubro Ltd. (LT) , the largest engineering company,
climbed to a seven-week high.  Reliance Industries Ltd. (RIL) , owner of
the world’s largest refining complex, advanced for a fifth day.
 Sterlite Industries (India) Ltd. (STLT)  soared 3.5 percent. The BSE
 India   Sensitive Index (SENSEX)  increased 0.4 percent to 16,718.87 at
close. The gauge rallied 4.7 percent this week, the most since
the 7.3 percent gain in the five-day period ended Dec. 2.  The People’s Bank of  China  yesterday cut its  interest rate 
for the first time since 2008, fanning optimism policy makers
around the world will do more to support growth. The move came a
day after Prime Minister  Manmohan Singh  outlined projects to
revive growth that slowed to a near-decade low in the last
quarter. The  Reserve Bank  of India reviews policy on June 18.  “It is important to revive growth and get some confidence
back in the economy,” Sandip Sabharwal, chief executive officer
of portfolio management services at Prabhudas Lilladher in
Mumbai, said by telephone. “The RBI must step in and push
growth.” A rate cut will “start a virtuous cycle,” he said.  Growth concerns have dragged down the Sensex 9.3 percent
from its 2012 high on Feb. 21. The gauge declined 6.4 percent
last month, its worst May performance since 2006, and is valued
at 13 times estimated earnings, its lowest in about three years.  India’s  gross domestic product  expanded 5.3 percent last
quarter, stoking concern the economic outlook has deteriorated
as policy gridlock deters investment and  Europe ’s debt crisis
crimps exports. The slowdown and an oil-price drop suggest more
room for rate cuts even as inflation risks remain, RBI Deputy
Governor Subir Gokarn said June 1 and reiterated on June 4.  ‘Rate Sensitives’  The RBI cut rates on April 17 for the first time in three
years, after raising it a record 13 times from mid-March 2010 to
October last year to cool accelerating prices. Inflation
averaged 7.1 percent in the first four months of this year,
compared with 9.5 percent in the whole of 2011.  The Sensex rebounded from an intraday drop of 1 percent as
the expectation of a rate cut forced traders to close bearish
bets in companies most tied to the economy, Shankar Char, vice
president at ICICI Securities Ltd., a unit of India’s biggest
private lender, said by e-mail.  “Interest-rate sensitives were in the limelight and some
like Larsen & Toubro benefited from short covering,” he said.  Larsen & Toubro surged 2.7 percent to 1,309.45 rupees,
extending this week’s rally to 15 percent, the most among the 30
companies on the Sensex.  Bharat Heavy Electricals Ltd. (BHEL) , the top
power-equipment maker, climbed 1.4 percent to 221.2 rupees.
Reliance advanced 1.2 percent to 729.7 rupees.  200-Day Average  India VIX, which measures the cost of protection against
losses in the S&P CNX Nifty Index, fell 0.7 percent to 23.47.
The Nifty increased 0.4 percent to 5,068.35, closing above its
200-day moving average of 5,006.  Sterlite jumped surged 3.5 percent to 100.6 rupees. The
stock has soared 10.4 percent this week, its steepest climb
since the five days ended Oct. 28.  Overseas  investors  purchased a net  $134 million  of stocks
yesterday, extending and total investment this year to $8.4
billion, data from the regulator show. Foreigners cut holdings
by $273 million in May, a second month of net sales.  To contact the reporter on this story:
