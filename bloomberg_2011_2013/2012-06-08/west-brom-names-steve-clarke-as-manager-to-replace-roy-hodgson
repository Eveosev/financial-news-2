West Brom Albion named former Chelsea
and West Ham assistant manager Steve Clarke to take over as
coach to replace  Roy Hodgson , who is running England’s national
soccer team.  Clarke, 48, signed a two-year contract, the Premier League
team said today in a statement on its website. He worked as
assistant manager at Chelsea under  Jose Mourinho , Newcastle, and
West Ham and was first-team coach at Liverpool.  “We decided to pursue candidates who are renowned for
their coaching ability, and Steve was very much at the forefront
of our thoughts because of the clubs he has worked at and the
high regards he is held in within the game,” West Brom sporting
and technical director Dan Ashworth said in the statement.  Clarke is Scottish, and started his playing career at St.
Mirren before joining Chelsea, where he made 421 appearances and
won the F.A. and League cups. He retired in 1998.  Hodgson left West Brom at the end of last season to take
over  England . The team finished in 10th place in the 20-team
Premier League last season.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
