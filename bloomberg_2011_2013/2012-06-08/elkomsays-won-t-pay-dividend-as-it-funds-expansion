Telkom SA Ltd. (TKG) , Africa’s biggest
fixed-line telephone company, won’t pay a dividend for the year
ended March 31 because it plans to use any funds for expansion.  “The ordinary dividend has been considered with reference
to Telkom’s current and expected future challenges, performance,
debt and cash flow levels,” the Pretoria-based company said
today in a statement. “Telkom’s strategic objectives of network
transformation and the building of its mobile business will see
dividends being considered on an annual basis based on the
performance of the group.”  Increased competition in  South Africa  and a failed
expansion into  Nigeria  has cut  profit  excluding one-time items
at Africa’s largest fixed-line operator every year since 2006.
Telkom has paid dividends each year since 2004, with special
cash payments in five of the six years through 2010. A final
 payout  of 1.50 rand was expected, according to Bloomberg
dividend estimates. Telkom posted a net loss for fiscal 2012.  “The company has been harvested for a long time and now
there is nothing left to harvest,” Simon Fillmore, an analyst
at Independent Securities (Pty) Ltd., said by phone from
Johannesburg. “It has to start growing, and this will take
significant capital outlay.”  KT Blocked  South Africa’s cabinet decided a week ago to block the
planned 2.7 billion-rand ($321 million) sale of 20 percent of
Telkom to  KT Corp. (030200) ,  South Korea ’s biggest phone and Internet
provider. The government, which owns 40 percent of Telkom, is
considering a sale of stock to current Telkom investors or an
increase in debt to help fund a return to profit, Communications
Minister Dina Pule said on June 5.  The net loss attributable to shareholders in the 12 months
through March 31 was 216 million rand versus profit of 1.22
billion rand in fiscal 2011, the company said in the statement.  Telkom gained 0.9 percent to 20.68 rand at the close in
Johannesburg yesterday, paring its  decline  over the past five
days to 9.7 percent, the worst performance on the 162-stock
FTSE/JSE  Africa  All Share Index, which has gained 2.3 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
