Michael Frawley, the global head of
metals at Newedge USA LLC in New York, is leaving to join
 Jefferies Group Inc. (JEF) , according to a person with knowledge of
the move who asked not to be identified because the information
hasn’t been made public.  Frawley worked for more than 20 years at Newedge, formerly
known as Calyon Financial and Carr Futures. He served on the
board of the  London  Metal Exchange until 2009. Frawley’s duties
at Newedge will be taken over by John Fay, the company’s global
head of fixed income, currency and commodities, Nicole Wesch, a
Newedge spokeswoman in London, said by telephone yesterday.  As a Category 1 member of the LME, Newedge is one of a
dozen companies allowed to trade on the LME floor along with the
likes of Barclays Plc and JPMorgan Chase & Co.  Reuters reported the move to Jefferies yesterday. Frawley
didn’t return a telephone call seeking comment. Richard Khaleel,
a spokesman for New York-based Jefferies, declined to comment.  To contact the reporters on this story:
