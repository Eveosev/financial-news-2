Time Warner Inc. (TWX) , the owner of the
Warner Bros. movie studio, raised $1 billion in a two-part
offering at its lowest coupons on record, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  The company sold $500 million of 3.4 percent 10-year notes
that yield 180 basis points more than similar-maturity
Treasuries and an equal amount of 4.9 percent 30-year bonds with
a 225 basis-point spread, Bloomberg data show. Both spreads are
lower than initial talk of about 200 and 245 more than
Treasuries, according to a person familiar with the offering who
asked not to be named, citing lack of authorization to speak
publicly about the sale.  “Time Warner has performed well of late on the strength of
its cable networks and solid results from its film and
television studio,” Michael Hodel, a credit analyst at Chicago-
based Morningstar Inc., wrote today in a note. “A big reason
we’d hesitate to chase Time Warner here -- in addition to
generally tight spreads -- is that the firm has placed a heavy
emphasis on shareholder returns.”  Proceeds from the sale will be used for general corporate
purposes, according to a regulatory filing by New York-based
Time Warner.  The company last sold bonds Oct. 12, when it issued equal
$500 million portions of 4 percent, 10-year notes at 98.3 cents
on the dollar to yield 200 basis points more than similar-
maturity Treasuries and 30-year, 5.375 percent bonds at 99.37
cents with a 225 basis-point spread, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg. Those coupons were the company’s previous lows for
10- and 30-year debt.  Share Repurchases  The 10-year bonds rose to 105.97 cents on the dollar to
yield 3.27 percent at 11:17 a.m. in  New York  today, and the 30-
year debt traded at 105.9 cents to yield 4.99 percent at 2:47
p.m., according to Trace, the bond price reporting system of the
Financial Industry Regulatory Authority.  The company, which has $18.8 billion of  bonds outstanding ,
reported first-quarter earnings May 2 that beat analysts’
estimates on TV-advertising gains. Time Warner has repurchased
about $7 billion of its shares in the last 12 months, boosting
its ratio of debt to earnings before interest, taxes,
depreciation and amortization to 2.82 in the first quarter from
2.63 a year ago, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Moody’s Investors Service  rated  the new bonds Baa2, two
levels above speculative-grade debt, and  Standard & Poor’s 
graded them an equivalent BBB. Bank of America Corp., Barclays
Plc, BNP Paribas SA and Citigroup Inc. managed the sale,
according to the filing.  To contact the reporter on this story:
