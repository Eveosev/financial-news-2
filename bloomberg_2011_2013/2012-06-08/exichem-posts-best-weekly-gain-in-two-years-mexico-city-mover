Mexichem SAB (MEXCHEM*) , the chemical producer
that has bought more than 15 companies since 2007, posted its
biggest weekly rally in seven months after investor
presentations buoyed optimism over its  Wavin NV (WAVIN)  purchase.  Shares of the Tlalnepantla, Mexico-based company climbed
7.4 percent since June 1 to 53.31 pesos at the close of trading
in Mexico City, the biggest weekly gain since the five days
ended Oct. 21.  The shares added 1.5 percent today after the local unit of
 Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria SA (BBVA) , known as BBVA, raised its
recommendation to the equivalent of buy from hold.  Investors should be encouraged after Mexichem raised its
2012 sales target 30 percent to 5.7 billion pesos ($409 million)
at a May 31 investor presentation in  New York , Jean-Baptiste Bruny, a Mexico City-based analyst at BBVA, wrote in an e-mailed
research note today. The new figures take into account the
consolidation of Wavin, he said.  The company is poised for a “boom in sales” in part from
the consolidation of the Wavin deal, Bruny wrote. “Besides the
positive operating scenario, our positive stance is also backed
by the group’s confidence and the certainty it affords in a
volatile environment.”  The purchase of Wavin, a maker of plastic pipes for sewers,
is Mexichem’s largest acquisition.  Mexico’s benchmark  IPC (MEXBOL)  index increased 0.2 percent today,
extending its advance this week to 0.4 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
