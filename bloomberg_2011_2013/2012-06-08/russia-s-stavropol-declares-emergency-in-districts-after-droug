The  agriculture ministry  in Russia’s
southern Stavropol region declared a state of emergency in eight
of its 26 districts because of drought and is studying damage to
crops following hailstorms in six other districts yesterday.  The weather had a “very negative” impact on crops, Andrey
Krylovsky, head of the plant cultivation department at the
ministry, said by phone today. Another hailstorm is forecast for
today, he said, without giving an estimate of the potential
grain-crop loss in the region.  Authorities in Rostov, which had Russia’s third-biggest
local grain crop last year, declared an emergency in three of
the region’s 43 districts because of drought, said Mariam
Ananyan, spokeswoman for the regional agriculture ministry, by
e-mail today. Dryness in some other eastern and northeastern
districts in Rostov affected crops as well, she said.  Rains in June may revive many fields in the Rostov region,
where about 2.3 percent of the sown area was damaged by drought,
she said. “It is not a critical figure, but of course it will
decrease the crop forecast,” Ananyan said. The harvest may be
“somewhat smaller than a year earlier,” she said, without
elaborating.  Stavropol had  Russia ’s second-biggest regional grain crop
last year after gathering 8.2 million metric tons of cereals, or
8.7 percent of the total national harvest, according to state
statistics. Rostov harvested 7.7 million tons, or 8.2 percent of
the country’s total crop last year, the data show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
