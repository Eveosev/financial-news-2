Russia may charge two more people
with participating in mass unrest and using violence against
police, crimes that carry a maximum sentence of eight years in
jail, the Investigative Committee said.  The charges relate to a mass protest in Moscow on May 6
against President  Vladimir Putin ’s re-election, the law-
enforcement agency in Moscow  said  on its website today.
Prosecutors have charged one person with these offenses.  Russian lawmakers this week approved a disputed bill that
increases the maximum fine for protesters who violate the law
150-fold to 300,000 rubles ($9,160) from 2,000 rubles and to as
much as 600,000 rubles for organizers.  The opposition, which hasn’t received permission yet to
hold its next planned march in Moscow on June 12, condemned the
initiative as an attempt to stifle the constitutional right to
free assembly. A presidential human rights commission asked
Putin not to sign the measure into law, saying it violates the
Constitution.  To contact the reporter on this story:
