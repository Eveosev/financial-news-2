China ’s first interest rate cut since
2008 and loosened controls on lending and deposit rates are a
“sign of panic” and will not do anything to boost the economy,
 Jim Walker , chief economist at Asianomics Ltd. said.  “The timing is a surprise but I suspect it demonstrates
just how weak the Chinese economy really is,” Hong Kong-based
Walker said today in an e-mail. “We believe that it is pretty
close to recession.”  China’s rate cut may signal that the world's second-
biggest economy is weaker than the government anticipated, 
with reports on  inflation , investment and  output  in May due
to be released tomorrow. The move is a signal that “the whole
world is heading into recession,” according to Walker.  The central bank's move may backfire if it “further 
dissuades people from putting money into savings and time 
deposits,” Walker said. “If anything, banks will need to 
raise their lending rates because their cost of funds is 
going up.”  Walker was formerly chief economist at CLSA Asia-Pacific
Markets and was voted the best regional economist in an
Asiamoney magazine brokers’ poll for 11 years through 2004.  To contact the Bloomberg News staff on this story:
