Friday in the city calls for rooftop
drinks.  Upstairs at the Kimberly Hotel  has a refreshing seasonal
mix of watermelon, fresh pineapple and vodka, called the
Electrolyte.  There’s also the Chrysler, made from cognac and champagne
which would be nice to sip while viewing its gleaming Art Deco
namesake as the sun goes down.  At 145 E. 50th St. Information: +1-212-888-1220;

Roberts at  Manhattan ’s  Blue Note .  The two will play songs from their CD “Across the

solos.  Their rhythm section features Rodney Jordan on bass and

production of “Onegin,” choreographed by John Cranko to music
by Tchaikovsky.  Pushkin’s story of Imperial Russia comes alive with fancy
balls and a fatal duel. While country lass Tatiana and aristo
Eugene can’t quite agree to be enamored at the same time, you’ll
get a good lesson in love-letter-writing -- that early 19th
century form of social networking.  ABT at the  Metropolitan Opera ,  Lincoln Center  at 2 p.m. and
8 p.m. Information: +1-212-362-6000;  http://www.abt.org .  It was announced Friday that I’ll Have Another won’t run in

of “’Scuse Me While I Whip This Out” and “Cowboy Logic,” has
his boots on the ground at  Highline Ballroom  for The Bi-Polar
Tour.  While his old jokes are loved by many, he’ll have some
fresh material since he’s just co-authored the book “ The Billy
Bob Tapes: A Cave Full of Ghosts ” with Billy Bob Thornton.  Expect to hear stories about Thornton’s life, loves and odd
phobias told in Kinky’s singular way.  At 431 W. 16th St. Information: +1-212-414-5994;

Abstraction and the Guggenheim, 1949-1960”  opening this

who produced a diverse and definitively radical body of work
throughout the 1950s.  Largely unknown art by Asger Jorn,  Jackson Pollock ,

Bourgeois  and  Alexander Calder  fill the spiral rotunda
galleries.  Have brunch of steak and eggs or buttermilk pancakes in the
