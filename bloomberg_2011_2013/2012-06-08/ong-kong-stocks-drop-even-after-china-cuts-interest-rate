(Corrects date of economic reports in first paragraph.)  Hong Kong  stocks  fell before reports
on  China ’s inflation and manufacturing tomorrow amid concern the
China’s economy is slowing. Shares fell even after the nation’s
first interest rate cut since 2008.  The Hang Seng Index slid 0.5 percent to 18,583.70 as of
9:37 a.m. local time, with more than twice as many stocks
declining as rising in the 49-member gauge. The  Hang Seng China
Enterprises Index (HSCEI)  of mainland stocks dropped 0.7 percent to
9,410.29.  Hang Seng Index futures expiring this month slid 0.2
percent to 18,476. The HSI Volatility Index gained 1.9 percent
to 27.46, indicating traders expect a swing of about 7.9 percent
in the benchmark index during the next 30 days.  To contact the reporter on this story:
