McGraw-Hill Cos. (MHP)  named Lloyd “Buzz”
Waterhouse as president and chief executive officer of McGraw-
Hill Education, ahead of the parent’s planned split into two
companies.  Waterhouse, a former CEO of Harcourt Education, will step
into the role on June 14, New York-based McGraw-Hill said today
in a statement. The company said last month that Robert Bahash,
president of the education business, would retire.  McGraw-Hill, the owner of Standard & Poor’s, is in the
process of splitting into two, with one company focused on
education and the other on financial information. The division
is expected to be completed this year, McGraw-Hill has said.  Waterhouse also spent 26 years at International Business
Machines Corp., where he was general manager of E-Business
Services.  His experience in education and new technologies will help
McGraw-Hill “in the new era of global digital learning,”
Harold “Terry” McGraw, the company’s CEO, said in the
statement.  McGraw-Hill Financial will include the  Standard & Poor’s 
ratings service, S&P Indices, Platts energy information services
and J.D. Power & Associates.  McGraw-Hill fell 1.4 percent to $43.17 at 9:54 a.m. in  New
York .  To contact the reporter on this story:
