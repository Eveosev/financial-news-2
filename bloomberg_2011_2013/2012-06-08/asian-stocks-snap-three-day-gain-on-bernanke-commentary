Asian  stocks  fell, paring the first
weekly advance in six weeks, amid concern that central banks are
struggling to reinforce global demand amid Europe’s worsening
debt crisis.  Sony Corp. (6758) , Japan’s No. 1 exporter of consumer electronics,
slid 5.1 percent.  BHP Billiton Ltd. (BHP) , the world’s largest mining
company, gained 1.2 percent in Sydney after China cut its
benchmark  interest rate  for the first time since 2008 and metals
prices climbed.  Renesas Electronics Corp. (6723)  soared as much as 19
percent on a report the maker of automotive microcontrollers was
scrapping a share sale.  The  MSCI Asia-Pacific (MXAP)  slid 1.5 percent to 111.63 as of 6:30
p.m. in Hong Kong, snapping three days of gains and paring its
gain this week to 0.2 percent. Three stocks fell for every one
that gained. The gauge dropped 13 percent from its peak this
year on Feb. 29. through yesterday amid concern growth is
slowing in  China  and the U.S. and as Spain tries to overcome
German opposition to allow the use of regional bailout funds to
recapitalize lenders directly.  “The key issue really is around European sovereign debt
and having some permanent resolution,” said  Donald Williams ,
chief investment officer at Platypus Asset Management Ltd. that
manages about $1 billion. “Even though China’s rate cut was
unexpected, people are selling because it confirms in their
minds that the growth outlook is problematic. Europeans have to
come up with a structure that’s going to underwrite the balance
sheets of countries that are in a trouble.”  Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  refrained
yesterday from discussing any stimulus action the central bank
might take to boost economic expansion in the U.S. On the same
day, China cut borrowing costs for the first time since 2008 and
loosened controls on banks’ lending and deposit rates, stepping
up efforts to combat a deepening slowdown as Europe’s debt
crisis threatens global growth.  Regional Indexes  Japan’s  Nikkei 225 (NKY)  lost 2 percent. South Korea’s Kospi
Index slid 0.6 percent as the Bank of Korea held off from
altering borrowing costs for a 12th straight month. Australia’s
S&P/ASX 200 Index retreated 1.1 percent.  Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index retreated 0.9 percent and
China’s Shanghai Composite Index was little changed.  China’s rate cut comes ahead of data on industrial
production, inflation and trade due to be released this weekend.  “The timing of the cut may suggest that macro data in May
could be worse than the market had expected,” Lu Ting, Hong
Kong-based head of economics for greater China at Bank of
America Corp., wrote in a report. “Despite cuts of growth
forecasts since mid-May, market consensus might still be too
high.”  S&P 500  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index fell 0.5 percent
today. The gauge closed little changed yesterday, paring earlier
gains as Bernanke said the central bank will assess the  U.S.
economy  before deciding if more stimulus is needed and after a
report that Greece’s upcoming election could be derailed.  In  Spain , Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy said he’s talking to
his European peers about how to shore up the country’s banks as
 Fitch Ratings  cut Spain’s credit grade to within two steps of
junk.  The MSCI Asia-Pacific fell 0.7 percent  this year  through
yesterday, compared with a 0.8 percent drop on the Stoxx Europe
600 Index and a 4.6 percent gain on the  S&P 500 . Declines in
regional equity markets cut the average price of stocks on the
Asian benchmark to 11.5 times estimated earnings. That compares
with 12.6 times for the S&P 500 and a multiple of 10.1 for the
Stoxx 600.  Exporters Fall  Exporters to the U.S. fell.  Mazda Motor Corp. (7261) , an automaker
that gets 28 percent of its sales in  North America  slid 3.9

Japanese drug maker that gets 31 percent of its sales in the
U.S., dropped 2.5 percent to 751 yen. Li & Fung Ltd., the

generated in Europe, slumped 4.8 percent to 80 yen.  Hutchison
Whampoa Ltd. (13) , an operator of retail chains that gets 55 percent
of sales in Europe, lost 1.3 percent to HK$62.80 in Hong Kong.  BHP Billiton climbed 1.2 percent to A$31.95 in Sydney.
Hyundai Steel Co., South Korea’s second-biggest steelmaker,

industrial metals including copper and aluminum gained 1.2
percent yesterday.  Renesas Electronics rose 14 percent to 304 yen after the
