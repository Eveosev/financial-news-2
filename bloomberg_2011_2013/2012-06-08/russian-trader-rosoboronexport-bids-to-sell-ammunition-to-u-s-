Rosoboronexport,  Russia ’s state-run
weapons trader, said it’s bidding to sell ammunition to the U.S.
armed forces.  Five suppliers competing for a U.S. military contract have
invited Rosoboronexport to act as a sub-contractor, the Moscow-
based company said today in an e-mailed statement. The
ammunition would be used in international coalition operations,
it said.  The U.S. barred transactions with Rosoboronexport from 2006
to 2010, citing its arms sales to nations including Iran and
Syria as violating efforts to curb proliferation of weapons of
mass destruction. The lifting of the sanctions coincided with
Russia’s support of a United Nations resolution expressing
concern over  Iran’s nuclear program , according to the
Congressional Research Service.  The U.S. Army agreed last May to pay $375 million for 21
Russian-made MI-17 helicopters for the Afghan  air force , which
has been flying the craft for 30 years. Some U.S. lawmakers have
urged the Pentagon to cancel the helicopter contract because
Russia remains a top arms supplier to Syrian President Bashar al-Assad.  To contact the reporter on this story:
