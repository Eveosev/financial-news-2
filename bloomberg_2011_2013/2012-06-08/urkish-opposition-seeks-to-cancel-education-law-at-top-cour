Turkey ’s main opposition party will
file a second legal appeal today at the  Constitutional Court  to
nullify the government’s education overhaul, the state-run
Anatolia news agency said.  The Republican People’s Party, or CHP’s previous attempt to
get the law canceled on technical grounds was rejected by the
top court in May, the agency said. The legislation extends
mandatory schooling to 12 years from eight years and allows for
Islamic studies to start at an earlier age.  To contact the reporter on this story:
