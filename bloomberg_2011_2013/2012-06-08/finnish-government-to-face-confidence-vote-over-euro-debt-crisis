The euro-skeptic “The Finns” Party
filed a no-confidence motion against Prime Minister  Jyrki Katainen ’s government, the party in Helsinki said in an e-mailed
statement today.  The motion relates to costs incurred by Finland from
bailouts and measures to counter the debt crisis, including
possible recapitalization of Spanish banks, proposed common
euro-area bonds and using  Europe ’s rescue funds for direct aid
to banks. Finland is one of four remaining AAA rated euro
nations.  The no-confidence motion is the third filed by “The
Finns” over the debt crisis during the government’s 11-month
tenure. Katainen’s cabinet is backed by 124 lawmakers of the
parliament’s 200.  To contact the reporter on this story:
