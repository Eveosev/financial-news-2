The ruble depreciated the most in a
week against the dollar and yields on  Russia ’s bonds rose as
oil, the country’s main export, declined.  The Russian currency lost 1.6 percent to 32.7715 per dollar
by the 7 p.m. close in Moscow, the sharpest daily slide since
May 31. Russia’s $2 billion of bonds due 2022 fell, increasing
the yield by four basis points, or 0.04 percentage point, to
4.096 percent.  Brent crude  sank 2 percent to $97.92 per barrel after
Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said yesterday that the
U.S. needs to assess the risk from Europe’s debt crisis before
deciding on stimulus measures. West Texas Intermediate crude is
poised for the longest weekly losing streak in more than 13
years.  “Brent is down to $98 per barrel, and overall global
market sentiment got worse today,”  Alexander Morozov , chief
economist for Russia and the Commonwealth of Independent States
at HSBC Holdings Plc in Moscow, said by e-mail. “For the ruble,
 oil prices  still matter a lot. Besides, the ruble’s recent gains
were too strong to be sustained.”  The ruble declined 0.4 percent to 40.7125 per euro and lost
0.8 percent to 36.2864 against the central bank’s target dollar-
euro basket. Investors increased bets on the currency weakening,
with non-deliverable forwards showing the ruble at 33.1585 per
dollar in three months, compared with expectations of 32.7655
per dollar yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
