Erste Group Bank AG (EBS)  led Czech shares
lower, paring the biggest weekly gain in four months for the
country’s index, after the U.S. Federal Reserve damped
expectations for monetary stimulus and German exports dropped.  Austria’s Erste slid 1.1 percent to 365 koruna by 9:30 a.m.
in  Prague , paring gains this week to 2.5 percent. The  PX (PX)  gauge,
in which Erste has an 18 percent weighting, fell 0.5 percent.
The benchmark is still up 3.4 percent this week, headed for the
biggest rally since the five days ended Feb. 3.  To contact the reporter on this story:
