Australian home-loan approvals rose
in April for a second straight month, as buyers responded to the
central bank’s back-to-back reductions in  interest rates  late
last year.  The number of loans granted to build or buy houses and
apartments gained 0.2 percent from March, when they rose a
revised 0.8 percent, the statistics bureau said in Sydney today.
The median estimate in a Bloomberg News survey of 17 economists
was for no change in approvals.  The report, and others this week showing an unexpected
increase in employment and faster-than-forecast growth, add to
the case for  Reserve Bank  of Australia Governor  Glenn Stevens  to
pause rate reductions at next month’s meeting. The RBA cut the
benchmark by 75 basis points over the past two meetings to shore
up the economy as weakness in Europe and  China  threaten the
global outlook.  “Looser monetary settings are improving affordability and
encouraging buyers back into the market, albeit in a limited
capacity,” Katrina Ell, an economist at Moody’s Analytics in
Sydney, said before the release.  Today’s report showed the total value of loans rose 1.2
percent to A$20.5 billion ($20.2 billion) in April.  The value of lending to owner-occupiers gained 0.9 percent,
the report showed. The value of loans to investors who plan to
rent or resell homes advanced 1.7 percent.  First-home buyers accounted for 16.8 percent of dwellings
that were financed in April, up from 16.4 percent in March and
lower than 17.1 percent a year earlier, the report showed today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
