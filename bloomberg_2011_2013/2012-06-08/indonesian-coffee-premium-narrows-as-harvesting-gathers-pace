Buyers of coffee from  Indonesia , the
third-biggest robusta grower, are paying a smaller premium for
their beans this week as harvesting gathers pace, according to
Volcafe, a unit of ED&F Man Holdings Ltd.  Indonesian beans for June and July shipment were at a
premium of $10 a metric ton to prices on the NYSE Liffe exchange
in  London , the Winterthur, Switzerland-based trader said in a
report to clients e-mailed today. That compares with a $20
premium last week, Volcafe data show.  About 70 percent to 80 percent of the coffee grown in
lowlands has already been harvested, according to the report.
Pickings in highlands currently amount to about 20 percent, the
trader said. Indonesia will produce 9.1 million bags of coffee
in 2012-13, up from 6.2 million bags a year earlier, Volcafe
estimated in a quarterly report last month. A bag of coffee
weighs 60 kilograms (132 pounds).  Bean deliveries to port in Indonesia were “quite stable”
at about 7,500 to 8,000 tons this week, Volcafe said.  The local
industry was “quite active,” buying as much as 5,000 tons of
robusta from Lampung.  Buyers of coffee from  Vietnam , the world’s largest robusta
grower, were paying a premium of $10 a ton to exchange prices
for June and July shipment, Volcafe data showed. Last week the
beans sold at NYSE Liffe prices. There was “hardly any coffee
on offer,” the trader said in the report.  In  India ,  Asia ’s third-biggest producer, there was almost
no robusta left, Volcafe said.  Robusta for July delivery fell 1.8 percent to $2,084 a ton
by 2:53 p.m. in London.  To contact the reporter on this story:
