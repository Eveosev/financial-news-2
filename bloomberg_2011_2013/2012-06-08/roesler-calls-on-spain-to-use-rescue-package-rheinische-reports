Germany  encourages  Spain  to make use
of the euro rescue program,  Rheinische Post  reported, citing an
interview with German Economy Minister Philipp Roesler in a
preview of an article due to appear tomorrow.  If Spain needs help stabilizing its banking system, it
should promptly use existing mechanisms to apply to the European
Financial Stability Facility, the newspaper cited Roesler as
saying.  He added that it was up to Spain to strengthen confidence
in the stability of its banks and make the cost of
recapitalization clear, the newspaper reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
