UEFA, European soccer’s governing
body, is preparing measures to prevent racist chanting after an
incident at a public practice of the Dutch national team in
Krakow as the squad warms up for the regional championship.  “UEFA has now be made aware that there was some isolated
incidents of racist chanting that occurred at the open training
session,” the governing body said in a statement released to
journalists today. “UEFA has not yet received any formal
complaint.”  The European Championship opens tonight in Poland and
Ukraine, with the region’s top 16 teams meeting in an event that
ends July 1. UEFA has faced questions about the decision to
award Ukraine hosting rights to the competition, the most
watched in sports after soccer’s  World Cup  and the summer
Olympics.  UEFA said it will monitor training sessions and will take
measures to protect players, including adding stewards around
practice areas. The governing body said it will work with police
and local soccer clubs to identify people involved in racist
behavior.  To contact the reporter on this story:
