Two North Sea Flotta cargoes for
loading in June were delayed because of lower-than-expected
production, according to an official at  Talisman Energy Inc. (TLM) ,
which operates the field.  The first cargo was deferred by 12 days and will load now
from June 26 to June 28, while the second originally for June 27
to June 29 will be shipped in July, said the official who
declined to be identified citing company policy. Both shipments
are for 600,000 barrels each.  The shipping schedule of Flotta for July will be released
later today or next week, he said.  Loading programs are monthly schedules of crude shipments
compiled by field operators to allow buyers and sellers to plan
their supply and trading activities.  To contact the reporter on this story:
