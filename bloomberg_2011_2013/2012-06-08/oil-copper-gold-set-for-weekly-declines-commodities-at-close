The Standard & Poor’s GSCI  gauge  of
24 commodities fell 2 percent to 580.33 at 5:23 p.m. Singapore
time. The UBS Bloomberg CMCI  index  of 26 raw materials fell 1.5
percent to 1,421.224.  CRUDE OIL  Oil fell a second day in New York, heading for the longest
run of weekly losses in more than 13 years, on speculation the
economies of the U.S. and  China , the world’s biggest crude
consumers, will slow and curb fuel demand.  Oil for July delivery decreased as much as $2.72 to $82.10
a barrel in electronic trading on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange , and was at $82.23 at 9:15 a.m. London time. The
contract yesterday slipped 0.2 percent to $84.82, the lowest
close since June 5. Prices are down 5 percent this month and
poised for a sixth weekly decline, the longest losing streak
since December 1998. Oil has fallen 17 percent this year.  NATURAL GAS  Natural gas futures in  New York  extended the biggest
decline in four months as a government report showed that U.S.
stockpiles rose more than forecast.  OIL PRODUCTS  Singapore gasoil swaps for July fell $1.10, or 1 percent,
to $111.55 a barrel, PVM data showed. Prices are 1.2 percent
lower this week, headed for a sixth weekly loss.  The premium of gasoil to Dubai crude rose 46 cents, or 2.9
percent, to $16.22 a barrel today. The spread increased for a
second week.  Jet fuel traded at a premium of 80 cents a barrel to
gasoil. This spread, also known as the regrade, is 10 cents
lower than a week earlier.  Naphtha swaps for July slid $20.75, or 2.6 percent, to
$766.50 a metric ton at 10:30 a.m. Singapore time, according to
data from PVM Oil Associates Ltd., a broker.  Singapore fuel oil’s discount to Dubai crude, a measure of
refining losses from the fuel, shrank 46 cents to $1 a barrel
today, PVM data showed. The discount was little changed from
$1.09 a week earlier.  PRECIOUS METALS  Gold declined and headed for its worst week in four as
Federal Reserve Chairman Ben S. Bernanke damped expectations for
monetary stimulus. Silver was set for its longest run of weekly
losses in more than 11 years.  Bullion for immediate delivery fell 1.3 percent to
$1,569.52 an ounce by 9:29 a.m. in  London . It’s down 3.4 percent
this week, the most since May 11. August-delivery futures were
1.1 percent lower at $1,570.40 on the Comex in New York.  BASE METALS  Copper declined the most in a week as policy makers are
being pressed into action to shore up a global economy that is
suffering its steepest slowdown since the recession ended in
2009. Zinc, aluminum, lead and nickel fell.  GRAINS, SOFT COMMODITIES  July-delivery corn lost 0.9 percent to $5.885 a bushel,
trimming the weekly gain to 6.7 percent, the first such advance
in three weeks. Wheat for July delivery slipped 1.1 percent to
$6.345 a bushel, paring the weekly increase to 3.6 percent.  Soybeans fell, ending a four-day rally, on concern that a
lack of stimulus from the U.S. may further slowdown the global
economy and overshadow signs of rising demand.  November-delivery soybeans lost as much as 1.8 percent to
$13.17 a bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade. Futures traded at
$13.21 a bushel at 2:21 p.m. Singapore time, paring the weekly
advance to 5 percent. That’s the biggest increase in a week
since the five days ended Oct. 14.  Rubber retreated for a fifth week after Federal Reserve
Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said the central bank will wait before
deciding if economic stimulus is needed, spurring sales of
commodities and stocks.  November-delivery rubber fell 2.4 percent to settle at
237.6 yen a kilogram ($3,001 a metric ton) on the Tokyo
Commodity Exchange. Futures lost 6.9 percent this week, the
largest drop since the week ended May 11.  Palm oil  dropped to the lowest level in seven months, set
for a second weekly decline, after Godrej International Ltd.
Director  Dorab Mistry  forecast that prices may tumble as a
slowdown in China and Europe curbs demand.  To contact the reporter on this story:
