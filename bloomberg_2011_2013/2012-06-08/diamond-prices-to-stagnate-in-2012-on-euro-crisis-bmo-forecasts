Rough diamond prices are set to
remain at current levels for the rest of the year as the
 European debt crisis  saps demand, BMO Capital Markets forecast.  “Ongoing uncertainty related to the euro-zone debt crisis
and the sustainability of economic growth in other parts of the
world may weigh on sentiment in the rough diamond market,”
analyst Ed Sterck wrote in a report. “BMO Research expects
rough diamond prices to remain at current levels for the
remainder of 2012.”  Rough diamond prices have slipped 2 percent so far this
year, according to data compiled by WWW International Diamond
Consultants Ltd. Prices have risen by more than 20 percent in
each of the past three years as producers struggled to keep pace
with consumption.  The mid-to-long-term outlook for diamonds remains
“positive,” BMO said as constrained output will struggle to
match growing demand for the precious stones. BMO forecast that
diamond prices will gain 3 percent next year and rise 5 percent
to 7 percent in the following years.  To contact the reporter on this story:
