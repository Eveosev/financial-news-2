Empresas Copec SA (COPEC) ,  Chile ’s biggest
forestry company, erased a decline in Santiago trading after
agreeing to a buy wood panel producer in North America.  Copec gained as much as 1.7 percent to 7,290 pesos,
recovering from a 1.1 percent decline. The stock was trading at
7,200 pesos at 1:28 p.m. local time, up 0.4 percent.  Celulosa Arauco & Constitucion SA, Copec’s pulp and
forestry unit, agreed to pay $243 million for all shares in
Flakeboard Co., the Canadian producer of fiberboard and
particleboard used to build furniture and countertops, according
to a  statement  on the website of Chile’s securities regulator.  “Once the acquisition is finalized, Arauco will be able to
produce as much as 2.9 million cubic meters of panels a year in
 North America ,” according to the statement. “The transaction
is estimated to have a positive effect on Arauco results,” the
company said, without elaborating.  The transaction may proceed in the second half of the year
after regulatory approvals, Arauco said. Flakeboard operates two
plants in Canada and five in the U.S.  To contact the reporter on this story:
