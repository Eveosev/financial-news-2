“God wants to increase you
financially,” preaches Joel Osteen, author of “Your Best Life
Now.”  (To listen to the podcast, click  here .)  Rich guys aiming for heaven needn’t worry any longer about
the camel passing through the needle’s eye conundrum, since God
is now united with Mammon.  Ross Douthat’s new book, “Bad Religion: How We Became a
Nation of Heretics,” takes on the current corruptions of
Christianity in America, among them prosperity theology.  Combining Christianity and entrepreneurial capitalism, the
new theme is pray and grow rich. During the financial crisis,
Osteen made his message even clearer: “You need a bigger
vision: God, I’m asking to be debt-free.”  Even as his followers struggled economically, Osteen’s
television ratings rose, his most recent book flew off the
shelves and he sold out Yankee Stadium.  I spoke with Douthat on the following topics:  1. Weaker Church  2. Pop Spirituality  3. Prosperity Gospel  4. The God Within  5. Christian Politics  To buy this book in  North America , click  here .  ( Lewis Lapham  is the founder of  Lapham’s Quarterly  and the
