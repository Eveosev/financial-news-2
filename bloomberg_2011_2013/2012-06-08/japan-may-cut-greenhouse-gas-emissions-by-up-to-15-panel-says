Japan ’s greenhouse gas emissions may
drop as much as 15 percent by 2020 from 1990 levels if the
country increases the use of energy saving measures and clean
energy, an environment ministry taskforce said.  The taskforce debating Japan’s low-carbon policies and
measures after 2013 plans to propose six different scenarios for
emission cuts to the government, according to a draft report
released today. Japan’s existing pledge is to cut greenhouse gas
emissions by 25 percent from 1990 levels in 2020.  Should Japan reduce its reliance on nuclear power to 15
percent by 2030, the country can achieve an emissions cut of 15
percent by 2020 and a 31 percent reduction by 2030, according to
one of the scenarios.  The country is reviewing its energy policy and goals to
reduce emissions after the March 2011 earthquake and tsunami
resulted in meltdowns and radiation leaks at  Tokyo Electric
Power Co. (9501) ’s Fukushima Dai-Ichi plant. Nuclear power provided
about 30 percent of the country’s electricity before the crisis.  The government will review the scenarios by the environment
ministry task force and earlier proposals on the country’s
energy mix by an industry ministry panel before making a final
decision in the summer.  To contact the reporter on this story:
