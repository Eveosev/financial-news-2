Gulf Coast  gasoline weakened as
Motiva Enterprises was said to plan a June 10 start of the new
325,000-barrel-a-day crude unit at its Port Arthur, Texas,
refinery.  The unit, shut June 3 to repair damage from a small fire,
could near full rates within a day of the restart, said a person
with knowledge of operations at the plant who declined to be
identified because he isn’t authorized to speak for the company.  The discount for conventional, 87-octane gasoline in the
Gulf Coast narrowed 2.5 cents to 11 cents a gallon versus
futures traded on the  New York Mercantile Exchange  at 12:07 p.m.
local time, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Prompt
delivery fell 6.97 cents to $2.5303 a gallon.  The Port Arthur crude unit, the largest of three at the
plant, part of a $10 billion expansion, began operating in May.
The plant is the largest in the U.S.  The premium for conventional gasoline to be blended with
ethanol, or CBOB, in  New York  rose 3.35 cents to 4.6 cents a
gallon versus futures. It’s the highest level since April 4.  The differential for reformulated gasoline in New York
Harbor, or RBOB, rose 0.75 cents to 9.88 cents a gallon.  Petroplus Holdings AG’s Coryton refinery in the U.K., began
a shutdown process on June 6 and will be out of production by
June 12 or June 13, Russ Ball, an official at Unite, the U.K.’s
largest labor union, said by phone.  To contact the reporter on this story:
