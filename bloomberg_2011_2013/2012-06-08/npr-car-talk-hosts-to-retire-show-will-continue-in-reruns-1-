“Car Talk,”  NPR ’s call-in radio
show featuring two wisecracking  Boston  mechanics, will cease
production this fall, though the program will continue to air in
reruns.  Future shows will draw on 25 years of material from Tom and
Ray Magliozzi, also known as Click and Clack the Tappet
Brothers, according to  a statement  on NPR’s website. “Car
Talk” has aired on NPR since 1987, after beginning as a local
broadcast from Boston’s WBUR station in 1977.  The hour-long show, which airs weekly on Saturday mornings,
has 3.3 million listeners, according to Anna Christopher, a
spokeswoman for NPR. It has the largest audience for an NPR
program when measured by any 15-minute segment, she said.  Tom Magliozzi, the older of the two brothers, will turn 75
this year.  “My brother has always been ‘work-averse,” Ray Magliozzi,
63, said in the statement. “Now, apparently, even the one hour
a week is killing him.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
