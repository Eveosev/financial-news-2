Lithuanian  inflation  was the slowest
in 20 months in May as growth of food and beverage prices eased.  Consumer prices rose 2.5 percent from a year earlier,
compared with a 3.2 percent increase in April, the  statistics
office , based in the capital, Vilnius, said today in an e-mailed
statement. The median estimate of five economists in a Bloomberg
survey was for a 2.6 percent increase. Prices increased 0.1
percent from the previous month.  Decelerating inflation will help shore up the Baltic
nation’s domestic consumption and economic expansion, which
slowed to 3.9 percent in the first quarter. Improving inflation
expectations helped raise consumer sentiment to the highest in
eight months in May.  Lithuania also needs price growth to ease to qualify for
its planned euro adoption in 2014. Countries seeking to make the
currency change must keep inflation at less than 1.5 percentage
points above the average of the three lowest levels in the
European Union.  Lithuania’s 12-month consumer-price growth was 4.1 percent
in April, according to Eurostat, while the threshold for the
currency changeover was 3.1 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
