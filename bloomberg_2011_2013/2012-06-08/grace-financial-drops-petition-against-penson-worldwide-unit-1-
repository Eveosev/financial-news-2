Grace Financial Group LLC, a  Long
Island , New York-based broker-dealer serving  hedge funds  and
investment advisers, dropped a request for an injunction against
a unit of  Penson Worldwide Inc. (PNSN)   Grace Financial, based in Southampton, on May 31 filed a
petition in New York state  Supreme Court  in Manhattan asking a
judge to force Penson Financial Services Inc. to continue
servicing trades under an agreement between the companies.  The petition was withdrawn without prejudice, according to
a stipulation between the two sides dated June 4. Grace
Financial dropped the case, said Mark G. Hanchet, an attorney
with Mayer Brown LLP representing Penson Financial Services.  “They basically determined there was no point in going
forward,” Hanchet said in a telephone interview.  Timothy P. Kebbe, an attorney representing Grace Financial,
didn’t respond to a message seeking comment on the withdrawal of
the petition, which had sought to stop Penson Financial Services
from terminating the agreement or changing any services it
provides. The company is a unit of Dallas-based Penson
Worldwide.  Penson Financial had told Grace Financial on May 25 that it
would stop settling and clearing trades and acting as a
custodian for securities traded on local markets outside the
U.S., according to the petition.  The case is Grace Financial Group LLC v. Penson Financial
Services Inc., 651872/2012,  New York  state Supreme Court
(Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
