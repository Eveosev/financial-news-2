repurchase rate unchanged at 3.25 percent yesterday. Philippine
President  Benigno Aquino  said he expects better growth in the
coming quarters, after the economy expanded at the fastest pace
since 2010 last quarter. Asian currencies pared their weekly
advance after Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said
fresh monetary stimulus will need further assessment.  “China has the scope to take more measures to cushion the
economic slowdown,” said Sim Moh Siong, a currency strategist
at Bank of Singapore Ltd. “The outlook for Asian economies is
still cloudy because the global situation, especially in Europe,
is still one of muddling along.”  Malaysia’s ringgit led with a 0.8 percent weekly advance to
3.185 versus its U.S. counterpart as of 5:42 p.m. yesterday in
 Kuala Lumpur , according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The peso

subsidies to support the currency and lure investors as the

 power plants , roads and bridges.  The  MSCI Asia-Pacific Index (MXAP)  of regional shares dropped 1.3
percent yesterday, halting a three-day advance and trimming its
gain for the week to 0.1 percent, after Bernanke told lawmakers
the central bank will assess economic conditions before deciding
if a third round of so-called quantitative easing is needed.  “There are still jitters on the global front and at best
the U.S. wants to keep the QE3 possibility vague for now,” said
 Enrico Tanuwidjaja , a Singapore-based senior currency analyst at
 Malayan Banking Bhd. (MAY)   Overseas Selling  Overseas investors sold $550 million more shares than they
bought in Indonesia, South Korea, Taiwan and Thailand this week,

currencies of export-driven economies like Thailand will be
affected,” Tanuwidjaja said.  The baht declined 0.5 percent to 31.71 per dollar, paring a
weekly advance to 0.6 percent.  Elsewhere, Indonesia’s rupiah gained 0.6 percent this week
