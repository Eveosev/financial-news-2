The Czech Republic’s  PX (PX)  stock index
snapped a four-day rally, sliding 0.8 percent to 886 by the
close in  Prague  and paring its weekly gain to 3.1 percent.  The following were among the most active equities on Prague
Stock Exchange today. Stock symbols follow company names.  CEZ AS (CEZ)  , the country’s biggest utility, fell from a
five-week high, losing 1.1 percent to 745 koruna. Electricity
for next-year delivery in Germany, where CEZ exports part of its
output, declined 0.5 percent to 48.05 euros per megawatt-hour,
