Johnson & Johnson (JNJ)  will set aside $600
million in the second quarter to increase its reserves for
potential settlements of civil lawsuits alleging it illegally
marketed drugs including the anti-psychotic Risperdal.  J&J established a $1.7 billion fund in 2011 for litigation
settlements, the  New Brunswick , New Jersey-based company said in
its January earnings report. An Arkansas state judge in April
ordered J&J to pay more than $1.1 billion for illegally
marketing and misleading doctors and patients about the risks of
Risperdal starting in 2002. J&J, the world’s top seller of
health-care products, said it will appeal.  The $600 million will be used if settlements are reached in
previously disclosed civil cases regarding Risperdal, the anti-
psychotic Invega and  Omnicare Inc. (OCR) , which distributes
pharmaceuticals to nursing homes and assisted living facilities,
J&J said yesterday in a statement. The money will also be used
for cases involving the heart failure drug Natrecor. J&J pleaded
guilty to misbranding the drug in September and agreed to pay an
$85 million fine.  Bill Price , a J&J spokesman, said the company wouldn’t
comment beyond the statement.  J&J gained less than 1 percent to $62.98 yesterday at the
close in New York. The shares have declined 4.8 percent in the
past 12 months.  The U.S.  Justice Department  demanded in March that J&J pay
about $1.8 billion to resolve the civil claims by the U.S. and
some states, an increase from a $1 billion settlement that had
been negotiated by the U.S. Attorney’s Office in Philadelphia in
late December.  To contact the reporter on this story:
