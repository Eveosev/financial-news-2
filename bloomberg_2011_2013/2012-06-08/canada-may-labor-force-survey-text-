Following is the text of  Canada ’s
labor force survey released by  Statistics Canada .  Following two months of large gains, employment was unchanged
in May, and the unemployment rate remained at 7.3%.  Compared with 12 months earlier, employment increased
1.2% or 203,000. Virtually all of this growth was in
full-time work, up 192,000 (+1.4%). The total number of
hours worked rose 1.3% over the same period.  Employment for the month increased in manufacturing,
educational services, retail and wholesale trade, and
agriculture. At the same time, information, culture and
recreation as well as construction showed declines.  Provincially, employment rose in  Alberta  and  New
Brunswick , while it fell in Prince  Edward Island . There
was little change in the other provinces.  In May, employment increased among men aged 25 and
over, and changed little in the other major demographic groups.  The number of employees and self-employed held steady
in May. Employment growth over the previous 12 months was
all among private sector employees (+1.7%).  Industry perspective  The number of people working in manufacturing increased
by 36,000 in May. Manufacturing employment has been on an
upward trend since November 2011.  Employment in educational services increased by 26,000
in May. Compared with 12 months earlier, employment in this
industry was up 5.6% (+68,000).  Following a downward trend that started in summer 2011,
employment in retail and wholesale trade rose by 24,000 in May.
Despite this increase, employment in this industry was 1.5%
(-41,000) below its level of 12 months earlier.  In May, employment also rose in agriculture, up by 11,000.
Following 10 months of little change, gains in April and May
brought
employment growth in this industry to 5.0% (+15,000) from 12
months
earlier.  Employment in information, culture and recreation fell by
27,000 in May, bringing employment in this industry back to its
level of 12 months earlier.  Employment in construction also declined by 27,000 in May,
offsetting a gain of similar magnitude in the previous month.
Compared with 12 months earlier, employment in this industry
was little changed.  Provincial summary  The number of people working in Alberta increased for the
second month in a row, up 9,800 in May. This increase pushed the
 unemployment rate  down 0.4 percentage points to 4.5%, the lowest
since December 2008. Over the previous 12 months, employment in
the province rose 4.1%--the fastest growth of all provinces and
exceeding the national average of 1.2%.  Employment in New Brunswick rose for the second consecutive
month, up 5,300 in May, and the unemployment rate edged down to
9.4%.  Employment in  Quebec  edged up in May, following two
consecutive
months of notable gains, and the unemployment rate was 7.8%.
The number of employed in the province was little changed from
12 months earlier.  In Ontario, employment edged down in May, and the
unemployment
rate was unchanged at 7.8%. Compared with 12 months earlier,
employment in the province was little changed.  Following notable gains in April, employment in British
Columbia
was unchanged in May. The unemployment rate rose 1.2 percentage
points to 7.4%, as there was a marked increased in the number of
job-seekers, particularly among youths. Over the 12 previous
months,
employment in the province grew by 1.9%, above the national
average.  Employment up among men aged 25 and over  For the fourth month in a row, employment rose among men
aged
25 and over, up 19,000 in May. Compared with 12 months earlier,
the
number of employed for this group was up 1.6% (+129,000).  Among women aged 25 and over, employment was unchanged in
May.
Over the 12 previous months, employment for this group rose 1.7%
(+121,000).  Employment edged down among youths aged 15 to 24, and their
unemployment rate was 14.3%. Youth employment is roughly at the
same level as in July 2009, when the labour market downturn hit
a low.  Student summer employment  From May to August, the Labour Force Survey collects labour
market data about young people aged 15 to 24 who were attending
school full time in March and who intend to return to school
full
time in the fall. The May survey results provide the first
indicators
of the summer job market, especially for students aged 20 to 24,
as
most students aged 15 to 19 are not yet out of school for the
summer.
The data for June, July and August will provide further insight
into
the summer job market. The published data are not seasonally
adjusted,
and therefore comparisons can only be made from one year to
another.  The rate of employment among students aged 20 to 24--that
is,
the number of employed as a percentage of their population--was
58.9% in May 2012. This is lower than the rate of 60.8% observed
in May 2011, as the increase in the student population outpaced
that of student employment.  The May 2012 employment rate of 58.9% was higher than the
56.3%
rate in May 2009, when student employment was hit hard by the
labour
market downturn.  The unemployment rate for students aged 20 to 24 was 14.9%
in
May, similar to the rate in May 2011, but well below the 18.2%
rate
in May 2009.  Note to readers  The Labour Force Survey (LFS) estimates are based on a
sample,
and are therefore subject to sampling variability. Estimates for
smaller geographic areas or industries will have more
variability.
For an explanation of sampling variability of estimates and how
to
use standard errors to assess this variability, consult the
“Data quality” section of the publication Labour Force
Information
(71-001-X, free).  Unless otherwise stated, this release presents seasonally
adjusted
data, which facilitates comparisons by removing the effects of
seasonal
variations. For more information on seasonal adjustment, see
Seasonal
adjustment and identifying economic trends  New LFS tables have been added to CANSIM--tables 282-0200
to
282-0219. They include estimates of weekly and hourly wage
distributions by industry and occupation. Also available are
labour
force estimates by highest educational degree, family type and
family
age composition, as well as estimates on hours lost, activity
prior
to unemployment, reason for leaving last job and reason for not
looking for work.  Definitions, data sources and methods:
survey number 3701.  A more detailed summary, Labour Force Information
(71-001-X, free), is now available online for the week ending
May 19. From the Key resource module of our website under
