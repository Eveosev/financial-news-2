French soft wheat rated “good” or
“excellent” rose in the seven days ended June 4, climbing for
an eighth week, while conditions deteriorated for the durum
variety of the grain, crop office FranceAgriMer said.  Soft wheat with the top ratings advanced to 72 percent from
70 percent a week earlier, the Montreuil-sous-Bois, France-based
office reported on its  website  today. A year ago, 24 percent was
rated “good” or “excellent” as spring drought hurt yields.  Rain since March 1 has been above normal for most of
 France , boosting soil-water reserves across the country, the
 Agriculture Ministry  said this week. France grew 5.2 percent of
the world’s wheat in the 2011-12 crop year, International Grains
Council data show.  The ratings are the average for eight regions representing
54 percent of France’s soft-wheat area, the crop office wrote.  Durum  wheat rated “good” or “excellent” fell to 58
percent from 60 percent, based on three regions making up 58
percent of French production, the data show.  Winter  barley  with the top ratings remained stable at 65
percent, while spring barley rated in the top two categories
remained at 83 percent, FranceAgriMer wrote.  Corn  conditions
improved, with 70 percent of the crop rated “good” or
“excellent” from 69 percent a week earlier.  To contact the reporter on this story:
