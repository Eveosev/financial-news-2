U.S. President  Barack Obama ’s
administration has been trying to force Germany to assume
responsibility for financially weak governments and banks in the
euro region, giving advice that’s unwise and reflecting a lack
of knowledge about the sources of the crisis,  Glenn Hubbard , an
economic adviser for Republican presidential candidate  Mitt Romney , said in the  Handelsblatt  newspaper.  Obama’s advice to Germany and Europe to focus on short-term
economic stimulus to achieve longer-term growth goals is as
flawed as his own economic policy, Hubbard, dean of Columbia
University’s Graduate School of Business, said in an opinion
piece in the newspaper.  Europe’s debt crisis is a crisis of confidence, Hubbard
said. Confidence in sound public finances over the long term is
a prerequisite for economic growth and creates scope for short-
term emergency programs, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
