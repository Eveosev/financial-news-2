Canadian natural gas fell for a
second day to the lowest price in more than a month after U.S.
storage levels increased more than expected last week.  July gas in  Alberta  declined 1.3 percent.  U.S. stockpiles 
expanded by 62 billion cubic feet to 2.877 trillion, the Energy
Department reported yesterday.  Analyst estimates  compiled by
Bloomberg estimated the rise at 58 billion and a survey of
Bloomberg users predicted 56 billion. The five-year average
stockpile gain for the week is 99 billion cubic feet.  “That storage number being above expectation proves that
while power generation is strong and industrial demand remains
near last year’s level, the supply side is also strong and
that’s definitely weighing on the market,” Eric Bickel, an
analyst at Summit Energy Services in Louisville,  Kentucky , said
in a telephone interview.  Alberta gas for July delivery declined 2.25 cents to
C$1.6925 a gigajoule ($1.56 per million British thermal units),
the lowest level since April 30, as of 3 p.m. New York time. Gas
traded on the exchange is shipped to users in  Canada  and the
U.S. and priced on  TransCanada Corp. (TRP) ’s Alberta system. NGX gas
is down 35 percent this year.  Natural gas for July delivery on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange  rose 2.5 cents to settle at $2.299 per million Btu.  Spot Prices  Spot gas at the Alliance delivery point near Chicago
dropped 13.76 cents, or 5.8 percent, to $2.2312 per million Btu
on the  Intercontinental Exchange . Alliance is an express line
that can carry 1.5 billion cubic feet a day from western Canada.  At the Kingsgate point on the border of  Idaho  and British
Columbia, gas declined 11.63 cents, or 5.6 percent, to $1.9452
per million Btu. At Malin,  Oregon , where Canadian gas is traded
for California markets, prices fell 12.54 cents, or 5.8 percent,
to $2.0476.  Volume on TransCanada’s  Alberta system , which collects the
output of most of the nation’s gas wells, was 16.4 billion cubic
feet at 3 p.m.  New York  time.  Gas was flowing at a daily rate of 2.11 billion cubic feet
at Empress, Alberta, where the fuel is transferred to
TransCanada’s main line.  At McNeil, Saskatchewan, where gas is transferred to the
Northern Border Pipeline for shipment to the Chicago area, the
daily flow rate was 1.89 billion cubic feet.  Available capacity on TransCanada’s British Columbia system
at  Kingsgate  was 24 million cubic feet. The system was forecast
to carry 1.96 billion cubic feet today, or 99 percent of its
normal capacity of 1.98 billion.  The volume on  Spectra Energy ’s British Columbia system,
which gathers the fuel in northeastern British Columbia for
delivery to Vancouver and the Pacific Northwest, totaled 2.82
billion cubic feet at 1:50 p.m.  To contact the reporter on this story:
