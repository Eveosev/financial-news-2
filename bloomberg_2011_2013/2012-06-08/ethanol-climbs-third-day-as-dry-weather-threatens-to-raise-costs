Ethanol futures climbed for a third
day in  Chicago , the longest streak of gains in three weeks, as
dry, warm weather in the U.S. Midwest threatened to raise
production costs.  Prices advanced on speculation that dry weather in the
corn-abundant region will cut crop yields and make it more
expensive for a distiller to convert the grain into ethanol.  “It’s still the corn market,” said Mike Blackford, a
consultant with INTL FCStone in  Des Moines ,  Iowa . Ethanol
“continues to reluctantly follow corn higher.”  Denatured ethanol for July delivery rose 0.4 cents to
settle at $2.077 a gallon on the Chicago Board of Trade, the
highest level since May 25. Prices have fallen 5.7 percent this
year.  In spot market trading, ethanol was unchanged in  New York 
at $2.10 a gallon, in Chicago at $2.03 and in the U.S. Gulf at
$2.095, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Ethanol on the
West Coast dropped 2 cents, or 0.9 percent, to $2.19 a gallon.  Corn for July delivery rose 4 cents, or 0.7 percent, to
$5.98 a bushel in Chicago.  To contact the reporter on this story:
