Austria’s economy expanded in the
first quarter after the Alpine republic’s manufacturers lifted
exports and people consumed more goods and services, the
government-backed Wifo economic research institute said.  First-quarter gross domestic product, the value of goods
and services, rose 0.3 percent from the preceding three months,
Wifo said today in an e-mailed statement. That compares to an
initial estimate of 0.2 percent growth, published on May 15.  “The results of Wifo’s latest economic data and the slight
flattening of the global economy also suggest a certain slow-
down of domestic economic activity in the next quarters,” Wifo
said in the statement.  Wifo also revised its estimate for the fourth quarter of
last year to a contraction of 0.1 percent. It previously had
said there was zero growth.  Austria’s economy grew 2 percent on a year-on-year basis,
up from an initial estimate of 1.9 percent, according to Wifo.  To contact the reporter on this story:
