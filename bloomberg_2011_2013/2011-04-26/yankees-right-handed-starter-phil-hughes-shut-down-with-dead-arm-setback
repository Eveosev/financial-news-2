New York Yankees pitcher  Phil Hughes  had a setback in his recovery from a shoulder injury,
saying his arm felt “dead” after a throwing session.  Hughes, who won 18 games for the Yankees last season, has
been on the 15-day disabled list since April 15 with
inflammation in his right shoulder. He’ll be re-evaluated and
won’t continue to throw, the Yankees said.  “Every step we had taken had been positive up to this
point,” Yankees manager  Joe Girardi  said before last night’s 2-
0 loss to the  Chicago White Sox . “This is a setback.”  Hughes, who has lost an average of 4 mph of velocity on his
fastball this season, threw a bullpen session on April 23 in
Baltimore. He threw again yesterday in  New York  and stopped
after about 10 to 12 pitches.  “It’s just the same as before,” Hughes said, according to
the Yankees’ website. “It’s just dead.”  Hughes, 24, had a 13.94 earned run average in his three
Major League Baseball starts this season before going on the
disabled list, allowing 16 runs and 19 hits in 10 1/3 innings.  To contact the reporter on this story:
