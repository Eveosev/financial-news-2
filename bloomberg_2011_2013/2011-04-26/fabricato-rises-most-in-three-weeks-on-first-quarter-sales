Textiles Fabricato Tejicondor SA (FABRI) ,
 Colombia ’s biggest textile maker, rose the most in three weeks
after first-quarter sales increased 24 percent.  Fabricato gained 0.2 percent to 43.5 pesos in Bogota
trading at 4 p.m. New York time. Earlier, the shares advanced as
much as 3.7 percent, the most intraday since April 6.  The company’s first-quarter sales totaled 150.7 billion
pesos ($84.3 million), up from 121.4 billion pesos a year ago.

pesos, according to results released yesterday in a regulatory
filing.  Fabricato “continued presenting improvements” in the
first quarter “through the strengthening of exports and an
appropriate cost management,” according to a report today from
brokerage Interbolsa SA.  To contact the reporter on this story:
