China ’s government must open its
financial sector to more competition in order to reduce risks to
Chinese lenders and improve the allocation of resources, the
American Chamber of Commerce in China said in a report.  “China has a system in which foreign banks continue to
play an insignificant role,” the Beijing-based chamber said in
a report released today. “Robust participation by foreign
players in all of China’s financial markets would, over
time, reduce the risk burden now fully carried by Chinese
institutions.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
