The Public Investment Corp.
indicated  Avusa Ltd. (AVU)  is worth more than the 26 rand a share
offer from Capitau Holdings Ltd. and RMB Venturexs, Business Day
said, citing  Africa ’s biggest fund manager.  The PIC is still waiting for more information on the bid
and won’t support a delisting of Avusa’s stock without a
compelling reason, the Johannesburg-based newspaper said, citing
a statement from the money manager in response to questions.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
