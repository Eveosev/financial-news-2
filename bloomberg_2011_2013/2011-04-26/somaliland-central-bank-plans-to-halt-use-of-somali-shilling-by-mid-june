Somaliland ’s central bank will
begin exchanging 7 billion Somali shillings ($4.37 million) of
notes for its own currency next month as part of a plan to stop
using the Somali currency in the autonomous region by mid-June.  “We are preparing for the Somaliland shilling to be used
all over Somaliland,” Central Bank of Somaliland Governor Abdi Dirir Abdi said in an interview on April 24 in Hargeisa, the
capital. Abdi said the rate at which the currency will be
exchanged has yet to be determined.  Somaliland, a former British colony, declared independence
in 1991, following the ouster of former Somali dictator Mohammed Siad Barre. No sovereign state has formally recognized the
region as independent.  The Somaliland shilling was introduced in October 1994,
according to the  government’s website . At the end of 2008, the
currency was valued at 7,500 per dollar, it said. The Somali
shilling is currently valued at 1,601 against the U.S. currency
according to Bloomberg data.  The central bank of Somaliland expects lawmakers to enact a
draft banking law by June enabling commercial lenders to extend
credit to borrowers for the first time, Abdi said last month.
Somaliland is in talks with Banque pour le Commerce et
l’Industrie, based in neighboring  Djibouti , and two other
lenders to grant them banking licenses, Abdi said. The nation of
3.5 million people currently has no banks.  To contact the reporter on this story:
