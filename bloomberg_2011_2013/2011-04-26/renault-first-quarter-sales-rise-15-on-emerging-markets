Renault SA (RNO) ,  France ’s second-biggest
carmaker, said first-quarter revenue rose 15 percent on buoyant
demand for its no-frills models in Russia and emerging markets.  Revenue increased to 10.43 billion euros ($15.27 billion)
in the first three months from 9.07 billion euros a year
earlier, the company said in an e-mailed statement today. That
compares with the 9.5 billion-euro median of six analyst
estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  Sales were “lifted by stronger markets and our good
international sales performance,” Chief Executive Officer
 Carlos Ghosn  said in the statement. He reiterated the company’s
500 million-euro cash flow target for 2011.  Renault, whose Chief Operating Officer Patrick Pelata is
stepping down over a botched industrial espionage investigation,
is counting on emerging-market demand for its budget models to
sell 3 million vehicles with a 5 percent profit margin in 2013,
compared with 2.63 million deliveries and a 2.8 percent margin
achieved last year.  The sales growth was led by an 88 percent gain in the so-
called Eurasia region including  Russia  and other former Soviet
states.  Renault said its main automotive division recorded a 15
percent sales increase to 9.97 billion euros, while the sales-
financing unit posted an 8.4 percent gain to 466 million euros.  PSA Peugeot Citroen, Renault’s larger domestic rival, on
April 20 posted a 10 percent sales gain to 15.4 billion euros
for the quarter.  To contact the reporter on this story:
