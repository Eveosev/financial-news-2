Toyota Motor Corp. (7203) , the world’s
largest automaker, is recalling about 51,000 model year 2011
Tundra pickup trucks, citing a drive shaft part that may break.  The rear drive shaft in an estimated 0.05 percent of the
vehicles may include a component called a slip yoke that could
break due to improper casting during the foundry process, the
Toyota City, Japan-based company said in a statement today.  Toyota said it’s aware of one slip-yoke failure and that no
accidents or injuries have been reported.  The carmaker will notify owners of the affected vehicles by
mail beginning next month. Dealers will need about 10 minutes to
inspect the drive shaft, Toyota said.  Toyota last year faced congressional and regulatory
inquiries in the U.S. for its handling of recalls, including of
Tundras. The automaker last year recalled model years 2000
through 2003 of the trucks for frame corrosion that could damage
brake lines and dislodge spare tires.  Toyota’s American depositary receipts, each equal to two
ordinary shares, fell 95 cents, or 1.2 percent, to $78.56 at
1:24 p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading.  To contact the reporter on this story:
