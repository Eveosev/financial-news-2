German Agriculture MinisterIlse Aigner said the country could raise the area of land it grows
crops on for use in energy generation to about 3 million
hectares (7.4 million acres) by 2020 from 1.8 million hectares
currently, Passauer Neue Presse reported.  That could generate an annual 45 terawatt-hours of
electricity, the German newspaper cited Aigner as saying in an
interview.  Food production  must be given priority over the
growing of plants to be used in the  energy industry , the
politician said, according to the newspaper.  Click here for web link  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
