Egypt ’s public prosecutor extended
the detentions of Alaa and  Gamal Mubarak , the sons of former
President  Hosni Mubarak , for 15 days, the state-run Middle East
News Agency said, citing the prosecutor.  Preparations are also under way to transfer Hosni Mubarak,
who is hospitalized in the Red Sea resort of Sharm El Sheikh, to
a military hospital “as soon as his health condition
stabilizes,” Interior Minister Mansour El-Essawy said in a
letter to the public prosecutor. Mubarak is suffering from a
heart condition that can lead to cardiac arrest and requires
intensive care, according to the statement from the prosecutor’s
office sent to the press today.  Mubarak and his sons were first ordered detained for 15
days as part of a corruption probe on April 13. Two days later,
the public prosecutor ordered Mubarak to be transferred to a
military hospital. Mubarak’s detention was extended for another
15 days on April 22. The three men were summoned for questioning
about alleged embezzlement of public funds and attacks on
protesters during the uprising that ended Mubarak’s three-decade
rule, the prosecutor said on April 10.  To contact the reporter on this story:
