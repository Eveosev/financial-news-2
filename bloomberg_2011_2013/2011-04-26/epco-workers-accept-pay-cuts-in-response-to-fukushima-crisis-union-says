Tokyo  Electric Power Co. workers
agreed to a management proposal to cut their pay by as much as
25 percent out of a sense of responsibility for the world’s
worst nuclear disaster since Chernobyl, their union said.  “Most union members didn’t object to a pay cut,
considering the situation at the company and the effect on
society from the nuclear accident,” Koji Sakata, secretary-
general of the Tokyo Electric Power Workers Union, said by
telephone today.  The utility known as Tepco is battling radiation leaks at
the Fukushima Dai-Ichi power plant north of Tokyo after a March
11 earthquake and tsunami knocked out its cooling systems,
causing the biggest atomic accident in 25 years. More than
50,000 households were forced to evacuate and Bank of America
Corp.’s Merrill Lynch estimates Tepco may face compensation
claims of as much as 11 trillion yen ($135 billion).  “Tepco is facing a situation that no other Japanese
company has before,” said Keiichiro Hamaguchi, research
director at the  Japan  Institute for Labor Policy and Training.
“In tough financial situations, Japanese companies hold labor-
management talks on wages. Companies normally prioritize
protecting jobs.”  Tepco shares fell 2.7 percent to 426 yen today in Tokyo.
The shares are down 80 percent since the quake and tsunami
struck, leaving about 26,000 people dead or missing.  Salary Cuts  Board members including Chairman  Tsunehisa Katsumata  and
President Masataka Shimizu will take a salary cut of 50 percent,
the company said in a statement yesterday.  Tepco, Japan’s largest power company, expects to save about
54 billion yen a year from the reductions, according to the
statement.  Managers will have their salaries reduced by 25 percent and
workers by 20 percent. Tepco won’t hire new graduates in the
next financial year, according to the statement.  Executives will have their pay cut from this month, Tepco
spokeswoman Ai Tanaka said by telephone today. Salaries of
general employees and managers will be cut from July and bonuses
from June, Tanaka said.  Katsumata and Shimizu have said they will resign at an
appropriate time. Shimizu told lawmakers again today no decision
has been made on a resignation date. He was speaking at a lower
house session where Prime Minister  Naoto Kan  said it’s time to
consider setting up a committee to investigate the Fukushima
crisis.  Government Criticism  Tepco was again criticized by the government for acting too
slowly in the early days of the crisis.  “The corporate culture of the company made it difficult
for them to make bold decisions,” Goshi Hosono, an advisor to
Kan, said yesterday, referring to hesitation by Tepco over
flooding reactors with seawater and venting steam to relieve
pressure on overheating cores.  Hosono was speaking at the first joint press conference
held by Tepco and the  Nuclear and Industrial Safety Agency .
About 250 journalists attended the briefing, which lasted almost
four hours. Hosono answered most of the questions.  Farmers protested outside Tepco headquarters today,
demanding compensation for losses and an early return to their
land. They parked two trucks carrying cows outside the company’s
offices in central Tokyo and carried boxes of vegetables
included cabbage and spinach.  About 300 farmers from Fukushima and other prefectures
attended the protest and sent a delegation into the offices to
meet Tepco officials.  Compensation Claims  The company said on April 20 it will start compensating
residents evacuated from areas around its crippled nuclear power
station. The government has said it will support Tepco’s aid
efforts.  The utility will begin distributing claim forms and
payments will be made as soon as possible, spokesman Tetsuya
Terasawa said at a briefing in Tokyo. Initial compensation
totaling about 50 billion yen was promised by Tepco last week.  Twenty-five years ago today the No. 4 reactor of Chernobyl
exploded, sending a radiation plume across  Europe  from what is
now Ukraine. The meltdown killed at least 31 plant workers and
firefighters in three months and forced the evacuation of a
quarter of a million people in what was then the  Soviet Union .  Ukraine last week failed to raise the $1 billion needed to
seal Chernobyl’s reactor with more permanent methods, as budget
concerns and the accident at Fukushima caused some governments
to balk at further spending.  Fukushima “has created fear of radiation exposure and
radioactive contamination not just in Japan, but throughout the
world,” the Tokyo-based  Citizens’ Nuclear Information Center 
said in an e-mailed statement to mark the Chernobyl anniversary.
“We refuse to allow the earth to be further subjected to
radioactive contamination and  radiation exposure .”  To contact the reporters on this story: Tsuyoshi Inajima in
