India ’s rupee fell for a third day,
the longest losing streak since January, on speculation rising
global commodity prices will boost the nation’s import costs.  The currency touched a one-week low as the UBS Bloomberg
Constant Maturity Commodity Index of 26 raw materials headed for
a fifth monthly advance. The Bombay Stock Exchange’s Sensitive
Index declined for a second day, fueling concern overseas
investors are reducing holdings of the nation’s shares.  “Dollar demand from commodity importers is getting
stronger as we approach the end of the month,” said Sudarshan Bhatt, chief currency trader at  Corporation Bank  in Mumbai.
“The correction in stocks is a negative too.”  The rupee dropped 0.1 percent to 44.5225 per dollar as of
the 5 p.m. close in Mumbai, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. That pared the currency’s gains this month to 0.2
percent, the second-worst performance among the 10 most-traded
Asian currencies.  Offshore forwards indicate the rupee will trade at 45.27 to
the dollar in three months, compared with expectations of 45.26
yesterday. Forwards are agreements to buy or sell assets at a
set price and date. Non-deliverable contracts are settled in
dollars.  To contact the reporters on this story:
