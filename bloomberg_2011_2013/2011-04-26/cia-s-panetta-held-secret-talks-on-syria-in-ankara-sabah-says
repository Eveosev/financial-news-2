U.S. Central Intelligence Agency
chief Leon Panetta spent five days in the Turkish capital at the
end of March discussing regional tensions as  Syria  became the
latest Mideast country to erupt in protests,  Sabah  newspaper
reported.  The visit to meet Turkish officials including intelligence
chief Hakan Fidan, who according to Sabah was sent to Syria to
meet Syrian President Bashar al-Assad by Prime Minister  Recep Tayyip Erdogan  last month, was not announced to the public.
Deborah Guido, spokeswoman for the U.S. Embassy in Ankara, said
she could not confirm it.  Panneta’s talks included planning for possible regime
change in Syria and ensuring the safety of the Assad family,
Sabah wrote without saying how it got the information.  The talks also touched on the fighting in Libya, Turkish-
Israeli relations, intelligence-sharing in Iraq, cooperation in
 Afghanistan  and the fight against the Kurdistan Workers’ Party
or PKK, Sabah said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
