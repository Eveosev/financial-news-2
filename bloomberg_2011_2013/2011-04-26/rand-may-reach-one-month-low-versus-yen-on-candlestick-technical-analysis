The rand may decline to a four-week
low against the yen as a candlestick chart shows  South Africa ’s
currency is under downward pressure, Gaitame.com Research
Institute Ltd. said, citing trading patterns.  The rand is poised to extend this year’s 0.9 percent loss
versus the yen as the currency’s candlestick chart remains below
its 20-day moving average, said Takuya Kawabata, a researcher at
the unit of  Japan ’s largest foreign-exchange margin company.  “Pressure on the rand is relatively downward,” Tokyo-
based Kawabata said in an interview. “The 12-day moving average
is heading downward and the rand’s candlestick is below its 20-
day moving average.”  The rand traded at 12.1325 yen as of 10:33 a.m. in  Tokyo 
after declining from an 11-month high of 12.8565 yen on April 8.
The 12-day moving average was at 12.2360 yen, and the 20-day
average was at 12.3616 yen.  South Africa’s currency may fall to 11.92 yen, the weakest
level since March 29, Kawabata said. Declines may be limited by
the 200-day moving average currently at 11.8877, which will
serve as a level of support, he said.  Candlestick charts track the distance between a currency’s
opening and closing prices over a given period and appear white
when the closing rate is stronger than the opener, and black
when the price has strengthened during the period. Support
refers to an area where buy orders may be clustered.  In  technical analysis , investors and analysts study charts
of trading patterns and prices to forecast changes in a security,
commodity, currency or index.  To contact the reporters on this story:
