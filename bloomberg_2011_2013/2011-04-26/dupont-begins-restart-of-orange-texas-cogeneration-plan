DuPont Co. is restarting a
cogeneration plant and ethylene unit after a possible lightning
strike caused a steam loss at the Sabine River Works chemical
complex in Orange,  Texas , said Aaron Woods, a company spokesman.  “They are in the process of getting the cogen plant
restarted,” Woods, based in Houston, said in a telephone
interview. The ethylene plant had to be shut because of the loss
of steam from the cogeneration plant, he said. There was no
damage to the steam cracker.  Emissions associated with the startup began today at noon
local time and were expected to end May 6, the Wilmington,
Delaware-based company said in a  filing  with the Texas
Commission on Environmental Quality.  The facility, called a cracker, splits oil products like
naphtha and liquefied petroleum gases through pressure and heat.
Outages can increase prices for ethylene and propylene as
companies turn to spot markets to help them meet supply
contracts.  The Sabine complex is about 110 miles (177 kilometers) east
of Houston.  To contact the reporter on this story:
