MountainView Capital Holdings LLC
said it’s managing an auction of servicing rights for $262
million of Fannie Mae mortgages for a seller that it didn’t

About 88 percent of the loans are for California homes, and the
fixed-rate mortgages carry an average interest rate of 4.79
percent and average balance of $279,108, the firm said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
