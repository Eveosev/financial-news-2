Eveready East Africa Ltd. (EVRD) , a Kenyan
dry-cell battery maker, fell to its lowest on record as
investors speculated its earnings would continue to be hurt by
counterfeit products.  The stock dropped as much as 20 cents, or 9.1 percent, to
2.15 shillings, the lowest since at least February 2007, when
Bloomberg began tracking the company’s shares. It closed down
2.3 percent at 2.15 shillings as of 3 p.m. in Nairobi, bringing
its decline this year to 28 percent.  “The outlook for the company is weak,” Eva Njuguna, an
equities dealer with Nairobi-based Sterling Investment Bank,
said by phone today. “The company has blamed counterfeits on
its reduced earnings, and nothing has been done to counter those
cheap imports.”  Eveready said on March 30 that profit in the 12 months
through September plunged 70 percent to 8.7 million shillings
($104,000) because of “illegal” competition, higher zinc
prices and a weaker shilling.  To contact the reporter on this story:
