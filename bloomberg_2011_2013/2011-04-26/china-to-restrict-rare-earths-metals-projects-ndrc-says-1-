China  has listed all new rare
earths, minor metal and some base metal smelting projects as
restricted, reiterating its plan to curb capacity and protect
the environment.  Expansion of existing smelting and exploration operations
has also been restricted, and include molybdenum, antimony and
tin, the National Development and Reform Commission said in a
statement today, without elaborating. Aluminum smelting was
listed as restricted as well as processors of less than 100,000
metric tons per year of crude copper and zinc.  China has been curbing domestic output growth and exports
of rare earths and minor metals to conserve resources and
protect the environment, tightening global supplies. The
government said this month it will immediately suspend approval
of new aluminum projects as the world’s biggest producer and
consumer of the metal faces overcapacity.  The government last month extended a ban on exploring for
rare earths, tungsten and antimony and opening new mines, while
raising production limits for existing projects. Rare earths --
17 chemically similar metals -- are used in hybrid cars and wind
turbines, and tungsten is used to toughen steel for  machine
tools  and antimony is used in batteries.  There are 23 aluminum projects with a total capacity of
7.74 million tons being planned now, and if they are all built
and put into use, capacity will be more than 30 million tons by
the end of 2015, the Ministry of Industry and  Information
Technology  said April 20. This would be a “huge waste” of
resources and capital, it said  To contact the reporter on this story:
