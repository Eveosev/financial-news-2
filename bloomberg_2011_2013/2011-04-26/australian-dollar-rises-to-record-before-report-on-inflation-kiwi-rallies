Australia’s dollar rallied to a
record before a government report forecast to show a jump in the
nation’s consumer prices.  New Zealand’s dollar rose to a three-year high versus the
U.S. currency as global stocks rallied, boosting demand for
assets related to economic growth.  “Inflation numbers are very important in Australia,
considering the constant lip service the  Reserve Bank  of
Australia pays to it in terms of trade,” said  Jessica Hoversen ,
an analyst at MF Global Holdings Ltd. in  New York .  The Aussie gained 0.5 percent to $1.0779 at 1:39 p.m. in
New York, from $1.0722 yesterday, after touching $1.0792, the
highest level since the currency began trading freely in 1983.
New Zealand’s dollar rose 0.7 percent to 80.51 U.S. cents, from
79.93, after touching 80.57, the highest since March 2008.  Consumer prices in Australia rose 1.2 percent in the first
quarter after a 0.4 percent increase in the last three months of
2010, boosting speculation the nation’s central bank will resume
interest-rate increases. The Australian Bureau of Statistics
inflation report is due at 9:30 p.m. New York time.  The  MSCI World (MXWO)  Index of equities added 0.7 percent, and the
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index gained 0.9 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
