Taiwan ’s dollar closed little
changed, after falling as much as 0.2 percent earlier, as
political violence in the Middle East spurred investors to favor
the relative safety of the greenback.  The Bloomberg-JPMorgan Asia Dollar Index, which tracks the
region’s 10 most-traded currencies excluding the yen, was headed
for its lowest close in a week after Syrian security forces
stormed the city of Daraa yesterday and killed at least 20
people in a bid to crush anti-government protests. Uprisings
have toppled leaders in Tunisia and Egypt this year and led to a
prolonged military conflict in Libya.  “We have risk-off sentiment today,” said  Frances Cheung ,
a senior strategist at Credit Agricole CIB in  Hong Kong . “But
overall the market is quiet because of the holidays. Volumes are
light.”  Taiwan’s dollar traded at NT$28.939 against its U.S.
counterpart as of the 4 p.m. local time close, compared with
NT$28.930 yesterday, according to Taipei Forex Inc. The currency
touched NT$28.860 on April 22, the strongest level since Feb. 10.  Government bonds  advanced after the government sold NT$40
billion ($1.4 billion) of five-year notes at a yield of 1.075
percent today.  The yield on the 1 percent bond due January 2016, the most-
active government security, fell one basis point to 1.073
percent, according to Gretai Securities Market.  To contact the reporter on this story:
