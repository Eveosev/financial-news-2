Citigroup Inc. (C) , the third-largest
U.S. lender, plans to hire about 500 people globally, including
bankers and traders, to bolster its institutional clients unit.  The additions are “part of a multi-year effort, across all
businesses and geographies” within the division, spokeswoman
Danielle Romero-Apsilos said today in an e-mail. The
institutional clients unit includes  investment banking , trading,
transaction processing and the firm’s private bank, which
manages money for affluent customers.  Citigroup aims to rank among the top three firms in most
product areas, the Financial Times cited Chief Operating Officer
John Havens as saying in an interview, in an article published
earlier today. Romero-Apsilos confirmed the quote, and declined
to comment further.  To contact the reporter on this story:
