GMR Infrastructure Ltd. (GMRI)  and  GVK
Power & Infrastructure Ltd. (GVKP) , operators of two of  India ’s busiest
airports, fell on report that the highest court ordered private
developers to stop levying fees on passengers.  GMR shares fell as much as 4.7 percent to 37.9 rupees, and
traded at 38.2 rupees as of 12:21 p.m. in Mumbai, bound for the
lowest close in almost a month. GVK lost 3.4 percent to 25.35
rupees, set for the lowest closing price since March 24.  India’s  Supreme Court  quashed levying of the so-called
airport development fee, the Press Trust of India reported,
without saying where it got the information. A. Issac George,
chief financial officer of GVK, couldn’t immediately be reached
on his mobile phone. GMR, which runs the New Delhi airport, said
in an e-email that it will respond after receiving a copy of the
court order.  “The stocks are reacting on concern that fees collected
till date need to be refunded,” Vijaykumar Bupathy, an analyst
at Spark Capital Advisors Pvt., said by telephone from Chennai.
“The question is whether the order has quashed the initial fee
that the developers had sought in 2009, or the additional amount
GMR sought in August 2010.”  GMR sought to collect as much as 34.8 billion rupees ($781
million) in fees from passengers at the New Delhi airport over
three years from 2009, Bupathy said. GVK sought about 21 billion
rupees from passengers at the  Mumbai  airport, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
