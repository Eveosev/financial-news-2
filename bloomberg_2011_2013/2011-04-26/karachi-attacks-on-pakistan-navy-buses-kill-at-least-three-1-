Two near simultaneous blasts hit
buses carrying personnel of  Pakistan ’s navy in the financial
capital Karachi, killing at least four people and injuring 56, a
navy spokesman said.  The explosions in the city’s Baldia Town and Defense areas
were detonated remotely, the spokesman, Irfan-ul-Haq, said in a
phone interview. A motorbike was used in one of the strikes, Geo
television reported, without saying where it got the information.  Pakistan’s Taliban movement and allied militant groups have
conducted scores of bombings and gun attacks on police, army and
intelligence facilities since 2007, when the army battled armed
militants in the Lal Masjid, or Red Mosque, in Islamabad.  Militant strikes intensified after the army launched
offensives against Taliban strongholds in the northwest of the
country in 2009. Last month, the Taliban claimed responsibility
for an attack that killed at least 25 people and damaged an
office of Pakistan’s main intelligence agency in Faisalabad, the
country’s third-largest city.  To contact the reporters on this story:
