ProLogis (PLD) , the worldâ€™s largest
warehouse owner, received a 500 million-euro ($732 million) loan
from  JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM)  to buy  ProLogis European Properties. (PEPR)   The senior, unsecured term loan may be used only to pay for
units of ProLogis European, Denver-based ProLogis said today in
a regulatory filing. ProLogis made an offer earlier this month
that valued ProLogis European at 1.2 billion euros, beating a
bid by APG Algemene Pensioen Groep NV and Goodman Group.  ProLogis started the mandatory 6.10 per-unit offer for
ProLogis European on April 22.  To contact the reporter on this story:
