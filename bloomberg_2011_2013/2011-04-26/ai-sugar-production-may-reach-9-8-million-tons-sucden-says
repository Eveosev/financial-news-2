Sugar production in  Thailand  may
reach as much as 9.8 million metric tons as the country is set
to crush at least 95 million tons of cane, according to Sucden,
the trading arm of Sucres et Denrees SA.  “They have already crushed 89 million tons and most of the
mills are still running,” Pierre-Henri Dietz, an analyst at the
company, said in an e-mail today. “They are able to crush
400,000 tons per day, so 95 million tons is more than
achievable.”  Thailand produced 6.93 million tons the previous season,
according to data from the country’s Office of the Cane & Sugar
Board. The office estimated on April 20 that production would
rise to an all time-high of 9.11 million tons. The country’s so-
called crush of its harvest is usually over by April.  Thailand’s output, combined with tight supplies from
 Brazil , the largest producer, may result in sweetener from the
Southeast Asian country being delivered when the May raw-sugar
contract on ICE Futures U.S. expires April 29, Swiss Sugar
Brokers said in a report e-mailed yesterday.  White, or refined, sugar for August delivery fell $5, or
0.8 percent, to $634.10 a ton by 12:54 p.m. local time on NYSE
Liffe in  London . Raw sugar for July delivery slid 0.13 cent, or
0.6 percent, to 23.27 cents a pound on ICE Futures U.S. in  New
York .  To contact the reporter on this story:
