U.S. economic growth may have
slowed in the first quarter, meaning the  Federal Reserve  will
avoid tightening monetary policy and the dollar will be on the
“back foot,” UBS Investment Bank Chief Economist Larry Hatheway said.  The U.S. may have expanded at an annualized rate of as
little as 1 percent in the first quarter as higher  oil prices 
increased the trade deficit and inventory building slackened,
Hatheway told Bloomberg Television’s “The Pulse” in London
today. His forecast compares with the 1.9 percent annual pace
predicted by the median of 66 economists surveyed by Bloomberg
News before an April 28 Commerce Department report.  The slackening expansion will prompt the Fed to complete
its $600 billion asset-purchase program, known as “quantitative
easing,” in the coming month at the same time the  European
Central Bank  is raising  interest rates .  “The Fed is going to announce it’s going to see through QE
II until June; it’s going to adopt a wait-and-see policy,”
Hatheway said. “We’re going to have all options on the table
from the Fed, probably through the end of this summer.”  The interest-rate differential may keep the dollar from
gaining against other major currencies. The dollar fell against
the yen and dropped for a sixth day against the euro today.  “The dollar is on the back foot right now,” Hatheway
said. “The real concern would be if a weaker dollar pushes
commodity prices higher.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
