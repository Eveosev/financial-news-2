Cyber criminals are hacking bank
accounts of small-to-medium size businesses in the U.S. and
sending unauthorized wire transfers to Chinese economic and
trade companies, according to the FBI.  Between March 2010 and April 2011, authorities identified
20 incidents in which the transfers were initiated, according to
a Federal Bureau of Investigation statement today. Losses
totaled about $11 million and attempted thefts totaled about $20
million.  The computer of an employee who is authorized to transfer
funds is typically compromised by malware that captures
corporate online banking credentials, according to the
 statement . Unauthorized transfers typically were from $50,000 to
$985,000, with most above $900,000, according to the FBI.  Intended recipients of the unauthorized transfers are
companies registered in port cities near the China-Russia
border, according to the statement.  Authorities donâ€™t know who is responsible for the
transfers, whether the Chinese accounts were the final
destination or if the funds were forwarded elsewhere, according
to the FBI.  To contact the reporter on this story:
