Romania abandoned its target of
joining the euro-area by 2015,  Ziarul Financiar  reported today,
citing the countryâ€™s convergence program, which must be sent to
the European Commission this month by the government.  The Balkan nation joined the  European Union  in 2007 and the
government and central bank will now hold talks on setting a new
date for joining the single European currency, according to the
Bucharest-based newspaper.  To contact the reporter on this story:
