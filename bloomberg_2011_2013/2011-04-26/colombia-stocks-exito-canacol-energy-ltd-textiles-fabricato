The following companies are having
unusual price changes in Bogota trading. Stock symbols are in

Colcap Index added 0.2 percent to 1,692.44.  Almacenes Exito SA (EXITO)  , Colombia’s biggest publicly-
traded retailer, rose 1.8 percent to 27,700 pesos after Celfin
issued a report saying that first-quarter profit, scheduled to

company  that operates fields in South America, rose 5.4 percent

overdone, said Rupert Stebbings, an analyst at Celfin Colombia
SAS.  Textiles Fabricato Tejicondor SA (FABRI)  , Colombia’s
biggest textile maker, rose 2.1 percent to 44.3 pesos, headed
for its biggest gain in three weeks. The company reported
