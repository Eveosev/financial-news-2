Ukraine’s central bank will
“liberalize the  currency market ” to meet  International
Monetary Fund  demands and secure the next payment from a $15.6
billion bailout, Deputy Governor Yuriy Kolobov said.  The Natsionalnyi Bank Ukrainy plans to allow lenders to
enter into swaps contracts with a term of as long as one year to
protect against currency risks, Kolobov said. A resolution
allowing such arrangements between banks and with the central
bank will take effect in the “near future,” he said.  The central bank is “focused on working with the IMF” and
fulfilling its obligations, Kolobov told reporters today in
Kiev, the capital.  Ukraine in July secured a $15.6 billion loan from the IMF,
its second bailout in two years. The fund has released $3.4
billion in two tranches, helping the government cover its  budget
deficit  and boost foreign-currency reserves. The third
disbursement, initially planned for March, has been delayed as
the Cabinet and legislature iron out pension system changes.  The country needs to implement pension reform and come up
with measures to offset slower-than-agreed increases in natural
gas prices, Max Alier, the IMF representative in Kiev, said at
the news conference.  “We continue with dialogue and are waiting for measures to
be implemented,” Alier said. The government has asked for more
time to coordinate the pension changes with Parliament, he said,
adding that “progress is being made.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
