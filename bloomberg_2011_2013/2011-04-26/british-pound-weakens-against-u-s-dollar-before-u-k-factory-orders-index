The pound declined against the
dollar for a third day before a report forecast to show growth
in factory orders slowed in April.  The yield on U.K. 10-year government bonds fell to the
lowest in more than a month. The Confederation of British
Industryâ€™s orders gauge slipped to 2 from 5 a month before,
according to the median estimate of nine economists surveyed by
Bloomberg News.  The pound slipped 0.1 percent to $1.6476 as of 8:21 a.m. in
 London . Against the euro, sterling was little changed at 88.33
pence.  The 10-year gilt yield fell one basis point to 3.51
percent. The 3.75 percent security due September 2020 gained
0.1, or 1 pound per 1,000-pound face amount, to 101.865. Two-
year note yields were also one basis point lower, at 1.11
percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
