The Vietnamese dong strengthened
the most in 33 months on speculation demand for the local
currency increased after the central bank lowered lender’s
interest rates for dollar-denominated accounts.  “Companies and individuals have increased sales of dollars
after the central bank cut the interest rate for dollar deposits
to 3 percent from 5 percent,” said Hoang Moc Tung, a currency
trader at  Vietnam  Bank for Agriculture and  Rural Development .
“People prefer keeping their money in dong deposits with
interest rates at around 14 percent.”  The dong jumped 0.9 percent, the biggest one-day increase
since July 21, 2008, to 20,720 per dollar as of 4:30 p.m. in
Hanoi, according to prices from banks compiled by Bloomberg.  The central bank fixed the  reference rate  at 20,703 today,
compared with 20,708 yesterday, according to its website. The
currency is allowed to trade up to 1 percent on either side of
that rate.  The Ho Chi Minh City unit of  State Bank  of Vietnam has
asked the central bank to stop non-credit institutions from
receiving interest on dollar deposits, now set at 1 percent, to
help reduce dollar hoarding, according to online newswire
VnEconomy, citing Nguyen Hoang Minh, vice director of the unit.  Government bonds  gained, with the yield on the benchmark
five-year notes falling 16 basis points to 12.44 percent,
according to a daily fixing price from banks compiled by
Bloomberg. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  --Nguyen Dieu Tu Uyen. Editors: Andrew Janes, Simon Harvey  To contact the reporter on this story:
