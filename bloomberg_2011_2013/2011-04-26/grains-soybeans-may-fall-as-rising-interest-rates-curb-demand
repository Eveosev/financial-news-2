What follows are opening calls for
U.S. grain and oilseed markets.  -- Wheat futures may open 5 cents to 8 cents a bushel lower on
the  Chicago  Board of Trade, the Kansas City Board of Trade and
the  Minneapolis Grain Exchange  on concern that global
consumption will ease as central banks increase interest rates
to stem inflation, said Greg Grow, the director of agribusiness
for Archer Financial Services Inc. in Chicago.  -- Corn futures are called to open 4 cents to 5 cents a bushel
lower in Chicago as the  Federal Reserve  may end its record
economic stimulus and China tightens credit policies, eroding
commodity demand, Grow said.  -- Soybean futures may open 8 cents to 10 cents a bushel lower
in Chicago on bets that China will reduce purchases amid rising
borrowing costs, Grow said. Soybean-oil futures are expected to
open 0.05 cent to 0.15 cent a pound lower, and soybean-meal
futures may open down $2 to $3 for 2,000 pounds.  To contact the reporter on this story:
