Russian natural gas deliveries to
Denmark may double from current contracted volumes, Russian
Prime Minister  Vladimir Putin  said today.  Russia is to supply 1 billion cubic meters of gas a year
using the Nord Stream AG pipeline, to be increased by 1 billion
cubic meters a year when a second pipeline becomes operational,
Putin said.  Gazprom doesnâ€™t expect Denmark to need more than 2 billion
cubic meters a year, Chief Executive Officer  Alexei Miller  told
reporters in Copenhagen today.  Nord Stream is to start deliveries in the fourth quarter.
According to a 2006 agreement between Gazprom and DONG Energy
A/S, Denmark is to buy 1 billion cubic meters of Russian gas a
year for 20 years starting in 2011. In October 2009, the parties
signed another contract for the supply of another 1 billion
cubic meters of gas to  Denmark  for 18 years, beginning in 2012.  To contact the reporter on this story:
