Yanzhou Coal Mining Co.,  China ’s
fourth-biggest coal producer, posted an 18 percent gain in
first-quarter profit as prices rose and demand for the fuel
increased in the world’s fastest-growing major economy.  Net income climbed to 2.48 billion yuan ($380 million), or
0.5034 yuan a share, from 2.1 billion yuan, or 0.4271 yuan, a
year earlier, the Shandong-based producer said in a statement to
the Hong Kong stock exchange today. Sales gained 33 percent to
9.3 billion yuan.  China’s economy  expanded 9.7 percent in the first three
months, beating a forecast in a Bloomberg survey of economists
for growth of 9.4 percent and boosting demand for energy and raw
materials. The selling price of Yanzhou’s coal rose 11 percent
in the quarter from a year earlier, according to the statement.  “Benefiting from the continuous demand for coal both from
domestic and overseas markets, the coal price of the company
increased in the first quarter,” Yanzhou said.  The fuel was sold for 691.6 yuan a ton, according to the
statement. Raw coal production rose 12 percent to 12.37 million
metric tons in the quarter.  Yanzhou, which bought  Australia ’s Felix Resources Ltd., is
seeking assets in  Canada , Indonesia and Mongolia to boost
overseas output. Profit more than doubled last year on higher
sales and coal prices.  The shares rose 56 percent in Hong Kong trading in the past
year, beating the 11 percent gain in the benchmark  Hang Seng
Index . Yanzhou climbed 1.7 percent to HK$30.25 today, before the
earnings announcement.  --Wang Ying. Editors: Ryan Woo, John Chacko.  To contact the reporter on this story:
