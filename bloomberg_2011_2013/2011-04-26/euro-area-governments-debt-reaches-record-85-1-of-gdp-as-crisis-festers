Euro-area debt reached a record in
2010, making it harder for the bloc’s better-off countries to
bear the costs of the fiscal crisis triggered by  Greece .  Debt rose in all 16 countries that were using the euro last
year, lifting the bloc’s average to 85.1 percent of gross
domestic product from 79.3 percent in 2009, the European Union’s
statistics office in Luxembourg said today.  Greece’s deficit topped expectations and debt ballooned to
142.8 percent of GDP, the highest in the euro’s 12-year history.
Ireland’s debt surged the most, by 30.6 percentage points to
96.2 percent of GDP.  “Greece should restructure sooner than later,” Lars Feld,
a member of the German government’s council of economic
advisers, said in a Bloomberg Television interview in  Frankfurt 
before the figures were released today.  Greek bonds stayed lower after the data came out. Earlier
today, Greece’s two-year yields rose to a euro-era record of
23.65 percent, before paring their advance. Ten-year yields
touched 15.06 percent, also a record.  The yield on Irish two-year government notes climbed 25
basis points to a euro-era record of 11.59 percent as of 10:07
a.m. in  London .  Contingent Liabilities  Aggregate euro-area debt moved closer to the  90 percent
level  that economists  Kenneth Rogoff  and  Carmen Reinhart  say can
weigh on long-term growth prospects.  Contingent liabilities from guaranteeing the banking system
after the 2008 financial panic now amount to 6.5 percent of GDP,
down from 8.6 percent in 2009, Eurostat said.  Under pressure from  Germany  to tighten the screws on
budgets, euro-area countries pared their overall deficit to 6.0
percent of GDP in 2010 from 6.3 percent.  While Greece trimmed its deficit to 10.5 percent of GDP in
2010 from 15.4 percent in 2009, the latest figure was higher
than the 9.4 percent estimated by the government in  Athens  in
February.  Germany wasn’t among the 12 countries with lower deficits.
The German shortfall widened to 3.3 percent from 3.0 percent,
edging back over the limit for euro users.  All advanced economies need to make “substantial further
adjustment” to restore fiscal health, the  International
Monetary Fund  said in an April 12 report.  Estonia, which joined the euro area in January, reduced
both its deficit and debt last year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
