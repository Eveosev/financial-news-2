Brunei Shell Petroleum Co., the
Southeast Asian country’s biggest oil producer, increased crude
official selling prices to the highest in 31 months after
benchmark futures rose.  The company priced its Seria Light Export Blend oil at
$118.69 a barrel retroactively for March, a company official,
who asked not to be identified because of internal policy, said
today in a mobile text-message. That’s up $16.89, or 17 percent,
from February and the highest since August 2008. The Champion
grade, a low-sulfur variety fixed at 15 cents below Seria Light,
sold for $118.54.  Brent crude contracts on the ICE Futures  Europe  exchange
increased for a seventh month in March on speculation that
unrest spreading from  Libya  may disrupt oil supply in the Middle
East. Futures have traded above $120 a barrel everyday in the
past three weeks.  Brunei Shell is a joint venture between  Royal Dutch Shell
Plc (RDSA) , Europe’s largest oil company, and the Brunei government.  To contact the reporter on this story:
