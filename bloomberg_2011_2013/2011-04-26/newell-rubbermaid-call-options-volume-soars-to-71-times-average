Newell Rubbermaid Inc. (NWL) ’s bullish
options trades soared to 80 times the four-week average before
the maker of food-storage and home products reports earnings
April 29 and rival  Tupperware Brands Corp. (TUP)  reports tomorrow.  “Option traders are scooping up calls in Newell Rubbermaid
ahead of Tupperware’s quarter for a sympathy move, looking for
shares to break higher,” said Joe Kunkle, founder of
OptionsHawk.com, a Boston-based provider of options-market
analytics.  Almost 11,000 calls to buy the stock changed hands, 295
times the number of puts to sell, as of 4 p.m. in New York. The
Atlanta-based company climbed 1 percent to $19.24, while
Tupperware gained 0.9 percent to $62.11. Newell’s most-active
contracts were June $20 calls, which rose 19 percent to 50
cents. They traded 9,085 times, compared with an open interest
of 1,351 outstanding contracts before today. Newell hasn’t
closed above $20 since Feb. 18.  Newell may report profit of 28 cents a share, the average
of 16 estimates in a Bloomberg survey, while analysts estimate
Tupperware will report 86 cents per share. Tupperware has
rallied 30 percent this year, more than five times the gain for
Newell.  To contact the reporter on this story:
