Canada ’s dollar gained for a second
day versus its U.S. counterpart as equities advanced amid demand
for assets related to global economic growth.  The loonie, as the currency is nicknamed, strengthened as
about 79 percent of companies in the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index
that released earnings since April 11 have exceeded analyst
estimates for per-share profit, compared with 72 percent in the
previous quarter, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The
Canadian dollar and the U.S. currency weakened against most of
their major peers.  “The global recovery is intact,” said Rahim Madhavji,
president at Knightsbridge Foreign Exchange Inc. in Toronto.
“The story behind this is sell the U.S. dollar and buy higher-
yielding currencies.”  The loonie advanced 0.3 percent to 95.18 cents versus the
greenback at 5:02 p.m. in Toronto, from 95.44 cents yesterday.
One Canadian dollar buys $1.0509.  The Canadian dollar has appreciated 11.8 percent since the
end of June and touched 94.55 cents on April 21, the strongest
level since November 2007.  The U.S. dollar dropped for a sixth day against the euro,
matching the longest losing streak since May 2009, on
speculation the  Federal Reserve  will consider measures to keep
yields low to support the  U.S. economy .  “Canada is going to be dragged around by the nose on
general U.S. sentiment,” said  John Curran , a senior vice
president in Toronto at CanadianForex Ltd., an online foreign-
exchange dealer.  Fed Stance  The  Federal Open Market Committee  will leave the target
rate for overnight lending between banks at zero to 0.25 percent
on April 27, according to all of the 83 economists in a
Bloomberg News survey. The meeting will be followed by Fed
Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke ’s first post-policy-decision press
conference.  “There’s a little bit of hype around expectations about
what the Fed may say,” Madhavji said in a telephone interview.
“You need a little shock and awe for the  U.S. dollar  to rally,
and I don’t think we’re going to get that.”  The Fed’s benchmark will increase for the first time since
December 2008, rising to 0.5 percent, during the first quarter
of 2012, according to the median forecast of economists in a
separate Bloomberg News survey.  Canadian  government bonds  rose, pushing the yield on the
benchmark 10-year security down five basis points, or 0.05
percentage point, to 3.19 percent. The price of the 3.5 percent
security maturing in June 2020 added 38 cents to C$102.43.  The  S&P 500 Index  increased 0.9 percent to 1,347.24, rising
to its highest level since June 2008. Crude oil, Canada’s
biggest export, fell from a 31-month high, dropping 0.3 percent
to $111.93 a barrel.  “Equity markets are generally doing a better today, and
that’s somewhat positive for the Canadian dollar,” said  Shaun Osborne , chief currency strategist at Toronto-Dominion Bank’s TD
Securities unit in Toronto.  To contact the reporter for this story:
