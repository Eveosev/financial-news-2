Aston Villa  manager  Gerard Houllier 
is expected to be released from the hospital in three to four
days after being treated for chest pain.  Houllier, 63, was admitted to Queen Elizabeth Hospital in
Birmingham on April 20 and tests revealed the pain was caused by
an inner wall tear of the descending aorta, club doctor Mark
Waller said on the soccer team’s  website .  “All the tests have confirmed that his heart is working
perfectly,” Waller said. “We are extremely encouraged by
Gerard’s improvement over the past six days and we now
anticipate that he will be discharged from the coronary care
unit at the Queen Elizabeth Hospital within the next three to
four days.”  Assistant manager Gary McAllister has taken charge of the
team in Houllier’s absence, including a 1-1 home draw against
Stoke over the weekend. Villa, which is 11th in the Premier
League, visits West Bromwich on April 30.  To contact the reporter on this story:
