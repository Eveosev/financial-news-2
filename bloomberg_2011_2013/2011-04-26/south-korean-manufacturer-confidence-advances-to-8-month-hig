South Korean manufacturers’
confidence advanced to the highest level in eight months as
rising global demand helps exporters offset higher production
costs and the won’s gains.  An index measuring expectations for May rose to 100 from 95
for April, the Bank of Korea said in a statement in  Seoul  today.
A measure of non-manufacturing companies’ expectations climbed
to 89 from 83.  The survey was conducted from April 13 to April 20 and was
based on responses from 1,609 manufacturers and 893 non-
manufacturers.  To contact the reporters on this story:
