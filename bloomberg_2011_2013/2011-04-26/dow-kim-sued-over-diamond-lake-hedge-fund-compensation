Dow Kim, a former Merrill Lynch &
Co. head of trading and  investment banking , was sued over $2
million in compensation claimed against the Diamond Lake
Investment Group hedge fund venture that he started and dropped.  Namuk Cho, who previously worked as the head of U.S.
derivatives trading at  UBS AG (UBSN) , said Kim promised him $2 million
in compensation for his services in 2007, according to the suit
filed April 25 in New York state  Supreme Court . He said he was
terminated in May 2008, days after demanding the money.  Kim, whom the suit cites as making more than $80 million at
Merrill from 2005 to 2007, left to start Diamond Lake in 2007.
In August 2008, he determined he couldn’t raise enough money,
according to a March 31 appeals court decision that reinstated
claims against Kim for breach of contract and unpaid wages. In
that case, Karl Wachter, who had been hired to serve as a
managing director and general counsel of Diamond Lake, sued Kim
over compensation.  “Kim specifically promised Cho $2 million as minimum
compensation for his 2007 services,” according to the new suit.
“Cho insisted that his $2 million minimum compensation be
unconditional and not subject to the launch of Kim’s investment
funds.”  Phone Conversation  Cho alleges in the complaint that, in a telephone
conversation in August 2007 over the pay, Kim said, “But then
it comes out of my pocket!” and added, “You will get your
$2 million.”  Attorney Leo V. Leyva, who represents Kim in the Wachter
suit, said yesterday in an interview that he hadn’t seen the Cho
suit and had no immediate comment.  A settlement conference in a similar federal case is set
for April 29. Michael Pasternak said he turned down a job at
Morgan Stanley based on representations that Kim made and took a
job with Diamond Lake. He was terminated without cause in May
2008, according to the complaint. He’s claiming damages of
$6 million.  According to regulatory records, Cho worked at Diamond Lake
in  New York  from October 2007 to May 2008.  The case is Cho v. Kim, 651089/2011, New York state Supreme
Court ( Manhattan ).  To contact the reporter on this story:
