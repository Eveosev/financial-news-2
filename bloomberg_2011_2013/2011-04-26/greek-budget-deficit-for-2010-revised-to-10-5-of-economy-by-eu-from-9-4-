Greece ’s 2010 budget gap was more
than a percentage point wider than the government estimated
after a review by  Europe ’s statistics agency, the latest blow to
the nation’s finances as it seeks to avoid a debt restructuring.  Last year’s shortfall was 10.5 percent of gross domestic
product, compared with 15.4 percent of GDP in 2009, Eurostat
said in a statement today from Luxembourg. In February, the
Greek government had said it met its revised target for a 9.4
percent deficit in 2010.  The revision is another setback in Greece’s efforts to meet
targets set out under last year’s 110 billion-euro ($160
billion) bailout from the European Union and the  International
Monetary Fund . The government still aims to cut the deficit to
7.4 percent of GDP this year, and earmarked 3 billion euros in
unspecified savings to account for fiscal slippage in 2011 as
part of 26 billion euros in measures announced on April 15.  Euro-area debt reached a record in 2010, Eurostat also said
today, making it harder for the bloc’s better-off countries to
bear the costs of the fiscal crisis triggered by Greece. Debt
rose in all 16 euro-region countries, lifting the bloc’s average
to 85.1 percent of GDP from 79.3 percent in 2009, the statistics
office said. Greece’s debt ballooned to 142.8 percent of GDP,
the highest in the euro’s 12-year history.  Restructuring  Growing investor concern that Greece won’t avoid defaulting
on its debt has sent Greek bond yields soaring to record levels
since April 14, when German Finance Minister  Wolfgang Schaeuble 
was quoted as saying Greece may need to restructure its debt.  Greek  government bonds  fell, pushing the yield on the two-
year security up 64 basis points to a euro-era record of 23.65
percent as of 7:38 a.m. in  London . The government in Athens has
ruled out a restructuring, saying it would devastate domestic
banks and hammer the economy.  “I don’t think that Greece will succeed in this
consolidation strategy without any restructuring,” Lars Feld, a
member of German Chancellor  Angela Merkel ’s council of economic
advisers, said in a Bloomberg Television interview today. “I
think that Greece should restructure sooner than later.”  Greece’s government said today it remained committed to
meeting the targets of its bailout program and stood ready to
take further measures to lower the deficit. The wider gap was
due to a larger-than-expected economic contraction last year as
well as deterioration in  tax revenue  and worsening finances at
local governments, social-security funds and public hospitals,
the  Finance Ministry  said in an e-mailed statement.  Greece’s economy shrank 4.5 percent last year, compared
with the 4.2 percent forecast in November when the 2011 budget
was announced.  Faster Cuts  Greece’s state-controlled pension funds recorded a deficit
of 500 million euros in 2010, instead of an initially reported
900 million-euro surplus, Kathimerini reported on March 29.
Greece plans to implement deficit cuts this year originally
scheduled for 2012 to offset a wider-than-anticipated 2010
budget gap, Naftemporiki reported today.  The measures announced by Prime Minister  George Papandreou 
earlier this month consist mostly of spending cuts and aim to
bring the deficit below 1 percent by 2015. They go further than
the demands set out under the bailout, which require Greece to
cut the shortfall to less than 3 percent by 2014.  The government also announced plans on April 15 to raise 15
billion euros in state-asset sales by the end of 2013, and 50
billion euros by the end of 2015.  To contact the reporter on this story:
