Barcelona ’s  Andres Iniesta  will
miss tonight’s first Champions League semifinal match at Real
Madrid with a calf injury.  Iniesta felt a “twinge” in his right calf yesterday,
Barcelona manager Pep Guardiola said on the club’s website. The
midfielder trained for only 10 minutes before going to the
dressing room for treatment.  Guardiola didn’t say whether the injury would keep Iniesta
out of the return match in the two-game series in Barcelona on
May 3.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
