Germany  exiting nuclear power would
not result in a burden to the environment as additional carbon
dioxide emissions from coal-fired plants would be offset
elsewhere,  Financial Times Deutschland  said in a news release
previewing tomorrow’s edition, citing comments by Jochen Flasbarth, president of the country’s Federal Environment
Agency.  In addition to exiting nuclear power, Germany should
consider alternatives to building new coal-fired power plants as
such plants may have to be shut off from 2030 for political
reasons before they recover their investment costs, the
newspaper cited Flasbarth as saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
