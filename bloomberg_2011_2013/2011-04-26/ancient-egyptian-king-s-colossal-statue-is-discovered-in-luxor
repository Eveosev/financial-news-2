A 13-meter-tall statue of ancient
Egyptian king Amnhotep III was uncovered during excavation work
in the southern Egyptian city of Luxor, the country’s Ministry
of State for Antiquities said today in an e-mailed statement.  The statue, which consists of seven large quartzite blocks,
is one of a pair that once flanked the northern entrance to the
king’s funerary temple in the  West Bank  of the city and was
damaged by a severe earthquake in 27 B.C., the ministry said.  The blocks are currently being restored in an attempt to
re-erect the statue in its original place, according to the
Cairo-based ministry.  Two other statues, one depicting the god Thoth as a baboon
and one of the lion-headed goddess, Sekhmet, were also
discovered, Abdel Ghaffar Wagdi, the supervisor of the
excavation said in the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
