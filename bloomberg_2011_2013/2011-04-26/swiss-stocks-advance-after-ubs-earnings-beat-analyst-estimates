Swiss stocks gained for a fourth
day, closing at a seven-week high, after  UBS AG (UBSN)  reported first-
quarter earnings that beat analyst estimates.  Switzerland’s biggest bank by market value rose 3.9 percent
as its wealth management division also reported the strongest
inflow of new money since the end of 2007.  Credit Suisse Group
AG (CSGN) , the second-largest, advanced 1.2 percent.  The  Swiss Market Index (SMI)  of the biggest and most actively
traded companies increased 0.3 percent to 6,476.59 at the 5:30
p.m. close in Zurich. The gauge has surged 7.6 percent from this
year’s low on March 16. The broader Swiss Performance Index
added 0.4 percent today.  “It’s a good result from UBS,” Morten Kongshaug, chief
analyst at Copenhagen-based Danske Markets, said by phone.
“Expectations are high for the financial industry to perform
better than they’ve done in the past two years.”  UBS climbed 3.9 percent to 17.23 francs for the biggest
gain since Feb. 8. UBS’s results helped other Zurich-based banks
as Credit Suisse rose 1.2 percent to 39.3 francs and  Julius Baer
Group Ltd. (BAER)  advanced 2.1 percent to 40.31 francs.  Transocean Ltd. (RIG)  lost 2.9 percent to 64.25 francs. A report
by the U.S. Coast Guard supported BP Plc’s efforts to have
Transocean carry a larger part of the billion-dollar losses from
last year’s oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico.  To contact the reporter on this story:
