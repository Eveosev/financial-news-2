Weather Services International 
reduced its 2011 Atlantic hurricane forecast to 15 named storms
from 17, while predicting the chances are high that a storm will
strike the U.S.  WSI, based in Andover,  Massachusetts , said today that eight
of the storms will probably become hurricanes, with winds of at
least 74 mph (119 kph), and three will become major cyclones of
Category 3 or higher on the five-step  Saffir-Simpson scale .  In December, WSI called for 17 named storms, nine of them
hurricanes and five of those major systems. A storm receives a
name when winds hit 39 mph.  “We do expect another active season in 2011, although not
to the level of 2005 or 2010,”  Todd Crawford , WSI’s chief
meteorologist, said in a statement. “However, while we expect
less overall activity this year, we do expect a more impactful
season along the U.S. coastline.”  The  Atlantic hurricane season  is closely watched because
the storms are a threat to oil and natural gas interests in the
 Gulf of Mexico  and agriculture in the South. Florida is the
second-largest citrus producer behind  Brazil , while the Gulf
accounts for 31 percent of U.S. oil output and 43 percent of
refining capacity.  Major hurricanes, with winds of 111 mph or more, are the
greatest threat to gas and oil platforms and are able to uproot
trees, crush poorly built houses and cause widespread power
outages, according to the  National Hurricane Center .  A Record Year  In 2005, the most active season on record, hurricanes
Katrina and Rita killed more than 1,800 people, caused $91
billion in damage, destroyed 115 energy platforms in the Gulf
and shut down 95 percent of Gulf oil production and almost 30
percent of U.S. refining capacity, according to government
reports.  Gasoline prices soared as high as $5 a gallon and shortages
were reported across the South.  Crawford said the U.S. coast was due for a hurricane
strike. The last hurricane to hit the U.S. was Ike in 2008.  In 2009 and 2010, only tropical storm-strength systems hit
the U.S. Last year, 19 storms formed, a tie for third-most-
active season on record.  “The hurricane drought in 2009 and 2010 is relatively rare
in the record,” Crawford said. “In fact, the U.S. has not had
a three-year stretch without a hurricane landfall since the
1860s. Our recent good fortune in avoiding landfalling
hurricanes is not likely to last.”  Earlier this month, researchers at  Colorado State
University  predicted 16 named storms would form, with nine of
them reaching hurricane strength.  U.K. forecaster Tropical Storm Risk predicted 14 named
storms, eight of which would become hurricanes. The group is
affiliated with  University College London  and is backed by the
insurers Aon Benfield, RSA Insurance Group Plc and Crawford &
Co.  WSI makes weather-related software and is owned by the
