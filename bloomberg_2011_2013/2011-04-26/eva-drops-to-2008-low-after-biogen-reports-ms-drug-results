Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. (TEVA) 
slid to the lowest since 2008 in Tel Aviv trading after Biogen
Idec Inc. reported results from a study of its multiple
sclerosis pill BG-12 that exceeded analysts’ expectations.  The shares of the world’s largest maker of generic drugs
lost 4.7 percent to 157.80 shekels, the lowest since November
2008, at the 4:30 p.m. close in Tel Aviv. U.S.-traded shares
have slid 7 percent since the April 21 report. Israeli markets
had been closed since.  Teva said results of clinical trials on multiple sclerosis
treatments can’t be compared unless agents are tested in a head-
to-head manner in the same trial.  To contact the reporter on this story:
