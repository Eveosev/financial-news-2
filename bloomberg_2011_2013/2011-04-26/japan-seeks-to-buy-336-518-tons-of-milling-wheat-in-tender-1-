Japan  is seeking to buy 336,518
metric tons of milling wheat from the U.S.,  Canada  and  Australia 
in a regular tender on April 28, the Ministry of Agriculture,
Forestry and Fisheries said.  Shipment is set from May 16 to June 15 for the Canadian
wheat, and from June 1 to June 30 for the other origins,
Masafumi Otsuka at the ministry’s grain-trade division said
today by phone. The volume is more than double the 147,712 tons
bought by the ministry on April 14, as the government skipped a
tender last week, he added.  The ministry, which controls overseas purchases and
domestic sales of wheat to stabilize supply, is  Asia ’s largest
buyer as a single entity. It bought 5.16 million tons through
regular tenders in the year ended March 31.  Details of this week’s tender are listed below:  To contact the reporter on this story:
