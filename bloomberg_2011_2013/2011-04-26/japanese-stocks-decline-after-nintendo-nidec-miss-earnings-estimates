Japanese stocks fell the most in a
week after Nintendo Co. and  Nidec Corp. (6594)  reported earnings that
missed estimates and  Standard & Poor’s  cut its rating outlook on
 Toyota Motor Corp. (7203)  and other Japanese carmakers.  Nintendo, the world’s largest maker of video-game players,
retreated 1.6 percent. Nidec, the No. 1 manufacturer of motors
for hard-disk drives, slumped 2.1 percent. Toyota, the world’s
biggest carmaker, dropped 2.4 percent after S&P reduced its
credit rating outlook on the country’s automakers in the wake of
last month’s earthquake and tsunami.  “Nobody has figured out how the earthquake disaster will
impact earnings at a lot of these companies -- not even the
companies themselves know,” said Naoteru Teraoka, general
manager at Tokyo-based Chuo Mitsui Asset Management Co., which
oversees about $28 billion. “We know that production levels
have fallen, but we don’t know when they’ll come back. That
uncertainty makes it hard to judge the outlook for earnings.”  The Nikkei 225 Stock Average fell 1.2 percent to 9,558.69
at the 3 p.m. close in  Tokyo , while the broader Topix declined
0.8 percent to 833.64. Both indexes fell the most since April 19.
The Topix has lost 10 percent since a magnitude-9 earthquake and
tsunami on March 11 devastated  Japan ’s northeast coast,
crippling a nuclear power plant and disrupting supply chains at
companies from Toyota to Renesas Electronics Corp.  Nintendo, Nidec Slump  Nintendo sank 1.6 percent to 20,010 yen, the lowest close
since July 2006. The video-game console maker forecast net
income of 110 billion yen ($1.35 billion) for the year ending
March 2012, missing the median estimate of 132 billion yen by 21
analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  Nidec lost 2.1 percent to 6,930 yen. The company, which
makes precision motors used in hard-disk drives, projected net
income will be 52.5 billion yen this fiscal year, compared with
the median analyst estimate of 74 billion yen.  Last month’s disaster interrupted production at many of
Nidec’s customers, making it difficult to forecast earnings, the
company said in a statement.  “The impact of the earthquake disaster was bigger than
expected,” Goldman Sachs Group Inc. analyst Daiki Takayama
wrote in a Japanese-language report dated yesterday. Takayama
cut his 12-month share price estimate on Nidec to 7,500 yen from
8,200 yen.  Quake Damage  Shionogi & Co., a drugmaker, plunged 4.4 percent to 1,318
yen, the biggest drop on the Nikkei, after the company missed
its profit forecast by 33 percent, citing a factory stoppage and
reduced sales in eastern Japan.  Carmakers declined after S&P cut the ratings outlook for
companies across the  auto industry . Toyota fell 2.4 percent to
3,195 yen. Honda Motor Co., Japan’s second-largest automaker,
dropped 1.6 percent to 3,055 yen.  S&P cut its outlook for Toyota and Honda to negative from
stable, citing weaker operating and financial performance in the
year ending March 2012 because of production cuts. S&P also
reduced the outlook for Nissan Motor Co. and parts suppliers
including Aisin Seiki Co. and Denso Corp.  The yen’s appreciation also weighed on carmakers, as it
reduces the outlook for earnings outside Japan. The yen
appreciated to 81.57 against the dollar today, compared with
82.23 at the close of  stock trading  in Tokyo yesterday. Against
the euro, Japan’s currency strengthened to 118.50 from 119.78.  Among stocks that rose,  KDDI Corp. (9433)  jumped 4.1 percent to
534,000 yen. Japan’s second-largest mobile-phone operator booked
255 billion yen in net income for the year ended March 31,
exceeding the median estimate of 237 billion yen by 20 analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg.  Nomura Holdings Inc. analyst Daisaku Masuno increased his
rating on the company to “buy” from “neutral” and boosted
the 12-month share price estimate by 16 percent to 653,000 yen.  To contact the reporters on this story:
