Asian stocks declined the most in a
week as companies from Nintendo Co. to  Nidec Corp. (6594)  reported
earnings that missed analyst estimates and after commodity
prices dropped.  Nintendo, the world’s largest maker of video-game consoles,
slipped 1.6 percent in  Tokyo . Nidec, a maker of motors for hard-
disk drives, sank 2.1 percent. Toyota Motor Corp., the world’s
biggest carmaker, dropped 2.4 percent after Standard & Poor’s
Ratings Services cut its rating outlook for  Japan ’s automakers.
China Life Insurance Co. fell 2.2 percent after first-quarter
profit declined. Mitsubishi Corp., Japan’s No. 1 commodities
trader, lost 1.2 percent after copper and oil prices fell.  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index slid 0.4 percent, the most
since April 19, to 137.95 as of 7:40 p.m. in Tokyo. The gauge
climbed 2.2 percent last week after U.S. companies including
Apple Inc. reported increased profits, signaling the global
economic recovery is accelerating. The  Federal Reserve  begins a
two-day meeting today as investors wait to see if policy makers
will maintain monetary stimulus to support the recovery in the
world’s biggest economy.  “As stimulus measures are withdrawn, company profits will
be affected,” said  Pauline Dan , Hong Kong-based chief
investment officer at Samsung Asset Management, which oversees
about $72 billion. “A lot of the demand in the past two years
has been driven by  government spending . While valuations are
reasonably attractive, investors need to be selective when
picking stocks as inflation remains a big concern.”  Nikkei, Kospi Fall  Japan’s  Nikkei 225 (NKY)  Stock Average decreased 1.2 percent.
 Hong Kong ’s Hang Seng Index fell 0.5 percent, while China’s
 Shanghai  Composite Index dropped 0.9 percent.  South Korea ’s
Kospi Index lost 0.4 percent.  New Zealand ’s NZX 50 Index slipped
0.2 percent.  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index gained 0.4
percent today. The index slipped 0.2 percent yesterday to
1,335.25 as lower commodity prices dragged down energy and raw-
material companies.  About 40 percent of companies on the MSCI Asia Pacific
Index that have reported earnings since April 11 beat estimates,
compared with about 79 percent among companies on the  S&P 500
Index. (SPX)   “Companies including Nintendo and Nidec projected
conservative profit outlooks and that suggests other large
companies will follow that,” said Fumiyuki Nakanishi, a
strategist at Tokyo-based SMBC Friend Securities Co.  Company Earnings  Nintendo declined 1.6 percent to 20,010 yen in Tokyo. The
company said net income slumped 66 percent to 77.6 billion yen
($949.5 million) in the year ended March. The earnings,
Nintendo’s forecast for a 42 percent jump in profit this fiscal
year and predictions for operating profit and sales all lagged
behind analyst estimates.  Nidec dropped 2.1 percent to 6,930 yen after projecting net
income will be 52.5 billion yen this fiscal year, compared with
the median analyst estimate of 74 billion yen. Drugmaker
Shionogi & Co. tumbled 4.4 percent to 1,318 yen after reporting
full-year net income totaled 20 billion yen, missing its profit
outlook by 33 percent.  Toyota Motor declined 2.4 percent to 3,195 yen. Honda Motor
Co., Japan’s second-largest carmaker, sank 1.6 percent to 3,055
yen. S&P cut its outlook for Japan’s automotive industry to
negative from stable, citing the impact of the nation’s record
earthquake last month on production.  Earthquake Uncertainty  “Nobody has figured out how the earthquake disaster will
impact earnings at a lot of these companies -- not even the
companies themselves know,” said Naoteru Teraoka, general
manager at Tokyo-based Chuo Mitsui Asset Management Co., which
oversees about $28 billion. “We know that production levels
have fallen, but we don’t know when they’ll come back. That
uncertainty makes it hard to judge the outlook for earnings.”  China  Life, the country’s largest insurer, fell 2.2 percent
to HK$29 in Hong Kong. The company said first-quarter net profit
slumped 22 percent to 7.97 billion yuan ($1.2 billion) from a
year earlier as payouts increased after policies matured.  Hyundai Merchant Marine Co., South Korea’s second-biggest
shipping line, decreased 2.8 percent to 33,000 won in  Seoul . The
company said it had a first-quarter operating loss of 24.1
billion won ($22.2 million) compared with a profit of 6.17
billion won a year earlier.  Hanjin Plunges  Bigger rival Hanjin Shipping Co. tumbled 7.5 percent to
27,850 won, the steepest decline in the MSCI Asia Pacific Index.
The results from Hyundai Marine raised concern that Hanjin
Shipping would report weaker earnings, Um Kyung A, an analyst at
Shinyoung Securities Co. in Seoul, said by telephone today.  Raw material producers declined after copper and oil
futures dropped. Three-month copper futures on the London Metal
Exchange fell as much as 3.3 percent today, while crude in  New
York  retreated from a 31-month high.  Mitsubishi Corp. (8058) , the Japanese trading house that gets
about 40 percent of revenue from commodities, lost 1.2 percent
to 2,162 yen in Tokyo. Jiangxi Copper Co., China’s biggest
producer of the metal, lost 2.7 percent to 36.89 yuan in
Shanghai. Cnooc Ltd., China’s largest offshore oil and gas
producer, decreased 0.9 percent to HK$19.70.  China Mengniu Dairy Co., the nation’s biggest liquid-milk
producer, sank 3.4 percent to HK$24 in Hong Kong as students in
China fell sick after drinking its products.  About 250 students in the country’s northwestern province
of Shaanxi became ill after drinking milk provided by Mengniu to
their primary school, the official Xinhua News Agency reported
on April 22. The company said on April 23 it’s cooperating with
the government to determine the cause of the incident.  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index rose 0.6 percent this year
through yesterday, compared with gains of 6.2 percent by the  S&P
500  and 1.7 percent by the Stoxx Europe 600 Index. Stocks in the
Asian benchmark index are valued at 13.2 times estimated
earnings on average, compared with 13.6 times for the S&P 500
and 11.3 times for the Stoxx 600.  To contact the reporter on this story:
