Poland ’s general government deficit
widened to 7.9 percent of gross domestic product in 2010,
exceeding the European Union limit for a third consecutive year.  The shortfall was 111.2 billion zloty ($41.3 billion) last
year, up from 98.7 billion zloty, or 7.3 percent of GDP, in
2009, the  Central Statistical Office  in Warsaw said today.  The EU has ordered Poland to cut its deficit to 3 percent
of economic output by the end of 2012. Poland has “a chance”
of meeting the target, according to Deputy Finance Minister
 Ludwik Kotecki . The Cabinet plans to trim the shortfall by as
much as 2.5 percentage points of GDP this year and at least 2
percentage points in 2012, Kotecki told PAP newswire on Feb. 17.  Economic growth accelerated to 3.8 percent last year from
1.7 percent in 2009, the office reported, in line with a
preliminary estimate of 3.8 percent. Fourth-quarter GDP expanded
4.5 percent from a year earlier, revised from a preliminary
estimate of 4.4 percent, the office said.  Public debt rose to 55 percent of GDP last year from 50.9
percent in 2009, the office said. The figure was slightly lower
than a preliminary estimate of 55.1 percent published by the
 Finance Ministry  on March 30. According to the March statement,
by Polish accounting standards public debt was 53 percent of GDP
last year, below the legal threshold that would trigger
mandatory austerity measures.  To contact the reporters on this story:
