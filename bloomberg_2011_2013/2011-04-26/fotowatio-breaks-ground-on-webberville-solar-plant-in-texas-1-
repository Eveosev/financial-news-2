A California unit of the Madrid-
based solar energy company Fotowatio SL completed financing and
began construction on a 30-megawatt photovoltaic project in
 Texas .  RES Americas Inc., a unit of U.K.-based Renewable Energy
Systems Ltd., will build the Webberville Solar plant and provide
maintenance services for five years,  Fotowatio Renewable
Ventures Inc. , said today in a  statement .  Austin Energy  agreed to purchase for 25 years the
electricity generated by the project, which is 15 miles (24
kilometers) east of Austin, Texas, and is expected to be
complete by the end of this year.  Germany ’s second-biggest
state-owned lender Bayerische Landesbank provided financing, the
company said.  The Webberville project will use panels from Changzhou,
China-based  Trina Solar Ltd. (TSL)  that will follow the sun using
single-axis tracking systems to increase power output, according
to the statement.  The cost of the project was not announced. Mark McLanahan
senior vice president of acquisitions at Fotowatio Renewable
said it “is very competitive” in an interview today.  “The project will be a good model for us going forward and
will enter commercial service before the end of the year,”
McLanahan said. “We have another 85 megawatts of projects in
the U.S. that we expect to put into construction this year.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
