The cost of insuring debt sold by
 Greece  and  Portugal  rose to records, according to traders of
credit-default swaps.  Contracts on Greece jumped 13 basis points from April 21 to
1,345 basis points, signaling a 66 percent chance of default
within five years, according to CMA. Portugal climbed 6 basis
points to 666.  That helped push the Markit iTraxx SovX Western Europe
Index of swaps on 15 governments up by 4.5 basis points to 201,
the highest since January. The gauge is up from 157.5 basis
points April 8, the lowest in five months.  Contracts on Italy increased 1 basis point to 157 and  Spain 
rose 1.5 to 254, while Ireland declined 5 basis points to 655,
CMA prices show. An increase signals deterioration in
perceptions of  credit quality ; a decline, the opposite.  The Markit iTraxx Financial Index linked to the senior debt
of 25 banks and insurers rose 1 basis point to 136, and the
subordinated index increased 3 to 245, according to JPMorgan
Chase & Co.  The Markit iTraxx Crossover Index of 40 companies with
mostly high-yield credit ratings rose 1.5 basis points to 366
and the Markit iTraxx Europe Index of 125 companies with
investment-grade ratings was 0.25 higher at 99.25, JPMorgan
prices show.  A basis point on a credit-default swap protecting 10
million euros ($14.6 million) of debt from default for five
years is equivalent to 1,000 euros a year. Contracts pay the
buyer face value in exchange for the underlying securities or
the cash equivalent should a borrower fail to adhere to its debt
agreements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
