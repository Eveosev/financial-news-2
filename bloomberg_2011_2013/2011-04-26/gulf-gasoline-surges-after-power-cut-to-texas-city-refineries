Gulf Coast gasoline strengthened
more than 4 cents after a power failure in Texas City, Texas,
shut units at refineries that can process about 800,000 barrels
of oil a day.  BP Plc (BP) ,  Valero Energy Corp. (VLO)  and  Marathon Oil Corp. (MRO)  were
working today to restart the units. Valero has regained power at
its 245,000-barrel-a-day plant, according to  Bill Day , a company
spokesman in San Antonio.  The discount for conventional, 87-octane gasoline in the
Gulf Coast narrowed 4.10 cents to 11.90 cents versus futures
traded on the New York Mercantile Exchange as of 2:21 p.m.
Prompt delivery gained 1.61 cents to $3.179 a gallon.  “Several transmission line segments in the Texas City area
tripped at approximately 4:30 this morning,” Dottie Roark, a
spokeswoman for the Electricity Reliability Council of Texas,
said in an e-mailed statement. The cause hasn’t been determined,
she said.  Earlier power interruptions were also reported in the area.  BP extinguished a “small fire” in a crude unit after a
 power failure  late yesterday, Scott Dean, a company spokesman,
said in a telephone interview.  All units at BP’s 475,000-barrel-a-day refinery were shut
down safely, Dean, who is based in Chicago, said in an e-mail.  Marathon is working to restore units at its 81,500-barrel-
a-day refinery, Shane Pochard, a Findlay, Ohio-based spokesman,
said in an e-mail.  Kinder Morgan Energy Partners LP plans to restart its Trans
Mountain Pipeline this afternoon, according to an e-mailed
statement. The 715-mile crude oil line, which runs from
Edmonton, Alberta, to terminals and refineries in British
Columbia and Washington, was shut after a leak April 22.  The discount for regular gasoline in Portland widened 1.5
cents to 3 cents a gallon versus futures.  To contact the reporter on this story:
