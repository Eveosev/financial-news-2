Yields on government securities
from Greece, Ireland and  Portugal  reached records amid
speculation the heavily indebted nations won’t be able to avoid
restructuring.  Ireland’s two-year yield reached a euro-era record 12.08
percent after the European Union said the nation’s debt burden
surged the most in the currency area last year. Greek two-year
yields have climbed almost 870 basis points this month, reaching
24.45 percent today as investors priced in losses, or so-called
haircuts, they may incur in the event of a restructuring. Lars Feld, a member of German Chancellor  Angela Merkel ’s council of
economic advisers, said Greece cannot avoid restructuring its
debts.  “There’s more speculation about debt restructuring, which
is reflected in the Greek curve,” said Christopher Rieger, head
of fixed-income strategy at Frankfurt-based Commerzbank AG. “I
don’t see where any support for Greek debt will be coming from.
The prices are still quite a long way away from any reasonable
haircut that people will expect if restructuring was
announced.”  Greece ’s two-year yields rose to a euro-era record of 24.45
percent and were at 24.24 percent as of 5:07 p.m. in London. The
4.6 percent security due 2013 fell 1.39, or 13.9 euros per
1,000-euro ($1,462) face amount, to 70.79. Ten-year yields
reached a record 15.38 percent, up from 12.84 percent on March
31.  Portugal’s two-year note yields touched a euro-era record
of 11.74 percent, up from 8.78 percent at the end of last month.
The 10-year yield reached a record 9.61 percent today, compared
with 8.41 percent on March 31.  Greek-German Spread  “I don’t think that Greece will succeed in this
consolidation strategy without any restructuring in the
future,” Feld told Bloomberg Television in  Frankfurt . “I think
that Greece should restructure sooner than later.”  The yield difference, or spread, between Greek 10-year
bonds and German securities of a similar maturity widened to
1,212 basis points, the most since Bloomberg began collecting
the data in 1998. The spread has widened 264 basis points this
month, even as the Greek government said it has no plans to
renegotiate terms with creditors.  The spread between Portuguese and German 10-year bonds
widened to as much as 636 basis points, the most since before
the introduction of the euro.  The cost of insuring debt sold by Greece and Portugal rose
to records, according to traders of credit-default swaps.
Contracts on Greece jumped 13 basis points from April 21 to
1,345 basis points, signaling a 66 percent chance of default
within five years, according to CMA. Portuguese swaps climbed
six basis points to 666.  Budget Gap  Earlier this month, Portugal became the third euro-region
country to seek an international bailout after Greece sparked a
sovereign-debt crisis that threatened to splinter the currency
bloc a year ago and then engulfed Ireland.  Greece’s 2010 budget gap was more than a percentage point
wider than the government estimated after a revision by  Europe ’s
statistics agency, a report today showed. Last year’s shortfall
was 10.5 percent of gross domestic product, compared with 15.4
percent of GDP in 2009, Eurostat said in a statement. In
February, the Greek government said it met its revised target
for a 9.4 percent deficit in 2010.  Ireland’s debt surged the most, by 30.6 percentage points
to 96.2 percent of GDP, the data showed.  Margin Increase  “The overshooting of the budget deficit forecasts has
added to concern about whether they will achieve fiscal
consolidation over the medium term, and consequently investors
are demanding a higher  risk premium  to hold those  government
bonds ,” said  Nick Stamenkovic , a fixed-income strategist at RIA
Capital in Edinburgh. “Further widening of yield spreads can’t
be ruled out in the near term.”  The yield on Irish two-year government notes climbed 73
basis points to a euro-era record of 12.08 percent after the
debt data release. Ten-year yields climbed to a record 10.65
percent, pushing the spread versus German bunds wider to a
record 740 basis points.  LCH Clearnet Ltd., Europe’s biggest clearing house, said it
will increase the extra deposit charge for customers holding
“long” positions in Portuguese and Irish government bonds.  LCH will raise the Portuguese margin to 35 percent from 25
percent, the company said today in a statement on its website.
The Irish margin will be boosted to 45 percent from 35 percent,
LCH said. The increased margin requirement takes effect from
tomorrow, LCH said.  Avert Inflation  European Central Bank President  Jean-Claude Trichet  said
today policy makers must avert any jump in inflation
expectations amid the risk of higher prices spreading through
the euro-region economy.  “We have risks of second-round effects here and there,”
Trichet said in the transcript of an interview with Finnish
publications Helsingin Sanomat and Kauppalehti. Second-round
effects refer to an increase in consumer prices that prompt
bigger wage increases, which then feed through to faster
inflation.  ECB policy makers increased their benchmark interest rate
by 25 basis points to 1.25 percent at their April 7 meeting. The
central bank is balancing the need for higher borrowing costs in
countries like  Germany  against soaring bond yields in the
region’s heavily indebted nations. The next policy meeting is
scheduled for May 5.  Spanish Auction  Spain  sold 1.16 billion euros of three-month Treasury bills
at an average yield of 1.37 percent, compared with 0.899 percent
at a previous sale of similar-maturity debt on March 22.
Investors bid for 4.43 times the amount of securities on offer,
up from a so-called bid-to-cover ratio of 4.33. Spain sold 806
million euros of six-month bills at an average yield of 1.867
percent.  Italy sold 8.5 billion euros of 185-day bills at an average
yield of 1.66 percent, up from 1.40 percent at a previous
auction of similar-maturity securities on March 28. Investors
bid for 1.43 times the amount of bills on sale, compared with
1.61 times previously.  German two-year note yields were within two basis points of
the lowest in a month, as turmoil in Greece boosted demand for
the perceived safety of the euro-region’s most-traded  government
securities .  The two-year yield was three basis points lower at 1.73
percent. The yield touched 1.716 percent on April 19, the lowest
since March 25. The 10-year bund yield dropped two basis points
to 3.24 percent.  Germany plans to sell six billion euros of 3.25 percent
bunds maturing in 2021 tomorrow, while Italy is scheduled to
auction inflation-protected securities due 2016 and 2021.  German government bonds have handed investors a loss of 1.8
percent this year, according to indexes compiled by the European
Federation of Financial Analysts Societies and Bloomberg, while
 U.S. Treasuries  have returned 0.6 percent. Italian debt has
earned 1.1 percent, while Spanish securities have generated 1.5
percent, the indexes show. Greek debt has lost 9.3 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
