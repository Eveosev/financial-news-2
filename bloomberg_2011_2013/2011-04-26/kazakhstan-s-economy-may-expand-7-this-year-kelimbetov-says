Kazakhstan’s economy may grow 7
percent this year bolstered by “favorable” conditions on
global commodity markets, Economic Development and Trade
Minister  Kairat Kelimbetov  said.  President Nursultan Nazarbayev ordered that the economy
must expand at least 7 percent, Kelimbetov said today at a
Cabinet meeting in the capital, Astana, according to an e-mailed
copy of his speech.  “We see reserves for the 7 percent growth in the processing
industry and construction,” Kelimbetov said.  The Kazakh
economy expanded 6.5 percent in the first quarter compared with
the same period last year, he said, citing preliminary figures.  To contact the reporter on this story:
