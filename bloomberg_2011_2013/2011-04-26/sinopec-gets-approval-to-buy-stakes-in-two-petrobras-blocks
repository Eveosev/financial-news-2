China Petrochemical Corp. received
approval from Brazil’s oil regulator to buy 20 percent stakes in
two blocks from state-controlled  Petroleo Brasileiro SA. (PETR4)   Sinopec, as the company is known, will join Rio de Janeiro-
based Petrobras at the BM-PAMA-3 and BM-PAMA-8 offshore blocks
in the Para-Maranhao basin in northern Brazil, the regulator
said today on its website. ANP, as the agency is known, didn’t
disclose the value of the sale.  Sinopec, which bought 40 percent of  Repsol YPF SA (REP) ’s assets
in Brazil for $7.1 billion last year, is expanding in the
country as China seeks to secure energy supplies overseas. The
company is looking to bid for exploration areas in Brazil and
may also seek to join existing projects as a partner, Carlos
Stenders, head of Sinopec in Brazil, said April 13.  Brazil plans to auction new exploration blocks in the
second half of this year and double production to 5 million
barrels a day by 2020.  To contact the reporter on this story:
