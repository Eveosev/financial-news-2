Portuguese state workers may
receive their extra summer and Christmas compensation payments
in the form of government debt securities such as savings
certificates, Diario Economico reported, without saying how it
obtained the information.  This measure is being considered by officials of the
 International Monetary Fund , European Commission and  European
Central Bank , who are in Lisbon following the country’s April 6
request for financial assistance, the Portuguese newspaper said.  If the measure is adopted, it may only be applied in time
to affect this year’s Christmas payment, according to Diario.
From next year, it would affect both the summer and Christmas
payments, the newspaper reported.     Click here for web link  To contact the reporter on this story:
