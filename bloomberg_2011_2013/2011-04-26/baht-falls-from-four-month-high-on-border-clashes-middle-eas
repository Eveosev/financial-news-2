The baht retreated from a four-
month high after border clashes between Thai and Cambodian
troops and as political violence in the Middle East intensified,
sapping demand for emerging-market assets.  Asian stocks fell and the euro weakened after Syrian
security forces attacked the city of Daraa yesterday as
President Bashar al-Assad seeks to stamp out a six-week uprising.
Thailand renewed its call for one-on-one talks with  Cambodia 
yesterday after three days of fighting along a disputed border
that has killed 11 soldiers.  “Investors are a bit concerned about the conflict between
Thailand and Cambodia,” said Tetsuo Yoshikoshi, a Singapore-
based senior economist at Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corp. “The
Middle East situation is quite turbulent at the moment. Traders
see the euro being sold and we have seen a correlation between
the euro and the Asian currencies.”  The baht declined 0.3 percent to 29.99 per dollar as of
4:35 p.m. in Bangkok, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
The currency reached 29.87 earlier, the strongest level since
Dec. 6.  The  Bank of Thailand  will intervene to curb excessive
volatility in foreign exchange rates without going against
regional trends, Governor Prasarn Trairatvorakul said in a
speech in Bangkok today.  “We will intervene sometime to curb excessive volatility,
but we never want to move against the market trend,” Prasarn
said. The Bank of  Thailand  will “closely monitor” the market
to prevent foreign exchange speculation, he said.  The onshore one-year interest-rate swap, the fixed cost
needed to receive a floating payment, rose 8.5 basis points to
3.035 percent. The yield on the 3.125 percent debt due December
2015 declined one basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 3.29
percent.
