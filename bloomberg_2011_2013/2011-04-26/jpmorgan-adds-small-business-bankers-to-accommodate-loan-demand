JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) , the second-
largest U.S. bank by assets, is hiring about 250 small-business
bankers this year to keep pace with a pickup in loan demand and
an expanded lending goal.  The bank is bolstering staff to accommodate customers in
California and  Florida  who were added after the firm’s 2008
acquisition of Seattle-based thrift Washington Mutual Inc., said
Michael Cleary, head of small-business lending. The unit
provides direct loans, lines of credit and credit cards to
companies with less than $20 million in revenue.  Cleary hired 450 new bankers in 2010 and added about 100
more so far this year. By December, JPMorgan will have about 40
percent more small-business specialists than the 1,950 who
worked for the unit in 2009, excluding support staff, he said.
The unit increased its lending commitment to small businesses to
$12 billion this year from $10 billion in 2010 as applications
and approval rates have climbed, he said.  “There’s some pent-up demand, they want to invest and the
quality of the borrower is improving,” Cleary said in an
interview yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
