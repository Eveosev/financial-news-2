3M Co. (MMM) ’s 2011 capital spending will
be mostly outside the U.S. for the first time in its 109-year
history, as the company chases sales in emerging markets.  Spending on plants, property and equipment in countries
growing more rapidly than developed markets is part of 3M’s plan
to garner full-year sales of more than $30 billion, a record.
Sales to  China ,  India  and other emerging markets now represent
34 percent of revenue, and the company  projects  they may make up
as much as 45 percent in 2015.  3M is building and expanding plants overseas to keep up
with demand for products such as optically clear adhesives used
in smartphones and computer tablets. About 70 percent of company
sales come from outside the U.S. and about 65 percent of
manufacturing takes place in the U.S.  This year “is the first time the company is now having
more than 50 percent of its capital deployed internationally,”
Chief Financial Officer David Meline said on a conference call.
“As we see the recovery in demand, we are adding capacity and
where we’re adding it is internationally, close to where the
growth is.”  About 48 percent of the  St. Paul , Minnesota-based company’s
$1.09 billion in  capital spending  last year was outside the
U.S., according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  3M today boosted its full-year earnings forecast after
first-quarter profit surpassed analysts’ estimates, fueled by
demand for films used in solar panels and tablet computers.  Profit this year will be $6.27 to $6.47, excluding pension-
related expenses, compared with a February forecast of $6.17 to
$6.42 a share, 3M said.  Films Sales  Sales increased about 20 percent at the industrial and
transportation division, whose products include films for solar
panels and windows, and at the electronics and communications
unit, which makes films for smartphones. 3M said the earthquake
and tsunami in Japan will curb 2011 profit by 10 cents to 13
cents a share, and favorable currency translation will help
offset that.  “The year has started off better than we would have
expected,” Stephen Tusa, a JPMorgan Chase & Co. analyst in  New
York , wrote today in a note. Tusa has a “neutral” rating on
the shares.  3M climbed $1.82, or 1.9 percent, to $95.94 at 4:15 p.m. in
New York Stock Exchange composite trading. That was the highest
closing price since at least 1980, adjusted for stock splits.
The shares have gained 11 percent this year.  First-quarter net income rose to $1.08 billion, or $1.49 a
share, from $930 million, or $1.29, a year earlier. Analysts
projected profit of $1.44, excluding some items, the average of
15 estimates in a Bloomberg survey.  Economic Bellwether  Revenue climbed 15 percent to $7.31 billion, compared with
an average estimate of $6.95 billion, with sales gains at all
six divisions. 3M is an economic bellwether because of its
product range which spans health-care, consumer, automotive and
energy markets.  3M’s full-year forecast tops analysts’ average estimate of
$6.22 a share and last year’s adjusted profit of $5.75 a share.  3M has five manufacturing sites and about 2,700 workers in
 Japan , where its largest businesses are industrial and consumer-
related.  3M today said favorable  currency translation  will increase
sales this year by 2 percent to 3 percent, up from a previous
forecast of 1 percent to 2 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
