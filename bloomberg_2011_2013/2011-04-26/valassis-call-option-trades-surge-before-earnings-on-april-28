Valassis Communications Inc. (VCI) ’s
bullish options volume reached seven times the four-week average
and the shares climbed before the distributor of advertisements

12:40 p.m. in New York, 14 times the number of puts to sell.
Valassis, based in Livonia,  Michigan , advanced 1.8 percent to
$26.94. Almost all bullish trades were concentrated in May
$27.50 calls, which rose 22 percent. Those calls had an open
interest of 2,318 contacts before today and 99 percent of
today’s trades were on the ask price, which indicate that buyers
initiated most transactions.  Implied volatility, the key gauge of option prices, for at-
the-money options expiring in 30 days rose to 46.67, the highest
