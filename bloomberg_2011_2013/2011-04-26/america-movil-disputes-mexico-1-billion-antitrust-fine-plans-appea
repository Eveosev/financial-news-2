America Movil  SAB, the largest
mobile-phone carrier in the Americas, said the record $1 billion
fine assessed by Mexico’s antitrust agency this month is based
on erroneous conclusions about the industry.  The company will appeal the ruling by asking the antitrust
agency to review the findings, America Movil said today in an e-
mailed statement. Mexico City-based America Movil, controlled by
billionaire  Carlos Slim , said it may also seek other legal
recourses, without providing further details.  Along with the fine, Mexico’s  Federal Competition
Commission  ordered America Movil’s Mexican unit, Telcel, to stop
practices that limit competition in the market for completing
phone calls. The fine was determined based on the duration and
recurrence of the practices, the agency said.  Rivals have to pay more to connect calls to Telcel’s users
than its own users have to pay to call each other, hurting
competition, the antitrust agency found. The agency said the
practice abuses the market power of Telcel in  Mexico , where the
company has 71 percent of subscribers.  Offering clients cheaper prices to call each other on the
same network is a standard industry practice worldwide, America
Movil said today. The fine is incorrect because Telcel hasn’t
been investigated in the past for the practices in question, the
company said.  America Movil fell 1 centavo to 32.73 pesos at 4 p.m. New
York time in Mexico City trading. The shares have dropped 7.7
percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
