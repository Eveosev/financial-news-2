Senegal Airlines, a closely held
national carrier that started in January, will begin flights
between Dakar and  Ivory Coast ’s commercial capital, Abidjan, on
May 16, the Foreign Affairs ministry said.  The airline will also fly between Abidjan and Conakry,
Guinea’s capital, according to an e-mailed statement today that
followed a visit by Foreign Affairs Minister Madicke Niang to
Ivory Coast.  Niang met with Ivorian President  Alassane Ouattara  and
asked him to investigate the deaths of Senegalese citizens in
Ivory Coast’s four-month long post-election crisis, according to
the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
