European stocks erased losses, led
by a rally in UBS AG and  Parmalat SpA. (PLT)   The benchmark Stoxx Europe 600 Index was little changed at
280.46 at 8:42 a.m. in  London , paring earlier losses of as much
as 0.3 percent.  UBS rose 5.9 percent to 17.56 Swiss francs in Zurich after
Switzerland’s biggest bank posted profit that beat estimates.
Parmalat jumped 11 percent to 2.56 euros in Milan after Groupe
Lactalis said it will bid for the rest of Italy’s biggest dairy
company in an offer valued at 3.4 billion euros ($4.9 billion).  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
