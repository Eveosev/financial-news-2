Natural gas futures fell for a
second day in New York as forecasts showed milder weather in the
South, reducing demand for gas-fired electricity to run air
conditioners.  Gas dropped 0.1 percent as forecasters including MDA
EarthSat Weather in Gaithersburg,  Maryland , said temperatures
will be in a normal or below-normal range in the southern states
next week. The weather in the region has been above normal since
last week.  “The weather is kind of moderating,” said Carl Neill, an
energy consultant at Risk Management Inc. in Atlanta. “We are
in an area of the market where we’ll have a lot of selling and
the market’s going to have a tough time extending too far up.”  Natural gas for May delivery fell 0.2 cent to settle at
$4.387 per million British thermal units on the  New York
Mercantile Exchange . The futures have declined 0.4 percent this
year. The May contract expires tomorrow. The June contract
dropped 0.8 cent to $4.444 per million Btu.  Options on May gas futures expired today. May $4.50 calls
were the most active options in electronic trading. The calls
dropped 0.9 cent to 0.1 cent per million Btu on volume of 530
lots.  The expiration of futures and options “is making the
market more volatile,” Neill said.  After this week, warmer air will probably be absent across
most of the U.S. through May 10, according to  Matt Rogers ,
president of  Commodity Weather Group LLC  in Bethesda, Maryland.  “A variable spring pattern is preventing heat from locking
in anywhere over the next two weeks,” Rogers said in a note to
clients today. “Instead, most areas see occasional quick hits
of heat.”  Texas Weather  Dallas  will have a high of 77 degrees Fahrenheit (25
Celsius) on May 3, 4 degrees below normal, according to
 AccuWeather Inc.  in  State College ,  Pennsylvania . The city had a
high of 87 degrees on April 24, 9 degrees above normal.  Temperatures in the Midwest will be below normal next week,
with Chicago approaching a “freezing” level, according to
EarthSat. Cold weather may lift demand for gas in the region for
heating.  Power plants  use 30 percent of the nation’s gas supplies,
according to the Energy Department. Residential consumers
account for about 20 percent.  Supply Report  The Energy Department may say on April 28 that gas
stockpiles gained 38 billion cubic feet in the week ended April
22, according to the median of four analyst estimates compiled
by Bloomberg. The five-year average change for the week is an
increase of 65 billion.  Gas rallied 2.4 percent on April 21 after the Energy
Department reported a smaller-than-expected gain in U.S.
stockpiles.  Inventories rose 47 billion cubic feet in the week ended
April 15 to 1.654 trillion cubic feet, the department said.  Gas futures volume in electronic trading on the Nymex was
208,943 as of 2:42 p.m., compared with the three-month average
of 318,000. Volume was 235,231 yesterday. Open interest was
943,702 contracts. The three-month average open interest is
921,000.  The exchange has a one-business-day delay in reporting open
interest and full volume data.  To contact the reporter on this story:
