A gauge of Swiss consumer demand
increased in March as low unemployment left consumers with
enough money to spend.  The consumption indicator rose to 1.66 from 1.45 in
February, the Zurich-based bank said today in an e-mailed
statement. New car registrations were the main reason for the
advance, reaching the highest for the month of March since 2001,
UBS said in its statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
