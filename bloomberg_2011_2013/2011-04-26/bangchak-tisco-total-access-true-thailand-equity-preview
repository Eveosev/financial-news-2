in a regulatory filing.  GFPT Pcl (GFPT)  , Thailand’s second-biggest listed
producer of chicken meat, rose 2.6 percent to 9.85 baht, the

in the first quarter jumped 24 percent from the previous
quarter, the brokerage said.  True Corp. Pcl (TRUE TB), which operates the nation’s

, Thailand’s second-biggest mobile phone company, asked
Thailand’s Central Administrative Court to issue an injunction
to thwart an agreement between state-owned CAT Telecom and True
Corp. to provide high-speed mobile-phone services. Total Access
asked the court to review the legality of the agreement signed
in January, according to a statement to the Thai stock exchange.  Total Access, whose shares were also traded without the
right to receive a cash dividend today, declined 2.7 percent to
49 baht. Investors had to own Total Access’s stock before today
