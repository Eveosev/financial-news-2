Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank PJSC (ADCB) 
reported a more than doubling of first-quarter profit, beating
analysts’ estimates, as loan-loss charges at the  United Arab
Emirates ’ third-biggest bank fell and fee income rose.  Net income advanced to 574.4 million dirhams ($156 million)
compared with 218.6 million dirhams a year earlier, the Abu
Dhabi government-controlled bank said in a statement on the
bourse website today. The mean estimate of four analysts was for
a profit of 472.5 million dirhams, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  The first-quarter results “reflect the improving economy
of the U.A.E. and the strength of our core operations,”
Chairman Eissa Al Suwaidi said in a separate statement.  U.A.E. banks are recovering after the global financial
crisis slowed lending, hurt  investment banking  and led to an
increase in bad loans. Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank is one of the
biggest lenders to state-owned Dubai World, which reached an
agreement in March to delay payments on $25 billion of loans.  Provisions, including for bad loans, fell 41 percent to 399
million dirhams, the bank said today. The ratio of the bank’s
non-performing loans to total lending fell to 10.3 percent at
the end of March from 11.1 percent at the end of 2010.  Non-interest income, including from fees, rose 22 percent
to 484 million dirhams, the bank said. Lending fell 2 percent in
the quarter from December to 126.1 billion dirhams, while
deposits rose 3 percent to 109.1 billion dirhams.  Emirates NBD  Emirates NBD PJSC (EMIRATES) , the U.A.E.’s biggest bank by assets,
reported earlier today a 27 percent rise in first-quarter profit
to 1.4 billion dirhams, helped by the sale of a stake in a
subsidiary.  National Bank of Abu Dhabi PJSC (NBAD) , the second-biggest
U.A.E. bank, reported April 19 a 10 percent fall in quarterly
profit to 927 million dirhams as loan-loss charges rose.  Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank said April 5 it hired Goldman
Sachs Group Inc. and Bank of America Corp.’s Merrill Lynch & Co.
unit to advise on whether to sell its 25 percent stake in
Malaysian lender RHB Capital Bhd, which it bought in 2008 for
3.9 billion ringgit ($1.3 billion).  The shares fell 0.4 percent to 2.69 dirhams yesterday. They
didn’t trade today. The stock has risen 30 percent this year
compared with a 4 percent gain in the  Abu Dhabi ’s ADX Banks &
Finance Index.  To contact the reporters on this story:
