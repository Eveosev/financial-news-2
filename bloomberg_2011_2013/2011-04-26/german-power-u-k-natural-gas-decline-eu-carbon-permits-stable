German power contracts and U.K.
natural gas declined, and European Union carbon permits were
little changed.  German power for 2012 lost 0.4 percent to 58.60 euros
($85.70) a megawatt-hour compared with the close on April 21,
according to prices from brokers compiled by Bloomberg as of
10:54 a.m. Berlin time.  U.K. gas for June fell 1.2 percent to 57.80 pence a therm
on the ICE Futures Europe exchange in  London . That’s the lowest
since March 10 and the equivalent of $9.54 per million British
thermal units. One therm is 100,000 Btu. EU emission allowances
for December dropped 1 euro cent to 16.86 euros a metric ton on
ICE. Northwest Europe coal for next month dropped 0.7 percent,
broker data show.  European power contracts can track U.K. gas because Britain
has the region’s biggest market for the fuel.  To contact the reporter on this story:
