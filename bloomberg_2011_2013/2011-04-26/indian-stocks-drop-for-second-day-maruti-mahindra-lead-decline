India ’s stocks fell for the second
day, tracking losses in Asian equities, on concern higher costs
of raw materials and borrowings will slow earnings growth.  Maruti Suzuki India Ltd. (MSIL)  dropped 1.8 percent as a tax break
helped the nation’s biggest carmaker post an increase in profit
and as IDBI Capital Market Services Ltd. said today the margin
outlook continues to be weak.  Reliance Industries Ltd. (RIL)  and
Infosys Technologies Ltd., which together have a 20 percent
weighting on the benchmark index, this month reported earnings
that trailed analysts’ estimates.  Mahindra & Mahindra Ltd. (MM) , the
largest maker of sport-utility vehicles and tractors, declined
1.5 percent.  “Higher wages, input costs and  interest rates  are putting
pressure on margins,” Kaushik Dani, a  fund manager  at Peerless
Mutual Fund, which has $1.1 billion in assets, said in Mumbai.
“A decline in Asian markets and expiry of derivatives contracts
this week contributed to negative sentiments.”  The Bombay Stock Exchange Sensitive Index, or Sensex, lost
38.96, or 0.2 percent, to 19,545.35 at the 3:30 p.m. close in
Mumbai. The S&P CNX Nifty Index on the National Stock Exchange
dropped 0.1 percent to 5,868.40 and its April futures settled at
5,875. The BSE 200 Index retreated 0.1 percent to 2,412.03.  Maruti slid 1.8 percent to 1,302.6 rupees and its April
futures settled at 1,304 rupees. “The margin outlook continues
to be weak, despite expectation of strong volume growth, led by
continued commodity inflation, weaker mix and limited pricing
power,” analyst Bhaumik Bhatia of IDBI Capital wrote. “We
maintain our cautious outlook on the stock.”  Mahindra & Mahindra declined 1.5 percent to 756.65 rupees.  Gillette India Ltd. (GILL) , the local unit of U.S.-based Gillette
Co., sank 3.8 percent to 1,815 rupees, its steepest drop since
Jan. 31 after its third-quarter profit slumped 52 percent to 207
million rupees ($4.6 million).  Commodities Drop  Sterlite Industries (India) Ltd., the biggest copper and
zinc producer, dropped the most in five weeks as commodities
prices declined. The stock lost 1.4 percent to 183.7 rupees.  Copper in  London  declined by the most in seven weeks on
concern demand in  China  may slow as credit-tightening measures
are extended, catching up with losses in  New York  and  Shanghai 
as the market reopened after a two-day break.  Reliance Industries Ltd. lost 0.8 percent to 1,001.15
rupees. India’s most valuable company has put on hold plans to
build a port and liquefied natural gas import facility in
Maharashtra, the Economic Times reported. Manoj Warrier, a
Mumbai-based spokesman for Reliance, declined to comment.  Roll Over  Derivatives traders rolled over fewer positions on concern
the cost of dealing may climb if the central bank raises rates
next week to tackle inflation, according to IIFL Premia, a unit
of India Infoline Ltd., the third-biggest broker by value.  Rollovers of Nifty futures before expiry on April 28 were
at 42 percent, compared with 50 percent on March 29, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg. The premium of Nifty futures over
the measure narrowed to 2 points, the smallest in the April
series, the data show.  The  Reserve Bank  of India has raised rates eight times
since March 2010 and will make its next announcement on May 3.  The Sensex has fallen 4.7 percent this year on concern that
rising borrowing costs will crimp profit growth. Companies on
the index trade at an average 16.5 times estimated earnings,
compared with 21.5 times in March 2010. The MSCI Emerging
Markets Index is valued at 11.7 times.  Overseas investors bought a net 6.23 billion rupees ($141
million) of Indian equities on April 21, taking their total
investments in stocks this year to 68.8 billion rupees, data on
the  website  of the  Securities and Exchange Board of India  show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
