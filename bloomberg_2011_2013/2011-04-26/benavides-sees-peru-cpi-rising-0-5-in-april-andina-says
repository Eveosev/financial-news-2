Peruvian consumer prices will
probably rise 0.5 percent in April from March as imported grain
prices rise, Andina  reported  in its online edition, citing
Finance Minister Ismael Benavides.  The government is limiting spending to avoid exacerbating
inflation pressures, Benavides said, according to the Web-based
state news agency. Annual inflation could have accelerated to
6.5 percent this year had the government not eased spending
plans, Andina said, citing Benavides.  To contact the reporter on this story:
