Treasury 10-year note yields
touched the lowest level in a month as the  Federal Reserve 
prepared to start a two-day policy meeting.  U.S. debt yields declined on speculation the central bank
will keep the target rate for overnight lending at a record low
and consider steps to stop yields from rising as the June end of
a $600 billion bond-buying program approaches. Fed Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  will brief reporters after the meeting in a new
move. The U.S. will sell $35 billion of two-year securities
today in the first of three note auctions this week.  “The big story this week is the Federal Reserve statement
and the press conference, which is presenting uncertainty and is
making it more challenging to set up for auctions,” said  Dan Greenhaus , chief economic strategist at Miller Tabak & Co. in
New York.  The 10-year note yield declined two basis points, or 0.02
percentage point, to 3.34 percent at 11:30 a.m. in New York,
according to Bloomberg Bond Trader prices. It touched 3.33
percent, the lowest level since March 24. The 3.625 percent
security maturing in February 2021 increased 6/32, or $1.88 per
$1,000 face amount, to 102 11/32.  Thirty-year bond yields fell four basis points to 4.42
percent. Two-year note yields slipped one basis point to 0.63
percent, matching the lowest level since March 23.  Treasuries’ gains were tempered as U.S. stocks rose. The
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index gained as much as 0.9 percent,
exceeding its highest closing level since June 2008, as
companies from United Parcel Service Inc. to Ford Motor Co. and
3M Co. beat analysts’ profit estimates.  Press Conference  Bernanke is scheduled to speak to reporters tomorrow at
2:15 p.m.  New York  time in his first press conference right
after a policy meeting. The Fed is scheduled to issue a policy
statement at about 12:30 p.m.  “It’s hard to know what to expect because we’ve never done
this before,” said  Ward McCarthy , chief financial economist at
Jefferies & Co. Inc. in New York, one of 20 primary dealers
required to bid at Treasury auctions. “The market won’t learn
everything, but we will know the party line on policy by the end
of the press conference.”  The central bank will leave the target rate for overnight
lending between banks at zero to 0.25 percent, according to all
83 economists in a Bloomberg News survey. The Fed has held the
rate at that level since December 2008.  Purchase Program  The Fed announced in November it would buy $600 billion of
Treasuries by the end of June to pump money into the economy and
support growth. It  purchased  $2 billion of U.S. debt today due
from May 2021 to November 2027 under the plan.  Policy makers will probably indicate tomorrow that
reinvestment of maturing securities will continue beyond June,
 Andrew Tilton , an economist at the primary dealer Goldman Sachs
Group Inc. in New York, wrote in a report yesterday.  The two-year notes being auctioned today yielded 0.680
percent in pre-auction trading, compared with 0.789 percent at
the prior offering on March 28. Investors bid for 3.16 times the
amount on offer last month, compared with the average of 3.42 at
the past 10 auctions. Indirect bidders, the category of
investors that includes foreign central banks, bought 33
percent.  “With the underlying flight-to-quality bid and the
shortest duration of this week’s $99 billion auction package, we
do not expect today’s auction to be an obstacle for the
market,” Justin Lederer and Amrut Bharambe, interest-rate
strategists at the primary dealer Cantor Fitzgerald LP in New
York, wrote in a research note to clients.  More Auctions  The government will sell $35 billion of five-year debt
tomorrow and $29 billion of seven-year notes on April 28.  Treasuries rose today after U.S. residential real-estate
prices dropped in February by the most in more than a year, in
line with economists’ estimates. The S&P/Case-Shiller index of
property values in 20 cities fell 3.3 percent from February
2010, the biggest year-over-year decrease since November 2009,
the group said today in New York. The drop matched the median
forecast in a Bloomberg News survey.  A government report later this week is forecast to show
U.S. economic growth cooled. Gross domestic product rose at a 2
percent annual pace from January through March after increasing
at a 3.1 percent rate in the final quarter of 2010, according to
the median forecast in a Bloomberg survey before the Commerce
Department reports the data on April 28.  Inflation Expectations  A bond market measure of inflation expectations the Fed
uses to help determine monetary policy was at 3.03 percentage
points, compared with 2.82 percentage points on March 23. It
reached a 10-month high of 3.28 percentage points in December.
The five-year, five-year forward break-even rate projects what
the pace of consumer price increases may be beginning in 2016.
It averaged 2.78 percentage points over the past five years.  The odds of a central bank rate increase by March 2012 have
fallen to 46 percent from 58 percent a month ago, futures
contracts show.  Volatility in the Treasuries market has fallen to a 13-
month low, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch’s Move
index. The gauge, measuring price swings based on over-the-
counter options maturing in two to 30 years, declined yesterday
to 74.80, the lowest level since March 17, 2010.  To contact the reporters on this story:
