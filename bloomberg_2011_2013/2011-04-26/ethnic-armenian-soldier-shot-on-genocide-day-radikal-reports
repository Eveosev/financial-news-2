An ethnic Armenian serving in the
Turkish army was shot and killed by a collaegue on the
anniversary of an alleged genocide of Armenians by Ottoman Turks
early last century, Radikal said.  The family of Sevag Sahin Balikci have requested a full
investigation of his death two days ago and will get lawyers to
inspect an autopsy report, the Istanbul-based newspaper
reported. The army said Sevag was killed after a colleague’s gun
went off by accident, Radikal said.  Armenians say at least 1.5 million of their people were
killed by Turks between 1915 and 1923.  Turkey  denies the claims,
saying hundereds of thousands of Turks and Armenians died in an
ethnic conflict.  Turkey is planning to demolish a giant statue near the
Armenian border that’s meant to signify friendship between the
two nations after Prime Minister  Recep Tayyip Erdogan  called it
a “freak.” Turkey and Armenia have yet to implement an accord
signed in October 2009 that would re-establish diplomatic
relations and open their common border.    Click here for web link  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
