BTA Bank, Kazakhstan’s third-
largest by assets, wrote off 481 billion tenge ($3.3 billion) of
loans in the 12 months to April 1, the Almaty-based lender said
in an e-mailed reply to questions.  BTA’s total portfolio shrank by 635 billion tenge as of
April 1 after the write-offs, loan repayments and currency
exchange-rate fluctuations, the bank said in the statement.  The lender reduced total loans to 1.6 trillion tenge last
month from 2.3 trillion tenge in March last year, the central
bank’s financial oversight committee in Almaty said on its
 website  yesterday. BTA’s portfolio was 1.6 trillion tenge in
February, the regulator said.  BTA defaulted in April 2009, two months after being taken
over by the state-owned National Wellbeing Fund Samruk-Kazyna,
which now holds a stake of about 81 percent in the bank. The
lender in September reduced its debt burden to $4.2 billion from
$16.7 billion by distributing cash to creditors and issuing new
securities.  Kazakh banks’ total loans dropped to 9.1 trillion tenge in
March from 9.5 trillion tenge a year earlier, according to the
financial regulator.  To contact the reporter on this story:
