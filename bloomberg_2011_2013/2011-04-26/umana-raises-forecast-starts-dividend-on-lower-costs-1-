Humana Inc. (HUM) , the second-biggest
provider of government-backed health benefits, raised its full-
year profit forecast and will begin paying a dividend after
medical costs for the first quarter were lower than expected.  Humana will pay a quarterly dividend  of 25 cents a share
and also will quadruple a share buyback program to $1 billion,
the Louisville, Kentucky-based company said in a statement
today. The insurer said first-quarter earnings excluding one-
time items were $1.86 a share.  Full-year earnings will be $6.70 to $6.90 a share, compared
with a previous forecast of $5.95 to $6.15, Humana said.
UnitedHealth Group Inc., the biggest health plan by sales,
raised its profit forecast on April 21 after finding new U.S.
mandates for spending on customerâ€™s health care proved less
costly than expected. Humana today cited lower medical bills,
including a 31-cent benefit for spending in previous quarters
that was less than anticipated.  Analysts in a Bloomberg survey had estimated average
earnings of $1.23 a share for the first quarter and $6.29 for
the year. Full results will be released May 2, the company said.  Humana, which also announced a reorganization of its
business units, said the divided will be payable on July 28 for
shareholders on record as of June 30. The share repurchase
program was authorized through June 30, 2013, the company said
in its statement.  UnitedHealth, based in  Minnetonka ,  Minnesota , is the
largest provider of government-backed benefits.  To contact the reporter on this story:
