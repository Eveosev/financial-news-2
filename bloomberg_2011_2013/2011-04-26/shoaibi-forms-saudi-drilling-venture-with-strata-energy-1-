Saudi Arabia â€™s Shoaibi Group formed
a joint venture with Strata Energy Services Inc. of  Canada  to
provide drilling services in the kingdom, Shoaibi said.  The venture, Strata Energy Services Saudi Arabia Ltd., will
offer technologies that allow a driller to evaluate an oil
reservoir while boring a well, Shoaibi said today in an e-mailed
statement. It may also provide services to recover crude in non-
traditional ways such as by injecting steam or carbon dioxide
into reservoirs.  The venture will be based in the eastern Saudi city of
Khobar and plans to expand into Bahrain and Algeria, Shoaibi
Group Director Faisal al-Shoaibi said in the statement.  To contact the reporters on this story:
