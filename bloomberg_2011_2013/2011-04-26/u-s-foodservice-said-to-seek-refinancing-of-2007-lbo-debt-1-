U.S. Foodservice Inc., the food
distributor bought by KKR & Co. and Clayton Dubilier & Rice in
2007, is seeking to refinance debt, according to a person with
knowledge of the matter.  The Rosemont, Illinois-based company will meet with lenders
at 10 a.m. tomorrow in  New York  , said the person who declined
to be identified because the terms are private.  JPMorgan Chase & Co. is leading the financing, said the
person said, who declined to be identified as the deal is
private.  In 2007 the company got a $2.04 billion first-lien  term
loan  due 2014, and a $1.03 billion revolving line of credit and
a $75 million asset-backed revolver, both due in 2013, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The New York-based private equity firms purchased U.S.
Foodservice, a unit of Royal Ahold NV, for $7.1 billion.  -- Editors: Chapin Wright, Pierre Paulden  To contact the reporter on this story:
