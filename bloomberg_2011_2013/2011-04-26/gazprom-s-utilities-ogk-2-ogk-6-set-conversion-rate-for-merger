OAO Gazprom’s OAO OGK-2 and OAO
OGK-6 power utilities announced the terms of their merger, set
to create  Russia ’s third-largest electricity generator.  One share in OGK-2 is weighted at 1.2141 shares of OGK-6
for the transaction, OGK-2 said today in a  presentation  on its
website. The buyout price for OGK-2 shareholders who don’t want
to participate in the share swap was set at 1.72 rubles each and
OGK-6 shares at 1.40 rubles, it said.  The combined company will produce about 8 percent of
Russia’s electricity, and have the third-largest installed
capacity behind OAO RusHydro, the country’s biggest hydro
generator, and OAO Rosenergoatom, which runs nuclear power
plants, according to the presentation.  OGK-2, which will continue to trade in Moscow after the
merger, will issue 26.6 billion shares for the exchange, the
Moscow-based wholesale generator said. That is more than 80
percent of its current shares outstanding.  Gazprom, the world’s biggest natural-gas producer, will
control 58.8 percent of the combined utility before buying back
shares from dissenting minority shareholders, according to the
presentation. OGK-2 minority shareholders may hold as much as
23.6 percent, and OGK-6 minority shareholders may have 17.7
percent.  The transaction, which must still gain shareholder and
antitrust approval, may be completed by Oct. 1, OGK-2 said.
JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Bank of America Merrill Lynch are the
financial advisers for the deal.  OGK-2 global depositary receipts will be delisted from the
London Stock Exchange and the utility will need to apply for
readmission to trading, the utility said April 21. Gazprom will
decide this summer whether to renew the foreign listing,
Interfax reported, citing Denis Fedorov, the head of Gazprom
Energoholding.  OGK-2’s board recommended paying dividends of 0.48759
kopeks a share for last year, while OGK-6’s board may pay
0.439874 kopeks, the utilities said today in separate
statements.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
