OAO Surgutneftegas fell by its most
in more than a week after the government revoked export tax
breaks on its Talakan field in eastern Siberia.  The stock fell as much as 3.6 percent before closing 0.9
percent lower at 29.28 rubles as of 6:45 p.m. in Moscow, its
biggest loss since April 18.  Surgutâ€™s Talakan project will have to pay the regular rate
starting from May 1, when the duty will rise to the highest
level since the 2008 financial crisis, according to an order
signed by Prime Minister Vladimir Putin April 25 and posted on
the government website today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
