Foreign investors’ holdings of
 Hungary ’s  government bonds , the highest in two-and-a-half years,
are getting “overcrowded,” making assets “more vulnerable”
to negative shocks, according to BNP Paribas SA.  Foreign investors increased their holdings of Hungarian
debt to the highest since October 2008 today, according to Debt
Management Agency figures available on Bloomberg. Forint-
denominated bonds have returned as much as 26 percent so far
this year for the biggest gains worldwide, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  “Foreign positioning in Hungarian bonds is becoming
increasingly overcrowded,” strategists at BNP Paribas including
Bartosz Pawlowski wrote in a research report today. “This
should make Hungarian assets more vulnerable to negative shocks
in our view and so we would rather position ourselves short
forint versus the Polish zloty.”  Hungarian bonds rallied this year following Prime Minister
 Viktor Orban ’s government pledge to cut welfare payments and
drug subsidies in what the  International Monetary Fund  called a
“welcome step” after it provided Hungary a 20 billion-euro
($29 billion) bailout with the European Union in 2008.  The yield on Hungarian government bonds due in 2020 fell 2
basis points to 7.025 percent as of 4:52 p.m. in Budapest, down
from 8.38 percent at the end of November. The forint
strengthened 0.2 percent to 264.68 per euro, extending its gains
this year to 5.3 percent, the most among more than 20 emerging
markets tracked by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
