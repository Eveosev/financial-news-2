Turkcell Iletisim Hizmetleri AS’s
executive board will meet tomorrow to discuss when to hold an
extraordinary meeting of shareholders, Haberturk newspaper
reported.  The board meeting comes amid a dispute between TeliaSonera
AB, Russia’s Altimo and Cukurova Holding AS of  Turkey  over
control of mobile phone operator Turkcell, Haberturk said. Altimo 
and TeliaSonera last week blocked dividend payments and the 
approval of Turkcell’s balance sheet for 2010 when chairman Colin
Williams declined to discuss changes to the board and government
officials backed him.  Turkcell Chief Executive Sureyya Ciliv is embarking on a 
two-day trip to persuade TeliaSonera and Altimo to at least drop 
their objections to approving the dividend payout, Haberturk said.    Turkcell is due to publish its earnings for the first
quarter tomorrow and will hold a teleconference on April 28 to
discuss the results with investors.  Click here for web link  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
