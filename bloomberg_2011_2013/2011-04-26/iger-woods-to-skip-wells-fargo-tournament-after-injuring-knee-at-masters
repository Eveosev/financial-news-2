Tiger Woods  will skip next week’s
Wells Fargo Championship because of a sprained left knee
sustained while hitting a shot off pine straw during the third
round of golf’s Masters Tournament.  Woods, who also strained his left Achilles tendon, said on
his  website  that he hopes to be back in a “few weeks.” His
status for the Players Championship, scheduled for May 12-15 at
the TPC Sawgrass in Ponte Vedra Beach,  Florida , isn’t known.  Formerly ranked No. 1 in the world, Woods, 35, hasn’t won a
tournament in 18 months.  Woods sprained the medial collateral ligament in his left
knee while hitting an awkward second shot from under the
“Eisenhower tree” off the 17th fairway at Augusta National
Golf Club in Augusta,  Georgia . He tied for fourth at the
season’s first major championship and then met with doctors, who
advised rest, treatment and cold-water therapy.  Woods had surgery to repair a torn anterior cruciate
ligament in his left knee in June 2008.  The world’s sixth-ranked golfer, Woods will skip the May 5-
8 Wells Fargo Championship at the Quail Hollow Club, in
 Charlotte ,  North Carolina , where he missed the cut for weekend
play a year ago.  “I personally contacted tournament officials and expressed
my regret in not being able to play,” Woods said on his
website. “This is an outstanding event, but I must follow
doctors’ orders to get better.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
