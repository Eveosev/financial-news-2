Russia’s Micex Index fell for a
second day as oil, the country’s main export earner, slipped
from a 31-month high.  The 30-stock gauge traded 0.6 percent lower at 1,759.43 by
3:35 p.m. in Moscow, extending yesterday’s 1.3 percent decline.
OAO Gazprom, the natural-gas export monopoly, and OAO Lukoil,
the second-biggest oil producer, dropped 0.5 percent. The
dollar-denominated RTS Index declined 0.1 percent to 2,029.15.  Oil for June delivery on the  New York Mercantile Exchange 
fell as much as $1.16 per barrel, and last traded down 0.2
percent at $112.07 per barrel. Yesterday, it traded at $113.48,
the highest since Sept. 22, 2008. Futures slid today after Saudi
Aramco Chief Executive Officer Khalid al-Falih said the world’s
biggest crude exporter is concerned about the impact of prices
on economic growth.  Oil producers OAO Gazprom Neft lost 0.5 percent to 141
rubles, OAO Tatneft declined 1.8 percent to 181.23 rubles and
OAO Surgutneftegas fell 1 percent to 29.23 rubles.  To contact the reporters on this story:
