Peruvian banks will probably
increase their dollar holdings, causing the sol to weaken, as
they prepare for a possible presidential election win by former
military rebel  Ollanta Humala , Barclays Capital Inc. said.  Rising demand for dollars from Peruvian banks, which had a
net dollar position of $821 million on April 19, could make it
“very difficult” for the central bank to contain the sol’s
decline, Barclays said in an e-mailed report to investors today.
The sol, which has weakened 1.4 percent in the past month, will
probably drop another 2.5 percent against the  U.S. dollar  to
2.90 if Humala wins a June 5 runoff, Barclays said.  The cost of insuring Peru’s debt against default may rise
on concern Humala will increase government control of the
economy and hinder growth if he’s elected, Barclays said. Peru’s
currency and default swaps reflect a 45 percent to 50 percent
chance of a Humala victory, the bank said.  “From a state of full denial a month ago, the market is
now adjusting to the risk that Humala could get elected,”
Barclays said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
