Ending billions of dollars in U.S.
tax breaks for the oil and gas industry would provide money for
investments to encourage clean-energy technologies, said  Gene Sperling , director of the National Economic Council.  While the Obama administration has been forced to reduce
spending, current fiscal constraints shouldn’t mean that “the
idea of increased investments in any area should be off the
table,” Sperling said today at a conference in Washington.  President  Barack Obama  urged congressional leaders today to
act quickly on proposals to eliminate tax breaks for the oil and
gas industry and use the savings to fund clean-energy programs.
The subsidies are estimated at $4 billion a year.  “In this type of fiscal moment, you have to ask yourself
whether that $4 billion” is worthwhile compared with using it
to reduce the deficit and “in the areas that could lead us to a
brighter and cleaner and more secure energy future,” Sperling
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
