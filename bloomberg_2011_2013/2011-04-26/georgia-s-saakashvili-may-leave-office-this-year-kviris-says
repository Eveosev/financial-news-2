Georgian President Mikheil Saakashvili will be ousted or step down this year, the  Kviris
Palitra  newspaper reported, citing opposition leader Erosi
Kitsmarishvili.  The president will be replaced this year “because our
people need urgent changes,” the Tbilisi-based newspaper
reported today, citing Kitsmarishvili, a former ambassador to
 Russia .  Kitsmarishvili said he frequently travels to  France  to
consult on the situation in Georgia with another opposition
leader, former Defense Minister Irakli Okruashvili, who now
lives in Paris.  Saakashvili’s spokeswoman Manana Manjgaladze declined to
comment on the article when contacted by Bloomberg News. The
president’s current term ends in 2013.  To contact the reporter on this story:
