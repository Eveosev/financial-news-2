Jiangxi Copper Co.,  China â€™s biggest
producer, said first-quarter profit more than doubled, after
metal prices rose, meeting a March forecast.  Net income rose to 1.6 billion yuan ($245 million), or 0.46
yuan a share, in the three months ended March 31, from 697.5
million yuan, the Guixi, Jiangxi province-based company said in
a statement today, citing domestic accounting standards.  Jiangxi Copper is benefitting after the metal reached a
record $10,190 a metric ton in February. Chinese copper demand
will grow by as much as 12 percent this year, Huang Dongfeng,
assistant to the general manager at Jiangxi, said March 30.  Revenue rose to 25.2 billion yuan from 15.9 billion yuan a
year ago, the statement said. The shares closed 0.4 percent
lower at HK$27.20 in  Hong Kong  and dropped 2.7 percent to 36.89
yuan in  Shanghai  today.  To contact the Bloomberg News staff on this story:
