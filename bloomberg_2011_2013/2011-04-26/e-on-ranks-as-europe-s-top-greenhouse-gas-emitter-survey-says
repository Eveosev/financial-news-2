E.ON AG (EOAN) , Germany’s largest utility,
is the biggest source of greenhouse gases among companies based
in Europe,  according to a survey  by the Environmental Investment
Organization, a British research and lobbying group.  E.ON, with headquarters in Duesseldorf, emitted 164.8
million metric tons of carbon-dioxide equivalent, the non-profit
group’s operational director, Sam Gill, said today by telephone.  That compared with 164 million tons of carbon from
steelmaker  ArcelorMittal (MT) ; 152.1 million tons from RWE AG,
another German utility; 122.1 million tons from Italy’s state-
run  Enel SpA (ENEL) ; and 98.2 million tons from  GDF Suez (GSZ)  SA of France.
The survey’s findings are based on data from 2010 or 2009. They
include measurements of carbon emissions within the European
Union and outside it, Gill said.  The EIO is based in Frensham in southern  England . It plans
to publish a global survey of greenhouse gas emissions later
this year, Gill said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
