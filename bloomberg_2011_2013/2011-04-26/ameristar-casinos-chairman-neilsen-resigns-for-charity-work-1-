Ameristar Casinos Inc. (ASCA) , the owner
and manager of eight U.S. casinos, said Executive Chairman Ray Neilsen will resign from the board May 5 to focus on his
family’s charitable foundation.  Neilsen, son of the Las Vegas-based company’s late founder,
wants to expand the work of a foundation established by his
father that primarily funds research into spinal-cord injuries,
Ameristar said in a statement today. The company didn’t say who
would replace Neilsen, who joined the company in 1991. Gordon Kanofsky is chief executive officer and vice chairman.  Ameristar in February said it would buy back 45 percent of
its stock from the Neilsen estate, representing most of the
family’s stake, and refinance debt in a $2.1 billion
transaction. The company in December scrapped efforts announced
Aug. 11 to sell itself.  Craig H. Neilsen, who built and ran the company for
decades, died in November 2006. He was paralyzed in a November
1985 car accident while driving home from the company’s casinos
in Jackpot,  Nevada . Ameristar today has casinos in Missouri,
 Colorado , Mississippi,  Indiana , Iowa and Nevada.  Ameristar fell 17 cents to $19.32 at 10:07 a.m. New York
time in Nasdaq Stock Market trading. It gained 25 percent this
year through yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
