HarbourVest Partners LLC , a Boston-
based  private-equity  firm, said its $752 million cash offer for
Absolute Private Equity AG has been accepted by the Swiss
investment fund’s board.  The offer values Absolute at $17.25 a share and is subject
to a minimum acceptance level of 50.01 percent, HarbourVest said
today in a statement. Absolute’s net asset value was $24.16 a
share on April 21 and its 60-day volume weighted average share
price was $16.25 on the same day, HarbourVest said.  “This transaction offers shareholders an opportunity to
exit their investment for cash at an attractive price, whilst it
enables others to remain invested alongside an experienced
partner,” said Thomas Amstutz, chairman of Absolute Private
Equity AG.  HarbourVest, which has offices in Boston,  London ,  Hong Kong 
and  Tokyo , this month  backed  a firm to buy Bank of America
Corp.’s non-real estate private-equity assets in Asia as it
seeks to expand its operations outside of the U.S. The firm will
make the purchase through an acquisition vehicle formed by its
secondary funds and HarbourVest Global Private Equity Ltd., it
said in the statement.  Absolute rose 0.9 percent to $17.15 at 10:30 a.m. in Swiss
trading.  HarbourVest said it expects the transaction to be completed
in the third quarter of 2011.  To contact the reporter on this story:
