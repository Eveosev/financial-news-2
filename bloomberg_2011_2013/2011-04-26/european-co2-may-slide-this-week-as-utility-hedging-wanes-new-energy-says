European Union carbon permits may
fall this week as utility hedging wanes, according to Bloomberg
New Energy Finance.  Emission allowances for December may trade in a range of
16.60 euros ($24.25) a metric ton to 16.85 euros, New Energy
Finance said today in an e-mailed research note. They were at
16.84 euros today as of 11:42 a.m. on the ICE Futures Europe
exchange in  London .  Demand for permits from utilities to hedge forward sales of
power appears to have fallen “substantially” to about 1
million tons of carbon permits a day from a peak of 3 million
tons, London-based analysts including Clemens Tummeltshammer
said in the report.  “As the liquidity is expected to remain low, close to
levels seen last Wednesday and Thursday, it is unlikely that
there will be many big players active on the market, as they
could get easily caught out,” Konrad Hanschmidt, another New
Energy Finance analyst in London, said today by e-mail.  To contact the reporter on this story:
