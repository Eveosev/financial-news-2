Japanese  stock futures  rose after a
report showed U.S. consumer confidence increased and Japan’s
government said 90 percent of earthquake-stricken factories will
resume production by July. Australian stocks futures advanced.  American depositary receipts of Advantest Corp., the
world’s biggest maker of machines used to test memory chips,
climbed 0.4 percent from the closing share price in Tokyo. Those
of Nissan Motor Co., Japan’s third-largest automaker by market
value, advanced 0.5 percent after Credit Suisse Group AG
maintained its “overweight” rating on Japanese carmakers,
saying the current share price is cheap. Those of Westpac
Banking Corp., an Australian bank, gained 0.6 percent.  Futures on Japan’s  Nikkei 225 (NKY)  Stock Average expiring in
June closed at 9,620 in  Chicago  yesterday, compared with 9,550
in Osaka, Japan. They were bid in the pre-market at 9,620 in
Osaka at 8:05 a.m. local time. Futures on Australia’s S&P/ASX
200 Index increased 0.4 percent today. New Zealand’s NZX 50
Index gained 0.3 percent in Wellington.  “The  U.S. economy  is recovering and corporate earnings are
strong,” said  Hiroichi Nishi , an equities manager in Tokyo at
SMBC Nikko Securities Inc. “More and more manufacturers are
resuming operations at factories. That means the impact of the
earthquake disaster won’t last for long, and that’s positive for
stocks.”  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index increased 0.1
percent today. In New York, the index rose 0.9 percent to
1,347.24 yesterday, the highest since June 2008, as earnings at
companies from 3M Co. to United Parcel Service Inc. and Ford
Motor Co. topped analysts’ estimates and after a report showed
confidence among U.S. consumers increased more than forecast in
April.  Fed Meeting  The Conference Board’s confidence index rose to 65.4 in
April from a revised 63.8 reading in March, figures from the New
York-based private research group showed yesterday. The median
forecast of economists surveyed by Bloomberg News projected an
advance to 64.5.  Federal Reserve policy makers began two days of meetings
yesterday, and will likely say they’ll complete a second round
of scheduled bond purchases worth $600 billion through the end
of June to help sustain the recovery.  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index advanced 0.2 percent this year
through yesterday, compared with gains of 7.1 percent by the S&P
500 and 2 percent by the Stoxx Europe 600 Index. Stocks in the
Asian benchmark are valued at 13.2 times estimated earnings on
average, compared with 13.7 times for the S&P 500 and 11.4 times
for the Stoxx 600.  The yen depreciated to 119.90 against the euro, compared
with 118.70 at the close of  stock trading  in  Tokyo  yesterday, as
European Central Bank President  Jean-Claude Trichet  indicated
policy makers stand ready to raise  interest rates  to counter
inflation expectations. A weaker yen boosts the value of
overseas income at Japanese companies when converted into their
home currency.  To contact the reporters on this story:
