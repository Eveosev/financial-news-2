North Sea Forties crude traded at a
higher price after Royal Dutch Shell Plc purchased a cargo.
Glencore International AG bought a Russian Urals shipment at a
narrower discount to benchmark Dated Brent in northwest  Europe .  Russia’s two largest oil export facilities will reduce
combined shipments of Urals crude by 2.4 percent in May from
this month.  North Sea  Shell bought a Forties cargo for May 10 to May 12 from
Vitol Group at 60 cents a barrel above Dated Brent, according to
a survey of traders and brokers monitoring the daily Platts
trading window. This compares with a premium of 40 cents for the
last trade on April 15.  BP Plc was unable to sell one consignment for May 6 to May
8 at 45 cents more than Dated Brent and another for May 9 to May
11 at 75 cents above the benchmark, the survey showed.  Hess Energy Trading Co., or Hetco, failed to sell a
shipment for May 12 to May 14 at 85 cents more than Dated Brent,
according to the survey.  Reported  North Sea  market activity typically occurs during
the Platts window, which ended today at 12:30 p.m. London time.
Prior to the window, Forties loading 10 to 21 days in the future
cost 53 cents more than Dated Brent, unchanged from yesterday,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Brent for June settlement traded at $124.04 a barrel on the
London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange at the close of the
window, up from $123.03 yesterday. The July contract was at
$123.62, 42 cents less than June.  Glencore bought 100,000 metric tons of Urals for May 6 to
May 10 delivery to Rotterdam from OAO Lukoil at $3.45 a barrel
below Dated Brent, compared with a discount of $3.60 for the
last transaction on April 21, according to the survey.  Statoil ASA delayed production at its Njord offshore
platform after detecting a gas leak.  Production was shut on April 24 because of operational
problems associated with a gas export compressor, according to a
statement posted on the company’s website. A gas leak was found
later the same day in one of the platform risers and its source
has not been determined.  Mediterranean  Gunvor International BV failed to sell 80,000 tons of Urals
for May 7 to May 11 delivery in the Mediterranean at $3.20 a
barrel less than Dated Brent, according to the survey. Urals was
last sold at a discount of $3.60 on April 19.  Urals shipments from Primorsk in the  Baltic Sea  will drop
by 4.8 percent from April to 1.47 million barrels a day while

to 794,477 barrels a day, according to a preliminary loading
schedule.  West Africa  Nigeria plans to ship seven cargoes of benchmark Bonny
Light crude in June, one more than in May, according to loading
