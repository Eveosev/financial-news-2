The Hungarian government will
complete a plan to help distressed borrowers in May,  Magyar
Hirlap  said, citing government spokeswoman Anna Nagy.  Negotiations between the cabinet and bank associations have
ended and expert-level talks should be concluded next month, the
Budapest-based newspaper said.  The plan will designate three categories of mortgage
holders and offer different means to help them, Magyar Hirlap
reported.  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
