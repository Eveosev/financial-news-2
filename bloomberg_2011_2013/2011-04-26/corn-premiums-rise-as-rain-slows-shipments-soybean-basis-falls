Cash premiums for corn shipped in
April to terminals near  New Orleans  gained relative to Chicago
futures as rain slowed river shipments, boosting demand for
immediate supplies. The soybean basis declined.  The spot-basis bid, or premium, for corn delivered this
month rose to 59 cents to 65 cents a bushel above May futures,
compared with 58 cents to 61 cents yesterday, U.S. Department of
Agriculture  data  show. The spot bid climbed to the highest since
April 11. The basis for soybeans delivered in April fell to 64
cents to 72 cents a bushel from 64 cents to 73 cents.  “Barge traffic has slowed, and corn basis has firmed”
after heavy rain the past two weeks, said  Roy Huckabay , an
executive vice president for the Linn Group in  Chicago . “People
are worried that delayed corn planting will increase demand for
supplies” left from last year’s crops, he said.  Corn futures for May delivery rose 3.75 cents, or 0.5
percent, to $7.6625 a bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade.  Soybean futures for May delivery fell 6.75 cents to
$13.8275 a bushel, the first drop in four sessions.  Major flooding is already  reported  at 58 locations, data
from the National Weather Service show. Moderate flooding was
reported at 111 stations, which include grain terminals and
locks and dams, from North Dakota to Louisiana, the service
said. A  record  crest on the  Ohio River  near Cairo, Illinois, is
expected on May 1, and many locations from Cincinnati to
 Memphis , Tennessee, will prior all-time highs, according to the
 agency .  To contact the reporter on this story:
