Express Scripts Inc. (ESRX) , a pharmacy
benefit manager, fell as much as 3.4 percent in New York trading
after first-quarter earnings missed analyst estimates.  Express Scripts declined $1.68, or 3 percent, to $53.69 at
10:12 a.m. in Nasdaq Stock Market composite trading, after
earlier touching $53.38. In a statement yesterday, the St.
Louis-based company reported earnings excluding one-time items
of 66 cents a share, missing the 69-cent average estimate of 26
analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  The company, which manages drug benefits for corporations,
unions and other clients, filled fewer prescriptions than
expected, a result of the fall-off in medical use that has
affected earnings across the health industry, according to  Dave Shove , a BMO Capital Markets analyst in  New York , in a note to
clients today. Express Scripts reiterated a 2011 profit forecast
of $3.15 to $3.25 a share.  “No surprise here: utilization has been down across the
healthcare sector and the first quarter was no exception,”
Shove wrote.  To contact the reporter on this story:
