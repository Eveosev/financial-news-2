Tokyo  Electric Power Co. President
Masataka Shimizu was turned back by a government order while
returning to Tokyo on a military plane after a nuclear emergency
was declared at one of the company’s power station.  An air force plane carrying Shimizu from Nagoya to Tokyo on
March 11 following the earthquake that sparked the emergency was
ordered back after take-off by Defense Minister Toshimi Kitazawa, the government’s top spokesman said today, confirming
a report in the Sankei newspaper.  “The defense minister’s order to give priority to
transportation for disaster relief was appropriate,” Chief
Cabinet Secretary Yukio Edano said at a briefing today in Tokyo.  Shimizu was in Nara 370 kilometers (230 miles) west of
Tokyo on the day the earthquake and tsunami triggered the worst
nuclear accident since Chernobyl, the Sankei said.  He made it to Nagoya airport about 280 kilometers from
Tokyo where trade ministry officials got permission to put him
on the plane, before the order came from Kitazawa to turn back,
the Sankei report said.  Tokyo Electric has been battling to cool nuclear reactors
and stop radiation leaks at the Fukushima Dai-Ichi station since
the cooling systems were knocked out by the tsunami.  Shimizu returned to Tokyo by private helicopter on March
12, Tokyo Electric spokesman Naoki Tsunoda said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
