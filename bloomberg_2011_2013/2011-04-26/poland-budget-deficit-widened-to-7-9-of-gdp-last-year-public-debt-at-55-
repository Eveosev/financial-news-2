Poland ’s general government deficit
widened to 7.9 percent of gross domestic product in 2010,
exceeding the European Union limit for a third consecutive year.  The shortfall, calculated according to EU standards, was
111.2 billion zloty ($41.3 billion) last year, compared with
98.7 billion zloty, or 7.3 percent of GDP, in 2009, the  Central
Statistical Office  in Warsaw said today. Public debt rose to 55
percent of GDP last year from 50.9 percent in 2009, the
statistics office said. The Cabinet will today discuss its
updated euro convergence report.  Poland must cut its deficit to 3 percent by the end of 2012
or face the risk of EU sanctions, including a suspension of
grants. The government, preparing for elections in October, also
needs to keep the deficit in check to avoid expanding public
debt triggering mandatory austerity measures.  "Today’s data are better than expected as far as public
debt is concerned," said Jacek Adamski, head of the Polish
Confederation of Private Employers’ economic department, in an
e-mail to clients. This means there is "no threat of the
sanctions foreseen in the public finance law in an election
year."  The zloty strengthened 0.3 percent to 3.9349 per euro by
2:20 p.m. in Warsaw.  ‘ Turning Point ’  The budget deficit has more than quadrupled since 2007
raising the risk of losing access to some of the EU funds that
helped the only country become the only member of the 27-nation
bloc to avoid recession in 2009.  Poland has “a chance” of meeting the 2012 budget target,
Deputy Finance Minister  Ludwik Kotecki  said on Feb. 17. The
government plans to trim the shortfall to 5.6 percent of GDP
this year and to as little as 2.9 percent of output in 2012, PAP
newswire reported April 15.  "I think 2011 is a turning point in Poland, as
macroeconomic policy has changed into tightening mode," Kaspar
Richter, senior economist at the  World Bank , said in an
interview. The deficit will narrow "significantly this year and,
with perhaps some additional measures, to near the 3 percent of
GDP mark in 2012."  The public-debt figure compares with a preliminary estimate
of 55.1 percent by the  Finance Ministry  on March 30. According
to the March statement, by Polish accounting standards public
debt was 53 percent of GDP last year.  Public debt figures according to domestic calculation,
which are monitored to determine whether mandatory austerity
measures will kick in, “can be expected at 1.5-2 percentage
points lower than today’s statistics office release,” Adamski
said.  Economic growth accelerated to 3.8 percent last year from
1.7 percent in 2009, the statistics office reported, in line
with a preliminary estimate of 3.8 percent. Fourth-quarter GDP
expanded 4.5 percent from a year earlier, revised from a
preliminary estimate of 4.4 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
