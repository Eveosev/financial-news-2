Japanâ€™s emissions of  greenhouse
gases  including carbon dioxide fell 5.6 percent in the year
ended March 2010 as energy demand from manufacturers declined,
the  environment ministry  said.  Emissions dropped to 1.209 billion metric tons in the year
that began on April 1, 2009, the ministry said in a faxed
statement today. Compared with 1990 levels, emissions decreased
4.1 percent, according to the statement.  Japan, a signatory to the  Kyoto Protocol , has pledged to
cut emissions by 6 percent from 1990 levels by 2012.  To contact the reporter on this story:
