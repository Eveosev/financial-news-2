Turkish stocks snapped five days of
gains on concern the  Federal Reserve  may end its bond-buying
program and violence in neighboring Syria damped demand for
higher-yielding assets.  The  ISE National 100 Index (XU100)  lost 346.32, or 0.5 percent, to
68,524.35 at 5:30 p.m. close in Istanbul. The lira depreciated
0.2 percent to 1.5237 per dollar. Yields on two-year benchmark
debt rose 2 basis points, or 0.02 percentage point, to 8.3
percent, according to the RBS Istanbul Benchmark Bond Index.  “If the bond-buying program ends, this would result in a
liquidity squeeze in the markets and this concern is affecting
us,” Evrim Erten, a trader at Is Investment Securities in
Istanbul, said by telephone.  The Fed begins a two-day meeting today and may consider
measures to support the economy as the end of its $600 billion
asset-purchase program approaches in June. Syrian security
forces strafed streets of the Southern city of Daraa with
machine guns and the government cut off water supplies as the
death toll from yesterday’s crackdown rose.  Syrian President Bashar Al-Assad’s decision to end the
emergency rule in place for half a century and his pledges of
future political and economic measures have failed to halt the
spread of demonstrations. At least 400 people have been killed
nationwide since protests began in  Syria  in mid-March, Ammar
Qurabi, head of Syria’s National Organization for Human Rights,
said yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
