US Airways Group Inc. (LCC) , the smallest
of the U.S. full-fare carriers, posted a wider first-quarter
loss as jet-fuel prices surged 33 percent.  The loss excluding some items was $110 million, or 68 cents
a share, compared with $89 million, or 55 cents, a year earlier,
the Tempe, Arizona-based carrier said in a statement today. That
was narrower than the 72-cent average of 13 analysts’ estimates
compiled by Bloomberg.  US Airways is the only carrier among the five largest in
the U.S. that doesn’t use hedging contracts to help adjust for
changes in fuel prices. The airline’s spending for fuel rose
37 percent to $734 million, passing labor as the largest cost.  “Our first-quarter results were clearly impacted by the
extremely high price of oil,” Chief Executive Officer Doug Parker said in the statement.  The carrier in March trimmed systemwide growth plans for
this year to 1.5 percent from 2 percent to reduce fuel use. Four
of the five biggest U.S. airlines have slowed capacity plans
this year.  US Airways  joined other major airlines in raising fares six
times during the first quarter.  Including unspecified costs linked to a US Airways regional
carrier and other items, the net loss widened to $114 million,
or 71 cents a share, from $45 million, or 28 cents. Sales rose
12 percent to $2.96 billion.  US Airways rose 15 cents to $8.28 yesterday in New York
Stock Exchange composite trading. The shares fell 17 percent
this year through yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
