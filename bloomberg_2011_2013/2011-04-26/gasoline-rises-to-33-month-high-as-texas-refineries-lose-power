Gasoline rose to the highest level
since July 2008 as three oil refineries in  Texas City ,  Texas ,
shut units after suffering power outages.  Futures gained 1 percent as production was disrupted at
refineries with a combined crude oil processing capacity of more
than 800,000 barrels a day. Gasoline also advanced on
speculation that U.S. supplies of the motor fuel slid last week
to an 18-month low.  “The power outage in Texas City affects over 4 percent of
the refining capacity in the nation,” said  Andy Lipow ,
president of Lipow Oil Associates LLC in Houston. “We will lose
gasoline production over the next couple of days as inventories
have already been steadily falling since the middle of
February.”  Gasoline for May delivery gained 3.43 cents, or 1 percent,
to settle at $3.3572 a gallon on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange . That’s the highest settlement for the front-month
contract since July 15, 2008.  The May contract’s premium over June-delivery fuel rose to
5 cents from 4.44 yesterday. The backwardation between the first
two contracts was the widest since Nov. 30.  BP Plc and Valero Energy Corp. each said their refineries
were shut after the power outage. Valero said power has been
restored and it’s restarting units. Marathon Oil Corp.’s Texas
City refinery also lost power.  Refinery Outages  Today’s power outages “add to the already protracted list
of problems seen in the U.S. refining industry over the past few
months, and will add to the difficulties in building gasoline
stocks head of the summer driving season,” JPMorgan Chase & Co.
analysts led by  Lawrence Eagles  said in a report today.  Gasoline stockpiles probably dropped 1 million barrels in
the period ended April 21, according to the median estimate of
14 analysts in a survey by Bloomberg News.  Supplies of gasoline in Padd 1, which includes New York
Harbor, the delivery point of the Nymex contract, were the
lowest since November as of April 15, according to Energy
Department data.  Total U.S. inventories were at a five-month low near the
beginning of the driving season after declining 14 percent since
Feb. 11, according to the department. Refinery rates were 3.4
percentage points below a year earlier.  Regular retail gasoline rose 0.6 cent to $3.869 a gallon
yesterday, AAA said on its website. That’s the highest price
since Aug. 4, 2008.  Supplies of distillates, including heating oil and diesel,
likely increased 250,000 barrels, according to the survey.
Refiners boosted rates 0.9 percentage point. The premium of
gasoline over heating oil increased 0.52 cent to 14.61 cents,
the most since March 30, 2010.  The department is scheduled to report last week’s
inventories at 10:30 a.m. tomorrow in  Washington .  Heating oil for May delivery added 2.91 cents, or 0.9
percent, to settle at $3.2111 a gallon on the exchange.  To contact the reporter on this story:
