U.K. business is losing 32 billion
pounds ($53 billion) a year because of absenteeism, with
employees taking twice as many sick days as those in the U.S.
and  Asia , according to research by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP,
the Financial Times reported.  British employees take, on average, 10 days of unscheduled
absence from work because of sickness each year, compared with
the west European average of 9.7 days, 4.5 days in the Asia-
Pacific region and 5.5 days in the U.S., the newspaper said,
citing PwC.  To contact the reporter on this story:
