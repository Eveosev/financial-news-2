Oil options volatility decreased as
the underlying futures slipped 8 cents in the past two days, the
smallest two-day decline since 1999.  Implied volatility for at-the-money options expiring in
June, a measure of expected price swings in futures and a gauge
of options prices, was 27.2 percent as of 4 p.m. in  New York ,
down from 27.6 percent yesterday.  Oil for June delivery slipped 7 cents to settle at $112.21
a barrel on the  New York Mercantile Exchange  after the head of
 Saudi Arabia ’s national oil company said the kingdom isn’t
comfortable with prices near a 31-month high and on concern
rising futures will slow the economic recovery.  Crude touched $113.48 a barrel in intraday trading
yesterday, the highest price since Sept. 22, 2008. Futures have
risen 33 percent in the past year. Oil’s two-day retreat was the
