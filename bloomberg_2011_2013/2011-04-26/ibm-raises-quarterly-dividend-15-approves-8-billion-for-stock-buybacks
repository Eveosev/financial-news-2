Corp. (IBM) , the biggest computer-services provider, increased its
quarterly dividend 15 percent and set aside more money for share
buybacks, sending the stock to a record.  The quarterly payout will rise by 10 cents for the second
straight year, to 75 cents a share, IBM said today in a
statement. IBM added $8 billion to the stock-repurchase plan,
bringing the total authorized by the board to $12.7 billion.  IBM last week said earnings will be at least $13.15 a share
this year, topping estimates, as it works toward a goal of at
least $20 a share in earnings by 2015. Today’s increases keep
the company on schedule for a goal to spend about $20 billion on
dividends and $50 billion on buybacks through 2015, IBM
Treasurer Martin Schroeter said in a phone interview.  IBM, based in Armonk, New York, rose 82 cents to $168.49 at
4 p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading, the highest
closing price in the 100-year-old company’s history. The shares
have climbed 15 percent this year.  Chief Executive Officer  Sam Palmisano , also plans to use
about $20 billion on acquisitions through 2015 to focus on IBM’s
four revenue-growth initiatives: cloud computing, analytics,
emerging markets and Smarter Planet, the concept that
infrastructure can be digitized to be made more efficient.  “The company’s a cash flow machine,” said Chris Whitmore,
a San Francisco-based analyst for Deutsche Bank. “It’s giving
people a little added confidence.”  $100 Billion  Palmisano, who took over in 2002, has increased earnings by
steering the company toward software and services. IBM has spent
more than $100 billion on dividends and buybacks since 2003, the
year Palmisano also became the chairman.  It’s the 16th year in a row that IBM has increased its
dividend. The company has boosted the payout by 10 cents each
year since 2006, except for 2009, when it halved the increase
amid the recession. The dividend is payable June 10 to
shareholders of record May 10.  The company ended last quarter with $13.2 billion in cash
and short-term investments.  To contact the reporter on this story:
