Environmental Protection Agency
rules using the  Clean Air Act  to limit  greenhouse gases  aren’t
an “ideal tool” to cut emissions and combat climate change,
agency Administrator Lisa Jackson said.  President Barack Obama’s EPA in January began limiting the
gases, using the  law  after Congress failed to pass legislation
last year. While the rules are needed to start curbing heat-
trapping emissions, legislation is the preferred step, Jackson
said today at an energy conference in Washington.  “I hope at some point we will move forward with
legislation again,” Jackson said.  The House of Representatives passed a measure this month
that would bar the EPA from regulating greenhouse gases under
the Clean Air Act. The same bill failed in the Senate in a 50-50
vote. Aides to Obama said they would recommend he veto the
legislation if it passes.  When asked today whether she thinks Congress will succeed
in stopping the EPA rules, Jackson said: “I certainly hope
not.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
