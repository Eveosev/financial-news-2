OAO Lukoil,  Russia ’s second-largest
oil producer, will recommended raising dividends 13 percent,
consistent with the company’s plan to raise payments to
shareholders.  OAO Lukoil’s board recommended a payout of 59 rubles a
share up from 52 rubles a share the previous year, Moscow-based
Lukoil said today in a statement. That would total 50.2 billion
rubles ($1.8 billion), equal to 20 percent of the Moscow-based
company’s $9 billion net income for 2010, the statement said.  “This will be in line with the overall strategy,” Lev
Snykov, an oil and gas analyst at VTB Capital said by e-mail
from Moscow today.  A 59-ruble payout is near the limit of the company’s
capacity because its  capital expenditures  will increase this
year for domestic and international projects, Snykov said.  The company aims to increase its dividend payout ratio to
30 percent by the end of 2019, according to a  long-term plan 
released late in 2009. The plan sought to lower the rate of oil
and gas production growth and increase free  cash flow  instead.  To contact the reporter on this story:
