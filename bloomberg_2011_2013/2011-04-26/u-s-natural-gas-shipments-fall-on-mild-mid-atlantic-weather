Natural gas shipments to U.S.  power
plants  dropped for the first time in three days on forecasts of
moderate temperatures in the mid-Atlantic that may reduce
heating and cooling.  A sample of scheduled deliveries to power generators in the
U.S. and Canada was down 0.9 percent to 14.5 million dekatherms
(14.2 billion cubic feet), according to data compiled by
Bloomberg as of 9 a.m. in  New York .  Power plants in a region that includes the mid-Atlantic and
Great Lakes were to receive 1.28 million dekatherms of gas, 12
percent less than yesterday, Bloomberg data show.  Scheduled shipments for U.S. residences declined 3.1
percent to 25.2 million dekatherms.  The high temperature in Cleveland today may hit 72 degrees
Fahrenheit (22 Celsius), 7 above normal, according to  Weather
Underground  in  Ann Arbor , Michigan. The high tomorrow may be 67,
8 above normal.  Wholesale gas delivered into Columbia Gas Transmission in
Kentucky, Ohio, Pennsylvania,  West Virginia , Virginia and New
York rose 2.12 cents, or 0.5 percent, to $4.4483 per million
British thermal units yesterday on the Intercontinental
Exchange.  Gas at the Henry Hub in Erath, Louisiana, the delivery
point for futures traded on the New York Mercantile Exchange,
climbed 3.88 cents, or 0.9 percent, to $4.3707 per million Btu.  To contact the reporter on this story:
