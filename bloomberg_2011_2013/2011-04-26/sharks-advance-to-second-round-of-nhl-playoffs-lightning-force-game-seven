The  San Jose Sharks  advanced to the
second round of the National Hockey League playoffs and the
Tampa Bay Lightning beat the  Pittsburgh Penguins  to force a
decisive Game 7 in their first-round series.  The Sharks beat the Los Angeles Kings 4-3 last night in Los
Angeles on an overtime goal by captain Joe Thornton. The second
seed in the Western Conference, San Jose won the best-of-seven
series four games to two.  “This is just the start, we have a lot of work to do,”
Thornton said in a televised interview.  The Lightning defeated the Penguins 4-2 as Steve Downie and
Ryan Malone scored third-period goals to snap a 2-2 tie at the
St. Pete Times Forum in Tampa,  Florida .  Pittsburgh, the fourth seed in the Eastern Conference, will
host the fifth-seeded Lightning in Game 7 tomorrow.  The NHL’s postseason has two decisive seventh games
scheduled for tonight.  The Vancouver Canucks, the top seed in the West, host the
defending Stanley Cup champion Chicago Blackhawks. The
Blackhawks have won three straight games after trailing 3-0 in
the series.  The  Philadelphia Flyers , the No. 2 team in the East, host
the Buffalo Sabres in tonight’s other Game 7. The  Boston Bruins 
are in Montreal looking to close out the Canadiens with a 3-2
lead in their Eastern Conference series.  To contact the reporter on this story:
