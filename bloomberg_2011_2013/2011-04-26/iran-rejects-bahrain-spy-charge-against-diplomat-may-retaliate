Bahrain’s charges of spying against
an Iranian diplomat are “baseless” and  Iran ’s government may
retaliate, said  Ramin Mehmanparast , a Foreign Ministry
spokesman, according to the state-run  Mehr  news agency.  Mehmanparast gave no details of how Iran may respond.
Bahrain yesterday asked Iranian diplomat Heget Elah Rahmani to
leave the country within 72 hours because of alleged ties to a
spy network operating in Kuwait, the official Bahrain News
Agency said.  Tensions between Iran and Bahrain have escalated amid
Iranian criticism of Bahrain’s crackdown on pro-democracy
protesters. While Bahrain, like Iran, is predominantly populated
by Shiite Muslims, Sunnis rule the Persian Gulf island.  To contact the reporter on this story:
