Aramex PJSC, the Middle East’s
largest courier company, said first-quarter profit rose to 49.8
million dirhams ($13.6 million) from 47.5 million dirhams a year
earlier, helped by growth in Gulf markets and acquisitions.  The company’s revenue increased 12 percent in the period to
595 million dirhams, from 530 million dirhams in the
corresponding period last year, Aramex said in a  statement  to
the Dubai bourse website today.  Earnings were “driven by strong performances in the Gulf
Cooperation Council countries, where revenues have experienced a
substantial increase since the beginning of 2011,” said Founder
and Chief Executive Officer Fadi Ghandour in the statement.  The company’s international express business was the
biggest contributor to operating income, Ghandour said. Growth
in European markets and recent acquisitions in  Africa  and Asia
also contributed, the statement said.  Aramex went through “challenging conditions” in the
quarter in countries such as Egypt and Bahrain, and suspended
its operations in Libya, it said. It will continue to expand
operations globally and seek growth in emerging markets in
Africa and Southeast  Asia , it added.  “Amidst regional political instability, higher fuel prices
and global inflationary pressure, our outlook for the rest of
this year remains cautious,” Ghandour said, adding that Aramex
was still eyeing acquisitions in East Africa and Central Asia.  To contact the reporter on this story:
