Manchester United  beat Schalke 2-0
in the opening game of their Champions League semifinal.  Ryan Giggs  and Wayne Rooney scored goals two minutes apart
in the second half at the Veltins Arena in Gelsenkirchen,
Germany.  United dominated the first half without being able to beat
Schalke goalkeeper Manuel Neuer, who made seven saves.  Giggs put the Red Devils in front in the 67th minute when
he ran onto a pass from Rooney and put a shot by Neuer. The same
players combined again moments later as Giggs set up Rooney to
fire home from about 12 yards (11 meters) out.  United will host the return game in the two-match series on
May 4. Real  Madrid  and Barcelona open their semifinal tomorrow
night in Madrid.  The final of European soccerâ€™s top club competition is
scheduled for May 28 at Wembley Stadium in London.  To contact the reporter on this story:
