 Immigration of workers to  Germany 
stemming from the expiration of rules restricting movement among
European Union countries will likely be limited to about 150,000
a year,  Hamburger Abendblatt  said in a preview of an article to
appear in tomorrow’s edition, citing comments by Klaus Zimmermann, who heads the country’s Institute for the Study of
Labor.  The immigration, mainly from eastern European countries,
will fall short of the 500,000 additional workers the country
needs over the medium term to be able to maintain its level of
prosperity, the newspaper cited Zimmermann as saying.  Germany should introduce a score-card system, similar to
those used in the U.S., Canada and  Australia , to attract more
highly skilled workers from other countries, Zimmermann said,
according to the newspaper.  To contact the reporter on this story:
