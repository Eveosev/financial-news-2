Vietnam ’s government said pledged
foreign direct investment into the nation declined almost 48
percent in the first four months of 2011 from a year earlier.  Committed investment dropped to $4.02 billion, the Foreign
Investment Agency of the Ministry of Planning and Investment
said in a  statement  on its website today. Disbursed foreign
investment gained 0.6 percent to $3.62 billion, it said.  The nation gave licenses to 262 new projects during the
period with a combined registered capital of $3.2 billion, while
88 existing projects boosted registered capital by $818.7
million in total, the ministry said.  Investment by overseas companies is one of Vietnam’s main
sources of foreign currency, and the government is aiming for
pledges of $20 billion in 2011. Officials devalued the dong for
the fourth time in 15 months on Feb. 11 in a bid to curb the
trade deficit, amid concern the shortfall is depleting Vietnam’s
foreign-exchange reserves.  “I suspect there is a bit of nervousness about the
country,” said Tony Foster, managing partner at  Freshfields
Bruckhaus Deringer  in Hanoi. “My instinct is that at the current
point of time there is a bit of a slowdown, especially in real
estate.”  Vietnam has raised  interest rates  this year to damp a surge
in inflation, which climbed to 17.51 percent this month, the
highest since 2008.  The increase in borrowing costs has contributed to a
slowdown in economic growth. First-quarter gross domestic
product rose 5.43 percent from a year earlier, compared with
7.34 percent in the three months through December.  --Nguyen Kieu Giang and Nick Heath in Hanoi. Editors: Sunil Jagtiani, K. Oanh Ha  To contact the reporter on this story:
