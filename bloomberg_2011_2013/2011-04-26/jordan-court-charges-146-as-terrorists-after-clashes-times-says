Jordanâ€™s State Security Court
charged 146 alleged Islamist hardliners with plotting terrorist
attacks following violent protests in the northern city of Zarqa
on April 15, the  Jordan Times  reported.  The suspects were rounded up after beating policemen with
swords and clubs during the clashes, injuring 83 security
officers, the newspaper said, without saying where it got the
information. Zarqa is the birthplace of Abu Musab al-Zarqawi,
the founder of al-Qaeda in  Iraq  who was killed by U.S.-led
troops in 2006.  Jordan has witnessed protests on a near-weekly basis since
the outbreak of revolts that ousted the presidents of Tunisia
and  Egypt  earlier this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
