Brian Baker , the Hong Kong-based
head of Asia ex-Japan for Pacific Investment Management Co.,
commented on the outlook for the Chinese yuan and other Asian
currencies.  The yuan fell 0.17 percent to 6.3435 per dollar in the 12-
month non-deliverable forwards market as of 3:49 p.m. in  Hong
Kong , reflecting bets the currency will gain 2.9 percent in a
year from the onshore spot rate of 6.5246.  “We are very constructive on China. We believe that the
renminbi will continue to appreciate. It will appreciate more
than the forward market has priced it in. The Chinese interest
rates will have to rise further to control inflation. We are
participating in the non-deliverable forward yuan market. We do
not invest in the domestic  bond market .  “Asian currencies will appreciate against the dollar
because their interest rates are rising. As oil and commodity
prices go up, it affects Asian inflation the most. They have to
raise interest rates and allow their currencies to appreciate to
fight inflation. We have large currency exposure in Singapore
and  South Korea .”  To contact the reporter on this story:
