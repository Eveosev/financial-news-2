Gold and silver futures fell for
the first time in two weeks as some investors sold the precious
metals following the rallies.  Yesterday, gold climbed to a record $1,519.20 an ounce, and
silver approached $50 an ounce, extending a surge to the highest
in 31 years. Today, silver tumbled the most in six weeks
following an 18 percent gain since April 12.  “Given the pace and scale of gains in gold and silver in
recent weeks, there is the threat of a deeper correction in the
coming sessions,”  James Moore , an analyst at TheBullionDesk.com
in  London , said in a report.  Gold futures for June delivery dropped $5.60, or 0.4
percent, to settle at $1,503.50 at 1:45 p.m. on the Comex in  New
York . The price, up 3.8 percent in the previous eight sessions,
has climbed 30 percent in the past year.  Silver futures for July delivery tumbled $2.094, or 4.4
percent, to $45.079, the biggest drop since March 15. Yesterday,
the price reached $49.845, the highest since January 1980.  The precious metals led commodities lower on bets that
monetary policy will tighten in the U.S. and China, boosting
 interest rates .  Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  will hold a media
conference after a policy statement tomorrow following a two-day
meeting in  Washington .  ‘Event Risk’  The meeting “is a possible event risk, but we expect that
Bernanke will confirm that U.S. short-term rates are most likely
to stay low,” Bayram Dincer, an analyst at LGT Capital
Management in Pfaeffikon, Switzerland, said in an e-mail. “This
confirmation of low nominal rates, combined with higher
inflation, will be positive for gold.”  Gold and silver probably won’t fall for more than three
days, said  Dennis Gartman , an economist and the editor of the
Suffolk, Virginia-based Gartman Letter.  “It’s more the action in silver that’s making me a little
queasy,” Charles De Vaulx, a manager at International Value
Advisers LLC, said yesterday in an interview with Margaret
Brennan on Bloomberg Television’s “InBusiness.”  This year, the metal has surged 46 percent, the most among
19 raw materials in the Thomson Reuters/Jefferies CRB Index.  Platinum futures for July delivery fell $22.70, or 1.2
percent, to $1,805.40 an ounce on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange . The price has climbed 3.5 percent in the past 12
months.  Palladium futures for June delivery declined $5.10, or 0.7
percent, to $755.75 an ounce. The metal has gained 33 percent in
the past year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
