Prices in Tehran’s traditional
bakeries have been increased by 25 percent as part of a
nationwide plan  Iran  to phase out food and energy subsidies.  The new prices for Sangak, Barbari, Taftoun and Lavash, the
four main varieties of traditional bread in Iran, are to be
applied in bakeries from today, Abbas Ghobadi, head of Tehran
province’s commerce organization said, according to the state-
run  Mehr  news agency.  Iran, which is grappling with international economic
sanctions over its nuclear program, started a five-year plan in
December to phase out subsidies on fuel, electricity and basic
 consumer goods . The government is paying a monthly 455,000 rials
(about $43) to Iranians who have signed up to receive grants to
compensate for the plan’s inflationary repercussions.  A Sangak loaf will now cost 5,000 rials, Ghobadi said.
Barbari, Taftoun and Lavash loaves will cost 3,750 2,500 and
1,250 rials respectively, he said.  The new price is the maximum at which the bread can be sold
in Tehran, the official said, adding that governors in provinces
outside the capital are allowed to lower prices at their
discretion according to local needs.  To contact the reporter on this story:
