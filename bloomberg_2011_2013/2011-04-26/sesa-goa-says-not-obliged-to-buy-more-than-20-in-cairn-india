Sesa Goa Ltd. (SESA) , a unit of  Vedanta
Resources Plc (VED)  that’s offered to acquire a stake in  Cairn India
Ltd. (CAIR) , says it isn’t obliged to buy more than 20 percent after
acquiring shares held by  Malaysia ’s Petroliam Nasional Bhd.  “We have got 10.4 percent in Cairn  India  from Petronas and
if we get 9.6 percent in the open offer, we can limit ourselves
to that,” Prasun Kumar Mukherjee, Sesa Goa’s managing director,
told analysts in an earnings call today. “We are not obliged to
buy any further.”  Sesa Goa started an offer to buy as much as 20 percent in
Cairn India from minority investors on April 11 at 355 rupees a
share as part of a plan by the London-listed parent mining
company to take over the local unit of U.K. oil explorer  Cairn
Energy Plc. (CNE)  The offer ends on April 30.  Sesa Goa, based in Panaji in India’s Goa state, declined as
much as 1.9 percent to 320.50 rupees in Mumbai trading and was
at 323.90 rupees at 10:45 a.m.  Petroliam Nasional, Malaysia’s state oil and gas producer
also known as Petronas, said April 19 it sold its entire 14.9
percent holding in Cairn India for $2.1 billion, without
identifying the buyers. Sesa Goa bought 200 million Cairn India
shares, amounting to a 10.4 percent stake, from Petronas at 331
rupees apiece, Vedanta said at the time.  Editors:  To contact the reporter on this story:
