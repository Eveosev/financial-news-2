U.S. municipal-bond credit ratings
were cut last quarter at the second-fastest pace since 2002 amid
the “toughest year so far” for state and local governments 
since the recession began, Moody’s Investors Service said.  Moody’s said today that it cut ratings on 66 borrowers,
including Nevada and  Kentucky , and raised 17 in the first three
months of the year. The ratio of downgrades to upgrades was 3.9
to 1. The rate trailed only the previous three months, which had
the highest ratio since 2002, the credit-rating company said. It
was the ninth-straight quarter in which more ratings were cut
than raised.  “The trend is likely to prevail for all of 2011,” Conor
McEachern, the Moody’s assistant vice president who wrote the
report, said in a statement.  Moody’s last month kept its negative outlook on U.S. state
and local government bonds, projecting that borrowers are facing
the worst pressure since the onset of the  18-month recession 
that ended in June 2009. Tax collections have yet to rebound to
their  2008 peaks  and federal  government aid  is lapsing this
year.  To contact the reporters on this story:
