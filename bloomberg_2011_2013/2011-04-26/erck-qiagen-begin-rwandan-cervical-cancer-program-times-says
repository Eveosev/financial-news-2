Merck & Co. and  Qiagen NV (QGEN)  will fund
a program in  Rwanda  to screen and vaccinate women against
cervical cancer, the  New Times  reported, citing Agnes Binagwaho,
permanent secretary in the Health Ministry.  Merck will provide more than 2 million doses of its
Gardasil vaccine to the government at no charge, while Qiagen
will deliver 250,000 Human Papilloma Virus screening tests to
the state, the Kigali-based newspaper said.  A nationwide program is targeting all women in the East
African nation within the next three years, it said.  Cervical cancer is the most common cancer among Rwandan
women and the program is the first of its kind on the continent,
the newspaper cited Binagwaho as saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
