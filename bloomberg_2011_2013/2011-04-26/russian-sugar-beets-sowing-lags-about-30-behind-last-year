Russian farms had sown 429,200
hectares (1 million acres) of sugar-beets as of yesterday, the
countryâ€™s Sugar Producers Union said on its website.  About 37 percent of the planned area had been sown, the
union said.  The total amount sown this year is 30 percent lower than
the 616,000 hectares at the same time in 2010, when sugar-beet
sowings made up 60 percent of the planned area, according to the
Agriculture Ministry.  To contact the reporter on this story:
