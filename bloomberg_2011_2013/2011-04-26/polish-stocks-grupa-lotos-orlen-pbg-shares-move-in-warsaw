Poland ’s WIG20 Index rose 19.02, or
0.7 percent, to 2,927.04 at the 5:30 p.m. close in Warsaw,
heading for a second daily drop.  The following are among the most active stocks on the
 Warsaw Stock Exchange  today. Stock symbols follow company names.  PKN Orlen SA (PKN PW), Poland’s biggest oil company, rose
0.7 zloty, or 1.2 percent, to 57.5 zloty.  Brent crude  for June
settlement on the London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange
climbed 23 cents to $123.89 a barrel.  PBG SA (PBG)   rose 3 zloty, or 1.9 percent, to 162.9
zloty, the first gain in six days. Poland’s second-largest
builder by market value sees no “fundamental” basis behind the
recent decline of its share price on the Warsaw exchange, Chief
Financial Officer Przemyslaw Szkudlarczyk said in a letter to
shareholders published on the company’s website. PBG’s forecast
of reaching net income of 200 million zloty on sales of 2.3
billion zloty this year is “cautious,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
