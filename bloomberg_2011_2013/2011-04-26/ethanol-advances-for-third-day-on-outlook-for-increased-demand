Ethanol futures advanced for a
third day in Chicago on speculation that a blackout affecting
refineries in Texas City, Texas, will lift demand for the
gasoline additive.  The grain-based fuel rose after a  power failure  disrupted
output at refineries owned by BP Plc,  Valero Energy Corp. (VLO)  and
 Marathon Oil Corp. (MRO) , representing almost 5 percent of U.S. fuel-
making capacity. Ethanol is blended with gasoline to stretch
supplies and meet federal mandates.  “The ethanol crowd has got to be applauding,” said Peyton Feltus, president of Randolph Risk Management Inc. in Dallas.
“That’s a lot of capacity and refineries don’t have on-off
switches. Ethanol gets to take the ride.”  Denatured ethanol for May delivery rose 1.4 cents, or 0.5
percent, to $2.645 a gallon on the Chicago Board of Trade.
Prices have risen 11 percent this year.  In cash market trading, ethanol in the U.S. Gulf was
unchanged at $2.725 a gallon and in Chicago the biofuel slipped
0.5 cent to $2.615, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Ethanol on the West Coast jumped 3 cents, or 1.1 percent,
to $2.75 a gallon and in  New York  the additive increased 1 cent,
or 0.4 percent, to $2.72.  Gasoline for May delivery gained 3.43 cents, or 1 percent,
to settle at $3.3572 a gallon on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange . That’s the highest settlement for the front-month
contract since July 15, 2008.  The contract covers reformulated gasoline, which is made to
be blended with ethanol before delivery to filling stations.  To contact the reporter on this story:
