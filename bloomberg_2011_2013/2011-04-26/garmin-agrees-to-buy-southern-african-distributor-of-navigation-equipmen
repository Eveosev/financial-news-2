Garmin Ltd. (GRMN) , the maker of global-
positioning equipment, said it signed a letter of intent to buy
the southern African distributor of its products.  Garmin Distribution Africa (Pty) Ltd. will be renamed
Garmin Southern Africa (Pty) Ltd. once the acquisition is
completed, the company’s Schaffhausen, Switzerland-based unit
said in an e-mailed statement today. The value of the
acquisition wasn’t disclosed and is still subject to final
negotiations, a due dilligence investigation and regulatory
approvals, Garmin said.  “Once we are fully integrated into the Garmin fold, we
expect to grow the business even more in our rapidly growing
region,” Min Kao, chairman and chief executive officer of
Garmin, said in the statement today. The company’s African
business will continue to operate out of Johannesburg.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
