Ralph Schlosstein, chief executive
officer of  Evercore Partners Inc. (EVR) , received a $3 million bonus
for 2010 after the investment bank acquired a  money manager  and
started a research, sales and trading business.  Schlosstein’s bonus consisted of $450,000 in cash and $2.55
million in restricted stock, according to a filing with
regulators today. That compares with an $8.6 million award in
2009, which included a $6.1 million signing bonus. Schlosstein’s
total bonus for 2010 was 65 percent less than for 2009, the New
York-based firm said.  Evercore founder and Chairman  Roger Altman , 64, hired
Schlosstein, 60, in May 2009 to replace himself as CEO. The
company acquired 49 percent of money-manager Atalanta Sosnoff
Capital LLC in June 2010 and started its institutional-equities
business in the same month. In 2010, Evercore’s investment-
management unit generated $77.6 million in revenue, up from
$14.3 million in 2009, according to the firm’s annual report.  Schlosstein’s total compensation in 2010 was $2.23 million,
which included a $500,000 salary, a $450,000 bonus and $1.25
million in stock awards for 2009, according to the filing.  Evercore awarded Altman a $3.85 million bonus for 2010,
consisting of $540,000 in cash and $3.31 million in restricted
stock, the company said. Altman’s 2010 award was 63 percent less
than his annual bonus for 2009, which was $10.5 million,
according to the filing.  Evercore said it started leasing an aircraft in May, paying
$55,000 a month plus additional rent if Evercore exceeds 450
hours of use during the lease term, according to the filing. The
company previously reimbursed Altman for his use of the
aircraft, in which he indirectly owns a 50 percent interest,
according to the filing.  To contact the reporter on this story:
