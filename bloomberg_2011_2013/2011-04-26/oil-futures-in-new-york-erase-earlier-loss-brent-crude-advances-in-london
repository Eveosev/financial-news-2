Oil erased earlier losses in  New
York  and advanced in  London  as the dollar extended its decline,
increasing the investment appeal of crude and other commodities
priced in the U.S. currency.  Oil for June delivery on the  New York Mercantile Exchange 
was up 13 cents at $112.41 a barrel at 10:23 a.m. London time,
after falling as much as 1 percent.  Brent crude  for June
settlement gained 61 cents to $124.27 a barrel.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
