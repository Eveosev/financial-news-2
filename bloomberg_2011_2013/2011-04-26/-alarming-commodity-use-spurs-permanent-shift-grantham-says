Global demand for energy, metals
and crops is outpacing supplies “at an alarming rate,”
spurring a “permanent shift” in values of natural resources,
said Jeremy Grantham of Grantham, Mayo, Van Otterloo & Co.  The rising global population, growing consumption in  China 
and smaller supplies of available land are slashing reserves of
finite  commodities , said Grantham, a co-founder of Boston-based
GMO, an investment-management firm. The Thomson
Reuters/Jefferies CRB Index of 19 raw materials is up 32 percent
in the past year, sending food prices to a record in February.
Yesterday, crude oil reached a 31-month high.  “From now on, price pressure and shortages of resources
will be a permanent feature of our lives,” Grantham, the firm’s
chief investment strategist, said in a quarterly report posted
on GMO’s website. “This will increasingly slow down the growth
rate of the developed and developing world and put a severe
burden on poor countries.”  Adjusted for inflation, most commodity prices declined
about 1.2 percent annually over the previous century, before
bottoming in 2002. Since then, “this entire decline was erased
by a bigger surge than occurred during World War II,” Grantham
said. Such growth is “unsustainable,” he said.  “Statistically, most commodities are now so far away from
their former downward trend that it makes it very probable that
the old trend has changed,” Grantham said. “There is in fact a
paradigm shift, perhaps the most important economic event since
the Industrial Revolution.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
