Osaka  Securities Exchange Co. will
waive listing fees for a year for companies affected by  Japan ’s
March 11 earthquake and tsunami, Michio Yoneda, president of the
bourse, said in Osaka.  The exemption will likely apply to 28 companies with
headquarters in the quake-affected areas of Aomori, Iwate,
Miyagi, Fukushima and Ibaraki prefectures,Yoneda said today.  The Osaka bourse is “slowly moving ahead” in merger talks
with the  Tokyo  Stock Exchange Group Inc., Yoneda said separately.
He declined to give details.  Atsushi Saito, president of Tokyo’s exchange, said on March
22 that the two companies are considering a merger. The tie-up
would be the latest in a wave of planned consolidations between
bourses that have been announced in the last six months,
including Deutsche Boerse AG’s agreement in February to buy  NYSE
Euronext. (NYX)   To contact the reporters on this story:
