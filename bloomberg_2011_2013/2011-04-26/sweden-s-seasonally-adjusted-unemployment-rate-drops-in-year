Sweden’s seasonally-adjusted
unemployment fell from a year earlier, and more people joined
the  labor force , as businesses seek workers in the European
Union’s fastest-growing economy.  Sweden’s seasonally-adjusted, trended jobless rate was 7.7
percent in March, compared with 8.7 percent a year earlier, the
Stockholm-based statistics agency said today. That rate was 7.7
percent in February.  “There are signs that the  labour market  is getting
tighter, such as the rising labor shortage,” Torbjoern Isaksson, an economist at Nordea Bank AB, said in a note to
clients.  “A tighter labor market will in turn fuel wage
increases longer out, probably above the Riksbank’s view.”  The Swedish central bank raised its benchmark repo rate
this month a sixth time since July, and kept a forecast for
coming increases unchanged, as it seeks to cap inflation. The
seven-day repo rate was raised a quarter of a percentage point
to 1.75 percent. The bank expects its rate to average 2.5
percent in the first quarter of next year and 3.2 percent in the
first three months of 2013.  The largest Nordic economy will expand 4.6 percent this
year, the government said this month. Output will grow 3.8
percent in 2012 and 3.6 percent in 2013, it estimates, raising
March forecasts.  To contact the reporter on this story:
