UBS AG (UBSN) ,  Switzerland ’s biggest bank,
said it raised base salaries for employees last month after
cutting the 2010 bonus pool by 10 percent.  The Zurich-based bank increased base salaries in March by
about 5 percent to 10 percent “across the board in response to
the market,” Chief Financial Officer John Cryan told reporters
on a conference call today.  While the increase may boost personnel expenses in the
coming quarters, this may be partly offset by reduced bonus
accruals, Cryan said. UBS said in February that it cut the 2010
bonus pool, including pay that is being deferred into future
years, to 4.3 billion Swiss francs ($4.9 billion) from 4.8
billion francs the previous year as earnings at its investment
bank fell.  Salary increases are not focused on any one division or
region, Cryan said. The bank employed 65,396 people at the end
of March.  To contact the reporters on this story:
