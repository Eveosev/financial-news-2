The Polish zloty advanced to the
strongest level in more than two months after the government
said last week it will sell euros it receives from the European
Union in the foreign exchange market.  The zloty appreciated 0.3 percent to 3.9340 per euro as of
2:25 p.m. in Warsaw, the strongest intraday level since Feb. 21.
The zloty has gained 0.9 percent since the plan was announced on
April 21, the biggest advance among more than 20 emerging-market
currencies tracked by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
