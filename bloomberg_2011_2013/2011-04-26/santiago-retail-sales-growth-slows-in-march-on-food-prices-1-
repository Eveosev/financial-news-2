Retail sales in Santiago,  Chile 
grew at a slower pace in March than in the previous two months
as food prices climbed, the country’s chamber of commerce
reported.  Retail sales in Santiago climbed 12 percent in March from a
year ago, compared with a 17 percent increase in the first two
months of the year, the chamber, known as CNC, said today in an
e-mailed statement. The price of food and nonalcoholic beverages
in Chile rose 6 percent in March from the previous year, the
National Statistics Institute said in an April 8 report.  Supermarket sales fell 6.3 percent in March from the
previous year, when consumers boosted purchases of non-
perishable items following the 8.8-magnitude earthquake on Feb.
27, 2010, the CNC said. Retail sales will climb an estimated 10
percent this year after rising 18 percent in 2010, the chamber
said.  “Consumption remains highly dynamic,” the chamber said in
the statement. “Nevertheless, it’s estimated that the pace will
moderate in the course of the year, mainly because of the high
base of comparison but also because of changes in the interest
rate.”  Chile’s central bank has increased interest rates in 10 of
its past 11 monthly meetings and will continue to remove
monetary stimulus in coming months, policy makers said in a
statement accompanying their April 12 decision.  The National Statistics Institute is scheduled to publish
Chile retail data for March on April 28.  To contact the reporter on this story:
