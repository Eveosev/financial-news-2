Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) ’s appeal of an 899
million-euro ($1.3 billion) European Union fine for failing to
comply with an antitrust ruling will be heard on May 24.  The EU General Court, the 27-nation region’s second-highest
tribunal, will hear oral arguments in the case next month,
according to the court’s online  calendar . Microsoft, the world’s
largest software maker, is seeking to overturn or cut the fine
levied by the European Commission in 2008.  Microsoft was the first company in 50 years of EU
competition policy to face a penalty for failing to comply with
an EU order. The commission in 2004 found that Microsoft
overcharged for patent licenses that rivals needed to connect
products to the  Windows operating system . The additional fine in
2008 brought the total penalty against Redmond, Washington-based
Microsoft to 1.68 billion euros.  To contact the reporter on this story:
