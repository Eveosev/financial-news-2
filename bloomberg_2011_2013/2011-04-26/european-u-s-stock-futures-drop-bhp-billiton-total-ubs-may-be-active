European stocks climbed for a
fourth day as better-than-estimated earnings from  UBS AG (UBSN) 
outweighed a report that  China  tightened capital targets for its
biggest banks.  UBS surged the most in more than two months as
 Switzerland ’s largest lender attracted the most new money from
wealthy customers since the end of 2007.  Parmalat SpA (PLT)  jumped 11
percent after Groupe Lactalis said it will bid for the rest of
 Italy ’s biggest dairy company. Basic-resource companies limited
gains as commodities snapped a four-day winning streak.  The Stoxx  Europe  600 Index rose 0.3 percent to 281.23 at
the 4:30 p.m. close in London as more than two stocks gained for
each that declined. The gauge increased 1 percent last week as
earnings from  Intel Corp . to PSA Peugeot Citroen spurred
speculation that the economic recovery is on track. The measure
has advanced 7.3 percent from this year’s low on March 16.  “There is cause for optimism as the banks gear up” to
report earnings, James Ferguson, head of strategy at Arbuthnot
Securities Ltd. in  London , said on Bloomberg Television.
Investors must “rely on trading operations of the banks which
can do quite well or quite badly. The promising thing going
forward must be mergers and acquisitions. There are lots of very
rich corporate balance sheets.”  Thirteen members of the Stoxx 600 Banks Index report
earnings this week, according to Bloomberg data, including
Credit Suisse Group AG and Barclays Plc tomorrow and Deutsche
Bank AG on April 28.  Fed Bond Purchases  The U.S. Federal Reserve begins a two-day meeting today to
decide on whether to continue with its planned $600 billion of
bond purchases through June. The central bank will leave its
target rate for overnight lending between banks at zero to 0.25
percent, according to all 82 economists surveyed by Bloomberg.  National benchmark indexes climbed in 13 of the 18 western
European markets.  Germany ’s  DAX Index (DAX)  rose 0.8 percent,  France ’s
CAC 40 Index added 0.6 percent and the U.K.’s FTSE 100 Index
gained 0.9 percent. The region’s markets were closed on April 22
and April 25 for the Easter holiday.  UBS rallied 3.9 percent to 17.23 Swiss francs, the biggest
increase since February. Wealth management and retail clients
added a net 16.7 billion francs ($19 billion) in the first
quarter, more than double the estimate of analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg. Net income was 1.81 billion francs, topping the 1.69
billion-franc forecast of analysts.  Parmalat Jumps  Parmalat surged 11 percent to 2.56 euros, the biggest gain
since it returned to the stock market in 2005 following Italy’s
biggest bankruptcy two years earlier. Lactalis offered to buy
the 71 percent of the dairy company it doesn’t already own for
2.60 euros a share.  Micro Focus International Plc (MCRO)  rallied 6.8 percent to 360.8
pence after the U.K. software company said it has received a
preliminary takeover approach.  “There are multiple possible bidders,” said Rajeev Bahl,
an analyst at London-based Matrix Corporate Capital LLC, who has
a “buy” rating on the stock. “It is a decent-quality business
that has stumbled recently.”  Possible suitors for  Micro Focus  include private equity
groups, and a buyer might have to pay as much as 450 pence a
share, Bahl said. The chance of a bid materializing is less than
50 percent, he said.  Aegon NV (AGN)  gained 3.3 percent to 5.38 euros after agreeing to
sell its Transamerica Reinsurance unit to  Scor SE (SCR) , France’s
largest reinsurer, for $912.5 million. Aegon will use the
proceeds to help pay back the remainder of the state aid it
received from the Netherlands before the end of June.  Scor advanced 2 percent to 19.80 euros, a fourth straight
increase.  Umicore (UMI) , Puma  Umicore SA gained 6.5 percent to 38.49 euros. The world’s
largest precious-metals recycler forecast 2011 earnings before
interest, taxes and special items will rise up to 24 percent to
as much as 425 million euros ($621 million).  Puma AG jumped 5.8 percent to 220.60 euros, the biggest
increase in 11 months. Europe’s second-largest sporting-goods
maker said it’s targeting revenue of 3 billion euros in 2011 as
first-quarter profit rose 7.2 percent to 77.7 million euros.  Michelin & Cie. led gains in auto-industry shares, surging
5.1 percent to 66.95 euros. The world’s second-largest tiremaker
said first-quarter revenue rose 28 percent, led by surging
demand for specialty tires to equip construction equipment and
agricultural vehicles.  Smaller rival Pirelli & C. SpA advanced 4 percent to 7.03
euros.  Mining companies fell as commodities declined, led by
silver and copper, after China was said to be tightening its
credit policy.  Anglo American Plc (AAL)  retreated 1 percent to 3,132
pence and  Randgold Resources Ltd. (RRS)  dropped 2.1 percent to 5,195
pence.  China’s banking regulator set capital targets for the five
biggest lenders above the minimum 11.5 percent ratio last month
amid concern that credit risks may rise, three people with
knowledge of the matter told Bloomberg News. The move adds to
measures policy makers in China, the largest user of copper,
have taken to curb loan growth and slow inflation.  To contact the reporter on this story:
