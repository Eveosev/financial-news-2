Bringing  Serbia ’s inflation back to
the target range of 3 percent to 6 percent later this year will
be difficult,  Tanjug  newswire reported, citing an adviser to
Prime Minister  Mirko Cvetkovic .  Keeping a lid on government-regulated prices is no longer
enough as consumer prices rose 5.5 percent already in the first
quarter and the state must take “systemic measures” to curb
food prices, the biggest source of inflation, the newswire
quoted economist Jurij Bajec as saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
