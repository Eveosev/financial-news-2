European stocks fell with commodity
prices as  China  was said to have tightened its credit policy and
as the  Federal Reserve  prepared to discuss whether to end its
bond-buying program.  The Stoxx Europe 600 Index lost 0.3 percent to 279.58 at
8:02 a.m. in  London . The gauge rallied 1 percent last week as
earnings from  Intel Corp . and Apple Inc. to PSA Peugeot Citroen
and Lâ€™Oreal SA spurred investor optimism in the global economic
recovery.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
