Ukraine’s Agriculture Ministry will
recommend the government cancel corn export quotas,
Agriculture Minister Mykola Prysyazhnyuk said.  “We have corn stockpiles of 2 million tons before the
marketing year ends” on June 30, Prysyazhnyuk said over the
weekend, according to an April 23 statement on the Agriculture
Ministry website. Removing limits for corn exports may happen
“in the near future,” he said.  Export quotas for other grains won’t be necessary after
July 1, Prysyazhnyuk said in the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
