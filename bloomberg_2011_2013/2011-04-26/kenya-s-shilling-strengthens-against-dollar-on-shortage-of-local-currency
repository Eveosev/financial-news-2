Kenya ’s shilling strengthened
against the dollar amid a shortage of the domestic currency
after the central bank drained liquidity from the market.  The currency of East Africa’s largest economy gained 0.3
percent to 83.70 per dollar as of 2:44 p.m. in Nairobi, the
capital. It closed at 83.95 on April 21. Kenyan financial
markets were closed on April 22 and April 25 for the Easter
holidays.  “The market is short of shillings,” Wilson Mutai, a trader
at African Banking Corp., said in a phone interview. “Banks are
forced to sell dollars after the central bank mopped up
shillings.”  On April 18, the central bank sold 1 billion shillings ($12
million) of eight-day  repurchase agreements , a transaction in
which it sells securities to banks to withdraw excess funds from
the financial system. The tighter liquidity in the market
resulted in interbank money market rates rising to about 5.9
percent from about 3 percent in recent weeks, said Bethuel Karanja, head of trading at CFC Stanbic Bank Holdings Ltd. in
Nairobi.  “Under normal circumstances, one would expect the shilling
to strengthen,” Karanja said. “It hasn’t responded because there
has been bit of demand from the energy sector over the past week
which has limited any gains.”  Oil importers account for as much as 60 percent of the
monthly purchase of dollars in Kenya’s foreign-exchange market,
according to Bernard Matimu, chief dealer at NIC Bank Ltd.  To contact the reporter on this story:
