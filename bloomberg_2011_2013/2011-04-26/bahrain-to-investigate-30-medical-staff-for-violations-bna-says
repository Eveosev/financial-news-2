Bahrain will investigate 30 medical
workers for possible “criminal acts and violations” committed
during pro-democracy protests, the official  Bahrain News Agency 
said.  A Health Ministry committee referred the workers to the
public prosecutor, the news service said, citing an unidentified
official at the ministry. The committee also recommended that 10
medical staff, including nine doctors, be allowed to return to
work after an investigation showed they hadn’t committed
violations, it said.  Bahraini riot police on March 16 drove protesters from
their rallying point in the capital of Manama a day after the
government declared a three-month state of emergency. Saudi
Arabia-led Gulf troops arrived in the country to provide support
as the monarchy crushed mainly Shiite demands for democracy
inspired by the toppling of leaders in Tunisia and  Egypt  earlier
this year.  More than 30 Bahraini medical workers disappeared during
the crackdown, Physicians for Human Rights said on April 22.
Salmaniya Medical Complex, where many injured Bahrainis were
brought during protests, had become a shelter for demonstrators
during the unrest. Doctors provided information on the number of
dead and wounded they treated after security forces broke up
demonstrations.  There is “hard evidence of systematic and coordinated
attacks against medical personnel because of their efforts to
provide unbiased care for wounded protesters,” the physicians
group said on April 22.  At least 21 people were killed during the crackdown,
according to the Bahrain Human Rights Society.  To contact the reporter on this story:
