Estonian electricity prices will
rise an average 6 percent for consumers from August after state-
owned utility Eesti Energia AS won approval to raise grid fees
to fund investments.  Prices will rise because the company needs to invest 300
million euros ($438 million) through 2014 to upgrade the aging
power grid and make it less vulnerable to bad weather, the
Tallinn-based company said in an e-mailed statement today. The
number of electricity outages per household will decline an
average 20 percent during the period, it added.  Electricity prices will increase an additional 0.4 percent
from June due to the annual indexation of tariffs approved by
 Estonia â€™s Competition Board in 2008, Eesti Energia said.  Increases in administratively regulated prices have led
annual price growth in Estonia since last March, even as a
period of deflation from May 2009 allowed the Baltic nation meet
the euro entry terms. Consumer prices grew an annual 5.2 percent
in March, with administratively regulated prices rising 6.3
percent and non-regulated prices growing 4.8 percent.  Average inflation will probably accelerate to 4.5 percent
this year from 2.7 percent in 2010, the  Finance Ministry 
forecast earlier this month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
