U.K. drinkers bought 60.2 million
fewer pints of beer in the first three months of 2011 as they
cut back spending in shops and supermarkets, according to an
industry group.  Beer purchases fell 3.8 percent to 5.32 million barrels
from 5.52 million a year earlier, the British Beer and Pub
Association said in an e-mailed statement. A barrel holds 164
liters of beer, or 288 pints, according to the London-based
BBPA.  Sales in the “on-trade,” or in pubs and bars, slid 3.8
percent, the same rate of decline as at supermarkets and shops,
or the “off-trade,” the BBPA said. On-trade sales declined at
a slower pace than last year’s 8.8 percent decline, whereas shop
sales fell from a 0.9 percent increase last year.  Beer sales “are still fragile,” Brigid Simmonds, the
BBPA’s chief executive officer, said in the statement. Second-
quarter sales may be helped by public holidays, including for
the wedding of  Prince William  and  Kate Middleton , and sunny
weather, the BBPA said, even as beer prices rise due to a tax
increase levied in this year’s U.K. budget.  The BBPA represents the  U.K. brewing and pub industry . Its
members account for 96 percent of the beer brewed in the country
and nearly two-thirds of Britain’s 52,500 pubs, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
