A Libyan delegation sent by the
North African country’s leader  Muammar Qaddafi  has arrived in
the South American country seeking international support for a
truce in the Libyan conflict, Venezuela’s President  Hugo Chavez 
said today on state television.  The delegation will hold talks with Chavez’s government to
see if members of the Bolivarian Alternative for the Americas, a
trade bloc spearheaded by Chavez, and other Latin America
countries can help efforts to restore peace to Libya, Foreign
Minister Nicolas Maduro said. Venezuela has been in “constant
contact” with Qaddafi’s government since the United Nations
Security Council authorized air attacks to stop Qaddafi forces
killing civilians.  “They’re seeking international support for a peaceful
exit” to the Libyan conflict, Chavez said.  Chavez, who has criticized Western intervention in the
Libyan conflict and compared Qaddafi to South American liberator
Simon Bolivar, in March proposed an international peace
commission to negotiate an end to the unrest in  Libya . His offer
was rejected by the Libyan rebels.  To contact the reporters on this story:
