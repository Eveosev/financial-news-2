Japan’s bonds rose, driving 10-year
yields to a one-month low, as falling stocks and a report
forecast to show a drop in U.S. home prices supported demand for
safer assets.  Bond futures gained to a three-week high on prospects the
 Federal Reserve  will signal tomorrow that it needs to maintain
monetary easing to support the  U.S. economy . Bonds also rose as
today’s 2.6 trillion yen ($31.8 billion) sale of two-year notes
drew stronger demand than some traders had expected.  “The Fed will have to maintain some kind of monetary
easing because recent economic data, especially housing-related
reports, haven’t been strong enough to initiate tightening,”
said Jun Fukashiro, a chief  fund manager  who helps oversee about
$16.7 billion at Toyota Asset Management Co. in  Tokyo . “Bonds
are being bought.”  The yield on the 1.3 percent bond due March 2021 fell one
basis point to 1.215 percent as of 3:01 p.m. in Tokyo at  Japan 
Bond Trading Co., the nation’s largest interdealer debt broker.
The price rose 0.088 yen to 100.749. The yield touched 1.21
percent, matching the lowest since March 25. A basis point is
0.01 percentage point.  Ten-year bond futures for June delivery rose 0.17 to 139.80
at the Tokyo Stock Exchange. The contracts reached 139.86, the
highest since March 29.  The  Nikkei 225 (NKY)  Stock Average fell 1.2 percent, and the
broader Topix index dropped 0.8 percent.  The S&P/Case-Shiller index of property values in 20 U.S.
cities fell 3.3 percent in February from a year earlier, the
biggest year-over-year decrease since November 2009, according
to the median estimate of economists surveyed by Bloomberg News.
The group releases the data today.  Fed Rate  The  Federal Open Market Committee  begins a two-day meeting
today. The Fed will leave its target rate for overnight lending
between banks at zero to 0.25 percent, according to all of the
82 economists in a Bloomberg News survey.  Bank of Japan  Governor Masaaki Shirakawa signaled yesterday
in an NHK Television interview that he may expand a 3-trillion
yen lending program aimed at bolstering growth industries as
policy makers step up efforts to rebuild after a record
earthquake on March 11.  The central bank will keep its benchmark interest rate at a
range between zero and 0.1 percent on April 28, according to all
of 13 economists surveyed by Bloomberg News.  “I expect the BOJ to add to monetary easing by July at
latest,”  Yasunari Ueno , chief market economist in Tokyo at
Mizuho Securities Co., a unit of Japan’s second-largest bank,
wrote in a research note today. “Corporate and household
sentiments are unlikely to improve soon, and downside risk for
the economy will linger.”  Earthquake Relief  Finance Minister Yoshihiko Noda today said it’s too early
to estimate the size of a second supplementary budget to finance
earthquake relief. The government last week proposed a first
extra budget worth 4-trillion yen that didn’t include new bond
issuance.  The lowest price at today’s auction was 99.980 yen, higher
than 99.975 yen median forecast by 13 traders in a Bloomberg
News survey. The auction drew bids worth 5.13 times the amount
on offer, up from a so-called bid-to-cover ratio of 4.77 times
at the March sale.  “It was a good auction,” said  Satoshi Yamada , chief
quantitative analyst in Tokyo at SMBC Nikko Securities Inc., one
the 24 primary dealers required to bid at government debt sales.
“When yields stay around 0.2 percent, investors consider the
notes relatively cheap and buy them.”  Two-year yields fell half a basis point to 0.195 percent.  Japan’s government bonds have handed investors a 0.2
percent return this month, compared with a loss of 0.4 percent
this year, according to an index compiled by Merrill Lynch & Co.  To contact the reporters on this story:
