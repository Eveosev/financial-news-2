The European Bank for
Reconstruction and Development said its capital increase of 50
percent, approved last May, became effective after more than
half of its shareholders subscribed to it.  EBRD’s capital will rise to 30 billion euros ($43.8
billion) from 20 billion euros to allow the lender to boost
annual investments up to 2015 to support recovery in Eastern
 Europe , the London-based bank said in a statement today. The
increase will allow 9 billion euros to be invested this year and
next and 8.5 billion euros in the succeeding three years. More
subscriptions are expected “shortly,” the bank said.  The former communist countries in Europe and central  Asia 
are recovering from the deepest recession since switching to
free-market policies two decades ago. The EBRD, owned by 61
countries and two intergovernmental institutions, was created in
1991 to invest in former communist countries from the Balkans to
Asia to help them transform their economies.  To contact the reporters on this story:
