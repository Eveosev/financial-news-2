The  Bank of Korea ’s six-member
board voted 5-1 in favor of boosting borrowing costs in March,
according to minutes of the meeting released today.  Bank of Korea Governor Kim Choong Soo raised  interest rates 
by a quarter of a percentage point to 3 percent on March 10 as
inflation accelerated. He told reporters that “steady increases
in interest rates are better than big moves” because they “can
help ease market concerns.”  Kang Myung Hun called for the bank to keep rates unchanged
at the March meeting, according to the minutes.  The board held interest rates unchanged at 3 percent at its
latest meeting this month. Consumer-price growth has exceeded
the Bank of  Korea ’s 4 percent ceiling since the start of the
year, prompting the central bank to raise rates by a quarter of
a percentage point each in January and March.  To contact the reporter on this story:
