Tata Teleservices Maharashtra Ltd. (TTLS) 
the listed-unit of  NTT DoCoMo Inc. (9437) ’s Indian partner, rose to its
highest in more than three months in Mumbai trading after
reporting its first annual profit in at least a decade.  Tata Teleservices rose 6.7 percent to 19.05 rupees, the
highest level since Jan. 7, at the 3:30 p.m. close of trade in
the city. The shares have dropped 1.8 percent this year.  The mobile-phone service provider in Mumbai and the western
states of Maharashtra and Goa posted the profit after gains from
selling a unit during the year ended in March, it said in a
statement today. Net income at the company excluding its
subsidiaries was 499 million rupees ($11 million) for the year,
the company’s first such annual profit since at least March
2001, according to Bloomberg data.  Consolidated annual profit was 802.3 million rupees,
compared with a loss of 3.2 billion rupees a year earlier, the
company said in the statement. Profit from the sale of unit 21st
Century Infra Tele Ltd. was 8.7 billion rupees, it said.  DoCoMo,  Japan ’s largest mobile-phone operator, completed a
250 billion yen ($3 billion) investment in closely held Tata
Teleservices Ltd. in March 2009. Last month, DoCoMo said it will
invest 14.6 billion yen in the operator as part of a rights
offering by the Indian partner.  The purchase will allow DoCoMo to maintain its 26 percent
stake in Tata Teleservices.  To contact the reporter on this story:
