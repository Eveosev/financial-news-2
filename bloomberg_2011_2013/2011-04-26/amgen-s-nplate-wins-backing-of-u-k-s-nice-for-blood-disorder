Amgen Inc. (AMGN) ’s Nplate won the backing
of the U.K. National  Institute for Health and Clinical
Excellence  in final guidelines for treating a chronic bleeding
disorder.  Nplate may be used to treat some adults whose condition
doesn’t respond to standard or rescue therapies or who have
severe disease, as long as Amgen provides a rebate, the agency
said today in a statement. The size of the rebate wasn’t
disclosed. About 3,000 to 3,500 people in the U.K. have the
disorder, known as idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura, the
agency said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
