Cement output in  Benin  may fall 44
percent this year as damaged machines and a lack of power
hinders production, Trade Minister Christine Ouinsavi said.  Output of the building material may decline to 800,000
metric tons from 1.43 million tons last year, she said in an
interview today in the southern city of Cotonou. Benin’s
government plans to boost cement imports from neighboring
countries to help meet local demand, she said, without providing
further details.  Benin, which relies on cotton for most of its export
income, is trying to boost economic growth by improving its
infrastructure to attract foreign investment. The nation’s
economy may grow 3.4 percent this year, down from an earlier
forecast of 4.4 percent, after heavy rains caused flooding,
Finance Minister Idriss Daouda said in a letter published on
International Monetary Fund’s website on Feb. 25.  Societe des Ciments du Benin, the country’s second-largest
producer, plans to repair damaged machines at its factory in an
effort to boost output, director Benoit van Castler said by
phone from Cotonou yesterday, without commenting further. The
company last year produced about 400,000 tons, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
