AT&T Inc. (T)  raised $3 billion in its
first corporate bond offering since July, as the second-largest
U.S. wireless carrier faces $3.25 billion in debt maturities
this year.  AT&T’s $1.75 billion of five-year, 2.95 percent notes yield
97 basis points more than similar-maturity Treasuries and its
$1.25 billion of 10-year, 4.45 percent notes pay a spread of 115
basis points, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  AT&T had about $59 billion in long-term debt as of Dec. 31,
2010, according to its most recent annual report, and obtained a
$20 billion bridge loan last month to back its $39 billion
acquisition of T-Mobile USA from Deutsche Telekom AG. The
company took advantage of investment-grade borrowing costs at
the lowest since November as about $5.8 billion of bonds mature
next year, and about $6 billion in 2013, Bloomberg data show.  “A company like AT&T really has a lot of maturities in any
given year,” said  Dave Novosel , an analyst at Gimme Credit LLC
in Chicago. “Right now, the  interest rates  are pretty good.”  Average yields on investment-grade corporate bonds have
declined to 3.91 percent, according to Bank of America Merrill
Lynch index data, as the  Federal Reserve  maintains its target
rate for overnight lending between banks at zero to 0.25
percent.  Debt Rankings  Dallas-based AT&T issued $2.25 billion of five-year, 2.5
percent debt in July that yielded 77 basis points more than
similar-maturity U.S. Treasuries, Bloomberg data show.  Its $1.25 billion of 5.625 percent notes due June 2016
traded at 112.2 cents on the dollar yesterday to yield 3.05
percent, or 97 basis points more than benchmarks, according to
Trace, the bond price reporting system of the Financial Industry
Regulatory Authority. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  Moody’s Investors Service ranks AT&T A2, while  Standard &
Poor’s  grades it A-, one step lower. Fitch Ratings grades the
company A.  Verizon Wireless  is the largest U.S. wireless carrier.  To contact the reporters on this story:
