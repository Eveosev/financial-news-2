the city's real estate market.  In the 15 months through March, at least 25 houses in the 
Las Vegas area changed hands for more than $3 million, with at 
least seven doing so through foreclosure or by selling at a 
loss, according to the Greater Las Vegas Association of Realtors
and Clark County property records. (Source: Bloomberg)  Running time 02:38  -0- Apr/26/2011 14:40 GMT
