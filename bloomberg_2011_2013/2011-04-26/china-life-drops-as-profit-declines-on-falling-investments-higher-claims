China Life Insurance Co., the
nation’s biggest insurer, fell by the most in more than a month
in Hong Kong trading after first-quarter profit declined 22
percent as investment yields slipped and claims surged.  The stock lost 2.9 percent, the most since March 15, to
HK$28.80 at the 12:30 p.m. local time break, after falling as
much as 3 percent. Net income dropped to 7.97 billion yuan ($1.2
billion), or 0.28 yuan a share, the Beijing-based insurer said
in a filing to the Shanghai stock exchange yesterday.  China Life’s investment income, which fell 6 percent to
17.2 billion yuan in the three months ended March 31, was
“worse than expected” as the benchmark Shanghai Composite
Index gained 4.3 percent in the period and  interest rates  rose,
said Nan Sheng, a Shanghai-based analyst at UOB Kay Hian
Investment Co. The insurer bolstered net premiums earned by 11
percent, after saying on March 22 that it may need to quicken
sales this year from a target of “more than 10 percent” to
defend its market position if rivals keep their rapid expansion.  The “lackluster” earnings “once again affirms our view
that China Life’s operating trends remain weak compared with
peers,” Citigroup Inc. analysts led by Darwin Lam said in a
report. “China Life remains our least preferred play in the
sector.”  Unrealized gains on investments were 332 million yuan,
switching from a 340 million yuan loss a year earlier, the
company said. It recorded a 1.6 billion yuan impairment charge,
compared with 13 million yuan for the same period in 2010.  Payouts surged 88 percent from a year earlier to 28 billion
yuan as more policies matured, China Life said, without
providing details. Smaller rival Ping An Insurance (Group) Co.
is scheduled to report first-quarter results tomorrow.  --Zhang Dingmin. Editors: Andreea Papuc, Linus Chua  To contact the Bloomberg News staff for this story:
