Valero Energy Corp. (VLO)  said it plans
work on units at its refineries in Corpus Christi and Three
Rivers,  Texas , during the second half of the year.  The Corpus Christi refinery complex, which has two plants,
will perform maintenance on a hydrotreater, a crude unit and a
coker in the third quarter, Lane Riggs, Valero’s senior vice
president of refining operations in  San Antonio , said during the
company’s first quarter earnings conference call.  The Three Rivers plant will perform repairs on a crude
unit, vacuum unit and a fluid catalytic cracker in the fourth
quarter, Riggs said. Three Rivers, about 70 miles (113
kilometers) south of San Antonio, is linked to the  Corpus
Christi  refineries by a 70-mile pipeline.  To contact the reporter on this story:
