UBS AG (UBSN) , Credit Agricole SA and
other lenders to GSC Group Inc. are proposing a bankruptcy
restructuring plan for the investment management firm to block a
sale.  The lender group is seeking court approval to move forward
with their plan, which would give them stock in the reorganized
company and new notes, according to a court filing yesterday
with the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Manhattan.  The lender proposal comes after U.S. Bankruptcy Judge
 Arthur Gonzalez  ordered a trustee to take over GSC, which filed
for bankruptcy last year and sought approval for a sale of its
assets to Black Diamond Capital Management.  The lenders, which opposed the Black Diamond deal, said in
a court filing that the trustee is attempting to resolve the
bankruptcy case through a sale to Black Diamond. The proposal
“would be both inequitable and cost inefficient,” the lenders
said.  James Garrity, the trustee, didn’t immediately return a
phone
call seeking comment.  The case is In re GSC Group Inc., 10-14653,  U.S. Bankruptcy
Court , Southern District of  New York  (Manhattan).  To contact the reporters on this story:
