Craig Whyte’s proposed takeover of
 Rangers Football Club Plc (RFC)  has moved closer after the London-
based Scottish financiers meeting with directors following the
club’s 0-0 draw against Celtic on April 23, the Herald said,
without saying where it got the information.  Rangers Chairman Alastair Johnston is now more likely to
support Whyte’s plan to buy owner David Murray’s 93 percent
stake, the Glasgow-based newspaper reported. Johnston said last
week that some of the directors wanted to consider an
alternative offer.  Whyte’s 52.5 million-pound offer has the support of Murray
and  Lloyds Banking Group Plc (LLOY) , the club’s major creditor, the
newspaper said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
