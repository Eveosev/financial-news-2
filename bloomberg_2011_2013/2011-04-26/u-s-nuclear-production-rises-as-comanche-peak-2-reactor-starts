U.S. nuclear-power output increased
from 4½-year lows as Energy Future Holdings Corp. started the
Comanche Peak 2 reactor in  Texas , the Nuclear Regulatory
Commission said.  Power generation nationwide increased 857 megawatts from
yesterday to 72,898 megawatts, or 72 percent of capacity,
according to an NRC report today and data compiled by Bloomberg.
Twenty-six of the nation’s 104 reactors were offline.  Energy Future is operating the 1,150-megawatt Comanche Peak
2 at 1 percent of capacity. The 1,200-megawatt Comanche Peak
Unit 1 is producing at full power.  The Comanche Peak plant is located 66 miles (106
kilometers) southwest of Dallas.  Southern Co. (SO)  boosted the 1,109-megawatt Vogtle 1 reactor in
Georgia to full power from 30 percent of capacity yesterday
after it automatically tripped offline April 20. The cause is
under investigation, the NRC said April 21.  The 1,127-megawatt Vogtle 2 is operating at full capacity.
The plant is 26 miles southeast of Augusta.  Exelon Corp. (EXC)  increased output from the 1,164-megawatt  Byron
1 reactor  in Illinois to 65 percent of capacity from 40 percent
yesterday after a refueling outage. Another unit at the site,
the 1,136-megawatt Byron 2, is operating at full power. The
plant is located 85 miles west of Chicago.  Limerick 2  Exelon boosted the 1,134-megawatt Limerick 2 reactor in
Pennsylvania to 97 percent of capacity from 34 percent yesterday
after returning from a refueling and maintenance outage.  Another reactor at the site, the 1,134-megawatt Limerick 1,
is operating at full capacity. The plant is about 30 miles
northwest of Philadelphia.  Progress Energy Inc. (PGN)  boosted the 937-megawatt Brunswick 2
unit in  North Carolina  to 99 percent of capacity from 89 percent
yesterday. The 938-megawatt Brunswick 1 is operating at full
power at the Cape Fear site 130 miles south of Raleigh.  Constellation Nuclear Energy Group LLC, a joint venture of
 Constellation Energy Group Inc. (CEG)  and Electricite de France SA,
slowed the 621-megawatt Nine Mile Point Unit 1 in  New York  to 78
percent of capacity from full power yesterday.  Another unit at the site, the 1,140-megawatt Unit 2, is
operating at full power. The plant is located about 6 miles
northeast of Oswego.  Vermont  Yankee  Entergy Corp. (ETR)  lowered output from the 620-megawatt Vermont
Yankee reactor to 76 percent of capacity from full power
yesterday. The plant is located in Vernon, in the southeast
corner of Vermont, 80 miles northwest of  Boston .  Entergy slowed both units at the Arkansas Nuclear One
plant. The 843-megawatt Unit 1 reduced output to 42 percent of
capacity and the 995-megawatt Unit 2 dropped to 78 percent of
capacity. Each unit was operating at full power yesterday at the
plant located 65 miles northwest of Little Rock.  Xcel Energy Inc. (XEL)  slowed the 551-megawatt Prairie Island 1
reactor in Minnesota to 96 percent of capacity from full power
yesterday. The 545-megawatt Prairie Island 2, another reactor at
the site about 40 miles southeast of Minneapolis, is operating
at full power.  Some reactors close for maintenance and refueling during
the spring and fall in the U.S., when demand for heating and
cooling is lower. The outages can increase consumption of
natural gas and coal to generate electricity.  The average U.S. reactor  refueling outage  lasted 41 days in
2009, according to the Nuclear Energy Institute.  To contact the reporter on this story:
