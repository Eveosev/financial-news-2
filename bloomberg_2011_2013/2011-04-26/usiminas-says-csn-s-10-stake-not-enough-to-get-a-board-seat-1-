Usinas Siderurgicas de Minas Gerais
SA (USIM5) ,  Brazil ’s second-biggest steelmaker, said rival Cia.
Siderurgica Nacional SA is unlikely to secure a seat on its
board after boosting its stake in the company to 10 percent.  Usiminas’s board will decide on the mandate of its
directors at a meeting next year, Chief Executive Officer Wilson
Brumer said today at an event in Rio de Janeiro. When asked if
the voting stake held by CSN, as the rival is known, was enough
to allow it to name a member, Brumer replied "in our view, no."  Rio de Janeiro-based CSN, Brazil’s third-largest steelmaker
is known, said last week it boosted its stake in  Belo Horizonte ,
Brazil-based Usiminas to 10.01 percent of common shares and 5.25
percent of preferred shares. The company, which isn’t in talks
with Usiminas, is buying shares at market prices, CSN Chief
Financial Officer Paulo Penido said March 29.  Usiminas’s common shares on March 23 rose to their highest
since April 2010 amid speculation that Gerdau SA, the nation’s
top steelmaker, may buy part of its rival. Brumer declined to
comment on the speculation today, adding that Usiminas’s
controlling shareholders, which include Nippon Steel Corp.,
Votorantim Participacoes SA and Camargo Correa SA, are "long-
term" investors.  Usiminas’s preferred shares, the most-traded class of
stock, rose 12 centavos, or 0.7 percent, to 17.57 reais in Sao
Paulo trading at 1:46 p.m. New York time. CSN gained 0.3 percent
to 24.68 reais.  To contact the reporter on this story:
