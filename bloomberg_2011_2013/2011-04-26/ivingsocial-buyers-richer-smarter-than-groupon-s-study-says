People who buy online coupons from
LivingSocial are richer, younger and smarter than customers of
market leader Groupon Inc., according to a study by Nielsen Co.  LivingSocial users are 49 percent more likely than the
average American online to make at least $150,000 a year,
compared with 30 percent for Groupon, according to the  survey 
released today. They are also more likely to be younger than 35
and to have college or graduate degrees.  The sites, which offer discounts of as much as 90 percent
off at local businesses, are racing to dominate a market worth
billions. LivingSocial, the second-largest coupon site, raised
$400 million in its quest to overtake No. 1 Groupon, according
to two people with knowledge of the financing. Groupon is
preparing for an initial public offering that could value the
company at as much as $25 billion, according to a person
familiar with that process.  Groupon’s customers are older, with 57 percent aged 35 to
64, compared with 51 percent for  LivingSocial , a third of whose
buyers are in the 21-to-34 age range, the study said. The study
found 46 percent of LivingSocial’s clientele had attended or
graduated college or received other degrees, compared with 39
percent for Groupon.  Nielsen, based in  New York , also found that about two-
thirds of LivingSocial and Groupon users are women.  The survey results come from a panel of 200,000  Internet
users  that Nielsen tracks for Web activity. Another survey of
36,000 Internet users aged 18 and older indicate that deals on
gardening services and products have the most appeal, with 47
percent of participants interested in the category. Coupons for
home repairs and religious involvement were the second and third
most attractive, Nielsen said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
