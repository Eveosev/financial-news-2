Rogers Communications Inc. (RCI/B) ,
 Canada ’s largest wireless carrier, reported first-quarter profit
that beat analysts’ estimates as price cuts helped it add
subscribers and fend off competition from new carriers.  Profit excluding some items was 76 Canadian cents (80 U.S.
cents) a share, Toronto-based Rogers said today in a statement.
Analysts predicted 73 Canadian cents, the average of estimates
compiled by Bloomberg. Sales rose 3.9 percent to C$2.99 billion,
compared with the average analyst estimate of C$3.01 billion.  Rogers is investing in its low-cost wireless business to
ward off new carriers Public Mobile, Wind Mobile and Mobilicity,
which are trying to chip away at the dominance of Rogers and the
other incumbent carriers  BCE Inc. (BCE)  and  Telus Corp. (T)  Rogers is
likely to face the stiffest challenge among the three from the
new entrants, says  Maher Yaghi , an analyst at Desjardins
Securities in Montreal.  “Rogers will continue to face headwinds from the intensely
competitive wireless pricing environment,” said Yaghi, who
rates Rogers “hold.”  The carrier added 45,000 net new wireless subscribers on
contract last quarter. Yaghi predicted Rogers would lose 19,000
customers. Rogers’s average wireless monthly bill for all users
fell to C$59.91, missing the C$60.80 estimate by Yaghi.  Rogers’s net income declined to C$335 million, or 60 cents
a share, from C$368 million, or 62 cents, a year earlier.  Rogers rose 39 cents to C$34.74 at 4 p.m. in Toronto Stock
Exchange trading. The shares are little changed this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
