A 6.6 percent rise in global steel
production is insufficient to raise rates to hire ships to carry
the raw materials for the metal,  Arctic Securities ASA  said.  Globally 129 million metric tons of steel were produced in
March, according to data from the World Steel Association.
That’s up from 121 million tons in March 2010. Rates to hire
capesize vessels that carry the iron ore and coking coal to make
steel have plunged 76 percent in the past 12 months as the fleet
grew.  The high steel figure shows a continued ramp up in global
production excluding  China , Erik Nikolai Stavseth, an Oslo-based
analyst at Arctic, said in an e-mailed report today.  “We view this as a positive sign of increased demand for
steel-making materials, but based on current freight rates the
demand is not anywhere near high enough to support the influx of
tonnage,” Stavseth said.  The carrying capacity of the capesize fleet will grow 16
percent this year,  Clarkson Plc , the world’s largest shipbroker,
estimates. That’s more than a 7 percent increase in demand for
 iron ore  and a 5 percent rise in demand for coking coal,
Clarkson forecasts.  Companies ordered too many ships in 2007 and 2008, when the
Baltic Dry Index, a broader measure of commodity-shipping costs,
averaged 6,730 points. The average then plunged 60 percent over
the next two years.  To contact the reporter on this story:
