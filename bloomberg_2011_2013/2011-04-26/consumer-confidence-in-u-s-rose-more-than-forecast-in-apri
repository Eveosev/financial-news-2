Confidence among U.S. consumers
increased more than forecast in April, signaling the improving
labor market is helping Americans weather rising fuel costs.  The Conference Board’s confidence index rose to 65.4 from a
revised 63.8 reading in March, figures from the New York-based
private research group showed today. The median forecast of
economists surveyed by Bloomberg News called projected an
advance to 64.5.  Six straight months of job growth along with joblessness at
a two-year low in March are helping sustain consumer purchases,
which account for about 70 percent of the economy. At the same
time, bigger gains in sentiment may be difficult as households
spend more for food and gasoline, which is at the highest level
in almost three years.  “Confidence is picking up on the back of an improving
labor market and rising stock prices, which are offsetting
higher gasoline costs,” said  Sal Guatieri , a senior economist
at BMO Capital Markets Inc. in Toronto. “Consumers will have
both the confidence and the income to keep spending.”  Stocks held earlier gains after the report on optimism over
improving corporate earnings. The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index
rose 0.4 percent to 1,340.8 at 10:17 a.m. in  New York .  Treasury
securities  rose, sending the yield on the benchmark 10-year note
down to 3.34 percent from 3.37 percent late yesterday.  Home Prices  Another report today showed residential real estate prices
dropped in February by the most in more than a year, a sign the
housing market is struggling to stabilize.  The S&P/Case-Shiller index of property values in 20 cities
fell 3.3 percent from February 2010, the biggest year-over-year
decrease since November 2009.  Estimates for  consumer confidence  ranged from 57 to 68 in
the Bloomberg survey of 69 economists. The measure averaged 97
during the expansion that ended in December 2007.  The group’s measure of present conditions increased to
39.6, the highest since November 2008, from 37.5 a month
earlier. The gauge of expectations for the next six months rose
to 82.6 from 81.3.  The share of consumers who said jobs are currently
plentiful rose to 5.2 percent from 4.6 percent. Those who said
jobs are hard to get decreased to 41.8 percent, the fewest since
January 2009, from 44.4 percent.  Jobs Outlook  The outlook was less rosy. The percent of respondents
expecting more jobs to become available in the next six months
decreased to 17.5 from 19.6 the previous month. The share
expecting incomes to rise over the next six months improved to
16.7 percent from 15.2 percent.  The report contained one positive bit of news for the
housing market, which has lagged behind other parts of the
economy since the recession ended in June 2009. The share of
Americans planning to buy a house over the next six months
increased to 5.5 percent, matching the record high reached in
January 1978. Data go back to 1964.  Intentions to purchase automobiles and appliances also
improved.  Fuel costs may be preventing bigger gains in confidence.
The average price of regular fuel climbed to $3.87 a gallon
yesterday, the highest level since August 2008, according to
AAA, the nation’s biggest motoring organization.  Confidence ‘Fragile’  “The economic climate is still less than ideal, from a
slow and uneven recovery to significantly rising commodity costs
and fragile consumer confidence,”  Jim Skinner , chief executive
officer of  McDonald’s Corp. (MCD) , said on a conference call with
analysts on April 21.  Oak Brook , Illinois-based McDonald’s, the world’s biggest
restaurant chain, reported an 11 percent jump in first-quarter
profit, fueled by U.S. demand for coffee and burgers, and
predicted further increases in food costs this year.  Today’s report was foreshadowed by other figures. The
Bloomberg Consumer Comfort Index climbed in the week ended April
17 to the best level since the end of February, posting the
fourth consecutive gain. The Thomson Reuters/University of
Michigan preliminary index of consumer sentiment rose more than
forecast in April, after a March reading that was the lowest
since November 2009.  The economy created 216,000 jobs last month, the most since
May, and the jobless rate fell to a two-year low of 8.8 percent.
Data from the Labor Department due on May 6 may show payrolls
climbed again this month, according to the median forecast in a
Bloomberg survey.  To contact the reporter on this story:
