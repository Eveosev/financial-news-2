SuccessFactors Inc. (SFSF)  said it agreed
to buy closely held Plateau Systems Ltd., a provider of Web-
based software tools for businesses, for $290 million.  The company will pay $145 million in cash and $145 million
in stock, Dmitri Krakovsky, vice president of global  product
management , said in an interview today.  With the acquisition, SuccessFactors adds large customers
served by Plateau, including  General Electric Co. (GE)  and the
National Aeronautics and Space Administration. SuccessFactors, a
 San Mateo , California-based maker of software used to manage
employee performance, said that the combined companies would
have more than 15 million users in 4,000 businesses.  “Over the last few months, we looked at most of the
players in learning management and evaluated a whole bunch of
deals,” said Krakovsky. “Ultimately we decided to go for a
company that was higher-priced but one of the best companies in
the space.”  SuccessFactors slipped as low as $36.90 in extended trading
following the announcement. The shares had risen 28 cents to
$40.27 at 4 p.m. New York time in Nasdaq Stock Market trading.
The stock has climbed 39 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
