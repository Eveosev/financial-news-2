United Parcel Service Inc. (UPS) ’s next-
day package shipments rose in the first quarter as business
customers refilled stockpiles to meet higher demand from the
recovering economy, Chief Financial Officer Kurt Kuehn said.  Boxes shipped using the UPS’s Next Day Air service climbed
in the “mid-single digits” as companies sought to restock
goods faster after adapting to leaner inventory during the
recession, Kuehn said in a telephone interview.  The gains reflect “some of the increased velocity in the
core economy with manufacturing and finished goods,” Kuehn
said. Businesses and retailers “are still cautious so they’ve
kept inventories low. That means as demand shifts, then
frequently customers do use the more premium services to cover
gaps and shortages across their various supply chains.”  UPS, the world’s biggest package-delivery company,
bolstered its full-year forecast after revenue per package
climbed in all its sectors, led by a 7.2 percent jump to $13.13
in deferred U.S. domestic shipments. The Atlanta-based company
and  FedEx Corp. (FDX)  handle goods ranging from financial documents to
pharmaceuticals and industrial parts, making them economic
bellwethers.  Profit in 2011 will be $4.15 to $4.40 a share, compared
with a February projection of $4.12 to $4.35, UPS said in a
statement. The average estimate from 26 analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg was $4.25 a share.  Kuehn said next-day letter delivery volumes declined
slightly in the quarter, partially offsetting the gains in box
shipments.  Net income rose 66 percent to $885 million, or 88 cents a
share, from $533 million, or 53 cents, a year earlier, UPS said.
That topped the 84-cent average estimate of 24 analysts in a
Bloomberg survey.  Revenue jumped 7.3 percent to $12.6 billion, trailing
estimates of $12.7 billion.  UPS rose 66 cents to $74.30 at 4:15 p.m. in New York Stock
Exchange composite trading. The shares have gained 2.4 percent
this year.  To contact the reporters on this story:
