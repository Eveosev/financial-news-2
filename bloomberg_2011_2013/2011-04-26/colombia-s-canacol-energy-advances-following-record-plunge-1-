Canacol Energy Ltd. (CNE) , the Calgary-
based  oil company  that operates fields in  South America , rose
the most in five months in Bogota trading as investors bet that
yesterday’s record 18 percent plunge was overdone.  Shares rose 5.8 percent to 2,175 pesos at 4 p.m. New York
time, the biggest intraday gain since Nov. 24. Yesterday’s
decline came after Canacol said it is abandoning an exploratory
well in Guyana that isn’t fit for beginning production.  The selloff was “surely overdone especially given that the
company is looking to drill elsewhere in Guyana,”  Rupert Stebbings , managing director of international sales at Celfin
Colombia SAS, wrote in a note to clients today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
