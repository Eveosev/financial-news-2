Celanese Corp. (CE) , the world’s biggest
maker of acetate tow, said it may continue operating a Spondon,
England, plant that was scheduled to close this year because
customers are concerned that supply of the chemical will be
curtailed by the disaster in  Japan .  Last month’s earthquake and tsunami in Japan reduced
competitors’ production of acetate, used to make cigarette
filters, and customers are worried supplies will be limited,
Chief Executive Officer David Weidman said in a telephone
interview today. The Dallas-based company is considering options
to help reassure customers about availability, he said.  “One of those options is to keep Spondon open for at least
a period of time,” Weidman said.  Closing the plant would save $40 million to $60 million a
year, Celanese said in May 2010. Celanese would still meet its
2013 earnings forecast for the consumer specialties unit, which
makes acetate, with sales from the Spondon plant making up for
less cost savings, Weidman said.  Celanese took a  $72 million  asset impairment loss related
to the plant closure in July and said in August that future
costs to close the plant may be as much as  $45 million .  To contact the reporter on this story:
