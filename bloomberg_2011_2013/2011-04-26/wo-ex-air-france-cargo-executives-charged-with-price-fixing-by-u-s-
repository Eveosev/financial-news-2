Two former Societe Air  France  cargo
executives were charged with conspiring to fix international
freight shipment prices, the U.S.  Justice Department  said.  Ex-vice presidents Marc Boudier and Jean Charles Foucault
face a single charge each of conspiracy to restrain trade in
violation of the Sherman Antitrust Act, a crime punishable by as
much as 10 years’ imprisonment and a fine of as much as
$1 million, prosecutors said today in  a statement . The men were
indicted by a federal grand jury in  Chicago , the government
said.  “Boudier and Foucault carried out a conspiracy by fixing
and coordinating rates on air cargo shipments to certain U.S.
locations and elsewhere,” from August 2004 to February 2006,
the Justice Department said.  The indictments are the most recent in a U.S. government
probe that has involved charges against 21 airlines and 21
executives.  Societe Air France, based in Roissy, France, is a unit of
Paris-based  Air France-KLM. (AF)   Attorney information wasn’t immediately available for
Boudier, a former executive vice president of Air France Cargo,
and Foucault, formerly vice president for sales and marketing of
Air France Cargo.  The case is U.S. v. Boudier, U.S. District Court, District
of Northern Illinois (Chicago).  To contact the reporter on this story:
