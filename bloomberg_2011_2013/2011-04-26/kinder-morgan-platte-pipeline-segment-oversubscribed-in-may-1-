Kinder Morgan Canadaâ€™s crude oil
Platte pipeline system is oversubscribed between Guernsey,
 Wyoming , and Wood River,  Illinois , for May shipments, the
company said in a statement.  The new shipper category was apportioned by 48 percent on
the segment, which will be 162,000 barrels a day, the company
said.  New shippers get 10 percent of the space on the line, said
Darren Dillabaugh, a Kinder Morgan Canada spokesman.  The Platte system runs to Wood River from Casper, Wyoming,
where it connects with the Express pipeline system that brings
Canadian crude from Hardisty, Alberta.  To contact the reporter on this story:
