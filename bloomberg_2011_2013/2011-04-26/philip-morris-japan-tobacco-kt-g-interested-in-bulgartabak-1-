Philip Morris International Inc. (PM) 
and Japan Tobacco Inc. are among potential buyers of  Bulgartabak
Holding (57B) , Bulgaria’s state tobacco company, Privatization Agency
chief Emil Karanikolov said.  South Korean tobacco producer  KT&G Corp. (033780)  and four
international financial firms have also shown interest in a
79.83 percent stake in Bulgartabak, Karanikolov told reporters
in Sofia today. The asset-selling agency has set May 10 to Aug.
28 as the bidding period, he said.  “There are many political and economic considerations to
be taken into account, which have made previous sell-off efforts
difficult,” Karanikolov said. “We’ve made the offer attractive
and I think there will be more candidates.”  It is the fourth attempt to sell the company in a decade
and bids will be evaluated according to six criteria. Apart from
price and investment plans, these focus on short- and long-term
commitments to buy locally grown tobacco, Karanikolov said.
 Bulgaria  picked Citigroup Global Markets Inc. to advise on the
sale and has been in communication with the potential
candidates.  Bulgartabak has six units, including four cigarette makers
and a trading division. In the past three years, it’s sold four
of its factories in auctions on the Bulgarian Stock Exchange.  To contact the reporter on this story:
