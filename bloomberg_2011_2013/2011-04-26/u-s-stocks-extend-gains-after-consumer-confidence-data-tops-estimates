U.S. stocks extended gains after a
gauge of  consumer confidence  exceeded economists’ forecasts,
building on an earlier rally triggered by higher-than-estimated
earnings.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index rose 0.5 percent to
1,341.54 at 10:03 a.m. in  New York . The  Dow Jones Industrial
Average  advanced 52.07 points, or 0.4 percent, to 12,531.95 .  The Conference Board’s confidence index rose to 65.4 from a
revised 63.8 reading in March, figures from the New York-based
private research group showed today. The median forecast of
economists surveyed by Bloomberg News called projected an
advance to 64.5.  The S&P 500 rose 6.2 percent in 2011 through yesterday,
extending last year’s 13 percent rally, amid government stimulus
measures and higher-than-estimated corporate profits. Earnings-
per-share beat estimates at 79 percent of the 153 companies in
the  S&P 500  that reported results since April 11, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  Federal Reserve policy makers are holding two days of
meetings beginning today, and will likely say they’ll complete a
second round of scheduled bond purchases worth $600 billion
through the end of June to help sustain the recovery. While
companies including General Electric Co. and Apple Inc. are
among those benefiting from gains in spending on equipment and
software, households are feeling the pinch of higher food and
fuel prices.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
