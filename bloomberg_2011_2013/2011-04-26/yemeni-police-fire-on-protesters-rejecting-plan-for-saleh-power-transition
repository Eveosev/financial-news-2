Yemeni police fired on protesters
in the cities of Taiz and Hodiedah today as thousands
demonstrated against a plan backed by Gulf Arab countries to
offer President Ali Abdullah Saleh immunity, organizers said.  In Taiz, at least one protester was killed and five injured
when police opened fire, said Bushra al-Maktari, an opposition
activist, in a phone interview. In the port city of Hodiedah, at
least eight were injured in a similar attack, said Abdulhaiz
Majaab, a political activist.  The demonstrators are targeting a plan brokered by the Gulf
Cooperation Council, accepted by Saleh and the main opposition
movement and announced last week. It calls for the president to
cede power in a month’s time and be granted immunity from
prosecution. He would be the third Middle Eastern leader forced
from office by popular protest movements this year, after
 Egypt ’s  Hosni Mubarak  and  Tunisia ’s Zine El Abidine Ben Ali.  Leaders from the opposition and ruling party will sign the
accord in  Saudi Arabia  early next week, Mohammed Basendwah, head
of the Preparatory Committee for National Dialogue, said in a
telephone interview from Sana’a.  Saleh yesterday defied calls for his immediate resignation,
saying he won’t hand power to “insurrectionists.” In March, he
agreed to an opposition proposal to hand over power by the end
of the year, then backtracked by saying he’d stand down only
after a newly elected government was formed and power was
transferred to safe hands.
