U.S. Representative  Ron Paul  of
Texas announced today in Iowa that he is forming an exploratory
committee for a third presidential campaign.  Paul, a longshot 2008 Republican presidential candidate
whose anti-tax, anti-government politics struck a chord with a
swath of voters and fueled fundraising, will make a decision on
whether to run by the middle of next month, said Jesse Benton,
his political director.  “There’s a lot of enthusiasm,” Benton said. Paul plans to
participate in a Republican primary debate May 5 in  South
Carolina .  Before his 2008 bid, Paul ran for president in 1988 on the
Libertarian Party ticket.  Paul, who heads the House Financial Services subcommittee
that oversees the  Federal Reserve  and wrote a 2009 book “End
the Fed,” has long pushed for legislation to increase scrutiny
of the central bank. He joined with his son, Rand, who was
elected as a Republican senator from  Kentucky  in November, to
introduce legislation this year to require an audit of the Fed
by the Government Accountability Office.  Paul’s Fed-audit bill passed the House last year as part of
the broader overhaul of financial regulation before being
rejected by the Senate.  Yesterday, Mississippi Governor Haley Barbour, who had been
making campaign-style appearances in states crucial to the
presidential-selection process, announced that he wouldn’t seek
the White House in 2012.  To contact the reporter on this story:
