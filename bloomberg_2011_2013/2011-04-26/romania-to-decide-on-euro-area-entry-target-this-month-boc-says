The Romanian government will decide
by the end of the month on the country’s schedule to join the
euro region after discussions with the president and the central
bank, Prime Minister Emil Boc said.  “We will make a decision regarding the adoption of the
euro by the end of April,” Boc told reporters in Bucharest
today. “The convergence program is not final and will be
discussed by the government and sent to the European
Commission.”  The Eastern European country, which planned to join the
euro region in 2015, will probably delay the target as it
struggles to get the economy to rebound after a two-year
recession, President Traian Basescu and central bank Governor
Mugur Isarescu have said.  To adopt the euro, applicants must keep their 12-month
average inflation rate within 1.5 percentage points of the
average of the three European Union countries with the slowest
price growth and show that it is sustainable. Other requirements
include keeping budget deficits below 3 percent of gross
domestic product, holding government debt to within 60 percent
of GDP, keeping currencies stable and aligning interest rates
with the euro region.  To contact the reporter on this story:
