HSBC Holdings Plc (HSBA) ,  Europe ’s biggest
bank by market value, started the second part of a $200 million
fund to help local Emirati companies in the United Arab Emirates
boost trade.  Worth $100 million, it follows the creation of a fund in
January last year, Nick Levitt, head of HSBC’s U.A.E. commercial
bank, said in an interview today. About 42 percent of the money
from the first fund was for companies in Dubai, according to the
bank. About 24 percent of the companies used the money to
supplement working capital, while 10 percent used it to apply
for term loans.  “It was an extremely strong message we sent to the segment
to say ‘we’re here, we’re lending’ when a lot of banks
weren’t,” Levitt said in  Abu Dhabi . “All arrows since then
pointed to the direction of ‘why don’t we do more of this?’”  The bank expects its 2011 balance sheet in the U.A.E. to
grow at a rate equal to or greater than the 19 percent growth
seen in 2010, Levitt said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
