Attorney General Eric Holder
defended a former Bush administration lawyer who was hired by
Republicans in the U.S. House to argue for the constitutionality
of the Defense of Marriage Act.  Paul D. Clement, who served as U.S. solicitor general under
President  George W. Bush , was “doing that which lawyers do” in
agreeing to defend the law, Holder said today at a news
conference in Washington. The measure bars same-sex married
couples from collecting federal benefits when eligibility is
determined by marital status.  Clement announced his resignation yesterday as head of
Atlanta-based King & Spalding LLP’s national appellate practice
after the firm withdrew as counsel for the U.S. House of
Representatives.  House Speaker  John Boehner  said last month that Republicans
would defend the 1996 Defense of Marriage Act after the Obama
administration said it won’t defend the constitutionality of the
law. The move to hire King & Spalding sparked criticism from the
gay and lesbian community.  Holder said criticism of Clement for representing the House
was “very misplaced.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
