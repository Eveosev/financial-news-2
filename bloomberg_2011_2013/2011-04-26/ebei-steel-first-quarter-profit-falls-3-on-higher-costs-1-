Hebei Iron & Steel Co., the listed
unit of  China ’s biggest steelmaker, said first-quarter profit
fell 3 percent on higher costs.  Net income declined to 392 million yuan ($60 million), from
405 million yuan a year ago, the Shijiazhuang, Hebei province-
based company said today in a statement to the Shenzhen stock
exchange. Earnings per share were unchanged at 0.06 yuan. Sales
rose 17 percent to 32.3 billion yuan.  Competition and high raw material costs depressed profit
margins for China’s key steelmakers to only 3 percent in the
first quarter, the government said April 14. Spot prices for 62-
percent iron ore arriving in Tianjin gained 5.2 percent this
year to $178.90 as of April 21, according to the Steel Index.
Higher shipping and iron-ore costs squeezed profits, Hebei Steel
chairman Wang Yifang said on March 6.  Operating costs at the steelmaker rose 17 percent to 30.1
billion yuan in the quarter, it said in the statement.  Hebei Steel fell 0.9 percent to close at 4.67 yuan in
Shenzhen today, before the earnings announcement. The benchmark
Shanghai Composite Index fell 0.9 percent.  Rising iron ore prices are “not sustainable”,  Xu Lejiang ,
chairman of rival steelmaker Baosteel Group Corp. said today in
Beijing. Xu said cost increases are putting margins of Chinese
steelmakers under pressure.  Hebei Steel’s 2010 profit rose 49 percent to 1.41 billion
yuan after acquisitions boosted production. The company merged
with sister companies Handan Iron & Steel Co. and Chengde Xinxin
Vanadium & Titanium Co. in 2009 as part of restructuring by
parent Hebei Iron & Steel Group.  --Helen Yuan, Liza Lin. Editors: Alan Soughley, Josh Fellman  To contact the Bloomberg News staff on this story
