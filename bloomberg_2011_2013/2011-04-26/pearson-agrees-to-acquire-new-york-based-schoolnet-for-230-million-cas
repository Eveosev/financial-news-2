Pearson Plc (PSON) , the owner of the
 Financial Times  newspaper, said it agreed to buy education-
technology company Schoolnet for $230 million in cash.  Schoolnet, which uses data to boost learning at schools, is
based in  New York  and serves more than 5 million students from
pre-kindergarten age through to 12th grade in the U.S., Pearson
said today. Through partnerships with districts and states,
Schoolnet covers a third of the country’s largest cities.  Pearson, which also owns the book publisher Penguin,
received about 80 percent of its earnings from education in 2010
and has been expanding through so-called bolt-on acquisitions
with proceeds from last year’s sale of Interactive Data Corp. in
the U.S. for $3.4 billion. Pearson, based in London, has made
nine acquisitions or offers for education companies in the past
12 months in countries including the U.K., India,  South Africa 
and the U.S.  The Schoolnet acquisition will be “broadly neutral to
earnings per share” for Pearson this year and add to adjusted
earnings per share and return on invested capital in 2012, the
company said.  Pearson shares rose as much as 1.6 percent to 1,149 pence
in London trading and were up 1.3 percent as of 9:49 a.m.  Government Support  The U.S. administration supports data systems that improve
preparedness for college and has allocated some $17 billion to
districts and states to support school improvement, Pearson
said.  Pearson said in February that 2010 profit rose 21 percent
as the company benefited from investments in emerging markets
and digital operations. Digital revenue accounted for 29 percent
of the company’s sales, and emerging markets made up 10 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
