Stocks surged, sending the Standard
& Poor’s 500 Index to its highest level since June 2008, as
earnings at companies from  Ford Motor Co. (F)  to 3M Co. beat analyst
estimates. Treasuries rose and the dollar fell versus the euro
for a sixth day as a  Federal Reserve  policy meeting began.  The S&P 500 increased 0.9 percent to 1,347.24 at 4 p.m. in
 New York  and the Stoxx Europe 600 Index gained 0.3 percent. The
dollar matched the longest losing streak versus the euro in
almost two years amid speculation the Fed will consider measures
to keep  interest rates  low. Ten-year Treasury yields slid five
basis points to 3.32 percent, the lowest level in a month. Oil
was little changed at $112.21 a barrel and gold and silver fell.  Before today, the S&P 500 had failed to top its 2011 high
reached on Feb. 18 even as it closed less than 1 percent below
the peak on eight days in April. Stocks rallied today as Ford,
3M and  United Parcel Service Inc. (UPS)  joined the 79 percent of S&P
500 companies that have topped analyst earnings estimates since
April 11. Investors also awaited the end of a Fed meeting
tomorrow to gauge the central bank’s outlook for interest rates
and its economic stimulus program known as quantitative easing.  “Corporate performance is excellent,” said Stephen Wood,
the New York-based chief market strategist for Russell
Investments, which manages about $155 billion. “The underlying
economic performance in the  United States  has been a pleasant
surprise. Our expectation is that the Fed ends QE2 in the summer
and the growth baton will be handed from policy to the private
economy. That’s providing rationale for the stock market to move
forward.”  Dollar Index,  S&P 500   The Dollar Index, used to track the U.S. currency against
six trading partners, fell 0.3 percent to 73.779, the lowest
since August 2008 on a closing basis, on speculation the Fed
will signal plans to keep interest rates near zero for an
extended period. Twelve of 16 major peers rose against the U.S.
currency, with the euro strengthening 0.4 percent to $1.4642.  The S&P 500 rose for the fourth time in five days, erasing
yesterday’s decline. Industrial companies rose 1.8 percent as a
group to lead gains among all 10 of the index’s main industries.
Ford, the second-largest U.S. carmaker, climbed 2.4 percent
after first-quarter profit grew 22 percent to the most in the
period since 1998 amid higher prices for fuel-efficient models.  3M Co. (MMM)  said it had first-quarter profit of $1.49 a share,
topping the average analyst estimate of $1.44 a share. The stock
rose 1.9 percent. UPS, the world’s largest package-delivery
company, climbed 0.9 percent after also boosting its full-year
forecast amid increasing demand for international shipping.  Improving Confidence  Stocks extended gains after confidence among U.S. consumers
increased more than forecast in April, signaling the improving
labor market is helping Americans weather rising fuel costs. The
Conference Board’s confidence index rose to 65.4 from a revised
63.8 reading in March. The median forecast of economists
surveyed by Bloomberg News projected an advance to 64.5.  Treasury two-year note yields lost three basis points to
0.61 percent, the lowest level in more than a month, even after
the U.S. sold $35 billion of the securities at a higher-than-
forecast yield. The notes drew a yield of 0.673 percent,
compared with a forecast of 0.669 percent in a Bloomberg News
survey of 8 of the Federal Reserve’s 20 primary dealers. The
bid-to-cover ratio, which gauges demand by comparing total bids
with amount of securities offered, was 3.06, below the 3.42
average at the past 10 sales.  Five stocks climbed for every two that fell in the Stoxx
Europe 600.  UBS AG (UBSN) , Switzerland’s largest bank, rallied 3.9
percent after attracting the highest wealth management inflows
since the end of 2007 in the first quarter.  Parmalat SpA (PLT)  jumped
11 percent after Groupe Lactalis bid for holdings in  Italy ’s
biggest dairy company it doesn’t already own.  China  Slumps  The MSCI Emerging Markets Index was little changed after
China’s Shanghai Composite Index slid 0.9 percent. Industrial &
Commercial Bank of China Ltd. lost 0.3 percent in  Hong Kong 
after the world’s largest lender by market value and three
rivals were told last month to maintain capital adequacy ratios
of at least 11.8 percent in 2011, one person said, declining to
be identified as the plan isn’t public. Agricultural Bank of
China Ltd., the nation’s fourth biggest, should target 11.7
percent, two people said.  Yields on government securities from  Greece , Ireland and
 Portugal  reached records amid speculation the heavily indebted
nations won’t be able to avoid restructuring. Costs to insure
Greek and Portuguese debt climbed to records.  The yield on Irish two-year government notes climbed to a
euro-era record of 12.09 percent. Portuguese two-year yields
touched a euro-era record of 11.74 percent.  The yield on Greece’s 10-year bonds rose as much as 47
basis points to 15.38 percent. Greece’s 2010 budget gap was 10.5
percent of gross domestic product, more than a percentage point
wider than the government estimated, according to figures from
 Europe ’s statistics agency today.  Credit-default swaps on Greek  government bonds  increased 13
basis points to 1,345 basis points and Portuguese swaps climbed
six basis points to 666.  To contact the reporters on this story:
