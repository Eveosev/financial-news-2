Yelp Inc., the local-business
review site started by former PayPal Inc. executive Jeremy Stoppelman, said it’s exploring an initial public offering.  Yelp hasn’t started the process of hiring bankers and
doesn’t have a timeline for when it would go public, Vince Sollitto, a spokesman for the San Francisco-based company, said
in an interview. He confirmed comments Stoppelman made in a Wall
Street Journal article earlier today.  The seven-year-old company sells ads next to user reviews
of restaurants, auto mechanics and doctors, connecting local
businesses with consumers. Last year, private equity firm
Elevation Partners agreed to invest as much as $100 million in
Yelp -- a deal that  valued  the company at $475 million,
according to two people familiar with the matter.  Stoppelman said in the interview with the Journal that the
company’s finances were sound enough that it didn’t need to
raise another round of cash from private investors.  Yelp’s backers also include venture capital firms Bessemer
Venture Partners and Benchmark Capital.  AllThingsD  first
reported two weeks ago on Yelp’s plans to pursue an IPO. The
company is seeking a new chief financial officer as part of that
effort, Sollitto said today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
