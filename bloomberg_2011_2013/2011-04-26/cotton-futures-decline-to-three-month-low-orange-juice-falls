Cotton declined to a three-month
low on concern that demand may slow from  China , the world’s
largest buyer. Orange juice also dropped.  A cotton shortage in the year that ends on July 31 will be
24 percent smaller than forecast in March because of slowing
demand, led by China, also the top producer, Birkenhead,
England-based Cotlook Ltd. said last week.  “At the moment it looks as if demand has peaked,” said
Thomas Mikulski, a senior strategist at Lind-Waldock, a broker
in Chicago.  Cotton for July delivery dropped by the 6-cent exchange
limit, or 3.6 percent, to settle at $1.6039 a pound at 2:47 p.m.
on ICE Futures U.S. in  New York . That’s the lowest since Jan.
25. The fiber has plunged 20 percent this month.  China’s cotton imports plummeted 15 percent in March from a
year earlier, customs data showed last week.  Orange-juice  futures for July delivery retreated 1.6 cents,
or 1 percent, to $1.6535 a pound, declining for the third
straight session.  To contact the reporter on this story:
