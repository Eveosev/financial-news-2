The western U.S. faces a “massive
heatwave” this weekend and next week, with temperatures
approaching record highs from Oregon to  Arizona , according to
AccuWeather Inc.  The interior West has had increasing sunshine and heat in
the past few days, and an “atmospheric blast furnace will be at
full throttle” into the weekend, Alex Sosnowski, a senior
meteorologist at AccuWeather, wrote in an online report.  The heat and drought raise the risk of wildfires, the  State
College , Pennsylvania-based forecaster said. Cities including
 Las Vegas , Phoenix,  Salt Lake City , Denver and Fresno,
California will have near-record heat on a daily basis into next
week, according to AccuWeather.  “In some cities record highs for any date throughout the
year could be equaled or breached,” Sosnowski wrote. “While
many folks over the interior West are accustomed to and expect
hot weather during the summer, the developing pattern will take
the heat to the extreme.”  AccuWeather said people driving through desert areas should
make sure their vehicle can make the journey, and carry extra
water in case of a breakdown.  To contact the reporter on this story:
