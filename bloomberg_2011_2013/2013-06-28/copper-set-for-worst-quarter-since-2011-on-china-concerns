Copper and the London Metal Exchange
Index of six primary metals headed for the biggest quarterly
declines since September 2011 amid as signs of slowing in  China 
and uncertainty about the future of stimulus in the U.S.  Metal for delivery in three months on the LME dropped as
much as 1.3 percent to $6,660.50 a metric ton and was at
$6,753.50 by 10:42 a.m. in  Shanghai . Copper fell 10 percent this
quarter while the index dropped 9.9 percent. The index touched
2,911 on June 24, the lowest since June 2010.  Economists from Goldman Sachs Group Inc. to China
International Capital Corp. this week cut their China growth
forecasts for this year. China’s central bank on June 25 called
on big banks to further their roles as market stabilizers, as
signs of the nation’s biggest squeeze on credit in at least a
decade pushed interbank borrowing costs to a record last week.
China accounts for more than 40 percent of world copper
consumption.  “What concerns the market most is China’s macro
conditions,” Liang Lijuan, an analyst at Cofco Futures Co.,
said by phone from Beijing. “Copper has further downside.”  Metal for delivery in September on the Comex was little
changed at $3.058 a pound. Copper for delivery in October on the
Shanghai Futures Exchange declined 0.8 percent to 48,390  yuan 
($7,872) a ton.  On the LME, tin, lead and zinc declined, while aluminum
climbed.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
