Italian business confidence rose
this month after Prime Minister Enrico Letta’s Cabinet passed
plans to boost employment and postponed the payment of the
value-added tax planned for July.  The manufacturing-sentiment  index  rose to 90.2, the highest
since March 2012, from a revised 88.7 in May, Rome-based
national statistics institute Istat said today. Economists had
predicted a reading of 88.9, according to the median of 13
estimates in a Bloomberg News  survey . The index is based on a
poll of about 4,000 businesses.  On June 26, Letta’s cabinet approved a series of measures
to try to increase hiring of young people after the jobless rate
reached a 36-year high in April. In an effort to spur consumer
spending, Italy also decided to postpone a scheduled sales-tax
increase until Oct. 1, with the possibility of delaying it
further. The euro region’s third-biggest  economy  is probably in
its eighth quarter of economic contraction and is forecast to
shrink 1.9 percent this year, business lobby Confindustria said
in a report yesterday.  Consumer confidence  increased in June amid households’
hopes of an economic recovery later in 2013, Istat said earlier
this week. Still, industrial output unexpectedly fell for a
third month in April, signaling that the recession Italy entered
at the end of 2011 may extend to the second half of this year.  Istat originally reported a business confidence index at
88.5 in May.  To contact the reporters on this story:
