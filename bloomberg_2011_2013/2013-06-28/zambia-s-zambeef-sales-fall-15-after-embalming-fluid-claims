Zambeef Products Plc (ZAM) , Zambia’s
biggest farming company and meat supplier, saw a 15 percent drop
in beef sales last week after a newspaper claimed some of its
products tested positive for aromatic aldehydes, its CEO said.  Sales will probably be 10 percent lower this week after the
Lusaka-based Post newspaper published the claims, which Zambeef
denied, Francis Grogan said in an interview in the capital on
June 26.  Sales are returning to normal, he said. “We haven’t slowed
down our slaughterhouses. It hasn’t impacted us operationally.”  Zambeef, which has shares listed in London and Lusaka,
withdrew all imported beef products from its retail outlets
after allegations by the Post that samples were found to contain
chemicals used to embalm dead bodies, Grogan said on June 21.
The allegations are false and part of a “smear campaign” by a
former employee, he said.  Beef accounted for one-fifth of both revenue and gross
profit for Zambeef in the six months ended March 31. The
products the company imports, mainly offal from the U.S., U.K.
and Ireland, account for about 2.5 percent of total sales,
Grogan said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
