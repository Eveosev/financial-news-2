Onyx Pharmaceuticals Inc. (ONXX) , the maker
of the cancer drug Nexavar, jumped as high as 28 percent in
extended trading after a report that  Amgen Inc. (AMGN)  may offer to buy
the company.  Onyx reached $111.04 at 7:45 p.m.  New York  time yesterday
after the Financial Post reported that documents show Amgen, the
world’s largest biotechnology company by sales, is considering a
bid of $120 a share for the South San Francisco, California-based company. Onyx earlier gained 1.9 percent to close at
$86.82 for a market capitalization of $6.3 billion. The shares
have  increased  36 percent in the past 12 months.  Onyx and its partner,  Bayer AG (BAYN)  of Leverkusen, Germany sell
Nexavar, a therapy for liver and kidney cancer, and Stivarga, a
drug for stomach cancer. Onyx reported  revenue  of $362 million
in 2012, with 80 percent coming from the two drugs. The company
markets Kyprolis, a blood cancer drug approved in 2012, on its
own.  “Strategically, this deal makes a great deal of sense for
Amgen,” said  Mark Schoenebaum , an analyst for ISI Group LLC in
New York. “Amgen already has a very large cancer franchise.
However, none of these drugs are direct anti-tumor agents.”  Both companies declined to comment yesterday on the report.  Amgen has been seeking new products and expanding its
business overseas as sales decline for its anemia drugs Aranesp
and Epogen. The medicines generated about $4 billion in 2012,
about 23 percent of the company’s revenue, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
