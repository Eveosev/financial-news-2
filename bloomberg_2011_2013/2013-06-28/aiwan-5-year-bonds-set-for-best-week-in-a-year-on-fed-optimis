Taiwan’s five-year bonds headed for
the biggest weekly gain in a year on speculation the  Federal
Reserve  will hold off from cutting asset purchases after U.S.
first-quarter growth trailed an earlier estimate.  The world’s largest economy expanded at a revised 1.8
percent rate in the first three months of 2013, official data
showed June 26, short of a prior assessment of 2.4 percent. Fed
Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said June 19 the central bank may trim
its $85 billion a month of debt buying this year and end it in
2014 as long as the economy performs in line with its
projections. Taiwan  held  interest rates for an eighth review
yesterday after the government cut its 2013 growth forecast and
as a cash crunch in  China  threatened the economic outlook.  “Volatility’s been really high lately, due to
uncertainties over the timing of the Fed’s exit,” said Samson Tu, a Taipei-based  fund manager  at Uni-President Assets
Management Corp., which oversees $700 million. “Taiwan’s
financial markets are less prone to the risk of outflows
compared with countries like  South Korea .”  The yield on the 0.875 percent notes due January 2018 fell
four basis points, or 0.04 percentage point, this week to 1.003
percent as of 10:46 a.m. in Taipei, according to Gretai
Securities Market prices. That’s the biggest weekly drop in
benchmark  five-year  rates since the five days ended July 13,
2012. The yield dropped one basis point today, and were little
changed this month and quarter.  The  Taiwan dollar  rose 1.1 percent from the end of last
week to NT$29.949 against its U.S. counterpart, Taipei Forex
Inc. prices show. The currency strengthened 0.8 percent today,
and was up 0.4 percent this month.  Central Bank  The local dollar was trading 0.8 percent stronger one
minute before the 4 p.m. close yesterday and finished 0.2
percent higher. The central bank has sold the currency in the
run-up to the close on most days in the past year, according to
traders who asked not to be identified.  “The Fed’s potential scale-back of bond buying and China’s
liquidity problems affect the prospects of global economic
growth,” Central bank Governor Perng Fai-nan said yesterday.
“Keeping  interest rates  unchanged will ensure a stable economic
recovery and inflation outlook.”  One-month non-deliverable forwards gained 0.7 percent this
week to NT$29.954 against the greenback, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. The contracts climbed 0.2 percent today.

 exchange rate  used to price options, rose two basis points to
5.45 percent during the five-day period and fell three basis
points today.  The  overnight interbank lending  rate was little changed at
0.388 percent, according to a weighted average compiled by the
