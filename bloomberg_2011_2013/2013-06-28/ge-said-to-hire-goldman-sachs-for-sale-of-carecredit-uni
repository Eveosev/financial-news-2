General Electric Co. (GE)  is seeking
buyers for its CareCredit health-care financing division in a
sale that may fetch $1 billion, according to two people with
knowledge of the matter.  GE is working with  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)  to solicit
bids, said the people, who asked not to be identified because
the process is private. Second-round bids for CareCredit, part
of GE Capital, were submitted about a month ago, one of the
people said.  Selling CareCredit would extend Chief Executive Officer
Jeffrey Immelt’s efforts to shrink GE Capital as he boosts
profit from industrial products such as locomotives and jet
engines. GE Capital faces heightened regulatory scrutiny from
the Federal Reserve, which identified it as a potential risk to
the financial system.  Russell Wilkerson , a spokesman for GE Capital, declined to
comment in an e-mail.  Michael DuVally , a spokesman for Goldman
Sachs, didn’t immediately return a call for comment.  CareCredit is the largest issuer of consumer health-care
financing in the U.S., according to the New York Attorney
General’s office.  GE Capital had $538 billion in assets as of March 31,
larger than all but six U.S. banks, according to data compiled
by the Fed. The unit’s $45 billion in revenue was 31 percent of
Fairfield, Connecticut-based GE’s total sales last year.  The potential sale was reported earlier by Reuters.  To contact the reporters on this story:
