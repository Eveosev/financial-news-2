Hachette Book Group agreed to buy
 Walt Disney Co. (DIS) ’s Hyperion, a 22-year-old publisher of books
such as Mitch Albom’s “The Five People You Meet in Heaven.”  After the deal is completed, Hachette will become the
publisher of the more than 1,000 books for adult readers that
Hyperion has put out since it was started in 1991, according to
a statement today. Disney will continue to publish Disney-Hyperion branded kids’ books.  The transaction gives Hachette more than 250 best-selling
works, including “Always Looking Up” by Michael J. Fox and
“Jamie’s Food Revolution” by chef  Jamie Oliver . Hyperion also
is scheduled to publish about 25 new books that Hachette will
now oversee.  “Hyperion’s strong nonfiction list in particular is a
perfect complement to HBG’s title portfolio,” Hachette Book
Group Chief Executive Officer Michael Pietsch said in the
statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
