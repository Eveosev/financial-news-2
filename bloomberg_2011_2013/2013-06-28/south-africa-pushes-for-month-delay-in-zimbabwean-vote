South Africa  wants Zimbabwe to
postpone elections by at least a month from July 31 to allow
time for the government to implement “basic reforms” to ensure
free and fair elections, a senior official said.  The Southern African Development Community, which brokered
an agreement that led to a coalition government after disputed
elections five years ago, has asked authorities to apply to the
Constitutional Court to defer the vote.  The regional group is “hoping the court will be sensitive
to the process of the resolution of some of the tensions in the
build-up to elections,” Lindiwe Zulu, an adviser to South
African President  Jacob Zuma  and a member of SADC’s facilitation
team for the elections, said in an interview in Johannesburg
today.  The Zimbabwe African National Union-Patriotic Front, led by
President  Robert Mugabe , 89, has shared power with Prime
Minister  Morgan Tsvangirai ’s Movement for Democratic Party,
since a 2008 election that international observers said was
marred by violence and irregularities.  Mugabe on June 13 set the election date for July 31, which
Tsvangirai said was “unlawful and unconstitutional.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
