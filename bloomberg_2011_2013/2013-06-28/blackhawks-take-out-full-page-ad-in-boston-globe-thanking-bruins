The Chicago Blackhawks took out a
full-page ad in yesterday’s  Boston  Globe thanking the city for
its hospitality during the Stanley Cup finals.  The ad featured a letter from Blackhawks chairman Rocky Wirtz and team President John McDonough thanking the city, the
Boston Bruins and fans for the way the Blackhawks and their fans
were treated while in Boston.  The Blackhawks scored two goals in the final 76 seconds of
the sixth game of the championship series to claim their second
title in four years.  “Rarely have we experienced the hospitality you afforded
us throughout the playoff series between two incredibly gifted
teams,” the ad read. “From Boston’s political leadership to
every member of the Bruins organization, from the players to the
people on the street, you demonstrated respect, good
sportsmanship and a genuine love for the great game of hockey.”  Asked why the team decided to take out the ad, Blackhawks
spokesman Brandon Faber said in an e-mail, “It was the right
thing to do.”  Ellen Clegg, a spokeswoman for the Boston Globe, declined
to say what the ad cost the Blackhawks.  The Globe was put up for sale in February by the  New York 
Times Co. The company is likely to fetch a price that’s about a
10th of the $1.1 billion, mostly in stock, that it paid in 1993.
The bids are set to be in the range of $100 million, according
to three people who asked not to be identified because the
matter is private.  To contact the reporter on this story:
