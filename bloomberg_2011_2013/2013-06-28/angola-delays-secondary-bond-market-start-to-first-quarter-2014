Angola ,  Africa ’s second-largest oil
producer, pushed back the start of its secondary market for
bonds to the first quarter of next year.  “This is an estimation,” Archer Mangueira, the chairman
of the country’s Capital Markets Commission, said in an
interview today at the London Stock Exchange. “We might make
some adjustments based on whether the legal instruments are
fully developed and implemented, technological infrastructure is
in place, and employees are trained.”  The publicly traded market for the Angolan notes had been
planned to start by the end of September, Mangueira said last
month. The market, which will use electronic trading, will add
to Treasury bills already bought and sold among financial
institutions and help develop a so-called yield curve, he said
at the time.  Angola, which is seeking to boost foreign investment after
a 27-year civil war that ended in 2002, forecasts economic
growth of 7.1 percent this year from 7.4 percent in 2012. Crude
accounts for three-quarters of budget revenue, according to the
 International Monetary Fund . The formerly Marxist nation ranks
157th out of 176 countries on Transparency International’s 2012
Corruption Perceptions Index.  Angola sold $1 billion of dollar bonds maturing in 2019 at
a yield of 7 percent in August 2012, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg. After the bonds rallied last year, yields on the
notes have since risen 134 basis points, or 1.34 percentage
points, this year to 6.427 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
