Corn farmers in the U.S., the
world’s biggest producer, planted the most acres since 1936 this
year, more than a prior government forecast, as growers
responded to low stockpiles with more planting.  About 97.379 million acres (39.4 million hectares) were
planted, up from 97.282 million forecast in March and 97.155
million last year, the  U.S. Department of Agriculture  said  today 
after surveying farmers this month. The average estimate of 34
analysts in a Bloomberg News survey was 95.431 million acres.  Corn supplies on June 1 in the U.S., the biggest producer,
fell 12 percent from last year to 2.76 billion bushels, the
lowest since 1997, after the worst drought in more than 70 years
cut production to a six-year low in 2012, the government said
today in a separate report.  The USDA surveyed more than 70,000 farmers by telephone,
mail, the Internet and personal interviews in the first two
weeks of June. The questions covered 11,000 one square-mile
randomly selected areas across the U.S.  Corn futures through yesterday tumbled 5.1 percent this
month after the USDA forecast June 12 that farmers would harvest
a record crop as output rebounds from last year’s drought and
exports this year fell to the lowest since 1971. Corn for
delivery in December, after the harvest, fell 1 percent to close
yesterday at $5.385 a bushel.  The USDA estimated the number of acres that will be
harvested at 89.135 million, down from 89.5 million projected on
June 12.  The USDA also surveyed farmers about the use of genetically
modified seeds produced by  Monsanto Co. (MON)  and  Dupont Co. (DD)  About 90
percent of the total acreage was planted with gene-engineered
seeds this year, up from 88 percent a year earlier and 80
percent five years ago, the government said.  Corn is the biggest U.S. crop, with a 2012 value of $77.4
billion, government figures show.  To contact the reporters on this story:
