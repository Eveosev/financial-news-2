Soybean  inventories  on June 1 in the
U.S., the worldâ€™s largest grower, fell 35 percent from a year
earlier to 434.5 million bushels, the lowest since 2004, after
the 2012 drought cut production for a third straight year.  Stockpiles fell from a year-earlier total of 667.5 million
bushels (18.15 million metric tons), the  U.S. Department of
Agriculture  said  today  in a quarterly report. The average
estimate of 30 analysts was 447 million, a Bloomberg survey
showed. Usage from March through May was 564 million bushels,
down 20 percent from a year earlier, the USDA said.  Supplies held on farms fell 4.4 percent to 171 million
bushels from 179 million a year earlier, the USDA said. Soybeans
held in commercial grain storage fell 46 percent to 263.4
million bushels from 488.5 million on June 1, 2012.  The average U.S. cash  soybean  price was $15.1319 a bushel
as of June 26, up 1.4 percent this year, according to data from
the  Minneapolis Grain Exchange . Soybean futures for delivery in
November, after the harvest, fell 2.2 percent this month to
$12.7525 yesterday on the Chicago Board of Trade, after Brazil
and Argentina boosted output this year and the USDA forecast a
record U.S. crop in 2013.  To contact the reporter on this story:
