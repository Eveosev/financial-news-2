Sugar fell for a third day in New
York as millers in  Brazil , the world’s largest producer, are set
to advance sales to take advantage of a weaker local currency as
the 2013-14 harvest there progresses. Cocoa gained.  Brazil shipped 1.44 million metric tons of sugar in the
first three weeks of June, up from 1.29 million tons in June
2012, Macquarie Group Ltd.,  Australia ’s largest investment bank,
said in a report e-mailed today. The Brazilian real fell 6.9
percent in the past month, providing the worst returns among a
basket of 24 emerging market currencies tracked by Bloomberg.  “We’re not convinced we have found a price bottom yet,”
said  Kona Haque , an analyst at Macquarie in  London . “The crush
is nearing its peak now, and dry weather is forecast for July
and August. This will mean more sugar is on its way.”  Raw sugar for delivery in October slipped 0.2 percent to
16.97 cents a pound by 6:41 a.m. on ICE Futures U.S. in New
York, after falling 1.9 percent yesterday. White sugar for
August delivery slid 0.1 percent to $507.10 a ton on NYSE Liffe
in London. The July raw sugar futures expire today.  The devaluation of the Mexican peso and the  Indian rupee 
will likely prompt these nations to ship more overseas, Haque
said. Local prices in  India , the world’s second-biggest sugar
producer, are weakening because of above-average monsoon rains,
adding to mills’ interest in boosting sales overseas, she said.  Arabica coffee for delivery in September gained 0.2 percent
to $1.221 a pound on ICE. Robusta coffee for delivery in
September gained 0.3 percent to $1,751 a ton on NYSE Liffe.  Robusta coffee fell 10 percent this year and arabica beans
slid 15 percent. Global coffee supplies will exceed demand for a
fourth year in the 2013-14 season that starts in October in most
countries, Societe Generale SA estimated June 12. Production
will be 6.85 million bags above demand, following a surplus of
9.1 million bags in 2012-13, the bank said.  Weakening emerging market currencies may also prompt coffee
producers to accelerate sales to benefit from the price in U.S.
dollars, Haque said.  Cocoa for September delivery was up 0.7 percent to $2,162 a
ton in  New York . Cocoa for September delivery gained 0.4 percent
to 1,455 pounds ($2,217) a ton in London.  To contact the reporter on this story:
