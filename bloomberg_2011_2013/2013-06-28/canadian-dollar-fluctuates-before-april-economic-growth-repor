The Canadian dollar fell to almost
the lowest since 2011 as a slowdown in gross domestic product
growth in April highlighted the nation’s diverging economic
prospects from the U.S., its largest trading partner.  Output rose 0.1 percent to an annualized C$1.57 trillion
($1.50 trillion) after a 0.2 percent gain in March,  Statistics
Canada  said in Ottawa. The currency extended a loss after
comments by two U.S. Federal Reserve officials fueled bets on a
tapering of asset buying.  Canada ’s dollar represented 1.57
percent of the $6.05 trillion in official foreign-exchange
reserves in the first quarter, according to the International
Monetary Fund’s first data on global holdings of the currency.  “The Canadian economy is still muddling along, trying to
reach 2 percent growth,”  David Watt , chief economist at the
Canadian unit of HSBC Holdings Plc, said by phone from Toronto.
“There’s nothing here that signals the dollar will break out of
its range.”  The loonie, as the Canadian dollar is known for the image
of the aquatic bird on the C$1 coin, fell 0.4 percent to
C$1.0519 per  U.S. dollar  in Toronto after touching C$1.0553,
almost the lowest since October 2011. One loonie buys 95.07 U.S.
cents.  The currency declined 1.4 percent this month, 3.3 percent
this quarter and 5.7 percent this year. This week it has traded
in a range of C$1.0424 to C$1.0556, its weakest level in 2013.
It strengthened to 98.16 cents on Jan. 11.  Oil, Bonds  Crude oil dropped 0.7 percent $96.37 a barrel in  New York 
after rising as much as 0.8 percent. The Standard & Poor’s GSCI
index of 24 commodities dropped 0.8 percent. The S&P 500 Index
of stocks depreciated 0.1 percent.  Canada’s benchmark 10-year government bond yields fell,
with yields rising three basis points, or 0.03 percentage point,
to 2.44 percent. The 1.5 percent security maturing in June 2023
lost 21 cents to C$91.81.  The  GDP (CAGDPMOM)  result matched the median forecast in a Bloomberg
survey with 21 responses as it grew for a fourth month. From a
year earlier, the economy grew 1.4 percent in April.  In a separate report, Statistics Canada said its index of
 raw-materials prices  paid by manufacturers rose 0.2 percent in
May from the month before. Economists in a Bloomberg survey had
a median prediction of a 0.4 percent increase.  “The GDP data wasn’t very impressive, and the industrial-price data speaks to a tame inflation period,”  Adrian Miller ,
the head of fixed-income strategy at GMP Securities LLC in New
York, said in an e-mail. “So that suggests a weaker loonie.”  Economic Underperformance  Canada’s economy underperformed that of the U.S. last year
for the first time since 2006, a trend that’s forecast to
continue for the next three years. In 2013, Canada’s growth is
forecast at 1.7 percent, compared with 1.9 percent in the U.S.,
according to the median estimates of separate Bloomberg surveys.  The following year will see growth in Canada of 2.4
percent, versus 2.7 percent in the U.S., and in 2015 Canada will
grow at a 2.75 percent pace, compared with the U.S.’s 3 percent,
the surveys show.  The  Bank of Canada , whose key interest rate of 1 percent is
the highest among the Group of Seven nations, is the only
central bank among them with a leaning toward higher rates.
Governor Stephen Poloz reiterated that stance, even as he said
on June 19 that Canada’s economic recovery will take “stability
and patience.”  Stimulus Withdrawal  The weak economic data “leaves us driven by global trends
and sentiment, and the general outlook for the U.S. dollar,”
said HSBC’s Watt.  Fed Bank of Richmond President  Jeffrey Lacker  said today
that more bond purchases are unwarranted because the four-year
economic expansion is being limited by structural factors beyond
the Fed’s control. Fed Reserve Governor  Jeremy Stein  said policy
makers may make a decision in September about tapering monetary
stimulus.  The greenback has gained versus all but one major rival
since June 19, when Fed Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said the Fed
could start reducing the $85 billion monthly pace of bond
purchases later this year and end the purchases in the middle of
2014, assuming that the economy meets the Fed’s forecasts.  Futures traders  pared  their bets that the Canadian dollar
will decline against the U.S. dollar to the least since Feb. 22,
figures from the Washington-based Commodity Futures Trading
Commission show. The difference in the number of wagers by  hedge
funds  and other large speculators on a decline in the Canadian
dollar compared with those on a gain -- so-called net shorts --
was 10,638 on June 25, compared with net shorts of 26,087 a week
earlier.  The share of Canadian holdings in the January-March period
was higher than the 1.48 percent share in the final three months
of 2012, the IMF report showed. Today’s figures for the first
time specified official reserves of the loonie, as well as its
 Australia  peer, which previously had been indistinguishable in
the “other currencies” category.  The U.S. dollar was 62.2 percent of allocated reserves in
the January-March period, the euro was 23.7 percent and the
Aussie was 1.63 percent.  The loonie is down 0.8 percent this month against nine
developed-nation currencies tracked by the Bloomberg Correlation
Weighted Index. The dollars of Australia and  New Zealand , fellow
commodities exporters, led decliners with drops of 5.1 percent
and 4.2 percent. The greenback gained 0.5 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
