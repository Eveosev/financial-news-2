Los Angeles Department of Water &
Power, the utility that serves about 1.5 million Southern
 California  customers, is offering residents more money to tear
out grass and replace it with native plants that require less
water.  LADWP will pay residential customers $2 for every square
foot (0.09 square meters) of grass they replace, up from the
current $1.50 incentive, the utility said today in a  statement .  About 40 percent of the city’s water is used outdoors, and
the utility is seeking ways to conserve more for use indoors
after a dry winter, according to James McDaniel, senior
assistant general manager of the LADWP water system. Snowpack in
the state, which typically provides about a third of
California’s water for homes and farms, was  measured  at about 17
percent of normal in May.  “Traditional grass landscape requires a lot of water, but
we can replace it with plants that are natural to the California
climate, attractive, easy to maintain and more water-wise,” he
said in the statement.  The Las Vegas Valley Water District  offers  $1.50 a square
foot under a similar program.  To contact the reporter on this story:
