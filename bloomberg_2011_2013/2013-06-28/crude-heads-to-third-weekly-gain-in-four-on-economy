West Texas Intermediate crude fell
for the first time in five days as the dollar strengthened to a
three-week high against other major currencies. WTI narrowed its
discount to Brent to the least in two years.  Futures dropped as the  Dollar Index  climbed after data
showed consumers were more confident than forecast in June and
Federal Reserve Governor  Jeremy Stein  made comments on monetary
stimulus. The U.S. benchmark rose for the third time in four
weeks and the first month since March. For the quarter, it
declined 0.7 percent.  “The problem is the dollar,” said Bill Baruch, a senior
market strategist at commodities trading firm Iitrader.com in
 Chicago . “The stronger dollar is weighing on the market. If the
dollar was weaker, crude may be testing $100 already.”  WTI for August delivery slid 49 cents, or 0.5 percent, to
settle at $96.56 a barrel on the  New York Mercantile Exchange 
after rising to $97.82. The volume of all futures traded was 2.2
percent lower than the 100-day average for the time of day at
2:41 p.m. Futures rose 3.1 percent this week and 5 percent in
June.  Brent for August settlement fell 66 cents, or 0.6 percent,
to end at $102.16 a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures
 Europe  exchange. Volume was 10 percent below the 100-day
average. The European benchmark crude’s premium to WTI shrank to
$5.60, the least since January 2011.  Dollar Index  The Dollar Index, which measures the greenback against six
other major currencies including the euro, rose as much as 0.5
percent to 83.344, the highest level since June 3. The index has
advanced 3.2 percent since June 18. A stronger dollar reduces
oil’s appeal as an investment alternative.  The Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan index of
consumer  confidence  for this month was 84.1, higher than the
median forecast of 83 percent in a Bloomberg survey.  The Fed’s Stein said the central bank may make a decision
in September about tapering monetary stimulus. Fed Chairman  Ben
S. Bernanke  said on June 19 that the central bank may trim the
$85 billion-a-month bond purchases and end them in the middle of
2014 if the economy continues to improve.  “Some of the U.S. data has been modestly positive,” said
Jason Schenker, president of Prestige Economics LLC, an Austin,
Texas-based energy consultant. “The story of modest growth
continues and it’s supportive for crude.”  Gasoline Demand  WTI gained for the first month since March as gasoline
demand grew and refineries used more crude to meet rising
consumption during summer, when many Americans take vacations.  “We seem to be drawing investment flows into the market,”
said  Tim Evans , an energy analyst at Citi Futures Perspective in
New York.  Total petroleum  use  in the U.S. increased 3 percent last
week to 19 million barrels a day, the most since May 3, the
Energy Information Administration reported on June 26. Gasoline
consumption grew 0.6 percent to 8.89 million barrels a day.  Refiners boosted  operating rates  to 90.2 percent, the
highest level this year. Processing units are often restarted
late in the spring, after being idled for maintenance in winter.  “We are seeing good data out of the U.S. and Europe,”
said  Addison Armstrong , director of market research at Tradition
Energy in  Stamford ,  Connecticut . “There are expectations of
better gasoline demand in the third quarter.”  Retracement Level  WTI advanced this week after prices broke above $96.71
yesterday, the 61.8 percent retracement level between June 19’s
high and June 24’s low on a Fibonacci chart, according to
Baruch.  “It’s a technical market now,” Baruch said. The $96.71 is
“now the support level.”  Brent’s premium over WTI narrowed as the European benchmark
fell 7.1 percent this quarter. The Buzzard field in the  North
Sea  returned to approximately full pumping rates of about
208,000 barrels a day about a week after a June 6 halt because
of an equipment failure.  Buzzard is the largest contributor to the Forties crude
grade, which sets the value of Dated Brent, the benchmark used
to price more than half of the world’s crude.  Inventories at Cushing,  Oklahoma , the delivery point for
WTI futures, decreased to 48.6 million barrels on June 14, the
lowest level since Dec. 14. They gained 1.4 percent last week to
49.3 million and total U.S. inventories rose to 394.1 million.  “I am not surprised by the narrowing spread,” Schenker
said. “It’s a physical market, and the spread could narrow even
further through the end of the year.”  Implied volatility for at-the-money WTI options expiring in
August was 19.6 percent, down from 20.7 percent yesterday, data
compiled by Bloomberg showed.  Electronic trading volume on the Nymex was 501,488
contracts as of 2:54 p.m. It totaled 577,969 contracts
yesterday, 7.4 percent lower than the three-month average. Open
interest was 1.82 million contracts.  To contact the reporter on this story:
