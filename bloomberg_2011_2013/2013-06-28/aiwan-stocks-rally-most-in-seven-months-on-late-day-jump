Taiwan’s stocks jumped in the  last
minute  of trading, capping the benchmark index’s biggest gain in
seven months. Chipmakers led the advance.  The  Taiex index  climbed 2.3 percent to 8,062.21, with about
half of those gains coming just before the close.  Taiwan
Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (2330) , which has the biggest weighting
on the gauge, rallied 6.2 percent to NT$111, after advancing 2.3
percent in the last six minutes. Chunghwa Telecom Co. rose 6.4
percent to NT$102, the biggest gain since October 2008.  “There’s a chance foreigners are doing window dressing”
to boost net asset values for their semi-annual reports, Diana Wu, a vice-president at Capital Securities Corp., said by phone
in Taipei today.  William Tseng, deputy finance minister, didn’t immediately
answer calls to his mobile phone. Michael Lin, a spokesman for
the Taiwan Stock Exchange, said he doesn’t know why the index
surged in the last minute.  The Taiex index jumped 3.5 percent this week as Taiwan
lawmakers voted to roll back provisions of a capital gains tax
on certain stock sales and removed an index price threshold that
depressed shares and dragged down market trading volume.  The  gauge , which has advanced 4.7 percent this year, trades
at 13.9 times 12-month projected profit, compared with the MSCI
Emerging Market index’s 9.7 times, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
