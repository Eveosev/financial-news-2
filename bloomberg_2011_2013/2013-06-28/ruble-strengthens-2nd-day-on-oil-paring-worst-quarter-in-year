The ruble was poised for the biggest
quarterly drop in a year on concern commodities will decline and
as companies finished paying taxes.  The ruble depreciated 0.3 percent against the dollar to
32.9075 by 6 p.m. in Moscow, a 5.6 percent decline in the
quarter. The currency lost 0.2 percent against the dollar-euro
basket to 37.4005, extending its drop in the quarter to 6.4
percent.  Russia ’s central bank has been buying rubles since May 29
to slow a 3.1 percent slide against the basket this month after
U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said the regulator
may start reducing bond purchases that have fueled asset-price
gains. Russian companies are due to pay income tax today. The
Standard & Poor’s  GSCI Index of Commodities  retreated 5.9
percent in the quarter.  “The currency may weaken at the start of next month if
commodities drop,” Anton Zakharov, a foreign-exchange analyst
at OAO Promsvyazbank, said by phone. “Demand for the ruble fell
a lot at the start of the month mainly because of concerns
surrounding the potential curb to the speed of the Fed’s easing
program, as well as a drop in  oil prices .”  Speculation a plan by the Finance Ministry to buy foreign
currency on the market for its wealth funds will weaken the
ruble helped drive it to the lowest since 2009 against the
basket on June 20.  Yields Climb  Bank Rossii, which reports intervention data with a delay
and purchases the currency if the ruble weakens beyond certain
levels against the basket,  spent  the equivalent of 6.57 billion
rubles ($201 million) of foreign currency on June 27, it said
today.  Brent crude  rose 0.2 percent to $103.02 per barrel,
advancing for a fifth day. Russia receives about 50 percent of
its budget revenue from the oil and natural-gas industry.  The yield on benchmark ruble debt due 2027 jumped nine
basis points to 7.96 percent, the first day of gains in four.
That took the increase in the quarter to 61 basis points. The
yield on Russia’s Eurobonds due March 2030 was little changed at
4.235 percent, after climbing to the highest since December 2011
on June 24.  The central bank on June 25 raised the band in which it
allows the ruble to trade against its target dollar-euro basket,
central bank Deputy Chairman Sergey Shvetsov said June 26 in
Moscow. The regulator  moves  the corridor 5 kopeks when currency
interventions reach $450 million and the band stood at
31.65-38.65 rubles as of May 31, according to Bank Rossii’s
website.  Loosening Controls  The central bank is loosening its controls on the currency
as it aims to complete a transition to targeting inflation
instead of the  exchange rate  by 2015.  The  Finance Ministry  canceled a ruble-bond auction
scheduled for June 26 this week, citing market conditions. It
also axed a June 5 sale and shelved an auction of 10 billion
rubles of 15-year notes last week on a lack of competitive bids.
The government scrapped a May 22 sale for the same reason and
sold only 900 million rubles of 20 billion rubles in notes
offered May 29.  To contact the reporter on this story:
