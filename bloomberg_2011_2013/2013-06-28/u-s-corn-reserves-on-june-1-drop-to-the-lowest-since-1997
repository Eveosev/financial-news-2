Corn supplies on June 1 in the U.S.,
the biggest producer, fell 12 percent to 2.76 billion bushels,
the lowest since 1997 after the worst drought in more than 70
years cut production to a six-year low in 2012, the government
said.  Inventories fell from 3.15 billion bushels (80.01 million
metric tons) held in farmer and commercial grain bins a year
earlier, the  U.S. Department of Agriculture  said  today . The
average estimate of 30 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg was 2.862
billion. Usage from March through May was 2.64 billion bushels
compared with 2.88 billion during the same period a year
earlier.  Supplies held on  farms  fell 15 percent to 1.26 billion
bushels from 1.48 billion a year earlier. Corn  reserves  held in
commercial grain storage fell 9.7 percent to 1.5 billion from
1.67 billion on June 1 2012.  Futures on the Chicago Board of Trade for delivery in
December, after the harvest, fell 5.1 percent this month to
$5.385 a bushel yesterday. The USDA is forecasting a record
harvest in 2013 as  output  rebounds from last yearâ€™s drought, the
worst since the 1930s.  Corn is the biggest U.S. crop, with a 2012 value of $77.4
billion, government figures show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
