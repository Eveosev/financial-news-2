Matas A/S, (MATAS)  the drugstore chain
bought by CVC Capital Partners Ltd. in 2007, rose on its
Copenhagen debut after becoming Denmark’s first initial public
offering through a private-equity firm in almost three years.  The  shares  rose as much as 7.8 percent and were up 6.1
percent at 122 kroner as of 9:08 a.m. in the Danish capital.
That gave the Alleroed, Denmark-based company a market value of
5 billion kroner ($875 million). The IPO price of 115 kroner
compared with an initial range of 100 kroner to 120 kroner.  “It’s an attractive valuation and it seems the owners
didn’t want to price it too tightly as they wanted a good
debut,” Jonas Guldborg Hansen, a consumer analyst at Jyske Bank
A/S, said by phone. Hansen, who’s based in Silkeborg,  Denmark ,
recommends that investors buy the stock and has a price estimate
of 140 kroner a share.  Matas, which sells drugs and beauty products at 293 Danish
outlets, is Copenhagen’s first private-equity IPO since Axcel
A/S sold jewelry maker Pandora A/S on the stock market in
October 2010. Matas’s sellers, a unit of London-based CVC and
Materialisternes Invest ApS, will keep a 38.9 percent stake if
over-allotment options are fully exercised, the company said.  Matas said it received “strong interest” from Danish
retail investors during the offering. The owners allocated about
20 percent of the offered shares to retail buyers and the rest
to Danish and international institutional investors.  Morgan Stanley and Nordea Bank AB were joint global
managers in the sale.  To contact the reporter on this story:
