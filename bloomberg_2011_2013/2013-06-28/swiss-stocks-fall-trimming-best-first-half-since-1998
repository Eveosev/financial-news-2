Stocks in Switzerland  declined,
trimming the Swiss Market Index’s biggest first-half rally in 15
years, as investors awaited U.S. reports on business activity
and  consumer confidence .  Roche Holding AG (ROG)  fell 1.8 percent after the largest three-day rally since August 2011. Watchmakers  Swatch Group (UHR)  AG and
 Cie. Financiere Richemont SA (CFR)  increased at least 1 percent,
extending this week’s gain to more than 5 percent.  The SMI dropped 0.4 percent to 7,639.74 at 11:57 a.m. in
Zurich, paring its first weekly rally in six weeks. The gauge
has gained 12 percent in the first half of 2013, the best start
to a year since 1998, when it rallied 25 percent in the period
period. It has slipped 3.8 percent in June and 2.2 percent this
quarter as the  Federal Reserve  said it may trim stimulus
measures as the  U.S. economy  heals. The broader Swiss
Performance Index also lost 0.4 percent today.  “Investors will have to get used to the fact that cash
infusions will not be available, at least not in the U.S.,”
Philipp Baertschi, chief investment officer for private clients
at Bank J. Safra Sarasin Ltd. in Zurich, wrote in a note. “This
rehabilitation or process of adjustment will be accompanied by
increased volatility in all asset classes. In the short term, we
remain underweight bonds, equities as well as commodities.”  The VSMI Volatility Index, which gauges the cost of
protecting against swings on the SMI, has jumped 54 percent this
quarter, the biggest increase since September 2011. It rose 2
percent to 19 today.  U.S. Economy  In the U.S., the Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan
final index of consumer sentiment rose to 83 in June, compared
with a prior reading of 82.7 for the month, according to the
median estimate of economists in a Bloomberg News survey before
the report is released. The gauge would still be lower than the
six-year high of 84.5 reached in May.  The MNI Chicago Report’s business barometer probably fell
to 55 in June from 58.7 the previous month, according to a
separate poll of economists. The gauge may remain above the 50
level that signals expansion.  An  index  that seeks to predict the Swiss economy’s
direction about six months ahead advanced to 1.16 in June from a
revised 1.09 last month, according to figures from the KOF Swiss
Economic Institute in Zurich. That was less than the 1.19 median
projection in a Bloomberg survey of economists.  Roche Retreats  Roche, which makes up about 17 percent of the  SMI (SMI)  by
weight, slipped 1.8 percent to 231.50 Swiss francs as health-care stocks posted the biggest decline among the 19 industry
groups on the Stoxx Europe 600 Index. The world’s biggest maker
of cancer drugs is heading for its first decline in 13 months in
June.  Schmolz & Bickenbach AG dropped 6.2 percent to 2.90 francs
before trading was suspended at the company’s request. The maker
of steel products offered shareholders seven new shares for
every two they currently own in a 330 million-franc ($349
million) capital increase. The share sale must be approved at
today’s annual general meeting, according to a a statement from
the company.  Swatch increased 1.1 percent to 517 francs and Richemont
climbed 1.3 percent to 84.15 francs, respectively.  To contact the reporter on this story:
