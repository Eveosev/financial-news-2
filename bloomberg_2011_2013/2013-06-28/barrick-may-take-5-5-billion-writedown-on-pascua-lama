(Corrects job description in fourth paragraph of story
published June 29.)  Barrick Gold Corp. (ABX) , the world’s
biggest gold miner, may take a writedown of as much as $5.5
billion on its Pascua-Lama project in the Andes after the price
of the metal plunged close to a three-year low.  Barrick is also likely to take other “significant”
impairment charges for the second quarter as it reviews goodwill
and other assets, the Toronto-based company said yesterday in a
statement.  Barrick now expects first production from the mine on the
Chile-Argentina border in mid-2016, compared with a previous
target of the second half of 2014. It will provide an updated
capital cost estimate during the third quarter, after finalizing
a new construction schedule. Barrick raised the cost estimate
twice last year to as much as $8.5 billion.  Gold futures in  New York  have plunged 27 percent this year
and slipped below $1,200 an ounce on June 27 for the first time
since August 2010. A “storm of writedowns” is coming from the
gold  mining industry , Jake Greenberg, a metals and mining
specialist at Jefferies International Ltd., said in a June 19
note.  Newcrest Mining Ltd. said earlier this month it expects to
take a writedown of as much as A$6 billion ($5.5 billion) on its
mines because of lower  gold prices . The Melbourne-based company,
which expects to write down its assets by about 25 percent of
their book value as of Dec. 31, has seen its market value fall
A$3.6 billion this month to A$7.6 billion.  Lay Offs  Barrick said it plans to resequence development of Pascua-Lama, which means staffing levels will be reduced because
construction is spread over a longer period of time. The company
expects total spending on the project in 2013 and 2014 will now
be $1.5 billion to $1.8 billion lower.  Construction on the Chilean side of Pascua-Lama has been
halted since April, after a Chilean court accepted an injunction
filed by indigenous communities and  Chile ’s environmental
regulator later ordered work to protect water supplies before
the project can resume.  Barrick has submitted a plan for review by Chilean
authorities to build the project’s water-management system in
compliance with permit conditions, which it plans to complete by
the end of 2014, followed by restarting the remaining
construction work in Chile.  Pascua-Lama, which was originally forecast to cost no more
than $3 billion when the construction was approved in 2009, is
expected to produce an average of 800,000 to 850,000 ounces
annually in its first five years of production.  The mine has “significant and strategic value for Barrick
shareholders,” Chief Executive Officer Jamie Sokalsky said in
the statement.  Barrick has dropped 52 percent this year. The Philadelphia
Stock Exchange Gold and Silver Index of 30 companies has fallen
46 percent in 2013.  To contact the reporter on this story:
