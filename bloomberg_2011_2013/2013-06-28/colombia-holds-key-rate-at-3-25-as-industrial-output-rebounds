Colombia  left borrowing costs
unchanged for a third straight month as  inflation  remains near a
six-decade low and economic growth shows signs of picking up.  Banco de la Republica, led by Governor Jose Dario Uribe,
held its benchmark  interest rate  at 3.25 percent today, as
forecast by 26 of 27 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. One analyst
predicted a quarter-point cut.  The central bank has reduced borrowing costs seven times in
the past year as the inflation rate fell to its lowest level
since 1955 and industrial output slumped the most since the
aftermath of the 2008 global financial crisis. The central bank
will start to raise rates in the fourth quarter as growth and
inflation pick up in response to the bank’s stimulus, said
Daniel Velandia, head analyst at Credicorp Capital’s Colombia
unit in Bogota, who forecast today’s decision. Industrial output
grew in May at the fastest pace since August 2011.  “The delayed action of monetary policy, together with
economic data, show that the worst of the economic cycle is
behind us in the first quarter,” Velandia said in a June 27
phone interview. “In November, we see them starting a moderate
tightening cycle.”  Industrial production leaped 8.4 percent in April from the
year earlier, almost twice the pace analysts had expected.
Retail sales gained 5.7 percent over the same period, compared
with the 3.2 percent forecast by analysts.  Price Pressure  The peso weakened to an 18-month low this month, raising
the prospect of faster inflation later this year. The currency
declined after the U.S. Federal Reserve signaled it may start
reducing stimulus that buoyed emerging-market assets as
investors sought higher yields.  The yield on the nation’s benchmark peso bonds due 2024
rose 6 basis points to 6.714 percent at 11:48 a.m. in Bogota.
The yield has risen 71 basis points this month. The peso
weakened 0.3 percent to 1927.98 per dollar.  Annual inflation slowed to 2 percent in May, from 2.02
percent in April, after touching a six-decade low of 1.83
percent in February. Two measures of  core inflation  tracked by
the central bank, which aim to track underlying trends by
excluding the most volatile prices, slowed to record lows last
month.  Consumer prices will rise 2.55 percent this year, and 3.1
percent in 2014, according to a June central bank survey of
economists.  Inflation slowed as the economy economy grew 2.8 percent in
the first quarter from a year earlier, slower than the 4.8
percent expansion in  Peru  and 4.1 percent in  Chile  and faster
than the 0.8 percent growth rate in  Mexico . The industrial
sector contracted 4.1 percent over the same period.  President  Juan Manuel Santos  announced in April a 5
trillion peso ($2.6 billion) stimulus package to  “reactivate”
the industrial sector and boost growth by 0.7 percentage point
this year. Growth and inflation will pick up this year as Santos
ramps up spending ahead of the 2014 elections, said Rafael
Neira, a financial risk analyst with GNB Sudameris.  To contact the reporters on this story:
