German plant and machinery orders
fell in May as domestic demand dropped, even as recent
indicators suggest a recovery in  Europe ’s largest economy.  Orders, adjusted for inflation, decreased 5 percent from a
year ago, VDMA said in an e-mailed statement today. Orders from
abroad were unchanged, while domestic orders dropped 14 percent.
In the three months through May, orders remained unchanged
compared to a year earlier.  The Bundesbank said this month that German gross domestic
product should have improved “markedly” in the second quarter,
while warning of a potential slowdown in coming months. The
Frankfurt-based central bank expects growth of 0.3 percent this
year and 1.5 percent in 2014, after an expansion of just 0.1
percent in the three months ended March.  There’s “no clear sign for an expansion” in investment in
 Germany , VDMA chief economist  Ralph Wiechers  said in the
statement. “Domestic orders were overall disappointing.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
