Rio Tinto Plc (RIO) , the world’s second-biggest mining company, won dismissal of a lawsuit in the U.S.
accusing it of contributing to genocide in Papua New Guinea.  The U.S. Court of Appeals in San Francisco today affirmed a
lower court’s ruling dismissing the case. The appeals court’s
decision was prompted by an April 22 order by the U.S. Supreme
Court, which in a separate case brought against  Royal Dutch
Shell Plc (RDSA)  had scaled back application of the 1789 Alien Tort
Statute.  That law, also invoked in the Rio Tinto case, has been a
favorite tool of human-rights advocates seeking to hold
companies responsible in U.S. courts for atrocities overseas.  The lawsuit against London-based Rio Tinto stems from the
deaths of thousands of indigenous people starting in 1988 on the
island of Bougainville, where Rio Tinto was part of a group
operating the world’s largest open copper pit.  The case is Sarie v. Rio Tinto Plc, 02-56256, U.S. Court of
Appeals for the Ninth Circuit ( San Francisco .)  To contact the reporter on this story:
