CNO Financial Group Inc. (CNO) , the
insurer that counts John Paulson among its top investors, said
it repurchased $50 million of its common stock in the second
quarter along with $9.4 million in convertible debentures.  The insurer expects to repurchase $250 million to $300
million of securities this year, Carmel, Indiana-based CNO said
today in a statement. CNO said it expects to take a second-quarter charge of $5 million tied to the buybacks.  “We’ve been tactical in our approach to returning capital
to shareholders,” Chief Financial Officer Frederick Crawford
said on an April 25 conference call. “We retired over 26
percent of our diluted shares in the past two years through a
mix of share and convertible repurchases.”  CNO gained less than 1 percent to $12.96 in  New York 
trading today and has advanced 39 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
