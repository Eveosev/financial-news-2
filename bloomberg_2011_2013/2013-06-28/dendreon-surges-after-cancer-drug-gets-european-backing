Dendreon Corp. (DNDN)  rose after winning
the backing of European Union regulators for the prostate cancer
treatment Provenge, the company’s only marketed product.  Dendreon gained about 1 percent to $4.12 at the close in
 New York . The Seattle-based company’s shares have declined 22
percent this year.  Provenge was approved in 2010 as the first therapy in the
U.S. that trains the body’s immune system to attack cancer cells
as if they were a virus. Possibilities for partnerships for the
drug in  Europe  are being evaluated, Dendreon said today in a
statement. The European Medicines Agency’s Committee for
Medicinal Products for Human Use today recommended that
marketing authorization for Provenge be approved with a final
decision by the European Commission expected later this year,
Dendreon said.  “Whether Dendreon can find a partner or decides to launch
the drug alone in Europe, we expect there will be a significant
lag time between EU approval” and being on the market,  Geoffrey Porges , an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., wrote today in
a note. Provenge may not reach the EU market until the third
quarter of 2015, said Porges, who has an outperform rating on
the shares.  The committee recommended that Provenge be cleared to treat
prostate cancer with no or little symptoms in adult males for
whom chemotherapy isn’t yet clinically indicated.  To contact the reporter on this story:
