China ’s property stocks rose the
most in more than four months after a newspaper report that the
government may ease financing for developers.  The  Shanghai  Stock Exchange Property Index rose 4 percent
at the close of trading, the biggest gain since Feb. 5.  China
Vanke Co. (000002) , the biggest listed developer on mainland exchanges,
jumped 8.4 percent to 9.85  yuan  in Shenzhen.  Poly Real Estate
Group Co. (600048) , the second largest, added 6.2 percent to 9.91 yuan.  Chinese companies that have property-related businesses may
be able to apply to raise funds and restructure without spinning
off those businesses, China’s 21st Century Business Herald
reported today, citing an unidentified property company
official. The report is another sign that the regulator will
ease a crunch that sent China’s overnight repurchase rate to a
record last week.  “This is definitely good news for developers if the report
is true, because that’ll cut the refinancing costs
substantially,” Dai Fang, a Shanghai-based property analyst at
Zheshang Securities Co., said  “It may also be a move from the
government to help developers from a credit crunch and boost the
economy.”  The country has banned developers from issuing new shares,
share placements and restructuring since at least 2008,
according to Dai.  China will use various tools to adjust liquidity, central
bank governor  Zhou Xiaochuan  said today in Shanghai.  In  Hong Kong ,  China Overseas Land & Investment Ltd. (688) , the
biggest state-owned developer, rose 4.6 percent to HK$20.35, the
most in two months, while  Agile Property Holdings Ltd. (3383)  jumped
5.1 percent to HK$8.32.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
