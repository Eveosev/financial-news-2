Corn futures tumbled to a 32-month
low, while soybeans and wheat fell to the cheapest in a year,
after the government said U.S. farmers will plant more grain
than forecast and the largest oilseed crop ever.  Planting of corn, the biggest domestic crop, jumped to
97.379 million acres, the most since 1936, the  U.S. Department
of Agriculture  said today in a report. Analysts in a Bloomberg
survey expected 95.431 million. Wheat acreage reached a four-year high of 56.53 million, and soybeans were sown on a record
77.728 million. Corn dropped for the seventh straight session,
and wheat capped the longest slump since December 2009.  U.S. farmers, the world’s biggest growers of corn and
soybeans, are forecast by the USDA to produce record harvests
this year, while the  United Nations  predicts global wheat output
will be the highest ever. That will cut costs for buyers
including Archer-Daniels-Midland Co., the largest corn
processor, and Tyson Foods Inc., while curbing food prices down
9.5 percent from a record in February 2011.  “Farmers planted more corn, soybeans and wheat than almost
anyone expected after all the rain earlier this year,”  Dale Durchholz , the senior analyst at AgriVisor LLC in Bloomington,
 Illinois , said in a telephone interview. “The U.S. crop
potential is getting bigger, and that will keep the markets on
the defensive and put farmers in a more aggressive selling
mood.”  Corn futures for delivery in December tumbled 5.1 percent
to close at $5.11 a bushel at 1:15 p.m. on the  Chicago  Board of
Trade, the biggest decline for the price after the harvest since
March 28. The price touched $5.06, the lowest for the most-active contract since Oct. 8, 2010.  Soybeans, Wheat  Soybean futures for November delivery fell 1.8 percent to
$12.52 a bushel. Earlier, the oilseed touched $12.47, the lowest
since June 4, 2012.  Wheat futures for September delivery slid 2.4 percent to
$6.5775 a bushel. Earlier, the price touched $6.56, the lowest
since June 19, 2012. The grain dropped for seven straight
sessions.  Companies that use crops to make livestock feed, fuel and
food will benefit from the slump in futures, said Brett Hundley,
an analyst at Richmond, Virginia-based BB&T Capital Markets, a
research firm that makes stock recommendations on agribusiness
companies.  Lower Costs  “Much bigger numbers for corn acres are going to filter
their way through the food-supply chain,” Hundley said in a
telephone interview. “It will lower potential costs for protein
producers and corn-sweetener producers.”  In  New York ,  ADM (ADM)  shares rose 0.6 percent to $33.91 after
reaching $34.22, the highest since May 28. They have jumped 24
percent this year.  Tyson climbed 1.8 percent to $25.68. The stock has advanced
32 percent this year.  Increased corn sowing will boost stockpiles that fell to
the lowest in 16 years. Inventories on June 1 totaled 2.76
billion bushels, down 12 percent from the prior year and the
lowest since 1997, the USDA said today in a separate report.
Analysts forecast reserves at 2.862 billion bushels. In 2012,
the most-severe drought since the 1930s cut production.  July Premiums  The premiums for July corn and soybean futures above the
most-active contracts after the harvest surged to records after
the USDA confirmed shrinking inventories,  Roy Huckabay , an
executive vice president at the Linn Group in Chicago, said in a
telephone interview.  Today, the premiums surged 31 percent to $1.68 for corn and
14 percent to $3.13 for soybeans.  The increase in acreage and forecasts for no excessive rain
or extreme heat in the U.S. will boost crop prospects, Huckabay
said. Drier weather and warm temperatures in the next 10 days
will aid plant development from  Minnesota  to Illinois, where
some fields got more than three times the normal amount of rain
in the past month, Commodity Weather Group LLC in Bethesda,
 Maryland ,, said in a report.  About 65 percent of the corn was rated in good or excellent
 condition  on June 23, up from 56 percent a year earlier, and 65
percent of soybeans earned top  ratings  versus 53 percent, the
USDA said in a  report  this week.  “The market spreads are trying to slow demand for last
year’s supply, while factoring in a big crop this year,”
Huckabay said. “Corn and soybean supplies will be tight before
what should be record crops this year. Weather looks wet with
little heat and that means good yields.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
