American Superconductor Corp. (AMSC) , a
Devens, Massachusetts-based supplier of wind-turbine electrical
components, rose the most in 10 months after U.S. prosecutors
charged its former largest customer with stealing the company’s
technology.  AMSC gained 13 percent to $2.64 at the close in New York,
the most since Aug. 2.  Prosecutors secured an indictment of the Chinese turbine
maker Sinovel Wind Group Co., two of its executives and a former
AMSC engineer in in federal court in Madison,  Wisconsin ,
yesterday. The engineer, Dejan Karabasevic, pleaded guilty in
Austria to stealing AMSC source code for turbine controllers on
behalf of Sinovel.  AMSC, which lost more than $1 billion in market value after
the theft became public, is seeking $1.2 billion in damages in
Chinese courts. Sinovel accounted for 70 percent of AMSC’s sales
in 2009 and is accused of using stolen AMSC source code for
computer controllers inside turbines and violating sales
contracts.  To contact the reporter on this story:
