American Realty Capital Properties
Inc. (ARCP)  completed the purchase of 447 properties mainly used by
restaurants from  General Electric Co. (GE) ’s finance arm for $774
million after agreeing to take 24 sites out of the deal.  The buildings are mostly rented out to tenants that operate
national food chains including Arby’s, Burger King, Taco Bell,
and Wendy’s, American Realty said in a statement today. The deal
with  GE Capital  means the New York-based company has made about
$1.14 billion in acquisitions this year, American Realty said.  “These properties represent a diverse and accretive
addition to our best-in-class net lease real estate portfolio,”
Chief Executive Officer Nicholas Schorsch said in the statement
“We completed this transaction quickly while adding $366.6
million of other net lease properties in 2013.”  The real estate investment trust said its purchase of
 CapLease Inc. (LSE) , a deal valued at $2.2 billion including debt, is
expected to be completed by the end of the third quarter.
CapLease owns real estate across the U.S. ranging from single-tenant office buildings to distribution centers. American Realty
is expanding its portfolio of single-tenant buildings and said
it expects to own more than 1,250 properties once the CapLease
deal is concluded.  To contact the reporter on this story:
