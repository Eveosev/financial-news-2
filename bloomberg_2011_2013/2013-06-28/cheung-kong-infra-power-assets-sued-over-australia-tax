Cheung Kong Infrastructure Holdings
Ltd. (1038)  and  Power Assets Holdings Ltd. (6) , controlled by  Asia ’s
richest man  Li Ka-Shing , were sued by  Australia  over unpaid
taxes, interest and penalties of A$760 million ($705 million).  The two companies owe taxes from 2000 to 2009, according to
complaints filed June 14 in federal court in Melbourne. Cheung

network  owners  in Victoria, holding a 51 percent stake in two
distribution networks, according to the Australian power
regulator. They also have a 200-year lease on South Australia’s
distribution network.  Australia’s Deputy Commissioner of Taxation sought a court
order for Cheung Kong Infrastructure to pay A$305 million in
taxes and interest and administrative penalties of A$67.8
million, according to the filing. The tax agency sought an order
against Power Assets to pay A$316 million in taxes and interest
and A$71.8 million in administrative penalties.  Both companies deny owing the taxes, according to Wendy Tong Barnes, a spokeswoman at Cheung Kong Infrastructure. The
agency’s claims are “without foundation” and the companies
will defend against the lawsuit, Tong Barnes said in an e-mailed
statement today.  The companies haven’t filed statements of defense,
according to the court’s website.  Power Lines  Cheung Kong Infrastructure and Power Assets have a 51
