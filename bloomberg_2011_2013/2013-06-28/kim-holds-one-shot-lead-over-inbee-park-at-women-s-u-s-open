Ha-Neul Kim holds a one-shot lead
over fellow South Korean Inbee Park after the first round of the
Women’s  U.S. Open  golf championship.  Kim had a 6-under-par 66 yesterday at Sebonack Golf Club in
Southampton,  New York . Park, who won the title in 2008, is a
shot ahead of a group of players at 4 under that includes
Lizette Salas of the U.S. and Swedes Caroline Hedwall and Anna Nordqvist.  Park, 24, is seeking to become the first player to win the
first three women’s major championships of the year when there
were at least four played. The world No. 1 won the LPGA
Championship this month to add to her success at the Kraft
Nabisco Championship, the first of women’s golf’s five majors
this season. She has four victories in 10 prior starts this
year.  Golfers from  South Korea  have won the past two editions of
the Women’s U.S. Open and four of the past five. Defending
champion Na Yeon Choi is at 1 under, two shots ahead of her
countrywoman So Yeon Ryu, who won the tournament in 2011.  Paula Creamer, the last American champion in 2010, is in a
tie for 28th place at even par.  To contact the reporter on this story:
