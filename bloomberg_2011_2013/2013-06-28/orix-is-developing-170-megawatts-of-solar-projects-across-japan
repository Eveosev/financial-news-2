Orix Corp. (8591) , a Japanese finance and
leasing company, said itâ€™s developing more than 170 megawatts of
solar power projects in  Japan .  Twenty eight large-scale solar stations will have a
combined capacity of 143.2 megawatts, while 49 rooftop projects
will produce 27.2 megawatts, the company said today in a
 statement.   The announcement came after Japan introduced an incentive
program for clean energy such as solar, wind and geothermal in
July following the 2011 Fukushima nuclear disaster.  The company seeks to develop a total of 400 megawatts of
solar projects, including 100 megawatts of rooftop projects, by
March 2015, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
