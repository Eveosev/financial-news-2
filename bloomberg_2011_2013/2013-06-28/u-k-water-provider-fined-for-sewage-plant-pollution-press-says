South West Water Ltd., a U.K. water
provider, was fined for so poorly repairing a sewage plant in
North Devon that waters in a nearby stream became half the
strength of raw effluent, the Western Daily Press reported.  The unit of  Pennon Group Plc (PNN)  that supplies water and sewer
services to 1.6 million customers was ordered to pay 12,100
pounds ($18,400) in fines and costs. The utility pleaded guilty
in court to two offenses related to repairs that an Environment
Agency officer said included using black garbage bags and
plastic ties to seal a pipe at the Hollocombe sewage facility
and contaminating waterways, the Daily Press said today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
