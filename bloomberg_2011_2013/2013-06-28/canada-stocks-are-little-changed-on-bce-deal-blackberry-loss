Canadian  stocks  were little changed,
with the benchmark equity gauge on track for the first quarterly
loss in a year, as a rally among phone companies offset the
biggest loss in six months at BlackBerry.  BCE Inc. (BCE) ,  Canada ’s largest telephone company, rose 2.3
percent after the nation’s media regulator yesterday approved
its bid to acquire Astral Media Inc. in a C$3 billion deal.
Astral, a Quebec broadcaster, gained 3.6 percent. BlackBerry
plunged 26 percent after reporting a first-quarter loss amid
poor sales of its BB10 smartphones.  The  Standard & Poor’s/TSX Composite Index (SPTSX)  rose 10.24
points, or 0.1 percent, to 12,016.02 at 10:05 a.m. in Toronto.
The gauge has lost 5 percent this month, erasing its gain for
2013, and is down 5.8 percent in the second quarter.  Half of the 10 groups in the S&P/TSX advanced today, with
phone stocks gaining 2.3 percent. Technology stocks, which
include  BlackBerry (BB) , slumped 7.1 percent, the most in 21 months.  Canada’s  gross domestic product  grew for a fourth straight
month in April, rising 0.1 percent. The gain marks the longest
string of monthly expansions since September 2011, signaling a
further revival from a slump in the second half of last year
that was led by investment and exports.  To contact the reporter on this story:
