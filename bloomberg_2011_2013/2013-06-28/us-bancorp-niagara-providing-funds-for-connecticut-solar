(Corrects role of bank in first paragraph, funding amount
in second.)    US Bancorp (USB)  and  First Niagara
Financial Group Inc. (FNFG)  are part of a group of banks that agreed to
provide $26.7 million in debt financing to build rooftop solar
projects in Connecticut.  The state will also contribute $9.5 million through its
 Clean Energy Finance and Investment Authority , the agency said
today in a statement. It expects the program to attract a tax-equity investor, leading to about $60 million in total funding
that will support rooftop power plants on about 1,500 homes and
40 businesses.  The agency is offering a financing alternative to solar
leases offered by companies such as  SolarCity Inc. (SCTY)  and  SunPower
Corp. (SPWR)  That will let customers choose installers, which will
boost competition and reduce costs, according to Bert Hunter,
chief investment officer at Rocky Hill, Connecticut-based CEFIA.  “More installers with more access to capital is going to
lead to a more cost-competitive product for homeowners,” Hunter
said in an interview yesterday.  The average installed cost of solar systems in the state is
about $4.50 a watt, and the agency is seeking to drive that down
to below $4 a watt by the end of the year, he said.  Webster Financial Corp., Liberty Bank and Peoples United
Bank are also providing the funding. AFC First Financial Corp.
will service the loans and and  Assurant Inc. (AIZ)  will insure the
systems. The program will also cover the installation of about
400 solar water-heating systems.  To contact the reporter on this story:
