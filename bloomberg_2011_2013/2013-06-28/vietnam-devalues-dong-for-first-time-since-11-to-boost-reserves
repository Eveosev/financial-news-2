Vietnam ’s central bank devalued its
currency for the first time since 2011 and cut the interest-rate
cap on dollar deposits to help “improve” the balance of
payments and boost foreign-exchange reserves.  The  State Bank  of Vietnam weakened its  reference rate  by 1
percent to 21,036 dong per dollar, effective today, according to
a statement released yesterday. The currency, which can trade as
much as 1 percent either side of the rate, fell 0.9 percent to
21,205 as of 4:57 p.m. at banks in Hanoi, the most since Aug. 9,
2011, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The fixing has
been kept at 20,828 since Dec. 26, 2011, and the spot rate
touched a record 21,036, the lower limit of the band, on most
days in June.  The change in the  reference rate  is the biggest since a
record 8.5 percent cut in February 2011 and comes after the
government announced yesterday that imports exceeded exports by
$1.4 billion in the first half of this year. The economy 
expanded  4.9 percent in the first six months from a year earlier,
official data show. The government’s full-year growth target of
5.5 percent “will be extremely difficult to meet,” Do Thuc,
head of the General Statistics Office, said yesterday in Hanoi.  “The  trade balance  has swung back into deficit,”  Tim Condon , head of Asian research at ING Groep NV in  Singapore ,
wrote in a note today. “Devaluation is the standard policy
response when this happens.”  Bond Fell  Vietnam’s government bonds fell today, with the benchmark
five-year yield rising 10 basis points, or 0.1 percentage point,
to 8.05 percent, according to a daily fixing from banks compiled
by Bloomberg. The three-year yield climbed six basis points to
7.23 percent.  The Southeast Asian nation’s economy expanded 5 percent
last year, the slowest since 1999, according to government data,
after growing 5.9 percent in 2011 and 6.8 percent in 2010  The central bank bought $18 billion to boost its foreign-exchange reserves in 2012, Saigon Times reported Feb. 21, citing
Governor Nguyen Van Binh. A further $3.18 billion was purchased
in the first quarter of 2013, lifting holdings to the equivalent
of 12 weeks of imports, VnEconomy reported April 26, citing a
report by State Bank of Vietnam.  The reference rate’s adjustment is “to more accurately
reflect the supply and demand of foreign currency in the
market” and to “create stability,” the central bank said in
the statement. Consumer prices rose 6.69 percent in June from a
year earlier, the most since February, official data show.  Deposit Caps  “One key risk is that a pickup in inflation and concerns
about further devaluation could intensify dollarization
pressures, leading to a self-fulfilling VND depreciation
spiral,”  Vishnu Varathan , a Singapore-based economist at Mizuho
Corporate Bank Ltd., wrote in a research note today.  The central bank cut the cap on corporate dollar deposits
to 0.25 percent from 0.5 percent for all tenors and reduced the
limit for household savings to 1.25 percent from 2 percent, the
regulator said on its website yesterday.  The maximum rate for dong deposits was also lowered to spur
spending and investment, the central bank said in the statement.
The ceiling for deposits of less than one month fell to 1.2
percent from 2 percent, while that for periods of up to six
months declined to 7 percent from 7.5 percent.  The rate-cap reductions are intended “to curb deposit and
lending rates at reasonable levels to help stabilize the money
market and the foreign-currency market and to continue
implementing measures to help resolve difficulties for
businesses and production,” the central bank said in the
statement. “Businesses and production still have a lot of
difficulties because consumption in the market is still at low
levels and companies’ ability to absorb bank loans is still
limited.”  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
