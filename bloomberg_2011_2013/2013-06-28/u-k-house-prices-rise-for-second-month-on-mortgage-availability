U.K. house prices  rose for a second
month June as mortgage availability improved, pushing the annual
gain in values to the highest since September 2010,  Nationwide
Building Society  said.  Prices rose 0.3 percent from the previous month, when they
advanced 0.4 percent, the Swindon, England-based customer-owned
lender said in an e-mailed statement today. The average value
last month was 168,941 pounds ($257,300), up 1.9 percent from a
year earlier.  “Demand for homes has been supported by further modest
gains in employment, as well as an improvement in the
availability and a reduction in the cost of credit, partly as a
result of policy measures,” said  Robert Gardner , chief
economist at Nationwide. “Signs of a modest improvement in
wider economic conditions may also be playing a role.”  A report today showed  consumer confidence  rose to the
highest in two years this month. The economy resumed expansion
in the first quarter and Bank of England Governor  Mervyn King 
said this week that an economic recovery is “in sight.”  In the three months through June,  home prices  increased 0.4
percent from the previous quarter and 1.4 percent from a year
earlier, according to Nationwide. London remained the U.K.’s
most expensive market and recorded the biggest annual increase
in prices.  Nationally,  house prices  are around 9 percent below their
pre-crisis peak, Nationwide said. London house prices are 5
percent above their pre-crisis level.  To contact the reporter on this story:
