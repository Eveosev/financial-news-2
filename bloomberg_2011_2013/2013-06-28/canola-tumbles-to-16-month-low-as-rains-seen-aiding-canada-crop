Canola futures fell to a 16-month
low in Winnipeg on speculation that wet weather across the
Canadian Prairies is improving crop conditions and yield
prospects.  Farmers in  Canada  probably will boost production by 6
percent to 14.1 million metric tons in the year that starts Aug.
1, the government said in a June 14 report. Alberta said June 26
that crops in the province avoided widespread damage from heavy
rain and flooding this month.  Saskatchewan , which will plant
about half the nation’s canola fields this year, said yesterday
that the majority of its crops are in fair-to-excellent
condition, even after excess rains.  “In a lot of the areas where you’re getting timely rains
and heat, the crop is advancing quite quickly and the prospect
for big yields is looking very promising,” Darcy Caners, a
business manager with MarketLink Brokerage Solutions, said in a
telephone interview from Winnipeg.  Canola futures for November settlement fell 1.3 percent to
close at C$534.80 ($508.41) a ton at 1:35 p.m. on the ICE
Futures Exchange in Winnipeg, after reaching $533, the lowest
for a most-active contract since Feb. 10, 2012. Prices are down
9.3 percent this year.  The price of soybeans, which compete with canola among
buyers of vegetable oils and  animal feed , have dropped 11
percent this year. Soybean futures for November delivery, after
the U.S. harvest, declined 1.8 percent today to close at $12.52
a bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade, after touching the
$12.47, the lowest since June 4, 2012.  To contact the reporter on this story:
