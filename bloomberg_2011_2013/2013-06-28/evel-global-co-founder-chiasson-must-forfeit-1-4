Level Global Investors LP co-founder
Anthony Chiasson, who was sentenced to 6 1/2 years in prison for
using illegal tips to make more than $68 million for his hedge
fund, was ordered to forfeit $1.4 million.  U.S. District Judge Richard Sullivan, who sentenced
Chiasson in May, set the forfeiture amount yesterday in a
written order in federal court in Manhattan. Chiasson was
convicted after a trial in 2012 of conspiracy and securities
fraud for trading on illegal tips on  Dell Inc. (DELL)  and  Nvidia Corp. (NVDA)   Sullivan said in yesterday’s order that he erred when he
imposed a $5 million fine when sentencing Chiasson. That amount
should have been no bigger than $1.25 million, the judge said.  Chiasson’s co-defendant at trial, former Diamondback
Capital Management LLC portfolio manager Todd Newman, was also
found guilty. He was sentenced by Sullivan to 4 1/2 years in
prison. Both men have appealed.  A federal appeals court in Manhattan ruled June 18 that
Chiasson and Newman may remain free while they appeal their
convictions.  The case is U.S. v. Chiasson, 1:12-cr-00121, U.S. District
Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
