China  may pick Ding Xuedong, a
deputy secretary-general of the State Council, the nation’s
cabinet, to head its sovereign wealth fund, the Wall Street
Journal reported today, citing unidentified people.  Top leaders are expected to name Ding to succeed  Lou Jiwei ,
who’s now finance minister, as chairman of Beijing-based China
Investment Corp., the newspaper reported, citing people with
knowledge of the matter.  The fund with more than $480 billion in assets hasn’t had a
new chairman since Lou was appointed finance minister in March.
Two candidates -- Shanghai Vice Mayor Tu Guangshao and People’s
Bank of China Deputy Governor  Yi Gang  -- declined the position
because of concerns they may be blamed for investments that end
up poorly, the Financial Times reported last month, citing
unidentified people.  Ding, 53, was a deputy finance minister when he was
appointed to his current job three years ago after more than 10
years at the ministry, according to a resume published by Xinhua
News Agency. He holds a doctorate in economics from the finance
ministry’s research institute, according to Xinhua.  An e-mail sent to CIC’s Beijing-based press office wasn’t
immediately answered.  To contact the Bloomberg News staff on this story:
