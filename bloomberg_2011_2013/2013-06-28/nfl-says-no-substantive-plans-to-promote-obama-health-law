The National Football League hasn’t
engaged in talks with the Obama administration to help promote
the 2010 health law, a league spokesman said, contradicting
earlier remarks by Kathleen Sebelius, the U.S. health secretary.  Sebelius told reporters on June 24 that her department had
reached out to the NFL and other professional sports leagues to
discuss a partnership to help market the Affordable Care Act.
The administration especially wants to reach healthy young men,
part of the NFL’s fan base, whose enrollment in new insurance
plans to be offered starting Oct. 1 is seen as crucial to the
law’s success.  U.S. Senators Mitch McConnell of  Kentucky  and John Cornyn
of  Texas , the top two Republicans in the Senate, wrote yesterday
to six professional sports organizations including the NFL to
warn them against promoting the “deeply divisive and
unpopular” law.  Greg Aiello, a spokesman for the NFL, said the league
informed the senators that “we currently have no plans to
engage in this area and have had no substantive contact with the
administration” about the law’s implementation.  Sebelius, on June 24, said the NFL was “actively and
enthusiastically engaged” with the administration about
advertising and other promotional efforts.  Told his statement contradicted the secretary’s remarks,
Aiello said, “We have nothing to add to our statement.”  A spokeswoman for Sebelius, Joanne Peters, declined to
comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
