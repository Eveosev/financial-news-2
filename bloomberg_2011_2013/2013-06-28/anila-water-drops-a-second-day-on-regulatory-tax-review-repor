Manila Water Co. (MWC) , which supplies
half of the Philippine capital, fell for a second day after a
regulator said the practice of water utilities passing taxes
onto consumers is under review.  Metropolitan Waterworks considers it a “grossly unjust”
practice that water companies pass the costs of a tax onto
customers and that this is under review, ABS-CBN News cited
acting chief regulator Emmanuel Caparas as saying.  The stock dropped 2 percent to 32.40 pesos today. The Ayala
Corp.-led company, whose shares have risen 31 percent over the
past year, provides water services to 6.2 million residents in
Manila and the Quezon City area.  Manila Water meanwhile plans to spend 346 million pesos ($8
million) for a 3.2-kilometer (2-mile) sewer network to benefit a
half-million residents in San Mateo, Rizal and Marikina City
that’s set to be finished within a year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
