Cattle grazing and clean water can
co-exist on public lands such as national forests without
causing “hot spots of human health risk,” according to
research by the  University of California , Davis.  About 1.8 million livestock graze on national forest lands
popular for recreation in the western U.S. each year, according
to the study published yesterday in the journal Plos One that
was conducted in 2011.  “There’s been a lot of concern about public lands and water
quality, especially with cattle grazing,” said Leslie Roche, a
postdoctoral candidate in UC Davis’s Department of Plant
Sciences who co-wrote the study. “We’re able to show that
livestock grazing, public recreation and the provisioning of
clean water can be compatible goals.”  Researchers analyzed water samples including fecal bacteria
from streams along with ranchers, Forest Service staff and
environmentalists from 155 sites across five national forests
and recreational lands in northern  California .  “There is no real evidence that we’re creating hot
spots of human health risk with livestock grazing in these
areas,” Kenneth Tate, a Cooperative Extension specialist in UC
Davis’s plant sciences department, said in a statement.  To read the study: { http://bit.ly/11G9Adv }  To contact the reporter on this story:
