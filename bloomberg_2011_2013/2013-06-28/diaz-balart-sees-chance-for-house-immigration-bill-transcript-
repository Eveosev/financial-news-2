Representative Mario Diaz-Balart, a
Republican advocate for revising U.S. immigration laws, said in
an interview with Bloomberg’s  Hans Nichols , airing this weekend
on Bloomberg Television’s “Political Capital with  Al Hunt ,”
that a comprehensive proposal can overcome opposition from his
party and pass the House.  (This is not a legal transcript. Bloomberg LP cannot
guarantee its accuracy.)  HANS NICHOLS: Welcome back. I’m now joined by Congressman
Mario Diaz-Balart from  Florida . Congressman, thanks for joining
us here in the Bloomberg offices.  Speaker Boehner put down a bit of a marker, the majority of
the majority rule. Is that essentially the pre-obituary for
immigration reform in the House?  MARIO DIAZ-BALART: No, absolutely not. Something this
complex, this controversial has to be done, in my opinion, in a
bipartisan way, which means I think you have to get the majority
of the Republicans, you have to get hopefully the majority of
the minority, of the Democrats. This is too complex, too
difficult, too controversial to try to believe that we can ram
it down anybody’s throat.  You know, we’ve been there before
with our previous bills -  NICHOLS: With 2006.  DIAZ-BALART: - and with Democrats - with the Democrats
controlling. That’s just not the way to do this.  NICHOLS: OK. So give us a status update of the Gang of
Seven. Where are you?  DIAZ-BALART: We’re working. I think we - I mean, we’ve -the
bill has already been sent to drafting to leg counsel,
legislative counsel. It’s back. Now we have to go through line
by line, you know, comma, period. We’re doing that. And it’s a
long, arduous, difficult process.  NICHOLS: Well, how long - how long is it going to be? How -
I mean, what’s your timeline on this?  DIAZ-BALART: We’ve never had a real deadline. Our deadline
- our - our -  NICHOLS: Deadlines can be forcing. They can help.  DIAZ-BALART: They can. But - but here’s the good news. We
finalized it. It’s already now been drafted. We’ve just got to
make sure that all the agreements that we made are reflected
exactly as we agreed to them in the drafting. And so - and it
just takes time. It just takes time.  NICHOLS: So total agreement, there’s nothing left in
parentheses that you still have to work out?  DIAZ-BALART: Yeah, we don’t think so. We don’t think so.
Now, again, once we might find things in the draft that all of a
sudden we disagree with, but so far, everything’s going well.  NICHOLS: OK, give us some details of what’s in the draft. I
know you can’t get too far out there, but - but show us what you
can.  DIAZ-BALART: Here’s - look, this is what - what’s - what
are we trying to fix? What’s the problem? The problem is that we
have an immigration system that doesn’t work. You know, we don’t
control who comes in, who leaves. It doesn’t work for our
economy. We don’t have a visa system that works. You can’t,
frankly, come to the  United States  legally to - to work, not to
mention live. It’s almost impossible, which is an incentive for
illegal immigration.  Whether it’s high-tech visas, whether it’s low-skilled
visas, whether it’s - you name it, it’s not working. And
clearly, we don’t control our borders. How do I know that?
Because we have 10 million or 11 million people who are here
undocumented. Today it’s 10 million or 11 million. Tomorrow it
may be 30 million. We don’t control that.  So that’s the problem that we recognize is there. To fix
it, I think we need to do so in a way that is enforceable, that
we finally control the borders, not in a wink-and-nod way, but
that the borders are truly enforced and - enforceable and
enforced, No. 2, that we do not violate the rule of law. No. 3
is that it helps the economy. Not neutral, it has to help the
economy.  And then we have to deal with the reality, whether we like
it or not, that there are millions of people who are here, we
have to figure out a way to come out of the shadows. Those that
have committed crimes have to be dealt with in one way: zero
tolerance. They’ve got to be out of here. And then give those
who have been here for many, many years, who have been working,
a way to earn their way into legalization.  NICHOLS: But this is the big sticking point, the pathway to
citizenship. Can that element get a majority of support in the
current Republican House conference?  DIAZ-BALART: I think it’s important to have a process that
- that - here’s -  NICHOLS: But the problem - having a process isn’t a yes or
no.  DIAZ-BALART: Well, I know that. But here’s - because here
are the policy implications. On the one side, I think it would
be horrible for our country to have a group of people who are
here permanently and those who really - you know, those that
want to put their hands on their heart and pledge alliance to
our flag and everything that it stands for, do we really want a
group of people, maybe millions of them who are here permanently
and who are always in the shadows, and you can never do that. I
don’t think so.  Now, how do you reconcile that with making sure that we’ll
not violate the rule of law and the rights of folks who have
done things legally? Is it impossible to do? No, I think - I
think we’ve done it in our group. I think in our group, in a
bipartisan way, we’ve come up with a way that solves that issue.  NICHOLS: It’s bipartisan, but you did lose a member, and
that’s sort of emblematic of some of the problems you’ll be
having when you try to get a majority of a majority. You just
gave - given an argument. How do you convince your fellow
Republicans that this is the right thing to do, a pathway to
citizenship?  DIAZ-BALART: It is our challenge to make sure that - to be
able to show the country, by the way, you know, Republicans,
Democrats, the country, that - that we have a real solution to
what is evidently a broken system. It has to be enforceable. It
has to be real. The people have to feel and understand that it’s
real. It can’t be a wink and a nod.  If we do that, I think - it’s our challenge to do that. And
if we’re able to do that, I think we’re going to get the
majority of Republicans and the majority of Democrats.  NICHOLS: Handicap it for me. Just give me some odds.  DIAZ-BALART: It’s a very difficult battle. It’s an uphill
battle. But I’m optimistic.  NICHOLS: Optimistic, but - I mean, what’s the cause for
optimism, I guess?  When you see - when you look at the number
of no votes in the Senate -  DIAZ-BALART: Yeah.  NICHOLS: - you look at some of the language, that the
border security isn’t quite real, the House is always going to
be a tougher push.  DIAZ-BALART:  The House was always going to be a tougher
place, more people, you know, more diverse. But here’s the
reality. You know, I’ve been in this for a long time. I’ve been
working with members from both parties, our colleagues in the
House. The vast majority of House members from either party want
to fix it. They understand it’s a broken immigration system.
It’s our challenge to be able to present something, an
alternative, that does it in a way that they feel comfortable.
That’s our challenge; I think we can get there.  NICHOLS: And the big difference between now and 2006, when
we had a similar dynamic pass in the Senate, fails in the House,
the changes?  DIAZ-BALART: Look, between 2006 and now, the system is
still broken. We have millions of people here who are still
undocumented. We don’t control the borders. That’s hurting our
economy.  So -  NICHOLS: It’s hurting your party.  DIAZ-BALART: It’s hurting our party, but it’s hurting the
country, which is even more important, even though hurting the
party I think is important. But it’s hurting the country.  So I think, again, what is pretty evident is that doing
nothing doesn’t solve it. Those who are concerned about amnesty,
doing nothing is amnesty. Doing nothing doesn’t fix it. Stopping
- or securing the borders, we have to pass legislation to do
that.  Do we have a proposal that I think people will feel
comfortable with, the majority of people will feel comfortable
with? I hope so. I think so. That’s why we spent so much time
and so much effort. But doing nothing is the one option which I
think most people recognize doesn’t work.  NICHOLS: When will we know that this is going to - that
this may or may not pass? What’s - what’s - what’s -in
September, October?  DIAZ-BALART: You’re going to see ups and downs. You’re
going to see ugly things. You’re going to see things that we
don’t like.  Ultimately, however, I’m optimistic that the vast
majority of the members in the House and the Senate, and the
country, more importantly, recognize that we have a system that
doesn’t work and ultimately, when push comes to shove, I think -
in order to pass legislation, I think there’d have to be
something similar to what we’ve been working on. Ultimately, I
think what will prevail is the desire to fix a system that
everybody recognizes is broken.  NICHOLS: Congressman, I’m going to take your qualified
optimism without a timeline. Thank you for your time.  ***END OF TRANSCRIPT***  THIS TRANSCRIPT MAY NOT BE 100% ACCURATE AND MAY CONTAIN
