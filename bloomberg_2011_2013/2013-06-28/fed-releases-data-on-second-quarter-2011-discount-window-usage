The  Federal Reserve  made 740 loans
from its discount window in the second quarter of 2011,
according to data released by the Fed today.  The largest loan made during the quarter was an overnight
loan of $60 million to  First National Bank  in  Sioux Falls ,  South
Dakota . The lending was little used in the second quarter of
2011, according to data previously released on the Fed’s weekly
balance sheet report, with weekly borrowing never exceeding $66
million. By contrast, during the financial crisis, borrowing
from the facility peaked at $111 billion.  The discount window is the Fed’s main tool for providing
cash to banks that have temporary funding shortfalls. The loans
are fully collateralized and made by the system’s 12 reserve
banks. The discount  rate  has been at 0.75 percent since February
2010. The Fed releases the once-secret data with a two-year lag
every quarter as required by the 2010 Dodd-Frank Act.  The data released today provides the name of banks that
borrowed from the Fed, the value of the collateral on the loan,
the terms of their loan and when it was repaid.  To contact the reporter on this story:
