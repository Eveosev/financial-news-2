The U.S. energy  rig count  declined
to the lowest level in two months this week, according to  Baker
Hughes Inc. (BHI)   The total count fell by 11 to 1,748, the Houston-based
field services company said on its website.  Oil rigs  dropped by
15 to 1,390, a nine-week low. Gas rigs rose by four to 353, the
first increase in six weeks.  A resurgence in U.S. gas and oil output, driven largely by
hydraulic fracturing and horizontal drilling, helped the nation
meet 89 percent of its energy needs in March, the highest
monthly rate since April 1986, Energy Information Administration
data show. Soaring supplies and more efficient techniques such
as pad drilling have driven the energy rig count down from more
than 2,000 in early 2012.  Exploration and production companies in the U.S. were
expected to cut  capital expenditures  by 2.1 percent this quarter
from a year ago “driven by a focus on pad drilling and cost
cutting, as well as lower levels of natural gas drilling,”
according to a Bloomberg Industries analysis released yesterday.
Pad drilling lets producers put in multiple wells at a single
site.  Natural gas for August delivery declined 1.2 cents to $3.57
per million British thermal units on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange  at 1:11 p.m.  New York  time, up 31 percent from a year
ago.  U.S. gas stockpiles  rose 95 billion cubic feet in the week
ended June 21 to 2.533 trillion cubic feet, 17.1 percent below a
year earlier, the EIA, the Energy Department’s statistical arm,
said yesterday. Supply gains have topped five-year averages for
four straight weeks as mild weather reduced demand.  Oil Output  U.S. oil output gained 1.9 percent to 7.26 million barrels
a day last week, EIA data show. Production reached 7.37 million
barrels a day in the week ended May 3, the most since 1992.
Stockpiles climbed 18,000 barrels to 394.1 million, according to
the EIA.  Crude for August delivery rose 35 cents to $97.40 a barrel
today on the Nymex, up 25 percent in the past year.  Anadarko Petroleum Corp. (APC) , an independent oil and gas
producer, will increase its U.S. onshore production by 10
percent to 570,000 barrels of oil equivalent a day, according to
a presentation the company made at the Global Hunter Securities
Energy Conference in Chicago June 26.  “And what’s stunning about it is we’re able to do this
with 45 rigs,” John Colglazier, vice president of  investor
relations  for the Woodlands, Texas-based company, said at the
conference. “It’s extraordinarily capital-efficient.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
