Two men charged with murdering
British soldier Lee Rigby outside his army barracks in southeast
 London  will stand trial on Nov. 18.  Michael Adebolajo, 28, and Michael Adebowale, 22, appeared
at a hearing today at a London criminal court by video link from
separate rooms at Belmarsh prison, where theyâ€™re being held.
They spoke only to confirm their names.  The men are charged with killing Rigby, who was 25, on May
22 in an attack that police are treating as an act of terrorism.
Both suspects, who were shot and wounded by police at the scene,
were treated in separate hospitals before being charged with
murder. Adebolajo was also charged with the attempted murder of
two police officers.  Rigby, who had a 2-year-old son, was a drummer in the 2nd
Battalion of the Royal Regiment of Fusiliers. A fan of the
Manchester United soccer team, he served as a machine gunner in
Cyprus and then in 2009 as a member of a fire support group in
Helmand province,  Afghanistan .  To contact the reporter on this story:
