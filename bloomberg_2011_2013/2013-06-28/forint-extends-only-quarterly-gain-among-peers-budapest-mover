The forint strengthened, extending
the only rally among emerging-market currencies in the second
quarter, after  Hungary ’s current account surplus widened more
than expected.  The currency appreciated 0.3 percent to 295.29 against the
euro by 11:28 a.m. in Budapest, headed for a 0.5 percent advance
in June and rally of 3 percent since the end of March. Yields on
the government’s benchmark 10-year bonds fell 13 basis points,
or 0.13 percentage point, to 6.173 percent, the lowest in more
than a week.  The current-account  surplus  came in at 549 million euros
($717 million) in the first three months of the year, the
central bank said on its website today. That compares with a 125
million-euro estimate in a Bloomberg survey. The data confirms
improvement in the external balances of Hungary, the most
indebted of the European Union’s eastern members, Erste Group
Bank AG said in an e-mailed note.  “The current-account balance data came out amazingly
strong,” Karoly Bamli, a Budapest-based currency trader at
Commerzbank AG, wrote in an e-mail today. “The forint started
to soar on the continued recovery in  market sentiment  and the
above data.”  The forint is the only currency among 24  emerging markets 
to post a gain this quarter, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
