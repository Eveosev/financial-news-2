Lotte Chemical Corp. (011170)  bought two
naphtha cargoes for delivery to South Korea in the first half of
August, according to two traders who participate in the market.  The Seoul-based company bought a total of 50,000 metric
tons of the fuel at a premium of $2 a ton to benchmark Japan
prices, the traders said, asking not to be identified because
the information is confidential. The purchase was made earlier
this week.  To contact the reporter on this story:
