Treasury 10-year notes fell, pushing
yields toward the highest levels since 2011, after a comment by
Federal Reserve Governor Jeremy Stein fueled speculation the
central bank may start to reduce its bond buying in September.  Bonds extended a loss earlier as Richmond Fed Bank
President Jeffrey Lacker said he’s against continuing bond
purchases. Stein said policy makers should concentrate on the
amount of economic progress made since the buying program began
“in making a decision in, say, September.” Fed Chairman Ben S.
Bernanke said June 19 bond purchases may be cut this year and
ended in 2014 if growth is in line with central-bank estimates.  “The markets have been very volatile, and they remain very
sensitive to Fed communication and economic data,” said Gary Pollack, who manages $12 billion as head of fixed-income trading
at Deutsche Bank AG’s Private Wealth Management unit in New
York. “These levels are justified as the market prices in more
normal yields without participation by the Fed. The market is
not patient, as no one wants to be the last one out the door.”  Benchmark 10-year yields rose one basis point, or 0.01
percentage point, to 2.49 percent at 5 p.m. New York time, after
reaching 2.55 percent, according to Bloomberg Bond Trader
prices. They touched 2.66 percent on June 24, the highest since
August 2011. The yields fell five basis points  this week .  The price of the 1.75 percent securities due in May 2023
declined 3/32, or 94 cents per $1,000 face amount, to 93 19/32.  Thirty-year (USGG30YR)  yields rose as much as four basis points to
3.58 percent before declining to 3.5 percent. They touched 3.65
percent on June 24, the highest since September 2011.  Net Short  Hedge-fund managers and other large speculators increased
their  net-short  position in 30-year bond futures to the most
since March 2012, according to U.S. Commodity Futures Trading
Commission data. Speculative short positions, or bets prices
will fall, outnumbered long positions by 29,604 contracts on the
Chicago Board of Trade in the week ending June 25.  Speculators increased their net-long position in 10-year
note futures, which outnumbered short positions by 33,011
contracts on the Chicago Board of Trade.  Treasuries pared losses after the MNI Chicago Report’s
business  barometer  declined to 51.6 this month, from 58.7 in
May. A reading of 50 is the dividing line between expansion and
contraction. The median forecast of economists in a Bloomberg
survey was for 55.  The Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan final  index (BUSY)  of
U.S. consumer sentiment fell to 84.1 in June from 84.5 in May.  June Loss  Treasuries lost 1.4 percent this month through yesterday,
according to the Bloomberg U.S. Treasury Bond Index. The
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index returned 14 percent in that period,
including reinvested dividends. U.S. government securities have
slid 2.3 percent this quarter and 2.6 percent this year, the
Bank of America Merrill Lynch U.S. Treasury Index showed.  Stein said Fed officials should not put undue weight on the
most recent releases of economic data. They should “be clear
that in making a decision in, say, September, it will give
primary weight to the large stock of news that has accumulated
since the inception of the program and will not be unduly
influenced by whatever data releases arrive in the few weeks
before the meeting,” Stein said in a speech in New York.  “The use of the word September has got people in a bit of
a tizzy,” said Dan Mulholland, head of Treasury trading at BNY
Mellon Capital Markets in New York.  Remain Volatile  Lacker said he opposes continuing asset purchases because
they aren’t worth the risk, and that markets will remain
volatile as policy makers debate how and when to curtail the
program. Speaking at a judicial conference in White Sulphur
Springs, West Virginia, Lacker said financial markets will
remain volatile as policy makers debate how and when to curtail
bond buying.  San Francisco Fed President John Williams, who has never
dissented from a policy decision, said “it’s still too early”
for the central bank to begin trimming bond-buying.  Volatility in Treasuries as measured by the Merrill Lynch
Option Volatility MOVE Index climbed to 110.98 on June 24, the
highest level since November 2011. It was at 97.13 yesterday,
versus an average of 62.9 over the past year.  Fed policy makers at their June 18-19 meeting  forecast 
economic growth of as much as 2.6 percent this year and 3.5
percent in 2014.  The central bank is purchasing $85 billion of Treasuries
and mortgage bonds every month to put downward pressure on
borrowing costs during the third round of its quantitative-easing stimulus program. It bought $1.5 billion in Treasuries
today maturing from February 2036 to November 2042, from $2.8
billion submitted by dealers.  Benchmark Rate  The Fed has kept its benchmark  interest-rate  target at zero
to 0.25 percent since 2008 to support the economy.  “While the Fed debate continues to be influenced by
headlines from a variety of Fed speakers, the takeaway at this
point is that we are in a largely data-dependent mode with more
than a couple of months of inputs to come before it’s clear
whether tapering will begin,” said  Ian Lyngen , a government-bond strategist at CRT Capital Group LLC in  Stamford ,
 Connecticut .  Labor Department data next week will show employers added
165,000 workers in June, after payrolls swelled by 175,000 in
May, and the unemployment rate fell to 7.5 percent, from 7.6
percent, according to Bloomberg surveys of economists before the
figures are released on July 5.  “Our forecasts for U.S. payrolls to rise by 165,000 and
for a tenth to be shaved off the unemployment rate are unlikely
to shake-up expectations of the taper track,” Bank of America
Merrill Lynch strategists including Michelle Meyer in New York
wrote in an e-mailed report today. “This should allow U.S.
rates volatility to calm somewhat.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
