Arkansas Best Corp. (ABFS)  surged to the
highest price in almost two years after Teamsters at the
trucking company approved a five-year contract that will reduce
labor costs.  Arkansas Best jumped 15 percent to $22.95 at the close in
 New York , the highest price since August 2011.  The International Brotherhood of Teamsters at ABF Freight
System Inc., Arkansas Best’s largest unit, voted in favor of an
agreement, which included a 7 percent cut in wages, the union
said in a statement yesterday. A majority of the supplements to
the pact were also passed, and those that require additional
action don’t impact the financial terms that have been ratified,
according to a separate statement by Arkansas Best.  Shares of Arkansas Best have doubled this year on prospects
that  YRC Worldwide Inc. (YRCW)  would revive a rejected bid to purchase
the  Fort Smith , Arkansas-based company. Arkansas Best turned
down the takeover in April, saying it was focused on “labor
negotiations as well as other strategic and operational
initiatives” that made it difficult to consider an offer at the
time, according to a regulatory filing.  Arkansas Best said in its earnings release in April that a
“more rational” labor agreement will enable the trucking
company to be far more competitive with its cost structure.  To contact the reporter on this story:
