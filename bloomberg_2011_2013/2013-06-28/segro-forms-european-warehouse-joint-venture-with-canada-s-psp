Segro Plc (SGRO) , the U.K.’s largest
publicly traded owner of industrial properties, used 974 million
euros ($1.3 billion) of its warehouses in mainland Europe to
form a venture with  Canada ’s Public Sector Pension Investment
Board.  Segro will own 50 percent of the venture, which will
attempt to increase the portfolio’s value to at least 2 billion
euros through developments and acquisitions, the Slough,
England-based company said in a statement today. PSP Investments
will contribute 303 million euros of equity.  “The transaction is the first step in building what we
expect to be a strong long-term relationship with PSP
Investments as we seek to take advantage of the growth and
consolidation opportunities in the continental European
logistics market,” Segro Chief Executive Officer David Sleath
said in the statement.  Segro is seeking to grow its logistics business in  Europe 
as demand for warehouses increases. Europe needs 25 million
square meters (296 million square feet) of new distribution and
storage warehouses in the next five years, about 11 percent of
existing modern space, to keep up with Internet sales growth,
Jones Lang LaSalle Inc. said in March.  To contact the reporter on this story:
