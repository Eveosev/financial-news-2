Rain has delayed the start of play
on the outer courts on day five at the Wimbledon tennis
championships.  The courts are covered at the All England Club in London,
where play was to begin at 11:30 a.m. local time. The roof on
Centre Court has been closed and play will start there at the
scheduled time of 1 p.m.  Men’s No. 2 seed  Andy Murray  of Britain plays Spain’s Tommy
Robredo in a third-round match on Centre Court. Fourth-seeded
 David Ferrer  of Spain and 2011 women’s champion Petra Kvitova of
the Czech Republic are both scheduled to play today on Court No.
