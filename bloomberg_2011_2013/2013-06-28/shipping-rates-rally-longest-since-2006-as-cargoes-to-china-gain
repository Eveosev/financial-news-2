Shipping rates for iron ore rallied
for the longest since 2006 as record fleet growth slows and amid
speculation that demand is rising to deliver the steelmaking
commodity to  China .  Costs for Capesize ships carrying 160,000 metric tons
jumped 3.4 percent to $15,025 a day, according to the Baltic
Exchange in London, a publisher of rates on more than 50 trade
routes. Prices have risen for 17 sessions, the longest rally
since August 2006. The Baltic Dry Index, which also spans
smaller ships, added 1.7 percent to 1,171 points.  The advance adds to signs the worst of a rout in rates may
be ending as record fleet growth slows. Supply of the vessels,
which expanded by a record 82 percent between 2008 and 2012,
increased 3.3 percent this year, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. Earnings from the vessels jumped almost threefold
since the end of May, reversing the worst start to a year on
record, according to data from the bourse.  “Fleet growth is so much lower than it has been in the
last few years and the demand has been good,” said  Jeffrey Landsberg , managing director of Commodore Research, a New York-based adviser to ship owners. “Last week we had a strong surge
in iron-ore fixtures to China. This week has been less, but
still enough to help freight rates move up.”  Rates advanced for all four vessel types tracked by the
exchange. Panamaxes, about half the size of Capesizes, climbed
1.3 percent to $8,007 a day. Supramaxes transporting about
50,000 tons rose 0.4 percent to $9,973; Handysizes, the smallest
tracked by the exchange, added 1 percent to $8,272.  China has 71.9 million tons of iron ore at its ports, the
least for the time of year since 2010, according to data from
Beijing Antaike Information Development. The 68.56 million tons
it imported last month were the highest for the time of year on
record, customs data show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
