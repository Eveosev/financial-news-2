U.K. productivity was unchanged in
the first three months of the year, ending six straight quarters
of decline, according to a report today.  Services productivity, measured by output per hour, rose
0.3 percent in the quarter, while manufacturing productivity
fell 0.4 percent, the Office for National Statistics said in
 London  today. Total productivity last increased in the second
quarter of 2011. Productivity as measured by output per worker
rose 0.3 percent in the first quarter, according to the ONS.  The report also showed that unit labor costs fell 0.4
percent in the January-March period from the previous quarter
and were 0.5 percent lower compared with the same period a year
earlier. That’s the first annual decline since 2010.  Separately, the ONS said Britain’s services industries
expanded in April. Services, which account for about three
quarters of the economy, increased 0.2 percent from the previous
month and were up 2 percent compared with a year earlier. In the
three months through April, services rose 0.8 percent from the
previous quarter.  The ONS also said that services grew 0.5 percent in the
first quarter, less than the 0.6 percent previously estimated.
That revision was taken into account in the third estimate of
gross domestic product, published yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
