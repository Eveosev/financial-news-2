China’s stocks  rebounded from a
four-year low, led by financial companies, after money-market
rates dropped and on speculation the government will ease
financing for developers to alleviate a credit crunch.  Industrial & Commercial Bank of China Ltd. (601398)  and PetroChina
Co., which have the two biggest weightings on the  Shanghai 
Composite Index, rallied the most since 2010 in the last 15
minutes of trading.  China Vanke Co. (000002)  and Poly Real Estate Group
Co., the largest developers, surged more than 6 percent, leading
a measure of property stocks to the biggest gain in four months.  “Big-caps such as banks and developers have dropped to
very low levels,” making them attractive, said  Zhang Ling ,
general manager at Shanghai River Fund Management Co. “There
isn’t any more room for declines in the indexes.”  The Shanghai Composite climbed 1.5 percent to 1,979.21 at
the close, paring losses to 4.5 percent this week, the biggest
loss since the five days ended Feb. 22. It closed at the lowest
level since January 2009 yesterday. The CSI 300 Index advanced
1.9 percent to 2,200.64 while the  Hang Seng China Enterprises
Index (HSCEI)  added 1.6 percent.  The Shanghai index erased gains in the afternoon before
rebounding in the last 15 minutes of trading, fueled by rallies
for ICBC, the nation’s biggest lender, and PetroChina, the
largest energy company. ICBC gained 5.5 percent to 4.02  yuan ,
the most since November 2010. PetroChina rebounded from a record
low this week, advancing 3.4 percent to 7.61 yuan, the largest
gain since December 2010.  “There’s speculation there’s an invisible hand in the
market, that the government is adding funds into ICBC and
PetroChina,” Deng Wenyuan, an analyst at Soochow Securities
Co., said by phone. “Also, these two stocks reached their lows
recently and had fallen a lot, so a technical rebound shouldn’t
be surprising.”  Maintain Stability  Trading volumes for both PetroChina and ICBC peaked in the
final 10 minutes and gains in the two stocks accounted for about
40 percent of the Shanghai index’s advance, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. The shares dropped out of the ranks of
the world’s 10 biggest companies by market value this month,
leaving  China  without any stocks in the grouping for the first
time since 2006.  The Shanghai measure slumped 14 percent this month, capping
the biggest monthly loss since August 2009, amid concern higher
 capital costs  will curb economic growth as money-market rates
jumped to records.  Central bank governor  Zhou Xiaochuan  said today the
government will maintain market stability and adjust policies at
the right time, his first comments since a record cash squeeze.  Developers Rise  The People’s Bank of China “will use all kinds of tools to
appropriately adjust liquidity in the market and maintain the
overall stability of the market,” Zhou said at a speech at the
annual Lujiazui Forum financial conference in Shanghai.  The Shanghai Composite’s property index surged 4 percent,
its biggest gain since Feb. 5. China may ease financing for
companies with property businesses, the 21st Century Business
Herald reported today. The government has banned developers from
issuing new shares, share placements and restructuring since at
least 2008, said Dai Fang, a Shanghai-based property analyst at
Zheshang Securities Co.  Vanke jumped 8.4 percent to 9.85 yuan. Poly Real Estate
added 6.2 percent to 9.91 yuan.  China Merchants Property
Development Co. (000024)  climbed 6.8 percent to 24.28 yuan.  “There’s speculation that developers will be allowed to
sell new shares or bonds for refinancing,” said Wu Kan, a
Shanghai-based  fund manager  at Dazhong Insurance Co., which
oversees $285 million. “The purpose is probably to prevent
developers from suffering from a credit crunch and to stabilize
the economy.”  Repo Rates  A measure of financial stocks in the CSI 300 including
banks and developers climbed 3.8 percent today, the most among
the 10 industry groups. China Merchants Bank Co. rose 6.2
percent to 11.60 yuan. China Minsheng Banking Corp., the
nation’s first privately owned bank, added 4.4 percent to 8.57
yuan.  Shanghai Pudong Development Bank Co. (600000)  climbed 5.1 percent
to 8.28 yuan.  Even with today’s gain for the financial index, it’s still
down 17 percent this month on concern higher money-money rates
will increase funding costs for banks. The seven-day repurchase
 rate  reached a record 12.45 percent on June 20. It fell 58 basis
points today to 6.16 percent, taking this week’s slide to 309
basis points, the most since February 2011, according to a
weighted average compiled by the National Interbank Funding
Center.  The  Shanghai Composite (SHCOMP)  has fallen 19 percent from this
year’s high on Feb. 6 while the CSI 300 has slumped 21 percent
in that period. The Shanghai index is valued at 8.1 times
projected 12-month earnings, compared with the seven-year
average of 15.1 times, according to  data  compiled by Bloomberg.  Manufacturing Data  Trading volumes in the Shanghai Composite were 0.7 percent
lower than the 30-day average today, while 30-day  volatility  was
at 23.1, the highest level since April 2, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. The index’s 14-day relative strength
measure, measuring how rapidly prices have advanced or dropped
during a specified time period, was at 23.2 today. Readings
below 30 indicate it may be poised to rise.  The Bloomberg China-US 55 Index, the measure of the most-traded U.S.-listed Chinese companies, added 1.2 percent in  New
York  yesterday after valuations dropped to a 10-month low.  Sinovel Wind Group Co., the country’s biggest maker of  wind
turbines , fell 5 percent to 3.81 yuan for a ninth day of losses
after the company was charged by U.S. prosecutors with stealing
 trade secrets . Wang Wen, a Beijing-based spokeswoman at Sinovel,
declined to comment.  The National Bureau of Statistics is scheduled to release
its manufacturing index for this month on July 1. The gauge may
fall to 50 from 50.8 a month earlier, according to the median
estimates of 28 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. The number of 50
is the dividing line between expansion and contraction.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
