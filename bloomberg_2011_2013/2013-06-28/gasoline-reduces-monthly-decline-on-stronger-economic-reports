Gasoline rose as economic reports
showed gains for  Europe  and the U.S. while inventories of the
motor fuel surge.  Futures trimmed a monthly decline as German  retail sales 
rose more than forecast in May. In the U.S.,  consumer spending 
rebounded last month and weekly jobless  claims  fell. Gasoline
 supplies  are seasonally the highest since 1992 and demand is
down. Crack spreads widened.  “We’ve had some good economic headlines, German retail
sales are increasing and there are lower U.S. jobless claims,”
said  Andy Lipow , president of Lipow Oil Associates LLC in
Houston. “But as supplies increase, gasoline prices and
refining margins will continue under pressure.”  July-delivery gasoline gained 0.48 cent to $2.7474 a gallon
at 10:13 a.m. on the  New York  Mercantile Exchange on volume that
was 8.2 percent below the 100-day average. The more actively
traded August contract was up 0.84 cent to $2.7365. July
gasoline and ultra-low-sulfur diesel contracts will expire at
the close of floor trading today.  Prices have declined 1.1 percent this month and are down 11
percent in the quarter.  Gasoline’s  crack spread  versus WTI gained 40 cents to
$17.93 a barrel. The fuel’s  premium  over Brent rose 38 cents to
$12.14 a barrel.  Gasoline at the  pump , averaged nationwide, fell 1.4 cents
to $3.514 a gallon, Heathrow, Florida-based AAA said today on
its website. Prices have retreated 16 consecutive days, dropping
12 cents to and are the lowest since April 29.  Ultra-low-sulfur diesel, or ULSD, for July delivery rose
0.09 cent to $2.8903 a gallon on trading volume that was 25
percent below the 100-day average, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. August futures gained 0.32 cent to $2.8912.  Prices are up 3.5 percent this month and have fallen 5.8
percent this quarter.  ULSD’s  crack spread  versus West Texas Intermediate crude
