Biostime International Holdings Ltd. (1112) 
declined the most in almost two years after the Chinese baby-care products provider announced one of its units was under
investigation for alleged anti-monopoly law violations.  The pediatric nutrition maker dropped as much as 10
percent, headed for the biggest drop since August 2011, to
HK$42.15, before trading at HK$43.05 as of the midday break in
Hong Kong. The benchmark Hang Seng Index gained 1.2 percent.  The unit, Biostime (Guangzhou) Inc., is being probed by the
National Development and Reform Commission for allegedly
managing prices in the market in violation of the anti-monopoly
law, the parent said yesterday in a statement to the Hong Kong
stock exchange. The case comes after  Kweichow Moutai Co. (600519)  and
 Wuliangye Yibin Co. (000858) ’s units were fined in February for setting
minimum retail prices.  “We believe Biostime’s future sales prospects are
promising and that its competitive advantage remains intact,
though the concern about a potential fine and punishment may be
overhang in the near term,” Jacqueline Ko, a Hong Kong-based
analyst at Kim Eng Securities (HK) Ltd., said today in a note.
She reiterated a buy rating on the stock.  To contact the reporter on this story:
