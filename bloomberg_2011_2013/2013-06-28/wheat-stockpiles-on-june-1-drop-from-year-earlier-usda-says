Wheat stockpiles in the U.S., the
world’s biggest exporter, were 3.3 percent smaller on June 1
than a year earlier, the Department of Agriculture said in a
report today.  Inventories totaled 718.3 million bushels (19.6 million
metric tons), the USDA said. That’s down from 742.6 million
bushels on June 1, 2012. Analysts surveyed by Bloomberg News, on
average, expected 745 million bushels.  Wheat futures jumped 19 percent last year, the biggest gain
among the 24 commodities tracked by the Standard & Poor’s GSCI
Spot Index. Prices are down 13 percent this year as the USDA has
forecast global production will surge to the second-most on
record. The all-time high was in 2011.  U.S. production in the year that started on June 1 is
forecast at 2.08 billion bushels by the USDA. Of that, 958
million will be used to make food, up 1.4 percent from the prior
year. The amount used to feed animals will drop 19 percent,
while exports will fall 3.5 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
