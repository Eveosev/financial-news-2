Amar’e Stoudemire said in a Twitter post that he’s part of a
group bidding to buy the Hapoel  Jerusalem  basketball team.  “Excited to join the partnership that is giving back to
the city of Jerusalem by offering the Hapoel basketball team a
fresh start,” Stoudemire said in a Twitter post yesterday.  Ori Allon, co-founder of the New York-based real estate
website Urban Compass, also sent a post on Twitter that
Stoudemire forwarded.  “Proud to partner with @Amareisreal & others on building a
promising future for the Hapoel Jerusalem basketball club,”
Allon’s post said.  An e-mail sent to an address listed on Hapoel Jerusalem’s
website seeking comment on the posts wasn’t immediately
returned, nor was a telephone message left at the office of
Happy Walters, Stoudemire’s agent.  Stoudemire has been vocal in expressing his Jewish roots
since visiting  Israel  in 2010.  Hapoel Jerusalem, which plays in the Israeli Basketball
Super League, was swept in a best-of-five semifinal playoff
series this month.  Stoudemire will return to Israel next month, serving as an
assistant coach on the Canadian team in the Maccabiah Games,
according to the New York Times.  Hapoel Jerusalem’s roster includes former U.S. college
players Ronald Steele of  Alabama  and Courtney Fells of North
Carolina State.  To contact the reporter on this story:
