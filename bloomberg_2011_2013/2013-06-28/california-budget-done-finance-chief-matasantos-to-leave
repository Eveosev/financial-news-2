Ana Matosantos, who oversaw
 California ’s finances under both Republican Arnold Schwarzenegger and Democrat Jerry Brown, will step down in
September, according to a statement from the governor’s office.  The announcement didn’t say why Matosantos, 37, was leaving
or what she would do next. She will be replaced by her deputy,
Michael Cohen, who formerly worked for the independent
Legislative Analyst’s Office, Brown said in the statement.  The move came one day after the governor signed a $96.3
billion budget crafted by Matosantos that included the first
surplus following almost a decade of chronic deficits.  Matosantos didn’t immediately respond to a telephone
message seeking comment on her departure.  Matosantos, a Democrat, served as deputy budget director
under Schwarzenegger until December 2009, when the governor
promoted her to succeed Michael Genest as chief. Brown kept her
on when he took office in January 2011.  Matosantos was arrested for driving under the influence in
October 2011 and offered to quit at the time. Brown refused her
resignation.  Cohen, 40, was appointed deputy director in January, 2011.
Before that, he worked for the Legislative Analyst, which
advises lawmakers and the governor on fiscal issues. He will
earn $180,250 a year, according to the statement from Brown’s
office.  To contact the reporter on this story:
