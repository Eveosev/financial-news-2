A gauge of U.S. corporate credit
risk fell for a fourth day as investors await a report that may
show consumer sentiment improved in June.  The Markit CDX North American Investment Grade Index, a
credit-default swaps benchmark that investors use to hedge
against losses or to speculate on creditworthiness, decreased
0.7 basis point to a mid-price of 86.1 basis points at 8:22 a.m.
in  New York , according to prices compiled by Bloomberg.  Strengthening economic indicators may allay investor
concern that companies will struggle to repay their obligations.
A report at 9:55 a.m. in New York may show that  consumer
confidence  in the U.S. rose this month. The Thomson
Reuters/University of Michigan gauge of consumer sentiment
climbed to 83 from a prior reading of 82.7, according to the
median estimate in a Bloomberg survey.  The credit-swaps index typically falls as investor
confidence improves and rises as it deteriorates. The contracts
pay the buyer face value if a borrower fails to meet its
obligations, less the value of the defaulted debt. A basis point
equals $1,000 annually on a contract protecting $10 million of
debt.  To contact the reporter on this story:
