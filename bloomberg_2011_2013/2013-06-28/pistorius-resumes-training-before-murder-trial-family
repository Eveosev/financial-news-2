Oscar Pistorius, the Paralympian
athlete who killed his girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp, will return
to training ahead of his trial.  “His family, and those close to him, have encouraged him
to spend a few hours a week on the track to assist him in
finding the necessary mental and emotional equilibrium to
process his trauma and prepare for the trial,” the Pistorius
family said in a  statement  released on the athlete’s website
yesterday.  Prosecutors accuse Pistorius of deliberately shooting
Steenkamp, 29, at his Pretoria home on Feb. 14, Valentine’s Day.
The athlete says he thought she was a burglar. Pistorius, 26,
successfully challenged bail conditions on March 28 and had his
passport returned to him so that he could travel and compete.
The murder trial is set for Aug. 19.  “His focus at this time remains entirely on the court
case,” according to the family statement. “Oscar is not
contemplating a formal return to athletics and his training is
not aimed at preparing for competition.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
