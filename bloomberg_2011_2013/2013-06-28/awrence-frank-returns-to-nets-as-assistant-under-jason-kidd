Lawrence Frank, the New Jersey Nets’
career leader in coaching wins, agreed in principle to return to
the club that’s now based in Brooklyn as an assistant to new
coach  Jason Kidd .  Frank was hired with Roy Rogers and Eric Hughes to join
current assistant Doug Overton on the National Basketball
Association team’s bench, the Nets said today in a news release.  “They collectively bring a wealth of NBA experience to our
bench, both from a coach and player perspective,” Kidd, who
retired following last season to take his first coaching job,
said in the statement. “This combination will not only prove
beneficial to me, but will be an invaluable asset to our players
as well.”  Frank, who was fired as coach of the Detroit Pistons in
April following a 29-53 campaign, coached the Nets for parts of
seven seasons from 2004 to 2009, going 225-241 and leading them
to the playoffs each season from 2004 to 2007. He was also an
assistant under  Byron Scott  when the Nets reached the NBA Finals
in 2002 and 2003.  Rogers, a three-year NBA player, was an assistant with the
Nets from 2008 to 2010. He had been with the Pistons from 2011
to 2013.  Hughes, an assistant coach at the University of California
from 1991 to 1993 when Kidd played there, has been a member of
the Toronto Raptors’ staff since the 2007-08 season. He was
promoted to assistant coach in 2009.  Brooklyn went 49-33 last season and lost in the first round
of the playoffs to the Chicago Bulls. Yesterday, the team agreed
in principle to acquire  Kevin Garnett ,  Paul Pierce  and  Jason Terry  from the Boston Celtics in exchange for forward  Gerald Wallace , four other players and first-round draft picks in 2014,
2016 and 2018, ESPN reported, citing unidentified people close
to the process. The trade cannot become official until July 10.  To contact the reporter on this story:
