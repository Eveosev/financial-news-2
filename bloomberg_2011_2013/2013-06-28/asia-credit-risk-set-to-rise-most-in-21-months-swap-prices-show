The cost of insuring corporate and
sovereign bonds in  Asia  from non-payment is poised to rise the
most in 21 months in June, credit-default swap traders said.  The Markit iTraxx Asia index of 40 investment-grade
borrowers outside  Japan  gained 1 basis point to 151.5 basis
points as of 8:26 a.m. in  Hong Kong , Westpac Banking Corp.
prices show. The gauge is set to climb 35.1 basis points this
month, the most since September 2011, and 29.3 basis points this
quarter, according to data provider CMA.  The Markit iTraxx Australia index was little changed at 136
as of 10:29 a.m. in Sydney, according to National Australia Bank
Ltd. The index is on course to rise 23.6 basis points this month
and 13 basis points this quarter, according to CMA, which is
owned by McGraw-Hill Cos. and compiles prices quoted by dealers
in the privately negotiated market.  The Markit iTraxx Japan index slid 1 basis point to 110.5
basis points as of 9:29 a.m. in  Tokyo , Citigroup Inc. prices
show. The index is on track for its lowest close since June 19
and poised to rise 14 basis points this month.  Credit-default swap indexes are benchmarks for insuring
bonds against default and traders use them to speculate on
 credit quality . A drop signals improving perceptions of
creditworthiness, while an increase suggests the opposite.  The swap contracts pay the buyer face value in exchange for
the underlying securities if a borrower fails to meet its debt
agreements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
