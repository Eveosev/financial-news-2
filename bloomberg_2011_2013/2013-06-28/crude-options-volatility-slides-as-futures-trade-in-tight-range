Crude oil options volatility fell a
fourth straight day as underlying futures traded in the
narrowest range in more than a week.  Implied volatility for at-the-money options expiring in
August, a measure of expected price swings in futures and a
gauge of options, was 19.73 percent on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange  as of 3:15 p.m., down from 20.7 percent yesterday.  West Texas Intermediate crude for August delivery sank 49
cents to settle at $96.56 a barrel on the Nymex. This week,
crude has traded between $92.67 and $97.82, and today swung in a
$1.49 range, the smallest since June 19.  “We’re really not going anywhere,” said  Phil Flynn ,
senior market analyst at Price Futures Group in  Chicago . “And
if you’re in a tight trading range, volatility is going to go
down.”  Piyush Goyal, an analyst at Barclays Plc in  New York ,
recommended buying straddles, or a call and a put at the same
strike price, for expiration in three to six months, in a report
today.  He recommended hedging the straddles, or buying and selling
contracts as the underlying futures prices drop and rise $2 to
$3, to maintain a neutral position.  The most-active options in electronic trading today were
August $95 puts, which rose 7 cents to $1.17 a barrel on volume
of 2,841 lots traded at 3:17 p.m. August $93 puts were the
second-most active, gaining 1 cent to 64 cents a barrel on
volume of 1,729 contracts.  More Puts  Puts accounted for 65 percent of electronic trading volume
and were the five most widely traded contracts. In the prior
session, bearish bets were 54 percent of 142,535 contracts.  August $101 calls were the most-active options traded
yesterday, with 6,402 contracts changing hands. They rose 23
cents to 49 cents a barrel. August $87 puts declined 8 cents to
10 cents on 5,879 lots.  Open interest was highest for September $85 puts, with
39,634 contracts. Next were December $105 calls with 37,656 lots
and December $80 puts with 36,762.  The exchange distributes real-time data for electronic
