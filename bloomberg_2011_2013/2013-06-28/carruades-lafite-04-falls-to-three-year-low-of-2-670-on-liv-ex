Four cases of 2004 Carruades de
Lafite Bordeaux, the second wine of Chateau Lafite-Rothschild,
sold for 1,750 pounds ($2,670) each yesterday on Liv-ex, the
lowest since November 2009 and 47 percent below its peak.  The vintage fetched as much as 3,330 pounds on the London-based market in December 2010 as demand for Bordeaux wines
climbed, before dropping back to 2,000 pounds by August last
year as appetite cooled and investors focused more on Burgundy.  The Liv-ex Fine Wine 50 Index has risen 5 percent this
year, with an 8 percent gain in the 10 weeks to mid-March pared
by a 3 percent decline since then. Price cuts on Bordeaux 2012
futures over the past three months have weighed on prices of
other vintages from the region.  The 2004 vintage is still the most expensive Carruades of 
the past 10 years, according to merchant prices collated by 
 Liv-ex  on its Cellar Watch website. The vintage was awarded an
89-90 rating on a 100-point scale by U.S. critic  Robert Parker .  Between 20,000 and 30,000 cases a year are made of
Carruades, which contains a higher percentage of Merlot grapes
than the first-growth Lafite-Rothschild wine, according to the
Lafite website. Carruades comprises between 50 percent and 70
percent  Cabernet Sauvignon , 30 percent to 50 percent Merlot and
as much as 5 percent Cabernet Franc and Petit Verdot.  To contact the reporter on this story:
