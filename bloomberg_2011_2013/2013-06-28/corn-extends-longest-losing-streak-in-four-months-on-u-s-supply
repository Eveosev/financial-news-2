Corn declined for a seventh day, the
longest losing streak since February, as warm weather and soil
moisture boost the yield outlook in the U.S., the largest grower
and exporter, even as acreage is expected to decline.  Corn for December delivery fell as much as 0.3 percent to
$5.37 a bushel on the  Chicago  Board of Trade, and was at $5.3725
at 11:40 a.m. Singapore time. Futures are heading for a third
straight quarterly loss.  Warm temperatures and adequate-to-surplus soil moisture
will favor developing corn and soybeans throughout the Midwest,
DTN said in a report yesterday. Corn probably was sown on 95.431
million acres (38.6 million hectares), or 1.9 percent less than
the record 97.282 million farmers intended in March, a Bloomberg
survey showed. The  U.S. Department of Agriculture  will update
the acreage estimate at 12 p.m. in Washington today.  “Improving U.S. corn-yield prospects are currently bearish
for new-crop prices,”  Luke Mathews , a commodity strategist at
 Commonwealth Bank of Australia  wrote in a report today.
“Nevertheless, tonight’s USDA reports will be the most
influential factor for crop prices over the next week.”  Corn yields may average 156 bushels an acre this year, the
third-highest on record, taking production to an all-time high
13.62 billion bushels, “barring extreme weather in late July,”
according to  Bill Gary , the president of Commodity Information
Systems in Oklahoma City.  Soybeans for delivery in November were little changed at
$12.7475 a bushel in Chicago, while wheat for delivery in
September was also little changed at $6.7425 a bushel.  To contact the reporter on this story:
