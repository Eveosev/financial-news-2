Facebook Inc. (FB)  said it won’t place
ads on pages that feature sex or violence, stepping up efforts
to shield brands and businesses from content deemed offensive.  Starting July 1, the owner of the largest social-networking
service will  expand  the categories alongside which it won’t
place ads. These include pages featuring any violent, graphic or
sexual content, said Facebook, which already blocks ads from
topics such as racist humor.  Nissan Motor Co.’s U.K. unit and lender Nationwide Building
Society suspended some Facebook ads earlier this year amid
complaints that the site allowed content that encouraged
violence against women. Facebook is working to strike a better
balance between fostering free speech and not offending
marketers whose spending is vital to sales growth.  “We recognize we need to do more to prevent situations
where ads are displayed alongside controversial” content, the
company said in the post. “Our goal is to both preserve the
freedoms of sharing on Facebook but also protect people and
brands from certain types of content.”  Facebook, which has more than 1.1 billion users, said the
new policy won’t have a “meaningful impact” on  business .  As part of the new policies, Facebook also plans a more
automated way to address ads appearing next to controversial
content. The policies affect Facebook’s Pages, which typically
feature celebrities, companies or businesses, and Groups, where
folks with common interests or opinions connect.  “All of this will improve detection of what qualifies as
questionable content,” Facebook said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
