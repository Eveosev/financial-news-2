Lanxess AG (LXS) , the German maker of
synthetic rubber that has lost 29 percent in Frankfurt trading
this year, plans to buy back as many as 250,000 shares for its
employees at the beginning of July.  The shares will be bought on the Frankfurt exchange between
July 1 and 8, the Leverkusen, Germany-based company said today
in a statement. The buyback is valued at 11.7 million euros
($15.3 million) based on yesterdayâ€™s closing price.  Lanxess, which generates 40 percent of sales from the tire
and auto industries, has suffered as European car sales have
slid to a 20-year low and the  European debt crisis  weighs on
construction spending. The chemical maker yesterday said it will
close a plant in South Africa and is consolidating production of
vulcanization accelerators in the U.S. and  Belgium , leading to
the loss of about 85 jobs.  Lanxess shares gained as much as 1.9 percent to 47.50 euros
and were trading 0.4 percent higher as of 9:42 a.m. local time.  To contact the reporter on this story:
