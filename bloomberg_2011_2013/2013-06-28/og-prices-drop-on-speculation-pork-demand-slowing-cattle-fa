Hog futures headed for the biggest
decline in six weeks on speculation that demand for U.S. pork is
slowing. Cattle also declined.  Wholesale  pork  fell 1.5 percent yesterday after reaching
$1.1133 a pound on June 26, the highest since at least October
1997, U.S. Department of Agriculture data show. Wholesale pork
 bellies  slumped 4.1 percent yesterday, the first drop in more
than a week. Meatpackers processed 1.615 million hogs in the
first four days of this week, up 1.8 percent from a week
earlier, according to the USDA.  “There seems to be a few more hogs around, plus some of
the cuts kind of took a tumble yesterday,” Dick Quiter, an
account executive at McFarland Commodities LLC, said in a
telephone interview from Chicago, referring to the decline in
wholesale prices. “That’s in some people’s minds, the first
little sign that maybe we should take some profits from a
futures standpoint.”  Hog futures for August settlement fell 1.5 percent to 97.95
cents a pound at 11:52 a.m. on the  Chicago  Mercantile Exchange,
heading for the biggest slide for a most-active contract since
May 17.  Prices are still headed for the seventh straight weekly
gain, the longest rally since 1990. Yesterday, futures reached
99.85 cents, the highest since April 25, 2011.  On June 21, open interest in lean-hog futures exceeded the
number of live-cattle contracts for the first time since 2000,
and the spread has continued to widen. Yesterday, open interest
in hogs totaled 294,524 contracts, compared to 269,858 contract
in live cattle.  Hog futures were up 16 percent this year through yesterday,
the biggest gain among the 24 commodities tracked by the
Standard & Poor’s GSCI Spot Index.  Cattle futures for August delivery fell 0.5 percent to
$1.22275 a pound on the CME.  Feeder-cattle futures for August settlement rose 0.6
percent to $1.50575 a pound, heading for the sixth straight
increase, the longest rally since December.  To contact the reporter on this story:
