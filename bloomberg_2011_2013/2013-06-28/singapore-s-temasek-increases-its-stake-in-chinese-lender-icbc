Temasek Holdings Pte, Singapore’s
state-owned investment company, raised its stake in  Industrial &
Commercial Bank of China Ltd ., adding to its interests in state-controlled lenders of the world’s second-largest economy.  Temasek bought 126 million shares at an average price of
HK$4.602 each, or a total of about HK$580 million ($75 million),
according to a Hong Kong stock exchange statement yesterday.
That raised Temasek’s holdings in the Hong Kong shares of ICBC
to 8.07 percent from 7.92 percent.  Stephen Forshaw , a spokesman
for Temasek in Singapore, confirmed the transaction by telephone.  Temasek bought 3.55 billion ICBC shares from  Goldman Sachs
Group Inc. (GS)  in April last year and then disclosed the purchase of
a further 83.7 million shares in the Chinese lender the
following month. It bought 280 million shares of the bank for
HK$5.50 each last month, according to a May 21 filing.  Temasek has accumulated more than $17 billion of holdings
in Beijing-based ICBC,  China Construction Bank Corp. (939)  and  Bank of
China Ltd.  over the past two years, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg. Global firms including Goldman Sachs and Bank of
America Corp. have divested holdings as new capital rules known
as Basel III make it more expensive to hold minority stakes in
banks.  To contact the reporter on this story:
