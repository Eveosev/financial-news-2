South African  credit  growth slowed
to 9.05 percent in May, decelerating from a four-month high in
April.  Growth in borrowing by households and companies rose 9.13
percent in the previous month, the Pretoria-based  Reserve Bank 
said on its website today. The  median estimate  in a Bloomberg
survey of 14 economists was 9 percent.  Consumer spending  slowed in the first quarter, further
limiting economic growth curbed by mining strikes and a lack in
demand from Europe for manufactured exports. The Reserve Bank
has kept its benchmark interest rate unchanged since July
because  inflation  close to the top of its target of 3 percent to
6 percent prevents policy makers from adjusting  interest rates 
to support a slowing economy, Governor Gill Marcus said two days
ago.  The broad M3 measure of  money supply  rose 9.8 percent in
May from a year earlier compared with 10 percent in April, the
central bank said. The median estimate in a Bloomberg survey was
9.7 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
