U.S. stocks erased early losses as
utility, consumer and commodity companies led gains, while
financial companies declined the most.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index was little changed at
1,612.91 at 11:04 a.m. in  New York  after slumping as much as 0.8
percent earlier.  The S&P 500 yesterday capped the biggest three-day rally
since early January on better-than-estimated economic data and
assurances on stimulus efforts from Federal Reserve officials.
Fed Governor  Jeremy Stein  said today the central bank is
providing more clarity about how it will wind down its $85
billion in monthly bond buying as unemployment falls toward 7
percent.  If the Fed makes a decision to begin reducing purchases in
September, Stein said in New York, “it will give primary weight
to the large stock of news that has accumulated since the
inception of the program and will not be unduly influenced by
whatever data releases arrive in the few weeks before the
meeting.”  U.S. stock trading, already poised for the busiest month in
a year, may get another boost in volume today as Russell
Investments concludes the annual revisions to its equity
benchmark gauges.  Trading volume is on track for the strongest month since
May 2012, with approximately 7 billion shares changing hands on
average each day in June, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. Russell’s annual revisions usually spur one of the
busiest sessions of the year. Last year’s reconstitution on June
22 helped fuel a jump in volume to 9.73 billion shares, the
highest total of the year.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
