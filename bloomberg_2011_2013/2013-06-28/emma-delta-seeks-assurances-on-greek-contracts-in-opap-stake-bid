Emma Delta, a Cyprus-based equity
fund, confirmed that it’s committed to a plan to buy a 33
percent stake in Greek gambling company  Opap SA (OPAP)  and is seeking
assurances that Opap’s contracts are legally sound.  The fund, whose bid for the stake is worth about 712
million euros ($932 million), said it will be “ready to move
ahead and invest in Opap” once it’s convinced that “proper
corporate governance and full arms-length terms” are in place
and respected by all parties involved in Opap’s contracts,
according to a statement today.  “Contrary to recent misleading statements, media reports
and speculation,” Emma Delta is not “seeking to interfere in
Opap’s legitimate existing or prospective contractual
arrangements or its business conduct,” the fund said.  Emma Delta wanted to cancel two elements of the deal agreed
to last month, the Financial Times reported earlier today,
without citing anyone.  The dispute over the Opap stake sale threatens  Greece  with
the collapse of a key state-asset sale following the
government’s failure to sell national gas company Depa earlier
this month. State asset sales are key to the country continuing
to receive funds under an international aid plan worth 240
billion euros.  To contact the reporters on this story:
