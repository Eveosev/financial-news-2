Steel reinforcement-bar futures rose
for a second day on optimism that government polices aimed at
redeveloping of shantytowns will stoke more construction,
increasing demand for the commodity.  Rebar for delivery in January on the Shanghai Futures
Exchange rose 0.6 percent to 3,551  yuan  ($578) a metric ton at
10:50 a.m. in Beijing. The contract has fallen 1.6 percent this
week.  China  may release details of policy to redevelop
shantytowns in the second half of this year, China Securities
Journal reported yesterday. Redevelopment of the shantytowns
could become a new point to boost economic growth, according to
a statement posted on the central government’s website on June
26 after a State Council meeting chaired by Premier  Li Keqiang .
The nation’s overall economic situation is stable this year,
according to the statement.  “On the policy front, there has been bullish support for a
rebound in steel prices,” Cai Yuehui, an analyst at Ruida
Futures Co., said from Fujian.  Iron ore  prices for immediate delivery at Tianjin port in
China yesterday gained 1.3 percent to $115.3 a dry ton,
according to The Steel Index Ltd. The raw material is a key
ingredient for steel production.  The average  spot price  for rebar in China fell 0.5 percent
to 3,360 yuan a ton yesterday, according to data from Beijing
Antaike Information Development Co.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
