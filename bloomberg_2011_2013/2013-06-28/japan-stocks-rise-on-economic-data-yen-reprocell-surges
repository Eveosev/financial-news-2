Japanese  stocks  rose for a second
day, with all 33  Topix (TPX)  industry groups advancing, as the yen
weakened against the dollar and data showed the U.S. and
Japanese economies are improving.  Toyota Motor Corp. (7203)  gained 1.4 percent after figures showed
Japanese carmakers’ U.S. production rose 36 percent last year,
helped by a weaker yen.  ReproCell Inc. (4978) , a stem-cell research
company, began trading on the JASDAQ Index more than five times
higher than its initial public offering price after going
untraded for two days. Developers and insurers climbed the most
among the Topix’s groups.  The Topix added 2.2 percent to 1,122.99 as of 9:30 a.m. in
Tokyo, bringing its increase for the week to 2.1 percent. It’s
down 1.2 percent this month and up 8.5 percent for the second
quarter. The Nikkei 225 Stock Average advanced 1.7 percent to
13,434.22.  “The market is reacting to improving economic reports,”
said Koichi Kurose, chief economist in Tokyo at Resona Bank
Ltd.,  Japan ’s fifth-largest lender by market value. “Investors
will be buying back short positions in the near term.”  The Topix has fallen 14 percent from an almost five-year
high on May 22 through yesterday. The measure traded yesterday
at 13.9 times average estimated earnings, compared with 14.6 for
the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index and 12.7 for the Stoxx Europe
600 Index.  Futures on the S&P 500 were little changed. The gauge rose
0.6 percent yesterday, capping its biggest three-day rally since
January. Data showed gains in consumer spending, household
spending and sales of previously-owned homes, while jobless
claims fell.  In Japan, figures released today for May showed industrial
production rose more than expected and consumer prices excluding
fresh food were unchanged from a year earlier, halting a six-month slide.  To contact the reporters on this story:
