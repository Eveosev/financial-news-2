The U.S. government spending cuts
known as sequestration are compromising courthouse safety, a
lawyers group said in a letter to President  Barack Obama  and 47
members of Congress.  Robert Anello, president of the  Federal Bar Council , an
organization of attorneys who practice before the federal courts
in New York,  Connecticut  and  Vermont , said in the letter that
it’s “imperative” the president and lawmakers reach an
agreement to restore funding to the courts.  “The courts in this circuit have been compromised by cuts
to their security and physical maintenance budgets, reduced  job
security  for personnel in all departments, and reduced hours for
bankruptcy proceedings,” Anello said in the letter yesterday.  A $50 million shortfall in the account for judicial
security nationwide has prevented New York federal courts from
making needed upgrades to security cameras and computer systems,
Anello said. The courts are considering firing security staff
and limiting access to courthouses, he said.  “The sequester has thus compromised the personal safety of
the judges and other public servants who administer our court
system, and has also compromised the ability of American
citizens to observe court proceedings in a secure setting,”
Anello said in the letter.  The courts in New York and Brooklyn have reduced non-judicial staffing by 40 percent in the past two years, causing
“disruptions and delays,” according to Anello.  The cuts have also resulted in a 20 percent reduction in
the budget for the Federal Defender’s office, which represents
40 percent of criminal defendants in the federal districts that
cover  New York City  and surrounding counties, Anello said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
