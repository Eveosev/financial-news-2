SIX Group, operator of the Swiss
stock exchange, will run the nation’s market for  repurchase
agreements , or repos, from May 2014 instead of  Deutsche Boerse
AG (DB1) ’s Eurex unit.  The Swiss franc-denominated market for short-term loans,
which the  Swiss National Bank  uses to conduct its open-market
operations, is currently run by the Eurex derivatives exchange
on a platform developed by SIX. Eurex was previously jointly
owned by SIX and Deutsche Boerse and SIX sold its stake to the
Frankfurt-based company in 2012.  “We have now won the mandate for the repo market,”
Christian Katz, chief executive officer of the Swiss exchange,
said in an interview at the  Federation of European Securities
Exchanges  annual convention in Berlin. “We will now run it and
develop the next generation of the repo platform.”  SIX this year ended its  Scoach  joint venture with  Deutsche
Boerse  for European structured products, seeking to run it
alone. The operator of the Zurich bourse, clearinghouse and
payment-transactions system said profit climbed almost 47
percent in 2012 on higher financial income and as it sold its
stake in Eurex.  To contact the reporter on this story:
