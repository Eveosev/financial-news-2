Austria’s economy, reliant on
exports to other euro area countries, will expand less than
anticipated this year on persistent weakness in the monetary
union, the state-supported Wifo research institute said.  Gross domestic product, the sum of all goods and services,
will only grow 0.4 percent compared with a previously estimated
1 percent, the Vienna-based group said today in a statement.
Growth in 2014 is forecast to accelerate to 1.6 percent, also
less than the previously forecast 1.8 percent.  “First-quarter leading indicators that showed economic
improvement failed to materialize,” Wifo said. “The economic
development in  Europe , especially in the euro area, remains
particularly weak.”  Austria’s economy relies on exports from companies like
 Voestalpine AG (VOE) , the maker of specialty steel, and  Andritz AG (ANDR) ,
the world’s No. 2 hydro-power-turbine maker. Wifo scaled back
projected export growth in 2013 to 1.8 percent from a previously
forecast 3.8 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
