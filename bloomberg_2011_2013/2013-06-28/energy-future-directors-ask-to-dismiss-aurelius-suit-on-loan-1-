Energy Future Holdings Corp.
directors asked a federal court to dismiss Aurelius Capital
Management’s lawsuit, saying the hedge fund bought the power
producer’s debt in a bid to profit from litigation.  Aurelius sued in March over loans made within the company,
saying the financing extended to the parent company from a
subsidiary harmed creditors. The directors said today in court
papers that Aurelius can’t sue because it previously
“ratified” the loans at issue in the case.  “Aurelius is not an innocent creditor that had the
misfortune of making an investment only later to see that
investment deteriorate,” lawyers said in the filing in federal
court in  Dallas . “Just the opposite -- Aurelius saw an
opportunity to manufacture a contrived injury.”  Energy Future, formerly known as TXU Corp., was taken over
in a $48 billion buyout in 2007 led by  KKR & Co. (KKR) , TPG Capital
and Goldman Sachs Capital Partners. A proposal in April to place
one part of the business that owes $32 billion into bankruptcy
was rejected by creditors.  The case is Aurelius Capital Master Ltd. v. Acosta, 13-cv-01173, U.S. District Court, Northern District of  Texas  (Dallas).  To contact the reporter on this story:
