Chrysler Group LLC said it will
offer a V-6 diesel engine as an option for Ram 1500 pickup
trucks.  The 3-liter diesel engine will be priced $2,850 more than
the 5.7-liter Hemi gasoline V-8, according to an e-mailed
statement. Chrysler also offers the pickup with a 3.6-liter V-6
gasoline engine.  Pickups are a major source of profit for Auburn Hills,
Michigan-based Chrysler as well as competitors  General Motors
Co. (GM)  and  Ford Motor Co. (F)  Ram pickup sales surged 23 percent this
year through May, better than Chryslerâ€™s total 9 percent gain
during that period. Chrysler is majority owned by Turin, Italy-based  Fiat SpA. (F)   GM, based in Detroit, is introducing redesigned Chevrolet
Silverado and GMC Sierra large pickups. Dearborn, Michigan-based
Ford in January unveiled a prototype of a revamped F-150 pickup
called Atlas that foreshadowed its future trucks.  To contact the reporter on this story:
