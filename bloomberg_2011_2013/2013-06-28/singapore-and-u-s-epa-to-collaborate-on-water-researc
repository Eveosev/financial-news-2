Singapore ’s national water agency
and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency agreed to
collaborate on urban water issues by exchanging technical and
scientific information.  The memorandum of understanding, signed yesterday in
Singapore, targets areas including drinking water, watershed
management, and development for wastewater recovery, the EPA and
the PUB, as Singapore’s agency is known, said in a  statement 
posted on PUB’s website and confirmed by the EPA.  The two countries have worked together as members of the
Global Water Research Coalition since 2007 on water quality and
health programs. Chew Men Leong, PUB’s chief executive, and
David Adelman, the U.S. ambassador to Singapore, signed the
agreement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
