Brazil  is keeping its inflation
target unchanged through 2015 even after consumer prices this
month rose at the fastest annual pace since November 2011.  The National Monetary Council made up of central bank and
government officials held its quarterly meeting today and
decided to maintain the 4.5 percent midpoint of its 2.5 percent
to 6.5 percent range for 2014 and 2015. It also held the long-term lending rate at a record low 5 percent, where it has
remained since December.  Since inflation breached the target range in March, the
central bank has increased the benchmark rate by 75 basis points
in two successive meetings. Even as the price of foodstuffs has
eased, inflation has been fanned by President Dilma Rousseff’s
stimulus measures aimed at propping up consumer demand, and in
the year through mid-June again accelerated above the target
range.  “There wasn’t an alternative; the best thing at this
moment was leaving the target unchanged,”  Roberto Padovani ,
chief economist at Votorantim Ctvm Ltda, said by telephone from
 Sao Paulo . “Raising the target would be bad for expectations
and lowering it would not be credible,”  Annual inflation has remained above the central bank’s 4.5
percent target every month since Alexandre Tombini became bank
President in January 2011. Central bankers, in their quarterly
inflation report released on June 27, said inflation will reach
6 percent this year should the benchmark rate remain unchanged
at 8 percent, up from a March forecast of 5.7 percent.  Economists expect price increases to reach 5.86 percent at
year-end, compared to their March forecast of 5.71 percent,
according to a central bank survey published on June 24.  To contact the reporters on this story:
