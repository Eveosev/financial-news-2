Soybean farmers in the U.S., the
worldâ€™s biggest producer, are seen planting a record-high
soybean crop, the  U.S. Department of Agriculture  said.  About 77.728 million acres will be sown this year, the U.S.
Department of Agriculture said  today , after polling farmers this
month. Analysts expected 77.811 million acres (31.49 million
hectares), according to a Bloomberg survey. The USDA said in
March that growers intended to plant 77.126 million, down from a
record 77.198 million last year.  The USDA surveyed more than 70,000 farmers by telephone,
mail, the Internet and personal interviews during the first two
weeks of June, with respondents selected randomly from across
the U.S.  Soybean futures for November delivery, after the harvest,
dropped 2.2 percent this month through yesterday to $12.7525 a
bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade.  The USDA estimated the number of acres that will be
harvested at 76.918 million, up from 76.2 million projected on
June 12.  Farmers also were asked by the USDA about use of
genetically modified seeds produced by  Monsanto Co. (MON)  and  Dupont
Co. (DD)  About 93 percent of the total soybean acreage was planted
with gene-engineered seeds this year, unchanged from a year
earlier, the government said.  Soybeans are the biggest U.S. crop after corn, with a 2012
value of $43.2 billion, government figures show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
