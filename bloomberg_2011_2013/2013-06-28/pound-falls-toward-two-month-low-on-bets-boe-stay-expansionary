The pound fell toward the weakest
level in two months versus the euro amid speculation Mark Carney
will maintain the Bank of England’s accommodative monetary
policy when he becomes central bank governor next week.  Sterling headed for weekly losses versus the dollar and
euro after BOE policy maker David Miles said this week that
growth in the U.K. remains “anemic” and renewed his call for
more asset purchases. Carney will replace current Governor
Mervyn King on July 1 and the next policy decision will be
announced July 4. U.K. government bonds declined.  “Several BOE members have sounded somewhat more dovish in
recent commentary,”  Hans Redeker , head of global foreign-exchange strategy at Morgan Stanley in  London , wrote in a note
to clients. “The next BOE meeting will be Carney’s first. We do
not expect an immediate shift in tone but we do expect he will
eventually incorporate more interest rate guidance into his
policy making,” which could weigh on the pound, they wrote.  The pound fell 0.4 percent to 85.77 pence per euro at 2:14
p.m. in London after depreciating to 85.99 pence on May 30, the
weakest level since April 17. The U.K. currency declined 0.l
percent to $1.5247.  To contact the reporter on this story:
