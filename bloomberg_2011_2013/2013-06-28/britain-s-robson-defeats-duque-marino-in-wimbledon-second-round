Britain’s Laura Robson beat Mariana
Duque-Marino of Colombia in straight sets under the closed roof
of Centre Court at Wimbledon as rain delayed some matches.  Robson won 6-4, 6-1 over the qualifier in a second-round
match held over because of wet weather yesterday. Robson won 5
of her 9 break points today.  “My timing was a bit off,” Robson said. “From the
begining of the match, I had to be aware of that and control
it.’  Today, the fifth day of Wimbledon, Britain’s Andy Murray
plays Spain’s Tommy Robredo in the third round, while David
Ferrer, the No. 4 seed, faces fellow Spaniard Roberto Bautista
Agut in a second-round match. Petra Kvitova, the champion two
years ago from the Czech Republic, meets  Russia ’s Ekaterina
Makarova. After a short delay, play on most courts started
shortly after 1 p.m. local time.  Grega Zemlja of Slovenia defeated  Bulgaria ’s Grigor
Dimitrov 3-6, 7-6 (7-4), 3-6, 6-4, 11-9 in a match halted
yesterday because of rain.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
