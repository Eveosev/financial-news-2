Chrysler Group LLC’s U.S. vehicle
sales rose in June, extending the automaker’s streak of monthly
increases.  “We will achieve our 39th consecutive month of year-over-year sales growth,”  Reid Bigland , Chrysler’s head of U.S.
sales, told reporters today at the automaker’s proving grounds
in Chelsea, Michigan. “We’ve seen it pretty consistent. I would
say good, not weak, not great, just kind of good, in the month
of June.”  Sales for Chrysler, majority owned by  Fiat SpA (F) , have
benefited from redesigned Ram pickups, Jeep sport-utility
vehicles and the new Dodge Dart. This year through May, the
company’s U.S. deliveries gained 9 percent, better than the
industrywide 7.3 percent increase.  Chrysler’s Ram pickups surged 23 percent in the first five
months, mimicking similar increases for large pickups at  General
Motors Co. (GM)  and Ford Motor Co. Pickups are the major source of
profit at the three automakers and deliveries of the trucks were
helped by record energy production and a housing recovery. Fiat
is relying on Chrysler to offset losses at the Turin, Italy-based company’s mass-market brands in  Europe .  To contact the reporter on this story:
