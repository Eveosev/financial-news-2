Seattle-based Microsoft founder Bill Gates — and second richest man in the world — remarkably, doesn't own an excess of properties. Previously, when his horse-loving daughter competed in Florida, the multi-billionaire rented homes for his family rather than buying. Not any longer. According to  South Florida's Gossip Extra  and property records, Gates now owns a place in Wellington, FL, paying $8.7 million in cash. The Mediterranean-style residence is vastly different and much smaller than Gates'  high-tech and modern compound  spanning over 5 acres with 50,050 square feet of living space on Lake Washington, about 8 miles east of Seattle. The home Gates just purchased in Wellington is  reportedly  a residence he and his family rented last year in January while his teenage daughter competed in the  Winter Equestrian Festival . Built in 2010, the estate has 4 beds and 4 baths with a 7,234-square-foot, open floor plan. Horse-friendly features like a 20-stall barn and show-jumping arena were likely part of Gates' decision to buy the home. Gates isn't the only business man buying in Wellington. New York City Mayor and Bloomberg Founder Michael Bloomberg has a home there as well as the former owner of the L.A. Dodgers, Frank McCourt.
