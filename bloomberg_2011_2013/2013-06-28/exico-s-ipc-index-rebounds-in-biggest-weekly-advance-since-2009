Mexico ’s IPC  index  rose the most
among major stock benchmarks in the Americas and Europe today,
capping its biggest weekly advance since 2009 after plunging on
June 20 to a one-year low.  The IPC rose 2.5 percent to 40,623.30 at the close in
Mexico City. The index gained 6.8 percent on the week, the most
since July 2009. Steelmaker  Industrias CH SAB (ICHB)  was the biggest
gainer today, while homebuilders Desarrolladora Homex SAB, Urbi
Desarrollos Urbanos SAB, and Corp. Geo SAB were the  week’s best
performers .  Global stocks had plunged earlier in June amid speculation
that the U.S. Federal Reserve is moving to taper monetary
stimulus that has pushed investors to put money into higher-yielding  emerging markets . Last week the index fell to 14.9
times analysts’ earnings  estimates , the cheapest since June
2012.  “Valuations reached a very low level,” Luis Rodriguez,
the director of research at Casa de Bolsa Finamex SAB in
Guadalajara, Mexico, said by phone. “All emerging markets had a
good week, and there are some good fundamentals in the Mexican
economy that have been recognized by the market, so the bounce
was larger,”  The IPC is still down 7.1 percent on the year.  Industrias CH gained 7.9 percent to 85.55 pesos today.
 Homex (HOMEX*)  climbed 5.4 percent to 8.16 pesos, extending this week’s
gains to 16 percent. Urbi gained 7.2 percent to 2.37 pesos
today, advancing 16 percent in the past five days. Corp. Geo
gained 1.5 percent today to 5.55 pesos, climbing 14 percent for
the week.  The MSCI Emerging Markets Index rose 2.3 percent at the
close in New York, extending its weekly rally to 4.4 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
