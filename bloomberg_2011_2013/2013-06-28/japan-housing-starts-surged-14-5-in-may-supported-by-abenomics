Japan ’s  housing starts  rose for a
ninth month in May, the longest streak since the period ended
February 2011, as the government’s pledge to end 15 years of
deflation fueled expectations for a recovery in property prices.  Construction companies broke ground on 14.5 percent more
homes last month from a year earlier, according to a report
released today by the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure,
Transport and Tourism in Tokyo. Housing starts were expected to
rise 6.1 percent, based on the median  estimate  of 24 economists
in a  Bloomberg News survey .  An unprecedented monetary easing under Bank of Japan
Governor Haruhiko Kuroda and increased government spending under
Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s leadership have helped bolster
 consumer confidence . About 35 percent of 2,478 people surveyed
in April by  Haseko Corp. (1808) , a condominium builder, said now is the
time to buy a house, an increase from 30 percent in January.  “The biggest change after Abe is the expectation of asset
prices and housing prices,”  Masahiro Mochizuki , an analyst at
Credit Suisse Group AG in Tokyo, said. “By purchasing real
estate, people now have an opportunity to make profit.”  Housing starts  rose to an annualized 1.027 million units in
May, matching October 2008, the report showed. They were
expected to rise to 950,000 units, according to the median
estimate of 19 economists surveyed.  The Topix Real Estate Index, a measure of 43 property-related stocks, closed at a one-month high in Tokyo, rising 5.6
percent.  Tokyo Supply  In 2012, housing starts gained for a third year, up 6.2
percent and the fastest pace since 1996, after declining 22
percent in the 10 years to the end of 2010 from the previous
decade, according to land ministry data.  They will reach as many as 940,000 units for the fiscal
year ending March 2014, the highest level since 2008, according
to an estimate by Hidetaka Yoneyama, a senior researcher at
Fujitsu Research Institute in  Tokyo .  The supply of new apartments in Tokyo’s metropolitan area
this year will reach the highest level since 2007 to meet rising
demand, according to an estimate by the Real Estate Economic
Institute. The number of condominiums put up for sale will rise
9.6 percent to about 50,000 units in 2013, according to the
Tokyo-based industry researcher.  In May, the offering surged 49 percent to 4,967 apartments
from a year ago, marking the biggest gain in more than a year,
the researcher said on June 17.  To contact the reporter on this story:
