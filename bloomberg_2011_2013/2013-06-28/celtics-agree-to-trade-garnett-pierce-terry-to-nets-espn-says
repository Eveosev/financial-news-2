The  Boston  Celtics agreed in
principle to a trade that will send Kevin Garnett, Paul Pierce
and Jason Terry to the Brooklyn Nets, ESPN reported, citing
unidentified people close to the process.  The deal was sealed when center Garnett waived a no-trade
clause in his contract, ESPN said during its televised coverage
of last night’s National Basketball Association draft.  The trade cannot become official until July 10, when a
league-wide moratorium on signings and trades is lifted after
free agency begins July 1, the network reported.  The Nets, who hired Jason Kidd as coach two weeks ago, will
send forward Gerald Wallace and first-round draft picks in 2014,
2016 and 2018 to Boston, ESPN said. The Celtics also will get
Tornike Shengelia, Reggie Evans, Keith Bogans and rights to the
expiring contract of Kris Humphries.  Garnett, 37, a 15-time All-Star, was the league’s Most
Valuable Player in 2004 and is the only player in NBA history
with 25,000 points, 10,000 rebounds, 5,000 assists, 1,500 steals
and 1,500 blocks.  Garnett and 10-time All-Star forward Pierce, 35, who helped
lead the Celtics to the NBA championship in 2008, would join
three-time All-Star guard Deron Williams, six-time All-Star
guard Joe Johnson and 2013 All-Star center Brook Lopez on the
Nets.  Garnett and Pierce appeared to be headed to the Los Angeles
Clippers last week, along with Boston coach Doc Rivers. Though
the player trade did not happen, the Celtics agreed to release
Rivers from the final three years of his contract and send him
to the Clippers in exchange for a 2015 first-round pick.  To contact the reporter on this story:
