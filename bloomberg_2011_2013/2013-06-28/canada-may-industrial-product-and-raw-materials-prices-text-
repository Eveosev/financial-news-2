The following is the text of the
industrial product and raw material prices report as reported
by  Statistics Canada .  The Industrial Product Price Index (IPPI) was unchanged
from April. Higher prices for petroleum and coal products offset
declines for primary metal products and lumber and other wood
products. The Raw Materials Price Index (RMPI) rose 0.2% in May,
mostly as a result of higher prices for animals and animal
products.  Industrial Product Price Index, monthly change  The IPPI remained at the same level in May, after falling
0.9% in April. Of the 21 major product groups, 7 were up, 8 were
down and 6 were unchanged.  Petroleum and coal products (+1.1%) posted the largest gain,
following two consecutive declines. The increase was mainly a
result of higher prices for gasoline (+3.6%). The IPPI excluding
petroleum and coal products was down 0.2% in May.  The advance in petroleum and coal products was largely
offset by declines in primary metal products (-1.1%) and lumber
and other wood products (-1.1%).  The decrease in primary metal products was attributable
mostly to lower prices for other non-ferrous metal products (-
2.8%), specifically gold and gold alloys in primary form as well
as silver and platinum. Nickel products (-4.2%) and aluminum
products (-0.9%) were also down. With the exception of February,
prices for primary metal products have been falling since the
beginning of 2013.  The decline in lumber and other wood products was largely
because of lower prices for lumber and ties (-2.0%) and, to a
lesser extent, softwood veneer and plywood (-6.3%).  Industrial Product Price Index, 12-month change  Compared with May 2012, the IPPI was unchanged, after
edging down 0.1% in April.  The largest advance was in lumber and other wood products
(+6.9%), specifically lumber and ties (+11.5%). Prices for
lumber and other wood products remained on the upward trend that
started in February 2012.  Prices for motor vehicles and other transportation
equipment (+0.6%) also increased on a year-over-year basis,
mostly because of the 1.0% depreciation in the Canadian dollar
relative to the US dollar. Without the measurable effect of the
 exchange rate , the IPPI would have fallen 0.2% instead of
remaining unchanged.  Among the other product groups that advanced were fruit,
vegetables, feeds and other food products (+1.2%) as well as
electrical and communications products (+1.6%).  Conversely, primary metal products (-5.1%) and chemical
products (-2.1%) largely offset the year-over-year price
increases.  Compared with May 2012, the decrease in primary metal
products was attributable mostly to lower prices for other non-ferrous metal products (-10.3%), particularly gold and gold
alloys in primary form as well as silver and platinum. Year-over-year, prices for primary metal products have declined since
November 2011.  Chemical products were down on a year-over-year basis,
mainly as a result of lower prices for fertilizers (-18.2%),
specifically urea (-29.8%).  Raw Materials Price Index, monthly change  Following two consecutive decreases, the RMPI rose 0.2% in
May. Of the major product groups, 4 were up, 2 were down and 1
was unchanged.  The largest contributor to the increase of the RMPI was
animals and animal products (+2.8%), mostly because of higher
prices for hogs-swine for slaughter (+10.2%) and cattle for
slaughter (+4.5%). It was the largest increase since June 2012
for animals and animal products.  To a lesser extent, vegetable products (+1.0%) also
contributed to the RMPI advance, largely because of higher
prices for grain (+1.6%), natural rubber and allied gums (+4.2%)
and oilseeds (+1.2%).  Conversely, the advance of the RMPI was moderated mainly by
non-ferrous metals (-1.4%) and ferrous materials (-5.3%).  The decline in non-ferrous metals was largely attributable
to lower prices for precious metals (-4.6%), copper and nickel
concentrates (-0.7%) and non-ferrous metal scrap (-1.1%). It was
the third consecutive decrease for non-ferrous metals.  The decline in ferrous materials was led by lower prices
for  iron ore  (-9.2%).  Raw Materials Price Index, 12-month change  Compared with May 2012, the RMPI was down 0.8%, continuing
the downward trend that began in March 2012.  Non-ferrous metals (-7.2%) posted the largest year-over-year decrease, mainly as a result of lower prices for
radioactive concentrates (-20.9%), copper and nickel
concentrates (-6.2%) and precious metals (-10.9%).  Mineral fuels (-0.8%) also contributed to the year-over-year RMPI decline, mostly because of lower prices for crude oil
(-1.1%).  Compared with the same month a year earlier, animals and
animal products (+4.6%) moderated the decline of the RMPI,
specifically hogs-swine for slaughter (+11.5%) and cattle for
slaughter (+5.8%). Wood products and vegetable products were
also up on a year-over-year basis.  Note to readers  With each release, data for the previous six months may
have been revised. The indexes are not seasonally adjusted.  The Industrial Product  Price Index  (IPPI) reflects the
prices that producers in  Canada  receive as the goods leave the
plant gate. It does not reflect what the consumer pays. Unlike
the  Consumer Price Index , the IPPI excludes indirect taxes and
all the costs that occur between the time a good leaves the
plant and the time the final user takes possession of it,
including the transportation, wholesale, and retail costs.  Canadian producers export many goods. They often indicate
their prices in foreign currencies, especially in US dollars,
which are then converted into Canadian dollars. In particular,
this is the case for motor vehicles, pulp, paper and wood
products. Therefore, a rise or fall in the value of the Canadian
dollar against its US counterpart affects the IPPI. But the
conversion into Canadian dollars only reflects how respondents
provide their prices. This is not a measure that takes the full
effect of exchange rates into account.  The conversion of prices received in US dollars is based on
the average monthly exchange rate (noon spot rate) established
by the  Bank of Canada , and it is available on CANSIM in table
176-0064 (series v37426). Monthly and annual variations in the
exchange rate, as described in the release, are calculated
according to the indirect quotation of the exchange rate (for
example, CAN$1 = US$X).  The Raw Materials Price Index (RMPI) reflects the prices
paid by Canadian manufacturers for key raw materials. Many of
those prices are set on the world market. However, as few prices
are denominated in foreign currencies, their conversion into
Canadian dollars has only a minor effect on the calculation of
the RMPI.  Upcoming changes: Basket update and new classification  Statistics Canada is undertaking two important initiatives
for the IPPI and the RMPI program.  Changes will soon be made in the IPPI and RMPI
classification, and the basket will be updated (2010=100). These
changes will be made at the end of 2013. For more information,
