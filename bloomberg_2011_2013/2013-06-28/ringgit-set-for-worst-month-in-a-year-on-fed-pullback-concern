Malaysia’s ringgit headed for its
worst month since May 2012 as the prospect of the Federal
Reserve phasing out stimulus that has boosted the supply of
dollars cut demand for the nation’s assets.  The currency touched the weakest level in almost three
years after Fed Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said June 19 that $85
billion a month of bond buying will probably be tapered this
year and ended in 2014 as long as the  U.S. economy  performs in
line with its projections. The yield on five-year  government
bonds  was set for its biggest monthly increase since March 2011,
while the cost to insure them against default touched the
highest level since January 2012 this week.  The ringgit declined 2.8 percent this month and 0.3 percent
today to 3.1831 per dollar as of 9:41 a.m. in  Kuala Lumpur ,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The currency touched
3.2222 on June 24, the weakest since July 2010, and has lost 2.8
percent this quarter.  “What we’re seeing is that the world has to start learning
to live with less quantitative easing,” said Jimmy Koh, the
head of research at United Overseas Bank Ltd. in  Singapore .
“Countries like Malaysia and Indonesia have been the main
beneficiaries of liquidity flows globally.”  Overseas investors held 32 percent of Malaysian sovereign
debt at the end of April, the latest official data show. The
cost of insuring the country’s debt using five-year credit-default swaps rose 30 basis points to 119 this month through
yesterday, according to data provider CMA, which is owned by
McGraw-Hill Cos. and compiles prices quoted by dealers in the
privately negotiated market. The rate touched 147 on June 24,
the highest since January 2012.  Bonds, Volatility  Any decision to reduce the pace of asset purchases wouldn’t
represent a withdrawal of stimulus, and an increase in the Fed’s
benchmark interest rate is “very likely to be a long way off,”
 Federal Reserve  Bank of  New York  President William C. Dudley
said in remarks prepared for delivery yesterday.  The yield on the 3.26 percent bonds due March 2018 climbed
23 basis points in June to 3.51 percent, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. The yield fell two basis points, or 0.02
percentage point, today, paring its quarterly advance to 29
basis points.  One-month implied volatility in the ringgit, a measure of
expected moves in exchange rates used to price options, rose
1.53 percentage points this month to 9.34 percent and increased
24 basis points today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
