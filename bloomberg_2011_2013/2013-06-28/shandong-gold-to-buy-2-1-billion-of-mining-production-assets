Shandong Gold Mining Co. (600547) ,  China ’s
second-largest gold company by value, plans to buy about 13
billion  yuan  ($2.1 billion) of production and mining assets from
its parent and four other parties.  Shandong Gold will finance part of the purchase with a 9.98
billion yuan share swap, according to a  statement  to the
 Shanghai Stock Exchange  today. The company will raise as much as
3 billion yuan through a private share sale to 10 unidentified
investors to fund the remainder, it said.  The company is seeking acquisitions as demand for the
bullion in the Asian nation is set to rise. China may overtake
 India  as the largest gold consumer this year as regulators make
investing in the metal easier, according to the China Gold
Association. The world’s second-largest economy approved its
first two domestic ETPs backed by the metal this month.  Gold output in China, the world’s largest producer, is
poised to rise almost 10 percent this year to a record even as
bullion prices slump, the nation’s mining association said this
month.  Today’s acquisitions aim at strengthening gold reserves,
expanding production, and improving competitiveness, Shandong
Gold said.  The miner’s shares have been suspended since April 3,
pending an announcement on a major asset restructuring, the
company said in an exchange statement on April 2.  --Liza Lin. Editors: Gregory Turk, Indranil Ghosh  To contact the reporters on this story:
