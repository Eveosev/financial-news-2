U.S. wheat growers will plant 1.4
percent more acres with the grain this year than they did in
2012, the fourth straight increase, according to the government.  About 56.53 million acres (22.9 million hectares) were
planted with wheat, up from 56.44 million forecast in March and
55.74 million in 2012, the  U.S. Department of Agriculture  said
today in a report based on a survey of farmers. Analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg news expected 55.83 million acres to be
seeded with wheat.  Growers from  Minnesota  to  Washington  planted 12.295 million
acres with spring wheat, used to make bread, up from 12.289
million in 2012, the USDA said. Analysts expected 12.087
million. Durum wheat, used in pasta, may be planted on 1.538
million acres, down from 2.123 million last year, according to
the government. Analysts expected 1.703 million.  Wheat futures on the Chicago Board of Trade dropped 13
