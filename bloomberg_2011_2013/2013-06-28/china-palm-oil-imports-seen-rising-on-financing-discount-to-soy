China’s  palm oil  imports may rise to
a record as its discount to domestic  soybean oil  widens and as
traders in the second-biggest buyer use the commodity as
collateral for loans, a survey by Bloomberg shows.  Imports in the year through Sept. 30 may total 6.7 million
metric tons and average 475,000 tons each month from June to
September, according to the median of six estimates from China-based analysts and traders. Last year’s total was 5.8 million
tons, customs data show.  As much as 75 percent of inbound shipments are done by
traders who also use the cooking oil to obtain financing,
according to state-owned researcher Grain.gov.cn. The discount
of benchmark palm futures traded in  Malaysia  to soy futures in
China has  averaged  $545 a ton since Oct. 1, compared to $484
over the preceding 12 months, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  “The cash crunch that  China ’s in spurs buying to raise
capital,” said Leon Xia, an analyst at Shanghai JC Intelligence
Co. Xia said demand may also benefit through summer, when warmer
weather makes it easier to mix palm with other cooking oils.  The contract for September delivery on Bursa Malaysia
Derivatives rose 0.9 percent to at 2,375 ringgit ($749) a metric
ton at 12:30 p.m. local time. Futures are in a  bear market  and
have lost 21 percent in the last 12 months.  On China’s the  Dalian Commodity Exchange , refined palm oil
for January delivery rose 0.6 percent to 5,860 yuan ($954) a
ton, while soybean oil gained 0.4 percent to 7,330  yuan .  Speculative Lending  Informal lending involving traders who use commodities and
other goods as collateral flourishes in China because the
nation’s small businesses have trouble getting bank loans,
according to Citic Securities Co. Money-market rates touched the
highest level last week since at least 2003 amid efforts by the
government to wring speculative lending out of the financial
system.  Palm imports that totaled 4.8 million tons in the eight
months through May 31, compared with 4 million tons a year ago,
boosted inventory in China to a record of 1.6 million tons that
month, said Chen Kai, an analyst at Shanghai Pansun Cereals &
Oils Development Co. Stocks declined to 1.28 million tons this
week, he said.  Global stockpiles are rising the most since 1999, with U.S.
Department of Agriculture data showing them poised to jump 21
percent to a record 9.5 million metric tons in 2013-2014.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story: William Bi in
