Sunfonda Group , a Chinese auto
dealership that sells Audi cars, plans to raise about $150
million in a Hong Kong initial public offering, said two people
with knowledge of the matter.  The Xi’an, Shaanxi-based company is working with  Goldman
Sachs Group Inc. (GS)  and  JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM)  on the IPO, said the
people, who asked not to be identified because the information
is private. The sale may take place in 2014, one person said.  Sunfonda would become the sixth auto dealer to list shares
in Hong Kong since the start of 2010. The other five, including
 Baoxin Auto Group Ltd. (1293)  have lost an average of about 23 percent
from their IPO prices as sales in China slowed.  Founded in 2000, Sunfonda was the first Audi dealership in
the western Chinese province, according to its website. Company
officials didn’t respond to calls made to its Xi’an office
seeking comment.  Sales of premium cars in China will probably increase about
4 percent this year, Bob Socia,  General Motors Co. (GM) ’s China head,
said this month. That’s about half the pace that the U.S.
automaker had expected at the start of 2013.  China Harmony Auto Holding Ltd. (3836) , a Zhengzhou, Henan-based
luxury auto dealership, raised about $220 million in a Hong Kong
IPO this month. The stock had lost 21 percent from its offer
price as of yesterday’s close.  Audi Demand  China Yongda Automobiles Services Holdings Ltd. (3669) , which also
sells Audis among other luxury brands, is the only Hong Kong-listed automaker to still trade above its IPO price, data
compiled by Bloomberg show. At HK$6.85 apiece, the shares are up
about 4 percent since their debut.  Volkswagen AG’s Audi, the bestselling premium brand in
China, sold 407,738 vehicles last year, according to researcher
LMC Automotive in  Shanghai . Bayerische Motoren Werke AG ranked
second having sold 313,638 while Daimler AG’s Mercedes-Benz was
third with 207,099, LMC reports.  The three German luxury automakers, which all build cars in
China, have quadrupled their local production in the last five
years and now account for about 75 percent of the premium cars
sold in the world’s biggest auto market, LMC data show.  To contact the reporters on this story:
