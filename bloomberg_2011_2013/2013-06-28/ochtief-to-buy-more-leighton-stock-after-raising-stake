Hochtief AG (HOT) ,  Germany ’s largest
construction company, said it will buy more stock in  Leighton
Holdings Ltd. (LEI)  after raising its stake in the Australian builder
to almost 55 percent for about A$74 million ($69 million).  Hochtief, which is controlled by Madrid-based Actividades
de Construccion & Servicios SA, purchased about 4.8 million
shares in Sydney-based Leighton, the companies said in separate
statements, without specifying a price. Leighton  fell  2.2
percent to A$15.45 at the close in Sydney, valuing the purchase
at A$74.2 million.  “We see Leighton as a strategic investment and as our core
business,” because of “excellent growth opportunities and a
very good market position,” Hochtief Chief Executive Officer
Marcelino Fernandez Verdes said in his company’s statement. “We
intend to further increase our share in Leighton.”  The German company has been consolidating shareholdings
after agreeing to sell its airport business to Public Sector
Pension Investment Board of Canada in May. The transaction will
give Essen-based Hochtief a 1.1 billion-euro windfall upon
completion. The German builder announced plans June 14 to buy
back as much as 260 million euros of shares by mid-December,
increasing its stake in itself to 10 percent. That will boost
the voting rights held by parent ACS to almost 60 percent.  Hochtief  rose  as much as 0.6 percent to 50.46 euros at 9:37
a.m. in  Frankfurt . The stock has gained 15 percent this year,
valuing the builder at 3.88 billion euros.  The company, whose past projects include Frankfurt’s
Commerzbank tower, has been the majority shareholder in Leighton
since 2001, according to its  website . Its voting rights in
Leighton increased to 54.96 percent from 54.29 percent,
according to an Australian filing.  ACS currently owns 49.9 percent of Hochtief’s outstanding
shares with 54.3 percent of the voting rights, according to the
company’s website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
