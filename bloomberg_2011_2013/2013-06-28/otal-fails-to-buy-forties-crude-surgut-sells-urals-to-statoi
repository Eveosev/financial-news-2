buy Russian Urals crude without success at a lower differential
to Dated Brent than in the previous session.  OAO Surgutneftegas sold 100,000 metric tons of Urals for
July 12 to July 13 loading from Ust-Luga to Statoil at a premium
of about 45 to 50 cents a barrel to Dated Brent, said three
traders who participate in the market, asking not to be
