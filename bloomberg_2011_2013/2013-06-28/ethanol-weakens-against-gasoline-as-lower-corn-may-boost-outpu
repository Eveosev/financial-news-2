Ethanol weakened against gasoline
for a second day on speculation that cheaper manufacturing costs
will boost production of the biofuel.  The discount, or price difference, widened 2.54 cents to
29.9 cents a gallon after the Agriculture Department said
farmers may plant 97.379 million acres of corn, the most since
1936. Corn is the primary ingredient in U.S.-made ethanol.  “We’ll see a gradual increase in production,” said  Terry Reilly , senior commodity analyst at Futures International LLC in
 Chicago . “Cheaper corn prices are on the horizon.”  Denatured ethanol for July delivery slipped 1.6 cents to
$2.453 a gallon on the Chicago Board of Trade. Prices are up 12
percent this year and are little changed this quarter.  Gasoline for July delivery rose 0.94 cents to $2.752 a
gallon on the  New York Mercantile Exchange . The contract covers
reformulated gasoline, made to be blended with ethanol before
delivery to filling stations.  One bushel of corn makes at least 2.75 gallons of the
renewable fuel. Prices for the grain reached a record $8.49 a
bushel in August after last summer’s U.S. drought scorched crops
and eroded returns to make ethanol.  Corn for July delivery climbed 12 cents, or 1.8 percent, to
$6.7925 a bushel in Chicago. The corn crush spread, or the cost
difference between a gallon of ethanol and the corn needed to
make it was minus 2 cents, compared with minus 35 cents on Dec.
31, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Cash Market  In cash market trading, ethanol was unchanged at $2.665 a
gallon on the West Coast, data compiled by Bloomberg show. The
additive decreased 2.5 cents to $2.475 in Chicago, 1.5 cents to
$2.55 on the Gulf Coast and 0.5 cent to $2.535 in  New York ,  West Coast ethanol’s premium to the U.S. Gulf expanded 1.5
cents to 11.5 cents, while Chicago’s discount to New York Harbor
increased 2 cents to 6 cents.  Output of the fuel gained 15 percent to 885,000 barrels a
day in the week ended June 21 from a record low of 770,000
barrels a day in January, according to the Energy Information
Administration. Stockpiles of the fuel have rebounded 1.9
percent to 16.3 million barrels from the all-time low of 15.9
million on June 7.  Ethanol-blended gasoline made up about 95 percent of the
total U.S. gasoline pool last week, up from 94 percent the
previous week.  Ethanol imports  fell 42 percent to 38,000 barrels
a day, said the EIA, the Energy Department’s statistical arm.  Brazilian Price  Anhydrous ethanol in  Sao Paulo  cost $2.25 a gallon in the
week ended June 21, the lowest price since Nov. 9, data compiled
by Bloomberg show.  Compliance with a law that requires refiners to use 13.8
billion gallons of ethanol in gasoline is tracked by Renewable
Identification Numbers, or RINs. Companies can submit the
credits to the government or trade them.  Corn-based ethanol RINs  rose 2 cents to 97 cents, the
highest price since March 11, while  advanced RINs , which cover
biodiesel and Brazilian sugarcane-based ethanol, jumped 7 cents
to $1.08, the most since March 8, data compiled by Bloomberg
show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
