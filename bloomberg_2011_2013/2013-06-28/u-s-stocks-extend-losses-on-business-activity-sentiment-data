U.S. stocks extended losses as data
showed business activity cooled more than projected in June and
an index of consumer sentiment decreased.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index dropped 0.7 percent to
1,602.67 at 10:01 a.m. in  New York .  The MNI Chicago Report’s business barometer dropped to 51.6
this month from 58.7 in May, which was the highest in more than
a year. A reading of 50 is the dividing line between expansion
and contraction. The median forecast of 55 economists surveyed
by Bloomberg was 55.  The Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan final index of
U.S. consumer sentiment decreased to 84.1 in June from 84.5 the
prior month. The median forecast in a Bloomberg survey called
for 83 in the gauge after a preliminary reading of 82.7.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
