OAO Gazprom, Russia’s natural gas
exporter, said that  Turkey  may overtake Germany as its largest
customer on growing demand.  “Turkey, in the near future, may become our largest
importer, surpassing Germany,” Chief Executive Officer Alexey
Miller told journalists today in Moscow. Turkish demand may grow
by 20 percent from current levels, Miller said.  Europe’s gas use fell last year because of slower economic
growth and the availability of cheaper fuels like coal. That
trend will continue through next year, according to an
International Energy Agency report earlier this month. Turkey’s
dependence on oil and gas imports is growing, IEA Chief
Economist  Fatih Birol  said May 11.  Gazprom supplied 27 billion cubic meters of the fuel to
Turkey last year compared with 33 billion cubic meters to
Germany, according to Gazprom’s website.  To contact the reporters on this story:
