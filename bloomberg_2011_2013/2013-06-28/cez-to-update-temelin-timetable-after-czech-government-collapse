CEZ AS, the state-controlled Czech
power producer, will update the timetable for its $10 billion
Temelin nuclear-power expansion after the government collapsed
in the middle of bidding by contractors to build the project.  “The tender is still on,” CEZ’s spokeswoman Barbora
Pulpanova said today in a telephone interview. “Negotiations
with bidders should enter the next phase next week, and we’ll
make an announcement regarding the timetable of the tender.”  The interim government will lack the mandate to decide on
the tender, originally due to be completed by the summer, Prime
Minister Jiri Rusnok told the Hospodarske Noviny newspaper.  Rusnok was appointed by President Milos Zeman after the
collapse of the previous administration because of a scandal
over illegal spying and bribery allegations.  Westinghouse Electric Co. and a Russian-Czech group led by
Rosatom Corp. are the two remaining bidders to build the two new
reactors after  Areva SA (AREVA) ’s offer was excluded in October. CEZ, 70
percent state-owned, planned to sign a deal by the year-end.  Rusnok’s “government of experts,” as Zeman has called it,
needs to win a confidence vote in the lower house of parliament
that all parties have said they will reject. If it fails to win
the motion, Rusnok’s Cabinet will stay in office on a caretaker
basis until Zeman names a replacement or an election is held.  The next election ballot is scheduled for May 2014.  To contact the reporter on this story:
