Murray & Roberts Holdings Ltd. (MUR) ,
South Africa’s second-biggest builder by market value, will sell
its African construction products division to cut debt and
streamline businesses.  Murray & Roberts rose for the first time in four days in
Johannesburg trading after saying the disposal value will be
about 1.3 billion rand ($130.1 million) before transaction
costs. Buyers include Capitalworks, RMB Ventures Ltd. and
management, the Johannesburg-based company said in a statement.  “There was limited strategic fit between these businesses
and Murray & Roberts’s future growth aspirations in engineering
and construction,” Chief Executive Officer Henry Laas said in a
separate statement. The divestment will allow the company to
reduce debt on its South African balance sheet and invest in
industries and countries offering “the best long term growth
potential,” he said.  The  stock  advanced 4.7 percent, the steepest gain since
June 13, to 25.13 rand at the close in Johannesburg, valuing the
company at 11.2 billion rand.  Murray & Roberts is among 15 companies that agreed to
settle a combined fine of 1.46 billion rand for collusion over
contracts. South Africa’s construction industry is facing a
slowdown as the economy expands at a slower pace.  The company said it’s still in talks on the sale of its
Hall Longmore pipeline-supplier operation.  To contact the reporter on this story:
