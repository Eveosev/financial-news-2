Brazil ’s real fell, extending its
biggest quarterly decline in almost two years, on concern
President Dilma Rousseff’s attempt to placate street protesters
will widen the government’s budget deficit.  The currency depreciated 1.3 percent to 2.2269 per dollar
at 10:59 a.m. in Sao Paulo, deepening its drop in the second
quarter to 9.2 percent, the worst performance among 16 major
currencies tracked by Bloomberg after the Australian dollar.
Swap rates on contracts due in January 2016 climbed 21 basis
points, or 0.21 percentage point, to 10.66 percent, swelling
their increase since the end of March to 163 basis points.  Brazil’s budget deficit almost doubled to 14.5 billion
reais in May from 7.7 billion reais in the prior month, the
central bank reported today. Rousseff pledged 50 billion reais
more to improve urban public transportation when she met with
protest leaders June 24.  “There’s a lot of people that have been concerned about
the fiscal stance in Brazil,”  Eduardo Suarez , a Latin America
currency strategist at Bank of Nova Scotia, said in a phone
interview from Toronto.  The real briefly pared its decline after the central bank
said it would auction foreign-exchange swap contracts to stem
the currency’s two-month rout.  To contact the reporter on this story:
