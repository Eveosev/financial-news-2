Citigroup Inc. (C) , the third-biggest
U.S. lender by assets, agreed to sell its retail banking
operations in Uruguay to Itau Unibanco Holding SA as Chief
Executive Officer  Michael Corbat  scales back in some countries.  Itau will get a portfolio of more than 15,000 customers in
Uruguay for an undisclosed amount that “is not material,” the
Sao Paulo-based lender said in a statement posted today on its
website. Most of the assets in the deal are tied to Citigroup’s
credit-card operations, which made up about 6 percent of the
market in that country last year, according to the statement.  Corbat, 53, is exiting or scaling down Citigroup’s
operations in some of its markets outside the U.S. as he seeks
to eliminate costs at the New York-based lender. He announced
plans last year to pull back from consumer operations in five
countries including Uruguay, is mulling a withdrawal from
businesses in a further 21 countries, and agreed to sell the
Credicard unit in  Brazil  to Itau last month.  “Citi has been operating in Uruguay for almost a century
and is committed to serving its corporate and investment banking
clients there while maintaining its commitment towards the
economic and social development of the country,” Anthony
Ingham, a spokesman for Citigroup, said in an e-mailed
statement.  Paulo Marinho, a spokesman for Itau, declined to provide
any further comment on the deal.  To contact the reporter on this story:
