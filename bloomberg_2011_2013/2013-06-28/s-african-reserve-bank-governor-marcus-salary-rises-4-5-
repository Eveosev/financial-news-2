(Corrects time period in reference to deputy governors in
second paragraph.)  South African Reserve Bank Governor
 Gill Marcus ’s salary rose 4.5 percent last year, less than
inflation.  Marcus’s pay for the 12 months through March increased to 5
million rand ($505,000) from 4.8 million rand a year earlier,
the Reserve Bank said in its annual report released in Pretoria
today. Deputy Governor  Daniel Mminele ’s pay, including benefits,
increased 6.5 percent to 3.8 million rand. Mminele is the only
one of the three current deputy governors who was a member of
the Monetary Policy Committee for the full 12 months of each of
the past two financial years.  Policy makers agreed in 2003 to limit salary increases to
4.5 percent, the midpoint of the central bank’s 3 percent to 6
percent inflation target.  South Africa ’s inflation rate slowed
to 5.6 percent in May from 5.9 percent a month earlier, the
first decline in five months, according to the statistics
agency.  To contact the reporter on this story:
