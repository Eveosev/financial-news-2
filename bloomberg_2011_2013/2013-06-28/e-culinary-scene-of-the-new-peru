"God has spoken: The future of gastronomy is being cooked up in Peru," pronounced Spanish superstar chef Ferran Adrià. A glass of mind-blowing pisco in hand, Patrick Symmes takes a tasting tour and says, "Amen!" You have to take a paseo after dinner,  a ritual walk, or you face side effects. These include indigestion, melancholy, ill temper, alcohol poisoning, and social, cultural, gastronomic, and physical decline. We were walking back from dinner, through Miraflores, the beachside suburb of Lima, Peru's newly remade capital. The scene was both cool and cool—damp mist, nice houses, a pretty woman in a short skirt across the street. Julio waved at her. "¡Hola!" he called out. I thought he'd been drinking too much, but no. "She's nice," he said. "We were just out dancing last night." I had been dining with one of Lima's literary birds, Julio Villanueva Chang, the founding editor of Etiqueta Negra, the nation's best cultural magazine for at least a decade. We'd met at Fiesta, a Lima restaurant that put all my oldest memories of Peru in a modernist, almost Japanese box—a garden enclosed by a towering courtyard, Spanish tradition on modern Peruvian speed. Fiesta is known for its innovative use of the old ingredients in Peru's Andean larder. We shared a causa—a poor man's potato, mashed and stuffed with tuna. Here it was cloudlike and multilayered. I ate duck with rice—a fattylicious favorite of kettle cooking in modest homes. Here it was de- and reconstructed, a tender stack of meat on disks of beans and rice. We finished with Peruvian coffee and pisco, the clear brandy. Both are now lucrative, high-quality exports for Peru. At home in the States, my most perfectionist coffee shop stocks shade-grown Peruvian whole beans at $14.99 a pound. Julio told me that Lima was changing in front of his eyes. "The city is modernizing," he said. Peru is ten years into an unprecedented boom that has tripled the size of the economy—supporting stable growth, free elections, and peace. The old Latin American solidarity has combined with a new confidence in Peru's indigenous heritage. And the reputation of Peruvian food is "really bubbling over right now," Julio told me. Walking after dinner, I hardly recognized anything. The colonial center is patched up, the old Spanish balconies restored, the lights on everywhere. I tried to count the physical changes from 1992, when a month in this place—my first exposure to a Latin American megacity—engraved Lima on my mind. Streets once crowded with soldiers are now packed with revelers, blackened buildings have been reborn as apartments and offices. The slums are now three stories tall, mostly paved—miles of corner kiosks, hardware stores, hair salons, and huariques,the little hole-in-the-wall eateries of a busy people on the rise. It was as if someone had watered this dry desert and grown a new Peru. In some places this is literal: The eroded bluffs on the shoreline, which had always given the city a sort of abandoned, dirty face on the Pacific, are halfway through a conversion to irrigated green parks and promenades. Lima, once a one-night layover en route to Machu Picchu, is now a true capital again, a fun and significant place. What average Peruvians talk about—on buses, street corners, and walks through Miraflores—is making money or art, doing more business faster, investing, building, creating. Miraflores is already occupied by the shock troops of hipness, young Americans and Europeans learning the crystalline, almost seventeenth-century Spanish of the Peruvians while enjoying, en passant, a life of cheap housing and exploding culture. Buenos Aires is so over. Peruvians talk about money right up until the food is served. Peru is on its greatest run in about five centuries, and what stable currency, tolerable politicians, and middle-class dreams allow you is an obsession with eating. Peru's surging pride needed a vehicle: Only food is fundamental enough to carry a people. For Peruvians, food—its taste, variety, history, meaning, financial implications, branding, and cultural ownership—has become "like soccer in Brazil," says Gastón Acurio, the nation's most famous chef and entrepreneur. Peru is where New World really met Old World five hundred years ago. The Caribbean was bare and the Aztecs simple by comparison; in Peru the Spanish conquered an empire, drinking up silver and gold. For solid food, the Spaniards brought European techniques into the kitchens of the Americas, and added a royal touch: Lima was the seat of the Spanish empire for centuries, the viceroyal capital of Latin America. Sandra Gamio, the owner of culinary tour company Pica Peru, told me, "Anytime you are cooking for royalty, like in France, you have good food." Peru's cuisine relies on the supply of humble ingredients. What is cheap and local in Peru is expensive and stunning anywhere else. There are 84 distinct microclimates, from wet desert to dry Amazon, rain forests both high and low, rugged altiplano and sea level valleys. From rice to coffee, tropical fruits to Antarctic fish, everything grows somewhere in Peru. What makes Peruvian food distinctive—an escape from the Latin American syndrome of overdone beef with rice and beans—is not only Spanish culinary traditions but also, importantly, Asia. In a wave of migration that mirrored the same events in California, hundreds of thousands of Japanese settled in the country beginning in the 1800s, farming and building railroads. Even more Chinese followed, working the sugarcane plantations and coastal farmlands. They brought cultural expectations with them: technical precision, quick cooking, familiar ingredients stir-fried with the new. The country's venerable dish, lomo saltado, is just a stir-fry of beef and peppers, with soy sauce the mystery ingredient. You get a Peruvian fillip by having it montado, with a fried egg. About five percent of Peruvians are of Asian background, including the former president, Alberto Fujimori (he was born in Lima). My bespectacled dining companion, Mr. Julio Villanueva Chang, is a mashup in this style: a globalized Hispanic Asian, known in Peru by his Spanish name and in the United States by his Chinese one. There have been various attempts to name the style of cooking emerging in a newly enriched Peru. Acurio has called it Novoandino, or "New Andean"—a term he himself finds too limiting, with its emphasis on the mountains and the implication of a stolid potato behind everything. In a blast of rapid-fire Spanish delivered between speaking engagements, he told me, "It's five hundred years of fusion in a world where fusion is fashionable." In Arequipa, the southern city that claims to be Peru's gourmet capital, they call it Alpandino, to reflect Peru's meeting of European techniques and farmhouse ingredients. Whatever the label, it started with seviche—raw, from the beach—and passed through imperial Spain. It picked up the Andean larder and Asian technique, and has finished it off with a tiny glass of mind-blowing pisco, a velvet slap. Calling your food Novopacifico, or EurAsiAndean, is silly. Peruvian will just have to do. Acurio proved a hyperkinetic philosopher of fish, an ambassador of Peru's great ideas. He used words like emancipating and democratic to describe meals. In a country divided by income, race, ethnicity, language, and culture, he noted, "food is the point in common. The kitchen is where we are all represented. We've changed from a country that exports raw materials to one that exports culture, food, and history." Acurio opened restaurants around the world—one, then three, then seven kitchens—then spin-off chains, then a global brand of packaged Peruvian sauces. But he is not merely a kitchen-whites celebrity. In Peru he is seen as a heroic businessman, an entrepreneur who is rebranding the entire country with a cleaver. His father was a canny politician; many assume the chef/empire builder has a future in office. Acurio claims that Lima, his base, now has more cooking schools than any other city on earth, and twenty thousand young people are training to be chefs. Youth on a mission, they see their future in expanding Peruvian culture, tourism, and food. Mario Vargas Llosa, who won the 2010 Nobel Prize in literature, wrote recently, "It is largely Gastón Acurio's fault that today young Peruvians of both sexes dream of being chefs." "This is much more important than just eating," Acurio cautioned me, lowering his voice for effect. Peruvian chefs are revered like soldiers, he emphasized. "Cuisine is the motor for rebuilding our identity, our independence. It's a very important moment for us." I think I can help. I've seen the old Peru, and I like the new one better. Nothing makes a country stand up faster than respect, so I embarked on paying my most serious respects to Peruvian food. I headed from the very bottom of the food ladder (raw fish on the northern coast) to the very top (the haute-altitude cuisine of Arequipa, 7,700 feet high in the south). In the process, I found how a country can reinvent itself with a cuisine no one can even name. "Every civilization has to have a food source,"  Sandra Gamio, the Peruvian food expert, told me. "In Egypt it was the Nile. For us, it was the sea." Peru is a land of old things, and the Humboldt Current is the oldest of them all. It is simply a deep conveyor belt of very cold water from the Antarctic, which hugs the side of Chile and finally delivers a rich pulse of plankton to the surface, just miles from Peru's shore. Small fish eat plankton. Big fish eat small fish. And humans eat big fish. South America's first known civilizations rose in the improbably brutal desert of northern Peru, where the ancient Moche and other pyramid-building people lived off the sea. They fished the Humboldt Current from kayaks made of totora reed, and I was headed to a place up north where the same slim vessels are still in use two millennia later. That was Máncora, a town of booming beach resorts and productive fishermen, one touchstone in Peru's national rituals of eating well. Máncora is Peru's surfing capital, not far from the Ecuadorian border, where a string of sweet hotels look out on the rolling waves. When the damp garúa mist drives people in Lima crazy, they go north, where the skies over the beaches are perpetually clear. Couples plodded by on rented horses. Surfers ditched junky waves, ruined by an offshore wind. At the DCO Suites hotel (pronounced deseo), in near solitude, I read books; swam in the sea or the pool or both; ate fish; read books. Swim, eat, and read. Repeat chorus. The sun, the wide stretch of sand, the ease of doing nothing were all seductive. This was the uncomplicated life people dream about. But I wasn't here for my suntan. On both the second and third days, I practiced tae kwon do in the sand and then walked a mile up the beach to where the local fishing fleet was anchored. It wasn't made of reed kayaks, but there was an armada of fifty brave little diesel fishing boats, some with small sails. They went out at night, bouncing along within sight of shore, and at dawn disgorged what the depths of the Humboldt had served up. Mostly it was corvina, big silver arrows, but there was more than I could fathom. The catch was gutted, laid on ice, and soon roaring south in a truck. About eighteen hours after landing, the fish were in Lima, still pearlescent. I wasn't far behind.  After my return to Lima, my phone rang at an unconscionable 4:35 a.m., and I pulled on some clothes and stumbled downstairs to meet a taxi bearing Diego Oka. Another fusion Peruvian, he is Gastón Acurio's protégé, the twentyeight- year-old executive chef of La Mar, the most closely watched cevichería, or seafood restaurant, in a country that is bewitched by seafood. It was 4:48 by the time we met. A seafood chef gets to market early. Lima was still sleeping, a blanket of garúadulling the arc lights on the hillsides as we rolled out of swanky-suburban Miraflores, past the colonial center, and into Villa María del Triunfo, one of those brave workaday places that outsiders call slums and hundreds of thousands call home. Lima's biggest and best fish market is here, and so this slum has the only 5a.m. traffic jam in the country. We finally abandoned the taxi and walked between the tightly packed vehicles, finding the market by the sound of a man sharpening knives. Inside was a Thunderdome of fish, a stadium dedicated to the god Humboldt, with long ranks of vendors divided by specialty, and clean, modern processing sheds. The chaos was total but tightly orchestrated. Restaurant buyers—typically bowler-hatted cholas, the market women of Peruvian society, cooking for their own huariques—mingled, appraised, argued, and pleaded with hundreds of fishmongers freshly supplied from Máncora and a dozen other ports on the coast, most in the north but some as far south as Chile. Teams of men in blue vests pushed carts heaped with strange sea creatures through the dense crowds, whistling loudly and crying out, "¡Permiso!" or "¡Dale, dale!" (meaning "Make way!"). Amid the cacophony were voices shouting "Sail!" and "Sword!" to advertise their wares. There were trucks carrying things I had to stare at for a long time, unable to accept their Hemingwayesque proportions: swordfish the size of missiles, their tails as big as the men handling them! But much of what appeared was novel to me. Oka, a Japanese-Peruvian, explained that the cold Humboldt actually mixes with warm tropical currents off Peru. "Cold and warm," he emphasized. "There is a big diversity of fish." Much of the market goes to very ordinary chefs with local joints where everything depends on reliability over time. I watched one woman handle, reject, bargain over, and finally buy a massive cojinova that would feed twenty if not thirty. She spent ten minutes on each side of the fish. A whistle blast woke me out my happy stupor. "¡Dale, dale!" shouted a runner in a blue vest, nearly mowing me down with a hand truck full of urchins. Peru was in a hurry, and it was starting to get light out. After a snooze,  I was back on the streets before lunch. I took a taxi to meet a cooking class at the Surquillo Market #1, an airy, even cavernous food hall that was more tipico than deluxe. The goods on display were a symphony of what makes Peruvian cuisine surprising, exotic, novel, and balanced. My host was chef Carlos Otero, the author of cookbooks for Peru's biggest supermarket chain, whom I found fondling the produce and passing it around to a small group of students. I learned to distinguish, at least briefly, the taste of lúcuma, a huge, dry cousin of the passion fruit. Ground into flour, it imparts a nutty, sweet flavor to drinks. We handled juicy chirimoyas and "island bananas," a delicate, fragrant pink plantain. Stall after stall, amid spices and potatoes in twelve shades, the names and colors became dizzying; there was aguaymanto and then camu camu ("Highest vitamin content in the world!" boasted chef Carlos). A moment later, all memory of camu camu was obliterated by a dozen new shapes (spiky!) and colors (black potatoes?). We munched a Peruvian obsession—salty corn kernels the size of horse's teeth (too dry for me). The fish selection was nice, but I was jetlagged and jaded after Máncora and the seafood city of the slums. Armed with a handful of purchases—ají verde peppers and some limes and cilantro— four of us jammed into a small taxi and headed back to Otero's apartment, crawling through the thick traffic that Limeños, as the city residents are called, constantly curse. Carlos had a teaching kitchen on his roof. Despite the moist garúa, it barely ever rains in Lima, and we were safe up top with a cool breeze. Otero, who owned restaurants in Lima and Florida before cooking on Peruvian television, was a genial, bilingual guide to the sights and smells that had been seducing me for days. Our first step was a trip to pisco-sour land. Peru's signature alcohol is distilled, like brandy, from grapes, with fragrant variants like Italia, served straight, and Quebranta and blended Acholado, mixed in cocktails like dry rum. We threw pisco, sugar syrup, and lime juice into a blender (the ratio is 3:1:1 "if you are American," Carlos noted, meaning a Peruvian would use more sugar). Then we added and reduced six ice cubes (exactly) to rubble. Then the whirring blades were fed the white of one egg. The blender flashed up a snowy froth:Dale, dale, a pisco sour. In the glass, only one or two drops of brown bitters marred the white spume. With a cool breeze blowing off the ocean and a drink in my hand, I was ready to play sous-chef. To make seviche, we diced thick fillets of corvina from the morning market in Villa María del Triunfo. We added ice cubes to firm up the flesh, and then intense Peruvian lime juice, from citrus aurantifolia, a cousin to a Key lime and twice as acidic as a common American lime. It has always been said that long hours of marination in the lime juice "cooks" seviche, keeping it safe, but Otero told us not to bother. Like everyone, the Peruvians are now accustomed to the raw fish in sushi. Today, they marinate seviche in lime juice just for flavor, only ten or fifteen minutes. We plucked out the ice and added some kick: finely diced mild red onions and a wee bit of green limo peppers. We finished with a grind of black pepper, to sweep the airspace in advance of the first bite. With the lime juice working ("Non-reactive bowl!" Carlos coached), we tackled two dishes that display the humble ambitions of Peruvian food. The key to both is theají verde, or ají amarillo—a pepper that is actually yellow or orange, not green. Medium in size, ají verde gets into a lot of Peru's original dishes, often roasted or boiled three times to remove much of the heat. For papas a la Huancaína, we sauced boiled potatoes with a blender puree of these peppers, plus garlic and vegetable oil ("Olive oil will ruin it"). In went hard white farmer's cheese, the protein of poor people who cannot wait for aging. A few soda crackers thickened the sauce. Served over fried potatoes, with olives and hard-boiled eggs, it was simple, gorgeous, great—a new variation on that globe-beating favorite, spuds with cheese. How can Gastón Acurio fail? The second dish was mahimahi sautéed in pisco and topped with another ají verde sauce heavy on the red onion and cilantro. The result on the table was Peru in buffet form: There cannot be a more colorful cuisine in the world. Brilliant orange peppers; deep-green herbs and lime; fiery dots of limo, black olives, and yellow hard-boiled eggs; golden potatoes; fish whitened by juice or browned by the pan. Peru itself is wildly colorful, a swirling empire that stretches from the dry coast over the giga-peaks of the Andes. I once rode a motorcycle from sea-level Lima to 15,400 feet in the mountains, and it took less than three hours. This country extends deep into the jungles of the Amazon and is larger than France, with dozens of languages—a kaleidoscope of ethnicities, people, terrain, and costumes. But any Peruvian will tell you that food is especially important in a poor place. It is a baseline, an essential venue for solidarity and family support. It is also, sometimes, in hard times, the only forum for celebration and cultural sustenance. As soon as I was done cooking the fish, I felt an immense responsibility lifting off me. Once you know how to make it, once you own all this variety, all this authenticity, the multicultural glories, you can stop thinking and just enjoy. All I had to do now was eat. Last stop: Arequipa.  It is the garden of Peru, a dignified second city with lofty ambitions and a 7,700-foot altitude to match. It should have been the capital of Peru, as most of the people there will tell you: Unlike stony, desiccated Lima, sprawling everywhere but into the ocean, Arequipa is a white city (much of the historic center is made from light volcanic rock) with a cool climate, a long green growing season, and a wraparound skyline of volcanoes peaked with snow. Even people in Lima concede that this is the best of Peru. Lima has clouds; Arequipa has high-pressure sunshine. Lima has slums; Arequipa has a patchwork of green farms, some of the richest soil in the country when irrigated by snowmelt. Lima has the gloomy history of the viceroy; Arequipa has Vargas Llosa, the wise comedian. In the old days, this was almost the only place where Peru felt ambitious: Unstained by terrorism and unshaped by tourism, it was always a self-satisfied scene for great eating and drinking, for the socialism of an aspiring middle class. Like Vargas Llosa's most famous creation, the unstoppable scriptwriter, they took themselves completely seriously. "How do you like Arequipa?" a restaurant owner asked, as I perused his menu. I could barely wheeze out an answer (affirmative) in the thin air before he said, "Of course you do. This is the greatest city in the world." Then I might as well have the best. Arequipa isn't far from Cuzco or Lake Titicaca, but it gets barely the froth of Peru's tourism cream. One of the best hotels in the city—the historic Posada del Inca, on the central plaza—was half empty, and after a round of negotiating, feigned indifference, and feints toward the door, I secured a top-floor room for seventy-five dollars. From there, I stepped across the cobblestones of Calle San Francisco straight into the palm-lined plaza. Arequipa has the authenticity of Cuzco without the crowds, as well as the requisite cathedral of ancient vintage (1622, actually), and it is surrounded by some of the strongest (and poorest) indigenous communities in Peru. In this glorious park, where children play, newlyweds pose, and bands blast, muddy-footed peasants from a variety of linguistic groups are always wandering in from villages to sell or buy. The clattering of a manual typewriter—rare sound!—drew my attention to a peasant in wool and sandals who stood, slowly dictating to a man on a bench. The man was one of the last professionals in a centuries-old tradition, a scribe paid by the page to write letters and fill out forms for the illiterate. The old Peru isn't exactly dying—in this region of the south, indigenous life carries on in the country, clusters of villages around the deep and dramatic Río Colca Valley—but Peru's rising fortunes are taking a toll on the typists. When this fellow was done tapping out a government petition for his client, he told me, caressing his light, portable typewriter, "Since the population learned to write, we don't have as much work." Here was the usual one-sided contest between progress and the picturesque. The last two scribes in the plaza, archrivals, sat on opposite benches, typewriters balanced on their laps, stacks of extra-long white paper arrayed at their sides. The slow-moving Peruvian bureaucracy still expects formal correspondence, contracts and petitions with all the right phrasing, and legalese wherever possible. What is a lawsuit without some obfuscatory language and ornate posturing? The scribes are cheaper than lawyers, and the sound of their mechanized, clicking machines almost put me to sleep in the sunshine. I must have dreamed out there, for I remember a great procession of men in sixteenth-century armor, and indigenous dancers, and smoking censers—oh wait, that was the noon Mass—and then I fell deep into a memory hole. I recovered the story of my brief visit to Arequipa on my motorcycle in 1996. I arrived at dawn, ate the marzipan candies made by cloistered nuns at the convent of Santa Catalina (its own little city), and then rolled on at dusk, northward. Before the daylight expired, I came to a cemetery on the highway. At the sight of a thumping brass band, I killed the engine and coasted into a spot among scores of parked cars and trucks. It was the Day of the Dead. Crowds of giddy "mourners" were piling through the cemetery gates, setting up picnics on bone-colored crypts, dusting the graves, setting out flowers. Men climbed ladders up a three-story mausoleum, cleaning and honoring their ancestors. And, Peruvian style, everyone was eating. Salty giant corn kernels, like pre-Columbian Doritos; humitas, the sweet-corn tamales; hampers of spicy broiled chicken; a Tupperware abundance of potato dishes, with a then-mysterious sauce the color of the sun, the Huancaína I'd recently learned to make in Lima. Even here, among the poor in a desert, people were eating seviche made from whatever they liked—cockles, mussels, shrimp, squid, octopus, fish of many types, all dressed with lime and exploding with the usual gaudy colors: green lettuce, snow-white fish, red onion, yellow corn, pink shrimp, orange cubes of yam. Eat, pray, and do a little dusting. Even the dead eat well in Peru. Some were offered a sample of a favorite dish—chicken wings, say. Others got a few drops of pisco, and the best pisco comes from right around here, in this dusty region between Arequipa and the town of Pisco itself. I alone did not eat. People offered me anticuchos, the grilled strips of beef heart. But I remember saying no. I'd never eaten a heart before and was scared. It was a cemetery. I was an outsider at this life-affirming feast in a graveyard. Bad call. Later, in Lima, I ate the anticuchos. In strips, smoky from the grill, they were tender and rich, a vampire thrill. So good that I have always regretted that first missed chance in the cemetery. I've learned: Eat like a Peruvian, straight to the heart. More from  Condé Nast Traveler :
