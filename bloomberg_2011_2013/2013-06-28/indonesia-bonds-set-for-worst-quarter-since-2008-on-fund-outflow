Indonesia ’s bonds are set for the
worst quarter since 2008 after foreign investors cut holdings of
the nation’s debt on concern inflation will accelerate and the
 Federal Reserve  will pare its stimulus.  Global funds reduced the proportion of local-currency
 government bonds  they hold to 32.1 percent as of June 25, from a
peak of 34.6 percent on May 16, finance ministry data show. The
nation raised subsidized-fuel prices last week for the first
time since 2008, which may quicken inflation to 7.2 percent this
year from the government’s previous estimate of 4.9 percent.  The yield on the 5.625 percent notes due May 2023 surged
1.61 percentage points this quarter, the biggest increase since
the three months ended June 2008, to 7.17 percent as of 10:05
a.m. in Jakarta, prices from the Inter Dealer Market Association
show. It rose 1.19 percentage points this month and fell two
basis points, or 0.02 percentage point, today.  “The era of yields of below 6 percent is probably over as
it wouldn’t reflect the inflation picture,” said  Gundy Cahyadi ,
an economist at Oversea-Chinese Banking Corp. in  Singapore .
“The upside for yields is limited while there is more room for
downside as panic over the Fed’s tapering eases and investors
reconsider the fundamentals.”  Bank Indonesia  has bought more than 9 trillion rupiah ($905
million) of government bonds from the secondary market this
month and is prepared to reenter the market to stabilize prices
if necessary, Filianingsih Hendarta, executive director of
monetary management, said yesterday.  The rupiah declined 2.2 percent in the past three months,
the most since the quarter ended June 2012, to 9,928 per dollar,
prices from local banks compiled by Bloomberg show. It traded at
a 2.5 percent premium to its one-month non-deliverable forwards,
which fell 4 percent to 10,183, the biggest drop since the three
months ended September 2011, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  One-month implied volatility in the rupiah, a measure of
expected moves in the  exchange rate  used to price options,
climbed 8.38 percentage points this quarter to 14.11 percent,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
