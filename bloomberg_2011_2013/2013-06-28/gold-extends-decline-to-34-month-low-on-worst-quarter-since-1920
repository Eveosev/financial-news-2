The spot price of gold rebounded
from a 34-month low, jumping the most in a month, on signs of
increased demand for jewelry, coins and bars after the metal
headed for the biggest quarterly drop in at least 93 years.  “We did see physical buying come in a bit, and if that
continues it will provide some support,” Marc Ground, a
commodity strategist at Standard Bank Plc in Johannesburg, said
in a telephone interview. Bullion for immediate delivery in
 London  slid 23 percent this quarter, poised for the largest
decline since 1920, when Bloomberg data starts. Standard
Chartered Plc advised buying gold around $1,200 an ounce.  “There is definitely some increase in the pace of physical
purchases,” Matt Zeman, a strategist at Kingsview Financial in
 Chicago , said in a telephone interview. “We are also seeing
some short covering after prices started rising.”  Gold for immediate delivery advanced 2.2 percent to
$1,227.05 at 3:06 p.m.  New York  time, heading for the biggest
gain since May 20. Earlier, the price touched $1,180.50, the
lowest since August 2010.  On the Comex in New York, gold futures for August delivery
rose 1 percent to settle at $1,223.70. Trading was 66 percent
above the average in the past 100 days for this time, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg.  China should buy gold to back the internationalization of
its currency, Sun Zhaoxue, president of China National Gold
Group Corp., said at a forum in  Shanghai  today. Sales were about
800 metric tons in the first half of the year, nearing last
year’s total, Sun said.  Annual Slump  Bullion slid 27 percent this year, set for the biggest
annual drop since 1981, after rallying in each of the past 12
years. About $61 billion was wiped from the  value  of exchange-traded products backed by gold this year as some investors lost
faith in them as a store of value and a lack of accelerating
inflation.  Spot silver jumped 5.5 percent to $19.5093 an ounce, while
prices in New York settled at $19.47, up 4.9 percent. Today’s
jump narrowed the precious metal’s annual drop to 36 percent,
which is the biggest slide among 24 commodities tracked by the
Standard & Poor’s GSCI Spot Index.  On the  New York Mercantile Exchange , platinum futures for
October delivery rose 0.8 percent to $1,339.90 an ounce. The
metal dropped 8.3 percent this month, making it the biggest
decline since May 2012. Palladium futures for September delivery
advanced 1.5 percent to $660.70 an ounce, paring this month’s
slump to 12 percent. For the quarter, prices are down 14
percent, the biggest drop since September 2011.  To contact the reporter on this story:
