Rebekah Brooks,  Andy Coulson  and
three other former employees at  News Corp. (NWSA) ’s U.K. newspapers
lost a bid to have a U.K. appeals court throw out phone-hacking
charges.  The defendants, who are being prosecuted over allegations
they intercepted cell phone voicemails while working for the
News of the World tabloid, argued saved messages weren’t covered
by laws protecting private communications. Brooks and Coulson
pleaded not guilty to the charges earlier this month.  The rules apply even if a “voicemail message has already
been received and read by the intended recipient,” Judge Igor Judge said in a written decision rejecting their appeal.  Lawyers for Brooks, the former chief executive officer of
New Corp.’s U.K. unit, and Coulson, the former editor of the
News of the World and media adviser to Prime Minister  David Cameron , didn’t immediately respond to e-mails seeking comment.  The other defendants who sought to block the prosecution
were Stuart Kuttner, the tabloid’s former managing editor,
former news editor Ian Edmondson and former reporter James
Weatherup, who have all pleaded not guilty.  To contact the reporter on this story:
