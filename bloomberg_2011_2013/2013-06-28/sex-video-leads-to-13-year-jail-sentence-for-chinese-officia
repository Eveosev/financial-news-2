A Chinese Communist Party official
who rose to notoriety after a video of him having sex circulated
on the Internet was sentenced to 13 years in jail for taking
bribes, the official Xinhua News Agency reported.  Lei Zhengfu, the former party secretary for a district in
southwestern  China ’s Chongqing municipality, was also fined
300,000  yuan  ($48,800) today, Xinhua reported, citing a local
court official it didn’t identify. Xinhua gave no further
details about the bribes and said Lei was deciding whether to
appeal the sentence.  Lei, 55, was fired from his post in November after he was
identified as the man in a sex video that was circulated on
Chinese social media sites. Six people in Chongqing were charged
with blackmail last month for extorting officials, including
Lei, by filming their sexual encounters, the People’s Daily
reported May 22.  He is one of several officials who have been disgraced by
revelations about their behavior posted on the Internet. Liu
Tienan, the former head of China’s National Energy
Administration, was fired last month for “suspected severe
violations of discipline” after a reporter posted allegations
that Liu had improper financial dealings.  When President Xi Jinping took over as general secretary of
the party in November, he warned that a failure to contain
corruption could lead it to lose power.  In a May 14 article,
Xinhua said Liu’s downfall “suggested the ruling party welcomes
netizens to join the anti-corruption campaign in a rational,
legal way.”  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
