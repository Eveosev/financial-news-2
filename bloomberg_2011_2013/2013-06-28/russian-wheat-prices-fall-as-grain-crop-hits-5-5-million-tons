Russia’s fourth-grade milling wheat
prices fell 16 percent this week, the biggest drop of 2013, as
farmers harvest the new crop more quickly than they did in the
year-earlier period.  Fourth-grade milling wheat, the main export commodity among
Russian cereals, fell to 7,625 rubles ($232), according to data
on the website of  SovEcon , a Moscow-based researcher that
monitors average weekly prices in the European part of the
country.  Farmers harvested 5.5 million metric tons of grain and
legumes in the year-to-date, which is 1.9 million tons more than
the year-earlier period, the  Agriculture Ministry  said today on
its website. Yields reached 3.81 tons a hectare (2.47 acres)
compared with 2.76 tons a hectare a year earlier, according to
the data.  About 3.9 million tons of wheat was harvested, up from 1.8
million tons a year earlier, the ministry said. The barley
harvest reached 1.3 million tons, compared with 340,900 tons.  “Average prices will decline even more when the old crop
is finished,” Andrei Sizov Jr., SovEcon’s managing director,
said by phone.  To contact the reporter on this story:
