Spain ’s Cabinet approved a higher
spending limit for 2014 and tax changes to boost revenue as its
seeks to curb the widest European Union  budget deficit  without
jeopardizing an exit from a sixth year of economic slump.  The spending limit for 2014 will be 133.3 billion euros
($174 billion), 2.7 percent higher than a year earlier, Budget
Minister Cristobal Montoro told reporters in Madrid today.
Stripping out the contributions to the state-funded pensions
system and unemployment benefits, the spending ceiling would
have fallen 1.3 percent from 2013, he said.  European Union finance ministers this month  granted  Spain
two more years, until 2016, to tackle its  budget deficit  after
it received EU loans to bail out its banking sector last year.
Prime Minister  Mariano Rajoy  is counting on  exports  to lead a
recovery this year after the fourth-largest economy in the euro
region has  contracted  seven straight quarters.  The EU has set Spain’s deficit target for 2013 at 6.5
percent of gross domestic product after overspending reached
10.6 percent last year. That is more than three times the EU
limit of 3 percent of GDP.  Spain will raise taxes on tobacco and alcohol and will also
impose a levy on air-conditioning gases, Montoro said, adding
the impact of the steps announced today would be revenue this
year of about 1 billion euros. Spain will also remove some
corporate  tax deductions , he said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
