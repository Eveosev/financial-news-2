The baht was set for its worst
quarter since 2000 as overseas investors cut holdings of Thai
bonds and stocks on the prospect of the  Federal Reserve  phasing
out stimulus that fueled demand for emerging-market assets.  The yield on 10-year  government bonds  increased in June by
the most since March 2012 as global funds pulled $2.6 billion
from Thai debt and equities, official data show. Fed Chairman
 Ben S. Bernanke  said last week that bond-buying, known as
quantitative easing, could be reduced this year and ended in
2014. The  finance ministry  cut its 2013 growth forecast
yesterday to 4 percent to 5 percent, compared with a previous
range of 4.8 percent to 5.8 percent, amid concern the economy of
China, Thailand’s largest export market, is slowing.  “With concern about the Fed’s reduction in quantitative
easing, fund outflows accelerated and that weighed on the
baht,” said  Hideki Hayashi , a researcher at the Japan Center
for Economic Research in Tokyo. “Concern about  China’s economy 
is also growing and that’s also negative for the baht.”  The baht slumped 6.1 percent this quarter, the most since
the three months through September 2000, to 31.17 per dollar as
of 9:11 a.m. in Bangkok, data compiled by Bloomberg show. The
currency, which dropped 2.7 percent this month and 0.1 percent
today, touched 31.25 on June 21, the weakest level since Sept. 7.  One-month implied volatility, a measure of expected moves
in the  exchange rate  used to price options, climbed 273 basis
points, or 2.73 percentage points, this quarter to 7.95 percent.
It rose 139 basis points this month and 24 basis points today.  Exports Fall  Overseas sales dropped 5.3 percent in May from a year
earlier after increasing 2.9 percent the previous month,
official data showed this week. The Bank of  Thailand  may cut
this year’s export growth forecast from the current 7.5 percent,
Senior Director Mathee Supapongse said yesterday. Central bank
data on trade is due today.  The yield on the 3.625 percent bonds due June 2023 rose 27
basis points from the end of March to 3.8 percent, the largest
quarterly increase since the first three months of 2012,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The rate advanced 29
basis points this month and declined two basis points today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
