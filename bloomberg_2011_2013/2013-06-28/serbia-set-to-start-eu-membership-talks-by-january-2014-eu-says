Serbia  moved closer to starting
negotiations to join the European Union, showing the bloc’s
appeal as a force for economic advancement and democratic
progress in the Balkans.  European government leaders agreed to start entry talks by
January 2014. In a concession to Serbia, the leaders said the
start date may be set as soon as October instead of waiting
until the EU’s December summit. Talks will also get underway on
closer political and economic ties with  Kosovo , which broke away
from Serbia in 2008, EU leaders said today at a summit in
Brussels.  Serbia’s march to the EU is likely to take years.
Neighboring Croatia, which fought against Serbia as  Yugoslavia 
dissolved in the 1990s, becomes an EU member next week after
almost eight years of negotiations and ratifications.  While Serbia is not “overly happy” that the talks may not
start in October, the move toward the EU is still a historic
event, Serb Prime Minister  Ivica Dacic  said in Belgrade
yesterday.  To contact the reporters on this story:
