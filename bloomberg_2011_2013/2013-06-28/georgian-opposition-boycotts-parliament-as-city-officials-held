Georgian President Mikheil Saakashvili’s opposition United National Movement boycotted
parliament after 22 officials from the mayor’s office in the
Black Sea nation’s capital were detained.  “We don’t see any point in running the normal parliament
life while political retributions are under way,” Levan
Bezhashvili, a UNM lawmaker, told Rustavi 2 television today.  As many as 30 city hall officials were detained and freed
without accusation yesterday before 22 were arrested again on
embezzlement charges, according to a statement from the Finance
Ministry’s Investigation Department. Tbilisi’s UNM Mayor Gigi Ugulava called the detentions unlawful at a late-night news
conference.  Saakashvili’s party was unexpectedly defeated by
billionaire Bidzina Ivanishvili’s Georgian Dream in October
elections. The tycoon, now prime minister, has since faced
criticism from the European Union and U.S. after police arrested
former officials including ex-Premier Vano Merabishvili and ex-Interior and Defense Minister Bacho Akhalaia. Saakashvili steps
down in October.  To contact the reporter on this story:
