Progressive Corp (PGR) , the fourth-largest
U.S. auto insurer, agreed to license its usage-based pricing
technology to United Services Automobile Association.  USAA would pay 0.02 percent of its annual direct written
premiums on auto coverage, Mayfield Village, Ohio-based
Progressive said today in a statement. USAA, which provides
coverage to military members and their families, wrote more than
$8 billion in 2012 auto premiums, according to  data  from the
 National Association of Insurance Commissioners .  “We’re offering an appropriate means for companies to
lease our usage-based insurance,” Erin Hendrick, a Progressive
spokeswoman, said in an interview. “We believe the industry can
benefit from it.”  Progressive has patented a device that collects driving
data and calculates coverage based on a motorist’s habits. The
technology accounts for more than $1 billion in Progressive’s
premiums, the insurer said.  “This licensing agreement allows us to determine if a
comprehensive behavior-based insurance program will benefit our
membership,” Rebecca Hirsch, a spokeswoman for  San Antonio ,
Texas-based USAA, said in an e-mail.  USAA can begin using Progressive’s technology in April
2015, according to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
