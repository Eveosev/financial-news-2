Sinclair Broadcast Group Inc. (SBGI) 
shares rose 8.5 percent after the company agreed to buy  Fisher
Communications Inc. (FSCI) , continuing a TV-station acquisition spree
that’s designed to boost cash flow and capture key markets.  The shares climbed to $23.69 at the close in New York,
marking the second straight day of 6 percent-plus gains. Shares
of the  Hunt Valley , Maryland-based company, which operates local
TV stations, have climbed 87 percent this year.  The Fisher deal will bring 20 television stations to
Sinclair, raising its total to 134. The acquisition, which also
includes previous deals with Barrington Broadcasting Group LLC
and Cox Media Group, will let the company reach 33.7 percent of
U.S. television households, according to a statement today.  Sinclair is paying $41 a share in cash for Fisher in a deal
valued at about $373.3 million. That represents a 44 percent
premium over Fisher’s closing price on Jan. 9, before the
company announced it was pursuing strategic alternatives.  “Sinclair is the largest independent TV broadcaster in the
country, and we believe its commitment to the industry -- along
with its greater scale and sizable resources -- will provide our
stations, team members and business partners with new
opportunities to flourish,” Fisher Chief Executive Officer
Colleen Brown said in the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
