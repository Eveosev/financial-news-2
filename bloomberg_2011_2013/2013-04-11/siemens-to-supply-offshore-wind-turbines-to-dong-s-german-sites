Siemens AG (SIE)  agreed to supply 924
megawatts of  wind turbines  to Dong Energy A/S projects off
 Germany , signaling that obstacles to the industry’s expansion
are easing.  The agreement provides for the supply and servicing of 154
6-megawatt turbines at Dong’s Gode Wind projects, it said today
in an e-mailed statement, without disclosing terms. The order
will become unconditional once the Fredericia, Denmark-based
utility commits investment to proceed.  The accord may ease concern that Germany can’t meet wind-
output targets. Its offshore wind ambitions, at the heart of a
state program to triple the share of renewables in the power mix
by 2050, have faltered as debt-strapped utilities postpone
investments, grid connections stall and construction costs soar.  “With these agreements we are stepping up our commitment
to the German offshore wind market,” Samuel Leupold, executive
vice president of Dong’s wind-power unit, said in the statement.
The company plans to install 6,500 megawatts of offshore wind by
2020 compared with 1,700 megawatts now.  Dong bought the three North Sea-based Gode Wind parks from
German developer  PNE Wind AG (PNE3)  last year, and may install turbines
from 2015. The Danish company will also use Siemens’ 6-megawatt
machine at its Westermost Rough wind farm off northern  England .  Germany is targeting 10,000 megawatts of offshore wind
capacity by 2020, two years before its last nuclear plants shut
down. The government sees offshore wind at 25,000 megawatts by
2030 -- up from about 280 megawatts now -- as it implements a
550 billion-euro ($722 billion) plan to replace reactors.  To contact the reporter on this story:
