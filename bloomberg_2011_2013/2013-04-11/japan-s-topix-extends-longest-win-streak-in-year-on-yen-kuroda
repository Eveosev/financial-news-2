Japanese  shares  gained, with the
Topix Index posting its longest winning streak in more than a
year, after the yen neared 100 to the dollar and the  Bank of
Japan (8301)  pledged again to do what’s needed to reach an inflation
goal within two years.  Canon Inc. (7751) , the world’s biggest camera maker, gained 4.2
percent to its highest level in a year. Nomura Holdings Inc.,
Japan’s biggest brokerage, jumped 8.3 percent. Sharp Corp.,
which makes Aquos televisions, gained 7.9 percent after the
Nikkei newspaper reported second-half operating profit will beat
forecasts. Auto-parts supplier Takata Corp. tumbled 9 percent
after Japan’s three biggest automakers said it is recalling
vehicles because of airbags made by the safety equipment maker.  The Topix rose 2.3 percent to 1,147.29 at the close of
trading in Tokyo, its highest level since September 2008. The
measure today capped a 16 percent gain over seven days, its best
such performance since March 2009 and its longest winning streak
since January last year.  “The odds are clearly stacked in favor of a continued
rally in Japan,” said Mikio Kumada, Hong Kong-based global
strategist for LGT Capital Management, which oversees more than
$25 billion. The BOJ “has essentially scrapped existing rules
and programs, replacing them with straightforward and expanded
open-market purchases. This bold economic-policy shift has the
potential to sustain the rebound.”  The Nikkei 225 Stock Average rose 2 percent to 13,549.16,
with volume on the measure 55 percent above its 30-day average
at the close.  The  Topix (TPX)  surged 55 percent from mid-November through
yesterday as Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and central bank Governor
Haruhiko Kuroda pledged to defeat 15 years of deflation. The
gauge traded at 1.3 times  book value  compared with 2.4 for the
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index and 1.6 for the Stoxx Europe 600
Index, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Inflation Target  The Topix has risen every day since April 3, when the BOJ
began a meeting that ended with the announcement that the bank
will will double the monetary base by the end of 2014 by buying
government bonds, its boldest round of quantitative easing.
Kuroda said yesterday that the stimulus announced last week is
enough to achieve a 2 percent inflation goal.  The yen traded at 99.71 per dollar, near the 100 yen level
last seen in April 2009. The currency has dropped about 6.9
percent this month, the worst performance among 10 developed-
nation currencies tracked by Bloomberg Correlation Weighted
Indexes. A weaker yen boosts overseas earnings for Japanese
exporters when repatriated.  Actual Action  “Finally we have aggressive policy action -- not just
talk,” wrote UBS AG strategists led by Niall MacLeod in a
report yesterday. “For now, the impact is likely to keep the
yen on a downward path.”  Tire makers, brokerages and insurers led gains among the
Topix industry groups today, while sectors such as automakers
and consumer electronics exporters exerted the  biggest boost .  Canon, which gets nearly 80 percent of its revenue from
outside Japan, jumped 4.2 percent to 3,695 yen, its highest
level since April 2012.  Nomura (8604) , up 167 percent since Nov. 14,
jumped 8.3 percent to 760 yen, its highest level since January
2010. Dai-ichi Life Insurance Co., Japan’s No.3 insurer by
market value, rose 5.4 percent to 128,300 yen.  Sharp jumped 7.9 percent to 313 yen, with trading volume
about 39 percent higher than its 30-day average. Sharp’s
operating profit for the six months through March is about 20
billion yen, beating its 13.8 billion yen forecast, the Nikkei
reported, without citing anybody.  Technical Momentum  The Topix’s 14-day Relative Strength Index is now at 75.4,
after crossing above 70 yesterday, a threshold that some traders
view as a signal the gauge is overbought. The last time the
Topix’s RSI traded above 70 was on March 15. The gauge fell 2.2
percent the following trading day.                       The Topix Oil & Coal Index dropped the most among the Topix
industry groups today, its first decline in seven days. The
 Topix Warehousing and Harbor Transportation Services Index ,
which includes warehouse operator Mitsubishi Logistics Corp. and
port-harbor transport services company Kamigumi Co., fell the
second most, extending declines after reaching its highest since
2007 on April 8.  Among other stocks that fell, autoparts supplier  Takata (7312) ,
which makes safety equipment such as seatbelts and child seats,
tumbled 9 percent to 1,819 yen, paring a drop of as much as 15
percent. Japan’s biggest carmakers, Toyota Motor Corp., Honda
Motor Co. and Nissan Motor Co., said they are recalling almost 3
million cars worldwide because of defects in airbags made by
Takata.  The  Nikkei Stock Average Volatility Index (VNKY)  gained 1.5
percent to 28.86 today, indicating traders expect a swing of
about 8.3 percent on the benchmark gauge over the next 30 days.  To contact the reporters on this story:
