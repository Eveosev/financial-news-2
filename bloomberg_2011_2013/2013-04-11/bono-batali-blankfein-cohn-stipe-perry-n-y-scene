The New Museum gathered cult followers of Christian Marclay’s 24-hour film “The Clock” to Cipriani  Wall Street  last night.  “I’ve seen three hours at three different locations,” said James Keith Brown, an executive managing director at Och- Ziff Capital Management Group.  The film assembles footage of clocks and timepieces synched with real time.  “I am never late,” said Mitzi Eisenberg, one of the gala’s three chairmen and wife of Bed, Bath & Beyond Inc. co- founder Warren Eisenberg. “Sometimes I am disgustingly early.” She wore a black, diamond-studded Chopard watch.  Saul Dennison, the chairman of the New Museum’s board, checked his Vacheron Constantin timepiece while waiting for his daughter Lisa Dennison, chairman of  Sotheby’s (BID)  North and South America.  “I bought it for $100 in  China ,” he said. “The real thing is at home.”  Brown, the board’s newly elected president, displayed watch-free wrists. “I don’t wear one,” he said. “I use my BlackBerry or iPhone to check the time.”  Guests took the black-and-white dress code seriously including clothing designers Lisa Perry and  Tory Burch , and Jenna Lyons, president of J. Crew Group Inc., in diagonal- striped gypsy pants.  Nick Denton, founder of Gawker Media LLC, joined artists Marclay,  John Baldessari  and Alex Katz in forgoing a tie. J.  Michael Evans , vice chairman of  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) , broke ranks in a blue shirt with blue tie, though his wife, Lise, wore a short white dress.  Bono’s Beckett  Bono read from  Samuel Beckett ’s “The End” last night at a benefit for the Drawing Center, paying tribute to his friend, artist Sean Scully.  Then he found his own words. “I am lucky enough to live with some of Sean Scully’s work. They are of course very musical, very lyrical, but it’s their discipline I want to be around.”  Scully paints horizontal and vertical blocks of rich colors, “approaching the canvas like a kickboxer or a builder,” Bono said. “These grids with their frayed edges don’t intend to contain uncontainable emotions. What they do is suggest boundaries, limits. Limits are important for an artist, I’m told.”  “We’re both from Dublin, we kind of agree about things, about making the world better,” Scully said of his friendship with Bono.  Bridge Building  He said his paintings draw on many different cultures to “pollute the borders, to build a bridge.”  The artist, 67, has an exhibition at the Philadelphia Museum of Art through July 14. A survey of drawings from the 1970s will open at the Drawing Center on Sept. 26.  “What makes me happy is the amount of money raised tonight,” Scully said. “My friends really stepped up.”  The event at Tribeca Rooftop drew a record 400 guests including Eric Rudin, vice chairman and president of Rudin Management Co., chef and restaurateur  Mario Batali , Michael Stipe and  Paddy McKillen , who donated wines for the evening from his Chateau La Coste in southern  France .  Laura Blankfein has been helping Team Rubicon raise money for its disaster-response efforts.  Lisa Pevaroff-Cohn said she just returned from her alma mater, the Rhode Island School of Design, where she attended a lecture by Neil Kraft about life after RISD, part of a series she sponsors.  After Hours  The most voracious art lovers ended up at the Room Mate Grace Hotel in Times Square for the first “After Hours” event organized by the Times Square Alliance and the website  Hyperallergic .  Robin Cembalest, editor of ARTNews, hit the New Museum gala before finding a perch around a small swimming pool in the hotel watching video projections on the water’s surface by Marco Brambilla. The series will be monthly.  (Amanda Gordon and Katya Kazakina are writers for Muse, the arts and leisure section of  Bloomberg News . Any opinions expressed are their own.)
