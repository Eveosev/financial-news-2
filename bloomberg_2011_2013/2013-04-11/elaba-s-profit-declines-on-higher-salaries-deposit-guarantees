Helaba, the government-controlled
lender based in the German state of Hesse, posted a 20 percent
profit drop as it wrote down shipping loans and incurred costs
to integrate staff from businesses acquired from WestLB AG.  Net income fell to 318 million euros ($416 million) last
year, while expenses rose 19 percent to 1.2 billion euros, the
Frankfurt-based bank said in an e-mailed statement today.
Operating income rose 4 percent to a record 512 million euros.  “The integration of assets from WestLB increased staff and
administration costs from July 2012 onwards,” Chief Financial
Officer Detlef Hosemann said at a press conference in  Frankfurt .  The lender wrote down shipping assets by 60 million euros,
Hosemann said. Helaba, which unlike some rival Landesbanks was
not bailed out by the German government, took over a corporate
lending business with 415 employees and assets of 43 billion
euros from WestLB last year. WestLB was wound down after
incurring losses from the U.S. subprime mortgage crisis.  Helaba boosted its dividend to a record 11 percent of
earnings from 8 percent. The lender,  Germany ’s third-largest
Landesbank by assets, is owned by the states of Hesse and
Thuringia and a group of savings banks that are in turn owned by
the regions’ counties and municipalities.  The bank increased its core Tier 1 capital ratio, a measure
of financial strength, to 11.6 percent from 10.3 percent at the
end of 2011. Costs rose to 61.2 percent of income from 56.6
percent last year, compared with the 92.6 percent ratio posted
last year by  Deutsche Bank AG (DBK) , the nation’s largest lender.  To contact the reporter on this story:
