A federal jury in New York was sent
back for further deliberations to decide on damages to award
billionaire wine collector  William Koch  in his lawsuit over
counterfeit wines.  U.S. District Judge Paul Oetken in  Manhattan , after reading
a partially completed verdict submitted by the jury, told the
panel it needed to reach a verdict on monetary and compensatory
damages.  Billionaire wine collector William Koch, the founder of
Oxbow Carbon & Minerals LLC, sued Eric Greenberg in 2007,
alleging the consigner fraudulently misrepresented and
fraudulently concealed the true nature of 24 wines.  Koch said that he spent about $350,000 at the 2005 sale on
counterfeit wines, including fake bottles of 1928 Chateau
Petrus, 1921 Chateau Cheval Blanc and 1864 Chateau Latour.  The case is Koch v. Greenberg, 07-cv-9600, U.S. District
Court, Southern District of  New York  (Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
