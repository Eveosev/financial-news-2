Wholesale electricity on the
eastern U.S. grid operated by PJM Interconnection LLC slipped
for a second day as mild weather cut power demand.  Spot prices covering on-peak hours dropped 3.7 percent.
Power sales were below yesterday’s level, according to PJM, the
operator of the 13-state grid stretching from  New Jersey  into
North Carolina and Illinois. Commodity Weather Group LLC in
Bethesda, Maryland, predicted mostly normal or higher-than-
normal temperatures on the East Coast through April 26.  Electricity at PJM’s benchmark Western Hub, which includes
prices from Pennsylvania to Washington, fell $1.72 to $44.30 a
megawatt-hour at 3 p.m. from yesterday’s on-peak average,
according to the grid operator. On-peak hours run from 7 a.m. to
11 p.m.  The high today in Philadelphia may be 59 degrees Fahrenheit
(15 Celsius,) 4 below the usual reading, according to
 AccuWeather Inc.  in  State College , Pennsylvania.  PJM predicted peak  power usage  of 88,338 megawatts at 8:30
p.m. Consumption peaked at 94,140 megawatts yesterday.  New York City prices rose $18.64, or 41 percent, to $64.52
a megawatt-hour from yesterday’s on-peak average, according to
the  New York Independent System Operator Inc.   On-peak prices  on the six-state grid from  Connecticut  to
Maine advanced $9.10, or 24 percent, to $47.22 a megawatt-hour
