Eurocash SA, Poland’s biggest
distributor of non-durable  consumer goods , jumped after Erste
Group Bank AG recommended buying its shares, citing an improving
earnings outlook.  The  stock  advanced as much as 2.9 percent and traded 1.8
percent higher to 52 zloty as of 1:25 p.m. in Warsaw, heading
for the highest close in a week. Eurocash has gained 19 percent
 this year , compared with a 7.7 percent decline in the benchmark
WIG20 Index.  “We still see room for Eurocash to continue its growth in
the Polish fast-moving consumer goods market and see its
financial position as the strongest ever,” Marek Czachor, an
analyst at Erste in Warsaw, said in a research note today.  Eurocash will focus on paying off debt until 2015 while the
purchase of domestic distributor Tradis in 2011 should help
contribute to “strong double-digit growth” of earnings before
interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, or Ebitda,
Czachor said. Net income will probably surge to 354.1 million
zloty in 2013 from 250.4 million a year earlier.  After 2015, the strongest contribution to earnings growth
“should come from further acquisitions,” he said.  Eurocash is looking for takeover targets and plans to
increase its dividend after profits surged last year, Chief
Executive Officer Luis Amaral, who is also the company’s
controlling shareholder, said on March 13.  To contact the reporter on this story:
