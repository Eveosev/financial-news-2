Local retailers protested today  in
a tourist town in central Chinaâ€™s Hunan province against an
administration fee that they said will affect their business,
Xinhua News Agency reported.  The policy that came to effect yesterday requires tourists
to pay 148  yuan  ($24) to enter Fenghuang, previously free of
charge, the official news agency said, citing local store
owners. The retailers said that the policy will decrease the
number of tourists, cutting their sales, Xinhua reported.  Most of the stores that closed during the day reopened at
night after police dispersed the protesters, Xinhua reported.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
