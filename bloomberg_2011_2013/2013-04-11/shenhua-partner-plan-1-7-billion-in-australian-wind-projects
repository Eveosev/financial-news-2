Shenhua Group Corp.,  China ’s
biggest coal producer, and Hydro Tasmania could jointly invest
A$1.6 billion ($1.7 billion) by the end of the decade to build
Australian wind farms.  The Chinese company and Hydro Tasmania reached an agreement
to evaluate a further 700 megawatts of wind projects, expanding
their partnership on previous developments, the Australian
energy company said April 9. The two companies haven’t
identified any specific projects, Hobart-based Hydro Tasmania
said today in an e-mail.  Shenhua plans to increase spending in  Australia  to
contribute to the government’s program to get one fifth of its
electricity from renewable energy by 2020. Australia is forecast
to have A$15.5 billion of investment in new wind farms in that
period, according to Bloomberg New Energy Finance.  Hydro Tasmania  is studying a proposal to build a 600-
megawatt wind project on Tasmania’s King Island estimated to
cost A$2 billion. The Australian company completed a deal in
February to sell 75 percent of its Musselroe wind farm to
Shenhua unit Guohua Energy Investment Co. That follows a 2011
agreement to sell 75 percent of the Bluff Point and Studland Bay
wind farms in Tasmania to the Shenhua unit.  To contact the reporter on this story:
