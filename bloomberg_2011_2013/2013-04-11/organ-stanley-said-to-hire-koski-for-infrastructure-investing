Morgan Stanley (MS) , the sixth-largest
U.S. bank by assets, hired Chris Koski to work in its $4 billion
infrastructure-fund business, according to a person briefed on
the matter.  Koski will be a managing director and hasn’t started at the
firm, said the person, who asked not to be named because the
hire hasn’t been publicly announced. Koski was global head of
infrastructure at the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority, one of the
world’s biggest sovereign-wealth funds, until last year.  Morgan Stanley Infrastructure is run by co-head Markus
Hottenrott, Anne Valentine Andrews and Jim Wilmott. It is part
of the asset-management division’s merchant-banking segment,
which generated $272 million of revenue last year.  Koski resigned from the Abu Dhabi fund in July for personal
reasons and stayed on until late October to assist with the
recruitment of a replacement, ADIA said in November. He joined
the fund in 2007 from the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board.  Morgan Stanley’s infrastructure group in August bought the
portion of Southern Star Central Corp. it didn’t already own.
Southern Star operates a natural-gas pipeline that services
cities in the U.S. Midwest including  St. Louis .  Mark Lake, a spokesman for the New York-based bank,
declined to comment on the hire.  To contact the reporter on this story:
