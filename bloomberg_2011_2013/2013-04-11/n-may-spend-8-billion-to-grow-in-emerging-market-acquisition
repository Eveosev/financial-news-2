MTN Group Ltd. (MTN) , Africaâ€™s largest
mobile-phone operator, may spend as much as $8 billion on an
acquisition, building on an increase in spending on networks
last year that held back earnings.  The company is seeking targets in Africa, Southeast Asia
and the Middle East and will look at those that are worth at
least $4 billion, Johannesburg-based MTN said by e-mail today.  Capital spending  in 2012 rose 70 percent to 30.1 billion
rand ($3.37 billion) because of work upgrading technology to
handle more data traffic as consumers access the Internet from
mobile devices, MTN said last month. MTN is competing for a new
license in Myanmar to expand into south-east Asian markets,
Chief Executive Officer Sifiso Dabengwa said at the time.  Reuters reported on the acquisition strategy earlier today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
