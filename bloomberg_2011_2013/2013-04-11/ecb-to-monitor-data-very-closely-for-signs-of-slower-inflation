The  European Central Bank  said it
will look for signs in economic data that inflation could slow
more than it currently anticipates.  “In the coming weeks, the Governing Council will monitor
very closely all incoming information on economic and monetary
developments and assess any impact on the outlook for  price
stability ,” the ECB said in its monthly bulletin today, echoing
President  Mario Draghi ’s April 4 policy statement. “The
monetary policy stance will remain accommodative for as long as
needed.”  Draghi said last week that officials are currently
“looking at various instruments” to support an economic
recovery, including interest-rate cuts and non-standard
measures, such as a program to encourage lending to small- and
medium-sized companies.  Inflation risks remain broadly balanced, the ECB reiterated
in today’s bulletin. The central bank aims to keep inflation
just below 2 percent. It slowed to 1.7 percent in March.  The ECB last month cut its growth and inflation forecasts
and now expects the 17-nation economy to shrink 0.5 percent this
year before growing 1 percent in 2014. Inflation will slow to
1.3 percent next year from 1.6 percent this year, according to
the forecasts.  To contact the reporter on this story:
