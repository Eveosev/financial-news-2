U.S. 10-year notes rose for the
first time in four days as the world’s largest economy shows
signs of slowing amid speculation  Bank of Japan (8301)  stimulus
measures would drive investors into Treasuries, boosting demand
for  U.S. government debt .  The benchmark  yields  fell ahead of a report tomorrow
forecast to show U.S.  retail sales  stagnated in March after
gaining 1.1 percent in February. Yields briefly rose after the
U.S. sale of $13 billion in 30-year bonds produced a lower-than-
forecast yield and as stocks touched new highs. Economists are
cutting their forecasts for how much Treasury 10-year yields
will rise this year. The economy is forecast to grow by 2
percent in 2013, down from 2.2 percent last year.  “Global central banks are really driving the push for
safety,” said Larry Milstein, managing director in New York of
government-debt trading at R.W. Pressprich & Co. “The economic
numbers have slowed down, the Fed is still buying aggressively
and the prospect that Japanese easing may also push flows into
Treasuries means more money flowing into Treasuries.”  Benchmark 10-year yields fell one basis point, or 0.01
percentage point, to 1.79 percent at 5 p.m. New York time, based
on Bloomberg Bond Trader prices. The 2 percent note due February
2023 rose 3/32, or 94 cents per $1,000 face amount, to 101
27/32. Current 30-year bond yields fell one basis point to 3
percent.  Ten-year yields will be 2.25 percent by Dec. 31, according
to banks and securities companies surveyed by  Bloomberg News ,
down from 2.32 percent projected in February.  The Standard & Poor’s 500  Index (SPX)  rose a fourth day, gaining
0.4 percent to 1,593.37 after touching a record 1,597.35.  Bond Auction  The 30-year bonds sold today drew a yield of 2.998 percent,
compared with a forecast of 3.001 percent in a Bloomberg News
survey of seven of the  Federal Reserve ’s primary dealers.  The  bid-to-cover  ratio, which gauges demand by comparing
total bids with the amount of securities offered, was 2.49,
versus a 2.59 average for the previous 10 sales.  Indirect bidders , an investor class that includes foreign
central banks, purchased 31.4 percent of the notes, the lowest
since October, compared with an average of 36.7 percent for the
past 10 sales.  Direct bidders , non-primary-dealer investors that place
their bids directly with the Treasury, purchased 19.2 percent of
the notes, the highest level since December, compared with a
more than three-year low of 4.9 percent in March and an average
of 14.7 percent at the last 10 auctions.  BOC Easing  “There was no real concession,” said  Thomas Roth , senior
Treasury trader in New York at Mitsubishi UFJ Securities USA
Inc. “You had this huge run-up last week on a weaker employment
number, but you also had all this buying predicated on more
foreign buying coming in because of the Bank of  Japan  and its
new quantitative-easing program. A lot of people front-runned
that.”  Treasury 10-year yields fell on April 4 after Bank of Japan
Governor Haruhiko Kuroda said the central bank would double its
asset purchases, to 7.5 trillion yen ($75.8 billion) of bonds a
month, in a bid to encourage inflation. Japan held $1.12
trillion of  U.S. debt , Treasury data through January shows.  The  Federal Open Market Committee , led by Chairman  Ben S.
Bernanke , is pressing on with $85 billion in monthly bond buying
until the labor-market outlook has “improved substantially.”
The Fed purchased $3.298 billion in Treasuries today maturing
between May 2020 and February 2023.  ‘Softening Trend’  Labor Department figures released in  Washington  showed
Jobless claims decreased by 42,000 to 346,000 in the week ended
April 6, from a revised 388,000. The median forecast of 49
economists surveyed by Bloomberg called for a drop to 360,000.  The plunge in  unemployment  benefits was credited to an
unwinding of a surge caused by the Easter holiday and spring
break at schools. A Labor Department official said no states
were estimated and there was nothing unusual in the data.  The Commerce Department will report retail figures
tomorrow, forecast to stagnate. Employment and manufacturing
grew less in March than economists forecast, government and
industry reports this month showed.  “Things have slowed down some -- it’s a little bit of an
underpinning in the market,” said Tom Tucci, managing director
and head of Treasury trading in  New York  at CIBC World Markets
Corp. In terms of retail sales, “people are anticipating a
weaker number. In general, it will continue the softening
trend.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
