China’s  yuan  fell from a 19-year
high as the central bank lowered its fixing, forcing the
currency to weaken to stay within a set trading range.  The People’s Bank of China cut the daily  reference rate  by
0.05 percent to 6.2578 per dollar, 1.02 percent below the spot
rate’s closing level yesterday. The yuan is allowed to trade 1
percent either side of the fixing. Foreign-exchange reserves
increased to $3.44 trillion as of the end of March, higher than
the $3.36 trillion median estimate in a Bloomberg News survey,
official data showed today.  “The weaker fixing is a breather for the yuan after it
posted a new high yesterday,” said Kenix Lai, a Hong Kong-based
foreign-exchange analyst at Bank of East  Asia  Ltd. “The
appreciation trend is still intact for the yuan as funds
continue to flow into Asia, including China, in a hunt for
higher-yielding assets.”  The yuan weakened 0.04 percent to close at 6.1963 per
dollar in Shanghai, prices from the China Foreign Exchange Trade
System show. The spot rate was at a 0.99 percent premium to
today’s fixing. The currency touched 6.1923 yesterday, the
strongest level since the government unified official and market
exchange rates at the end of 1993.  China reported an unexpected trade deficit of $880 million
in March, the first since February 2012, which may send a
powerful signal that a strong yuan can no longer be tolerated,
Australia & New Zealand Banking Group Ltd. economists Liu Li- Gang and Zhou Hao wrote in a research note yesterday.  Offshore Market  Yuan positions  at Chinese banks from the sale of foreign
exchange climbed 295 billion yuan ($48 billion) in February from
a month ago, the PBOC said yesterday. Total positions rose to
26.8 trillion yuan, the highest since Bloomberg began compiling
the data in February 2000.  China started direct trading between the yuan and
Australian dollar yesterday, making it the third major currency
to have transactions without going through the  U.S. dollar .
Trade amounted to A$250 million ($263 million) on the first day
today, Australian Prime Minister  Julia Gillard  said in an
interview.  Reserve Bank  of Australia Governor  Glenn Stevens  said the
yuan will eventually become the dominant currency in Asia.
Liberalization of China’s capital account will presumably
continue to occur but on a timetable decided by the Chinese
authorities, Stevens told a symposium in Sydney yesterday.  In Hong Kong’s offshore market, the Chinese currency
slipped 0.02 percent to 6.1878 per dollar, data compiled by
Bloomberg show. Twelve-month non-deliverable forwards fell 0.04
percent to 6.2632, trading at a 1.1 percent discount to the spot
rate in Shanghai.  One-month implied volatility in the onshore yuan, a measure
of expected moves in the  exchange rate  used to price options,
was steady at 1.42 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
