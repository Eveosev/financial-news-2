Australia’s dollar slid versus its
major peers after data showed the nation’s unemployment rate
climbed to a three-year high, fanning speculation the  Reserve
Bank  will lower borrowing costs to support growth.  The yield on Australia’s benchmark three-year note fell,
snapping a two-day gain. The New Zealand dollar touched 86 U.S.
cents for the first time in 1 1/2 years after reports showed the
nation’s manufacturing industry expanded last month and a gauge
of home prices advanced to a record.  “We’ll probably see weakness on the crosses for the next
couple of days, as the view on a recovery in the Australian
labor market remains challenged, and also the RBA retains its
easing bias,” said  Andrew Salter , a Sydney-based foreign-
exchange strategist at  Australia & New Zealand Banking Group
Ltd. (ANZ) , referring to Australia’s dollar against its peers.  The Australian dollar lost 0.2 percent to $1.0520 as of
4:57 p.m. in Sydney. The  New Zealand  dollar, known as the kiwi,
rose 0.2 percent to 85.91. The climb to 86 was the first time
for the currency since August 2011.  Australia’s three-year note yield fell two basis points, or
0.02 percentage point, to 2.81 percent. It slid to 2.75 percent
on April 8, a level unseen since March 5.  The nation’s  jobless rate  rose to 5.6 percent last month,
the highest since 2009, from 5.4 percent in February, the
statistics bureau said in Sydney today. The number of people
employed dropped by 36,100, compared with the 7,500 decline
estimated by economists in a Bloomberg News survey.  RBA Outlook  Swaps traders see a 61 percent chance that the  Reserve Bank
of Australia  will cut the benchmark rate from 3 percent by
October, according to data compiled by Bloomberg on overnight-
index swaps. The probability was 57 percent yesterday.  New Zealand’s Performance of Manufacturing Index was 53.4
in March, remaining above the 50 level which indicates expansion
for a sixth month, Bank of New Zealand and Business New Zealand
reported.  A gauge of the nation’s  home prices  rose 2.4 percent in
March from the prior month to an all-time high, the Real Estate
Institute of New Zealand  said  today.  “The current rate of house price inflation, if it
continues, is likely to be accompanied by higher  interest rates 
sooner, and higher exchange rates,” New Zealand Finance
Minister  Bill English  said in a speech in Wellington.  The kiwi’s trade-weighted currency  index  climbed to 79.11
today, the highest on record dating back to 1985, figures from
the nation’s central bank show.  The kiwi gained 0.4 percent to NZ$1.2249 per Australian
dollar after touching NZ$1.2230, the strongest since Feb. 20.  “Domestic conditions in New Zealand have been relatively
robust recently,” said  Thomas Averill , a managing director in
Sydney at Rochford Capital, a currency and interest-rate risk
management company. “We can see the Aussie-kiwi back down
towards NZ$1.21.”  Trading of the Australian dollar for China’s  yuan  totaled
A$250 million ($263 million) on the first day of direct
transactions between the two currencies yesterday, Australian
Prime Minister  Julia Gillard  said in an interview today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
