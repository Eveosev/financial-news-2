Palm oil gained on speculation that
inventories in  Malaysia , the world’s second-biggest producer,
may decline for a fourth month as demand rebounds.  The contract for June delivery advanced as much as 0.3
percent to 2,379 ringgit ($784) a metric ton on the Bursa
Malaysia Derivatives exchange, and ended the morning session at
2,377 ringgit in  Kuala Lumpur . Futures have lost 34 percent in
the past year.  Inventories shrank 11 percent to 2.17 million tons in March
from 2.44 million tons in February, the steepest monthly drop
since January 2011, the Malaysian Palm Oil Board said yesterday.
Stockpiles may fall to 2.01 million tons by the end of this
month, according to Sebastian Tobing, an analyst with UBS AG,
while Kenanga Investment Bank Bhd. predicts a drop to 1.98
million tons.  “Demand from the northern hemisphere should improve month-
on-month except for  China , which may slow down its purchase
after a strong pick-up last month,” Alan Lim Seong Chun, an
analyst at Kenanga, wrote in a report today. “We expect crude
 palm oil  prices to recover in the second quarter to 2,800
ringgit a ton as we expect a sustained decline in the inventory
level to 1.82 million tons by June.”  Output climbed 2.2 percent to 1.33 million tons in March,
while exports increased 10 percent to 1.54 million tons, the
board said yesterday. Shipments to China  jumped  77 percent to
418,059 tons in March from a month earlier, board data shows.  Exports from Malaysia climbed 3.5 percent to 456,440 tons
in the first 10 days of April from the same period in March,
Intertek said yesterday. Exports gained 5.4 percent to 462,276
tons, said Societe Generale de Surveillance.  Soybean oil  for July delivery lost 0.3 percent to 50.06
cents a pound on the Chicago Board of Trade. Soybeans for
delivery in May declined 0.6 percent to $13.8475 a bushel.  Refined palm oil for September delivery fell 1.3 percent to
6,310  yuan  ($1,018) a ton on the  Dalian Commodity Exchange .
