Italian borrowing costs dropped at
an auction of 7.17 billion euros ($9.38 billion) of bonds today
as monetary easing by  Japan  is prompting investors to search for
better returns.  Italy  sold 4 billion euros of a new 2.25% 2016 bond at 2.29
percent, down from the 2.48 percent on similar maturity debt
March 13. Investors bid 1.40 times the amount of the new three-
year bond offered, up from 1.28 times last month.  The Rome-based treasury also sold longer-term debt, placing
1.67 billion of 4.75% 2028 bonds and 1.5 billion of floating-
rate 2017 bonds to yield respectively 4.68 percent and 2.74
percent. All together, Italy sold 7.17 billion euros of debt,
near the 7.5 billion-euro maximum target. The sale was probably
helped by 16.7 billion euros of bond redemptions due on April
15.  To contact the reporter on this story:
