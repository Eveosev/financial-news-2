Philippine 25-year bonds fell,
pushing the yield to a two-week high, on speculation a power-
price increase and demands for higher pay will spur inflation.  The Trade Union Congress of the Philippines filed a
petition on April 2 for an 85-peso ($2) increase in the daily
 minimum wage  in Manila to 541 pesos. Manila Electric Co. said
yesterday electricity costs in the capital and nearby areas will
be raised this month. Two cuts this year in the  interest rate 
the central bank pays on its special-deposit accounts, as well
as a March 27 upgrade by  Fitch Ratings , have contributed to a
1.45 percentage points drop in the 25-year bond yield in 2013.  “Some funds may have been taking profit, particularly on
long-dated debt that benefited the most from the central bank’s
special-deposit account rate cuts and the rating upgrade,” said
Smith Chua, a  fund manager  at BPI Asset Management Inc. in
Manila. “There’s also a wage hike petition and power rate
hike.”  The yield on the 6.125 percent bonds due October 2037
advanced eight basis points, or 0.8 percentage point, to 4.13
percent as of 4:03 p.m. local time, according to Tradition
Financial Services. That was the highest since March 25.  Consumer prices  rose 3.2 percent in March from a year
earlier, easing from a five-month high of 3.4 percent in
February, official data showed April 5. The government’s
inflation target is 3 percent to 5 percent in 2013.  The central bank is watchful of market developments,
including Japan’s stimulus measures, and their impact on the
local economy will be considered at its April 25 meeting,
Governor Amando Tetangco said this week.  The peso closed little changed at 41.065 per dollar from
41.055 yesterday, according to Tullett Prebon Plc. One-month
implied volatility, a measure of expected moves in the  exchange
rate  used to price options, rose two basis points to 4.86
percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
