The U.K. 10-year break-even rate,
an index of annual inflation expectations, increased to the
highest in more than 4 1/2 years after the nation sold 1.6
billion pounds of inflation-linked gilts maturing in 2024.  The  10-year break-even rate , derived from the difference in
yield between gilts and index-linked securities, increased four
basis points, or 0.04 percentage point, to 3.38 percentage
points as of 10:45 a.m. London time, the highest since September
2008.  To contact the reporter on this story:
