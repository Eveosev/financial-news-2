Sony Corp. (6758)  is sticking with a goal
of turning  Japan ’s largest TV-manufacturing business profitable
this fiscal year even as it continues losing global market share
to  Samsung Electronics Co. (005930)   Sony plans to increase TV sales this fiscal year from a
target of 13.5 million units in the year ended March 31, Masashi Imamura, a senior vice president in charge of home entertainment
products at Sony, told reporters in Tokyo today. He didn’t give
a new number.  The TV business probably lost about 80 billion yen ($804
million) in the fiscal year ended March 31, Imamura said,
reiterating a company projection from February for a ninth
straight year of losses. Chief Executive Officer  Kazuo Hirai  is
focusing on high-end products, such as the ultra-high definition
Bravia sets that offer resolution four times sharper than
conventional models, as part of plans to revive the operation.  “Major operational reform at the unit is over,” Imamura
said. “We will continue to make efforts to trim costs this
fiscal year. We have reduced the costs we had planned to reduce
in fiscal 2012, and that will help us make the business
profitable.”  The company trimmed its full-year TV sales target to 13.5
million units in February from the 17.5 million projected at the
beginning of the fiscal year, citing a slowing global economy.
The company is reducing the number of models and cutting 10,000
jobs to lower expenses after losing about 31 percent of its
market value last year.  Samsung, LG  Sony  ranked  third in the global flat-panel TV market in
2012, trailing  South Korea ’s Samsung and  LG Electronics Inc. (066570) , as
the Tokyo-based company’s share of revenue fell to 7.8 percent
from 11.2 percent a year earlier, according to DisplaySearch.  Worldwide shipments of liquid-crystal-display sets, the
biggest TV segment, may grow 7 percent to 216 million in 2013,
 according to DisplaySearch.   Sales at Japanese TV makers including Sony,  Panasonic Corp. (6752) 
and Sharp Corp. may change little, while South Korean peers and
Chinese manufacturers such as Hisense Electric Co. may boost
shipments by more than 10 percent, the researcher said.  Sony will release two new ultra-high definition TVs in
Japan starting June 1, including a 55-inch set costing 500,000
yen and a 65-inch set costing 750,000 yen, it said today. The
models follow an 84-inch set introduced last year as the
company’s first ultra-high definition set for home use.  To contact the reporter on this story:
