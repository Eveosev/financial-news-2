The top U.S. military officer said
he supports keeping 8,000 to 12,000 NATO troops in  Afghanistan 
after most allied forces leave the country at the end of 2014.  “I find that to be a reasonable target,” Army General
Martin Dempsey, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said
today at a hearing of the House Armed Services Committee. The
Obama administration hasn’t yet specified how many U.S. troops
it wants to keep in Afghanistan after most of them depart.  In February, then-Defense Secretary Leon Panetta discussed
with North Atlantic Treaty Organization allies in Brussels the
possibility of maintaining a combined allied presence of 8,000
to 12,000 troops.  Today, Dempsey called that “a reasonable target” when
asked whether it’s important for the administration to announce
planned U.S. troop levels as it seeks to negotiate an agreement
with the Afghan government for a continuing American presence to
provide training and conduct counterterror operations.  Some U.S. military officials and members of Congress have
publicly said that 13,600 American troops and 7,000 from other
countries will be necessary.  Among those who have been pressing for that big a force are
Marine General James Mattis, who retired last month as head of
the U.S. Central Command, and Marine General Joseph Dunford, the
commander of coalition forces in Afghanistan.  To contact the reporter on this story:
