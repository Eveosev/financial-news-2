Sony Corp.’s  Hawk-Eye Innovations
Ltd.  has been chosen to provide goal-line technology for the
Premier League, Sky Sports reported.  The technology, aimed at preventing goal-line errors in
soccer, will be in use from next season, according to the U.K.
broadcaster.  The move comes a week after  FIFA , the sport’s global
governing body, picked  Germany ’s GoalControl GmbH to provide
assistance at this year’s Confederations Cup in  Brazil .  Calls for technology that can prevent contentious line
calls intensified after the 2010 World Cup, when officials
failed to spot a shot from  England ’s Frank Lampard had crossed
the line in his team’s 4-1 defeat to Germany. Michel Platini,
president of European soccer’s governing body UEFA, is opposed
to the technology.  U.K., Basingstoke-based Hawk-Eye, bought by Sony Corp.’s
European unit in 2011, also provides line-call technology in
tennis and cricket.  To contact the reporter on this story:
