In my memory Margaret Thatcher's prime ministership remains like a visit to the proctologist: Something that it was necessary to endure in order to have a renewed lease on life. If this sounds blunt it is meant to be so. Thatcher was a very divisive figure, and few people in Britain have neutral views of her. When she said "There is no such thing as society," she meant it. She had little time for the welfare state, and allowed its showpiece, the National Health Service, to falter by neglect. On the other hand, she liked decisive and powerful men, in politics and in business. One result of this has had an enormous and positive result for travelers. As she set out to dismantle a vast apparatus of state-run industries, her gimlet eye fell upon British Airways. BA had evolved during the heyday of so-called flag carriers—when politicians strangely held to the view that a national airline should be under their control and used as a sovereign asset. In one respect BA managed that role admirably. It embodied a number of character traits thought to be definitively British: snobbery of the kind deployed by butlers toward the lower orders; indifference to the convenience of customers; an elaborate and virtually impenetrable set of rules defining the amenities on offer according to the class of cabin and, famously, flight attendants apparently trained in the most punitive tradition of nannies. BA's route structure was built during the days of the British Empire—its first incarnation was as Imperial Airways, which established the earliest international routes, and its second British Overseas Airways Corporation. As this organism developed and joined the club of other flag-carriers, international air fares were rigged by a cartel system, set not by any laws of the market place or by any sense of competition but by arbitrary ideas of the national interest and the need to control routes for strategic reasons. When Thatcher appraised BA it was a bloated, grossly inefficient and overstaffed jobs-for-life racket. It was also losing £140 million a year. To deal with it the Prime Minister chose John King, one of the group of self-made hard-driving businessmen she had decided should be the avatars of her program to privatize industry. King relished his task. By 1989 the airline was making a profit of pounds £268 million. He had cut 22,000 staff. Even then, BA's culture was proving hard to eradicate, and many more job cuts were to come, but at least it was becoming competitive by the terms of the modern airline business, not the rigged market of flag carriers. Today, BA, like other international carriers, is struggling to make consistent profits and is having problems digesting Iberia, the Spanish flag-carrier it bought. But its survival, growth, and market skills are testament to the pitiless logic applied to it by Margaret Thatcher, the Iron Lady. And nobody misses the butlers and nannies—or any of those other flag-carriers.
