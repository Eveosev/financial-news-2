The naira weakened the most in two
weeks amid speculation that investors in Nigeria’s bond and
equities market were demanding dollars to exchange profits made
in the local currency.  The currency of  Africa ’s biggest oil producer depreciated
as much as 0.2 percent to 157.68 per dollar, the most since
March 28, and traded at 157.60 by 3:09 p.m. in Lagos, the
commercial capital, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The
naira has retreated 1 percent this year. The Nigerian Stock
Exchange All Share Index fell 0.2 percent, taking its loss this
week to 2.1 percent as it heads for the first five-day decline
in five weeks.  “There’s significant demand from investors who want to
cash out of bonds and equities,” Jide Solanke, an analyst at
Lagos-based First Securities Discount House Ltd., said by phone.
“The central bank has increased the sale of dollars” and the
demand is “coinciding with the end-of-year company earnings,”
he said.  Banks, including  Guaranty Trust Bank Plc (GUARANTY)  and  Zenith Bank
Plc (ZENITHBA) , reported full-year earnings for 2012 this month. Guaranty’s
net income jumped 69 percent while Zenith Bank profit more than
doubled to 100.7 billion naira ($639 million). Yields on the
government’s naira bonds due January 2022 have risen 16 basis
points, or 0.16 percentage point, to 11 percent this week,
according to yesterday’s prices compiled by Bloomberg.  Dollar Sales  The  Central Bank of Nigeria  sold $600 million this week,
the biggest amount at its twice-a-week auctions in nine months.
The Abuja-based regulator sells the U.S. currency to keep the
naira within a 3 percent band above or below 155 per dollar.  The central bank has enough reserves to defend the naira
and “keep it where we want,” Governor Lamido Sanusi said in a
March 24 interview in Lagos.  Nigeria ’s foreign-currency  reserves 
advanced 10 percent to $48.7 billion this year, according to the
institution’s data.  Yields on Nigeria’s $500 million of Eurobonds due January
2021 dropped six basis points, or 0.06 percentage point, to 4
percent.  Ghana ’s cedi declined 0.2 percent to 1.945 per dollar in
the capital, Accra.  To contact the reporter on this story:
