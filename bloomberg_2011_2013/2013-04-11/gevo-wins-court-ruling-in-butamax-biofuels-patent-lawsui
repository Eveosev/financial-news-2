Gevo Inc. (GEVO) , a biofuel chemical
development company, won a court ruling in its favor as part of
a continuing series of patent-infringement lawsuits with Butamax
Advanced Biofuels LLC, a joint venture of DuPont Co. and BP Plc.  U.S. District Judge Sue Robinson in Wilmington,  Delaware ,
found that some claims of one Butamax patent were invalid and
that Butamax admitted that Gevo didn’t infringe another patent,
according to court papers.  “There is no just reason for delay in entering final
judgment” on those patent challenges, Robinson wrote yesterday
after ruling two weeks ago on two patents. The entering of a
final judgment allows Butamax to appeal.  The judge severed claims involving two other patents in
continuing litigation between the two companies involving at
least 15 different cases in the same court, according to court
papers.  Butamax sued Gevo in 2011, alleging misuse of technology
for genetically engineered microorganisms used to produce
biofuels. Gevo is in a joint venture to make the chemicals with
the oil refiner Total SA and specialty-chemicals maker  Lanxess
AG. (LXS)   “Butamax strongly disagrees with the court’s claim
construction” and has decided to appeal the case, said a
company spokesman, Mark Buse.  The case is Butamax v. Gevo, 11-cv-00054, U.S. District
Court, District of Delaware (Wilmington).  To contact the reporter on this story:
