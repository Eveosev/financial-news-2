European finance ministers were
advised by their chief deputy to back loan extensions for
Ireland and Portugal to keep those nations' recoveries on course.  “Portugal and Ireland are still highly vulnerable to
negative news from other euro-area member states,” according to
a letter from Eurogroup Working Group President  Thomas Wieser 
prepared for finance ministers from the 17-nation  euro zone  and
the 27-nation EU before meetings tomorrow in Dublin. He said
Irish and Portuguese rescue programs face “strong headwinds”
from events like the depositor losses imposed in Cyprus and
would benefit from a “strong signal” of EU support.  “I would recommend to ministers to come to a political
endorsement of the maturity extension,” Wieser said, noting
that financial markets have priced in the two nations getting
the rescue loan extensions. The so-called troika of European
authorities and the  International Monetary Fund  has recommended
that the loans be extended by seven years.  Wieser also urged the EU to conclude legislation on bank
supervision and on how to handle failing banks, so that it can
procede to the next stage of its banking union strategy, in a
separate letter to Irish Finance Minister  Michael Noonan .
Ireland currently holds the EU’s rotating presidency.  The EU needs to clarify the “rules of the game” for
handling failing banks, in particular to counter uncertainty
that has flared up since last month’s negotiations on a 10
billion-euro ($13.1 billion) aid package for Cyprus, Wieser
said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
