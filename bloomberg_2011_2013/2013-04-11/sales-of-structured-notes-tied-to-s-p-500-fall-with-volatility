Quarterly sales of U.S. structured
notes tied to the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index fell to an almost
two-year low as investors look to more volatile benchmarks for
more attractive deals.  Banks sold $1.96 billion of securities linked to the gauge
in the first three months of 2013 in 219 offerings, the slowest
period since $1.69 billion of issuance during the second quarter
of 2011, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Volatility for
the S&P 500, as measured by the Chicago Board Options Exchange
Volatility Index, or the  VIX (VIX) , fell to 11.3, a six-year low, on
March 14.  Investors are looking for notes tied to indexes where
traders expect larger price swings in order to get better terms,
said Dan Besse, managing director at Pacilio Wealth Management
in Westport,  Connecticut . Issuance of notes tied to the  Russell
2000 Index (RTY) , which tracks smaller companies than the S&P 500,
surged 82 percent to $679.7 million in the first three months
compared with the previous quarter, Bloomberg data show.  “I think if you’re buying structured notes when the VIX is
at all-time lows and the S&P’s at all-time highs, that’s a tough
time to be buying,” Besse said in a telephone interview.  The  S&P 500  has  climbed  11.3 percent this year to 1,587.7
yesterday.  Total sales of equity-linked notes climbed 25 percent last
quarter to $7.31 billion from the previous period, Bloomberg
data show.  Other Indexes  Notes tied to more volatile indexes have “higher return
potential,” Besse said. His firm isn’t buying structured notes
right now, he said, because of the effect of low volatility.
When the measure declines, the value of options embedded in
notes drops too, making it harder for issuers to create enticing
terms on certain kinds of securities.  The Russell 2000 Index rose 11.4 percent this year to
946.09 yesterday. Its implied volatility, as measured using at-
the-money options maturing in three months, was 15.8, about a
third higher than that of the S&P 500.  Bank of America Corp . sold $62.4 million of three-year
securities linked to the  Russell 2000  Index, the largest
offering tied to an equity benchmark other than the S&P 500
during the first quarter. The notes, issued Jan. 24, yield at
least 30 percent as long as the index doesn’t fall below its
initial value, according to a  prospectus  filed with the U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission.  The bank also issued $42 million of  three-year notes  tied
to the S&P 500 on March 28. The two securities have an almost
identical return, and terms are virtually the same, except the
Russell 2000 note has a 5 percent cushion against losses and
pays as much as 3 percentage points more when redeemed early.  Euro Stoxx 50  Matt Card, a spokesman for Bank of America, declined to
comment on the notes.  Banks sold $761.4 million of notes tied to the  Euro Stoxx
50 Index (SX5E)  last quarter, more than twice the preceding period’s
total. Expected price swings on the Euro Stoxx 50 Index, which
has climbed 1 percent to 2,661 this year, are even higher than
for the Russell 2000. At-the-money options imply future short-
term volatility of 17.7, Bloomberg data show.  Movements in stock prices have been tamped down because the
 Federal Reserve  buys $85 billion a month in Treasuries and
mortgage-backed securities and is keeping its benchmark rate
between zero and 0.25 percent for a fifth year, said  Michael McCarty , managing partner at Differential Research LLC in  New
York .  “Big stocks have benefited from the actions by the Fed and
the administration,” McCarty said in a telephone interview.
“Volatility will rise when the Fed stops buying all these
securities.”  Banks create structured notes by packaging debt with
derivatives to offer customized bets to retail investors while
earning fees and raising money. Derivatives are contracts whose
value is derived from stocks, bonds, commodities and currencies,
or events such as changes in  interest rates  or the weather.  To contact the reporter on this story:
