The Pentagon’s spokesman said “it
would be inaccurate to suggest that the North Korean regime has
fully tested, developed or demonstrated the kinds of nuclear
capabilities” mentioned in a passage from a report by the
 Defense Intelligence Agency .  George Little  commented in a statement reponding to a
passage in which the agency said it assesses “with moderate
confidence the North currently has nuclear weapons capable of
delivery by ballistic missiles however the reliability will be
low.” The sentence from a classified report was made public
today by a Republican House member during a committee hearing.  To contact the reporter on this story:
