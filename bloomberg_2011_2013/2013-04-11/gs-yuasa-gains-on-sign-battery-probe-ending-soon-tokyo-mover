GS Yuasa Corp. (6674) , a Japanese battery
maker, rose the most in a month in  Tokyo  trading after
 Mitsubishi Motors Corp. (7211)  said it aims to complete a probe this
month into overheating in cells made by a unit of the company.  The  manufacturer  of lithium-ion batteries climbed 4.7
percent, the most since March 8, to 399 yen at the close in
Tokyo trading. The Nikkei 225 Stock Average advanced 2 percent.  Mitsubishi Motors’ investigation of overheating batteries
in its Highlander hybrid found one cell that had a misshapen
electrode that may have been the result of excessive force, the
automaker told reporters yesterday in Tokyo. Batteries used in
the vehicles were made at a factory jointly owned by the Tokyo-
based carmaker, Yuasa and  Mitsubishi Corp. (8058)   GS Yuasa, which also makes the lithium-ion batteries  used 
in  Boeing Co. (BA) ’s 787 jet,  tumbled  11 percent the day after
Mitsubishi Motors said batteries made at the factory overheated.  GS Yuasa and Boeing have said the batteries are different
from ones used in the 787s. The jets were removed from
commercial service in January after batteries overheated on a
Japan Airlines Co. plane in  Boston  and during an All Nippon
Airways Co. flight in Japan.  To contact the reporters on this story:
