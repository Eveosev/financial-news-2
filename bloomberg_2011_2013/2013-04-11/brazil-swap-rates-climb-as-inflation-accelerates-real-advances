Brazil ’s swap rates climbed to a
one-week high after an inflation index rose at the fastest pace
this year, adding to speculation that policy makers will raise
borrowing cost as soon as next week.  Swap rates due in January 2015 increased seven basis
points, or 0.07 percentage point, to 8.55 percent at 10:11 a.m.
in  Sao Paulo , the highest level on a closing basis since April
3. The real appreciated 0.1 percent to 1.9707 per dollar.  The Getulio Vargas Foundation reported today that its IGP-M
inflation index of wholesale, construction and consumer prices
rose 0.42 percent from March 21 to March 31, the fastest pace
since a 0.50 percent increase in late November.  “There is a strong flow of news in favor of a rate hike,”
Daniel Cunha, an economist at XP Investimentos in Sao Paulo,
said in a telephone interview. “The signs are that prices are
resisting.”  The government benchmark consumer price  index  rose at an
annual rate of 6.59 percent in March, exceeding the 6.50 percent
upper limit of the central bank’s target range for the first
time since November 2011.  The government pays attention to inflation, which is
harmful to all of Brazil’s economy, Finance Minister  Guido
Mantega  told reporters in Brasilia yesterday.  To contact the reporters on this story:
