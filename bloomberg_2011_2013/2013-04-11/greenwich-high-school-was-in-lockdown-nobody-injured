Greenwich High School in
Connecticut went into lockdown this morning according to the
local police, who said no injuries to students or staff members
were reported.  “Nobody injured,” Kraig Gray, the police department’s
public information officer, said in a phone interview. There was
a lockdown, he said, providing no other details. A press
conference was scheduled for 12:30 p.m. at the police
department, he said.  A gunman killed 20 children and six staff members in
December at the Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown,
Connecticut, spurring efforts to pass stricter gun-control laws.  State lawmakers this month passed legislation that would
ban the sale of semiautomatic rifles and increase background
checks on gun buyers. The Newtown school killer, Adam Lanza,
reloaded his semiautomatic rifle with 30-round magazines six
times in less than five minutes, according to authorities.  The U.S. Senate today voted to advance a scaled-back
version of the gun-safety agenda President  Barack Obama  proposed
after the shootings in Newtown.  To contact the reporter on this story:
