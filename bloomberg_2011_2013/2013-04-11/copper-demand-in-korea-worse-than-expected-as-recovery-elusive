Copper demand in  South Korea ,
Asia’s third-biggest consumer, may decline this year compared
with an increase predicted earlier as the economic recovery is
not in sight, said an industry association.  The group had forecast a 2 percent gain in consumption of
refined copper to 738,000 tons this year from 723,505 tons in
2012, Kim Soo Bong, director at the Korea Nonferrous Metal
Association, said in an interview. While Kim said they will cut
the December estimate soon to show no growth or a decrease, he
declined to give a specific figure.  Copper, used to make wires and pipes, lost 5.8 percent in
the past year in  London  as the economic slowdown in  China , the
world’s biggest user, and  Europe ’s debt crisis hurt the global
economy and demand for metals. South Korea, Asia’s fourth-
largest economy, lowered its growth forecast in March and said
this month consumption and investment remain weak.  “The outlook now is more bearish than bullish,” Kim said
on April 5 in his Seoul office. “It does not appear that the
economy is going to pick up anytime soon. The economic condition
seems to be actually worsening.”  Copper for delivery in three months was little changed at
$7,577 a metric ton on the London Metal Exchange at 10:56 a.m.
in Seoul today. Prices are down 4.4 percent this year.  Inventories of the metal monitored by the LME climbed to
587,925 tons on April 10, the highest level since October 2003,
exchange figures showed. The LMEX  Index (LMEX)  of six metals lost about
six percent this year.  Metals Demand  South Korean demand for the six metals, including copper,
aluminum and zinc, may slip about 5 percent in 2013 from 3.06
million tons in 2012, Kim said. The group’s members include
Korea Zinc Co., LS-Nikko Copper Inc.,  Poongsan Corp. (103140)  and
steelmaker Posco.  “We had also expected overall metals demand would rise
this year, but are now forecasting a contraction,” Kim said.
“The economy was not good last year, which actually has run
through early this year.” said Kim.  The Korean economy  expanded  2 percent last year, the least
since the global financial crisis. The  finance ministry  on March
28 cut its 2013 growth forecast to 2.3 percent from 3 percent in
December, below the central bank’s 2.8 percent projection.  To contact the reporter on this story:
