Israel ’s newly appointed finance
minister, Yair Lapid, will present the guidelines of the 2013-14
budget to Prime Minister  Benjamin Netanyahu , setting the
approval process in motion.  “The finance minister will present his 2013-2014 budget
proposal to the prime minister,” Lapid’s spokeswoman, Nilly
Richman, said by telephone. She declined to provide any details
regarding the plan. Lapid said at the beginning of the month
that “tough” steps will be needed to close the budget gap.  Lapid, 49, a former TV host and columnist, was appointed
finance minister three weeks ago after the Yesh Atid party he
founded came in second in January’s election. The finance
minister, who promised in his party’s campaign to champion the
interests of the middle class, must cut billions of shekels from
government-promised funding and raise taxes to meet the
government’s deficit and spending limits.  Lapid’s budget proposal includes a cut of 14 billion
shekels ($3.8 billion) in planned spending for 2013 and 6
billion shekels in 2014, Calcalist newspaper reported today,
without saying where it got the information. The plan includes
cuts in defense and social spending, and tax increases, the
newspaper said.  Parliament must approve a budget by August.  To contact the reporter on this story:
