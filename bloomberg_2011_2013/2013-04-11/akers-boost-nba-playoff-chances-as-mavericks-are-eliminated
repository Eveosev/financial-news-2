Kobe Bryant  scored a season-high 47
points as the  Los Angeles Lakers  beat the Portland Trail Blazers
113-106 to boost their chances of reaching the National
Basketball Association playoffs.  The Dallas Mavericks (38-40) will miss the postseason for
the first time since 2000 after a 102-91 home loss to the
Phoenix Suns (24-55) eliminated them from playoff contention.  The Lakers (42-37) are eighth in the Western Conference,
one game ahead of the Utah Jazz (41-38) with three regular-
season games remaining for each team.  Los Angeles hosts the Golden State Warriors (45-33) and
Utah is at home against the Minnesota Timberwolves (29-49), both
on April 12.  Pau Gasol scored 23 points and  Dwight Howard  had 20 points
and 10 rebounds for the Lakers last night at the Rose Garden in
Portland.  Damian Lillard had 38 points for the Trail Blazers and
LaMarcus Aldridge added 17 points and 16 rebounds.  To contact the reporter on this story:
