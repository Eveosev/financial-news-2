Chile ’s peso traded within 0.3
percent of a 19-month high as investors await a statement due
today from the central bank that may signal whether officials
are considering intervention in the exchange rate.  The peso was little changed at 468.53 per U.S. dollar as of
10:19 a.m. in Santiago. On April 8 the peso reached 467.05 per
dollar, the strongest since September 2011.  Chile’s central bank will announce today its monthly
interest-rate decision after 6 p.m. in Santiago. Analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg forecast the monetary authority will keep
the benchmark rate at 5 percent for a 15th consecutive month as
inflation remains below a target range and the economy expands.  “There’s an expectation that the central bank will say
something in its interest-rate statement to signal concern about
the peso’s strength,” Matias  Madrid , an economist at Banco
Penta, said in a telephone interview today. “If they don’t
change the wording from past statements” the peso will
strengthen significantly.  The peso weakened 0.3 percent yesterday after Chile’s
Finance minister Felipe Larrain said that intervention is an
option in the currency market and the government will coordinate
with the central bank. The minister is a non-voting member of
the central bank’s board.  The central bank last intervened in January 2011, when it
announced plans to buy $12 billion in daily allotments of $50
million. The peso was trading at 465.75 when it announced the
intervention, which continued through December of that year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
