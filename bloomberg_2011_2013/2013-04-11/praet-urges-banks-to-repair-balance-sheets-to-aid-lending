Euro-area banks need to repair
their balance sheets rather than relying on supportive monetary
policy to prop up the economy, European Central Bank Executive
Board member Peter Praet said.  The ECB cut  interest rates , bought bonds and made long-term
loans to banks to protect against a “destructive and self-
reinforcing downward spiral” of companies selling assets to
reduce leverage, Praet said in an article prepared for a
conference in Dublin today and obtained by  Bloomberg News .
“Maintaining these very supportive policies for too long can,
however, have undesirable side effects,” Praet said.  Policy now should emphasize “the responsibility of the
financial industry itself to resolve the structural balance
sheet problems in the euro-area banking sector,” Praet said.
“Only structural balance sheet repair can sustainably restore
banks’ lending capacity to the real economy.”  Praet said productivity growth could compensate for the
damage caused by scaled-back borrowing across the economy. In a
second article prepared for the conference, he said research
shows that “unusually long” recessions tend to accompany
deleveraging episodes.  To contact the reporters on this story:
