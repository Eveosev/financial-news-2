Turkish bond yields fell for a
second day as Moody’s Investors Service praised  Turkey ’s efforts
to end its three-decade war with Kurdish militants, reinforcing
speculation of a credit rating upgrade.  Yields on two-year benchmark bonds fell 11 basis points to
5.71 percent, the lowest level since Feb. 28, at 1:16 p.m. in
Istanbul, extending this week’s drop to 38 basis points. The
lira strengthened 0.2 percent to 1.7852 per dollar, giving a
gain in the week of 0.4 percent.  Turkey’s establishment last week of a parliament commission
to monitor the  peace process  was a “visible and credit-positive
step,” New York-based Moody’s said in a report published today.
Ending the conflict will “improve southeastern Turkey’s
attractiveness as a destination for foreign direct investment,
which would deliver economic benefits and reduce Turkey’s
external vulnerabilities,” Moody’s said.  “These comments from Moody’s support our overweight stance
of Turkish local bonds,” Esther Law, a London-based director of
emerging-market strategy at  Societe Generale SA (GLE) , wrote in an e-
mailed note. A Moody’s upgrade “will undoubtedly broaden the
investor base for Turkish debt to even non emerging-market
dedicated investors, especially in this yield-hunting world.”  Moody’s and Standard & Poor’s both rate Turkey’s debt one
step below investment grade, while Fitch raised it to investment
grade in November. Moody’s has a positive outlook on its rating.  To contact the reporter on this story:
