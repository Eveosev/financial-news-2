Stephen Gallo , ranked the most-
accurate currency forecaster in a Bloomberg-compiled review in
June 2011, has joined Bank of Montreal as European head of
currency strategy in London.  His appointment was confirmed by Alexis Brown, a Toronto-
based spokeswoman for Canadaâ€™s fourth-largest lender, in an e-
mailed response to questions yesterday. Gallo started his role
on April 8, Brown said in a telephone interview today.  Gallo left his job as foreign-exchange strategist at Credit
Agricole SA in London in November. He had joined the French bank
in May from Schneider Foreign Exchange Ltd., now called Monex
Europe Ltd., where he was head of market analysis.  To contact the reporters on this story:
