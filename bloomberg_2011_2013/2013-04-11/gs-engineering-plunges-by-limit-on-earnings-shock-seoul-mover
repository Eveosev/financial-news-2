GS Engineering & Construction Corp. (006360) 
tumbled by the daily limit in Seoul trading, leading declines
among South Korean builders, after reporting an unexpected loss.  GS Engineering plunged 15 percent to 42,000 won at the
close on the Korea Exchange, the steepest loss since December
1998 and making it the  worst-performer  on the MSCI Asia Pacific
Index. The  34-member (KOSPCONS)  Kospi Construction Index slumped 5.3
percent to the lowest level since December 2008.  The Seoul-based builder posted an operating loss of 535.4
billion won ($474 million) for the first quarter, the company
said in a regulatory filing yesterday. Analysts had expected a
profit, data compiled by Bloomberg  show . Deutsche Bank AG cut
its stock rating to sell, while Daiwa  Capital Markets  did the
same, citing “large” losses from overseas projects.  “It’s an earnings shock and the share-price slump seems
inevitable,” Im Jeong Jae, a Seoul-based  fund manager  at
Shinhan BNP Paribas Asset Management Co., which oversees about
$29 billion, said by phone today. “The result raised concerns
about overall builders’ margin for overseas projects.”  Daelim Industrial Co. sank 9.3 percent, Samsung Engineering
Co. slid 11 percent and Hyundai Engineering & Construction Co.
retreated 5.2 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
