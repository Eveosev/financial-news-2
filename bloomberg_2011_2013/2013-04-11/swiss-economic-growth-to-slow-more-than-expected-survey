Switzerland ’s  economic growth  will
slow more than expected this year, according to economists in a
Bloomberg survey.  Gross domestic product is seen rising 0.3 percent in the
three months through June 30 before growing 0.4 percent each in
the third and the fourth quarter, according to the median
forecast of 25 analysts in Bloomberg’s quarterly survey on the
Swiss economy, which was carried out April 5-10. In a March
survey, economists saw GDP growing 0.4 percent in the second
quarter, 0.5 percent in the third and 0.5 percent in the final
quarter of this year. The economists see growth of 1.2 percent
for 2013, unchanged from last month’s prediction.  Swiss  output growth  slowed to 1 percent in 2012 as the
fiscal crisis in the euro area, its biggest trading partner,
hurt the country’s export-led economy. The  Swiss National Bank ,
which set a cap of 1.20 per euro on the franc in September 2011
to ward off deflation and a recession, expects GDP to expand as
much as 1.5 percent this year.  In the survey, the economists said GDP probably rose 0.2
percent in the three months through March 31, unchanged from the
previous survey. The Swiss government will release first-quarter
GDP figures on May 30.  Consumer prices , which have fallen on an annual basis for
the past 18 months and probably declined 0.3 percent in the
first quarter of this year, are forecast to be flat in 2013,
lower than the 0.2 percent predicted in March, according to the
survey. Inflation is predicted to average 0.8 percent in 2014
and 1.3 percent in 2015, the survey shows.  Unemployment, which held at a two-year high of 3.1 percent
in March, is expected to rise to 3.2 percent in the third
quarter and to 3.3 percent in the final three months of 2013,
according to the survey.  To contact the reporters on this story:
