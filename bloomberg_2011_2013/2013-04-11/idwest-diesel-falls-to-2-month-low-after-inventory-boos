U.S. Midwest diesel fuel weakened
to a two-month low against  New York  futures after inventories
climbed for the first time in a month. Crack spreads retreated.  Supplies of  distillate  in the Midwest, referred to as PADD
2, gained 26,000 barrels to 29.1 million in the week ended April
4, advancing from the  lowest level  since Dec. 28, according to
Energy Information Administration data.  Ultra-low-sulfur diesel  in the Midwest, or Group 3 region,
fell 0.5 cents to trade at a premium of 4.75 cents a gallon to
futures on the New York Mercantile Exchange at 2:42 p.m., the
lowest level since Feb. 11, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. Conventional , 87-octane gasoline  in Group 3
strengthened 0.75 cent to a discount of 14.5 cents a gallon.  The 3-2-1 crack spread in the Midwest, a rough measure of
 refinery profit margins  for gasoline and diesel based on West
Texas Intermediate in Cushing,  Oklahoma , declined 29 cents to
$23.03 a barrel, a nine-week low.  The  same spread  on the Gulf rose 6 cents to $21.49 a
barrel, while the 3-2-1 margin based on Light Louisiana Sweet
oil was $7.49 a barrel. Diesel in the Midwest traded 6.27 cents
a gallon above the Gulf, while gasoline was at a premium of 2.38
a gallon.  To contact the reporter on this story:
