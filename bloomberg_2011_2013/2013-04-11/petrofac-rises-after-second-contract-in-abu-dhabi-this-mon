Petrofac Ltd. (PFC) , a U.K.-based oil
engineer, rose to a two-week high in London trading after
winning a $2.9 billion contract in Abu Dhabi, its second in the
Gulf emirate this month.  The shares gained 0.6 percent to 1,438 pence at the close,
valuing the company at 4.97 billion pounds ($8 billion). Thatâ€™s
the highest price since March 26.  Petrofac won the contract for the Upper Zakum field
development together with Daewoo Shipbuilding & Marine
Engineering Co., the London-based company said today in a
statement. The total contract was $3.7 billion, it said.  The works include construction of facilities such as crude
oil processors, export pumps, water injection plants, and power
generation units, Petrofac said. The facilities will start
operating in 2016, it said.  Earlier this month, Petrofac was awarded the Satah Al-
Razboot field development in  Abu Dhabi  with Hyundai Engineering
& Construction Co. The contract was valued at $2.4 billion.  To contact the reporter on this story:
