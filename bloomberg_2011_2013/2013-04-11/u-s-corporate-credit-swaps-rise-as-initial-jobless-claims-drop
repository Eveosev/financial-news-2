The cost to protect against a
default by  Rite Aid Corp. (RAD)  from default plunged after the
drugstore chain reported its first annual profit since 2007 as
it benefits from a focus on wellness programs.  Five-year credit-default swaps linked to Rite Aid fell 82.8
basis points to 475.1 basis points at 3:30 p.m. in New York,
according to CMA, the data provider owned by McGraw-Hill Cos.
that compiles prices quoted by dealers. That means investors are
paying the equivalent of $475,100 annually to protect $10
million of debt from losses for five years.  Rite Aid reported  net income  of $118.1 million, or 12 cents
a share, for the fiscal year ended March 2, compared with a loss
of $368.6 million, or 43 cents, a year earlier, according to a
statement today. The company last reported an annual profit of
$26.8 million in its fiscal year 2007.  The chain seeks to be a “neighborhood destination for
health and wellness,” Chief Executive Officer John Standley
said in the release today. About 17 percent of the chain’s 4,623
locations have been turned into wellness centers with expanded
pharmacy services and health-focused products.  Shares of Rite Aid  surged  18 percent to $2.12 in New York,
the highest price since September 2009. The company was the  best
performer  today in the  Russell 2000 Index. (RTY)   A gauge of U.S. corporate credit risk held as Americans
filed fewer applications for unemployment benefits last week
amid seasonal adjustments.  Jobless Claims  The Markit CDX North American Investment Grade Index, a
credit-default swaps benchmark that investors use to hedge
against losses or to speculate on creditworthiness, narrowed 0.5
basis point to a mid-price of 81.5 basis points at 4:27 p.m. in
New York, according to prices compiled by Bloomberg.  The  measure  fell for a sixth consecutive session and
reached the lowest intraday level since March 19. New versions
of Markit Group Ltd.’s indexes are created every six months, and
traders started moving positions into Series 20 of the
investment-grade gauge on March 20.  Jobless claims decreased by 42,000 to 346,000 in the week
ended April 6, from a revised 388,000, Labor Department figures
showed today in  Washington . The  median  forecast of 49 economists
surveyed by Bloomberg called for a drop to 360,000. Holidays
such as Easter that fall on different weeks from year to year
make it difficult to smooth out swings in the  data , leading to
increased volatility, the Labor Department said.  High Yield  “While our economy is doing better than most, it’s still
not doing great,” Robert Grimm, head of corporate trading at
Odeon Capital Group LLC, said in a telephone interview from
Greenwich,  Connecticut . “Credit spreads are holding in very
tight because the stock market is OK. We’re in a market that
just wants to go up, but it can’t forever.”  The credit-swaps index typically falls as investor
confidence improves and rises as it deteriorates. The contracts
pay the buyer face value if a borrower fails to meet its
obligations, less the value of the defaulted debt. A basis point
equals $1,000 annually on a contract protecting $10 million of
debt.  The risk premium on the Markit CDX North American High
Yield Index declined 4.8 basis points to 399.4, Bloomberg prices
show.  The average relative yield on speculative-grade, or junk-
rated, debt narrowed 2.2 basis point to 522.1 basis points,
Bloomberg data show. High-yield, high-risk debt is rated below
Baa3 by Moody’s Investors Service and less than BBB- at Standard
& Poor’s.  To contact the reporter on this story:
