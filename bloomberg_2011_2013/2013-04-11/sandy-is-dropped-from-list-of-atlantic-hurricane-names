The name Sandy will never be used
again by the  National Hurricane Center .  The  World Meteorological Organization  struck the name from
its official list for Atlantic storms because Sandy killed at
least 147 people and caused estimated $50 billion in damage as
it tore through the Caribbean and crashed into the coast of New
Jersey in October, the U.S. center said today in a statement.  Sandy becomes the 77th name retired from the list and will
be replaced with Sara beginning in 2018. Hurricane names are
reused every six years. If a storm is particularly deadly or
damaging, the name may be dropped to avoid confusion and show
respect for the victims.  A tropical system receives a name when its sustained winds
reach 39 miles (63 kilometers) per hour. A committee of the
Geneva-based WMO maintains the lists of names set by the Miami-
based hurricane center and in other countries,  according to its
website . The WMO, a United Nations agency, helps coordinate
international cooperation on climate and weather.  Sandy went ashore in New Jersey as a hybrid storm just
hours after merging with frontal system off the East Coast. Its
surge flooded parts of  New York  City and the New Jersey shore.
In addition to the people killed directly by the storm, 87 died
in its aftermath,  the center said .  Sandy is also blamed for destroying or damaging 650,000
homes and knocking out power to 8.5 million customers, some for
weeks, said a hurricane center analysis. It was the second-
costliest system since 1900, after Hurricane Katrina in 2005,
the center said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
