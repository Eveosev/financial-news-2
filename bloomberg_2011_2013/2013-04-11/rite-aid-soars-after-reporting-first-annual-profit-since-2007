Rite Aid Corp. (RAD)  rose to the highest
price in more than three years after reporting its first annual 
profit  since 2007, saying the company is benefiting from a focus
on wellness programs.  The shares soared 18 percent to $2.12 at the close in New
York, marking their biggest one-day gain since June 2009 and the
highest price since September of that year. The third-largest
U.S. drugstore chain has risen 25 percent in the past 12 months,
as the Russell 2000 Index added 19 percent.  Chief Executive Officer John Standley is remodeling the
Camp Hill, Pennsylvania-based company’s stores to spur visits
with new displays such as eye-care centers where customers can
order contact lenses or glasses. Earnings also benefited from
demand for higher-margin generic drugs and last year’s dispute
between larger  Walgreen Co. (WAG)  and employee-benefits manager
Express Scripts Holding Co. that sent customers to Rite Aid.  “The underlying business, excluding the generic benefit
and the Walgreen windfall, appears quite healthy,”  John Heinbockel , an analyst at Guggenheim Securities in New York,
wrote today in a note. He recommends buying Rite Aid shares.  Net income for the fiscal year ended March 2 was $118.1
million, or 12 cents a share, compared with a loss of $368.6
million, or 43 cents, a year earlier, the company said in a
statement.  About 17 percent of the chain’s 4623 locations have been
turned into wellness centers with expanded pharmacy services and
health-focused products.  Profit this year will be 4 cents to 20 cents a share, Rite
Aid said. That compares with an average estimate of 4 cents a
share from seven analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. Revenue will be
$24.9 billion to $25.3 billion, the company said. Analysts
estimated $25.2 billion, on average.  To contact the reporter on this story:
