The rand retreated for the first
time in seven days after South African manufacturing output
unexpectedly contracted in February.  The currency retreated 0.1 percent to 8.9158 per dollar by
3:54 p.m. in Johannesburg, after rising as much as 0.5 percent.
Yields on 10.5 percent bonds due December 2026 climbed one basis
point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 7.05 percent.  Factory output declined to 2.9 percent from revised growth
of 3.7 percent in January, as stagnant domestic and global
growth curbed demand, offsetting the benefits of a weaker rand,
Pretoria-based Statistics  South Africa  said on its website
today. The median estimate in a Bloomberg survey of nine
economists was for 2.1 percent growth. None of the economists
expected a contraction. Output slipped 3.1 percent in the month.  “Economic growth continues to disappoint,” Nicky Weimar
and Dennis Dykes, economists at  Nedbank Group Ltd. (NED)  in
Johannesburg, wrote in an e-mailed note after the manufacturing
report. The Monetary Policy Committee is expected to leave
 interest rates  unchanged until the second half of 2014, the
economists said.  A recession in Europe, which accounts for a fifth of South
African exports, and local labor unrest have curbed growth and
undermined  consumer confidence  in South Africa. The  Reserve Bank 
and National Treasury expect the economy to expand 2.7 percent
this year, less than the 7 percent the government is targeting
to address a 24.9 percent unemployment rate. Manufacturing makes
up about 15 percent of South Africa’s gross domestic product.  To contact the reporters on this story:
