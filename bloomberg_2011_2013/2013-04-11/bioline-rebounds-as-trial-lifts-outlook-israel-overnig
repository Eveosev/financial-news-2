BioLineRX Ltd. (BLRX)  is rebounding from a

company that hasn’t turned a profit since 2010.  Shares of BioLineRX jumped 5.1 percent in  New York 
yesterday, the most in two months, to $1.86. Trading volumes
were more than six times the daily average over the past three

testing on its BL-8040 treatment for acute myeloid leukemia,
according to a statement issued yesterday. The Jerusalem-based
company’s shares plunged 53 percent March 20 as  BioLineRX (BLRX)  said
that it was ending development of an experimental schizophrenia
drug after it failed to help patients in a mid-stage trial. The
stock touched a record-low $1.59 April 4.  “No one is giving the company any credit for its pipeline
whatsoever after its first and most important drug failed,”
Raghuram Selvaraju, an analyst at Aegis Capital Corp. who has
rated BioLineRX buy since October, said by phone yesterday. “I
tell investors who got burned not to dump their stock. At these
levels, there’s very little downside risk and a lot of potential
upside.”  Posted Losses  BioLineRX, which has a market capitalization of $41.4
million, is trading at about a third of its record high of $5.59
reached in July 2011. The company has posted  losses  for the past
nine quarters and last recorded net income of 77.34 million
shekels ($21.24 million) for the three months to Sept. 30, 2010,
data compiled by Bloomberg show.  The study will evaluate the ability of BL-8040 to mobilize
cancer cells from the bone marrow to the peripheral blood and
induce their death, BioLineRX said in the statement. Acute
myeloid leukemia is a cancer of the blood and bone marrow,
according to the  National Cancer Institute .  BiolineRX’s  enterprise value  may double if the BL-8040
leukemia treatment succeeds, according to Aegis’ Selvaraju. The
metric, which is the sum of market capitalization, preferred
equity, and short- and long-term interest-bearing debt, less
cash and equivalents, was at of $23.1 million yesterday,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  BioLineRX declined 26 percent this year as its experimental
treatment for schizophrenia, BL-1020, didn’t meet a trial’s main
goal of improving cognitive function compared with risperidone,
a generic drug, the company said in a statement on March 20.  BioLineRX Rallies  Shares of BioLineRX in  Tel Aviv  dropped 7 percent to 68
