Brussels Airlines NV Chief
Executive Officer Bernard Gustin said cost cuts will enable the
airline to reduce losses this year by about 66 precent.  First-quarter costs, excluding fuel, were 10 to 15 percent
below the prior year’s level, Gustin said in an interview at the
CAPA Centre for Aviation conference. While cost reductions met
goals, revenue growth was more of a challenge, he said.  Brussels Air, which is 45-percent owned by  Deutsche
Lufthansa AG (LHA) , embarked on a restructuring plan after posting a
60.7 million-euro ($79.7 million) net loss last year. The
airline aims to trim its loss to 20 million euros this year
before delivering a profit next year. Efforts to improve
profitability have included reducing pilot flight time during
the winter season.  “What we have seen so far is we are on plan,” Gustin
said. “Our performance so far was much better than last year.”  Brussels Air’s European network, which was largely
responsible for last year’s losses, has shown signs of recovery,
Gustin said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
