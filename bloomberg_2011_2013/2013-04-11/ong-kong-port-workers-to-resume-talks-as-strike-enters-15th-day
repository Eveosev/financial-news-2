Striking dockworkers at  Hongkong
International Terminals Ltd. , the port operator backed by
billionaire  Li Ka-shing , will resume talks with their employers
today after discussions yielded no agreement yesterday.  The meeting is scheduled at 2:30 p.m. and officials from
Hongkong International will attend as observers, the company
said in an e-mailed statement. About 450 workers have been
staying away from the world’s third-biggest container port since
March 28, demanding a 25 percent increase in wages and better
working conditions.  Shipping lines including Evergreen Marine Corp. Taiwan Ltd.
and Japan’s  Mitsui OSK Lines Ltd. (9104)  diverted vessels or skipped
calling at  Hong Kong , as the strike caused delays. Hongkong
International Terminals was running at about 80 percent of usual
operating levels, the company said this week.  Hutchison Port Holdings Trust (HPHT) , operator of Hongkong
International Terminals,  rose  1.2 percent to 85 cents as of
11:55 a.m. in Singapore trading. The stock has gained 7.6
percent this year.  Li denied a Sing Tao report that said the billionaire
intervened in the talks and may increase wages by more than 5
percent, the port operator said in the statement. The workers
are employed by contractors and not directly by Hongkong
International Terminals.  Li’s  Hutchison Whampoa Ltd. (13)  is the largest shareholder in
Hutchison Port Holdings Trust. Hutchison Port controls more than
half of Hong Kong’s port capacity with its partner  Cosco Pacific
Ltd. (1199)  The trust’s terminals in Shenzhen also control 46 percent
of the market there.  To contact the reporter on this story:
