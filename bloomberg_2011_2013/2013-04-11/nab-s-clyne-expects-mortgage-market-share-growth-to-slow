National Australia Bank Ltd. (NAB) , which
has gained mortgage market share from its rivals in the past
three years, expects the pace of that growth to slow as
competition intensifies amid low credit expansion.  “I think competitors are back,” Cameron Clyne, chief
executive officer of the country’s biggest bank by assets, said
in an interview in Sydney today. “You have got four big banks
built around big levels of origination and if there is less
origination they tend to fight for it more aggressively.”  Clyne has led the push into the A$1.1 trillion ($1.2
trillion) Australian mortgage market by offering the lowest
home-loan rate among the country’s four-largest banks. National
 Australia ’s mortgage-market share increased to 15 percent by
August 2012 from 12.8 percent in August 2009, company filings
show. It remains the third-largest mortgage lender in the
country, behind  Commonwealth Bank of Australia  and  Westpac
Banking Corp. (WBC)   National Australia, Commonwealth Bank, Westpac and
 Australia & New Zealand Banking Group Ltd. (ANZ)  control 85 percent of
the mortgage market, which is expanding at close to the slowest
pace since records began in 1977.  To contact the reporter on this story:
