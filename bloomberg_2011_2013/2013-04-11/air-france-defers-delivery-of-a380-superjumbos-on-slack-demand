Air France-KLM Group (EAD)  is looking to
push back delivery of two Airbus SAS A380 superjumbos it has on
order as  Europe ’s biggest airline reins in capacity growth amid
sluggish demand.  The company, which has eight A380s in the fleet of its
French division and four yet to arrive, disclosed the plans in
documentation published ahead of a May 16 annual meeting. It
also canceled a single A380 option that couldn’t be extended.  Air France-KLM is delaying deliveries of the double-decker
as it pursues a three-year plan aimed at paring debt and lifting
productivity to make it more competitive. The A380s in question
had been due for handover in 2013 and 2014, and the carrier will
now take just one plane in each year, according to Airbus.  “Given the uncertain economic environment and the
persistent imbalance between transport supply and demand, the
group has opted for a limited increase in capacity in both
passenger and cargo,”  Air France-KLM (AF)  said in the AGM document.
Delivery of one Boeing Co. 777 will also be delayed by a year.  Rate Reduction  The carrier’s main operational fleet stood at 407 aircraft
as of Dec. 31, of which 167 are long-haul planes. Following
capacity growth of just 0.6 percent last year, it plans
increases of 1.5 percent in 2013 and 2 percent next year.  Airbus said in January it aims to win 25 A380 sales this
year after securing only nine against a target of 30 in 2012 for
a plane that seats 525 passengers in a three-class layout.  The Toulouse, France-based company, which handed over the
100th superjumbo on March 14, has also cut the delivery rate for
this year to 25 aircraft to help cope with wing repairs.  “We listen to our customers and try best to work along
their current fleet needs,” Airbus spokesman  Stefan Schaffrath 
said, adding that delivery dates for the last two Air France
A380s are under discussion and “subject to confidentiality.”  Deutsche Lufthansa AG (LHA)  board member Carsten Spohr confirmed
today that Europe’s second-biggest airline is sticking with a
capacity freeze at its main German business. According to plans
first revealed last year, Lufthansa will keep the fleet at 400
aircraft, with older models retired faster than originally
planned as new, more fuel-efficient planes are delivered.  The freeze means the carrier will operate 20 fewer aircraft
than once planned this year and double that number in 2014.  Cologne-based Lufthansa will trim the number of single-
aisle models to three as part of a push to restore European
profitability that will see the carrier fold its main brand’s
short-haul flights outside Frankfurt and Munich into an enlarged
version of the Germanwings low-cost unit.  Lufthansa’s Bombardier Inc. DHC-8s and Avions de Transport
Regional ATR72s will go this year, followed by its Bombardier
CRJ700 turboprops and  Boeing Co. (BA)  737s in 2015, Spohr said.  French newspaper La Tribune reported earlier that Air
France would delaying taking the A380s to conserve cash.  To contact the reporter on this story:
