The Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries will reduce its crude shipments this month
as demand from refiners dips during seasonal maintenance,
according to tanker tracker Oil Movements.  The group that supplies about 40 percent of the world’s oil
will reduce crude exports by about 210,000 barrels a day, or 0.9
percent, to 23.65 million a day in the four weeks to April 27,
the researcher said today in an e-mailed report. The figures
exclude  Angola  and  Ecuador .  Middle East shipments will decrease by 1.2 percent to 17.3
million barrels a day in the period, compared with 17.51 million
in the four weeks to March 30, according to Oil Movements. That
figure includes non-OPEC members Oman and Yemen.  OPEC and the  International Energy Agency  this week lowered
their forecasts for global oil demand this year as the euro
area’s debt crisis continues to weigh on the economy. OPEC
trimmed its 2013 estimate by 40,000 barrels a day yesterday,
predicting that demand will grow by 800,000 barrels a day, or
0.9 percent, to 89.66 million a day.  The IEA reduced its estimate by 45,000 barrels a day today,
predicting that world consumption will increase by a “subdued”
795,000 barrels a day, or 0.9 percent, to 90.58 million barrels
a day this year.  Crude on board tankers will average 468.93 million barrels,
down 1.7 percent from the previous period, Oil Movements’ data
show. Oil Movements calculates the volumes by tallying tanker
bookings. Its figures exclude crude held on vessels for storage.  OPEC’s members are  Algeria , Angola, Ecuador, Iran, Iraq,
 Kuwait , Libya, Nigeria, Qatar,  Saudi Arabia , the United Arab
Emirates and Venezuela.  To contact the reporter on this story:
