Acadia Pharmaceuticals Inc. (ACAD) , a
biotechnology company with $5 million in annual revenue, surged
to its highest value in five years after saying it will gain a
U.S. regulatory review of its lead drug sooner than anticipated.  Acadia increased 64 percent to $13.10 at the close in New
York, the highest price since February 2008. The San Diego-based
company plans to apply for Food and Drug Administration review
of pimavanserin by the end of 2014.  The FDA agreed Acadia won’t have to conduct a final-phase
trial that had been scheduled to begin later this month, the
company said today in a statement. Instead, Acadia can use trial
results and supportive data from other studies to seek the
review of pimavanserin, which is intended to treat Parkinson’s
disease psychosis.  “We are very pleased with the outcome of our meeting with
the FDA, which we expect will reduce substantially both the time
and cost of our PDP development program,” Uli Hacksell,
Acadia’s chief executive officer, said in a statement.  Pimavanserin is a once-a-day pill Acadia is studying to
treat a loss of contact with reality that includes
hallucinations that can accompany Parkinson’s disease.  Acadia shares rose almost eightfold in the 12 months
through today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
