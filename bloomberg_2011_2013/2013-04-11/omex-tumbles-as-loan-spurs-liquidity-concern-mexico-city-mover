Desarrolladora Homex SAB (HOMEX*) ,  Mexico ’s
biggest homebuilder by sales, tumbled to the lowest price on
record as the company’s announcement of a bridge loan today
added to speculation that it’s strapped for cash.  The shares  fell  9.3 percent to 16.90 pesos at 12:13 p.m. in
Mexico City, after earlier falling as much as 13 percent to
16.14 pesos, the lowest ever intraday price. Volume was 161
percent of its 3-month daily average.  Homex said in a regulatory filing that it obtained a bridge
loan through ABC Capital under a Sociedad Hipotecaria Federal
guarantee program that it will use as working capital to build
apartments. The size of the loan wasn’t disclosed. Homex said it
was the first homebuilder in its industry to get a loan under
the new SHF program.  “The market is taking the news badly about the guaranteed
credit,”  Carlos Hermosillo , an analyst with Grupo Financiero
Banorte SAB, said in a telephone interview from Mexico City.
“They’re seeing it more as though they really need liquidity,
and they’re using it as a last resort. I don’t think that’s
necessarily the case, but that’s the market’s interpretation.”  Under the program announced March 6, the federal government
will guarantee as much as 30 percent of losses.  “These federal government programs are very supportive of
those of us in the housing industry,” Gerardo de Nicolas,
Homex’s chief executive officer, wrote in the company’s
statement today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
