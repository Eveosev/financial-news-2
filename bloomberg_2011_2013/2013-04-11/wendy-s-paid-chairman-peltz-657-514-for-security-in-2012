Wendy’s Co. (WEN) , the second-largest
U.S. hamburger chain, paid $657,514 for Chairman  Nelson Peltz ’s
personal security last year.  Peltz, the founder and chief executive officer of New York-
based Trian Fund Management LP, has received more than $1.7
million from the company in the past three years for security,
including guards and equipment, according to Wendy’s proxy
statements filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission.  “It’s not the norm,” said  Jeffrey Sonnenfeld , a
management professor at  Yale University  in New Haven,
Connecticut. “For somebody who has a domestic portfolio of many
companies, it’s much harder to justify this.”  Jonathan Doorley, a spokesman for Trian who works for Sard
Verbinnen & Co., declined to comment.  Peltz, 70, has been on the company’s board since April 1993
and served as non-executive chairman since June 2007, according
to the company’s website. As of April 1, he  owned  4.1 percent
and Trian owned 21 percent of Wendy’s, making him the largest
shareholder. Peltz also is a director at  Ingersoll-Rand Plc (IR) ,
 Legg Mason Inc. (LM)  and  HJ Heinz Co. (HNZ)   “In connection with Mr. Peltz’s service as non-executive
Chairman, and as a result of the Company’s review of potential
security concerns, the Board of Directors has approved payments
for certain security services, security personnel and
residential security equipment provided to Mr. Peltz and members
of his immediate family,” Wendy’s said in the most recent proxy
filing on April 8.  Fast Food  The fast-food chain pays for Peltz’s security “because he
serves as non-executive chairman of the Wendy’s Co.,” Bob Bertini, a Wendy’s spokesman, said in an interview. He declined
to specify what the compensation covers.  “We don’t discuss our safety and security,” Bertini said
in response to questions about security for other executives.  Peltz received $807,985 in total compensation from Wendy’s
in 2012, a 3.2 percent increase from the prior year. Wendy’s
paid him $638,911 in 2011 and $444,119 in 2010 for security.  Executives at other companies have received money for
personal protection. Former  J.C. Penney Co. (JCP)  CEO  Ron Johnson 
received $29,889 for a home security system last year, according
to the Plano, Texas-based company’s latest proxy. The retailer
requires that its CEO participate in a so-called Key Associate
Protection Program intended to safeguard the CEO and immediate
family members, according the the filing.  Wendy’s has recently introduced new items such as flatbread
sandwiches, as well as a mid-tier priced menu, to attract
American consumers. The company is also remodeling restaurants
with a more upscale look that includes fireplaces and booth
seating. The Dublin, Ohio-based company’s  shares  have advanced
21 percent this year, compared with a 12 percent gain for the
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index. The shares rose 1.8 percent to
$5.67 yesterday in  New York .  At the end of last year, there were 6,186 Wendy’s stores in
North America, of which 77 percent were franchised.  To contact the reporter on this story:
