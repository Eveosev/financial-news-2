Arabtec Holding PJSC (ARTC)  climbed to the
highest in a month on investor bets the shares of the  Persian
Gulf ’s largest publicly traded builder are cheap compared with
Dubai-based real estate developers.  The stock gained 2.3 percent to 2.20 dirhams, poised for
the highest close since March 3, at 1:18 p.m. in Dubai, trimming
this year’s drop to 1.8 percent. About 28 million shares traded,
or 80 percent more than the three-month daily average, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg. Arabtec was the second most-
actively traded stock on Dubai’s benchmark  index , which rose 0.8
percent. The measure has surged 21 percent this year.  United Arab Emirates construction projects are picking up,
with Arabtec winning contracts to build a branch of the Louvre
and an airport terminal in  Abu Dhabi . The company, which last
month said it has a “strong” backlog of 22 billion dirhams ($6
billion), trades at an estimated price-to-earnings multiple of
about 12. That compares with 15 times for Dubai-based  Emaar
Properties PJSC (EMAAR) , whose shares have surged 43 percent this year.  Arabtec’s stock “has been a lagger in comparison to the
market and it’s trading at attractive valuation,” said Marwan Shurrab, vice-president at Dubai-based Gulfmena Investments Ltd.  Nine analysts  recommend  investors sell the shares of
Arabtec, while three have a hold rating on the stock, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporters on this story:
