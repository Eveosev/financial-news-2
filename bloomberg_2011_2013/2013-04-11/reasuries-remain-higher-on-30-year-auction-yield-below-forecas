Treasuries remained higher after
the U.S. sale of $13 billion in 30-year bonds produced a lower-
than-forecast yield.  The notes drew a yield of 2.998 percent, compared with a
forecast of 3.001 percent in a Bloomberg News survey of seven of
the  Federal Reserve ’s primary dealers. The bid-to-cover ratio,
which gauges demand by comparing total bids with the amount of
securities offered, was 2.49, versus a 2.59 average for the
previous 10 sales. Treasuries rose earlier as the  U.S. economy 
shows signs of slowing, boosting the case for the Fed to
continue its quantitative-easing program of asset purchases.  “It’s an average auction,” said Tom Tucci, managing
director and head of Treasury trading in New York at CIBC World
Markets Corp. “People were hoping there would be a strong
international bid in the long end of the market. It’s just too
early.”  The  yield  on the current 30-year note fell one basis point,
or 0.01 percentage point, to 3 percent, at 1:19 p.m. in  New
York , according to Bloomberg Bond Trader prices. Benchmark 10-
year yields fell one basis point to 1.79 percent.  Indirect bidders , an investor class that includes foreign
central banks, purchased 31.4 percent of the notes, the lowest
since October, compared with an average of 36.7 percent for the
past 10 sales.  Bid Data  Direct bidders , non-primary-dealer investors that place
their bids directly with the Treasury, purchased 19.2 percent of
the notes, the highest level since December, compared with a
more than three-year low of 4.9 percent in March and an average
of 14.7 percent at the last 10 auctions.  Thirty-year bonds have lost 0.9 percent this year, compared
with a 0.2 percent gain in the broader U.S. Treasuries market,
according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch indexes.  The U.S. sold $21 billion of  10-year debt  yesterday at a
yield of 1.795 percent and auctioned $32 billion of  three-year
notes  on April 9 at a yield of 0.342 percent.  The sales will raise $6.7 billion of new cash, as maturing
securities held by the public total $59.3 billion, according to
the Treasury.  Primary dealers trade  government securities  with the Fed
and are obliged to participate in Treasury sales.  To contact the reporters on this story:
