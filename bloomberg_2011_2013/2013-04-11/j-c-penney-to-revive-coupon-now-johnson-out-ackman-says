J.C. Penney Co. (JCP)  will reverse  Ron
Johnson ’s strategy of reducing discounts and put coupon
advertising in newspapers again, said  William Ackman , the
activist investor who recruited the ousted chief executive.  Johnson, who was replaced by Myron E. Ullman III on April
8, implemented a pricing strategy that eliminated almost all of
the company’s discounts and promotions in favor of everyday low
prices. Shoppers shunned the department store chain, and sales
sank 25 percent last year.  Ackman, speaking today at a real estate conference in New
York, also said Johnson’s physical absence from the company’s
headquarters in Plano, Texas, undermined his overhaul of the
department-store chain. Johnson, along with other former Apple
Inc. executives he hired, commuted to J.C. Penney from
California and New York. Johnson’s plan, which Ackman today
continued to call the “right vision” for the company, led to a
net loss of $985 million last year.  Management also needs to “calm the vendors,” said Ackman,
whose Pershing Square Capital Management LP is J.C. Penney’s
largest investor. The company has delayed payments to suppliers,
UBS AG analyst Michael Binetti said in a note on April 9.  J.C. Penney rose 5.5 percent to $14.86 at the close in  New
York . At that price, the Plano, Texas-based company’s shares
have declined 6.4 percent since the CEO change was announced.  To contact the reporter on this story:
