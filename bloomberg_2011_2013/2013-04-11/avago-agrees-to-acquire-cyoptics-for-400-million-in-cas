Avago Technologies Ltd. (AVGO) , a supplier
of components for wireless communications, agreed to acquire
optical-chip maker  CyOptics Inc. (CYOP)  for about $400 million in cash.  The transaction is expected to close during Avago’s fiscal
third quarter, which ends in July, the companies said today in a
statement.  Avago, with headquarters in Singapore, is using the deal to
expand in fiber optics and supply more components for corporate
data centers.  CyOptics , based in Breinigsville,  Pennsylvania ,
increased net sales by 21 percent to $210 million last year,
according to the statement.  CyOptics offers “interesting revenue growth opportunities
in delivering a broad range of proprietary components to the
market,”Avago Chief Executive Officer Hock Tan said in the
statement.  CyOptics abandoned plans for an initial public offering in
May, the company said in a regulatory filing at the time.  Avago’s shares fell less than 1 percent to $35.17 at 9:31
a.m. in New York. Through yesterday, the stock had advanced 12
percent this year, about the same gain as the Russell 1000
Index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
