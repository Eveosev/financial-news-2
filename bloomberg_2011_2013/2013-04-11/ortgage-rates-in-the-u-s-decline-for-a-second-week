Mortgage rates in the U.S. fell for
a second week, reducing borrowing costs as more homeowners seek
to refinance into less expensive loans.  The average rate for a 30-year fixed mortgage was 3.43
percent in the week ended today, down from 3.54 percent, McLean,
Virginia-based  Freddie Mac (FMCC)  said in a statement. The average 15-
year rate dropped to 2.65 percent from 2.74 percent.  More borrowers are taking advantage of rates near record
lows to reduce their monthly payments. The Mortgage Bankers
Association’s index of  refinance  applications rose 6.3 percent
in the week ended April 5. The  purchase  gauge fell 1.3 percent,
the Washington-based group said yesterday.  “The near record-low mortgage rates are very important for
refinancing, but less so for home purchase,” Jed Kolko, chief
economist for San Francisco-based  Trulia Inc. (TRLA) , a San Francisco-
based online real estate information service, said yesterday in
a telephone interview. “Refinances are very sensitive to
mortgage rates.”  An increase in rates may actually prompt more purchases
because buyers would be concerned about losing out on low
financing costs, Kolko said.  The average 30-year mortgage rate dropped to a record 3.31
percent in November, according to Freddie Mac. The 15-year rate
fell to 2.63 percent, also the lowest on record.  To contact the reporter on this story:
