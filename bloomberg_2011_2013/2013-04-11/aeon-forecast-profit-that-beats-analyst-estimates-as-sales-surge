Aeon Co. (8267) ,  Japan ’s largest retailer,
forecast annual profit that beat analyst estimates after
reporting the fastest sales growth since 2007.  Net income will  probably rise  to 75 billion yen ($752
million) for the year ending February 2014, the company said in
a statement today. That’s higher than the 71.9 billion yen
average of 13 analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Sales
jumped 8.8 percent to 5.69 trillion yen last fiscal year,
according to the statement.  The operator of shopping malls, supermarkets and specialty
retailers is adding stores while promoting sales of its in-house
brand as it targets a gain in sales to a record this fiscal
year. The company agreed last month to buy  Daiei Inc. (8263) , formerly
the nation’s biggest retailer, to add more outlets in
metropolitan areas.  Net income rose 12 percent to 74.7 billion yen last fiscal
year, compared with 66.8 billion yen a year earlier, according
to the statement. Sales will probably increase 5.5 percent to a
record 6 trillion yen this fiscal year, the company said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
