Allstate Corp. (ALL) , the largest
publicly traded U.S. auto and home insurer, had its credit
outlook changed to “stable” from “negative” by Moody’s
Investors Service on improved underwriting results.  “Underwriting profitability will continue to benefit from
underwriting efforts over the last two years including high
single-digit countrywide rate increases and non-renewal of less
profitable business, particularly in the homeowners’ line,”
Moody’s said today in a statement about Northbrook, Illinois-
based Allstate.  To contact the reporter on this story:
