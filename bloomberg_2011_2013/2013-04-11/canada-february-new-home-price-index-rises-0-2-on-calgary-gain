Saskatchewan, rose 1.4 percent.  From a year earlier, new home prices increased rose 2.1
percent in February, slower than January’s 2.2 percent rate.  Economists predicted the index would advance by 0.1 percent
on the month and 2.1 percent from a year earlier, according to
the median estimates in a Bloomberg  survey .  The Bank of Canada predicts housing investment will be a
drag on economic growth this year and next. Governor  Mark Carney
