The  International Monetary Fund  lowered its forecast for U.S. growth as automatic budget cuts slow the expansion, according to a draft of the Washington-based lender’s World Economic Outlook.  U.S. gross domestic product will expand 1.7 percent this year compared with a previously forecast 2 percent advance, according to the draft report obtained by  Bloomberg News . The draft, which was presented to the IMF board last week, may be subject to revisions before its scheduled April 16 release.  The U.S.’s fiscal tightening that took effect last month will restrain consumption temporarily, the report said. The global economy will expand 3.4 percent this year, compared with 3.5 percent forecast in January, according to projections in the report. The 17-nation euro area will contract 0.2 percent, unchanged from January, with uncertainty stemming from Italy’s election adding to challenges facing policy makers fighting Europe’s debt crisis, it said.  “The road to recovery in the advanced economies will remain bumpy,” the draft report said. “The weak ending to economic activity in 2012 and the sluggish beginning in 2013 highlight that important brakes remain in place.”  IMF spokeswoman  Conny Lotze , in an e-mail reply to a question about the draft, declined to comment.  The report said that two of the biggest threats to the global economy -- a euro-area break-up and a sharp fiscal contraction in the U.S. -- have been “successfully defused” over the past six months.  Japan’s Prospects  In Japan, the pace of growth this year is forecast to reach 1.5 percent, up from the IMF’s outlook in January for a 1.2 percent expansion, the draft report shows.

Meanwhile, growth in  emerging markets , especially smaller countries, is picking up steam, according to the draft report. That should help prop up global growth next year, which the IMF sees rising to 4.1 percent, unchanged from its January forecast.  While most developing economies, especially in  Asia  and sub-Saharan Africa, are experiencing faster growth as demand from rich nations strengthens, a few economies in  Latin America  are “slipping into crisis-like conditions,” the IMF said.
