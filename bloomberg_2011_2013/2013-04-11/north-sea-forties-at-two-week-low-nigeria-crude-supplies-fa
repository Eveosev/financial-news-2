North Sea Forties crude fell to its
lowest level in two weeks as Vitol Group sold its ninth cargo
since March 28.  Crude supplies in  Nigeria  fell by 50,000 barrels a day to
1.95 million barrels, the fewest in four months, the
 International Energy Agency  said today in its monthly report.  North Sea  Vitol sold the Forties cargo to Total SA for loading April
27 to April 29 at 60 cents less than Dated Brent, according to a
Bloomberg survey of traders and brokers monitoring the Platts
pricing window. That was 25 cents lower than yesterday’s trade
and the biggest discount since March 28, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. Total has bought eight of the nine
consignments that Vitol has sold.  Reported crude trading typically occurs during the Platts
window, which ends at 4:30 p.m.  London  time. Forties loading in
10 to 25 days widened by 6 cents to a discount of 32 cents a
barrel to Dated Brent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Brent futures for May settlement traded at $104.74 a barrel
on the ICE Futures  Europe  exchange in London at the close of the
window, compared with $105.65 yesterday. The June contract was
$104.86 at the same time today, a premium of 12 cents to May.  Exports of  North Sea  Foinaven crude will be two cargoes in
May, unchanged from this month, according to a loading program
obtained by  Bloomberg News .  Mediterranean/Urals  There were no bids or offers for Russian Urals crude for a
second day, the survey of brokers monitoring Platts showed.  The Urals discount to Dated Brent in the Mediterranean
narrowed by 2 cents to 64 cents a barrel, data compiled by
Bloomberg show. That was the least since Feb. 1. In northwest
Europe, the  discount  was at $2.08 a barrel versus $2.06 at
yesterday’s close.  West Africa  Benchmark Nigerian Qua Iboe blend dropped 2 cents to $3.43
a barrel more than Dated Brent, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA) ’s plan to close the Nembe Creek
pipeline this month for maintenance may affect as much as
150,000 barrels a day of Bonny and Forcados production, the IEA
said. The loading programs for Nigerian and Angolan crude for
June are due to be published next week.  To contact the reporter on this story:
