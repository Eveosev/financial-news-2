Level 3 Communications Inc. (LVLT) , an
operator of global fiber-optic network, promoted Chief Operating
Officer Jeff Storey to the top job, filling a role vacated by
longtime Chief Executive Officer Jim Crowe.  Storey will take the CEO position immediately, the
Broomfield, Colorado-based company said in a statement. Crowe
announced his intention last month to step down by the end of
the year. Storey also was nominated to take Crowe’s board seat.  “Jeff was the clear and unanimous choice of the board,”
Chairman Walter Scott said in the statement. “With 30 years of
industry experience and his intimate knowledge of Level 3’s
customers, employees and operating environment, Jeff is the
right executive to lead Level 3 into the future.”  Crowe led Level 3 from its days as a startup in 1998, when
the company set out to create a massive communications network
with 19,600 route miles. The Internet bust in 2000 took a
devastating toll on Level 3, and it posted more than $12 billion
in losses during the first decade of the 2000s. The stock also
lost 99 percent of its value.   Now the company is trying to capitalize on the growth of
video traffic and other bandwidth-heavy Internet activities in a
bid to return to profitability. Analysts estimate that the
company will be around the break-even point this year and post a
profit in 2014, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  “I look forward to building on this vision and leading our
company into the next phase of profitable revenue growth,”
Storey said today in the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
