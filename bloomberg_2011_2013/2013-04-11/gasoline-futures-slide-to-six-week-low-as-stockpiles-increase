Gasoline sank to the lowest level
since February and crack spreads narrowed as refineries returned
from maintenance, boosting inventories.  Prices fell a day after the Energy Information
Administration said gasoline supplies and refinery inputs rose
last week. Motiva Enterprises LLC is starting a crude unit at
 Port Arthur ,  Texas . Chevron Corp. has state approval to start a
crude unit at the Richmond, California, plant that’s been shut
since August.  “There’s going to be continued pressure on products as
refiners return from maintenance,” said  Andy Lipow , president
of Lipow Oil Associates LLC in Houston. “I expect the Chevron
Richmond crude unit to come back online soon.”  Gasoline for May delivery fell 1.96 cents, or 0.7 percent,
