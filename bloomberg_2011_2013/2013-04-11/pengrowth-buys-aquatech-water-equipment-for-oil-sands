Pengrowth Energy Corp. (PGF)  hired
Aquatech International Corp., a Pennsylvania-based water
engineering specialist, to design and build a treatment system
for the Canadian company’s oil sands project in northern
 Alberta .  Aquatech’s equipment and engineering will help Pengrowth
treat water used to extract bitumen as part of a process that
injects steam underground, the company said. No financial
details were provided in today’s statement.  Pengrowth and other oil sands operators are working to
reduce the amount of steam used for bitumen extraction. The
steam is typically generated using natural gas-powered boilers
and brackish water from saline aquifers, according to the
Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers.  To contact the reporter on this story:
