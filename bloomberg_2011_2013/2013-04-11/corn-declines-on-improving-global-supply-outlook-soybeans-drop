Corn dropped after the  U.S.
Department of Agriculture  raised its estimate for world
inventories. Soybeans declined as  Wilmar International Ltd. (WIL)  said
that China’s imports will fall as bird flu curbs feed demand.  The grain for delivery in July, which has the largest open
interest, lost as much as 0.5 percent to $6.295 a bushel on the
Chicago Board of Trade and was at $6.2975 at 10:22 a.m. in
 Singapore . Soybeans for May delivery lost 0.6 percent to $13.845
a bushel in Chicago.  Inventories of corn around the world will be 125.29 million
metric tons, up from 117.48 million tons predicted a month ago,
boosted by higher  stockpiles  in the U.S., the USDA said
yesterday. Analysts surveyed by Bloomberg had expected 120.41
million, on average. The stockpiles are down from 131.88 million
tons a year earlier.  “We’ll probably trade relatively flat to slightly
bearish,”  Graydon Chong, a grains and oilseeds analyst at
Rabobank International, said by phone from Sydney today.  China , the world’s largest soybean buyer, will probably
 import  less this year as the outbreak of bird flu curbs demand
for poultry, a Wilmar executive said. That would be the first
decline since 2004, according to USDA data.  Wilmar’s forecast may help push prices lower, Hiroyuki Kikukawa, general manager for research at Tokyo-based Nihon
Unicom Inc., said in an e-mail. China’s imports will account for
64 percent of this year’s world shipments, according to the USDA.  Global  inventories  of the oilseed at the end of this
marketing year will be 62.63 million tons, up from 60.21 million
forecast in March, the USDA said, as it kept its stockpile
estimate for the U.S. unchanged. Analysts expected 60.1 million
tons, on average. A year earlier, supplies totaled 55.13 million.  Wheat for delivery in July was little changed at $7.0325 a
bushel in  Chicago  after rising as much as 0.5 percent to $7.065.
The price touched $6.9375 yesterday, the lowest since April 5.  To contact the reporter on this story:
