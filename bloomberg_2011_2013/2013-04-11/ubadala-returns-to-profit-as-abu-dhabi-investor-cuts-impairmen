Mubadala Development Co., the  Abu
Dhabi  fund with stakes in  General Electric Co. (GE)  and  Carlyle
Group , returned to profit as impairments declined and the value
of investments improved.  Profit attributable to the owner of the group was 455
million dirhams ($124 million) last year after a loss of 3.2
billion dirhams in 2011, Mubadala said in a statement today.
Loss from financial investments dropped to 1.43 billion dirhams
from 3.03 billion dirhams, while revenue climbed 12 percent to
31 billion dirhams.  Mubadala, rated AA at Standard & Poor’s and Fitch Ratings
Ltd., is investing in technology, health care and aerospace to
acquire technical expertise and boost employment in Abu Dhabi.
The capital of the United Arab Emirates, which holds about 6
percent of the world’s proven oil reserves, is seeking to
diversify from its reliance on crude exports.  Mubadala is interested in investing in Vale SA’s halted
$5.9 billion potash project in  Argentina , Carlos Molina, head of
mining for Mendoza province, said on March 11. The company
invested $2 billion in  Eike Batista ’s EBX Group Co. last year.  Mubadala will “continue to seek out new regional and
international opportunities to help realize Abu Dhabi’s ambition
of a diversified, globally integrated and innovation driven
economy,” the company said in the statement. Total assets rose
to 203 billion dirhams from 177 billion dirhams mainly due the
increase in property and loan portfolio, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
