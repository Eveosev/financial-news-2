The cost of goods imported into the
U.S. fell in March as fuel prices retreated.  The 0.5 percent drop in the import-price index followed a
0.6 percent gain the prior month that was smaller than first
estimated, the Labor Department reported today in Washington.
The decline matched the median forecast of 41 economists in a
Bloomberg survey. Prices dropped 2.7 percent over the past 12
months, the biggest year-to-year fall since July.  Europe  and other global markets remain weak, limiting
demand for commodities including oil and keeping overall
inflation in check. American companies also have little ability
to raise prices as they compete with overseas manufacturers to
attract customers.  Economists’ estimates for import prices in the Bloomberg
survey ranged from a drop of 1.8 percent to a 0.9 percent gain.  Applications for  unemployment benefits  in the U.S. plunged
more than forecast last week unwinding a surge caused by the
Easter holiday and spring break at schools, another Labor
Department report showed today.  Jobless claims decreased by 42,000 to 346,000 in the week
ended April 6, from a revised 388,000, Labor Department figures
showed today in Washington. The  median  forecast of 49 economists
surveyed by Bloomberg called for a drop to 360,000. A Labor
Department official said no states were estimated and there was
nothing unusual in the data.  Petroleum Costs  The cost of imported petroleum decreased 1.9 percent in
March from the prior month, and was down 10.4 percent over the
past 12 months.  Excluding fuels, import prices fell 0.2 percent in March,
and were down 0.5 percent from March 2012. That was the largest
12-month drop since November 2009.  The value of imported automobiles fell 0.3 percent from
the prior month, the most since December 2011.  The cost of goods from  China  declined 0.2 percent in March,
and was down 1.1 percent over the past 12 months. It was the
largest year-to-year drop since February 2010. Goods from  Japan 
fell 0.2 percent over the past 12 months, the most since
November 2007.  U.S. export prices decreased 0.4 percent after advancing
0.7 percent the previous month, today’s figures showed. Prices
of farm exports fell 1.8 percent, while those of non-farm goods
were down 0.2 percent.  The import-price index is the first of three monthly price
gauges from the Labor Department. Producer prices are due
tomorrow, and the consumer-price index on April 16.  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
