Bayerische Motoren Werke AG (BMW) , the
world’s biggest maker of luxury cars, said its success amid
 Europe ’s auto-market contraction shows the importance of setting
up production and sales that can weather an economic crisis.  “Instead of making forecasts that don’t materialize after
all, companies should create robust systems that get stronger,
not weaker through chance, change and stress,” Chief Executive
Officer  Norbert Reithofer  said today in the text of a speech at
a conference in Stuttgart,  Germany .  “I view our strategy as such a robust, anti-fragile
system,” Reithofer said at the conference hosted by Auto, Motor
& Sport magazine. “It led us through the time of economic
crisis and laid the basis for our current success.”  BMW overtook Italian volume producer  Fiat SpA (F)  as Europe’s
sixth-largest carmaker in 2012 as the region’s market shrank for
a fifth consecutive year. The Munich-based carmaker has a labor
agreement at its German plants allowing it to react quickly to
shifts in demand for vehicles.  The company widened its luxury-auto sales lead over Audi AG
last month as it won customers with the 3-Series sedan and X1
sport-utility vehicle.  Reithofer also said German industry leaders need to
overcome reservations about electric vehicles and take a more
active role in preparing for eventual growth in demand for
battery powered and plug-in hybrid cars.  To contact the reporter on this story:
