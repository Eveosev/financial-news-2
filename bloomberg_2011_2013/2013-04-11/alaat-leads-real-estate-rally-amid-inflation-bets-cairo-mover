Talaat Moustafa Group Holding led
surging Egyptian real estate shares as investors anticipate
inflation will increase demand for properties.  Egypt’s biggest publicly traded property developer headed
for the biggest gain in six months, extending April’s rally to
11 percent.  Palm Hills Developments SAE (PHDC)  was poised for the
highest close in more than a month. The benchmark  EGX 30 Index (EGX30) 
advanced 1.5 percent to 5,228 as of 12:23 p.m. in Cairo.  The rally in property shares is driven by “inflation-hedge
plays which could trickle in improved earnings and also genuine
demand for real-estate companies in Egypt,” said Teymour El- Derini, Cairo-based director of  Middle East  and North Africa
sales trading at Naeem Brokerage.  The  EGX 30 Real Estate Index (EGXREAL)  is up 8.7 percent this month,
compared with a 2.5 percent gain for the benchmark gauge. While
inflation eased in March for the first time this year,
economists at investment banks EFG-Hermes Holding SAE and CI
Capital forecast prices will climb further amid a  currency
devaluation . The pound has weakened more than 7 percent this
year as Egypt’s foreign-currency reserves tumble.  Talaat Moustafa rose 5.4 percent to 4.1 Egyptian pounds.
Palm Hills increased 6 percent to 2.13 pounds. Trading volume of
both shares exceeded their three-month daily averages.
 Heliopolis Housing (HELI)  ans  Six of October Development & Investment 
Co. gained 4.6 percent and 2.7 percent, respectively.  To contact the reporter on this story:
