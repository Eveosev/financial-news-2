West Texas Intermediate crude fell
for the first time in four days as the International Energy
Agency trimmed forecasts for global oil demand. Brent’s premium
to WTI shrank to the smallest level in 14 months.  Futures tumbled 1.2 percent as the IEA predicted the
weakest fuel use in Europe since the 1980s. U.S. supply
increased to a 22-year high last week, the Energy Information
Administration said yesterday. Brent oil’s premium to WTI shrank
below $11 as the European benchmark slumped more than WTI.  “People are disappointed that the IEA revised down its
numbers,” said  Harry Tchilinguirian , BNP Paribas SA’s London-
based head of commodity markets strategy. “We are reversing
some of the gains that we had in the last three consecutive
sessions. The Brent-WTI spread has gone too far too soon.”  WTI for May delivery dropped $1.13 to settle at $93.51 a
barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. The volume of all
futures traded was 7.2 percent lower than the 100-day average
for the time of day at 3:33 p.m. The contract rose to $94.64
yesterday, the highest settlement since April 2.  Brent for May settlement slid $1.52, or 1.4 percent, to end
the session at $104.27 a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures
 Europe  exchange. Volume was 21 percent above the 100-day average
for the time of day.  The European benchmark grade’s premium to WTI shrank to as
little as $10.76, the narrowest level since Jan. 25, 2012. Brent
has slumped 6.2 percent this year, and WTI is up 1.8 percent.  Brent-WTI Spread  “A big part of this move has been driven by Brent,”
Tchilinguirian said. “The likelihood is that we’ll see some
rewinding of the spread.”  Worldwide consumption of oil will increase by 795,000
barrels a day, or 0.9 percent, to average 90.58 million barrels
a day this year, according to the  IEA , the Paris-based adviser
to 28 industrialized nations. That’s 45,000 barrels a day fewer
than it forecast last month.  The outlook for global oil demand “remains subdued,” the
IEA said in its April monthly report as it cut the forecast for
a third month. “At the same time, crude supply risk remains
elevated.”  European demand will slump by 340,000 barrels a day to 14.1
million. The  European debt crisis  which began in  Greece  three
years ago has reduced economic growth and fuel demand as it
spread to Ireland,  Portugal ,  Italy , Spain and Cyprus.  U.S. consumption will be 18.58 million, down from last
year’s 18.61 million, the IEA said.  Global Consumption  “The IEA cut its global oil-demand forecast and it’s kind
of weighing on the market,” said  Gene McGillian , an analyst and
broker at Tradition Energy in  Stamford ,  Connecticut . “The
fundamental picture is weak, especially here in the United
States.”  The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and the
EIA also cut their 2013 estimates this week.  Global consumption will rise by 800,000 barrels a day this
year, less than the 840,000 estimated last month, OPEC said in
its Monthly Oil Market Report yesterday. The EIA said on April 9
that demand from countries in the  Organization for Economic
Cooperation and Development  will average 45.57 million barrels a
day this year, 70,000 barrels less than the March forecast.  “People are worried about the weaker demand and high
inventories, and it’s causing a bit of a pullback,” said
Michael Lynch, president of Strategic Energy & Economic Research
in Winchester,  Massachusetts . “It’s hard to see if demand is
going to recover enough to offset the very high levels of crude
inventories.”  Saudi Forecast  Saudi Arabia, OPEC’s largest producer, is more bullish in
its demand forecasts than the international organizations. The
kingdom expects world consumption to rise about 1 million
barrels a day this year and exceed 90 million “for the first
time in history,” Ibrahim al-Muhanna, an adviser to Saudi Oil
Minister  Ali al-Naimi , said yesterday in Kuwait.  U.S. crude stockpiles increased by  250,000 barrels  last
week, up for the 12th time this year, to 388.9 million, the most
since July 1990, the EIA, the Energy Department’s statistical
arm, reported. Domestic  production  gained 30,000 barrels to 7.18
million barrels a day, the fastest rate since July 1992.  Total petroleum demand fell 845,000 barrels a day to 18.1
million, the biggest drop since Jan. 4, the EIA said.  Citigroup ‘Bearish’  Citigroup Inc. (C)  said today that downward pressures on crude
prices have grown. The bank is “moderately bearish” on oil
prices this year because the IEA and other organizations have
lowered their forecasts, Seth Kleinman, the bank’s head of
energy strategy, said at the Bloomberg Oil Forum in  London 
today.  Implied volatility for at-the-money WTI crude options
expiring in June was 19.7 percent, up from 19 percent yesterday.
The figure has slipped from 24.7 percent on Feb. 21.  Electronic trading volume on the Nymex was 418,818
contracts as of 3:33 p.m. It totaled 526,133 contracts
yesterday, 9.4 percent below the three-month average. Open
interest was 1.77 million contracts.  To contact the reporter on this story:
