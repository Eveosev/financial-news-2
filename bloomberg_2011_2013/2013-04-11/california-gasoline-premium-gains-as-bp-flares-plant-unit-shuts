Spot gasoline in  California 
advanced against futures as  BP Plc (BP/) ’s Carson refinery, the
second-largest in the state, scheduled flaring and  Phillips 66 (PSX) ’s
Rodeo plant reported an unplanned unit shutdown.  The 266,000-barrel-a-day Carson refinery plans to flare
gases from April 14 through April 22, the London-based company
said in a notice to the  South Coast Air Quality Management
District . The plant was scheduled to work this month on an
isomerization unit, a jet treater, the No. 1 reformer and the
mid-barrel unit, a person familiar with the plans said March 28.  Phillips 66’s 76,000-barrel-a-day Rodeo refinery flared
gases for six hours after a unit shut, the company said in a
notice to Contra Costa County regulators yesterday.  Rich Johnson , a Phillips spokesman in Houston, declined to comment on
the filing.  California-blend gasoline, or Carbob, in San Francisco rose
to a six-month high against futures traded on the  New York 
Mercantile Exchange, gaining 6 cents to a premium of 15.5 cents
a gallon, data compiled by Bloomberg show. Prompt-delivery
jumped 2.59 cents to $2.9860 a gallon.  Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA) ’s Martinez refinery was said to shut
units last week for about a month of planned maintenance, and
 Chevron Corp. (CVX) ’s 240,000-barrel-a-day Richmond refinery has been
producing fuel at about half its capacity since an Aug. 6 fire
damaged its crude unit.  L.A. Carbob  Carbob in Los Angeles advanced 1.5 cents against futures to
a premium of 9 cents a gallon, the highest level since February.
The  premium  for Carbob in San Francisco versus the fuel in  Los
Angeles  widened 4.5 cents to 6.5 cents a gallon, the biggest
differential in two weeks.  California-blend diesel in San Francisco jumped 3.5 cents
against ultra-low-sulfur diesel futures on the Nymex to a
premium of 10.5 cents a gallon. Diesel in Los Angeles slipped
0.75 cent to 4.25 cents a gallon above futures.  In  Portland ,  Oregon ,  low-sulfur diesel  was unchanged at 11
cents above versus ULSD futures. Gasoline there slipped 1 cent
to a premium of 4 cents a gallon versus gasoline futures.  The  3-2-1 crack spread  of Alaska North Slope crude, Carbob
in Los Angeles and CARB diesel in Los Angeles dropped 19 cents
to $16.21 a barrel. The spread, a rough indicator of refinery
margins, is down 44 percent from this year’s high of $29.09 a
barrel on Feb. 5.  To contact the reporter on this story:
