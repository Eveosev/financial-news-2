Rutgers University has appointed
former New Jersey Attorney General John J. Farmer Jr. senior
vice president and general counsel in the wake of a scandal over
the handling of an abusive basketball coach.  Farmer, who served as the state attorney general from 1999
to 2002, has been dean of Rutgers's law school in  Newark  since
July 2009, Rutgers said today in a  statement  on its website.  He replaces John Wolf, who resigned amid reports that he
advised Rutgers to suspend and not fire Mike Rice after video
emerged of the coach verbally and physically abusing players.  “I am pleased that John Farmer, our outstanding dean, will
assume his new responsibilities as senior vice president and
general counsel,” university President Robert Barchi said in
the statement. “John’s legal expertise and deep experience at
many levels of leadership will serve Rutgers well at a critical
time for the university.”  Rutgers, which has its largest campus in New Brunswick, has
been embroiled in controversy since it was revealed last week
that the president opted to suspend the basketball coach last
year amid the abuse allegations. Barchi fired Rice last week
after video was leaked. Since then, at least three university
officials have  resigned , including Wolf and Tim Pernetti, the
athletic director, and assistant basketball coach Jimmy
Martelli.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
