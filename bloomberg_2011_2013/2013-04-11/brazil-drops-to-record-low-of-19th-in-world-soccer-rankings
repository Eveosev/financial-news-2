Five-time world champion  Brazil 
dropped to a 20-year low in the national soccer team rankings,
a year before it hosts the World Cup.  The Brazilian team, whose star player is Santos forward
Neymar,  fell one place to 19th , its lowest spot since ruling
body FIFA began the rankings in 1993.  Brazil, which ended a five-game winless streak by beating
Bolivia 4-0 on April 6, is ranked below Switzerland and Belgium.
The Brazilians also drew with Italy and  Russia  over the past
month.  World and European champion Spain is No. 1 for the 20th
consecutive month, ahead of Germany and Argentina.  Luiz Felipe Scolari returned as Brazil coach in November,
replacing Mano Menezes. Scolari revived Brazil from a slump of
six defeats in 18 matches in 2002 World Cup qualifying to lead
it to its most recent title.  The team is playing a series of exhibition matches, billed
as the Brazil World Tour, to prepare for next year’s World Cup,
which it doesn’t have to qualify for.  To contact the reporters on this story:
