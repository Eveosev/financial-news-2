Lebanon plans to sell overseas
dollar bonds for the first time in 2013 during the busiest week
for emerging-market issuers this year.  The most-indebted Arab country plans to sell $600 million
of bonds due in 2023 to yield 6.15 percent and $500 million in
securities maturing in 2027 at 6.70 percent, according to a
person with knowledge of the offering who asked not to be
identified because terms aren’t set. Middle Eastern dollar bonds
yield  5.72 percent  on average, according to data compiled by
JPMorgan Chase & Co.  Lebanon is joining countries from  Mexico  to  Indonesia  to
sell debt abroad this week and take advantage of a drop in
borrowing costs. This is the busiest week in 2013 for emerging-
market issuers, with more than $17.9 billion sold worldwide,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The expected borrowing costs for Lebanon, whose  Standard &
Poor’s  B rating is five levels below investment grade, compare
with an average 6.90 percent for similarly ranked Ukraine. The
European country sold $1.25 billion of 10-year dollar bonds on
April 9 with a yield of 7.50 percent, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg.  The extra yield investors demand to own Lebanese bonds
instead of Treasuries widened 1 basis point, or 0.01 percentage
point, to 434 points at 2:21 p.m. in  New York , according to
JPMorgan’s EMBIG index.  In November, Lebanon sold $525 million of bonds in a
reopening of its 2018 dollar securities. The  Finance Ministry 
said April 9 that the country plans to issue as much as $1.5
billion of bonds in exchange for local-currency debt with the
central bank.  The resignation of Prime Minister  Najib Mikati  on March 22
deepens the political divide in Lebanon and is a “credit
negative” for the country, Mathias Angonin, an associate
analyst at Moody’s Investors Service, wrote in a March 26 note.
It rates the country B1, four grades below investment grade.  To contact the reporter on this story:
