Ethanol’s discount to gasoline
narrowed to the smallest level in 12 weeks with production of
the additive below year-earlier levels and stockpiles of the
motor fuel advancing.  The spread, or price difference, shrank 6.18 cents to 38.03
cents a gallon at 10:50 a.m.  New York  time, the narrowest since
Jan. 16. Yesterday the Energy Information Administration
reported ethanol  production  last week was 4.7 percent below last
year’s level and gasoline supplies rose 0.8 percent.  “We’ve got easily probably another billion gallons of
capacity that can come online,” said  Chris Wilson , an analyst
at Atten Babler Risk Management LLC in Galena,  Illinois .  Denatured ethanol for May delivery  advanced 3.4 cents, or
1.4 percent, to $2.457 a gallon on the Chicago Board of Trade.
Prices have gained 12 percent this year.  Gasoline for May delivery decreased 2.78 cents, or 1
percent, to $2.8373 a gallon on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange . The contract covers reformulated gasoline, made to be
blended with ethanol before delivery to filling stations.  Ethanol plunged 3 percent after the EIA report showed
production jumped 5.8 percent to 854,000 barrels a day, the
highest since June 29 and the biggest weekly gain since the week
ended Dec. 3, 2010.  Returns to make the fuel have rebounded because of rising
estimates of corn stockpiles, after prices for the grain reached
a record in the wake of the worst U.S. drought since the 1930s.  Corn Forecast  The Agriculture Department forecast yesterday that
inventories on Aug. 31 will be 757 million bushels, up from 632
million forecast in March.  Corn for May delivery rose 8.5 cents, or 1.3 percent, to
$6.575 a bushel in  Chicago . One bushel makes at least 2.75
gallons of ethanol.  The corn crush spread, representing gains or losses from
turning corn into ethanol and based on May contracts, was 7
cents a gallon, up from 6 cents yesterday and up from minus 35
cents at the end of 2012. The amount doesn’t include revenue
from the sale of dried distillers’ grains, a byproduct of
ethanol production, which can be fed to livestock.  To contact the reporter on this story:
