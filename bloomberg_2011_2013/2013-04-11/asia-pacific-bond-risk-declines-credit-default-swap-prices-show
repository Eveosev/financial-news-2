The cost of insuring corporate and
sovereign bonds in the Asia-Pacific region against non-payment
dropped, according to traders of credit-default swaps.  The Markit iTraxx Asia index of 40 investment-grade
borrowers outside  Japan  fell 2 basis points to 116 basis points
as of 8:25 a.m. in  Hong Kong , Australia & New Zealand Banking
Group Ltd. prices show. The gauge is set for its lowest close
since before the current series began trading on March 20,
according to data provider CMA.  The Markit iTraxx Australia index slid 3 basis points to
111.5 as of 10:17 a.m. in Sydney, according to Westpac Banking
Corp. prices. The benchmark is poised for its biggest daily
decline since April 2, based on data from CMA, which is owned by
McGraw-Hill Cos. and compiles prices quoted by dealers in the
private market.  The Markit iTraxx Japan index dropped 3.5 to 90.5 as of
9:31 a.m. in  Tokyo , according to Citigroup Inc. prices. The
measure was last lower in November 2010, CMA data show.  Credit-default swap indexes are benchmarks for insuring
bonds against default and traders use them to speculate on
 credit quality . A drop signals improving perceptions of
creditworthiness, while an increase suggests the opposite.  The swap contracts pay the buyer face value in exchange for
the underlying securities if a borrower fails to meet its debt
agreements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
