Hudson’s Bay Co. (HBC) , Canada’s oldest
company, fell to its lowest since it went public in November
after the company said “unusual weather patterns” led to lower
than expected results in the first quarter.  The retailer  dropped  1.7 percent to C$14.50 a share at
10:57 a.m. today in Toronto, where the company is based. Earlier
it fell 5.1 percent to C$14.00, the lowest since it began
trading on November 21.  “While we are pleased with how our initiatives are
progressing, there have been challenges,” Chief Executive
Officer  Richard Baker  said in a statement. “During the first
quarter of this fiscal year, unusual weather patterns have led
to weaker that anticipated results, particularly at Lord &
Taylor.”  Hudson’s Bay said sales were affected earlier in the year
by  Hurricane Sandy  which forced it to temporarily close the
majority of its Lord & Taylor stores. Same-store sales at its
U.S. department stores declined 2.9 percent for the 14-week
period ended Feb.2, 2013.  HBC reported earnings of 86 cents a share, adjusted for
certain items, more than the 85 cent average  estimate  of eight
analysts surveyed by  Bloomberg News . Sales of C$1.39 billion,
beat the C$1.36 billion estimate in the survey.  The company sees annual sales growth of 1.5 percent to 3.5
percent in 2013.  To contact the reporter on this story:
