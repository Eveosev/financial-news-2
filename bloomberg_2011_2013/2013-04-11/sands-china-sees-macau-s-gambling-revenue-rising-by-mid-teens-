Sands China Ltd. (1928) , the Macau casino
operator controlled by billionaire  Sheldon Adelson , said it
expects 2013 gaming revenue for the Chinese territory to exceed
last year, helped by more hotel rooms and rail services.  Macau’s casino revenue growth rate should be in the “mid-
teens” this year and higher than 2012, Chief Executive Officer
Edward Tracy said in an interview in the city yesterday.  Gambling revenue in Macau jumped 25 percent to a record
31.3 billion patacas ($3.9 billion) in March, as casino
operators expanded and added more hotel rooms to draw gamblers
from  China . Gaming revenue growth in the former Portuguese
colony slowed to 14 percent last year from 42 percent in 2011,
as the local government limited casino table additions in the
only place in China where they’re legal.  “Strong Chinese economic growth and the improved liquidity
should drive the gaming demand,” Lantis Li, a Hong Kong-based
analyst at  Capital Securities Corp. (6005)  said by phone. Li also
estimates 2013 Macau casino revenue growth will be in the range
of 14 percent to 16 percent.  Sands China’s stock has gained 28 percent over the past
year. The Macau Government Tourist Office expects about 28
million visitors this year, about the same as last year, said
Helena Fernandes, director of the office. China’s avian flu
outbreak hasn’t had a severe impact on tourism, she said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
