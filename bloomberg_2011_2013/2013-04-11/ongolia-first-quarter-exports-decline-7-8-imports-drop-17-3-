Mongolia’s exports declined 7.8
percent in the first quarter from a year earlier and imports
fell 17.3 percent, the  National Statistics Office  said today.  Exports totaled $809.2 million in the first three months of
this year, falling by $68.6 million from a year earlier, and
imports were $1.2 billion, down $252.9 million, according to the
statistics bureau.  Mongolia’s central bank cut  interest rates  from April 8 for
the second time this year after economic growth moderated to
12.3 percent last year from a record 17.3 percent in 2011.
Growth slowed after the price of coal, Mongolia’s biggest
export, declined and additional controls on foreign ownership of
mining assets introduced by government last year led to a 17
percent decline in 2012 foreign investment.  The nation’s annual exports fell 9 percent last year to
$4.38 billion as imports rose 2.1 percent to $6.74 billion,
according to the statistics office.  To contact the reporter on this story:
