ING U.S. Inc., the American
insurance unit of  ING Groep NV (INGA)  that’s planning to go public, is
changing its name as it distances itself from the largest Dutch
financial-services company.  The business will be called Voya Financial, the company
said today in a statement distributed by PR Newswire. ING U.S.
filed for an initial public offering in November, and said today
its ticker symbol will be VOYA.  ING Groep is taking the unit public to satisfy the
conditions of its 2008 bailout, which stipulated that the bank
sell insurance operations, its U.S. online bank and a Dutch
mortgage lender before the end of this year. The U.S. unit, led
by former American International Group Inc. executive Rodney Martin, competes with  MetLife Inc. (MET)  and Prudential Financial Inc.  “As more Americans face the growing responsibility to plan
and save for their retirement, ING U.S.’s goal is help guide
them on their voyage toward greater financial preparedness,”
the company said in the statement.  ING U.S. said last week that it expects to get gross
proceeds of about $600 million from the IPO. Morgan Stanley,
Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Citigroup Inc. are leading the
sale. The company plans to list on the  New York  Stock Exchange.  To contact the reporter on this story:
