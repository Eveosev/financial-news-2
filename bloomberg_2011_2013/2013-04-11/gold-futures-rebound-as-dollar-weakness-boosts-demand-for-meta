Gold gained for the second time in
three days as a weaker dollar increased demand for the precious
metal as an alternative investment.  The dollar slipped as much as 0.6 percent against a basket
of six currencies. Cyprus denied that it plans to sell bullion
to ease its debt crisis. Gold tumbled 1.8 percent yesterday, the
most since November, after a draft of a European Commission
report obtained by  Bloomberg News  showed that Cypriot
authorities would sell metal reserves.  “A weaker dollar is supporting gold,”  Adam Klopfenstein ,
a senior market strategist at Archer Financial Services Inc. in
 Chicago , said in a telephone interview. “The Cyprus denial is
helpful, and we are definitely seeing some demand as prices have
fallen sharply.”  Gold futures for June delivery rose 0.4 percent to
$1,564.40 an ounce at 10:49 a.m. on the Comex in New York.
Prices earlier retreated as much 0.4 percent after U.S. jobless
claims fell more than analysts expected, easing pressure on
policy makers to increase stimulus to boost growth.  Several Federal Reserve officials said the central bank
should begin tapering its quantitative easing program later this
year and stop it by year-end, according to the minutes of their
March meeting, released yesterday. Each month the Fed buys $85
billion of securities.  Silver futures for May delivery gained 0.3 percent to
$27.73 an ounce.  To contact the reporter on this story:
