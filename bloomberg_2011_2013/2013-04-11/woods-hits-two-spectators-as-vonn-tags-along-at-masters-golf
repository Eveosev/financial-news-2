Tiger Woods’s quest for his fifth
Masters Tournament title began with two errant shots that struck
fans and ended with a 2-under-par 70 that left him four shots
off the lead.  The world’s No. 1-ranked golfer had three birdies and a
bogey at Augusta National Golf Club, where he is seeking to end
an eight-year title drought. The opening round matched the
second-lowest total of his 19 appearances at the event in
Augusta,  Georgia . Woods posted first-round scores of 70 en route
to three of his four previous titles.  “It’s a good start,” Woods told reporters. “Some years,
some guys shot 65 starting out here. But right now I’m only four
back and I’m right there. It was a good day.”  Among Woods’s gallery at golf’s first of four annual Grand
Slam events was  Lindsey Vonn , his girlfriend and a six-time World Cup ski champion.  A three-time winner on the U.S.  PGA Tour  this season,
Woods’s day began erratically. After a par on the opening hole,
where his birdie putt from about 10 feet came up short and left
of the cup, he struck the leg of a fan with his second shot on
the next hole. He went on to make par, sinking a short putt
after a long, curling chip from the back of the green.  He followed that with a tee shot on the par-4 third hole
that knocked a beer cup out of a startled spectator’s hand on
the left side of the fairway. Again, Woods was able to salvage a
two-putt par.  Atop Leaderboard  After he birdied the par-3 sixth and par-5 eighth holes,
course workers moved his name to the top of the leaderboard
behind the ninth green although several players still had better
scores. Woods glanced at the leaderboard as he walked to the
10th tee as the same time as three-time Masters winner  Phil Mickelson  was approaching the course’s nearby first tee.  Woods’s third birdie came on the par-5 13th hole, giving
him his 44th birdie in 71 Masters rounds on the hole, the most
of any hole on the course. Though Woods’s early play was less
than perfect, it didn’t diminish the support he received as he
walked the course.  Knight, Rudy  Along with Vonn, who wore a soft brace on her surgically
repaired right knee, Woods’s gallery included  Nike Inc. (NKE)  Chairman
and co-founder  Phil Knight , who walked with Woods’s mother,
Kultida, on his left arm, and former  New York  City Mayor  Rudy Giuliani .  Vonn’s knee injury forced her to spend most of the day
under a large oak tree behind the clubhouse among a group that
included  Mark Steinberg , Woods’s agent.  Woods, 37, has won his past two U.S. PGA Tour starts and
has three victories this season to climb back atop the Official
World Golf Ranking. Woods won the most recent of his four
Masters titles in 2005 and hasn’t captured a major championship
since claiming the 14th of his career at the 2008  U.S. Open .  To contact the reporter on this story:
