The U.S. will ask  China  to abide by
United Nations sanctions against North Korea and shut off the
flow of money that could be used to develop weapons of mass
destruction, a State Department official said.  Secretary of State John Kerry, on his first trip to Asia as
the top U.S. diplomat, is scheduled to meet with leaders in
Beijing,  Seoul  and  Tokyo  as the region confronts threats of war
by North Korea. Two U.S. officials briefed reporters
accompanying Kerry on the condition of not being named.  The U.S. wants to convince China, North Korea’s main ally,
that it’s in China’s economic and political interests to reverse
a long-standing practice of looking the other way regarding
banned cross-border trade with its Communist neighbor, an
administration official said.  Kerry will also urge China to toughen its message to
leaders in Pyongyang and will seek information about
conversations between China and North Korea as well as what kind
of leverage the new Chinese leader, Xi Jinping, has on North
Korean dictator Kim Jong Un, the State Department official said.  There will be no quid pro quo in U.S.-China discussions and
the U.S. won’t soften its criticism of China’s human-rights
record and assertiveness over disputed areas in the South China
Sea in exchange for greater cooperation on North Korea, the
official said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
