President  Barack Obama  said the
time has come for North Korea to end its “belligerent
approach” and vowed the U.S. would defend its interests and
those of its allies in the region.  Obama told reporters before a meeting today with United
Nations Secretary General Ban Ki-moon that the North Korean
regime should “lower temperatures” of its rhetoric to avoid a
conflict on the Korean peninsula.  “The U.S. will take all necessary steps to protect its
people and to meet our obligations under our alliances in the
region,” Obama said.  U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry is heading to Asia to
reassure allies South Korea and  Japan  and seek help from new
Chinese President Xi Jinping in trying to defuse tensions with
North Korea.  The region has been on edge since February over a North
Korean nuclear weapons test, threats of war and visible
preparations for a missile launch or another nuclear test.  The regime headed by Kim Jong Un, North Korea’s supreme
leader since his father’s December 2011 death, has threatened to
launch pre-emptive nuclear strikes against its enemies.  Ban said he commended Obama for the administration’s
“measured response” to the crisis so far.  To contact the reporter on this story:
