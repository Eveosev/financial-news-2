Citigroup Inc. (C) , the third-biggest
U.S. bank, will sell its consumer banking unit in Turkey to  OAO
Sberbank (SBER) , Russia’s largest lender, as it withdraws or scales
back operations in some  emerging markets .  The transaction, subject to regulatory approval, is
expected to be completed in the third quarter, Denizbank, the
Turkish unit of Sberbank, said in a filing to the  Istanbul stock
exchange  today. The price will be announced later, it said. The
unit may be valued at about $270 million, a person who asked not
to be identified because the sale talks were private, told
Bloomberg last month.  Citigroup will sell or shrink consumer banking operations
in Turkey, Pakistan, Romania, Uruguay and Paraguay as it cuts
costs under new Chief Executive Officer  Michael Corbat , it said
in December. The New York-based lender will continue commercial
and corporate banking activities in Turkey, country chief Serra Akcaoglu said in an e-mailed statement today.  The unit in Turkey had 1.2 billion liras ($670 million) of
assets, 1.5 billion liras of deposits and more than 600,000
clients at the end of last year, Denizbank said. Citigroup owns
37 branches.  Sberbank bought Denizbank last year, paying Belgium’s  Dexia
SA (DEXB)  6.47 billion liras ($3.6 billion).  Denizbank climbed 5.2 percent to 11.10 liras at 10:17 a.m.
in Istanbul, valuing the company at 7.95 billion liras.  To contact the reporter on this story:
