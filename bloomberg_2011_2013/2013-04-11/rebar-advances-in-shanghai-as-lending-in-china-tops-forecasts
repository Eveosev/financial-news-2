Steel reinforcement-bar futures
rose to the highest in two weeks as  China ’s new  yuan  loans and
money supply exceeded estimates, buoying confidence among
commodity investors.  The contract for October delivery on the Shanghai Futures
Exchanged gained as much as 1.1 percent to 3,888 yuan ($627) a
metric ton, the highest since March 28, before trading at 3,872
at 10:39 a.m.  China’s new local-currency loans were 1.06 trillion yuan
($171 billion) last month, the central bank said today in
Beijing, compared with the 900 billion yuan median estimate in a
Bloomberg survey of 34 economists. M2, the country’s broadest
measure of money supply, rose 15.7 percent in March from a year
earlier, faster than the median forecast of 14.6 percent.  “It seems the government is keeping credit accommodative
to revive the economy, which is quite critical for bulk
commodities such as rebar,” Wu Jingchen, analyst at Capital
Futures Co., said by phone from Beijing today.  The spot  iron ore  at Tianjin port gained 1.1 percent to
$140.60 a dry ton yesterday, according to The Steel Index Ltd.
The average spot price of rebar was little changed at 3,645 yuan
a ton yesterday, according to Beijing Antaike Information
Development Co.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
