Euro-area banks’ lending to
companies in the region declined in February as the financial
crisis hurt economic growth and forced lenders to divert capital
to restructuring their businesses.  Total outstanding loans to firms, excluding financial
institutions, fell an annual 2.6 percent to 4.51 trillion euros
($5.9 trillion), the  European Central Bank  said in its monthly
report published on its website today.  “The current economic conditions and persistently high
uncertainty continue to be reflected in weak demand for bank
loans,” the Frankfurt-based ECB said. “Constraints on supply
side weigh on credit growth in a number of euro-area
countries.”  Banks are bolstering their balance sheets to comply with
stricter regulations designed to help stop them from failing.
That’s making some loans such as longer-term project financing
more expensive because the banks are required to set aside more
capital.  To contact the reporter on this story:
