China ’s benchmark money-market rate
fell toward a two-week low after a report signaled capital
inflows rose as the nation’s currency strengthened.  Yuan   positions  at local lenders accumulated from sales of
foreign exchange to the central bank climbed 295 billion yuan
($48 billion) in February, according to figures published by the
People’s Bank of China yesterday. The amount, an indicator of
cross-border fund flows, has increased by 1.11 trillion yuan
since December.  Interest-rate swaps  climbed after data today
showed bank lending rose more than economists forecast.  “I expect overall inflows in the first half would be
stronger than in 2012, due to expectations of  China’s economy 
recovering and the yuan strengthening,” said Eliza Liu, a
Beijing-based economist at CCB International Securities. “The
PBOC is likely to conduct repos to drain some liquidity.”  The seven-day  repurchase rate , which measures interbank
funding availability, dropped 17 basis points to 3.04 percent as
of 11:04 a.m. in  Shanghai , according to a weighted average rate
compiled by the National Interbank Funding Center. It reached
2.83 percent earlier, approaching the lowest level since March
27 of 2.14 percent touched yesterday.  The yuan fell 0.06 percent to 6.1974 per dollar today after
reaching a 19-year high of 6.1923 yesterday. The PBOC auctioned
46 billion yuan of 28-day repurchase contracts at 2.75 percent,
according to a statement on its website.  Bank Lending  New yuan bank  loans  totaled 1.06 trillion yuan in March,
according to figures published today by the monetary authority.
That compared with a median estimate of 900 billion yuan in a
Bloomberg survey of economists and the 620 billion yuan lent in
February.  The three-year onshore swap contract, the fixed cost needed
to receive the floating seven-day repo rate, climbed two basis
points to 3.45 percent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
Three-year non-deliverable offshore swap  rates  rose four basis
points, or 0.04 percentage point, to 3.41 percent in  Hong Kong .  “The offshore interest-rate swaps are reacting to the
higher regional IRS and also the strong Chinese economic data,”
said Wee-Khoon Chong, a strategist at Societe Generale SA in
Hong Kong.  The yield on the 3.15 percent government bonds due January
2018 was little changed at 3.20 percent, according to the
Interbank Funding Center.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
