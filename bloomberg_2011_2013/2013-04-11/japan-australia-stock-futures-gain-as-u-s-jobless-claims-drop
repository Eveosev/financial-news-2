Japanese and Australian stock
futures edged higher, with the MSCI Asia Pacific Index heading
for its best weekly gain in seven months, after U.S. jobless
claims fell and the yen weakened as investors bet global
central-bank stimulus will buoy equities.  American Depositary Receipts  of  Canon Inc. (7751) , a camera maker
that gets 80 percent of sales outside Japan, advanced 1.1
percent as the yen traded within 0.1 percent of 100 yen to the
dollar. Shares of  Fast Retailing Co. (9983)  may be active as Credit
Suisse Group AG analysts said overseas business growth won’t be
able to offset a slowdown in Japan. ADRs of BHP Billiton Ltd.,
the world’s biggest miner, fell 0.4 percent as metals prices
dropped.  Futures on Japan’s  Nikkei 225 Stock Average (NKY)  expiring in
June closed at 13,495 in Chicago yesterday, up from 13,490 at
the close in Osaka, Japan. They were bid in the pre-market at
13,490 in Osaka at 8:05 a.m. local time. Futures on  Australia ’s
S&P/ASX 200 Index advanced 0.2 percent and New Zealand’s NZX 50
Index rose 0.1 percent.  “Markets could grind higher for an extended period,” said
Matthew Sherwood, head of investment markets research in Sydney
at Perpetual Investments, which manages about $25 billion. They
“are rising again in the wake of central-bank largesse. Profits
need to be revised higher in the coming months for the market
rally to be sustained.”  Yen Weakens  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index, the benchmark regional
equities gauge, yesterday posted its biggest advance in eight
months as the yen neared 100 to the dollar after the  Bank of
Japan  said it will maintain stimulus and loan growth in China
topped estimates.  The gauge has climbed the past five months on speculation
Japan would do more to boost the economy and amid signs the  U.S.
economy  is recovering. That left the gauge yesterday trading at
14 times average estimated earnings compared with 14.4 for the
 Standard & Poor’s 500 Index (SPX)  and 12.7 times for the Stoxx Europe
600 Index, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index gained 0.1
percent. The gauge closed at a record as retailers climbed amid
rising March sales and as jobless claims dropped more than
estimated.  Jobless claims decreased by 42,000 to 346,000 in the week
ended April 6 from a revised 388,000, Labor Department figures
showed yesterday in Washington. The median forecast of 49
economists surveyed by Bloomberg called for a drop to 360,000.
Holidays such as Easter that fall on different weeks from year
to year make it difficult to smooth out swings in the data,
leading to increased volatility, the Labor Department said.  The  Bloomberg China-US Equity Index (CH55BN)  of the most-traded
Chinese shares in the U.S. dropped 1.1 percent in New York
yesterday.  The Thomson Reuters/Jefferies CRB Commodity Index slid 0.3
percent yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
