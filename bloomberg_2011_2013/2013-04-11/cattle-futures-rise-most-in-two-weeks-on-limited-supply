Cattle futures rose the most in two
weeks on signs of constrained supplies in the U.S., the world’s
biggest beef exporter. Hogs also climbed.  U.S. beef output will be almost 25 billion pounds (11.3
million metric tons) this year, down 0.9 percent from the March
estimate and 4 percent lower than 2012, the Department of
Agriculture said yesterday. The U.S. cattle herd was the
smallest since 1952 at the start of 2013 after the most-severe
drought since the 1930s cut livestock-feed supplies and damaged
pastures.  “We’re still dealing with limited numbers of cattle,”
 Lane Broadbent , a vice president at KIS Futures Inc. in  Oklahoma
City , said in a telephone interview. The number of cattle
available for slaughter “is still tight,” he said.  Cattle futures for June delivery rose 0.6 percent to
$1.20675 a pound at 10:05 a.m. on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange. A close at that price would mark the biggest increase
for a most-active contract since March 28. Through yesterday,
the commodity dropped 9.3 percent in 2013.  Feeder-cattle futures for May settlement climbed 0.1
percent to $1.42425 a pound.  Hog futures for June settlement advanced 0.5 percent to
89.925 cents a pound. Through yesterday, the price climbed 4.4
percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
