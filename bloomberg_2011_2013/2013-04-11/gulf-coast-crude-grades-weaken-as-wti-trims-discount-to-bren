Gulf Coast crudes weakened against
West Texas Intermediate as the domestic benchmark strengthened
by about 50 cents a barrel versus Brent.  WTI’s discount to Brent narrowed 39 cents to $10.76 a
barrel against Brent. When Brent drops versus WTI, it typically
weakens the value of U.S. grades that compete with foreign
crudes priced against the international benchmark.  Light Louisiana Sweet dropped 75 cents to $14 a barrel over
WTI at 2:13 p.m.  New York  time, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. Heavy Louisiana Sweet’s premium to WTI weakened 20
cents to $14.10 a barrel.  Mars Blend’s premium to WTI narrowed 10 cents to $8.60 a
barrel, while Poseidon lost 40 cents to $8.10 over the
benchmark. The premium for  Thunder Horse , which has a lower
sulfur content than Mars and Poseidon, rose by 25 cents to
$11.75.  Bakken crude delivered at Clearbrook,  Minnesota , weakened
25 cents a barrel to a $1.50-a-barrel premium to WTI.  In  Canada , Western Canada Select weakened by 50 cents a
barrel to a $14 per barrel discount to WTI, at 1:33 p.m. New
York time, according to Calgary-based broker Net Energy, Inc.
Syncrude, a light oil produced from oil-sands upgraders,
weakened by 55 cents to a $6.95 premium.  To contact the reporter on this story:
