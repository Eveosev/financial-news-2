Ashland Inc. (ASH) , the biggest producer
of specialty papermaking chemicals, jumped after activist
investor Jana Partners LLC revealed it acquired a 7.4 percent
stake in the company and has spoken to management.  Jana owned 5.81 million shares of the Covington, Kentucky-
based chemical maker as of yesterday, the New York-based firm
said today in a regulatory filing. Jana has spoken with Ashland
management about “the business, capitalization, corporate
structure, operations, strategy and future plans,” according to
the filing.  The filing was released after the close of regular trading
in  New York , where Ashland  climbed  6.6 percent to $84 at 4:52
p.m.  Jana, co-founded by Barry Rosenstein in 2001, is an event-
driven fund that invests in companies undergoing changes such as
mergers, spinoffs and bankruptcies. Jana has been pushing for
changes at Calgary-based fertilizer producer  Agrium Inc. (AGU)  since
May.  Jana said it expects to have more discussions with
management and possibly Ashland directors, and it may take steps
“to bring about changes to increase shareholder value.”  Jana bought the stake “because it believes the shares are
undervalued and represent an attractive investment
opportunity,” according to the filing.  To contact the reporter on this story:
