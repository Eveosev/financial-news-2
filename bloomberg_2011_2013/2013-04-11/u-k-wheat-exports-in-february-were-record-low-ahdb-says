U.K. wheat exports in February
tumbled to 17,800 metric tons, the lowest monthly total on
record, the Agriculture & Horticulture Development Board said.  Imports of wheat were 256,000 tons during the month,
bringing total purchases this marketing year to 1.86 million
tons, more than triple the amount at the same time last year,
AHDB’s grain unit the Home-Grown Cereals Authority said in an
online  statement  today, citing customs data. Millers, starch
producers and ethanol makers used more than 520,000 tons of
imported wheat in February, the most on records dating to the
1991-92 season, AHDB said.  The U.K. may be a net-importer of wheat this season for the
first time in 11 years, Kenilworth, England-based AHDB has said,
after the second-wettest year on record in 2012 slashed the
domestic harvest. Exports since the marketing year began July 1
plunged to 547,961 tons, compared with shipments of almost 2.1
million tons at the same time last year, according to today’s
report.  Germany  was the biggest supplier of wheat to the U.K. in
February, with shipments totaling 102,270 tons, followed by
France and  Denmark , AHDB said.  U.K. barley exports in February totaled 22,576 tons,
against imports of 23,560 tons, AHDB said. Exports of rapeseed
during the month were 41,807 tons, up 45 percent from a month
earlier. Purchases of the oilseed totaled 825 tons.  To contact the reporter on this story:
