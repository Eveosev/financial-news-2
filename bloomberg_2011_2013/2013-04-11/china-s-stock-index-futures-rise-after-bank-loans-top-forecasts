China’s  stocks  fell as commodity
producers led declines on benchmark indexes amid lower material
prices, overshadowing gains for banks after new loans and money
supply data exceeded analysts’ forecasts.  Jiangxi Copper Co., the nation’s biggest producer of the
metal, slid the most in a week after metal prices retreated.
 Aluminum Corp of China Ltd. (2600)  slumped the most in two weeks after
rallying 5.6 percent yesterday. Industrial Bank Co. paced gains
for lenders, rising 2.3 percent.  The  Shanghai Composite Index (SHCOMP)  dropped 0.3 percent to
2,219.55 at the close, after changing directions at least 11
times. The measure rose as much as 0.7 percent earlier after a
government report showed new local-currency lending in March was
1.06 trillion yuan ($171 billion), compared with the 900 billion
yuan in a Bloomberg News survey of 34 economists. Other reports
this week showed March exports fell more than forecast,
inflation eased and producer prices slumped for a 13th month.  “Cyclical stocks such as energy and materials are always
the first to be hit when people have concerns about the
economy,” Zhang Lei, an analyst with Minsheng Securities Co.,
said by phone from Beijing. “Stocks rose this morning due to
the loans data but it’s not strong enough to maintain gains. The
weak data from the previous two days such as PPI and exports
mean economic fundamentals are still weak and any gains will be
short-lived.”  The CSI 300 Index declined 0.3 percent to 2,477.88. The
Hang Seng China Enterprises Index slipped 0.1 percent. The
 Bloomberg China-US Equity Index (CH55BN)  of the most-traded Chinese
companies in the U.S. rose 0.9 percent yesterday, led by Suntech
Power Holdings Co. and Baidu Inc.  Bank Loans  The Shanghai index has slid 8.8 percent from a Feb. 6 high
amid concern steps to cool  property  prices will drag on economic
growth. The gauge’s trading volume was 30 percent below the 30-
day average today, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Valuations on the Shanghai gauge dropped to 9.1 times
projected 12-month earnings, near the lowest level since Dec. 13
and less than the seven-year average of 15.8,  data  compiled by
Bloomberg show.  A gauge of material producers in the CSI 300 fell 0.9
percent, the most among the 10 industry groups. Jiangxi Copper
slid 1.6 percent to 22.09  yuan . Copper for August delivery on
the Shanghai Futures Exchange fell 0.5 percent to close at
54,890 yuan ($8,858) a ton. Aluminum Corp. retreated 2.8 percent
to 4.22 yuan after surging 5.6 percent yesterday.  Industrial Bank led gains for lenders, advancing 2.3
percent to 17.65 yuan. Huaxia Bank Co. climbed 0.3 percent to
10.17 yuan.  Bank Loans  March’s local-currency loans rose from 620 billion yuan in
February. M2 money supply jumped 15.7 percent, more than the
median forecast of 14.6 percent, the People’s Bank of China
said.  The “strong” bank lending and M2 money supply data signal
monetary policy was loose in March, increasing the likelihood of
more policy tightening ahead, according to Nomura Holdings Inc.  The nation’s economic recovery has been “shallow” and
there are signs that growth momentum may have slowed in March
despite loose policy stance, as suggested by weak electricity
consumption and freight traffic growth, Zhang Zhiwei and Wendy
Chen, economists at Nomura, wrote in a report dated today.  The National Bureau of Statistics is scheduled to publish
first-quarter gross domestic producer and fixed-asset investment
as well as March readings of industrial output and retail sales
on April 15.  To contact the reporter on this story:
