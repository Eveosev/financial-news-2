Wells Fargo & Co. (WFC)  said it will
appeal a decision forcing it to defend a U.S. lawsuit over
illegal mortgage practices.  Wells Fargo has said it can’t be sued by the U.S. attorney
in New York under the  False Claims Act  because it had already
reached an agreement with the government that was approved last
April.  The San Francisco-based bank today filed a notice of appeal
of a Feb. 12 decision by U.S. District Judge Rosemary Collyer in
Washington that a $25 billion agreement Wells and four other
banks made with the Justice Department in April 2012 didn’t
release it from facing the false-claims allegations in the New
York case filed in October.  The “certain liabilities” Wells Fargo was released from
in its settlement with the  Justice Department  didn’t include the
issues raised in the New York case, Collyer wrote at the time.  Katie Dixon, a Justice Department spokeswoman, didn’t
immediately respond to a phone message seeking comment on the
bank’s filing today.  The Washington case is U.S. v. Bank of America, 12-
cv-00361, U.S. District Court,  District of Columbia 
(Washington). The New York case is U.S. v. Wells Fargo Bank NA,
12-cv-07527, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York
(Manhattan).  To contact the reporters on this story:
