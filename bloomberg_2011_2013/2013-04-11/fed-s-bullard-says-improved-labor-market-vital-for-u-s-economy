Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis
President  James Bullard  said improvement in the labor market and
small-business development are “central to a better future”
for the world’s largest economy.  The Fed should help families recover from the longest
recession since the Great Depression by promoting “financial
inclusion” and supporting both neighborhood revitalization and
household financial stability, Bullard said today at the Federal
Reserve System Community Development Research  Conference  in
Washington.  “Better results on inclusion may ultimately create an
economy that makes the fullest possible use of its rich array of
available talent,” Bullard said in his prepared remarks. He did
not comment on  interest rates  or the economic outlook.  High-quality economic research can play a main role in
designing “wise policies” and avoiding policy mistakes that
“undoubtedly contributed to the housing bubble and the
resulting recession.”  Bullard, 52, joined the St. Louis Fed’s research department
in 1990 and became president of the regional bank in 2008. His
district includes  Arkansas  and parts of Illinois, Indiana,
Kentucky, Mississippi,  Missouri  and Tennessee.  To contact the reporter on this story:
