A gene mutation known to help
influenza resist Tamiflu was found in the first of three H7N9
bird-flu patient specimens in  China , sequence data show.  The flu virus from the patient in Shanghai has a mutation
known as R292K that causes high-level resistance to the  Roche
Holding AG (ROG)  pill and reduced sensitivity to a related drug from
 GlaxoSmithKline Plc (GSK)  called Relenza, genetic sequence information
posted on the  website  of the Global Initiative on Sharing Avian
Influenza Data show. Subsequent H7N9 specimens from a patient in
Shanghai and one in Anhui province don’t show the mutation.  The finding of the mutation warrants further analysis, said
Masato Tashiro, a director at  Japan ’s National Institute of
Infectious Diseases in  Tokyo . Preliminary tests so far show no
evidence that the new flu strain, which has sickened at least 33
people, killing nine, in eastern China, has developed resistance
to the neuraminidase inhibitor drugs Tamiflu and Relenza, the
 World Health Organization  said in a  statement  yesterday.  “When you look at the raw data and compare the three
strains of the virus, there’s a signal from one strain that it’s
less sensitive to both of the neuraminidase inhibitors,”
Tashiro said in a telephone interview. “It’s not a strong
signal, but there’s a possibility” of resistance, he said.  The Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention in
Beijing has studied H7N9 specimens and confirmed that the virus
is sensitive to neuraminidase inhibitors, Tashiro said.  “At this point, we should accept what the Chinese CDC
says,” he said.  More experiments are needed to understand the biological
significance of gene sequence data, said Gavin Smith, an
associate professor in the emerging  infectious diseases  program
at Singapore’s Duke-NUS medical school.  Absence of the R292K mutations “would be of less concern
than having them there, but it still needs to be tested,” said
Smith. “They provide an indication of the type of things we
should be looking at.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
