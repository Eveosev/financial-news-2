Russia’s economy will grow slower
than expected in 2013 due to decelerating industrial output and
investment, Deputy Economy Minister  Andrei Klepach  said.  Gross domestic product  will expand 2.4 percent compared
with a previous forecast of 3.6 percent, Klepach told reporters
in the far eastern city of Ulan Ude today. The ministry also cut
its prediction for  industrial output  to 2 percent from a
previous 3.6 percent and for  investment  in productive capacities
to 4.6 percent from 6.5 percent, Klepach said, adding that the
new figures were “optimistic.”  Russia, the world’s largest energy producer, faces an
economic slowdown as  Europe ’s debt crisis prompts companies to
cut investment. The expansion eased to 2.1 percent in 2012’s
fourth quarter, the slowest pace since a recession in 2009.
Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev’s medium-term target is for 5
percent growth.  “That’s a very significant forecast reduction,” Vladimir Tikhomirov, chief economist at Otkritie Financial Corp. in
Moscow, said by phone. “Growth below 3 percent is close to
stagnation for emerging economies, which includes  Russia .”  The ruble gained 0.2 percent against dollar to 30.8120 as
of 6:52 p.m. in Moscow. The Micex Index fell 1.7 percent to
1,401.73 by the close in Moscow, the lowest since Nov. 29.  The economy expanded “about 1 percent” in the first
quarter, Economy Minister Andrei Belousov said April 7.
According to the ministry’s estimates, February gross-domestic-
product growth decelerated to 0.1 percent from a year earlier
compared with 1.6 percent in January.  Russia’s economy will expand less than 2 percent in 2013 if
output continues at the current pace, Klepach said at a March 29
conference in Moscow.  Net capital outflows will reach $30 billion to $35 billion
this year, Klepach said today, compared with a previous forecast
of $10 billion. The central bank estimates net outflows will
total $25.8 billion in the first quarter.  To contact the reporters on this story:
