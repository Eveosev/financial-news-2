Euro-area financial stability
weakens when banks retrench and cordon off assets behind
business lines or national borders, European Central Bank
Executive Board Member Benoit Coeure said.  The ECB should aim to reverse these instincts when it takes
over as a common supervisor next year, Coeure said in an article
prepared for a conference in Dublin today and obtained by
 Bloomberg News .  “In the current national-based supervisory system,
domestic banks with subsidiaries abroad are often encouraged to
repatriate capital and liquidity from a country under stress or
to ring-fence certain activities or business lines,” Coeure
said. “This is not conducive to the stability of the euro-area
banking system as a whole and ignores the possibility of adverse
feedback from instability elsewhere.”  Coeure said “unchecked” financial integration can amplify
these risks because it increases complexity and the risk of
cross-border contagion. This, in turn, increases the risk that
financial markets will become fragmented in reaction to shocks.  The ECB will be able to bolster the quality of financial
integration when it takes up its new duties, Coeure said. This
may also help European economies return to growth, he said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
