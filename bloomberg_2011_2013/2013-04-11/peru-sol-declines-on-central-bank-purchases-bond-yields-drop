Peru’s sol fell the most in two
weeks as the central bank purchased dollars to slow appreciation
after foreign direct investment boosted inflows.  The sol depreciated 0.2 percent to 2.5820 per dollar at
today’s close, the steepest decline since March 27, according to
prices from Datatec.  The central bank said on its website it sold local currency
to  buy  $100 million today, extending its purchases this week to
$510 million. Pressure on the currency to appreciate will
continue because of mining investment and inflows from local
companies selling dollar bonds overseas, said Felipe Hernandez,
an analyst at Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc.  “The outlook for foreign direct investment is very
strong,” Hernandez said by phone from  Stamford ,  Connecticut .
The central bank’s purchases are designed to “slow down the
pace of appreciation to allow the economy to adjust to the
stronger” sol, he said.  The central bank increased in a March 22 report its
forecast for foreign direct investment in 2013 to $10.8 billion
from a projection of $8.2 billion three months earlier.
Investment rose to a record $12 billion in 2012.  Local banks pared their net dollar holdings to $91 million
on April 9 from $367 million a week earlier, according to Banco
Central de Reserva del Peru data compiled by Bloomberg.  The yield on the nation’s benchmark 7.84 percent sol bond
due in August 2020 declined one basis point, or 0.01 percentage
point, to 3.74 percent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
The price climbed 0.06 centimo to 125.90 centimos per sol.  To contact the reporter on this story:
