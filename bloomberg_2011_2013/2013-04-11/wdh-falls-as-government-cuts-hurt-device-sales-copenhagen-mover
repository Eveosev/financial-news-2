William Demant Holding A/S (WDH)  fell the
most in a week to become the second-worst performing stock in
the Copenhagen benchmark index, after Exane BNP Paribas said
government spending cuts are hurting sales.  The Nordic region’s biggest hearing-aid maker  fell  as much
as 2 percent to 465.30 kroner. The stock declined 1.1 percent to
469.90 kroner at 12:42 p.m. in the Danish capital with 42,528
shares traded. Daily trading in William Demant has  averaged 
121,144 shares in the past three months.  Governments are cutting back on health-care spending to
rein in budgets, while bleak economic prospects are curbing
 consumer spending . That’s having more of an impact on hearing
aid sales than industry analysts had predicted, and supports a
“pretty cautious” outlook for 2013, according to Exane analyst
Romain Zana. He lowered his recommendation on the stock to
underperform from  neutral  and set a 440-krone price target.  The current share price “does not reflect the changing
environment,” Zana said in a note to clients, after attending
the  American Academy  of Audiology’s annual meeting last week in
 Los Angeles . “Hearing aids have proven more sensitive than
initially expected to public spending/reimbursement and consumer
sentiment.”  Shares in Smorum, Denmark-based William Demant have dropped
6.8 percent since April 3, after it said it would buy Neurelec,
a maker of hearing implants. Demant is taking on  Sonova (SOON)  Holding
AG with the purchase, though it will take “several years” to
expand the business, Zana said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
