Success Trade Securities, Inc. was
sued by the brokerage industry’s self-regulator over claims it
sold fraudulent promissory notes to professional athletes.  Fuad Ahmed, the chief executive officer of the Washington-
based firm, raised more than $18 million since 2009 from 58
investors, many of whom are current or former players in the
 National Football League  and  National Basketball Association ,
the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority said in a complaint
issued today.  Finra, which didn’t disclose the names of the harmed
investors, filed a temporary cease-and-desist order to halt the
alleged misuse of investors’ funds and assets.  Ahmed sold promissory notes offering annual  interest rates 
ranging from 12 percent to 26 percent, Finra said. To meet the
monthly interest obligations, the brokerage issued and sold
additional notes to new and existing investors, according to the
complaint.  A phone call and e-mail to the firm were not immediately
returned.  To contact the reporter on this story:
