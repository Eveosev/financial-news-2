Exports of North Sea Foinaven crude
will be two cargoes in May, unchanged from this month, according
to a loading program obtained by  Bloomberg News .  Both consignments are of 600,000 barrels, the plan showed.
That compares with one of 590,000 barrels and another of 600,000
this month.  BP Plc (BP/)  operates the offshore U.K. field, west of the
Shetland Islands. Loading programs are monthly schedules of
crude shipments compiled by field operators to allow buyers and
sellers to plan their supply and trading activities.  To contact the reporter on this story:
