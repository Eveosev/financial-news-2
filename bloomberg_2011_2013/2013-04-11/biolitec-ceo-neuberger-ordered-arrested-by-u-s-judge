Biolitec AG (BIB)  Chief Executive Officer
Wolfgang Neuberger was ordered arrested by a federal judge in
Massachusetts who said Neuberger failed to comply with a court
order to not carry out a merger with Biolitec’s Austrian
subsidiary.  The order was issued in a lawsuit brought against the
German company by AngioDynamics Inc. U.S. District Judge Michael Ponsor said in yesterday’s order that he would refer the case to
U.S. prosecutors for a criminal-contempt prosecution.  Biolitec spokesman Joern Gleisner said the company’s U.S.
lawyer will appeal the order.  Biolitec, based in Jena, Germany, merged with its Austrian
unit on March 15, the company said in a March 18 statement.
Biolitec produces lasers, laser delivery systems and optical
fibers.  The U.S. case is  AngioDynamics Inc. (ANGO)  v. Biolitec AG, 09-
30181, U.S. District Court, District of Massachusetts.  To contact the reporter on this story:
