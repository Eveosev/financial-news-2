The Treasury’s $13 billion sale of
30-year bonds may draw a  yield  of 3.001 percent, according to
the average forecast in a Bloomberg News survey of seven of the
 Federal Reserve ’s 21 primary dealers.  The securities, which mature in February 2043, yielded
2.995 percent in pre-auction trading. Bids are due by 1 p.m.  New
York  time. The yield at the March 14 offering of long bonds was
3.248 percent, and the record-low auction yield was 2.580
percent in July.  The March sale’s  bid-to-cover  ratio, which gauges demand by
comparing the amount bid with the amount offered, was 2.43,
versus an average of 2.59 at the past 10 auctions.  Indirect bidders , a class of investors that includes
foreign central banks, bought 42 percent of the bonds at the
March sale, versus 36.4 percent at the February auction. The
average at the past 10 offerings was 36.7 percent.  Direct bidders , non-primary-dealer investors that place
their bids directly with the Treasury, purchased 4.9 percent of
the securities at last month’s sale, the least since September
2009. The average for the past 10 auctions is 14.7 percent.  Thirty-year bonds have lost 0.9 percent this year, compared
with a 0.2 percent gain in the broader U.S. Treasuries market,
according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch indexes.  The U.S. sold $21 billion of  10-year debt  yesterday at a
yield of 1.795 percent and auctioned $32 billion of three-year
notes on April 9 at a yield of 0.342 percent.  The sales will raise $6.7 billion of new cash, as maturing
securities held by the public total $59.3 billion, according to
the Treasury.  Primary dealers trade  government securities  with the Fed
and are obliged to participate in Treasury sales.  To contact the reporter on this story:
