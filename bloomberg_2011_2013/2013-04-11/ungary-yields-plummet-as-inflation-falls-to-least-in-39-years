Hungary’s bond yields declined to
the lowest level since 2005 as consumer prices grew at the
slowest pace in 39 years, increasing scope for the central bank
to cut  interest rates .  The inflation rate slowed to 2.2 percent in March, compared
with 2.8 percent in February, the statistics office said today.
That was the least since 1974 and less than the 2.5 percent
median estimate in a Bloomberg survey. Yields on the
government’s 10-year bonds slipped four basis points, or 0.04
percentage point, to an eight-year low of 5.80 percent at 11:20
a.m. in Budapest, a decline of 56 basis points in April.  The Magyar Nemzeti Bank, which cut rates for eight straight
months to a record low of 5 percent, may continue easing if
price pressures remain moderate and financial markets stabilize,
minutes of the March meeting showed yesterday.  “It seems increasingly likely the rate cut cycle stops at
a later date and at a lower rate than previously supposed,”
 Zoltan Torok , a Budapest-based analyst at  Raiffeisen Bank
International AG (RBI) , wrote in a note. It’s probable that “rate
cuts will continue beyond the second quarter and the key rate
might come even below 4 percent,” he said.  The forint strengthened less than 0.1 percent to 296.44
against the euro, extending this month’s gain to 2.6 percent,
the best performance among the 31 major currencies tracked by
Bloomberg.  Hungary’s Debt Management Agency raised a planned 50
billion forint ($220 million) in 12-month Treasury bills at an
auction today. The average yield fell 39 basis points from the
last sale two weeks ago to 4.16 percent, a record low, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
