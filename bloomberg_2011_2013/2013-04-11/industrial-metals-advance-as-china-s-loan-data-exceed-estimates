Base metals climbed, led by gains
in nickel, after  China ’s loan data in March exceeded estimates,
raising demand prospects in the largest user.  Nickel for delivery in three months rose 0.8 percent to
$16,175 a metric ton on the London Metal Exchange as of 10:07
a.m. Shanghai time. Lead climbed 0.4 percent to $2,098 a ton,
and zinc gained 0.2 percent to $1,914 a ton, while copper and
aluminum were little changed.  China’s new local-currency loans were 1.06 trillion  yuan 
($171 billion) in March, the People’s Bank of China said today,
compared with the 900 billion yuan median estimate in a
Bloomberg survey of 34 economists. M2 money supply rose 15.7
percent last month from a year earlier, exceeding the median
forecast of 14.6 percent.  “The positive data aided the upward correction,” He Shan,
an analyst at Galaxy Futures Co., said by phone from Beijing.
“April is a seasonal boom time, but further gains in prices
need to be supported by a substantial improvement on the  spot
market .”  Copper for August delivery on the Shanghai Futures Exchange
was little changed at 55,130 yuan a ton. Copper for delivery in
May on the Comex in  New York  was little changed at $3.4215 a
pound.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
