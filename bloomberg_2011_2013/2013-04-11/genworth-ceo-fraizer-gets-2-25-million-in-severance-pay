Genworth Financial Inc. (GNW)  said ex-
Chief Executive Officer Michael Fraizer got a $2.25 million
payment after he resigned from the insurer amid a stock plunge.  Fraizer, 54, stepped down May 1, after overseeing a share
decline of more than 80 percent since 2006 as losses at the
company’s mortgage-insurance unit drained capital. He agreed to
a release of claims against the company and said he wouldn’t
compete against Genworth for a year or solicit its staff for two
years, the insurer said in a regulatory filing today.  “In consideration of the foregoing release and covenants,
and in recognition of Mr. Fraizer’s many years of  service  with
the company and its predecessor businesses, we agreed to provide
Mr. Fraizer with a one-time lump sum separation payment equal to
two times his base salary,” the Richmond, Virginia-based
insurer said in the filing.  Fraizer, who guided Genworth through its spinoff from
General Electric Co. after a 2004 public offering, had misjudged
when results would rebound at the U.S. mortgage-insurance
business. He told investors in a December 2009 presentation that
Genworth expected quarterly operating earnings at the unit would
“turn positive in the mid-2011 time frame.” In a July 2011
statement, Genworth cited “worsening trends” in the business
as it used $375 million to provide capital support to the unit.  Fraizer’s total compensation last year was $6.69 million,
including separation pay and the accelerated vesting of some
stock awards, Genworth said today in the filing.  Chief Financial Officer Martin Klein served as acting CEO
until  Thomas McInerney  became the company’s leader on Jan. 1.
Klein got an extra $20,000 a month in his eight months as acting
CEO, helping boost his total 2012 compensation to $3.42 million,
from about $1.8 million the prior year, the insurer said.  Genworth’s shares have  rallied  62 percent since May 1. The
stock added 2 cents to $9.96 at 10:21 a.m. in  New York .  To contact the reporter on this story:
