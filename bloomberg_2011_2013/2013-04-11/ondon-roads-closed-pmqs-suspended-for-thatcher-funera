Roads in central London will be
closed for  Margaret Thatcher ’s funeral, the capital’s transport
authority said, while Prime Minister  David Cameron ’s weekly
question-and-answer session in Parliament will be canceled.  The  ceremonial funeral procession  on April 17 will run from
Parliament in Westminster, along Whitehall, through  Trafalgar
Square , on to the Strand, Aldwych, Fleet Street and Ludgate
Hill, where it will end at  St. Paul’s Cathedral .  Those roads and others in the surrounding areas and
elsewhere areas in central London will be subject to closures
and parking restrictions, Transport for London said in an e-
mailed statement today. Blackfriars and Westminster Bridges will
be closed for the duration of the event, and Waterloo Bridge
will have restricted access. BBC television is scheduled to
begin live coverage of the event at 9:15 a.m. local time.  In the House of Commons, the session at which lawmakers
challenge the premier over the government’s policies,
traditionally held at noon on Wednesdays, will be scrapped.  “It seems to me that if you have got this major ceremonial
funeral on that day, having the knockabout of prime minister’s
questions at the same time might feel a bit odd,” Deputy Prime
Minister  Nick Clegg  told LBC radio today.  The Commons will sit at 2:30 p.m. on the day of the funeral
and will meet late into the evening.  To contact the reporter on this story:
