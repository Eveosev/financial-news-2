The market for corporate borrowing
through  commercial paper  erased last week’s decline, led by a
surge in issuance from financial institutions.  The seasonally adjusted amount of U.S. commercial paper
rose $19.5 billion to $1.022 trillion outstanding in the week
ended yesterday, the Federal Reserve said today on its website.
The market, which contracted by that amount the previous week,
has climbed from $924.4 billion in the week ended Oct. 24, the
lowest level since January 2011.  Commercial paper sold by non-U.S. financial institutions 
rose for a fifth week, increasing $9 billion to $236.8 billion
outstanding, while the  amount issued by U.S.-based banks  rose
$3.6 billion to $301.6 billion, the first increase in six weeks,
according to the Fed.  Corporations sell commercial paper, typically maturing in
270 days or less, to fund everyday activities such as rent and
salaries.  To contact the reporter on this story:
