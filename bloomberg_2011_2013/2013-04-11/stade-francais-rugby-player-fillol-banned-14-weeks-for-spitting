incident involving Fillol and Stringer took place in the first
half.  At a disciplinary hearing in Dublin, Fillol admitted
committing an act contrary to good sportsmanship, the organizers
said  on their website . He expressed “genuine remorse,” they
said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
