Chelsea defeated Rubin Kazan 5-4
over two games to advance to the semifinal round of soccer’s
Europa League.  Chelsea’s 3-2 loss tonight in Moscow was enough to send it
into the last four, after the Blues’ 3-1 home win to open the
quarterfinal last week.  Ivan Marcano, Gokdeniz Karadeniz and Bebras Natcho scored
as Rubin twice came from a goal down to win.  Fernando Torres  and
Victor Moses had the goals for Chelsea.  The remaining semifinalists will be determined later today.
Basel hosts Tottenham with the teams tied 2-2, Benfica takes a
3-1 lead into its game at Newcastle and Lazio hosts Fenerbahce
trailing 2-0.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
