RealD Inc. (RLD) , a provider of 3-D
technology to cinemas, jumped the most since December after a
Piper Jaffray & Co. analyst raised his price target on the
shares, citing better-than-expected box-office sales.  RealD, based in Beverly Hills,  California , rose 5.5 percent
to $14.61 at the close in  New York , the biggest increase since
Dec. 04. The stock has gained 30 percent this year compared with
an 12 percent rise in the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index.  James Marsh, an analyst at Piper Jaffray in New York,
raised his price target on the shares to $17 from $15, citing
box-office sales from theaters using RealD’s technology.  In a  filing  late yesterday, RealD estimated March sales of
$284 million from those cinemas. The company also estimated
theaters produced sales of $268 million domestically and $346
million internationally in its quarter ended March 31. The
report provides visibility into RealD’s earnings since the
company collects revenue from theaters using its technology and
sells the glasses fans wear in 3-D movies.  Marsh rates the shares overweight, the equivalent of a buy
recommendation.  RealD is scheduled to report fourth-quarter financial
results in late May. Analysts  forecast  sales of $40.3 million
and a loss of 26 cents a share, excluding items, according to
the average of estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
