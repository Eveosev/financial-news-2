BRF SA (BRFS3) ,  Brazil ’s largest foodmaker,
rose to a record high as the investment bank Itau BBA
recommended buying the stock, saying higher product prices and
lower costs will boost earnings.  Shares advanced 3.2 percent to 46.65 reais at 12:31 p.m. in
Sao Paulo. A close at that level would be the highest since the
stock started trading in 1997. It was the biggest gain on the
benchmark Bovespa index, which slid 1.3 percent.  Itau raised its recommendation on BRF to the equivalent of
buy from hold and forecast that the shares will rise to 53 reais
by year-end. The foodmaker’s earnings excluding interest, taxes,
depreciation and amortization will almost double to 4.41 billion
reais this year, analysts Alexandre Miguel and Felipe Cruz wrote
in a note to clients today.  The estimates are based on “a lack of additional capacity
and rational competition sustaining processed food prices, a
highly profitable short-term scenario for poultry exports and
further reductions in domestic feed costs,” the analysts wrote.  BRF has gained 11 percent this year while the Bovespa has
sunk 9.1 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
