Takata Corp. (7312)  faces its biggest
recall crisis in almost two decades after defective airbag
inflators led  Toyota Motor Corp. (7203) ,  Honda Motor Co. (7267)  and Nissan
Motor Co. to call back more than 3 million vehicles.  The Japanese safety-gear producer made the products from
2000 to 2002, Takata spokesman Hideyuki Matsumoto said,
declining to comment on its customers, who identified the
supplier. According to  Toyota , malfunctioning inflators could
cause the airbag to deploy abnormally during a crash.  Takata tumbled as much as 15 percent in Tokyo trading after
Japan’s three biggest carmakers made the announcements. It’s the
biggest recall involving Takata since 1995, when several
automakers called back almost 9 million vehicles to replace
faulty seat belts made by the Japanese company -- a record for
the  auto industry  at the time.  “It looks like the cost of the recalls may be pretty
big,” said  Satoru Takada , a Tokyo-based analyst at Toward the
Infinite World Inc., referring to Takata. “It doesn’t seem like
something that would be easy to identify and fix. But if the
cause is clear, it shouldn’t have a lasting effect.”  Takata, which says it’s the second-biggest maker of
automotive safety parts, fell 9 percent to close at 1,819 yen in
Tokyo, the biggest drop in two months.  Autoliv Inc. (ALV) , the world’s
biggest maker of airbags, rose as much as 1.6 percent in
 Stockholm .  Toyota rose 5.8 percent to 5,640 yen, Nissan gained 4.4
percent and Honda rose 3.1 percent in Tokyo. The benchmark
 Nikkei 225 (NKY)  Stock Average climbed 2 percent.  Other Recalls  Matsumoto confirmed that the recall is the company’s
biggest since 1995. More recently, in 2010, Honda recalled
437,763 vehicles to inspect for faulty airbag modules supplied
by Takata.  Today, Toyota said it’s recalling 1.73 million vehicles
globally and Honda about 1.14 million units, while Nissan said
it may call back 480,000 vehicles globally.  Mazda Motor Corp. (7261) 
said it recalled 45,463 units. Its shares gained 4 percent to
315 yen.  “The involved vehicles are equipped with front-passenger
airbag inflators which could have been assembled with improperly
manufactured propellant wafers,” Toyota said in a statement.
“Improperly manufactured propellant wafers could cause the
inflator to rupture and the front passenger airbag to deploy
abnormally in the event of a crash.”  Toyota spokeswoman Shino Yamada said that five incidents of
malfunctions have been reported, though there were no accidents
or injuries. The vehicles affected include the Corolla and
Camry, and were built between November 2000 and March 2004, she
said.  For Toyota, the world’s largest automaker, it’s the second
time this year that the company has announced a recall involving
more than 1 million vehicles. Last year, Toyota announced a
recall involving 7.43 million units in October, followed by one
involving 2.77 million vehicles the next month.  To contact the reporters on this story:
