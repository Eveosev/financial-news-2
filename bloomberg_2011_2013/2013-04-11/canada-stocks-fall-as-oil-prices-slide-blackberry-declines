Canadian  stocks  fell, snapping a
three-day rally, as commodity producers slumped and BlackBerry

than 1.8 percent after oil slid for the first time in four days.

levels,” Kash Pashootan, a fund manager with First Avenue
Advisory of Raymond James Ltd., said from Ottawa. His firm
oversees about C$125 million ($124 million). “There just isn’t
the same enthusiasm for the Canadian market that there is for
the U.S. market.”  U.S. stocks extended its rally to a fourth day as retailers

this year. The S&P/TSX is up 0.4 percent for 2013.  Oil Plunges  Oil for May delivery fell 1.2 percent to settle at $93.51 a

of Nova Scotia dropped 0.8 percent to C$57.90. Manulife
Financial Corp. declined 1.6 percent to C$14.42 after the
nation’s biggest insurer jumped the most in two months yesterday
following an agreement to pay the second-highest price on record
for a whole Hong Kong office tower.  Eight of 10  groups  in the S&P/TSX fell, led by a 2.1
percent drop in technology shares.  BlackBerry (BB) , formerly known as Research In Motion Ltd.,
slumped 8.5 percent, the biggest drop in the benchmark index, to
C$13.66. Joseph Fersedi, an analyst with ITG Investment
Research, said in a note today U.S. sales of the Z10 smartphone
started poorly and “weakened significantly as the days passed”
citing information from independent dealers.  Another research firm, Detwiler Fenton & Co., said
customers are returning their Z10s because they find the
interface unintuitive. BlackBerry has pinned turnaround hopes on
the new phones, which it began selling in the U.S. in March.  Corus Entertainment plunged 4 percent to C$24.60, headed
for its lowest close in almost three months. The Toronto-based
company’s second-quarter adjusted earnings of 29 Canadian cents
a share fell short of the 36 cents forecast by analysts.  To contact the reporter on this story:
