South Africa  may instigate a
dispute resolution process with the European Union over the
region’s move to ban imports of the country’s citrus fruit,
according to the country’s Department of Agriculture, Forestry
and Fisheries.  The EU’s intention to prohibit South African citrus, which
sometimes carries a fungus called citrus black spot, “is more
stringent than can be scientifically justified,”  DAFF  said in
an e-mailed statement today. “We have gone some way in
following the consensual dispute resolution processes. Because
of the seriousness of this matter, the DAFF together with other
key government departments are considering initiating other
parallel dispute-resolution processes.”  Citrus black spot causes “superficial” blemishes on
fruit, according to the department, and cannot be spread from
picked fruit. South Africa’s citrus industry is valued at about
6.5 billion rand ($733 million), according to the government,
and  Europe  is one of the country’s largest export markets. South
Africa is the world’s biggest exporter of whole oranges and the
largest shipper of grapefruit.  “Based on a growing international body of scientific
evidence” DAFF continues to believe EU requirements are too
rigid, the department said. “Within the international trade
environment, there are several dispute resolution mechanisms
available to address this matter.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
