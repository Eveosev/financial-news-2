OppenheimerFunds Inc. doesn’t have
to face a $700 million lawsuit related to its use of the so-
called AAArdvark arbitrage system, a  New York  state court judge
 ruled .  New York Supreme Court Judge Charles E. Ramos dismissed
fraud claims by TSL USA Inc., Bryant Park Funding LLC and
Liberty Street Funding LLC. The banks, seeking more than $700
million, claimed OppenheimerFunds breached contract agreements
to induce them to continue funding AAArdvark Funding Limited IV,
a special-purpose vehicle, according to an e-mailed statement
from OppenheimerFunds yesterday.  OppenheimerFunds, a New York-based unit of Massachusetts
Mutual Life Insurance Co., argued that any alleged problems with
the management of the AAArdvark vehicles didn’t result in any
losses, according to the statement.  The AAArdvark vehicles were designed to allow large
commercial banks to arbitrage the difference between commercial
paper  interest rates , and the interest rates paid on longer-term
AAA-rated bonds, according to the statement.  In his order dated April 9 and posted yesterday on the
court docket, Ramos permitted the banks to refile breach-of-
contract claims.  Aaron Marks, a lawyer for the banks, didn’t immediately
return a call yesterday after regular business hours seeking
comment on the decision.  The case is TSL (USA) Inc. v. OppenheimerFunds Inc.,
600976/2010, New York Supreme Court ( Manhattan ).  To contact the reporter on this story:
