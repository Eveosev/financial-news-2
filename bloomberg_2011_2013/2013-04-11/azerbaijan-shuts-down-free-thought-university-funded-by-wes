Azerbaijan closed the Free Thought
University, a Western-funded project to promote democracy and
human rights, after the government stepped up pressure on
opposition groups before presidential election in October.  Prosecutors arrived at the university in Baku, the Azeri
capital, without warning, closing it down and sealing its doors,
AFU, as the institute is known, said on its Facebook Inc.  page .  Eldar Sultanov, spokesman for the Prosecutor General’s
Office, didn’t answer telephone calls or e-mailed requests for
comment immediately.  AFU was established in 2009 by the Ol! youth group, which
means “Be” in Azerbaijani, to organize interactive classes on
topics including democracy, human rights and gender equality. It
is funded by the U.S. and U.K. embassies in Baku, the U.S.
Agency for International Development and other Western
organizations.  President  Ilham Aliyev , who succeeded his late father in
disputed elections in 2003, is expected to run for a third term
in office in the Oct. 15 poll.  To contact the reporter on this story:
