Walter Energy Inc. (WLT) , a producer of
metallurgical coal in the U.S. and  Canada , advanced in post-
market trading after reporting steelmaking coal sales increased
17 percent during the first quarter from the year earlier.  Walter shares jumped 5.7 percent to $25.50 at 5:26 p.m. in
New York.  Metallurgical coal sales rose to 2.8 million metric tons in
the first quarter, the Birmingham, Alabama-based company said in
a statement after the close of regular trading today. Average
first-quarter prices “are expected to improve slightly,”
compared with the previous quarter, the company said.  Walter
received $149 a metric ton on average in the fourth quarter, the
company said in February.  Investment adviser Audley Capital Advisors LLP has
nominated five new members to Walter’s board, saying the current
board has taken on too much debt and failed to create
 shareholder value . Shareholders will vote for directors at the
company’s annual meeting on April 25.  The company is scheduled to report first-quarter results on
May 2.  To contact the reporter on this story:
