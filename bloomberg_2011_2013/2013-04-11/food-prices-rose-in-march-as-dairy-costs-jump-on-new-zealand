World food prices  rose in March as
dairy costs jumped on a drought in  New Zealand  that hurt milk
output and as a late spring in Europe delayed a production rise,
the  United Nations ’ Food & Agriculture Organization said.  An index of 55 food items tracked by the FAO advanced 0.8
percent to 212.4 points last month from a restated 210.7 points
in February, with dairy prices gaining the most in more than
three years, the Rome-based FAO wrote in an online  report . The
gauge, which rose to a record 237.9 points in February 2011, is
1.7 percent lower than a year earlier.  Milk collection in New Zealand, the world’s biggest dairy
exporter, fell 16 percent last month, according to  Fonterra
Cooperative Group Ltd (FCG) , as the country suffers its worst drought
in at least 30 years.  “At the root of the price surge is prolonged hot, dry
weather in Oceania which has led to milk production falling off
steeply,” the FAO wrote. “Furthermore, the spring surge in
milk production in  Europe  has been retarded due to unfavorable
weather limiting pasture growth.”  The FAO’s gauge of world dairy prices jumped 11 percent to
225.3 points from 203 the previous month, the highest level
since July 2011 and the biggest jump since November 2009.  The UN agency’s cereal price index slipped 0.5 percent to
244 points from 245.3 points, while the index for cooking oil
declined 2.5 percent to 201.1 points.  An index of sugar prices advanced 1.1 percent to 262 points
from 259.2 points. The index for meat prices declined 2 percent
to 175.7 from 179.2, according to the report.  In a separate report, the FAO cut its outlook for 2012-13
wheat production from its March 7 estimate by 800,000 metric
tons to 661 million tons, while the outlook for coarse grains,
which include corn and barley, was increased by 2.6 million tons
to 1.16 billion tons.  The outlook for the rice crop was lifted by 900,000 tons to
489.5 million tons.  To contact the reporter on this story:
