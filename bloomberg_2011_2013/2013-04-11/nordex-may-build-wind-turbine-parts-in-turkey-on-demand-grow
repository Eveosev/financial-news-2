Nordex SE (NDX1) , a German turbine maker,
may build a rotor-blade manufacturing plant in  Turkey  as it
seeks to gain from growth in power demand in the nation.  The company will decide by next month whether to invest in
the facility, Ibrahim Ozarslan, managing director of its
Turkish unit Nordex Enerji AS, said today in an interview in
Ankara. The plant would produce the first blades next year and
allow Hamburg-based Nordex access to markets such as
Turkmenistan, Azerbaijan and Georgia, he said.  Turkey, which depends on fossil-fuel imports for about 90
percent of its energy needs, has lured international investors
including  General Electric Co. (GE)  and  Siemens AG (SIE)  to its power
industry as the regulator forecasts annual demand growth of 6.3
percent in the next two decades. The nation offers a feed-in
tariff paying premium prices to clean energy, supplemented by an
additional payment for equipment produced domestically.  Nordex is in talks with the Turkish energy ministry over
potential local incentives for any turbine components produced,
Ozarslan said. The Turkish market has “huge potential”, he
said.  The manufacturer also made progress including choosing
buildings, discussions with potential partners and preparing
contracts, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
