A lack of ambitious greenhouse-gas
reduction targets among rich nations is the main barrier to
continued investment in clean energy, according to a project
developer lobby group.  Almost half Project Developers Forum members suspended
construction on emission-reducing projects under the  United
Nations ’ Clean Development Mechanism because prices for the
carbon offsets the installations would generate are too low, the
group said in a statement.  Benchmark front-year UN offsets, known as Certified
Emission Reductions, have tumbled 99 percent from their peak in
July 2008, as demand from the European Union’s emissions-trading
system, the world’s biggest market, slumped amid a financial
crisis.  “Over the past 14 years, the CDM has driven billions of
dollars of investment into low carbon and renewable energy
projects across the developing world, making a significant
contribution to sustainable development,”  Gareth Phillips ,
chairman of the Project Developers Forum, said in an e-mailed
statement. “All this is now under threat as a result of
insufficient mitigation ambition among nations.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
