U.K. stocks  climbed for a fourth
day, putting the FTSE 100 Index on course for the biggest weekly
gain in three months, as a report showed U.S. jobless-benefit
claims fell more than forecast.  Marks & Spencer Group Plc (MKS)  rose the most in three weeks
after posting faster sales growth than analysts had estimated.
 Ashmore Group Plc (ASHM)  rallied the most in more than four years as
assets under management increased.  Man Group Plc (EMG)  jumped 6.8
percent after regulators cut the amount of capital the hedge-
fund manager must hold.  Evraz Plc (EVR)  tumbled the most ever as
 Russia ’s biggest steelmaker paid no final dividend.  The FTSE 100 climbed 28.77 points, or 0.5 percent, to
6,416.14 at the close in London. The benchmark gauge has
advanced 2.7 percent so far this week as Chinese imports beat
forecasts and as U.S. equities surged to a record, trimming the
decline from its March 14 high to 1.7 percent. The broader FTSE
All-Share Index and Ireland’s ISEQ Index each rose 0.6 percent.  “We’ve seen a couple of tough weeks previously, so indices
are grinding higher after the correction,” said Veronika Pechlaner, who helps manage about $1.5 billion as investment
manager at  Jersey , Channel Islands-based Ashburton Ltd. “U.K.
equities have pretty much followed the global markets in this
trend, and we’ve seen stocks rise over the last couple of days.
We saw weakness in share prices after the profit taking at the
end of last month, and we’re rebounding from that.”  The volume of shares changing hands in companies on the
FTSE 100 today was 24 percent lower than the average of the last
30 days, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Jobless Claims  In the U.S.,  initial jobless claims  slipped to 346,000 in
the week ended April 6 from a revised 388,000 in the previous
period, the Labor Department said. Economists in a Bloomberg
News survey had projected a drop to 360,000.  Marks & Spencer rallied 4.3 percent to 400.4 pence after
the U.K.’s largest clothing retailer said food revenue climbed 4
percent in the 13 weeks ended March 30, beating the 2.5 percent
median forecast of analysts in a Bloomberg survey. That’s the
biggest gain since March 18.  Ashmore surged 13 percent to 401 pence, the most since
October 2008. The fund manager that invests in  emerging markets 
said assets under management increased to $77.7 billion as of
March 31 from $71 billion on Dec. 31.  Man Group jumped 6.8 percent to 104.3 pence, the largest
advance since September. The world’s largest biggest publicly
traded hedge-fund manager said the Financial Conduct Authority
confirmed a change in its regulatory status, reducing the
capital it must hold.  Hays, Xaar  Hays Plc soared 8.4 percent to 101.2 pence, the highest
since July 2011, after the recruitment company said full-year
operating profit will be at the upper end of a range of
analysts’ projections.  Estimates (HAS)  in a Bloomberg survey range
from 116 million pounds ($179 million) to 122 million pounds.  Xaar Plc (XAR) , the U.K. maker of industrial ink-jet printer
heads and inks, surged 17 percent to 490 pence, the highest
price in 13 years. The company said first-quarter sales were
“significantly” higher than the year-before period and it
forecast “strong growth” in profit this year.  Evraz slid 11 percent to 185.8 pence, the most since the
Russian steelmaker began trading in London in November 2011. The
board of directors recommended paying shareholders no final
dividend, citing the deteriorating market and a weaker second-
half performance.  Eurasian Natural Resources Corp. Plc declined 4.7 percent
to 257.1 pence as the Financial Times reported that Chairman
Mehmet Dalman, who is leading an internal probe into fraud
allegations over the company’s assets in Kazakhstan, may leave
after disagreements with other company executives. The newspaper
cited a person it didn’t identify.  “I am committed to my current role as chairman of ENRC and
continue to have a constructive working relationship with all
executive team members,” Dalman said in a statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
