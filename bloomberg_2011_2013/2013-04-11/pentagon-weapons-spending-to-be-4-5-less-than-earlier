Pentagon weapons spending through
2017 will be $20.6 billion, or 4.5 percent, less than projected
a year ago for the same period, according to internal figures.  The Defense Department’s acquisition plan calls for
spending $434.9 billion on weapons in the four years from 2014
to 2017, according to Pentagon projections obtained today by
 Bloomberg News . Last year, the plan anticipated $455.5 billion
for those years.  The projection will be included in the Pentagon
comptroller’s annual “ Green Book ” of past and planned defense
spending that will be released this week in the aftermath of the
$526.6 billion  defense budget  for fiscal 2014 that President
 Barack Obama  proposed to Congress yesterday.  The comptroller’s annual report is reviewed by analysts and
by planners for defense contractors seeking insight on the
Pentagon’s investment trends. In a time of defense spending
cuts, word that weapons spending won’t decline more deeply may
be good news for companies such as  Lockheed Martin Corp. (LMT) ,  Boeing
Co. (BA) ,  Raytheon Co. (RTN)  and  General Dynamics Corp. (GD)   The planned procurement increases take into account
increased purchases of Lockheed’s F-35 fighter, the Pentagon’s
costliest program. The  Air Force  wants to increase its F-35
purchases to 60 by 2018 from 19 next year, and the Navy wants to
ramp up to 40 aircraft by 2018 from 10 next year.  ‘On Track’  The estimated cost for a fleet of 2,443 F-35 fighters has
climbed to $395.7 billion, a 70 percent increase since 2001.
Pentagon officials have prodded Bethesda, Maryland-based
Lockheed and its subcontractors to improve performance and
reduce costs.  Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel said today in testimony
before the House Armed Services Committee that the F-35 program
is “on track” after “many years of pain and billions and
billions” of dollars spent.  Hagel, who was briefed for 90 minutes yesterday by the F-35
project manager, said costs per aircraft are “coming down.”  As with the Pentagon’s budget for next year, the four-year
weapons projection doesn’t include the automatic budget cuts
known as sequestration that are set to reduce Pentagon spending
by $500 billion from over nine years.  Obama’s budget assumes Congress will accept his plan to
replace sequestration with a combination of revenue increases
and spending cuts. His approach would reduce  defense spending  by
as much as $120 billion after 2018.  Annual Projections  The proposed budget released yesterday calls for spending
$99.3 billion on weapons in fiscal 2014, a reduction of only
$4.9 billion from a projection released in February 2012.  Similarly, the $106.2 billion for weapons projected for
fiscal 2015 is about $6 billion less than anticipated last year.
The $111.9 billion projected for fiscal 2016 is $4.4 billion
less, and the $117.5 billion for fiscal 2017 is $5.3 billion
less.  The latest comptroller’s report adds a projection of $123.8
billion for weapons in fiscal 2018.  Research and development spending under the new plan is
projected to increase by $4.7 billion through 2017 from the
$271.4 billion estimated last year. It includes $8.7 billion for
continued development of the Air Force’s Long-Range Strike
Bomber.  Major General Ed Bolton, the Air Force’s budget director,
 told  reporters yesterday that the bomber program “would be
big” in the service’s rebalance to  Asia  that’s part of the
Pentagon’s defense strategy.  ‘Highest-Priority’  “This is one of highest-priority programs for the Air
Force and budget figures bear that out,”  Byron Callan , an
analyst with Washington-based Capital Alpha Partners LLC, said
in an e-mailed statement.  Callan said he was “still not clear who will ultimately
build these but it is a very important program opportunity for
Boeing, Lockheed Martin” and  Northrop Grumman Corp. (NOC) , he said.  Similarly, the Army’s program to develop and field a new
Ground Combat Vehicle benefits from the research boost. Research
and development spending would increase to $953 million in
fiscal 2015, up from $592 million requested next year.  The Army’s total planned request through 2018, including
production starting in 2018, is estimated at about $4 billion,
according to new service figures. The Army wants to buy about
1,748 vehicles at $29 billion through 2030 when priced in fiscal
2013 dollars. The program is in initial development.  To contact the reporter on this story:
