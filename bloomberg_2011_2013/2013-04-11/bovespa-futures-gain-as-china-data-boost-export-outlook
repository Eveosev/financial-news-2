The Bovespa index snapped a three-
day rally as a report showing retail sales unexpectedly dropped
in February rekindled concern that Brazil’s economic recovery
will falter.  Homebuilder  MRV Engenharia & Participacoes SA (MRVE3)  led losses by
companies that sell in the local market.  Cia. Hering (HGTX3)  was the
worst performer among retailers. Oil services provider  Lupatech
SA (LUPA3)  tumbled after missing a $6.79 million bond payment.  The Bovespa fell 0.9 percent to 55,683.33 at 10:35 a.m. in
Sao Paulo. Fifty-nine stocks dropped on the gauge while six
advanced. The real climbed 0.1 percent to 1.9735 per dollar.  Retail sales data signaled that Brazil’s economic growth
slowed in the first quarter and added to concern that the
recovery is still sluggish, according to Roman Goossens, an
economist at Banco Bradesco SA’s brokerage unit. “In the last
few months, retail sales seem to have been hit by high
inflation,” he wrote in a report today.  Brazil’s retail sales fell 0.2 percent in February from a
year earlier, the national statistics agency reported today. The
median forecast of 27 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg was for a
3.5 percent increase. Sales declined 0.4 percent from the
previous month.  The Getulio Vargas Foundation also reported today that its
IGP-M inflation index of wholesale, construction and consumer
prices rose 0.42 percent from March 21 to March 31, the fastest
pace since a 0.50 percent increase in late November.  MRV fell 3 percent to 9.49 reais. Hering lost 1.6 percent
to 38.26 reais. Lupatech sank 6.3 percent to 1.33 reais.  To contact the reporter on this story:
