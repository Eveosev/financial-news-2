Sugar fell for the first time in
New York this week on signs bottlenecks at ports in leading
producer  Brazil  have eased just as the harvest is set to start.
Cocoa and arabcia coffee advanced.  The amount of sugar awaiting loading at ports in Brazil
fell 6.6 percent over the past week, according to Williams
Servicos Maritimos Ltda. As many as 764,053 metric tons were
waiting to be loaded onto ships at the ports of Recife, Maceio,
Paranagua and Santos, the country’s biggest, according to an e-
mail from the Recife, Brazil-based shipping agency. That’s a
sign logistical constraints are easing, said Jerome Jourquin,
head of agricultural commodity derivatives at Aurel BGC.  “There is a consensus to say that the sugar situation is
bearish even if the logistic problems had offered a temporary
support, especially on spreads,” Paris-based Jourquin said by
e-mail today. “The main mid-term target remains 16 cents a
pound.”  Raw sugar for July delivery fell 0.5 percent to 17.80 cents
a pound by 7:02 a.m. on ICE Futures U.S. in  New York . It rose
0.9 percent yesterday. White sugar for August delivery was down
0.4 percent to $492.70 a ton on NYSE Liffe in  London .  Sugar production in Brazil’s center south, the main growing
region, will be a record 39.2 million tons this season, the
government estimates. That is higher than the 34 million to 35.2
million tons forecast by a Bloomberg survey of six mill owners
that make up for a third of the areas’ supply. Harvesting there
is set to start this month.  The  premium  white sugar commands over the raw variety fell
21 percent over three weeks, indicating demand is slowing and
availability is increasing as millers in  Thailand , the second-
biggest exporter, convert more raw sweetener into the white
variety, Tom McNeill, a director at Green Pool Commodity
Specialists Pty. said by phone from  Brisbane ,  Australia  today.  Arabica coffee for delivery in July rose 0.2 percent to
$1.386 a pound on ICE. Robusta coffee for delivery in July slid
0.2 percent to $2,028 a ton on NYSE Liffe.  Cocoa for July delivery gained 0.7 percent to $2,247 a ton
in New York. Cocoa for July delivery rose 0.3 at 1,487 pounds
($2,288) a ton in London.  To contact the reporter on this story:
