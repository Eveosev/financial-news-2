Serbia halted talks with  Delhaize
Group SA (DELB)  of  Belgium  on the sale of the state’s 16 percent stake
in local retailer C Market until investigators complete a probe
into the Serbian company’s privatization.  The authorities are investigating C Market’s original sale
in 2005 on the Belgrade Stock Exchange and talks with Delhaize,
the sole bidder for the state holding can be frozen for as many
as 180 days, the Serbian Privatization Agency said in an e-
mailed statement today.  Following criticism from the European Parliament, the
government is reviewing the sale of 24 companies, including C
Market, acquired by a company owned by Serbia’s richest man,
Miroslav Miskovic. Miskovic was arrested in December and has
been in detention as the prosecutors search for evidence to
raise an indictment. He says he is innocent.  Delhaize, the owner of Food Lion supermarkets, began talks
with  Serbia  on Feb. 8, offering 9.7 million euros ($12.7
million), or 300 euros per share, to boost its holding to more
than 91 percent of C Market, one of the assets it got through
the purchase of Delta Maxi Group, the country’s biggest grocery
chain, for 932.5 million euros in 2011.  To contact the reporter on this story:
