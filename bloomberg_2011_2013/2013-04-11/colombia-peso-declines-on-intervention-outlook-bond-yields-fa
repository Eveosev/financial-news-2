Colombia’s peso fell to a one-week
low on speculation the government will announce measures next
week that will lead to further declines in the currency.  The peso depreciated 0.2 percent to 1,822.35 per U.S.
dollar at 9:39 a.m. in Bogota, the weakest level on a closing
basis since April 4. The currency, which strengthened 9.7
percent in 2012, has dropped 3.1 percent this year.  President Juan Manuel Santos will present a stimulus plan
on April 15 that includes additional measures to stem gains in
the peso, Finance Minister Mauricio Cardenas said last week.
While he has said that he expects the peso to weaken to 1,900
and wants to “get there quickly,” he has ruled out capital
controls because he said they aren’t effective.  “Investors are positioning themselves for what may come
out on Monday,” said Diana Guiza, an analyst at Bogota-based
brokerage Corredores Asociados. “Given that the usual tools
have already been used and since capital controls have been
ruled out, whatever it is will be pretty novel.”  The central bank said Jan. 28 it will buy at least $30
million a day, bringing purchases in the foreign-exchange market
to $3 billion from February to May. Cardenas has also said that
Colombia will buy $1 billion of U.S. currency to pay for
interest and principal on foreign bonds coming due this year in
addition to the $1 billion it will purchase for its oil-
stability fund.  Yields on Colombia’s peso bonds maturing in 2024 fell three
basis point, or 0.03 percentage point, to 4.96 percent,
according to the central bank. The price rose 0.262 centavo to
142.773 centavos per peso.  To contact the reporter on this story:
