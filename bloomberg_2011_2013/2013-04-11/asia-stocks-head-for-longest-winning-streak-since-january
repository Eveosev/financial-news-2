Asian  stocks  rose, with the
regional benchmark index poised for the biggest gain in seven
months, as the yen neared 100 to the dollar after the  Bank of
Japan (8301)  said it will maintain stimulus and loan growth in China
topped estimates.  Toyota Motor Corp., the world’s largest carmaker, added 5.8
percent even as it announced a recall for faulty airbags.  Sharp
Corp. (6753)  jumped 7.9 percent in  Tokyo  as the Nikkei newspaper
reported profit at the electronics manufacturer will exceed it
forecasts. GS Engineering & Construction Corp. slumped 15
percent in Seoul after reporting an unexpected loss.  The  MSCI Asia Pacific Index (MXAP)  rose for a fourth day, gaining
1.5 percent to 137.98 as of 5:11 p.m. in Tokyo, with about two
stocks increasing for each that fell. All 10 industry groups on
the gauge advanced. The measure, headed for the highest closing
level since August 2011, climbed the past five months on
speculation  Japan  would unleash more stimulus and amid signs the
 U.S. economy  is recovering.  “The odds are clearly stacked in favor of a continued
rally in Japan,” said Mikio Kumada, Hong Kong-based global
strategist for LGT Capital Management, which oversees more than
$25 billion. The BOJ “has essentially scrapped existing rules
and programs, replacing them with straightforward and expanded
open-market purchases. This bold economic-policy shift has the
potential to sustain the rebound.”  Regional Gauges  Japan’s Nikkei 225 Stock Average rose 2 percent to the
highest closing level since July 2008 while the Topix Index
capped a  seven-day , 16 percent advance, biggest over that period
of time since March 2009.  Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 Index gained 0.8 percent even as
the country’s unemployment rate unexpectedly rose to 5.6
percent. New Zealand’s NZX 50 Index slipped 0.2 percent.  South Korea’s  Kospi index  gained 0.7 percent as the  Bank of
Korea  kept borrowing costs unchanged for a sixth month,
resisting pressure from the government for a reduction even as
North Korean threats of war threaten to undermine confidence.  Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index gained 0.3 percent and China’s
Shanghai Composite slid 0.3 percent as China’s new local-
currency loans last month exceeded economists’ forecasts.  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index yesterday traded at 13.8 times
average estimated earnings compared with 14.3 for the Standard &
Poor’s 500 Index and 12.6 times for the Stoxx Europe 600 Index,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Bank of Japan Governor Haruhiko Kuroda said the central
bank will take all steps necessary to meet a 2 percent inflation
target even as he indicated policy adjustments are unlikely
every month. The  European Central Bank  will keep rates low and
continue injecting liquidity into the banking system, ECB
governing council member  Christian Noyer  said.  Yen Weakens  “The biggest commitment is that we will take all necessary
measures,” Kuroda told reporters in Tokyo yesterday, six days
after announcing unprecedented stimulus to double the monetary
base over two years. The central bank will tomorrow offer to buy
Japanese  government bonds  with a maturity between five years and
10 years in addition to those with more than 10 years to
maturity.  The yen fell to 99.73 per dollar, near the weakest level in
four years. The prospect of the currency weakening to 130 per
dollar isn’t unreasonable, Jonathan Beinner, of Goldman Sachs
Group Inc. in New York, said on Bloomberg Television.  Japanese exporters climbed.  Canon Inc. (7751) , a Japanese camera
maker that gets 80 percent of sales abroad, gained 4.2 percent
to 3,695 yen and Toyota added 5.8 percent to 5,640 yen.  Yamaha
Motor Co. (7272) , a motorcycle maker that gets almost 90 percent of
sales outside Japan, advanced 4.4 percent to 1,398 yen. A
declining yen boosts overseas earnings at Japanese firms when
repatriated.  Cars Recalled  Toyota, Honda Motor Co. and Nissan Motor Co. recalled at
least 3 million vehicles worldwide for defects in airbags made
by Takata Corp. Shares of Takata  slumped  9 percent to 1,819 yen.  Securities companies rose for a 10th day, posting the
largest gains on Japan’s broader Topix Index. Nomura Holdings
Inc., the nation’s biggest brokerage, increased 8.3 percent to
760 yen.  Daiwa Securities Group Inc. (8601) , the No. 2, climbed 4.9
percent to 807 yen.  Sharp soared 7.9 percent to 313 yen. The company will
report operating profit for the period October to March of about
20 billion yen ($201 million), exceeding its 13.8 billion yen
forecast, the Nikkei reported without citing anyone.  Futures on the  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index (SPX)  were little
changed. The measure yesterday climbed 1.2 percent, to a record,
as a report showed China’s imports grew, Japan reiterated its
stimulus plans and investors speculated earnings will beat
estimates.  Fed Minutes  Several Federal Reserve officials said the U.S. central
bank should taper its bond-buying program later this year and
stop it by the end of 2013 if labor-market conditions improve,
according to minutes of its March meeting released yesterday.
Fed Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said on April 8 that economic
conditions were far from where he would like them to be.  Taiwan’s Taiex Index advanced 1.4 percent, led by  Taiwan
Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (2330)  The world’s largest contract
producer of chips surged 3.3 percent to NT$101.50, the most in
more than four months, as first-quarter sales of NT$132.8
billion ($4.4 billion) exceeded analysts’ estimate of NT$129.1
billion. The company projects that sales will rise at a
percentage in the teens this year, Chief Executive Officer
 Morris Chang  said on April 9 in  San Jose ,  California .  GS Engineering fell 15 percent to 42,000 won after the
South Korean builder reported a 386.1 billion won ($342 million)
loss for the first quarter.  To contact the reporter on this story:
