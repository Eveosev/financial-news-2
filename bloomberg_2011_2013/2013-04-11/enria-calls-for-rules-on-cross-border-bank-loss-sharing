The European Union needs “clear
and binding criteria” for sharing losses when cross-border
banks fail, European Banking Authority Chairman Andrea Enria
said today.  Enria called on the EU to avoid “exclusive reliance” on
national budgets and nationally oriented bailouts for banking
woes, according to an article prepared for a conference in
Dublin today that was obtained by  Bloomberg News . That has hurt
cross-border banking activity as regulators and banks have
retreated within national borders, he said.  The Brussels-based European Commission is developing plans
for a single resolution authority to handle  bank failures  within
the  euro zone  and other nations that sign on for oversight by
the  European Central Bank , which is due to become the currency
bloc’s bank supervisor next year.  Enria urged the EU to broaden the resolution plans to
include all 27 EU nations, including those like the U.K. that
neither use the euro nor plan to join the ECB oversight regime.
He also said the resolution plan needs a unified backstop to
prevent a patchwork of national systems from hampering financial
stability efforts.  If the single resolution mechanism is more limited, “there
is a risk that some degree of segmentations remains in the
single market, as a consequence of the different underlying
safety nets on which European cross-border banks would rely,”
said Enria. The London-based EBA coordinates disputes among bank
supervisors and sets technical standards for EU financial
regulation.  To contact the reporters on this story:
