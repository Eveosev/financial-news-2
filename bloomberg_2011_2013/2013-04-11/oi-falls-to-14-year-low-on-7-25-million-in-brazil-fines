Oi SA (OIBR4) ,  Brazil ’s largest landline
carrier, slumped to a 14-year low in its second day of declines
after Brazil fined the phone company 14.3 million reais ($7.25
million) for regulatory violations.  Shares tumbled 3.7 percent to 5.68 reais at 5:18 p.m. in
Sao Paulo. A close at that level would be the lowest since April
1999. The benchmark Bovespa  index  dropped 1.4 percent.  Anatel, the telecommunications regulator, fined Oi for
infractions including charging clients incorrectly, according to
yesterday’s official gazette. Oi’s press office didn’t reply to
a request for comment when contacted by phone by Bloomberg News.  “It’s not a heavy fine, but it adds to the negative
sentiment,” Felipe Rocha, an analyst at brokerage Omar Camargo,
said by phone from Curitiba, Brazil. “When you look at the set
of fines the company has been given, you get a sense things may
not be going in the right direction.”  In 2011 and 2012, Oi was fined 122 times, compared with 33
for Tim Participacoes SA and 26 for Telefonica Brasil SA,
according to Anatel.  To contact the reporter on this story:
