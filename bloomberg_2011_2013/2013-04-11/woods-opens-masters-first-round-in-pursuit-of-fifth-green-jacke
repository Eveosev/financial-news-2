Sergio Garcia  is tied for the lead
early in the second round of golf’s Masters Tournament as he
pursues his first win in 58 major-championship starts.  Garcia parred his first two holes at Augusta National Golf
Club after shooting a 6-under-par 66 yesterday to match his best
score in 15 Masters appearances. The 33-year-old Spaniard is
tied with Australia’s Marc Leishman, the 2009 U.S. PGA Tour
Rookie of the Year who begins his second round later today.  Garcia’s best finish at the Masters is a tie for fourth in
2004, and England’s Lee Westwood is the only other golfer in the
field this week to play in more majors (60) without a win.  Second-round play in Augusta, Georgia, began this morning
under a cloudy sky with a 30 percent chance of showers. Winds
are about 10 to 15 miles per hour (16 to 24 kilometers per
hour), with gusts predicted to reach 20 mph later today.  Trevor Immelman , the 2008 Masters winner from South Africa,
is among players at 4-under par. Immelman got within one shot of
the lead with a birdie at the par-5 second hole today before a
bogey at the par-4 fifth.  Gonzalo Fernandez-Castano of Spain is also 4-under with
Americans  Dustin Johnson ,  Matt Kuchar  and  Rickie Fowler , and
Masters rookie David Lynn of England.  Fred Couples , the 1992
Masters winner who opened with a 68 yesterday, is among those at
3 under with a bogey on the first hole today.  Woods Start  Four-time Masters champion  Tiger Woods  shot a 2-under-par
70 in the first round and is scheduled to tee off in today’s
next-to-last group at 1:41 p.m. Woods is pursuing his fourth
victory of the season and first win in a major since claiming
the 14th of his career at the 2008 U.S. Open.  China’s Tianlang Guan, who at 14 is the youngest
participant in a major in 148 years, drew one of the biggest
galleries among the morning starters. The eighth-grader, who
earned a spot in the tournament by winning the Asia-Pacific
Amateur Championship in November, started his round with three
straight pars after a 1-over-par 73 yesterday, the best among
the field’s six amateurs.  Three-time Masters champion  Phil Mickelson  started his
second round at 1-under par, while Rory McIlroy, second to Woods
in the Official World Golf Ranking, is even par.  Defending champion Bubba Watson is scheduled to tee off at
1:30 p.m. after a first-round 3-over-par 75.  To contact the reporter on this story:
