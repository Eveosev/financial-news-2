Warren Buffett ’s  Berkshire Hathaway
Inc. (BRK/A)  and  Jorge Paulo Lemann ’s 3G Capital said Bernardo Hees will
become chief executive officer of HJ Heinz Co., the ketchup
maker being bought by the billionaire investors.  Hees, 43, has been CEO of Burger King Worldwide Inc. since
2010, the companies said today in a statement distributed by
Business Wire. He is also a partner of 3G capital.  Berkshire and 3G reached a deal in February to buy Heinz
for about $23 billion, ending the independence of the maker of
condiments and Ore-Ida potato snacks. 3G acquired Burger King in
2010 and took the fast-food chain public last year.  “Bernardo is a proven executive with an unparalleled track
record of delivering results,” Alex Behring, managing partner
at 3G Capital, said in the statement. “His combination
of experience, leadership skills and broad understanding of the
food industry make him the ideal leader to drive the next
chapter in Heinz’s storied history.”  Bill Johnson , 64, who has led Heinz since 1998, will remain
chairman and CEO until the deal is completed, according to the
statement.  “3G Capital and Berkshire Hathaway expect to discuss
with Mr. Johnson his interest in a continuing role with the
company post closure,” according to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
