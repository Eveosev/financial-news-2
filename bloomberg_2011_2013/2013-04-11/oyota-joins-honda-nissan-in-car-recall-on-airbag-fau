Takata Corp. (7312)  faces its biggest
recall crisis in almost two decades after defective airbag
inflators led  Toyota Motor Corp. (7203) ,  Honda Motor Co. (7267)  and  Nissan
Motor Co. (7201)  to call back more than 3 million vehicles.  The Japanese safety-gear producer made the products from
2000 to 2002, said Hideyuki Matsumoto, a Takata spokesman. He
declined to comment on its customers, who had identified the
supplier. According to  Toyota , malfunctioning inflators could
cause the airbag to deploy abnormally during a crash.  Takata  fell  as much as 6.7 percent today, following a 9
percent tumble yesterday after  Japan ’s three biggest carmakers
made the announcements. It’s the largest recall involving Takata
since 1995, when several automakers called back almost 9 million
vehicles to replace faulty seat belts made by the Tokyo-based
company -- a record for the  auto industry  at the time.  The recalls “will likely have a negative impact on near-
term earnings at Takata,” Hisahiro Yamaoka, an auto parts
analyst at Nomura Holdings Inc., wrote in a report yesterday.
The brokerage cut its rating on the company to neutral from buy.  Takata dropped 2.3 percent to 1,777 yen as of 10:23 a.m. in
Tokyo trading, compared with a 0.5 percent decline for the
Nikkei 225 Stock Average.  Toyota fell 0.5 percent and Honda lost 0.3 percent, both
snapping two days of gains. Nissan rose 0.3 percent.  Mazda Motor
Corp. (7261) , which is also recalling vehicles, slipped 0.6 percent.  Other Recalls  Matsumoto confirmed the recall is Takata’s biggest since
1995. More recently, in 2010, Honda recalled 437,763 vehicles to
inspect for faulty airbag modules supplied by Takata.  Toyota is recalling 1.73 million vehicles globally and
Honda about 1.14 million units, the companies said yesterday.
Nissan may call back as many as 480,000 vehicles worldwide, and
Mazda said it recalled 45,463 units.  “The involved vehicles are equipped with front-passenger
airbag inflators which could have been assembled with improperly
manufactured propellant wafers,” Toyota said in a statement.
“Improperly manufactured propellant wafers could cause the
inflator to rupture and the front passenger airbag to deploy
abnormally in the event of a crash.”  Toyota spokeswoman Shino Yamada said five incidents of
malfunctions have been reported, though there were no accidents
or injuries. Affected vehicles include the Corolla and Camry,
and were built between November 2000 and March 2004, she said.  Quick Response  For Toyota, the world’s largest automaker, it’s the second
time this year that the company has announced a recall involving
more than 1 million vehicles. Last year, Toyota announced a
recall of 7.43 million units in October, followed by one
involving 2.77 million vehicles the next month.  “After the Toyota unintended-acceleration debacle,
automakers have been quick to issue recalls and so there have
been a flurry of them in recent years,” said Michelle Krebs, an
analyst with researcher Edmunds.com. “As a result, consumers
may be tone deaf to them, but they should take seriously any
recall -- like this one -- that is related to an important
safety feature, especially an airbag, which involves
pyrotechnics.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
