Gordon Kwan , the most-accurate
forecaster of Brent oil prices in the eight quarters through
March 31, will leave Mirae Asset Securities Ltd. in  Hong Kong  at
the end of June.  Kwan, the company’s head of regional energy research,
confirmed his departure in an e-mailed response to questions
today, without specifying his future plans. Mirae, the brokerage
affiliate of South Korea’s second-largest money manager, will
eliminate half of its 38 jobs in Hong Kong as demand for broking
services falls, Choi Jong Hyun, the company’s Seoul-based
spokesman, said in an e-mailed response to questions yesterday.  Kwan predicted the price of Brent traded in London with an
average margin of error of 6.2 percent in the past eight
quarters, the most accurate among analysts ranked by Bloomberg.
He was closest for estimates of West Texas Intermediate in the
eight quarters ended June 30, 2011, a previous ranking showed.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
