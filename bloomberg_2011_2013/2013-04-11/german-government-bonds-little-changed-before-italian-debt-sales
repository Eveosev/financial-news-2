Ireland’s 10-year  government bonds 
advanced for a ninth day, pushing the  yield  to the lowest since
December 2006, amid speculation the nation may receive an
extension to its bailout loans tomorrow.  Italian 10-year yields were seven basis points from their
lowest in six weeks after borrowing costs fell at an offering of
7.2 billion euros ($9.5 billion) of debt, including new three-
year notes. Portuguese two-year securities were little changed
as Moody’s Investors Service said a Constitutional Court ruling
last week that blocks key austerity measures was a hurdle to the
nation meeting the conditions of its rescue package.  “Ireland should get an extension of debt interest payments
given the progress it’s made,” said  Nick Stamenkovic , a
strategist at RIA Capital Markets Ltd. in Edinburgh. “ Portugal 
is a bit up in the air because of the constitutional decision.
Portugal could continue to struggle near term.”  Irish 10-year bond yields dropped two basis points, or 0.02
percentage point, to 3.89 percent at 4:52 p.m. London time. It
fell to 3.88 percent, the lowest since Dec. 22, 2006. The price
of the 3.9 percent security maturing March 2023 rose 0.145, or
1.45 euros per 1,000-euro face amount, to 100.045.  Italian  10-year yields  rose two basis points to 4.33
percent. The rate reached 4.26 percent on April 8, the lowest
since Feb. 25. Yields on similar-maturity Spanish bonds dropped
as much as three basis points to 4.61 percent, the  lowest  since
Nov. 17, 2010, before being three basis points higher at 4.67
percent.  Political Decision  Finance Minister  Michael Noonan  told reporters in Dublin
today that he hoped for a political decision tomorrow on an
extension to Ireland’s bailout loans, even as he said a formal
decision is not possible. European finance ministers are due to
meet in the Irish capital tomorrow.  Portugal’s court ruling makes it more difficult for the
country to deliver necessary fiscal adjustment and complete its
seventh quarterly program review, Moody’s said.  The yield on the country’s two-year notes was at 2.92
percent.  Italy  sold 4 billion euros of new 2.25 percent 2016 notes
at 2.29 percent, from the 2.48 percent on similar-maturity debt
allotted on March 13. The Rome-based Treasury also allotted 1.67
billion euros of 2028 bonds and 1.5 billion euros of floating-
rate securities maturing in 2017.  EFSF Sale  European governments and the European Financial Stability
Facility have sold 31.7 billion euros of bonds and notes this
week. That’s the most for any week this year, according to
Alexander Aldinger, an interest-rate strategist at Commerzbank
AG in  Frankfurt .  “Yields in Italy continue to grind toward their more
reasonable fundamental values,” said  Michael Markovich , head of
global interest-rate research at Credit Suisse Group AG in
Zurich. Credit Suisse recommends investors buy Italian debt of
all maturities, he said.  German 10-year  bund yields  were little changed at 1.30
percent after climbing nine basis points over the past three
days. The rate fell to 1.20 percent on April 5, the lowest level
since July 24.  The annual inflation rate in  Germany , calculated using a
harmonized European Union method, held at 1.8 percent March,
unchanged from February, the Federal Statistics Office in
Wiesbaden said. The outcome was in line with the median estimate
of 22 economists in a Bloomberg News survey and confirmed a
preliminary figure released on April 2.  Italian government bonds returned 2.1 percent this year
through yesterday, according to indexes compiled by Bloomberg
and the European Federation of Financial Analysts Societies.
German government bonds rose 0.5 percent and Spanish bonds
earned 5.4 percent, the indexes show.  To contact the reporters on this story:
