Germany  had its fourth-coldest
March since the start of the 20th century, meteorological office
Deutscher Wetterdienst reported.  Temperatures last month averaged 0.1 degree Celsius (32.2
degrees Fahrenheit) in Germany, 4.2 degrees below the average
temperature in the 30 years through 2010, the office wrote in a
 report  on its website.  Plant growth in Germany, the European Union’s second-
largest wheat and rapeseed grower behind  France , has been
delayed by cold conditions. German winter wheat was at the leaf-
development stage known as tillering at the end of March, while
last year wheat in most of the country was at the grain-head
stage, data from the EU’s crop-monitoring service show.  “In Germany, March 2013 was very cold, rather dry, and
slightly above the long-term mean in sunshine duration,” the
weather office wrote.  The month was the coldest March since 1881 after 1883,
1987, 1958 and 1917, Deutscher Wetterdienst said.  Average precipitation in Germany amounted to 33.4
millimeters (1.32 inches) last month, 48 percent below normal
for the 1981-2010 period, while an average 121.3 hours of
sunshine was 6.6 percent higher than the long-term average.  To contact the reporter on this story:
