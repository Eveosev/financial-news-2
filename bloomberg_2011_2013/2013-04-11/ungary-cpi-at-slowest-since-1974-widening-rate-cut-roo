Hungarian  consumer prices  dropped
to the lowest level in almost 39 years, widening room for the
central bank to keep cutting already record-low  interest rates .  The inflation rate fell to 2.2 percent in March, compared
with 2.8 percent in the previous month, the statistics office in
Budapest said. That was the slowest since September 1974 and
less than the 2.5 percent median estimate of 19 economists in a
Bloomberg survey. Prices rose 0.3 percent from February.  The Magyar Nemzeti Bank reduced the  two-week deposit rate 
by a quarter-point for an eighth month in March to a record-low
5 percent. Policy makers said data pointed to a “turning
point” in inflation, with price-growth poised to decelerate
further below their 3 percent target, according to the minutes
of the March 26 meeting published yesterday.  Central bank Governor Gyorgy Matolcsy, who took office last
month after serving as economy minister since 2010, has vowed to
use monetary policy to help end the second recession in four
years. The Monetary Council will “only consider a further
reduction in the policy rate if medium-term inflationary
pressures remained moderate and the uncertainty surrounding
financial-market developments diminished,” according to the
minutes.  The forint strengthened 0.1 percent to 296.43 per euro by
9:40 a.m. in Budapest. It has gained 1.8 percent in the past
month, the sixth-best performance among more than 20 emerging-
market currencies tracked by Bloomberg.  Inflation is slowing after the government ordered a 10
percent cut in household energy prices this year. The prices of
electricity, gas and other fuels dropped 8.1 percent from a year
ago, according to today’s statement. The cost of clothing and
consumer durable goods also fell while the price growth of
“motor fuels and other lubricants” slowed to 1.5 percent from
a year ago, compared with 2.6 percent in February. Food prices
rose 3.4 percent compared with 4.1 percent the previous month.  Core inflation , which strips out volatile energy costs,
rose 3.4 percent in March from a year ago and 0.2 percent from
February.  To contact the reporter on this story:
