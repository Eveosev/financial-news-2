Geothermal energy capacity will
more than double by 2030 as developing economies including
 Indonesia , Chile and Kenya take advantage of natural resources,
according to Bloomberg New Energy Finance.  Global capacity is estimated to reach 28.3 gigawatts in 62
markets in 2030, compared with 11.4 gigawatts in 25 markets last
year,  Mark Taylor , a New Energy Finance analyst, said today at
the U.S. and International Geothermal Energy Finance Forum in
 New York .  “Geothermal is being seen as a development tool now, not
just a niche market,” Taylor said. “It can be used as a driver
of economic growth.”  Capacity in Indonesia, Southeast Asia’s fastest-growing
economy, is estimated to more than triple to 5.6 gigawatts and
account for 20 percent of output, becoming the world’s largest
market. It ranked third in 2012 at 1.3 gigawatts.  Chile will increase to 1.9 gigawatts from none and Kenya to
3.5 gigawatts from 202 megawatts, according to data compiled by
London-based New Energy Finance.  Geothermal energy uses naturally occurring hot water on the
surface or underground to power a heat pump or turbine for
electricity generation.  The U.S. was the largest market in 2012 with about 3
gigawatts, approximately 27 percent of global capacity, followed
by the  Philippines  at 1.7 gigawatts at 15 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
