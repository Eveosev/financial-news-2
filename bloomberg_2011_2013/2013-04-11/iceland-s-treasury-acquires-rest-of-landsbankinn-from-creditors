Iceland’s Treasury has acquired an
18.7 percent stake in Landsbankinn hf from the creditors of
failed Landsbanki Islands hf in exchange for a contingent 92
billion kronur ($777 million) bond denominated in euros.  “Today the Treasury is handed a very valuable part of
Landsbankinn without paying for it,” Steinthor Palsson, chief
executive officer of Landsbankinn, said in an e-mailed
statement. “The book value of the Treasury’s stake has
appreciated considerably and the gain after the cost of
financing is 55 billion kronur.”  Landsbankinn was created in 2008 from the domestic
operations of Landsbanki Islands after it failed in October the
same year. Landsbanki’s collapse threatened to wipe out the
savings of 350,000 U.K. and Dutch depositors, before their
governments stepped in to cover the losses. Iceland estimated
proceeds from the bank’s liquidated assets would be big enough
to compensate the two countries.  “The bank’s assets are become ever stronger and what’s
ahead is strengthening its financial position further with
feasible refinancing of foreign loans,” Palsson said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
