Hartford Financial Services Group
Inc. (HIG)  said first-quarter results will include a $600 million
charge as the insurer hedges risks from savings products sold to
Japanese investors.  The insurer will guard against fluctuations in currency
valuations and stock markets, according to a statement today
from Hartford, based in the Connecticut city of the same name.  Chief Executive Officer Liam McGee is seeking to cut risks
after the insurer stopped selling the savings products known as
annuities and focused on property-casualty coverage to boost
Hartfordâ€™s shares. The insurer is scheduled to give a
presentation to investors today on U.S. and Japanese annuities.  To contact the reporter on this story:
