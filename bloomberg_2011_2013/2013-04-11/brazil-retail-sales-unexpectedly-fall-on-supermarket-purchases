Brazil ’s retail  sales  declined in
February, surprising analysts who had forecast an increase, as
the government continues to take measures to spur the world’s
second-biggest emerging market.  The volume of sales fell 0.4 percent, after rising a
revised 0.5 percent in January, the national statistics agency
said today in Rio de Janeiro. The number was lower than
estimated by all 30 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg, whose median
 estimate  was for sales to gain 1.5 percent. From the year
earlier, sales fell 0.2 percent, the first annual decline since
November 2003, compared with a  forecast  for a 3.5 percent
increase from 27 economists surveyed.  The broader retail index, which includes the sale of cars
and construction materials, rose 1.2 percent from the previous
year, the statistics agency said.  As industrial production in Latin America’s largest market
declined over the past year, President Dilma Rousseff’s
government has introduced dozens of measures intended to prop up
domestic demand. The central bank has kept its key rate at a
record low for its past three meetings in a bid to boost
activity after the economy last year posted its worst
performance since 2009. On April 1 the government extended until
year-end a tax cut on car sales that would have expired that
day.  Swap rates on the contract maturing in January 2014, the
most traded in Sao Paulo today, rose 10 basis points, or 0.10
percentage point, to 8.00 percent at 9:48 a.m. local time. The
real strengthened 0.2 percent to 1.9697 per U.S. dollar.  Personal Items  The retail sales fall was led by a 1 percent drop in
supermarket sales, a 2.9 percent drop in sales of personal and
domestic items, and a 2.1 percent decline in sales of fuels and
lubricants. Those falls were partially offset by a 5.2 percent
increase in sales of office equipment and materials.  Brazil’s  gross domestic product  expanded 0.9 percent in
2012, down from 2.7 percent in 2011 and 7.5 percent in 2010.
Economists in the latest central bank survey forecast growth of
3 percent this year, with 5.7 percent inflation. The central
bank targets inflation of 4.5 percent plus or minus two
percentage points.  To contact the reporter on this story:
