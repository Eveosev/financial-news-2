The U.K. 10-year break-even rate,
an index of annual inflation expectations, climbed to the
highest level in more than 4 1/2 years after the nation sold
index-linked securities at an auction today.  The pound advanced to the most in seven weeks against the
dollar. The 30-year break-even rate fell from close to the
highest in almost two years as the Debt Management Office sold
1.6 billion pounds ($2.5 billion) of inflation-linked gilts
maturing in 2024 in the second bond sale of the fiscal year that
began this month. Rates have risen since the Office for National
Statistics said on Jan. 10 it would maintain its current formula
for calculating the retail-price index.  “U.K. 10-year break-even rates have clearly outperformed
today, consistent with solid demand at this morning’s auction,”
said Henry Skeoch, an inflation-linked bonds strategist at
Barclays Plc in London. “There has been good buying of U.K.
linkers this year following the resolution of the uncertainty
associated with the RPI formula effect, and this demand has been
particularly apparent in the 10-year sector.”  The  10-year break-even rate , derived from the difference in
yield between gilts and index-linked securities, was little
changed at 3.34 percentage points as of 4:27 p.m. London time,
after climbing to 3.39, the most since September 2008.  The  30-year break-even  rate slid two basis points, or 0.02
percentage point, to 3.44 percentage points after rising to 3.47
percentage points. It touched 3.51 on Feb. 14, the most since
August 2011.  Linker Sale  The U.K. sold index-linked gilts due in March 2024 at a so-
called real yield of minus 1.262 percent, the debt office said
on its website. Investors bid for 1.86 times the amount of
securities allotted.  “There is ongoing demand for inflation-protected
securities,” said Simon Peck, a fixed-income strategist at
Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc in  London . “There’s more room
to go in the 30-year area. Longer-term break-even rates can move
higher.”  Benchmark 10-year gilt yields were little changed at 1.77
percent. The price of the 1.75 percent bond due September 2022
was at 99.83. The rate increased 15 basis points during the past
three days.  Gilts returned 1 percent this year through yesterday,
according to indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the European
Federation of Financial Analysts Societies. German bonds gained
0.5 percent and Treasuries earned 0.2 percent.  The pound climbed 0.5 percent to $1.5404 after rising to
$1.5412, the highest since Feb. 20. Sterling was little changed
at 85.19 pence per euro.  The pound has declined 4.4 percent this year, according to
Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes, which track 10
developed-nation currencies. The dollar gained 1.5 percent and
the euro rose 0.9 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
