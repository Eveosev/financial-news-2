Regal Cinemas Inc., a movie-theater
operator, lowered the rate itâ€™s proposing to pay on a $988
million loan, according to a person with knowledge of the
transaction.  The first-lien debt, which comes due in August 2017, will
pay interest at 2.75 percentage points more than the London
interbank offered rate when leverage is more than 3 times, said
the person who asked not to be identified because the deal is
private. The unit of  Regal Entertainment Group (RGC)  initially
proposed to pay interest at 3 percentage points when leverage is
more than 3 times.  When leverage, or debt to earnings before interest, taxes,
depreciation and amortization, is less than 3 times, Regal will
pay interest at 2.5 percentage points more than Libor, down from
2.75 percentage points initially proposed.   Credit Suisse Group AG is arranging the so-called covenant-
light financing for the unit of Regal Entertainment Group, which
will be sold to lenders at par, the person said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
