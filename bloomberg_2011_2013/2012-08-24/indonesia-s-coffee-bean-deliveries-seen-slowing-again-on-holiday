Deliveries of coffee from farms in
 Indonesia , the world’s third-biggest robusta grower, slowed
again this week because of the Muslim holiday of Eid, according
to Volcafe, a unit of commodities trader ED&F Man Holdings Ltd.  Bean arrivals were about 2,000 to 2,500 metric tons this
week, the Winterthur, Switzerland-based trader said in a report
e-mailed today. That compares with 9,000 tons last week and
16,000 to 17,000 tons a week earlier, data from the trader
showed. Indonesia is harvesting its 2012-13 crop that started in
April. Eid marks the end of the fasting month of Ramadan.  “The country came to a standstill due to the Idul Fitry
festivities,” Volcafe said in the report, using another term
for Eid. “Hardly any business” has been concluded, according
to the report.  Indonesian beans for shipment in September and October were
at a premium of $40 a ton to the price on the NYSE Liffe
exchange in London, Volcafe said. That compares with $50 a ton
last week, data from the trader showed.  In  Vietnam , the biggest robusta grower, demand slowed as
the end of the 2011-12 crop approaches, according to the trader.
The 2011-12 season there ends next month and the development of
the 2012-13 crop there is “ok,” Volcafe said.  Vietnamese beans for shipment in September and October were
at a premium of $25 a ton to the exchange price, down from $50 a
ton last week, according to the report.  In  India ,  Asia ’s third-biggest producer, domestic demand
keeps beans at “expensive premiums,” the trader said.  Robusta coffee for November delivery was unchanged at
$2,041 a ton by 12:53 p.m. on NYSE Liffe in London.  To contact the reporter on this story:
