Jamaica’s economic growth will
remain weak through the end of this year as the government cuts
spending and a global slowdown damps mining exports, the  Central
Bank  said.  Economic expansion “remained flat” last quarter after
contracting 0.1 percent in the first three months of 2012,
according to report published today on the bank’s  website .  The Caribbean’s second-biggest economy faces “continued
weakness in domestic and global demand” as well as an “austere
fiscal policy” to lower debt that will keep growth flat, the
report said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
