Gambian President Yahya Jammeh has
made changes to his Cabinet for the third time since April,
according to a statement read on state-owned Gambia Radio and
Television Services.  Mamadou Tangara, the minister of higher education,
research, science and technology, and Foreign Affairs Minister
Mambury Njie will switch jobs, the Banjul-based president’s
office said in the statement yesterday.  Jammeh won a fourth term in office in November, extending
his 17-year rule of the West African nation.  To contact the reporter on this story:
