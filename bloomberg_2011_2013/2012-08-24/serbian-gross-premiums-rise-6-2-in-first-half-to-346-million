Gross written insurance premiums in
 Serbia  rose 6.2 percent in the first six months, led by a 17.4
percent growth in life insurance policies, the central bank
said.  The premiums reached 32.5 billion dinars ($346 million),
with non-life premiums accounting for 83 percent and life
policies for 17 percent of the total, Narodna Banka Srbije said
in a  report  on its  website . A year earlier, the ratio was 84.6
percent against 15.4 percent, according to the report.  Dunav Osiguranje AD (DNOS) ,  DDOR Novi Sad AD (DDNS)  and  Delta Osiguranje
AD (DEOS) , a unit of  Assicurazioni Generali SpA (G) , remained the three
biggest among 28 insurers on the market, said the central bank
which supervises the entire financial industry including banks,
insurance companies and pension funds.  To contact the reporter on this story:
