Asian  stocks  declined for the first
week in four, with the region’s benchmark index retreating from
the highest level since May, on signs of slower growth in the
U.S. and China and amid concern Europe’s leaders aren’t making
progress in solving the region’s debt crisis.  Nissan Motor Co., a Japanese carmaker that counts  North
America  as its biggest market, fell 3.8 percent in Tokyo after
U.S jobless claims rose more than expected.  Aluminum Corp. of
China Ltd.  fell 2.1 percent in  Hong Kong  after Dallas Federal
Reserve economists said overstated data may have masked the
severity of China’s slowdown.  Makita Corp. (6586) , a Japanese maker of
power tools that depends on Europe for more than 40 percent of
sales, slid 2.6 percent.  The  MSCI Asia Pacific Index (MXAP)  slid 0.4 percent to 120.28,
erasing an advance for the week during the final day of trading.
The gauge closed on Aug. 23 at the highest level since May 4
before a weaker than expected employment report and wilting
 consumer confidence  dragged it lower. About five stocks fell for
every three that rose through the week.  “The rally seems to have been a bit more about hope over
reality,” said  Stephen Halmarick , Sydney-based head of
investment markets research at Colonial First State Global Asset
Management, which oversees about $150 billion. “Clearly
economic data has been pretty poor. The practicalities of what
needs to be done to address this are huge.”  Asia’s equity benchmark climbed more than 10 percent from
its lowest level this year June 4 on bets monetary authorities
in the U.S., Europe and China would take action to boost slowing
economic growth. Stocks on the index were valued at 12.6 times
estimated earnings on average, compared with 13.7 for the
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index and 11.6 for the Stoxx Europe 600
Index, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Regional Indexes  Japan’s Nikkei 225 Stock Average lost 1 percent this week
and South Korea’s Kospi slid 1.4 percent.  Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 Index retreated 0.5 percent as
 Reserve Bank  of Australia Governor  Glenn Stevens  said policy
makers are prepared to respond in the event the economy slows,
predicting the nation’s mining investment boom has at least
another year before easing.  Exporters across the region fell. Nissan slid 3.8 percent
to 765 yen. Makita slid 2.6 percent to 2,933 yen. Cosco Pacific
Ltd., a shipping company which operates a port terminal in
 Greece , declined 2.1 percent to HK$10.40. Hutchison Whampoa Ltd.,
which gets more than half its sales from Europe, retreated 2.5
percent to HK$68.85.  Jobless Claims  In the U.S., a report showed the number of applications for
 unemployment benefits  climbed last week to a one-month high.
Jobless claims rose for a second week to 372,000, exceeding the
365,000 median forecast of economists surveyed by Bloomberg.  German Chancellor  Angela Merkel  said Europe is in one of
its deepest crises, while the country’s finance minister,
 Wolfgang Schaeuble , said allowing Greece more time to meet its
debt obligations would not solve the country’s problems.  Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index declined 1.2 percent and the
Shanghai Composite Index slid 1.1 percent. China may have
overstated 2012 industrial production data to conceal the
economy’s weakness, Dallas Fed economists Janet Koech and Jian
Wang wrote in a paper. Separately, HSBC Holdings Plc cut China’s
2012 growth forecast to 8 percent from 8.4 percent.  Energy and material companies led declines in Asia this
past week.  Tinkler Withdraws  Whitehaven Coal Ltd. tumbled 14 percent to A$3.10 after
saying Australian mining magnate  Nathan Tinkler  scrapped his
takeover proposal that valued the company at A$5.3 billion ($5.5
billion), triggering the biggest drop in its shares in almost
four years.  Cnooc Ltd. (883) , China’s biggest offshore oil and gas explorer,
slumped 5.1 percent to HK$14.80 after posting a 19 percent
decline in first-half profit that was worse than analysts
estimated after a spill closed its largest local field.  Aluminum Corp. dropped 2.1 percent to HK$3.27. JX Holdings
Inc., a Japanese oil refiner, slid 4.6 percent to 398 yen after
a fire at a plant in Sendai and as the company ended a solar-
power joint venture.  Among rising stocks, CSL Ltd. soared. The world’s second-
biggest maker of blood-derived therapies posted a 13 percent
jump in second-half profit, paced by higher immune-treatment
sales. The shares advanced 5.9 percent to A$42.30.  China  Unicom (Hong Kong) Ltd., the nation’s second-largest
mobile-phone company, rose 10 percent to HK$13.10, CHECK to its
highest level in more than three months in Hong Kong, after
second-quarter profit beat analysts’ estimates.  To contact the reporter on this story:
