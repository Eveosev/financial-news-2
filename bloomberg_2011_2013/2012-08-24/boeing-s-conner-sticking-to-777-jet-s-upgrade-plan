Boeing Co. (BA)  said it’s sticking to its
schedule for developing an upgrade of the 777 wide-body plane,
its most profitable jet, that will enter service by the end of
the decade.  “Our timing on a decision to offer that airplane has not
changed,” Boeing Commercial Airplanes President Ray Conner
wrote in a message to employees today. “We are absolutely
committed to the 777X and continue to invest the necessary time
and resources to ensure we produce a superior airplane for our
customers.”  The development of a stretch version of the Dreamliner,
called the 787-10X, continues as well, Conner wrote. The Seattle
Times reported today, citing unidentified people familiar with
the matter, that Boeing had slowed down the development process.  Boeing’s former commercial president,  Jim Albaugh , had
talked earlier this year about taking a plan for selling the
wide-body jets to the board for approval by the end of 2012.
After Conner was appointed June 26, he said the plan will be
presented once it’s ready, comments that were repeated in
today’s message.  Boeing’s larger rival, Airbus SAS, plans to introduce the
A350-1000 in 2017 to compete with the 777 and 787.  To contact the reporter on this story:
