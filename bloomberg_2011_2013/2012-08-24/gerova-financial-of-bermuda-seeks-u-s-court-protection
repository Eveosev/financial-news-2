Gerova Financial Group Ltd. (GVFG) , a
Bermuda-based financial-services company, sought U.S. bankruptcy
court protection listing debt of as much as $500 million.  The Hamilton-based firm, formerly known as Asia Special
Situations Acquisition Corp., filed a Chapter 15 petition in
Manhattan today to protect its U.S. assets from creditors.
Assets were valued at more than $50 million, Gerova said.  Gerova began liquidation proceedings July 20 in Bermuda.
Chapter 15 shields foreign companies from U.S. lawsuits and
creditor claims while a company continues the process abroad.  The company said in January 2011 it acquired about
$1.2 billion in insurance policies and loans and arranged
financing for further purchases in the life-settlements market.  The case is In re Gerova Financial Group, 12-bk-13641,  U.S.
Bankruptcy Court , Southern District of  New York  (Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
