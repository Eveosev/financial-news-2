Spot gasoline on the Gulf Coast
strengthened after a report that  Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM)  halted output
at the only catalytic cracker at its Beaumont, Texas, refinery.  Repairs on the unit, which turns heavier feedstock into
lighter transportation fuels like gasoline, may take six to 10
days, EnergyNewsToday reported, without citing a source for the
information. The 345,000-barrel-a-day refinery reported
equipment failure yesterday resulting in flaring from the
cracker and “some impact on production,” according to a filing
with state regulators.  Conventional, 87-octane gasoline on the Gulf Coast
strengthened 2.12 cents to a 13.5-cents-a-gallon premium over
gasoline futures traded on the  New York Mercantile Exchange  at
4:11 p.m., according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The premium for ultra-low-sulfur diesel in the Gulf grew
0.63 cent to 8.88 cents a gallon above heating oil futures in
 New York .  To contact the reporter on this story:
