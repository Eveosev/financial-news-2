Changes to  Germany ’s Pfandbrief Act,
adopted by the government this week, are positive for investors
because they give them a better idea of market risk,  Fitch
Ratings  said in a statement.  The amendment to Article 28 of the law requires banks to
disclose more information about the assets packaged into the
securities, according to the statement published today.
Pfandbrief issuers will have to publish the proportion of fixed-
rate assets in the covered bonds as well as the seasoning of
real-estate loans and indicate potential currency mismatches,
Fitch said.  There’s no provision for loan-to-value disclosure on
mortgage assets in the law change, Fitch said. Investors have
called for information on this because most covered bonds are
secured by residential and commercial mortgages.  “We acknowledge the practical challenges of LTV
disclosure,” Rebecca Holter, senior director of covered bonds
at Fitch, said in the report. “Nevertheless, we think more
details on LTVs would give investors a useful tool to compare
mortgage Pfandbrief programmes.”  Fitch said it doesn’t expect any ratings impact from the
law change.  To contact the reporter on this story:
