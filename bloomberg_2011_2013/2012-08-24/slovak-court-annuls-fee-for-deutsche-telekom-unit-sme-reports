Slovakia’s  Supreme Court  annulled a
48 million-euro ($60 million) fee demanded by the country’s
regulator from a unit of  Deutsche Telekom AG (DTE)  for extending its
mobile license,  Sme  reported.  The court ruled the Telecommunication Office didn’t justify
the amount of the fee imposed upon Slovak Telekom AS, in which
the German company owns 51 percent, for a 10-year extension, the
newspaper said.  Orange Slovensko AS, a unit of France Telecom SA, also
asked the court in a pending case to revoke a 40.7 million-euro
charge for a similar license, Sme said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
