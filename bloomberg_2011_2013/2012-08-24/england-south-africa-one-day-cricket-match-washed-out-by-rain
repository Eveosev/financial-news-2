The opening one-day cricket match
between England and South Africa was washed out by rain after
just 5.3 overs were played in Cardiff.  Play began at 3:10 p.m. following a 5-hour rain delay with
South Africa bowling after winning the toss and the teams
reduced to 23 overs per side instead of the normal 50.  Ian Bell  scored 26 and  Alastair Cook  was on 10 as England
reached 37-0 before the rain returned and the players left the
field. The umpires abandoned the match moments later.  The second game in the five-match series will be played
Aug. 28 in Southampton. South Africa earlier won the Test series
2-0 to replace England atop the International Cricket Council
rankings.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
