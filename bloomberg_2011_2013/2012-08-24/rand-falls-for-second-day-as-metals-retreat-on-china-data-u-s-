The rand weakened for a second day
as commodities declined after  China ’s manufacturing industry
shrank and a rise in U.S. jobless claims increased speculation
that the  Federal Reserve  will stimulate economic growth.  South Africa ’s currency declined as much as 0.5 percent and
traded 0.4 percent weaker at 8.3460 per dollar as of 8:52 a.m.
in Johannesburg. Yields on the nation’s 6.75 percent bonds due
2021 rose one basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 6.75
percent.  The preliminary reading for a purchasing managers’ index
for China released by HSBC Holdings Plc and Markit Economics
fell to 47.8 in August, the 10th month below 50.  Europe  accounts
for more than 20 percent of China’s exports. Minutes of the U.S.
central bank’s latest policy meeting released yesterday showed
officials remain supportive of a third round of asset purchases
under quantitative easing, or QE, as unemployment has been mired
at more than 8 percent since 2009.  “The rand has been pushed weaker by poor global data and
uncertainty over QE3,”  John Cairns  and Josina Solomons,
currency strategists at Rand Merchant Bank in Johannesburg, said
in e-mailed comments. “PMI figures from China were
unquestionably weak.”  Three-month copper declined as much as 1 percent, trimming
a third weekly advance. Standard & Poor’s  GSCI index  of
commodities retreated 0.4 percent, a second day of losses.
Metals and other commodities account for 45 percent of South
Africa’s total exports, according to government data.  To contact the reporter on this story:
