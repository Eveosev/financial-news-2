The opening one-day cricket match
between England and South Africa in Cardiff has started after a
rain delay of nearly five hours.  Play began at 3:10 p.m. at SWALEC Stadium with teams now
getting 23 overs each, reduced from the normal 50 overs. South
Africa earlier won the toss and elected to bowl.  England recalled Chris Woakes to the team in place of
 Stuart Broad , who is being rested.  Dale Steyn  is being rested by
South Africa, replaced by Wayne Parnell.  South Africa will leapfrog England into the No. 1 spot in
the International Cricket Council one-day rankings with a win
today. The Proteas have already replaced England atop the Test
rankings with a 2-0 series win.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
