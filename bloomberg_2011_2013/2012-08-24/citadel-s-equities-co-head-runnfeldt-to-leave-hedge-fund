Jeff Runnfeldt, co-head of Citadel
LLC’s global equities group, is leaving after a decade at the
hedge fund.  Runnfeldt plans to retire and his last day is Aug. 31,
 Katie Spring , a spokeswoman for the $12 billion firm based in
Chicago, said in an e-mail.  Runnfeldt, 46, became co-head of global equities in 2009
along with Brandon Haley and Steve Weller when Citadel started
its equity fund. The $2.5 billion fund has returned about 10.3
percent this year through mid-August, according to a person with
knowledge of the returns. The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index gained
13 percent, including reinvested dividends, through the same
period. Equity hedge funds have returned 2.8 percent, according
to the HFRX Equity Hedge Index.  Runnfeldt joined Citadel, run by billionaire founder  Ken
Griffin , in 2002 and was named head of financials in 2004.
Before Citadel, he worked at firms including Montgomery Asset
Management and BT Alex Brown and had started out as a bank
examiner at the  Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco , according
to a Citadel biography.  To contact the reporter on this story:
