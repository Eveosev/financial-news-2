European Union lawmakers and
government officials will resume talks on Sept. 5 over how to
apply Basel  bank  capital rules amid calls from lenders to delay
implementing the measures, said  Sharon Bowles , chairwoman of the
European Parliament’s economic and monetary affairs committee.  Cyprus, which holds the rotating presidency of the EU, and
members of the EU assembly are seeking a deal on the draft law
ahead of an international deadline of January 2013.  Banks have urged a delay in applying the rules, saying the
ongoing talks mean that they will have insufficient time to
adapt their systems and internal procedures.  “We’re obviously going to have to have discussion about
it,” Bowles said in an interview. “I’m not unsympathetic, I
recognize the practicalities.”  Negotiators will begin a series of meetings on the
legislation on Sept. 5, Bowles said.  The  Basel Committee on Banking Supervision , which brings
together regulators from 27 nations including the U.S., U.K. and
 China , agreed in 2010 that the measures should be phased
starting Jan. 1 2013, with full implementation from 2019.  To contact the reporter on this story:
