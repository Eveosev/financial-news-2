Foxconn Technology Group, which
pledged to improve pay and conditions on its assembly lines,
raised salaries by more than 16 percent at a plant making  Apple
Inc. (AAPL)  iPhones and halved the probation period for new workers.  Monthly salaries for entry-level employees at the factory
in Zhengzhou were raised starting Aug. 1 to 1,800  yuan  ($283)
from 1,550 yuan, the Taipei-based company said today in an e-
mail to Bloomberg News. Probation, after which workers get a
higher base salary, was cut to three months from six months, it
said.  The announcement of higher salaries came two days after the
Fair Labor Association said Foxconn was ahead of schedule to
improve conditions, while work hours exceeded targets and legal
mandates. Apple Chief Executive Officer  Tim Cook  visited an
iPhone factory in Zhengzhou, Henan province, in March, a month
after the FLA audits began.  Base-salary increases will range from 250 yuan per month to
350 yuan per month, depending on the worker’s tenure and
position within the company, and don’t take overtime into
account, Foxconn said. Another 200 yuan per month will be paid
to production workers during the peak months of August to
November, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
