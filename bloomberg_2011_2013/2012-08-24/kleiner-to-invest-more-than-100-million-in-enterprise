Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers will more than double its investments in mobile applications for corporate users, as well as technology used to remotely manage software and hardware, investment partner Matt Murphy said.  The venture capital firm has already invested about $100 million in the two areas in the last 18 months, and plans to more than double its investments in the next 12 to 18 months, Murphy said in a phone interview.  Mobile software startups are gaining traction as more corporate users adopt smartphones and  Apple Inc. (AAPL) ’s iPads for work, and use these devices to access key applications. Apple’s smartphones and tablets represented the top four most-popular mobile devices among corporate users, according to a  recent report  from software provider Good Technology Inc.  “The enterprise is a pretty interesting opportunity right now,” Murphy said. “We intend to be even more active.”  To facilitate the push, last year Kleiner recruited Ray Bradford and Mike Abbott. Bradford had previously worked at Amazon Web Services. Abbott was previously vice president of engineering at micro-blogging site  Twitter Inc. (TWTR)   Enterprises are increasingly tapping into online services, so-called cloud computing, rather than buying servers and software and installing them in-house. Kleiner’s investments in cloud management include Puppet Labs Inc., application performance management provider AppDynamics Inc. and cloud-system builder Nebula Inc.  The venture firm has also already funded several mobile apps for corporate customers. Recent investments include  DocuSign Inc. , which lets people sign and save documents on any device, and an undisclosed company that functions as “a Flipboard for enterprise,” Murphy said. Flipboard Inc.’s software aggregates content from various websites into a magazine designed for viewing on mobile devices.  “The trend is early on and only getting more interesting,” Murphy said.
