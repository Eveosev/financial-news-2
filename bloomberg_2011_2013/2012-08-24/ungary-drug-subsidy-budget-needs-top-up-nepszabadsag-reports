Hungaryâ€™s drug-subsidy fund has
exceeded its budget and its operator has asked for government
help,  Nepszabadsag  reported, citing a document it obtained.  Drug expenditure reached 80 percent of the full-year budget
this month and will run out by mid-September without extra cash,
the newspaper said. The national health insurance administration
has requested an extra 41 billion forint ($185 million) and may
need as much as 70 billion forint to last until the end of the
year, Nepszabadsag said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
