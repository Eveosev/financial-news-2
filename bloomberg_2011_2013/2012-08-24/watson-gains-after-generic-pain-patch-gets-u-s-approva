Watson Pharmaceuticals Inc. (WPI)  rose
after the drugmaker’s generic lidocaine patch to treat pain
associated with shingles received U.S. regulatory approval.  Watson increased 6 percent to $83.32 at 4 p.m. New York
time, its biggest gain in four months.  The patch is a copy of  Endo Health Solutions Inc. (ENDP) ’s numbing
medication Lidoderm, Watson said in a statement yesterday.
Watson plans to begin selling the product in September 2013. The
Parsippany, New Jersey-based company said it’s eligible to sell
the drug for six months without competition.  Watson and  Chadds Ford , Pennsylvania-based Endo settled
 patent litigation  related to lidocaine on May 29. Lidoderm is
Endo’s best-selling drug, with the company reporting $825
million in  sales  last year.  Shingles is a painful, blistering skin rash caused by the
virus that causes chicken pox, according to the National
Institutes of Health.  To contact the reporter on this story:
