Greek Prime Minister Antonis Samaras
said Greece would meet its commitments to European Union
partners and that reviving growth in the country was of critical
importance.  Samaras, who spoke after meeting with German Chancellor
 Angela Merkel  in Berlin today, said his country was tackling
twin deficits: the fiscal deficit and a credibility deficit. His
comments were televised live on state-run NET TV.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
