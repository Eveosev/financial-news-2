Univision Communications Inc., the
biggest U.S. Spanish-language broadcaster, will host “Meet the
Candidate” forums, with separate events for  Barack Obama  and
 Mitt Romney , after being shut out of the presidential debates.  The candidates will take questions from an audience,
moderators and Facebook Inc. users, the New York-based company
said yesterday in an e-mail. The network will translate
questions and answers for the candidates and the viewers. The
schedule will be announced later.  Obama and Romney agreed to participate after Univision
Chief Executive Officer Randy Falco released an Aug. 15 letter
to the Commission on Presidential Debates protesting rejection
of its news anchors to be among this year’s moderators.  “These events speak to President Obama and Governor Romney
recognizing the important role Hispanic America will play in the
elections and in defining the future of our country,” Univision
News President Isaac Lee said in the statement.  The two forums, in partnership with  Facebook (FB) , will be
hosted by Univision News anchors Jorge Ramos and Maria Elena Salinas, closely held Univision said.  Univision was acquired in 2007 for $12.6 billion by Saban
Capital Group Inc., Madison Dearborn Partners LLC, Providence
Equity Partners Inc., TPG Capital and Thomas H. Lee Partners LP.  PBS’s Jim Lehrer,  CNN ’s Candy Crowley and CBS’s Bob Schieffer will each host a presidential debate, according to the
website for the Commission on Presidential Debates. Martha Raddatz of ABC will moderate a debate between the vice
presidential candidates.  To contact the reporter on this story:
