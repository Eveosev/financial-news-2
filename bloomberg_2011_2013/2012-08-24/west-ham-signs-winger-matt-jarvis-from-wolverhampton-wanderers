West Ham signed winger  Matt Jarvis 
from Wolverhampton Wanderers for an undisclosed fee, the Premier
League soccer club said on its website.  Jarvis, 26, signed a contract until 2017, with an option
for another year, West Ham said. He’ll be available for
tomorrow’s game at Swansea.  Jarvis scored 21 goals after joining Wolves from Gillingham
in 2008. He had a career-best eight last season as Wolves
finished last in the Premier League and were relegated to the
Championship.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
