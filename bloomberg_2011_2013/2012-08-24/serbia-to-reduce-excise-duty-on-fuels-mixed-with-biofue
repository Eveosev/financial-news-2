Serbia  will cut excise duties on
fuels partly produced with biofuel to stimulate the use of
renewable sources and ease price pressures as crude oil costs
rise, Energy Minister Zorana Mihajlovic said.  Fuel produced entirely from biomass is already excise free
in the Balkan country and regulations will be amended to reduce
the duty for fossil fuels mixed with 5 percent to 15 percent of
biofuel, Mihajlovic told reporters today at Serbiaâ€™s main
refinery in Pancevo, east of Belgrade. The cut will be in
proportion to the percentage of biofuel in products, she said.  The refinery has almost completed a 550 million-euro ($688
million) upgrade and will begin production of diesel and
gasoline of only Euro 5 quality in November, said Kirill Kravchenko, the chief executive officer of  Naftna Industrija
Srbije AD (NIIS) , which owns the facility. Euro-5 fuel has a maximum
sulfur content of 10 parts per million, making it less polluting
than lower grades.  The processing capacity of the Pancevo refinery will remain
at 4.8 million tons of crude a year after the upgrade, with the
annual output seen at as much as 1.5 million tons of diesel,
800,000 tons of gasoline and 300,000 tons of jet fuels, among
other products, said Miroslav Niciforovic, a director at the
refinery.  To contact the reporter on this story:
