U.S. consumers may pay 3 percent to
4 percent more for food next year, and less for meat in 2012
than previously forecast, as the country’s worst drought since
the 1950s works its way onto store shelves, the USDA said.  Prices for meat, poultry and fish will rise 3 percent to 4
percent in 2012, one-half of a percentage point less than
estimated last month, the  U.S. Department of Agriculture  said in
a  report  today on its website.  The price of corn, the main feed source for animals, has
surged 61 percent since June 15 through yesterday, pushing
ranchers to send animals to slaughter sooner and temporarily
boosting supplies.  “The current drought is anticipated to reduce cattle herd
sizes due to increased feed costs which is expected, in turn, to
increase the retail beef supply and reduce prices somewhat in
the short term,” Richard Volpe, the USDA’s food economist, said
in  a note  accompanying the forecast.  Corn and soybean futures reached record highs this month on
the Chicago Board of Trade, and wheat has touched its highest
since 2008 as crop conditions worsened in the U.S. Midwest and
Great Plains. The drought prompted the USDA to declare natural
disasters in more than 1,800 counties in 35 states, more than
half of the country’s total.  2012 Estimate  Food costs  as a whole will rise 2.5 percent to 3.5 percent
this year, the agency said, leaving unchanged the 2012 estimate
it issued last month.  Rising oil and gasoline expenses may pose a new threat to
nutrition costs, said Chad Hart, an economist at  Iowa State
University . “Anytime you have oil and gas prices moving up,
that will hit us on the food dollar.”  Oil is up 13 percent over the past year on international
instability and tight supplies. The nationwide average price of
regular gasoline at the pump has risen 12 percent to  $3.73 a
gallon  since July 1, according to the AAA, the nation’s largest
motoring organization. Energy and transportation accounts for
about 8.2 cents of each dollar spent on food, compared with
about 4 cents for farm commodities, according to the U.S.
Department of Agriculture.  “If  oil prices  keep going up as they have recently, that
could have a greater impact on food costs than what’s associated
with what’s going on with the drought,” Agriculture Secretary
Tom Vilsack said in an interview Aug. 16.  Food prices have risen 1 percent so far this year, the
government said earlier this month. Retail-food costs rose 3.7
percent in 2011, according to the USDA.  To contact the reporter on this story:
