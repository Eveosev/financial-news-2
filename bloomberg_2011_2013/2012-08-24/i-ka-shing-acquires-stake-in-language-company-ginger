Billionaire  Li Ka-shing  acquired a
stake in Ginger Software Inc., a developer of programs to
correct words entered by computer users, adding to his portfolio
of investments in technology companies.  Horizons Ventures Ltd., a firm that manages Li’s technology
investments, and Harbor Pacific Capital Partners invested a
combined $5 million in Ginger, according to an Aug. 22 statement
by the software maker. Jeremy Lau, a spokesman at Li’s  Hutchison
Whampoa Ltd. (13)  in  Hong Kong , confirmed details of the statement by 
phone today.  Li, Asia’s richest man, made personal investments in
technology companies including  Facebook Inc. (FB) , Spotify Ltd. and
Siri Inc., betting demand for social-networking and Web-based
entertainment services will increase as more consumers go online
with computers and smartphones. His publicly-traded companies
including Hutchison have investments in industries including
ports, telecommunications and energy in more than 50 countries.  Ginger Software, which has offices in Israel and the U.S.,
offers technology that helps computer users with spelling and
grammar, according to its website. Chief Executive Officer Net Jacobsson was a former executive at Facebook, the world’s
biggest social-networking company.  In 2010, Apple Inc. acquired Siri, a maker of software that
allows people to search the Internet from their phones with
voice commands, and later included the company’s technology in
the iPhone.  Li’s wealth of $25.3 billion placed him 13th on the
Bloomberg Billionaire index of the world’s richest people.  To contact the reporter on this story:
