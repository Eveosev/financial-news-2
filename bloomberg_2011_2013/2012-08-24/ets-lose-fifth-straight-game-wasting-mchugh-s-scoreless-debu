The  Colorado Rockies  completed a
four-game sweep of the host Mets with a 1-0 victory, dropping
New York into fourth place in the National League East division.  Collin McHugh, 25, allowed two hits and struck out nine in
seven scoreless innings for the Mets in his major league debut
yesterday at Citi Field and left with the game scoreless.  Colorado scored in the eighth on a triple by Tyler Colvin,
on a drive to center that was misjudged by center fielder
Jordany Valdespin, and a run-scoring single by Chris Nelson.  The Mets, who went 0-for-10 with runners in scoring
position, have not scored more than two runs in any of their
last six games.  New York  (57-68) has lost five straight.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
