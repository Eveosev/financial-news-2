Czech economic sentiment improved
for the first time in five months in August as the central bank
signaled more monetary policy easing amid a lengthening
recession.  The  composite  indicator of business and  consumer confidence 
increased to minus 3.6 from minus 3.8 in July, the Prague-based
statistics office said in a statement on its website today. The
business-confidence indicator rose to 2.4 from 2.3, while the
gauge for consumers improved to minus 27.3 from minus 28.3. The
confidence indicators may range from minus 100, if all
respondents are pessimistic, to 100, if all are optimistic.  The economy shrank 0.2 percent in the second quarter from
the previous three months, the third consecutive contraction, as
households curbed spending in response to  Europe ’s worsening
economy. The  Czech Republic  relies on the 27-nation European
Union to buy 80 percent of exports, including from companies
such as carmaker Skoda Auto AS.  Policy makers were split at their last meeting on Aug. 2 in
assessing the effect of government tax increases on inflation
and risks stemming from the euro-area debt crisis. Two rate
setters sought a quarter-point reduction after the bank cut its
two-week benchmark to a record-low 0.5 percent in June, while
four voted for no change even as the bank’s forecast saw lower
rates amid a worsening economic outlook.  To contact the reporter on this story:
