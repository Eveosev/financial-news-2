Tanzania’s benchmark coffee rose as
much as 12 percent over the past week as the condition of the
beans improved, the national coffee board said.  The benchmark arabica AA sold for as much as $210 per 50-
kilogram (110-pound) bag yesterday compared with $188 a bag for
the week earlier, the Tanzania Coffee Board said today by e-mail
from the northern town of Moshi.  “The quality of the coffee is steadily improving,” Primus
Kimaryo, the director of quality and promotion at the board,
said by phone today from Moshi. “Buyers were aggressive in the
market.”  The U.S.,  Japan  and  Germany  are importers of Tanzania
coffee, according to the board. Tanzania harvests its crop
from April through August. Arabica accounts for 75 percent of
the country’s output and robusta the rest.  Coffee supplied at the auction rose 46 percent to 30,644
bags from 20,978 bags a week earlier and sales climbed 41
percent to 26,841 bags, the agency said. The board offers coffee
in 60-kilogram (132-pound) bags and sells them in 50-kilogram
containers.  The following are details of yesterday’s auction in U.S.
dollars for a 50-kilogram bag for the good grades:
