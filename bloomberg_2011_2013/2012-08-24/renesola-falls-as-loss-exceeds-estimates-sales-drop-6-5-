ReneSola Ltd. (SOL) , the third-largest
maker of solar wafers, fell the most in more than a year after
its second-quarter loss exceeded analysts’ estimates.  ReneSola’s American depositary receipts declined 16 percent
to $1.51 at the close in  New York , the most since Aug. 8, 2011.
The Jiashan, China-based company has lost 55 percent of its
market value in the past year.  ReneSola’s loss was $34.8 million, or 40 cents an ADR,
compared with a profit of $1.8 million, or 2 cents, a year
earlier, according to a statement today. Sales dropped 6.5
percent to $233 million. The loss exceeded by 8 cents an ADR the
average of four analysts’ estimates  compiled  by Bloomberg. Each
ADR is worth two ordinary shares.  The company reiterated its 2012 shipment forecast of 2.2
gigawatts to 2.4 gigawatts of solar wafers and panels.  China ’s
 GCL-Poly Energy Holdings Ltd. (3800)  and LDK Solar Co. are the largest
makers of polysilicon wafers used in solar cells, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
