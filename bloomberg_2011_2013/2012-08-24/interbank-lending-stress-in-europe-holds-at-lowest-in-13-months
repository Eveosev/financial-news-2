European banks’ reluctance to lend
to one another held at the lowest level in more than 13 months,
according to a money-market indicator.  The difference between the euro interbank offered rate and
overnight indexed swaps, known as the  Euribor-OIS spread , was
23.6 basis points at 8:20 a.m. in  London , according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. That’s the tightest since July 7, 2011.  The cost for banks to convert euro interest payments into
dollars held near the lowest since July 22, 2011. The three-
month cross-currency  basis swap  was 33.5 basis points below
Euribor from as low as minus 31.5 yesterday.  The one-year basis swap was little changed at 36 basis
points less than Euribor. A basis point is 0.01 percentage
point.  An estimate of future average overnight borrowing costs in
euros, the three-month Eonia swap, was unchanged at 6.8 basis
points. The European Banking Federation’s euro overnight indexed
average, or Eonia, of unsecured lending deals was set at 0.108
percent yesterday from 0.103 percent the day before.  Lenders cut  overnight deposits  at the Frankfurt-based
European Central Bank yesterday, placing 330 billion euros ($414
billion) with the bank from 336 billion euros the day before.  To contact the reporter on this story:
