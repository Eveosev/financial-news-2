A lawsuit against a  JPMorgan Chase &
Co. (JPM)  unit over a $25 million bond-purchase contract was dropped
by the Peralta Community College District in Oakland,
 California , which had claimed the bank would get a windfall.  Peralta sued JPMorgan Securities LLC Aug. 13 claiming the
bank was seeking to force it to make good on a 2006 contract
requiring it to issue high interest-rate bonds and sell them to
the bank, which would resell them at a profit of as much as $4
million, according to the complaint.  Peralta said the contract, which was originally with Bear
Stearn Cos., was illegal under a 2009 opinion by the California
Attorney General’s office that outlawed so-called cash-out bond
refundings. New York-based JPMorgan acquired Bear Stearns in
2008.  JPMorgan agreed to terminate the contract in exchange for
Peralta refunding $550,000 that Bear Stearns had paid the
college in 2006 and dropping the lawsuit, according to an
agreement disclosed by Peralta’s general counsel’s office.  The school has until Sept. 4 to return the money, according
to the agreement.  Thuy Thi Nguyen, Peralta’s general counsel, declined to
comment on the dismissal. Tasha Pelio, a spokeswoman for
JPMorgan, didn’t immediately respond to an e-mail yesterday
after regular business hours seeking comment on it.  The case is Peralta Community College District v. JPMorgan
Securities LLC, RG12-643254, California Superior Court, Alameda
County (Oakland).  To contact the reporter on this story:
