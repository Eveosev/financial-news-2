Canadian  stocks  climbed, led by
financial shares, after Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke 
said the central bank has the ability to take additional steps
to boost the  U.S. economy .  Royal Bank of Canada rose 0.8 percent.  Canadian Natural
Resources Ltd. (CNQ)  advanced 0.7 percent and  Suncor Energy Inc. (SU)  added
0.6 percent.  Score Media Inc. (SCR)  jumped 47 percent before trading
was halted at noon after the Toronto Star reported that  Rogers
Communications Inc. (RCI/B)  is looking at buying The Score sports
network.  The  Standard & Poor’s/TSX Composite Index (SPTSX)  climbed 19.72
points, or 0.2 percent, to 12,082.23. Financials and energy
stocks contributed the most to the advance in the gauge. The
Canadian equity benchmark was little changed for the week.  “It’s a central-bank driven rally,” said  Todd Johnson  of
Winnipeg, Manitoba-based BCV Asset Management, which manages
C$380 million ($383 million). He spoke in a phone interview.
“Everybody is looking to global central banks to provide a prop
for asset prices, to provide some sort of stimulus. Any positive
comment that comes from the Fed will help boost enthusiasm.”  Bernanke repeated the statement from the Federal Open
Market Committee’s Aug. 1 meeting that the Fed will provide
“additional accommodation as needed.” He has an opportunity to
expand on his views in an Aug. 31 speech at the Kansas City
Fed’s annual economic symposium in  Jackson Hole , Wyoming.  The S&P/TSX fell as much as 0.2 percent earlier in the day
after data showed demand for U.S. capital goods dropped in July
by the most in eight months. Bookings for non-military capital
equipment excluding planes slumped 3.4 percent, a Commerce
Department report showed in Washington.  Silvercorp Gains  Royal Bank of Canada (RY) , the nation’s largest lender, advanced
0.8 percent to C$53.73 and  Toronto-Dominion Bank (TD)  gained 0.3
percent to C$80.77.  Silvercorp Metals Inc. added 0.3 percent to C$5.84. Silver
climbed for the fifth day, up 0.5 percent to $30.71 an ounce.  Canadian Natural Resources advanced 0.7 percent to C$31.06.
Suncor Energy added 0.6 percent to C$31.44.  Petrominerales Ltd. (PMG) ,
a Calgary-based  oil company  that operates in the Andean region,
gained 4.2 percent to C$9.84.  Score Media added 47 percent to C$1.54, its biggest
percentage gain since February 2005. Rogers shares gained 0.1
percent to C$40.08.  To contact the reporters on this story:
