Italian Prime Minister  Mario Monti 
said his government must remain focused on budget discipline as
it set out a plan for policies to stimulate economic growth.  The government will focus on debt reduction and asset sales
in the coming months as it puts together measures to boost
competition, bring down energy costs and support start-up
companies, Monti’s Cabinet said late yesterday in an e-mailed
statement after a meeting in Rome.  “There is no chance of growth if public finances are not
under control,” Economic Development Minister  Corrado Passera 
told reporters after the meeting. “We have found, once again,
that each minister has ways to contribute both to the goal of
discipline and the goal of growth.”  Monti, who imposed austerity in the first half of his 18-
month term, is calling on ministers to formulate policies to
pull Italy out of its  fourth recession  since 2001. Since taking
over from  Silvio Berlusconi  in November, he has reined in
Italy’s deficit and lowered borrowing costs through a program
that included tax increases on fuel, real estate and  luxury
goods .  Passera didn’t say when the new government measures to
stimulate the economy would be finalized.  “We’ll talk about it,” he said when asked about the
timing. “There will be occasions to do it.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
