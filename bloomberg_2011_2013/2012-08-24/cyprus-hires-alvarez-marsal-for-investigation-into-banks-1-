The  Central Bank of Cyprus  hired
 Alvarez & Marsal Inc.  to lead a probe into the circumstances
that led two of the nation’s banks to seek state support.  “The investigation will provide clarity and comprehension
regarding the current financial stress in the republic and guide
remediation to strengthen the stability of the banking sector,”
the Nicosia-based central bank said in a statement today.  Alvarez & Marsal, a U.S.-based restructuring company,
managed Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc.’s operations during
bankruptcy, and is designing a so-called bad bank for the
Spanish government that will buy lenders’ most-toxic assets.  On June 25, Cyprus became the fifth of the euro area’s 17
member states to seek an international bailout, after Cyprus
Popular Bank Pcl, the country’s second-largest, sought
government backing for a 1.8 billion-euro ($2.3 billion) right
offering. Two days later,  Bank of Cyprus Pcl , the country’s
biggest lender, sought 500 million euros of government aid.  “This investigation is necessary given the failure of the
two systemically important banks that forced them to ask for
state support,” Michael Olympios, chairman of the Cypriot
Investors’ Association, which has 2,500 members, said by
telephone today.  The central bank’s announcement came after former Finance
Minister Michael Sarris resigned as chairman of Cyprus Popular
on Aug. 9. Andreas Eliades stepped down as chief executive
officer of Bank of Cyprus in July.  To contact the reporter on this story:
