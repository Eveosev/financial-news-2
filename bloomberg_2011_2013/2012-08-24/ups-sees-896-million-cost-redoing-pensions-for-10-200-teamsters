United Parcel Service Inc. (UPS)  reached
an agreement with Teamsters union to overhaul the  pension plan 
for 10,200 workers that will freeze liabilities and preclude
cash contributions for 10 years.  The company will have an $896 million cost in the third
quarter related to the accord with the New England Teamsters &
Trucking Industry Pension Fund, according to a statement today.
The agreement freezes Atlanta-based UPS’s liabilities under the
old program and allows it to move workers to a new plan.  “This transfer will remove uncertainty associated with
this plan for our people while being fair to the company and our
investors,” John McDevitt, UPS chief of labor relations, said
the statement.  Trustees of the New England Teamsters fund are creating a
second pool to attract more businesses to the multi-employer
plan, according to UPS, which said its cost will be paid over 50
years. UPS said the charge represents the present value of its
$2.1 billion withdrawal liability from the original plan.  The change is effective Sept. 16, subject to local unions’
approval, UPS said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
