Tropical storm watches were posted
for the Florida Keys and the state’s southern coast from Jupiter
Inlet to Bonita Beach as Tropical Storm Isaac grew stronger on a
path toward its first landfall, in Haiti, the U.S. National
Hurricane Center said.  A watch means tropical storm conditions are possible in the
area in 48 hours. Isaac’s top winds are now 65 miles (105
kilometers) per hour, up from 45 mph early today, and its core
is expected to cross Haiti overnight, the center said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
