American  Nick Watney  and Sergio
Garcia of Spain are tied for the lead heading into today’s third
round of the U.S. PGA Tour’s Barclays tournament at the Bethpage
Black course in Farmingdale, New York.  Watney and Garcia are tied at 8-under 134, a shot ahead of
Fiji’s  Vijay Singh  and American Bob Estes. Tiger Woods is three
shots off the lead at 5 under.  The Barclays tournament is the first in the four-event
FedExCup playoff, which features a $10 million bonus for the
champion. The field will be trimmed to the top 100 golfers in
the point standings heading into next week’s event.  First-round leader Padraig Harrington of Ireland had five
bogeys on his first eight holes yesterday to shoot a 75 in the
second round and fall five shots off the lead.  To contact the reporter on this story:
