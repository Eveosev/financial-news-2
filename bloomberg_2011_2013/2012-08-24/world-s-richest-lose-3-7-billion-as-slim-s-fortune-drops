The 40 richest people on the planet
lost a combined $3.7 billion this week as global stocks
declined.  The biggest loser was  Carlos Slim , who dropped $1.7
billion. Shares of the telecommunications mogul’s Mexico City-based America Movil SAB fell 2.2 percent during the week.
Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. cut recommendations on Brazil mobile
phone carriers on Wednesday.  Slim, 72, remains the world’s richest man with a net worth
of $73 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.  “I don’t think you can read too much into the market
activity since last week,” said Brian Wieser, a senior analyst
at Pivotal Research Group LLC in Portland, Oregon. “Volumes
were light and there really was an absence of meaningful news
flow.”  U.S. stocks rose yesterday, paring the Standard & Poor’s
500 Index’s first weekly decline in almost two months, as
Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said the central bank
has the ability to take additional steps to boost the economy.  The S&P 500 fell 0.5 percent during the week to close at
1411.13 in New York. The index has climbed 10 percent since June
1 amid optimism that global central banks will take actions to
stimulate growth. The Stoxx Europe 600 Index dropped 1.8 percent
during the week, closing at 268.00.  Adelson Wins  Casino tycoon Sheldon Adelson, 79, gained $517 million
during the week. Shares of his Nevada-based  Las Vegas Sands
Corp. (LVS)  rose 3.5 percent on Aug. 20 after Sterne Agee & Leach Inc.
analyst David Bain said the company’s Macau casinos may post
record revenue in August.  Bill Gates , 56, is the world’s second richest person with a
$63.6 billion fortune. The Microsoft co-founder lost $576
million during the week as the world’s largest software
company’s shares dipped 1.1 percent.  Amancio Ortega , Europe’s richest man, has a fortune valued
at $45.6 billion, according to the index. The 76-year-old
retailer made $561 million during the week as his  Inditex SA (ITX) ,
the world’s largest clothing retailer, rose 0.14 percent.  Ortega has been jostling with  Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (BRK/A) 
chairman  Warren Buffett  for the title of world’s third-richest
man. Ortega bumped Buffett, 81, from the No. 3 spot on the index
on Aug. 6, after shares of Inditex surged. Buffett, who is worth
$45.8 billion, reclaimed the position Aug. 10.  The  Bloomberg Billionaires Index  takes measure of the
world’s wealthiest people based on market and economic changes
and Bloomberg News reporting. Each net worth figure is updated
every business day at 5:30 p.m. in New York and is listed in
