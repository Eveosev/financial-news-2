Kansai Electric Power Co. (9503)  and Japan
Atomic Energy Agency should conduct additional checks for fault
lines under the Mihama plant and the fast-breeder reactor at
Monju, according to the Nuclear and Industrial Safety Agency.  Fractured zones under the two plants in Fukui prefecture,
western Japan, may move together with an active fault line near
the stations, the nuclear watchdog said today in a draft report.  The agency, known as NISA, earlier ordered additional
seismic investigations at the Higashidori, Shika, Tsuruga, and
Ohi nuclear plants as the country carried out additional safety
assessments after the March 11, 2011, quake and tsunami. The
plant operators may be forced to decommission the reactors if
the fault lines are confirmed to be active.  Kansai Electric and Hokuriku Electric plan to submit an
interim report on the additional surveys at Ohi and Shika to the
regulators by the end of October, the agency said. Tohoku
Electric and  Japan  Atomic will report on Higashidori and Tsuruga
by the end of November, the agency said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
