The Bankas Snoras AB’s creditors
committee picked an investor to buy the bank’s leasing unit and
Finasta Bank AB.  The creditors received bids from four potential investors,
Aurelija Mazintiene, the chairwoman of the creditors committee,
said in an e-mailed statement today. The investor will still
require an approval from  Lithuania ’s central bank. The size of
the transaction and the buyer’s name will be disclosed later, it
said.  The central bank took over Snoras, once Lithuania’s third-
biggest bank by deposits, in November after discovering that
assets reported on its balance sheet were missing. The lender
was declared bankrupt.  To contact the reporter on this story:
