Inc., an online communications software provider that also
operates Swaylo.com, a website that tracks a person’s influence

sharing provider Instragram, has been buying smaller companies
that provide social network and information-sharing tools.  The deal, terms of which were not disclosed, was announced
by Threadsy’s Chief Executive Officer Rob Goldman via a blog on
Swaylo’s website. Ashley Zandy, a spokeswoman for Facebook,
