Anders Behring Breivik, the self-
confessed killer of 77 people in twin attacks in  Norway  last
year, was judged to be mentally fit for prison by the Oslo court
hearing his case, Judge Wenche Elizabeth Arntzen said.  Breivik, who asked to be found sane in order to further his
arguments against multiculturalism, has admitted to the killings
while arguing he’s not guilty of any crime.  The judges were presented with two psychiatric reports, one
which found Breivik unfit for sentencing and the other which
deemed him to be sane. He’s said he will appeal an insanity
verdict, which the prosecution is seeking.   The longest prison sentence in Norway, where there is no
death penalty, is 21 years. That can be extended by five years
at a time if an inmate is still judged a danger to society.
Consignment to a psychiatric ward would have no time limit.  To contact the reporter on this story:
