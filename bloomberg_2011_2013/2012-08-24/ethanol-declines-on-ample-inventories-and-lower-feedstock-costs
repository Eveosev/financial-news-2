Ethanol futures declined for a third
day in  Chicago  on ample stockpiles of the biofuel and lower
prices for corn.  Futures fell 1 percent on the drop for corn, the primary
ingredient in U.S.-made ethanol. An Aug. 22 Energy Department
report showed  inventories  last week rose 0.3 percent to 18.5
million barrels, 1.4 percent higher than a year earlier.  “There seems to be a lot of ethanol for sale,” said Jim Damask, a manager at BiofuelsConnect, a Jupiter, Florida-based
alternative energy broker. “There’s some inventory that hasn’t
been scooped up yet.”  Denatured ethanol for September delivery slid 2.7 cents to
$2.601 a gallon on the Chicago Board of Trade, the lowest
settlement since Aug. 17. The futures have gained 18 percent
this year.  “It’s going to have a hard time rallying until we can eat
through some of that inventory,” Damask said.  In cash market trading, ethanol was unchanged in  New York 
at $2.68 a gallon, in Chicago at $2.615 and in the U.S. Gulf at
$2.675 a gallon, data compiled by Bloomberg show. Prices on the
West Coast dropped 1 cent, or 0.4 percent, to $2.75.  Ethanol  production  in the U.S. has rebounded 3.4 percent to
823,000 barrels a day from a more than two-year low of 796,000
in the week ended July 20, Energy Department data shows.  Corn Futures  Corn for December delivery declined 6.25 cents, or 0.8
percent, to $8.085 a bushel in Chicago. One bushel makes at
least 2.75 gallons of the renewable fuel.  Producers are losing 32 cents on each gallon of ethanol
manufactured, based on the September contracts for corn and the
biofuel, Bloomberg data show.  Plants can ease those losses by selling dried distillers
grains, a byproduct of ethanol production that can be fed to
cattle and livestock.  The value of Renewable Identification Numbers, known as
RINs, fell 1.3 percent to 3.7 cents, data compiled by Bloomberg
show. They are credits that help the government track whether
refiners are meeting 2012 federal ethanol use mandates.  To contact the reporter on this story:
