Turkiye Garanti Bankasi AS (GARAN) ,  Turkey ’s
biggest bank by market value, borrowed $400 million from the
 Overseas Private Investment Corporation , the development-finance
arm of the U.S. government.  The loan is over a 14-year period and will be used to
finance small-and-medium sized enterprises, the Istanbul-based
lender said in a filing today.  “Garanti has become the Turkish institution receiving the
highest amount in loans from OPIC with this latest
transaction,” Deputy Chief Executive Officer Ali Fuat Erbil
said. “We worked on our own and didn’t require the help of a
foreign bank on this and that is a first in Turkey.”  Garanti is 25 percent owned by  Banco Bilbao Vizcaya
Argentaria SA (BBVA)  of Spain. The Turkish bank’s shares were unchanged
at 7.66 liras at 3:04 p.m. in Istanbul trading today.  To contact the reporters responsible for this story:
